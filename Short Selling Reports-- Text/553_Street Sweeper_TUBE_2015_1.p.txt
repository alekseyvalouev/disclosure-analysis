TubeMogul: Why This Stock Will Go Down The Tubes
Jan. 30, 2015 4:24 PM ET46 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


TUBE’s capture of Oreo-maker Mondoleze helped fuel its successful IPO. However,
despite the CEO’s reassurances, Google has secured much of TUBE’s business
with that customer.


Google’s gain may signify the beginning of TUBE’s customer base erosion.


Almost as soon as the 180-day post-IPO lockup expired, TUBE's CTO began selling
thousands of shares. This suggests a lack of confidence; opens floodgates for more
selling.


TUBE is extremely expensive as it tries to navigate in a field of nearly 200
competitors, including many well-heeled, proven household names.


TUBE is not only expensive for potential investors, its price is so high it will repel any
potential buyers.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Behind the scenes, TubeMogul (TUBE) is in a world of hurt. Digital media giant Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has practically run away with one of Tube's
biggest customers.


But this bad break - and its unfortunate future implications - has flown under the radar until
now. It's the first of three negatives threatening to clobber Tube's shareprice.


Flash back to last June. Folks in the Emeryville, Calif. headquarters buzzed with
anticipation that TubeMogul had seemingly knocked down a king-maker partnership with
Mondelez International.


TubeMogul provides self-serve software that allows advertisers to plan, buy and measure
the effectiveness of video ads. Its recent customer Mondelez manufactures Oreo, Wheat
Thins and various chocolates, gum and candy.


Brett Wilson, TubeMogul's CEO and co-founder said,

Mondelez International's digital branding strategy has always been ahead of the
curve. The way they harness the power of software to amplify their strategy is
groundbreaking and we're proud to enable that in video.


The deal helped propel the money-losing Tube to its initial public offering last July.


Tube quickly settled into an overvalued spot on the Nasdaq. Though the IPO price got cut
to $7 from the originally proposed $11-$13, Tube shares blasted off, quickly gaining 240
percent. Shares settled recently around $16, handing the company a valuation
approaching half-a-billion dollars.


But, just four months after the TubeMogul announcement, Google and Mondelez held
what's described as contentious behind-the-scenes negotiations.


Google wanted Mondelez to use DoubleClick Bid Manager, Google's demand-side
buying platform, instead of competitor TubeMogul, to execute the YouTube
transactions as part of the deal, and it was using YouTube's TrueView pricing system
as leverage, according to multiple executives directly involved in the negotiations.


- Digiday, a website for tech geeks, wrote of the Mondelez-Google negotiations.


Google had pushed Tube aside.


Bonin Bough, Mondelez vice president of global media said,


The Google partnership is one of the most substantial partnerships we've done to
date. Not only does it give us access to deep and rich consumer insights, as well as
measurement and tracking, but we're also collaborating with Google on these
content-creation pilots by leveraging YouTube studios.


He added in this video,


We believe this new model of high content-creation at low cost will help us craft a
path towards the future.


During Tube's November earnings call, RBC Capital Markets analyst Rohit Kulkarni asked
about the Google-Mondelez deal.


But CEO Wilson seemed to gloss over the issue:

… broadly speaking we thought that the Mondelez announcement was positive. It is
yet another large brand signaling that they are shifting TV ad dollars into digital. In
this case, into digital video.


Now this particular announcement was a spend commitment that Mondelez is
making with Google as a publisher. We believe that we will continue to be used as
Mondelez's software for brand advertising and will be the pipes, if you well, to
facilitate any of their publisher buys Google or otherwise. The Mondelez partnership
continues to do well.


During that same earnings call, CEO Wilson's introduction included this upbeat
promotional comment:


Mondelez, the world's largest snack company with beloved brands like Oreo, Chip
Ahoy! and Wheat Thins, has likewise indicated that they are targeting for 50% of
their total ad budget to go into digital by 2016, so it is no longer a question of
whether TV dollars will shift to digital. It is just a question of how much of the $200
billion global TV ad market will shift and how long it will take.


But the promise has fizzled. Now the situation appears to be a jaw-dropping loss for Tube.


Digiday wrote,


Google's Mondelez deal called for Google to make YouTube inventory - including
TrueView ads - available to be bought programmatically sometime in early 2015, a
feature that does not currently exist. The catch was that Mondelez would have to
buy that inventory through Google's DSP.


Mondelez, a $59 billion snack company, agreed to buy a certain percentage of ads
through TubeMogul and use Google for the rest.


And the arrangement describes a greater decline in use of Tube in the future:


But part of that compromise was an understanding that Mondelēz would in
subsequent years purchase a greater percentage of its TrueView ads with DBM, and
use TubeMogul less.


- Digiday reported.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2870056-tubemogul-why-this-stock-will-go-down-the-tubes 4/18


An analyst who requested anonymity told TheStreetSweeper,


It's clear Tube's technology is nothing special, since Google did this. And besides
Google, there's a lot of other companies that could do the same. There's no
stickiness to their business.


A Tube federal filing clearly notes the concern:


A variety of factors outside of our control could affect our revenue growth, including
changes in spend budgets of advertisers and the timing and size of their spend.


So, Google's gain is just the beginning of Tube's customer base erosion. What's to keep
Google and other giants from snapping up another customer - and another?


On that basis alone, we believe it won't be long before Tube's nearly $500 million
valuation gets the axe.


Today's press release about Tube providing the platform, not inventory, for two 15-second
Mondelez ads during the Big Game is simply a test of technology during the football
game. This doesn't cancel out the arrangement that over time, Google will take over most
of Tube's deal with Mondelez.


This also highlights how Tube issues promotional press releases about Mondelez, but
doesn't want to talk about Google's significant threat to Tube's partnership.


Investors may read other viewpoints on Tube HERE, but we'll point out some other jarring
bumps affecting Tube.


*Insider sells shares right after lockup expiration. Expect more to follow.


The IPO offered 6.25 million shares. But, nearly three times that many shares - 22.4
million - were set aside as restricted shares for Tube officers, directors and other major
shareholders.


Insiders were required under a lockup agreement not to trade those shares for 180 days.
Those millions of looming shares poised to dilute stock currently held by Tube investors
have now been unlocked.


With the stock trading as high as $18.40 - more than double the IPO price - the shares
unlocked Jan. 14, 2015.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2870056-tubemogul-why-this-stock-will-go-down-the-tubes 5/18


The very day the lockup expired - Bam! - Tube's chief technology officer Adam Rose sold
over 7,500 shares.


Under an automatic sales plan set up and controlled by Mr. Rose, this was the first of four
batches the freshly minted millionaire has sold so far, totaling 82,531 shares at an average
price of about $16.50.


As of Jan. 20, Mr. Rose had 473,393 shares left (a comma was left off in Nasdaq's chart
below), yet he's clearly taking a lot of chips off the table, according to the filing.


Interesting that, the day after Mr. Rose's first sale, the CEO stated he knew of no insider
selling. CEO Wilson told Bloomberg on Jan. 15, when asked to comment on the apparent
sell off of company stock and resulting 20 percent price drop at lockup expiration,


I'm not selling. I'm not aware of any of our major shareholders that are selling.


What does Mr. Rose know that Mr. Wilson doesn't? And if this insider truly believes the
company's future is strong, why sell now?


Furthermore, if the football game arrangement Tube announced today is so big, why on
earth would insiders be selling shares now?


Mr. Rose may be leading the charge. We expect to see more insiders follow suit at these
prices, further pinching the value of shares held by average investors.


*Pricey Stock Compared to Rivals


Perhaps the competition, beginning with customer-grabbing Google, is part of what has
spooked the chief technology officer. In this competitive space, Tube finds itself up against
108 prepackaged software companies.

These include flexible, well-heeled household brands like Adobe Systems, Intuit and
Microsoft.


Looking at a total of 169 reviews comparing Tube with nine competitors currently offering
similar functionality, Tube's competitors, with rare exception, were rated as performing
well. Tube did well with the only two people who reviewed it.


In contrast, 92 people reviewed Google's product and offered generally glowing reviews.
One Google reviewer stated:


It allows us to reach a large audience with an investment that is significantly less
than traditional advertising methods such as print advertising.


Let's compare two more similar emerging video ad companies, Rocket Fuel
(NASDAQ:FUEL) and YuMe (NYSE:YUME). Investors can see from the chart below that
Tube - with revenue last quarter falling behind the previous quarter - is outrageously
overpriced compared with these peers.


Tube's price to earnings ratio is spectacularly high, and the often preferred metric -
enterprise multiple or EV/EBITDA (enterprise-value-to-earnings-before-interest-taxes-
depreciation-and amortization) - also shows Tube is pricey for average investors. It is 4 ½
to 8 ½ times more expensive than the others. That high enterprise multiple also tells
bigger companies that Tube would be a very poor buyout candidate. Here's the chart:

Comments (46)


In a field with so many tough players, Tube will find grabbing any significant market share
very tough going. Market share is vital to profitability. And as Tube noted in a recent
federal filing:


We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in
the future.


Conclusion:


Tube has essentially lost a major customer to Google, its newly unlocked shares are
getting dumped on the market as Tube's chief technology officer issues a lack-of-
confidence vote in her own company, and Tube is extremely expensive and tiny amid well-
heeled, proven competitors. Finally, even if the company does develop a distinguishable
product, Tube is way too pricey to be a buyout target.


There's a lot of bad news here. In our opinion, Tube stock is going right down the tubes.

We have seen this before play out in the mid-2000s, where Google came in and just killed everyone. In this case,
Google is coming to Mondelez with a full offering from demandside buying platform (Doubleclick Bid Manager) to
premium ad inventory provider (i.e. Youtube). By offering a full vertical stack solution, there will be superior targeting
and better ROI for Mondelez. That means Mondelez ad buyers will look smart and get a better year bonuses, so no
brainer for Mondelez.


TUBE solution is no better than anyone elses. At the end of the day, it is about efficiency and reach, and
Google/Youtube is the best in-breed. TUBE should be trading at the same valuation as FUEL.


30 Jan 2015, 05:14 PM


Droney
Actually TUBE is trading at a LOWER valuation than FUEL, and growing revenues literally TWICE as fast Y/Y.


30 Jan 2015, 05:27 PM


DiscrepNinja
Please explain to me how TUBE's solution is no different than anyone?


You say that Youtube is the best ROI for advertisers? Think about this; 
Less than 1% of videos on youtube ever exceed one million views. youtube doesn't allow you to handpick
which channel or specific video your ad goes to. TV advertisers like to choose where their inventory goes,
that's why TUBE wins.


Also, if you pay more money to have your video in the featured or spotlight section you will receive on
average 86,100 views per day. This compares to 119,864 views per day back in 2008, people aren't looking at
the ads like they used to.

You know when the tone of an article is bombastic and unbalanced there is a vested interest. Turns out the author is
short TUBE and clearly talking the price down to profit. Her "points" are weak. Namely, that a tech IPO is not yet
profitable (holy cow! that is Craaaazzzzyyy), and that the CTO would sell a small portion (~15%) of his stock is a
harbinger of bad news. The Google strong arm in the Mondelez deal is a bona fide negative, but TUBE's value
proposition is also that it has no vested interests on the publishing side to conflict with its interests in supporting
advertisers. TUBE's customer list and revenues are growing too fast for one or two lost deals like this to hurt it. Finally,
the shallow comparisons to YUME and FUEL also show the bias here. Articles on this site and others do a deeper
comparison that shows how TUBE's model is uniquely favorable over those guys'. This down leg doesn't have much
room to run left here; would be wise to unwind any shorts now before you get squeezed.


30 Jan 2015, 06:15 PM

where do I start? This is one of the poorest written bash articles I've read.


The CTO is not a major shareholder at less than 2% of stock ownership. Brett Wilson said "major" shareholders.
When you consider the CTO's sale, only 1/3 of 1% of total shares available (22M) after the lockup were sold. That to
me is a bullish signal considering the stock is >100% higher since the IPO.


There is so much here-say and allegations that you might have well said "I heard from a friend".


Here are the facts as to why I'm investing: 
1) major tailwind support in digital brand advertising with room for many entrants to ride the waive.  
2) 9/30 10Q reports expanding client base (doubling YOY) and revenues from existing clients increasing materially
from subsequent years (increased wallet spend per client). 
3) growth in self-directed advertising signaling a change in how advertisers plan and manage campaigns (yes they
want independence). 
4) no debt, plenty of cash to support growth. 
5) emergence and first mover advantage in programmatic TV (see Mondoleze announcement today).


I'll see you next month at $20, after Q4 is announced and they blow the doors off.

Seems like a bad name for a company - TubeMogul.


I think BrightCove ($BCOV) tried this too and failed. Still around though with 100M or so in sales. Just a 2x sales
multiple though vs 6x for TubeMogul $TUBE. I think it's hard to get pricing leverage in this business.

If you are going to criticize the quality of writing of an article, you should at least use good English.


For example, it should ready, "This is one of the most poorly written articles...."


The correct use of adverbs is crucial.


No more needs to be mentioned.

For example, "it should read".

If you're going to go all grammatical, ElChico, then you really should have used the subjunctive tense in your

No more *need* be mentioned.

The absence of all grammatical errors is not by itself the best indicator of the quality of an author's critical
thinking. By your argument, however, the original author, Sonya, would have no merit either since "his" article
states that the CTO, Adam, sold some of "her" stock.

Hanging on to half a million shares doesn't strike me as a "lack-of-confidence vote in her[sic] own company"


The reporter who wrote this over-the-top diatribe must feel pretty insecure about her job if she feels she has to pander
to her employer's disclosed short position on Tube like this.


And ArthuMiles hit the nail on the head with his comment about conflict of interest. Using Google's Doubleclick Bid
Manager to bid for advertising slots on Google's media make's about as much sense as asking a realtor to find you
the best deal on a house, only to discover he owns all the houses in his listings. 
My disclosure: I'm long n Tube, and in for the long run.


01 Feb 2015, 05:28 AM


LongTube
I just watched the Mondelez 'sound-byte' video explaining their deal with Google and that seems to shed some light
on the irrelevance of this deal to Tube and other independent ad software services.


Mondelez are into the world of video content creation. They have Blink Studios, which creates short-form news
videos, and are partnering with other content creators, such as FullScreen.


ArthurMiles' comment about DoubleClick's conflict of interest hardly does justice to the relationship that is unfolding
now Mondelez have joined the party, since publisher's like Google (YouTube) share ad revenue with content
providers.


if Google's DoubleClick Bid Manager is not conflicted enough (a bit like a realtor who only sells property that he owns,
and expects you to believe he is negotiating the best deal for you) Mondelez join the party with a stake in the content
that drives consumer eyes to the ads. Sticking with the real estate analogy, If Mondalez were in property acquisition,
buying houses for tenants (the brands they advertise) who will ultimately pay rent in proportion to the cost of the
houses (the bid win price), their willingness to buy houses on the recommendation of a realtor who owns them all
appears a bit less foolish if the realtor is giving them back a cut of the price they pay. In the end the tenants
(Mondelez's brands) will lose out and move to ad agencies who prefer to use independent, un-conflicted ad auction
platforms, like Tube.

You need to do more research bud.


I believe the sell-off is way over done.


TUBE has diversified their customer base pretty well. Mondelez isn't even 10% of tubes revenue so losing SOME
revenue from google is not too worrisome. TUBE has grown dramatically without them.


As for the premium, we can have our arguments about young-growth-tech. However, the premium is certainly
warranted. I don't know how much you know about ad-techs but TUBES business model/ specific niche within ad-tech
is why the multiple is warranted;


1.) YUMI, FUEL, TRMR are essentially all ad networks in a market with far too much supply causing it to become
commoditized. They are on an RFP basis which means they need to have a drastic salesforce for every sale. They
may win one campaign but have to have a repeat win for another campaign with the same customer. Also, on the
supply side of things these guys have to split sales depending on whoevers inventory the ad spend was devoted.
Gross margins are around 50% for platform direct/managed services programmatic platforms because they have high
publishing costs and far lower on the operating side because of the salesforce. It takes 4x the salesforce for platform
services compared to a direct platform.


While TUBE does has have a platform service segment it's to garnish more tv spend. Currently, 44% of TUBE's sales
from direct, that's up 83bps y/y... With platform direct, customers choose exactly what website they want to have ad
spend towards. With this model TUBE is 100% advertiser focused and has no incentives to shift client dollars to
publishers. The client chooses where they want to send the inventory and TUBE makes a 25% commission. The
gross margins are 97% for this model.


The differentiating factor is this, these ad-techs are trying to get TV dollars any which way possible. Programmatic
digital is certainly coming it's just a matter of when. TUBE has been so successful compared to their peer group
because advertisers don't want a blackbox. If you look at TV ad spend historically, these guys like to a.) choose where
they send their spend and b.) like to see where it's going. No competitor does this. Furthermore, TUBE is purely
concentrated in digital video. All digital spend is being shifted towards video. Display is diminishing, which
ROCKETFUEL is solely concentrated in. TUBE is positioning themselves as easily the best players in the market.


Customers spend 9x more on TUBEs direct platform compared to managed services on average. TV guys like being
in control and seeing where exactly their spend is going.


The premium is absolutely warranted. I do admit young growth tech is very volatile and cash ends up being king. So
typically you see a valuation shift from p/s to p/cf or ev/ebitda once these guys are more profitable. But TUBE has a
long ways to go in terms of margin expansion as platform direct becomes a larger part of the mix.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2870056-tubemogul-why-this-stock-will-go-down-the-tubes 13/18


So let's do the math; programmatic video is poised to out due the total programmatic market dramatically. The CAGR
to 2017 for programmatic video is 58% compared to 37% for all programmatic. TUBE has the lock on this segment.
Let's be conservative and say TUBE has a 34% CAGR to $273MM in by 2017. We also adjust for platform direct in
the mix and hike gross profit up to 70%. Considering operational costs we'll give these guys a 15-16% EBITDA
margin. So if you look at the average ev/2017e multiple for all ad techs it's 10.6x and TUBEs is ~10x even though
they are a far better company. You have guys like Criteo, FUEL, and Rubicon project who are in lower growth rate
segments of ad tech such as display or banner trading at 10.6x, 17.5x, and 9x respectively.

It's hard to figure out where this one goes from here. From 30,000 feet none of these companies has ever been able
to create enough differentiation to thrive. Doesn't mean someone might not eventually do it but thusfar none have -

The other thing is go try out their oneload platform - it's okay but pretty basic - even the demonstration video overview
is borderline unprofessional - you can even hear some dog barking in the background as you get to the end. That's
just a big yellow flag for me.


Tempting name to do more work on if we get to it...

Each ad-tech is developing their niche currently. TUBE has the best self-serve platform bar none, I don't know
what other names you've tried. You have Criteo leveraging their very solid retail analytics on the dsp side.


TUBE is getting the best share of tv revenue because the self-serve is formatted for how tv buyers usually
purchased inventory.


Which platform did you try? They have a mock try but it's not even close to the real thing, and it's not like
you're actually sending out any ads...

What about Videology and Adap.tv ? At least the former has a better campaign planning and decisioning
system than Tube. They are also ahead of Tube in positioning themselves for programmatic TV spending via
convergence of TV and online video.

It's pretty bizarre. I think it's because many of the newer sell-side guys don't know ad-tech very well. Tube
Mogul goes after larger enterprise contracts and I think many people aren't aware of how much longer their
sales cycles are.


4Q had pretty strong results, Platform direct ARPU increase 17% y/y, way above estimates and my model.
Gross profit increased 77% y/y , once again way above estimates.


It's funny how a company can issue slightly lower sales guidance for 1Q15 but higher FY15 guidance than
estimates and trade down 28%. What I like most about the stock is that with their specific model they can hold
take rates pretty high at 26%. If you look at other programmatic platforms they're really commoditizing the
inventory and now dealing with promotional pressure from new entrants, you can see this reflected on the
take rates.


I'm still good on my cost basis but am certainly going to be buying some shares today. Not sure how slightly
lower 1Q15 guidance accounting for seasonality of upfronts/ slight forex can knock a stock 28%. Pretty funny
if you ask me.

Great comment DN. I agree.


If TUBE increases sales by the same dollar value in 2015, we're looking at $165M annual revenues (50%
growth rate).


27 Feb 2015, 10:52 AM


DiscrepNinja
Which is solid IMO. I've had to deal with this situation for two of the stocks I cover TUBE and NMBL. So
bizarre. I think it's just a battle of the shorts vs. longs. You saw a nice short squeeze on these two names
before reporting, and God forbid they provide in-line guidance, as if these models me and sell-side guys
produce don't mean anything, and the stock drops. Pretty wild.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2870056-tubemogul-why-this-stock-will-go-down-the-tubes 16/18


I honestly think it's because fx is hitting your average company 3-7%, so earnings are slightly depressed, and
a stock is really reacting on multiples instead of earnings or both. It's a tough environment. With hot stocks
people expect consistent beats and an in-line to slightly up guidance can hurt a stock. Pretty interesting.


On the TUBE end, another thing I don't think people are taking into account is the shift to platform direct
frommanaged services, which is preferred obviously. Well platform direct makes less sales because they just
have a take rate of direct spend vs being able to recognize full sales from managed services. They are solely
looking at that and ignoring the margin profiles of the businesses. I think platform direct performed even better
than TUBE thought and that was what was plugged into the sales guide. Hince, why EBITDA is starting to
leverage stronger.


When you deal with hot stocks that are growing at these rates you have to deal with the investor base shift.
Sales guys don't give a crap about s&m spend but just want sales to continue to drive their ev/sales valuation.
Well when you start getting EBITDA in the mix you start to evaluate on ev/ebitda. When you average these
two investor perceptions/multiples on the base it lowers on the onset because EBITDA leverage has a long
runway to be able to have the consistency of the sales. I think that's what we're dealing with here.


27 Feb 2015, 11:37 AM


dancingmonkeys
Yah DN, I am glad you are hanging in there with a low cost base. I know a lot of guys who are not so
fortunate. The high multiple implies high expectations, and when they aren't met, the stock re-rates. It
happens all the time in tech and specifically on earns.


Lots of folks can have contra opinions on the bear thesis, which is perfectly fine. Personally, I don't think
TUBE should be worth less than it is today, but that is just my opinion. I just don't believe in their value add in
terms and long-term viability. Applying a simply Porter's 5-forces, I am just not there with TUBE.


But I do wish everyone goodluck!


27 Feb 2015, 02:01 PM


347242
All very good points. Think about this, if $165M revenues are achieved in FY15, at 77%+ gross margins you
are now into positive EBITDA range. I think as they execute the price will move back up (60-90 days).


What are your thoughts on a capital raise given the negative EBITDA outlook and likely higher A/R run rate
depleting cash?


27 Feb 2015, 02:02 PM


DiscrepNinja
Well this is an interesting situation, I've seen it with two of the high growth/ young tech stocks I cover who
reported last night; TUBE issued FY15 guidance roughly in line with the street, if you account for fx it's
essentially in-line beat. Accounting for the slower revenue but at much higher margins because of the
unexpected mix shift towards platform direct I'm not surprised they lowered the guide. It's going to take some

5/23/2018 TubeMogul: Why This Stock Will Go Down The Tubes - TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2870056-tubemogul-why-this-stock-will-go-down-the-tubes 17/18


time for ad-techs to be known well. I've spoken to the CEOs of TRMR, CRTO, RUBI, and TUBE 1-3 times and
am starting to understand the industry a little bit better. If you want to get the best coverage of ad-techs speak
to Jason Helfstein of Opco, that guy can tell you anything about this very ambiguous industry.


TUBEs multiple was high, the multiples for the industry are widely sparsed as well which doesn't help in terms
of definitive valuations. I will tell you this though, after a year of these guys being public I think an average ad-
tech growing sales at 25%+ should trade at around 2.5x EV/FWD Sales.


One issue, these guys are all concentrated pure plays in different sub segments of ad-tech so their growth
rates/margin profiles are so different. Since TUBE mogul is shifting towards self-serve model, which is the
preferred buying mechanism of tv ad purchaser they will get lower revenue just because of the take rate of
gross spend but will have 1/4th the salesforce required to continually go out and get repeat RFPs. Also, they
don't have to purchase inventory either, so they don't have any publisher relationships. Advertisers really like
knowing that a DSP will only be focused on getting them the best deal, not like TRMR who has a DSP and
SSP and decides whether the advertiser or publisher gets a better deal. I like that model, once you see them
comp this past year and investors get used to this model I think they will gain inverstor sentiment.


I don't like using consolidation as an investment thesis ever but here's how I see TUBE Mogul. They have the
best DSP in the game, they're solely concentrated in DSP video which is where all of the display and tv spend
is shifting towards, they're winning huge contracts like Heineken, are setting up well with their PTV. All of
these programmatic guys are being taken out, Facebook paid 5x TTM sales for Live Rail, AOL paid 4.05x
TTm sales for adept tv, Yahoo is purchasing Brightroll. TUBE has a better product than those guys in terms of
DSP and agency relationships, I think TUBE deserves the same 4x multiple.


27 Feb 2015, 02:31 PM


DiscrepNinja
Sorry, busy day with earnings, I didn't conclude my thought.


You can say what you want in terms of long-term viability/value-add but ask anyone who knows ad-tech well
and they'll respond that TUBE has the best DSP in the game. They will grow very well on a stand-alone basis,
they are also the best acquisition candidate out the current public pack.


All expectations were met, I'm not sure what people are seeing that threw them off. I believe they don't
understand TUBE very well and don't understand the mix-shift occurring.


At 3.3x FWD sales (I have very conservative sales estimates right now as well) TUBE is a steal. My guess is
that google is the best fit acquirer of TUBE and would have to pay somewhere around 5x FWD sales for the
company. In the interim, I think you will see TUBE pick back up to 4x sales with a few partnership
announcements.


27 Feb 2015, 02:35 PM


DiscrepNinja
TUBE is fine on cash. Guidance is for EBITDA within the range of -$19 to -$9MM. I think if PD shift continued
then it could be lower than the high end. They have $48MM in cash, and will probably only spend $9-$19MM
