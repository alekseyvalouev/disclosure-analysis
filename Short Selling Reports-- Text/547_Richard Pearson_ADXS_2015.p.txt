Advaxis: Heavily Promoted And Misleading Investors
Jan. 21, 2015 9:30 AM ET165 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Advaxis stock has recently quadrupled from $3 to as high as $13.


Management has a history of promotional and misleading activities, including heavy
use of the Dream Team Group.


Tumor response data for its lead candidate has been mis-presented to overstate
effectiveness.


ADXS-HPV has demonstrated notably inferior survival rates vs. alternatives.


Over 3 million warrant shares are set to hit the market following registration by
Advaxis.


We are just a few weeks into the year, and already shares of Advaxis (NASDAQ:ADXS)
are up by more than 60%. But that's nothing. The shares have fully quadrupled since their
November lows.


Advaxis stock has suddenly become extremely liquid, trading 2-4 million shares per day. It
also has liquid calls and puts.

There are a number of factors driving Advaxis' share price recently. Part of the rise is due
to the rise in other biotechs, such as Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) and Juno
(NASDAQ:JUNO), with Advaxis rising in sympathy.


Kite and Juno were both recent IPOs which have been very well received due to their
apparent prospects in immuno-oncology therapies. Those who promote Advaxis do so by
claiming that tiny Advaxis is also on the way to a multibillion dollar market cap along with
Kite and Juno.


But Advaxis is not Kite, nor is it Juno. The underlying technology is fundamentally
different, although this has clearly been lost on the mostly retail investor base.


Advaxis has been around for 13 years and yet has only completed a single Phase 2 trial.
That trial had to be run in India, in just a single site. Despite the obvious problems with the
Phase 2 study (described below), Advaxis has made the questionable decision to take it
into Phase 3 trials. This "decision" has also served to boost the stock. But in Phase 3,
Advaxis is actually using an entirely different study design - meaning that it cannot even
guess what the results might be. It is pure nonsense.

This is why Advaxis had previously spent much of its life as a 10 cent busted reverse
merger biotech. In 2013, the company did a massive 1:125 reverse split to get the stock
above $3 so that it could list on NASDAQ. However, the stock frequently continued to
languish below $3.00 even after its uplisting. Even after completion of its only Phase 2
study, Advaxis was still sitting at well below $3.00.


It is clear that it is not some major clinical progress that has driven Advaxis to quadruple.
Instead, much of it has been simply heavy promotion. Well designed stock promotions can
easily have an explosive effect on micro caps, causing them to briefly surge by hundreds
of percent before giving up all of their gains. Examples are shown below.


If history is any guide, we will see a sharp decline in Advaxis very quickly, taking the stock
back to around $4-5 where it was in December. This is simply another heavily promoted,
retail driven microcap stock being traded by technical day traders for the moment. Advaxis
is held more than 70% by retail investors such that it is often subject to much wilder
swings on sentiment than stocks which have broad institutional holdings.


Yet despite the obvious problems with Advaxis, it is unlikely to fall to zero any time soon.
There is enough positive sentiment for immuno-oncology stocks that Advaxis will continue
to be able to issue more stock in equity offerings as long as the offering price is low
enough. This is why we will see prices around $4-5 and not prices of $1-2.


The recent registration of over 3 million warrant shares may be the catalyst for the decline
when those shares hit the market. The company raised $17 million in December at $4.25.
But since then the share price has tripled and volume has surged. As a result, I fully
expect the company to undertake an even larger equity offering very quickly. This will
further pressure the share price back down to $4-5. I expect that such an offering
could already be in the works and could come any day now.


Advaxis and its management have a visible history of promotional activities and
misleading investors which should be of concern to those who are buying the stock
at such lofty current levels.


Former Advaxis CEO Thomas Moore was charged by the SEC with misleading and
defrauding investors in his previous company, Biopure. He had the company issue
promotional statements which caused the stock to jump above $7.00 per share. He then
used the spike in price and volume to raise $35 million in an equity offering. As the
negative truth eventually filtered out, the stock plunged by 60% - initially. Biopure
eventually filed for bankruptcy without ever receiving FDA approval for its products.

From the SEC complaint:


In 2003, Biopure Corporation ("Biopure"), and its chief executive officer, head of
regulatory affairs and general counsel engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
misrepresent and conceal from investors the truth about its applications for Food
and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval of Hemopure….two days after receiving
the complete response letter from the FDA, Biopure issued a fraudulent and
misleading press release that gave the false impression the company had received
positive news from the FDA. That day, Biopure's stock closed at $7.30 per share,
a 22% increase over its previous day close. For four additional months from August
until December 1 1,2003, Biopure continued to conceal from investors that it had
received a complete response letter from the FDA, continued to make false
statements about its dealings with the FDA and failed to disclose the true scope
and nature of the deficiencies with the BLA identified by the FDA. Indeed, on one
occasion in September 2003, Biopure disclosed in a prospectus filed with the
Commission that the July 30 letter it received was a complete response letter. When
Biopure's stock price dropped on heavy trading, the company told investors that the
reference to the letter as a complete response letter was a "mistake" by a "junior
lawyer at a law firm" retained by the company. The disclosure was quickly "fixed"
with the filing of an amended prospectus that omitted the reference to the letter as a
"complete response letter." As the truth about Biopure's applications for FDA
approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete disclosures, the
market reacted. As of year-end 2003, Biopure stock was trading below $3.00 per
share.


Moore was replaced as Advaxis' CEO by current CEO Daniel O' Connor in 2013.
However, he did not immediately leave the company. Instead, Moore stayed on as a
"consultant." With O'Connor at the helm as new CEO and Moore as its consultant,
Advaxis began making use of stock promotion firm "the Dream Team Group."


For those who are not familiar with the Dream Team, it is a stock promotion firm that was
responsible for publishing hundreds of articles on a wide variety of investment sites
promoting various biotech stocks using impressive sounding authors. However, all of the
articles were bought and paid for by the client companies and the supposed medical
expert "authors" were simply fabricated identities.


Fake posters were also used to infiltrate message boards and social media sites such as
Twitter to create the appearance of broad support for companies.

I first exposed the activities of this group in an article last year entitled "Behind The
Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena". Following that article, hundreds of their
articles were removed from a wide variety of investment web sites. For those who wish to
understand how powerful stock promotions can fuel stock prices, I strongly recommend
reading that article.


Like Advaxis, shares of heavily promoted biotechs CytRx (NASDAQ:CYTR) and
Galena (GALE) had quickly soared by hundreds of percent. Following my exposé of
the promotion scheme they quickly crashed by 60-80%. I expect that Advaxis will do
the same. The graphs below illustrate what we will see with Advaxis: first the
promoted quadruple, then the rapid implosion as day traders rush to exit.


A screenshot showing the disclosure of payment of $45,000 from Advaxis can be found
here for one campaign.


From a separate campaign (shown below) DTG received $25,000 and 15,000 shares of
stock. The disclosure noted that:


Meanwhile, the Dream Team and its Mission IR subsidiary made Advaxis the focus of a
successful case study on stock promotion for their marketing materials, boasting about:

The most recent spark which lit up the stock was an investment in December by Adage
Capital, upping their stake to over $20 million in Advaxis. Retail investors therefore take
the view that Adage has done deep due diligence and is making a concentrated bet on
Advaxis. The reality is that Adage manages over $25 billion such that this position
represents less than 0.001 of their holdings. The point is that what looks like a large
position to retail investors is actually a miniscule position to Adage. The strategy that firms
like Adage take is to hold numerous highly volatile small cap stocks based on a sector
allocation (such as immuno-oncology) and then buy in at rock bottom prices. Some of
them are bound to be doubles and triples just like Advaxis has already been since Adage
last bought at $4.25.


But the risk / reward proposition is entirely different for retail investors who are chasing it
higher at prices north of $13.00. Investors need to keep in mind that even when the stock
falls to $5.00, Adage will still be making a very attractive return on its overall investment.
The same will not be true for those who are buying at current levels.


Ultimately what matters for Advaxis will be the fundamentals. And with Advaxis, there are
major fundamental problems.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 8/48


How is Advaxis misleading investors?


The most important point to view with Advaxis comes from their recent corporate
presentation. In it is a slide that highlights "tumor response data" for its ADXS-HPV. The
data has been mis-presented to overstate how effective the drug is in shrinking tumors.


ADXS-HPV is Advaxis' lead compound and is currently being pushed into Phase 3 trials
based on this information. The chart highlights each patient and the height / direction of
the bar on the graph illustrates the tumor response rate.


The overwhelming standard for displaying such information is to display it in percentage
terms so that we can compare the response across tumor sizes between patients. Here
are 3 examples from the New England Journal of Medicine which demonstrate this
standard:


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1314583 (figure 1)


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302369 (figure 1)


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1006448 (figure 2)


This is how example #1 looks. Notice it is measured in percentage terms. Notice also the
massive "skew" to the right. This shows that in most cases there is heavy percentage
shrinkage of the tumor. That is what these studies are hoping to achieve.


But what we see with Advaxis is entirely different. In fact, it is almost meaningless.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 9/48


Advaxis displays their information in millimeters rather than percent. But (more
importantly) they also conveniently cut off the data at minus 100 millimeters. This clearly
gives the impression that the "minus 100's" are all minus 100%, indicating a complete
response. So in other words, they created a chart which is meant to look like the standard
chart, but which overstates their results.


If a 100 mm tumor shrinks by 100 mm, then that is a fantastic result. But if the tumor size
was 1,500 mm then a 100 mm shrink is nearly irrelevant. This is why the data is virtually
meaningless.


Notice also the skew is to the left, meaning that more of the tumors tend to increase in
size rather than decrease.


Once we realize that this data is displayed in millimeters and not in percent, the problem
becomes evident. Many of the patients who would have otherwise been classified as
"partial response" or "complete response" are in fact not categorized with any response at
all. We can see that this is a transparent attempt to massage the data into making ADXS-
HPV look more effective than it really is. (Author's Note: I took a screen shot of Advaxis'

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 10/48


presentation just prior to publication of my article. Since publication of the article it appears
that the company has updated the presentation to reflect tumor shrinkage data in %, not
millimeters.)


Overall, just 6 patients out of 110 generated any response (complete or partial)
whatsoever. That is less than a 6% response rate. Yet based on this, Advaxis has made
the "decision" to go into Phase 3 trials. It is nonsense.


Why does this matter?


In an older copy of their corporate presentation, we can see a page which highlights the
overall survival statistics for ADXS-HPV. This page was then quietly removed from the
presentation, but I made sure to save a copy. The reason Advaxis removed the page
should be obvious when reading below. The newly revised corporate presentation can be
found here.


The problem is that after 12 months we can see a survival rate of just 29-35% in the two
arms of the study. This is less than half of what was reported in a 2014 study using
Avastin (bevacizumab) as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (see Figure
3c below.)

Using some common sense on clinical trials


Many retail investors think that they understand the clinical trial process, but oftentimes
they clearly do not. A great detailed explanation can be found in the report "Why Do So
Many Phase 3 Clinical Trials Fail?"


One thing that retail investors routinely fail to understand is that drugs do not "pass"
Phase 2 trials. Instead, companies gather data and then decide for themselves whether or
not to proceed into Phase 3.


So why do so many expensive phase 3 trials fail ? It is because many companies will
proceed into Phase 3 even when their prospects are marginal because it provides a much
needed boost to the stock price. The companies can then raise enough money that they
can attempt to proceed with other drugs even if the main drug fails in Phase 3. This
happens very commonly in small cap biotech.


Investors need to keep in mind that most clinical trials for new drugs make use of multiple
trial sites in reliable test markets such as the US or Western Europe. But with Advaxis, the
company made use of just a single trial site located in India. It is very often the case that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 12/48


such results cannot be reproduced once actual rigor is added into the equation in a real
Phase 3 trial. Inability to replicate seemingly strong Phase 2 data is why a very large
number of drugs end up handily completing phase 2 trials only to fail phase 3 trials.


Adam Feuerstein of TheStreet.com highlighted several other problems with the Phase 2
trial. The study did not have a true control arm and there was no difference in overall
survival between the two arms of the study.


Feuerstein noted that:


An objective comparison between these two studies doesn't exactly justify the
optimism which Advaxis claims to see in the ADXS-HPV data. If the vaccine were
truly effective, we should be seeing a stronger synergistic effect between ADXS-HPV
and cisplatin. Instead, we see a median overall survival of 8.5 months for ADXS-
HPV plus cisplatin in the Advaxis study compared to 8.9 months for cisplatin
alone in the Moore study. Not exactly confidence inspiring…Unfortunately, I'm
not sure Advaxis' next step with ADXS-HPV will tell us much more about the
vaccine's efficacy. An ongoing, U.S.-based phase II study is set up to enroll only 67
patients with recurrent cervical cancer. The study isn't randomized and has no
control arm.


Complicating matters further, the structure of the Phase 3 trial has been radically changed
from that of the Phase 2 trial.


From the presentation, we can see the following description of the Phase 2 design.
Basically it was a comparison of ADXS-HPV alone vs. ADXS-HPV + Cisplatin.


Yet from a recent press release, Advaxis states:


Under the proposed collaboration, the GOG Foundation and Advaxis will conduct an
adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of concurrent chemotherapy and
radiation therapy (CCRT) compared to CCRT combined with ADXS-HPV in women
diagnosed with high-risk, locally advanced cervical cancer. Prior to commencing this
study, Advaxis will discuss the proposed Phase 3 program with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and will update its investigational new drug (IND)
submission. FDA may request additional information at that time, and Advaxis will
work expeditiously to respond to any such requests.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 13/48


So Advaxis is now comparing ADXS-HPV with chemo and radiotherapy (CCRT) to CCRT
alone. This is entirely different than what was done in the Phase 2 trial in India which
simply compared ADXS-HPV with and without Cisplatin. This means that Advaxis (and
investors) have no idea what results to expect from the new study.


Such an approach is quite literally preposterous. Basically Advaxis is proceeding
into a Phase 3 trial without having even performed a comparable Phase 2 trial first !!


Conclusion


Shares of Advaxis have soared due to excess hype and promotion. But there is a very
clear reason why this stock has spent most of its 13 year life being valued at less than
$100 million in market cap.


The only reason that Advaxis is drawing investors is that the hype surrounding immuno-
oncology is so strong in companies such as Kite and Juno. In order to keep hope alive,
Advaxis is pursuing combo studies with drugs from other pharmas such as Merck and
Medimmune. However these are simply Phase 1/2 studies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 14/48


With its lead compound ADXS-HPV, we can see that Advaxis appears to be manipulating
information to puff up an otherwise inferior drug. Studies of alternate cervical cancer drugs
have produced far better results as recently as 2014.


The structure of Advaxis' Phase 2 clinical trial in India is highly problematic. This is further
illustrated by the attempt to change the trial design to something new and untested in
Phase 3.


These problems are so absurd that there is clearly no reason for Advaxis' stock to be
surging - aside from heavy promotion and a huge contingent of technical driven retail
traders.


As shown above, management has a history of fraudulent dealings and use of stock
promotion firms including the Dream Team Group.


The run up in the stock from $3 to over $13 is quite clearly artificial and unsustainable and
it will quickly reverse itself. On January 6th, (just as the stock was really starting to run)
Advaxis filed a post effective amendment to its S3 filing allowing for the sale of over 3
million shares underlying previously issued warrants. This represents nearly 15% of
shares outstanding. As these shares begin to hit the market, they will be the catalyst
which breaks the momentum on the stock and sends it back to around $4-5 where it
began. A second catalyst will be a very predictable second equity offering from Advaxis,
taking full advantage of the spike in price and volume.

What a bunch of ... malarkey. The recent rise in the stock relates to (among other things) Adage Capital's
investment followed by Advaxis's filing of three NDAs (New Drug Applications) including one in partnership
with Merck and one in partnership with Medimmune. Clearly when Big Pharma wants to work with you,
investors will take notice.

He doesn't know what he means, but Advaxis has been hyping IND acceptances like crazy. All that means is
that the FDA has permitted them to start clinical trials of a drug. It's something so inconsequential that
reputable companies don't issue PR about it. An NDA filing is a much bigger deal - it means the company is
submitting a drug for FDA approval after successful phase III trials. When I read these BS PR's about IND
acceptances, I wonder if there's really anybody out there dumb enough to be impressed. Now I know.

conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the combination of ADXS-PSA (ADXS31-142) with
KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., in patients with previously treated, metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The clinical trial, which will be the first-in-human study of
Advaxis's lead Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate in prostate cancer, is expected to begin patient
enrollment in the first quarter of 2015.


The open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADXS-PSA as a
monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA, the first anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy
approved in the United States. KEYTRUDA is developed and marketed by Merck."

Bio.bobby RMarc and EG, I am eating crow and understand your points. I looked at what you said about IND
v NDA and I have to agree. The reason I truly like ADVAXIS is that I like the drug platform. I have researched
its history and it is based on good science. It is being developed in conjunction with University of
Pennsylvania. The Platform is based on attenuated lysteria. I could go on and on about that. The reason I am
in the stock is that I expect (a laymen's opinion) that it could by itself or in combination with other
immunutherapies work curatively as to some cancers at significantly higher rates than other treatments. That

If you understand the true competitive positioning of the company, you will see that the author completely
leaves it out in his article. The company is literally just past a highly significant inflection point, with the bring
on of David Mauro from Merck in October. Since then, they have moved extremely rapidly to get INDs (not
NDAs) approved.


Of highest significance are the 2 combination PD1 trials with Merck and MedImmune. It is completely untrue
that an IND is meaningless hype. To investors, the announcements offer useful and important feedback,
letting us know that management is moving in a certain direction, and at a certain speed. The speed and

I trust Adage. They have GREAT trackrecord


Adage Capital Management, L.P. (Adage) was the lead investor in this financing, with certain funds and accounts
managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. also participating in the transaction. Proceeds from this financing will be
used primarily to fund the continued clinical development of Advaxis's cancer immunotherapy pipeline.


Adage was founded in 2001 by Robert Atchinson and Phillip Gross. Adage is a Boston based institutional money
manager.


Adage Capital Management LP, the Boston hedge fund started by two former money managers at Harvard
University’s endowment, made almost $1 billion yesterday as a biotech company the firm backed surged following a
successful medical trial. Puma Biotechnology Inc. (PBYI) shares almost quadrupled after the company said its
experimental drug blocked the return of breast cancer in women with a type of early-stage disease. Adage owned
5.69 million common shares of Puma as of March 31, making it the largest outside investor with a 19 percent stake,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Indeed. The most plausible and logical, evidence based explanation for the dramatic rise in company stock
price is simply because other funds observed Adage's stake and were piling in.


Advaxis is an old company mostly retail held. With extremely low float. Consequently, every attempt to
acquire shares by funds would have caused SP to dramatically rise.


Evidence of this is rationally inferred by observing over 10x sustained daily volume, importantly, starting from
the day Adage stake was disclosed.

Richard Pearson appears to me as something of a misanthrope. He makes his " living" secretly accumulating short
positions in developmental stage companies whose stocks have risen dramatically and then publishing everything he
can conjure valid or otherwise to assassinate said enterprise, it's management and employees and it's shareholders. I
would make some points. Moore now has absolutely nothing to do with the company. Dan O'Connor who was brought
in in 2012 to run it is a former USMC captain who served in the Persian Gulf. He has a law degree, highly successful
body of work positioning Herbitux as a blockbuster oncology product and ImClone as a buyout candidate. At the risk
of sounding corny, he's the kinda guy I would want my daughter to marry- ethical and stand-up and hard working
beyond reproach. David Mauro is one the leading oncology checkpoint inhibitor scientists in the world. The rest of the
team from COO to CFO to VP regulatory affairs are accomplished and highly respected in the biotech/pharma space.
There is a learning curve here both in trials and business execution. Immune therapies work best in more treatment
naive patients- those who have received heavy doses of cytotoxics and radiation tend to be more compromised and
less able to mount meaningful immune responses; the emphasis now is on the combination of immune activators and
check point inhibitors in earlier stage patients, and the FDA is continuing to validate this approach for Advaxis with
SPA's and ODS's. Dream Team IR means nothing one way or the other. O'Connor started from scratch- no money, no
stock following, no nothing and sometimes the IR people can help w a kickstart to live to fight another day. Now that

John I completely agree with you about Pearson. I no nothing about this company or the story but I do know
how talented Pearson is at destroying a stock once he has it in his sights. I would suggest moving on.


Who could blame the company for hiring the dream team if they did do just that. The company has opponents
such as Pearson attempting to destroy their stocks share price on a regular basis. Twisting facts, creating
rumors and creating negative sentiment in any way he can while the companies hands are tied while their
products are going through testing for several years.


Advaxis can not push back by hiring a company to combat the negative articles and promote their company?


Like I said before, I do not know the story or the company very well but I do know how Pearson operates. He
makes a living doing this to companies as John previously stated. Then when a company tries to combat his
tactics by hiring a firm to write positive pieces he rats them out. Bottom line is the man is a rat.

22 Jan 2015, 10:15 AM


Justice Green
This comment is with regards to the Author's accusation that Advaxis share price has been artificially elevated
due to promotional activity by the Dream Team:


Author states that quadrupling is clearly not due to “some major clinical progress”, but “simply” due to “heavy
promotion”. Objective Analysis of the stock price history reveals it languished until December 2014. Only after
Adage's large purchase was revealed towards the end of trading day on December 19, 2014 did the stock
price start increasing rapidly. The fact is the stock price languished at an all time low for the entire 2 years
preceding this event. This is the time period that the author alleges the Dream Team was employed to hype
up and promote the stock! This strongly implies there was no elevating of the stock by Dream Team
promotional activities, in 2013 and 2014, as the author alleges.


On the contrary, the stock price elevation occurred immediate during the Adage announcement and
thereafter. The immediate increase in volume after the Adage announcement late Friday Dec 19 never
abated. On Monday December 22, volume increased sharply to 4 million shares traded. From that day
onwards, average daily volume has been clearly sustainably higher than previous weeks/months before
Adage. With an average volume ranging from 1-3 million shares, almost 10x the normal trading volume
before Adage, this is highly indicative of institutional buying, not retail buyers being duped by Dream Team.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 25/48


Furthermore, as Advaxis is an old company, with retail owners approximating 89% (per Yahoo), the share
price increase can be rationally explained by a mismatch in demand versus supply. 89% retail holders who
have held on for years, past a reverse split, many of whom have a pre-split basis in the $20s, versus a
sudden in-swell of institutions wanting in after seeing Adage. This is the far more likely explanation of the
unabating share price increase beginning December 19.


The author failed to mention this highly possible explanation, yet makes an unsubstantiable claim that the
stock has been hyped up by the Dream Team Group. The temporal association of the Adage announcement
with the subsequent sustained average daily volume offers a strong refutation to his general insinuation that
the stock price is sustained by Dream Team stock promotion.

A phase 3 study different from a phase 2 study that took place in a country with a poor record of reproducibility in
clinical trials. Let me guess, the next step will be that "patients are living longer than expected"....


I've seen this movie before (looking at you, TRGT, CLSN, ONTY, VICL, SNSS, NVLT, ZIOP, GNVC).


21 Jan 2015, 01:08 PM


Justice Green
The Phase 3 trial for Cervical cancer is run by GOG Foundation. The GOG Foundation is an international
non-profit held in highest regard for promoting excellence in research and treatment of gynecological cancers.
The fact that GOG reviewers would even ALLOW a Phase 3 trial implies that after reviewing the science and
the data, they see strong rationale for running such a trial.


This is the most probable and logical explanation for the direct move to Phase 3 without a ADXS-HPV-only
arm. Instead, the author insinuates the company embarked on a “questionable decision” to go ahead with a
phase 3 trial, “using an entirely different study design” (from the Phase 2), such that investors “cannot even
guess what the results might be”. He uses strong words in calling this “pure nonsense”. He implies Advaxis is
doing this for the purpose of pumping up the share price to raise money (in the section “Using some common
sense on clinical trials”).


This is irresponsible and just plain wrong. Firstly, GOG would not allow such a trial if they did not think there
was good supporting data and scientific rationale. GOG’s reputation and high standards of scientific
excellence preclude this.


Secondly, The “change” in trial design, namely, lacking an ADXS-HPV-only arm which the India Phase 2 trial
had, has a completely valid reason behind it. He fails to convey the company-stated reason. The company is
pivoting to focus on earlier stage treatment. This is publicly stated in Jan 7, 2015 press release which quotes
CMO Dr. Mauro as follows: “By evaluating ADXS-HPV in this high-risk, locally advanced setting early in the
onset of the disease, we believe there is a greater potential to impact the course of early stage cervical
cancer and survival of the patient”.

By focusing on earlier stage disease, the Phase 3 trial may have certain constraints. For example, it may be
determined by GOG that it would be unethical to subject patients to an ADXS-HPV-only arm. I do not claim to
understand the intricacies of clinical trial design. This is clearly something that is currently being negotiated
between the company and GOG. The point is that the author fails to represent these intricacies. Even before
the final detail of the trial are out, he irresponsibly labels it as being “pure nonsense”.

This article is a gross misrepresentation of the company, based on a completely flawed argument that tumor
shrinkage is in mm. In actuality, SEC filings clearly show tumor shrinkage is reported by Advaxis in
percentage. Ditto for the official PDFs on company website.


Don't know where Pearson got the slide from. But he's obviously failed to do proper due diligence to reconcile
with official SEC filings before directly accusing the company of misleading investors. This flawed assumption
completely renders all potential investigations/lawsuits dead on arrival.


Readers please beware Pearson's article is grossly misrepresenting the company. Kindly see comprehensive

Shallum Furbush, Contributor
hess, you are correct in your assessment of ONCS, their recent presentation more than proves that. However
keep in mind that ADXS is further along in development, and does have some advantages. Ultimately the
approach being used by ONCS will likely surpass ADXS, however it is a good idea to be hedging your
investments with ADXS and ZIOP in the oncology field. I suspect that ONCS will perform far better in the 2-5
year time frame, but that does not mean that looking at other options is bad.

If ADXS is indeed guilty of manipulating the price of their stock upwards, then Mr. Pearson, who holds a short interest

You are vastly more informed about these matters than I am, yet I wonder why you are spending your time
defending Advaxis when I see that comments you have made a little over a month ago have claimed that
$oncs has shown a 100% regression in a certain mice trial vs a 20% regression in another mice trial
performed by $adxs?


22 Jan 2015, 12:50 AM


Justice Green
Astute comment. I had meant to follow that up after Christmas but forgot. The 100% regression certain mice
was of directly injected / treated tumors, not systemic disease. This has always been consistent with ONCS
extremely high rate of causing directly injected tumors (including in humans) to regress. ONCS did not seem
to provide any mice data on the systemic tumors.


22 Jan 2015, 02:14 AM


Shallum Furbush, Contributor
Justice, 1 out of 5 mice had a 100% systemic response, the other 4 had no response which apparently was a
result of adaptive resistance by the tumor. ONCS believes this further supports their theory to combine with
PD-1.

Thank you for the information Fur. Seems like it is comparable to ADXS systemic response then. Interesting.


22 Jan 2015, 05:52 PM


Shallum Furbush, Contributor
Justice, you are most welcome. And you are correct that it is similar, IMO, superior in systemic response, it
just happens to be a little further behind in development. And before anyone gets offended about my
"superior" comment, let me add that ONCS will most likely not be a direct competitor in many of the areas that
ADXS is treating. So the fact that it is a superior immune response does not mean it is a superior treatment
for all cancers, or that it is a better investment. Just something to look at. Anyone that has any interest in
learning more about Immunotherapy, there is an outstanding 6 part video (first 3 are generic, vid 4 is about
PD-1, and the last 2 are ONCS specific) on ONCS homepage. http://www.oncosec.com, well worth the hour
to learn some new things.

This "author" doesn't even have any clue that the prior data that he attempts to analyze is irrelevant. That was for
ADXS's vaccine used alone (monotherapy). The entire reason the stock has taken off recently is that its vaccine
provides stellar results when used in combination therapy with Merck's anti-PD1 drugs, with less side effects than the
current first line treatment, i.e., Car-T! Duh! He doesn't know the first thing about what he attempted to write about.
For a complete, factual annihilation of every point in Pearson's article, read the rebuttal by Justice Green (see his
link). I dare anybody to read the rebuttal and then say with a straight face that it is not 100% accurate.


21 Jan 2015, 11:56 PM


OdysseustheGreek
I will say as someone who has watched this author work for a couple of years now he is very good at what he does.


He follows stocks that have experienced big run ups and large retail ownership and then comes the article using a
combination of old and outdated information mixed with current information to portray a story that isn't really
accurate...or at best is misleading.


Interestingly enough this "analysis" is almost always accompanied by major Put activity beforehand...almost like
somebody knows this article is coming out in advance. And then of course, this is followed by announcements of
lawsuits by ambulance chaser attorneys.


This short operation run against ADXS was hugely successful for the author and his friends. They are like a well oiled
machine when they run these attacks. It should have a name, like the Pearson Playbook or something.


In my experience if ADXS is a real company, with real potential it will eventually recover and will thrive, as have other
targets of Pearson in the past that were legitimate.

SEC filings, as well as the current Corporate Presentation on the website CLEARLY SHOW REGRESSION
IN PERCENTAGE!


He then goes on to literally accuse ADXS of jumping to Phase 3 trial (with GOG), insinuating that many
companies do this mainly to pump up the stock price to raise money. He fails to report that GOG is a highly
prestigious and reputable body, with high standards of scientific excellence. GOG simply would not allow
Advaxis to jump to a Phase 3 unless they saw compelling data or scientific evidence.

INDs provide important feedback to investors, allowing us to track the direction and speed at which
management is moving. The rapid rate of IND acceptances by the FDA for Advaxis combination PD1 trials
clearly reveal that the direction where management is taking this company (namely combination PD1 trials).


Secondly, it reveals adeptness of management at working through the regulatory process. It also serves as an
initial filter to tell investors that the combination strategy of LmLLO + PD1 satisfies FDA requirements to

Hmmm. I bought a chunk of these guys about 8 or 9 months ago. The stuff I read sounded incredibly promising. Then
they partnered with Merck and Astrazenica. Looked even better.


I haven't even bothered to check on them or read anything else about them for many months. I did enjoy watching the
stock take off.


And, one of these days, I'm going to remember to do stop-loss orders in advance-- that would have added an extra
100% on top of the 300% or so I made, or whatever it was. It's gotta beat glancing at the portfolio toward the end of
the pay, practically pissing your pants, then hastily selling.


But, I did sell every single share of ADXS I had and that I had bought for my wife.


This tells me ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING I need to know about this company:


"ADXS


: QS, an affiliate of DreamTeamGroup, received$45,000 from ADXS for 315 days of advertising, branding,marketing,
investor relations and social media servicesprovided by QS."


You only have credibility once. This thoroughly and completely kills every single bit of credibility they had: And that
dead, foul, decayed credibility ain't coming back to life either.


I now don't care if their platforms are genuine world beaters: Even if that is the case, they have proved themselves to
be lower than bottom slime in a trailer-park cesspool.


And I don't touch cesspool bottom slime, much less own it.


I am, however, going to investigate this a little bit more closely. It doesn't seem like rolling in the bottom of the
cesspool is something that one could reasonably believe is in the best interest of the shareholders.


ADXS, now that is another story entirely. Personally, i was kind of expecting them to work on their drugs and
platforms.

The Merck and AZN deals are hardly true partnerships as the rest of the pharma world knows them. These
are no-money-down, no-risk moonshots for MRK and AZN.


TRUE partnerships imply real cost sharing at the very least. The most promising biotechs get huge upfront
cash injections and sometimes the entire costs of development are borne by the big partner. In the case of
ADXS all you have are bs combo agreements where the big firms are merely contributing some drugs.


It is as if you went to the Doctor's office, got a free sample of Bayer Aspirin and put out a press release
screaming about your "partnership" with Bayer in a fever trial. Hype and nonsense. Nothing substantive. At

Before I bought it, I read everything I could find about the company, their platform and its potential, including a

TimeOnTarget,


Have you had a chance to read the point by point rebuttal of Pearson's article?  
http://tinyurl.com/k2w...


There is a very strong bull case. Furthermore, Pearson's article is COMPLETELY flawed. The crux of his
argument that the company uses MM instead of Percentage is based off an old slide that had a typo. The
official filings with SEC clearly show regression is in percentage.


This also jives with the soft facts - ADXS' cmo David Mauro recently jumped ship from Merck in Oct. He had a
highly important role evaluating combination PD1 therapies at Merck as the Executive Director, Section head
of Oncology Clinical Development. Surely he was fully qualified to evaluate the data.


On top of that, Merck and Astra both decided to go ahead with combo PD1 with Advaxis. Surely they
evaluated the data as well.


Anyway, the fact is Pearson's entire crux is COMPLETELY flawed. Importantly, all the legal investigations
initiated are explicitly stated to be based off this SA article!! As such, those investigations will be dropped
instantly and will never proceed to become lawsuits. There simply is no case!


Pearson has done a great injustice and literally slandered the company falsely, either mistakenly, or else
because he failed to do proper due diligence.

@Justice Green --


Thank you. Not only will I read it, I look forward to doing it.


But, regardless of the merits of the platform, I don't see how I could ever knowingly invest in a company that would
employ a company that is compensated for writing "promotional" material.


To begin with, I don't like companies that pay too much attention to share price. When I see CEOs doing stuff that
involves more than a very occasional investor presentation, I get leery.


I get especially leery with biotech: The sector seems rife with fraud and BS to begin with. Then, when you have a
company that is paying for stock "promotion" via articles, that hits just about every warning bell I have. It virtually
screams to me that the officers and directors are far more concerned with enriching themselves through short-term
share price appreciation than they are with their long-term credibility, developing the platform, and growing the
company.


That said, I do look forward to reading your article.

@TimeonTarget, understood your frustration with the Dream Team mention. However, a company has a right
to hire a PR firm to do promoting. Where there is a problem is when they do so to pump the share price so
that the BOD can dump huge piles of shares on the public. In contrast, ADXS BOD just filed documents with
the SEC indicating that they want to buy shares at market on the last day of the month for I believe the next
12 months. If the BOD is making a commitment to buy, then obviously the past use (not current) of a PR firm
is really not the red flag some make it out to be. I hope you give Justice's rebuttal the read it deserves. It
really is well researched and outlines the case for the company far better than Mr. Pearson's piece does.

I absolutely will. I was very intrigued with their approach, which seems incredibly smart on a number of levels.


I've previously been in a position where I hired communications consultants for issues. I don't have a problem
generally with hiring people for PR, communications, etc.


Having watched how "promotion" is frequently done by these types of companies and the examples in this
case in particular, however, I do have a fundamental problem with it. No real value is added by this type of
promotion. The absolute best that can be said for it is the lack of judgement and ethics is appalling.

Also, this type of behavior is inherently risky. Huge risks are involved. If they genuinely believe in their
platform and future prospects, why in the world would they take such a needless and profound risk? I look at
it like being willing to bet the company for a short-term price bump.


Something is fundamentally different than what I assumed since that happened. Either the company and its
intellectual property isn't nearly as good as I thought or the judgement of the people running the company is
far worse than I would have imagined in my wildest dreams. In either case, it is a pretty strong message.

I would be willing to bet that the PR firm was hired before they decided to go into combinations. The data for
their mono-therapies are not as promising as is needed now days. Immunotherapy has progressed quite a bit.
Honestly ADXS has an excellent chance of phenomenal results with Keytruda in some hard to treat cancers. I
wouldn't waste my time investing in them if they were a mono-therapy focused company. I do think the price
ran up to fast, but it has dropped to a better PPS for now. I'd expect that when data is released the current
price will prove to be an excellent buy in. Though $4 in Dec was the ideal

Pearson's article is fundamentally flawed! He builds the crux of his accusation based on the flawed idea that

I am shocked that David Mauro left his Chief Oncology development position at Merck to join Advaxis. Didn't he know

indication. Dummies! Not to mention that GOG--the most prestigious cancer research consortium on the planet--fell
for it too, by recently agreeing to conduct clinical trials for ADXS. Thank God we now have a noted oncology expert

yet he failed to perform due diligence before publishing this grave accusation on a widely read publication.


As a consequence of his publication, 6 law firms promptly declared they were opening legal investigations
into the company misleading investors. Undoubtedly, these ominous declarations not only caused panicky
investors to sell during the ensuing stock price plunge, but also drew in unsuspecting momentum shorts who
assumed that the legal investigations had any sort of validity.


The reality is each of those declarations of investigation stated they were based on the author's SeekingAlpha
article. Consequently, Advaxis stock violently dropped 40% in 2 days. This is an extremely serious situation.

Re. the mm vs % debate.


The chart published on this site by the author was clearly in %. All one has to do is look closely on the responding
patients. They are labeled with PR or CR, and the CR being those with 100% reductions.


It is simply impossible for anybody with a knowledge of this space to look at this graph and not immediately realize it
is % despite the incorrect label on the Y axis.


I have no idea if the problem here was lack of understanding by the author, or an intent to deceive. But neither speaks
well for the piece.

Precisely. Furthermore, his use of 1,500mm as a base tumor size is insane. That would be a 5 foot tumor!


Even if those 100mm regressions were not labeled as CRs in his plot, such regressions would be significant
(about 4 inches regression). A clear indication of vaccine efficacy.

Tragedy #2 
Momentum retail shorts who dived in, seeing only the headlines of "legal investigations", with no time to understand

A great injustice has been done by the author's libelous piece. Advaxis shareholders have filed SEC and DA

Ignatiuscheung,


I don't think the ADXS management will waste time on such an article by someone who obviously knows little
about the company. They undoubtedly have their hands full positioning the company with the multiple clinical
trials & collaborations, which they are rapidly hammering out, especially after Dr. Mauro came aboard just this
past October.


(Bear in mind they are a young company with small number of staff, hence zero time to waste on this
garbage). They'd probably let the "media" self-regulate itself (Adam F article http://tinyurl.com/l4e...)


Instead, the parties hurt by this article would be long time shareholders who would have been hurt by panic
selling. Also some momentum shorts who based their action on the sensational headlines of misleading
investors & subsequent legal investigations. It would be up to these parties to follow through with the reports
that have been filed with the DA & SEC.

I disagree. The company should have come out and clarify in order to protect the investors(be it short or long
