Sphere 3D: Rewarded For A Shotgun Wedding That's Doomed To
Backfire?

by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


A bleeding rollup company with no established technology of its own, Sphere 3D has
nevertheless transformed itself from a lowly penny stock into a double-digit highflier.


Despite its paltry revenue and its ongoing losses, Sphere 3D has offered a fortune to
merge with yet another company incapable of supporting itself.


With both Sphere 3D and its desperate mate dragging so much baggage into their
proposed union, the company’s stock could easily crash before that celebrated
merger even takes place.


Maybe Sphere 3D (NASDAQ:ANY) finds some way to look busy if it actually expects
company. The bleeding technology firm seemed almost lifeless when TheStreetSweeper
paid a surprise visit to its Canadian headquarters on a recent weekday, however, arriving
fairly late in the morning to find the executive suite empty and just a tiny handful of
underlings inside the entire facility.


With little (if any) sign of real business activity, Sphere 3D looked nothing like a $250
million corporation that had just offered a fortune to merge with a far more established –
but increasingly desperate – company by using its highflying stock as valuable currency.
Sphere 3D looked nothing like a $250 million corporation, especially one that had just
offered a fortune to merge with Overland Storage (Nasdaq: OVRL) -- a far more
established, but increasingly desperate, company -- by using its highflying stock as
valuable currency.


No telephone calls to answer from patient customers eagerly awaiting the overdue
Glassware 2.0 “virtualization” platform that Sphere 3D has trumpeted as a revolutionary
breakthrough – set to take the challenging market by storm -- for years. No meetings to
orchestrate with important clients seeking to order the V3 storage solution that Sphere 3D
inherited from a dinky firm accused of blatantly stealing its assets before it officially
changed hands. No appointments to keep with hopeful investors willing to place risky bets
on Sphere 3D, either, especially now that the bleeding rollup companytrades at a
staggering 250 times its prior-year pro forma sales.

Talk about a joke.


How on earth did Sphere 3D – a glorified rollup companythat, until last summer, traded for
mere pocket change – ever manage to escape from penny-stock territory in the first
place? Moreover, what made Sphere 3D now believe that it could pull off an $80 million
merger with Overland Storage (Nasdaq: OVRL) – a fragile, but legitimate, company also
incapable of supporting itself – and somehow transform the combined entity into an
outright success?


Take a careful look at that pair.


A bleeding technology firm that relies on others to cover its expensive shopping habit,
Sphere 3D has nevertheless managed to present itself as the unlikely savior in this cozy
relationship. Despite the steep price tag attached to its all-stock merger offer, however,
Sphere 3D actually looks more like a freeloader with clever designs on a vulnerable
partner too blinded by conflict to acknowledge the truth. While Overland Storage arguably
stands out as the far superior catch – with its prior-year sales topping $50 million, its
employee count approaching 200 and its stock already trading on the prestigious Nasdaq
exchange – both the company and its CEO accepted so much stock from Sphere 3D
ahead of its merger offer that their loyalties appear somewhat divided, to state the
obvious.


Granted, without that well-timed proposal, Overland might have chosen to look out for
itself by taking advantage of its lucky suitor instead. When Overland prepared its latest
quarterly report, after all, the company pointed directly at its tempting multimillion-dollar
stake in Sphere 3D – a thinly traded Canadian stock bound to collapse under heavy
selling pressure – as the largest source of its future liquidity. The same day that Overland
officially filed that revealing 10Q, however, the two companies suddenly announced their
big wedding plans.


Talk about averting a potential disaster. Just imagine the brutal plunge that Sphere 3D
might have suffered if Overland and/or its CEO – who scored enough cheap options to
secure an even more valuable stake in the company when he agreed to double as the
chairman of its board – even tried to cash in millions of dollars worth of the former penny
stock in spite of its limited trading volume.


No wonder Cyrus Capital decided to intervene. As an influential backer of both
companies, with a majority interest in Overland Storage itself, Cyrus faced a relatively
simple choice: Help facilitate a marriage between the pair, conveniently boosting the value

of both investments in the meantime, or test its luck by waiting to see if those bleeding
firms could find some way to work things out and finally make it on their own.


So what if the marriage ultimately failed? Cyrus specializes in making a fortune on
“distressed” companies that run out of luck all the time. In fact, Cyrus actually secured its
controlling interest in Overland Storage by selling it another ill-fated firm that it inherited
after that company blew through its limited resources and wound up totally broke.


Still tempted to bet on that sort of fantasy, anyway? Keep on reading then. The sobering
evidence presented below paints such a disturbing picture of Sphere 3d – as a heavily
promoted company tarnished by allegations of theft, infidelity, failure and deceit – that it
might just change your mind.


Dysfunctional Family


Let’s start with pending litigation that basically aims to strip Sphere 3D of the current
source of its paltry revenue. That damaging lawsuit, which added Sphere 3D as a named
defendant after the company arranged to purchase V3 (the original target of the case)
earlier this year, states in pertinent part:


“V3 acquired Inaura’s trade secrets and intellectual property by improper means.
(Since then), all of the Inaura assets fraudulently transferred to V3 … have been, or
have recently been subjected to an agreement to be, transferred to Sphere and/or
Doe, a subsidiary of Sphere created to hold the fraudulently transferred assets.”


Meanwhile, “V3 utilized copyrighted materials, trademarks and/or trade dress, without any
license, in the promotion of its products and causing confusion in that it caused the public
to believe that the products it promoted were its own, when in truth and in fact, the origin
of all or parts of the products it sold were part of the assets looted from Inaura … All such
copyrighted materials and trademarks, trade names or trade dress are now being
misappropriated as part of the sale of all of V3’s assets to Sphere and/or Doe, such that
Sphere and/or Doe should be enjoined from any further use of the copyrighted materials
or misrepresentation of the origin of the Inaura assets sold as the products of, in whole or
in part, V3.”


Indeed, “Inaura is entitled to recover the intellectual property and all other assets of Inaura
that were fraudulently transferred to V3, to have a receiver appointed to take over all of
V3’s assets and business operations … and to have an injunction against all other
transfers. Inaura is also entitled to any damages that the transfer may have caused.”

Now let’s take a close look at one of the Sphere 3D directors who blessed the acquisition
of V3 despite pending litigation that portrayed its assets as stolen. The actual chairman of
Sphere 3D until last summer, when the CEO of Overland Storage assumed that important
(if conflicted) leadership role, Jason Meretsky previously served as a high-ranking
executive at Avid Life Media – the parent of a notorious adultery site, known as
AshleyMadison.com, that proudly trumpets itself as “the world’s leading infidelity service” –
and the CEO of a so-called “home-staging” firm that executed a rather controversial
acquisition of its own.


Check out some of the juicy details that Wikipedia has chosen to include in its official entry
on AshleyMadison.com:


“In December 2009, Ashley Madison attempted to purchase C$200,000 worth of
advertising on Toronto Transit Commission streetcars. The plan was rejected after
five of the six committee members voted against it. If approved, 10 streetcars would
have been skinned with Ashley Madison’s slogan: ‘Life is short. Have an affair.’ The
TTC commissioner showed displeasure in the ads, stating: ‘When it’s a core
fundamental value around cheating or lying, we’re not going to let those kinds of ads
go on … ‘


“On February 22, 2010, the company approached the city of Phoenix, Arizona, with
an offer of $10 million to rename the Sky Harbor Airport to Ashley Madison
International Airport for a five-year period. Even though the city was in financial
trouble, it rejected the offer …


“Trish McDermott, a consultant who helped found Match.com, accused Ashley
Madison of being a ‘business built on the back of broken hearts, ruined marriages
and damaged families.’ (The CEO) responded by stating that the site is ‘just a
platform’ and a website or a commercial will not CONVINCE anyone to commit
adultery …


“Unless they know how to opt out of the ‘Ashley’s Angels’ feature, the site’s Terms
and Conditions say that users who have not yet paid the site any money (‘guest
accounts’) may get computer-generated messages from fictitious profiles that ‘are
NOT conspicuously identified as such.’ These may cost money to respond to. The
site says this is ‘to provide entertainment.’”

An infamous home-staging companypurchased by a real estate firm that Meretsky once
led – despite its reputation as an outright scam – generated some rather unflattering
publicity, too. Both of the following posts (a media article and one of many customer
complaints) surfaced on the Internet less than two months before the acquisition of that
unpopular company took place.


Media coverage: “Who is behind Haverhill? The man behind the company is Darren
Morgenstern, a man who was pursued by the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) in 2001
for allegedly perpetrating a domain name scam … Morgenstern settled these charges in
2002, and the companies accused by the FTC paid $375,000 to compensate alleged
victims. He also agreed to be barred from making false or misleading statements in the
sale of goods or services related to domain names, email or web-hosting services. He’s
even barred from using unsolicited marketing faxes … The guy’s also got an interesting
past related to a website he started for people who want to cheat on their spouses. Read
up on that and judge for yourself … Haverhill says it’s ‘North America’s largest and fastest
growing home-staging company.’ Impressive? Maybe. True? Who really knows …”


Customer complaint: “Haverhill’s training program is quite simply a SCAM (a word
repeated dozens of times by other disgruntled customers describing their horrible
experience with the company). Every step is designed to fail you, and if you persist, they
just lie and change things so that they can deter you from finishing the program. I just got
fed up with their games and deceit. NOTHING about this ‘program’ is designed to teach
you or help you. If you want to learn anything, you might as well do it yourself, without a
$1,000 binder full of useless typo’d information … P.S., apparently this company was
started by a known con artist who has been in the news for other scams.”


With that in mind, go ahead and review some of the more jarring details included in an
investigative report on the actual leader of Sphere 3D himself. Packed with so much
disturbing evidence that it has already ballooned into a three-part series, that report
summarizes Sphere 3D Chief Executive Officer Peter Tassiopoulos with the following:

“Peter Tassiopoulos’ first forays in the public equity markets were not in the highest
quality of companies (they appear to be exclusively heavily promoted Bulletin Board
stocks) nor with the highest quality people (many have been convicted of securities
violations). Since 1995, Peter Tassiopoulos has been involved with stock promoters,
stock promotions, a bankrupt electronics manufacturer, a failed shell company, a
bankrupt healthcare technology company and a stock promotion and failed
technology company. He has misrepresented his past on several occasions and
repeatedly made big promises while failing to deliver actual results. (These) cases
suggest that Tassiopoulos was not a successful dealmaker or executive, in stark
contrast to how he portrays his past.”


Speaking of stock promoters, Sphere 3D sure has chosen a dubious “investor relations”
firm to publicize the company. Handsomely rewarded for its services with generous cash
payments and a pile of valuable stock options – now worth more than $2 millionfollowing a
dramatic explosion in the company’s share price -- USA Investor Link counts a pair of
documented troublemakers, one of them sanctioned by the Ontario Securities
Commission just a few short months ago, as the official leaders (and the only publicly
identified members) of its firm.


Let’s save the regulatory target for last and start with his partner Andy Almonte – arguably
the less alarming of the two despite his recent criminal charges – instead. The official
“BrokerCheck” report on Almonte, supplied by the National Association of Securites
Dealers and briefly summarized below, might give even bullish investors some reason for
pause.


Here are some of the more noteworthy details on that hired gun:


Employment History: John Thomas Financial (a notorious firm that made a name for itself
as a disreputable “boiler room” specializing in the promotion of worthless penny stocks),
August 2009 to July 2010; Unemployed, August 2010 to September 2011; Steve Madden
(a company taken public by the very firm that inspired “The Wolf of Wall Street”),
September 2011 to December 2012; USA Investor Link, December 2012 to September
2013; Unemployed, September 2013 to the present.


(Note: On its official website, USA Investor Link still showcases Almonte as one of the two
leaders who oversee the firm.)

Customer Dispute: “Client alleges 1) churning; 2) unsuitability; 3) failure to supervise; 4)
misrepresentation and omissions; 5) breach of fiduciary duty; 6) breach of contract; and 7)
negligence.”


Alleged Damages: $640,182.07


Settlement Amount: $310,000.00


Criminal charges: theft of services, trespassing


Plea: Guilty


Broker Statement: “On February 6th, 2014, I was on my way to pick up my daughter from
school, when I was arrested for attempting to enter the subway using her school Metro
card. My daughter is 6 years old, and I genuinely thought that, since she is too young to
pay for a fare of travel by herself, she was issued this Metro card to assist her parents in
transporting her to and from school. I did not have to pay any fines or penalties in this
case, and as the record states, (it) will be dismissed and sealed in August of 2014. This
was a very embarrassing event, from which I learned a very valuable lesson that will never
repeat itself again.”


Let’s hope that his partner, James Barnett (also known as John David), has finally learned
an important lesson, too. After all, Barnett allegedly spent the better part of a decade
violating securities laws by the time that Canadian regulators eventually nailed him for
breaking the rules. The following settlement agreement, negotiated between the Ontario
Securities Commission and Barnett on March 21, outlines his long history of misconduct
and his resulting punishment:

“During the period between 2002 and October 12, 2012, Barnett was a de facto
officer of MineralFields Management Inc. (‘MFMI’), Limited Market Dealer Inc.
(‘LMDI) and Pathway Investment Counsel Inc. (‘Pathway’), which comprised a group
of companies, the MineralFields Group. The MineralFields Group was involved in the
distribution and management of flow-through limited partnerships. These limited
partnerships invested primarily in flow-through shares of junior Canadian resource
issuers through private placement issues …


“During the compliance reviews, it was revealed that, commencing in 2002 and
continuing until 2011, there was a consistent failure to disclose in regulatory filings
with the Commission that Barnett had beneficial interest in 49.99% of the non-voting
shares of MFMI and LMDI since inception of these firms in 2002 and 2004,
respectively, until after the compliance reviews. Barnett had an understanding with
the individual who eventually became the Ultimate Designated Person (the ‘UDP’) of
the firms of the MineralFields Group that Barnett would have a 49.9% interest and
the UDP would have a 50.1% interest in the companies from the date each company
was incorporated …


“Barnett’s failure to disclose his ownership of non-voting shares constituted conduct
contrary to the public interest. (In addition), Barnett engaged in trading and advising
without registration … By engaging in the trading and advising activity without being
registered, Barnett acted contrary to Ontario securities laws …


“Barnett agrees to the terms of settlement listed below. The Commission will make
an order … that (among other things): Barnett resign from any position he holds as a
director of a registrant or as a chief executive officer, chief financial officer or chief
operating officer of a registrant or the functional equivalent of any of these positions;
Barnett shall be prohibited from becoming or acting as a registrant, a director of a
registrant or as an individual who has beneficial ownership of, or direct or indirect
control or direction over, 10% or more of the voting securities of a registered firm
until the later of a period of four years from the date of the approval of the settlement
agreement and the date on which Barnett successfully completes, in addition to any
applicable proficiency requirements, the Conduct and Practices Handbook Course
and, if seeking to become a director of a registered firm, until the later of a period of
four years from the date of the approval of the settlement agreement and the date on
which Barnett completes the Directors Education Program; subject to the satisfaction
of (those requirements), Barnett will be subject to strict supervision of a sponsoring
firm for a period of one year.”

$125,000 for breaching Ontario securities law by trading and advising without registration
to the Commission; (and) Barnett shall pay the costs of the Commission’s investigation in
the amount of $25,000 within 180 days of the approval of the settlement agreement. For

payment of $75,000 …


“By engaging in the conduct described above, Barnett admits and acknowledges
that he contravened Ontario securities laws by trading and advising without being
registered and acted contrary to the public interest.”


Wow. Sphere 3D should probably make sure that it introduces Overland Storage all of the
"colorful" members of its extended family. If Sphere 3D still looks attractive to its desperate
mate even after that happens, then maybe those two companies really do deserve one
another – and their shaky fate – after all.


* Important Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this report, the owners of
TheStreetSweeper established a short position in both Sphere 3D (ANY.V) and Overland
Storage (OVRL), and they stand to profit on any future declines in their respective share

To the SA readers, look at the SP movement and desperation of the short articles. Notice that SP only has gone up
since confirmed shorts at SS tried to bring the stock down. Nobody is selling, and nobody is dumping the stock.
Company is legitimate and growing.


SS is full of ex-convicts and liars. Please do your DD on them and understand that they are paid to bash companies.
With Sphere 3d, it does not work. SP has only gone up after every article SS published. Make your conclusions.

Again another act of desperation to act on behalf of the short group out of Toronto. you are running out of rope.

StreetSweeper is starting to sound desperate. Notice that the last five short plays by Streetsweeper are ALL losers.


Note also that this company is founded by convicted stock swindlers. See http://bit.ly/1lU4Hmp


Shorts are getting killed on Sphere 3D.

You need to check your facts as this US INvestro Link IR relationship was terminated without any options at all. Since
you didn't mention how much they were paid in cash payments may be you could include that amount as part of your
research. Looking forward to hearing your answer. I will also post your bio again so eberyone can see who you really
are and what your agenda is. You stated the following.


Speaking of stock promoters, Sphere 3D sure has chosen a dubious “investor relations” firm to publicize the
company. Handsomely rewarded for its services with generous cash payments and a pile of valuable stock options –
now worth more than $2 millionfollowing a dramatic explosion in the company’s share price -- USA Investor Link
counts a pair of documented troublemakers, one of them sanctioned by the Ontario Securities Commission just a few
short months ago, as the official leaders (and the only publicly identified members) of its firm.

We love your looney toon attempts to make fanciful stories to try to bash SPIHF, yet every time you do you the stock
seems to go up.


You need to realize that the bulk of this stock is in strong long hands that see through your charade. So bash at will
and short at will but you are now at least $6 underwater with your short and have no hope of ever covering in the
cheap.


Give up the ghost do not write more stories and cover or wait until they announce a Google p-ship and more
Chromebook deals and bit-torrent p2p growth.


See you at $30.

Why doesn't this author even mention Dell, DRIVE, Ericsson, Novarad (and NovaGlass), or Chesterfield County
Public Schools? One would think that a minimally competent assessment of Sphere3D would at least mention the
most recent deals and major-name validations relevant to Sphere3D. Perhaps we should understand these omissions
as evidence of not even minimal competence on the part of the author's work here; or perhaps instead we should
conclude something a bit less...honorable about her motives?

Dell, Ericsson, Novarad w/Novaglass (healthcare vertical), Dell Chromebooks with Google Chrome OS
utilizing Sphere's glassware 2.0 - together wins Chesterfield County Public Schools contract for 32,000

92,000 shares of ANY.

Sheldon's company has a stock price of 48 cents, that's pennies not dollars. He is far from the genius you
say. But what you don't say is more important. You knock a short sellers article filled with statements you have
no intellectual response to. Your responses are all emotional and do not contain a single fact because its all
wishful thinking. Look at the numbers. Revenues for Sphere are not consistent with their self serving PR
controlled releases. Follow the numbers and address those only. The revenues do not reflect the PR or do
they?. Why is that? Try to honestly answer that question if you had no investment in this company and were
looking at it with a fresh unbiased position. You are doing no different than the short seller so don't criticize
them. You by your statements are just trying to increase the price. They are setting up facts to decrease it so
what's the difference. The difference is the truth. A real man/woman responds with facts. You respond with
emotions. Explain why revenues do not reflect the PR you parrot. That's all your answer should address but I
bet you can't stay on point.

So whats your position here?

ZERO position. I am looking for some intelligent conversation but I see no one has anything intellectual to
respond which means only one thing.


11 Jul 2014, 08:25 AM


macnqueso
you say you are looking for intelligent conversation... then why haven't you responded to the comments that
have offered intelligent rebuttal... i have a suggestion let's start with these highly material developments... why
didn't the author of this article address the following:


ANY technology added to DELL Drive = strong affirmation of technology


ANY technology + Novarad = NovGlass = entry into healthcare vertical


NovaGlass early adoption in large hospital system


Ericsson = industry leader adds ANY technology

Dell Chromebooks + Google Chrome OS + Any technology = contract with Chestefield County Public Schools
(32K units)


Chesterfield County Public Schools known as a first mover in education = entry into education vertical


These are real events. Their reporting includes commentary from the partnering organizations. This is strong
validation of technology from well renowned industry leaders. If you want intelligent conversation, why not
start with these.

Sheldon owns the float and the shorts know it will take two months for them to cover. They have a better chance of
getting hit by lightening than covering under $20 +, this is going to be epic, they may even put it to song or use as a
Harvard Business School case as what not to do when going short.
