AMD confirms CTS vulnerabilities, downplaying to avoid the 
financial implications. 
Discoveries by CTS Labs’ research into AMD flaws eliminate AMD’s competitive advantage in enterprise server 


segments and the company’s price competitiveness in retail aspects can no longer be justified.  


The company’s rhetoric is that this is a non-issue hinges on the non-argument that administrator access must 


be established in order to exploit the vulnerabilities identified by CTS. This is short-sighted as the surrounding 


statement that most hackers will not have the know-how to exploit these vulnerabilities.  


As detailed by CTS1:  


“Attackers think of machines not as individual nodes but as part of a network. Gaining local 


administrative access on a compromised computer inside an organization is easy for attackers. The 


challenge is moving laterally from there to other machines and maintaining access for the future. That 


is exactly what these vulnerabilities provide.” 


CTS have recently released a video showing the exploitation of AMD’s vulnerabilities to completely circumvent 


Windows Credential Guard and obtain decrypted passwords. AMD management specifically highlighted 


Windows Credential Guard as a key obstacle to the execution of CTS Labs’ identified exploits. 


The video can be viewed in full here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQaWIWbzhI&feature=youtu.be  


Viceroy believes the practice of giving AMD discretion as to when, if and how it reports its own vulnerabilities 


facilitates poor corporate disclosure and keeps stakeholders in the dark. This is not how free financial markets 


operate for a reason and is validated by the SEC's most recent statement2 relating to cybersecurity flaws: we 


would similarly not give fraudulent companies the discretion as to if and when they inform their investors they 


are a fraud.  


▪ Ryzen and Epyc processors facilitate tremendous freedom of access to customer’s data –The identified 


vulnerabilities in AMD’s EPYC and Ryzen processors give hackers the ability to entrench malware at the 


hardware level, making them virtually undetectable and untouchable by security products. By abusing 


these vulnerabilities at the Secure Processor level, malware characteristics can give hackers unlimited 


control over entire networks. None of the vulnerabilities identified by CTS, both firmware and hardware, 


require physical access to computers to be exploited. The continued sale of these processors puts customers 


at significant risk.  


▪ The security protocols that AMD have been promoting put customers at unacceptable risk to 


vulnerabilities identified by CTS – We expect AMD cloud customers including Microsoft Azure, Baidu, 


DellEMC and TenCent will flee in the short term given the serious nature of chip flaws. AMD is unlikely to 


be trusted in this space again.  


▪ One Ryzen chip could endanger an entire enterprise network – Vulnerabilities identified in the Ryzen chip 


allow hackers to perform credential dumps on infected Ryzen workstations even if the latest security 


mitigations are employed. Malware can quickly spread to other workstations throughout enterprise 


networks, regardless of whether they use a Ryzen chip or Intel. No prudent CISO or CTO will risk their 


network or their security by buying a Ryzen chip over more secure competitors. 


This report expands on the financial impact of the CTS Labs vulnerabilities, specifically the impact of future 


earnings and possible legal liabilities that Viceroy believes will arise against the company. Viceroy have 


appointed lawyers to assess the reliability of the security claims made by AMD considering the basic level flaws 


that have been identified.

Projected loss of Revenues 
AMD has two reporting segments related to its products: Computer and Graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded 


and Semi-Custom.  


 
Figure 1 Extract of AMD 2017 Annual Report 


AMD has been historically reluctant to provide further detail on revenues and growth of particular products or 


product categories within these segments. As such Viceroy and other analysts have had to make educated 


guesses of the composition and performance of particular products, for example, GPUs. 


The product lines affected by the vulnerabilities of CTS labs are spread throughout these two operating 


segments.  


Revenues derived from Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment 
We believe that revenues from AMD’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments will fall at least 88% 


based on the heavy concentration of the segment’s sales on two customers.  


The extent of the vulnerabilities and the difficulty and impracticality of patches we believe make the products 


unpurchaseable at a commercial level. Any competent Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief 


Technology Officer (CTO) would not willingly subject their businesses to unnecessary risk. That is their job.  


The sellside currently value AMD on either a sale/EV or future earnings multiple basis. The loss of this service 


line would make future earnings unattainable for the foreseeable future. 


According to AMD’s 2017 annual report, the company’s two top customers made up 38% of revenue and 


consisted of products in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments.  


 
Figure 2 Extract of AMD 2017 Annual Report 


This figure amounts to roughly US$2.025B, and represents ~88% of the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 


segment’s revenue.
Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 3 Extract of AMD 2017 Annual Report 


While further details are undisclosed, the nature of the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment 


products suggests customers A and B are at a significant risk from the vulnerabilities disclosed by CTS Labs. 


Accordingly we expect them to discontinue business with the company given the many alternatives available on 


the market, resulting in the segment’s revenue falling by at least 88%.  


On a Sales/EV multiple of 2.71 (based on sell side consensus target price per Bloomberg 


Terminal), the loss of 88% of this segment line represents a 27% downside from the 


current price. 


Revenues derived from Computing and Graphics 
We make a preliminary note that AMD’s Computing and Graphics segment reporting line acts as a “catch-all” 


between products with very separate markets, making it extremely difficult for stakeholders to gauge actual 


business unit performance of the segments affected by the CTS Labs vulnerabilities.  


Sales in this segment include: 


▪ GPUs - We expect flat/negative growth from GPU sales as cryptocurrency miners substantially transition 


from GPUs to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are designed to mine far more 


efficiently. Major ASIC players such as Bitmain are speculated to release Etherium ASIC hardware later this 


year and Samsung has also confirmed its intention to enter the cryptocurrency mining space3.   


Readers should note that AMD management have refused to corroborate or comment on analyst questions 


regarding GPU sales as a percentage of the Computing and Graphics segment, in particular cryptocurrency 


related GPU sales. 


 
Figure 4 Extract from CNBC.com article “AMD shares to surge on its cloud computing chip share gains: Analyst”4 


However, AMD CEO Lisa Su claimed in the company’s’ Q4 2017 earnings call that an estimated 33% of the 


year’s growth in the Computing and Graphic segment was attributable to cryptocurrency gains.

Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 5 Extract from SeekingAlpha.com transcript of AMD Q4 2017 Earnings Call 5 


Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland claimed that the remaining GPU sales were being used 95% of the 


time for cryptocurrency mining. 


 
Figure 6 Extract of Barron’s article “AMD, Nvidia: Risk from ‘Gamers’ Who Are Really Coin Miners, Says Susquehanna”6 


Conservative, we expect GPUs to consist of ~40% of AMD’s Computing and Graphics revenue and for GPU 


revenue to remain flat as their prices stabilizes due to cryptocurrency miners transition into ASICs. 


▪ Desktop and notebook processors and chipsets – We expect AMD’s inclusion in retail desktops and 


notebooks to end imminently, notably with HP and Dell. We believe the flaws identified by CTS eliminate 


any the benefit of price competitiveness as manufacturers will look to protect their interests. 


Accordingly, we expect a combination of flat or declining GPU revenues and a complete end to desktop and 


notebook processor revenues. We believe that a 60% short term decline in AMD’s Computing and Graphics 


segment revenues is warranted. 





Collectively, the loss of Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment line and 60% 


of Computing and Graphics revenues represents a 65% downside from the current price 


on a Sales/EV multiple of 2.71 (based on sell side consensus target price per Bloomberg 


Terminal). 


At this stage, AMD would also be bleeding cash.

Figure 7 Viceroy AMD valuation analysis 


Liabilities arising from vulnerabilities 
We believe the financial liabilities detailed in the section below will arise as a result of the vulnerabilities CTS 


exposed and erode AMD’s residual value.  


AMD faces a raft of potential lawsuits, a reality of competitor Intel after the release of the Meltdown and Spectre 


exploits. Reuters reported on February 17, 2018 that Intel was facing 32 lawsuits from both customers and 


shareholders: the city of Providence allegedly filed a lawsuit for US$5B7.  


Viceroy believes that in light of the vulnerabilities brought forward by CTS Labs, AMD will face a similar 


predicament. While the speed and quality of the company’s response are mitigating factors, we believe that 


previous events highlight how the company may not react quickly enough to appease customers. 


AMD recently struggled to patch an fTPM flaw identified by google cloud security team member Cfir Cohen. 


Despite the vulnerability being reported to AMD in September 2017, a spokesperson for AMD claimed that a 


patch would only be available in January 2018, after the existence of the vulnerability was disclosed according 


to a 90-day disclosure deadline.

Figure 9 Extract from The Register article “Security hole in AMD CPUs' hidden secure processor code revealed ahead of 


patches”9 


As such we do not believe the company will react quickly enough to adequately limit associated liabilities. AMD 


has not yet confirmed that the company was previously unaware of the vulnerabilities identified by CTS Labs.  


Vulnerabilities are difficult to patch if patching is possible at all. Product recalls are warranted 
CTS identified several vulnerabilities at the hardware level (“logic gates”10) which may be not addressable 


through conventional patching.  


From discussions with experts: in the most optimistic of scenario it will take AMD many months to patch 


vulnerabilities on its devices. If AMD fails to find a workaround in the near term, we believe a full recall in the 


interest of public safety would be necessary and enforced if need be, as the chips are mostly under 12 months 


of age. 


Voluntary recalls by semiconductor companies are not without precedent. Intel has recalled its Pentium FDIV in 


1994 and Cougar Point in 201111 at significant cost (US$475M and US$700M respectively). While a deep analysis 


of these two recalls is beyond the scope of this follow-up, the security flaws in AMD’s products are likely to far 


exceed the defects identified in Intel’s processors which necessitated a recall. 


We believe that AMD will likely have to recall its Ryzen chips given the scope and severity of the vulnerabilities, 


the lengthy period to provide patches and work-arounds, and the prospect of more vulnerabilities being 


discovered. 


Product liability 
A consumer’s cause of action is usually based on common law as no federal product liability law exists, except 


for the False Claims Act. This cause of action revolves around three types of claims: 


1. Breach of warranty: the ability to seek remedy when a product fails to satisfy express representations, is 


not merchantable, or is unfit for its particular purpose.12 


2. Negligence: the ability to seek remedy from the defendant for failing to use due care13 


3. Strict liability: the ability to seek remedy for product defect regardless of steps the manufacturer has taken14 


AMD passed on ASMedia’s flawed technology to customers with little in the way of due diligence or effective 


security review15,16

Viceroy Research Group 9 viceroyresearch.org 


Warranties17  
Implied warranties are unspoken and unwritten promises created by state law between a seller or merchant, to 


their customers. There are two types of implied warranties that occur in consumer product transactions; the 


implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. 


1. The implied warranty of merchantability is a merchant's basic promise that the goods sold will do what 


they are supposed to do and that there is nothing significantly wrong with them. In other words, it is 


an implied promise that the goods are fit to be sold.  


2. The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is a promise sellers make when their customers 


rely on their advice that a product can be used for some specific purpose. 


Based on the ease with which the vulnerabilities in AMD’s products are exploitable, we do not believe these 


products conform with the basic promise of a safe, secure product fit for use, essentially the product claims 


are likely to be making “false claims.” 


False claims  
Based on the ease with which the vulnerabilities in AMD’s products are exploitable, we do not believe AMD’s 


products were sufficiently tested and audited to justify its promotional competitive advantage of superior 


security. We believe AMD may be subject to legal action under the false claims act. 


Regulatory issues may exacerbate problems for AMD  
While cybersecurity regulation is still in its nascent stages, it is becoming an increasingly important issue for 


company boards and management teams. This includes heightened scrutiny by the SEC, who recently released 


guidelines on timely cybersecurity disclosure following Spectre and Meltdown issues. Do not forget the AMD’s 


initial response was to deny any impact from Spectre and Meltdown. It was only after Intel highlighted the issues 


for AMD and that they were working with them did AMD admit to the impact of such vulnerabilities.  


Homeland security have recently outlined proposals to integrate vetting of cyber-risks to the Government supply 


chains. We believe that AMD’s misleading representation of the security of its products have a wide host of 


potential regulatory and legal repercussions, including but not limited to product liability issues, warranty 


protections, and false advertising, which may all lead to various fines and lawsuits. 


Viceroy believe legal liabilities that will arise for AMD due to discoveries by CTS Labs will 


exceed any residual value of the company, and accordingly maintain that the Company 


will file for Chapter 11 in the short term in order to more effectively deal with claims. 


AMD possible prior knowledge of issues  
Since the publication of our report, a number of sources close to AMD have reached out to Viceroy alleging that 


all matters identified by CTS had been known to AMD since at least Q4 2017. While we are not able to evaluate 


this data, AMD should clarify whether or not it was aware of these issues prior to communications by CTS and if 


so, why the issues not disclosed as per the SEC Guidance1819

The issues have also been relayed to Microsoft, US-CERT, Dell, HP, Cisco, Symantec, FireEye, and CrowdStrike. 


CTS have advised it took CrowdStrike one day to have a good understanding of the issues, and Microsoft Security 


only two days to be completely on top of the vulnerabilities identified20. 


Given the time frame, this begs the question as to why AMD’s customers have not also dismissed claims.  


In our opinion, it is irresponsible for AMD to request voting slips for executive remuneration (or hold the meeting 


altogether) until these issues are addressed, especially given that significant portions of management 


compensation are bound to top line sales, which we have discussed may bring substantial contingent liabilities. 


Insider Sales – Chief Technology Officer insider sales of options after CTS Expose 
It is concerning that AMD’s CTO has chosen to exercise and immediately sell 150,000 shares of AMD two days 


after the publication of our report. We find it strange that despite serious flaws being highlighted, AMD’s Chief 


Technology Officer (CTO) sold options during such a critical time.  


 
Figure 10 Extract of Form 4: Mark Papermaster dated March 15, 201821 


Papermaster’s sale of a 150,000 shares is material, especially after the disclosures and concerns raised by CTS 


Labs. The SEC guidance on the matter, applicable from February 18, 2018, is extremely clear:

Similar questions were raised regarding Intel CEO Brian Krzanich’s  insider sales executed last year in the midst 


of the Spectre fiasco: Krzanich’s sales have been alleged to be illegal. 


Of concern is that the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton statement on the aforementioned guidance regarding the sale 


of stock: a statement heavily applicable to Papermaster’s involvement with AMD’s attempt to downplay the 


risks of the vulnerabilities: 


 
Figure 11 Extract of Release by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton February 21, 201823 


AMD were aware of the CTS Labs vulnerabilities when Papermaster’s sales took place, similar to Intel’s CEO 


Krzanich. We expect the media to take a similarly dim view as to whether these sales could have been illegal.
