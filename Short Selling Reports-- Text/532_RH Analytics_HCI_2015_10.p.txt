HCI Group: More Risk, Less Return

Summary


HCI's new takeouts mark a strategic shift toward high-risk low-return policies.


Expected loss ratios on HCI's takeouts are significantly higher than its existing book.


We expect reinsurance costs to increase and margins to be pressured.


We believe the new takeouts are unlikely to be profitable for shareholders long term.


The HCI Group (NYSE:HCI) announced two assumptions in Q4'14, one was completed in
December, the other is scheduled for February. In a previous article, we provided detailed
analysis of the December takeout and the substantial increase in risk marked by the
assumption of wind-only policies. Data obtained from the Florida regulator indicates that
the February takeout book is riskier still, with exceptionally high expected losses.


In recent years, investors have had the luxury of focusing on the possible returns
associated with homeowner's insurance in the Florida. Mild storm seasons have allowed
catastrophic risks to recede from view, becoming abstract probabilities rather than real
threats. The benign environment is allowing HCI to ramp-up risks significantly for minimal,
incremental profit potential, likely in attempt to maintain growth. With low margins under
the best of assumptions, we believe the new takeouts are unlikely to be profitable long
term.


The table below provides risk statistics from HCI's existing book as well as the two
takeouts.

For our analysis, we take the average of the low and high estimates generated by the two
hurricane models. For HCI's existing book, the average probable maximum loss or PML is
$1.1B. The average of the average annual loss to total insured value, AAL (Average
Annual Loss) to TIV (Total Insured Value), is 0.179%; and the average of the average
annual loss to in-force premium, AAL to premium, 21.1%.


The loss estimates for the new takeouts are significantly higher than those for HCI's
existing book. The AAL to TIV increases from 0.179% to 0.305% and 0.48%, respectively,
for the two takeouts. The AAL to premium increases from 21.1% to 40% and 57.4%,
respectively. That is, average annual losses for the February takeout are expected to be
an astounding $0.574 for every $1 in premium collected. The expected losses on the book
are 2.7x greater than HCI's existing book - a massive increase in risk.


Policies with such high expected losses are very expensive to reinsure and will likely put
downward pressure on margins. As an example, in a letter to the OIR (Office of Insurance
Regulation), HCI stated that reinsurance would cost 67% of premiums for the December
takeout. The February book has a higher loss to premium ratio; one would assume that
the cost of reinsuring the book would be higher on a stand-alone basis.


The table below depicts HCI's underwriting business model and estimates the profitability
of the new policies assuming high reinsurance rates.


More Risk for Less Return


Source: OIR documents and estimates.


In documents filed with the regulator, HCI estimated that 2014 reinsurance costs would be
28% of gross premiums. For our estimates of profitability for the new books, we assume a
reinsurance cost of 65%. Assuming zero losses, the pretax underwriting margin would be
10%; a 5% loss ratio leads to a very slim 5% pretax underwriting margin. Our margin
estimates are in line with HCI's forecasts for the December book provided to the OIR.

We expect reinsurance costs plus losses to absorb 65%-80% of gross premiums. It is
difficult to see how the policies can be profitable long-term with such a high cost structure.
Indeed, we believe it is highly unlikely, and expect the new takeouts to drive margin
compression on a firm-wide basis.


Conclusion


HCI's business model was built around accessing subsidies from Citizens via the
assumption of standard, multi-peril policies. When the quantity and quality of Citizens
policies declined, HCI verbally signaled it would focus on maximizing cash flow, rather
than pursuing growth to the detriment of the quality of the existing book. In our view, the
move into wind-only takeouts marks a significant change in strategy where the company
accepts more risk for less return.


In a letter to the OIR detailing the rationale for assuming wind-only policies, HCI states
that the takeout is "marginally sound on an existing basis". In what looks like an effort to
make the assumption appear viable, HCI stated that it would attempt to convert the wind-
only policies into standard policies, which are more profitable.


We are all for hopeful optimism and improving profit potential. However, until the
economics of wind-only policies change or until they are magically transformed into
something else, rates are inadequate for risks assumed. In our estimation, the new
assumptions are unlikely to be profitable for HCI's shareholders long term.

Amazing you guys are still short. I guess you will still be short when the price is 50 and then 55. Someone has to lose
in the game and right now it looks like it will be you. You need a good hurricane to come through to prove your points.

Florida history says there will be a hurricane eventually. Till then..... I'll take the dividends, watch it go higher,
and use stop loss orders just-in-case.

I'm afraid a hurricane will not be needed to bring this albatross down. It would help considerably though.

Perhaps, in contrast to the opinions shared, HCI is more analytical in reaching their decisions. Much to the surprise of
many, Florida has 'received' fewer hurricanes than North Carolina, New Jersey or even New York over the past ten
years. Yet, due to our expertise of looking to the past to project the future, we continue to disproportionately (in my
opinion) weigh hurricane risk in Florida.


HCI has some pretty sophisticated intellectual power when it comes to statistical modeling. Perhaps they are working
from a base of statistical probabilities that are more far reaching in scope than appreciated.


One example? Although not politically popular, there is growing evidence the earth is in a cooling phase, which bodes
poorly for hurricane formation off the west coast of Africa. A second potentially influential factor of global cooling is the
North American jet stream dipping further south, thereby affecting the path of storms approaching the North American
continent (ergo New Jersey rather than Florida).


Management at HCI may be more competent than just 'lucky' to be in the right place at the right time - as inferred in
this article. Perhaps they grasp the current high cost of wind insurance to Florida home owners as an opportunity to
grab market share from the more methodical, 'rearview mirror' management style of other insurers. If proven correct,
they will merit a much higher multiple to their current valuation.

The business model is fundamentally unsustainable and earnings will implode at some point, with or without a
hurricane (though a hurricane could very well wipe this company out entirely). Furthermore, the company is
assuming increasingly riskier policies to keep this game going. This stock will revert back to trading at 1x
book and the long money will be transferred directly into my brokerage account.

Yet another blowout quarter. That's an interesting form of implosion.
