MicroVision: Why We Don't See The Vision
Mar. 23, 2015 2:12 PM ET26 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


MicroVision has morphed its 22-year-old idea for a virtual retinal display into a tiny
projector module business.


Experts say apparent customer Sony may be using its $14.5 million MicroVision
component purchase order as a way to spruce up its consumer electronics division
for possible sale.


Sony's focus on iPhone sensors likely doesn't offer MicroVision an opportunity: Sony
wanted only the MEMS component, and MEMS won't work with the smartphone.


The market for tiny projectors is tiny, and the average sales price is declining. A
likely cancellable purchase order cannot fix those issues.


Facing nearly half-a-billion deficits, going concern issues and $2 million executive
compensation, we expect an equity raise at some point as MicroVision burns nearly
four times more cash than revenue.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


MicroVision's (NASDAQ:MVIS) product and future still look stunningly microscopic despite
the big frenzy over an order for its tiny projector components. The company emerged
about the time gasoline was $1 and the auto-film rewind Sure Shot cameras were the big
thing. When MicroVision went public three years later in 1996, investors plunked down
about $42 a share on the belief that the company would someday sell technology to
project images onto a user's eyeball.


Decades later, the eyeball idea has morphed into component modules for tiny projectors.
And the share price morphed to ~$2. It stayed in that range from the summer of 2013 until
recently. Then, the stock suddenly streaked to ~$4. Why? MicroVision has landed a $14.5
million component order, essentially confirmed to be from Sony (NYSE:SNE).


But TheStreetSweeper contends a $14.5 million order is still not going to morph
MicroVision's $469 million loss into a profit. Let's look at the issues we believe are
conspiring to pummel this stock back to that familiar $2 territory and below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3021726-microvision-why-we-dont-see-the-vision 2/14


First, the bull case.


The bull thesis applauds further development efforts with Sony that began in April 2013.
The technology is validated through the March non-exclusive licensing agreement.
MicroVision began fulfilling $3.8 million in component orders for Sony near year's end and
will continue into 2015.


Bulls are lauding PicoP integration into some consumer products such as the Korean
OEM Celluon, which is now selling products. Sometime in the second half of the year, they
are expecting a smartphone product.


More revenue sources are needed as indicated by 4Q14 revenue/losses of $0.7 million
and $0.08 loss/share, however. Wall Street expected $1.7 million and $0.08 loss.
Oppenheimer is estimating $20 million revenue in 2015 ($0.04 loss). It estimates revenue
dropping to $12 million in 2016 ($0.20 loss).


Extrapolating from Oppenheimer's estimates, it appears MicroVision might sell $9.5 million
to Sony this year, but only $8.5 million in 2016 - which doesn't sound like a growing
market. While Northland Securities has a "buy" on MicroVision (the report was
unavailable), Oppenheimer said it prefers to remain sidelined until more revenue sources
are secured. Investors may find other viewpoints on MicroVision here.


The entire projector market is tiny. The average sales price is declining.


Worldwide, the demand for projectors is just about 8.3 million units per year. In the US, the
sales overall were up only 1 percent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2014. At the
same time, the average sales price has declined 19 percent in the United States,
according to the report. And in other countries, a few percentage points greater.


Indeed, the market for the PicoP projector - MicroVision's product - is so small that there's
no good market data on just that category's sales. Big ol' boys have tried and failed to
grow this market. Samsung (OTC:SSDIY) introduced its Galaxy Beam containing a Pico
projector several years ago. As a reviewer suspected, the novelty soon wore off, and
Samsung moved on due to what sources called low sales. Samsung tried again with the
Beam 2, but those soon went in the trash can, too.


One new purchase order obviously can't grow this niche market.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3021726-microvision-why-we-dont-see-the-vision 3/14


TheStreetSweeper asked engineer and KGOn Tech President Karl Guttag what he thinks
motivated Sony to spend money on Pico projector components if the field offers so little
promise.


"It could be that Sony is looking for a gimmick to help sell something," said Mr. Guttag.


An analyst agreed and pointed out that, weighed down by $1 billion in losses last year,
Sony spun off its TV business and sold its personal computer division. The company now
seems open to a sales or joint venture deal for its TV and mobile phone units, according to
Reuters' sources.


So it appears restructuring Sony could be splashing on extra cologne to try to find a
consumer electronics buyer.


Why MicroVision's Deal With Sony Does Not Open Up iPhone Opportunities


Along with its PlayStation, Sony is now primarily focusing on selling image sensors for
iPhones. At first glance, this sounds as if it might be an opportunity for MicroVision's
product. We'll hit on the chief reasons we don't think that's the case.


First, apparently unimpressed with MicroVision's IP, Sony stuck with its own intellectual
property. MicroVision's product is a module containing laser light source, circuitry to
control mirrors, and MEMS controllable mirror to direct the image. Sony elected to order
only the MEMS component.


Second, the MEMS isn't applicable to the iPhone. For smartphone camera modules, Sony
is the huge vendor of the CMOS sensor, a piece of silicon that reads light input and
converts it to digital data. But MicroVision's product paints laser beams on a screen. So it
does just the opposite.


Third, even if it would work technologically, MicroVision's product is way too big for today's
slim phones and it rapidly consumes phone batteries.


Just Building Inventory … Or Worse?


Mr. Guttag and an analyst in this field say the deal may one day break investors' hearts.


"My guess is … at best, Sony will not find a market for 1 million units to support the
roughly $8 million pre-order," said Mr. Guttag, referring to the up-front licensing payment
received.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3021726-microvision-why-we-dont-see-the-vision 4/14


Mr. Guttag is a retired Texas Instruments fellow, and until December 2011, CTO of
MicroVision competitor Syndiant. Mr. Guttag and another expert envision a worst case
scenario.


"If the first X-thousand units don't sell they may cancel their order," said Mr. Guttag. An
analyst who requested anonymity agreed. He added that those orders likely will become
just more inventory.


"Based on reasonable assumptions, for their product to be price competitive, this implies 1
million units," the analyst said. "That's a very high number versus the total projector
market (of about 8 million worldwide)."


Millions In MicroVision Market - Billions Needed


Beyond the cancellation risk, there's risk in the bigger picture. MicroVision's MEMS, short
for "micro electrical-mechanical system," products must be high volume to be profitable. It
is possible to make a profit selling MEMS. We can see that by comparing MicroVision ($18
million net loss in 2014) with two companies that have succeeded: InvenSense
(NYSE:INVN) ($6 million net income) and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) ($128 million
net income ).


The difference? Those two built their MEMS business on the cell phone market. Why was
this possible? Billions of cell phones are sold each year. The Pico projector is a niche in
the total projector market, which is how big, again? Eight million. MicroVision would be
extremely fortunate if it could sell a million or two in the market. But even drastically
improving that -377% operating margin, it still wouldn't be profitable.


MicroVision's Own Projectors Flop


MicroVision's 2010 Pico projector product ShowWX carried a $500 price tag originally,
now out-of-stock at Amazon, and garnered only a "fair" rating from a PCMag editor. The
reviewer called it interesting, but added "the image quality isn't quite ready for prime time."


The latter version, ShowWX+, got better reviews, including this "6-out-of-10" rating, with
pros of "small and light," and cons of "only suitable for small-screen projection, weak
brightness, requires TV Out in iOS apps."


This reviewer commented:


"The lack of brightness removes all punch - watching a film at this size is like having
a story whispered at you from across a room."

The ShowWX and ShowWX+ are virtually impossible to find - anyplace. If you check
MicroVision's website, here's what you'll see:


If you click on any of the links to online retailers, here's what you'll see:


Mr. Guttag, the engineer, is negative on laser scanning, regardless of what company
offers it. "From a technology perspective, laser scanning is still a poor choice in terms of
cost, size, power efficiency and image quality," he said, referring to his preference, Texas
Instruments' (NYSE:TXN) DLP (digital light processing) and LCOS (liquid crystal on
silicon).


Consumers can find little conference projectors now that offer wireless mirroring, shown
here and here and here. And good projection capabilities are offered on today's tablets, as
well. Some examples are here and here.


Burn, Revenue and Equity Raise Issues


The four top executives running this money-losing enterprise haul in a cool $2.07 million,
with CEO Alexander Tokman's salary and stock options the highest in 2013 at $846,056.
Their company just made $3.48 million in revenue in 2014. And it burned through almost
that much - $3.25 million - in one quarter.


The company's SEC filings contain nearly seven pages of risk warnings, including:

"We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant losses in the
future."


And …


"We will require additional capital to fund our operations and to implement our
business plan."


And …


"… we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our
operations through December 2015. We will require additional cash to fund our
operating plan past that time. We plan to obtain additional cash through sales and
licensing activities and/or the issuance of equity or debt securities."


And …


"We cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable."


The company has been trying to make a profit for 22 years and hasn't done so yet. So,
what are the chances this $14.5 million order will save MicroVision from its nearly half-
billion in net losses, going concern issues and tiny product while working within a teensy
niche market? In our opinion, the chances are micro.

I like the part where the author spends a couple paragraphs on Microvision's old projectors being a flop when we all

Maybe some of these "arguments" stated here might have to be thought over again by Mrs. Colberg to this some of
them are just false and misleading


"*First, the bull case."


This "bullish" scenario mentiones only two sony orders + " PicoP integration into some consumer products such as
the Korean OEM Celluon" and eventually a smartphone product.


1. Celluon plans to release additional products this year besides the PicoAir and PicoPro. -- the demand for their
product is larger than what they are producing right now. They are increasing their output.


2. Regarding the smartphone product:


from earnings call: 
Last June we announced a collaboration with the second consumer electronic company on the Fortune Global 500 list
to develop a display engine for an innovative smartphone product plan to be offered by this company.


We have made significant progress and advancement on the display module development with them and they
communicated to us that they target second half of 2015 for market introduction of their product.


3. Global operating Auto OEM is not mentioned in this "bullish" scenario.


In the Automotive segment, MicroVision delivered prototype head-up display units to a major vehicle OEM and a
global Tier 1 supplier.


4. Global operating logistics company not mentioned.


Also in Q3 of last year, we delivered custom PicoP display modules to a leading global logistics company for
deployment in one of their facilities in the United States. The modules are part of their new package guidance
application aimed at increasing processing efficiency in real-time package sorting and routing.


5. additional products about to be released not mentioned.


Alexander Tokman - President and CEO


Sure. There are several types of products actually. We can’t specify it because this would shed light on something
that people ask us not to discuss publicly into their outlook but the companion products are part of the portfolio. They
are obviously working with smartphone manufacturer. We obviously are working with several companies who want to
introduce simpler version aftermarket head-up displays. Also, there are applications that related to home and that are
not your traditional projection applications.


Hope i havent missed anything but this kinda sheds a different light on this whole bull case.

" *The entire projector market is tiny. The average sales price is declining."


Sorry - but how can someone possibly outline this statement as an "argument" in this case?


It is NOT about the projector market. Its not about any "niche". Thats a whole different story comparing the projectors
and the market you talking about with this small laser based technology aimed to penetrate a complete different
market segment/segments. The whole article is based on this "argument"...


"Samsung introduced its Galaxy Beam containing a Pico projector several years ago. As a reviewer suspected, the
novelty soon wore off, and Samsung moved on due to what sources called low sales. Samsung tried again with the
Beam 2 but those soon went in the trash can, too."


Complete different technology, which not even close can keep up with Microvisions technology today.


The rest of those "arguments" mentioned in this article all refer to past/old events, comments or performance which
are kind of lightweight when you look at whats coming in 2015.

Incredibly sleazy to focus on 4 year old reviews of a discontinued product when there are BRAND NEW and stellar
reviews of the MVIS-inside Celluon products. Just google for "Celluon PicoPro review" and see for yourself.


Here's a sample money quote from one: "So it’s a big surprise that Celluon’s new featherweight pocket-size PicoPro
is a heavyweight champ. I was prepared for it to suck — but was surprised and delighted when it turned my living
room wall into a 150-inch cinema screen"


There are lots more of that same general sentiment about the CURRENT generation of MVIS PicoP projectors, not
the discontinued ones from 4 YEARS AGO that this article insisted on using. Shame on you!

This is nice, "The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in MVIS and stand to profit on any future
declines in the stock price."


This is a bold move, considering the recent multi-year break out — not to mention, the possibility of new contracts
being press released would generate a giant move to the upside. Interactive brokers has no shorts available, so this is
going to get very interesting if the shorts get their hands caught in the cookie jar.

Sony is not a Global Fortune 100 company. Samsung is, and in fact sold over a quarter of a billion smartphones in
2014, more than Apple or anyone else. On March 20, 2015, there was a product preview of the brand new Samsung
Galaxy S6 Edge smartphone and in the second video at exactly 1:45, one minute and forty five seconds, they say the
port is for the video projector. So, it is pretty easy to speculate that Samsung is the Global Fortune 100 Company
MicroVision mentions. I do not have facts, but I further speculate that if and when it is mentioned on CNBC or
Bloomberg that they cracked the Galaxy S6 Edge open and found a PicoP MicroVision laser projector inside, that
MVIS share price rallies. When CNBC cracked open a GoPro and found an Ambarella Inc, (AMBA) chip inside, AMBA
rallied hard, in fact going from $6.00 in October 2012 to $72.25 closing price today, March 23, 2015. I am long MVIS.

The CEO said the F100 is Sony no less than six times on the recent yearly/quarterly results conference call.
The transcript of which is available here on Seeking Alpha. Go count up the "Sony" references yourself, it's
easy.


Sony was an F100 in 2013 (#94) when the relationship with MVIS began, and that's the term MVIS has used
for them ever since. Changing labels mid-stream would create more market confusion and cause people to
wonder if a new customer had replaced the old customer. So they've stuck with it, in spite of Sony falling out
of the F100 in 2014.

Mr. Guttag, the engineer, is always good for chuckles. After MVIS completed the $4.6M development contract, he
assured you not to worry, that was just a throw-away R&D project, no Sony product would come from it. Now Sony
has spent another $8M on the one-time royalty payment (MVIS will also receive royalties on each unit sold) and given
MVIS a $15M order, Guttag continues to reassure you shorts not to worry. Sony has spent well over $20M just on
their payments to MVIS, say nothing of what they`ve spent internally but Guttag stills tells you this is going nowhere,
you have nothing to fear, no need to cover, ever.


Meanwhile MVIS stock has only just started to reflect the expected value of this alliance by doubling to a 3 year high.
PnF points to a continued breakout to $9. 
Which side of this bet you want to take? Continue listening to Guttag or start following the money? You decide.

I wonder if the shorts are really going to hold onto their 3M short position as the price continues to rise or are they
looking for suckers who will sell them the shares they need to get out before the stock doubles again? I`m looking
forward to news flow and the reveal of who the new F500 OEM is that MVIS claims plans to ship product in 2H 2015.
There are a handful of other possible new deals besides that one. Are the shorts really planning to hold through all the

So, how about citing the opinion of a non-biased engineer?


Author makes argument that Microvision's tech is so-so based on tech that is several years old (the original
projectors). I have to agree with another readers comment that this is sleazy. So far, all evidence suggests
that the new module (used in PicoAir) is leaps and bounds improvement.


Another part of the bull thesis isn't mentioned...the automotive HUD market, where MVIS likely has
Jaguar/Land Rover as a partner.


I have to agree that the article is weak on substance (basically just reiterating the same dull points the shorts
have used in the past).


How would the shorts like another surprise announcement? On the automotive HUD front? Or another
consumer electronics partner?

This is Purely and Simply Covert Stock Manipulation Masquerading as Stock Analysis. This Company has a Track
record of similar interventions designed to drive down the Stock of Publicly Quoted Companies. Judging by the
response on the Financial Websites not many people are falling for this Blatant misinformation. If One reads and
follows up on the first comment regarding this piece of nonsense posted by Esekla it become manifestly apparent that

this Article is not only factually incorrect but has been published in order to obtain financial gain for the publishers and
their Associates!! I have no doubt that the appropriate Authority's will be studying this situation very carefully!!

By the way, anyone notice that the Cellulon Pico Air seems to be continuously out of stock at Amazon, and the
Amazon reviews are all raving 5 star? Demand is outstripping supply. Hmmm. PLEASE, PLEASE write another article
slamming MVIS.

How is this statement...


"The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in MVIS and stand to profit on any future declines in the stock
price."


...compatible with this one?:


"Editor's Note: As a matter of policy, TheStreetSweeper prohibits members of its editorial team from taking financial
positions in the companies that they cover."

What a shallow piece of investigative reporting... full of errors, misrepresented facts, and biased opinions of people
that have no known expertise in the field.


MicroVision has managed to survive the odds stacked against it, it has survived the naked shorting and stock
manipulations, and is a better and stronger company today with a low cost high margin business model.


Play the "short" game at your own risk but don't manipulate the facts and express your naive opinions as facts.


You want some facts with in-depth investigative reporting, then read this...

So, wondering if anyone knows what the current short interest in the stock is- NASDAQ http://bit.ly/1FFYjOT 
says as of 3/13 it is 3,940,118 vs 3,545,748 on 2/27. 
However, another source http://bit.ly/1FFYjOV 
puts short interest at 8,378,500  
Why the extreme difference?

I am appalled by the complacency not to say Hypocrisy being shown by Seeking Alpha in publishing this Scurrilous
attempt at Stock Manipulation."The Street Sweeper" is Backed by One Manuel Assensio. One only has to Google the
word Assensio or click on this link http://bit.ly/1FVDFdV to get an idea what type of person Mr Assensio is. Essentially
Mr Assensio is a convicted Stock Manipulator who even allowing for an element of Hype in the Assensioexposed
Website is about as Bent as a Two Dollar Bill!!


"The Street Sweeper" have had other Defamatory Articles Published on SA namely one attempting to drive down the
Stock price of OLED an attempt in which they were patently unsuccessful!! It appears from Comments that not many
observers are taken is by this Scurrilous Rag. The foregoing however in no way mitigates the Culpability of SA who
must be aware of the intent behind this and other Articles from Manuel Assensio and his Propaganda Machine!!

Common sense tells me:


If Sony didn’t believe in this market opportunity with MVIS, then they would of not gone this far — Sony has invested,
and will continue to invest significant amount of money into this proposition. In a nutshell, what they’ve given us is a
fraction of what they are investing because they truly believe that there's something special about this emerging
display technology, and from the success of this, I expect to believe that there will be many copycats who will join in
the fun.


And MVIS did state that it's currently working with a second electronics brand on the Fortune Global 500 list on a
smartphone product and that, in the automotive segment, it delivered prototype HUD units to a major vehicle OEM
and a tier-one automotive supplier. Things are definitely heat up! Please continue to short.

Just a quick "thank you" to the shorts! I was able to successfully build my position at a much lower price than I had
originally anticipated! 
Much obliged!


Momentum has turned solidly bullish, and volume is picking up-
