Oil Doubles, But BPT Should Still Get Cut In Half
Apr. 27, 2016 9:39 AM ET36 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


BPT’s price has collapsed despite an extraordinary rally in the price of oil.


We believe that this anomaly is due to the market’s recent recognition that there is a
clear line of sight to BPT’s last dividends.


As this becomes more broadly understood, we believe that current yield will become
an increasingly irrelevant valuation tool in favor of the net present value of the
remaining cash flows.


On this measure, BPT remains significantly overvalued with its current price
representing more than twice its fair value.


We expect BPT’s significant underperformance to continue until the shift in PBT’s
valuation paradigm is complete.


BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust's (NYSE:BPT) price has collapsed since a bearish investor
issued a press release highlighting disclosures from the Trust's 2015 Form 10-K and
following our prior article regarding the Trust. In that article, we provided a description of
the Trust, its contractually-escalating cost profile and the resulting expected cash flows to
the Trust based on the price of oil. Our conclusion was that the fair value of BPT at that
time was over 70% below its trading price.


In this article, we reexamine these expected cash flows in the context of oil's extraordinary
rally from its low on February 11 th to its current high. We also provide some context for
considering future production levels given the news that BP has reduced the number of
rigs that it is operating in Prudhoe Bay to 2 from 5. Finally, this article is a response to a
report in another forum that suggests that BPT is a bet on the oil price recovering (link).
While true, we felt it would be useful to assess just how much of a recovery is required to
justify a purchase at BPT's current price.

On February 11 th, the spot price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (NYSE:WTI)
closed at $26.21 a price not seen since 2003. It subsequently rallied approximately 68% to
over $44 as of April 26, 2016. Despite this rally, BBT has fallen over 40% during this
period. Given this incredible underperformance, it would be tempting to believe that BPT is
now undervalued. This however is the wrong conclusion as our analysis shows that BPT's
underperformance is not the result of an attractive valuation anomaly - rather we believe it
is the result of the market coming to recognize that the end is approaching for BPT.


Oil Price Scenarios


The graph below shows the forward curve for WTI as of its February 11 th low point and
the current high on April 26 th. We have also included the SEC reference price of $50.28
which readers of our first article will recognize as the basis for the Trust's publicly
disclosed PV-10 value. We will use these three price scenarios to examine how the fair
value of BPT changes with differing oil price expectations.
Contractual Costs


As we did in our first article, we examine the expected quarterly per barrel costs that are
used to calculate the cash flows owed to the Trust. Since the detail of how these
contractual cash flows are determined was presented in our first article, we will not repeat
it here. We will however remind readers that only two assumptions need to be made. The
first is the future rate of inflation associated with the costs charged to the Trust - which we
have again assumed to be zero. The second relates to the production taxes which are
based on the price of WTI. For the charts below, we have depicted the taxes based on the
April 26 th forward price (In our NPV analysts we used the appropriate production tax
calculation for each scenario).
As a reminder, the contracted costs are not related to the actual costs incurred at Prudhoe
Bay. Rather, they are driven by a schedule that was agreed at the time that the Trust was
created. They begin to escalate at a rapid pace beginning in 2018 with these increases
continuing until the termination of the Trust. The actual cost increase will be greater than
depicted above should the actual rate of inflation (based on the CPI) be greater than our
assumption of zero.


Per Barrel Cash Flows


In the chart below, we depict the per barrel cash flows earned by the Trust in each of our
price scenarios. These values are represented by the difference between the price of WTI
in each scenario vs the associated cost for each period.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/4/26/959452-14617149633181546_origin.jpg
As shown, the per barrel royalty has improved significantly since the February low of the
oil market and, based on the current forward curve, it appears that royalty payments may
persist until 2021 rather than 2020. However, it is worth noting that even with the historic
rally in the price of oil, the current forward curve is still (on average) below the SEC price
for the relevant time period.


Implied Value


To determine the value of BTU's units, we multiply the per barrel royalty by the expected
volume of production for each period. We use a 10% discount rate which is consistent with
the rate used by the SEC and is a yield that we believe to be fair for the risks associated
with the Trust's cash flows. With regard to expected production, at this point in our
analysis we have assumed a 1.5% annual decline while considering the seasonality of
production at Prudhoe Bay. In accordance with the Trust's royalty agreement, we cap
volumes for each period at 90,000 barrels per day.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/4/26/959452-14617150048651817_origin.jpg
Based on these assumptions and the assumption that the Trust's future administrative
expenses will be consistent with those of the past we calculate the NPV of the expected
cash flows of the Trust to be as follows for each of the scenario's considered:


As shown in this chart, we have also calculated the implied return of the units based on
their closing price as of April 26, 2016. Our conclusion at this point in our analysis is that,
while the NPV of the Trust has increased by $5.76 since the recent low of the oil market,
the units are trading at nearly twice their fair value.


Production


We have based our work thus far on the assumption that the production decline rate
would be quite benign for Prudhoe Bay. However with BP's decision to reduce the working
rig count from 5 rigs to 2, we believe that it is worthwhile to consider other scenarios. To
do so we looked to the data for the Alyeska Pipeline which transports oil produced in
Prudhoe Bay and other fields in the Alaska North Slope. This data is available on the
pipeline's website and in the graph below we have depicted the average annual volumes
since production peaked in the late 1980s.



http://www.alyeska-pipe.com/TAPS/PipelineOperations/Throughput
The decline rate for the past 10 years has averaged approximately 5.5%. It is worth noting
that 2015's average volume of 508 MBbl per day is now at a level which presents real
challenges for the pipeline as described on the operator's website. While we have not
contemplated what a permanent or temporary loss of the pipeline would mean to the
Trust, we have looked at the value of the units should the announced reduction in drilling
cause Prudhoe Bay production to decline at the increased rate of 5%.


As expected, the quicker decline in production further reduces the fair value of the units
with the NPV based on the current forward curve dropping from $8.36 to $7.77 per unit or
less than half of the current price of the units.



http://www.alyeska-pipe.com/TAPS/PipelineOperations/LowFlowOperations
Implied Oil Price


In our final analysis for this article, we determined what oil price was required to justify
BPT's current price of $16.18. We continued to assume that inflation would be zero while
assuming that production would decline at 5% as discussed above. We then used
increasingly higher fixed price assumptions for WTI (beginning as of April 1, 2016 and
continuing in perpetuity) until the NPV of BPT's cash flows matched the current unit price.
As shown below, justifying BPT's current trading price requires a WTI price of nearly $60.
Said differently, WTI, having rallied almost $18 from its low, would need to rally nearly $16
more for the current price of BPT to be warranted.


Conclusion


As we stated in our first article, we believe that BPT is neither a good source of income
nor is it an attractive way to express a bullish view on oil. For investors seeking income,
buying a royalty trust with a limited remaining life is dangerous game which leaves
investors who are slow to leave the party holding the bag (Whiting USA Trust I (WHXT)
provides a clear example of how such things end).
For investors seeking to express a bullish view on oil, we ask why anyone would do so
with a security that is already implying and immediate and permanent increase in the price
of oil to nearly $60. If one is confident that the price of oil will quickly rise to that level, we
believe that there are far more attractive and lucrative ways to express that view.

BPT is not just oil. It is safe oil. Should S A and Iran get into another cyberwar, this stock would skyrocket up. Long

Oil is heading back to $30ish. I think oil stocks are a traders market between $28-45 for the short to medium term.
I've closed out all my positions today. "Sell in May" is coming. There will be a buying opportunity again come the
Fall. You will want to own the leaders.

@tmketner,


"Oil has to get to $150/ barrel and soon."


Well if that happens, then BPT would be a good pick, but that seems to be way outside what anyone is projecting.
The shale oil and renewables industries basically didn't exist in '05, when you were dealing with BP, and even with
oil below $100 a couple of years ago, US production was going up by 1/2-1 million brls./day each year. Cost of
shale production keeps dropping, and in the $50-60.WTI range, production will most likely start growing
dramatically again.


You would be amused to read some of the comments under the Solar City and Tesla articles. Some of the
enthusiasts there seem to think we'll be running on renewables in 10-20 years. They have interpreted Saudi
Arabia's recent comments and actions in an entirely different way than you; they don't think the Saudi's will be able
to find any buyers for their oil in 20 years. One of my favorite quotes is "the stone age didn't end because we ran
out of stones."


Taking the middle road and evaluating BPT on the basis of the oil futures curve seems to be a reasonable

@Bill
BPT is a very small portion of my portfolio. Everyone knows oil has to bounce, and the distribution is going
to be garbage for now. The sting is still very fresh from CAS Investment Partners play. This writer will find
no love, owning a short position, and bashing this stock. I was new to BPT and bought it at $20. I figured a
major move in oil or supply issue could make this an ok pick. I have a pretty good sense of when to get in,
and when to get out. I got a phone alert during a meeting that BPT, which was hovering near mid 30's the
night before, was rocket dropping. I dumped before the close, so I didn't actually lose money. That train
was not stopping. 
Nothing changed with that stock. No new data. The stock tanked because of an article written by CAS,
who had a $16 short, closing out in a 1 1/2 weeks. Sentiment was going the wrong way, and they knew it.
It was biased, could very well be way off the mark, and slanted to make a run. You have a short position,
and you write an article about how everyone should run for the hills again. You are going to get some heat.
I bought back in at $13. The reason the stock is going back up, because we already know all of the data.
Owners of BPT, at the time of CAS's play, know what CAS Investment Partners did. 
If oil doesn't move, then you are right, not a great pick. If oil moves big, could be an OK one. We will know
when we know. I read articles ways oil could go back down, and ways it could go to triple digits by the end
of 2016. I obviously feel it is going up, because I am vested heavily in oil. Would like to mention, so are big
banks, as well as Buffett. I heard today, Buffett just moved a bunch more money into it. WTI-Crude was up
pretty good across the board after the close today. I am not sure how it is doing now. We will see how the
sector does when XOM reports.

So many shale workers have been laid off, so many rigs stacked in boneyards, that it will take an
estimated 12-18 months for them to ramp up production once it becomes profitable to do so - over 100k
people out of work in the sector, many of which probably moved on to other jobs, may not come back and
risk getting laid off again. Boom towns are now ghost towns - nobody is going to jump back in feet first
when oil recovers, the pain of this slump was too much for many to endure.

sts,


Your comments actually paint a more bullish scenario for more oil price recovery. If the domestic shale
producers are slow to come back, then world wide demand could outpace ww supply. The demand/supply

typically over swings in free markets. And this time will probably be the same. Today is June 2nd and WTI
closed at $49.05, decent recovery since the lows in Feb. I'm not a bull or a bear but oil prices are not
static.

There is a lot of creep in multiple directions, so I wanted to bring the main topic back.


Really bad price of oil = shorter lifetime of the payments, as well as a lower payments.
Amazing price of oil = longer lifetime of the payments, as well as higher payments.


The way CAS reported this, the world was coming to an end, and flee for the hills!!! This was done to cover a short
at $16, when the stock was running at around $33, and heading up.


In 2011 BPT reported the payments would end in 2027
In last years report, the payments would end in 2028
This year it is 2020


Everyone knows the price of oil has tanked. If you believe like me, that the world is going to see a sharp increase
in the price of oil in the next few years, then BPT was a fairly cheap way, and still is, into a Trust. Nothing is 100%,
but pretty much guaranteed payouts (at least in the short-term). Maybe not as much with the price of oil the way it
was, but with really high oil prices, this is a good pick.


Can you find other investments, that pay $$ on your shares, absolutely. I am probably invested in them as well, but
this topic is BPT.


I have stated many times in other comments, so I will try not to rehash too much. Oil has to get to $150/ barrel and
soon. I don't care how much, and how fast we can suck it out of the ground. I did a project with BP back in '05, and
I will never forget what one of their engineers told me. To find any new oil now, we have to go to the deepest parts
of the ocean, or the worst hell holes on the globe, and you can pretty much bet someones going to die. The world
is not going to change its consumption habits, at $40 oil.


NOT FOR THE DAY TRADER OR RETIRING SOON
New exploration has stopped because of the price drop. It is the easiest expense to cut, besides laying people off.
Wells go dry all the time, maybe not a field, but you have to re-drill another location in that field. We have a glut
right now, but we are at max production everywhere but the US, and demand is increasing. Not sure if you know
how long you can pump from a well, but you have to keep ahead of it, to keep production levels up. Finding new
well locations and exploration, has not been happening because of the price drop. It will start again as everything
balances, but there will be a gap. During that gap, oil prices are going to sky-rocket. Demand will also have risen
during that time, which will exacerbate the situation.


I am long on most of the majors, as well as others I see potential in. About 70% of my portfolio is in some kind of
oil. Even if it drops again, I went 40% into oil at $29, and hopefully I wont need that $$ for a really long time. Don't
get caught looking for another "bottom". It is not coming.

This was never mentioned, and what was used for the 2020 calculation!!


"While energy price forecasts are highly uncertain, EIA forecasts that Brent and WTI crude oil prices will both
average $38 per barrel in 2016 and $50 per barrel in 2017."


If this was published, would have kept the run from happening. The WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, came directly
from EIA forecasts.


At the end of my editorial, I have included information from 3 paragraphs, with no omissions. I start from the
paragraph above the one which is the highly quoted, and the one directly after. There are a lot of factors outside
these paragraphs, that could affect the price as well, both positive and negative.


CAS Investment Partners was screwed, stuck with a bad investment that was closing out in 1 1/2 weeks, and
heading the wrong direction. What they published, and how it was slanted, pushed this stock to a favorable
outcome for them. They made a killing, and as a company, are unethical as they come!! This spread like wild fire,
and we still have writers with short positions, trying to do what CAS did. Do you know what the price of oil is going
to be next quarter, or average for the year?


PARAGRAPH BEFORE THE MUCH QUOTED PARTIAL PARAGRAPH
"The estimated future net revenues and present value of estimated future net revenues reported herein are
calculated based on a single average WTI price, that being the average of 12 WTI values, each value representing
the WTI price in effect on the first calendar day of the month for the 12 months prior to January 1, 2016. As a
result, any single calculation of a calendar day will not reflect the value of the dividend paid to the Trust for any
quarter, nor will it reflect the estimated future value of the Trust or the estimation of how long royalty payments to
the Trust will continue."


OFFENDING PARAGRAPH
Based on the 2015 twelve-month average WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, current Production Taxes, and the
Chargeable Costs adjusted as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, it is estimated that royalty
payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2020, and would be zero in the following year. Therefore, no
proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust after that date. Even if expected
reservoir performance does not change, the estimated reserves, economic life and future net revenues attributable
to the Trust may change significantly in the future as a result of sustained periods of change in the WTI Price, the
Production Tax or from changes in other prescribed variables utilized in calculations as defined by the Overriding
Royalty Conveyance. Such changes could result in the termination of royalty payments prior to 2020.


PARAGRAPH AFTER AND THE MOST IMPORTANT
"While energy price forecasts are highly uncertain, EIA forecasts that Brent and WTI crude oil prices will both
average $38 per barrel in 2016 and $50 per barrel in 2017. As discussed under “THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND
FIELD – Reserve Estimates”, the amount and value of reserves attributable to the Trust and the estimated life of



https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
the Trust fluctuate based on changes to certain prescribed factors, including the WTI price. While WTI prices at the
level forecast by EIA should, subject to the effect of the other prescribed variables, result in positive royalty
payments to the Trust, if such prices were to constitute the 2016 or 2017 twelve-month average WTI Price (that is,
the unweighted arithmetic average of the WTI price on the first day of each month during the year), such WTI
Prices would be lower than the 2015 twelve-month average WTI Price of $50.28. This may result, subject to the
effect of the other prescribed variables, in substantial decreases in the value and the estimated life of the Trust as
calculated for such periods compared to the 2015 calculations set forth under “THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND
FIELD – Reserve Estimates”."

@tmketner,


"If this was published, would have kept the run from happening. The WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, came
directly from EIA forecasts."


No, that is wrong, it was the average WTI price for 2015. as the 10-K states.


The projected future cash inflows of $11.59/unit. is based upon the assumption that WTI is $50.28 this
year and all years until termination. The last time that WTI was near this price was in Q1/ 15, when WTI
was almost $49, production was a little over 90,000 brls/ day and the distribution was $1.


We don't know what production numbers BPT uses in the $11.59/unit calculation, but for this year anyway,
it's probably not too far below 90,000, so they are probably assuming at least $.75/qtr in each quarter of
2016. Since one quarter is now passed, you need to subtract about $.75 from the $11.59 future amount,
keeping all other BPT assumptions the same, so you are now down to about $10.84 in future payments.
(You just had one quarter with a BIG negative variance from the $11.59 estimate.) This means that when
the numbers are updated in next year's 10-K, they will be starting with a remaining payment amount of
about $8.59 (11.59-4 x $.75).


But wait, what WTI will they use? It will be the 2016 average. So far, it has averaged in the mid 30's, and
even if oil recovers to above $50 by ye, there is a risk that a lower WTI will be used in next year's 10-K
estimate. This would further reduce the estimate below $8.59. This would understate the most likely
remaining payments, but how do you think BPT will react if the number next year is $5 or $6? It would also
show termination no later than 2020 and possibly 2019. CAS would have a field day with that number.

You guys need to review the recent filing more closely. I scoured this document cover to cover and unless oil
jumps dramatically and stays at that level this dividend is going to get crushed because of the way the trust is
structured. The cost per barrel starts escalating really fast from here. There were several analysis done by some
SA contributors over the past couple of years that warned investors on this. Look I'm not short on the stock. In fact,
I've been watching it for a long time and then when I read the filing and where the production costs are going I ran
from it. You want to own leaders in the oil industry. I'll write an article on that soon.


27 Apr 2016, 05:30 PM


tmketner
One of the reasons I am a fairly successful part-time investor is; I don't try to get rich quick, and I use facts
and logic to make my buy/sell decisions. I also do my own homework. I agree BPT is not a stock that I will
probably be holding in 2025 or even 2020. I know about the analyst's analysis and forecasts, because I
have read them all. Analysts make their decisions based off of current data, and try to predict future data
based off whatever. If I run a chart out of British Petroleum's (BP's) current operating cost for the field, at
the time of the filing, and then take the average price of WTI crude in 2015, BPT would be done in 2020 as
is filed. This is what the filing was letting investors know. They do this all the time. In 2011, with the 2011
data, it was 2027. Oil was crazy expensive, and they can only use the current year info for the filing.


Two things would happen if I took a huge pay cut, or lost my job. First thing I would do is cut expenses for
the short-term, hoping a turn around was coming. I don't want to do anything rash, and I really love my 6-
Series, so it is staying. Quick things like Kobi Beef, big vacation plans, etc. not going to happen. Current
expenditures can stay, just no new major ones. At some point there will be an OMG moment, where I am
into my savings hard, payments may be missed, and now I am making even less money. At this moment,
no matter how much I love my 6-Series, it is gone, and I am driving something I can easily afford. This is
where BP was, during the time of the filing, but not seeing much production cost savings yet. Wheels don't
turn quickly at big corporations, and the filing must contain current year data. Every oil company has been
slashing like crazy to cut costs, and they continue to do so across the board. Even with a dramatic
increase in oil prices, I think oil company's are going to keep that mentality for a while. Especially into
2017-18 as budgets, and projects are set. Find me an analyst that charts that out correctly, and I may let
him give me advice.[For the 2020 timeline to be realized, the average cost for a barrel of WTI-Crud oil, has
to be (Quote directly from the filing), "West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $50.28 per barrel, taxes
and costs". The average cost is derived from the data-point date, outlined in filing, (sometime at the end of
2015) to 2020. Not going to happen Bubba.] During our slash and cut period, an easy expenditure cut is
exploration. That is a new expense. Every major country except the US is at peak production, with no new
exploration expenditures. We have a few wannabe's and posers like Iran, but that will not in the near term,
outpace demand. They have a lot of work, and terrorists to deal with, before they are at full production.


The thing that scares me the most, is Saudi's comments on Monday. This was the actual tipping point on
my decision to go from a big position in oil, to go big-big on oil. The statement everyone knows by now,
that the goal for the Saudi economy, will to no longer be reliant on oil by 2030. The Saudi's do not share



https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
their well data and reserves with anyone. At this point it is all guesses. My gut tells me the Saudi's just
gave us a clue to production declines, and they will no longer be able to produce enough to run the
economy after 2030. Of course that is a guess, but my little voice is nagging me about it. Even if my guess
is wrong, cheap oil is bad. There is a limited amount, and world demand is outpacing what we can find.
Analyst's can talk about Tesla all day, but how many Indian's and Chinese are you going to find driving one
at $40 oil. If oil is not above $150 a barrel, and real soon, we are going to get caught with our pants down.
Just like America in the 70's, but on a global scale. China and India are growing too fast, with governments
that have to please the people as a whole. You find me an analyst that will chart that closest, and I will say,
"Nice to meet you Mr. Buffett." (Or the analyst that works for him).


With all this in mind, with no absolutes until years in the future, why was there a run on the stock? The
answer is, market manipulation by CAS to cover a short. I think people realize that, there are no short term
issues with dividends, and we are getting close to minimum price point for the 2020 date to expand
outward, so the stock is actually bouncing again. We all know that BPT will not pay forever. In 2011 we got
a year of 2027, this year we have 2020. They must provide the year, based on current year data.
Tomorrow that data will not be current. Normally I would not spend any time with this, but I cannot stand
cheats and liars. I work very hard, and earn a very good living. I will retire with no worries. Whether CAS
actually broke any law, I don't know, and it is not my job to say. I didn't lose money, but they cost me
money, and a lot of it. If I lost that money, because I made a mistake, I can live with that. They cheated to
win. A company willing to do that, and that blatantly, is bad. It will catch up to them, I can guarantee it. If
you are a client of theirs, why did they have to? That is what I would be asking myself. Next time their
really bad pick, will not have some manipulated data, they can feed to the masses, and it is going to bite
them. Run from them, if you are a client!!!

@Patrick,


"You need to go back and tell Bill he has to adjust his opinion by five years.
http://seekingalpha.co..."


I'm not sure exactly what you are referring to, but in the article you linked, I said in a comment dated
March 3, 2015 (over a year ago.): 
"You can get back to us in one decade. It will have terminated, or at least almost terminated by then."


What do I need to adjust by 5 years?

So if your analysis correct, what options does an investor like me have? I bought BPT in October 2015 with a very
big part of my retirement savings at $53/unit. OK - I'm stupid. Without arguing my stupidity, what are my options
and your recommendations:
1. Sell now, take my losses and probably lose my home?
2. Hold for a while to see what actually happens?
3. ?????


Thank You

You are why what CAS did, is borderline criminal, and absolutely unethical. My advice to you is, don't buy
stocks you can't afford to lose 10% on. My personal philosophy, is to sell a stock if it drops 10% from the
top, and stays there for a while, outside of no news "swings". Not what I bought it at necessarily, but from
what any upside gains are/were. Next piece of advice; Don't buy stocks. Especially because you need to
ask the questions you did. If you have words in your life like "retirement", and "could lose my house" if this
goes bad, invest in low risk funds. You are not going to make a lot of money, but unless you really work
hard, and do your own homework, you are giving your money away. Don't react buy to a single person's
advice on the internet, and that includes me. Unless you do your own homework, you never know what a
person's agenda is. I know this doesn't help you now right now.


This is the best I can do. At this moment, people are skittish on BPT, and there is a lot of bad press out
there. I believe the downside to BPT, at least for the time being, is a lot less than potential upside.
Especially if oil keeps going. That being said, my risk tolerance is higher than yours. Logically, the people
buying back in, are the ones that know what I know. BPT was a fat cow, with real potential. I bought it at
around $20 and it hit $33 in a little over a month. Then CAS crapped on it with misleading news, and to
cash in big on their short. They are going to make money as long as Oil keeps moving in the right
direction, plus dividend is really good. I moved a ton of money into a spread of big oil Mon before the
close, and kept my BPT position. Monday night I didn't sleep, and kept a watch on china. BP came in big

on Tuesday morning. That is what I did, but you need to make these decisions for yourself, and do your
own homework. I don't know what I would do today, because I am long on everything I got. Everyone is
waiting on Chevron and Exxon to report. If they beat loss expectations, like most everyone else is in the oil
sector, BPT will move up with them.

If you bought BPT depending on income to help pay for your home, I feel sorry for you - that was a terrible
decision to make - way, way too risky of a play with money you can't afford to lose. Not a financial adviser,
but I own this too - only option I see is to wait it out - oil *is* going to come back, it's inevitable. I wanted
out before costs started rising in 2018, still do, but if distributions go higher may hold on for a little longer
than planned to at least get my initial investment back - any profits would just be gravy. Nobody pays
attention to DCF for trusts like this - look at GNI - retail still owned it right up until the trust terminated,
yields had soared to over 50%.

When Super Shorter CAS wrote the article on Mar 9th, which caused the run on BPT, they failed to mention major
facts. BPT gets paid off the first 90K barrels produced everyday. The trust has no operating cost, and has a tiny
amount of debt. I knew about the information CAS mentioned, but I saw a lot of upside, if oil recovered as I
expected. That is why I put a large position into BPT, when the stock was at $20. BPT did the right thing with the
filing, warning at current oil valuations, longer term low oil prices, and market sentiment, there is a possibility... Oil
was only going south, and had been for a while, when this was filed.


FACTS:
CAS had a huge short position at $16, that was closing out in less than a month. The stock was around $35, when
the aritcle was published, and only going up.
Where oil went BPT followed suit.. Before
The paragraph quoted in the article, does not start at the beginning of the sentence, or quote the filing word for
word, except for that paragraph.


I can say with certainty, and for example, I will just use the year 2020, if the sun were to no longer produce light in
2020, life on the planet will not be able to sustain itself after 2020, and the world is going to end.


Someone can write an article that says: tmketner says with certainty, the sun will no longer produce light in 2020,
"life on the planet will not be able to sustain itself after 2020, and the world is going to end". I am only quoting a
portion, and the rest is context.


CAS put some context into the article, and this is how it was done... BP Prudhoe Bay said that based on the
average 2015 twelve month average West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $50.28 per barrel, taxes and
costs, it is estimated that “royalty payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2020, and would be zero in



https://seekingalpha.com/user/634467

https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
the following year. Therefore, no proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust
after that date.”


CAS added that in its opinion, based on the filing, the undiscounted future cash flow value of BPT would be $11.59
per share. At $35/share and heading higher. No way to cover a $16 short. I wonder if any sleep was lost? It was a
massive spin campaign, to drive the price down, and make a ton of $$. On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and
never looked back. It rose with price of oil. I wonder if they came up with the scheme before the short, or after they
knew it would miss? Shame!!


BPT is a great stock if you like dividends, and at higher oil prices, an amazing stock. Like I said earlier. They get
paid on the first 90K barrels per/day, so as long as prices keep going up, and the field is profitable, the dividend
will continue. It is true the field is producing 5.5% less than 10 years ago, but they are still pulling 508 million
barrels/day out of there. BPT is going to be around awhile, and at higher oil prices, a great way to earn $$. What
CAS did, IMHO, is borderline criminal, and absolutely unethical. Luckily I have Seeking Alpha alerts set, and I was
able to get out with a little profit. I bought it again at around $13, because I think oil prices are going to go back up
in a big way. Watch for articles, written about this stock, especially from a shorter.

"CAS had a huge short position at $16, that was closing out in less than a month. The stock was around

I didn't see any information on when and at what cost CAS got in and out of BPT. Can you direct me to the
source of that info.?


I'm going to post some other questions/ comments separately.

@tmketner,


"The trust has no operating cost, and has a tiny amount of debt."


The Trust Is the debt!!! (for BP). BPT does not fit the traditional definition of a Royalty Trust. It was created
to finance BP's activity at Prudhoe Bay and is basically a bond, but with a payment formula to a large
extent based upon the price of oil. It's structured exactly like a bond with a bank Trustee etc. The Trust has
no employees/management just like a bond doesn't.


It doesn't have operating expenses just like a bond doesn't have operating expenses. The variable rate the
"bond" (BPT) is paying will almost undoubtedly stay low and terminate in 5-7 years due to the increasing
Adjusted Chargeable Cost BP is able to retain before passing the excess on to the Trust holders.

the @tmketner,


"BPT is a great stock if you like dividends"


BPT doesn't pay a dividend, it pays a distribution. Conceptually, much of the payment is a 'Return of
principal," not income. It's like holding an amortizing mortgage near the end of its life, where most of the
payment you receive is return of principal, not income. Unlike a bond (or hopefully most stocks), you don't
get your original investment back at the end; payments will just cease one day.

"On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and never looked back."


Come out from under your rock, or get your dates right - BPT closed $32.50 on 3/7, crashed to $17.88 on
3/10 after CAS first reported the language that trust may not have any reserves past 2020 based on $50
WTI (if you owned BPT, it was a real shocking piece of news) and it hasn't traded higher than $18 and
change since then. That news was another nail in the coffin for many folks heavy in the energy sector
(moi) - if oil doesn't recover in 12-18 months (many signs point that it will), there will be mass carnage in
the sector, beyond what has already occurred - companies going BK, banks getting killed on loan defaults
- it's going to be very ugly.


28 Apr 2016, 10:58 AM


tmketner
STS... Seriously? I know you are smarter than that.


"On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and never looked back."


This comment was bringing to the forefront that CAS missed its $16 price-point. The stock did not drop
again until the article they published, forcing the run. In most cases, "contributors" only re-published the
offending paragraph, not even the entire article.

tmketner,


Is it your view that BPT is a good investment at current price levels?


If so, have you built a model of the future trust payments?


In your model what assumptions are you using for the following items:

Oil and Tech King
This trust is a bad investment today that retail buyers are getting sucked into. My dad owned this back in the 80's
and it wasn't a bad play for a good long while. The real issue is the dramatic escalation in production costs that are
going to kill this dividend going forward - unless oil goes up dramatically - and even if it did there are 100 other
stocks to buy with great dividends and will track oil prices linearly.


27 Apr 2016, 04:14 PM


tmketner
BPT did track with oil prices linearly, before CAS needed to cover their missed short, and caused a run on
it. Not only that, it gets paid on the first 90K barrels/day, and has almost zero debt. With 508 MBLS/day,
and only a 5.5% output reduction in 10 years, this was/is a great investment for the next few years.


Oil and Tech King, please share what other stocks you are referring to. I really am interested in
investigating them. BPT gets paid first, has a great dividend, no debt, and was linear with oil. CAS got
greedy, sold their soul, and now people are skittish. This stock is way undervalued right now, especially
with oil's rapid recovery, and higher oil prices imminent. This is going to happen much sooner than you
think.

This is a rough one to short. Is BPT overvalued? Almost certainly. But the next distro will be an easy 50 cents. The
ramp up in costs that will kill the trust is still far enough out that many of the lemmings will ignore this. Next year
the shorts may make a lot of money but 2016 will be tough on them.


27 Apr 2016, 12:07 PM


patricklirish
Yep and its never easy to stay short this stuff. The huge interest fees can kill the best shorts as we saw
with the GNI trust. Sometimes the annual rate is over 50%, an automatic 100% loss if held for two years. If
you thought the longs were dumb for holding something that is likely to go down 50%, what does that say
for the shorts?


27 Apr 2016, 03:10 PM


The Troll under the Pipeline, Contributor
thats right, as of now, you cannot short this thing for the duration to termination and make money. Heck,
there is enough enthusiasm from the BPT fan club on the interwebz, I may even take a small long position
for a few weeks going into the next distribution announcement if BPT stays at current prices!


28 Apr 2016, 03:09 PM


tmketner
Of course you're short!!! Funny how the stock dip today coincided with the exact timing of your article. Luckily it
bounced back. No one knows where the price of oil is going. We are addicted to it, and there isn't much of it. How
did the TopCo analysis go? Does your analysis take into consideration $200 oil? I am glad I didn't listen to the
"experts", Mon. before close. I wouldn't have bet on oil across the board, and I would be kicking myself right now.
You didn't dump your short when you had the chance, because you were "waiting for $15 corn", so article number
2 on BPT. The dividend is good, and this is a pretty cheap hedge on very expensive oil. When the Saudi's say
things like, they want their economy to not be driven by oil by 2030, it is time to buy oil. They just told you when
their supply is going to run out. The world is not going to change it's oil gluttony, until oil is over $150 a barrel, and
it keeps running up. BPT pulls off the top, for the first 90K barrels. Their debt is nothing and they have a great
dividend. You shouldn't be able to write these articles if you are short or long on a stock. I know your position is
stated, but you cannot be biased. Just like I am not biased because I went long again at the bottom. You short
sellers cost me almost all of my gains from this stock, a couple of months ago. Oil is a great bet at $44, just like it
was when I jumped on it at $29.

Dividend was good? Is that a joke? A measly 7 cents a share - the lowest ever for the trust!

Oil is heading back to $30ish. I think oil stocks are a traders market between $28-45 for the short to medium term.

@tmketner,


"Oil has to get to $150/ barrel and soon."


Well if that happens, then BPT would be a good pick, but that seems to be way outside what anyone is projecting.
The shale oil and renewables industries basically didn't exist in '05, when you were dealing with BP, and even with
oil below $100 a couple of years ago, US production was going up by 1/2-1 million brls./day each year. Cost of
shale production keeps dropping, and in the $50-60.WTI range, production will most likely start growing
dramatically again.


You would be amused to read some of the comments under the Solar City and Tesla articles. Some of the
enthusiasts there seem to think we'll be running on renewables in 10-20 years. They have interpreted Saudi
Arabia's recent comments and actions in an entirely different way than you; they don't think the Saudi's will be able
to find any buyers for their oil in 20 years. One of my favorite quotes is "the stone age didn't end because we ran
out of stones."


Taking the middle road and evaluating BPT on the basis of the oil futures curve seems to be a reasonable

@Bill
BPT is a very small portion of my portfolio. Everyone knows oil has to bounce, and the distribution is going
to be garbage for now. The sting is still very fresh from CAS Investment Partners play. This writer will find
no love, owning a short position, and bashing this stock. I was new to BPT and bought it at $20. I figured a
major move in oil or supply issue could make this an ok pick. I have a pretty good sense of when to get in,
and when to get out. I got a phone alert during a meeting that BPT, which was hovering near mid 30's the
night before, was rocket dropping. I dumped before the close, so I didn't actually lose money. That train
was not stopping. 
Nothing changed with that stock. No new data. The stock tanked because of an article written by CAS,
who had a $16 short, closing out in a 1 1/2 weeks. Sentiment was going the wrong way, and they knew it.
It was biased, could very well be way off the mark, and slanted to make a run. You have a short position,
and you write an article about how everyone should run for the hills again. You are going to get some heat.
I bought back in at $13. The reason the stock is going back up, because we already know all of the data.
Owners of BPT, at the time of CAS's play, know what CAS Investment Partners did. 
If oil doesn't move, then you are right, not a great pick. If oil moves big, could be an OK one. We will know
when we know. I read articles ways oil could go back down, and ways it could go to triple digits by the end
of 2016. I obviously feel it is going up, because I am vested heavily in oil. Would like to mention, so are big
banks, as well as Buffett. I heard today, Buffett just moved a bunch more money into it. WTI-Crude was up
pretty good across the board after the close today. I am not sure how it is doing now. We will see how the
sector does when XOM reports.

So many shale workers have been laid off, so many rigs stacked in boneyards, that it will take an
estimated 12-18 months for them to ramp up production once it becomes profitable to do so - over 100k
people out of work in the sector, many of which probably moved on to other jobs, may not come back and
risk getting laid off again. Boom towns are now ghost towns - nobody is going to jump back in feet first
when oil recovers, the pain of this slump was too much for many to endure.

Your comments actually paint a more bullish scenario for more oil price recovery. If the domestic shale

typically over swings in free markets. And this time will probably be the same. Today is June 2nd and WTI
closed at $49.05, decent recovery since the lows in Feb. I'm not a bull or a bear but oil prices are not
static.


02 Jun 2016, 04:57 PM


tmketner
There is a lot of creep in multiple directions, so I wanted to bring the main topic back.


Really bad price of oil = shorter lifetime of the payments, as well as a lower payments.
Amazing price of oil = longer lifetime of the payments, as well as higher payments.


The way CAS reported this, the world was coming to an end, and flee for the hills!!! This was done to cover a short
at $16, when the stock was running at around $33, and heading up.


In 2011 BPT reported the payments would end in 2027
In last years report, the payments would end in 2028
This year it is 2020


Everyone knows the price of oil has tanked. If you believe like me, that the world is going to see a sharp increase
in the price of oil in the next few years, then BPT was a fairly cheap way, and still is, into a Trust. Nothing is 100%,
but pretty much guaranteed payouts (at least in the short-term). Maybe not as much with the price of oil the way it
was, but with really high oil prices, this is a good pick.


Can you find other investments, that pay $$ on your shares, absolutely. I am probably invested in them as well, but
this topic is BPT.


I have stated many times in other comments, so I will try not to rehash too much. Oil has to get to $150/ barrel and
soon. I don't care how much, and how fast we can suck it out of the ground. I did a project with BP back in '05, and
I will never forget what one of their engineers told me. To find any new oil now, we have to go to the deepest parts
of the ocean, or the worst hell holes on the globe, and you can pretty much bet someones going to die. The world
is not going to change its consumption habits, at $40 oil.


NOT FOR THE DAY TRADER OR RETIRING SOON
New exploration has stopped because of the price drop. It is the easiest expense to cut, besides laying people off.
Wells go dry all the time, maybe not a field, but you have to re-drill another location in that field. We have a glut
right now, but we are at max production everywhere but the US, and demand is increasing. Not sure if you know
how long you can pump from a well, but you have to keep ahead of it, to keep production levels up. Finding new
well locations and exploration, has not been happening because of the price drop. It will start again as everything
balances, but there will be a gap. During that gap, oil prices are going to sky-rocket. Demand will also have risen
during that time, which will exacerbate the situation.


I am long on most of the majors, as well as others I see potential in. About 70% of my portfolio is in some kind of
oil. Even if it drops again, I went 40% into oil at $29, and hopefully I wont need that $$ for a really long time. Don't
get caught looking for another "bottom". It is not coming.

This was never mentioned, and what was used for the 2020 calculation!!


"While energy price forecasts are highly uncertain, EIA forecasts that Brent and WTI crude oil prices will both
average $38 per barrel in 2016 and $50 per barrel in 2017."


If this was published, would have kept the run from happening. The WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, came directly
from EIA forecasts.


At the end of my editorial, I have included information from 3 paragraphs, with no omissions. I start from the
paragraph above the one which is the highly quoted, and the one directly after. There are a lot of factors outside
these paragraphs, that could affect the price as well, both positive and negative.


CAS Investment Partners was screwed, stuck with a bad investment that was closing out in 1 1/2 weeks, and
heading the wrong direction. What they published, and how it was slanted, pushed this stock to a favorable
outcome for them. They made a killing, and as a company, are unethical as they come!! This spread like wild fire,
and we still have writers with short positions, trying to do what CAS did. Do you know what the price of oil is going
to be next quarter, or average for the year?


PARAGRAPH BEFORE THE MUCH QUOTED PARTIAL PARAGRAPH
"The estimated future net revenues and present value of estimated future net revenues reported herein are
calculated based on a single average WTI price, that being the average of 12 WTI values, each value representing
the WTI price in effect on the first calendar day of the month for the 12 months prior to January 1, 2016. As a
result, any single calculation of a calendar day will not reflect the value of the dividend paid to the Trust for any
quarter, nor will it reflect the estimated future value of the Trust or the estimation of how long royalty payments to
the Trust will continue."


OFFENDING PARAGRAPH
Based on the 2015 twelve-month average WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, current Production Taxes, and the
Chargeable Costs adjusted as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, it is estimated that royalty
payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2020, and would be zero in the following year. Therefore, no
proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust after that date. Even if expected
reservoir performance does not change, the estimated reserves, economic life and future net revenues attributable
to the Trust may change significantly in the future as a result of sustained periods of change in the WTI Price, the
Production Tax or from changes in other prescribed variables utilized in calculations as defined by the Overriding
Royalty Conveyance. Such changes could result in the termination of royalty payments prior to 2020.


PARAGRAPH AFTER AND THE MOST IMPORTANT
"While energy price forecasts are highly uncertain, EIA forecasts that Brent and WTI crude oil prices will both
average $38 per barrel in 2016 and $50 per barrel in 2017. As discussed under “THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND
FIELD – Reserve Estimates”, the amount and value of reserves attributable to the Trust and the estimated life of



https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
the Trust fluctuate based on changes to certain prescribed factors, including the WTI price. While WTI prices at the
level forecast by EIA should, subject to the effect of the other prescribed variables, result in positive royalty
payments to the Trust, if such prices were to constitute the 2016 or 2017 twelve-month average WTI Price (that is,
the unweighted arithmetic average of the WTI price on the first day of each month during the year), such WTI
Prices would be lower than the 2015 twelve-month average WTI Price of $50.28. This may result, subject to the
effect of the other prescribed variables, in substantial decreases in the value and the estimated life of the Trust as
calculated for such periods compared to the 2015 calculations set forth under “THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND
FIELD – Reserve Estimates”."

@tmketner,


"If this was published, would have kept the run from happening. The WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, came
directly from EIA forecasts."


No, that is wrong, it was the average WTI price for 2015. as the 10-K states.


The projected future cash inflows of $11.59/unit. is based upon the assumption that WTI is $50.28 this
year and all years until termination. The last time that WTI was near this price was in Q1/ 15, when WTI
was almost $49, production was a little over 90,000 brls/ day and the distribution was $1.


We don't know what production numbers BPT uses in the $11.59/unit calculation, but for this year anyway,
it's probably not too far below 90,000, so they are probably assuming at least $.75/qtr in each quarter of
2016. Since one quarter is now passed, you need to subtract about $.75 from the $11.59 future amount,
keeping all other BPT assumptions the same, so you are now down to about $10.84 in future payments.
(You just had one quarter with a BIG negative variance from the $11.59 estimate.) This means that when
the numbers are updated in next year's 10-K, they will be starting with a remaining payment amount of
about $8.59 (11.59-4 x $.75).


But wait, what WTI will they use? It will be the 2016 average. So far, it has averaged in the mid 30's, and
even if oil recovers to above $50 by ye, there is a risk that a lower WTI will be used in next year's 10-K
estimate. This would further reduce the estimate below $8.59. This would understate the most likely
remaining payments, but how do you think BPT will react if the number next year is $5 or $6? It would also
show termination no later than 2020 and possibly 2019. CAS would have a field day with that number.

The go forward yield is 2%! Oil has to be over $50-70 a barrel for any meaningful dividend to be paid!

You guys need to review the recent filing more closely. I scoured this document cover to cover and unless oil
jumps dramatically and stays at that level this dividend is going to get crushed because of the way the trust is
structured. The cost per barrel starts escalating really fast from here. There were several analysis done by some
SA contributors over the past couple of years that warned investors on this. Look I'm not short on the stock. In fact,
I've been watching it for a long time and then when I read the filing and where the production costs are going I ran
from it. You want to own leaders in the oil industry. I'll write an article on that soon.

One of the reasons I am a fairly successful part-time investor is; I don't try to get rich quick, and I use facts
and logic to make my buy/sell decisions. I also do my own homework. I agree BPT is not a stock that I will
probably be holding in 2025 or even 2020. I know about the analyst's analysis and forecasts, because I
have read them all. Analysts make their decisions based off of current data, and try to predict future data
based off whatever. If I run a chart out of British Petroleum's (BP's) current operating cost for the field, at
the time of the filing, and then take the average price of WTI crude in 2015, BPT would be done in 2020 as
is filed. This is what the filing was letting investors know. They do this all the time. In 2011, with the 2011
data, it was 2027. Oil was crazy expensive, and they can only use the current year info for the filing.


Two things would happen if I took a huge pay cut, or lost my job. First thing I would do is cut expenses for
the short-term, hoping a turn around was coming. I don't want to do anything rash, and I really love my 6-
Series, so it is staying. Quick things like Kobi Beef, big vacation plans, etc. not going to happen. Current
expenditures can stay, just no new major ones. At some point there will be an OMG moment, where I am
into my savings hard, payments may be missed, and now I am making even less money. At this moment,
no matter how much I love my 6-Series, it is gone, and I am driving something I can easily afford. This is
where BP was, during the time of the filing, but not seeing much production cost savings yet. Wheels don't
turn quickly at big corporations, and the filing must contain current year data. Every oil company has been
slashing like crazy to cut costs, and they continue to do so across the board. Even with a dramatic
increase in oil prices, I think oil company's are going to keep that mentality for a while. Especially into
2017-18 as budgets, and projects are set. Find me an analyst that charts that out correctly, and I may let
him give me advice.[For the 2020 timeline to be realized, the average cost for a barrel of WTI-Crud oil, has
to be (Quote directly from the filing), "West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $50.28 per barrel, taxes
and costs". The average cost is derived from the data-point date, outlined in filing, (sometime at the end of
2015) to 2020. Not going to happen Bubba.] During our slash and cut period, an easy expenditure cut is
exploration. That is a new expense. Every major country except the US is at peak production, with no new
exploration expenditures. We have a few wannabe's and posers like Iran, but that will not in the near term,
outpace demand. They have a lot of work, and terrorists to deal with, before they are at full production.


The thing that scares me the most, is Saudi's comments on Monday. This was the actual tipping point on
my decision to go from a big position in oil, to go big-big on oil. The statement everyone knows by now,
that the goal for the Saudi economy, will to no longer be reliant on oil by 2030. The Saudi's do not share



https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
their well data and reserves with anyone. At this point it is all guesses. My gut tells me the Saudi's just
gave us a clue to production declines, and they will no longer be able to produce enough to run the
economy after 2030. Of course that is a guess, but my little voice is nagging me about it. Even if my guess
is wrong, cheap oil is bad. There is a limited amount, and world demand is outpacing what we can find.
Analyst's can talk about Tesla all day, but how many Indian's and Chinese are you going to find driving one
at $40 oil. If oil is not above $150 a barrel, and real soon, we are going to get caught with our pants down.
Just like America in the 70's, but on a global scale. China and India are growing too fast, with governments
that have to please the people as a whole. You find me an analyst that will chart that closest, and I will say,
"Nice to meet you Mr. Buffett." (Or the analyst that works for him).


With all this in mind, with no absolutes until years in the future, why was there a run on the stock? The
answer is, market manipulation by CAS to cover a short. I think people realize that, there are no short term
issues with dividends, and we are getting close to minimum price point for the 2020 date to expand
outward, so the stock is actually bouncing again. We all know that BPT will not pay forever. In 2011 we got
a year of 2027, this year we have 2020. They must provide the year, based on current year data.
Tomorrow that data will not be current. Normally I would not spend any time with this, but I cannot stand
cheats and liars. I work very hard, and earn a very good living. I will retire with no worries. Whether CAS
actually broke any law, I don't know, and it is not my job to say. I didn't lose money, but they cost me
money, and a lot of it. If I lost that money, because I made a mistake, I can live with that. They cheated to
win. A company willing to do that, and that blatantly, is bad. It will catch up to them, I can guarantee it. If
you are a client of theirs, why did they have to? That is what I would be asking myself. Next time their
really bad pick, will not have some manipulated data, they can feed to the masses, and it is going to bite
them. Run from them, if you are a client!!!

So if your analysis correct, what options does an investor like me have? I bought BPT in October 2015 with a very
big part of my retirement savings at $53/unit. OK - I'm stupid. Without arguing my stupidity, what are my options
and your recommendations:
1. Sell now, take my losses and probably lose my home?
2. Hold for a while to see what actually happens?
3. ?????


Thank You

tmketner
You are why what CAS did, is borderline criminal, and absolutely unethical. My advice to you is, don't buy
stocks you can't afford to lose 10% on. My personal philosophy, is to sell a stock if it drops 10% from the
top, and stays there for a while, outside of no news "swings". Not what I bought it at necessarily, but from
what any upside gains are/were. Next piece of advice; Don't buy stocks. Especially because you need to
ask the questions you did. If you have words in your life like "retirement", and "could lose my house" if this
goes bad, invest in low risk funds. You are not going to make a lot of money, but unless you really work
hard, and do your own homework, you are giving your money away. Don't react buy to a single person's
advice on the internet, and that includes me. Unless you do your own homework, you never know what a
person's agenda is. I know this doesn't help you now right now.


This is the best I can do. At this moment, people are skittish on BPT, and there is a lot of bad press out
there. I believe the downside to BPT, at least for the time being, is a lot less than potential upside.
Especially if oil keeps going. That being said, my risk tolerance is higher than yours. Logically, the people
buying back in, are the ones that know what I know. BPT was a fat cow, with real potential. I bought it at
around $20 and it hit $33 in a little over a month. Then CAS crapped on it with misleading news, and to
cash in big on their short. They are going to make money as long as Oil keeps moving in the right
direction, plus dividend is really good. I moved a ton of money into a spread of big oil Mon before the
close, and kept my BPT position. Monday night I didn't sleep, and kept a watch on china. BP came in big

on Tuesday morning. That is what I did, but you need to make these decisions for yourself, and do your
own homework. I don't know what I would do today, because I am long on everything I got. Everyone is
waiting on Chevron and Exxon to report. If they beat loss expectations, like most everyone else is in the oil
sector, BPT will move up with them.

If you bought BPT depending on income to help pay for your home, I feel sorry for you - that was a terrible
decision to make - way, way too risky of a play with money you can't afford to lose. Not a financial adviser,
but I own this too - only option I see is to wait it out - oil *is* going to come back, it's inevitable. I wanted
out before costs started rising in 2018, still do, but if distributions go higher may hold on for a little longer
than planned to at least get my initial investment back - any profits would just be gravy. Nobody pays
attention to DCF for trusts like this - look at GNI - retail still owned it right up until the trust terminated,
yields had soared to over 50%.


28 Apr 2016, 11:07 AM

When Super Shorter CAS wrote the article on Mar 9th, which caused the run on BPT, they failed to mention major
facts. BPT gets paid off the first 90K barrels produced everyday. The trust has no operating cost, and has a tiny
amount of debt. I knew about the information CAS mentioned, but I saw a lot of upside, if oil recovered as I
expected. That is why I put a large position into BPT, when the stock was at $20. BPT did the right thing with the
filing, warning at current oil valuations, longer term low oil prices, and market sentiment, there is a possibility... Oil
was only going south, and had been for a while, when this was filed.


FACTS:
CAS had a huge short position at $16, that was closing out in less than a month. The stock was around $35, when
the aritcle was published, and only going up.
Where oil went BPT followed suit.. Before
The paragraph quoted in the article, does not start at the beginning of the sentence, or quote the filing word for
word, except for that paragraph.


I can say with certainty, and for example, I will just use the year 2020, if the sun were to no longer produce light in
2020, life on the planet will not be able to sustain itself after 2020, and the world is going to end.


Someone can write an article that says: tmketner says with certainty, the sun will no longer produce light in 2020,
"life on the planet will not be able to sustain itself after 2020, and the world is going to end". I am only quoting a
portion, and the rest is context.


CAS put some context into the article, and this is how it was done... BP Prudhoe Bay said that based on the
average 2015 twelve month average West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $50.28 per barrel, taxes and
costs, it is estimated that “royalty payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2020, and would be zero in



https://seekingalpha.com/user/634467

https://seekingalpha.com/user/43128516
the following year. Therefore, no proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust
after that date.”


CAS added that in its opinion, based on the filing, the undiscounted future cash flow value of BPT would be $11.59
per share. At $35/share and heading higher. No way to cover a $16 short. I wonder if any sleep was lost? It was a
massive spin campaign, to drive the price down, and make a ton of $$. On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and
never looked back. It rose with price of oil. I wonder if they came up with the scheme before the short, or after they
knew it would miss? Shame!!


BPT is a great stock if you like dividends, and at higher oil prices, an amazing stock. Like I said earlier. They get
paid on the first 90K barrels per/day, so as long as prices keep going up, and the field is profitable, the dividend
will continue. It is true the field is producing 5.5% less than 10 years ago, but they are still pulling 508 million
barrels/day out of there. BPT is going to be around awhile, and at higher oil prices, a great way to earn $$. What
CAS did, IMHO, is borderline criminal, and absolutely unethical. Luckily I have Seeking Alpha alerts set, and I was
able to get out with a little profit. I bought it again at around $13, because I think oil prices are going to go back up
in a big way. Watch for articles, written about this stock, especially from a shorter.

Bill Cunningham, Contributor
@tmketner,


"The trust has no operating cost, and has a tiny amount of debt."


The Trust Is the debt!!! (for BP). BPT does not fit the traditional definition of a Royalty Trust. It was created
to finance BP's activity at Prudhoe Bay and is basically a bond, but with a payment formula to a large
extent based upon the price of oil. It's structured exactly like a bond with a bank Trustee etc. The Trust has
no employees/management just like a bond doesn't.


It doesn't have operating expenses just like a bond doesn't have operating expenses. The variable rate the
"bond" (BPT) is paying will almost undoubtedly stay low and terminate in 5-7 years due to the increasing
Adjusted Chargeable Cost BP is able to retain before passing the excess on to the Trust holders.

the @tmketner,


"BPT is a great stock if you like dividends"


BPT doesn't pay a dividend, it pays a distribution. Conceptually, much of the payment is a 'Return of
principal," not income. It's like holding an amortizing mortgage near the end of its life, where most of the
payment you receive is return of principal, not income. Unlike a bond (or hopefully most stocks), you don't
get your original investment back at the end; payments will just cease one day.

"On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and never looked back."


Come out from under your rock, or get your dates right - BPT closed $32.50 on 3/7, crashed to $17.88 on
3/10 after CAS first reported the language that trust may not have any reserves past 2020 based on $50
WTI (if you owned BPT, it was a real shocking piece of news) and it hasn't traded higher than $18 and
change since then. That news was another nail in the coffin for many folks heavy in the energy sector
(moi) - if oil doesn't recover in 12-18 months (many signs point that it will), there will be mass carnage in
the sector, beyond what has already occurred - companies going BK, banks getting killed on loan defaults
- it's going to be very ugly.


28 Apr 2016, 10:58 AM


tmketner
STS... Seriously? I know you are smarter than that.


"On Jan. 20 the stock lowed at $18.20 and never looked back."


This comment was bringing to the forefront that CAS missed its $16 price-point. The stock did not drop
again until the article they published, forcing the run. In most cases, "contributors" only re-published the
offending paragraph, not even the entire article.

tmketner,


Is it your view that BPT is a good investment at current price levels?


If so, have you built a model of the future trust payments?


In your model what assumptions are you using for the following items:

1. WTI oil price deck
2. CPI / inflation
3. Decline curve for the production in the field


Based on your model what is the projected IRR of buying BPT at its current ~$15.85 price?

28 Apr 2016, 03:31 PM


Oil and Tech King
This trust is a bad investment today that retail buyers are getting sucked into. My dad owned this back in the 80's
and it wasn't a bad play for a good long while. The real issue is the dramatic escalation in production costs that are
going to kill this dividend going forward - unless oil goes up dramatically - and even if it did there are 100 other
stocks to buy with great dividends and will track oil prices linearly.


27 Apr 2016, 04:14 PM


tmketner
BPT did track with oil prices linearly, before CAS needed to cover their missed short, and caused a run on
it. Not only that, it gets paid on the first 90K barrels/day, and has almost zero debt. With 508 MBLS/day,
and only a 5.5% output reduction in 10 years, this was/is a great investment for the next few years.


Oil and Tech King, please share what other stocks you are referring to. I really am interested in
investigating them. BPT gets paid first, has a great dividend, no debt, and was linear with oil. CAS got
greedy, sold their soul, and now people are skittish. This stock is way undervalued right now, especially
with oil's rapid recovery, and higher oil prices imminent. This is going to happen much sooner than you
think.

This is a rough one to short. Is BPT overvalued? Almost certainly. But the next distro will be an easy 50 cents. The
ramp up in costs that will kill the trust is still far enough out that many of the lemmings will ignore this. Next year
the shorts may make a lot of money but 2016 will be tough on them.


27 Apr 2016, 12:07 PM


patricklirish
Yep and its never easy to stay short this stuff. The huge interest fees can kill the best shorts as we saw
with the GNI trust. Sometimes the annual rate is over 50%, an automatic 100% loss if held for two years. If
you thought the longs were dumb for holding something that is likely to go down 50%, what does that say
for the shorts?


27 Apr 2016, 03:10 PM


The Troll under the Pipeline, Contributor
thats right, as of now, you cannot short this thing for the duration to termination and make money. Heck,
there is enough enthusiasm from the BPT fan club on the interwebz, I may even take a small long position
for a few weeks going into the next distribution announcement if BPT stays at current prices!


28 Apr 2016, 03:09 PM


tmketner
Of course you're short!!! Funny how the stock dip today coincided with the exact timing of your article. Luckily it
bounced back. No one knows where the price of oil is going. We are addicted to it, and there isn't much of it. How
did the TopCo analysis go? Does your analysis take into consideration $200 oil? I am glad I didn't listen to the
"experts", Mon. before close. I wouldn't have bet on oil across the board, and I would be kicking myself right now.
You didn't dump your short when you had the chance, because you were "waiting for $15 corn", so article number
2 on BPT. The dividend is good, and this is a pretty cheap hedge on very expensive oil. When the Saudi's say
things like, they want their economy to not be driven by oil by 2030, it is time to buy oil. They just told you when
their supply is going to run out. The world is not going to change it's oil gluttony, until oil is over $150 a barrel, and
it keeps running up. BPT pulls off the top, for the first 90K barrels. Their debt is nothing and they have a great
dividend. You shouldn't be able to write these articles if you are short or long on a stock. I know your position is
stated, but you cannot be biased. Just like I am not biased because I went long again at the bottom. You short
sellers cost me almost all of my gains from this stock, a couple of months ago. Oil is a great bet at $44, just like it
was when I jumped on it at $29.
