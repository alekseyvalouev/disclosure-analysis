Business

Summary


RST	management	is	using	questionable	financial	reporting	practices	which
significantly	overstate	the	financial	performance	of	the	business.


In	Q4	2013,	RST	changed	its	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	a	methodology	which
significantly	inflates	performance	via	aggressive	deferred	revenue	add-backs.


A	more	reasonable	method	for	calculating	EBITDA	indicates	that	management’s	FY
2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance	of	$18mm	-	$22mm	is	overstated	by	at	least
$22mm.


In	addition	to	aggressive	financial	reporting,	RST’s	business	has	continued	to
deteriorate	due	to	competitive	pressures.


RST	shares	are	overvalued	by	over	40%	at	the	current	price	level.


At	first	glance,	Rosetta	Stone	(NYSE:RST)	appears	to	be	at	the	beginning	stages	of	a
turnaround.	On	October	29th,	RST	released	its	Q3	2014	earnings	report	which	seemed	to
indicate	positive	progress	at	the	business.	During	Q3	2014,	total	bookings	increased	by
16%	y-o-y	to	$82.1mm.	Although	much	of	this	growth	in	bookings	was	driven	by
acquisitions,	Consumer	bookings	rebounded	in	the	quarter	and	investors	were
encouraged	by	the	10%	organic	bookings	growth	reported	for	the	Enterprise	&	Education
(E&E)	segment.	The	Company	also	reiterated	the	low-end	of	its	FY	2014	full	year
bookings	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance	of	$315mm	to	$325mm	and	$18mm	to	$22mm,
respectively.	In	addition	to	the	perceived	positive	earnings	report,	Osmium	Partners	has
recently	stepped	up	its	efforts	as	an	activist	investor	in	the	Company.	Over	the	past	couple
months,	the	firm	has	increased	its	stake	in	RST	to	10.67%,	gained	a	board	seat	at	the
Company	and	released	a	four-point	action	plan	to	guide	RST	management	in	its
turnaround	efforts.	Based	on	recent	share	price	performance,	investors	appear	to	be
encouraged	by	these	developments	at	the	Company.	Since	reporting	Q3	2014	earnings
on	October	29th,	RST	shares	have	increased	by	~29%	from	$8.19	to	$10.53	per	share
today	(as	of	December	19th).

I	believe	that	the	recent	appreciation	in	the	Company's	share	price	has	been	unwarranted.
After	examining	RST's	financial	reporting	methods,	I	discovered	that	the	Company's
performance	has	been	greatly	aided	by	a	recent	change	in	its	methodology	for	calculating
Adjusted	EBITDA.	In	Q4	2013,	RST	changed	its	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	a
method	which	books	future	profits	to	current	EBITDA.	Due	to	this	change,	RST's	reported
YTD	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	results	are	significantly	inflated	relative	to	the	Company's
actual	performance.	By	using	a	more	reasonable	method	of	calculating	Adjusted	EBITDA,
I	estimate	that	the	Company's	current	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance	of	$18mm	to
$22mm	is	overstated	by	over	$22mm.	The	Company's	aggressive	financial	reporting
methods	have	helped	to	mask	the	continued	deterioration	of	the	overall	business	from
investors	and	sell-side	analysts.	Due	to	the	continued	decline	in	RST's	overall	business
and	the	inflated	nature	of	the	Company's	historical	financial	performance,	I	believe	that
RST	shares	are	overvalued	by	over	40%	at	the	current	share	price.


A	Quick	Lesson	In	Bookings,	Deferred	Revenue	and	Deferred	Expenses


Before	I	dive	into	my	analysis	of	RST's	financials,	I	believe	it	would	be	helpful	for	readers	if
I	first	explained	the	concept	of	bookings,	deferred	revenue	and	deferred	expense.	I
believe	clarifying	this	concept	is	important	because	I	will	be	referring	to	it	throughout	the
article.


Bookings	is	simply	the	amount	of	contracts	that	RST	signs	in	a	given	year.	Bookings	are
either	recorded	immediately	as	revenue	or	recognized	over	time.	Revenue	that	is	not
immediately	recognized	is	referred	to	as	deferred	revenue.


When	RST	signs	a	subscription-based	contract,	they	typically	receive	cash	upfront	before
the	actual	service	is	delivered.	Thus,	a	deferred	revenue	liability	is	created	on	the	balance
sheet	and	amortized	over	time	as	revenue.	For	example,	if	the	Company	signs	a	$9mm
contract	to	be	recognized	over	3	years,	RST	would	receive	and	recognize	$9mm	of	cash
on	its	balance	sheet.	On	the	liability	side,	the	Company	would	then	book	a	$9mm	deferred
revenue	liability.	The	deferred	revenue	liability	will	be	amortized	on	a	straight-line	basis
over	3	years	as	revenue	in	the	P&L.


On	the	expense	side,	when	RST	signs	a	subscription-based	contract,	it	also	pays	sales
commission	to	its	sales	team.	This	cash	is	paid	upfront	and	then	the	expense	is	amortized
over	the	life	of	the	contract.	For	example,	if	the	Company	signs	a	$9mm	contract	for	3
years,	they	might	pay	out	$3mm	of	cash	in	sales	commission	upfront.	Thus,	the	Company
would	deduct	$3mm	from	the	balance	sheet.	At	the	same	time,	the	Company	would

recognize	a	$3mm	deferred	sales	commission	asset	on	the	balance	sheet.	This	deferred
sales	commission	asset	will	be	amortized	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	3	years	as	a	sales
&	marketing	expense	in	the	P&L.


To	provide	further	clarification,	I	have	provided	below	a	breakdown	of	how	a	$9mm
contract	flows	through	the	P&L,	balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	statement	over	time:


RST's	New	Definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	Has	Mislead	Investors


Management's	current	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	is	misleading	and	has	grossly
inflated	the	Company's	FY	2014	financial	results.	In	Q4	2013,	the	Company	changed	its
definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	from	a	revenue-based	metric	to	a	bookings-based	metric.
The	Company	ties	Adjusted	EBITDA	performance	to	bookings	growth	by	including	an
adjustment	for	the	change	in	deferred	revenue	liability.	For	example,	if	deferred	revenue
increases	from	$90mm	one	quarter	to	$100mm	in	the	next	quarter,	the	Company	will
include	a	change	in	deferred	revenue	adjustment	which	increases	Adjusted	EBITDA	by
$10mm.


In	FY	2014,	RST	has	focused	on	signing	an	increasing	number	of	multi-year	contracts.	As
a	result,	this	has	boosted	the	Company's	bookings	in	FY	2014,	and	in	turn,	has	increased
its	deferred	revenue	liability.	As	a	result	of	the	increase	in	deferred	revenue	liability,	YTD
FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	has	been	artificially	inflated.	I	have	included	a	simple
illustration	below	which	demonstrates	why	a	greater	proportion	of	multi-year	contracts	has
artificially	inflated	Adjusted	EBITDA	results.

The	above	analysis	is	based	on	a	6-year	timeframe.	For	the	first	3	years,	I	assume	that
the	Company's	customers	only	sign	1-year	contracts	amounting	to	$100mm	of	bookings
per	year.	However,	starting	from	Year	4,	I	assume	that	the	Company	converts	10%	of	its
existing	customers	to	3-year	contracts.	Overall,	I	have	assumed	that	the	Company	has
remained	stable	and	does	not	gain	or	lose	any	customers	during	the	6-year	timeframe.


As	you	can	see	from	the	analysis	above,	in	Year	4,	there	is	a	large	increase	in	deferred
revenue	due	to	the	conversion	of	just	a	small	percentage	of	their	customers	to	multi-year
contracts.	Deferred	revenue	increased	from	$50mm	in	Year	3	to	$70mm	in	Year	4.	This
represents	a	40%	increase	in	deferred	revenue	and,	in	turn	a	$20mm	increase	in	Adjusted
EBITDA.	However,	this	increase	in	deferred	revenue	and	the	positive	impact	on	Year	4
Adjusted	EBITDA	is	misleading	because	the	actual	business	performance	has	not
changed.	As	you	can	see,	revenue	has	remained	flat	at	$100mm	in	Year	4	and	remains	at
that	level	for	the	next	two	years.	At	the	same	time,	the	Company's	Adjusted	EBITDA
declines	$10mm	in	Year	5	and	an	additional	$10mm	in	Year	6.	Basically,	the	Company	is
giving	back	the	artificial	increase	of	$20mm	in	Adjusted	EBITDA	that	was	recognized	in
Year	4.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2775165-rosetta-stone-misleading-financials-mask-continued-deterioration-in-business 5/14


The	takeaway	from	this	analysis	is	that	RST's	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	performance
has	been	artificially	inflated	due	to	the	large	increase	in	deferred	revenue	created	by	its
focus	on	multi-year	contracts.	Due	to	the	deferred	revenue	add-back,	the	Company	is
essentially	cheating	by	pulling	in	revenue	from	future	years	into	FY	2014	Adjusted
EBITDA.	Another	takeaway	from	this	analysis	is	that	Adjusted	EBITDA	performance	in
subsequent	years	may	be	pressured	relative	to	FY	2014	results	due	to	the	"give-back"	of
the	inflated	deferred	revenue	adjustment	in	FY	2014	(as	shown	above	in	Year	5	and	Year
6).	Thus,	investors	should	view	the	Company's	current	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA
guidance	of	$18mm	to	$22mm	with	a	high	degree	of	skepticism.	As	I	will	discuss	in	the
next	section,	based	on	a	more	reasonable	and	commonly	accepted	definition	of	EBITDA,
FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	is	projected	to	be	significantly	less	than	management
guidance.


Adjusted	EBITDA	Performance	Has	Declined	Substantially


In	Q4	2013,	the	Company	switched	its	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	the	current
bookings-based	method	that	I	have	described	in	the	section	above.	Prior	to	this	switch,
the	Company	was	actually	using	a	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	that	was	better
representative	of	Company	performance	and	was	based	on	commonly	accepted
accounting	principles.	During	its	Q2	2014	earnings	call,	RST	management	was	asked	why
it	had	changed	its	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	the	current	method	that	is	utilized
today.	It	responded	with	the	following	explanation:


"…And	I	think	we've	talked	a	little	bit	about	this	before,	when	you	buy	these
businesses	through	purchase	accounting,	you've	got	to	write	down	the	deferred
revenue	that	they	have	on	their	balance	sheet	at	the	opening	--	on	our	balance
sheet.	Then	we	take	them	in	to	fair	value,	which	is	nominal.	It's,	basically,	the	hosting
costs	associated	with	the	duration	of	the	deferred	revenue	that	were	on	their	books.
And	so	you're	taking	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	of	deferred	revenue	that	in	the
absence	of	the	transaction	would	have	continued	to	flow	off	the	balance	sheet	into
the	P&L,	and	basically,	resetting	that	to	near	0.	And	so	we're	in	a	process	of	building
that	up.	It's	one	of	the	main	reasons	why	we	pivoted	this	year	to	a	bookings-based
metric	of	adjusted	EBITDA	versus	revenue-based,	because	the	revenue	for	this	year
and,	probably,	for	the	next	12	to	24	months	is	really	not	a	good	indicator	for	the
business	activity	that's	occurring	in	the	business.	We	think	bookings	are	the	best
indicator	of	that,	and	so	that's	why	we've	pivoted	to	that	metric."

In	the	quote	above,	management	states	that,	due	to	purchase	accounting	requirements,
the	Company	had	to	write-down	the	deferred	revenue	of	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	upon
acquisition.	As	a	result	of	this	write-down,	GAAP	revenue	recognized	from	Lexia	and	Tell
Me	More	has	been	artificially	depressed.	Thus,	management	states	that	they	switched	to
the	current	bookings-based	definition	of	Adjusted	EBITDA	in	order	to	compensate	for
revenue	lost	due	to	these	acquisition	write-downs.


Unfortunately,	management's	explanation	for	why	it	changed	its	definition	of	Adjusted
EBITDA	does	not	make	much	sense.	The	reason	is	because	its	prior	method	for
calculating	Adjusted	EBITDA	already	included	adjustments	which	added-back	the	exact
amount	of	deferred	revenue	that	was	lost	from	the	acquisition	write-downs.	For	example,	if
Lexia's	revenue	excluding	the	write-down	was	$20mm	but	actual	reported	Lexia	revenue
was	$10mm,	RST	would	include	an	add-back	of	$10mm	in	its	calculation	of	Adjusted
EBITDA.	The	current	method,	on	the	other	hand,	got	rid	of	the	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More
write-down	add-backs	and	replaced	them	with	a	more	aggressive	add-back	based	on	the
total	change	in	RST's	deferred	revenue	liability.	For	reasons	which	I	outlined	in	the	prior
section,	this	method	of	adding	back	the	total	change	in	deferred	revenue	significantly
inflates	and	misrepresents	RST's	Adjusted	EBITDA	performance.	Thus,	I	believe	that	the
prior	method	of	calculating	Adjusted	EBITDA	is	a	better	gauge	of	RST's	financial
performance.


The	figure	below	provides	a	side-by-side	comparison	of	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA.	The
left	side	calculates	Adjusted	EBITDA	based	on	the	current	definition.	The	right	side	is
based	on	the	old	definition.

As	can	be	seen	in	the	figure	above,	the	amount	of	the	add-backs	to	FY	2014	Adjusted
EBITDA	is	drastically	different	between	the	two	definitions.	Management	stated	that	most
of	the	deferred	revenue	add-back	in	the	current	definition	can	be	attributed	to	the	reported
revenue	lost	from	the	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	acquisition	write-downs.	Thus,	this	large
discrepancy	in	the	size	of	the	add-backs	between	the	two	definitions	makes	little	sense.	I
have	provided	below	a	table	which	shows	the	implied	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	revenue
based	on	the	add-backs	in	the	new	definition	and	old	definition.


The	table	above	clearly	illustrates	that	the	amount	of	deferred	revenue	add-backs	in	the
new	definition	is	grossly	inflated.	Based	on	annualized	YTD	results,	I	estimate	that	FY
2014	reported	revenue	for	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	will	be	$8.3mm	and	$14.1mm,
respectively.	To	compensate	for	the	revenue	lost	to	the	acquisition	write-downs,	the	old
definition	includes	an	add-back	of	$11.7mm	for	Lexia	and	$12.2mm	for	Tell	Me	More.
Thus,	based	on	the	old	definition,	FY	2014	total	combined	revenue	from	Lexia	and	Tell	Me
More	will	be	$46.3mm.	This	represents	a	6.9%	increase	from	last	year.	By	contrast,	the
new	definition	includes	a	deferred	revenue	add-back	of	$52.3mm	to	compensate	for	the
revenue	lost	to	acquisition	write-downs.	Thus,	based	on	the	new	definition,	FY	2014	total
combined	revenue	from	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	will	be	a	whopping	$74.7mm.	This
represents	a	72.5%	increase	from	last	year!	This	amount	of	growth	in	Lexia	and	Tell	Me
More	revenue	is	simply	not	possible	based	on	the	revenue	and	bookings	trends	this	year
for	these	businesses.	The	reason	why	the	deferred	revenue	add-back	in	the	new	definition
is	so	inflated	is	because	the	Company	added	the	increase	in	deferred	revenue	of	the
entire	business	rather	than	just	the	deferred	revenue	lost	from	acquisition	write-downs.
This	example	clearly	illustrates	how	management	has	grossly	inflated	the	Company's
Adjusted	EBITDA	results	by	switching	to	the	new	definition.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2775165-rosetta-stone-misleading-financials-mask-continued-deterioration-in-business 8/14


Based	on	the	old	definition,	my	estimate	for	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	is	a	loss	of
$4.1mm.	This	implies	that	management's	guidance	of	$18mm	to	$22mm	in	FY	2014
Adjusted	EBITDA	is	overstated	by	at	least	$22mm!	Also,	this	helps	to	explain	how	YTD
FY	2014	net	income	has	deteriorated	significantly	compared	to	last	year	while	Adjusted
EBITDA	performance	is	magically	improving.	In	fact,	on	an	apples-to-apples	basis,
Adjusted	EBITDA	based	on	the	old	method	has	declined	from	$11.0mm	in	FY	2013	to	a
projected	loss	of	$4.1mm	in	FY	2014.	Overall,	this	does	not	paint	a	very	promising	picture
in	regards	to	the	current	financial	performance	of	the	business.


Due	to	Competitive	Pressures,	RST's	Business	Has	Continued	To	Struggle


RST's	poor	financial	performance	is	a	reflection	of	the	competitive	pressures	that	continue
to	weigh	down	its	business.	The	recent	bullish	sentiment	that	has	caused	the	stock	price
to	increase	27%	since	the	Company's	Q3	2014	earnings	report	is	quite	puzzling.	For
reasons	which	I	will	highlight	in	this	section,	I	believe	that	many	investors	are	mistaken	in
their	belief	that	the	recent	earnings	report	is	an	indication	that	RST	is	in	the	beginning
stages	of	a	strong	turnaround.


Based	on	the	Q3	2014	results,	the	Company's	Consumer	segment	continues	to	struggle.
Although	y-o-y	Consumer	bookings	increased	by	4%	in	the	quarter,	this	growth	was
largely	driven	by	dramatic	price	cuts.	The	figure	below	from	the	Company	Q3	2014
earnings	slides	shows	the	pricing	and	unit	volume	trend	of	the	Consumer	business:


In	addition	to	substantial	price	cuts,	Consumer	bookings	growth	this	quarter	was	also
aided	by	a	large	increase	in	sales	and	marketing	expense.	Sales	and	marketing	expense
increased	from	$34.8mm	in	Q3	2013	to	$43.8mm	in	Q3	2014.	As	a	result	of	the	price	cuts

and	sales	and	marketing	expense	increase,	profitability	of	the	Consumer	segment
declined	substantially	compared	to	last	year.	The	figure	below,	also	provided	in	the
Company's	Q3	2014	earnings	slides,	illustrates	this	point:


Many	investors	have	placed	a	significant	amount	of	value	on	the	RST's	E&E	business.
These	investors	believe	that	the	10%	organic	E&E	bookings	growth	reported	in	Q3	2014	is
an	indication	that	growth	in	this	segment	will	continue	to	accelerate	going	forward.	On	the
surface,	10%	organic	bookings	growth	is	encouraging.	However,	a	deeper	analysis
reveals	that	much	of	this	growth	was	aided	by	the	Company's	change	in	focus	to	signing
multi-year	contracts	instead	of	single-year	contracts.	For	example,	long-term	deferred
revenue	(to	be	recognized	greater	than	12	months	from	now)	as	a	%	of	total	deferred
revenue	increased	from	~20%	in	Q2	2014	to	~25%	in	Q3	2014.	Signing	a	greater
proportion	of	customers	to	multi-year	contracts	today	will	temporarily	boost	E&E	bookings
in	the	short	term,	but	long-term	bookings	growth	will	be	pressured	due	to	the	upfront
recognition	of	the	entire	amount	of	the	contract.	Thus,	it	is	highly	uncertain	whether	the
recent	organic	growth	in	E&E	bookings	can	be	sustained	over	the	long	term.	In	fact,	in
RST's	recent	Q3	2014	10Q,	the	Company	actually	acknowledged	that	E&E	bookings
growth	was	largely	due	to	signing	a	higher	proportion	of	multi-year	contracts:

bookings	are	increasing,	primarily	due	to	the	sales	of	multi-year	deals…"


It	should	be	mentioned	that	not	all	of	the	Company's	recent	results	were	negative.	The
Literacy	segment,	which	is	a	part	of	the	E&E	business,	has	grown	bookings	in	excess	of
25%	in	FY	2014.	This	segment	is	the	lone	bright	spot	in	RST's	business	based	on	the
robust	bookings	growth.	However,	the	segment	itself	is	less	than	10%	of	the	overall
business	from	a	revenue	perspective.	Thus,	although	growth	has	been	strong,	the	impact
on	the	overall	Company's	financials	is	very	limited	at	this	time.	This	segment	must	show
continued	growth	for	a	long	time	in	order	to	compensate	for	the	weakness	in	the	other
business	segments.


In	summary,	the	Consumer	segment's	profitability	continues	to	decline	due	to	competitive
pressures.	The	Company	has	significantly	increased	its	sales	&	marketing	expense,	but
this	has	not	translated	into	a	meaningful	acceleration	of	topline	growth.	Instead,	the
increase	in	expenses	has	been	accompanied	by	large	price	cuts	which	have	only	resulted
in	further	financial	losses.	This	is	a	strong	indication	that	RST's	services	are	becoming
increasingly	commoditized.	In	addition	to	this,	it	is	highly	questionable	whether	the	organic
bookings	growth	in	the	E&E	business	is	sustainable	over	the	long-term.	Recent	growth	in
the	Literacy	business	is	a	positive,	but	this	segment	currently	represents	just	a	small
portion	of	RST's	overall	business.	Thus,	there	is	no	indication	yet	that	a	sustainable
turnaround	in	RST's	business	has	occurred.


Valuation


Currently,	research	analyst	valuation	targets	for	RST	are	based	on	a	multiple	of	Adjusted
EBITDA.	However,	research	analysts	are	basing	their	Adjusted	EBITDA	projections	on	the
Company's	inflated	method	of	calculating	EBITDA.	As	I	have	shown,	based	on	a	more
reasonable	and	commonly	accepted	method	of	calculating	EBITDA,	FY	2014	Adjusted
EBITDA	will	most	likely	be	negative.	As	a	result,	a	valuation	of	RST	based	on	a	multiple	of
EBITDA	is	no	longer	relevant.


So	how	should	RST	be	valued?	As	I	have	discussed,	RST's	recent	Q3	2014	earnings
report	(released	on	October	29th)	showed	a	continued	deterioration	in	the	business.	Thus,
I	believe	that	RST	shares	should,	at	the	very	least,	retrace	back	to	a	valuation	in-line
with	the	recent	low	of	$7.54	per	share	on	October	10 .	Based	on	the	21.3mm	shares
outstanding	and	$49.4mm	of	net	cash,	the	implied	enterprise	value	at	this	share	price	is
$111.4mm.	Consensus	estimates	for	FY	2014	revenue	is	currently	$264mm.	Thus,	on

October	10th,	RST	was	trading	at	a	FY	2014	EV	/	Revenue	valuation	of	0.42x.	Due	to	the
misleading	nature	of	the	Company's	financials,	the	true	state	of	RST's	business	is
unknown	to	investors.	Given	this	uncertainty,	combined	with	the	continued
commoditization	of	the	Company's	services	and	loss	of	credibility	of	management,	I
believe	that	RST	shares	should	trade	at	a	discount	of	at	least	25%	to	the	recent	low.	A
discount	of	25%	results	in	an	implied	valuation	of	0.32x	FY	2014	EV	/	Revenue.	Applying
a	0.32x	multiple	to	projected	FY	2014	revenue	of	$264mm	results	in	an	implied	enterprise
valuation	of	$83.6mm.	Adding	net	cash	of	$49.4mm	results	in	an	implied	equity	valuation
of	$132.9mm.	Thus,	assuming	21.3mm	shares	outstanding,	I	believe	fair	value	for	RST
shares	to	be	approximately	$6.23	per	share.	This	represents	a	41%	discount	to	the
current	share	price	of	$10.53	as	of	market	close	on	December	19th.


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	note	that	I	have	reached	out	to	RST	investor	relations	via	phone	and	email
over	the	past	few	days.	As	of	now,	I	have	not	received	a	response	yet	regarding	my
concerns	over	its	accounting	methods.


Conclusion


Frankly,	I	am	shocked	that	RST	has	not	yet	been	called	out	for	its	misleading	definition	of
Adjusted	EBITDA.	I	believe	that	management	has	lost	a	significant	amount	of	credibility
due	to	its	highly	questionable	financial	reporting	practices.	Based	on	management
guidance,	investors	are	expecting	the	Company	to	generate	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$18mm
to	$22mm	in	FY	2014.	In	reality,	based	on	a	more	commonly	accepted	definition	of
EBITDA,	the	Company	will	generate	an	Adjusted	EBITDA	loss	of	$4.1mm	in	FY	2014.
This	fact	alone	is	reason	enough	to	sell	shares.	To	make	matters	worse	for	investors,	the
Company's	overall	business	has	continued	to	deteriorate	due	to	intense	competitive
pressures.	Unless	management	takes	dramatic	action,	the	Company	will	likely	continue	to
struggle	to	maintain	its	market	share.	Add	it	all	up,	and	it	is	clear	that	RST	is	significantly
overvalued	at	the	current	price	level.	Thus,	I	would	recommend	initiating	a	short	position
or	selling	shares	if	you	are	an	existing	RST	shareholder.


Appendix


Provided	below	is	a	more	detailed	explanation	of	how	I	calculated	the	FY	2014	Adjusted

In	order	to	calculate	the	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More	add-backs	to	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA,
I	had	to	come	up	with	a	reasonable	estimation	for	the	following:


1.	How	much	GAAP	revenue	will	be	recognized	for	Lexia	in	FY	2014
2.	If	there	was	no	deferred	write-down,	how	much	revenue	would	have	been	reported	for
Lexia	in	FY	2014


3.	How	much	GAAP	revenue	will	be	recognized	for	Tell	Me	More	in	FY	2014
4.	If	there	was	no	deferred	write-down,	how	much	revenue	would	have	been	reported	for
Tell	Me	More	in	FY	2014


Item	#1:	How	much	GAAP	revenue	will	be	recognized	for	Lexia	in	FY	2014?


For	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014,	the	Company	reported	GAAP	revenue	of	$6.2mm
from	Lexia.	By	annualizing	this	number,	this	implies	that	RST	will	report	$8.3mm	of
GAAP	revenue	from	Lexia	this	year.


Item	#2:	If	there	was	no	deferred	write-down,	how	much	revenue	would	have	been
reported	for	Lexia	in	FY	2014?


Provided	below	is	Lexia's	historical	financials	(prior	to	the	acquisition)	as	presented	in
RST's	July	24th,	2013	8K	filing:


As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	prior	to	the	acquisition	and	subsequent	deferred	revenue
write-down,	Lexia	was	projected	to	generate	approximately	$17mm	of	revenue	in	FY
2013.	Organic	YTD	bookings	growth	for	Lexia	this	year	has	been	in	excess	of	25%	(32%
in	Q3	2014).	However,	it	should	be	noted	that	Lexia's	contracts	are	generally	multi-year
contracts,	so	the	increase	in	Lexia's	FY	2014	revenue	from	the	bookings	increase	will	be
much	less.	Thus,	I	estimate	that	Lexia's	FY	2014	revenue	(assuming	no	write-down
of	deferred	revenue)	would	have	been	~$20mm.


Item	#3:	How	much	GAAP	revenue	will	be	recognized	for	Tell	Me	More	in	FY	2014?


In	RST's	Q3	2014	10Q,	the	Company	stated	the	following:

"…from	the	nine	months	ended	September	30,	2013	to	the	nine	months	ended
September	30,	2014…Global	Enterprise	&	Education	language	revenue	increased
$6.7	million,	$2.1	million,	$1.0	million,	and	$0.8	million	in	France,	the	US,	Germany,
and	the	UK,	respectively,	due	to	the	January	2014	acquisition	of	Tell	Me	More."


Based	on	this	quote,	the	Company	reported	$10.6mm	of	GAAP	revenue	from	Tell	Me
More	during	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014.	By	annualizing	this	number,	this	implies	that
RST	will	report	$14.1mm	of	GAAP	revenue	from	Tell	Me	More	this	year.


Item	#4:	If	there	was	no	deferred	write-down,	how	much	revenue	would	have	been
reported	for	Tell	Me	More	in	FY	2014?


In	RST's	December	11th,	2013	press	release,	the	following	information	was	provided:


"Approximately	95%	of	Tell	Me	More's	EUR18.5	million	($25	million)	business	is
focused	on	the	Corporate	and	Higher	Education	verticals."


Based	on	this	statement,	prior	to	the	acquisition	and	subsequent	deferred	revenue	write-
down,	Tell	Me	More	generated	~$26mm	of	revenue	in	FY	2013.	In	FY	2014,	Tell	Me
More's	business	has	not	demonstrated	much	growth.	Thus,	I	estimate	that	Tell	Me	More's
FY	2014	revenue	(assuming	no	write-down	of	deferred	revenue)	would	have
remained	flat	at	~$26mm.


Based	on	these	four	items,	I	was	able	to	calculate	the	estimated	deferred	revenue	and
sales	commission	add-back	to	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	for	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More:

I	agree.	While	the	management	has	been	pumping	the	stock	with	confusing,	misleading	financial	statement,	they	have
been	busy	selling	shares.	Look	at	insider	sales	in	Yahoo	Finance.	They	have	been	getting	free	shares	and	then	selling
them	mquickly,	while	they	together	own	insignificant	amount.	Can	you	trust	them	with	our	hard	earned	money?
