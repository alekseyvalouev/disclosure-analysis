Exact Sciences - The Rotten Sniff Test (1 Of 5)
Jul. 24, 2013 1:21 PM ET117 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) (EXAS or the "Company") is the Wisconsin-based
company behind the overhyped soon to fail colon cancer screening test known as
Cologuard. As such, we believe that the fair value for this persistently cash flow negative,
value-destroying Company is at best equal to the value of the cash on its balance sheet,
or less than $3 per share. We will demonstrate over the course of this series, why we feel
that the stock should be aggressively sold or shorted. This article is the first in a five part
series which will cover:


1. Why the Cologuard test is actually worse than currently available tests
2. Why the economics of the Cologuard test do not support reimbursement
3. Why almost nobody will use the Cologuard test even if it gets approved
4. Why the Cologuard test is no Pap Smear (the Bull case deconstructed)
5. How Exact Sciences has misled investors (for the third time)


In order to be successful, Exact Sciences will need to show that Cologuard is an effective
test, gain reimbursement, convince doctors to prescribe the test, and make a simple
enough test that patients will use it. We believe that they will fail at each of these tasks. In
this article, we will explain why we believe that the Cologuard test has a high probability of
being rejected by the FDA and why, in the unlikely event that it is even approved, it will
almost certainly be a commercial failure due to its lack of efficacy.


Exact Sciences would like investors to believe that Cologuard will revolutionize the
detection of colon cancer. The Company believes that Cologuard will replace the colon
cancer screening Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), just as the FIT has progressively
replaced the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) in recent years. To support this contention,
the Company has used a highly promotional slide deck in conversations with institutional
investors. Curiously (perhaps because Exact knows it is misleading?), a copy of this slide
deck has never been filed with the SEC. To aid investors, we have posted a copy of it
here.


Cologuard Is Actually Less Effective And More Expensive Than FIT


Exact Sciences highlights its contention that the Cologuard test is superior to the current
standard of care, the FIT, by touting Cologuard's sensitivity and specificity. The Company
reports the results of the Cologuard test as having a cancer sensitivity of 92%, a pre-

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 2/35


cancer sensitivity of 42%, and a specificity of 87%. In contrast, Exact Sciences claims that
the FIT has a cancer sensitivity of just 66%, a paltry pre-cancer sensitivity of 20%, and a
specificity of 95%. A higher sensitivity and a higher specificity are better. A copy of the
Company's slide with the FIT's performance is below:


In order to see how EXAS has misrepresented Cologuard, we need to review two
important statistical concepts when evaluating a medical test: sensitivity and specificity.
According to the Company's recent press release conveying its results, "Sensitivity
measures a test's ability to correctly identify positive results. It is the percentage of
patients who were determined by colonoscopy to have pre-cancerous polyps or cancer
that had a positive Cologuard test result. Specificity measures a test's ability to correctly
identify negative results. It is the percentage of patients who were determined by
colonoscopy not to have pre-cancerous polyps or cancer that had a negative Cologuard
test result."


While it seems from the data that the Cologuard test is better than the FIT, nothing could
be further from the truth. In fact, the FIT, when properly administered, is superior to
Cologuard. Exact Sciences hides this statistical fact by not providing an apples-to-apples
comparison. When compared over the same number of years, the FIT proves to be more
effective in identifying colon cancer. This article will clearly explain why.


Let's start by reviewing in a table format what Exact Sciences would like investors to
believe:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 3/35


First, it is important to consider the vastly different frequency with which these tests are
meant to be administered. According to Exact, Cologuard is designed to be administered
every three years and is expected to cost $400, per Canaccord Genuity's May 27, 2017
EXAS research report (see excerpt here). In contrast, the FIT is designed to be
administered annually and costs $23 ($69 over three years) per the same report. This
difference in frequency is incredibly important. The sensitivity and specificity of the
Cologuard test should be compared to the sensitivity and specificity of the FIT
administered each year for three years (the cumulative efficacy of the FIT). We know that
even Exact Sciences believes it is important to consider the cumulative efficacy of a test,
because they do so in their presentation on slide 20 as can be seen here:


When you normalize the FIT and Cologuard tests for their frequency, the FIT shows itself
to be superior to Cologuard in nearly every aspect. Over a three-year time period, the FIT
is better at finding cancer and misses fewer potential cases.


Below is the expected performance of the Cologuard test in a 10,000 patient group,
identical to what the company used in its DeepC test.  This assumes that the test is given
once every three years, as suggested by the Company. Below it, we show the FIT being
administered to those same patients every year for three years.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 4/35


Even based on the data that the Company highlights, investors should clearly understand
that Cologuard significantly underperforms FIT:


FIT finds 61 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
FIT finds 367 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
FIT misses 388 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
FIT results in 1,310 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


When compared on an apples-to-apples basis, the FIT outperforms Cologuard on the
three most important metrics. The lone exception is unnecessary colonoscopies, where it
is a mere 10% worse.


Exact Sciences Uses Old, Obsolete Data To Show A More Favorable Result For
Cologuard


To make things worse, the Company chose data from an outdated FIT study that
happened to be the single worst study we could find from the last 10 years. We identified
6 other trials that on average, inclusive of the trial that Exact used in its presentation (a
total of 7 trials), shows that the FIT has 77% sensitivity to cancerous tumors, 39%
sensitivity to pre-cancerous lesions, and 95% specificity.  When these average
representations of the FIT are used, the Cologuard test looks even worse in comparison:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 5/35


Here is the expected performance of the FIT based on the average performance in the
trials we identified:


Using this average data, we can now see that in all cases the FIT appears to be even
more effective than originally thought:


FIT finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
FIT finds 579 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
FIT misses 174 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
FIT results in 1,277 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


In fact, after only two years of testing the FIT is already outperforming the Cologuard test:


After two years, FIT finds 60 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
After two years, FIT finds 469 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
After two years, FIT misses 286 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard
misses 441
After two years, FIT results in 872 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results
in 1,194


Exact Sciences Ignores the 800lb Gorilla In The Room: The InSure FIT

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 6/35


Now we would like to introduce the InSure FIT. While the FIT is a good test, the InSure FIT
is even better and is the current leader in take-home FIT testing. Importantly, because of
the quantity of stool needed for Cologuard, it will be almost exclusively a take-home test -
more on this in part 3. The InSure FIT has 88% sensitivity to cancerous polyps, 43%
sensitivity to precancerous polyps, and 97% specificity, which can be seen here. A
comparison between Cologuard and InSure would be as follows:


These are the results that we would expect from the InSure FIT using the identical 10,000
patient group:


Using the InSure FIT as the comparator, Cologuard underperforms every single end point:


InSure finds 64 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
InSure finds 610 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
InSure misses 142 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
InSure results in 905 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


In fact, the InSure FIT outperforms the Cologuard test only two years into the three-year
testing cycle:

After two years, InSure finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
After two years, InSure finds 504 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
After two years, InSure misses 249 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard
misses 441
After two years, InSure results in 614 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard
results in 1,194


Exact Sciences Hid Data From Its Pivotal Trial


The mystery of the FIT comparison does not stop there. There are two other oddities
regarding the Cologuard trial. First, it appears that Exact administered a FIT in its DeepC
trial in order to compare the two tests in an identical patient population. Exact clearly
states a FIT was administered as a comparison here. Exact then chose not to disclose the
data generated in its trial and chose to instead use an outdated 2005 FIT study done in
Japan by Morikawa as the comparator test. In our experience, this type of sleight of hand
is performed when a company wants to distract investors from potentially troubling results.
Further, in order to make Cologuard look better, the Company chose the FIT-CHEK test as
the FIT comparator in the DeepC trial, even though FIT-CHEK only uses one fecal sample
and is primarily administered in doctor's offices, which is a different setting from
Cologuard's. If the Company had instead used the InSure FIT, which like Cologuard is a
take-home test, it would probably have doomed Cologuard.


In addition to choosing an irrelevant FIT as the comparator for Cologuard, the Company
also chose not to report the results of the FIT included with Cologuard. As can be seen on
see slide 14 posted below, Cologuard actually includes a FIT, the results of which can be
separated from the Cologuard test as a whole to see whether the expensive DNA testing
actually adds any value above and beyond the FIT included with Cologuard. Bizarrely, we
don't know which FIT is included with Cologuard, so the supposedly positive DeepC trial
results may simply reflect a better FIT included with Cologuard. We would be shocked if
these data are not available, and believe that their exclusion suggests there is insignificant
value to the DNA testing, not to mention how little value it seems to add for an extra 17x
the cost of the FIT alone.

Making Up Numbers To Make Cologuard Look Better


We now again call attention to slide 20, which contains the unusual language "Not based
on clinical evidence." We find this a curious, weird, and misleading way to tout the efficacy
of a test - tell everyone how great it will be over a 9-year period and then back away from
your claims with the disclaimer that they're not based on clinical evidence. If the claims are
not coming from clinical evidence, then where are they coming from? Hopes and dreams?
Here is the relevant portion of the slide once again:

If You Thought That It Couldn't Get Any Worse…


We want to leave with one last telling sleight of hand in the information that Exact has
been disseminating. We have already posted slide 18 from the June 2013 presentation
above. We now highlight slide 16 from the May 2013 presentation, which can be found
here. At first glance, it looks like the same slide. However, after taking a closer look, we
can see that for the FIT statistics, Exact provided a range in May (with two sources). Now
going back to slide 18 from the June presentation Exact drops the second source, which
happens to be more recent and more favorable to the FIT, and instead simply reports the
lower (and arguably outdated) end of that range. Here is a side-by-side comparison of the
two slides:


We do not believe that the FDA is likely to be as easily fooled as investors. Instead, we
suspect that they will ask the hard questions, such as which test is actually better, what do
the true historical comparisons really show, and what did the Company's own FIT results
show in the same population. We believe that as the true irrelevance of the Cologuard test
comes to light, it has a high likelihood of being rejected by the FDA. In the unlikely event
the test is approved, it will likely fail to gain adoption due to its poor predictive abilities.
Further, we intend to submit a citizen's petition to the FDA outlining why Cologuard should
not be approved.


More To Come


This article, the first in a five part series, began by illustrating that regardless of the set of
data that you use, the Cologuard test is inferior to the FIT. Going forward, we are excited
to continue our takedown of EXAS's lofty claims regarding its Cologuard test. Next we will
discuss the economics of the Cologuard test, and why they don't support reimbursement.
That will be followed by a detailed argument explaining why we feel that very few doctors
will actually prescribe the Cologuard test even if it gets approved. Our fourth installment

Smear. Finally, we will dive further into the facts, and explain how Exact Sciences has
misled investors (again). Stay tuned.


Notes:


1. The test comparison makes the following assumptions:


10,000 patients over the age of 50 are tested
Based on the company's DeepC trial, the expectations for positive tests for cancerous
and precancerous polyps for this age group is approximately 0.64% and 7.52%
respectively
The Cologuard test is given once every three years, while the FIT is given every year

Unfortunately, this is yet another one of those ANONYMOUS authored articles that Seeking Alpha supports. I wouldn't
be surprised if it was coming from some of the 10.2 million shares of short interest that have been completely buried
by the recent surge in the share price of EXAS.


Seeking Alpha seems to come out with one of these "hit" pieces just about every week now on EXAS.


Rather than wait for the publication of the Deep-C clinical data in a peer-reviewed journal later this year, this
anonymous author makes a lot of claims that have no basis in fact. They assume that they have seen ALL of the
clinical data from the FDA study, when they have not seen anything more than "top-line" numbers... Notice how the
author conveniently ignores any Sensitivity for Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, or Stage 4 cancer.


In my opinion, this author (and SA) is swimming extremely close to libelous behavior. Can't wait to read the next part
of the 5-part series!

Actionable Conclusion, Contributor
So all of the short articles on SA are blasphemous lies, and all of the long articles are insightful and
balanced? Or are all of the articles both short and long blasphemous lies?


I read plenty of articles on SA slamming stocks I am long on, and I laugh. If one has confidence in the
foundation and quality of their respective stock holdings, then they are not alarmed or insulted when someone
else sees things differently.


SA is a great site, and offers a great deal of insight to its readers. It is up to us as individuals to discern what
we read. That is the way of the world. Why should it be any different here on SA?

The problem with SA is that the bar is set incredibly low and unsuspecting noobs and novices may be
unaware of just how poorly these articles are written. The level of INTEGRITY at SA is quite lacking in my
opinion. 
The "anonymous" author and poor disclosure policy pretty much says it all, but wait.... it gets worse. 
Their staff (who oversee the articles that get published) have absolutely ZERO background in biotech, life
sciences, or medical diagnostics. As a result, they allow just about anything to be printed. They claim that

they have certain "criteria" to meet, but given the terribly misinformed article such as this one from "Alpha
Exposure" on Exact Sciences, or the most recent one that was published over the weekend by "Weighing
Machine" dated Feb. 7th, it's quite clear that the bar is horribly low in regards to any kind of FACT CHECKING
whatsoever. Moreover, if you have an "issue" with coming across a flat-out lie, misinformation, or erroneous
data or claim in an article, their support staff suggests that you send in a message to their Customer Service
Department. 
In other words, there is absolutely ZERO fact-checking by SA whatsoever. Nothing ever gets corrected or
gone back and be edited. They don't care. And they are very well aware that any CEO worth his salt won't
even bother stooping so low as to call SA out with legal action. 
As a result, there is no threshold for journalistic integrity. It's like the Wild Wild West! Shoot first, ask questions
(and/or) clean up the "mess" later.  
First rate TABLOID journalism??? 
It's pretty damn close in my opinion. Just a notch up from a Yahoo Finance Message Board. The rubbish that
they have allowed to have been printed about EXAS (and by association the Mayo Clinic) is downright
disgusting. 
No accountability whatsoever, and based in Israel and out of the long arms of the SEC. How convenient.
Reader Beware.

Wow, impressive short attack, but I am long the stock and am waiting for short sellers to drive the stock down enough
to double down (I figure they will cover at about $12.50, the 50 day moving average where there is lots of support, so I
am putting in buy orders at $12.70). The company has plenty of money to launch Cologuard in the US once it is
approved (and it will be), and the conference call indicated good results for tests for esophagal and pancreatic cancer
as well. I view EXAS as a great long term holding, but these kinds of attacks do make the stock volatile. Hang in there

I suggest that you reread the Insure paper that you cited. Please look at what patients were given a colo and what

eradicating CRC.


Also, the Cologuard comparator is IFIT, so once the numbers are published we will know which test is superior.

Thank you for clarifying the comparator issue. So, as others have said, we'll need to wait for publication of
trial data. Seems the authors should just wait for the refined data release which, if their concerns/hypoth. are
valid, could rigorously support them.  
Though I have a small long position, I'm open to questioning any company's model, but the breathless to
hostile to desperate tone of this piece undermines its credibility.

Oh, and you have to change the calc for programmatic sensitivity if detection varies by stage (no longer a
simple multiplication--never really is). The simple programmatic sensitivity makes no sense if stage 1
sensitivity is 35%, precancer sensitivity is 12%, stage 3 sensitivity is 90% and  stage 4 sensitivity is 90%. I
think that this is self explanatory (what happens to test 2s population and corresponding sensitivity?).
Although you will approach catching 100% on their death bed. There is a reason companies pay Archimedes
to run the cost calcs f or them.

Author’s reply »  You are incorrect. The comparator was the OC FIT-CHEK. This is a much worse test than
the Insure FIT. Oddly, the company cherry-picked the worst FIT study from all the way back in 2005 from
Japan to use as its comparator in its slides.If the comparator had been the Insure FIT then I think Cologuard
would have failed


24 Jul 2013, 03:24 PM


dejerzeus
The Company has already stated their performance is better than FIT with statistical significance (both for
cancer and by a large margin for precancer), but have not given the exact #s. Using a 95% CI and the sample
size you can back into what it takes to achieve this. I'll give you a hint, FIT sensitivity is inline with the studies
that EXAS points to.  Saying that the outperformance was statistically significant should be enough data. I
have a feeling that the stage performance will make FIT look even worse. If someone cites papers, they
should have a clear understanding of the study and its implications.

looking for clarificaton: so the FIT CHEK data was used in slide, but IFIT was used in Deep-C? Went to

Author’s reply »  Actually, the company said that it was non-inferior to FIT on cancer and superior to FIT on
pre-cancer. The only reason it would be superior on pre-cancer is because Exact Sciences used an
inappropriate comparator, the OC FIT-CHEK. Against an appropriate comparator, such as the Insure FIT,
which has 43% pre-cancer sensitivity, Cologuard would not have been superior.

Nope, EXAS said non-inferior on the original call but then clarified that it is superior. Look through the
transcripts and more recent presos (I promise you that I'm right). The reason was that the Company did not
know that you could submit for superior designation if they cited the endpoint as non-inferior. They were
corrected by a statistician. I encourage you to check the transcripts.


They tested against an ultr-sensitive fit, not a FOBT test.

Author’s reply »  Since we only have headline numbers for Cologuard, it is impossible to make a comparison
with stages I-IV. Also, I believe that the prior comment was based on stages of cancer (I-IV) and not on pre-
cancer. Since there were only 64 patients with cancer in the entire DeeP-C trial, it would be impossible to
show a statistically robust measurement of cancer sensitivity broken out between stages I-IV.

strong preliminary, top-line trial results,” said Kevin T. Conroy, the company’s president and chief executive.
“We are extremely pleased with Cologuard’s achievement of superiority to the fecal immunochemical test or

(Friendly tone) Seems to me that one should look at the binning of these groups before saying that. Is it not
possible for results showing weighting towards more or less advanced cancers that would be statistically
meaningful? It would seem to me that they would have designed in enough power for such a stratification.


So you're comfortable with your analysis using headline numbers? Why not wait for the publication?

Author’s reply »  Even if they can now claim superior re: cancer detection, they are still making two very
misleading claims: 1) that you should compare a test given every 3 years to one given every year and 2) that
the OC FIT-CHEK is the right test to compare vs Cologuard


24 Jul 2013, 04:05 PM

Insure FIT is better than FOBT, yay! FOBT #s are very, very low. And take a closer read of the Insure study,
worthless. Again, you need to run an a complicated simulation to assess programmatic sensitivity and staging
matters, so a comparison of 3-year sensitivities can't be used. It is far superior, from all parties standpoints, to
have a more sensitive test.

right, a super sensitive FIT test, not the FOBT, which is what the Insure study compared against. Also the
Gold Standard FIT, I believe--but happy to be corrected (both have been on the market so I don't understand
how a crappier test would sell).


There is no comparison, at least that I'm aware of, between the FIT tests. The FOBT test is dated---you are
def right on that. The FITs should have similar performance. If I'm wrong, please give me the data, I'd love to
have a look, seriously.


In any case, I still have a problem with the Insure study. I advise re-reading and focusing on the # of colos that
were given and to whom. I think that it is terrible for general population estimates and can't be used to
extrapolate performance.


Thanks for the link.

Author’s reply »  So we disagree regarding whether or not the company used the correct comparator but now
you disclaim that the company used IFIT as per your prior comment and now claim that this is "a super
sensitive FIT" when the truth is that the OC FIT-CHEK has much worse sensitivity than the IFIT - for instance,
OC FIT-CHEK has 67% cancer sensitivity whereas IFIT has 88% cancer sensitivity.


24 Jul 2013, 04:58 PM


dejerzeus
I disagree with the IFIT 88% sensitivity. You are correct, I f'd up and said IFIT when I should have just left it at
the sensitive fit (which is what I kne), no excuse for that. However, the Insure study is flawed in my opinion
and they chose FOBT as their comparator, doing 33% better as they cite. Commerical FIT tests are all better
than FOBT tests. There are no direct studies with other FIT tests, and trust me the 66% was in a much more
rigerous study. For starters, everyone received a colo, not just patients that had a positive FIT or FOBT result
(or were symptomatic as defined--very small number).


If it were 88% sensitive in a general population, I would agree that it is substantially better than the OC FIT. I
just don't think the study is anywhere near meaningful. I would also think the insurance companies would
mandate i-fit, a large general population study would be funded, and someone would be up for the noble prize
if 88% was meaningful.

from your prozed study,


Test comparisons in cases screened by colonoscopy 
An estimate of true sensitivity can be obtained from results in those screening cases where colonoscopy was
performed (Table 4). Although numbers were relatively small, InSure was significantly more sensitive for
cancer (75% vs. 37.5%) and significant adenomas (27% vs. 15%). The positivity rate for those with a normal
colonoscopy appears high at 11.5% for InSure and 15.8% for Hemoccult, but these are biased because some
patients had a colonoscopy because they had had a positive FOBT.


and more, but really everything should be read, 
The true-positive rates observed in this study for those found to have cancer in either population are likely to
overestimate the true sensitivity of screen-detected cancers in the general population because the diagnostic
cohort was included. The design is powerful for determining relative sensitivity, as results are paired for these
tests. Better estimates of true sensitivity come from the screening population (Tables 3 and 4), although
because not everyone had a colonoscopy, results shown in Table 4 represent the upper limit of actual
sensitivity within the limitation of the number of detected cases. InSure is consistently significantly better at
detection and achieves a once-only sensitivity of 75% for cancer in the colonoscopy group (Table 4). It can be
anticipated that the better relative detection rate for InSure, through its better sensitivity for adenomas, would
have a greater impact on mortality and incidence rates.


Does no good if only the positive FITs take a colo.

but your own study says 75% and admits this can be high, so why 88%? Sensitivity needs to be determined
vs. the Gold Standard, colo, so 75% is the highest number that can be used. 
Also, i can't stress enough that multiplication does not solve the complex programmatic sensitivity number,

I guess I don't really follow the point of this article. Nothing here is "new" information. The logic of stating that a test
that will get "cancerous" readings wrong approximately 3 out of every 10 times is better than a test that is better than
something that will do so 7 out of a 100 is absurd. If FIT was so much better over a 3 year screening process.... why
isn't it done for every person as part of preventative care? Why haven't we seen the decline in CRC? Where is the top
line results from the Insure FIT clinical trial and was this done at the same level of roll out as the Deep C Trial?

There's a big problem with your thesis; in order for you to be able to extrapolate these higher sensitivities from repeat
testing, you have to assume that: All cancers and precancers are *potentially detectable* by the test in question.


This assumption is true for Cologuard, all cancers and precancers shed genetic material into stool. However this is
*not* true for FIT IFIT or FOBT tests which rely on the presence of blood in stool. Reference the Mayo Clinic's site on
Colon Cancer testing: http://mayocl.in/18DtYRt 
I'll quote from the section on "Fecal Blood Tests" (FIT & FOBT): "Although relatively easy, these tests are designed to
screen for cancer, not for polyps. One problem is that most polyps don't bleed, nor do all cancers."


Cancers that don't bleed can't be detected by these test no matter how many followup tests you run. So there's an
absolute cap on how sensitive these tests can become with repeat testing.


Worse, the proportion of non-bleeding (thus non-detectable by FIT) cancers is highest at the high value end of the
curve: Precancerous polyps and early stage cancers. In effect these tests are good at telling you you're going to die
and not so good at helping you deal with the disease while it's still treatable.

support such a belief.

again, what are the statistics for the insure test when a colo is used? Not 42% for pres and not 88% for
cancers. The upper limits are 75% and 27% and the author stresses that these estimates are high (see quote
below)


also, what does insure define a precancer as? ah, they define significant adenomas as" high-grade dysplasia,
villous change, ≥10 mm, serrated histology or ≥3 polyps.


Do you know what sensitivity Cologuard detects high-grade dysplasia with? >70%!


and again,


from the article that you cite,

if it were only a simple multiplication. And what about pre cancer detection (really changes if you don't use
42%)? Yes, FIT is 100% going to guarantee that we treat the sickest patients (that generally have low survival
rates) with the most expensive medication at the same or better rate than Cologuard! Do you think biotechs
and the FDA pay Archimedes to multiply 3 numbers?


And I'm not arguing, I'm just providing excerpts from your favorite study, which contradict the super fit
performance. And of course morikawa will have the worst #s, just like Deep-C will for cologuard and FIT.
General population screening is tough. colocrap? cute.

Author’s reply »  And how do you think that EXAS computes its cumulative sensitivity in the slide that was
posted? If you said multiplication, you would be correct.


And no, the answers don't change regarding pre-cancer sensitivity if you don't use 42%. For instance, if you
use 20% (the Morikawa Study) then FIT finds 367 precancers and Colocrap still only finds 310.


If you read the whole article before you spouted off nonsensical conclusions that Colocrap was better than
FIT when FIT's pre-cancer sensitivity was lower I wouldn't be forced to repeat what was already written in the
article.

dejerzeus is not giving opinion, but quoting the 2006 article from which you derive the 42.6% precancer
number.


Most simply, as the authors state, it was a pair-wise comparison between InFIT and GFOBT wherein only the
positives were scoped to further validate the comparison. As has been repeated, to get a truer value of
InFIT's power would have required scoping all 2500+ participants in the study.

yes, unfortunately exas had that stupid calc to highlight the importance of repeat testing.


so the error is completely random? i.e. all adenomas bleed so repeat testing works? I have never seen
evidence of this and the Mayo Clinic does not believe it. This math only works if the error is random.


what about the difference in high grade dysplasia sensitivity (70+ vs 27)?


What about the stage of the patient being saved? 35% vs 90% in stage 1. Treating a stage 1 patient is
cheaper and saves more lives. What if general population screening catches on? Wouldn't we eventually only
be trying to detect stage 1?


what about decreasing compliance over the 3-year period?


So many variables. Let's multiply!!!!!!!!!

Author’s reply »  Not every polyp bleeds so FIT misses some. Some polyps bleed one week and not the next.
Hence the importance of repeat screening. BTW, not every polyp is caught by Colocrap either - only 42% per
the company.


I wonder why in a previously posted study - here: http://bit.ly/11eZ9x4 - the authors state "The effectiveness of
a FIT-based screening programme is, however, highly dependent on adherence to repeat testing." It must be
because cumulative sensitivity is an invalid concept.


You have zero evidence that Colocrap is better than FIT. They have basically the same sensitivity for Cancer,
so if you think Colocrap is better at catching early cancers it is, by definition, worse at catching later ones.


I'm done responding to you because you clearly have no idea how CRC screening works. You can have the
last word.

92% and 66% (or 75% upper boundary as your study clearly states for true sensitivity) are the same? You
win!!!!!


FIT is not 88%. The study that you use to make your case is very clear about this. I urge you to reread (and
focus on the details). If you truly believe that it is 88%, I just wasted my time because I have no chance.


Test comparisons in cases screened by colonoscopy: 
An estimate of true sensitivity can be obtained from results in those screening cases where colonoscopy was
performed (Table 4). Although numbers were relatively small, InSure was significantly more sensitive for
cancer (75% vs. 37.5%) and significant adenomas (27% vs. 15%).


24 Jul 2013, 11:19 PM


Energy-Trader
The Morikawa Study was a PROSPECTIVE and high-quality study.


The 75% sensitivity for colon cancer by FIT and 27% for pre-cancer that is cited on page #2156 of the
Australian study that you cite is not far from the data of the Morikawa Study.


25 Jul 2013, 09:39 AM


dejerzeus
I'm not sure why you are correcting me. You must have missed my point.


Those are absolute upper bounds in a biased test, the same test that the author derives 88% from (which is
not the correct # in any case). I'm only citing them to make the point that the study is meaningless, and
sensitivty is not even close to the same, even if you use the true sensitivity from the Insure study that only
gave colos to at-risk patients and those that tested positive. My point is 75% in a biased study and 66% in
Morikawa are probably the same, and the 75% actually reinforces the sensitivy from Morikawa. I think that we
will all be shocked at how poorly FIT repsonds, particularly in pre cancer (just think of the incidences vs.
expected incidences in Deep-C, as discussed by EXAS at length). I'm calling mid teens on pre cancers and
low 20s on advanced dysplasia.


And yes, I'm a moron that doesn't understand CRC screening.


25 Jul 2013, 10:54 AM


GlibSonoran
The reason the effectiveness of FIT is dependent on repeat testing is because so many cancers are
intermittent bleeders. You have to engage in repeat testing to have a reasonable chance of testing when the
cancer is actually bleeding.


It's definitely *not* because you can blithely apply the rule of multiplication to determine sensitivity with repeat
testing. When you *know* you have a category of polyps and tumors that are not detectable by the test the
rule of multiplication cannot apply.

A proper "apples to apples" comparison would have been over 7 years, not 3 years. Show the math Alpha, if nothing
else to save yourself some capital. It is indeed interesting that you show only 1 Cologuard test rather than the 3 over 7
years that EXAS discusses in it's institutional presentations. Motive on your part?


It is important to realize that most people will not go to the doctor every year. This is demonstrated by the FACT that
about half the adult population never experiences the cumulative test results of 3, much less 7, consecutive annual
FIT tests.


It is also very important to note that Cologuard over 7 years is going to crush FIT on pre-cancers. For somebody who
doesn't want cancer, that's a big deal. For those who don't mind cancer, I guess they can stick to FIT and catch it in
stage 1 or 2.


Cologuard will be approved on the simple logic I just laid out, EXAS stock will, as Barron's believes, will be over $20
next year.


Longs, don't let the shorts off the hook, the squeeze that might be about to begin might spike EXAS to $20s within
weeks. Do make sure to sell some covered calls when that spike levels off.

it is important to me what the 7 year results are since that is when the last of three cologuard tests would be
done. THAT is apples to apples. Waiting two more years is not.


7 years IS the correct interval with 3 cologuards and 7 FITs.


What your math will show is clear superiority on pre-cancers for Cologuard and non-inferiority to superiority
on cancers (depending on what FIT numbers you choose to use).

since Colonoscopy is supposed to last 10 yrs. Note also this is the low scenario for FIT and therefore seems
less likely to attract the trolls:

Lastly, remember that Colocrap will need to show it is effective, gain reimbursement, get doctors to use it, and

I agree with the other posters that you are not comparing apples to apples and that your article is misleading.  
FYI, FIT data from Deep-C trial will be published later this year. Deep-C is a large double blind randomized controlled
trial involving >10,000 patients. 
The DeeP-C clinical trial has achieved all of its endpoints including non-inferiority of Cologuard to FIT for cancer
sensitivity and superiority to FIT for advanced adenoma sensitivity, per management. 
I have copied and pasted an interesting article for you that seems to show that detection rate of advanced neoplasia
was significantly lower on repeat testing with FIT. I know that the objective of the study was to look for ideal screening
interval for FIT but just making a point that you cannot cherry pick data. My advise for you would be to wait for DEEP-
C trial publication later this year.


"Random comparison of repeated faecal immunochemical testing at different intervals for population-based colorectal
cancer screening. van Roon AH, Goede SL, van Ballegooijen M, van Vuuren AJ, Looman CW, Biermann K, Reijerink
JC, Mannetje H', van der Togt AC, Habbema JD, van Leerdam ME, Kuipers EJ Gut. 2013 Mar;62(3):409-15. Epub
2012 Mar 2. OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer screening by means of faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) requires
successive screening rounds for an optimal preventive effect. However, data on the influence of the length of the
screening interval on participation and diagnostic yield are lacking. Repeated FIT screening was therefore performed
in a population-based trial comparing various repeat intervals.  
DESIGN: 7501 Dutch individuals aged 50-74 years were randomly selected and invited for two 1-sample FIT
screening rounds (haemoglobin (Hb) concentration≥50 ng/ml, corresponding to 10μg Hb/g faeces) with intervals of 1
(group I), 2 (group II) or 3 years (group III).  
RESULTS: In group I, participation was 64.7% in the first screening round and 63.2% in the second. The
corresponding percentages for groups II and III were 61.0% vs 62.5% and 62.0% vs 64.0%. Triennial screening
resulted in a higherparticipation rate in the second screening round compared with annual screening (p=0.04). The
overall positivity rate in the second screening round was significantly lower compared with the first round (6.0% vs
8.4%; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and did not depend on interval length (p=0.23). Similarly, the overall detection
rate of advanced neoplasia was significantly lower in the second round compared with the first screening round (1.9%
vs 3.3%; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.76) and also did not depend on interval length (p=0.62). The positive predictive

value of the FIT did not significantly change over time (41% vs 33%; p=0.07).  
CONCLUSION: The total number of advanced neoplasia found at repeat FIT screening is not influenced by the
interval length within a range of 1-3 years. Furthermore, there is a stable and acceptably high participation in the
second screening round. This implies that screening intervals can be tailored to local resources. "

was to measure compliance with repeat testing (and which showed much better compliance than biotech vet
claimed in his cited study).


That being said, repeat testing should always find a lower % positive the second time around. For instance,
look at our first comparison of Cologuard with FIT using Morikawa stats - in that comparison FIT finds cancer
or precancer in 1.9% of people tested in year 1 but only 1.4% in year 2. This is because the year 2 population
has already been culled of a large portion of the cancer and pre-cancer patients.

Dude, You are obviously smart at confusing everyone using made up numbers. I have a question for you.
How did you come up with the "cumulative efficacy" numbers for the FIT test? Is there any study out there
that supports your "assumptions".  
I am basing my claim that cologuard is much better than FIT on a large multicenter randomized controlled trial
i.e. Deep-C study that compared FIT to cologuard head to head. The preliminary results show that the DeeP-
C clinical trial has achieved all of its endpoints including non-inferiority of Cologuard to FIT for cancer
sensitivity and superiority to FIT for advanced adenoma sensitivity. ("by a wide margin") 
You yourself have pointed out that their slide on programmatic sensitivity is not based to clinical evidence (as
EXAS has clearly disclosed in the slide) Then, how can you use the same reasoning to come up with your
made up numbers?

I have worked for major Wall St. firms for over 25 years and now teach investment management classes at a
University while managing High Net Worth portfolios.


Just so everyone is clear, when you short something, you need to get others to follow...See Chanos, Ackman etc.
Clearly Alpha Exposure is short as stated, and trying to get others to join. Readers must realize that most shorts are
negative carry and you need the asset to drop quickly if you have not term repoed the securities. One thing you never
know about these types is when they cover. They might be looking for a quick pop or a longer term theme trade. I
would guess this author is just a short term piker as I doubt they want to be short over the FDA or the clinical data. If
you want to talk liability, what liabilities would Kevin Conroy have if Cologuard did not beat FIT "by a wide margin" as
stated. Now AE has stated that Insure FIT would have these results in a 10,000 person study. I was not aware they
did the similar 10,000 person study? Clearly EXAS results were much better in smaller studies. Then they talk about
"not based on clinical evidence" yet their thesis is that 3 studies out preform on based on the same "not based on
clinical evidence".


The bottom line is that it is difficult to get the same amount of data from blood. Polyps do not always bleed! That is
why FIT precancers are so poor! They tend not to bleed. DNA is a better test. If someone other than EXAS comes up
with a better DNA test then that is great, I will buy it. EXAS has locked up many of these patents. Guess what
Conroy's previous job was? A patent attorney. I feel pretty good that their patents are well protected. Also, they have
locked up the GI tract DNA patents. How many other cancers will they be able to detect. They are currently testing
these cancers. I would guess big pharma would love an FDA approved, best in class colon cancer test. That is a big
short risk to me.


This is why i do not see this short as anything more than just trying to hype the short. You see the same in the pump
and dump stories on the long side. Whenever someone states that what the company said is wrong, and then uses
the same analysis to prove their point you must question their motives.


As an investor, always question the motive of the analysis and then look at the risk reward of the trade. As an
example, Chanos is short CAT on global growth, esp in China. That is a theme trade with merit. Looking at EXAS as a
theme trade???? no way. If you do short it, make sure your short size fits both the short interest and float size
parameters. The liquidity of this stock will crush you if you are too large.

I found your article enlightening but it seems to me that both you and EXAS have made an inadequate assumption:


A GIVEN SENSITIVITY MEANS THE PROBABILITY THAT A GIVEN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY
TESTED


I believe the numbers that you and EXAS presented using successive testings are based on this assumption.
However, unless a trail includes a repeated test on the population that is tested negative and still results in similar
sensitivity, this assumption is not valid because


A GIVEN SENSITIVITY SHOULD MEAN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN RESPOND (OR IS
SENSITIVE) TO A TESTING METHOD


So a given individual may not be sensitive to a given test no matter how many times it is repeated. In that case, the
two tests may be complementary as they may have different sets of targeted population?

why put your name on your writeup, right?

Seeking Alpha obviously seems quite comfortable with this sort of "arrangement".


But I guess that they have no problem disclosing the name of the "author" (hedge-fund) if a Regulatory Agency like
the SEC requests the name. That, apparently is Seeking Alpha's policy.

Author’s reply »  What would I care if the SEC knows my name? Everything that has been written was based
on either facts or my opinion and written in good faith with no intention to mislead. In fact, if you read my
UNXL articles, you will see that I have actively corresponded with them, so I have no doubt that they already
know who I am.


Why do I care if everyone knows my name? Because there are nut jobs out there that might come after me.
Just look at the personal threats that have been made against short sellers, such as Andrew Left at Citron.


If you don't understand this, you're hopeless.

Pflemming77 makes some good points on how shorts work. The good news for real investors is that shorts must
cover at some point to take their profits (or losses:-). If the stock starts to go up rapidly (for whatever reason) then the
"short squeeze" can really drive the stock up quickly (witness Facebook today!). Otherwise, the stock may go down
for as long as the short sellers can scare investors into selling. When the shorts reach their target, then the stock is
ready for a bounce. That can help those of us that are willing to hold and average down, as the bounce will almost
surely come with a good company. I made a bundle just this way with QCOR last year by buying at the height of the
short attack when the stock went to under $20, and selling a few mnghs later at $40 (it is currently at $47). I hope to
rinse and repeat with EXAS. Short sellers can really be your friends once you understand how they operate and when
you take advantage of it:-)! I am hoping they can drive the stock down to $12.50, my next buying target, but with
institutional holders at over 65%, they may not make it there...probably not enough weak hands left at this point;-).

This whole discussion is a bunch of... 
Then again, that's also the subject matter.


Have to admire the Seeking Alpha author for defending his position so vehemently. 
Personally, I'd never trust colon cancer detection to anything less than a colonoscopy. The FDA should have similar
standards. But they have also been known to be full of 'it'.

You don't sound very knowledgeable about colon cancer screening. 
How do you think that people get referred for Colonoscopy in the first place? 
They get tested via the FDA approved FIT/FOBT test that detects blood in the stool. 
Duh.

Several comments:


Based upon the publically available performance data presented to date for Deep-C I really dont think Cologuard will
have many major issues with the FDA---What interests me more, and in light of the general theme of these posts, is
what the granular language of the "intended use" claims will be; particulalry for Pre-Ca detection---much of this is tied
to seeing the actual data for the head to head comparison with FIT.


Regarding FIT--since the calling of a cologuard result is binary (yes/no) based upon ANY of the targets being positive
(my read) I am curious in regard to the Pre-Ca sensitivity % --how many % points are the result of a FIT+ Cologuard
MDx - result? I expect the number to be low or at least in line with statistical expectations based upon the poor Pre-Ca
detection by FIT--if not then what was the FIT cut-off used to make the call?


Finally; does anyone know what happened to Laura Stoltenberg? She was their Chief Commercialization Officer up
until last month I believe
