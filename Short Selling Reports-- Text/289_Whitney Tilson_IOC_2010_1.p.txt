Lesson on 13F's From Whitney Tilson & an Update on
Their InterOil Short Position


Whitney Tilson, hedge fund manager of T2 Partners recently commented on the


latest round of SEC 13F filings and how people tend to misread them. We thought


this was an excellent time to continue our impromptu lessons on 13F filings that we


started yesterday. Today's topics? Discerning net exposures in positions and


distinguishing when ownership of common stock is not necessarily a long position.


The following is printed with permission from Mr. Tilson regarding message board


participants improperly reading his firm's 13F: 





"It says a lot about who owns InterOil when folks on the company’s message boards


are saying we’ve gone long the stock based on our 13-F. HA! This is a very large


bearish bet for us. A lot of people make this mistake when reading 13-Fs: managers


often own puts (which are also disclosed in the 13-F) or are short a stock (which


isn’t disclosed) and then own a small offsetting long position to make it easy to


trade around it. 





In our case, our 13F shows that as of 6/30, we owned 1,623 put contracts


(representing 162,300 shares of stock) on IOC and, in addition, were long a mere


10,400 shares. Puts can be very hard to trade, so we just bought more puts than we


wanted and offset the extra amount by buying some stock, resulting in the desired


net exposure. Then, if we want to increase or decrease our bearish bet, we can


simply buy or sell the stock." 





This just reinforces the need for investors to *read* 13F filings carefully. In


particular, make sure to glance at the right-hand columns on the filing to


distinguish whether a position is a stock option (put or call) rather than just


common stock. Just yesterday, Bloomberg omitted options positions from an article


on 13F analysis. And today, we see that message board readers have either


overlooked the options portion of T2's filing or misinterpreted their common stock


position.

5/23/2018 Lesson on 13F's From Whitney Tilson & an Update on Their InterOil Short Position ~ market folly


https://www.marketfolly.com/2010/08/lesson-on-13fs-from-whitney-tilson.html 2/5


T2's actions of buying puts and then buying a small slice of common stock illustrate


an important example of liquidity and having the ability to trade around a position.


This becomes even more important in stocks that are heavily shorted and can swing


wildly with volatility. So if a hedge fund owns multiple securities of the same


company, you have to assess the values of each individual security to ultimately


determine if it is a bullish or bearish wager. And in T2 Partners' case, they own


way more puts than common stock, resulting in an obvious bearish bet. 





Tilson also updated us on T2 Partners' short position in IOC. We've detailed this


stake numerous times in the past as it's rare you see fund managers talk openly


about their short positions. As such, we've taken the opportunity below to highlight


Tilson's recent thoughts on InterOil: 





"We added to our bearish bet (yesterday), as InterOil reported Q2 earnings


yesterday that reinforced our investment thesis. The earnings and EBITDA (driven


by the refinery operation) are irrelevant for a company that has a $2.9 BILLION


(not a typo) market cap; what really matters if whether there is, in fact, the Sierra


Madre of oil and gas in the areas being explored by InterOil and, if so, whether they


have the cash to find it, develop it commercially, etc. 





Re: the former, there continues to be no proven or even probable reserves – justreserv


more hype and gibberish like this from the earnings release: 





The Antelope 2 horizontal well confirmed a higher condensate-to-natural gas ratio


of 20.4 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas, 27% higher than observed at


the top of the reservoir. reserv The horizontal well also demonstrated dolomitization and


higher porosity deeper in the reservoir than previously modeled.reserv  





And re. the cash, this company is going to hit the wall soon. Over the past four


quarters, net income is -$1.3 million and free cash flow is -$181.9 million (cash from


operating activities minus “expenditure on oil and gas properties” and “expenditure


on plant and equipment, net of disposals”, broken down as follows:  





Q3 09: -$48.6 million 


Q4 09: -$40.7 million 


Q1 10: -$28.5 million 


Q2 10: -$64.1 million 


TOTAL: $181.9 million) 





So with no profits to fund such massively negative cash flows, how is InterOil doing


it? Answer #1: Burning through cash (unrestricted cash has declined from $96.4


million a year ago to $31.7 million today). Answer #2: Taking on debt (the working


capital facility – short-term debt – is up from $4.0 million a year ago to $57.7

5/23/2018 Lesson on 13F's From Whitney Tilson & an Update on Their InterOil Short Position ~ market folly


https://www.marketfolly.com/2010/08/lesson-on-13fs-from-whitney-tilson.html 3/5


million today, partly offset by a $9 million decline in a secured loan). Answer #3:


Issuing stock and conversion of debt ($12.8 million over the past 12 months),


resulting in the diluted share count rising 16.1%. Answer #4: Misc. other stuff


(“Proceeds from IPI cash calls” ($15.2M in the first two quarters of 2010), “Proceeds


received on sale of exploration assets” ($13.9M in Q1), and “Proceeds from Petromin


for Elk and Antelope field development” ($5M over the past 12 months). 





To summarize, InterOil has only $31.7 million in unrestricted cash as of June 30th


and they’re burning an average of $45.5 million of cash each quarter. No wonder


the company entered a short-term $25 million credit facility last week on distressed


terms: 10% interest (in this environment!), secured by a 2.5% stake in InterOil’s Elk


and Antelope fields. Note that the provider of financing was a very dicey outfit,


Clarion Finanz and known stock promoter Carlo Civelli – see this post." 





In the past, we've also highlighted some of T2's other short positions for those


interested. And for more on interpreting SEC filings correctly, head to our post from


yesterday regarding Eric Mindich's hedge fund Eton Park and lessons regarding


13F filings.

Good primer on 13Fs and how to read them. Interpreting them correctly is key to making good
use of them. We focus on a manger's largest 20 EQUITY positions which concentrate a majority
of the manager's disclosed portfolio value and 99 times out of a 100 reflect a long bias on those
positions.

I am definitely leaning towards IOC being a fraud, but what the hell is George Soros doing with
this company? Seems weird that in the face of the bear thesis he would be long large amounts
of IOC. Any insight about that?

That's a tough question. Soros holds over 800 positions and many of them are often tied
to energy, global growth, etc. He could be bullish on the name, he could just be trading it
from a momentum aspect, or it could be a tradeable position to hedge a short just like
Tilson has done. It's hard to say at this point.


Keep in mind that Soros is a global macro firm so their strategy is different, the positions
they take are different, and their timeframe for holding an investment is also different. We
wouldn't feel safe guessing either way as macro funds are much harder to track. But
those are certainly all possibilities. They'd have to comment specifically on the position to
gain some truth.
