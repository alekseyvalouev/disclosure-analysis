Geron: Imetelstat's History Of Deaths And Safety Issues
Feb. 9, 2018 9:45 AM ET440 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


Imetelstat has a history of poor clinical performance and safety issues.


It appears that the FDA may be investigating continued safety issues with imetelstat
in its current clinical trials that may result in another clinical hold.


We are short GERN and see 80% downside.


Investors seem to have gotten excited again about the prospects for Geron's (GERN)
imetelstat, pushing the shares +50% year to date at its peak to nearly nine-month highs.
We think new investors to Geron may be shocked to learn about what we see as
imetelstat's history of failed clinical trials, patient deaths, and safety issues. We highlight
them in this article and caution investors not to get excited about the Janssen partnership.


History of failure, adverse events, patient deaths, and clinical hold
for imetelstat


From its beginnings, imetelstat has had a history of trial failures and safety issues. In
2010-2012, investors had high hopes for imetelstat, which was being investigated in
Phase 2 trials in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and advanced non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately in September 2012, Geron announced that imetelstat
failed its Phase 2 trial in breast cancer during an interim analysis, and that the company
had decided to not pursue further development of imetelstat in NSCLC because it was not
going to hit its pre-specified success criteria. This was a big disappointment and drove
Geron shares down 56% from $2.74 to $1.21.

In the press release, Geron stated clearly that the imetelstat group was performing worse
than the control arm (paclitaxel alone) and had a lower PFS, and that the imetelstat group
actually had a "greater number of deaths" and discontinuations than the paclitaxel-only
arm in the Phase 2 breast cancer study.


As for the Phase 2 NSCLC trial, after announcing that imetelstat was unlikely to hit its pre-
specified success criteria, Geron later published the final results of the trial in December
2014. In the publication, investigators revealed that imetelstat failed to show statistical
significance in either PFS or OS in NSCLC. The investigators also noted that the
imetelstat arms had significantly greater grade 3/4 adverse events, particularly
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. It became very clear that imetelstat was a dangerous
drug and came with significant safety issues.


Later, imetelstat did show positive results in a small, 18-patient, open-label Phase 2 trial in
essential thrombocythemia (ET), but that promise was quickly stamped out by Geron
which decided not to pursue further development in ET because medical experts advised
the company that imetelstat didn't show greater efficacy than existing treatments and that
ET patients were "adequately served by existing therapies."


The main "successful" results for imetelstat came from early results from an investigator
sponsored (led by Dr. Ayalew Tefferi), open-label Phase 2 trial (Pilot Study) at the Mayo
Clinic in myelofibrosis (MF). The Pilot Study was designed to enroll 81 patients, but in
December 2013, Geron released preliminary results from just 22 patients in the first 2
cohorts and touted the 4 complete responses (CRS) and 1 partial response (PR). While
promising on its face, the results attracted skepticism, such as this Adam Feuerstein
article that questioned the results.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/959452_15181285368996_rId8.png
These concerns on imetelstat turned out to be well-founded as there were 2 deaths in the
trial (in just 22 patients), which further increased the safety concerns related to imetelstat.
Soon thereafter, the Mayo Clinic announced it was discontinuing enrollment in the
imetelstat trial (see "Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trial in Myelofibrosis" in the January
2014 prospectus). While Geron stated the decision to cease new enrollment had nothing
to do with any efficacy or safety concerns, it certainly raised eyebrows within the
community. In March 2014, Geron announced that imetelstat was being placed on a full
clinical hold by the FDA for all company-sponsored clinical trials. Eighteen days later,
Geron announced that the Pilot Study at the Mayo Clinic was also placed under partial
clinical hold due to concerns over hepatotoxicity.

Oddly, while the early results from the Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial led by Dr.
Tefferi served as the main positive "results" for imetelstat, Geron has refused to provide
updates from the trial. During the second quarter 2016 earnings call, Geron was asked
about updates from the trial, particularly the complete responses. Geron responded: "That
study is sort of towards the end of its life, and we have decided not to make any further
publications." We find this odd, particularly since it's an open-label trial and data should be
readily available. We suspect that it means that trial results may have turned for the
worse, but we cannot determine if this is true without an update from the company.


Imetelstat's safety issues persist today


Notwithstanding imetelstat's history, in November 2014 after the clinical hold was lifted,
Geron partnered with Janssen on imetelstat. Janssen began conducting two Phase 2
studies, the IMbark trial in intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), and the IMerge
trial in low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). As a result of the
partnership, Geron received an upfront fee and is eligible for future milestone payments
related to the IMbark and IMerge trials and royalties on future Imetelstat sales. While
investors may have hoped that this new partnership with Janssen changed Imetelstat's
prospects, Imetelstat continues to be plagued by safety issues, particularly patient deaths.


In the 1Q 2017 10-Q, Geron released that both IMbark and IMerge trials have seen
patients deaths and that Imetelstat was potentially at risk of another clinical hold. The 10-
Q states in the Risk Factors section (emphasis added):


"In addition, adverse events previously observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study,
such as LFT abnormalities, profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia, bleeding events, and other safety issues, including deaths, have also
been observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge. If patients in current or
potential future clinical trials of Imetelstat experience similar or more severe adverse
events, including LFT abnormalities, or severe hepatic, hemorrhagic, or new or
unusual adverse events, the INDs for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical
hold, as it was in March 2014, and Janssen may be delayed or precluded from
further developing imetelstat."

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886744/000110465917031128/a17-8893_110q.htm
These adverse events appear to have continued and/or intensified. In the 2Q 2017 10-Q,
Geron added that imetelstat has been seeing grade 3/4 adverse events in the IMbark and
IMerge trials, and stated (emphasis added):


"In addition, adverse events previously observed in imetelstat trials, such as LFT
abnormalities; profound and/or prolonged, including grade 3/4, thrombocytopenia
and neutropenia; bleeding events, with or without any associated
thrombocytopenia; and other safety issues, including deaths, have also been
observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge. If patients in current or potential
future clinical trials of imetelstat experience similar or more severe adverse events,
including LFT abnormalities, or severe hepatic, hemorrhagic, or new or unusual
adverse events, the INDs for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical hold, as
it was in March 2014, and Janssen may be delayed or precluded from further
developing imetelstat."


The Janssen trials have been hit by multiple delays and difficulties


Although current investors seem to be excited about the two Janssen-led trials, we're less
enthusiastic. In fact, the Janssen trials have been plagued by multiple delays and
difficulties in addition to the safety issues that we highlighted above. In a September 2016
update on the progress of the two clinical trials, Geron announced that Janssen had
informed Geron that Janssen was closing one of the treatment arms in the IMbark trial and
discontinuing enrollment in another, and that Janssen had stopped enrolling additional
patients in the IMerge trial. This news sent Geron shares down 20%.


Later in July of 2017, as the adverse events and deaths were reported in Geron's 10-Q
filings, Geron reported another negative development in both of the Phase 2 trials being
conducted by Janssen. This time Geron announced that Janssen wanted to enroll
additional patients in the IMerge trial in order to see signs of efficacy and that investors
would have to wait until 3Q 2018 at the earliest to get data from the IMbark trial, which had
not progressed and remained closed to new enrollment. The need to enroll additional
patients suggested to us that imetelstat wasn't showing strong efficacy results in initial
IMerge patients. We believe the announcement, which would reasonably be interpreted as
resulting in delays, was received negatively by investors as evidenced by Geron's shares
trading down 15% that day.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GERN/history?period1=1501387200&period2=1501905600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d
Finally, Geron released additional concerns about imetelstat's safety profile in its latest 3Q
2017 10-Q. In the Risk Factors section, Geron announced that it had received an
"information request" by the FDA for (emphasis added) "additional efficacy and safety
data, including deaths, justifying continued treatment of patients enrolled in
IMbark." It appears to us that the FDA may be troubled about imetelstat's toxicity and
concerned about Janssen's decision to enroll additional patients in the IMerge trial. We
believe this may be a material risk to imetelstat that investors may be overlooking.


Moreover, in the same 3Q 2017 10-Q, Geron added (emphasis added):


"If the FDA deems such data and information to be inadequate or determines that
such data does not justify continued treatment of patients enrolled in current clinical
trials of imetelstat, then any current clinical trials, including IMbark, IMerge and
the Pilot Study, could be further delayed, halted or prohibited, for example by
being placed on clinical hold."


This serves to corroborate our concerns on imetelstat's safety profile and adds to
imetelstat's difficult clinical and safety history.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886744/000156459017020773/gern-10q_20170930.htm
We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47


We are short Geron because we don't believe imetelstat is effective and we believe that its
safety issues suggest that it is a dangerous drug. In previous trials, imetelstat has shown
no efficacy in lung cancer and actually had worse results than the control arm in breast
cancer. We also discount the preliminary results from the Phase 2 Pilot Study led by Dr.
Tefferi because it was small, open-label, and investigator-sponsored. In addition, we want
to point out that the Pilot Study's enrollment was discontinued early, which suggests to us
that the trial wasn't promising in later results and/or that the Mayo Clinic may have found
the safety profile of imetelstat unacceptable. Furthermore, Geron refuses to provide
updates from the Pilot Study despite investor inquiries.


We also believe the safety issues with imetelstat are real concerns, which led to FDA to
ask for an informational request to justify continued treatment of patients in the Janssen
trials, and we believe investors are not paying enough attention to this risk for Geron.


We value imetelstat at zero, and our target price for GERN is the cash on its balance
sheet adjusted for cash burn.


Disclosure: I am/we are short GERN.

Yup, and with SA trying to force users into a pay to see subscription, it really is a wonder how they expect
anyone to trust their integrity or even publishing judgment. OTOH, it would seem there would be an
opportunity for the creation of another similar investment site that has better publishing guidelines and
honesty.

Has anyone else noticed the timing of this article just happen to come when the RSI was flashing overbought?
This is a typical sort strategy. Post a seeming well researched article on SA bashing the stock and watch it drop. I
emphasize the word seemingly because it completely ignores the counterpoints on the extreme effectiveness of
Imetelstat at killing small cell cancer. The FDA has approved drugs with considerably worse safety profiles.

Can Fidelity have short part of its Geron position and now simply covered 4M? Is that a posibility at all?


http://bit.ly/2C2ALZl


15 Feb 2018, 06:48 PM


telomerase
No. Fidelity is not a hedge fund. For a little while they tried re-selling interests in hedge funds, but they
gave even that up in 2016. And they are not "long and short at the same time in the same stocks"... how
would that make any money anyway?


Fidelity makes money from fees. Lots and lots of money. They don't have to try to make desperate
guesses about market direction or individual drug trial successes... it's their customers taking all the risk,
not them.

Not really ! Sometimes I think a few commenters here don't realize their own negative emotional bias.
Obviously there's an inclination due to self interest to want good news but any real "rational" contrarion

lev,
Just a small comment (and one that reflects my experience based on daily trading for a couple of
decades), I don't think ANYONE that has little experience in the Market "knows the risk" in investing in
early-stage biotech- be it, preclinical, clinical, p1, p2 or p3.


Reminds me of a story. When I was a youngster my folks took me on vacation to Niagra Falls, Ca. It was
great and I purchased a tourist guidebook on the history of the Falls and the misadventures that happened
when various daredevils went over the Falls in a barrel. The section on one man's decision to "wing it"

https://seekingalpha.com/user/25763033

https://seekingalpha.com/user/691651

https://seekingalpha.com/user/27717033
particularly made an impression on me. It seems this hapless soul wanted fame and fortune and decided
his best chance was to go over the Falls in a barrel. So, he obtained a hogshead, nailed some leather
straps on the inside for his arms and hauled it up to the top of the Falls and was set to go over. However,
when someone suggested he'd need some ballast to stabilize the barrel, he decided to strap an anvil to
his feet. Well, when they retrieved the barrel down below the Falls all they found were the guy's
arms, still in the leather straps. 
The story seems appropriate for early stage biotech investors to always bear in mind.

That's a good story 277......I just wonder, when all is said and done, that people on this forum actually read
carefully not only what people may say, but how they say it.


Yes, I'm a financial advisor, and yes, I have a bullish bias towards Geron, always have, and hope to be
able to say, always will.


However, in my business it's really important to TRY and phrase posts and responses by using words like:


may, might, could, likely, have the chance to, has the potential to, possibly, etc, etc, etc.


Almost all my posts use those terms and expressions in order to convey not only what my opinions are,
but to have the reader understand that nothing here is wrotten in stone.


It really pisses me off when some, a small few, yes, decide to brand me as a cheerleader, or a bullish
numbskull, who has no idea of the risk involved. I've been in the markets since I was 19, and believe me, I
know the risks involved.


Saying positive things is fine, it's a reflection of being a positive person, and I can't guarantee all my posts
are perfect, who's is; however, saying something "may" happen is far different from saying something
WILL happen.


Some people just need to play the devil's advocate, which is fine. Just don't put other's down in the

If you read my comment, I called this article a "hit piece." Is "hatchet job" a better choice of words?


I get very tired of my motives being questioned, when I post a comment that is not entirely positive. I am
long and expect to profit from the misadventure.... eventually.


However, this is not a sure thing. There are good reasons to be skeptical about Geron's potential and the
company leadership, but we can't have a reasonable discussion of the pros and cons. ANY comment that
isn't about the sure path to Turtle Island is attacked as negative, and there is no real discussion. Tired of it.

Div, the Fidelity sale was the only transaction of its size. You are the one trying to evade the question of
why Fidelity is selling... the trick in life is to actually face all the positives AND negatives.


Imet actually has a biological effect. (It appears that the clinical importance might be more the hTR effect
rather than the telomere effect I measured with my TRFs in 2003, but that's biology for you). That's the
positive here.... and it's a big one.


Now back to the negative. Why is Fidelity, who has held all this time, selling now?

fish, you are deliberately misquoting me. You know full well that I said that the SHORT interest is HFT
algos. Fidelity buys and holds, and with the largest interest in GERN of any holder, they have the largest

And they just sold four million shares.

Did the author(s) of the article go short at an average price of 2.35, with an expectation that the price will go down
to .47? Or did they go short below 2.00 completely, and when the price hit 2.35 and higher, did the author(s)
decide to publish their altruistic article? Can anyone help me with my math? Is it possible that the author(s) will
reveal the size of their position? Or am I being naive? If it is 1,000 shares or so, the potential loss is manageable.
But if the size is 10,000 or more, the loss could be significant. And why would the author(s) not reveal the size of
the shorted position they took, and at what price? Gern did hold up well in the recent downdraft, and maybe it is
undergoing reaccumulation. Anyway, I don't mean to ramble on, but can anyone help me with my math?

The way I see it is SA has allowed manipulative jerks a method of bailing out their recent losing positions. This
short group seem to have a history of this type of action.


If things were going their way this article would not have been necessary, but it was. This group was successful
and likely covered most of their short position the morning of their article. Is this fair?


Well, Telo might ask the question, "why can MTB write positive articles and this group not?" When an individual is
invested in a company for the long term, has discussed fundamentals, timelines, trials, facts based on real
information, it is a fair position to discuss in an article.


If a stock has recently made a pretty good move, and a major short starts to become nervous, that short will
expound wave-after-wave of data and statistics that seem to the lay person as being true (maybe even to the SA
moderators), but has, as the sole purpose of writing this article, a method of bailing himself (or his group) out.


That's well and good for the short; however, in the process this raid affects common stock holders simultaneously.
There's something dead wrong about this and I'm going to guess Seeking Alpha is now looking into it and have
already come to a conclusion that THEY MADE A MISTAKE IN ALLOWING THIS RAID ON GERON!!!!

Going down hard is simply the nature of geron regardless of what is written or not written. We have seen

What I’m saying in the above post is investors remain confused about GERN and about the partnership with JNJ.
There’s a distinct lack of clarity with regard to crucial issues like the connection between the MF trial and the MDS
trial and if the latter is dependent upon the former. I believe this lack of clarity is reflected in the present stock
price. Investors are left guessing, speculating and deducing. One expects that in a biotech stock. I get that. But
should one reasonably expect that confusion to go on for years? Cannot GERN do a better job of informing its
investors, and cannot this be done without sacrificing any so-called competitive advantage? If Imet is a unique
drug with unusual properties what competitive advantage would GERN/JNJ place in danger by communicating
with its shareholders? When does “competitive advantage” become an excuse for lack of communication and
indifference?


In addition, if little information will be shared with investors after the first quarter MF review there appears little to
drive the stock forward. - Sargasso

makers take their profits, neat eh?

estimate the valuation of imet + IP at ZERO. That means that they think that imetelstat will fail. That the
company goes bankrupt. Nobody who thinks that a drug will fail and the company goes bust, buys 5000
extra shares of that company.

11 Feb 2018, 10:20 PM


Sunflowers Everywhere
Black, when an article starts with a few lines, stating a non-fact, and on the other hand a fact, than it is
pretty obvious what the auther's purpose is :


Begin to read again the first lines of the article : 
Non-Fact : ...It appears ... may be ... may result ....we think...
Fact : We are short GERN


Everybody his/hers opninion. 
Here is mine in a few words, and compare that to auther's conclusion. It is completely different, and
therefore the calculations are not comparable at all.


Personally I do not at all value imetelstat at zero.
It has great potential to be a help for patients, and to become a needed medicine on the commercial
market later. 
A blockbuster? I don't know. Too early to say that.
So my target price for GERN has nothing to do with the current cash on its balance sheet right now.


At this moment, the most important future date for GERN, you can find in slide 19 : the latest time for
Janssen when "Continuation Decision" is expected, which is the latest on Q4 2018 or Q1 2019.
Off course it is possible they release it during spring, summer, autumn or winter months of 2018. 
But reality is that they have time for this decision till 31th of March 2019.


I rest my Case.

If the survival benefits are as good as they appear for mf, I cannot imagine doing a randomized trial. I would
actually go so far as to say it would be unethical and would not be approved. When the average lifespan for the
patient population is 10ish months and you have a drug that has a shown statistically significant increase in
lifespan, especially if it is double or triple, it would be terribly unethical to give that patient placebo or even
standard treatment


11 Feb 2018, 04:10 PM

So, the question remains why Janssen doesn't release the and get the FDA approval needed for wider
use?


11 Feb 2018, 04:31 PM


aaronp
My guess would be that because the average patient has only been in the trial 21 ish months and some
much less, that it may not be statistically significant yet. They may be able to look at the number of
patients still alive and have a very good idea that the life expectancy will be double or triple, but they may
not be able to prove it scientifically yet. As an example, what if a large proportion of the patients died in the
near future. Then that median number wouldn’t look that good then.


11 Feb 2018, 05:43 PM

aa: that could be a viable answer!


But, as far as CRs, PRs and CIs, Janssen should have a pretty good idea of what going on after over 2+
years of testing.


Of course, IMO.


11 Feb 2018, 10:18 PM


jacosa
Ok, this is a very old argument (it's the main theme in one chapter of "Microbe Hunters;" the "Experiment
perilous" part of Hippocrates's second most famous maxim probably refers to the same thing), with many
modern examples. In breast cancer, so long as it was "unethical" to deny patients radical mastectomy 25
years ago, or Avastin ~5 years ago, it wasn't seen that these interventions were [nearly] worthless. It is
perfectly obvious that "historical controls" must be validated carefully to have any meaning at all, and there
is not even a claim that such work has been done for IMBark. Simultaneous matched controls aren't
perfect, but they provide the best evidence to outsiders that a claimed effect is real. And the FDA is
outsiders.


12 Feb 2018, 10:44 AM


telomerase
Jacosa is right about worthless procedures and drugs continuing for decades because of lack of controls
(e.g. certain knee surgeries, some statins, there are thousands of known examples).


However, we're getting a lot better at understanding the cellular basis of cancer. Once truly effective anti-
cancer cocktails are developed, there won't be a need for controls, just for monitoring the improvement in
the patients.

Well since jakafi is the only treatment for MF excepting stem cell therapy, and jakafi has basically a zero
control effect for MF R/R patients, it seems to me using jakafi as a zero baseline is your control for
secondline R/R MF CTs. In otherwords, if you can identify clear enough CIs over discontinuing jakafi or no
available treatment, any benefit can allow approval compared to just a quick death. OS plus any other
determined CIs seems to make sense as BAT.


12 Feb 2018, 03:47 PM


fishermangents
'they may not be able to prove it scientifically yet'
That's where the clinical doctors come in, who have actually looked to the patients at a molecular level in
the bone marrow and peripheral blood. In judging the merits of prolonged survival they need to see
improvements in allele burden, cytokines, blasts, fibrosis, blood counts etc. In those details prolonged
survival will be put into the perspective of potential disease modification and will be supportive in any FDA
decision.


JS already said various times that imet seems to target the malignant clone, for which they obviously saw
sufficient evidence to justify public announcement (also: G. Mosoyan et al 2017, Monika Haubitz et al
ASH2016 abstract 91467, G.M. Baerlocher et al NEJM 2015). Therefore I am hopeful that prolonged
survival with imet will be more meaningful than any survival benefit measured in other drugs like Jakafi.


13 Feb 2018, 08:40 AM


jacosa
So, they should do it (actually, since failure of Jakafi is an enrollment criterion, it might be better to use
hydroxyurea as an ineffective but plausible treatment...or even supportive treatment only). The key, which
hasn't been done, is to apply the same admission criteria to both the treatment and control groups, and to
generate a specific date for entry of each patient into the study. It is also generally done to compile specific
records of possibly-confounding patient attributes in case there is a later question about the matching of
test and control groups. (I know of a study in which this not only accounted for a surprising result, but also
altered the way clinicians judged activity of the disease)


A chart review of historical controls to determine comparability would be an improvement, [I expect that
Janssen is trying it] but even that leaves a lot of room for uncertainty about appropriate starting dates.

groups, the fact that there is no viable answer for these critically ill R/R MF patients lends itself to allowing
more flexibility in approving a new drug that seems to provide CI's plus has accrued a significant history
now and safety profile , versus just doing nothing and letting them die. This fact should have some weight
in FDA decision making.


13 Feb 2018, 10:40 AM


jacosa
So because Avastin helps colon cancer patients, give the breast cancer patients Avastin? And have FDA
support it? It is the old argument again, and pretty much every single time, whatever the initial answer
was, the right answer has been to get the evidence straight first.


Safety profile of imetelstat is not something I'd refer to with satisfaction. Yes: liver damage can be
managed, but it is still frequent. The only statements about AEs I have read from the present round of
trials is that they are comparable to prior experience--prior experience was a greater number of serious
AEs than patients.


I note that you refer to "these critically ill R/R MF patients." The inclusion criteria for NCT02426086 specify
"ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2"--these patients do not start as what most people think of as critically
ill (definition of status 2, the worst of these: "Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out
any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours").


14 Feb 2018, 10:07 AM


Anonymous Wizard
You are not comparing apples to apples. IMET is targeting MF and has been shown to clear the fibrosis.
It's not a leap from colon to breast cancer. IMET has a safety profile (all drugs have AE's like jakafi) only
tested frontline and fails R/R testing, that crosschecks across multiple indications and CTs and that history
now is becoming well known and the FDA has not only lifted those old bogus holds but has not injected
any further restrictions or holds. 
The nominal OS of the R/R MF population that IMET is testing is around 12 months so no matter how you
slice it, these are critically ill R/R patients that jakafi cannot help at all.

User 9308911
Based upon the recent emails from Anna I now fear investors may be setting themselves up for disappointment if
more information about the MF results is not forthcoming after the first quarter review. What exactly is Janssen
looking for with regard to the MF trial? What exactly does it mean to state that the data is not mature? How much
longer does GERN expect investors to decipher these cryptic messages?


And:


If Imet is as good as we think it is why, apparently, did JS have to force the issue w/ regard to the continuation



https://seekingalpha.com/user/205298

https://seekingalpha.com/user/231478

https://seekingalpha.com/user/9308911
decision giving rise to the question of how committed Janssen is to Imet? If Imet is as good as we think it is why
would JS have to force Janssen to do anything?


And:


The results of the MDS trial are apparently quite encouraging. Is a Phase 3 MDS trial nonetheless still dependent
upon the results of the MF trial? Is not MDS a lucrative market and several times larger than MF? Did not Dr. Raza
unambiguously state that she and others are more than willing to use Imet for the treatment of MDS? If Imet is
really that good why is a Phase 3 MDS trial still dependent upon the results of the MF trial?


These, I believe, are the sort of questions the market will be asking about the future of GERN. Without some real
clarity w/ regard to these issues I fear GERN may be subject to an even greater sell-off. There are limits to the
patience of even the most committed investors.

Seriously, I don't give much weight to what Anna says. She'a in PR/IR and everything we've heard to date
from Scarlett, indicates that IMBARK is strictly being judged as a Phase 2 trial with no Phase 3 plan or
design and is geared towards acceleration. It's a R/R MF trial for very ill patients where jakafi FAILS FAILS
FAILS ! Get that ? If they change their minds or per the FDA direction, it's likely a concurrent Phase 3 with
acceleration of the drug. But there has to be enough benefit seen and 1stQ 2018 review is for directional
purposes. If they Go forward based on the the internal review (and with FDA feedback), then the target is
4th Q2018 for a data analysis and JNJ decision. At that point if it is determined IMET has enough benefit,
I'd expect acceleration and maybe a Phase 3.

Agree AW, Jacosa Scarlet mentioned that MDS trial may need phase 3 and MF trail is subject to acceleration(
once data is mature, they will apply for accelerated approval). The internal analysis will let them know they are on
track and by end of q3 or if earlier MOS is reached, they will begin the primary analysis and if data shows better
survival, they will apply for potential approval. ESTIMATED APPROVAL 2019.

I think you are pipe dreaming jacosa. Don't take a PR/IR comment as superior to anything already said by Scarlett.
Scarlett previously conferenced that IMBARK lends itself more to an accelerated approval process moreso than
IMERGE which already has a P3 design approved. Anything can happen here but if IMET gets wings based on OS
plus other CIs in the more difficult MF R/R population where jakafi clearly has failed, then the timeline completely
changes.

I have seen JNJ speak up once they decide to go into a phase 3. Certainly if they decide to Continue with
Geron. JNJ does not need to speak up at this point excepting they have included IMET still in their
futuristic business revenue plans in oncology.

Alpha Exposure: welcome to the bullseye. Good luck dealing with the howling mob. You're probably right not to get
into it directly with them.


For the rest of everybody--recall that I'm an Incyte bull, not a Geron bear (and back in the so-called panel
discussion I had nice things to say about imetelstat's prospects against MDSs). So what I'll grab on to here is Anna
Krassowska's answer, which seems to indicate clearly that Geron expects approval of use of imetelstat against
myelofibrosis to require a trial with a simultaneous control group. The planning for such a trial can't begin until AT
LEAST the level of review that is supposedly being carried out on IMBark about now; it takes about 9-12 months to
get from start of planning for a pivotal trial to treatment of the first patient and then the trial takes however long it
takes, Review after the trial generally takes a year. Availability of imetelstat as a treatment for MF is other than
imminent. Meanwhile, there are two open label trials combining Jaka[fv]i with already-marketed drugs in the
attempt to reduce the number of non-responders and improve response in patients who already benefit [there are
also trials combining Jakafi with candidates in development]. The tiny mixed MF and PV study on which the soon-
to-report Jakavi + interferon all-MF study was based showed 100% deep responses in the 3 MF patients. By the
time imetelstat reaches the market, there is a large chance that there will be no unmet MF need.

Jacosa: take a look at Vanucchi's video, maybe you will learn something. He doesn't see a future of Jakafi
in ANY of those combinations.


Some quotes:
'This is not a strong signal compared to Ruxolitinib alone'
'There are toxicities associated with the use of these combinations, that are still raising doubts about the
feasibility and clinical relevance of making this associations'
'The current idea is that these associations are not worth while right now for further clinical study for the
clinical trials'
http://bit.ly/1UU9OVm
(starts on 4:59)
Remark: with 'associations' he means 'combinations'


Poefhhhh.... there they go, with all your Jakafi combinations. They don't bring relevant benefits and are too
toxic.

About imetelstat he speaks as a promising and interesting drug, being able to bring remissions, including
reversal of the fibrosis.
(starts on 5:55)
'One of these new drugs that are the most appealing based on the results of the Phase2 trials, is off
course imetelstat."


Yes, he says 'OFF COURSE'.


Everybody should see this video, as it clearly positions imetelstat as the most promising drug in this
complex field of MPN's.


11 Feb 2018, 05:55 AM

Almost forgot to say that he also says that Jakafi causes disease persistance and resistance against the
drug (starts at 12:24 of the video).


11 Feb 2018, 06:04 AM


fishermangents
'showed 100% deep responses' 
Sure. Caused by interferon. It is well known that interferon is able to induce remissions, but certainly not in
advanced patients and certainly not long lasting. They are currently trying to find why interferon always
stops working.
Btw: interferon is myelosuppressive and is a difficult drug the deal with for patients. It makes you feel
depressed and weak.


Conclusion: in the end all patients on Jakafi + interferon will need to stop the drugs and then going
to.....imetelstat? Transplant?

I used to be very critical of interferon, but the really bad AEs were at much higher doses than are presently
being investigated.


From sad experience, I try very hard now not to assume the results of clinical trials until they are reported.
The French interferon + ruxo trial ought to report interim results this year. We have actual results from the
Danish trial that inspired it, and they do not, to say the least, inspire pessimism.


There is less public detail on the ruxo + azaC combination, but again, we ought to learn something this
year.


11 Feb 2018, 12:48 PM


jacosa
Actually, no. "Continuation stage" is used to describe either the cohort expansion stage of a phase 2+ trial
(not EXACTLY defined terms, but I think you can see) or to describe studies which attempt to gain further
information from study of patients who received a treatment in an already-completed study (or sometimes
"in the wild").


A phase 3 trial is one designed to enable regulatory approval (more than one is generally needed in the
US, but they may be quite similar). It is considered futile to initiate a phase 3 without prior agreement to
the design from key regulatory bodies--this is now a bottleneck in new drug development [the prior
approval generally extends to the procedures and the endpoints, but prior specification of target levels for
the endpoints is less common].


Drugs ARE occasionally approved without formal phase 3 trials, but that isn't something to bet your own
money on.

I know EXACTLY what is happening with the interferon trials, including the ropeginterferon . I know exactly
what Hofman, Silver and others are doing. I also know that interferon is never durable and that
doctors/researchers don't know why that is. If patients get low blood counts, interefron will be aborted. This
problem will occur earlier when JAK and INF are combined. It is only temporarily effective in early stage
MF for a subgroup. Both Jakafi and interferon stop working after a while. After that there are no options
anymore and patients will slide into advanced stage of the disease. That's why doctors tend to chose for
transplant in an earlier stage of the disease (eg. intermediate 1). And that is why the disease modifying
capability of imetelstat (targeting the malignant clone) is so important and unique.

Continuation stage refers to the continuation of JnJ with the collaboration agreement. Next phases of the
trials will fall into that stage. JnJ will decide about the collaboration after the primary analysis.


In the continuation stage JnJ will start various exploratory indications and a P2/3 AML trial. That's what
slide 18 says.

If you know EXACTLY, and are talking here, somebody is involved in a major ethical violation. The
investigators in NCT02742324 have not yet disclosed results, and they are entitled to control of them.
Since the "primary completion" date has passed and final completion is listed for October, we should know
something [ethically] soon enough.


Ruxo + interferon is mostly a "two hits along the same pathway" approach. Some such combinations have
worked much better than either component alone (I think instantly of trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole)

1Q18 MF median OS review and related upcoming reporting
Fri Feb 09, 2018 7:12 pm


This is an email question to Anna Krassowska, Geron IR and her explanation responses. While I think most are
hoping for some specific details in near term communications, knowing the data has still not matured continues to
be helpful. As basically all of us are hopeful for our friends and family and as investors that Geron, JNJ/Jansen
and the FDA will find in the data review the reasons mandating a positive detailed update and possibly early
approval. However continuing with the thought that more mature data is required, continues to be very positive.
Anyway, so while not providing any additional “new” news I felt this might still be of interest to the ImetelChat board
and those who can provide any additional thoughts or insight around Anna’s responses.
======================...
Initial Email question:


Dear Anna, 
Given that we investors believe the majority of their Geron investment and future is apparently now riding on the
outcome of the OS results in the MF trial being reviewed in 1Q18. Hopefully we will be told the number of months
over the median, the number of patients still alive versus total. Of course any numbers on CR, PR or CI’s would be
greatly appreciated as well.
Can you provide any insight now on what we could expect in the coming weeks regarding press releases,
conference calls, etc. and the information expected to be provided describing CT results to date? Otherwise, our
frustration regarding the data desert continues to the detriment of investors and hopeful family and friends with MF,
MDS, ET, MM, etc. diseases. Thank you for reading and hopefully responding on all points not affecting
competitive advantage. 
Best regards,


Anna’s initial reply:
Thank you for your email.


The IMbark Q1 data review is not the primary analysis. Investors should not expect results from IMbark to be
presented following the Q1 data review, primarily because the OS data, which are an important component, are
not expected to be sufficiently mature. May I also ask what you mean by the statement “number of months over
median”? I ask because I am sensing a potential misunderstanding that I think might be important.


Best regards,



https://seekingalpha.com/author/dividend-latitude

https://seekingalpha.com/user/6316691
Anna


Clarification of email question:
Dear Anna,


Thank you for your quick reply, very much appreciated!


I do apologize for my scrambled thoughts. I can try to explain hopefully more clearly by saying, various reports and
blogs and listening to Dr. Scarlett’s presentations indicate that JNJ’s study of median OS indicates approximately 7
months and MD Anderson Cancer Center 14 months. I believe approximately 12 months is Dr. Scarlett’s latest
conservative target of existing median OS for R/R MF patients. So what I was attempting to ask was how many
months past Dr. Scarlett’s median OS target are we currently regarding the IMbark trial. Also, if possible, it would
be extremely reassuring to know how many patients and / or percentage are still alive assuming that information is
available for investors and those suffering from MF following the 1Q18 review?


Now I do appreciate your dilemma with communicating median OS, as there are likely many disease
characteristics involved and considered along with the staggered entry into the CT, etc. At this juncture, knowing
that median OS hasn’t been reached continues to be reassuring for all of us and our families, which is what I
believe you are saying with the terms “not expected to be sufficiently mature”. I am hoping (requesting if possible)
that some details will be provided in the near term communications around the fact that the data is not yet
sufficiently mature. Thanks again for your feedback and contributions.


Best regards,


Anna’s reply:


Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed response to my question. Please do not apologize. I thought
that is what you probably meant, but I just wanted to be sure. I interact with investors from all different
backgrounds!


In general terms, estimating expected survival in a patient population is challenging. And this is especially true in a
population that has never really been studied in a clinical trial setting. We have described survival estimates that
have been published, as you cited in your email. A major caveat is the extent to which the patients enrolled in a
clinical trial actually correspond to or match the patients in a “historical” population. This is why, as you know, to
truly assess the improvement in survival resulting from a drug treatment one conducts a randomized, controlled
trial. IMbark is not such a trial. Of course, one can make estimates based on the available information and use
those estimates to guide decisions about further development.


I understand that investors and patients are interested to see the current survival data from the ongoing trial.
However, such data can be misleading before being sufficiently mature – I like to use the analogy of tasting the
raw cake batter in order to know how the final baked product will turn out.


We have guided investors that they should not expect results to be reported following the Q1 data review. As with
the other data reviews, we expect to update investors if there are any changes to the conduct of the trial, or if there
is an update on timing for the primary analysis, based on the number of deaths. But not the data itself.
This answer may not be satisfying, but I hope that it is informative and helpful.


Your support of Geron, and your personal interest in success of drugs, including imetelstat, for the treatment of
patients with these devastating diseases, is truly appreciated.


Warm regards,
Anna

Own GERN. Bought and sold it several times.


Also own JNJ.....checked their website to see if GERN is even mentioned. Could not find anything. That said,
means little, because JNJ is partnered with dozens of developmental biotechs.


GERN is less than 1% of my portfolio, therefore it's just a bet!!


If Imetelstat is a "no go' JNJ is down $45 million in a $80 billion company. If GERN get's the drug OK'd it will
$20.00 plus a share.


I also owned EXEL at $3.00, which, went to $32.00 (currently $27.00). This is like betting on the Tampa Bay Rays
to win the World Series or the Cleveland Browns to win the Super Bowl........if they do....WIN WIN WIN.


JNJ will quickly "dump" GERN if the prospects are no good. They haven't done that yet, so GERN is either $.25 or
$20.00!! It's certainly not like betting on AMZN at $1200.00 a share or TSLA at $300.00 a share!

"Complaint"? For WHAT? Bringing Geron to the attention of new investors? For celebrating the heroes of

Look, most people have never HEARD of Geron or imetelstat. Now, Seeking Alpha has the beginnings of
an awareness campaign. There's a theme here that will make the GERN meme stick in the mind, and it
was all started by MTB.


First, MTB used the Scott Adams persuasion technique. He linked Imetelstat to "Toxicity". Now, Alpha
Exposure has built on that foundation, pairing Imetelstat with "Death".

I NEVER posted that, as you very well know. I have corrected you on this one already. I said that
imetelstat of today will not be the same as the imetelstat in 5 years. You are adding 'toxicity' to it to put a

Various people have posted already observations that this article is twisting existing information and brings
forward pertinent lies (like: Mayo trial stopped enrolling because of toxicity). There has been ZERO
information/evidence about a direct relationship between deaths occurring and imetelstat. If the FDA would
have the impression that such a relationship could exist, they IMMEDIATELY would have stopped the trials
a long time ago and certainly wouldn't give FTD (just look at what they did with the fedratinib trial). So
even the title of the article has nothing to do with the facts and events we know.

Excuse me but I preached the market disconnect to GERN's pps 5 years ago and many here have
preached about the control of the shorts in holding back the pps. Saying "Something Ain't Quite Right"
incessantly for years is not meaningful or credit worthy.

The "Alpha Exposed Lying Rat" article used the Adam Feuerstein article to indicate Feuersteins' skepticism with
the successful results of Tefferis' Pilot Study; and then indicated that Feuersteins' conclusions were validated with
2 deaths being reported in the trial. This is a gross fabrication and misrepresentation of the facts as Feuerstein,
although skeptical, could only point to a lack of reported clinical responses, but acknowledged the bone
marrow/blood response. He further(maybe unwittingly prophetic) stated that "maybe doctors will treat

I don't see any combo with jakafi. The goal really should not be a spleen size reduction but to prevent the
spleen from blowing up with blood cells in the first place. The spleen size goal is total B.S. and a side
effect of how jakafi works not really a goal in itself. Go the core/cause with proper treatment and the
spleen will better behave itself. That's where IMET performs on the bone marrow and any combo agent
should not be about spleen reduction as a primary goal.

So in summary we have a huge run up of 30-40% a slight sell off the highs and then this hit piece comes out.
Looking back at the past few weeks someone knows something or someone is buying huge numbers bolstered by
our own knowledge that this is the best risk reward stock of all time( of course some of you have hindsight ). Now
we see the buying was not short covering to any big extent(numbers are higher and now 33 million). Just imagine
how fearful the shorts are now because even that hit piece only worked to a minor degree. So even though I do
not write as eloquent as TELO or as knowledgable as many readers and investors of GERN I can conclude the
following. This stock is going much higher and I am buying more Monday before we get to far into this stock
moving past its recent high. Read between the lines and listen to the many experts on this board. We will win
along with patients.

True... I was shocked to see that no shorts covered. Apparently there aren't any significant human shorts
(obviously "Mako" is short, but they are tiny... "real" funds are too big to fit into the ~70 million short interest
of GERN, and if they had, this historical article would have been in the WSJ, not SA). It's just oblivious
HFTs trading on nothing but GERN's long-term record of failure and loss.


If imet does in fact succeed, it looks like 33 million short shares will have to cover at the buyout price.

67. Specifically, Alpha Exposure disclosed in a June 21, 2013 Seeking Alpha article
that it submitted a FOIA request letter to the SEC concerning Uni-Pixel, Inc. (“Uni-Pixel”).
Alpha Exposure’s article hyperlinked to a partially redacted response letter from the SEC, which
redacted its true identity, but did not redact the fact that the SEC received Alpha Exposure’s
request on June 10, 2013 and denied it in full.
68. The SEC, in turn, keeps public FOIA “logs” that record metadata for the FOIA
requests that it receives. FOIA logs are public and available on the SEC’s website.2 The
metadata recorded by FOIA logs reflect information such as the requestor’s name, the subject of

the request (e.g., company name), the date the SEC receives a request, the date it closes a request
and its final disposition.
69. Here, the SEC’s public FOIA records could not be clearer about the identity of
“Alpha Exposure.” The log dated FY 2013 reveals that the SEC received a FOIA request
concerning Uni-Pixel on June 10, 2013, the same date that the SEC received Alpha Exposure’s
request, and that the request was made by someone named “August, Nathaniel” of “Mangrove
Partners.” The log further reveals that August’s request was “[d]enied in full” and closed on
June 21, 2013, which again conforms to the SEC letter that Alpha Exposure hyperlinked in its
June 21, 2013 Seeking Alpha article.
70. Moreover, the same SEC log shows that the only FOIA request concerning UniPixel
in all of FY 2013 was from “August, Nathaniel” of “Mangrove Partners.” This irrefutable
fact, coupled with Alpha Exposure’s June 21, 2013 article, amount to conclusive proof that
August and Mangrove are, in fact, “Alpha Exposure.”
71. “Alpha Exposure” again leaked its identity through a slipshod admission in a
November 19, 2015 post on its blog (http://bit.ly/2BRcB44). In that post, Alpha
Exposure, after publicizing a FOIA letter it had sent the SEC demanding information on Eros,
divulged that its “last” FOIA request to the SEC concerned Uni-Pixel – which, as the SEC’s
FOIA log reveals, was made by none other than August himself

"Mangrove has had a successful record of shorting biotech shares, though it doesn’t always win. August
believed Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) had set its goals too high this past May during Phase 3 testing of a
drug, called Sustol, designed to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Test results, however,
turned out positive—good news for chemo patients, but not so much for Mangrove. It covered at a loss."


Manipulating the market via SA articles = perfectly legal and no one is going after them. Literally no one

Adam Feuersteins'conclusions: The current study signifies the potential value of telomerase-based treatment
strategies in MF and identifies imetelstat as an active drug in that regard. The observed morphologic and
molecular remissions confirm selective anti-clonal activity, which has thus far eluded other drugs in MF, including
JAK inhibitors. The association between response and spliceosome mutations suggests a broader application for
the drug in myeloid malignancies.


There was buzz surrounding imetelstat going into Thursday's abstract release because the drug may have
legitimate disease-modifying potential in bone marrow cancers like myelofibrosis.


Incyte's (INCY - Get Report) Jakafi is approved to treat myelofibrosis but only provides symptomatic relief -- mainly
by reducing the size of a patient's enlarged spleen, a hallmark of the disease.


Imetelstat, on the other hand, appears to be effective in the bone marrow, meaning the drug could to slow or even
stop the malignancies which cause diseases like myelofibrosis.


Here's a simple way to think about imetelstat's potential: Neither Jakafi nor any other similar (JAK inhibitor) drugs
being studied in myelofibrosis today are capable of producing a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR).
At best, these drugs only provide clinical improvement (CI) in myelofibrosis patients.


But here's the hiccup on the imetelstat data revealed this morning, which I alluded to above: No clinical or
symptomatic responses were reported, only bone marrow and blood response. The International Working Group
(IWG) response criteria for myelofibrosis says a CR and a PR need to have bone marrow/blood response and
clinical response, which usually means reduction in the size of the spleen.


Maybe doctors will treat myelofibrosis patients with a combination of imetelstat and Jakafi? Perhaps, but
thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) is a significant overlapping toxicity of both drugs. That might cause some
problems.


Let the debate over Geron's myelofibrosis drug imetelstat rage on! We'll see updated results next month at the



https://seekingalpha.com/user/12780131

https://seekingalpha.com/user/12487711

After rereading this article I have to conclude Adam had it right except for his hiccup statement putting too much
importance on spleen reduction.
Let there be no doubt that Imetelstat is J&Js' next billion dollar blockbuster!!

JS indicated on several occasions that they were seeing CI's so that is not completely accurate. Spleen
reductions were also seen but just not to the degree as with jakafi only performing frontline testing under
less stringent IWG criteria. jakafi obviously cannot even do anything with the R/R backline patients that
Imetelstat is testing. By definition, jakafi never worked or stopped working for these R/R more severe
patients yet Imetelstat is getting CIs and some spleen reductions. So think of jakafi in backline as being
zero effective and Imetelsat goes beyond jakafi obtaining CI's and some spleen reductions and OS.

The FDA has essentially accepted to date IMETELSTAT as a very safe drug and that's one of the great reasons

Wiz, why go off the deep end? The FDA has accepted the risk/benefit of imetelstat is all fine. To call it a

Tefferi said he didn't see any grade 3/4 on-hematologic toxicity at all (Youtube: Tefferi+imetelstat). He then
says that the drug deserves respect regarding myelosuppression. There was grad 3/4 for
neutropenia's/thromcyt... observed (which is dangerous because of bleeding/infection risk), but was fully
manageable with dosing amount and schedule.


Dr. Raza said that imetelstat was actually demonstrating less side effects than SoC: lenalidome and
HMA's.


Who do we believe? These two top doctors (who actually are working with the drug and who have seen
the bone marrow and molecular impact of imetelstat), or this charlatan who is short and doesn't respond to
any of the comments and who wants Geron to go bankrupt and keep this medicine away from dying
patients? I'd rather die than earning my money that way. I am sure there will be lawyers looking at this and

The only truth here is the ImBark trial update hasn't been presented.


IMerge is in Part 2 and Part 1 showed non-del(5q) mutation patients that represent 85% of all MDS patients have
received a 54% response to transfusion independence verses about 27% for Revlimid patients.


AML is the next step, very likely using Venetoclax and Imetelstat in combination as, in vivo, it has shown an 88%
ability to stay in remission, Imetelstat showing an even greater response than Venetoclax, an FDA approved drug
by Abbvie.


This article is nothing but an attempt at short-term profit by a short seller. Nothing more, nothing less!


Today is another great day because we haven't reached median survival in the ImBark trial. As far we know, and

I am buying on this one thank you for the opportunity to buy more. 
You have missed the boat on a ton of what you wrote about:
1. ET was never to be a path to approval it was a proof of concept or hypothesis. It proved that Imetelstat causes a
molecular response. An ET phase 3 trial would take 27 years and no one would take that path. Tefferi himself said
no company would ever run a full ET trial because of the cost and length of time. 
2. The FDA hold came after a patient who had a 40 year chronic hepatitis history died of liver failure and even an
Dr. involved in the trial had said it was impossible to determine if the patient died because of Imetelstat or his
hepatitis. The FDA took the conservative route and Geron did the studies required to lift the hold. 
3. The supplemental data given to the FDA from the October 10 Q has likely already been reviewed and no news
is seen as good news as evidenced by the recent rise and the continued outlook by JNJ for Imetelstat progression.
4. NSCL cancer trial had a median OS increase of 8 months but the PFS was not significant enough for
continuation except in a subset population with short telomeres. Geron chose their best target for approval based
on the data from the ET trial even though if you read the final results of the NSCL trial. You would have read that
the results showed continued investigation of Imetelstat in that indication is warranted. 
5. the imetelstat & paclitaxel combination did not work because both drugs had the same dose limiting effect of
thrombocytopenia. Because of them both causing thrombocytopenia the trial was using a lower dose of paclitaxel
than normal and the lowering of this dose caused that the PFS to lower in the trial. It was poor design that caused
the failure. They are finding out that Imetelstat combos with PARP3AB inhibitors and inhibitors of CDKN1A.

J&J didn’t pay $35M and offer nearly $1B on a whim...the diseases the drug is being tested against have zero
other options...it’s a straight line killer within 5 years. Do the study results show the stages of the patients that had
trouble? No. Like nearly all meds, starting treatment in early stages of diseases is key. The 30% that achieved
remission may be early in the disease. And, I think most patients and the FDA will take a 30% chance of survival
(or more once stages of beginning treatment are scrubbed from the data) versus certain death. The side effects
are also manageable. What it looks like is the Gleevec blockbuster developed by Novartis. Similar approach of
targeting a specific enzyme (specific protein for Gleevec) to get to a root cause solution.

'In addition, we want to point out that the Pilot Study's enrollment was discontinued early, which suggests to us that
the trial wasn't promising in later results and/or that the Mayo Clinic may have found the safety profile of imetelstat
unacceptable.'


EVERY trial will discontinue at a certain point, no matter how successful a drug is. Do you think a single healthcare
center can enroll an endless number of patients?


You ignore the most important fact: that the trial is still going on, which suggests that patients are still benefiting
and that the safety profile is acceptable and manageable. If you would taken the effort of looking at the CT site you
would have known that.


Have you spoken with the Mayo Clinic? Can you provide any evidence of your assumption? Dr. Tefferi has a very
different opinion from what you say:
'We have not seen any grad 3 or 4 toxicity at all. We were very happy with that' 
http://bit.ly/PUocn6


Your reasoning is against all logic and against the facts. If the Mayo data would have proven that imet has an
unacceptable safety profile (as you suggest), why then:
1) is the FDA allowing the trials to go on while keeping patients exposed to this drug
2) why would JnJ have entered into the license agreement in the first place
3) why would the FDA have granted FTD
4) why would Dr. Raza say that imetelstat side effects are manageable and even less severe then in well known
and approved drugs like lenalidome and HMA's?


The criticism in your article is so heavily constructed and factually wrong, that I can't take it seriously. It is
unbelievable that SA allows this kind of dubious articles on its site.

It's 2018 and we're still discussing GERN, how amazing is that? This is just one of many signs that we've been in a
multi-year biotech bubble. GERN could open at $0 tomorrow and it would have literally zero impact in the world.
Actually, it would be a positive to the extent they are no longer destroying capital that could be used for something
productive.


Come back and check these comments after the bubble ends, it will be hilarious.


"I see this article as a positive sign for the stock. When shorts start to put pressure like this so they can cover it's
the last piece of the puzzle."

Ever? The cerebral hemorrhage death in the Mayo series was secondary to aplastic anemia. The situation
followed an extra dose of imetelstat, and was considered clearly related at the time. (The patient was said
to be in terminal decline due to MF when the extra dose was decided upon, but still...)

'but still...'
But still what? A patient that is in terminal decline will be heavily anemic already. Cerebral hemorrage is
being caused by thrombocytopenia, a totally well known side effect. They probably tried imetelstat as a
last instance. So they took a risk. What risk do patients take when treated with stem cell transplant, the
only curative yet highly risky option? For very advanced patients this is not even an option anymore.
Today, after having worked with the drug for a couple of years, all relevant parties say that anemia and
thrombocytopenia (i.e. caused by myelosuppression) can be managed. I am sure you are aware of that.


11 Feb 2018, 04:56 AM

i'm trying to be soft-spoken. A patient (admittedly one who was already mortally ill) WAS killed by
imetelstat toxicity. Once qualifies as "ever"


11 Feb 2018, 12:32 PM


fishermangents
So that is one incident, if you are right. I haven't seen the actual source of that claim, so please show me.
But does that justify the title that imetelstat is haunted by deaths during its entire history? Come on!


How many patients die from stem cell transplant, the ONLY curative option for MF patients? I can tell you:
within the 1st year it is between 15-20% treatment related mortality. After three years it is about 50%
treatment related mortality. If AML comes in it is only 10%. So we maybe have officially 1 death reported.
Can you then honestly speak about a 'history of deaths', like these charlatans of this article are doing and
which you obviously are supporting?


11 Feb 2018, 03:30 PM


Anonymous Wizard
Seriously, if someone is so advanced and mortally ill with no hope, how would a shot of jakafi fare ? These
proclamations are so out of whack to make IMET responsible as a last resort responsible for a death here.
If someone is 10 breaths away from death and you inject a drug and they die 10 breaths later, is that the
drugs fault ?


11 Feb 2018, 07:44 PM

We could get into "interesting" medico-legal territory, but all I'm pushing here is that at least one patient
DID die from adverse effects of imetelstat. I recall an affecting account of the circumstances by Tefferi, but
it was long ago and a search would be more work than I care to put in.

Not that it can't happen with predisposed and treated very ill patients, but there's a point that any drug
given would not be tolerated and I seem to recall a patient death wherein it was declared that it had
nothing to do with IMET itself but other extenuating circumstances.


12 Feb 2018, 03:38 PM


fishermangents
NOTHING, but only official reports or statements from JnJ, Geron or maybe the FDA regarding the
occurrence of deaths can substantiate the claim of these authors, that imetelstat has a 'history of deaths'.
The problem for the author is: THERE ARE NO SUCH REPORTS! Their claim, which suggests a range of
death incidents over a long period of time, can't be supported by a single incident.


It is far more likely that the authors have fabricated this article, with the purpose to bring damage to the
reputation of Geron and imetelstat, and thus bringing down the PPS. Their motivation is to cover their
short position against the lowest price.


They are not responding to any of the comments, which tells a lot. They are just interested in the effect of
the article, not in contributing to a balanced opinion. Hit and run, hoping nobody catches you.

Fish, as I recall the pediatric brain cancer trial was stopped after two deaths.


12 Feb 2018, 04:14 PM


fishermangents
This is part of the conclusions of that trial:


Title of the study:
A molecular biology and phase II study of imetelstat (GRN163L) in children with recurrent or refractory
central nervous system malignancies: a pediatric brain tumor consortium study.


'Two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study
closure. No objective responses were observed. Telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for at least 8 days.'


Thrombocytopenia is a known and manageable side effect. Lack of platelets obviously lead to bleeding in
the tumor. Geron abandoned all the pediatric indications and tests, to which the EMA waved the obligation
for Geron to test on children in the approval process. This test is not representative for adults and
hematologic malignancies, to which Geron is now exclusively focusing.

12 Feb 2018, 05:07 PM

There are no reported deaths in IMbark and IMerge, or in any of the other adult trials. The pediatric one is
a case on its own. And as we know, that path is abandoned. That's probably why I din't count that in when
I made that statement. But if you do - and that is fine - then it still doesn't justify the generalized statement
'a history of deaths'. In addition, it puts things far out of the perspective of the current trials, where they
continuously say that myelosuppression is manageable.

you could do that if Geron had a competent CEO and BoD. Who knows maybe your article does some good and
the BoD decides to act and either publishes some data to support Imet or they force the CEO out. JMHO

"he does make a extremely good point" Please don't make me laugh. No he does not make a good point
(let alone "extremely"). There may be many different reasons. Has management provided any hard solid
numbers on the current trial? A more plausible explanation has more to do with Geron not being able to
disclose anything J&J does not want disclosed (Again that is our CEOs fault for negotiating the way he
did). As many people know I've been very critical of Geron. However I recognize a "hit piece" when I see it

Throughout all these sell offs, there have been buyers of every share. To make this article valid in the

for trade with no buyers. Truth has a way of keeping buyers in and Fidelity still has a large position of
almost 24 million shares, as do other large institutions who own millions. But I guess they are just
gamblers as well, according to the ever so truthful short philosophy and narrative .

'My personal experience with the drug has not been intense myelosuppression at all. It's reversible,
manageable. It is something we see with HMA's, something we see with lenalidomide. In fact, to me it's
less than with some of those agents.'

I'd trust her too, but she can't approve anything in a timely manner. She has nothing to do with the
valuation of Geron unfortunately.

Bridge to sell
I see this article as a positive sign for the stock. When shorts start to put pressure like this so they can cover it's
the last piece of the puzzle. None of that is to say that factually he's wrong, he has just chosen to cherry pick the
negative and apply a negative bias to the unknown. If longs are ok doing that for their side of the thesis they don't
really have the right to complain when someone frames the known facts in the opposite light.

Confirmation_Biased,


Unfortunately you are wrong here. Whomever shorted high a few days ago might be covering today and
taking profits, however there is no positive with short covering. Without real positive news/data from the
company the stock can not be supported by short buying.


Not all shorts are covering and there is obviously selling to protect capital. I got out of a what was
supposed to be a profitable long term position. the risk to reward for that capital is not so great.

I like that, Bias. They have to come out of their creepy little holes to put their fat AASS on this stock. They
want to get out. I certainly see some desperation here.

you think they were 'so desperate' to get out? I think not. Lets see what happens to the price next week.
Not all stocks drop in a bear market, and many even move up.


we will know 100% certainly why Geron moved up this week and now back down.

"instant profits".
A convinced long knows it'll take at least a decade to bring a medecine to the market.

yeah, why was Geron up 20% recently. I don't think the short position has changed much now given this
new event, but i could be wrong. The past few days tells us one thing.


This market has some way to fall, and Geron will fall hard with the market, unless management and BoD
come up with data. Geron otherwise has 'no value' and can swing -$1 very easily in this turbulent market.

Rodney the strategy apparently works. They know Geron extremely well and may have played it on the

09 Feb 2018, 10:34 AM

They're only looking for 50-75 cent swings in the up and down direction and then short high and cover low.
They're never waiting for "zero". No one wins with Geron but the traders Rodney.

Exactly. The last two glowing articles, in all probability, exaggerated on the long end and led to a short

between real news is a given.

No, they didn't. This article is the ultimate evidence of that. They need at least sub 1.50 (or lower) to get
out. The sudden raise of pps last week came unsuspected and now this desperate charlatan needs to
publish lies and manipulated information to get pps down, before real good news may come out. So we
can actually see this article as an indicator for upcoming positive news.


09 Feb 2018, 07:37 PM

The river card will be dealt to all of us, long or short, at the same time very soon. The funny thing is we
(JNJ) know the card, as this is a phase 2/an open trial, shorts don’t, so I will make this kind of bet at any
single day.


I don’t even want to debunk or even finish reading the article, did JNJ just update their top list on 1/23,
2018? Has imetelstat passed the expected median OS already?


Have a nice weekend.

Fisherman,
Sorry,author listed FDA concerns with imetelstat,he listed all the RED FLAGS...which one is a lie as you
claim?...which one?.I see facts,not desperation,in fact quite the opposite!
The way I see it is GERN is not in a very good position to pass efficacy or safety benchmarks and
represents a VERY,VERY RISKY bet in an already risky investment group.I don't own and DON'T plan to
do so EVER!

NOTHING says that this request comes from certain 'concerns'.


FDA has the responsibility to approved drugs to be used by the public. So asking for more information

The FDA is concerned about EVERY drug which in the approval process. Nothing special for imetelstat.

MedTechBio, Contributor
Don't be fooled, buy with two fists Monday morning. There is so much genius in this article, especially
about the Mayo trial with world renowned blood cancer researcher and professor Dr. Tefferi. Article
suggests the pilot study wasn't promising, meanwhile, it led the world's largest pharma company to invest
$1B plus. That pilot study still has patients taking Imetelstat today, 4 years after they should have been
dead. I trust JNJ. Don't even get me started on the other points. Article is using 10K boilerplate info in a
misleading way. Funny thing, this is the first time I've seen section headers higlighted in BOLD RED. Then
of course FDA issuing Fast Track designation just a few months ago. Here's the best news about this
article, the risk is so enormous on the short side they had to resort to this.

"I trust JNJ."


I absolutely agree. JNJ has deep knowledge of oncology, hematology, pharmacology, the pharmaceutical
business, Imetelstat, clinical trials, and FDA regulations.


As long as they are partnered with Geron, the risk/reward seems positive.

Has anyone else noticed the timing of this article just happen to come when the RSI was flashing overbought?
This is a typical sort strategy. Post a seeming well researched article on SA bashing the stock and watch it drop. I
emphasize the word seemingly because it completely ignores the counterpoints on the extreme effectiveness of
Imetelstat at killing small cell cancer. The FDA has approved drugs with considerably worse safety profiles.

No. Fidelity is not a hedge fund. For a little while they tried re-selling interests in hedge funds, but they
gave even that up in 2016. And they are not "long and short at the same time in the same stocks"... how
would that make any money anyway?


Fidelity makes money from fees. Lots and lots of money. They don't have to try to make desperate
guesses about market direction or individual drug trial successes... it's their customers taking all the risk,
not them.

lev,
Just a small comment (and one that reflects my experience based on daily trading for a couple of
decades), I don't think ANYONE that has little experience in the Market "knows the risk" in investing in
early-stage biotech- be it, preclinical, clinical, p1, p2 or p3.


Reminds me of a story. When I was a youngster my folks took me on vacation to Niagra Falls, Ca. It was
great and I purchased a tourist guidebook on the history of the Falls and the misadventures that happened
when various daredevils went over the Falls in a barrel. The section on one man's decision to "wing it"
particularly made an impression on me. It seems this hapless soul wanted fame and fortune and decided
his best chance was to go over the Falls in a barrel. So, he obtained a hogshead, nailed some leather
straps on the inside for his arms and hauled it up to the top of the Falls and was set to go over. However,
when someone suggested he'd need some ballast to stabilize the barrel, he decided to strap an anvil to
his feet. Well, when they retrieved the barrel down below the Falls all they found were the guy's
arms, still in the leather straps. 
The story seems appropriate for early stage biotech investors to always bear in mind.

That's a good story 277......I just wonder, when all is said and done, that people on this forum actually read
carefully not only what people may say, but how they say it.


Yes, I'm a financial advisor, and yes, I have a bullish bias towards Geron, always have, and hope to be
able to say, always will.


However, in my business it's really important to TRY and phrase posts and responses by using words like:


may, might, could, likely, have the chance to, has the potential to, possibly, etc, etc, etc.


Almost all my posts use those terms and expressions in order to convey not only what my opinions are,
but to have the reader understand that nothing here is wrotten in stone.


It really pisses me off when some, a small few, yes, decide to brand me as a cheerleader, or a bullish
numbskull, who has no idea of the risk involved. I've been in the markets since I was 19, and believe me, I
know the risks involved.


Saying positive things is fine, it's a reflection of being a positive person, and I can't guarantee all my posts
are perfect, who's is; however, saying something "may" happen is far different from saying something
WILL happen.


Some people just need to play the devil's advocate, which is fine. Just don't put other's down in the

If you read my comment, I called this article a "hit piece." Is "hatchet job" a better choice of words?


I get very tired of my motives being questioned, when I post a comment that is not entirely positive. I am
long and expect to profit from the misadventure.... eventually.


However, this is not a sure thing. There are good reasons to be skeptical about Geron's potential and the
company leadership, but we can't have a reasonable discussion of the pros and cons. ANY comment that
isn't about the sure path to Turtle Island is attacked as negative, and there is no real discussion. Tired of it.

Div, the Fidelity sale was the only transaction of its size. You are the one trying to evade the question of

Imet actually has a biological effect. (It appears that the clinical importance might be more the hTR effect
rather than the telomere effect I measured with my TRFs in 2003, but that's biology for you). That's the
positive here.... and it's a big one.


Now back to the negative. Why is Fidelity, who has held all this time, selling now?

Did the author(s) of the article go short at an average price of 2.35, with an expectation that the price will go down
to .47? Or did they go short below 2.00 completely, and when the price hit 2.35 and higher, did the author(s)
decide to publish their altruistic article? Can anyone help me with my math? Is it possible that the author(s) will
reveal the size of their position? Or am I being naive? If it is 1,000 shares or so, the potential loss is manageable.
But if the size is 10,000 or more, the loss could be significant. And why would the author(s) not reveal the size of
the shorted position they took, and at what price? Gern did hold up well in the recent downdraft, and maybe it is
undergoing reaccumulation. Anyway, I don't mean to ramble on, but can anyone help me with my math?

Sure. And you don't think that MTB's "$4 support level" was a bit manipulative? Personally, I love MTB's
work. It's well-researched, it's openly bullish, and it's not trying to be completely balanced. MTB isn't trying
to replace your DD, he's presenting the bull case, trying to show that there is a possible future where imet
overcomes all the obstacles.


I didn't like Alpha Exposures' "price target of zero" not because it was "negative"... the guy clearly stated
he was short. I didn't like it because it's not based on anything substantive. It shows the author wasn't
doing any serious analysis. No one could be "manipulated" by this article unless they literally didn't even
look at GERN's finances and patent portfolio.

What I’m saying in the above post is investors remain confused about GERN and about the partnership with JNJ.
There’s a distinct lack of clarity with regard to crucial issues like the connection between the MF trial and the MDS
trial and if the latter is dependent upon the former. I believe this lack of clarity is reflected in the present stock
price. Investors are left guessing, speculating and deducing. One expects that in a biotech stock. I get that. But
should one reasonably expect that confusion to go on for years? Cannot GERN do a better job of informing its
investors, and cannot this be done without sacrificing any so-called competitive advantage? If Imet is a unique
drug with unusual properties what competitive advantage would GERN/JNJ place in danger by communicating
with its shareholders? When does “competitive advantage” become an excuse for lack of communication and

why does the management purposely confuse investors with a quest to buyout risky ventures? Perhaps
this will all take a long time to fruition, management knows that, and low share prices can only be
beneficial to insiders who are waiting to be compensated.

I think Geron tends to go up when the market is down. The market makers get a great chance to short higher and
suck traders into a 'stable price'. Then when the market goes back up again, Geron falls of course and the market
makers take their profits, neat eh?

Come on man! Any fair minded person can see this article for what it is; I think if you did just a little bit of digging to
provide backup for your comment, you'd find very few Geron articles receive "editor's pick." Take a look at the
number of "analysis" articles written about Geron and compare to how many received "editor's pick." Again, just
wondering if anyone knows the actual criteria SA uses to award Editor's Pick. All due respect, you love to make

telo obvioulsy supports this article. He is always critical to positive statements, playing down the influential
power of shorts, but he seems to agree with all this article says. That makes him a short, because they
estimate the valuation of imet + IP at ZERO. That means that they think that imetelstat will fail. That the
company goes bankrupt. Nobody who thinks that a drug will fail and the company goes bust, buys 5000
extra shares of that company.

Black, when an article starts with a few lines, stating a non-fact, and on the other hand a fact, than it is
pretty obvious what the auther's purpose is :


Begin to read again the first lines of the article : 
Non-Fact : ...It appears ... may be ... may result ....we think...
Fact : We are short GERN


Everybody his/hers opninion. 
Here is mine in a few words, and compare that to auther's conclusion. It is completely different, and
therefore the calculations are not comparable at all.


Personally I do not at all value imetelstat at zero.
It has great potential to be a help for patients, and to become a needed medicine on the commercial
market later.

A blockbuster? I don't know. Too early to say that.
So my target price for GERN has nothing to do with the current cash on its balance sheet right now.


At this moment, the most important future date for GERN, you can find in slide 19 : the latest time for
Janssen when "Continuation Decision" is expected, which is the latest on Q4 2018 or Q1 2019.
Off course it is possible they release it during spring, summer, autumn or winter months of 2018. 
But reality is that they have time for this decision till 31th of March 2019.


I rest my Case.

If the survival benefits are as good as they appear for mf, I cannot imagine doing a randomized trial. I would
actually go so far as to say it would be unethical and would not be approved. When the average lifespan for the

lifespan, especially if it is double or triple, it would be terribly unethical to give that patient placebo or even

11 Feb 2018, 04:31 PM

My guess would be that because the average patient has only been in the trial 21 ish months and some
much less, that it may not be statistically significant yet. They may be able to look at the number of
patients still alive and have a very good idea that the life expectancy will be double or triple, but they may
not be able to prove it scientifically yet. As an example, what if a large proportion of the patients died in the
near future. Then that median number wouldn’t look that good then.


11 Feb 2018, 05:43 PM

aa: that could be a viable answer!


But, as far as CRs, PRs and CIs, Janssen should have a pretty good idea of what going on after over 2+
years of testing.

jacosa
Ok, this is a very old argument (it's the main theme in one chapter of "Microbe Hunters;" the "Experiment
perilous" part of Hippocrates's second most famous maxim probably refers to the same thing), with many
modern examples. In breast cancer, so long as it was "unethical" to deny patients radical mastectomy 25
years ago, or Avastin ~5 years ago, it wasn't seen that these interventions were [nearly] worthless. It is
perfectly obvious that "historical controls" must be validated carefully to have any meaning at all, and there
is not even a claim that such work has been done for IMBark. Simultaneous matched controls aren't
perfect, but they provide the best evidence to outsiders that a claimed effect is real. And the FDA is
outsiders.

Jacosa is right about worthless procedures and drugs continuing for decades because of lack of controls
(e.g. certain knee surgeries, some statins, there are thousands of known examples).


However, we're getting a lot better at understanding the cellular basis of cancer. Once truly effective anti-
cancer cocktails are developed, there won't be a need for controls, just for monitoring the improvement in
the patients.


12 Feb 2018, 02:20 PM

Well since jakafi is the only treatment for MF excepting stem cell therapy, and jakafi has basically a zero
control effect for MF R/R patients, it seems to me using jakafi as a zero baseline is your control for
secondline R/R MF CTs. In otherwords, if you can identify clear enough CIs over discontinuing jakafi or no
available treatment, any benefit can allow approval compared to just a quick death. OS plus any other
determined CIs seems to make sense as BAT.


12 Feb 2018, 03:47 PM


fishermangents
'they may not be able to prove it scientifically yet'
That's where the clinical doctors come in, who have actually looked to the patients at a molecular level in
the bone marrow and peripheral blood. In judging the merits of prolonged survival they need to see
improvements in allele burden, cytokines, blasts, fibrosis, blood counts etc. In those details prolonged
survival will be put into the perspective of potential disease modification and will be supportive in any FDA
decision.


JS already said various times that imet seems to target the malignant clone, for which they obviously saw
sufficient evidence to justify public announcement (also: G. Mosoyan et al 2017, Monika Haubitz et al
ASH2016 abstract 91467, G.M. Baerlocher et al NEJM 2015). Therefore I am hopeful that prolonged
survival with imet will be more meaningful than any survival benefit measured in other drugs like Jakafi.


13 Feb 2018, 08:40 AM


jacosa
So, they should do it (actually, since failure of Jakafi is an enrollment criterion, it might be better to use
hydroxyurea as an ineffective but plausible treatment...or even supportive treatment only). The key, which
hasn't been done, is to apply the same admission criteria to both the treatment and control groups, and to
generate a specific date for entry of each patient into the study. It is also generally done to compile specific
records of possibly-confounding patient attributes in case there is a later question about the matching of
test and control groups. (I know of a study in which this not only accounted for a surprising result, but also
altered the way clinicians judged activity of the disease)

A chart review of historical controls to determine comparability would be an improvement, [I expect that

Although I would agree it is desireable to compare apples to apples as much as possible to ascertain the
viability of the drug with all the many possible variations of the patient populations of control versus test
groups, the fact that there is no viable answer for these critically ill R/R MF patients lends itself to allowing
more flexibility in approving a new drug that seems to provide CI's plus has accrued a significant history
now and safety profile , versus just doing nothing and letting them die. This fact should have some weight
in FDA decision making.


13 Feb 2018, 10:40 AM


jacosa
So because Avastin helps colon cancer patients, give the breast cancer patients Avastin? And have FDA
support it? It is the old argument again, and pretty much every single time, whatever the initial answer
was, the right answer has been to get the evidence straight first.


Safety profile of imetelstat is not something I'd refer to with satisfaction. Yes: liver damage can be
managed, but it is still frequent. The only statements about AEs I have read from the present round of
trials is that they are comparable to prior experience--prior experience was a greater number of serious
AEs than patients.


I note that you refer to "these critically ill R/R MF patients." The inclusion criteria for NCT02426086 specify
"ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2"--these patients do not start as what most people think of as critically
ill (definition of status 2, the worst of these: "Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out
any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours").


14 Feb 2018, 10:07 AM


Anonymous Wizard
You are not comparing apples to apples. IMET is targeting MF and has been shown to clear the fibrosis.
It's not a leap from colon to breast cancer. IMET has a safety profile (all drugs have AE's like jakafi) only
tested frontline and fails R/R testing, that crosschecks across multiple indications and CTs and that history
now is becoming well known and the FDA has not only lifted those old bogus holds but has not injected
any further restrictions or holds. 
The nominal OS of the R/R MF population that IMET is testing is around 12 months so no matter how you
slice it, these are critically ill R/R patients that jakafi cannot help at all.

Based upon the recent emails from Anna I now fear investors may be setting themselves up for disappointment if
more information about the MF results is not forthcoming after the first quarter review. What exactly is Janssen
looking for with regard to the MF trial? What exactly does it mean to state that the data is not mature? How much
longer does GERN expect investors to decipher these cryptic messages?


And:


If Imet is as good as we think it is why, apparently, did JS have to force the issue w/ regard to the continuation
decision giving rise to the question of how committed Janssen is to Imet? If Imet is as good as we think it is why
would JS have to force Janssen to do anything?


And:


The results of the MDS trial are apparently quite encouraging. Is a Phase 3 MDS trial nonetheless still dependent
upon the results of the MF trial? Is not MDS a lucrative market and several times larger than MF? Did not Dr. Raza
unambiguously state that she and others are more than willing to use Imet for the treatment of MDS? If Imet is
really that good why is a Phase 3 MDS trial still dependent upon the results of the MF trial?


These, I believe, are the sort of questions the market will be asking about the future of GERN. Without some real
clarity w/ regard to these issues I fear GERN may be subject to an even greater sell-off. There are limits to the
patience of even the most committed investors.

Seriously, I don't give much weight to what Anna says. She'a in PR/IR and everything we've heard to date
from Scarlett, indicates that IMBARK is strictly being judged as a Phase 2 trial with no Phase 3 plan or
design and is geared towards acceleration. It's a R/R MF trial for very ill patients where jakafi FAILS FAILS
FAILS ! Get that ? If they change their minds or per the FDA direction, it's likely a concurrent Phase 3 with
acceleration of the drug. But there has to be enough benefit seen and 1stQ 2018 review is for directional
purposes. If they Go forward based on the the internal review (and with FDA feedback), then the target is
4th Q2018 for a data analysis and JNJ decision. At that point if it is determined IMET has enough benefit,
I'd expect acceleration and maybe a Phase 3.

Agree AW, Jacosa Scarlet mentioned that MDS trial may need phase 3 and MF trail is subject to acceleration(
once data is mature, they will apply for accelerated approval). The internal analysis will let them know they are on
track and by end of q3 or if earlier MOS is reached, they will begin the primary analysis and if data shows better
survival, they will apply for potential approval. ESTIMATED APPROVAL 2019.

I think you are pipe dreaming jacosa. Don't take a PR/IR comment as superior to anything already said by Scarlett.
Scarlett previously conferenced that IMBARK lends itself more to an accelerated approval process moreso than
IMERGE which already has a P3 design approved. Anything can happen here but if IMET gets wings based on OS
plus other CIs in the more difficult MF R/R population where jakafi clearly has failed, then the timeline completely
changes.

Alpha Exposure: welcome to the bullseye. Good luck dealing with the howling mob. You're probably right not to get
into it directly with them.


For the rest of everybody--recall that I'm an Incyte bull, not a Geron bear (and back in the so-called panel
discussion I had nice things to say about imetelstat's prospects against MDSs). So what I'll grab on to here is Anna
Krassowska's answer, which seems to indicate clearly that Geron expects approval of use of imetelstat against
myelofibrosis to require a trial with a simultaneous control group. The planning for such a trial can't begin until AT
LEAST the level of review that is supposedly being carried out on IMBark about now; it takes about 9-12 months to
get from start of planning for a pivotal trial to treatment of the first patient and then the trial takes however long it
takes, Review after the trial generally takes a year. Availability of imetelstat as a treatment for MF is other than
imminent. Meanwhile, there are two open label trials combining Jaka[fv]i with already-marketed drugs in the
attempt to reduce the number of non-responders and improve response in patients who already benefit [there are
also trials combining Jakafi with candidates in development]. The tiny mixed MF and PV study on which the soon-
to-report Jakavi + interferon all-MF study was based showed 100% deep responses in the 3 MF patients. By the
time imetelstat reaches the market, there is a large chance that there will be no unmet MF need.

'This is not a strong signal compared to Ruxolitinib alone'

(starts on 4:59)
Remark: with 'associations' he means 'combinations'


Poefhhhh.... there they go, with all your Jakafi combinations. They don't bring relevant benefits and are too
toxic.


About imetelstat he speaks as a promising and interesting drug, being able to bring remissions, including
reversal of the fibrosis.
(starts on 5:55)
'One of these new drugs that are the most appealing based on the results of the Phase2 trials, is off
course imetelstat."


Yes, he says 'OFF COURSE'.


Everybody should see this video, as it clearly positions imetelstat as the most promising drug in this
complex field of MPN's.

Almost forgot to say that he also says that Jakafi causes disease persistance and resistance against the

'showed 100% deep responses' 
Sure. Caused by interferon. It is well known that interferon is able to induce remissions, but certainly not in
advanced patients and certainly not long lasting. They are currently trying to find why interferon always
stops working.
Btw: interferon is myelosuppressive and is a difficult drug the deal with for patients. It makes you feel
depressed and weak.


Conclusion: in the end all patients on Jakafi + interferon will need to stop the drugs and then going
to.....imetelstat? Transplant?

I used to be very critical of interferon, but the really bad AEs were at much higher doses than are presently
being investigated.


From sad experience, I try very hard now not to assume the results of clinical trials until they are reported.
The French interferon + ruxo trial ought to report interim results this year. We have actual results from the
Danish trial that inspired it, and they do not, to say the least, inspire pessimism.


There is less public detail on the ruxo + azaC combination, but again, we ought to learn something this
year.


11 Feb 2018, 12:48 PM

Actually, no. "Continuation stage" is used to describe either the cohort expansion stage of a phase 2+ trial
(not EXACTLY defined terms, but I think you can see) or to describe studies which attempt to gain further
information from study of patients who received a treatment in an already-completed study (or sometimes
"in the wild").


A phase 3 trial is one designed to enable regulatory approval (more than one is generally needed in the
US, but they may be quite similar). It is considered futile to initiate a phase 3 without prior agreement to
the design from key regulatory bodies--this is now a bottleneck in new drug development [the prior
approval generally extends to the procedures and the endpoints, but prior specification of target levels for
the endpoints is less common].


Drugs ARE occasionally approved without formal phase 3 trials, but that isn't something to bet your own
money on.

MF for a subgroup. Both Jakafi and interferon stop working after a while. After that there are no options
anymore and patients will slide into advanced stage of the disease. That's why doctors tend to chose for
transplant in an earlier stage of the disease (eg. intermediate 1). And that is why the disease modifying
capability of imetelstat (targeting the malignant clone) is so important and unique.

Continuation stage refers to the continuation of JnJ with the collaboration agreement. Next phases of the
trials will fall into that stage. JnJ will decide about the collaboration after the primary analysis.


In the continuation stage JnJ will start various exploratory indications and a P2/3 AML trial. That's what
slide 18 says.

If you know EXACTLY, and are talking here, somebody is involved in a major ethical violation. The
investigators in NCT02742324 have not yet disclosed results, and they are entitled to control of them.
Since the "primary completion" date has passed and final completion is listed for October, we should know
something [ethically] soon enough.


Ruxo + interferon is mostly a "two hits along the same pathway" approach. Some such combinations have
worked much better than either component alone (I think instantly of trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole)

1Q18 MF median OS review and related upcoming reporting
Fri Feb 09, 2018 7:12 pm


This is an email question to Anna Krassowska, Geron IR and her explanation responses. While I think most are
hoping for some specific details in near term communications, knowing the data has still not matured continues to
be helpful. As basically all of us are hopeful for our friends and family and as investors that Geron, JNJ/Jansen
and the FDA will find in the data review the reasons mandating a positive detailed update and possibly early
approval. However continuing with the thought that more mature data is required, continues to be very positive.
Anyway, so while not providing any additional “new” news I felt this might still be of interest to the ImetelChat board
and those who can provide any additional thoughts or insight around Anna’s responses.
======================...
Initial Email question:


Dear Anna, 
Given that we investors believe the majority of their Geron investment and future is apparently now riding on the
outcome of the OS results in the MF trial being reviewed in 1Q18. Hopefully we will be told the number of months
over the median, the number of patients still alive versus total. Of course any numbers on CR, PR or CI’s would be
greatly appreciated as well.
Can you provide any insight now on what we could expect in the coming weeks regarding press releases,
conference calls, etc. and the information expected to be provided describing CT results to date? Otherwise, our
frustration regarding the data desert continues to the detriment of investors and hopeful family and friends with MF,
MDS, ET, MM, etc. diseases. Thank you for reading and hopefully responding on all points not affecting
competitive advantage. 
Best regards,


Anna’s initial reply:



https://seekingalpha.com/user/20130431

https://seekingalpha.com/author/dividend-latitude

https://seekingalpha.com/user/6316691
Thank you for your email.


The IMbark Q1 data review is not the primary analysis. Investors should not expect results from IMbark to be
presented following the Q1 data review, primarily because the OS data, which are an important component, are
not expected to be sufficiently mature. May I also ask what you mean by the statement “number of months over
median”? I ask because I am sensing a potential misunderstanding that I think might be important.


Best regards,
Anna


Clarification of email question:
Dear Anna,


Thank you for your quick reply, very much appreciated!


I do apologize for my scrambled thoughts. I can try to explain hopefully more clearly by saying, various reports and
blogs and listening to Dr. Scarlett’s presentations indicate that JNJ’s study of median OS indicates approximately 7
months and MD Anderson Cancer Center 14 months. I believe approximately 12 months is Dr. Scarlett’s latest
conservative target of existing median OS for R/R MF patients. So what I was attempting to ask was how many
months past Dr. Scarlett’s median OS target are we currently regarding the IMbark trial. Also, if possible, it would
be extremely reassuring to know how many patients and / or percentage are still alive assuming that information is
available for investors and those suffering from MF following the 1Q18 review?


Now I do appreciate your dilemma with communicating median OS, as there are likely many disease
characteristics involved and considered along with the staggered entry into the CT, etc. At this juncture, knowing
that median OS hasn’t been reached continues to be reassuring for all of us and our families, which is what I
believe you are saying with the terms “not expected to be sufficiently mature”. I am hoping (requesting if possible)
that some details will be provided in the near term communications around the fact that the data is not yet
sufficiently mature. Thanks again for your feedback and contributions.


Best regards,


Anna’s reply:


Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed response to my question. Please do not apologize. I thought
that is what you probably meant, but I just wanted to be sure. I interact with investors from all different
backgrounds!


In general terms, estimating expected survival in a patient population is challenging. And this is especially true in a
population that has never really been studied in a clinical trial setting. We have described survival estimates that
have been published, as you cited in your email. A major caveat is the extent to which the patients enrolled in a
clinical trial actually correspond to or match the patients in a “historical” population. This is why, as you know, to
truly assess the improvement in survival resulting from a drug treatment one conducts a randomized, controlled
trial. IMbark is not such a trial. Of course, one can make estimates based on the available information and use
those estimates to guide decisions about further development.
I understand that investors and patients are interested to see the current survival data from the ongoing trial.
However, such data can be misleading before being sufficiently mature – I like to use the analogy of tasting the
raw cake batter in order to know how the final baked product will turn out.


We have guided investors that they should not expect results to be reported following the Q1 data review. As with
the other data reviews, we expect to update investors if there are any changes to the conduct of the trial, or if there
is an update on timing for the primary analysis, based on the number of deaths. But not the data itself.


This answer may not be satisfying, but I hope that it is informative and helpful.


Your support of Geron, and your personal interest in success of drugs, including imetelstat, for the treatment of
patients with these devastating diseases, is truly appreciated.


Warm regards,
Anna

Own GERN. Bought and sold it several times.


Also own JNJ.....checked their website to see if GERN is even mentioned. Could not find anything. That said,
means little, because JNJ is partnered with dozens of developmental biotechs.


GERN is less than 1% of my portfolio, therefore it's just a bet!!


If Imetelstat is a "no go' JNJ is down $45 million in a $80 billion company. If GERN get's the drug OK'd it will
$20.00 plus a share.


I also owned EXEL at $3.00, which, went to $32.00 (currently $27.00). This is like betting on the Tampa Bay Rays
to win the World Series or the Cleveland Browns to win the Super Bowl........if they do....WIN WIN WIN.


JNJ will quickly "dump" GERN if the prospects are no good. They haven't done that yet, so GERN is either $.25 or
$20.00!! It's certainly not like betting on AMZN at $1200.00 a share or TSLA at $300.00 a share!

Look, most people have never HEARD of Geron or imetelstat. Now, Seeking Alpha has the beginnings of
an awareness campaign. There's a theme here that will make the GERN meme stick in the mind, and it
was all started by MTB.


First, MTB used the Scott Adams persuasion technique. He linked Imetelstat to "Toxicity". Now, Alpha
Exposure has built on that foundation, pairing Imetelstat with "Death".


From now on, whenever people think about Death, they'll think about Imetelstat. This is the beginning of

Various people have posted already observations that this article is twisting existing information and brings
forward pertinent lies (like: Mayo trial stopped enrolling because of toxicity). There has been ZERO
information/evidence about a direct relationship between deaths occurring and imetelstat. If the FDA would
have the impression that such a relationship could exist, they IMMEDIATELY would have stopped the trials
a long time ago and certainly wouldn't give FTD (just look at what they did with the fedratinib trial). So
even the title of the article has nothing to do with the facts and events we know.

My near term (9-12 month) "move" is to watch and wait. I have previously "adjusted" my position to an

The "Alpha Exposed Lying Rat" article used the Adam Feuerstein article to indicate Feuersteins' skepticism with
the successful results of Tefferis' Pilot Study; and then indicated that Feuersteins' conclusions were validated with
2 deaths being reported in the trial. This is a gross fabrication and misrepresentation of the facts as Feuerstein,
although skeptical, could only point to a lack of reported clinical responses, but acknowledged the bone
marrow/blood response. He further(maybe unwittingly prophetic) stated that "maybe doctors will treat
myeleofibrosis patients with a combination of imetelstat and jakafi?"(or maybe venetoclax).


10 Feb 2018, 11:13 AM

I don't see any combo with jakafi. The goal really should not be a spleen size reduction but to prevent the
spleen from blowing up with blood cells in the first place. The spleen size goal is total B.S. and a side
effect of how jakafi works not really a goal in itself. Go the core/cause with proper treatment and the
spleen will better behave itself. That's where IMET performs on the bone marrow and any combo agent
should not be about spleen reduction as a primary goal.

So in summary we have a huge run up of 30-40% a slight sell off the highs and then this hit piece comes out.
Looking back at the past few weeks someone knows something or someone is buying huge numbers bolstered by
our own knowledge that this is the best risk reward stock of all time( of course some of you have hindsight ). Now
we see the buying was not short covering to any big extent(numbers are higher and now 33 million). Just imagine
how fearful the shorts are now because even that hit piece only worked to a minor degree. So even though I do
not write as eloquent as TELO or as knowledgable as many readers and investors of GERN I can conclude the
following. This stock is going much higher and I am buying more Monday before we get to far into this stock
moving past its recent high. Read between the lines and listen to the many experts on this board. We will win
along with patients.

67. Specifically, Alpha Exposure disclosed in a June 21, 2013 Seeking Alpha article
that it submitted a FOIA request letter to the SEC concerning Uni-Pixel, Inc. (“Uni-Pixel”).

https://seekingalpha.com/user/47805367

https://seekingalpha.com/user/4450851
Alpha Exposure’s article hyperlinked to a partially redacted response letter from the SEC, which
redacted its true identity, but did not redact the fact that the SEC received Alpha Exposure’s
request on June 10, 2013 and denied it in full.
68. The SEC, in turn, keeps public FOIA “logs” that record metadata for the FOIA
requests that it receives. FOIA logs are public and available on the SEC’s website.2 The
metadata recorded by FOIA logs reflect information such as the requestor’s name, the subject of
the request (e.g., company name), the date the SEC receives a request, the date it closes a request
and its final disposition.
69. Here, the SEC’s public FOIA records could not be clearer about the identity of
“Alpha Exposure.” The log dated FY 2013 reveals that the SEC received a FOIA request
concerning Uni-Pixel on June 10, 2013, the same date that the SEC received Alpha Exposure’s
request, and that the request was made by someone named “August, Nathaniel” of “Mangrove
Partners.” The log further reveals that August’s request was “[d]enied in full” and closed on
June 21, 2013, which again conforms to the SEC letter that Alpha Exposure hyperlinked in its
June 21, 2013 Seeking Alpha article.
70. Moreover, the same SEC log shows that the only FOIA request concerning UniPixel
in all of FY 2013 was from “August, Nathaniel” of “Mangrove Partners.” This irrefutable
fact, coupled with Alpha Exposure’s June 21, 2013 article, amount to conclusive proof that
August and Mangrove are, in fact, “Alpha Exposure.”
71. “Alpha Exposure” again leaked its identity through a slipshod admission in a
November 19, 2015 post on its blog (http://bit.ly/2BRcB44). In that post, Alpha
Exposure, after publicizing a FOIA letter it had sent the SEC demanding information on Eros,
divulged that its “last” FOIA request to the SEC concerned Uni-Pixel – which, as the SEC’s
FOIA log reveals, was made by none other than August himself

"Mangrove has had a successful record of shorting biotech shares, though it doesn’t always win. August
believed Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) had set its goals too high this past May during Phase 3 testing of a
drug, called Sustol, designed to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Test results, however,
turned out positive—good news for chemo patients, but not so much for Mangrove. It covered at a loss."


Manipulating the market via SA articles = perfectly legal and no one is going after them. Literally no one
cares except the longs on this board. SEC is not funded to investigate half the crap that goes on, and now
they have crypto stuff to investigate? There's not enough investigators to scratch the surface. This is a

Adam Feuersteins'conclusions: The current study signifies the potential value of telomerase-based treatment
strategies in MF and identifies imetelstat as an active drug in that regard. The observed morphologic and
molecular remissions confirm selective anti-clonal activity, which has thus far eluded other drugs in MF, including
JAK inhibitors. The association between response and spliceosome mutations suggests a broader application for
the drug in myeloid malignancies.


There was buzz surrounding imetelstat going into Thursday's abstract release because the drug may have
legitimate disease-modifying potential in bone marrow cancers like myelofibrosis.


Incyte's (INCY - Get Report) Jakafi is approved to treat myelofibrosis but only provides symptomatic relief -- mainly
by reducing the size of a patient's enlarged spleen, a hallmark of the disease.


Imetelstat, on the other hand, appears to be effective in the bone marrow, meaning the drug could to slow or even
stop the malignancies which cause diseases like myelofibrosis.


Here's a simple way to think about imetelstat's potential: Neither Jakafi nor any other similar (JAK inhibitor) drugs
being studied in myelofibrosis today are capable of producing a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR).
At best, these drugs only provide clinical improvement (CI) in myelofibrosis patients.


But here's the hiccup on the imetelstat data revealed this morning, which I alluded to above: No clinical or
symptomatic responses were reported, only bone marrow and blood response. The International Working Group
(IWG) response criteria for myelofibrosis says a CR and a PR need to have bone marrow/blood response and
clinical response, which usually means reduction in the size of the spleen.



https://seekingalpha.com/user/42051456

https://seekingalpha.com/user/12780131

https://seekingalpha.com/user/12487711
Maybe doctors will treat myelofibrosis patients with a combination of imetelstat and Jakafi? Perhaps, but
thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) is a significant overlapping toxicity of both drugs. That might cause some
problems.


Let the debate over Geron's myelofibrosis drug imetelstat rage on! We'll see updated results next month at the
American Society of Hematology (AS) annual meeting.


After rereading this article I have to conclude Adam had it right except for his hiccup statement putting too much
importance on spleen reduction.
Let there be no doubt that Imetelstat is J&Js' next billion dollar blockbuster!!


Let there be no doubt that Imetelstat is J&Js next billion

JS indicated on several occasions that they were seeing CI's so that is not completely accurate. Spleen
reductions were also seen but just not to the degree as with jakafi only performing frontline testing under
less stringent IWG criteria. jakafi obviously cannot even do anything with the R/R backline patients that
Imetelstat is testing. By definition, jakafi never worked or stopped working for these R/R more severe
patients yet Imetelstat is getting CIs and some spleen reductions. So think of jakafi in backline as being
zero effective and Imetelsat goes beyond jakafi obtaining CI's and some spleen reductions and OS.

I expect MTB is busy. All you have to do really is rewrite this article in reverse to get the truth.


The FDA has essentially accepted to date IMETELSTAT as a very safe drug and that's one of the great reasons
BOTH TRIALS Continue not to mention unprecedented benefits.
Renowned MDS Expert, Dr. RAZA, even declared Geron's drug SAFER than EXISTING Drug Therapies.

Wiz, why go off the deep end? The FDA has accepted the risk/benefit of imetelstat is all fine. To call it a
"very safe drug" is just completely outlandish. No body involved with the trials or Geron has ever described
imetelstat as "very safe."

Tefferi said he didn't see any grade 3/4 on-hematologic toxicity at all (Youtube: Tefferi+imetelstat). He then
says that the drug deserves respect regarding myelosuppression. There was grad 3/4 for
neutropenia's/thromcyt... observed (which is dangerous because of bleeding/infection risk), but was fully
manageable with dosing amount and schedule.


Dr. Raza said that imetelstat was actually demonstrating less side effects than SoC: lenalidome and
HMA's.


Who do we believe? These two top doctors (who actually are working with the drug and who have seen
the bone marrow and molecular impact of imetelstat), or this charlatan who is short and doesn't respond to
any of the comments and who wants Geron to go bankrupt and keep this medicine away from dying
patients? I'd rather die than earning my money that way. I am sure there will be lawyers looking at this and

The only truth here is the ImBark trial update hasn't been presented.


IMerge is in Part 2 and Part 1 showed non-del(5q) mutation patients that represent 85% of all MDS patients have
received a 54% response to transfusion independence verses about 27% for Revlimid patients.


AML is the next step, very likely using Venetoclax and Imetelstat in combination as, in vivo, it has shown an 88%
ability to stay in remission, Imetelstat showing an even greater response than Venetoclax, an FDA approved drug
by Abbvie.


This article is nothing but an attempt at short-term profit by a short seller. Nothing more, nothing less!


Today is another great day because we haven't reached median survival in the ImBark trial. As far we know, and
as long as we haven't heard, this trial will continue. The update will happen by the end of March and that is the

I am buying on this one thank you for the opportunity to buy more. 
You have missed the boat on a ton of what you wrote about:
1. ET was never to be a path to approval it was a proof of concept or hypothesis. It proved that Imetelstat causes a
molecular response. An ET phase 3 trial would take 27 years and no one would take that path. Tefferi himself said
no company would ever run a full ET trial because of the cost and length of time. 
2. The FDA hold came after a patient who had a 40 year chronic hepatitis history died of liver failure and even an
Dr. involved in the trial had said it was impossible to determine if the patient died because of Imetelstat or his
hepatitis. The FDA took the conservative route and Geron did the studies required to lift the hold. 
3. The supplemental data given to the FDA from the October 10 Q has likely already been reviewed and no news
is seen as good news as evidenced by the recent rise and the continued outlook by JNJ for Imetelstat progression.
4. NSCL cancer trial had a median OS increase of 8 months but the PFS was not significant enough for
continuation except in a subset population with short telomeres. Geron chose their best target for approval based
on the data from the ET trial even though if you read the final results of the NSCL trial. You would have read that
the results showed continued investigation of Imetelstat in that indication is warranted. 
5. the imetelstat & paclitaxel combination did not work because both drugs had the same dose limiting effect of
thrombocytopenia. Because of them both causing thrombocytopenia the trial was using a lower dose of paclitaxel
than normal and the lowering of this dose caused that the PFS to lower in the trial. It was poor design that caused
the failure. They are finding out that Imetelstat combos with PARP3AB inhibitors and inhibitors of CDKN1A.

J&J didn’t pay $35M and offer nearly $1B on a whim...the diseases the drug is being tested against have zero
other options...it’s a straight line killer within 5 years. Do the study results show the stages of the patients that had
trouble? No. Like nearly all meds, starting treatment in early stages of diseases is key. The 30% that achieved
remission may be early in the disease. And, I think most patients and the FDA will take a 30% chance of survival
(or more once stages of beginning treatment are scrubbed from the data) versus certain death. The side effects
are also manageable. What it looks like is the Gleevec blockbuster developed by Novartis. Similar approach of
targeting a specific enzyme (specific protein for Gleevec) to get to a root cause solution.

'In addition, we want to point out that the Pilot Study's enrollment was discontinued early, which suggests to us that
the trial wasn't promising in later results and/or that the Mayo Clinic may have found the safety profile of imetelstat
unacceptable.'


EVERY trial will discontinue at a certain point, no matter how successful a drug is. Do you think a single healthcare
center can enroll an endless number of patients?


You ignore the most important fact: that the trial is still going on, which suggests that patients are still benefiting
and that the safety profile is acceptable and manageable. If you would taken the effort of looking at the CT site you
would have known that.


Have you spoken with the Mayo Clinic? Can you provide any evidence of your assumption? Dr. Tefferi has a very
different opinion from what you say:
'We have not seen any grad 3 or 4 toxicity at all. We were very happy with that' 
http://bit.ly/PUocn6


Your reasoning is against all logic and against the facts. If the Mayo data would have proven that imet has an
unacceptable safety profile (as you suggest), why then:
1) is the FDA allowing the trials to go on while keeping patients exposed to this drug
2) why would JnJ have entered into the license agreement in the first place
3) why would the FDA have granted FTD
4) why would Dr. Raza say that imetelstat side effects are manageable and even less severe then in well known
and approved drugs like lenalidome and HMA's?


The criticism in your article is so heavily constructed and factually wrong, that I can't take it seriously. It is
unbelievable that SA allows this kind of dubious articles on its site.

It's 2018 and we're still discussing GERN, how amazing is that? This is just one of many signs that we've been in a
multi-year biotech bubble. GERN could open at $0 tomorrow and it would have literally zero impact in the world.
Actually, it would be a positive to the extent they are no longer destroying capital that could be used for something
productive.


Come back and check these comments after the bubble ends, it will be hilarious.


"I see this article as a positive sign for the stock. When shorts start to put pressure like this so they can cover it's
the last piece of the puzzle."

Even without the article today, I think Geron would have sunk almost as much with the volatility of the

out.


It's not the article (which is likely coincidental). The selloff was due to a "false breakout". Basically a failed
breakout, so no reason to go counter trend with the market...which means more trouble very soon. The
indexes are not done deflating.

Ever? The cerebral hemorrhage death in the Mayo series was secondary to aplastic anemia. The situation
followed an extra dose of imetelstat, and was considered clearly related at the time. (The patient was said
to be in terminal decline due to MF when the extra dose was decided upon, but still...)

'but still...'
But still what? A patient that is in terminal decline will be heavily anemic already. Cerebral hemorrage is
being caused by thrombocytopenia, a totally well known side effect. They probably tried imetelstat as a
last instance. So they took a risk. What risk do patients take when treated with stem cell transplant, the
only curative yet highly risky option? For very advanced patients this is not even an option anymore.
Today, after having worked with the drug for a couple of years, all relevant parties say that anemia and
thrombocytopenia (i.e. caused by myelosuppression) can be managed. I am sure you are aware of that.


11 Feb 2018, 04:56 AM

i'm trying to be soft-spoken. A patient (admittedly one who was already mortally ill) WAS killed by
imetelstat toxicity. Once qualifies as "ever"


11 Feb 2018, 12:32 PM


fishermangents
So that is one incident, if you are right. I haven't seen the actual source of that claim, so please show me.
But does that justify the title that imetelstat is haunted by deaths during its entire history? Come on!


How many patients die from stem cell transplant, the ONLY curative option for MF patients? I can tell you:
within the 1st year it is between 15-20% treatment related mortality. After three years it is about 50%
treatment related mortality. If AML comes in it is only 10%. So we maybe have officially 1 death reported.
Can you then honestly speak about a 'history of deaths', like these charlatans of this article are doing and
which you obviously are supporting?

Seriously, if someone is so advanced and mortally ill with no hope, how would a shot of jakafi fare ? These

drugs fault ?

We could get into "interesting" medico-legal territory, but all I'm pushing here is that at least one patient
DID die from adverse effects of imetelstat. I recall an affecting account of the circumstances by Tefferi, but

Not that it can't happen with predisposed and treated very ill patients, but there's a point that any drug
given would not be tolerated and I seem to recall a patient death wherein it was declared that it had
nothing to do with IMET itself but other extenuating circumstances.


12 Feb 2018, 03:38 PM


fishermangents
NOTHING, but only official reports or statements from JnJ, Geron or maybe the FDA regarding the
occurrence of deaths can substantiate the claim of these authors, that imetelstat has a 'history of deaths'.
The problem for the author is: THERE ARE NO SUCH REPORTS! Their claim, which suggests a range of
death incidents over a long period of time, can't be supported by a single incident.


It is far more likely that the authors have fabricated this article, with the purpose to bring damage to the
reputation of Geron and imetelstat, and thus bringing down the PPS. Their motivation is to cover their
short position against the lowest price.


They are not responding to any of the comments, which tells a lot. They are just interested in the effect of
the article, not in contributing to a balanced opinion. Hit and run, hoping nobody catches you.

This is part of the conclusions of that trial:


Title of the study:
A molecular biology and phase II study of imetelstat (GRN163L) in children with recurrent or refractory
central nervous system malignancies: a pediatric brain tumor consortium study.


'Two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study
closure. No objective responses were observed. Telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for at least 8 days.'

Thrombocytopenia is a known and manageable side effect. Lack of platelets obviously lead to bleeding in
the tumor. Geron abandoned all the pediatric indications and tests, to which the EMA waved the obligation
for Geron to test on children in the approval process. This test is not representative for adults and
hematologic malignancies, to which Geron is now exclusively focusing.

There are no reported deaths in IMbark and IMerge, or in any of the other adult trials. The pediatric one is
a case on its own. And as we know, that path is abandoned. That's probably why I din't count that in when
I made that statement. But if you do - and that is fine - then it still doesn't justify the generalized statement
'a history of deaths'. In addition, it puts things far out of the perspective of the current trials, where they
continuously say that myelosuppression is manageable.

market's eyes, there would be no buyers at these levels or any other level and the stock would never open
for trade with no buyers. Truth has a way of keeping buyers in and Fidelity still has a large position of
almost 24 million shares, as do other large institutions who own millions. But I guess they are just
gamblers as well, according to the ever so truthful short philosophy and narrative .


Of course the good Dr Raza remarks can only be reiterated since she is one so close to actual knowledge.

I continue to buy more gern shares as every drop is an opportunity to multiply the gains I'll see over the
next couple years. IMHO

'Once the drug gets approved, then everybody will be using this upfront. It is not like we happily use
lenalidomide or HMA's in that group'.

I'd trust her too, but she can't approve anything in a timely manner. She has nothing to do with the
valuation of Geron unfortunately.

Bridge to sell
I see this article as a positive sign for the stock. When shorts start to put pressure like this so they can cover it's
the last piece of the puzzle. None of that is to say that factually he's wrong, he has just chosen to cherry pick the
negative and apply a negative bias to the unknown. If longs are ok doing that for their side of the thesis they don't
really have the right to complain when someone frames the known facts in the opposite light.


09 Feb 2018, 11:23 AM


User 7649441
Confirmation_Biased,


Unfortunately you are wrong here. Whomever shorted high a few days ago might be covering today and
taking profits, however there is no positive with short covering. Without real positive news/data from the
company the stock can not be supported by short buying.


Not all shorts are covering and there is obviously selling to protect capital. I got out of a what was
supposed to be a profitable long term position. the risk to reward for that capital is not so great.

I like that, Bias. They have to come out of their creepy little holes to put their fat AASS on this stock. They
want to get out. I certainly see some desperation here.

User 7649441
you think they were 'so desperate' to get out? I think not. Lets see what happens to the price next week.
Not all stocks drop in a bear market, and many even move up.

Only believe yourself.
A shorter, and certainly someone who is as negative as hell, thinks in minutes and hours, hoping to make
"instant profits".
A convinced long knows it'll take at least a decade to bring a medecine to the market.
So influencable.


Take a look at the pro's and contr's, the foer and against, make up your mind, and only believe in your own
vision.
Good luck.

I wondered why GERN was down 4% right away this morning... Then I saw this article, and I stopped wondering.


09 Feb 2018, 10:41 AM


User 7649441
yeah, why was Geron up 20% recently. I don't think the short position has changed much now given this
new event, but i could be wrong. The past few days tells us one thing.


This market has some way to fall, and Geron will fall hard with the market, unless management and BoD
come up with data. Geron otherwise has 'no value' and can swing -$1 very easily in this turbulent market.

All your articles are short, so you are probably expert at it.
What I don't understand is shorting a stock that already seems depressed -- other than the latest small jump.
I would be interested why this strategy makes sense.
Thank you
Rodney


09 Feb 2018, 10:27 AM


User 7649441
Rodney the strategy apparently works. They know Geron extremely well and may have played it on the
long side as well. Geron has been nothing but a pump and dump, repeat, dump and pump.


09 Feb 2018, 10:34 AM


User 7649441
They're only looking for 50-75 cent swings in the up and down direction and then short high and cover low.
They're never waiting for "zero". No one wins with Geron but the traders Rodney.


09 Feb 2018, 10:42 AM


User 7649441
for all we know, the "positive articles" could be counter points to the "negative" articles, all responsible in
collaboration


09 Feb 2018, 10:44 AM


craigprat
Exactly. The last two glowing articles, in all probability, exaggerated on the long end and led to a short
term pop in the stock. Then this hit piece, which offers nothing new, comes out and, bam...the stock drops
to its previous level. Its all a game, and when companies are silent for this amount of time, manipulation
between real news is a given.

09 Feb 2018, 03:16 PM


fishermangents
No, they didn't. This article is the ultimate evidence of that. They need at least sub 1.50 (or lower) to get
out. The sudden raise of pps last week came unsuspected and now this desperate charlatan needs to
publish lies and manipulated information to get pps down, before real good news may come out. So we
can actually see this article as an indicator for upcoming positive news.


09 Feb 2018, 07:37 PM


Sage_Fan
The river card will be dealt to all of us, long or short, at the same time very soon. The funny thing is we
(JNJ) know the card, as this is a phase 2/an open trial, shorts don’t, so I will make this kind of bet at any
single day.


I don’t even want to debunk or even finish reading the article, did JNJ just update their top list on 1/23,
2018? Has imetelstat passed the expected median OS already?


Have a nice weekend.

The way I see it is GERN is not in a very good position to pass efficacy or safety benchmarks and
represents a VERY,VERY RISKY bet in an already risky investment group.I don't own and DON'T plan to
do so EVER!

So the FDA has "concerns" yet gave Imetelstat FTD?


10 Feb 2018, 12:37 PM


fishermangents
crich: which concerns? Were has that word been used by the FDA? They just want more information.
NOTHING says that this request comes from certain 'concerns'.


FDA has the responsibility to approved drugs to be used by the public. So asking for more information
about efficacy and safety of imetelstat is a STANDARD PROCEDURE in the approval process.


10 Feb 2018, 05:58 PM


fishermangents
The FDA is concerned about EVERY drug which in the approval process. Nothing special for imetelstat.

MedTechBio, Contributor
Don't be fooled, buy with two fists Monday morning. There is so much genius in this article, especially
about the Mayo trial with world renowned blood cancer researcher and professor Dr. Tefferi. Article
suggests the pilot study wasn't promising, meanwhile, it led the world's largest pharma company to invest
$1B plus. That pilot study still has patients taking Imetelstat today, 4 years after they should have been
dead. I trust JNJ. Don't even get me started on the other points. Article is using 10K boilerplate info in a
misleading way. Funny thing, this is the first time I've seen section headers higlighted in BOLD RED. Then
of course FDA issuing Fast Track designation just a few months ago. Here's the best news about this
article, the risk is so enormous on the short side they had to resort to this.

"I trust JNJ."


I absolutely agree. JNJ has deep knowledge of oncology, hematology, pharmacology, the pharmaceutical
business, Imetelstat, clinical trials, and FDA regulations.


As long as they are partnered with Geron, the risk/reward seems positive.
