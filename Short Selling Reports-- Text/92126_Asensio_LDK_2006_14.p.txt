LDK Spurns GT Solar, Causes


Litigation, Then Buys From


GT Solar. Yet Another of


LDK’s Inconsistent Press


Releases.


Today LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK $45.67) announced


signing an agreement with GT Solar International, Inc.


(NASDAQ: SOLR $10.76) to purchase polysilicon CVD reactors


for $32 million. LDK will use the GT Solar equipment in its


China-based polysilicon plant.


Like many of LDK’s recent announcements, this one seems


strange and inconsistent. GT Solar’s stock fell two days after


its IPO on July 23rd following an announcement from LDK.


On July 25th LDK, one of GT Solar’s biggest customers,


announced that it signed a contract to purchase the same


type of equipment made by GT Solar from one of GT Solar’s


competitors. After the July 25th announcement GT Solar’s


stock declined to $9.30, 43% below the IPO price of $16.50.


The decline in GT Solar’s stock prompted announcements of


class action lawsuits against GT Solar, alleging that


management made misleading statements on the nature of


its relationship with LDK.

Today’s announcement from LDK comes a day after


PiperJa�ray issued a buy recommendation on GT Solar,


stating that GT Solar will receive “additional orders from


LDK.” Given the timing of LDK’s announcements related to


GT Solar, the evident question is whether LDK may be


manipulating GT Solar’s stock.
