Qihoo 360 Fakes A Microsoft Security Patch
Aug. 14, 2012 10:46 PM ET20 comments
by: Matt Berry


Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd (NYSE:QIHU) has been in the news. Let's just dive right
into the latest Qihoo scandal in China. News title:


"Qihoo 360 falsely reports loopholes in the Windows system to force the
installation of their 360 browser."


(The above was professionally translated and will be cited throughout this article as
"Qihoo 360 Falsely Reports." Originals are here; you can read them in the Google
translator, for example here. 8/1/2012)"


Here's what happened:


"There have been users who have posted screenshots online which show the 360
Security Defender wrongly detecting holes in the Windows system and thereby
recommending users to install an upgrade patch."


"After the upgrading is completed, only then do they realise the 'patch' is the 360
browser. It is understood that the user patch from the 360 Security Defender,
allegedly supposed to fix loopholes in the Windows system, immediately transforms
itself into the 360 browser upon installation of the patch." (Qihoo 360 Falsely
Reports)


Now, here's a screenshot that accompanied one of the many articles (I added the Google
translator and the orange lines to highlight the key points. By the way, of the screenshots I
found, this was the one with the best resolution: you can find it here, click the image to
enlarge it.)

I've experienced the proof firsthand. Upon reading online blogs and articles, I found URLs
to the patch(es) and was able to download them from Qihoo's official site. As of this writing
I am still able to download them. I introduce them here, with the warning that the company
has been accused of malware in the past. Here are the links.

http://dlleak.360safe.com/leak/ty/Windows-KB360018-v7-x86.exe


It is possible that the files will be removed and/or the access blocked upon the publication
of this article. Again, I'm not recommending the files. I only present them as evidence of
the counterfeiting.


Take a quick look. Which files are from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and which are
from Qihoo 360 ?

All of them were downloaded from Qihoo's 360safe.com, AKA, 360.cn ‒ and all of them
were made by Qihoo 360.


(To see this System Explorer page click here.)


In the image below, you can see that the icon on the left is a short-cut to Qihoo's browser;
the icon in the middle is a short-cut to Microsoft's browser; and the last icon is Qihoo's
counterfeit Microsoft "security patch." Note how there is much more similarity to
Microsoft's icon than to Qihoo's.


Besides using Microsoft's Icon and color, Qihoo's fake patch also takes advantage of file
naming convention.


"According to evidence from the users, the 360 browser upon downloading as a
patch changes its name to 'Windows-KB360018-v7-x86.exe,' which is markedly
similar to actual Microsoft patches in name. "(Qihoo 360 Falsely Reports)


Here's what they mean. Of the two filenames below the first is Qihoo's and the second is
Microsoft's (found here):

"Windows" of course refers to Microsoft's most famous product and "KB" stands for
"Knowledge Base." A user is supposed to be able to go to Microsoft's Knowledge Base,
access the reference number, and get more information.


I invite the reader to try to find Windows KB360018. Now, if there is no KB360018 entry in
Microsoft's knowledge base, then Qihoo 360 has no other reason for referencing
"Windows" in the filename other than to further a user's natural expectation that the
software comes from the trusted source, Microsoft.


Let's go back to the Qihoo Security Guards screenshot. You may have noticed that there
were other hotfixes listed. One had a KB reference number, 2728973. You can actually go
to Microsoft's website and look that KB reference number up.


I did just that. Now, either somebody on Qihoo's team has a great sense of humor or
Qihoo's listed hotfixes have an ironic coincidence. The KB2728973 reference for the patch
next to the fake one reads: "Microsoft Security Advisory: Unauthorized digital certificates
could allow spoofing." A Microsoft warning about "spoofing" next to a fake Microsoft hotfix!


See illustration, or click here to go to Microsoft's Knowledge Base #2728973.


OK then, with common sense certainty we know that Qihoo faked a Microsoft patch. And
understandably, some users were confused. Here's a comment found on the official Qihoo
360 BBS, run through the translator.

Qihoo's tactics were exposed and spread through the blogosphere.


"Recently, Qihoo 360 has once again been exposed for malicious and deceptive
fraud against users, and this has sparked widespread backlash in the blogging
scene." (Qihoo 360 Falsely Reports)


This next piece was found on Weibo's ultra-popular micro-blogging site (run through
Google's translator):


These sorts of blogs are abundant, see some of them here. As you can see in the above
Weibo "micro-blog," and in others, screen shots were popular. See a very popular series
of screenshots, here. Many were also widely distributed in the press.


Someone even made a video of the "hotfix" installation process: here.

I wonder how many novice users thought they not only installed a Microsoft patch but
actually thought they also had a new upgraded Microsoft browser?!


(Internet Explorer and Qihoo Browser Icons.)


What does Microsoft think about all this? News reports in China said that Microsoft was
investigating the matter, but did not have any comments at this time. (Originals, here;
Google Translator, here) Here's a community response on answers.microsoft.com. The
original was in Chinese, I had it professionally translated.


"As you may have already heard from the news, the recently released update for the
"360 Browser" has fraudulently been released in Microsoft's name by 360, and is not
actually a patch from Microsoft. This matter is currently under investigation."
(Original is here.)


Or perhaps there is a special arrangement between Qihoo and Microsoft for the transition
from IE6?


There is an interview online where someone named Huan Ren, said to be a Qihoo 360
employee, was quoted as saying:


"… in particular Qihoo 360 has a partnership with Microsoft that upgrades the default
browser on Windows XP from IE6 to IE8." (Already translated, here)


But if so, why wouldn't the file properties and digital signature involve Microsoft's name
alongside Qihoo's? And why would the icon look like a cheap screenshot?

The point we need to make here is that if a Hacker wanted to borrow the credibility of
Microsoft to get his users to convert from the IE6 to his own browser, why not 1) copy the
Microsoft icon and the 2) filename conventions (complete with Knowledge Base reference)
and then take another important step: 3) scare the users. Tell them that they're in a high
risk situation.


Here's an excerpt from an article published on Zdnet.com.cn. This one is translated by
Google:


"360 security guards to remind the user's computer a 'high-risk vulnerabilities need
to install a named KB360018' IE6 kernel upgrade patch 'Special Note' Do not stop to
repair. Users follow the prompts to upgrade, it will force the installation of the 360's
security browser. " (Original, here; Google Translated, here.)


A novice user wouldn't know the difference either way and a knowledgeable user would
expect a Microsoft "patch" to contrast with Qihoo's look and feel ‒ which this one did. (Of
course, reports tell us that this wasn't a patch at all but a conversion from Microsoft's to
Qihoo's browser).


This next micro-blog appeared just before the scandal entered the mainstream media:

"Hooligan?" I think US investors are the last to learn. This kind of association with Qihoo is
nothing new to the Chinese reader.


"Previously, incidents where users were forced to install software which
subsequently modified the registry such that it cannot be deleted were fairly
common. A classic example would be Qihoo 360's predecessor, 3721, for which Mr
Zhou Hong Yi has thereby been called the 'Father of rogue software'. (Qihoo 360
Falsely Reports)


In fact if you just do a raw search for "The father of rogue software" (That is, don't even
mention Qihoo or the CEO) you come up with … the CEO of Qihoo. Search here. ("The
father of rogue software" = "流氓软件之父". Check the translation here.)


But faking a patch is nothing new to US readers either.


(here)


As Microsoft warns us,


"Rogue security software might also attempt to spoof the Microsoft security update
process." (here)


Here's an article with another KB-fake:


"Have you received an email seemingly from Microsoft's security team telling you to
"Update your Windows"? Have you been sent a file called KB453396-ENU.zip and
told to run it on your Windows computer?" ~ Fake Microsoft security update spreads

"Previously installed browsers are rendered inactive instantly and the default
browser is locked as the 360 browser, with the homepage fixed as hao.360.cn."
(Qihoo 360 Falsely Reports)


Of course, this was a little over the top. But in general this is the way it is… not just in
China but in the browser business at large: bigger players trying to limit their smaller rivals
with "innovation" and "security." As a consequence, I don't think Qihoo's number one
revenue driver ‒ the advertisement laden default page to the browser‒ will survive the
next technology cycle.


It's the law of the jungle over there. Over here too. Here's Apple locking out major
browsers with impunity, because, well, everybody likes 'em … that, and, oh yeah, they're
really big.


Now that Micrsoft, with its Office Suite, is set to enter this arena with its new tablets, the
future of third-party browsers is being debated. Will Microsoft create so much friction for
rival browsers that users just follow the path of least resistance … resulting in Microsoft's
inevitable retrieval of browser market share? If they can copy Apple's strategy, you can bet
they will. And I do believe that Qihoo will not be spared.


Here's what everyone is saying about the next browser war:


Why Is Microsoft Trying to Hobble Firefox on Windows 8 Tablets - and Why Does It
Matter?


"Microsoft is getting cut a lot of slack for its anticompetitive stance, because it is
casting the anti-features for developers in the name of "protecting users from
malware." It's OK if Microsoft cuts off competing applications at the knees, because
it's trying to prevent malware."


Whether one agrees with Microsoft here or not, one has to admit that Qihoo did not help
the counter-argument with recent "events."

BTW - why would a company risk doing something like this just before their earnings date . . . could someone be
setting them up to fail ? Allegations were made against FMCN to try and drive the price down and someone is trying
to by them out becuase the allegations were proven false. I think the same bodes for this attempt!!!!

>>“BTW - why would a company risk doing something like this just before their earnings date…”


This article does not touch upon when they started doing this or how long they’ve been doing it ‒ I only deal
with their being caught at it ‒THIS TIME. From my perspective, being caught "just before THIS earnings date"
is a coincidence. They could just as easily have been caught "just before" another "earnings date."


15 minutes of DD will show you what I’m talking about. 
There was much more to this article than time and space would permit.


>>”Allegations were made against FMCN to try and drive the price down …”


One person’s bad math is not another person’s allegation.


1. In SEC documents, FMCN claimed a business relationship with 27,000 urban theaters


2. China Government statistics show that there were less than 1,600 such theaters in all of China.


Presenting that evidence in a way that others can verify for themselves is not an “allegation.” It's no longer a
he-said she-said debate. It's an individual event. The conclusion follows naturally (unless you don’t know how
to do the math): http://scr.bi/Po1lNL


>>” and someone is trying to by them out because the allegations were proven false.


With common sense certainty, FMCN submitted fraudulent documents to the SEC.

Seriously, Matt Berry, you have zero credibility in my book. You have been railing against FMCN all year and the stock
ends up being the largest LBO in Chinese history (i.e., stock was a STEAL at $18-19/share). To me, everything you
say is suspect.

Author’s reply »  TechGuy: 
The points in my FMCN articles afford deductive conclusions. That’s why I chose to write about FMCN.
Additionally, the facts presented have withstood scrutiny.


Claiming a network of 27,000 theaters in a China that has less than 1,600 such theaters = a lie. Muddy
Waters first broke this story and I have a slide show presentation to demonstrate it: http://scr.bi/Po1lNL


Cardboard posters are not Liquid Crystal Display devices: http://bit.ly/zno5ra


These are deductive … common sense certainties. Only the SEC would think that it needed a subpoena
before it could proceed.


What investment bankers can do, what investors will believe, what FMCN needs to do to survive, what guanxi
relationships exist, what the SEC is thinking, … these are all separate cases.


FMCN submitted fraudulent documents to the SEC. We can know this with common sense certainty … no
subpoena required.

An uncommitted, unclosed deal is not an LBO.

In fairness to the author, FMCN did NOT disprove ALL the allegations against it just as HRBN did NOT. Sure, they
both end up getting bought out, but neither company disproved ALL the allegations against them. QIHU is overpriced
and risks being halted at any moment.

Really nice work putting this article together. You present your thesis very well and straight-forward.


I don't doubt that where there is smoke there is fire. The issue with QIHU and with Sino-Forest, Harbin Electric,
Longtop, FMCN, and even Madoff is that there needs to be an event to bring these things to light.


CITIC is now very aggressively trying to sweep up these bogus firms. It is put in place by the Chinese gov't to
specifically deal with stuff like this. Credibility is an issue, so like with FMCN or HRBN they aren't going to let things go
pear-shaped as they did with LFT.


I have no doubt that QIHU is doing some very deceptive things to pump up numbers. But then here I am looking at
the holders roster and staring at the fact that Chase Coleman who has boardroom relationships in China has doubled
down his investment (in terms of shares). I think he's dead wrong on this one, but he has that boardroom relationship
and I don't.


Essentially it all comes down to (1) timing and (2) not believing that any of these Chinese deceptions/frauds are going
to zero (because CITIC will be there waiting in the wings).


Anyway, nice work putting this together.

Being bought out does not mean they are not fraud. 
FMCN is a fraud and I doubt the deal would go through. 
Insiders sold tons of shares and calls.

You don't think the deal goes through? Why? So now major US banks and private equity funds are puppets of
FMCN CEO Jason Jiang to enrich himself?


Why would a sophisticated investor with inside knowledge ever knowingly buy a fraud? Jason Jiang is the
CEO, he knows better than anyone if FMCN is a fraud--why would he seek to roll over his stake into an illiquid
private company--once the company is private he can't sell shares to public investors whenever he feels like.
Even at the $15/share, Jason Jiang would realize a lot of wealth selling his stake in FMCN. Taking the
company private is the exact opposite of what is logical if FMCN is a fraud.


Given Citic's association with the Chinese government, I guess it is plausible that they are sweeping up
"bogus" firms, but why would a pedigreed US investor like Carlyle participate in the biggest LBO in Chinese
history? Do you think that they are so rich that they are the point that they want to throw away investors'
money? Or do you think they are controlled by someone out of the Manchurian candidate movie, where they
are secretly Chinese patriots?

If a company gets bought out at a premium to its current stock price with mgmt participation, it strongly
suggests the company is not a fraud. Private investors can also be fooled of course or make bad investment
decisions (i.e., Washington Mutual, etc...), but fraud seems exceptionally unlikely--particularly if mgmt is
participating.


Matt Berry, Muddy Waters and all the shorts got FMCN wrong. Period.

You confuse what-people-do with how-the-assets-add-up.


Harvesting investor credulity is something that can be done. But it’s not the same exercise as adding up the
assets. FMCN inflated their theater and LCD counts. (see below.)


>>Matt Berry, Muddy Waters and all the shorts got FMCN wrong. Period.


You can SAY that 2 + 2 = 5, but you can’t DEMONSTRATE that.


You can say that there are 27,000 theaters in a country that has less than 1,600 but you can demonstrate
that. http://scr.bi/Po1lNL


You can say that Liquid Crystal Devices can later be found to be cardboard posters without your having
inflated your assets, but you cannot demonstrate that. http://bit.ly/zno5ra


Declaring someone wrong is easy, sir. Demonstrating it is a little more difficult. Present your case.

Space is getting good stock price reactions to earnings, like BIDU & SOHU who recently reported and SINA this
morning. -Qihoo reports next week, right?


Also hearing QIHU may be going back to their founders roots with search and launching browser, great compliment to
security and likely to help accelerate monetization.

Whether or not the cmopany is a fraud and whether a buy out deal go through are 2 different things. Numerous frauds
have still been bought out. Harbin was a fraud and that buyout went through. Chinese banks funding this frauds have
a long and checkered history of corruption.

RE: Browser Profitability 
Actually Opera Software and Mozilla's Firefox are profitable...but I understand what you are getting at with regards to
QIHU.


I personally believe that you are on to something here and that you are doing some very good work on it. Much more
so that many of the analysts who are covering the name. Keep it up.


I have no doubt that QIHU is involved with reciprocal Link Exchanges and is pumping up its revenues in that manner.
It's banal... and not unique. It's the same ol' thing that happened 10-15 years ago in the U.S. And sooner-or-later all of
those companies got found out once the smoke and mirrors that they pulled to cover their "Link Exchange" tracks
went nowhere. The current example of this is QIHU's phone :) And like those U.S. companies, QIHU will get found out
sooner or later, too. And just like back then "Smart Money" (e.g. the Tiger Cubs, NBIM) will get bruised along the way.


Just keep in mind that it's a game of chicken. You have to be fairly certain that these smart investors are acutely
aware of QIHU's (and FMCN/HRBN/LFT's) practices. They are just betting that the not as bright mutual funds won't
figure it out (or even care about it) for a few more quarters/years. Or they are betting that CITIC will provide a quick
backstop. It's an arrogant approach, but it can be successful. It's also an unnecessarily risky approach, too...


It's hard to figure out what investors are looking at right now in the space. LNKD shows no earnings upside despite all
of that valuation and the stock rockets. FB does the same and the stock plummets. NTES misses and the stock tanks.
And then SINA gets on the horn and says the EXACT same things as NTES and the stock rockets. Go figure...


Actually the SINA results & call were interesting. I am pretty sure that Shorts couldn't have asked for much more
during the call. Degrading margins. Slowing revenue. Confirmation of a softening ad market. Light guidance. And
management even saying (and I quote) "The advertising market in China continued to be challenging due to the soft
macroeconomic conditions in China." All that and the stock rips the next day because they said they are going to
move from "around 80" weibo advertisers to "hopefully double that", despite having a Bajillion users. What a joke. You
can only laugh... (unless you were massively short)


QIHU is all going to come down to timing... (as should your research notes...). Again, solid work. It's much more
fundamentally detailed than any of the wall street analysis that is out there. KIU.

Lot’s of directions to go. If I had a research team I would have someone looking at user-agent strings and
“browser spoofing” (sometimes performed by antivirus software) … I’d also have someone looking at the
possibility of pre-rendering. But time and money are limited. High probability the search would turn out
negative, as it goes with most hunches, but QIHU has cheated in so many ways in other areas that I'd give it
a shot -- (IE, if I had a team with the expertise).


I had to trim the article down. Here’s something I decided to leave out. In the past, Qihoo has also used
KB999999 in filenames (including the file eventually called KB360018). KB999999 is often used as a
“hypothetical” knowledge base reference, used for giving examples and instructions to others. So if one
wanted to use a knowledge base reference which was actually listed on Microsoft, one could use KB999999
and a non-English speaker could do a quick search on Microsoft and be somewhat satisfied that it was listed
on the official site.


KB999999 On Microsoft “for example”: http://bit.ly/TKTjhk


KB999999 as used by Qihoo: http://tinyurl.com/cb4...


Some QIHU 360 filenames appear so much like Microsoft's that SystemExplorer actually provides a hyperlink
to Microsoft's 365! (Click to Sys. Expl. then mouseover the hyperlink.)

QIHU still ripping higher, now just a few days before earnings. Have heard new qihoo search (8/15) is being well
received and can possibly add to growth prospects for the future, probably a focus item on the conference call along
with mobile, handsets and games. All compliments to the core browser/security business.


It is evident that you are all likely smarter, more sophisticated and with more time for research than me, but focusing
on what I can see .... simple trend of group posting good results beating on both top and bottom line, guiding higher
and stocks that are squeezing higher.


Could QIHU be next to squeeze higher after earnings?

Why do you dig into small things like patch? It will not affect its' user base. As I said before, the stupidest thing QIHU
made is making money from web directory. If google is making money from web directory, its' price will be 30$. The
same with QIHU, if QIHU start doing other stuffs such as the search engine, game, online video , it will make lots of
money since it already has so many users.

Thanks for the ride, if it were not for the geniuses over thinking and over analyzing (and therefore thinking they were
better and smarter than the rest of us, so SHORTING), then us who simply follow trends and buy stocks when they
seam cheap with catalysts ahead, would never be get such fast and strong returns when the shorts get so 
S-Q-U-E-E-Z-E-D!!


tried to warn with QIHU at $17+ and $19+ that all the names in the group were killing #'s on both top and bottom line
and stocks were getting ridiculous moves both in anticipation and after reporting, YES, sometimes it is just that simple
and straightforward, today QIHU stopped just before $25.
