CLSD


CLSD has blown through our $11 target post a $36mil in-the-hole offering at $9.


We felt the stock was overvalued at $22, but post the offering, we believe there is
significant upside to the stock and we are now long.


While we believe CLS-1001 revenue will disappoint, we do anticipate additional
FDA approval in RVO and DME and other indications. These much larger markets
represent significant upside.


With the news of lock-up and secondary in the rear view mirror, we believe the
stock could recover quickly to our original $11 target.

We recently released a report highlighting why we thought Clearside Biomedical, Inc.
(NASDAQ:CLSD) was overvalued at $22 and some concerns we felt investors were not
considering. We made a case that the stock could see 50% downside to $11 per share.


Last Friday, December 9th, CLSD announced the pricing of a secondary in-the-hole
offering at $9 per share after several days of decline post its lock-up expiration on
November 29th. The stock hit a low of $8.61 per share in early trading that day. Today,
we thought we would provide an update to review the current situation and why we are
far more bullish with the stock near $9. In fact, we now are long the stock and will likely
buy more if it goes lower. So what's changed?


We believe the stock had been selling off based on a combination of factors that created
a "perfect storm." The main factors included:


Valuation1.


Lock-up expiration2.


Recognition of aggressive analyst assumptions for its first drug, CLS-10013.


A secondary announcement post lock-up expiration4.


A resulting loss in momentum5.


A very small true float6.


Valuation:


In regards to valuation, the company came public at $7 per share in June and quickly
rose to as high as $25 per share at its peak. The market cap at this price was breaching
$500mil for a company that, at best, would have revenue in late 2018 for a fairly small
initial target market to treat eyes with macular edema associated with non-infectious
uveitis (ME-NIU). This incredible run, we feel, was backed on investors' hopes of FDA
approval for the company's drug pipeline. The stock simply got way ahead of itself, in
our opinion.


Lock-up Expiration:



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4026783-limited-upside-50-percent-downside-clearside?commenter=1&comments=show&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&v=1481225735

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLSD?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
The June IPO was for 8.2mil shares and raised net proceeds of $51.4mil. On November
29th, insiders owning 12.3mil additional shares were finally able to sell, if they so
desired. This put pressure on the stock sending it falling nearly 20%. In our report, we
highlighted this as a possible cause of decline because the stock had run up over 200%
in six months to nose-bleed valuation.


Aggressive Analyst Assumptions:


In our prior report with the stock up over 200%, we looked closely at the company to
better understand what had driven the stock up so quickly post the IPO. It didn't make
sense to us that the company did the IPO in June at $7 and suddenly the stock was in
the mid-20s.


Originally, CLSD hoped to price the IPO at $14-16 but had to cut it in half, presumably
due to low demand. This made the sudden rise in the stock all the more suspect.
Following the IPO, CLSD did release some positive clinical results but that didn't appear
to fully justify the increase since no Phase 3 studies will be released until the end of next
year at the earliest on their first indication (CLS-1001).


When we looked closer at CLS-1001, it appeared that analyst and company
expectations were very aggressive on the revenue potential of the drug, especially in the
early years. We thoroughly examine why in our original report so we won't rehash it
here, but our revenue assumptions are roughly half what the street is modeling for CLS-
1001.


Profitability in the early years is, in large part, driven by strong sales of CLS-1001. We
believe these targets are unlikely to be achieved and profitability will likely be pushed
out. Most analyst models see profitability between 2020 and 2022 depending on the
model. That said, at $11, we feel the stock is taking this possibility into consideration.


Secondary Offering:



http://ir.clearsidebio.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253669&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2194893

http://www.wsj.com/articles/clearside-biomedical-goes-public-by-cutting-share-price-in-half-1464893705
Post the lock-up expiration on November 29th, CLSD filed an S-1 on November 30th to
raise $75mil with an option to raise up to $86mil. With the stock already in free fall post
the lock-up expiration and the release of our report highlighting aggressive analyst
assumptions, the stock fell another 20%. At this point, the stock had reached the $14-15
level and it was unclear at what price the secondary would be priced. The stock
stabilized in this range for a few days.


Loss of Momentum:


At this point, we believed the stock would likely be priced in the hole possibly close to
our $11 target. Amazingly, despite the fact that the company had filed an S-1 informing
investors that a secondary was in the works, the stock fell another 20% when the
company officially announced the secondary in a press release on December 7th. This
reaction was particularly surprising since the news of a secondary was already public,
and should have been well known by investors for several days. We believe, at this
point, the stock had simply lost momentum and traders were jumping ship, unaware that
the news was dated.


Very Small True Float:


What we believe many investors do not realize about CLSD is that the true float is likely
far smaller than they think. When the company came public in June, it issued 8.2mil
shares. 1.1mil of those shares were bought by insiders at $7 per share. Nearly all of
these shares are still held by these same insiders. In fact, pre-IPO investors in Clearside
hold at minimum 8.3mil shares and probably more.


In our initial public offering, or IPO, certain of our 5% stockholders and their affiliates
purchased an aggregate of 1,136,896 shares of our common stock. Each of those
purchases was made through the underwriters at the initial public offering price of
$7.00 per share.

This indicates that in the IPO only ~7.1mil shares were sold to investors that would not
be considered pre-IPO insiders. Prior to the secondary, we consider these 7.1mil shares
the maximum "true float." Many of these shares may still be held by original investors,
which would make the float to this point even smaller.


For example, 5.4mil of these 7.1mil "true float" shares were bought by Wellington
Management Group, Cormorant Global Healthcare and Rock Springs Capital at the IPO
price of $7 or very near it sometime in June according to 13G filings.


There is no way to know how many of these shares they still currently hold, if any.
However, based on 13F filings, all three of them owned almost all 5.4mil shares as of
the end of September. At the end of September, CLSD had already breached $17 per
share. The fact that they held the stock up to that level and hadn't sold according to their
filings is encouraging.


Wellington 13F 9/30/16


Cormorant 13F 9/30/16


Rock Springs Capital 9/30/16


If we make the assumption that they still own half of the 5.4mil shares, or 2.7mil shares
and add the additional ~1mil shares held by pre-IPO insiders that bought stock in the
IPO, it further reduces the "true float" from 7.1mil shares to 3.4mil shares. This helps
explain the extremely wild upward moves in this stock prior to 11/29 and the subsequent
decline as the lock-up expired.

Time to Flip The Script:
Pre-IPO insiders were willing to buy up to $25mil of the IPO, even when they were
originally planning to bring the deal between $14 and 16 per share. Ultimately, they had
to lower the offering to $7 and also increased the shares offered from 4mil to 7.2mil.
That said, when the price was lowered, they increased their offer to purchase shares.
They offered to purchase over 3.9mil shares worth $27.3mil.


Remember, the IPO was in June. At that time all healthcare stocks were under immense
pressure due to comments from Hillary Clinton regarding pharmaceutical pricing. It was
a very tough period to get any deal done in the space. CLSD initially hoped to price the
IPO at $14 but had to cut it to $7. We believe at $7, pre-IPO insiders couldn't resist and
offered to take down half the deal for themselves.


Certain of our existing stockholders and their affiliated entities, including holders of
more than 5% of our common stock and stockholders who are affiliated with certain of
our directors, have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 3,922,608 shares of our
common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price per share.


~424B, 6/1/16, pg. 161


As we already mentioned above, they only ended up getting 1.1mil shares, but the fact
that they were willing to do half the deal themselves at $7 per share speaks volumes in
our opinion about their belief in the company.


Insiders Don't Appear Ready to Sell:


Of the 12.3mil shares that came off lock-up on 11/29, 8.3mil are held by pre-IPO insiders
that would need to file a Form 4 if they were going to sell shares. That hasn't happened.
It would appear that if any lock-up shares are driving the stock lower, it could only be the
remaining 4mil shares not held by pre-IPO insiders. With the stock now around $9 there
is far less incentive to sell.


If pre-IPO insiders who owned ~40% of CLSD prior to the secondary were looking for
the exit, then the secondary would have been a good time for it. When the secondary
was initially announced, the stock was still near $20, well above the $7 IPO price and
very well above the cost basis of insiders.

A secondary is a great opportunity for insiders to sell stock because instead of having to
slowly sell stock in small batches over a very long period, they can dump the shares at a
discount to investors in one big swoop. Twilio (TWLO) is another recent IPO that did a
secondary. In that secondary 7mil shares were sold, mostly by insiders post a quick
300% run in the stock. So how many shares did CLSD insiders sell in the secondary?
Zero.


Additionally, the secondary was originally supposed to raise at least $75mil and up to
$86mil. The S-1A filed last Friday was for 4mil shares at $9, or only $36mil with an
option for an additional 600k shares for a max raise of $41.4mil.


There are two possibilities for why the initial raise was essentially cut in half. The first
possibility is that there was a lack of demand. The second possibility is that the
management didn't want to raise money at $9 because it thought it was too cheap. In
our opinion, this is the more likely reason. Either way, the smaller raise is a positive for
current investors. If CLSD had raised the full $86mil at $9 it would have diluted current
shareholders by about 9.6mil shares. Now the secondary will only add 4.6mil shares at
most.


Additionally, it was nice to see JPMorgan (JPM) added as a banker for the secondary.
We feel it will help give the stock more credibility with institutional investors. We're also
hopeful that it will roll out coverage on the name which could provide a catalyst.


Current Valuation:


Post the raise, we estimate CLSD will have approximately 28.3mil shares on a fully
diluted basis (assumes options and stock issuance) for a $255mil market cap at $9 per
share. Post the raise, the company will have $90mil in cash and $8mil in debt.


CLSD Enterprise Value Post Secondary:


($255m mcap + $8m debt - $90m cash) = $173m enterprise value


What We Like About The Business:



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWLO?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
We feel at $9 per share and a $173mil enterprise value that shares of CLSD are
extremely compelling for longs. Despite what we highlighted in our initial report
regarding aggressive assumptions for CLS-1001, we believe the company's future looks
very bright in other indications. In addition to CLS-1001 for macular edema associated
with NIU (ME-NIU), it is seeking approval for retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic
macular edema (DME) and wet AMD. These are all much larger markets that measure
in the millions of patients and billions of dollars worldwide.


Since CLSD's microinjector is injecting a steroid (triamcinolone acetonide) that
ophthalmologists have been using for decades to treat these diseases, we feel the
likelihood of approval is far higher than a typical drug. If CLSD is able to achieve FDA
approval for CLS-1001, the chances of it getting approval increases for the other
indications, particularly for RVO and DME.


For CLS-1001, the company is using its patented microinjector platform to inject
triamcinolone acetonide (TA) into a patient's eye, specifically into the suprachoroidal
space (SCS). For RVO and DME, CLSD is using the same drug with the microinjector.
We believe that using the same drug to treat these other indications that doctors already
currently use to treat these diseases increases the chance of approval in RVO and
DME.
This unique, novel approach is an improvement over current treatments. The
microinjector allows the drug to more directly access the area of disease near the
macula in the back of the eye. As a result, far less drug is required to achieve efficacy.
Less drug often leads to fewer side effects. Thus far in clinical trials, CLSD's
microinjector has had none of the side effects typically associated with steroid injections
like cataracts or intraocular pressure (IOP) that leads to glaucoma. These types of side
effects are typical for intravitreal injection of steroids and is a major reason why anti-
VEGF drugs are preferred over steroid injections in most cases.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/9/47406777-1481321672520797_origin.jpg
CLSD's microinjector injects the drug to the SCS between the sclera and choroid. By
accessing the drug in this "channel" around the eye, the drug is able to reach the back
of the eye near the macula. Macular edema, RVO, DME and wet AMD are all back-of-
the-eye diseases.


Additionally, because the drug is more concentrated to the back of the eye where the
disease is located, the drug is able to act quicker and stays longer within the diseased
tissue. CLSD believes patients will only require injections approximately 4x per year vs.
the more common monthly injections many patients receive with anti-VEGF drugs.


Note the long needle currently used for intravitreal injections of steroids and anti-VEGF
drugs. CLSD's microinjector is a fraction of the length and only enters the top layer
(sclera) or "white" of the eye.
A typical intravitreal injection into the center, or vitreous of the eye treating a leaking
blood vessel at the back. Very little drug is able to reach the back of the eye with this
method. The drug is spread to the entire eye in a less concentrated form. The eye ends
off with little drug at the back but significant amounts where it is not needed in the
intermediate (middle) and anterior (front) of the eye. This increases the chance of
adverse events. The longer intravitreal needle can also cause more structural damage
to the eye. CLSD believes it can achieve similar results to intravitreal injections with as
little as 1/10th the amount of drug by injection into the SCS.


Market Size:


We believe the initial indication for macular edema associated with NIU is quite small,
and far smaller than current analyst estimates. This was one of the reasons we initially
highlighted CLSD as a short at $22. Our estimates are that peak sales for CLS-1001, in
this indication, are less than $100mil. Some analysts currently assume 2-3x that. We
also are predicting a much slower revenue ramp for CLS-1001 vs. current street
estimates. Our revenue ramp for CLS-1001 is about 50% below current street
estimates. However, at current valuation, we believe the stock is more than reflecting
our more conservative assumptions on CLS-1001.


The far bigger opportunity for CLSD is in RVO (CLS-1003), DME (CLS-1004) and wet
AMD (CLS-1002) and other indications. While these approvals are further out, after
CLS-1001, the company is hoping to enter the market in RVO post FDA approval in
2020. According to the company, the market for RVO is 2.2mil patients, the market for
DME is 1.1mil patients and the market for wet AMD is 1.2mil patients in the US alone.
This compares to its estimated market size for CLS-1001 to treat ME-NIU of 350k
patients. We believe a more accurate number of CLS-1001 is closer to 200k patients.


Analysts currently assume CLSD will charge a price of $900 per injection per eye for its
microinjector. Yearly price increases are also likely. On average, patients will need
injections about 3-4x per year. The revenue potential in these other indications is very
large. While it is difficult to know the precise size of these additional indications, each is
likely a multiple 3-4x or more of the CLS-1001 market. This would represent several
hundred million dollars in revenue to CLSD. Broadly speaking, most analyst models
have highly profitable revenue ranging between $300mil and over $700mil per year over
the next 6-10 years for CLSD.

In Conclusion:


The risk remains for clinical trials, FDA approvals, and operational/sales execution, but
at $9 per share and an enterprise value of only $173mil we believe that current valuation
of CLSD is very attractive. From a business perspective, this is the same company
investors were willing to buy for more than twice the market cap just a few weeks ago.
Nothing operationally has changed. If CLSD is successful in achieving FDA approval for
its microinjector, we believe the upside could be tremendous, although this may take
several years to play out.


We believe short-term momentum traders have overreacted to old news about the
secondary. The loss of momentum in the stock presents long-term investors with an
opportunity to own shares at a price that only a couple weeks ago would have been
considered dirt cheap. We believe at this level investors have priced in some of the
issues we brought to light in our prior report and the stock has now overshot to the
downside.


Secondary investors who are buying at $9 and represent 4.6mil of the float are not likely
to sell below that price. Insiders that represent about 8.3mil shares do not seem
interested in selling here. Those shareholders represent 12.9mil shares combined.
There are only 25.1mil shares in the total float. Lastly, anyone who bought in on the IPO
at $7 who didn't sell in the $20s would also be less inclined to sell here. That only leaves
the momentum traders who are likely being washed out at these levels.

With the completion of the secondary, the stock should become more liquid and less
volatile over time. This could lead to increased institutional holders and increased
coverage. News of the lock-up and secondary are in the rear view mirror and the stock
should begin to stabilize. We wouldn't be surprised to see the stock in the $10-11 range
in the near term for an upside of about 20%.
