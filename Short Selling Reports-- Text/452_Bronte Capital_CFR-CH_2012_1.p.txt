Richemont: waiting for the bullet
At my hedge fund we usually short frauds. Stuff with dodgy accounts and dodgy prospects promoted
by people who would be car salesmen if stock promotion were less lucrative. But sometimes, just
sometimes we find ourselves aching to short a real company with fine management where business
prospects are going south very fast. 
 
Richemont - the mega-luxury good maker with a focus on watches and jewellery is the latest example.
We are waiting for a highly valued high quality company producing spectacular goods to have a
similarly spectacular earnings miss. 
 
The company describes its brands as "Maisons" (French for houses) harking back to some long
established tradition in a Swiss-French mountain chalet surrounded by snow where they produce fine
(if somewhat pretentious) luxury goods. Still these brands have taken over the world - and now if you
walk through Venice or Hong Kong or Shanghai or around the areas frequented by Asian tourists in
Hawaii or Sydney you find the global standard set of luxury goods. The fact that they could make their
product both ubiquitous and exclusive somewhat amazes me - but they have achieved that. These
are amazing companies. 
 
With amazing profits too. The Jewellery Maisons [Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels] in the (March ended)
2012 financial year produced €4.59 billion in sales with €1.51 in operating profit. The growth rate has
been almost Apple-like. In 2007 sales were €2.68 billion, profits €742 million. In 2004 the Jewellery
Maisons had only €367 million in profit. This stuff did unbelievably well out of the rising of a new
plutocracy - but particularly out of a new kleptocratic Asian plutocracy. 
 
Watches did similarly well. I find watches strangely redundant (a smart phone is both more accurate
and more useful and you probably carry one anyway). However they have become the only really
acceptable piece of male jewellery by which the elite can show their status. In these days of business
casual (and the studied casual of Ralph Lauren) an Italian tailored suit does not do it. 
 
An iPhone or a Galaxy IIIs shows status amongst the middle and upper middle income. A ten
thousand dollar or five hundred thousand dollar watch will do a (far) worse job of telling the time - but
screams in only the way stupid-money can. I am not (at all) interested in watches so I had to look up
the Maisons. These are houses like Vacheron Constantin of Geneve and A. Lange and Söhne from
Glashütte (Saxony, Germany). Sort of glad I don't fancy their products because looking around
Vacheron Constantin sell relatively plain gold watches at fifty thousand a pop:

A. Lange and Söhne sells similarly plain watches at prices marginally lower - but also sell less plain
watches at prices closer to half a million dollars: 
 


 
 
 
 
Remember both these products are inferior for purpose to the smart phone already in your pocket.
But they do say "look at me" the latter in a particularly Rococo fashion. 
 
It is the Rococo stuff that is winning. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry publish export
data from Switzerland (not sales to end consumers). June data shows a 4.1 percent reduction in
volume, a 21.7 increase in value. The average price of a watch is going up sharply. This has been the
case for years. The Federation published this graph which shows that (relatively accurate) electronic
watches have been flat in value for years - but that mechanical movements (inaccurate but
reassuringly expensive) have gone skyward:

Moreover a disproportionate amount of the volume - and an even more disproportionate amount of
the value has gone to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is the destination for a quarter of Swiss watches by
value and an even higher proportion of the most expensive stuff. 
 
Why Hong Kong? Because the sales tax rate is lower than China. If you are buying a thousand dollar
watch you can buy it in Shanghai. But if you want a half-million dollar watch (no, not kidding) then the
sales tax differential makes it worthwhile to fly to Hong Kong, get a nice hotel room and go shopping.
That is why the value is in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong market is it - it is the biggest pile of value and
the biggest place for the super-pretentious stuff - the stuff with fat margins. This stuff is really Rococo
- and Rococo is a style beloved only by rappers and kleptocrats. 
 
The Chinese kleptocracy has been very good to Richemont. Indeed they famously love their watches.
And it is not only watches. Van Cleef & Arpels is Rococo too. Try this ring:

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Richemont: waiting for the bullet


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/08/richemont-waiting-for-bullet.html 4/14


 
 
As I said - this is the stuff of rappers and kleptocrats. And there are far more kleptocrats in China than
rich rappers anywhere. 
 
Data sources 
 
There are several data sources I watch to keep tabs on spending by Chinese elite. The Swiss Watch
data is obvious. 
 
Exports to Hong Kong in June were up 21.2 percent. It was about the same in May (but the monthly
data has disappeared from the web). It was about the same every other month this year. They keep
upping the exports to Hong Kong. 
 
But Hong Kong also has sales tax data which comes from the sales tax receipts. There is in the data
a series for "Jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts" by both value and volume. The value
series - relatively flattering, has monthly sales (versus previous corresponding period) for the last six
months as: 
 
 
 


1. +18.3%
2. +14.1%
3. +18.4%
4. +15.1%
5. +2.9%
6. +3.1%


Sales growth stopped. However exports to Hong Kong kept up (note that 21.2 percent figure above). 
 
The volume growth actually went negative - being negative 3.4 and 3.1 percent for the last two
months.
 
What do you do with an inventory glut of hundred thousand dollar watches. You can't really discount
them - so they just sit there, looking a little stale and slowly devaluing your brand.
 
And that is why I am short the stock. It is a trading short really - this company is likely to miss earnings
and it will miss it in an unfortunate way - they are going to be swamped with inventory.
 
It is not just watches either. Anecdotally a Van Cleef and Arpels show that was huge last year was
distinctly quieter this year. 
 
The company has given a hint of this. Bernard Fornas - the chief executive of Cartier - gave an
interview to the Wall Street Journal. To quote:
 


"After a phenomenal year last year, there's been a bit of a slowdown in mainland
China," he explained. 


"Mainland China is still holding for us. One month is worse, one month is better. The
curve is not yet clearly defined.” 


Fornas added that while Cartier’s watch sales are still increasing, it is not at the same
rate as 2011. He declined to reveal figures or percentages, however.


 
But that quote is misleading. He says it is one month worse, one month better. But it is one month
worse and the next month bad too.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Richemont: waiting for the bullet


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/08/richemont-waiting-for-bullet.html 5/14


 
My guess: this company is not being entirely straight with market about how much tougher things are
getting. The company will guide down and the stock will be singled out for "special treatment". I am
short - just waiting for the bullet.
 
So why did the slowdown happen so sharply?
 
The slowdown in Hong Kong (super) luxury goods is a faster decline than other Chinese data. Why so
fast? 
 
I have a theory given to me by a China watcher. The theory - it turned bad sharply with the ouster
of Bo Xilai and now the murder charge on his wife Gu Kailai. Gu Kailai is going to have a hard time
avoiding a mobile execution unit. This changes the stakes and it is structural. A half million dollar
watch no longer says "look at me". It says "look at me, I am a kleptocrat". Thoughts of that beautiful
Van Cleef and Arpels hair clip become the last thing that runs through your brain before the bullet. 
 
The optimists - and there are many - think the super luxury good market in China will return when the
political situation stabilizes. To quote Bernard Fornas in that WSJ article: 


"When you talk to the people over there, they are all waiting for a new president to
come in. That will fuel the economy with fresh money and lower interest rates."


 
But who said the new kleptocracy will love Rococo just as much as the old kleptocracy? Maybe party
self-preservation will require less ostentatious displays of wealth. After all ostentatiously showing off
wealth to an oppressed billion people does not seem like a way to preserve your power. 
 
We know what a completely collapsed luxury good market looks like. Brazilians like a bit of bling. But
in the late 1980s and into the 1990s the kidnapping rate in Brazil went skyward. (There is an horrific
documentary about that called Manda Bala which translates "send a bullet".) After kidnapping became
a major industry (particularly in São Paulo) carrying a $3000 handbag no longer said "look at me", it
said "kidnap me". 
 
A collapsed luxury good market in China may - if the Gu Kailai case is a guide - look different. Bling
will mark you as an enemy of the people. This is a company about imagery - it sells a dream. Here is
the nightmare:

John, as you noted this is outside your usual area of interest for shorts. 
 
I'm curious as to how you sourced/stumbled upon the idea. Was it looking for watch
companies or working down from a macro view of China spending? 
 
Thank you for the great reads!

John, What are the last two pictures of? Where did they come from?

The last two pictures really are Chinese executions - the latter of Tibetan dissidents.

I wish they had some leverage. That to me is what prevents me from getting interested in
them as shorts.

Thanks, excellent post. Seems that China and Sao Paulo are extremes but the "class
war" in US is an echo of same. My A. Lange & Sohne has been in the safe deposit box
for over 2 years, apart from potential safety issues, it's just no fun to wear anymore. I'll put
it back on once good times return, assuming I live that long. It's German, btw, not Swiss.
Their CEO agrees with you, once said, to paraphrase, you don't buy our watch to tell
time, that's what a cell phone is for. Amazing, eh?

I am curious why you chose Richemont over Swatch? The latter has a higher share of
greater China (incl Hong Kong) sales - 38% vs 27% for Richemont. Swatch shares
gained 4.8% since reporting Q2 on July 24 vs 4.5% for the SMI by the way.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Richemont: waiting for the bullet


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/08/richemont-waiting-for-bullet.html 8/14


this company is pretty straightforward. It trades at a discount to its peers. It owns a
number of highly desirable luxury brands, most of which have been around for 75 years
or longer. It is the only luxury company that has a good in-house e-commerce strategy.  
 
However, a huge chunk of their revenues derive from what you astutely call ‘Roccoco’.
The reasons for purchasing such big ticket items differ materially from purchases of
handbags or silk ties. Buyers treat it like purchasing an asset class and not as
discretionary spending. Indeed, I remember reading an interview with CEO Johann
Rupert where he stated that he was personally acquainted with buyers who have spent
over $100 million annually on Cartier. 
 
As an asset class, Richemont’s Roccoco is tangible, easily transportable, easy to hide
and, thanks to the brand familiarity, relatively easy to sell on. If purchased at an airport
there are no sales taxes either. Owning a Cartier collection makes for a pretty good
“getaway stash”.  
 
Not being able to wear jewellery in public is therefore not really an issue. It wasn’t
intended for display to begin with. More so, Bo Xilai discredited the neo-Maoist movement
more than anything else and something tells me that they weren’t big on peacocking.
How Richemont fares from this point on will be primarily determined by how its products
fare as an asset class. The Chinese slowdown in asset inflation will probably hurt it more
than any of the reasons that you have stated. An increase in the attractiveness of
alternative asset classes will too.

Some counter-arguments: 
 
As long as there are nouveau riche, they will buy bling. 
 
The difference vs. Sao Paolo is that in Beijing, the people who buy the bling are the ones
with the guns and the tanks, and shoot the people who would take them. In a police state,
your bling is safe. 
 
A regime that can manage a transition from near-feudal conditions to being the best
manufacturer of the most high-tech products has a pretty good chance of managing a
transition to less export- and infrastructure-led growth. 
 
Despite corruption, the Chinese government delivers the goods to the people in vastly
improved standard of living, literacy, medical care. When people's hopes are met, and
protests are heard, there is no revolution. When people's hopes are disappointed, and
protest is suppressed, then there is risk of revolution. 
 
The leadership has a lot of legitimacy, since no one can argue the Chinese people have
not 'stood up'. Compared to the standard of living and freedom in the US, China looks
wanting. Compared to anything anyone alive has experienced in China, they're
witnessing a miracle. There is no tradition of popular democracy. There is no tradition of
successful popular revolution (except the Communists). 
 
I think applying a Minsky analysis to China is wrong, because it's a state-directed
economy, so there's no opportunity for a Fisher debt-deflation cycle to take hold.
Everybody just gets bailed out and the cycle starts over. (Doesn't apply to the shadow
banking system, if that's more significant than I know I could be wrong, but I don't think
anyone really knows.) 
 
In the short run you may very well be right that luxury growth will decline, but I think the
burden of proof is very much on those who predict a really spectacular blowup .

This is an interesting conversation. To add to what John wrote, about 9 months ago I met
with the CFO of one of HK's largest publicly traded jewelery retailers. I was shocked with
how open he was talking about his VIP customer base contributing a large portion of their
high ASP purchases.  
 
He walked me through why these government officials would be purchasing these ultra-
luxury items. They will embezzle cash over to HK and purchase for example a $100,000
watch or even better a $100,000 diamond as it's easier to hide than the cash. These
transactions occur in HK because there's a 17% VAT as well as a 13% luxury item tax in

the Mainland. Instead of losing $30k in additional tax you are glad to spend a $1k to fly to
HK.  
 
Another interesting aspect is that we've seen strong inflation in these ultra-luxury jewelery
products. The game of price inflation is tolerable as long as an increasing amount of
money is embezzled out of China by kleptocrats, thus keeping prices on the rise. If these
officials think prices will collapse due to less being embezzled then they themselves will
hold back as well. 
 
This CFO expected sales to slow down into the transition but didn't think it would be a
dramatic fall. (Even if he did he would be a fool to say that). It'll be interesting to see what
happens. Anyways that's my 2 cents.

Having worked at a large luxury goods company recently (diamonds) I can tell you that
the demand for this stuff is alive and well. You may be right about a downturn in China
(although it could just be a change in fashion--which will lead to renewed demand by
rendering old watched obsolete), but there's plenty of countries with kleptocrats around
nowadays. If Hong Kong has a downturn, maybe the top Russian destinations will do
better.

I'm looking for a chance to buy Richemont, so we're both hoping the stock price tumbles. 
 
I think your talk of a revolution is overly dramatic, a normal downturn/recession will do the
job nicely enough. Good call spotting the HK tax receipt trend.

I guess I am less convinced that things like gaming are as bulletproof as Chanos likes to
think.  
 
Firstly, look at Macau casino revenues (get the Macau statistics) and look at how
correlated it is with fixed asset investment. Why? Because you need to have a big dumb
government boondoggle to over invoice to get the money in the first place. You then blow
it in Macau and whatnot. I think people are slowly but surely working out that much as the
US was "one trade" with housing from 2003-2008 the correlation in China is a lot higher
than you'd think too.  
 
On Russian backup demand for luxury goods I just don't see it. Sure watches are high
value and fungible (bid offer on a Rolex Oyster is tighter than a lot of distressed bonds)
but are kleptocrats going to fill the gap?  
 
- How much of the wealth in Russia, Brazil and the like over the last decade was
investment driven?  
- How are these underlying commodity markets faring with the increase in supply and
Chinese slowdown in demand? Badly.  
- Will they see radical increase in demand from here or gradual demand destruction and
supply side pressures. I think the latter - as iron ore miners.  
 
Only tasteless thieves of natural resources wear a 50k watch and that's where the money
is. I'd be fascinated to get a breakdown of profits by model but my understanding is that
these companies are much more leveraged to a certain kind of demand than you'd like to
think.

John, I think your understanding of china is largely correct. On luxury spending, one prior
comment could be correct - it's an asset class instead of a good. A middle level official
can easily own 10 Beijing apartments. If a portion of this becomes watches, it will be a lot.
I am sure you already know, another indicator is Macau casino volume.

John, 
 
really brilliant idea, I was thinking about shorting luxury stocks as well. 
 
As one commentator already mentioned, Richemonts stuff could be used to transfer
wealth out of China easily. 
 
On the other hand, as soon as a hear someone declaring "this is a nwe asset class", my
instincts tell me to short this. 
 
So a cmpromisecould be to look at companies like Prada or Boss, which might be
impacted as well but whose products cannot really be used to transfer wealth.

About your question on what to do with unsold stock. While you are correct that the store
can't discount it, there is a thriving grey market in these watches where another party
sells the watch at a discount. These sales aren't "official" - i.e., they can' tbe serviced by
the factory - but they are good enough for most people. 
 
Also, one of the reasons this market exists is because authorized retailers are forced to
buy a certain number of watches a year in order to keep their status. 
 
I don't know a ton about it but I'm sure one of your other readers can fill you in with more
details.

I don't understand the currency argument: if it's being used as a currency, then shouldn't
the watches be trading amongst those people treating it as such? How many watches
need to be in the wild before people stop needing to buy more from Richemont? Plus who
are the buyers and what are they willing to pay? Shouldn't there be a huge discount to
retail for a resale? Makes no sense to me...

A quick perusal of some watches on the auction houses (Christies, Sothebys, for bigger
volume models eBay) suggest taking a loss of 50-75% or more on the retail purchase
price when reselling. Yes there are a few rare pieces made recently that have appreciated
but most seem to depreciate and depreciate rapidly - suggesting most of the value is
being captured by the manufacturer. Good for them, bad for "investors".

Re HK data sources, you say "But Hong Kong also has sales tax data". 
 
Hong Kong has no sales tax. The Census and Statistics data you referred to is retail
sales data. It is gathered from "a scientific sample of 3000 retail outlets...each month."

Shorting luxury goods? Are all those Saudi princes and Qatari "businessman" suddenly
going broke? Get serious. The people with the money to waste on this shite are the least
likely to sucked down the rabbit, unless peak oil suddenly starts to bite, then it's
everybody out of the water and f--- the stock market. 
 
The petty power cliques in the CCP mean almost nothing. This kind of BS is going on all

I am in the high end collectable wristwatch market as one of the biggest dealers in the
world. There is no end to the demand for watches, but the pricing is somewhat fluid. My
biggest surprise when I started in the business was just how many people there are in the
world with the desire and money to buy $50K watches and up. 
 
It's worth pointing out that collecting watches is a genuine passion for many affluent and
non-affluent people. I have had business and entertainment business icons in my office,
examining and talking about watches for hours, like kids in a candy store. We have
numerous customers with multiple-million dollar watch collections, and hundreds of
customers who buy just one or a couple $50K-$100K watches. 
 
China was the most important watch market up until a year or so ago. It was preceded by
Russia. But Europe and America have lots of serious collectors. Japan is a mainstay. My
point being that there is plenty of demand for expensive watches. 
 
Watches being small and easily shipped or transported, tend to find their way into
secondary markets when they don't sell at retail. They all end up on a wrist somewhere. 
 
I will say that some brands, including the two kings, Rolex and Patek Philippe, which each
have raised prices every 6 months or so over the past couple of years, are starting to
price themselves out of their respective target customer markets. That hasn't happened
before. However, these unsold watches will all make their way into secondary markets, at
a discount, and get sold. 
 
Importantly, over the past few years, truly collectable watches (generally complicated
Pateks and vintage Rolex sports watches) have become a genuine asset class. We have
asset managers calling us to buy certain watches for a portfolio. We have wealthy people

calling us all the time saying they would rather own a $100K watch than $100K worth of
paper assets. 
 
Yes, in 2008 the watch market crashed in September. But by 2010, prices were recovered
and today, regularly, watches set records at auction. 
 
Could the watch market slow down going forward? Yes. If everything else crashes again,
it may too. But don't underestimate the passion of many thousands of collectors who will
ensure that watches remain as coveted and exclusive and valuable and liquid as always. 
 
My comments are meant toward high end (Patek, Audemars, Vacheron, Lange, Breguet)
or at least strongly branded jewelry type watches (Cartier mostly) generally. Vintage
complicated or very rare pieces particularly do well, even when the rest of the market
crashed in 2008. Rolex will take care of itself given its iconic brand. Prices will adjust
down in a soft market, but they all sell. 
 
Don't forget that the manufacturer makes their money when they sell to wholesale. They
aren't hurt by weakness in the retail marketplace, the dealers and wholesalers are. 
 
I used to work in asset management. The watch business is a great business, not only
because of the financial rewards, nor thanks to the robustness of demand, but because of
the passion of the customers and collectors.

Great article. It caused me to recall the use of jewels in HK as currency and bribes with
Japanese occupiers in WW2. Barton Biggs had written a piece on that phenomenon that I
think he mentions in passing in "Hedgehogs".

I started loving the first few paragraphs until I reached the bottom part of the post. Those
are hideous and I am not sure of its linkage with watches and luxurious goods. Anyway,
you got a thought provoking post.

Swatch Group CEO will "fight" to meet 2012 profit goal. I had actually the same reasoning
than you had the week before and I was dead wrong as you were. Perhaps the story is
catching up now...

Well I have been long on Richemont for 2 years now and Happy I did so. In the world
we're living, the rich are getting richer in increasing numbers (the opposite is
unfortunately not true) and I think that strong 100 years old brand will continue to thrive.
Because a company like Richemont is not managed by some cowboy hedge funds, that
can make 600 M profit one year and be out of business the next, they build over the long
terms 5 years minimum, they have no leverage, flushed with cash and the most important
Richemont is well placed to enjoy the macroeconomic trends of the world we are living in.

I dont know if you still shorting but 21% stock price increase in 4 months, I hope you got
out. A correction could happen soon, as 73 SF for the stock is getting expensive, but the
long term horizon for the Richemont, LVMH is bright.
