China Sky and KinKin Kure.


Posted on October 6, 2009 by Asensio.com


According to filings with the US Securities and Exchange


Commission (“SEC”) and the Hong Kong Companies Registry


(“HKCR”), in 2006 China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI)


issued 211,772 shares, equal to more than 2% of its total shares


outstanding as of June 30, 2006, to Luminus Capital Management,


Ltd., a Hong Kong company half-owned by Henny Wee at the time


of CSKI’s reverse merger in 2006.


Henny Wee was involved in questionable auditing practices at


American Dairy, Inc. (NYSE: ADY), which prompted an investigation


by the SEC, according to a 2007 article in Barron’s. The Barron’s


article concerns Henny Wee’s questionable relationship with


Murrell, Hall, McIntosh & Co., PLLP, (“Murrell Hall”), one of CSKI’s


three former auditors, and ADY.


CSKI announced that it dismissed Murrell Hall the day after the


Barron’s story appeared. CSKI and ADY are both Chinese companies


listed in the US through reverse mergers arranged by American


Eastern Securities, Inc.


The stock exchange agreement between CSKI (then called Comet


Technologies, Inc.) and American California Phamaceutical Group,


Inc. (“ACPG”) shows Luminus Capital Management, Ltd. (Hong


Kong) being “issued” 109,606 CSKI shares. Click here.


Filings with the HKCR show that at the time of CSKI’s reverse


merger, Luminus was wholly owned by Esanda Limited, another


Hong Kong company, and that Henny Wee was the stated owner of


50% of Esanda Limited at the time of CSKI’s reverse merger. Click


here and here to view the HKCR filings.


Perhaps not by coincidence, Charles Hung, the principal of


American Eastern Securities, is also listed as the principal of

Luminus Capital, LLC, a Los Angeles based business, according to


California state records.


In CSKI’s May 15, 2006 8-K Luminus is listed among “the


stockholders of American California Pharmaceutical Group, Inc.


and their designees” that were issued CSKI shares in connection


with the reverse merger. However, the same 8-K includes ACPG’s


audited financial statements, which state that two individuals,


Yanqing Liu and Xiaoyan Han “owned 100% common stock of


American California Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. prior to the


merger.”


Thus, according to ACPG’s own audited statements, Luminus was


not a shareholder of ACPG, but Luminus still received 109,606 CSKI


shares in the reverse merger. CSKI made no other disclosure


concerning why shares were issued to Luminus, or whether


Luminus paid any cash amount or provided other consideration in


exchange for the shares to ACPG, its shareholders, or CSKI.


Liu and Han together owned about 6 million shares, only about 60%


of CSKI shares outstanding, following the reverse merger.


Apparently, they gave up about 40% of ACPG, or ACPG’s right to


receive CSKI shares, in the reverse merger. No further information


is available in CSKI filings on the matter.


SEC filings show that Henny Wee and American Eastern Securities


were involved in another attempted reverse merger between the


shell that became CSKI and another Chinese company that


apparently failed to close in 2005, all prior to Comet’s reverse


merger with ACPG in 2006 that formed CSKI.


Later in 2006, Luminus was issued another 102,166 CSKI shares


through the conversion of a promissory note, bringing the total


disclosed number of shares issued to Luminus to 211,772.


According to CSKI’s 2006 Form 10-K, ACPG “signed” a $200,000 one-


year convertible note with Luminus on August 3, 2006.


Less than four weeks later, on August 28, 2006, controlling


ownership of Luminus passed from Esanda to an individual named


KinKin Kure, according to an HKCR filing. This filing shows that


Kure became the owner of 100 out of 101 shares.


In a separate HKCR document, also filed on August 26, 2006, KinKin


Kure is shown as a new director of Luminus. In this document Kure


is shown having a Japanese passport. In both documents Kure’s


address is given as Fujimino City, Saitama Ken, Japan.


Henny Wee signed both documents as a director of Zega Ltd., which


is listed as another director of Luminus.

According to the 2006 10-K, Luminus converted the note to CSKI


shares on October 3, 2006, at a conversion price of $2.00 per share,


giving Luminus another 102,166 shares. The disclosures do not


explain why ACPG, a CSKI wholly owned subsidiary, was able to


‘sign’ on issuing stock of the parent company. CSKI shares were


trading for about $6.00 around the time of the conversion. Two


weeks later, CSKI completed a private offering of 1,000,000 shares


of common stock, priced at $3 per share.


CSKI disclosures do not contain any further information concerning


Wee’s role in Comet’s failed merger or a relationship with Wee


following the reverse merger. Investors may have further questions


about Wee, especially in light of CSKI’s engagement of Murrell Hall


as its auditor in 2007.


The HKCR filings do not show details of any amount paid by KinKin


Kure to Esanda for the equity of Luminus, or whether Luminus still


owned shares of CSKI at the time KinKin Kure obtained control of


Luminus. No further public documentation on KinKin Kure has


been found to date.
