How Much Will Smith & Wesson Lower Guidance Today?

Summary


SWHC Full year Guidance was $530-540mm implies roughly $145mm for Q3 and
Q4 which we view as impossible given the industry headwinds. Even recent
acquisitions won't get SWHC there.


Better managed peer Sturm Ruger reported one month ago: -43% YOY revenue,
-77% net income - Cabelas guided that excess inventory won't clear the system for
at least a year.


SWHC stuck between rock and hard place: A) Don't discount and sales will drop
40%+ like Ruger or B) Discount heavily to maintain share and crush gross profits.


New acquisition appears to have dubious strategic rationale and now loads the
company with nearly $300mm of debt vs estimated normalized EBITDA of ~$60mm:
Could lead to chapter 11?


SWHC has a history of spending $100mm+ on acquisitions and writing them off 2
years later in 2007 (Thompson), 2009 (Universal Safety Response), and 2013 (stock
buyback at peak).


We believe Smith & Wesson (SWHC) is a value trap with severe downside risk - debt
piled on for large capex and stock buybacks during temporarily good business
conditions that are now mean reverting


FAA investigators have a euphemism, "Controlled flight into terrain." I think a year from
today, analysts will be using this to describe Smith & Wesson's decisions to massively
increase their debt load to buy back stock and double the size of their factories in
preparation for a new, permanently high plateau of gun demand.


The best shorts, in my view, do not have crazy valuations that are liable to double - as it is
well known that 2*Crazy = Crazy. Stocks that appear cheap but with predictably
deteriorating earnings are far less risky shorts as the driving reason the bottom hasn't
fallen out already is an attractive valuation based on irrelevant, backwards-looking
numbers.

Historically the firearms business has been a mediocre business - up until 2012, RGR,
SWHC compounded at roughly a 3% CAGR over the last 20 and 10 years as public
companies, respectively. Not terrible but basically commodity businesses. Have been
around for a century, gun demand has basically tracked with GDP growth in America.
Beginning with Obama's election but peaking with a confluence of events in 2012 and
2013 including the Sandy Hook School shooting drove fear of policy change by the
Obama administration on future restrictions on gun purchasing.


This spurred a "gun bubble" causing a huge increase in demand for firearms through 2013
- a leading indicator of this is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
(NICBCS) which jumped to record levels. I won't go into great detail about the politics
behind it but it is a widely discussed topic and I have not found any compelling evidence
that there is a structural shift in gun demand and this thesis only requires mean reversion
to the already historically elevated demand levels a few years ago.


The summary thesis for Shorting SWHC today is:


· Temporary factors resulted in demand spiking for firearms, peaking mid 2013 - these
factors are already rolling over and year over year comparisons are impossibly difficult for
manufacturers


· Firearms have historically been a commodity - quality (i.e. not great) business earning
~10% Return on Assets employed


· Due to shortages, EBITDA margins and ROA's have roughly TRIPLED at SWHC (and
also RGR) for 2012-2013


· SWHC management has a history of terrible capital allocation, writing off 90%+ of their
last two acquisitions in 2007 and 2009


· Flush with 'bubble profits', SWHC management massively increased their debt load to
buy back stock at peak levels and increase production capacity (i.e. fixed costs)


· Massive increases in capacity (capex spending in 2012-2013 by SWHC and RGR
roughly doubled PP&E for both) and channels stuffed with inventory of very durable
firearms means there won't be an uptick in the supply/demand balance for years and it
may overcorrect to the downside (e.g. the housing bubble still has still not worked through
its excess inventory almost a decade later)

· Due to increased fixed PP&E, the Company estimates that maintenance capex is now
$25mm/year - which is roughly equal to 94% of Operating Income (Avg $26.6mm/yr) for
the 5 years 'pre-bubble' 2007-2011.


· Even assuming no overcorrection to the downside, at normalized margins over the last
decade (including Obama's first term where firearm demand was already elevated),
SWHC is worth maybe $5/share for 50% downside. Downside case could require
restructuring the $175mm debt load.


· Insiders have aggressively sold most of their stock over the last 18 mos


· Recent Battenfeld acquisition at 9X EBITDA and >2X revenue (vs SWHC trailing 4X
EBITDA and 1X revenue) appears to have little strategic benefit; takes any 'upside' risk of
merging with RGR off the table; and loads the company with enough debt to potentially
require restructuring next year.


Date SWHC Capital Allocation Decision Result


Jan 2007 Spend $102mm cash to acquire


Thompson/Center Arms gun maker


2 years later take $98.2mm impairment


charge


July 2009 Acquire Universal Safety Response


a perimeter security company for


$83.3mm in cash and stock (stock


~$6/sh then)


2 years later dispose of assets for


$8.3mm, roughly a 90% impairment vs


purchase price


Mid 2012-2014 1) Borrow and spend $165mm to


repurchase 18% of shares at


~$13.50/sh


2) Invest $146mm in capex


(including $24mm to acquire a


vendor) to roughly double


production capacity


Prediction: 2 years later… 2015


$175mm debt load proves to be highly


burdensome as EBITDA margins revert to


historical levels around 12% vs 28%


during 2012-2013 'Gun Bubble' peak


demand & shortages


To give the benefit of the doubt to SWHC, the prior two acquisitions were under CEO
Michael F. Golden who served as CEO from 2004 to 2011, who also hired a VP who was
charged by the SEC… Current CEO James Debney has served from Sept 27, 2011. On
the other hand, Mr. Golden remains on the board as Co-Vice Chairman. As an aside,

speaking as someone who has been on a number of boards, the fact that there is 1) An
independent Chairman, 2) A non-Chair CEO, and 3) TWO co-Vice Chairmen including a
the former CEO leads me to believe that should the company get into a difficult situation, it
will NOT be able to react quickly or decisively.


Buffett on Dynamics of Shortages in Commodity Businesses:


When shortages exist, however, even commodity businesses flourish. The insurance
industry enjoyed that kind of climate for a while but it is now gone. One of the ironies of
capitalism is that most managers in commodity industries abhor shortage conditions -
even though those are the only circumstances permitting them good returns. Whenever
shortages appear, the typical manager simply can't wait to expand capacity and thereby
plug the hole through which money is showering upon him. This is precisely what
insurance managers did in 1985-87, confirming again Disraeli's observation: "What we
learn from history is that we do not learn from history."

The Gun Bubble: Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) provides preview for SWHC given one
month earler reporting period:


Due to the numerous acquisitions and write-downs at SWHC, some charts are cleaner
from competitor RGR to highlight how distinct the period in 2012-2013 was for gun
demand and how it is clearly mean reverting already.

Gun manufacturing is a competitive space, there is some premium ascribed to the brands
vs a purely commodity metal pouring and shaping operation but this has been true over
time and is not a 'new' premium. Returns on assets will normalize at competitive levels.


Note that Ruger is already overshooting to the downside on normalized return on assets -
RGR Q4 will report a very significant loss (though due in part to a pension payment). RGR
does not have debt, SWHC does and with debt include covenants. If SWHC's EBITDA
overcorrects below ~$60mm in 2012 vs $300mm debt, they could violate their covenants
and even be forced to restructure or heavily dilute shareholders next year.

On Cabelas (NYSE:CAB)'s most recent earnings call one month ago, the company
indicated that it would take far longer than expected to clear the excess firearm inventory
from the distribution and retail channels: at least a year vs initial expectations of perhaps
3-6 months. This does not bode well for SWHC's guidance of a rapid bounce back to peak
revenue levels.

Author’s reply »  Note the covenant on the Credit line tops debt out at 3.25X EBITDA. So with $275mm debt, if
EBITDA drops below $85mm (which seems highly possible next year) then they'd be in violation

Ugly Duckling, Contributor
If they were at any risk of covenant breach they latest acquisition wouldn't have materialized.


04 Dec 2014, 03:16 PM

Author’s reply »  So no deals ever had risk because if there was risk they would not get done in the first
place? Makes sense

Insolvency risk is quite different from any other risk.

Well, UGLY Duckling ... you can explain this to PHMD management. Look at the acquisition of LCA-Vision
PHMD completed this year in the spring. 4 months later they breached convenants ... (Aug).


Desperation to mantain revenues levels ... makes you do stupid things / bad investment sometimes. Will this
be the case with SWHC? ..

I have no relationship to PHMD and there is no desperation at SW.

Very thoughtful analysis of the firearms industry, and SWHC in particular. It is surprising to me that RGR and SWHC
management both invested in expansion during the bubble. At least Ruger's Mike Fifer did not leverage up, and has
not yet repurchased any shares. And if necessary, he can close the New Hampshire factory and move production to
the nearly vacant NC facility.

And they lowered FY guidance by 25% or $0.20 from $0.88-$0.94 to $0.66-$0.70. Ouch!

What exactly is the thesis here? Gun Sales slowing so stock will trend down? The stock is already cheap partly to
reflect slowing gun sales.


09 Dec 2014, 09:38 PM

Gun channels stuffed; will affect earnings; will affect stock price. SWHC = see you at $5.


I prefer RGR anyway by a long shot... but not to touch either at the moment.

what's your take on today's SWHC PR?


"Increasing Guidance for Third Quarter and Full 2015 Fiscal Year Net Sales and Earnings Per Share"


how much did the BTI inclusion impact the guidance?

Author’s reply »  They did a similar thing last year where they boosted guidance ahead of massively whiffing
it when they actually reported shortly after.

This now trades at ~8X FY2015 EV/EBITDA with EBITDA declining and debt rising, it is not cheap esp given
the lack of synergies with Battenfeld.


20 Jan 2015, 01:42 PM


Ugly Duckling, Contributor
There are definite synergies with Battenfield. First of all, SW has the polymer manufacturer, second of all, the
same distribution will be used. Aside from that, there is likely G&A overlap.

well .. isn't today's PR misleading?


Last guidance did not include BTI acquisition and was in the 113-118m range


this Guidance is in the 124-126m range .. and does include the BTI acquisition


BTI acquisition was completed on Dec 11, 2014 ... implying 51 days will be consolidated into SWHC Financial
RESULTS.


Assuming $12.5m per quarter BTI revenue (51/92= days consolidated in SWHC Financials) ... it implies that
7m higher guidance was due to the BTI acquisition


so, old buidance (corrected per BTI acquisition) was ... 120-125m.


Today they did give new guidance of 124-126m for Q3 ....


the only thing that did change is that they added the BTI revenue to it. Nothing More. (or .. max 1-2m more)


 
so .. this is a no - event! ...
