PlasmaTech Biopharmaceuticals: Hyped Up... Old 'News'... Going
Down

Summary


PTBI stock jumped on a misunderstood announcement that products received FDA
orphan drug designation. This was misleading because the designation occurred a
year ago and was announced at that time.


Burdened with horrible financials, including a $26 million net loss last year, PTBI
stock has been rising on the orphan "announcement" plus other favorable press.


Three out of the five top institutional investors have been dumping PTBI stock and
two other institutional holders have sold out completely.


PTBI has survived almost solely on private and public stock offerings over 41 years.
As it burns additional cash attempting to advance products, we expect another stock
offering before long.


PlasmaTech Biopharmaceuticals (PTBI) rocketed on "news" that the FDA granted orphan
drug status to its newly acquired gene therapy products.


But PTBI's announcement is simply hype churned out to raise the stock price … which is
exactly what it did.


Why would we claim this is nothing more than a stock-hyping promotion?


The products had already received orphan drug designations - and been announced.


One full year ago.


Here's the headline:


"Abeona Therapeutics Receives U.S. Orphan Drug Designations for treatment of
Sanfilippo Syndromes A and B"


PTBI acquired Abeona on May 15, along with the acquisition's therapy for Sanfilippo
Syndromes A and B. Five days later, PTBI issued its press release making it sound as if it
had just received the US Food and Drug Administration designation for the therapies,
here.

PTBI said FDA granted the designation for PTBI's "lead product candidates for the
treatment of Sanfilippo Syndromes A and B." Orphan drug designation makes it easier to
gain marketing approval to treat a rare medical condition or "orphan disease."


PTBI's new CEO, Tim Miller, Abeona's former CEO, is quoted in both the current and the
1-year-old release.


Indeed, the FDA website shows both experimental drugs, here and here, received "orphan
designation" in May 2014. An FDA spokeswoman noted they are not yet FDA approved
for sale.


As for the Rare Pediatric Disease designation that PTBI says it has also received, a PTBI
corporate presentation suggests Abeona had already received the designation.
Spokeswoman Sandy Walsh said the FDA does not disclose the names of companies that
request or receive this type of designation.


But this is just the beginning of a long list of issues that we believe will soon ground the
PTBI rocket.


While investors may find other viewpoints here, we'll tick off additional reasons we believe
this stock is on the verge of crashing back to earth.


*Promotions: "There's no such thing as bad publicity." Or is there?


PTBI stock has also been hyped recently by promotional firms like Blue Horseshoe
Stocks, here, and posted on associated newsletter sites such as PennyMotion.com here
and other sites.


Seeking Alpha also has published two PTBI articles in the last few weeks, both fairly
bullish and written by the same author.


On May 18, contributor to TheStreet.com touted the Soros investment and the initiation on
a "buy" by H.C. Wainwright.


And HotStocked is yet another business that has trumpeted PTBI.


Investing in companies that must rely on stock promoters to get more eyeballs on their
stock is risky business. Other company investors have taken the advice of promoters,
such as Jonathan Lebed. TheStreetSweeper wrote about the Lebed-promoted Jive in
2012, which ended in disaster for virtually everyone but the Lebed team (JIVE, then ~$24,
now ~$5.55).

*Bad News: Shark Tank's Mr. Wonderful says, "It's all about the moneeeey!"


PTBI last year increased cash by cutting expenses such as its lifeblood - research and
development - and diluting shareholders' stock. Its accounts payable rose and revenue
collapsed.


Here are more details:


Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 % Change


Net Income/Loss $-26.8 m $4.5 m Down 702%


Revenue $ .9 m $2.0 m Down 122%


Accounts payable $ 1.9 m $ .9 m Up 120%


Research & Dev. $ .3 m $ .9 m Down 62%


(Source: SEC filings)


PTBI blames losses on R&D:


"Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development
activities …and from associated administrative costs."


Then PTBI turned around and noted a few pages later that R&D dropped more than half-
a-million bucks!


Indeed, those "associated administrative costs" really mean stock-based compensation
jumped astronomically.


In fact, stock-based compensation nearly tripled.


For their hand in running the company that's now lost $298 million, PTBI folks received
$1.3 million in stock-based compensation.


Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Percent Change


Stock-based comp $1.3 m $0.4 m Up 197%

(Source: SEC filings)


Full compensation is hard to track in PTBI's game of executive musical chairs but new
CEO Miller will receive $350,000 yearly, along with a possible bonus and stock options for
400,000 shares worth around $3.5 million.


Another big player who has sat in several chairs and handled five of PTBI's private stock
offerings through his SCO Securities, is Steven Rouhandeh, executive chairman.


PTBI's filings note this about SCO entities linked to Mr. Rouhandeh: "During 2014 and
2013, SCO and affiliates charged $300,000 each year in investor relations fees."


Mr. Rouhandeh's stock option awards for 2014? Those alone were worth $523,000.


In fact, Mr. Rouhandeh and his SCO entities own over 14 million shares, exceeding a
whopping 65 percent ownership.


*What About Soros?


News on May 5-7 regarding the George Soros disclosure of 1.16 million shares or 5. 17
percent of PTBI evidently prompted some investors to take a chance on the stock,
assisting the rally to $9.


But that stock cost Soros a fraction of what today's retail investor is paying. The Soros
fund's increased position works out to a price of ~$3 per share for one block of 250,000
shares and ~$0.93 per share for the second block, according to the fund's SEC filing.


And the position in PTBI is extremely small.


The Soros fund lists stock held in ~230 companies in the last quarter, records show. The
fund includes many positions of those other companies of 10 million or more shares
accumulated in that timeframe.


Is Soros still holding a position in PTBI now that the stock is about three times or more
than the purchase price?


Fund managers have not yet responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for a comment.
But how long Soros might hold onto PTBI shares is a burning question, particularly
considering the current price and all the institutional types selling PTBI.


*Top Investors Dump PTBI Stock

Three out of PTBI's five biggest institutional investors have begun dumping its stock.
These are Oracle, Sabby and Deerfield.


A total of seven institutional holders have whittled away at their holdings. PTBI's biggest
institutional investor, Oracle, has axed its shares to nearly half the original number. Two
other institutions, Equitec and Messner & Smith, have sold out.

*Stock Offerings: "The Only Thing We Learn From History Is That We Learn Nothing
From History."


Wait a minute - if PTBI's revenue dropped so much, how could compensation possibly
rocket and cash reach $7.9 million?


We can thank the much-pruned money tree of the chronically unprofitable: stock offerings.


Here's how the company has increased its stock offering and debt record in just the past
year:


Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Percent Change

Stock offering/debt


proceeds


$12.7m $ .03m Up 42,233%!


(Source: SEC filings)


So, PTBI has been handing out stocks like one mean dilution machine.


Under the most recent stock transaction, the company acquired Abeona Therapeutics.
This happened, as we mentioned, on May 15 at a price of nearly 4 million common
shares, plus up to another $9 million stock or cash in performance milestones.


Besides at least five private offerings prior to going public on Dec. 18, 2014, PTBI has
been busy pruning the money tree. It has announced a $5 million private placing and a $7
million upsized placement in April, plus a May 6 $10 million private placement of 1.25
million shares.


Interestingly, companies with previous regulatory issues, H.C. Wainwright and Aegis
Capital acted as managers or co-managers for some PTBI stock offerings.


H.C. Wainwright has 14 FINRA disclosure events, while Aegis Capital underwent a
troubling disciplinary proceeding in 2014 alleging suspicious promotional activity and illicit
sales.


*Stock Offering Or Debt Deal Looming


So private and public stock offerings have primarily kept this company afloat through its
inception in Wyoming in 1974 as Chemex Corp., name change to Chemex
Pharmaceuticals in 1983, merger and name change to Access Pharmaceuticals in 1996,
and name change to PlasmaTech Pharmaceuticals and 1-for-50 reverse stock split in
October 2014.


Indeed, the company's filings of May 14 and others say it may need to obtain "additional
financing."


PTBI has been burning through ~$3.2 million per quarter without taking into account any
efforts to advance its products.


During Wednesday's conference call, Mr. Rouhandeh wouldn't offer cash burn guidance
going forward. But he told analysts that they expect about a $10 million expense to get the
Sanfilippo products into Phase 1 clinical trials anticipated at the end of 2015 - of course,
they must proceed through Phase 3.

On top of general administrative costs, the salt diafiltration process for inherited COPD
that PTBI in-licensed last September will take another $5 million to $6 million to get to
market, he said.


Cash infusions such as $17 million private placements and warrants have pushed cash
prior to burn to about $30 million in the second quarter, said Mr. Rouhandeh.


"It's an exciting time at the company," he added.


But, with the stock price this month floating around record highs and cash burning faster
than ever, we're expecting more excitement before too long. At some point, PTBI will likely
need to jump out with an equity raise.


*Conclusion:


So, looking at PTBI's seriously rewarmed, year-old "news" of orphan drug designation
which translates to more big bucks to try to achieve FDA marketing approval - plus the
promotional efforts, the stock offering risk, the name-changing, the institutional selling, the
cash burn and the big compensations - this company's got some issues.


And when we checked out the location PTBI consistently lists as its principal executive
office in suite 517 at 4848 Lemmon Ave. in Dallas, Texas. Here it is:


(Source: Google maps)


Somehow, we find it hard to believe a company with a ~$176-million market valuation is
headquartered here, in a strip retail space shared by a jewelry repair shop and a nail
salon. All considered, this stock deserves to get hammered down to the pre-hype range of
$2.50 to $3.

Really, this puppy has a bit more exercising to do. Check back when it hits $12 and holds. Maybe that's the PO BOX
location....hard to imagine company doing volume of laboratory work they are doing from a store front you post. If they
are I am sure the FDA would want to know about it.

earltp
what is apparent is the "Old News" is the really the substance of your bear raid article on the stock. Institutions are
jockeying here to position for the potential success of the company's new assets, and everyone is entitled to trade the
volatility along the way (even you). Your assertion as to Soros Fund cost basis is incorrect...the 93c cost refers to
warrants from the December placement which, when exercised at 5, would result in a 5.93 basis for the 250k shares,
according to their cost allocation. They increased their position 3x on the recent $3 placement, and if they had
"dumped" all their shares it's not likely the portfolio manager would have been on the May 27th conference call asking
questions.

Well, thank you, Ms. Colberg for your informative article. I think you have showed enough evidences to counter the
optimist arguments from True Alpha's analyst.


Please, if you can and you do not consider that I am trying to take advantage from you, will please make any
comments the other examples of promising penny stocks that Alpha True has listed recently? The following are
among the ones that True Alpha is highlighting as examples of their successful predictions:


Plasma Tech (PTBI or ABEO); Organovo (ONVO); MeetMe (MEET);


Intuitive Surgical (ISRG). Also, what do you think about True Alpha and their "Alpha's Penny Cap Index"?
