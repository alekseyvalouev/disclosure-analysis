Miller Energy: Faulty Reserve Assumptions And Poor Cash Flow
Leave Little Equity Value
Jun. 6, 2013 7:01 PM ET26 comments
by: Forensic Accounter


As previously discussed in the last write-up, Miller's production and development cost
assumptions are far lower than what they've actually experienced, leading to an inflated
PV-10 far higher than the likely value of cash flows that will be produced from the
company's reserves. Recently, there have been a few additional data-points on Miller's
assumed development costs that continue to point towards this conclusion.


Miller announced on 5/20/2013 that they were to begin drilling the Sword #1 well. After a
careful analysis of Miller's reserve and PV-10 disclosures, this decision appears to be
highly questionable, as it implies this is either a gross misallocation of capital by MILL
management or Miller's cost assumptions within their reserve report are inaccurate.


Standardized Measure:


One data point that clearly demonstrates Miller's flawed assumptions underlying their
reserves can be found within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows (on page F-35 of Miller's most recent 10-K). Under "Future development costs",
Miller assumes that it will only cost $75.3 million to develop all their proved reserves. This
figure is for all future periods required for Miller to produce their developed and
undeveloped reserves over several years. However, in the same 10-K, it was disclosed
that for fiscal 2013 alone, Miller had a cap ex budget of $50 to $100 million (page 32 of
10k). This would be a midpoint of $75 million, which means Miller expected to spend in
one year what their reserve report assumes is enough to develop Miller's entire proved
reserve base. Obviously, it will take much more than one year for Miller to develop and
produce their entire proved reserve base, especially considering how consistently they've
failed to meet their own expected development schedule.


As of 4/30/2012, Miller had 9.294 million boe (barrels of oil equivalent) of proved reserves,
of which 6.535 million were undeveloped. Even making the generous assumption that
Miller's currently proved developed reserves will have no future development costs, the
$75.3 million in future expected development costs used in calculating Miller's reserve
present value represents a cost of development of $11.53 per undeveloped barrel of
proved reserves. The Sword property is actually classified as a probable reserve, which
makes the decision to drill it even more puzzling.

On the company's Q3 2013 earnings call, Miller's CEO said that the estimated cost of the
Sword #1 well would be $17 million, with 800,000 barrels of estimated recoverable oil.
This equates to a finding and development cost of at least $21.25 per barrel. If Miller's
proved undeveloped reserves actually do cost $11.53 or less to develop, this expenditure
on Sword appears extremely reckless. The most likely explanation is that the assumed
cost, and therefore. the assumed PV10 values, of Miller's proved reserves are inaccurate.
As further evidence of this conclusion, Miller's reserve report assumes the sword prospect
will have a capital cost of only $10.9 million, almost 40% less than what management now
estimates.


Production Costs Revisited:


As discussed in the previous reports on Miller, the company's actual production costs
experienced has been much higher than what the company uses for assumed production
costs in their reserve report and DCF valuation. As a recap, Miller's standardized measure
in the most recent 10-K, lists "Future production costs and taxes" as $158.9 million. With
total proved reserves of 9.294 million boe, this means that Miller is assuming an average
production cost of $17.10 per barrel when discussing the present value of their reserves.
For fiscal year 2012, and the first nine months of fiscal 2013, total production for MILL was
371,843 and 237,552 boe respectively. Oil and gas operating costs were $14.9 million and
$13.0 million for these time periods, implying production costs of $39.96 and $54.56 per
barrel respectively, which is more than double the production cost assumptions used by
Miller in their discounted present value calculations.


A previous bull article on the company was optimistic that as production grows, production
costs per barrel will fall towards management's assumptions. Unfortunately, the evidence
provided to support this was a quote from management about lifting costs per barrel for a
single month in 2011. Looking at a larger sample size shows no such improvement in
costs coming down with higher production levels. For example, total production increased
26% from 294,157 barrels in fiscal 2011, to 371,843 barrels in fiscal 2012. Despite this,
production increase of 26%, oil and gas operating costs increased by 53% from $9.7
million to $14.9 million over this same time period (from $32.98 per barrel up to $39.96 per
barrel). Looking at the most recently reported three and nine months ending 1/31/2013 is
not as useful, but it is interesting to note that production costs actually continued
increasing despite flat, and negative production for those two time periods respectively.


Given these inaccurate cost assumptions, it increasingly appears that the large PV-10
value used by Miller to convince investors that their shares are undervalued is an illusion.

Debt Service:


The likeliest motive for the company's exaggerated reserve assumptions is the company's
increasingly poor financial performance and desperate need for expensive capital.


Miller's $55 million credit facility has an interest rate of 18%, representing interest expense
of $9.9 million annually should they borrow the remaining $10 million available (MILL is
required under their latest loan agreement to request the remaining $10 million or pay an
unused fee of $2 million). Including preferred dividends would take total annual interest
and dividend payments on outstanding debt and preferred shares to over $15 million
annually. Miller's trailing twelve month cash from operations as of 1/31/2013 was $3.7
million, and adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 million, both of which are a fraction of these
annual debt and preferred obligations. All of this is before taking into consideration the
company's trailing twelve month cap ex over $20 million, expensive long term capital
development needs (which the $17 million Sword prospect is now a part of), and negative
current working capital. In fact, accounts payable have nearly doubled over the last year
from $9.9 million as of 1/31/2012 to $18.6 million as of 1/31/2013. Without this $8.7 million
increase, trailing twelve month cash from operations would have been negative.


Even using heroic assumptions about future cash flow growth, it is unlikely Miller
operations can service their debt and dividend obligations, much less additional
exploration cap ex. This leaves them dependent upon constant sales of preferred shares
in order to simply service their debt and pay preferred dividends (using the principal raised
from new preferred stock sold to pay current dividend investors). Considering this, along
with the fact that the company has had to continually operate under waivers from their
creditors for missing financial and production covenants, it is difficult to see any value in
the common or preferred stock of Miller Energy.

opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any

Seldom read an SA article that is so far off base as this one. MILL is a company that has made major turn-around
efforts, most of which were ignored, or unknown, to the author. For example, MILL is about to receive a check for ≈
$17,000,000 from State of AK......under it's drilling rebate program...which is public information! Yet author does
accounting back flips to show MILL has cash flow issues...but ignores $17 Million rebate? And that's just a little of
what the author missed! Gotta ask yourself.....what's really the point of this article? Hmmm, I think I know, a SHORT
who's losing sleep at night! LOL!

Question... The company has stated that RU2 has a PV10 of $59M and 3rd party reserves of 949K. That means that
it has a PV10 of $62 per barrel. How can this be? The best wells in the eagleford have PV10/barrel that is a fraction of
that figure.

CHAZAGE_ON_SA
A lot of excellent info in MILL's latest 10-Q, filed 3/12/13....you can access that from MILL's Yahoo Board
under "SEC Filings."

The key is that the reserve estimates were done by a third party with 30 years experience in the business, and if this
author had any investigation experience at all, he would have called up the people doing the estimates and checked
with them because they have one heck of a good reputation. Especially before printing an article as amateur as this
one.


The second thing is that Miller keeps qualifying for Alaska Tax rebates and they reduce the cost of most qualifying
projects 40%. The author failed to distinguish between gross cost and net after tax cost. In fact he may well be
purposely mixing them up when he thinks it is to his advantage.


The company is still speculative and of course may not make it, but if it does fail, it won't be for the reasons in this
article, as this author clearly does not have a clue.

Just because you say they have a good reputation doesn't mean it's true. Go take a look at their client list on
their web site. It's a veritable who's who of dodgey, fly-by-night, oil and gas companies.


Heck, the word "Enron" shows up four times.

Also the company's financial performance is more than satisfactory. The author fails to distinguish between current
expenses to produce the oil and investments made to expand the business in the future through restoration, and/or
drilling.


He needs a segmented income statement before he can talk about financial performance.

The SEC requires that people writing publicly about stocks disclose their financial interests in those securities. Who is

Now that RU-2 has come online, you may want to update your figures, especially once the new reserve estimates for
the well are available. That would be balanced and responsible journalism

Very good paper again on Mill. 
The costs of production don't stop their increase, the financial costs the same, and the production is not really
increasing as promised since so many years, ... MILL is mainly a champion to increase the number of shares, from 36
112 286 in 2011 to 43 446 694 in 2013, mean 20.31%, to increase the losses per share despite the big increasing of
their number : losses/share increased from $ 0.48 in 2012 to $ 0.60 for 2013, mean 25.00% !

Take a look at the comp increases these boys just awarded themselves-they are playing the age-old game of paying
off the board handsomely and then benefiting via comp and perks: 
amended Form 10-K: 
see http://bit.ly/1ceIf6C


Not sure if these guys need a company airplane-for a company this size (I know company hqtrs in TN, ops in AL but
their G & A expenses are off the scale);


Not yet short but getting closer-their op costs are huge and they keep reporting losses-cannot see how they can make
any money.

Interesting activity today. Proxy filed by group of large shareholders to replace board, taking aim at coziness
with executive management. Excessive compensation, lining pockets, shareholder dilution, G&A expenses,
etc.

Short-term, that's never a good thing. Longer term, it's a different matter. The problem is that Miller has
property it needs to drill, and dealing with a proxy challenge will distract from that drilling activity.


17 Dec 2013, 04:31 PM 


threeleaves
The part of the proxy that has me interested is this:


"Worse still, Miller has issued grants to its underperforming executives so that as of July 5, 2013, there were
outstanding options and warrants to purchase up to 14,503,847 shares at an exercise price between $0.01 and $6.94
per share. If these warrants and options are exercised, total shares would increase by 30%. . . . This effectively
means that the shareholders’ loss of value from such a massive dilution and decrease in voting power will be directly
offset by an increase in the management’s and directors’ control. We note the curious fact that by our estimate if the
management team were to exercise all their awarded options the aggregate ownership of all insiders will amount to
approximately 51% of the voting power of all outstanding Miller shares."


So . . . given the above statement in the proxy, can anyone here give some likely scenarios of how this plays out?

It's a three syllable word rhyming with "pollution" and starting with a "d", never mind the issue of voting
control. Of course, one might argue that having that much insider ownership would be good. But then there's
that funky dilution factor again.

Six months later, cash flow up nicely, reserves shooting to the sky and yes, a nice acquisition. Obviously your
investigative reporting has some work to do.


There is still a proxy battle


And Oh yes, this week Miller reported a profit. Wonder how that happened??


With three new well updates to happen in the near future, this is looking quite good and you are discredited
thoroughly.


Maybe the dilution is a little much, and yes the people who brought CIE to Miller probably should have done the
options completely at the time of purchase and disclosed everything, but that division has made Miller and taken them
from a company that was under water to where they are now. The company is better off with those people than
without them and doing the options initally would have cost the company far more, but with far fewer complaints.


But then again, balanced reporting is not your strong point.
