LiveDeal: 50% Downside Possible In This Promoted Stock
Jan. 28, 2014 2:53 PM ET71 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


LiveDeal, Inc (NASDAQ:LIVE) is a low float stock that has raced higher due to recent
promotions. It is up 500% YTD and was up 35% on Friday alone. I think at these levels if
you can get shares to short and are able to tolerate volatility, a short should be very
profitable over the next 3-6 months.


Overview


From the most recent 10-K;


LiveDeal, Inc., provides specialized online marketing solutions to small-to-
medium sized local businesses, or SMBs, that boost customer awareness and
merchant visibility . We offer affordable tools for SMBs to extend their
marketing reach to relevant prospective customers via the internet. We also
provide SMBs promotional marketing with the ability to offer special deals and
activities through LiveDeal.com and our online publishing partners.


It has been described as similar to Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). It's not exactly the same,
but it's pretty close. However LiveDeal currently only operates in San Diego, Los Angeles,
and San Francisco counties. Unlike Groupon, LiveDeal does real time deals. LiveDeal has
been around for some time in one form or another.


We were originally incorporated in Nevada in 1996 as Renaissance Center,
Inc. We started in the online marketing industry with YP.com, which had
introduced the print yellow pages to the internet. We moved into the online
classifieds business when we acquired LiveDeal, Inc., a California corporation,
in June 2007, and changed our corporate name to LiveDeal, Inc. in August
2007.


Despite being pretty early on one big trend (the shift from paper Yellow Pages to online),
this doesn't mean that they are right again. Here is why LiveDeal, Inc is a screaming short.

Who Is Promoting This Stock?


It's not a question of if, LiveDeal is certainly being promoted. Over the past week I have
heard several ads on the CNBC radio channel on SiriusXM. The ads compare LiveDeal to
Groupon and say that its low float will cause it to be the next stock to really take off. And
take off it has, going from $3/ share to $21.50/ share in the course of a month. The claims
by the promoters and advertisers are causing this increase, and when you throw in the low
float you get a recipe for large and volatile moves. The company has also issued a steady
stream of press releases. In the last month alone 9 press releases have been sent out.


Source: Yahoo Finance


These press releases come from a firm called "Stock Market Media Group" or "SMMG."
On the bottom of these press releases we see this disclaimer.


SMMG is a full service IR firm specializing in Research and Content
Development. It offers a platform for corporate stories to unfold through the
media with Reports, Interviews and Articles. For more information and to read
disclaimers and disclosures: www.stockmarketmediagroup.com. This report is
the opinion of SMMG and was written based upon publicly available
information. LiveDeal, Inc. hasn't endorsed or compensated SMMG for this
report.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1973861-livedeal-50-percent-downside-possible-in-this-promoted-stock 3/22


Apparently LiveDeal hasn't compensated SMMG for this report, and while this may be
true, somebody with an interest in this stock going up has been compensating SMMG.
According to their website SMMG charges the following prices for their services.


Source: Social Market Media Group


SMMG has published one research report and distributed many press releases through
Marketwired. In what is perhaps the most vague and two-faced disclaimer I have ever
read, SMMG says that they have been compensated $2,500 for services by a "third party
bank wire."


Stock Market Media Group was compensated up to two-thousand five hundred
dollars for the research, writing, production, and release of our update Report
on LIVE by a third-party via bank wire.


So while we know that LiveDeal hasn't compensated SMMG on this report, somebody
clearly is. In an effort to figure out who is working for Stock Market Media Group I
attempted to find the articles of incorporation. All states allow you to search for these and
it's totally free. Since the number listed on the SMMG website is a "646" number, I started
looking in New York state. No companies with the name "Stock Market Media Group" have
been registered in NY. Fine, perhaps they incorporated in Delaware or Connecticut, no
dice there either. I ended up checking every single state for a corporation called "Stock
Market Media Group" and was able to find none. They do not call themselves "Stock
Market Media Group, LLC" on their website because they are not an incorporated
company. Is this a bad sign, I don't know, but it is a red flag. I'm assuming that SMMG is
the company behind the ads appearing on CNBC.

Who Is Auditing This Company?


According to the most recent 10-K LiveDeal is audited by "Kabani and Company."
Unfortunately Kabani & Co. has been cited by the PCAOB for 10 deficiencies in audits
performed in 2011. Some of the deficiencies that stood out to me were


(3) the failure to perform sufficient procedures to evaluate transactions with related
parties
(7) the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test revenue
(10) the failure, in four audits, to perform sufficient procedures to test amounts
reported in statements of cash flows.


While these deficiencies were cited several years ago, it is still a red flag to potential
investors. I'm not suggesting that Kabani & Co. is incompetent as they did say that
LiveDeal was a "going concern," which should be yet another red flag.


Where Is The Company?


LiveDeal, Inc is located at 6240 McLeod Drive Suite 120 in Las Vegas, Nevada. However
no mention of LiveDeal appears on the marquee. Not to say that it's not located there, but
strange that a $80 million market cap company has no sign on the marquee of its office
space.

Valuation and Is it Groupon?


I don't think of Groupon as a particularly good company, but I recognize that others think it
has a place in consumer spending. LiveDeal has been aggressively compared Groupon in
press releases and SMMG report. But it is not even close to being Groupon, and yet it is
valued much more richly than it.


Source: SEC filings


Neither companies are profitable, so traditional valuation metrics are not applicable, but
these should give you an idea of how overvalued LiveDeal is compared to Groupon. If
Groupon which is relatively established and has had time to work out the kinks in a similar
business model and still isn't profitable what makes you think that LiveDeal can do it. A

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1973861-livedeal-50-percent-downside-possible-in-this-promoted-stock 6/22


LiveDeal's bull's response would be that "Amazon isn't profitable, Tesla isn't profitable!"
That is because those companies have explicitly said that they are not targeting
profitability.


Two Years Later, How Are The Goals Working?


In the press release issued when CEO Jon Isaac took over these were the goals he laid
out.


My plan is to focus on increasing sales of LiveDeal's existing product lines,
while developing new products and reducing overall expenses. With this new
plan, the company can possibly achieve a turnaround to profitability within a
short period of time. I hope that my fellow shareholders will share in my
excitement for the next chapter of LiveDeal, Inc."


He said that a return to profitability in a short time frame was one of his main goals. I don't
see how this is possible given that LiveDeal is trying to expand nationwide. Groupon is
already nationwide and still isn't profitable. So how has he done on his other goals (the
goals were stated on January 24th, 2012, almost exactly 2 years to the date)


Reduce Overall Expenses


General and Administrative expenses are up 25% and sales and marketing expenses are
up 378%, suggesting that LiveDeal is unable to expand while also lowering costs.


Increase Sales of Existing Product Lines, While Developing New Products


Revenues fell 23%, so that didn't work out. But also important is that LiveDeal lost
revenue from existing product lines.


Net revenues in fiscal 2013 decreased by $718,635, as compared to fiscal
2012, primarily due to the end of LEC billing, which resulted in a
decrease of approximately $1.2 million, which was partially offset by
increases in revenue of approximately $500,000 from the Company's online
marketing product.

Return to Profitability


Source: All above images are sourced from company filings


Operating losses have increased 189% over the last year; another goal that hasn't played
out.


CEO Pay


In that same press release it was announced that the new CEO would be taking a salary
of just $1.00.


"As a measure of my confidence in LiveDeal and its significant growth
potential, I have agreed to a take a salary of $1.00 per year," commented Mr.
Isaac. "As a fellow shareholder in the Company, I have a vested interest in
driving the success of the Company. My primary goal is to achieve profitability
and increase shareholder value. It's not uncommon to see things like this when
a CEO wants to express confidence in the future of a company.


On January 13, 2012, our Board of Directors appointed Jon Isaac to serve as
our President and Chief Executive Officer. At the time, the Company did not
enter into a written Employment Agreement with Mr. Isaac, but he was paid an
annual salary of $1 for his services and was eligible to receive bonuses in such
forms and amounts as determined by the Company's Compensation
Committee. On February 14, 2013, the Company entered into a written
Employment Agreement with Jon Isaac, pursuant to which he will continue
serving as our President and Chief Executive Officer for the period from
January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2016. The material terms of the Employment
Agreement are as follows:


•$200,000 annual base salary throughout the term of the Employment
Agreement.


• A one-time discretionary bonus of $150,000 for services performed as
President and Chief Executive Officer for the previous 12 months, to be paid in
cash on or before March 31, 2013. This bonus was approved by the
Company's Compensation Committee.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1973861-livedeal-50-percent-downside-possible-in-this-promoted-stock 8/22


The CEO was paid a bonus of $150,000 for the services of his first year, effectively
bringing his 2012 compensation up to $150,001. The pay is still pretty low by CEO
standards but it is representative of saying one thing and then doing another. He is also
being compensated for reasonable housing costs.


Shelf Registration


On January 8th LiveDeal announced the registration of 660,000 shares of common stock
for sale.


We have entered into an engagement agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC
relating to the sale of shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus supplement
and the accompanying prospectus. In accordance with the terms of the engagement
agreement, we may offer and sell up to a maximum aggregate amount of 660,000 shares
of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, from time to time through Chardan,
acting as agent.


Given that the publicly traded float is only ~ 1.34 million shares the sale of these shares
will significantly increased the float by around 50%.


On January 9, 2014, we delivered a placement notice to Chardan to sell 12,200 shares of
our common stock as part of the at-the-market offering. The shares were sold for
approximately $8.93 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $109,000.
Net proceeds to us, after payment of Chardan's 3% commission was approximately
$106,000.


Just a couple of weeks ago insiders were happy to sell the stock at $8.93/ share. It
currently trades at $22/ share. There are a lot more shares just waiting to be sold.


Isaac Organization And Regulatory Issues


On January of 2012 Isaac Organization also known as Isaac Capital Group, run by
LiveDeal CEO Jon Isaac, acquired a stake in Legent Clearing, LLC. In September of 2012
Legent Clearing changed its name to Cor Clearing LLC. Then in December of 2013
FINRA fined Cor Clearing $1 million for "numerous failures to comply with anti-money
laundering, financial reporting, and regulatory supervision."


Brad Bennett, Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, "COR's history of
multiple violations in these key compliance areas resulted from its weak culture of
compliance. This is particularly troubling given the amount of deposits and sales of low-

priced securities through COR's introducing firms - a major area of concern for FINRA.
Because COR is a clearing firm, its role as a gatekeeper to the securities markets makes
it imperative that the firm meet its critical supervisory and internal control obligations."


COR provides clearing services for approximately 86 correspondent firms through fully
disclosed clearing arrangements. As a clearing firm, COR performs order processing,
settlement and record keeping functions for introducing broker-dealers that do not
maintain back-office facilities to perform these functions. It services introducing firms with
significant numbers of accounts, conducting activity in low-priced securities, as well as
third-party wire activity.


In its 2013 examination letter, FINRA identified microcap fraud and anti-money laundering
compliance as regulatory priorities that it would focus on throughout the year because of
the risk they pose to investor protection and market integrity. FINRA specified the
importance that firms monitor customer accounts liquidating microcap and low-priced OTC
securities to ensure, among other things, that the firm is not facilitating, enabling or
participating in an unregistered distribution. FINRA found that COR's AML surveillance
program did not reasonably address the risks of its business model. These types of
accounts present a higher risk of money laundering and other fraudulent activity. In
addition, many of these correspondent firms had been the subject of past disciplinary
action for AML-related rule violations. Notwithstanding the heightened AML risk, FINRA
found that COR's surveillance program failed to identify "red flags" related to its
correspondent firms and transactions by their customers.


Particularly troubling were the statements regarding low-priced securities.


So What Is LiveDeal Worth?


I do not think that LiveDeal should be valued more richly than Groupon. Groupon has
intellectual property to back up its service. LiveDeal has none and a much more specific
target market than Groupon does. However if we apply a 3x P/S multiple to LiveDeal
(which is what Groupon trades at) we would get LIVE trading at $2.25/ share. This
represents 83% downside. I believe it will eventually trade in this range. A more realistic
valuation would be around $9/ share where insiders were willing to sell in the shelf
registration just a few weeks ago. This represents around 55% downside. I think this is
reasonable and realistic over the next 3-6 months. This stock has been driven up by a low
float and promotion. While there is nothing wrong with momentum being behind a stock
the low float argument will soon be negated when all the shares are sold increasing the
publicly traded float by around 50%. Those reasons are why I believe that the stock

should fall by between 50-75% over the next 3-6 months. Eventually you can't justify the
fundamentals of a stock price just because it has a low float and an ad you heard on
CNBC Radio.


Summary


With a lot of publicity from a sketchy company and a low float, this stock was a recipe to
explode higher. That move should be over now, however, and this stock will eventually fall.
When it does fall, it will fall hard. It's a fairly tough borrow to find, but there are currently
shares available to short. If you can justify the current valuation with the red flags, then
more power to you. But I can't, and I think it is a short at $21/ share.


Note: I have contacted the company about my concerns and not yet received a response.
I will provide an update when I receive a response. If you have any information regarding
Stock Market Media Group or any ads you've heard feel free to contact me.


Disclosure: I am short LIVE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I suspect that they gave the marketing group a ton of stock to get them to go out and promote it. I am
somewhat shocked that this is legal. I've taken a tiny short position as the promotion could work for awhile
(and the borrow is high). But I think this is worth about $0. Let me double check my model...yeah about $0.

Good points on the IP guys. No barrier to entry for LIVE and no protective covenants to their entire model.


Yes Groupon I believe does have some IP and so doesn't Spindle "SPDL" which IP Hawk previously pointed
out in his well done article.


Patent Portfolio


"Spindle's platform is well protected with four issued patents, with the key patent being 5,822,737 Financial
Transaction System. The patent has a priority date of 1996 and has been cited by 140 other financial patents.
The patent portfolio grants the necessary protection as a defense in the competitive mobile payment space. I
believe that Spindle will file additional continuation patents and brand new inventions in 2014 to further
protect the Spindle and MeNetwork platform."

Congratulations on a finely written article. These stock promoters are never going away. It's a sad, but true
component of the stock market experience. When a stock is traded as a commodity (and not on fundamentals), it's
never healthy.

Your bashing is just as bad as the promoters..After you establish your short position you write negative article.Very
similar to what CAMT bashers did ...and that stock is fine closing in on $6 but the bad articles got it all they way down
to 3.38.So congrats to you- go cover your short make your money and move on. 3 weeks from now LIVE will be $10
-15 after the split. and You can re-short it and bash it again.

5/18/2018 LiveDeal: 50% Downside Possible In This Promoted Stock - Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1973861-livedeal-50-percent-downside-possible-in-this-promoted-stock 15/22


Good article. This is a classic example of how the common average shareholder has to be very careful and know why
a particular stock is going up. It's companies like these that end up hurting all the other smaller companies who are
trying to actually build real and sustainable value versus just paying some promoter to blatantly hype your stock. This
is a classic example of a company regulators should be looking at and holding management accountable for their
actions.

The management of LIVE is great for self promotion on their website (http://www.isaac.com) but cannot tell you of any
success they've achieved. How can any respectable investment company NOT tout their achievements in order to
retain current clients and attract new ones.


Yet over the years Isaac has nothing to say, and currently has nothing to say in response to this article.

you should look at the their deals...many are just taken from the restaurant's website. Call the restaurants and they
have never heard of Livedeal. I did that a few days ago. Photos from food are not from the restaurant either. Very
easy to figure this out. Reminds me of Spongetech.

I researched LIVE and came to the same basic conclusion – OVERPRICED. It should also be noted that they actually
have 10 million common shares and not the 3.79 million being reported by yahoo finance. This will change to 30
million after the split.


"The forward stock split will be effected on NASDAQ at the open of trading on February 12, 2014. In connection with
the forward stock split, the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock will also increase from 10,000,000 shares
to 30,000,000 shares."


http://bit.ly/MrlMut


The disclaimer at SMMG also says:


Stock Market Media Group may receive compensation and its employees and affiliates may own stock that they have
purchased in the open market either prior, during, or after the release of the companies profiled which is an inherent
conflict of interest in Stock Market Media Group statements and opinions and such statements and opinions cannot
be considered independent.


The Notes and the Contingent Warrants are mentioned 89 times and next to impossible to understand.


In spite of all this negativity and hype, the software business model of a restaurant manager sending out discount
emails anytime they get slow to potential customers is a concept I love.


Good Job Mr. Drose

Authorized shares will be 30 mill -not outstanding . Float will be like 3 million and 11 -12 mill out standing after
split .Wow you guys really play off each other.


28 Jan 2014, 05:50 PM


R.J. Chopin, Contributor
The “authorized shares” will mysteriously appear in the outstanding shares as the hokus pokus continues and
the Notes and Warrants are converted to common shares. Investors need to understand that these guys
previously did two 1 for 10 reverse splits so they could manipulate the price and avoid delisting. About a
month ago (pre-split adjusted) you were looking at a $0.16 penny stock – but I still like the software and its
potential in the right hands. The company has no funding to execute on the software concept.

Thanks for a very informative write-up.  
Few days ago, TD Ameritrade CEO was on IBD front page (Investors Business Daily) talking about how retail
investors are back. Market in general needs to weed out such stocks and price discovery can take months. Stocks
such as LIVE and numerous others are very volatile and dangerous for individual investors, more so, it is gaps up or
down. Without traded options this is suitable only for a day-trade, no overnight positions.

I interviewed this LiveDeal CEO Jon Isaac for about 45 minutes a few months ago when LIVE was about $2.00 
I was pretty skeptical before the interview but after the interview I was completely skeptical. I couldn’t get a clear
answer as to how many people they employ to sell ads. 
By the vague answers, I was left with the impression that:  
1. The website is full of “ads” or offers that the restaurants offer as a normal part of their daily specials, happy hour
etc. It left me wondering if they had agreements for compensation from ANY of the companies on there - or – if they
were trying to make a website that would cause investors to ASSUME that they had agreements with most of these
companies – without claiming such. 
2. It could be free advertising (probably worth the price of admission so to speak) for the business listed on there.
What local retailer is going to tell people, “no, you may not tell your readers about our regular specials”? 
My impression is that the stock is the product and downside potential would be more like 98%-100%. 
I did not do anymore research after that and have no interest long or short in LIVE. I happened upon this article
because it came in above the headlines at Marketwatch over my column regarding GRPN syndicated today.


28 Jan 2014, 06:35 PM


kurtogden
Please due your own diligence and actually use the product and you will see there is no deal to be had. You will find
out the links between Isaac and Legent to Cor and will find the FINRA violations and money laundering issues. Read
the SEC filings and how they may use proceeds for derivative trading and not growing the business. The directors on
the board are jumping ship. Why would you be jumping ship if everything was hunky dory? Especially with all the
potential markets these articles write about?

I 100% agree with your assessment and have made money on this garbage train luckily both ways! I bought in at $10
a week ago and sold at $14 which even then I knew was a crazy risk! I was beyond myself when the stock hit $25 !!!
So last night after hours I took a gamble and shorted 3000 shares . I wish your article came out earlier today as I
shorted at $23.60 and bought back at $20!!!! If only you published this earlier !!! My main concern now is whether to
short it again. I have scene a crap stock just like this go from $2 to $19 in a month off of speculative announcements
under yahoo finance. With all the facts as you have proven and displayed isn't there still a great risk for a MM or
another hype article to drive up the PPS?


29 Jan 2014, 12:02 AM


jpc170
If you think Chris was the reason the stock plummeted today , then why didn't the article from Marketwire released
this morning drive the stock way up!?!? Their article posted LIVE in a positive light yet the stock was down today since
the market opened! I was waiting for this stock to level out as I had my eyes on it for the past week to short as I am
sure many others who bought LIVE were seeing how high this could climb in a month before dumping. I was originally
a share holder, made 30% gains and sold. What do you believe warranted the stock to have a $25 PPS or higher
other then speculative articles. This stock is an unfortunate example of how a MM can manipulate a stock in either
direction at the cost of many investors like you and I! At any point an MM can either drive this stock to $2 or $100!

streetview image because it certainly calls in to question the validity of the company which was your intent (in
my opinion) but I think it was irresponsible on your part to not disclose that the image was in fact from almost
three years ago. Were they there at that time? I don't know, but that is not the point. You presented it as if it
was current, it was not. Anything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, people were willing to pay
20-25 dollars for LIVE. In this day and age of instant information and instant gratification almost nothing is as
it seams but rather as it is perceived to be. You wield a mighty sword, I would assume you use it for your own
benefit rather than mine. Good for you. Carry on.

Chris - Great article. I was pretty sure it was a scam before your article, and you filled in the gaps. Just one small
error. A going concern opinion means that the auditors are doubtful the company will survive 12 months. A GCO is
actually the opposite of what it sounds like.


If a weak bunch of auditors give a GCO, it is even worse than if PwC did. And it does take some courage for a CPA
firm to issue a GCO. It makes this pump and dump almost a comedy.


Great job!

I really wasn't surprised when things all started to fall yesterday, and I agree with a lot of the article as written, but I am
a sucker I guess because I still believe this company has something that could make them the next HUGE thing in
Social Media.


I know that for some reason they compare themselves to Groupon and so does everyone else, but they are so
different from Groupon that I don't know why they went down that road.


From the research I did before buying, I saw that they were offering their deal platform to restaurants for free and also
had some premium listing space that restaurants could purchased. What I like is that restaurants themselves are
using the deal platform to create their own deals! I don't know if you get the implications of this.


Are they making a lot of money off of restaurants? Probably not. 
Are they going to be profitable this year? I doubt it.


But what they will do is create a marketplace where businesses can offer their "lunch specials" and reach a mass
market very similar to what Craigslist did for people wanting to sell items.

Facebook before becoming public, and before even advertising was valued in the billions. Why? Because it brought
together hundreds of millions of 'potential' customers.


So now here comes Live Deal. Compare it to Groupon and ya, its no big deal. Really won't create a huge amount of
income in the short term and even I'm turned off by the self promotion the company is doing instead of just letting the
story play out.


But if they can do what no other company has been able to do and get a decent percentage of vendors to actually
start using social media, then the potential is endless! Not just restaurants, but every vendor selling to consumers!


The Craigslist or Alibaba for local vendors!


So I guess my take is bit different. I really wasn't surprised by the massive fluctuations on the stock. The price really
was getting high for where the company is right now. But I totally believe in the direction of the company and that's
why I will be LONG on Live Deal.

There are already companies far more established and competent in this space. Their almost laughable press release
touted 1000 restaurant locations as you know.


Another company that has been written about called Spindle "SPDL" has 95,000 merchant locations, this compared to
1000 that LIVE has touted. In fact, a well regarded and followed poster "IP HAWK" who made a comment in this very
thread wrote a nice article on Spindle a few months back. http://bit.ly/1b7XmeV 
Here's another article on Spindle talking about them and Square, http://bit.ly/1b7XmeW, which spells out the value
proposition in great detail versus the paid for hype and manipulative jargon employed by LIVE's management.


Stick with quality companies with quality management. LIVE is neither nor has neither in my educated opinion.

Obviously a pump, but to what end? To simply dump, to float more shares or both. When my shorts were called in, I
thought this might be an old fashioned short squeeze operation. Certainly a risk with such a low float. Longs are
guaranteed losers, but shorts need to be careful.

The recent press release about website traffic surging is very misleading - Look at websitetrafficspy and you will get
696 visitors per day for their website vs. groupon which has more than half a million per day. Whats missing is how
long people stayed on the site and how many were new (unique visitors) vs repeat visitors - More importantly they did
not include what the increase was from .


I also looked at the quality of their site vs groupon using a tool at gtmetrix, which tells you the quality of the coding -
Groupon is ranked an A and live is ranked a F (meaning they are not doing a good job coding).
