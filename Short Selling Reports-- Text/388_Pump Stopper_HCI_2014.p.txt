Is HCI Group's Impending EPS Drop The Beginning Of A 75% Decline?
May 1, 2014 2:17 PM ET56 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Q1 2014 should be HCI’s first quarter with significant YOY EPS decline and is likely
the start of a 75%+ drop in earnings.


Previous high profits were based on a temporary benefit that has already ceased in
Jan 2014 with regulatory change.


HCI has the highest P/B valuation of any insurance company in the entire stock
market.


We are suspicious of astronomical management and board compensation.


One hurricane could wipe out shareholders given the high debt load and weak
reinsurance program involving related parties.


A Story of Fortune and Impending Disaster:


Say you move into an old house and rummaging through the basement, you find 6 famous
Picasso paintings worth $1mm each, wow, fortune! Now say you form a company selling
these paintings, ramping up each year:


2011, 1 painting sold - income: $1mm
2012, 2 paintings sold - income: $2mm
2013, 3 paintings sold - income: $3mm


Wow it's a growth company! Maybe the stock of this company trades at a market cap of
$21mm or ONLY 7X last year's $3mm income! So cheap: low multiple WITH growth in this
environment: BUY BUY BUY say the stock salesmen!

But Today, the Basement is Out of Paintings...


HCI Group Inc. (NYSE:HCI): About To Experience Extreme Earnings Headwinds


THE FLORIDA HURRICANE INSURANCE MARKET


Every once in a while there is a big hurricane in Florida and a lot of houses get knocked
down and insurance companies go bankrupt. Rather than letting its people go homeless,
Florida a long time ago set up a state-run insurance company called Citizens that would
absorb the policies of these failed insurance companies and the taxpayer would foot the
bill. It has roughly 25% market share of the homeowners insurance in the state, by far the
largest provider - the other large insurance companies like State Farm left because they
didn't think it would be profitable to do business over the long run.


HCI FOUND SOME PAINTINGS, THEY ARE ALL GONE NOW


HCI was created by very clever people that realized they could "take-out" policies from
Citizens and become the insurer for thousands of customers all at once rather than the
expensive way of knocking door to door selling or advertising. Over the last 3 years, they
pioneered the approach of cherry-picking the most profitable policies from Citizens
(effectively transferring the highly profitable policies from the taxpayers to HCI
shareholders). Citizens was OK with this arrangement because they are a government
agency and were run by government bureaucrats, not typically a shrewd profit-maximizing
group. By taking-out these juicy policies, HCI boosted its profits enormously and
metaphorically "sold the paintings" that it kept rummaging out of Citizens basement.


A NEW SHERIFF AT CITIZENS TURNS THINGS UPSIDE DOWN


In 2013, Citizens hired a new Chief, Barry Gilway who has been called an "insurance
industry dynamo" and promised to shrink Citizens and reduce the burden on the taxpayers
of Florida. He has been hard at work: first in August 2013 he created a competitive bid to
take out a huge chunk of 400,000 policies (~1/3 of the total) across 10 companies. This

meant no more cherry-picking the best policies, they were given away wholesale. The nail
in the coffin though is the creation of a clearinghouse so every single policy will be
competitively bid for and treated as a commodity. No cherry-picking the best policies ever
again, ever (they spent $45mm building the system to make sure each one would be bid
competitively).


This is not going to happen - THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED - IT STARTED JAN 27,
2014.


HCI APPEARS TO BE THE MOST HIGHLY VALUED INSURANCE COMPANY AND
EPS COULD NORMALIZE DOWN -75% OR WORSE


Banks and insurance companies are inherently in the most commodity product of all:
money. Without some structural advantage like a better brand, service, or sales channel,
most financial companies earn average returns on equity - around 10%. Unlike Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a financial company's capital base IS the
engine to generate the earnings so book value is important and a single year's earnings
are meaningless to valuation.


HCI Trades today at 2.7X Price / Book Value vs. the industry average of around 1.0X
P/BV. The industry is growing slowly, in line with GDP and I believe HCI is about to start
shrinking given it now cannot easily acquire and grow its policy count and attrition will
decrease it.


Normalized earnings for HCI on its $160mm of equity would be 10% ROE * $160mm
equity = $16mm per year net income (over 11mm shares) = $1.45 EPS - DOWN 75% from
$5.63/share in 2013.


Even the best insurance companies in the world like Progressive (NYSE:PGR) or GEICO
[now part of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B)] that are growing rapidly
and have deep competitive advantages trade for a lower valuation than HCI. HCI would
have to drop by 20% to $31/share just to have the same 2.2x P/BV valuation as
Progressive!


COMPENSATION IS ASTRONOMICAL FOR BOARD AND MANAGEMENT


HCI insiders were clearly intelligent enough to capitalize on this take-out opportunity and
are now intelligent enough to milk it while they can. According to the proxy filed April 25,
2014, The CEO was compensated $15 Million in 2013! More atypically - the board of
directors (who set the CEO's compensation) each received nearly $900,000 each in

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2182673-is-hci-groups-impending-eps-drop-the-beginning-of-a-75-percent-decline 4/20


compensation, approximately 10 times higher than the average similarly sized company! I
have never seen directors receiving (multiple) BONUS payments? Why do the board
members deserve ~$900k each?!


CEO INCENTIVE PLAN IS BASED ON EARNINGS DECLINING -41% IN 2014


In 2013, HCI had EBIT of $106.5mm according to CapIQ. According to a January 8-K
filing, the CEO's incentive compensation target is for the earnings to grow by MINUS 41%
in 2014 vs. 2013:


The company…must have earnings before interest and the provision for income
taxes of at least $62.5 million, a -41% decline!


If that performance goal is met, Mr. Patel will qualify for a cash bonus equal to 3.25%
of EBIT


COULD ONE HURRICAINE WIPE OUT SHAREHOLDERS?


Insurance is taking cash now for a future promise that you must deliver on or someone will
be out of a home. Right now HCI has the lowest loss ratio (% of payout vs. % premiums
collected) of ANY public insurance company in the industry at 27.8% - vs. 50-60% being
typical. How does HCI manage to insure people that so rarely make claims?


Do they know how to sell flood insurance only to people at the tops of mountains? NO -
they are just taking extreme risks by being concentrated and I believe under-reinsuring the
risk (which increases costs). AM Best, the "Moody's" of insurance ratings, won't even give
HCI a rating and Weiss Ratings gives HCI a "D" for significant weakness that could
negatively impact shareholders.


I called HCI numerous time and left my phone number over the past few weeks trying to
get their insight on these topics, as each one appears to be to be potentially "catastrophic"
to HCI's earnings. Unfortunately they never returned my calls or emails so hopefully they
can address these risks on the upcoming earnings conference call in a transparent
manner.


Additionally, we question a number of significant risks:


1. Is HCI's reinsurance capacity adequate given the lack of risk-waterfall disclosure for
related party Moksha Re, formed by HCI's CEO and SVP?


2. Why is HCI investing in Florida waterfront real estate which has highly correlated risks
to the insurance business? Won't a storm concurrently damage both businesses,

3. Why has HCI taken on so much debt - $126 million (vs. $160mm equity) as of the last


filing - while keeping such a high cash balance and not investing it?

I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company

There have been insider buys in Mar and April as well... While you are right that earnings are expected to be reduced
this year, they already provided that guidance last quarter and the stock dropped from around $50 to as low as $35.
That factor is already cooked in. Unless they miss estimates this stock should continue it's recent trend back up.


You cherry picked a small sample of numbers to support your article, however if one is to look deeper (please go to
gurufocus, morningstar, anywhere...) you clearly are guilty of telling a half-truth that is already priced into the stock. I
could be wrong, but I urge everybody to take a look at the whole story, not just what was sampled here.

Author’s reply »  the numbers you quote appear to be backward looking. I don't recommend driving your car
looking out the rear window. The CEO's compensation is based on earnings declining -41%, at which point he
then apparently deserves a large cash bonus. I believe the CEO and the board know more about HCI's future
earnings than automated spreadsheets available for free on the internet.


01 May 2014, 03:19 PM

It seems that you did not read the article. P/E is not relevant for insurance company stocks, but more
importantly, the P/E you reference is based on peak earnings as the author clearly explained -- earnings that
are about to get mostly wiped out throughout 2014.


A lot of people own this stock because they found it on a Morningstar stock screen or similar screening tool
for low P/E with growth and they actually have no idea what the company does or why the earnings were
growing. I am also short and have conviction this is going to end very, very badly for longs.


The way to look at this is book value, and it is 2.7x vs. peers at 1x, so it is 1.7x over valued with declining
ROE as the catalyst for a multiple rerating to peers.


HCI is one of the most obvious shorts I have ever seen.


01 May 2014, 03:24 PM


D Reed
Are you really saying earnings don't matter? That is implied by stating PE does not... Price to earnings my
friend...


Also, HCI is more than just an insurance company, per their site "HCI Group, Inc. owns subsidiaries engaged
in diverse, yet complementary business activities, including homeowners’ insurance, reinsurance, real estate
and information technology services. ". So in other words, more emphasis on earnings as their business
model isn't just insurance.


Keep telling yourself this is a good short and earnings don't matter. Please, please continue to short, that's
only more upward price pressure later.

>>HCI Group, Inc. owns subsidiaries engaged in diverse, yet complementary business activities, including

In the 8-K filed a few minutes ago "other" revenue accounted for $417K of the $68.1M top line, or less than
1%. This is an insurance company.


The thesis is sound - a company trading at 2.7X book value has to earn a very high sustained ROE to justify
it's valuation. Simple example: a 10% stable ROE company with a 10% cost of equity should trade at 1X
book.


I see little chance of 25-30% ROEs in a commodity insurance business.


Pfizer trades at 2.6X book and has a 28% ROE. Exxon trades at 2.5x book and has a 19% ROE. Dow
Chemical trades at 2.6x book and has an ROE of 22%. These are companies with moats.


This thing at 2.7x book is a joke, in my opinion.

My strategy has been to sell out-of-the-money puts except during the peak of the hurricane season, generating
enough premium income to offset my property insurance premiums, risking only a fraction of the capital that would
otherwise be necessary to generate the corresponding amount of dividends. To be sure, I missed the (unrealized)
capital gain on the run to 53 or so, but most of that has been wiped out over the past few months anyway.


No position now, we'll see.

So you want to compare a $14bn mainly auto insurer with a $400mm P&C insurer who are obviously growing in
different rates?


01 May 2014, 04:02 PM

The likely slower growth of HCI is reflected in the stock price, which dropped last quarter from around $50 to a low
around $35.


As for Director compensation, the $900,000 referenced is quite misleading. Yes, this number is reported in a table
within their proxy statement. However, if one reads the paragraphs preceding this table, they will find out that none of
the reported stock awards shown in column 2 (ranging from $637,800 to $816,900) have vested. SEC rules require
that the grant-date fair value of the entire award (which would trigger at stock prices ranging from $50 to $95) in the
year of the grant.


I agree that these awards are excessive, but they are unlikely to be triggered. Moreover, the compensation committee
engaged a compensation consulting firm to review director compensation. The outcome of this review is that
beginning in 2014 directors will receive an annual cash retainer of $93,725. The one-time equity awards provided to
current non-employee directors in 2013 are expected to serve as the sole equity component of their director
compensation into the future.


All of this information is available on pages 10-11 of their "Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement" for 2014.


Regarding CEO compensation, again, I agree that it is excessive; however, it is not as egregious as outlined by "The
Pump Stopper". Referring to page 22 of the proxy statement, the CEO received an annual salary of $500,000 in 2013
plus a cash bonus of $3,563,542 (this represented 3.25% of EBIT). The $15M represents total compensation if the
restricted stock awards were triggered (which they were not). As with the board directors, SEC rules require that the
full value be reported even if not triggered. See page 32, Option Excercises and Stock Vested in 2013, and you will
see that the CEO amount is zero.

When you say the lower growth is reflected, I assume you are of course factoring in the NEGATIVE EPS growth that
is coming and that a run of the mill P&C insurer should trade at 1x tangible book value. By that math, the stock should
be worth somewhere close to $14 which is hardly factored into the current stock price. The stock actually sold for a
long time <$10 before the growth occurred.


The other aspect that Pump Stoppers missed is the current buyback -- why buy stock with declining EPS coming at a
high multiple? They are destroying capital, which will accelerate the share price decline over time once they run out of

Interesting analysis and interesting feedback. Thank you.


I've been following HCI for some time as a potential short based on financial statement trends, most notably:


- weak return on total capital 
- weak net profit margin 
- weak capital turnover (sales divided by total capital) 
- weak operating margin and gross profit margin 
- adverse growth in total liabilities 
- adverse receivable trends 
- adverse payable trends


Your article on pending deteriorating in profitability led me to take an initial short position, so let's see, let the chips fall
where they may.

Roderick MacIver, Contributor
I'm sorry I neglected to add the word trends after my observations, namely:


- weak return on total capital trend 
- weak net profit margin trend 
- weak capital turnover (sales divided by total capital) trend 
- weak operating margin and gross profit margin trends 
- adverse growth in total liabilities (again a trend) 
- adverse receivable trends 
- adverse payable trends


Absolutes don't mean that much to me. I invest in improving companies and short deteriorating ones, almost
regardless of their current situation.

"Q1 2014 should be HCI’s first quarter with significant YOY EPS decline and is likely the start of a 75%+ drop in
earnings."


Beat estimates by 0.10, and growth from previous quarter up 10% YoY... Got a ways to go to get to -75% EPS. Good
luck with your shorts.


01 May 2014, 04:55 PM

False, this was press release manipulation. The earnings were down 20% YOY which is the metric the street
looks at. No one was fooled by the irrelevant sequential comparison.


01 May 2014, 05:00 PM

Sequential comparisons are irrelevant? They capture different patterns than QoQ and YoY, but irrelevant...
That statement is at least slightly foolish IMO. If you must short, short away... I love owning highly shorted
stocks.

I'm not sure what that even means. YoY means "year over year" in finance, as in comparing this year to last
year. Therefore it is not possible for something to grow from last quarter YoY.


01 May 2014, 08:05 PM


D Reed
Thanks for the education in QoQ and YoY... I guess that wasn't covered in my MBA in Finance curriculum.
That statement from the press release "Revenue of $68.11M (+10.2% Y/Y)". It is meant to be interpreted as:


2013 Q1 Revenue = $61.8M 
2014 Q1 Revenue = $68.1M


As in (2013-Q1) 61.8 x 10.2% increase in revenue = 68.1M (2014 Q1).


Taking the 2013 Q1 and comparing to the 2014 Q1 is YoY! I think you chose to hide behind semantics hoping
I didn't understand the numbers and/or where they were coming from. Nice try Pump! Quarterly revenue
jumped over 10% on a YoY basis. Simple as that. Understand now?


Also, I realize P/B has become a standard measure for which insurance companies are measured. However,
what good is the P/B number? It only tells you what the company is worth if liquidated, as in fails and sells all
of its assets. Shorting a company based on that number as opposed to earning would only seem smart if the
company was at risk of going under. Is that what you believe here? I guess to each his own, probably
explains the current high short ratio. A ratio that will also serve as fuel to create a short squeeze when HCI
gets back into the $40s. Shorting a company with an existing high short % is quite often not smart economics.
I'm happy taking your money either way though!

With respect this is a naive comment. P/B is less relevant for companies with a lot of intangible assets (e.g.
tech), but for a financial firm, especially an insurance company, it is hugely relevant. The primary asset they
have to work with is their cash.


It's really very simple - insurance is highly competitive. For HCI to be worth 2.7x Book it needs 20-30%
sustained return on equity. If a segment of the insurance market is paying those returns, capital will flood in.
For example if flood insurance in Florida is so greatand offering 30% loss-adjusted returns on capital, other
insurance companies who are delighted to may 10% or even 5% on underwriting will come in with lower
prices and brokers will divert business that way. Reinsurance is cutthroat now and companies are struggling
to even make a profit.


Book value is highly relevant for a financial as it is the other side of the coin of "what return on equity can this
company earn". High P/B implies high ROE and vice versa.

The author is pointing out that the current high ROEs are transient factors, and thus ROE is destined to fall
dramatically. High P/B + low ROE = look out below.


The current financials are really irrelevant here. If someone wants to convince me not to short this, or even go
long, answer these question:


In 2018 HCI's ROE will be 25-30% because _________________.


The company can defend these ROEs from all competition because its moat is _________________.


Cue the crickets and tumbleweeds.


 
P.S. Google's ROE last year was 16.25%.

The statement was given to have the reader take on a different perspective than the traditional one which
people incapable of thinking for themselves like to cram down others throats. It is naive to assume that P/B
must be a certain value or the company is automatically overvalued. It is naive to assume that P/B is the only
metric that matters.


All of the shorts will get burned because you are zeroing in on this number, disregarding revenue growth, and
comparing HCI to large national companies. Either way, just cracked $40 on intraday and looking up. Good
luck with your short.

Let me clarify then: They are irrelevant here. Q/Q is a metric the street looks at for rapid growth SAAS stocks. It is not
relevant to an insurance company with inflated earnings where the earnings are declining. For one, earnings aren't
even the metric here. For two, the earnings are down year over year. Only a retail investor trying to justify a losing
investment would look at Q/Q earnings here.

"this was press release manipulation."


Virtually ALL press releases, and most earnings for that matter, are manipulated in one way or another. If it weren't for
buybacks, where would IBM be???


I didn't hear you on the conference call, but what I did hear was analyst after analyst congratulating them on a good
quarter.


THEY are who matter because they are the ones who are paid to issue upgrades, downgrades, and who, for
whatever reason, the public listens to, not you. Yes, it's all a dog and pony show, it's all musical chairs, but if you are
going to play, learn the rules.

HCI's valuation is more than justified: 
best premium growth among peers 
best loss ratio among peers 
best Tangible ROE among peers 
best management among peers 
best risk strategy among peers 
most hidden value among peers (income portfolio and real estate portfolio) 
and Florida insurance peers trade at 2.2x book vs HCI at 2.4x. Your peer group used in your report is grossly
inaccurate. 
Back to $45 we go. Enjoy.

Small cap, thanks for capturing some of the fundamentals that are not earnings based and I did not include
above. Also, excellent point I missed on the HCI peers P/B being over 2. The broader number originally
provided is not very practical... For that matter, I personally feel too much emphasis is placed on P/B with
Insurance companies. Happy investing!

Pump is right, disregard every aspect of a great company's strong financial success because one aspect is
changing IRT earnings... The entire argument was already factored into the price. If you didn't short last

window which Pump keeps referring too actually does have some value in this case...

So your saying there are metrics out there which predict the future perfectly?


Call it a difference of semantics but...


All metrics are backward looking. Investing is looking at past performance, listening to current plans
(conference calls and direction of corporate capital flow and current projects) and making an educated
extrapolation.


Infact, as a calculus hobbyist (I know that sounds gross), the best thing you can do to "predict" is analyze
derivatives of moving averages and draw a probability from the derivative graphs around crossovers, in other
words derivative of the MACD - the steeper the more likely to continue. There is a relationship there but it
gets rather mathematically complex and notice I said only then can you draw a probability.


If you are privvy to tried and true, functional forward looking metrics, please let me know! I'd like to share in
the billions your making!

Except for the need to look forward I am not in agreement with the stance of this article and simply I hope the author
got in on today's call and hopefully learned something new as, imho, he has not grasped the big picture of HCI and
their take and approach to their industry.

Author’s reply »  Looks like the growth that had investors so excited has definitively left the building. Earnings just
came out and looks pretty bad to me:


income available to common stockholders declined from $1.81 last year Q1 2013 to $1.44 this quarter for what looks
like -20% decline in earnings. For an insurance company trading at an incredible valuation like this, that seems
terrible to me.


01 May 2014, 07:56 PM

Growth comes in the form of increased revenue which was up around 10%. Many internals can affect EPS,
this is an easily manipulated number and less meaningful than revenue in a growth company. Their growth
may not be as astronomical as it once was, but this is still a growth company.


I agree with tiedye, Pump is not grasping the broader view of this company. Don't be a lemur.

growth company" as the growth is negative currently and the company has communicated to you they expect
it to be so in the future too. If revenue is growing and earnings are STILL declining that is typically not a good
sign for the businesses earnings power and indicates to me that, since the basement is out of paintings, we
are already seeing this impact their business.


I'm really not trying to be confrontational so please don't take it as such. I'm just trying to publish the truth here
as a lot of investors blindly swallow whatever analysts and management give them.


 
I think Keubiko is right on with his comments and instead of using backward looking metrics which are not
relevant to an opaque black box insurance company the key questions you need to answer if you own this
stock are:


 
In 2018 HCI's ROE will be 25-30%+ because _________________.


The company can defend these ROEs from all competition because its moat is _________________.


 
If you can't model out, with math and the financials, a scenario where HCI's ROE is 30%+ in 2017 then I think
you are likely to get burned.

tiedyedmind
Not sure what kind of growth you were expecting but Revenue up 9.25% compared to Q1 2013. Expenses higher but
analysts are liking the Quarter and the call.


Look ahead and watch the business grow at a safe strategic pace. 
Reinsurance stance (going heavy) will further strengthen an already solid and safe foundation.


Negligible exposure to the recent Panhandle disaster and Management appears very grounded and will be ready for
opportunities to purchase books to boost the growth in given time. In the mean time retention is excellent.


A good conference call.

HCI Group, Inc. 
1Q14 EPS Beat on Another Strong Underwriting Result; 30% 
YTD Pullback in Stock Price Creates Attractive Entry Point 
Our Call 
HCI reported operating EPS of $1.44, above our estimate at $1.21 and consensus 
at $1.34. The beat vs. our estimate was primarily driven by a continued low level 
of loss activity. Growth on an earned basis was in line with our forecast and 
management seemed upbeat about longer-term growth prospects. We believe the 
30% YTD decline in HCI’s stock price creates an attractive entry point given

current P/E at just over 7x our 2015 estimate with projected ROEs of nearly 30%. 
■ 1Q14 Results: HCI’s $1.44 of operating EPS in the quarter translated to a 38.5% 
annualized ROE. Loss ratio of 28.0% was in line with recent quarters and well 
below our 36.0% forecast. Acquisition expense ratio was in line while G&A was 
a bit higher than what were looking for driven by compensation expenses. NII 
beat our estimate and we expect this to ramp further as the company continues 
to put its large cash position to work. Top-line growth on an earned basis was 
in line with our forecast. 
■ Management Upbeat About Growth Prospects: On the call, management 
commented that there may be upside to the company’s stated goal of 5% 
homeowners market share in the state of Florida, perhaps in the 6-8% range. 
While near-term growth in the state will likely come at a slower pace than 
recent years as pricing pressures increase and takeout opportunities not being 
as attractive, declining reinsurance costs should help drive net growth as 
management expects aggregate reinsurance costs to remain stable and total 
reinsurance coverage to increase. In addition, an application recently launched 
by HCI’s Exzeo brand that increases the speed at which an agent can quote a 
policy is off to a promising start and can potentially be a significant driver of 
future growth. 
■ Estimates and Valuation: We are raising our 2014 estimate to $4.60 from $4.50 
reflecting the 1Q14 EPS beat offset by some slight changes in our growth and 
share count assumptions. Our 2015 estimate of $5.10 remains unchanged. HCI 
is down 30% YTD vs. Florida peers up 13% on average. However, the company 
currently trades at a discount to its Florida peers (7.4x 2015E EPS vs. 8.7x) but 
with projected ROE roughly 7 points higher at 29.7% vs. 22.5%. Our $46 price 
target implies about 9x our 2015 EPS estimate.

Rummaging through the 10-K there are some other interesting notes. Note 21 on related party transactions discloses:


1) The CEO, his family, and a director own a reinsurance company called "Moksha Re SPC Ltd.


2) The CEO, his family, and two directors, and the head of HCI real estate division own another reinsurance company
- Oxbridge.


With respect to the period from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014, Moksha assumed approximately [$15.4 million]

of the total covered exposure for approximately [$4.3 million] in premiums, a rate which management believes to be
competitive with market rates available to Claddaugh.


and:


"With respect to the period from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014,Oxbridge assumed [$10.1 million] of the total
covered exposure for approximately [$4.9 million] in premiums, a rate which management believes to be competitive
with market rates available to Claddaugh."


That's $9.2 million in premium to these entities owned by insiders for $25.5 million of covered exposure.


Some questions:


1) How do we know there wasn't cherry-picking going on here? i.e. funneling the lowest risk policies to these entities. I
see no disclosure on process. One would think best practice would be to auction them all, and if those entities want to
bid in an open auction so be it.


2) The first $4.3M for $15.4M in covered exposure is 28%, the second ($4.9M for $10.1M ) is 49%. Does that not
seem insanely high? 49% implies the risk is expected to play out every other year.


Very opaque, but as a data check:


http://bit.ly/1iLnpuA


"Citizens has budgeted $200m to renew $1.6 billion of its reinsurance program in 2014."


That is $200M for $1.6B in risk, or 12.5% (not 28% and certainly not 49%)


Given most of HCI's policies were purchased from Citizens, presumably we are in the same wheelhouse from a risk
perspective.


Thoughts?

Keubiko; these are great questions. I really enjoy listening to the HCI conference calls and each time I remain
confident in management. I wish this could have been asked yesterday by an analyst on the call, but perhaps we can
get an explanation by e-mailing one of them or Paresh Patel at HCI. Could the lower % Citizens is budgeting a
discount for the volume? I have no idea and will try and find out more as well.

I find that the HCI conference calls are very transparent and even telegraph some intentions. Yesterday i really
appreciated the discussion regarding books available to acquire, how a few have been evaluated and passed on, but
they are regularly becoming available and if the right opportunity is presented the size of these books can add 50,000
policies in one swift transaction.

dutchpower86
Even assuming your 100% correct, how do we get a 75% decline in stock price? I see a boring slow grower with an
excellent portfolio of current clients, low turn over, and arguably safer exposure than competitors. This is exactly the
sort of company that has rewarded me with my double digit CAGR over my investment career. Union pacific, Neenah
Paper, Tyson, Valero, U-Haul, Westlake Chemical, MLP's like ETE/EPT. Look at any of those over the past 12-18
months. I'd add HCI in there in a heartbeat.


Can I be wrong? Sure, but to me THIS is exciting growth. Dependable, reliable, good quality. It seems we have
different views on 'exciting growth' - and that is something you should quantify in your articles. Define your
expectations. If your looking for TESLA like EPS growth, I'd join you for six months, but leave with my profits before it
went parabolic, which could be when you were backing up the truck and putting the farm in. Tesla gave me 30 grand
in profits and I got out before everyone in the media was going NUTS (my sell signal). I took a good portion of that
and rolled it into HCI at 34.30. And I'm currently sleeping soundly.


Exciting earnings are fantastic, but when you can ignore other aspects of a company because earnings % growth
doesn't meet your requirements you are suffering from tunnel vision indeed.


However I think the software proplet talked about in the conference call actually makes me think there is some
organic growth potential that will surprise. Its currently rolling out and is at 3 or 4 agents currently but has caught a
dozen or so policies at each agent in only a few weeks - a somewhat significant gain if the trend keeps up. Remember
there are hundreds of agents out there.


But like tiedyedmind eluded to - Paresh makes no pretenses about telegraphing m&a moves which will allow real
'block' gains meaningfully accretive to the portfolio of policies. What Tiedymind didn't include (but I'm sure he heard)
was that Paresh had two of three possibly acquisitions this quarter that they passed up. I like to see this selectivity in
acquisition, I don't know the details obviously, but its still a nice thing to see.


In the end, your right, the Citizens deal was a good move by Paresh and its mostly done. You see that as a sell signal
for the stock, I see that as what it is: a good move by Paresh and Co. I have faith in the management: software
proplet looks like another great idea. Like Buffet, I trust a management team and I like this one. I see the citizens deal
and now proplet as unconventional methods an above average management team utilized to deliver value to the
shareholder. If you treat stocks like one trick ponies your only willing to ride over one hurdle when there are dozens of
hurdles in a corporate lifetime - your never going to have the staying power to see those 'bagger' stocks to borrow a
Peter Lynch term.

Author’s reply »  we went through the math of how earnings could decline -75% in the article. If you have a
model or math that justifies HCI's ROE staying at 25%+ for the next 2-3 years I would love to see it.


Also HCI is essentially the most expensive insurance stock in the entire market, that is not the valuation one
would ascribe to a "boring slow grower".


Can you explain why you trust HCI's management team so much? They appear to be egregiously over
compensated and there are many questionable related party transactions I'd like to hear you justify and
explain so that I can understand how you get so comfortable with them.

What we learn from the post earnings price action is that listening to short sellers on SI is a dangerous way of doing

I attentively listen to all conference calls and try and learn more about the business by also listening to the questions
analysts present.


Have you ever joined in on a conference call? have you ever discussed HCI with any of the analysts covering the
company? In your article you wrote you e-mailed people but did not get a reply. If that is it you have a significant
amount of additional due diligence to perform before picking up a pen to write an article.

My personal view is that if an investor's due diligence on management is listening to the earnings calls where
sell side brokers who are conflicted and receive millions in underwritting fees lob in softball questions, that is
not sufficient or useful.


I'd recommend you get on the phone and call someone, anyone, at any of the insurance companies that
voluntarily exited this market that HCI claims is going to be so lucrative in the future.

Selling at 50 was smart last year, good work, but with all the new business their new normalized earnings are
probably higher than $6/year, so $60 is a pretty fair value, or 10x for a company that always finds a way to
