QUESTCOR: WHEN THINGS
GO FROM BAD TO WORSE,
AND EVEN WORSE


Nov 2nd update:


Perspective on breaking news for Questcor:
November 2, 2012


This morning, researchers posted this link from the
FDA website.

Index_Number=378212
[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD
Index_Number=378212]


Questcor’s stock reacted immediately, but now Citron
shares some thoughts on the signi�cance of this data
point. 


At �rst, Citron, was skeptical about this link.  A
previously unheard of �rm, Cerium Pharmaceuticals,
from a residential address, �ling for Orphan Drug
Product Designation for Synacthen Depot.  This
appeared highly questionable.  Then we looked at the
corporate registry for Cerium Pharma, and found Gregg
Lapointe of Gaithersburg, Md.

Gregg Lapointe is a critical person in the history of
Questcor.  He was a member of the Questcor Board of
Directors during the period that Sigma-Tau
Pharmaceuticals was the early venture backer for
Questcor.  Then he left the board in 2007 to become
CEO of Sigma-Tau , which is a large, privately held
European-based (but with US headquarters in
Gaithersburg, Md)  pharmaceutical company
specializing in treating rare
diseases: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-Tau
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-Tau]


 


Then he returned to Questcor with much fanfare in
2009, but declined to stand for re-election to Questcor’s
board in 2010.


Gregg Lapointe is a  member of the corporate council
of the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD),
the Child Neurology Foundation and Kidney Care
Partners. 


And Questcor’s own words about Mr. Lapointe’s return
in 2009:   


“He brings to our Board and shareholders
signi�cant pharmaceutical and public company
experience, as well as hands on operational
familiarity with therapies that treat patients with
rare diseases. As we continuously explore
additional opportunities for our product, H.P.


Acthar® Gel to meet the unmet medical needs of
patients, Gregg will bring valuable perspective to
our Board. We look forward to working with him
again.”


In brief, he was the most medically experienced
member of Questcor’s  Board of Directors  … and now
he is �ling for Synacthen for orphan drug status.

And he resigned from Sigma-Tau in 2012, the same
month he �led the Corporate registration for Cerium in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. 


NOTE:  This FDA �nding is NOT US approval for
Synacthen; it represents the �rst step in a licensing
process.  Synacthen is widely available in Europe, and is
very inexpensive.  Its safety pro�le is well understood
because of its availability in the European market for
many years.  Its approval in the US will signal the end
for Questcor, whose entire �nancial underpinning is its
pricing power for its single high-priced drug, Acthar.   


This conclusively proves that Questcor management is
and has been lying when it states its market for Acthar
is not imperiled by the appearance of a generic version
of Acthar in the US market. 


 


Oct 19th update:


Questcor update from Humana- Need for


Preauthorization- The Walls are Closing in


Humana is now requiring pre-authorization for
Acthar reimbursement. 


http://apps.humana.com/marketing/documents.asp?
�le=1978730
[http://apps.humana.com/marketing/documents.asp?
�le=1978730]


The document is new.  (Revision date
Oct 26th, 2012, e�ective date January
26, 2013)
For Acthar, the preauthorization
requirement is new – speci�cally
asterisked.  Acthar was not listed on
the 2012 version of this document.


It is Citron’s opinion that this is part of a pattern of
insurers taking a more restrictive stance on
authorization policy with regard to Acthar
reimbursement.

These industry-leading insurers may be o�ering the
appearance of being more open about Acthar
approval, but Citron has sought opinion of experts
(such as a former Blue Cross/Blue Shield Chief
Medical O�cer) who state that, in practice, these
new pre-authorizations set the stage for insurers to
frame reimbursement decisions in view of Aetna’s
policy and its rationale (lack of clinical evidence, and
discussions with thought leaders).


Citron notes that none of the recent round of
defenses of the company even mention the
ongoing Department of Justice investigation.  It is
Citron’s opinion that this investigation remains
highly material to the company’s future business
prospects.


Neither the company nor analysts seem inclined to
update the investing public about any of these
changes.  In the next month, insurers will be
publishing their reimbursement schedules and
policies for 2013.  Citron will continue to update the
market about these changes with regard to
reimbursement for Acthar prescriptions.  Citron
believes these decisions will align with Aetna, who
stated that their tightening pre-authorization
requirement is based on the lack of clinical
evidence for superior e�cacy of Acthar to steroid
therapies.


   It’s never a problem, until it’s a
problem


Oct 17th:


A few weeks ago, another ominous datapoint was disclosed in


regard to the status of health insurers’ reimbursement policies


for clinical use of Questcor’s primary drug Acthar.   United


Healthcare, the largest health carrier in the US, has issued new


guidelines for 2013, speci�cally tightening scrutiny on Acthar,


and taking it to the highest of all scrutiny levels

grandfathering.


Note:  No grandfathering is permitted.   Patients
on existing therapy are not exempt.  This adds
emphasis to the gravity of the policy change.


This ratchets up scrutiny of Acthar even further —
from the most restrictive class of drugs to a case-
by-case basis at the largest single health carrier in
the United States.


Note:  This is a noti�cation document, not a
conditions of coverage document.   Conditions of
coverage are proprietary to the company, and
might or might not be released.  This document
doesn’t specify  the medical conditions under which
Acthar is prescribed, but only to the increased
scrutiny such prescriptions will be subject to prior
to reimbursement.

5/18/2018 Questcor: When things go from Bad to Worse, and even Worse – Citron Research

Scenario: because there is no clinical data to support 
Infantile Spasms. 


http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/70
[http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/70


Some may spin this as good news – the “nothing is
changed” justi�cation – the argument is the
company is already accustomed to having to get
individual prescriptions approved for
reimbursement.


Citron asks:  How can the company justify a growth
path when it is obligated to pre-authorize every
single prescription by submitting individual patient
medical records while under an open investigation
from the Department of Justice on its sales and
marketing practices ?


  


   Conclusion


 


It is Citron’s opinion that Questcor is a hand-holding
operation on how to skirt insurance company
reimbursement procedures and policies, and it is
�nally catching up with them.   Citron also notes
that the sell-side analysts again demonstrate that
relying on them to keep abreast of this story is
risky.
It is Citron’s opinion that this business model is the
very de�nition of not sustainable, that it should not
be conferred valuation predicated on a “customary”
multiple, and restates its opinion that it is headed
to single digits in the next twelve months.
And worst, why didn’t the company disclose this ?


It’s never a problem, until it’s a problem.
