Unmasking The Harbin Electric Buyout Drama
Oct. 9, 2011 5:09 AM ET81 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Anyone who has followed the Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) buyout drama knows that:


By all evidence HRBN is a fraction of the business enterprise it claims to be. There
have been numerous credible allegations of fraud from various quarters in recent
history. (See links at the bottom of this report to review some of these allegations.)
The CEO, Mr. Tianfu Yang, has been taking all of the logical steps at significant
expenditure of time and expense to pursue what seems to be a legitimate attempt to
take HRBN private at a significant premium to the company’s apparent enterprise
value.
Mr. Yang has diligently worked to keep the stock price up (see Appendix A) by:


Vigorously responding to every negative report or price drop with press releases as
quickly as possible, even during the middle of the night.
Making boiler plate announcements related to the buyout in an almost compulsory
response to market action. Whenever HRBN’s share price drops you can be sure a
press release or some other announcement will follow. Essentially, management
has developed their own plunge protection strategy to support HRBN’s share price.
Asking shareholders to contact their brokers and instructing them not to lend their
shares to short sellers.


Most investors probably don’t realize that HRBN took out a $50 million loan (35 million
USD + 100 million RMB) on November 20, 2010 with terms that would make most loan
sharks blush. Despite the fact that HRBN had $80 million cash and liquid receivables and
inventory that could easily have been pledged as collateral, the bank extracted collateral
from CEO Yang as security for the loan. The loan requires Mr. Yang to:


Pledge collateral in cash or shares should the mark to market value of the initial
collateral drop below 167% of the total loan exposure (about $92 million)
Sign a full personal guarantee to ensure maintenance of the margin and full
repayment of the loan.
Failure to maintain the collateral level allows the lender to take possession of the
CEO’s shares and sell them in open market.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/298406-unmasking-the-harbin-electric-buyout-drama 2/28


The loan terms required Mr. Yang to post, as escrowed collateral, the greater of 7
million HRBN shares or 200% of the full loan exposure (including principle interest or
about $110 million in collateral). See SECURITY AND PLEDGE AGREEMENT, page 11-
15.


This loan leaves the CEO personally vulnerable to margin calls should the share price
drop below $13.14. Mr. Yang’s Personal Guarantee of the loan and possible margin calls
on the collateral pledged to secure it put his personal assets at risk in the event of a
material drop in HRBN’s market price. In fact, he is not in possession of the vast
majority of his shares (7 million shares) as they are held in escrow as part of the
security for that loan. In other words, it is very much in Yang’s interest that HRBN’s
share price does not drop. Most, if not all, of his personal assets are at risk if it does.


Mr. Yang has been quite successful at supporting HRBN’s share price. During 2010, while
in negotiations for the initial $50 million loan, he was able to generate sufficient investor
interest to support the share price by simply talking about his planned buyout. That easy
strategy fell apart in early June 2011 when the share price dropped to $13.30. In fact, by
June 16, 2011, the shares dropped by over $6 below the margin call level (the red phone
must have been ringing repeatedly at Mr. Yang’s house).


Immediately following the plunge in HRBN shares, Mr. Yang conveniently signed loan
documents and announced that he secured all necessary financing for the buyout. True to
form, the press releases came almost daily afterwards until the stock price finally
stabilized and started to move higher again.


Since that time, as anyone who has followed HRBN knows, Mr. Yang has been watching
the stock closely and responds immediately to any price drop with further press releases
related to the buyout. In one recent case, HRBN was fortunate enough to have its buyout
case touted in an “unrelated company’s” press releases published by DEER on
September 6, 2011. We can’t help but wonder if the press release from DEER really was
unrelated since Ben Wey brought both companies to the U.S. markets


The following chart (click to enlarge image) graphically illustrates our point of just how
effective HRBN’s plunge protection team has been.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/298406-unmasking-the-harbin-electric-buyout-drama 3/28


The key questions that have arisen during this buyout drama are:


1. Why did the bank making the $50 million loan require CEO Yang’s personal guarantee
and collateral if HRBN is the company management claims it is? If such onerous terms
were required for a $50 million loan what would they be for a loan 10 or 15 times as
large? Can we really accept the notion that the terms for additional financing so much
greater than the original loan would be less stringent? We don’t think so.


2. What end game could there possibly be for CEO Yang if the buyout intentions are not
real? Why would the CEO pursue all of the extensive steps for a buyout at such
significant cost to the company and personal risk to himself?


3. If the buyout intentions are real, why would the CEO work so hard to keep the stock
price up? What is the worst the buyer would face if the stock price drops? A cheaper
purchase price for the buyout?! The company should just leave well enough alone.


4. Why would a healthy company that claims to have over $80 million cash on hand
take a $50 million loan at terms that require the CEO to maintain mark to market
collateral at 200% of the maximum loan exposure and provide a full unlimited
personal guarantee not only for repayment, but for the maintenance at all times of
mark to market collateral of at least 167% of maximum loan exposure?


Now for the End Game

It has become clear to us that CEO Yang’s end game in this drama is to secure the $50
million needed to repay the November 20, 2010 loan and free himself from the personal
guarantee and get his shares back. It appears to us that the whole buyout game is an
attempt to buy time to find the $50 million and avoid margin calls.


In other words, the drama may be all about Yang protecting his personal interests, but his
interests may not be necessarily aligned with those of public shareholders. If Yang gets
himself off the hook do you think he will be so diligent in the future, effectively propping up
the share price? The public shareholders will be left holding the bag if and when the
buyout attempt fails.


In the end, investors need to make their own decisions. For us, we just don’t buy the
“HRBN going private” story and consider the stock an excellent short selling opportunity
given that the ceiling for the stock is limited to the proposed buyout price of $24 and the
bottom is much lower if anything whatsoever goes wrong with this deal.

The shorts will loose if the company goes private before they can manipulate the shares down and cover. Covering
would mean being able to purchased most of the outstanding shares.


My guess is that the Geo Team is nothng more that a hedge fund plant paid to try and drive shares down so they dont
loose their shirts.


Sell short at your own risk but remember it may be the heavy short positions trying to get you to take the hit instead of
the company trying to pull a fast one.

Thanks -- I've been mystified as to Yang's motivation for keeping the "we're about to privatize" story alive, this is the
best explanation I've heard for it. When must the $50 million loan be repaid?

Its an open line of credit. As long as the mark to market colateral is maintained. Problem for Yang is that he
has to maintain the colateral value (stock price) above the margin call level until the loan is paid off.

@ 'deepthroat'


That's a mute point. Every trader, person, entity has an agenda in the market. That's why they disclosed
being short. Rather than stoking conspiracy theories about the agenda of the author, how about actually
addressing some of the allegations made regarding the buyout....you could be long short or not

did you write the author's name of this hit piece in invisible ink? name one reputable outfit that puts out
anonymous "research" pieces.


btw, i went to your site and looked at the bios. very impressive. not. the founder has a background in investor
relations at vanguard, which means that he was in sales hitting up potential investors (ie, did nothing with
research or the markets). the #2 has never worked in capital markets and lists his past jobs as being a
general manager of a retail store (think Gap Girls from SNL) and is developing a sports complex. the #3's
main strength is "interviewing corporate management" and doesn't list any experience in capital markets. the
#4 has 18 years in "sales management positions in the automotive industry" (can we say used car salesman)
and also doesn't have any experience in capital markets. #5 has an engineering degree and his first job out of
college was "managing multi-million dollar contracts," which also didn't involve the capital markets. #6 is in
operations and #7 deals with market timing (like that's a winning strategy in the long run).


so there you have the murder's row of investing. a whole firm of people without any experience in capital
markets posting anonymous hit pieces on blogs. i'm curious if the Gap Girl guy or the used car salesman was
the actual author of this anonymous piece.

then who wrote this piece? when an analyst writes a research piece at a reputable firm, guess what he does? he puts
his name on it. this piece has no such thing. anonymous hit pieces on this rag of a site is just a desperate attempt by
the author to try and get one final dip before he can cover his loser trade.


which conspiracy theory did i stoke? do you even know what a conspiracy is? it sounds like you don't. shorting a stock
and then anonymously bashing it on SA hardly involves a conspiracy. citing not 1 but 2 of your prior anonymous hit
pieces further undermines what little, if any, credibility these jokers might have. citing 2 anonymous AL hit pieces is
even more ridiculous. at least the DEER litigation will reveal who those crooks are.

At $21 to $22, around 10% from $24 strike price. the street has bet that the deal will consumate as planned.
Relatively, take a look at other LBOs of US companies by US interests. e.g Variance Semiconductors by Applied
Material and Motorola Mobility by Google. Both were trading 6% or 7% from take over price last Monday. And those
are sure things.


If the probability of failure is high, we should be looking at minimum of 20% discount if not more. Case in point was
the Clorox deal proposed by Carl Icahn.

You know you have a good story when all you have is people attacking the credibility of authors instead of the "actual
information" being reported.


This information really explains a lot and it make sense. Why else would a CEO who is trying to "buy-out" the
company defend the stock price from falling? Surely the lower the price the cheaper he gets to buy the company for!?!


If people weren't convinced it was a fraud before, this is the silver bullet. There is no privatization, this guy is stringing
everyone along as long as he can get away with it. Right now he's probably working out how to disappear with as
much of the real assets as possible leaving the shareholders holding the bag.


SEC or NASDAQ have to wake up sooner or later.....

I too am short on HRBN. However, your explanation on the 'End Game' is a bit fuzzy. At current prices, the CDB is
holding about $150,000,000 worth of Yang's stock. If he pays back the loan of $50,000,000 he gets back his stock,
but when the buyout fails to go through Yang knows that in all likelihood the stock will go down to at least $5 and will
never recover, This equates to a loss of $115,000,000 on the shares from current prices and would be worth only
$35,000,000.


To be able to get a more accurate outcome of the 'End Game', I think you need to highlight all the red flags in the
relationship between Yang and the CDB:


1) Yang took out an interest paying loan even though there was apparently ample cash in the company's bank
account.


2) Yang's personal stock and not company assets were used as collateral for the loan.


3) The cash from the loan is apparently sitting idle in a bank account. 
http://bit.ly/qrPHXK


4) As the stock price was approaching Yang's margin calls, the CDB signed off the loan term for the $400,000,000,
about 33% from the buyout price.


5) The CDB does not want any disclosure with regards to HRBN - a prerequisite if they are to be able to trade HRBN
stock/options without being accused of insider trading.


What stands out is that HRBN apparently didn't need the $50,000,000 loan. This can be for one of 2 reasons:


1) HRBN has hidden liabilities. 
2) Yang wants the CDB to hold his stock.


Why would Yang want the CDB to hold his stock? Because in this scenario the CDB can purchase put options on the
stock as a means of insuring their collateral without being accused of insider trading. This may come at the request of
Yang and he may even lend back part of the $50,000,000 to the CDB for this purpose.


Now you have the scenario where if put options are purchased on a daily basis for 2 months prior to the failed buyout,
at an average premium of $5 at the $24 put option strike price, the CDB and Yang stand to make $133,000,000. The

stock will then probably be halted and delisted. If the business is still viable, the business will continue in China. If
Yang really loves his company he may buy it back on the pink sheets.

Mr Yang is not worried about his stock, he knows its worthless. And as with "PUDA", once the stock collapses
he will just steal the operating subsidiary and all its assets. 
What Mr Yang is worried about is a personal guarantee for everything he owns and more. The Personal
guarantee is to a big Chinese Bank who, unlike the SEC, will collect. 
After his shares get sold on a margin call he still owes the bank the difference between what they get for the
shares and the open default balance. 
Mr. Yang needs to keep the stock price up until he can raise $50 to save his personal wealth (which in his
mind includes the HRBN assets that he can steal any time).


 
BTW if u believe that HRBN has cash in the Bank just because their balance sheet says so, you have not
been following Chineese reverse mergers.

>Mr Yang is not worried about his stock, he knows its worthless.


Mr Yang owns about a third of HRBN stock, currently worth $190,000,000 at market price. I would be worried.


>BTW if u believe that HRBN has cash in the Bank just because their balance sheet says so, you have not

I did state the possibility that HRBN has hidden liabilities, but was only discussing other possible scenarios
which have not been discussed previously.

huanjo,


You are onto something. I also wasn't satisfied with Geo's 'CEO end game' thoughts. There had to be a
situation where the CEO can, in effect, dispose of the stock legally. Your explanation that CDB can purchase
put options makes a lot of sense.


Strangely, October and December are heavy on the put options side. I anticipate something will shake up by
December 31.

Looking through the purchased put options between the months of October through March there are
approximately 220,000 put options outstanding. Yang would need 100,000 options to cover his positions so
there are enough outstanding to make your claim. Based on the size of the contracts and the blocks that were
entered (assuming Yang is the purchaser of all of them) you would be looking at an average price of
$19/share with a put premium of $4 meaning his net position would be $15/share if he were to walk away.
That would put a floor on the value of his holdings at $140 million....he could easily pay back the loan when
his put options are exercised....and still come out the other end with net $90 million. One thing we have
learned recently is that the CEO's of RM companies can pretty much get away with anything without worrying
about the consequences...unless they cross the Chinese government.

Huanjo, 
You wrote: "5) The CDB does not want any disclosure with regards to HRBN - a prerequisite if they are to be able to
trade HRBN stock/options without being accused of insider trading."


Please elaborate on this statement. What is the requirement and how have they satisfied it?


The idea that CDB is cahoots with Yang makes a lot of sense. If nothing else, they have $50 million of collateral to
protect.

I got that information from an article by Roddy Boyd:

The information is in about the 9th paragraph.


All the points stated in my comment above are taken from other researchers like Citron, Roddy Boyd,
Geoinvesting etc. which I accept at face value. Only the deduction of the possible outcomes of these facts are
mine.

dont you find your logic faulty at all? if HRBN is really a fraud, then Yang's stock is worthless anyways. why would
Yang care about protecting "personal interests" which are worthless? So your point is that since Yang wanted to
protect his "worthless" shares, he has then decided to dream up an MBO (which really doesnt solve anything but
extends the ultimate downfall in the end if those shares are indeed worthless). Not only that, he has gone out and
hired the best advisors possible (GS, MS, Lazard, EY, best law firms), jumped through multiple due diligence
processes conducted by the advisors, Abax and CDB, subject himself to countless attacks by short sellers over a 1
year period....all just to protect his worthless shares for 1 more year? and then what? he pulls the bid and watch his

the past year? for what???

Shares can go to zero if he has protected them with put options. He will exercise his put options at the strike
price (average would be approximately $19/share). The bagholders would be the investors and the ones that
sold him the puts. It is actually a genious plan if that is in fact what he did. On top of all that he is protected by
Chinese law so we cannot bring him to US soil and prosecute.


Disclosure: Burnt on Chinese stocks before and no position either way (atleast anymore) on HRBN

Mr Yang is on the hook for more then his shares. He has signed a personal Guarantee that covers all his
private assets outside of HRBN shares.  
With the MBO he buys time to get the $50 million to pay CDB.


I don't know Yangs personal business. He may have some ventures he is expecting or hoping to be able
generate the cash from in a few months.  
I see this every day with people that are near default, where they make up any story to buy time in hopes of
liquidating something, have a bet pay off where they can avoid catastrophe, its called "kicking the can down
the road". 
I personally think Yang has no interest in his shares and knows he won't see value from them. He has one
use for them; keep CDB from calling in additional collateral and his personal Guarantee.


Whatever value HRBN assets have he will embezzle by transferring them into his own name. SEE PUDA and
YUII


I don't buy the whole; he wont let a current $190 million share value go. Its fake inflated paper money that
cannot be monetized in any way except through a margin loan.

I believe the buyout. 
The imaginary "end game" is just another hoax. The short forces are manipulating the public in order to cover their
short positions. 
The CEO is determined to crush the shorts whom he hates so much. That's why he minds so much the stock price.

Whoever longs or shorts HRBN is gambling. When you gamble, all you care is the odd of winning. Nobody
care if the deal make any financial sense or not. Don't even waste you time reading their financial statements,
let along the ones provided by short sellers. This deal has to go through or Mr Yang will go back to rice
paddle. I'm not betting my money with HRBN, I'm betting my money with Mr Yang.

GEO, if you are so sure the buyout will fail, why don't you just allow the price to go up and short more shares. That
way you will make more money.


It's funny that keep posting same old articles almost everyday to depress the stock price, while you criticize CEO
Yang's press releases to defend the stock price.


By the way, the market seems to trust the CEO more, if you take a look at the stock price.

There are 0 shares left to short. There has not been 1 share to borrow for months now.


So adding to a short position is not possible.

The article is ignoring the fact that the buyout offer was made 5 weeks BEFORE the loan which Yang signed for went
through.


The article also ignores the fact that ABAX is putting $65mil in equity capital into the deal which they would loose
before the CDB suffered a loss. It is also not clear whether or not Barings is excercising their right to contribute equity
to the deal.

If you ever tried getting a loan in desperation you would know it takes time to get one.  
In negotiations on the loan, which would have taken place weeks or months before the loan was issued, CDB
demanded mark-to Market collateral if they were to lend HRBN the money.  
MR Yang knew he had to create "stable" paper assets to post. That turned out easy as he just sent a letter of

possible intent to buy the co out at a set price, which generally keeps the price locked at about 10% below the
buyout price.


Abax has not put one penny into the deal yet and if it does not close they will not be putting a penny up.


If the deal were to close ABAX would put up a $25 million IOU (not cash) and HRBN which also has no value.


Most importantly if you have followed the HRBN history you know that Yang owed ABAX $25 million from
years prior (see prior seeking alpha article; http://seekingalpha.co...). So maybe the $50 million LOC went to
pay ABAX back. 
Abax is helping this game along because somehow the LOC benefited them.


But be clear Abax has not put a nickle into the buyout

I am continuously amazed at the zeal with which people attack each other on this site. What is the point? Do you think
you actually affect the price and eventual direction of the stock? Why be so emotionally attached to a stock? Why is
this a personal issue? It belies a likely lack of a professional background and dilutes the value of what you post
relative to a reasoned argument/conclusion.


This is a very smelly merger arb situation, and if you dont think so, you are not paying attention. That does not mean it
wont close, but it is a very odd duck. With the stock at $21.40ish and downside likely in the low to mid single digits,
you can buy the stock (or short it) at an implied 75-80% probability of closing. You like it? Buy it. You dont? Short it.
Otherwise and in any case, shut up already with attacking each others' motives. Who cares? Stock will be at $24 or it
won't.


This is priced quite wide to normal LBO deals, which typically have wide spreads just prior to closing because you are
short a financing put until the day the deal closes, and need to be paid for it. And people are paying 100%+
annualized borrow fees to short it. So obviously some people feel strongly enough that they are willing to pay a
significant carrying fee for their position. That should give anyone who is long pause and at least investigate posts like
GeoTeam's , but if you disagree, stay long, get longer, do whatever. I'm going to be right or wrong, make or lose
money on an appropriate risk adjusted basis for my tolerance levels, and move on to the next situation.


That said, by far the craziest thing I've read in this string is that someone is shorting puts against this. You may be
right and make some money, but you couldnt pick a better way to create a monstrous disaster. There are plenty of
people who do quite well for a while shorting puts, but one day you will pay the piper. See you at the eventual bank-
managed auction of your remaining assets.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/298406-unmasking-the-harbin-electric-buyout-drama 16/28


longhrbn
I am at a loss for words. Geo Team, PLS READ THE FOLLOWING:


1. Why did the bank making the $50 million loan require CEO Yang’s personal guarantee and collateral if HRBN is the
company management claims it is? If such onerous terms were required for a $50 million loan what would they be for
a loan 10 or 15 times as large? Can we really accept the notion that the terms for additional financing so much greater
than the original loan would be less stringent? We don’t think so. 
PERSONAL GUARANTEES ARE COMMON PRACTICE IN CHINA. NOTHING STRANGE HERE


2. What end game could there possibly be for CEO Yang if the buyout intentions are not real? Why would the CEO
pursue all of the extensive steps for a buyout at such significant cost to the company and personal risk to himself? 
EXACTLY! THAT'S WHY ONE VERY LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS WHOLE DEAL IS THAT HIS
INTENTIONS ARE REAL!


3. If the buyout intentions are real, why would the CEO work so hard to keep the stock price up? What is the worst the
buyer would face if the stock price drops? A cheaper purchase price for the buyout?! The company should just leave
well enough alone. 
DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING CALLED THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE? THEY ARE THE
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO WATCH OUT FOR THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY RECEIVE A 'FAIR' PRICE, PRECISELY TO AVOID MANIPULATION BY ANY
POTENTIALLY INTERESTED PARTIES TO SCOOP SHARES UP ON THE CHEAP. SO YOU'RE FLAT OUT
WRONG. EVEN IF THE SHARE PRICE GOES TO $1, YANG WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE HIS PRICE. HE
SIMPLY CANT BECAUSE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE WOULDNT ALLOW IT. AND IF YOU'RE FALSELY
ACCUSED OF FRAUD, ANYONE WHO HAS ANY PRIDE IN HIM WOULD COME OUT AND DEFEND HIMSELF
SIMPLY OUT OF THE SIMPLE REASON TO DEFEND HIS REPUTATION AND PRIDE. IS THAT REALLY SO
STRANGE?


4. Why would a healthy company that claims to have over $80 million cash on hand take a $50 million loan at terms
that require the CEO to maintain mark to market collateral at 200% of the maximum loan exposure and provide a full
unlimited personal guarantee not only for repayment, but for the maintenance at all times of mark to market collateral
of at least 167% of maximum loan exposure? 
WORKING CAPITAL. THAT $80M CASH MAY NOT BE REAL CASH. COMPANIES DO NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS RUNNING. RAISING ANOTHER $50M TO EXPAND YOUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF
WORKING CAPITAL IS NO BIG DEAL. THE NEW LOAN IS A LOAN FOR MBO WHICH IS BACKED BY HRBN'S
ASSETS.

To everyone hoping for the buyout thinking what a bargain at $21-22 for a $24 buyout, consider the downside risk of
halted shares from a SEC investigation. Shares will re-open at $2.....your risking 90% of your funds for a measly 10%
ROI?


Even if it was just a 50/50 coin toss of a fraud or buyout your better of not backing the buyout. At the very least buy
more insurance before it tones down in a blaze of glory.


I hope China authorities at least will keep their eyes on the assets before they disappear faster then a white rabbit out
of the CEOs hat.

The buyout is not 50/50 coin toss. It is a 100% sure thing. CSR had higu short interest until the very end of

I have no position in HRBN. It does smell really fishy and I have owned puts on it in the past. I sold the puts after the
final proxy was filed (at a loss of course).


If you believe this is a fraud, it would make a lot more sense if the loan was made directly to the CEO or if HRBN lent
the proceeds from the loan to the CEO. Then he could take the $50mm, let the stock fall to zero and lose the
worthless collateral. Of course this doesn't work so well if the CEO has provided a guarantee. So you have to believe
that HRBN has misled investors to believe that Yang has provided the guarantee.

unanimous recommendation that shareholders vote "FOR" the approval of the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote

Shareholder vote is not the issue. Of course proxy advisors are going advise shareholders vote to sell and get
$24/share cash.


The issue is whether in fact banks and funding sources are really going to come up with the millions to pay to actually
close this deal.


The clock is ticking and we will all know quite soon. If deal doesn't get funded the stock is going to get crushed.

"banks and funding sources???"


it's CDB.and abax and that's it. you probably should study the deal a little better, and learn that there aren't
other mysterious anonymous funding sources, before commenting on it again.

Exactly - Will CDB and ABAX fund the escrow account to pay the tender?


I have been involved in hundreds, if not a thousand, buyout transactions in my career. I have seen them fail to
get funded at the last minute, though not by the fraud, alleged to exist at Harbin. At the current price, its a
pretty asymmetric return profile for a transaction that has this much hair on it.


21 Oct 2011, 09:10 AM


joro_ianev
Andrew, thumbs up mate, totally agree with you. The funding is the key, not this string of meaningless
'recommendations'.


21 Oct 2011, 11:18 AM


walt373
If the buyout fails, the stock will drop to maybe $5. So with the current price at $23, you have $1 in upside vs
$18 in downside, implying there's a 95% chance that the deal will close. You'd have to be a fool to make that
bet. The puts are quite cheap as well, especially considering the borrow fee to short the stock is over 100%.
March 2012 puts with $22 strike we're going for $1.35 today, representing more than 12x upside.


22 Oct 2011, 02:01 AM


walt373
What some people don't understand is that in an asymmetric situation like this, it's not whether you think the
deal will go through or not, it's how likely it will go through vs. implied odds. Even if you thought the buyout
only had a 20% chance of failure, those puts are a screaming buy, with an expected value of 140% return (0.2
* 11 - 0.8 = 1.4).


22 Oct 2011, 02:34 AM


deepthroat
not exactly -- you tossed in the "funding sources" malarkey to cloud the issue. there are only 2 entities who
are funding this -- CDB and abax (and abax's portion is tiny).


out of the 100 deals you have been in, name one in which the funding source, who has had over a year of
DD, pulled out at the last minute due to alleged fraud. if that were going to have happened here, it would have
happened a long time ago.


22 Oct 2011, 08:11 AM


Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
For me, shorting this deal here is nothing personal. Its just business and asymmetric risk/reward.


There are plenty of reasons funding sources have pulled or delayed deals. Frankly fraud at this stage hasn't
been one of them. That additional risk in the Harbin deal actually is ADDITIONAL icing on the cake of the
asymmetric risk/reward that Walter illustrated above. Let's not forget that this is a capitalistic deal in

Communist China. There is no such thing as shareholder rights, rule of law, and corporate governance in
China. This deal carries risk all the way until shareholders are wired their monies.


22 Oct 2011, 12:04 PM


walt373
If the company is in fact a fraud, then looking at the situation from Wang's perspective, I don't think the
incentives are there to go through with the deal. Why pay hundreds of millions for a company that is probably
unprofitable, when there is almost no penalty for dropping the deal? Also, once you're on the hook for $400mil
to the CDB, then it's serious. If the business is a fraud, it can't service the debt using cash flows, so the only
way Wang/Abax can pay the loan is to take the company public again on the Hong Kong or Shanghai
exchange, both of which are tanking this year, and could be in worse shape in 2012. It's too much risk to be
feasible. How sad would it be if Wang successfully defrauded everyone and still lost money? So I think it still
boils down to the question, is Harbin a fraud or not?


If I were Wang, the obvious choice would be to continue the buyout process for as long as possible, then
simply drop it when there's too much heat. There is a lot of leeway to cancel the deal, for example, if it's not
completed by March 8, 2012, it can simply be abandoned. See pages 9-10 of the merger proxy statement:
http://1.usa.gov/qkeUYY. If the deal is cancelled, there is a termination fee that Wang would have to pay
Harbin or vice versa. In other words, Wang would have to pay himself a termination fee. Not exactly an
effective deterrent.

andrew, so how much did you lose shorting HRBN? you seem like a bit player so i assume it wasn't much.

Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
Via the sale of calls with a ton of premium in them, wasn't a big position in our long biased portfolio. The huge
option premium plus multiple instances of abnormal delays, allegations, responses, etc made this an
attractive asymmetric risk/reward investment with capped downside as there wasn't going to be any higher
bid. Admittedly, that downside occurred.
