Summary


SFXE significantly missed consensus estimates in Q3.


Mysterious “Adjustments” account for vast majority of reported Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA.


SFXE’s balance sheet and heavy cash burn have continued to worsen, and we
believe the equity is worthless.


We wrote last month that we believed SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE) was a house
of cards headed towards an imminent collapse. This past quarter only further
strengthened our viewpoint, and we continue to believe SFXE is a compelling short. Our
price target remains $0 but our timeline has accelerated.


SFXE significantly missed consensus estimates


We would first like to point out that SFXE just missed FactSet consensus estimates for
both revenues and EBITDA by a very wide margin. SFXE reported Pro Forma Revenues
of $151 million, which was 9% below consensus estimates of $165 million. Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA was $15 million, which was more than 50% below consensus estimates
of $31 million. To repeat, SFXE missed EBITDA estimates by 50% during its seasonally
strongest quarter.


This is not the picture of a healthy and strongly performing company. SFXE has now
missed consensus EBITDA estimates four quarters in a row.

On the quarterly earnings call, SFXE management noted they had made $11 million of
additional investments, which impacted EBITDA during the quarter. Even if we give them
credit for the full $11 million of additional spending, SFXE would still have missed
consensus EBITDA estimates by 20%.


"Adjustments" account for the vast majority of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA


Putting aside the large reported miss, we were shocked at the size of the "Adjustments"
that SFXE added back to reported Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter's Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $15 million includes $12 million of "Adjustments." A full 80% of
SFXE's PF Adjusted EBITDA came from Adjustments, which it refused to break out.
EBITDA, excluding the Adjustments, would have only been $3 million.


According to the company, "Adjustments" include, "transaction costs, non-recurring
expenses (principally severance), cost savings, insurance recoveries related to canceled
festivals and adjustments related to content expenses."


Without a full breakdown, it's hard for us to judge what is really one-time and non-
recurring. For example, transaction costs, content expenses, and canceled festivals may
just be a cost of doing business for SFXE. Furthermore, SFXE's definition of
"Adjustments" has changed several times every quarter.


We do, however, know that SFXE has had Adjustments in every single quarter since its
IPO and that the total Adjustments eclipse EBITDA by a significant margin. In the five
quarters since its IPO, SFXE has reported PF Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million. However,
that definition includes $48.9 million of Adjustments that were added back.


If we do not give them the benefit of the doubt of the Adjustments (which happen every
single quarter), then EBITDA have been massively negative since the IPO.

Cash burn even more alarming


In our last article (here), we highlighted SFXE's significant cash burn. It appeared to us
that SFXE was headed to a liquidity event. Since then, SFXE has burned even more cash
and increased net debt even further.


It's important to note that the third quarter is SFXE's seasonally strongest period, as the
major festivals occur during the summer. We can clearly see that Cash Flow from
Operations have been negative every single quarter and the most negative in the third
quarter. If SFXE cannot generate cash during its strongest quarter, we strongly question
SFXE's ability to generate any meaningful cash flows.


Conclusion: SFXE price target of $0


We continue to believe that SFXE will go bankrupt and that the equity is worthless. There
is simply too much debt at the company; cash burn is high and net debt levels have been
increasing. We believe the risk of default is high and increasing by the day.


In addition, we believe SFXE is trying to hide the truth from investors. Its touted "Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA" includes multiple adjustments, which are large and recurring.
Furthermore, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has no correlation to actual cash flows.


Every single quarter that passes, SFXE gets closer to our mid-term price target of $0.

When the crux of an article's argument is based on comparing results to consensus, it is apparent that the author has
not done a substantial amount of his or her own research. This article may well be evidence that analysts were
overoptimistic on their timelines, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.


To those who are able to look beyond the fear mongering, remember what your investment thesis was based on in the
first place. When ticket prices increase and operating costs decrease (think headcount reduction and increased
negotiating leverage), you will likely see a substantial improvement in operating results. Additionally, an entrenched
user base offers plenty of upside via platform revenue, if not through direct monetization of products due to launch
soon. These things take time. Are all stocks on the Nasdaq profitable straight out of the gate?


Any young business is potentially a zero. The question when investing is, does the potential gain justify the risk. Look
at the EV of SFX, and look at the EV of similar companies (not just Live Nation, it is simple to draw financial
comparisons to many others). I can think of many well-known companies with dimmer prospects. Maybe the shorts
will get squeezed, or maybe they will succeed in bringing the public equity component to zero so that the debt holders
are left with all the goodies. There are too many moving pieces to call that for certain. But one thing is for sure: there
is a lot of potential in the business itself, regardless of inefficiencies in the capital markets.

Thank you Jim, you make more sense in two paragraphs than the writer does in the whole article, I don't mind a
negative article with some substance and facts to it, but this one takes the crown for lazy writing.

I was bullish on SFXE and expected that the company would at least demonstrate profitability in its busiest quarter.
But what stood out to me was the -21.6M operating loss and that the company attempted to cover this up by showing
a gain through 'remeasurement of contingent payments.' As I explained in my article, contingent payments are
payments for performance. If the company owed less that suggests one of its operating segments performed worse
than expected.


I disagree with the author that the company is worth zero. The company has a book value of $3.02 and I would feel
comfortable owning the stock at that price.

I'd expect that in the short term the stock price could go higher.

yes the guy writing the article is not thinking like a businessman, - every high risk comes with high return, and the fact
alone that the firm has beatport.com which is the only online market place for DJs is worth $3 the company is trading
at right now, so in the long run, i think it will move higher.
