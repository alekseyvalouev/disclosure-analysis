Deer Consumer Products Shares Halted After Factories Idled
Aug. 14, 2012 1:36 PM ET38 comments
by: Alfred Little


Yesterday, August 13, 2012, the Nasdaq halted trading in Deer Consumer Products
(NASDAQ:DEER) until the company has "fully satisfied Nasdaq's request for additional
information." I applaud the Nasdaq's decision, coming over a year after I first questioned
DEER here, here, and here. In today's report, I will show the likely reason DEER was
finally halted.


Background


Deer Consumer Products has reported spectacular growth in sales from its Chinese
domestic kitchen appliance manufacturing business each of the last four quarters, as well
as reiterated truly stunning 2012 sales guidance, as shown in the following table:

Subsequent to the publication of this report, on 8/30/12 I obtained evidence of a small
amount of ongoing production activity at the newer of the two Yangjiang facilities
amounting to perhaps 5% of the facility’s capacity.

Most recently, on August 3, 2012, I had an independent third-party investigator visit
DEER's two Yangjiang factories. He noted that there was no sign of any production
activities or workers other than security and maintenance personnel.


Two photos from his visit appear below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/806171-deer-consumer-products-shares-halted-after-factories-idled 3/15


The glaring questions are now:


1) How long ago were DEER's factories shut down?


2) Why were they shut down if manufacturing kitchen appliances is as profitable as DEER
claims?


3) Why was there no 8-K disclosing the factories were shut down?


4) How many historical 10-Qs and 10-Ks need restatement?


Some clues can be found in DEER's SEC filings. Consider DEER's reported headcount at
year-end reported in its 10-K filings and reflected in the following table:


According to its 2011 10-K, at 12/31/11, DEER had only 437 employees (excluding sales
and marketing staff), a decline of 78% from the prior year, despite a 29% increase in
revenue. This contradicts the growth and earnings continuously reported by DEER and
touted by Benjamin Wey of New York Global Group as the "world's largest producer of
blenders and juicers."


Likewise, DEER's reported employee welfare expenses reported in its 10-Qs have fallen
to almost nothing in recent quarters, hardly indicative of a growing world-class company
as shown in the following table:

Unable to disprove the evidence against the company, for over one year DEER has
attempted to shield itself from my allegations by filing frivolous and abusive defamation
suits to silence me. DEER's failed approach, like that of Sino Clean Energy (SCEI), will
surely end in delisting.


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.

Beautiful work Alfred. I was in China 2 weeks ago to visit DEYU and it took me 3 full days to visit all of the facilities.
Too bad DEYU has no followers being on the OTC, but wow, what a business. Can't wait to get rid of all the China
frauds so the legitimate names can thrive and head towards appropriate valuations.

This article came from Alfred Little. Alfred Little articles are written by different unknown authors, so we don’t
know who wrote this article. Also, Alfred Little is one of the many entities that have focused on bringing down,
in stock price or in whole, non-China-listed Chinese companies. I have studied many of these entities, and I
have yet to find one that does not utilize a lot of inaccurate and/or misleading information. The company
under attack may or may not be committing fraud (although a company that is under attack is more likely to
be committing fraud than a randomly chosen non-China-listed Chinese company). Whether or not the
company under attack is committing fraud, the details of the attack are very often inaccurate or misleading.


This article is misleading in that it uses Deer’s reported 2011 Q3, 2011 Q4, 2012 Q1, and 2011 Q2 year-over-
year China revenue growth rates in arguing that it is implausible for DEER's Yangjiang factories to have been
idle. Deer’s reported year-over-year overall revenue growth rates for 2011 Q3, 2011 Q4, 2012 Q1, and 2011
Q2 were not nearly as high. (They were about 33%, 19%, 43%, and 0% respectively.) Also, per Deer’s
guidance, overall 2012 2H year-over-year revenue growth will be about 26%, which is a lot less than the
projected 70% for China-only revenue.


This article is also misleading in that it fails to mention that the reported number of Sales and Marketing
employees rose from 150 to 453 from the end of 2010 to the end of 2011, as it might if the company was
experiencing increasing revenues overall and working on selling their products in China-only, versus doing a
lot of exporting. It also fails to mention that the reported number of R&D and Technical employees rose from
47 to 63 from the end of 2010 to the end of 2011, as it might if the company was experiencing increasing
revenues overall. The very large fall in the reported number of non-Sales-and-Marketin... employees from the

end of 2010 to the end of 2011 may be due to the company using contractors, versus employees, and/or for
another reason(s).


This article is also misleading in that it makes no reference to the following from Deer’s most recent 10-Q, at
least.


“The Company is not required to establish welfare and common welfare reserves. … As stipulated by the
Company Law of the PRC, net income after taxation can only be distributed as dividends after appropriation
has been made for the following:  
… 
iii. Allocations of 5-10% of income after tax, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to
the Company’s “statutory common welfare fund,” which is established for the purpose of providing employee
facilities and other collective benefits to the Company’s employees; and”


Deer appears to have not paid a quarterly dividend since 2011 Q4. Also, if the company is now using many
more contractors than employees or whatever…


In regard to the Yangjiang factories being idle, maybe they were and maybe they weren’t. It is better if a more
trustworthy source confirms this.


Furthermore, none of the statements in this article appear to have been shared with Deer for potential
clarification prior to publication, and some of them should have been shared with Deer first. For example:
“Deer, your Yangjiang factories appear to have been idle. Were they? If yes, why?” “Deer, your reported
number of non-Sales-and-Marketin... employees at the end of 2011 was far lower than it was for 2010. Why?”

Joe, when can we expect an article about DEYU.......?


If you are confident about the legitimacy just write about it.

What if DEER has a second facility?


DEER claims it no longer does non-domestic manufacturing and is totally focused on the domestic market. It would be
logical to shut down a facility.

Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Good point, and I'm not saying he's lying, but allow me to play devil's advocate and ask how exactly you could
tell those factories are "completely idle" just from those two photos.

If sales are going up anywhere from 40% to over 200% year on year, then number of units being
manufactured is also increasing by 40% to over 200% i.e. assuming that unit prices remain the same. I would
tend to think that unless the "second" facility was grossly underused, one would need all the manufacturing
facilities that one has.

Author’s reply »  DEER has two facilities, side by side, in Yangjiang. They also have a new plant under
construction in Wuhu. There is nothing else, unless they want to make something up.

And yet these are the best ones to prove the factories are idle? What would you expect to see differently in
these photos if the factories were not idle, electricity running through the wires?

If the company is no longer doing "non-domestic" manufacturing, then it would close or dispose a plant facility
outside China, since that defines "non-domestic" manufacturing. This article is about the possibility of a plant
being idle or closed in China, not outside China, which in turn is not commensurate with the large increase in
domestic sales..


If however you really mean that it no longer does non-domestic "sales", then it may be more logical to close or
idle a China based manufacturing facility that supported this export operation.


The key issue here is whether there was enough spare capacity at the other facility to the extent that it can
also support the increased level of domestic sales. From a cynical point of view, the reported sales increase is
so great that this would be unlikely, especially given the fall in staff numbers, but it is possible. Perhaps
someone knows if such spare capacity existed, or if there was substantial investment to gain this extra
capacity?


The other explanation may be that some manufacturing was contracted out and the company is playing a
larger agency role. This is also consistent with a fall in overall staff, but an increase in sales and marketing.
Again, does anyone know if this was explained to shareholders? For various reasons, a greater agency role

a good thing.

with technology today i would think we could get a full video showing that nothing was happening there time date
stamped and all.


that would be good evidence and also dont forget to show us the address.


these are bad pictures with the amount of money spent by alfred little i would think he could get something of
QUALITY. >.>


sorry does not exactly pass the smell test but DEER does not pass the smell test either so both of you are fraudulent.


deer number one problem = not transparent.


Alfred little number one problem gloats too much and 
number 2 problem embellishes too much meaning 1/2 truth 1/2 lies. mixing them together to tell what would benefit
him the most.


of course he is also in the bankster elite class so I don't trust him either way.


Deer is very questionable though. but I suggest to them to do a buyout with the funds from china bank if they are legit
and clean they would do it. that is one big red flag of suspicion.


scie as well why the hell not buyout they should know


alfred little and muddy waters are likely NAKED shorting them along with big banks in regular markets + dark pools. it
is god awful easy to tell actually.


to naked short you must be a market maker as well or have ties to them. and market makers themselves are frauds
thus should people trust these guys? maybe as a small trade.


china should already see this as financial terrorism as I have said. 
hence the bank of china loaning out money to stop the stigma. 
they can later execute the perpetrators after the buyout.


china cares about prestige right now a lot lets just say hence investing so much in Olympics etc competing for world
reserve currency if they let this go out of hand it will be harder to argue the case.


This is a financial war between usa and china right now. in my eyes 
muddy and al may be part of that group who knows.


or maybe china gov sees it as that case. hence the bank of china loans. 
too bad I suspect a buyout if the management has any clue. though these corps are not important to them imo.


only service and luxury goods company not much importance. 
now if it was resource based and important technology it would be more relevant


so whether or not the bank loans them money for buy out = how important are scei and deer to china.

will they want more stigma or loan them the money and then punish them.


being that they are so small who knows china may intervene buying them out and  
then execute the ones committing the frauds.


ps to alfred do more research and present hard evidence rather than questionable evidence.


the research is not sound

Deer markets over 200 different types of appliances. The majority of Deer's products are made by third party
manufacturers. Take a look at Jarden Corporation (JAH), which is a NYSE listed $4 billion company. Almost all of its
products are made by third party, private label manufacturers.

questionable longevity to stay in business. You have to be very careful investing in China unless they are Gov't
owned. Then the are guaranteed to stay in business and succeed.

Author’s reply »  Investors should note that even the SEC has yet to squeeze one penny out of a China fraud.
Perhaps DEER will trade again on the Pink Sheets. Perhaps DEER will announce a phony buyout. ZSTN and
CMEDY stock charts show that anything is possible. The markets are a casino in the short term. In the end,
DEER is still a fraud.

contact them by Yourselves,I put their email address below :


Thanks for investing in Deer! 
Our facility in Yangjiang is operating well. 
It is not the truth to say that our Yangjiang factory is closed.


We are communicating with NASDAQ closely to provide the information they 
request.

Were you able to short them before they were exposed?

deer might get bought our with mr hua which was an officer of bank of china. i think the fraud here is bribery of 12
million for the land ownership but the other stuff who knows.


can you get some pictures of all their sites someone said they had one in anhui in construction or production I want
pictures of the whole site if possible and pictures inside the facility with an slr would be ideal. This should silence all of
them and it being harder data.


after reading your economic times article i suggest something: at the end you mentioned: svm barring you from
chinese investigation.


For svm you can go to nux.to and silvertip mines in canada to investigate. They have mines there should be easier to
do investigation. It is Canadian territory so your people wont get killed like you suggest in the article.


also many in the mining community is correct you were wrong in your last svm article about Mr gao.


I looked at the video and found the same thing. You misinterpreted the slides with the documentation and you may
have heard wrong yourself and had a knee jerk reaction.


It is OK we all make mistakes.


but good job on the other stories.  
is it me or is it mostly the frauds are ceos stealing the companies and transferring ownership. Not exactly the financial
statements and business models?

Why in the you know what are these companies allowed to trade on an alleged free market exchange? How is it that a
Communist Country is able to infiltrate and do business in a Supposed "Free" Market system. It is beyond a joke, it is
a crime. The West condemns China for Human Rights Violations but their Companies can trade on American
Exchanges. Where is the SEC? The Federal Government etcc. to enforce this law. Oh I know. The Investment
Bankers have to make their monies on these transactions and then donate some of the proceeds to their buddies.
Every Chinese Company should be delisted, period. It is much better that the masses have to lose their pensions,
401K etcc. in Companies that shouldn't even be allowed to do business here. Who are the real
Communists/Socialists. At least we know the Chinese are outright crooks. We are fed propaganda, stolen from and
told to stand by and watch the good guys fix the mess they promulgated. Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, etcc. don't look
so bad after all. Where is the Bernie Ebbers of China hanging out? Ever hear of a Chinese Corporate officer being
prosecuted.

waiting for my last comment to post. Waiting for an answer to one simple question. Why is it that a Communist
Country who is castigated for human rights violation, pirating, conspiracy, unfair trade practices, currency
manipulations, selling arms to terrorist groups, espionage etcc. are allowed to have Companies trade on alleged
"Free" Market Exchanges? This is one of the Core elements of a supposed Capitalistic Society that promotes (what a
lie) fairness. This game sounds a little off, doesn't it? How about we play them in baseball, we will use no gloves, use
twigs for bats, get one strike per batter and they get 20 outs per inning. Now that sounds more like it. Layman's terms
always puts things in better perspective. I am thinking of taking my company public in China, What investment bank in
China do you suggest I contact to potentially underwrite the deal? Bank of MAO? It is amazing that investment
bankers, SEC , NYSE, NASD etcc. have no liability, culpability in these shams. Obviously I do not possess a PHD
from Wharton in Economics so I probably don't truly understand the nuances of these scams. Dennis Koslowski was
vilified for a company that is still doing well, legitimate and providing jobs. Gold shower curtains must be a capital
offense in any society.

can i answer your question tarp?


we can start by delisting all of mr alfred little  
jon carnes invested frauds then. shall we ask mr carnes for a list? 
i mean come on he has to have the list somewhere


if you do any research tarp even AL already admits he is jon carnes.


if you investigate eosfunds what did they do? invest in many fraud chinese companies.


I would assume AL being the great investor and investigator he is already knew they were frauds. also he
pulled out exactly almost the time of muddy waters hit pieces he probably got tipped off no?


coincidence I think not. why did AL being the great honest person he is do it before hand. take scei for
example he had someone from Deloitte he worked for before as an accountant ahem mr levington. also

accused of fraud as well. 
so many to list. anyway get the full list and try to find the link and you will see. you should probably go to each
accused messageboard and see if they have any dirt on jon carnes eos funds and alfred little for that matter.


STOP BEING A SHEEP AND INVESTIGATE FOOLS.


I think this reeks of fraud making up fraud caps and then shorting them goldman sachs style. subprime 2.0


real frauds are perpetuated by the banksters for the banksters. 
it is not just chinese. it is the whole corrupt game of wallstreet that has plagued the world at large.


it needs to end here and now. karma judgement to all banksters and frauds. 
whether it be chinese or american or anyone even Alfred little your hero.


all frauds must be exposed including Alfred little fraud = jon carnes eos fraud


also zagg = fraud? joe ramelli of eosfunds has been bashing it quite a bit last 2 years. gg shorting american
companies too I see thanks carnes.


I dont like their management being incompetent enough to get margin called but I wouldn't call a american
company fraud just yet man. sending your goons to bash it is low.


blah blah


we that researched all of yo u know unlike your sheeple following

I looked at Deer Consumer stock back to the days it was still on the bulletin board and decided to pass. Now I couldn't
say I'm more happier about that decision. I'd like to find a way to play on the consumers in China but was a little
concerned about parking my money with company management from an emerging country where the authorities from
our country had no way to holding them accountable. So I chose to put money in global multinationals that benefit
from China's growth like MCD, YUM, KO and they've done well for me.


In terms of getting our money back, has anyone considered join the class action? A private litigation is usually a much
more efficient way of getting a monetary settlement than waiting for an action from the SEC. Deer disclosed this in its
10k:


In April 29, 2011, a purported securities class action lawsuit on behalf of the purchasers of the Company’s common
stock between March 31, 2009, and March 21, 2011, James Rose v. Deer Consumer Products, Inc. et al, was filed

against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California.


In addition to suing the non-reponsive Deer management, one thing investors can do is to go after the managers,
directors and crooks that are based in the US here. In this case, the Benjamin Wey person mentioned here and
Deer's director Arnold Staloff are both based here in the States. The records of those two are not very pretty (having
involved in a number of penny stocks that later collapsed). Unlike those Chinese managers that SEC could not do
anything about, these two US citizens should be held accountable in their roles behind the stock or any lack of
oversight in the management's behavior.

That's interesting about the class action lawsuit. If you purchased the stock during the time interval noted you
will probably be included in the class action lawsuit and receive a notice about it, if it goes forward. You will
then have the opportunity of removing yourself.


I find it interesting that CHBT China-Biotics stock rose to $3 this week after it had been as low as fifty cents
following exposure of fraud and resignation of its auditor. Obviously someone with lots of money is supporting
that stock's price in the absence of real news, i.e., the price is totally manipulated.
