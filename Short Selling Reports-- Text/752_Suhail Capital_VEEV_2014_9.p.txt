Veeva Unanswered Questions: A Little Transparency Would Be Nice
Mar. 4, 2014 12:23 PM ET25 comments
by: Suhail Capital


"Three things cannot be long hidden: the Sun, the Moon, and the Truth."-Buddha


With Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) reporting earnings tonight, we thought now would be a good
time to share a list of questions that management and the sell-side should try to answer.
Getting answers to these questions is infinitely more relevant to the future valuation of the
business than the guaranteed consensus (Veeva's six underwriters at this point) 'headline
beat' the company will report, which by the way, we view as tantamount to celebrating the
fact that Michael Jordan is capable of jumping over a midget. Based on what we have
seen so far, we are not crossing our fingers on this, but you never know.


Questions for Veeva Management:


1. Realized CRM ASP @ $1,000 vs. $4,000 in 'management projections': While the
underwriters seem reluctant to do the simple math, we have calculated your average
realized selling price across your entire CRM subscriber base. This number is close to
$1,000. Do you plan on disclosing this number going forward?


2. ASP Evolution in EM vs. developed markets: We know pharma rep counts are on
the decline in developed markets. We also know they are on the rise in emerging
markets. Your penetration in the former is high, while your penetration in the latter is
much lower. In China for example, we know the ASP per LS CRM seat is 1/3 to 1/2
what it is in the United States. How should we model that impact on ASPs going
forward (12-24 months)?


3. TAM based on the above answers, how is CRM TAM still $2bln: Please explain
how you get to such a TAM for CRM. After extensive research, a best-case scenario
(albeit several years down the road) for add-ons would seem to translate into a $1,500
ASP across your user base. This is a gap of $1.4 billion (based on our conservative
estimate of 400k reps in the top 50) that we are having a very hard time reconciling. Is
there something we are missing here you'd like to share? In this highly transparent
market it is hard to grasp how such a massive discrepancy could exist!


4. How big is Veeva Vault's addressable market: Following up on the previous
question, can you clarify how you sized the LS Reg Doc Mgmt market that your Vault
product is targeting? You have publicly stated that this market is 'at least as big as
CRM'. Are we to assume that means CRM today, or what CRM fully loaded could be
one day in the distant future?

Questions for Deutsche Bank Equity Research:


1. What changed in DB's TAM assumptions for CRM, ECM and MDM, which could
decrease TAM by 60-70% in 2 months: -a) In your Veeva initiation report you sized
the 2013 LS CRM TAM at $1.9 billion. In your transfer of coverage report (2 months
later) you sized the TAM at $675 million, and went on to state that, "Veeva estimates a
total CRM TAM at closer to $2 billion." Can you explain what was wrong with your
initial report analysis that your sizing coincidentally agreed with what now is solely
being attributed to Veeva?  
b) In your initiation report you wrote, "we estimate Veeva's TAM to reach $8.6bn by
2020 from ~$5bn in 2013, an 8% CAGR." Two months later in your transfer of
coverage report you size ECM at $1.2 billion and MDM at $500 million. Add these to
your CRM and you get $2.3 billion TAM. Can you explain how the market according to
your estimates shrunk by over 50% in less than two months?  
c) Based on the above answers can you also explain how a greater than 50%
reduction in addressable market size only translated into a $3 decrease in your
share price target?


2. Do you understand how subscription revenue models work:


Your last report modeled basically flat sequential subscription revenue growth on the back
of a quarter with 22% subscription revenue growth. We understand the need to set the bar
low for clients, but this is just a little too much. Can you mathematically explain how this
happens unless you were modeling significant subscription cancellations?


a) Following up on the previous question, your most recent report also stated that,
"Veeva's first post-IPO quarter (fiscal Q3 2014, ended October 31, 2013) was solid relative
to high Street expectations." Can you please explain how flat sequential growth
amounts to high Street expectations for a company with this multiple?


3. Lastly, in your most recent report you stated that Veeva was being weighed down due
to a, "short report from November 2013 that questioned Veeva's TAM analysis as well as
the risks of building on SFDC's platform." To be clear, the analysis in question was largely
provided by DB, as Veeva has provided no analysis yet. Can you explain how you can
make such a statement?

My big concern is using "SFDC's platform" only. 
Reverse engineering VEEV software will be a long term problem.


04 Mar 2014, 12:46 PM


jiri75
@vaquero6 this is incorrect information Veeva is not pure Salesforce it also has their own cloud. Veeva has to
products 1) Veeva CRM - which is built on top of Salesforce platform major threat here is not this fact but that it uses
so called "sControls" which is a legacy piece of code retired from salesforce platform in 2011 and replaced by
Visualforce and apex language. Veeva is working hard to replace "sControls" but this thing is used heavily across the
CRM and will take several iteration as it is on many places. 2) Veeva Vault - is DMS based on cloud technologies but
it is not hosted on salesforce platform but Veeva own. Veeva Vault unlike Veeva CRM is however very niche product
focusing on delivery of regulated documentation approved by FDA and also for running Clinical Trials - which is
process before drug gets an approval from FDA. 3) Veeva Network - is another thing not linked to Saleforce as it
works like cegedim of in case of salesforce Data.com as a data service that delivers data to Veeva from centralized
database. Again reason is simple because in Pharma companies using data providers like cegedim that delivers
master data for accounts, contacts and address and hierarchies. (Example: hospital and all doctors by department
and specialisation)


04 Mar 2014, 01:26 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
My understanding is that only the business linked to CRM platform is significant and profitable, but it is also saturated
and threatened by the fact that some companies like Genentech are bypassing VEEV.


04 Mar 2014, 02:02 PM


quadrant8
Wrong again. If you have any money on VEEV -- long or short -- you should have listened to the conference
call.


04 Mar 2014, 08:39 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Of course I listened the cc and that did not change my opinion, on the contrary, I got confirmation.

From earnings call, "Subscription revenue was up 95% to $38.9 million from $20 million last year. "

Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Guess you don't understand the meaning of 'sequential'. If i turn on 10k seats a quarter they
are spread out, so i have a natural tailwind in the following quarter. To model a quarter flat(forget what it says
about your estimate at the 30x+trailing sales then) on the back of a 22% seq previous quarter is a joke unless
you are modeling in cancellations.


04 Mar 2014, 03:05 PM


quadrant8
Let me spell it out for you since you don't understand basic math. To go from $20 million to $38.9 million in
subscription revenue, the company needed to grow 24.8% every quarter.


If you want a negative twist on it, I guess can call that "flat". But I'll take the "flat" 24.8% quarterly growth
every time.


05 Mar 2014, 03:29 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Let us spell it out for you.


Veev's SEQUENTIAL revenue growth for the five quarters prior to going public


20%, 22%, 11%,8% 16%


Now the q3 consensus estimate


0%


If you understand basic math, you will grasp how any model with a 0% estimate on the back of a 16% quarter
for a sub revenue driven model and five quarter average of 15% is a total joke.


If you can explain how anyone with a 'buy' rating on a 30+ trailing ev/sales stock would have such a rating
with growth collapsing that fast in the first public quarter of the company, we are all ears.

This is why veev has been such an obvious short even if you don't have a clue about the space. Setting the
bar low here should have been 8-10%, but that would have meant no real 'BEAT' to get excited about. When
you see six analysts come in at flat, that's a red flag and a half. 
We are amazed at how many people continue to be baffled by the stocks performance simply because they
think results so far have indicated 'exceeding expectations'. Reality is those expectations to any investor with
a functional brain quickly became utterly worthless.


As for attributing Citadel's long position to ken griffin, well, you have a thing or two to learn about how giant
funds operate.

The company that really needs transparency is Seeking Alpha... this non-stop one-sided campaign against Veeva by
a short-seller is just one example. The fact they have been proven to take multiple articles from the same author
pitching a position...i.e. Galena Pharmaceuticals... makes this whole investment publication platform suspect. Its like
reading a glorified comment board.


04 Mar 2014, 03:10 PM


kpcapitalpartners
You are an idiot. Suhail is providing some much-needed oversight to the crooks...errr...the underwriters'
analysts and VEEV management, who have vastly overstated VEEV's TAM and long-term prospects. They
only need to b.s. fools like you until the Mid-April lock-up expiration! You'll then see a mass exodus.


04 Mar 2014, 04:27 PM


quadrant8
You talk TAM and you didn't hear what VEEV CEO said about TAM: not only in pharma and biotech but also
life sciences: animal health, consumer health, medical device, diagnostics and SPs like CROs.


Do the math.


04 Mar 2014, 08:30 PM


quadrant8
So since a guy like Ken Griffin increased his investment in Veeva, he must be "an idiot" and "fool" in your
book.


It is funny that you and suhail put "capital" on your names to make you sound important. Yet, you can only
hope to one day be fractionally as successful as Ken Griffin. You spread doom and gloom yet no nothing
about lockup expirations. I'm sure you made tons of money playing the YELP and FB lockup expirations,
right? ;)

@PSalerno I would not underestimate impact of Vault which is indeed new product introduced in 2012 but compared
to CRM - this taps some very critical part of Pharma business. Vault is supporting Clinical Trials that is very
complicated part on Pharma industry as it is directly linked with FDA approval and if FDA rejects your drug because
documentation is wrong damage is significant. Development of new drug costs between 1-4 billion dollar and it takes
in avg. 10-20 years. Try to imagine what would happen did your drug is not approved by FDA. Another example how
Vault is used is DMS for marketing documentation don't forget GSK was fined 3 billion USD because they delivered
information against FDA rules. Veeva Vault dealt exactly with these two problems.


04 Mar 2014, 04:10 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
jiri75 - I read the conference call. The management did not give relative numbers, but I think the better than
expected revenue could be related to Vault, and this will be present even in the next quarters as deferred
revenue is growing. Anyway there is no effect on earnings which remain 0.24EPS yearly, because Vault is not
profitable.  
I think this property platform can keep the stock overvalued for quite some time, but not enough to change the
long term bearish view on the stock.

Earnings out, is that the transparency you were looking for? Have fun covering your large short positions.


04 Mar 2014, 04:13 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Inlining - What are you talking about ?  
The countertrend rally is running out of steam after hours.


As for results they were only marginally better, but I am waiting a comment from the author.  
It is not clear how much CRM asked more for the 10 year extension in partnership.


04 Mar 2014, 04:25 PM


ibrowning85
Bro you are about to get squeezed. I have no position but Veeva is primed to pop after these results. In
addition, there is another health SaaS company IPO on the horizon in the form of Castlight Health (CSLT)
with an even more expensive valuation which in my opinion further legitimizes VEEV price. Good luck though


04 Mar 2014, 04:49 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Another IPo is another reason to keep shorting VEEV.  
There is some shortcovering now as the short interests were more than 6.6 Million and this rally could have

Sequential top & bottom-line growth (or lack thereof) are a joke when compared to any and all fundamental valuation
metrics.

Weighing Machine, Contributor
Look at the MASSIVE deceleration in revenue growth - forecast to be just 31% (at high end of range given for 2014e
vs. 2013a). Tough to comprehend how this is worth 20x forward revenue.

To the author:


Thanks for the article. A few quick questions, and perhaps your next article could help explain CRM?
(Salesforce.com)


1) Why long CRM? I've received emails from Salesforce.com pitching me their small business CRM software, and
they've been contacting me quite a bit to get the sale.


2) Why would CRM need to hire all these sales and marketing people if the product was superior and is in high
demand? I found that odd.


3) What makes it more expensive than others? Is Salesforce.com imitating the Larry Ellison ORCL model where they
get the client dependent on their upgrades and ongoing sticky monthly upgrades and tech/software/d-base support?


I don't see how growing revenues through acquisitions benefits Salesforce.com and the need to extend the
relationship with VEEV (which imo is overvalued at these levels.)


But like i try to hint (and remind) to one of my favorite authors on SA Paulo Santos (who i think is well-versed and
brilliant in fundamentally evaluating balance sheets, etc.), that is, in this strange, long QE-induced mania, many IPO
stocks and momentum stocks defy short-term logic, so just throw logic out the window (temporarily) and traditional
rational movements of stock aside, but long-term, they will all eventually revert back to the mean and become very
transparent once the dust and mania subsides.


AMZN is one of those real-life lessons i've learned as well as CRM, just to name a few. Never seen a wild market
such as this one. I am cautious now when shorting any stock in this equities climate.

Just added another new position in VEEV here. This is my third sortie on this name since the bashing started with two
solid wins. This third one I take to $50 or beyond. Downside risk here is very minimal with potential double on the
upside. My job in the market remains to make money. I am not an expert on VEEV biz model and dont have any
insider information here. So I save myself a lot of troubles from probing them. Remember market can remain irrational
longer than one remains solvent. We shall see
