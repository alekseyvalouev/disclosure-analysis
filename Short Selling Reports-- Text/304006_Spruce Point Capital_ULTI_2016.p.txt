Spruce Point Sees Many Parallels 
Between Ultimate and Caesarstone


Background On Our Interest In Ultimate Software And Why We Believe Investors Should Carefully Scrutinize Its Business


Our interest in Ultimate Software (“ULTI” or “the Company”) was initially peaked when a little-known firm called Soapbox Research published a 


skeptical report highlighting aggressive software development cost capitalization, potential revenue exaggeration, bloated stock compensation 


expense, and corporate governance concerns. Spruce Point has conducted its own independent analysis of these claims, and has 


uncovered many additional fundamental, accounting and tax-related concerns that significantly strengthen the bear case. 


ULTI’s Short Thesis Has Many Parallels With Caesartone, Our Top Short Call From 2015-2016 


One of our most successful shorts in the past few years was Caesarstone (“CSTE”), an Israeli quartz countertop manufacturer. We noted that its 


margins were suspiciously higher than its peers, and raised concerns about the potential for cost capitalization related to its U.S. plant expansion. 


We also worried about the governance structure, and influence of the Kibbutz (a communal / family-like structure). To support our short thesis, 


we conducted deep fundamental analysis and received the Company’s quartz supply contract (through a Freedom of Information request) to 


illustrate why we believed its margins were unsustainable. The parallels between Caesarstone and Ultimate Software are striking:


• Corporate Structure: While not exactly a kibbutz, ULTI heavily promotes itself as a great place to work where employees are like family. 


Family relationships run deep at ULTI. It’s CEO and COO are brothers, and its CTO is the CEO’s son-in-law. In addition, evidence suggests its 


Chief People Officer appears to have an undisclosed familial relationship with the CEO (they hold property together and have business entities 


in common). Spruce Point believes caution is warranted by investors when familial relationships and business intersect.


• Failure To Acknowledge Changes In The Competitive Env’t: We argued that CSTE’s quartz countertop products were rapidly being 


commoditized and pricing pressures were mounting, but that its executives would dismiss these concerns when pressed by analysts. Ironically, 


we find that ULTI’s executives repeatedly deny changes in the competitive landscape. Our channel checks suggest that ULTI is experiencing 


pressure from new entrants with cheaper solutions at the lower end of the market targeting small/medium sized-businesses, and larger 


competitors up-market with more robust/scalable solutions to meet the needs of larger enterprises. Not surprisingly, ULTI has shuffled its 


market targeting and market share discussion numerous times in an attempt to reposition itself.


• Revenue Concerns: Investors cheered CSTE’s consistent >20% p.a. revenue growth, but lost track of questioning its sustainability. At ULTI, 


investors are equally enthralled by its recurring revenue “SaaS” model, which allows analysts to comfortably pencil in 20% p.a. growth without 


questioning underlying assumptions. We’ve pieced together comments from management and have concerns. First, the PEPM (or price per 


employee per month) it charges customers is difficult to achieve in reality, otherwise its reported revenues could not possibly be accurate. 


Secondly, we’ve seen management deflect a discussion of its deferred revenues, a critical financial metric to evaluate a SaaS provider. ULTI 


recently changed its description of deferred revenue after a highly suspicious surge of deferred revenue in 2015. We also have difficulty 


reconciling how ULTI is growing its average revenue per customer in the face of evidence of turnover and declining total revenue per 


employee. Lastly, donations to ULTI’s Director Leiter’s foundation are based on a fixed % of ULTI’s total revenues, and are not reconciling to 


tax filings we evaluated. The discrepancies suggest potential revenue overstatement by up to 5%

Spruce Point Sees Many Parallels Between 
Ultimate and Caesarstone (cont’d)


• Suspiciously High Margins: We criticized CSTE for having suspiciously high margins >20% for producing a commodity product. Similarly, 


we note that ULTI’s Non-GAAP operating margins are suspiciously higher than its peers at >20% for a commodity-like software solution. 


These margins continue to expand in the face of competition with GAAP/Non-GAAP results widening. Similar to our CSTE research process, 


we also conducted numerous FOIA requests to obtain key ULTI contracts to support our concerns. While ULTI’s management touts its ability 


to realize pricing of $30.00 PEPM (and increase it to $40.00), recent contract pricing suggests a realized PEPM in the range of $13.00 -


$21.00 – clearly indicating heavy price discounts, never disclosed by ULTI’s management.


• Aggressive Accounting Bolstering Financial Results: At CSTE, we failed to understand why the Company believed it necessary to 


construct a U.S. manufacturing facility, and repeatedly increased its estimates for capital expenditures. In our opinion, its motive appeared to 


be to use the construction period as a reason to justify the capitalization of costs on its balance sheet, thereby inflating its earnings. At ULTI, 


we fail to understand why it aggressively capitalizes software development and R&D costs. Investors should be alarmed that ULTI is a fairly 


mature company with a commodity-like product, will have capitalized nearly $150m of costs by next year, and is now extending its 


amortization period up to 7 years - beyond any reasonable measure used by its peers. Despite these enormous expenditures, it has recently 


acquired two small companies with little revenue impact that it claims will add new product functionality. It’s possible the 100bp of margin 


dilution from the recent Kanjoya deal is just a cover-up to explain why management can’t hit its previous goal of 100bps of margin expansion. 


Another key accounting concern we believe is flattering ULTI’s margins is its rapidly escalating capitalization of long-term sales commissions. 


Based on our research, we believe ULTI pays these commission costs mostly upfront, yet its accounting method allows it to amortize costs in 


future periods (now stretching it up to 3 years). This accounting choice flatters current earnings by delaying expense recognition and 


spreading these costs over future periods. 


• Promotion of Key Strategic Partner: CSTE heavily promoted a deal it signed with IKEA to extend its distribution. Spruce Point criticized 


the deal noting it sent an inconsistent message to sell CSTE’s “premium” product through a low cost outlet such as IKEA. CSTE has 


subsequently noted significant disappointment in the IKEA deal. Similarly, ULTI has heavily promoted a “Strategic Alliance” with NetSuite that 


it says has resulted in significant bookings. Spruce Point believes investors should be cautioned given there is no contractual arrangement in 


this alliance. Furthermore, Oracle’s recent acquisition of NetSuite could seriously curtail the partnership given that Oracle is a competitor to 


ULTI. ULTI has said up to 10% of bookings recently came through NetSuite referral channels.


• Insider Enrichment: The IPO of CSTE allowed the Kibbutz to cash out almost $300m, and its CEO exercised options in early 2015 near all-


time highs before the growth story started to unravel. Using stock grants and sales to enrich insiders is another tactic used by ULTI. Investors 


should take note of the outlandish stock compensation scheme sought by management and criticized earlier this year by a Bloomberg article. 


Spruce Point is concerned that ULTI appears to be using an aggressive tax scheme tied to equity grants to avoid paying taxes. We observe 


that the delta between ULTI’s GAAP income tax expenses and actual cash taxes paid is rapidly diverging. What’s even more bizarre is that 


ULTI’s Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) are ballooning which is at odds with a company claiming to make money! Since its IPO, insiders have 


largely cashed out, and most recently, key executives started new 10b5-1 programs to liquidate shares.

Spruce Point Sees Approximately 
20% - 45% Downside In ULTI’s Share Price:


• Substantial Governance Concerns: We cautioned investors to pay very close attention to CSTE’s governance structure and potential 


conflicts of interest with the involvement of the Kibbutz. With respect to ULTI, our concerns are even greater; in our opinion, ULTI has amongst 


the worst governance we’ve ever seen. ULTI’s Board, which has an average age and tenure of 65yrs and 18yrs, respectively, appears to be 


asleep at the wheel and difficult to remove through a staggered Board classification. The current management team appears unrestrained by 


the Board in its ability to conduct outside business dealings, as witnessed by the CEO’s recent entanglement in a lawsuit against Under 


Armour – a clothing manufacturer. He has also formed numerous entities with blank-check abilities to conduct any business he sees fit,


including deals with Vivian Maza the firm’s Chief People Officer. We also uncovered an undisclosed business interest of the COO, who had an 


ownership stake and incentive to promote an ULTI partner firm named Sterling Talent Solutions. With respect to the CFO, the Board appears 


to have no concern that he holds three roles (CFO, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer) and has surrounded himself with personnel that’s 


been in place for almost two decades. Corporate best practices dictate separation of duties and rotation of employees and responsibilities in 


order to detect potential problems. No one on the Board also raised concerns that ULTI’s VP of Taxation, a key officer who now signs many of 


ULTI’s state filings (but has never been mentioned in any SEC filings), had a CPA firm registered to his home address.


• Auditor Concerns: We warned that investors should look at CSTE’s auditor because it had received citations by the PCAOB. In the case of 


ULTI, we believe investors should carefully evaluate the relationship and true independence of its auditor. We observe that ULTI’s CFO, VP of 


Taxation, and at least four other employees in key financial and accounting roles all worked for ULTI’s auditor KPMG, which coincidentally, 


was slapped with one of the largest fines ever by the Justice Dept. and IRS for helping clients structure sham tax shelters (recall ULTI doesn’t 


pay much cash taxes). At the very least, this relationship has allowed ULTI to avoid paying high audit fees. As a significant red flag, we 


observe that ULTI’s “audit-related” fees are nearly as high as its actual audit fee, which is way out of line with peers. ULTI’s Audit Chairman 


should give investors concern about active oversight. The current Audit Committee has been in place nearly 20 years, and is chaired by Mr. 


Robert Yanover. Mr. Yanover founded Lason Inc. and later was Chairman of its Board and Audit Committee member. Under his tenure, 


Lason’s executives drove the company into bankruptcy and were later charged by the SEC and US Attorney’s office with accounting fraud. 


While Mr. Yanover wasn’t implicated, investors should be concerned, nonetheless, by what occurred at Lason during his tenure


• ULTI’s Unsustainable Valuation: ULTI’s CEO frequently refers to an ULTI Bubble, perhaps an indirect reference to its share price? A 


majority of Wall St. analysts have “Strong Buy” recommendations and see an average price target of $242/sh (+29% upside). They base these 


targets on a premium multiple of revenue, and believe ULTI’s margins are accurately stated at ~20%, and its “recurring” revenue can sustain 


>20% p.a. Ironically, many analysts don’t value ULTI on a multiple of EBITDA or EPS, which in our view, bolsters our case of skepticism in the 


accuracy of the Company’s financials. By adjusting its financials for accounting distortions and cash used to mitigate excessive stock 


compensation schemes, we believe ULTI generates negative free cash flow and its operating margins are in rapid decline. Furthermore, many 


analysts have made inaccurate statements and have easy to refute bullish reasons to buy. We believe ULTI is at high risk of disappointing 


investors as it fails to capture 500+ new clients per year, struggles to grow its PEPM, and grow its total revenue per client. By applying a peer 


average 3x– 4x multiple our 2018E revenues, we see a price target of $110.00 - $146.00 (or approximately 20% - 45% downside)

Top 10 Questions For Management 
and the Board of Directors


1. Why does ULTI continue to deny the existence of changes in its competitive landscape?


2. Can you please detail why you aggressively capitalized R&D at this stage of Ultimate’s life cycle? With all the money spent 


on R&D, why are you now acquiring companies for their technology and entering into reseller agreements to boost PEPM?


3. Why do you tout a $30+ PEPM when there’s evidence that you actually receive much less? Why don’t you regularly disclose 


the average discount received for new clients?


4. Why are you aggressively capitalizing long-term sales commissions when it appears they are mostly paid upfront upon 


closing a sale? Don’t you think this distorts the true cash flow economics of your business?


5. Now that Oracle has acquired NetSuite, what real financial incentives do they have to continue this “strategic alliance” 


which is a fancy word, but not backed by any documented understanding?


6. If you are truly a cloud company, why do you deflect discussion about your deferred revenue when asked questions? Why 


did deferred revenue surge in 2015 and why was your description of deferred revenues altered in the recent 10-K?


7. Why does the rift between your GAAP and cash taxes continue to increase, while your NOLs escalate despite ULTI claiming 


record GAAP profits? Is ULTI becoming increasingly dependent on larger stock compensation incentives to keep the 


scheme going?


8. Are you too close to your auditor given both your CFO and VP of Tax worked there, along with other current employees? 


Why is your annual audit fee incredibly low, and “audit-related” fees relatively high?


9. Why did the CEO and other executives create so many blank check LLC entities recently and why is the CEO competing 


with Under Armour? Does this suggest a lack of focus and commitment to the business?


10. To the Board of Ultimate: Technology is a young man’s business and your average age and tenure is 65yrs and 18yrs, 


respectively. Would the Company be better served with some fresh independent director oversight and replacement of the 


Audit Committee which has served for almost 2 decades? Does someone need to question the status quo at Ultimate?

Significant Parallels Between ULTI and 
Caesarstone, Our Top Short Call For 2015/16


Common Aspect Ultimate Software (ULTI) Caesarstone (CSTE)


Unexplainably High Margins For 
Commodity Product/Service


Reports ~20% EBIT margins which dwarf peer 
average by 2x


Reported ~22% EBIT margins (the quarter we profiled 
CSTE), which dwarfed peer margins by >2x


Aggressive Expense 
Capitalization


Substantial capitalization of R&D and sales commissions 
may be used as a cover to prevent margin erosion.


In our opinion, promoted U.S. plant construction as a 
means to capitalize costs and prevent margin erosion. 
Former CEO recently said the new plant was now “a 
burden financial-wise”


Inability To Acknowledge
Growing Competition


CEO/CFO continue in 2016 to regularly state there’s 
been no change to the competitive landscape in the face 
of growing evidence to the contrary from new entrants


Fmr. CEO would deflect questions about competition on 
conference calls in 2015, despite substantial evidence of 
new competitive entrants and pricing pressures


Governance and 
Family Concerns


Touts “ULTI family” work env’t, with Scherr family 
members in key COO/CEO/CTO roles. Weak and 
entrenched Board governance willing to grant outlandish 
pay to mgmt. ULTI’s Audit Chair sat on the Board of 
Lason, an acct’g fraud. Baseball player with limited 
business experience also on the Board. 


Kibbutz (Israeli communal settlement with a family-like 
structure) was a significant supplier of employees to the 
company. Board dominated with individuals having ties 
to Kibbutz, putting outside shareholders at disadvantage


Irrational Valuation


Trades at a substantial premium to peers (esp. when 
normalizing its financials) on the belief it can produce 
stable 20%+ p.a. sales growth, has >20% operating 
margins, and is a best of breed company in its sector


Traded at a substantial premium to peers in 2014-15
based on belief it could produce stable 20% +p.a. sales 
growth, was a best of breed company in its sector, and 
generated sustainable cash flow


Promotion of a Key Distributor
Touts its “Strategic Alliance” with NetSuite which could 
come under pressure now that Oracle acquired NetSuite


Heavily promoted its distribution deal with IKEA which 
has failed to meet expectations


Insider Selling Ahead of Issues UTLI insiders have recently started selling shares
Fmr. CEO started selling stock in early 2015 before
business rapidly deteriorated


Auditor Concerns
Abnormally low audit fee, unusual audit-related fees for 
reports issued on “operating effectiveness of controls” 
Hiring of people between the auditor and the Company


PCAOB report on auditor had warning citations

Current Valuation and Capital Structure


ULTI’s extreme valuation reflects investors belief that it can consistently grow revenues and earnings >20% over the 


next few years and that it deserves the valuation of a “best of breed” SaaS / Cloud company. In reality, we believe its 


financial performance cannot be taken at face value, and its results are aided by overly aggressive capitalization of 


expenses to mask margin deterioration. On our adjusted financial metrics, ULTI is a wildly expensive stock with 


significant downside once investors piece the puzzle together.

Revenue Driver Analysis Suggests A 
Difficult Road Ahead For ULTI


Revenue 
Driver


Assessment Implication for ULTI


New Customers


Competition is fierce in ULTI’s commoditized service offerings. Its not 
uncommon for client RFPs to have >5 competitors. Customer retention 


tends to be sticky so there is a fierce battle for new clients. Our research 
suggests ULTI is pressured by competitors up and down market making 


incremental customer acquisition more challenging


Underlying 
Employment 


Growth


ULTI earns fees on a per employee per month basis (“PEPM”). As 
employment grows at its customers, it can earn additional revenue. 
However, underlying US employment growth has been 1%-3% p.a. 


Pricing Power
Recent contract evidence and our primary research suggests that ULTI is 


having to heavily discount contracts 20% – 60% in order to win business and 
in certain cases has guaranteed no price increases for up to 3 years


New Modules 
and Attach Rates


ULTI’s product offering contains a core HR, payroll, and benefits solutions. It 
also offers additional add-on modules. On average it says clients take 5 


modules. ULTI has been spending heavily on R&D but hasn’t been able to 
introduce many new modules since 2014. Its acquisitions of Kanjoya and 


Vestrics suggest desperation to deliver new offerings to its clients. Its attach 
rates have remained relatively stable since 2013. Recent reseller 
arrangements also may signal difficulty introducing new modules


Impact on 
Overall PEPM


Coming into 2015, ULTI said its fully-loaded PEPM was $30, and its goal is to 
drive this to $40 over the next few years. Overall, we believe this headline 
PEPM should be taken with a grain of salt given that actual pricing remains 


at a significant discount in the market place

Management Head in the Sand?
ULTI Never Sees Increased Competition


Analyst Marcon Q1’16 (April 2016): “With regards to the competitive environment, are you seeing, like, some of the newer players at all in 


terms of like a Paycom or Paylocity, they typically have smaller clients, but just wondering if you're seeing them at all on the fringes?”


CEO Response:  “No. We see them single-digits and I would not call them new, they've been around for years.”


Analyst Furby Q2’16 (July 2016): “I guess first for Scott, I'm wondering if you could compare the competitive dynamics you're seeing in the 


midmarket and the strategic as it relates to the enterprise?”


CEO Response: “Competitive dynamics, I think, remain the same.”


Question at Opco Conf (Aug 2016): “So, I think the question is from the competitive landscape, has anything really changed over the years”


CFO Response: “Let me give you the short answer. The competitive landscape has not changed.


Analyst Kumar Q3’16 (Nov 2016): “Can you discuss the current competitive dynamics you're seeing in the mid-market and the enterprise. Are 


you seeing any differences in win rates across these markets?


CEO Response: “No. It's been pretty consistent with what we've always said in the past”


ULTI’s management repeatedly denies changes in the competitive landscape. 


Based on our research view, these statements are unlikely to reflect reality.

“The cloud is a core of SAP’s future growth, and the combination of SuccessFactors’ leadership team and

Lots of consolidation in the ERP and HR cloud solutions industry and many strategic players are backed with deep-pocketed 


private equity players. In 2011, Reuters reported that UTLI was looking to sell itself and hired an investment bank but the 


company denied the news. As of today, insiders have recently implemented a new 10b5-1 stock sale program, which could 


suggest there are no imminent buyers of ULTI.

Warning: ULTI Keeps Reclassifying Its 
Target Market and Share…


ULTI has reclassified its target market four times since 2013, most recently in Q2’16 


• On the surface, it appears clear that ULTI is struggling to define what its target market should be or responding to 
competitive changes in the marketplace (recall that management denies any changes)


• The company started with two, expanded it to three, and now has four segments….


• From our field research, we believe ULTI will have difficulty going much farther down market to smaller businesses, where 
the competition intensifies and some offer very low cost / free solutions. This view is supported by the fact that ULTI no 
longer points to firms under 300 employees within its “Strategic” classification


• Going further up market may also pose challenges for the scalability of ULTI’s solution, and is equally competitive because 
the bigger accounts with higher deal values are hotly contested

NetSuite Alliance: A Material Revenue 
Driver, Could Disappear


ULTI and NetSuite announced a strategic alliance in Q1’15 that ULTI claims has become a material revenue source (5-10%), 


although ULTI has never put a single word of this material alliance in its SEC filings. Oracle’s recently completed acquisition of 


NetSuite in Nov 2016 casts a shadow over the sustainability of existing and future revenue streams from the partnership, since 


Oracle has a competitive solution. Also, the NetSuite/ULTI alliance is not contractual.  We believe the current risk of the alliance 


dissolving is not adequately discounted into ULTI’s current share price.


Press Release March 25, 2015: “...Announced today a strategic alliance to integrate the UltiPro HCM solution and the NetSuite ERP suite, giving businesses 


the ability to manage their entire business lifecycle—from financials, supply chain, and customer relationship management (CRM); to payroll, HR, and talent 


management…In addition to Ultimate announcing its integration of UltiPro HCM and NetSuite’s cloud ERP platform, the two companies are now partnering to 


provide each other’s customers solutions in the HCM or ERP space. ”


Q1 2015 CFO (April 2015): “Well I think I think it's going to help us get to billion dollars in ’18 and I think it'll be just another channel we have, it's a good 


channel, it make sense and I think it's just growing into a billion dollar revenue company and then from a billion you know obviously we have to go to 2 billion. 


So I think you know we're building all the foundation now to make it better every day and I think it'll be a big asset for both companies in growing both?”


Q3 2015 Analyst Baldry: “Last quarter you called those NetSuite as I’ll call it the best partnerships you’ve ever done. Sort of curious if you’ve got any updates 


on how that’s going. I think last quarter you noticed there were six deals closed and over 100 in the pipeline. So it seems like that could have a pretty good 


acceleration maybe that’s part of the really strong outlook for ’16. If any more color there, thanks?”


CEO Response: “It’s still the best partner we ever had. I think it’s just going to keep getting better and better as we move forward. We are getting deals from it, 


they are getting deals from us. I said the number last time because I got it because it was really the first quarter after. I really don’t even have the number. I just 


know that there were deals in the quarter that we got from them. I know they got deals as well from us. I just don’t know the exact is, but it’s a 100% all positive.”


CFO at Needham Conf (Jan 2016): “So the question was how does our relationship with NetSuite impact when we are competing against, say, a company that 


is selling an ERP, and that's a good point. So we have a relationship where we go to market together on leads. There's no money that goes either way.”


CFO Comment in Q1’16: “Yeah. It's trending up. I said at the beginning – in the first year, we did it kind of like the first nine months. I think 5% of our business 


was from partnering with NetSuite and my goal this year and I think Zach's was that hopefully we can get 10%, as well as I know, he has his goals. But we 


were over – a little over 10% of our first quarter sales came through some partnership with NetSuite”


CEO Comment in Q2’16: “And on NetSuite, it's been a great partnership. We mentioned before last year the 5% of our annual recurring revenue that was 


sold was somehow related to our partnership with NetSuite. And year-to-date, the first six months 12% of our business that we sold was somehow 


related to our partnership with NetSuite. And I believe – well, I know on the NetSuite side, that dollar amount, they got equal dollars on their side that we got 


on ours. So I’m  really happy with the partnership. I couldn't be happier with the partnership. And I believe and hope Zach feels the same way.”

Question Marks In the NetSuite Dialogue 
From ULTI’s Management


The strategic alliance was announced at the end of March 2015, yet according to ULTI management is off to a roaring, frictionless start. ULTI 


already began booking deals associated with the alliance in Q3’2015 according to management and had revenue in Q1’16


CEO Scherr on Q3’16 Conf Call when asked about the slowdown reported by NetSuite: “We had an acceleration from Q3 last year. We were actually up 


50% in the business that we got Q3 this year versus last year. I think also a lot of it is salesperson to salesperson. I mean, there is management managing it, 


but the relationships are set. It's a good deal for both sides. So, and as far as that, I haven't heard one negative thing from my salespeople or my sales 


management about the NetSuite deal.”


When asked for clarification from analyst Bora about the 50% being bookings: “We did 9% of our business in the quarter, came from our relationship 


with NetSuite”… “But the 9% we got this year, the dollars associated with that 9% was 50% more dollars than it was Q3 last year.”  


Also its noteworthy that a year earlier in Q3’15 the CEO had no clue what the numbers were: “I really don’t even have the number. I just know that there 


were deals in the quarter that we got from them. I know they got deals as well from us. I just don’t know the exact [number], but it’s a 100% all positive.”


So the CEO is suggesting they were potentially booking deals as early as Q3’15 - which seems like a quick start to the new alliance. Also, stated 


implementation times until booking of revenue is 5 – 9 months per management. 


CFO Comment (DB Conf. Sept 2016): “We don't begin recognizing recurring revenue until the customer goes live. And in the mid-market, and strategic 


market that probably averages about five months from when a customer signs. And in the enterprise market and global enterprise, it's probably about eight 


months or nine months.”


The revenues associated with NetSuite are recurring according to the CEO, but when asked if they are baked into 2017 expectations, CEO Scherr 


said no! How is this possible given ULTI also touts high visibility into its recurring revenues?


CEO Comment in Q2’16: “And on NetSuite, it's been a great partnership. We mentioned before last year the 5% of our annual recurring revenue that was sold 


was somehow related to our partnership with NetSuite. And year-to-date, the first six months 12% of our business that we sold was somehow related to our 


partnership with NetSuite.”


CEO Comment in Q3’16: “I mean, right. I don't know anything if the deal is going to happen or not. We did 9% of our business in the quarter, came from our 


relationship with NetSuite. It's not baked in our 2017 numbers and we're going to do our numbers regardless of the NetSuite deal or not, obviously it's a 


good deal for us. I want it to continue and don't see why it wouldn't continue.”


CEO Comment also in Q3’16: “It's almost every year since I can remember we've been going into visibility within the mid 90s when we – or low 90s when we 


guide in October, I don't see what would change that”

ULTI’s Senior SVP, Strategic Alliances 
Just Resigned….


If ULTI’s strategic alliance with NetSuite is going so well, why did Jim Jensen ULTI’s VP – Strategic Alliances just leave the 


company in May 2016 according to his Linkedin profile?


According to his bio, and ULTI’s Annual Report from 2000, he’d been with the company for 18 years


Jim Jensen LinkedIn profile


From the Miami Herald (Feb 2016): Jensen was employee No. 33 when he joined Ultimate Software 21 years ago, hired to run 


the development team creating the next products companies would use to run their companies. “It’s been an incredible ride,” he 


told the Sup-X audience Wednesday in a Broward County Convention Center ballroom, where he was a keynote speaker. 


A few months later he left for Ceridian…

Through various Freedom of Information and Open Records requests, Spruce Point has obtained primary evidence to suggest that 


ULTI’s highly promoted $30+ PEPM is not easily achieved in practice – only 1 out of 6 contracts obtained were in this price range. In 


the tables below, we find the majority of PEPMs ranging from $13.00 - $21.00;  We conclude that heavy discounting is occurring 


and investors would be better served with more information from management about these practices.

Divergent Productivity Views Indicated From ULTI’s Own Reporting


• Our research suggests ULTI appears to be focusing more efforts on smaller 
companies in the midmarket and strategic segments.  Surely, smaller companies 
cannot have the same total spend as large enterprise clients are spending; 
ULTI gets paid on a per employee basis


• ULTI’s data shows sales per avg. employee declining, and revenue per avg quota 
sales rep up just 3.8% p.a. yet somehow sales per avg. customer is +13% p.a.


• CFO Quote on JMP Conf (March 2016): “But again, our way of growing revenues 
without spending 50% of revenue on sales and marketing is to grow productivity per 
salesperson. And you do that, because you add more stuff that you can sell and you 
get an attach rate. You sell to larger companies, on average, which this year, the 
average size went up and then you add more salespeople, which we started 2014, 
2015 with 92.

Warning: Ultimate Stopped Giving Granular Detail About its Workforce in its SEC Filings After 2009:


“As of Dec. 31, 2009, Ultimate employed 989 persons, including 132 in sales and marketing, 162 in research and development, 76 in product 
strategy, 316 in solution deployment and training, 262 in shared services including Intersourcing and customer support, and 41 in the HR, 
finance, and legal groups.”  (Source: 2009 10-K, p. 9)

Underlying Problems on the Sales Team Suggested By Subtle Comments Made By the CEO/CFO 


• CFO at JMP Conference (March 16): “And enterprise did what we expect them to do. The average tenure of the salesperson in enterprise is 
over 10 years. So, it was all good“


• CEO on Q2’16 call (July 16): “The enterprise sales team, the average tenure is eight years…We have very low turnover”


• Something Doesn’t Add-Up: It’s worth noting there was no increase in quota salesmen between Q1 and Q2 at 120 which suggests that 
tenured enterprise sales team members left the company!


ULTI Now Touts “Virtual” Workforce:  “We have 37% of our head count virtual, and we're up to 3,400 employees roughly. And it's 
funny, our employee count and our customer counts tend to be or about the same” (Source: CFO at Oppenheimer Conf. on Aug 9, 2016)

Here’s What The Competition 
Says About ULTI….


Based on Spruce Point’s field research, the sentiment is that Workday is the player to beat in the industry and has 


been moving down market to increasingly compete with ULTI. However, ULTI’s CEO has steadfastly claimed it 


competes with Workday on just 10% of the deals (1). Workday’s Analyst Day presentation heavily dismisses ULTI 


as a real competitor, and even questions whether it is a pure-play cloud company.

their organization is planning on implementing an HRMS system, ULTI  came dead last of the major 


players considered for selection. Workday was the overwhelming favorite.

Management’s annual cash inventive is tied to its ability to exceed Non-GAAP Operating Income. It’s evident 


from the table below that prior to 2011, management had difficulty hitting its performance targets and earned 


no bonus. Post 2012 in the period coinciding with aggressive capitalization of R&D expenses and other 


accounting changes, we observe that management began exceeding its targets and earnings cash bonuses. 


In fact, the cash bonuses earned per $ of target outperformance has increased in recent years.

Evidence Suggesting That ULTI’s Financial 
Model Isn’t As Good As It Appears


ULTI touts stable growing earnings and strong operating cash flow, but digging beneath the surface, the picture 


isn’t as rosy as it appears. By looking at its diluted share count, we find annual dilution of approximately 4.2%. 


Furthermore, ULTI’s balance sheet doesn’t tell the whole story because it lists capital leases of just $8.2m. By 


looking more closely at its footnotes discussing contractual cash obligations, we find that its cash obligations 


have doubled in the past few years.

ULTI Touts Practically 
Meaningless PEPM Figures


Analyst Q4’15 Call (Feb 2016):  “Also, if I can, on the product roadmap, is there -- if you could remind us, if there is any eminent dates [ph] for 


any of your modules that are coming up? And what would be the top one or two areas that you might be focusing on in 2016 from a product 


development standpoint?”


CEO Response:   “I didn’t really get the middle of -- their job is to get us from $30 to $40 over the next few years. And right now I know 


there is on the training side, we’re working on the training side. And I think that will be the next thing that we probably introduce to some 


training solution sometime this year, that will be the next thing. There are other things we’re working on but I really don’t want to get into them. 


But if we were to introduce something, I wouldn’t be surprised of it was some training application.”


Analyst at JMP Conf (March 2016): “So, you’d like to go from $30 to $40 over how long? It’s two years?”


CFO Response: “The goal is 2018. Yeah”


Analyst Upton Q3’16 (Nov 2016):  “Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the last one, you mentioned that you're more 


than 90% of the way there. Does that mean you're somewhere around $36 in PPMs?”


CEO Response:  “Yes, $37.”


Take Notice: Immediately after making these statements, CEO Scherr and the rest of the executive team starting selling stock


CFO Comment at CS Technology Conf (Nov 2016): “We did add a product that we acquired and one that we are reselling that raised our 
PEPM opportunity from $30 to $37. So that creates opportunity to create productivity. And that was sooner than we had expected.”


Take Notice: The CFO admits that ULTI is now reselling a new product, which we view as a weaker form of revenue toward reaching 
its PEPM goal


Part of ULTI’s pitch to investors to how it can get to $1 billion in revenue is that it can grow its PEPM from $30 to $40.


Spruce Point believes these figures to be practically meaningless. Based on our research, and contract discoveries, 


ULTI’s realized PEPM is actually 20% – 60% less as a result of discounts offered to clients in competitive situations 


(next slide). Also, the CFO recently clarified that part of the recent PEPM increase comes from a reseller arrangement, 


but he doesn’t want to provide investors any more details. Given our concerns about heavy R&D expenditures and 


capitalization, investors should view ULTI’s need to enter into reseller deals to boost PEPM as a major red flag.

Based on Spruce Point’s research, ULTI’s PEPM has to be much lower than disclosed for its recurring revenue to be 


closer to reported levels of $620m in the LTM 9/30/16 period.

Netsuite Salesforce

For a healthy cloud company, deferred revenue growth should track reported revenues. ULTI’s deferred revenue growth had been 


declining from 2010 – 2014 while revenue growth had been increasing / stable. Then in 2015, its deferred revenue growth rapidly 


surged – this pattern deserves closer scrutiny.

Management Deflecting Questions….


Q3’15 Earnings Call, Analyst Alex Zukin :  “And Mitch, we saw another big sequential uptick in the short-term deferred and the even bigger 
uptick in the long term deferred. I was just wondering if you could drill in to the cause of that.”


ULTI CFO Response:  “It has to be a function of strength in booking. I know I normally stay away from commenting on deferred because we 
don’t want to get you guys back in the habit of looking at things the way you calculate because they don’t work for us. But that is the 
primary reason. As far as the long term, we had two unique situations with customers who wanted to pay in advance for several years.”


Needham Conference (Jan 2016), Analyst Berg:  “Sure. If we go back to the third quarter results, since we're kind of on initial start there, is 
deferred revenue growth is not a great proxy always for your business based on how you invoice customers, right? But deferred revenue was 
up 24% year-over-year in the quarter, which was your best year-over-year growth metric in about five years. Can you talk about kind of where 
that strength comes from specifically? For you, what does that indicate about the sales environment?”


ULTI CFO Response:  “We've always told investors don't pay attention to the deferred revenue in the billings calculation that you guys 
normally do because we have activation fees running through there and they don't run in the same kind of pattern. It's just layering on 
subscription revenues.”


Q4’14 Earnings Call, Analyst Nemeroff: “And then one for Mitch, if I may. So, Mitch, if I look at the deferred in the quarter, really strong 
number, actually stronger than it was in Q3. Since calculated billings since you've said in the past that it's not a really great proxy for the true 
bookings in the quarter, how should we take that number in relation to that 56% bookings ARR that Scott just mentioned?”


ULTI CFO Response: “Yeah. I would say that with that caution, we ask you not to focus on the billings number, but like I said last quarter, 
when you do have strong sales quarter, it is going to inflate that percentage. It's going to – I shouldn't say inflate, it's going to be reflected 
in that. So the bottom line is your billings calculation does reflect the strong billings Scott talked about – strong bookings Scott referred to in 
this quarter and during the year”


During multiple questions, ULTI’s CFO tries to deflect analysts’ concerns, but notes two unique situations 


where customers wanted to pay several years in advance - why would they want to do that in the absence of 


significant incentives?

Ultimate Quietly Changes Its 
Deferred Revenue Description


New Deferred Revenue Discussion (As defined in 2015 10K) 


“Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for recurring revenues for cloud services which are recognized over 
the term of the related contract as the services are performed, typically 24-36 months and commencing with the related 
Live date; and implementation consulting services for which the services have not yet been rendered which are primarily 
recognized prior to the respective Live date.


Previous Deferred Revenue With Changed/Omitted Disclosures in Red (As defined in 2014 10K) 


Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for recurring revenues for cloud services which are recognized over 
the term of the related contract as the services are performed, typically two years; maintenance services which have not 
yet been rendered which are recognized ratably over the related annual maintenance period; implementation 
consulting services for which the services have not yet been rendered which are primarily recognized prior to the 
respective Live date; and subscription revenues which are recognized ratably over the base term of the related contract 
upon the delivery of the services.


After all the questioning of deferred revenue, ULTI made changes to its deferred revenue description 


when it filed its 2015 10K in February 2016.


This should be a warning sign since management didn’t discuss any underlying changes to its business.

More Strong Evidence To Suggest 
Potential Revenue Overstatement


ULTI had an arrangement with its director Al Leiter whereby it would donate 0.1% of revenues up to $200k to Leiter’s Landing 


Foundation. The IRS recently made charity tax filings more accessible (1). Upon our review, we found inconsistencies that suggest 


potential revenue overstatement. ULTI abruptly ended the donations in June 2012. Coincidentally, we observe that 2012 is the same 


year ULTI started its aggressive software development cost capitalization and its management started exceeding bonus targets.

Short Term Long-term % Long-Term / Total Deferred Sales Commissions


$ in mm


Deferred sales commissions are an aggressive accounting tactic used by software technology companies to bolster 


earnings. We believe ULTI’s sales commissions are generally paid shortly after execution of a client contract, yet it 


defers the cost on the balance sheet, and recognizes the expense in the future. The justification for this practice is that 


the sales commission cost should be matched against the revenue. We would be inclined to buy this argument if ULTI 


did in fact pay the commissions in future periods, but we don’t believe this to generally be the case.


ULTI’s accounting practice deserves significant scrutiny because a growing % of these costs are being capitalized as 


long-term other assets. Total deferred commission costs have been growing significantly faster than revenues.

Beware: Looser Amortization Policy


“Ultimate’s financial statements include prepaid expenses and other current assets which include prepaid 


commissions on cloud sales. Prepaid expenses are amortized over the life of the asset (typically within one 


year) and commissions on cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24-


36 months) typically commencing on the day the customer processes its first live payroll using UltiPro (also 


referred to as going “Live”), which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition. The portion of 


prepaid commissions that extends beyond one year is classified in other assets, net, in the consolidated 


balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.”  (Source 2015 10-K, p. 52)

Pay close attention. ULTI changed its initial contract term dictating its amortization period from 


24 months to 24 – 36 months.

ULTI’s R&D expense capitalization, particularly among larger SaaS companies, is abnormal. This should be a red flag 


warning, especially since its product is fairly commoditized and mature in nature. The chart in the bottom left also 


indicates that ULTI has a growing dependence on capitalization. 


The Company will have capitalized over $150m of costs through 2017.

Amortizing Software Costs Too Slowly…


Source: ULTI Financial Filings


Recall on the previous slide, we showed that ULTI has capitalized $111m of costs since 2012 (and expects over $150m through 


2017). Yet, it has amortized just $2.7m over the same period, or just 2.5%! This should be considered a major red flag given the


rapid product development cycles for technology. ULTI appears to want to capitalize, and delay or avoid amortizing costs 


indefinitely, even though accounting rules specify that expense recognition must occur post-implementation or after it’s no longer 


probable a software project will be completed.


Pay Attention:  ULTI Notes A Change of Accounting (2013 10-K p. 53): 


“We previously capitalized software costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 985-20, Costs of Software to 


Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. Those capitalized software costs were fully amortized as of December 31, 2013.” 


“In addition to capitalizing costs for software (which are used by us in our general operations, for internal purposes), we also capitalize costs 


under ASC Topic 350-40 for certain software development projects related to our suite of products sold to our customers exclusively on a 


subscription basis under our software-as-a-service offering of UltiPro.”


Amortization of Software Development Costs


Now ULTI Appears To Be Using Acquisitions And 


Signaling More Needs For Capitalization (10Q):


Kanjoya:  “Kanjoya's workforce has joined Ultimate and will 


serve to establish an additional research and development 


hub for us in San Francisco”


Vestrics:  “Since the developed predictive technology 


acquired pursuant to the Vestrics Acquisition will be 


included in the development project currently being 


capitalized as internal-use software to be offered as a cloud 


product in the future, amortization of the Vestrics developed 


technology will begin when it is ready for its intended use”

2007
Capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives 


of the assets, which are typically three years.


2009
Capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives 


of the assets, which are typically five years.


2012
Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally 
three to five years, commencing after the software development is substantially complete and 


the software is ready for its intended use.


2013-
Present


Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally 
three to seven years, commencing after the software development is substantially complete and 


the software is ready for its intended us


Paycom 2015
Expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized 


over a three-year period on a straight-line basis.


Paylocity 2015 Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 to 24 months


Cornerstone 2015
Capitalized software costs are amortized to cost of revenue using the straight-line method over 


an estimated useful life of the software of three years, commencing when the software is ready 
for its intended use.


NetSuite 2015
Internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over 


its estimated useful life, generally three years.


ULTI’s amortization period for capitalized software has consistently changed, originally 3 years to now 5 to 7 


years. Based our analysis, this amortization period is grossly off-market with most peers choosing to amortize 


costs over no more than 3 years.

Is ULTI Covering Up Margin Problems 
Through Recent Kanjoya Acquisition? 


(1) The average customer increase over the past five years (2011-15) was just 200 per annum. The CFO is aggressively suggesting ULTI can double this performance. As an 


additional note, at the Raymond James Technology Conference (12/17/16), the CFO suggested 500 – 700 new accounts 


Spruce Point has a history of successfully cautioning investors to be wearisome of companies that use acquisitions 


to paper over problems. In the case of ULTI, it has regularly guided investors to expect 100bps of margins, and has 


infrequently completed acquisitions. The recent deal to acquire Kanjoya caught our attention for the following 


reasons: 1) ULTI is essentially buying revenue-less technology despite substantial R&D expenditures (aka more 


capitalization of R&D through acquisition accounting), and 2) the deal gives UTLI an excuse why it won’t hit its 100bp 


margin expansion target since the Kanjoya deal is conveniently dilutive by 100bps.


CFO on Q3’16 Call Commenting on the Kanjoya acquisition: “While the acquisition 


increases our PEPM opportunity for the future, Kanjoya's existing clients do not add any 


meaningful revenue to 2016 or 2017. Also as expected, the acquisition comes along with 


some initial cost burden to us. We estimate the impact on our Q4, 2016 and our 2017 


operating margin guidance to be just under 100 basis points.”


CFO at JMP Conference March 2016: “I don't know. In our world, we look at what are 


our goals. Our goals are to get through $1 billion of revenue in 2018, increase operating 


margins probably in the range of about 100 basis points a year. We do that by adding 


about, I'd say, 400 companies to 500 companies – new companies a year.” (1)

Peer Analysis: LTM Stock Comp Expense / Avg. EmployeeULTI’s Growing Stock Comp Dependency


Analysts and investors have often fiercely debated what it is the “Cost” of employee stock options and stock-based 


compensation. Companies such as ULTI would love investors to ignore these costs. We believe ULTI investors should 


pay very close attention to them, especially because its stock compensation expense has been rapidly escalating in the 


past few years and there has been a real cash cost associated with these expenses as we’ll illustrate on the next slide.

Using the Cash Flow Statement To 
Obfuscate Operating Costs


Pay close attention to payments made through the “financing” section of the cash flow statement. ULTI shows 


significant cash outlaws related to shares acquired to settle employee tax withholding liabilities.


Employment costs are clearly operating in nature, yet ULTI wants investors and analysts to ignore these costs 


when evaluating its business. We also view ULTI’s repurchases of common stock as a tactic to mitigation 


dilution from issuing stock to its employees.

A total of $128m of cash has been spent to settle employee tax withholding liabilities.


A figure of this size cannot be dismissed as simply a financing cash flow.


Given that it’s tied to employee compensation, it should be viewed as an operating cash flow.

$ in mm $ in mm


Investors should heavily scrutinize ULTI’s tax policies. The Company has paid $5.8m of cumulative cash taxes since 


2003 in the same period where it reported $72.6m of GAAP income tax expense. The rift between its GAAP taxes and 


cash taxes hit an all-time high in 2015 (right-hand chart). ULTI’s Net Operating Losses (NOLs) also continue to grow 


during this period, and a majority are tied to its stock compensation schemes (left hand chart). Doesn’t it appear odd

In our opinion, ULTI’s free cash flow should not be taken at face value. The Company is running substantial 


payments to employees for tax withholding as financing cash flows. In reality, payments to employees are 


operating in nature and should be deducted from cash flow. As we previously illustrated, ULTI has experienced 


4.1% share dilution over the long-term as a result of paying its employees. If we further adjust its free cash flow 


to account for this, we find not only are ULTI’s margins declining, but also they recently turned negative.

Spruce Point has serious concerns about ULTI’s Board. The average age of ULTI’s board is 65 years. There’s been only 1 new 


appointment in the past decade - former baseball player Al Leiter. The Board is classified, which disadvantages shareholders 


and makes affecting change difficult. There are three classes of directors serving three year terms. 


The audit committee is entrenched for almost 20 years. We believe shareholders would be served with better oversight.

Insider Selling…


Earlier this year, Bloomberg called out ULTI and its CEO for its questionable pay practices in an article entitles “The $38 


Million CEO Who Out-Earned His Company Last Year.” Spruce Point agrees with the critics who chastise ULTI’s pay 


package, and we think investors and analysts will be even more outraged by the pay when they critically analyze ULTI’s 


aggressive accounting and tax practices, which we believe are masking fundamental deterioration. Not surprisingly, all 


insiders have been net sellers this year – most aggressively CEO Scherr sold 280,000 shares in November (1,2).


“ISS and Glass Lewis have called out Ultimate multiple times for equity grants that aren’t tied to performance, golden 
parachutes that pay out even if executives aren’t fired in an acquisition and potential reimbursement of tax bills on 
those payouts.  “Almost unsurprisingly, we note that executive compensation and corporate performance were again not 
aligned,” Glass Lewis wrote in its report last year.”

CEO Scherr Has Numerous Outside 
Business Interests


ULTI investors should be concerned that its CEO Scott Scherr doesn’t appear to be fully focused on its business. As 


illustrated below, Mr. Scherr has recently created two business entities for “Any and All Lawful Business” – essentially 


blank check companies. In addition, he appears to have created a side business with his daughter Casey Scherr called 


Ass Armour, which is being sued by Under Armour.

Warning: CFO Dauerman’s Combined 
Roles Lack Separation of Duties


ULTI’s investors should be concerned that Mitchell Dauerman holds the combined role of CFO, Treasurer and Chief 


Accounting Officer. He has held these combined roles going all the way back to ULTI’s IPO (Source: S1). In our 


opinion, for a company of ULTI’s size, we believe there should be separation of duties and more oversight in the 


finance and accounting roles. Separation of duties is often cited as a best practice for preventing financial issues.


It’s also worth noting that Mr. Dauerman was a partner at ULTI’s auditor.


Dauerman’s Biography Omits That He Is the Principal Accounting Officer


“Mitchell K. Dauerman has served as Executive Vice President of Ultimate since April 1998 and as Chief Financial Officer 


and Treasurer of Ultimate since September 1996. From 1979 to 1996, Mr. Dauerman held various positions with KPMG 


LLP, an accounting firm, serving as a Partner in the firm from 1988 to 1996. Mr. Dauerman is a Certified Public Accountant.”

Robert Yanover: ULTI’s Audit Chairman 
Deserves Greater Scrutiny


Mr. Yanover is currently Chairman of ULTI’s Audit Committee. He was also Chairman of the Board of Lason, Inc. and sat on its 


Audit Committee according to its proxy statement from 2000. In 2001, Lason filed for Ch 11 bankruptcy and its executives were 


later charged with fraud. While not implicated in the scheme, ULTI investors should question Mr. Yanover’s suitability for the his 


current role as Audit Chairman.


According to Mr. Yanover’s Biography in ULTI’s Prospectus:   


“Robert A. Yanover has served as a director of Ultimate since January 1997, is Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board and is a 
member of the Compensation Committee of the Board. Mr. Yanover founded Computer Leasing Corporation of Michigan, a private leasing 
company, in 1975 and served as its President from its founding until 2007, at which time Mr. Yanover retired. Mr. Yanover also founded 
Lason, Inc., a corporation specializing in the imaging business, and served as Chairman of the Board from its inception in 1987 until 
1998, and as a director through February 2001. Mr. Yanover brings to the Board his experience and strong business and leadership skills, 
having served as president and chairman of public and private companies for over 30 years. In addition, having served as a director of 
Ultimate for the past 16 years, Mr. Yanover brings to the Board deep institutional knowledge, including a well developed understanding of 
Ultimate’s business operations and the fundamentals essential to our business model.”


Scheme To Defraud


“From approximately 1997 until approximately early to mid 


2000, several Lason officers and employees knowingly 


devised, executed, and participated in a scheme to defraud 


and to obtain money by means of materially false and 


fraudulent pretenses and representations. 19. It was a part of 


the scheme that Lason would make materially false and 


fraudulent representations in its financial statements to 


manipulate and increase its reported revenues and earnings 


per share. It did so principally, but not exclusively, through 


accounting practices referred to at Lason as “Tailwind” and 


through the fabrication of “WIP,” a component of Lason’s 


revenue.”


Source: United States of America vs. Lason Executives


SEC Settles Financial Fraud Charges Against Former 


Officers of Lason, Inc.


“The Commission’s complaint alleged that during 1998 and 


1999, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to 


overstate Lason’s earnings in order to meet or exceed Wall 


Street expectations. The scheme culminated in the third 


quarter of 1999, when Lason’s earnings were overstated by 


approximately 65%.”


“The defendants profited from the scheme through their 


salaries as well as bonuses, stock options and executive 


loans that were affected by Lason’s artificially inflated stock 


price.”

Marc Scherr Undisclosed Business 
Interest Tied To ULTI

ULTI promotes as a partner on its website Sterling Talent Solutions. Marc Scherr is named as a “Portfolio Director” at Calera 


Capital. A press release in June 2015 details the sale of Calera’s majority interest to Goldman Sachs / CDPQ. Our record search of

Unusual Property Transaction With ULTI’s 
Outgoing Chief Technology Officer


Adam Rogers, the current CTO and son-in-law of CEO Scherr was appointed to 


his position on Feb 6, 2007 according to ULTI’s 10K. He assumed the CTO 


position at age 32, making him the youngest executive on the team. He was 


preceded by Roy Gerber who was the CTO from 2001 – 2007 according to 


ULTI’s 10K. Property records suggest that Rogers and wife sold property to 


Gerber and his wife shortly after Gerber left his CTO position. The optics of 


this transaction appear suspicious

Who Is Frank Satalino?


Frank Satalino is listed as a director / officer on numerous state and international filings made by ULTI (ex: FL, MS, MA and 


Singapore) although he has never been mentioned in any SEC filings by the Company. He joined ULTI from KPMG where he was 


a partner. KPMG is ULTI’s auditor. We estimate, he joined ULTI around 2011 and has held the title of VP of Taxation.

Potential Conflicts Faced By ULTI’s 
General Counsel, Robert Manne


Robert Manne is ULTI’s SVP and General Counsel 


according to his biography. Yet, he still maintains the 


title “Of Counsel” at Becker & Poliakoff, which is 


ULTI’s first customer and where the CEO says the 


company was started in a cubicle in 1990. ULTI still 


steers business to the law firm as evidenced through 


its role as Escrow Agent according to a recent 


contract. If Mr. Manne is personally benefiting from 


this arrangement, it should be disclosed. Mr. Manne 


maintains a few outside business interests as 


evidenced by various entities registered to his name, 


although it is not possible to know how they may/may 


not conflict with this duties to ULTI.

Potential Conflicts of Vivian Maza

SV World LLC = Scott + Vivian?


Source: Florida Corporate Registry


Public records in Florida indicate a close, if not outright familial, relationship between CEO Scherr and Vivian Maza. Below we find 


evidence that Scherr and Maza have a joint tenants with rights of survivorship at a common address in Weston. This means if one 


party dies, the ownership will pass to the survivor. Vivan just became a notary and is signing family documents. 


Furthermore, an entity named SV World LLC was formed in 2010 at Ultimate’s HQ address for “ANY AND ALL LAWFUL 


BUSINESS” with both Vivian and Scott listed as entity managers through 2014. The entity was dissolved recently.


ULTI needs to provide more disclosure to investors about the nature of the relationship between these two executives and what


transactions were conducted at SV World LLC.

ULTI claims its auditor is “independent” – but in reality numerous members of its finance, accounting, and tax team 


all worked for its auditor (boxes outlined in red). In general, we are concerned that many members of ULTI’s 


finance, tax, and accounting team have been in place for many years. In a recent interview, the CFO even 


highlighted that he’s had the same controller for 20yrs and a VP of Finance for 17 years (1). Employee job rotation 


has been cited as an effective tool for prevention and mitigation of potential problems.

If ULTI Is So Profitable, Why Do Analysts’ 
Value it On Revenues?


Deutsche Bank – November 2, 2016


Goldman Sachs – November 2, 2016


RBC – November 2, 2016 Piper Jaffray - November 2, 2016


B. Riley – Initiation March 13, 2014


JP  Morgan – December 2, 2014


Spruce Point believes it’s a major red flag that most analysts continue to value ULTI mostly on revenues, and won’t 


base price targets on EBITDA or EPS. Do the analysts also have doubts about the reliability of its financial statements?
68


Bull vs. Bear Case


What The ULTI Analyst Bulls Say Spruce Point’s View


RBC 7/7/16: “The competitive environment appears to be stable, and 
the company is executing its sales, hiring, market segmentation and 
PEPM expansion plans”


Piper J 10/7/16: “We believe in head-to-head sales WDAY 
frequently touts its mobile functionality by demonstrating slick 
demos on tables and phones. At the moment, ULTI does not offer a 
mobile application but its offering are built with responsive design 
meaning they’re fully functional on mobile web browsers”


Raising price target on disappointing margins makes plenty of 
sense! Analysts must believe ULTI can drive more sales and 
earnings by sacrificing margin. Although, most of the margin 
disappointment came from acquiring Kanjoya which, in our 
opinion, is a convenient excuse. What’s most disturbing is that 
analysts’ believe ULTI should trade at a premium to peers. 
Hopefully, they will reconsider this view after a review our report


Maybe more competitive channel checks should be done: PEPM 
expansion is low quality given newly disclosed reseller 
arrangements and bolt-on acquisition of revenue-less Kanjoya


DB 11/2/16: “Management guiding to lower operating margins for 
next yr is a deviation from recent trends and may disappoint 
investors. We nudge up estimates and raise our PT from $240 to 
$245 on consistent execution in a market that is increasingly more 
demanding of companies to deliver top/bottom line performance. 
Our $245 PT is based on CY 18 EV/S of 6.2x, a premium to peers due 
to a superior combination of growth and profitability


JPM Initiation 12/2/14 “Ultimate stands out as one of few 
SaaS companies growing above 20% with a double-digit 
operating margin, and demonstrated impressive business 
model resilience during the last U.S. recessions”


Maybe the margins should be critically analyzed: Adjusting 
for aggressive R&D and sales commission capitalization, and 
stock comp expense the margins are approximately 5%


B. Riley Initiation 3/13/14 “Also,  we  note  that  ULTI  capitalizes  its  
R&D  costs,  which  artificially lowers its current costs. We also 
expect  the  increasing  scale  of  the  business  to offset much of 
these deferred costs when they start to amortize starting in 2016”


Here we are and it’s almost 2017 and still no amortization! In 
fact, ULTI is stretching out its amortization period to 
unreasonable and unjustified periods


RBC Initiation 9/15/14 “The higher recurring revenue per average 
employee is a key metric because we believe it demonstrates that  
the company is having success in achieving better rates of attach of 
additional edge products to customers”


Warning: This metric is now declining…. 


The world is increasingly going mobile. The fact that ULTI 
doesn’t have a mobile app could place it at a competitive 
disadvantage

ULTI’s Irrational Valuation Premium


ULTI trades at an irrational price on Street estimates, and when adjusting its figures for its aggressive accounting, we 


find the valuation to be even more stratospheric. Most analysts gear their valuations to revenues and ULTI has 


amongst the highest valuation to revenues.

Vendors should provide a minimum of three (3) relevant, verifiable references and their contact information 
(name, company, job title, phone number, e-mail address).  Vendors should also include a list of their 
government clients in Oregon, if applicable. References must be familiar with the experience similar to the 
requests that Proposer would be providing as services to EWEB.  References should be for projects

original estimated budget and schedule, or needed to be revised. Briefly explain the reason for any revisions.

Rev. 4-3-14 


 8.2.7 Pricing Proposals   (50 Points Possible) 
 Provide detailed pricing by module.  Pricing should include the following components: 


 Recurring costs (annual costs for a five year period) 
 Non-recurring costs 


o One-time costs 
o Implementation costs 
o Training costs 
o Total not-to-exceed dollar amount for all anticipated expenses (travel, per-diem, etc.) to be 


reimbursed by EWEB during the term of the Contract. 
 


Total points for cost will be determined according to the following formula: 
 
A = Total Possible points = 50 
L = Lowest cost proposed 
X = Cost being scored 
B = Awarded Score 
 
Formula:  "L" divided by "X" times "A" = "B" 
 
Example: If A = 50 Points, L = $50,000; X = $75,000; then: $50,000 / $75,000 x 50 = 33.50 points 
 


OPTIONAL – INTERVIEW / PRESENTATION PHASE 
 
8.3 STEP TWO – INTERVIEWS / PRESENTATIONS 


The outcome of the written proposal evaluations may result in placement on an interview/presentation list.   
Should EWEB elect to hold interviews/presentations, the total points possible for the interview/presentation 
will be indicated in the Interview/Presentation Invite letter. 


 
EWEB may invite up to the three (3) highest-ranked firms (or at a natural break in scoring) to interview/present.  
The Firm’s Key Persons as identified by EWEB shall be prepared to attend the interview/presentation after 
notification by EWEB, and shall be prepared to answer questions as provided with the Interview/Presentation 
Invite letter. 
 


Should EWEB determine to hold interviews/presentations, all proposers will be notified in writing of their 
standing.  Proposers not included in the Competitive Range will be eliminated from further consideration.

9.   EVALUATION PROCESS & CONTRACTOR SELECTION 
 


The Total Number of Points Possible for Written Proposals is 250. 
 
9.1 Review and Acknowledgment of Defective Proposals 


Due to limited resources, EWEB generally will not completely review or analyze proposals that on their 
faces fail to comply with the minimum mandatory requirements of the solicitation documents nor will EWEB 
generally investigate the references or qualifications of such proposals. Therefore, EWEB will not 
acknowledge whether or not an unsuccessful proposal was complete, responsive, responsible, sufficient, or 
lawful in any respect. This is a public solicitation, the processes and procedures which are established and 
required by Oregon law and EWEB adopted rules. Proposers are advised to strictly follow the process, 
procedures, and requirements as set forth in the RFP documents and not anticipate or rely on any 
opportunity to negotiate, beyond such limitations that are identified herein. 


 
9.2 Right of Rejection 


Proposers must comply with all of the terms of the RFP, EWEB Rules, and all applicable local, state, and 
federal laws, administrative rules, and regulations. The Purchasing Analyst may reject any proposal that 
does not comply with all of the material and substantial terms, conditions, and performance requirements of 
the RFP. 
 
Proposers may not make stipulations or restrict the rights of EWEB. If a Proposer does so, the Purchasing 
Analyst may determine the proposal to be a non-responsive counter-offer and the proposal may be 
rejected. 
 
Minor informalities that: 
 do not affect responsiveness,  
 are merely a matter of form or format,  
 do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other offers, 
 do not change the meaning or scope of the RFQ/RFP,  
 are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature, 
 do not reflect a material change in the work, or,  
 do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or provision,  


 
may be waived by the Purchasing Analyst. 
 
EWEB reserves the right to refrain from making an award if it determines that to be in its best interest. 
 
A proposal from a debarred or suspended Proposer shall be rejected. 


 
9.3 References 


EWEB reserves the right to investigate any and all references and the past performance information provided 
in the proposal with respect to Respondent's successful performance of similar projects, compliance with 
specifications and contractual obligations, completion or delivery of a project on schedule, and lawful payment 
of employees and workers. 
 
EWEB reserves the right to check any and all sources for information and to include sources other than the 
references provided in the Proposer's proposal.  EWEB may consider information available from any such 
source including government bodies and regulatory authorities in evaluating respondents. 


 
9.4 Responsibility 


EWEB reserves the right to investigate and evaluate, at any time prior to award and execution of the Contract, 
the apparent successful Proposer’s responsibility for performing the Contract, as defined in Rule 3-0500.  
Submission of a signed proposal shall constitute approval for EWEB to obtain any information EWEB deems 
necessary to conduct the evaluation.  EWEB reserves the right to request additional information or 
documentation from the successful Proposer prior to award of a contract.  Such information   may include, 
but is not limited to, current and recent balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, or a 


RFP #047-2015 22 of 36 Integrated SaaS HCMS Solution
Rev. 4-3-14 


performance bond from an acceptable surety.  Failure to provide this information will result in the rescission 
of EWEB's Intent to Award. 
 
EWEB may postpone the award of the Contract after announcement of the apparent successful Proposer in 
order to complete its investigation and evaluation.  Failure of the apparent successful Proposer to 
demonstrate responsibility shall render the Proposer non-responsible and shall constitute grounds for 
rejection of the proposal. 


 
9.5 Clarification of Response 


EWEB reserves the right to request clarification of any item in any proposal, or to request additional 
information necessary to properly evaluate a particular proposal.  All requests for clarification and responses 
shall be in writing.  
 
During the evaluation of Proposals, Proposers must respond to any request for clarification from the 
Evaluation Committee within 24 hours of request (Monday through Friday).  Inability of the Evaluation 
Committee to reach a Proposer for clarification and/or failure of a Proposer to respond within the time stated 
may result in rejection of that Proposer’s Proposal. 


 
9.6 Evaluation Process   


Pursuant to Rule 3-0230(14)(d), EWEB may employ methods of contractor selection that include without 
limitation: 
 
(A) An award or awards based solely on the ranking of proposals; 
(B) Discussions leading to best and final offers, in which EWEB may not disclose private discussions 


leading to best and final offers; 
(C) Discussions leading to best and final offers, in which EWEB may not disclose information derived 


from proposals submitted by competing proposers; 
(D) Serial negotiations, beginning with the highest ranked proposer; 
(E) Multiple-tiered competition designed to identify, at each level, a class of proposers that fall within a 


competitive range or to otherwise eliminate from consideration a class of lower ranked proposers; 
(G) A multi-step request for proposals that require additional information designated in Rule 3-0232; or 
(H) Any combination of methods described in this Section. 
 
9.6.1 Step 1 - Written Proposal Evaluation 


Written Proposals will be evaluated and scoring assigned based on Proposers qualifications and 
experience, the completeness of the proposer’s response, and the degree to which that response 
satisfies EWEB’s requirements as set forth in Section 8. 


 
If EWEB determines there to be a “Competitive Range”, EWEB may elect to conduct interviews and/or 
presentations to assist EWEB in determining the most advantageous proposal.  Proposers identified 
to be in the Competitive Range will be notified by EWEB, followed by written instructions for the 
Interview and/or presentation.  There will be no protest allowed for Proposer's not included in the 
Competitive Range. 
 


9.6.2 Step 2 - Interviews / Presentations (if held) 
The outcome of the written proposal evaluations may result in placement on an interview/presentation 
list.   Should EWEB elect to hold interviews/presentations, the total points possible for the 
interview/presentation will be indicated in the Interview/Presentation Invite letter. 


 
EWEB may invite up to the three (3) highest-ranked firms (or at a natural break in scoring) to 
interview/present.  The Firm’s Key Persons as identified by EWEB shall be prepared to attend the 
interview/presentation after notification by EWEB, and shall be prepared to answer questions as 
provided with the Interview/Presentation Invite letter. 


 
 Should EWEB determine to hold interviews/presentations, all proposers will be notified in writing of 


their standing.  Proposers not included in the Competitive Range will be eliminated from further 
consideration. 





RFP #047-2015 23 of 36 Integrated SaaS HCMS Solution
Rev. 4-3-14 


9.7 Contractor Selection 
If a contract is awarded, EWEB shall award the contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal EWEB 
determines in writing to be the most advantageous to EWEB based on: 
 
a) The evaluation process and evaluation factors described in this request for proposal; 
b) Any applicable preferences allowed by EWEB Rules, Division 2; and when applicable, 
c) The outcome of any negotiations authorized by this request for proposal 
 
9.7.1 The firm with the highest total score as a result of written proposal scoring and 


interview/presentation scoring (if held) shall be considered the highest ranked Proposer. 
 
9.8 Notice of Intent to Award 


After the completion of the evaluation and ranking, the Purchasing Analyst will issue a written Notice of Intent 
to Award and send copies to all Proposers. The notice will set out the names of all Proposers and identify the 
Contractor selected for award.  


 
9.9 Contract Negotiation 


EWEB will begin negotiating a Contract with the highest ranked Proposer as defined in Section 7.7.  EWEB 
shall direct negotiations toward obtaining written agreement on: 


a)   The statement of work; 
b) The contract price as it is affected by negotiating the statement of work; and. 
c) Any other terms and conditions reasonable related to those expressly authorized for negotiation in the 


Request for Proposal, Sections 1.3 and 1.4. 
 


At any time during discussions or negotiations EWEB may terminate discussions or negotiations with the 
highest-ranked proposer if it reasonably believes that: 


a) The proposer is not discussing or negotiating in good faith; or 
b)  Further discussions or negotiations with the proposer will not result in the parties agreeing to the terms 


and conditions of a final contract in a timely manner. 
 


If EWEB terminates negotiations, EWEB may then commence negotiations with the next highest scoring 
proposer, and continue the process until EWEB has determined to award the contract to the proposer with 
whom it is currently discussing or negotiating. 


 
9.10 Protests and Judicial Review of competitive Bidding and Proposals 


Pursuant to Rule 3-0740, a bidder or proposer may protest the award of a public contract or a notice of intent 
to award a public contract, whichever occurs first, if the bidder or proposer is adversely affected because the 
bidder or proposer would be eligible to be awarded the public contract in the event that the protest were 
successful; and the reason for the protest is that all higher ranked proposals are nonresponsive; EWEB has 
failed to conduct the evaluation of proposals in accordance with the criteria or processes described in the 
solicitation materials; EWEB has abused its discretion in rejecting the protestor's bid or proposal as 
nonresponsive; or EWEB's evaluation of proposals or EWEB's subsequent determination of award is 
otherwise in violation of EWEB Rules. 
 
Eligible proposers protesting award shall follow the procedures described herein.  Protests that do not follow 
these procedures will not be considered.  This protest procedure constitutes the sole administrative remedy 
available to proposers. 
 
a) Protests must be received within seven (7) days after issuance of the notice of intent to award the 


Contract.  EWEB will not consider late protests. 
 
b)   All protests must be in writing, signed by the protesting party or an authorized Agent and submitted to 


the EWEB Purchasing Analyst listed on page 1. The protest must state all facts and arguments on 
which the protesting party is basing the protest.  


 
c)   Only protests stipulating an issue of fact concerning a matter of bias, discrimination or conflict of 


interest, non-compliance with procedures described in the procurement documents, or EWEB policy 
shall be considered.  Protests based on procedural matters will not be considered. 





RFP #047-2015 24 of 36 Integrated SaaS HCMS Solution
Rev. 4-3-14 


d)   EWEB’s Purchasing Manager will review the protest and will fax and mail the protesting party a written 
response within three (3) business days of receipt of the written protest to the fax number and address 
provided in the bid or proposal.  Any written response may be comprised of a determination of the 
protest, a notice to the protesting party of the need for additional time in which to evaluate the matter, 
or other notice to the protesting party. 


 
e)   If the Purchasing Manager’s determination (response) is adverse to the protester, any further appeal 


of the Purchasing Manager’s determination by the party must be submitted in writing to EWEB’s 
General Manager within three (3) business days of issuance of the Purchasing Manager’s 
determination (response). 


 
f)   EWEB’s General Manager will review any appeal of the Purchasing Manager’s determination and shall 


fax and mail, in accordance with the fax number and address provided in the bid, the protesting party 
a written response within three (3) business days of receipt of written appeal. 


 
g)   If the determination of the General Manager is adverse to the protesting party’s interest, the protesting 


party may only appeal to EWEB’s Board of Commissioners by filing a written notice of appeal to the 
Board with the General Manager within two (2) business days of issuance of the General Manager’s 
written determination. 


 
h) The Contract Review Board, in considering the protest, shall review the documentation presented to 


the Purchasing Manager and the General Manager on or before the next regularly scheduled Board 
Meeting, but in no event shall they be required to review in less than ten (10) business days, and 
thereafter, base their decision on such material.  The Board review will be limited to the evaluation of 
compliance with EWEB’s policies and procedures, requirements of the RFP or ITB and the equal and 
fair application of EWEB’s contracting rules.  The contract Review Board's determination shall be 
EWEB's final decision. 


 
An adversely affected or aggrieved bidder must exhaust all avenues of administrative review procedures and 
relief before seeking judicial review of EWEB's Contractor selection or Contract Award decision.
