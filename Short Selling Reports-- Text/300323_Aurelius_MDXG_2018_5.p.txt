Dear Mr. Aguilar,


We are writing you to express our belief that the ongoing fraud at
MiMedx must be stopped immediately and our opinion that you are
uniquely positioned to do so.  You have an important opportunity to
use your position as a MiMedx Director to protect your legacy and
reputation.


We have great respect for your tenure at the Securities & Exchange
Commission and efforts to protect investors and punish
corporations for �nancial fraud. We especially admire your prior
advocacy for the SEC’s whistleblower program and agree with your
speech titled, “Incentivizing Whistleblowers to Bring Fraud to Light”. 
Speci�cally:


This is precisely why we �nd it so perplexing to observe you standing
seemingly idle while MiMedx has deployed a nearly unprecedented
campaign of whistleblower retaliation. Dozens of former employees


Too often, we see frauds revealed only after the money
is gone and investors are tragically harmed. In an
attempt to systematically combat this, Congress
mandated that the SEC promulgate rules so that
whistleblowers would serve as an early warning system
to detect fraud. Today, we are putting rules into place to
achieve that goal.

have emerged as whistleblowers to document the pervasive and
multi-faceted fraud that is occurring at the company. But instead of
being protected, many of these individuals report being terminated
or harassed soon after discovering and reporting instances of fraud
through internal MiMedx channels.  The company has created a
culture of fear by seeking to �nancially destroy whistleblowers who
have spoken publicly by burying them in the costs of litigation and
then trying to force them to recant their testimony.  Whistleblowers
not currently in litigation with the company have faced intimidation
tactics that have left some of these individuals even fearing for their
life.


MiMedx has �led frivolous lawsuits against short sellers (including
ourselves) and a news organization, the Capitol Forum, for
expressing opinions and publicizing facts that contradict
management’s narrative.  The company has attempted to discredit
journalists from Business Insider, The Wall Street Journal, and
Bloomberg who have either questioned the company’s business
practices or, most recently, reported the existence of two separate
Department of Justice investigations into MiMedx.  Paid MiMedx
stock promoters assail and threaten critics in online forums while
Mr. Petit appears to have used his political in�uence to catalyze a
warrantless visit by FBI agents to the home of a short seller with
instructions to “stop tweeting about Mr. Petit”.


Mr. Petit is using your name and reputation as a currency to
legitimize his activities. For example, Petit has repeatedly declared
that “we’ve got a former SEC commissioner on our board” to support
his claim that there is “no malfeasance” at MiMedx.  When asked by
an investor why you joined the MiMedx board despite having no
healthcare background, Mr. Petit said “use a little business sense”.
We therefore believe that Petit’s representations about you have
enticed investors who would otherwise be concerned about the
outcome of the SEC’s investigation of MiMedx.


This is particularly problematic because Mr. Petit has repeatedly
made false statements to investors. Throughout last year, Mr. Petit
pointed to his exoneration by the Audit Committee’s previous
investigation which he claimed was conducted by “independent
outside counsel”.  But we later learned that this investigation was
7/10/2019 An Open Letter To MiMedx Director Luis Aguilar - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-director-luis-aguilar/ 4/5


actually completed by Troutman Sanders, MiMedx’s own securities
counsel who also has lengthy ties to Mr. Petit’s previous companies.
 Mr. Petit also falsely represented that Ernst & Young had endorsed
the company’s accounting practices, with MiMedx declaring that “our
big four auditors are with us!” in response to allegations of
accounting impropriety and Mr. Petit even claiming that the
company’s quarterly �nancials are audited (they are obviously not).
How can the MiMedx board ful�ll its �duciary obligations while
letting so many clear falsehoods linger in the marketplace?


Although the company recently delayed the �ling of its �nancials and
announced that the Audit Committee will now be conducting a
second “do over” investigation, this is insu�cient. Mr. Petit’s
fraternity little brother, J. Terry Dewberry, remains the Chairman of
the Audit Committee.  Mr. Dewberry has been “very close” with Petit
for decades and even assisted in the creation and award of a bronze
bust of Mr. Petit. The two other members of the audit committee
also appear to have personal ties to Mr. Petit that make us
concerned about their independence.  Since these individuals
already completed one �awed investigation, how can investors
possibly trust that the deck is not stacked once again?  For the
investigation to have integrity, it must be led by individuals with no
prior ties to Petit and his previous companies. We �nd it particularly
troubling that despite your signi�cant quali�cations, you are not a
member of the MiMedx audit committee and therefore likely not
even substantially involved in this investigation.


The present moment represents a critical opportunity for you to
extend your legacy of protecting investors and whistleblowers to the
private sector.  In a 2014 speech on Corporate governance, you
stated that:


Accountability means that actions have consequences. 
When corporate governance embodies the principle of
accountability…most importantly, [shareholders] know
that misconduct will not be tolerated.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-director-luis-aguilar/ 5/5


We possess evidence of accounting fraud, Medicare fraud, tissue
tagging irregularities, anti-kickback violations, undisclosed related
party transactions, and the systematic intimidation and harassment
of whistleblowers.  We are willing to present this evidence directly
to you in detail because we suspect that Mr. Petit may have
concealed material facts from you and other Board Members.


Each day that Mr. Petit remains in control of MiMedx, the damages
to investors, taxpayers, whistleblowers, and the capital markets
grows. We implore you to use your position at MiMedx to end this
fraud immediately or, at absolute minimum, stop Mr. Petit from using
your hard-earned name and reputation as a currency to legitimize his
activities and intimidate whistleblowers.


 


Sincerely and Respectfully,


 


Aurelius Value
