Veeva Systems: 'In The Land Of The Blind, The One-Eyed Man Is King'

Well, the optimists in us had hoped that putting our research out there was enough to get
the underwriters to rectify their mistakes, but it appears we are at that stage in the cycle
where such a strategy simply doesn't work. Instead of revisiting their clearly sloppy
initiation reports which contained materially misleading facts/analysis that we identified as
well as highly exaggerated and unwarranted claims about the life sciences CRM market,
the "Veeva Six", as we will refer to them from now and on, have chosen to ignore their
professional responsibility with the hope that this will all simply go unnoticed. To be frank
we kind of figured this is the way they would go with this. In fact, we were elated to see the
Deutsche Bank and Canaccord's analysts issue notes raising their price targets on Friday
morning. This phenomena is called 'backfire', and has been studied extensively by
behavioral psychologists. The basic premise is that when confronted with facts that prove
them wrong, opinionated individuals react very differently from the uninformed. Basically,
instead of changing their minds and acknowledging the correct facts, they entrench
themselves even deeper into their existing view. This type of behavior makes it a lot easier
for us to show that these analysts are about as conflicted as it gets.


We would like to remind the sell-side and everybody else that while a certain degree of
this behavior is accepted as 'industry practice' there are still federal securities laws and
FINRA rules at play here. The fact that it has been 10 years since the regulators made a
serious example out of anyone doesn't mean these regulations no longer exist. These
regulations require that published research reports, amongst other things, have a
reasonable basis, present a fair picture of the investment risks and benefits, and not make
exaggerated or unwarranted claims. There are principles of fair dealing and good faith at
play here that are supposed to protect investors from baseless, unreasonable, unverified,
misleading and factually inaccurate statements in published reports on listed securities.


Investment banks are no strangers to these policies as they all have guidelines in place
that are based on these regulations. This is an example from a top firm's research
guidelines:

Investment Research Analysts ("Analysts") are required to observe high standards
of integrity and ethical behaviour. All investment research reports ("research
reports") must be based on strict standards of truthfulness and fair dealing, and must
be presented in a manner such that they are fair, clear and not misleading. Analysts
are required to ensure that they have a reasonable basis for their analysis and
recommendations. X has policies giving guidance to Analysts regarding the proper
presentation of facts and opinions in research reports, for example regarding
verification of facts and the avoidance of superlative, flamboyant, emotional, libelous
or promissory statements. X operates procedures to ensure the independence of
expression of views by Analysts and to prevent improper influence on Analysts'
professional judgment.


Now, with that in mind, we call your attention to the Canaccord Genuity analyst covering
Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV). This analyst was very loud on Friday which really
surprised us considering how many things in his initiation report were confirmed as flat out
wrong after the conference call. His CRM TAM analysis assumed a 'base CRM' average
revenue of $2,220 a seat. On the call, Veeva confirmed that they are 1/3 penetrated into
the rep market, and that the vast majority of those reps have Irep. Thus CLM is, as we
accurately described it, more of a 'base' selection versus an 'add-on'. This means anyone
doing the math here for ASPs should be getting a CRM+CLM avg annual revenue per
seat in the $1,100-$1,125 range. If CRM+CLM for 1/3 the seats on the planet is half your
number for CRM alone, you should not be commenting at all let alone raising your price
target by $2. Seriously, how hard is it to simply pipe down and 'revise' your analysis based
on more complete disclosures. This is just arrogance and the antithesis of all things
'research', and because of that we will now share with you precisely how this analyst's
'analysis' was described by three independent life sciences CRM experts we shared it with
during our thorough review of the space. "Utterly baseless, and without merit." -
Industry Analyst; "Nonsense!" -LS CRM Exec; "You sure he's talking about CRM,
because it's impossible for anyone covering LS CRM to make such a statement."-
Top 50 Pharma CTO.


As you can see, it shouldn't take FINRA or the SEC too much time to figure out this
analyst is publishing research for which he has absolutely no reasonable basis.


And it doesn't stop there...

"Value- focused investors can huff and puff that this stock is "too expensive," but the
fact is that software stocks almost always go up as long as they hit or beat
estimates, and we believe that is very likely for Veeva for the next several quarters
and, frankly, years. We're buyers of VEEV today."


Canaccord Analyst, Dec 6, 2013 quote picked up extensively by wires.


This is maybe one of the most ignorant and utterly irresponsible statements we have ever
come across in a sell-side research report. First, there are NO 'value-focused' investors in
this stock. Second, it's comical for this analyst to comment on Veeva beating estimates
because his Q3 estimate was for 1% sequential revenue growth. To put that in
perspective, Veeva averaged 15% q/q revenue growth over the past four quarters. His
model had their growth rate collapsing 95% in their first quarter as a public company. If
that was what he believed would happen, one wonders how he had a buy rating on the
name before this huge 'surprise' quarter. If a company that grew 100%+ in 2012 and is
trading as the most expensive SaaS stock by far on a price/sales basis is forecasted to
grow 1% in your model, then there is something very wrong with your model. If there is
something very wrong with your model, then beating your estimates is irrelevant to any
investor with a functioning brain. Most skilled investors are familiar with the art of low-

balling an 'estimate', but that is not what is going on here. This is what we call flat out
trying to manipulate investor perception of a stock. If a 'research analyst' knowingly
publishes an estimate that is highly inconsistent with his recommendation/analysis of a
stock simply to guarantee that the company will beat this estimate, and then comes out
the next day and says stocks that beat estimates 'almost always go up'; he is nothing
more than a manipulator and promoter in our book. Five of the "Veeva Six" modeled 0-1%
growth with the one outlier coming in at a whopping 3%. If these estimates were
independent and based on historically driven quantitative factors, statistically they would
all be major outliers. If there were qualitative factors involved here, then the stock would
have been rated and modeled very differently. This is business as usual for an IPO, but in
this case it is so egregious because of Veeva's growth trap nature that you can't help but
call them out on it. You also have to love the 'almost always go up' and 'next several
quarters and frankly years' comments here. Talk about superlatives in a 'research' report.
(Btw- anyone who followed this recommendation is down at least 10% already) Makes
one wonder how long before Charles Schwab breaks out the "put some lipstick on this
pig" commercial they ran in 2002 to take a swipe a Merrill Lynch and Henry Blodget.


Then you have the DB analyst, whose assumptions we clearly showed to be based on
factually inaccurate data. This analyst is still reiterating his less than 10% CRM dollar
value penetration despite the fact that this has been proven 100% wrong. He even upped
his target by a dollar after Veeva 'beat' his 0% sequential growth estimate.


The other underwriters showed a greater degree of restraint, but that is not exactly saying
much.


The bottom line here is these analysts picked the worst stock and sector to play make
believe with. The facts are out there. They are clear, accessible, repeatedly verifiable, and
undeniably refute what these analysts have been publishing.


As for our notes from the conference call, we will say one interesting thing that jumped out
at us was the fact that Veeva management went on the record putting the global rep count
at 450k. We point this out because our research indicated the count is roughly 400k, and
because this number was in fact what Veeva disclosed to one of their own underwriters'
research analysts.


"We note there are currently approximately 80,000 US-based pharmaceutical sales
representatives, and approximately 400,000 global reps, according to company
estimates" - Stifel Veeva Initiation Report, Nov 11, pg 3.

Thus, we find it highly dubious that Veeva's own internal global rep count estimates (which
btw we can show you precisely from where they sourced this 400k global/80k US data
from) changed over the past three weeks. This may explain why they went to great
lengths to qualify this statement on the call by saying, "There are about 450,000
pharmaceutical sales reps, animal health sales reps and consumer health sales reps."
This is what you call CYA, while also helping your underwriters out after they all royally
screwed up by using a 450k count to TAM your CRM market, despite you having directly
provided them internal estimates that are 10% lower. We'd also point out that this number
combined with their stated 1/3 penetration disclosure doesn't comport with our ASPs for
CRM+Irep. We have Veeva at around 133k live CRM users at the end of Q3, which
checks out against our $1,100-$1,125 annual ASP per seat data. If you get closer to a
150k (1/3 of 450k) rep count number, the ASPs start coming in a lot lower than our
research indicated Veeva is generating. Basically, increasing the global seat number by as
much as possible makes the base CRM ASP assumption blunder embedded in all the
underwriters models a tiny bit (and we are talking microscopic here) less embarrassing. At
the end of the day, Veeva's management throws their underwriters a bone, and in return
they end up looking less credible. Smart trade! Though you'd like to think that before
disclosing the global rep count at 450k on their first conference call management would at
least check and make sure that one of their underwriters hadn't published research stating
they actually sized the market at 400k. Oops!


Anyway, it seems everyone involved in this IPO simply thinks the investment community is
made up of a bunch of buffoons, and to be frank we are in no rush to dispel that notion.


Disclosure: I am short VEEV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I'm short some of this since your original article, which was a terrific dissection of why among all the egregiously
overpriced SAAS stocks out there, this one is selling into the most limited market and thus doesn't have a sustainable
"story" to go with the "stock"... Thanks for the idea.

Suhail Capital, why are you only concentrated in VEEV? Hope there is nothing personal in all your articles. You wrote
4/4 and all of them directed to VEEV. I think you don't see the whole picture here. Veeva's cofounder saw it and went
after it. Veeva partnership with salesforce.com is a big PLUS that safeguards the investment. Veeva VAULT will be a
great success beyond CRM. VEEV is a great investment.


10 Dec 2013, 04:28 PM


musicmaker
Though I had been short VEEV, after seeing Nacho's comment I will be covering and getting massively long.
Up until this point, I hadn't seen the whole picture and was unaware that the co-founder of Veeva went after it
or that VEEV is a great investment. Hopefully no one else sees Nacho's comment it is likely to move the stock
significantly given these phenomenal insights.


Nacho - find an index fund and stick with it. Who's afraid of 138?


10 Dec 2013, 06:14 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Nacho - The partnership with salesforce is good but it is also a limit for the business. Your referring to VAULT
is not clear and should be completed and supported. I don't see how VEEV can expand the business beyond
the reps sales field. In the CC the management spoke about products for doctors and organizations, but it
was very vague.


11 Dec 2013, 03:18 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes, enlighten us on the whole picture because we really are not familiar with this name or space.
Tell us more about this safeguarding of the investment by salesforce as this seems very interesting. And also about
Vault. Who are their competitors in that space? Have any been acquired recently? Where should we start our
research? We will try to write an article about Apple next week, and maybe Coca Cola the week after. We've dug up
some real interesting stuff on these names that we don't think anyone in the markets is factoring in.

In the investment, I trust data than anything else. VEEV will have $246.8m rev. in next 4 Q compared to $187.136m
and earning will be $0.23 vs. -$0.05. That is an about 40% increase in rev. VEEV is growing in a unique market. I
know you are trying to publish a long article to have the short parade but I don't buy it. Time will tell.

companies for $50ml...2.5x 2012 rev. This company does 10x veev vault revenue. If you trust the data our
thesis is a no brainer. Your mistake is u think there is an organic growth story here when crm was more of a
trade on siebel life sciences. The ipo was them closing out the trade. If you want organic cloud ls growth go
buy medidata. Half the ev of veev and 60% more sub revenue, and actually in a segment where growth could
continue steadily for quite some time. Versus the boom/bust element that will be veeva's crm growth rate
curve because of the characteristics of that market.

whole picture. It may help in a short strategy, but I'm talking long here. Let's talk in a year or two.

The market does not follow the data and cash flow analysis. The instinct is how trader interpret them in different ways
and move the market in the short run. Today the forced short covering was brought into play the first hour of the
session, although it faded along with the market. It was a first try in the bull / bear fight over VEEV with a mini bullish
pattern registered. In this fight, prudent traders will not let emotion make their decisions. All material facts, biased or
not, will be less relevant compared to how market participants act upon related information based on their convictions.

had positions in Ulti, Csod, Now, and Netsuite at one time or another though wouldn't be long any of them
right now. Ulti we think is a short here. But again with veev out there we view messing with the rest from a
short perspective as a waste of time. Relatively speaking they are all good long hedges against it.

Suhail,  
thanks for your input. I agree that WDAY is a fast moving bullet train that can continue to do a beat-and-raise
and expand their TAM. Until the momentum slows down the stock may not take a hit. Concur looks like a solid
player with long history. Demandware looks interesting but I haven't assessed their earnings power to be
comfortable with the valuation.


NOW has been expensive all along. I guess you saw something in it that gave you comfort in going long.

I have read online and in WSJ that cloud is growing rapidly. Not factored into your analysis. Think about it

Also, there are BIG risks to being short. Since VEEV shares are down it is likely that someone like Icahn will
buy a big stake. Ican actually just raised some money a couple days ago. Probably buying some VEEV.


11 Dec 2013, 06:44 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
The statement that cloud is growing is a little bit generic. VEEV business is focused on a little niche of the
cloud and totally dependent on CRM platform. You should explain how the business could grow outside the
sales reps area.

PChan444, I am interested in hearing your thesis on why someone like Icahn will buy a stake? The stock is
ridiculously expensive and an activist investor cannot add any value here. Typically someone like Icahn goes
into situations where stock is trading below intrinsic valuation. They push stock higher by enforcing corporate
governance, buybacks, or changing management.


Your comments about "read online and in WSJ that cloud is growing rapidly" do not make any argument to
buy Veev. If this is your investing style then good luck with your picks.


12 Dec 2013, 07:22 PM

Icahn like big growth like Neflix. Could be said that VEEV is the Netflix of CRM for medical companies. Easy
money for big player like him. I suggest you do your homework - this is right up Carl's alley.
