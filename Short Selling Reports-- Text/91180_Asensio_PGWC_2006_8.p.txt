PGWC: MetricStream Does


Not Address PGWC’s


Compliance Woes


On August 3, 2006 Pegasus Wireless Corporation (NASDAQ:


PGWC, $5.76) announced that the “Company has embarked


on an initiative for sustainable compliance with the


Sarbanes-Oxley Act and ISO Quality Standards using


MetricStream.”


How MetricStream Software’s (“MetricStream”) program


applications would address PGWC’s major compliance issues


remains a mystery. MetricStream provides a checklist of


requirements, it’s the companies that decide how they want


to behave.


The implementation of MetricStream at PGWC will not erase


outlandish compliance irregularities such as PGWC’s ties to


an indicted Taiwanese National who stands accused of


embezzling in excess of $525 million, or the background of


PGWC’s Chief Financial O�cer who himself lost his Certi�ed


Public Accountant license in North Carolina.


You can also probably count on the fact that since the


software is being designed by management, including the


aforementioned CFO, and Mr. Knabb, then the software also


probably won’t be able to address irregularities such PGWC’s


cancellation of 19,506,000 shares in a series of transactions,
