Navigating The Labyrinth That Is Herbalife

Shortzilla has spent months of painstaking research in examining the various facets of the
multi-level marketing firm Herbalife. Herbalife has come under fire from several short-
sellers in the past. The argument is typically always the same; Herbalife has little to no
actual retail sales and is therefore operating as a Pyramid Scheme.


David Einhorn's inquiries into the actual percentages of retail sales (those outside of the
distributor network) on the May 2012 earnings Q&A ignited renewed fears surrounding the
legitimacy of Herbalife's operations.


The following three discussion points offer a glimpse into the labyrinth of Herbalife. The
full report, which covers several other additional topics is available at our website.


Part One: Herbalife is operating in violation of a 1986 California Court Order


Herbalife has been omitting and misstating information to the public since it listed its
securities on the NYSE in 2004


The Ground Rules: The rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), including but not limited to Rule 10b(5), apply to all publicly listed
companies, including Herbalife. (See a more thorough explanation here.


Shortzilla will give you the facts, then you can decide if this information had been known to
you; would you have included it in your decisions in connection with trading in Herbalife
securities.


Is Herbalife operating its enterprise in violation of a court order?


A court order which specifically provided the conditions under which Herbalife's Marketing
Plan will be in compliance with the state of California's endless Chain Scheme Code.


The following statement is included in Herbalife's prospectus in connection with its NYSE
IPO in 2004, and in each Annual report thereafter.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1077301-navigating-the-labyrinth-that-is-herbalife 2/15


All of our officers and directors are subject to a permanent injunction issued in
October 1986...instituted by the California Attorney General...We consented to the
entry of this injunction...The injunction... required us to implement some
documentation systems with respect to payments to our distributors.... (Emphasis
Added) Page 22, 10K 2011.


TS: Herbalife has admitted in regulatory filings, in litigation and on its 1Q 2012 conference
call that it does not have any system whatsoever that does, or has the capability to, track
retail sales.


What are the details of the 'documentation systems' imposed by the court; and why did
Herbalife omit these details from all regulatory filings? The Final Judgment and Permanent
Injunction mandated that Herbalife must set up a system to:


"verify or document that any and all participants who receive commissions...and/or
advancement from defendants in defendants marketing program, after entry of this
judgment, are based on retail sales".


Question: Would Herbalife conceal the very existence of the permanent injunction from a
court?


Answer: Yes they would and they did.


On June 1, 2009 there was a hearing in connection with [then] active litigation involving
Herbalife; wherein Herbalife's attorney admitted:


"And, yes, we don't keep track of retail sales".


Consequently, it was imperative that both the existence and details of the permanent
injunction be withheld from the court.


At the beginning of the hearing, the court informed the parties that:


"First of all, subject to the Court's ruling on the endless chain scheme, and that's
really what I want to hear most about today because, in my view, in this case that's --
that is the elephant in the room"


and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1077301-navigating-the-labyrinth-that-is-herbalife 3/15


"All of the other issues depending on how it's resolved is whether or not Herbalife's
business model is lawful under the California endless chain legislation".


In response to the Court's statements above, Herbalife's attorney stated:


...the company has been here for close to 30 years. It's been overseen by the...State
of California...and it has not yet, other than in California in 1980 or '81, I believe it
was, has it been looked at as a pyramid scheme. (Emphasis added)


The Court:


...you have indicated that Herbalife has been in business for 30 years without being
found to be an endless chain.


Part Two: Belgium Court's Pyramid Scheme Ruling


The Belgium pyramid scheme case had been ongoing for several years. The findings of
the court that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme was a significant blow to
Herbalife; because, among other things, its MLM Marketing Plan is the same throughout
the word, with the exception of China.


In December 2011 a Belgium Court ruled that Herbalife has established a pyramid
scheme; the court ordered cessation of Herbalife pyramid scheme; and the court ordered
that Herbalife would pay a fine of 5,000 Euro for each breach that is established from two
months after the date of this ruling".


Herbalife engaged in a concerted effort to conceal the Belgium court findings from the
public.


The court's ruling that Herbalife is operating an illegal pyramid scheme is a material event.
However, instead of issuing a 8K (which is mandatory for a material event) Herbalife
issued a press release. The press release is dated December 16, 2011 and omits the
material fact that the court found that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme.


We tried to find references to the Belgium case in Herbalife's Q's and 10K's. This task was
difficult because Herbalife omitted any mention of, or even reference to, this case from the
appropriate sections of these filings; which is "Item 3. Legal Proceedings". We finally
found disclosure of the case in its 10 Q's and the 10K 2011. In both cases, the disclosure
was slipped into the description of Herbalife's Network Marketing Program under risk
factors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1077301-navigating-the-labyrinth-that-is-herbalife 4/15


The following are few interesting excerpts from the Belgium Court's Order.


The Court: Herbalife argues...products are sold by the methods of direct sales
whereby they are sold to the end consumer by independent
entrepreneurs...Sometimes the distributors are 'consumers', yes even 'members',
other times the distributors are 'retailers'. The fact that the distributors are no
consumers is shown from 'The Distributorship Agreement' of Herbalife.


The Court: Contrary to what Herbalife is arguing, this case does not show that the
distributors are selling to the end consumers.


The Court: Payments at Herbalife are calculated on purchases, whether these are
by sponsored distributors or end-consumers does not make any difference to
Herbalife. Moreover, Herbalife cannot even answer the question by the court as to
how many of its products are eventually sold to an end-consumer.


Part Three: Packaging & Handling Fees Inflating Bottom Line


According to the above snapshot taken from Herbalife's Investor Relations page, Herbalife
generated net sales of $3.5 billion in 2011. This number includes shipping & handling
charges and sales generated from literature and promotional tools.


Therefore, in 2011, Herbalife only generated $2.94 Billion revenue from its distributors'
purchases of its products ("product sales").


In 2011 Herbalife generated $509.8 million (over half a billion dollars) in revenue from
Shipping and Handling charges (see above); representing 17.3% of Herbalife's total
product sales. We wondered why revenue from this category was so high?


Here's what we discovered.
5/22/2018 Navigating The Labyrinth That Is Herbalife - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1077301-navigating-the-labyrinth-that-is-herbalife 5/15


Herbalife is charging distributors on average 7% of the total retail sales price of the items
purchased for 'packaging and handling fees'; with shipping charges adding an additional
3-4% (also based on the retail sales price). There are no shipping and handling charges in
China, so if we extracted the $210.8 Million in China Product Sales in 2011, shipping and
handling as percent of product sales is even higher at 18.6%.


Remember that the Retail Sales number doesn't mean anything to Herbalife. If I am a
distributor at a 50% discount and order $100 of product at retail price, I pay Herbalife $50.
Yet, I still am charged a packaging fee and a shipping fee based on that $100 retail price.


We thought that 7% for just packaging and handling fees seemed high, especially when it
never really equates to 7%. Here are the discount groups for Herbalife and what that 7%
number really means:


Distributor Discount Packaging Charge Based on Actual Purchase Price


25% 9.33%


30% 10.00%


35% 10.77%


42% 12.07%


50% 14.00%


We searched Herbalife's marketing materials and found this in one of their guides:


Herbalife is also levying shipping charges based on the "Retail Sales" Price. Please see
below for a list of US Shipping charges for distributors:


So let's get back to my original example. If I order $100 worth of 'Retail Product' and I am
in a 50% discount group, I would pay the following to Herbalife:
5/22/2018 Navigating The Labyrinth That Is Herbalife - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1077301-navigating-the-labyrinth-that-is-herbalife 6/15


Product Sales: $50 
Packaging and Handling Fees (based on $100 Retail Price) = 7%*$100=$7 
Shipping Fees (FedEx Ground Delivery): $6 
Total Packaging, Handling and Shipping Fees: $13 
Total Amount Sent to Herbalife = $63


In the above example, my packaging, handling and shipping fees equate to 21% of my
entire order.


I thought it would be interesting to see what happened to Herbalife's bottom line if we
stripped out charges for handling and literature/promotional sales.


I started with Total Product Sales of $2.94 Billion (Note this is the amount paid by
distributors to Herbalife for Products). I subtracted Literature and Promotional Revenues
for reasons that will be explained in the second in our series of reports on Herbalife, which
will be published in January.


I also subtracted my estimate of $362.8 Million for packaging and handling charges. (this
had to be estimated, since this number is never revealed by Herbalife in SEC filings).


I adjusted Cost of Sales, using the same percent of product sales (16.8%) as reported by
Herbalife in 2011. They do note in the 10-K that shipping and handling costs are included
in Cost of Sales.


Taxes are adjusted utilizing the same tax rate as reported of 26.3%


Based on my findings, Herbalife overstated EPS by nearly 66% in 2011. My normalized
figure for Earnings Per Share is $1.34, as compared to the $3.89 reported by HLF.
Utilizing the current trailing P/E ratio of 12x 2011 Earnings, we arrive at a value per share
for Herbalife of $15.84.


Note that these normalized numbers still could be adjusted even lower.


We include 147 Million in Revenue for Herbalife, which still equates to 5.3% of Total
Product Sales in 2011. If we normalize shipping charges to 3% of total product sales, EPS
drops to $1.03, with a value of HLF at $12.15.


In Summary, Shortzilla believes that Herbalife is utilizing 7% packaging fees, inflated
shipping charges, and the questionable recognition of Literature and Promotional material
in order to help compensate its distributors.

I'm not sure I understand exactly what your point is about the shipping and handling charges. First, does it really
matter what label you place on those charges? The fact of the matter is that they charge those amounts and collect
that money and with things set up the way they are they are growing sales. If instead they simply increased the price
of the product by a similar amount and charged nothing for shipping and handling would that make you feel better -
even if the total charged was the same? Second, to assume that there should be zero for shipping and handling and
arriving at some kind of contrived adjusted EPS is just as silly as saying that they are overcharging. The important
thing is the total amount that they are being paid. I am sure the buyers of their product are aware that they are being
charged for shipping and handling. It's not a secret.

Author’s reply »  There are packaging and handling charges and then there are shipping charges. Both are
levied on retail sales figures. Why?


A distributor pays 7% to Herbalife for the company to package its goods. But the 7% is extremely misleading.
No one buys at retail. As pointed out, Herbalife is essentially charging up to 14% (based on the actual

purchase price) for Herbalife to box up the goods. Does this seem fair to you?


You seem to be missing the point that that 7% (based on retail) is just for 'packaging and handling'. There is a
completely separate shipping charge - which is also based on the retail price.


All that we are trying to point out is that the packaging, shipping and handling revenues for Herbalife seem to
be extremely high.


Ackman had a slide in his presentation yesterday, which compared Herbalife's shipping and handling
revenues in comparison to Avon. I suggest you go take a look.

that was exactly my point too. seeking alpha is still reviewing my comment to post. I m glad they let you

We are not disputing that the % of S&H might be high for HLF than Avon or inudstry norm for that matter.
What we would like point out is that it is simply a configuration of pricing, the ending price (including S&H) is
what has been acceptable to distributors and consumers for generations. Ask your self this question... have
you ever buy anything online? if so, do you just look at principal price or price +S&H? I know 99% of the
people look at the combined price ... and that combined price has been accepted for a long time, or else HLF
would have gone BK long time ago.


21 Dec 2012, 12:35 PM


Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
S&H is almost always free online with Amazon because most people get super saver shipping. Why doesn't
HLF just be honest, and charge whatever price its products should be priced, and charge S&H what S&H
should be? High S&H prices by itself isn't a huge issue, but it's just one shady piece of HLF's overall scheme.

Ackman's slides 300-306 suggest S&H is "too low." You are suggesting it's "too high." Ackman seems
confused that HLF passes on the cost of shipping & handling to its distributors, & ultimately the final
customer. 
In any case, why are you "adjusting" HLF's EPS? This S&H revenue is money that customers/distributors
have paid & the company has collected. It is based on Retail price because retail price best reflects the unit
volume of product shipped. The actual cost to distributor is irrelevant. 
eg. when you go to send a book at the post office or FedEx, they don't care if your book is worth $10 or $100,
only it's weight & size.


23 Dec 2012, 08:48 AM


jwuslc
The author's maths is laughable. The S&H and prmotional material charges are just how HLF prices its products.
They can also choose to go higher on core price ad lower the S&H charges. The end result is the same ... and that
ending price has been accepted by its buyers for 30 years. so what is the ground for adjusting its revenue and EPS
again? LOL

Assuming that the shorts are right and that HLF is found to be an ILLEGAL pyramid scheme by the FTC.


What would be the consequence?


Assume 2013 net sales from North America to be zero, forecasting a net sales for 2013 @ 3.3Billion, that would still
make HLF an attractive buy at this price. Their cashflow generation ability is not disputed, only their MLM model.


Yes, it may be a pyramid scheme, but in many developing country (including here in Malaysia) HLF is a growing
business with actual following of end user at their growing "nutrition club"..


http://bit.ly/VfOQ43


I am no expert on pyramid scheme, but just pointing out that even if the shorts are right, the company is certainly not
worth nothing like Ackman is hoping.


21 Dec 2012, 11:14 AM


Intangible Valuation, Contributor
Technically speaking, if it is illegal it will be shutdown -- and therefore it would be worth nothing, just like
Ackman is hoping. Money would then also stop flowing up the pyramid... bond holders might be able to get
some of their money back but shareholders would probably be stuck with a loss (there is $500 million in debt
at 9/30/2012 and tangible book is $0).

You are correct about tangible book being at $0.


But, If it turns out to be illegal, why can't they just change its business model in USA so it's sold directly to
end-user via retailers (same way it does currently in China)? And they'd still be able to keep their MLM model
in all other countries.


Granted that might lower revenues coming from USA, but HLF operates in 80+ countries and just because Bill
Ackman thinks HLF is an "illegal pyramid scheme" doesn't mean it will cease to operate in all of the 80
countries!


21 Dec 2012, 04:11 PM

% Retail price is the fairest way to charge for shipping & handling, since it reflects the volume of product shipped. 
If S&H was based on distributor's actual cost, after discount, the distributor with 50% discount will receive more
product per $100 of S&H compared to a distributor with 25% discount, even though it costs the company more labor,
etc to ship the higher volume purchase.

Mr A said that it hlf is worth zero. I've never thought much of him, especially with the jcp incident. So what if its illegal.
Its not a all or none deal. Like the previous poster mentioned, hlf is quite diversified with many growing markets.
Furthermore, do you actually think theyll go bankrupt? More likely, IF it ever goes to litigation, it will be a drawn out
process and in the worst case scenario, result in slight modification in business model in ONE region.


As for hlf being worth.zero, what is Mr A thinking. If Hlf retained all its earnings and does not pay a dividend nor buys
back its shares, i estimate it would have 5 BILLION dollars in cash in about 7 to 8 years. At that point, if hlf shuts
down its business, it would be worth 5 billion dollars. What doez the market think hlf is worth right now?...about 3
billion. Thats 50 dollars a share in cash.


I were in management's shoes right now, i would stay very very quiet and not do anything and pray for the price to
drop to very low levels and quietly start buyngshares. Doing this will transfer shares from weak hands to very strong
hands. If the price gets really low, then i would even consider buying back all the shares and go private again to avoid
all this nonsense.

Yes, it will be shutdown.


But would the FTC shut HLF's oversea operation? Arguably, they don't have the jurisdiction to "protect" consumer in
countries like Ghana.. In past enforcement proceeding, their action is restricted to action that will harm domestic
consumer.


Even in the Belgium's pyramid case judgment, the court's jurisdiction is limited to Belgium only..

Jesse Sobelson, CFA, Contributor
I'm inclined to believe you're right, and it's a shame if Ackman is correct. Since they are based in the Cayman
Islands the whole company can't be shut down, just the American operations - like in Belgium. This will allow
the people who operate this company to continue to basically steal from other countries. Then again major
wealth areas like Europe will most likely follow suit. Japan has already experienced the 'pop and drop' that is
Herbalife, and China is experiencing it now

Eye-opening report, Shortzilla. S&H fees are another one of the many ways HLF tricks its customers, oops I mean
distributors.


One thing I'd adjust in your valuation is you probably have to decrease SG&A if you're going to take out the packaging
revenues, because the packaging revenues pays for part of SG&A, correct?


21 Dec 2012, 12:29 PM

So what S&H fees are high. 
It seems the short thesis on HLF can be summarized like: "I don''t understand how it works, therefore it must be a
pyramid scheme."

While this article is weak (and I'm in the process of creating a more descriptive one - and sorry Shortzilla!) I

This article is useless. Ackman is manipulating the shares of HLF based half truths and goofy math. The courts and
governments are aiding his arguments. The only question and real question that should be ask is the customers
happy with the products and are there repeat sales. Is the growth real? Ackman and Shorters have left this
information out of their analysis. I am waiting for bottom and purchasing just as Ackman is doing at some price? he
will reverse the short and purchase the stock.

How are they bad people? This is Ackman's 2nd short position ever. He's giving away his profits to charity
and shared this idea, like many others at a charitable conference. The work that goes into this is
extraordinary. Do you think Ackman is manipulating the stock of JCP or GGP? As for profiting at someone
else’s expense - sometimes it someone else’s stupidity. (Not calling you stupid or anyone else, just a phrase.)
Additionally, Ackman did a wonderful job saving the equity for GGP shareholders. No position in HLF. Chanos
shorted Enron, was he bad for being short and right?

I watched Ackman's presentation.


All the slides are basically saying:


"look how unbelievably high the products are price..."


"look how unbelievably high the S&H is, compared to actual product price..."


"look how little they actually spent in R&D, compared to their claims of extensive R&D..."

"look how much they gave their noble laureate researcher, compared to UCLA..."


"look how much the distributor pays, compared to the price of its products on eBay..."


All true, but how does that make it an illegal pyramid scheme? And seriously? 300+ slides to explain why its a
pyramid scheme?


Any why does HLF have to go to $0 even if it can't run with its current business model in USA? There are over 80
other countries where it is doing just fine.


Here's the thing: Most illegal MLMs have products that are built on recruiting and the products themselves are crap.
HLF on the other hand does have an active customer base that likes its products and consumes its products.


What HLF is actually worth is debatable, but I really don't think it's worth $0.

HLF was LBO'd in 2002 by Whitney and Golden Gate Capital. Then brought public via an IPO in 2004. Then in 2007
Whitney V L.P made a bid for HLF at $38/sh. HLF declined the offer because it was too low. So, here was sit with HLF
the cheapest it has ever been in history at <6x EPS, <4x EBITDA, a 4.5% dividend yield, a 15%+ free cash flow yield
and virtually no net debt. Wake up everyone - LBO #2 here we come..

Ackman seems to bring a deeply moral perspective to investing.

Shortzilla-


did you do the analysis on herbalife's packaging margins because it's such a HUUUUUUUGE number of the
company's profit? The math just doesn't lie here this is insane


*edit* this is based on extra analysis not cited in this article

Author’s reply »  No, i didn't, because i couldn't find the costs in any of the filings. But after reading Ackman's
stuff, i can see they revealed in the SEC responses. Just add it to the list. There is no possible way they can
dig out of this mess.

I like the products, have had good results (sports and health) and been a happy customer/distributor since 1995.
Ackman's analysis is done on the full retail price but any long term consumer can get the products at a minimum 25%
discount or bulk buy for 40%. Isn't that what the supermarkets offer too? It's presently a shame for stockholders that
Ackman's bringing more publicity to Herbalife. However, long-term, I hope the debate brings more real truths out. Of
course there are limited winners - in athletics, in college exams, in business, in Herbalife, in life. Get real. What bigger
pyramid organisation is there than the US Army?

Exactly. You could say Pershing Square is a pyramid scheme because Ackman recruits new MBAs who slave
at his company, while he makes the bulk of the profits, and very few of the new recruits will advance to the top
of his company.

Well HLF is bouncing back. I suppose good stocks can survive 
attacks by short selling sharks. But look how many people were 
damaged as they panicked out of their HLF positions. What monsters 
Ackman and Einhorn are. They are vampires who feast on the blood of people who actually work for a living

why should you let HACKman influence you?

They are vampires who feast on the capital of people who have either not enough skill or not done enough
research to have sufficient conviction in what they buy.


Truth be told, even without short sellers and stock manipulators, these people will still likely lose as a result of
panicking out of other market gyrations.


I say this as someone who has spent many years as this class of investor and even though I now know better,
research better and buy with more conviction, I am still influenced by the changes in my brokerage statement
and from time to time still end up having to put a maiden in the volcano.
