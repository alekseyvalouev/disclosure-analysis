try to sell its shares for $5.16 at a public auction (total

5/23/2018 Fuwei Films (FFHL) "Auction Games" Reveal Red Flags, Buyers Beware | GeoInvesting

“These shares are currently held indirectly
through an intermediate holding company, Apex
Glory Holdings Limited (“Apex Glory”), all of
whose shares are the subject of the public
auction, and the indicative target price for the
first auction is RMB218,746,600 (approximately
US$35.7 million) or approximately US$5.16 per
ordinary share of Fuwei Films held by Apex Glory.
The auction regarding Apex Glory is to be held on
August 27, 2013 and will be run by Shandong
Jialian Auction Co., Ltd. and Shandong
Outstanding Auction Co., Ltd.”


Interestingly enough, as disclosed by FFHL this morning,
this auction was a failure. We confirmed that there were no
bids for FFHL’s shares on August 27, 2013, even with a
lower price than the indicated target price.  Furthermore,
no other date has been set to carry out another auction..
We believe that additional facets of the story also
reduce the chance that possible future auctions will
be successful.


As we will discuss, the auction notice press release in China
indicates that the “court” (Jinan City Intermediate People’s
Court) , not the Weifang State-owned Assets Operation
Administration Company , assigned auction companies to
sell 52.9% of FFHL’s shares (or “The Shares”) at the
auction.  Investors need to be aware that FFHL has been
accused of not being fully honest with investors in the past
regarding disclosure in its IPO prospectus in 2006.  This
eventually led to a class action litigation which was settled
for $2.15 million.


“The suit charged that company officials had provided false
and misleading information relating to the company’s IPO.”


There was also a lawsuit in China:

https://geoinvesting.com/fuwei-films-auction-games-reveal-red-flags-should-send-shares-back-to-usd-1-or-lower/ 3/12


“In 2009, the company disclosed that three
executives had been convicted in China on
charges that they had illegally taken control of
the business there. Shareholders alleged in a
lawsuit that Chinese authorities were
investigating the hijacking of the company while
stock promoters in the U.S. hyped the new issue.
The suit charged that company officials had
provided false and misleading information
relating to the company’s IPO. One of the
executives arrested in China has been sentenced
to death there, and the two others to life
imprisonment, the company has said.”


The court system’s involvement in the auction of The
Shares forces us to ask several questions:


Does the Weifang State-owned Assets Operation
Administration Company really currently own shares
of FFHL?
If the Weifang State-owned Assets Operation
Administration Company really owns FFHL shares, why
was the court involved in the proposed auction and
why did it assign auction companies to conduct the
auction?
Why did FFHL management not disclose that the court
would be involved in the auction and only tell U.S.
investors that the Weifang State-owned Assets
Operation Administration Company was to sell the
shares?
Did FFHL for some reason intentionally fail to disclose
the court’s involvement in the auction?


The Pump Should Dump


Before this news, FFHL’s shares were trading only around
$1.00.  Following the news of the auction, FFHL’s stock
price quadrupled, spiking from around $1.00 to reach a

high of $4.00 during the August 14, 2013 trading session.
Since then shares have fallen and currently trade around
$2.00 per share.  There seemed to be an initial belief by
many investors that the auction news implied that FFHL
was worth $5.16.  But really, this number only means
something if entities place bids.


However, we confirmed that no one placed any bids for
FFHL’s shares as it relates to the auction at the desired
$5.16 indicative target price. Worse yet, no lower bids
were placed for the shares. Thus, we believe that FFHL
should minimally trade at the price it was trading at on the
day before the auction announcement (around $1.00).


Furthermore, we think the stock could trade lower than
$1.00 as investors who have yet to digest the facts of this
story may rush to sell their shares with a float of only 4.5
million shares and little institutional support.


To cap it all off, the company reported dismal second
quarter 2013 financial results on August, 22, 2013, making
it the seventh consecutive quarterly loss the company has
experienced. This is particularly concerning since FFHL
subsidiaries were purchased during foreclosure/bankruptcy
proceedings in 2003 and 2004.


“On September 24, 2004, the People’s Court of
Weifang declared Shandong Neo-Luck bankrupt
due to its financial difficulties. We acquired the
Brückner production line in 2003 as a result of a
foreclosure proceeding enforcing an effective
court judgment and the DMT production in 2004
as a result of a commercial auction from a
consigner who obtained such assets through a
bankruptcy proceeding.”

Thus, for the time being we are disregarding the RMB
218,746,600 ($5.16 per share) auction target price as the
true value of FFHL. Please read on for more details on this
developing story.


FFHL management Conceals Important Facts


Different press releases in China and United States cast a
cloud of doubt on the ownership of The Shares that FFHL
claims is owned by the Weifang State-owned Assets
Operation Administration Company.


In China, the FFHL auction news was actually published in
the Securities Times on August 8, 2013, around one week
ahead of the press release issued by FFHL in United Sates.
 Following this news in China and before FFHL’s press
release, FFHL’s stock price barely moved.


The press release in China regarding the auction reads as
follows:


“…


Shandong Jialian Auction Co., Ltd. &
Shandong Outstanding Auction Co., Ltd.


Auction Announcement


Assigned by Jinan City Intermediate
People’s Court, on 10 am, August 27, 2013,
there will be an auction in Auction Hall, 6 Floor of
Jinan City Intermediate People’s Court (Jing’er
Road, Jinan City, entrance is on East Gate):


Subject of Auction:  52.9% FFHL shares;

Note: This company is a NASDAQ listed company
with its registered address Gorge Town, Cayman
Island and with business address Weifang City
Shandong;


Indicative target price: RMB 218,746,600


Subject Exhibit Period: From the date of this
press release to Aug. 26, 2013.


Auction Registration Process: intentional bidder
shall deposit RMB 40 million to court bank
account (Jinan City Intermediate People’s Court,
Bank Account: Shiqiao Branch, Qilu Bank,
000000028004100000378)


…”


Apparently, based on the Chinese press release, this
auction was assigned by the Jinan City Intermediate
People’s Court in its court house, which is different from
the press release made by FFHL, which claimed that:


“Administration Company has determined to
place control over 6,912,503 (or 52.9%) of its
outstanding ordinary shares up for sale at a
public auction to be held in The People’s Republic
of China (“PRC”).”


Most importantly, it appears that FFHL intentionally omitted
the court’s involvement in this auction.


A little background information is relevant to fully
understand the FFHL story.  In 2003 to 2004, state-owned
assets (Brückner and DMT) were purchased by FFHL during
foreclosure/ bankruptcy proceedings.  In 2009, the former

controlling shareholders of FFHL involved in the purchase
of Brückner and DMT were convicted of fraud.  All of the
personal property of these controlling shareholders,
including 52.9% FFHL’s shares were ordered to be
confiscated by the Jinan City Intermediate People’s
Court.  FFHL claims that the shares of the former
controlling shareholders were transferred to Weifang State-
owned Assets Operation Administration Company, which is
why we are perplexed that the court assigned the auction
in its court house.  The following disclosures in FFHL’s most
recent 20F discuss some of these details and references
the 52.9% of ordinary shares to have been auctioned is
summarized below:


“The March 2009 initial verdict sentenced Mr. Yin
to death, with a stay of execution for two years,
and the other two defendants, Mr. Zhou and Mr.
Wang, each received life imprisonment. All of the
personal property of the three individuals will be
confiscated.”


“On May 9, 2011, the Company received a
notification from the Weifang State-owned Assets
Operation Administration Company, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Weifang State-owned Asset
Management and Supervision Committee (the
“Administration Company”) regarding the
transfer of the ownership of controlling
shareholders.”


“According to the notification, the former
controlling shareholders of the Company, Messrs.
Jun Yin, Duo Wang and Tong Ju Zhou, had
transferred their entire ownership in several
intermediate holding companies to the
Administration Company, Ms. Qing Liu and Mr.
Zhixin Han. As a result of the transfers, and

Court needs to continuously be involved with and even
assign the auction company to administer the auction.  We
also do not know why FFHL has failed to disclose the
court’s involvement. As The Shares were assigned to the
auction by Jinan City Intermediate People’s Court, we
believe that either the Administration Company never
owned theses shares free and clear or that there is another
undisclosed legal proceeding in Jinan City Intermediate
People’s Court concerning The Shares.  However, FFHL
never disclosed either possible situation.  This lack of
transparency may keep potentials entities away from
bidding in future possible auctions, if there is one.


FFHL Business is Faltering


FFHL’s poor business performance is likely another
reason why investors are not bidding for FFHL
shares.


On August 23, 2013, two business days before the
scheduled auction in the PRC, FFHL released its financials
as of June 30, 2013.  Revenue decreased from RMB 92.4
million to RMB 77.4 million and the net loss increased from
RMB 11.9 million to RMB 18.19 million.


The trend of consistent losses has been recurrent for
several quarters after a brief period of profitability in 2010

and 2011.


FFHL did not provide revenue and/or net income guidance
for its business.   However, FFHL’s main source of revenue,
the BOPET film business, has been very sluggish in China
over the past two and half years.


BOPET Price Trend Chart, August 2011 To June 2013


As of July and August 2013, BOPET prices were still very
low and are predicted to remain at depressed levels.

https://geoinvesting.com/fuwei-films-auction-games-reveal-red-flags-should-send-shares-back-to-usd-1-or-lower/ 11/12


Therefore, without an improvement in the prospects for the
BOPET market, we believe that FFHL will continue to
experience big losses.  Considering these trends, when
combined with everything else we have discussed, it is
hard to believe that investors/entities will seriously bid for
52.9% of FFHL shares, especially at a price anywhere close
to $5.16 per share.


Conclusion


It appears that FFHL’s management team successfully
pumped its stock price from $1.00 to $4.00 per share for a
brief moment, fueled by the August 14, 2013 auction
disclosure press release in the U.S, even though the
auction announcement was made around one week prior to
this date in China.


Furthermore, the facts have led us to conclude that FFHL
intentionally concealed the court’s involvement in the
auction.  Because of this possibly  masked information, we
believe there is an under-handed reason why management
took this course of non-disclosure, and  investors will see
that too much risk is involved in bidding for or holding onto
FFHL’s shares, especially given the company’s past legal
problems in China and the U.S.


Additionally, FFHL’s business is in the red and may continue
to lose money going forward.  This adds to our belief that
no entities will have an interest to bid on The Shares.
