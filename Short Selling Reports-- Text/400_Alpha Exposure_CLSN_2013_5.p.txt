Celsion Misleading Investors ... Again
Sep. 9, 2013 10:23 AM ET54 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


We have previously criticized Celsion (NASDAQ:CLSN) for attempting to mislead
investors by highlighting subgroups and trumpeting subgroup analysis that fails to reach
statistical significance. Unfortunately, the Company still hasn't gotten straight with its
investors, as evidenced by this morning's press release, which appears to have at least
two potential problems with the data that is presented.


1. Celsion Reports Data from Only 47% of Enrolled Patients


Celsion would like investors to believe that Thermodox is a promising treatment for
recurrent breast cancer at the chest wall and the Company highlights that "Clinically
meaningful responses were reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients." While this may
seem like an impressive 61% response rate, the truth is that the 23 evaluable patients are
a minority subset of the 49 patients that were enrolled between the two trials. As can be
seen here, the trial at Duke enrolled 29 patients and as can be seen here, the DIGNITY
trial enrolled 20 patients. Between the two trials, 49 patients were enrolled. This is the
intent to treat population and is almost always the population across which clinical results
are measured. Celsion, however, decided to narrow the population to only 23 patients
(47% of the intent to treat population) and to evaluate this subset. This type of data mining
tends to produce positively skewed results and cannot be seen as meaningful.


2. Celsion Makes Up a New Metric


As a second point, we would note that Celsion is pointing investors to "clinically
meaningful responses," without defining for people what this means. Many outcomes in
cancer trials, such as Objective Response Rate, Overall Survival, and Progression Free
Survival have well defined meanings such that further explanation to investors is
unnecessary. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the term "clinically meaningful
responses," and we are left to wonder what exactly this means. In most Phase I trials that
report on an outcome rather than simply on safety and dosing, Objective Response Rate
is measured, because this can be observed more quickly than either Overall Survival or
Progression Free Survival. Objective Response Rate measures the percent of patients
who experience either a partial response or complete response to treatment. As
previously mentioned, this is best measured over the entire trial population (the intent to

treat population). By providing investors with an alternative and undefined endpoint
(clinically meaningful responses) over a subset of the trial population, Celsion simply
leaves people guessing regarding the actual benefits seen in the trial, if any.


Conclusion


While we see a number of issues with Celsion's press release this morning, it would be
too harsh to call this a failure. Instead, we simply see this as incomplete and largely
irrelevant information - results measured against an undefined endpoint in a modified
intent to treat population. In our opinion, there's nothing exciting here. We look forward to
seeing the full trial data so that we can evaluate it at that time. We remain short Celsion's
stock and our price target remains $0.68 per share.

since we are splitting hairs...your second link you provided states "estimated" enrollment 20, yet never states how
many actually enrolled.


The Duke study link you provide (first link) states ... 
"Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ (with or without standard-dose granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor [G-CSF] support) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD without G-CSF
support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD. If the only DLT is neutropenia in > 1 of 6 patients treated at any dose level,
then additional cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ with G-CSF support (standard-dose
G-CSF or standard-dose pegfilgrastim) until the MTD is determined. The MTD with G-CSF support is defined as the
dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT after the addition of G-CSF support."... 
Seems to me that lays out a case for fuzzy math...as Celsion stated 14 out of 23 "EVALUABLE"...evidently others
didn't meet the criteria which is clearly stated in the links you provided

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The point is that in a well run trial, the entire population (i.e. the intent to treat population) is
the group against which efficacy is measured. CLSN chose to narrow this population by more than 50% to get
a subgroup in which it then measures a new made-up outcome "clinically relevant outcome" - I think this is
just made up stats on their part

Will you openly admit to your readership that you have used the wrong word ("efficacy") in the context of your
response above?


Failure to do so indicates that either you don't know how Phase I trials are conducted or that you are
deliberately attempting to deceive your readership.


Silence is acceptance of the above.

efficacy despite the data

This is not an article, is a very confused point of view of a biased person holding a short position.


The company has reported no data, the PR is an announcement that there will be a presentation of combined data
from two Phase I studies next December. You won't see the actual data until then.


Also, it is likely that the sentence "Clinically meaningful responses were reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients."
has been stripped from the abstract of the presentation, i.e. it has been written by the authors of the data which will
soon be presented. Meanwhile the company mentions that these Phase I studies are not designed to assess efficacy.


As we know, ALL phase I trials are designed to assess tolerability and not efficacy. This author is playing with words

Phase I studies are dosing and feasibility, they help to gauge where to go in Phase II... That they have
already had 2 complete responses in Phase I in this end of the road treatment shows great promise. These
women have already run through the gamut of treatments, including mastectomy.

Risk/Reward of a short at this price makes no sense even if they do a reverse split. I'm not a fan of reverse
splits, but the stock has been basing for quite sometime and it's not like they have a ton of shares outstanding

Author’s reply »  Again - this is anecdotal and tells us close to nothing - do you think the company would
highlight the patients who die? This reminds me of the flap over Ron Reyn and his apparent cure by ONTY
and its Stimuvax drug - see the blog here http://bit.ly/185nxG5 - just because someone sees their disease get
better while they are on a treatment does not mean that the treatment caused the effect and does not mean
that the treatment has a statistically significant effect on a diseased population. This is just anecdotal
evidence and of minimal value IMO.

Inciteful
Phase I studies are intended to identify sub cohorts for broader studies in subsequent phases, precisely what this
study accomplished. The results will target later work under a more focused set of appropriateness criteria, something
from which the liver studies would clearly have benefited. This is very encouraging. The above article's criticisms
might be valid when applied to any phase III results but makes absolutely no sense when evaluating an early phase
study.


09 Sep 2013, 12:25 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  What exactly was the sub cohort that was identified here? That wasn't where the company
said they saw efficacy - the company made a broad efficacy claim but restricted the analysis to the 47% of
patients who were "evaluable" - yet we have no idea what made 53% of that patients unable to be evaluated.
This is not an example of finding a sub-group; it's an example of excluding the bad news.

The post is ONLY about the DIGNITY study in Duke University: 
"LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Sept. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Celsion Corporation CLSN -7.35% , a leading
oncology drug development company, today announced the presentation of the combined clinical study results
from"""the Company's Phase I DIGNITY study and the Duke University"""" sponsored Phase I trial of ThermoDox®
plus hyperthermia in Breast Cancer Recurrences at the Chest Wall (BCRCW) at the 2013..."  
In the link provided the number of enrolled patients was 20 as of "Last Update: May 22, 2013" 
pay attention at the status of the study which is open(in contrast with the fist one which is closed) and continue to
enroll patients as of May 22, 2013. 
The number 23 could be, and probably is, the exact updated number of enrolled patients as of Sept 9, 2013. 
"Clinically meaningful responses" is phrase often used in these type of trials not only by CLSN PR but by many others
since the exact evaluation criteria differ and are not simple depending on the case.


I would recommend Alfa Exposure to read the following phrase and to stop pursuing his/their own interest/s.


“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by
dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no
effort without error and shortcoming..."

My guess is that the author went short at under a dollar and is desperately waiting for the stock to get below
the entry level. The author also probably realizes that time is not on the side of the shorts, since short-term
and mid-term chances for positive news outweigh chances of further negative news.

But you don't expose them, most of your articles are full of supposition at best, that support your short
position. In this case, a 68 cent stock that you are short in.


If you really wanted to expose fraud, then you'd do real investigative journalism and not the national enquirer
style of most of the articles I've read of yours.


So I guess I still don't get it.

allegations against HLF. Ackman will never in this lifetime cover his short and neither would AE.


AE, it's time to fold like Ackman did and book your loss. JCP was another huge loss for Ackman and it goes to

How do you feel about the top professionals in the field of Breast Cancer being part of the Phase II trial. The best in
the business. You are lost in space, Celsion continues to attract the best doctors to be part of their vision, which will
become reality very soon. I'm sure you are looking forward to the presentation in San Antonio this December.
Cowardly skate around these facts, tool.


24 Sep 2013, 10:19 PM

I personally agree that the reputation of certain professionals that are associated with a clinical trial is a net positive,
HOWEVER, keep in mind that researchers, no matter what their reputation, are involved in some research that is
successful, and other research that is not successful, it is the very nature of scientific research. Net, professional
associations are not conclusive evidence of success, just favorable evidence.


25 Sep 2013, 12:16 PM


Pete P.
Very good point. Just because the researchers are top in their fields doesn't guarantee that CLSN will be
successful. It is nice to see that top researchers are involved though, as they should help the company move
toward success either short or long term.
