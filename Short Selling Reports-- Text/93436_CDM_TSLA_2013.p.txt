While I have not sifted the world to find this misplaced bet, I have definitely sifted the
U.S. markets thoroughly to find abnormalities. My recent search has come up with Tesla
Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the most overvalued stocks I have seen this year.
The above chart signifies the epitome of a herd like stock, the object of this article is to
find out if it is warranted. So what do you need to have a significantly over priced stock
relative to any reasonable fundamental valuation? You need a great story, in fact this
story is so great it starts out in Hollywood, with the initial production of "Iron Man",
featuring Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark who is portrayed after Elon Musk, CEO
of Tesla Motors. This gets the ball rolling, now add analyst hype, a great car (Model S),
a quadrupling of the stock price, Elon Musk hype via twitter, and now you have a cult
like following. While Tesla Motor may be masquerading as a tech company its true face
is just a car manufacturer no different than General Motors (GM) or Ford (F). In fact they
are so similar that Tesla Motor actually bought a factory off General Motors and Toyota
Motor (TM). While many investors want to value Tesla Motors on bogus long term
assumptions about 2014-15 revenues and profits, I want to value Tesla Motors rightfully
as a car manufacturer.

I highlighted the large divergences from the above data, alarmingly Tesla Motor is
trading at roughly 21 times the industry's price to book, and 54 times the average price
to sales of the industry. All of this while continuing to burn cash at an alarming rate. To
give readers the scope of how big the valuation divergence is, by utilizing the industry
price to sales metric Tesla Motor would be valued at approximately $4.55 per share, &
on an industry book value basis at $1.77. While I understand Tesla Motor is growing
revenues faster than the industry, investors are paying a huge premium for that growth.
With such a large premium currently priced in, even with above normal growth it is
unlikely that Tesla Motor will grow into its enormous multiple.


Elon mentioned that Tesla Motor should be able to achieve margins similar to Porsche
(OTCPK:POAHY), a manufacturer that has been around for over 80 years and produces
annual profits of around $2 billion USD. Elon even mentions directly that profitability is
unlikely in 2014, due to the cap ex needed for the Model X assembly. So while it is nice
to hear the CEO make claims that they can achieve margins similar or better than
Porsche it bears skepticism given that in the last quarter without the one-time loan
benefit they would have only made half a cent of profit. While I think Elon is a great
innovator and a nice person that wants to change the world for the better I think he may
have bitten off more than he can chew with all these grandiose promises.

*All data from Capital IQ


If you look at where the funding is coming from it is mainly from shareholder dilution.
Roughly $754 million has been raised in the last three years (Sale Purchase of Stock)
along with roughly $1 Billion just raised recently which is a combination of convertible
debt and equity, bringing the total capital raised from shareholders to approximately
$1.75 billion. While Tesla Motor may have some cash left over after the government loan
is paid off, it likely will not have enough cash to fund 2014 costs of the Model X
development and the ambitious supercharger network.


While I could repeat all the risks presented in the Barron's article and many other
articles I will just summarize some of the large risk factors I see affecting Tesla Motor .


Tesla Motor niche remains a niche only business and struggles to grow sales past
the five digit threshold.


Musk's highly optimistic views on significantly lower battery costs don't materialize


The nationwide network of superchargers significantly increases cap ex & drains
cash flow


The development of Model X, & costs overruns


Long term issues relating to the 8 year full warranty on the battery, likely will result
in huge long term costs to Tesla Motor


Competition from manufacturers with significantly more scale & experience entering
the EV market more forcefully.


Lower priced competition already from the Volt, Prius, & Leaf dominate the low end
market share, before Tesla Motors lower cost EV even hits the market.


A significant portion of the stocks run was from short sellers covering their wagers
& not from long-term investors

Options & trading activity points to a day trading stock & not a long-term
investment.


If Tesla Motor was valued even remotely close to other car manufacturers it would
result in a substantial decline in price per share.


While all these highlighted topics have already been mentioned in some regard, I think
there is another substantial risk to Tesla Motor that exists with regards to giving away
free power for the life of the vehicle. While on the conference calls no one has really
addressed this long-term issue, I think it gets cumulatively worse over time and could
become enormous given large scale. Think if Tesla Motor gets sales of say one hundred
thousand a year and Tesla Motor has cars on the open road of say half a million in five
years. Assume two full fill-ups per week you get 500K * 2 * $12.98 (using California as
the base rate case) *52 equals costs roughly of $675 Million. Now I know that many of
the stations have solar power panels on the roof, unfortunately the power generated
from those panels only has enough power per day to charge less than a handful of
vehicles fully.


"Nine stations now provide free electricity for Model S owners, and the company has
said it wants 100 along U.S. and Canadian highways by 2015."


Now if you think that was a big cost just consider the fact that Tesla Motor is the only car
manufacturer attempting to build out an exclusive nationwide network. The other
manufacturers don't have to worry about spending more cap ex on a nationwide network
as they are leaving that to local service stations. Given the annual costs (Cap Ex &
Operating costs) associated with developing a nationwide supercharger network you
would have to assume this is a competitive advantage for the incumbent players. Also
another potential issue is even the supercharger network takes roughly 30 minutes for a
half charge, so it is likely that the charging stations would be fully occupied when
someone arrives. Which means that you could be setting aside a full hour of your day
waiting for an open charging station. While this is not likely now, given there are so few
Model S' on the road, it is likely a possibility as volumes increase.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

Elon Musk describes his original purpose for Tesla Motor during his All Things D
interview as an attempt to fill a void for people that love EV's, but that he never assumed
Tesla Motor was a good way to, "get a return on investment". I would think that the
primary motive of the CEO would have been to make a profit for the shareholders,
however, apparently this never crossed Elon's mind. Then he goes on to describe his
company as "quite a high market cap" and then chuckles, as if to imply that the stock is
drastically overvalued. While these may just be subtle clues it seems like the last thing
on his mind is achieving long-term profitability & returning capital to shareholders.
Instead it seems shareholders are funding all the development out of their own pockets,
riding on the aggressive assumptions from management that big profits are on the
horizon.


Overall, I feel that Elon is a great person, who was tremendously successful with his
PayPal startup, and wants to continue to innovate with Tesla Motor & SpaceX. However,
I think there is a line investors must draw in the sand when the promises get out of line
from reality. In my view Tesla Motor is priced for perfection, and even if they are
successful with the Model X, the nationwide supercharger network, and the
development of lower cost batteries, I still think the stock currently has priced in all of
this. While most "investors" view this as a wait and see approach, I feel Tesla Motors
needs perfect execution over the next few years just to keep the stock price where it is
now.
