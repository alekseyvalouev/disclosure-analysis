RDVT


We believe Russell 2000 mistakenly included RDVT in the Russell 2000. Index fund
removal will likely be announced on May 11, which will lead to forced selling.


Business is challenged - RDVT is a spin-off of a cash-burning business.


Questionable management - Michael Brauser, board members, and management
have allegations of civil fraud and SEC subpoenas regarding involvement in other
companies.


Insider enrichment - Brauser and his family members have been paid generous
consulting contracts, company has paid for private planes, $50m in stock grants.


>60% immediate downside. Near-term price target, $2.16. 18-month price target,
$0.00.

We are short, Red Violet (NASDAQ:RDVT), because we believe it is going to drop by
>60% within the next month due to what we think was an incorrect inclusion in the
Russell 2000 index (similar to what happened with LongFin (OTC:LFIN)). Furthermore,
we will detail additional legs to the short thesis where we raise concerns about the long-
term viability of the core Red Violet business and present significant evidence of alleged
fraud and deception at previous companies run by Red Violet's management team and
board members which consist of Michael Brauser and Philip Frost.


Red Violet is a recent spin-off from Cogint (now renamed Fluent (FLNT)). Cogint spun
out a business unit that is in a precarious financial position. It recorded a $21.5 million
net loss in 2017 on only $8 million of revenue. At the current run rate, RDVT will burn
through all the cash on the balance sheet within 15 months, which made us turn our
attention to the management team and their track record of destroying shareholder
value. 22 of the 23 companies we have found Michael Brauser to be involved in (either
at an executive level or as a significant shareholder through his Grander or Marlin
Capital investment vehicles) have resulted in average shareholder impairments of 85%.
In addition to this, there are numerous allegations of questionable conduct, including:


SEC subpoenas and DOJ investigations


California DOJ investigation


Civil lawsuits alleging fraud


Insider enrichment - Brauser and family used RDVT predecessor company COGT
to enrich themselves via consulting agreements for family members, paying for
private planes, issuing >$50 million of free stock.


Paid stock promotions and historically using MissionIR for investor relations


We believe the best-case scenario for this remaining business is a punitive capital raise,
which brings us to the question of the integrity of the management team and their track
record of shareholder wipeouts. We believe their track record makes them undeserving
of additional capital (unless, of course, you are happy for them to spend it on private jet
travel and dubious consulting agreements with family members, which they were fond of
doing at the pre-spin company, Cogint).

Potential Index Mistake - Erroneous inclusion in the Russell 2000


The above are a litany of problems at Red Violet that will doom them in the long term,
but investors should be more interested in why the index fund glitch will likely result in
significant forced selling. We believe index selling will significantly depress RDVT's
share price by >60% in the next month, with the removal announcement coming on May
11th.


We think Russell 2000 made another LongFin-type of mistake by including a company
that does not fit the criteria of the Russell 2000. We have already informed FTSE
Russell (who owns the Russell 2000) of this possible mistake, which will likely result in
exclusion either immediately, as was the case with LFIN, or at the latest will be
announced on May 11th when the Russell Rebalance is announced.


It is our opinion that FTSE Russell Index Funds inadvertently helped pump up RDVT's
valuation by +80% by mistakenly adding them to the Russell 2000. The first 10 days of a
spin-off's regular trading normally involve forced selling as index funds and mutual funds
that received shares in the spin-off dump them in the regular market. It makes common
sense, a Portfolio Manager receives shares in a company he's never heard of, so he
sells them. However, the first 10 days after Red Violet's spin-off, the stock went from $5
share price to $9.77. We think that this happened due to a very simple index fund
mistake. You see Red Violet was just added to the Russell 2000 Index at COGT's
market cap level when they shouldn't have been based on Russell's criteria.


We think FTSE Russell made a simple error. They incorrectly calculated the market cap
of the spinco, Red Violet. According to the FTSE Russell press release, they likely
estimated RDVT's market cap was $413m market cap ($40 per share * 10.33m shares
which was the company's illiquid "when-issued" market cap on negligible volume). The
company's actual market cap was a paltry ~$53m. We believe this mistake led to
Russell declaring that the market cap of the spin-off Red Violet (really $53 million at $5 a
share) was higher than Cogint Inc. (now Fluent, a $200 million company). As a result,
RDVT was accidentally added to the Russell 2000 in COGT's place (link to
announcement). This caused the index funds to start buying aggressively in order to get
to the % of the index that RDVT would make up if it were indeed a ~$400 million
company. Lucky for you, very soon, we think, they will be selling just as aggressively,
which will cause RDVT to go down by >50% on heavy volume in our estimation.

The Imminent Removal:


After the spectacular blowup of LFIN, US investors should be well aware that mistaken
index inclusion (and subsequent deletion) can lead to a significant mispricing and
opportunities followed by forced selling and large shareholder wipeouts. Here is an
article from the Financial Times explaining the LongFin mistake in case you aren't aware
(FT Article). LongFin more than doubled in price from $32 to $71 once it was added to
the Russell 2000 index, only to collapse back to $10 right after the index funds sold all
their shares on March 28th/29th.


To confirm that this occurred, you can check the holdings of some of the Russell 2000
funds. For example - RDVT is currently owned by Guggenheim's Russell 2000 Product
(see pg 50 of Guggenheim Investment Funds Russell 2000 - sort alphabetically).


We have already informed the FTSE Russell of this potential error. We did the same
when they made a mistake earlier this year with LongFin Corp. which collapsed after the
index funds liquidated their position. We think FTSE Russell can choose to remove
RDVT immediately and abruptly (like LFIN), or at the very latest will announce their
removal on May 11th, which is the Russell Rank Day. We believe that the ranking for the
Russell 2000 will show that Red Violet will no longer qualify to be in the Russell 2000
due to their market cap being <~$160 million (this is our estimated cut-off for inclusion).

Amputating above the knee - The Red Violet Spin


We believe that spinning off RDVT was akin to COGT amputating a gangrenous leg to
stay alive.


We strongly suspect Cogint spun RDVT off to remove Michael Brauser and his board
members and management team from the business (and all of them went with Red
Violet). This group had been arguably enriching themselves via absurd consulting
agreements, free RSUs worth $50 million (Source - 2017 Proxy pg 18 ), reimbursements
for private jets, and exorbitant payments to family members. We will highlight these
insider enrichment transactions and show why we think that cutting out the "gangrene"
was a condition for Blue Focus Limited to invest $100 million into Cogint/Fluent (press
release).


Spin-offs can sometimes offer attractive opportunity to buy a mispriced business at a
discount. Red Violet though is the opposite and instead presents a great short
opportunity!


Index/Mutual funds were forced buyers. Due to the Russell 2000 mistake, index
funds became forced buyers not sellers. To be corrected soon!

http://investors.cogint.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cogint-announces-update-business-combination-bluefocus-and-spin
Focused Business. Red Violet's business is now focused, but unfortunately, it is a
cash-burning, disadvantaged business that is likely to run out of cash within the
next 15 months.


Underfollowed but Overvalued = Red Violet is underfollowed, but it is extremely
overvalued at ~8x price to sales.


Bad Management Team & Board - Normally, you want to follow the expert
management team. In the case of RDVT, all the bad actors from COGT that are
associated with other stock promotions, fraud lawsuits, etc went with Red Violet.


A Brief History of Red Violet - It was a SPAC, reverse merger, went through 3 name
changes, auditors resigned due to alleged fraud and confirmed revenue misstatements,
and now is a spin-off of the cash-burning IDI segment. (More in Appendix A on their
history)


About the Business - Red Violet's underlying business is unprofitable and
structurally disadvantaged:


After index funds dump Red Violet, retail shareholders will still be left with a terrible
underlying business.


Fundamentals for the business are horrific. The IDI Business, which is Red Violet's
main business, has never turned a profit. 2017 net loss was $21.5 million,
remaining cash balance is just $20 million, and even after management
adjustments for litigation (future litigation risk is going with the spin), it had a
negative Adj EBITDA of $8m.


Exorbitant costs: SG&A + Sales & Marketing = ~150% of sales, and this is on a
17.6% gross margin business.
Red Violet's only revenue-generating business is idiCORE, a product that is
structurally disadvantaged since they have less access to and integration with
robust data sources.


Insiders are already selling at prices below today's - YES, week 1 of Red Violet's
existence saw large insider sales. Ryan Schulke the now FLNT CEO, sold 115k
shares at just $5.00 (Insider Sale)


Red Violet has even already tried the blockchain shuffle - they created a seemingly
meaningless blockchain division.


Red Violet (IDI's) disadvantaged business - Red Violet's idiCORE business is reselling
data from credit bureaus and other data sets (e.g., DMV, voter registration, criminal
background) to clients like private investigators. They access the databases and then
charge customers a fee to utilize their access & aggregation, which is undifferentiated
and indefensible, as many companies already do this, including the credit bureaus
themselves. A recent 2017 study of private investigators ranked IDI tied for 5th in the
field (link). The primary flaw is that they do not have access to better data than their
competitors. They get most of their personal data from doing background checks from
the major 3 credit bureaus. Additionally, IDI has a huge problem as 2 of those 3 credit
bureaus have bad relationships with IDI (now Red Violet). They were just sued by
TransUnion (TRU) for intellectual property theft which IDI settled for $7 million in 2017
(settlement link) and another major credit bureau Equifax (EFX) previously sued Michael
Brauser (Executive Chairman of RDVT) for civil fraud (link). We believe this means that
IDI can only buy their data from 1 source, Experian (OTCQX:EXPGF). We think
Experian has been able to exploit this and charge higher prices to IDI than competitors
which will never enable them to produce an actual profit. The result is Red Violet is
struggling with high COGS from a sole data provider who makes up 43% of their COGS
- (pg F14 of S-1), and they also have worse data then their competitors.


If you are a customer who is going to entrust your identification check business or any
big data analytics to a company, would you rather trust Palantir (PALAN), TransUnion,
LexisNexis (RDVT's named competitors in their S-1 - Pg 18 ) or another Michael
Brauser Company (we will go into his history later)?


Red Violet (IDI) better hope their customers don't use Google.

Blockchain Division - Questionable connection to Blockchain


Googling "Michael+Brauser+Fraud" has 10,300 relevant results!


Googling "IDI + Inc + Fraud" yields 1 customer lawsuit, 3 securities class action notices,
and 1 article about the company being worthless all within the top 10 search results of
Google. These things alone make a salesman's job almost impossible.


Forewarn Segment - is a new business in the Red Violet portfolio that is meant for Real
Estate agents to do due diligence on their clients. The service began being offered in
October 2017 at a price of $4 a month per agent and has received such poor traction
that Red Violet has begun giving it away for free. This recent press release indicates
that they are currently making the service available at no cost to both Florida's Mid-State
Association of Realtors and to BHHS Colorado Properties. We question the value
customers place on the software if RDVT were unable to win seats at a cost of only $48
per year.


Logically, it makes sense why they can barely give away Forewarn since this product is
meant to warn real estate agents if a client has past bankruptcies, verifies current
property and vehicle ownership, or has a criminal history. We spoke to multiple real
estate agents, and they confirmed that any decent real estate agent would be able to
ascertain if their client was qualified for a purchase since banks would've pre-qualified
their clients for loan would by verifying assets, etc. Delivering searches to non-paying
subscribers still cost Red Violet money as they need to pay to access the underlying
data bases.

Terrible Fundamentals:


In January 2018, the Cogint and Red Violet teams already tried to jump onto the
blockchain bandwagon by forming a questionable strategic alliance with Dragonchain.
The stated goal of this "block-chain" solution is to try to provide KYC (know your client)
solutions & ID verification on the blockchain. This is somewhat confusing for us, given
the purpose of the blockchain is that it is a decentralized ledger for transactions so you
don't have the same counterparty risk as other transactions, and thus, you trust the
ledger and don't need ID verification. Also, for the majority of people that are using
cryptocurrency, they likely do not want these transactions documented so would not be
signing up for banking KYC services anywhere. We will give a shoutout to Dragonchain
for being able to get off a mildly successful ICO raising $13.6 million via an ICO (this
happened before Red Violet invested) to support DragonCoin. DragonCoin founders
suggest that people HODL their DragonEggs.


This first meaningless announcement of a blockchain business (Press Release here)
was just Red Violet's attempt to jump onto the crypto wave despite lacking a marketable
product, customers, or any crypto-related technology. It reminds of Long Island
BlockChain Corp (formerly Long Island Iced Tea) who changed their company name but
continued doing the same iced tea business. The first blockchain press release
announcing a blockchain partnership failed to garner any investor interest. Then, Red
Violet/Cogint doubled down and purchased a small minority interest in DragonChain
(less than 5% according to block-chain press release 2). This still attracted little to no
investor interest.


I guess Brauser can't convince John McAfee to help him promote blockchain related
stocks anymore. According to reporter Teri Buhl, Brauser and Honig are trying to sue
John McAfee since they "didn't make enough money from MGTI" (article link, legal
complaint).


In case you are wondering, the company's SEC filings do not mention any crypto-related
business/technology nor any blockchain IP is mentioned or contemplated anywhere in
Red Violet's business model or Form 10. The only mentions thus far in Red Violet's SEC
filings are that they have a subsidiary named "Red Violet Blockchain & Analytical
Solutions."

Pro forma revenue at RDVT increased by $4.0 million from 2016 to 2017, but it has
taken Sales & Marketing and G&A to increase by $13.9 million to accomplish this. The
company's FCF burn was 16.9 million in 2017 alone (based on our analysis), so we
don't think the $20 million provided by Cogint in order to push all the bad actors out to
Red Violet is enough cash to even last them 2 years.


(Source - S1 pg 9 & 48)


Fraudulent Conveyance: Given the state of Red Violet's cash burn, it is not surprising
that their lawyers thought it was important to include Fraudulent Conveyance as a real
risk. Fraudulent conveyance would be relevant in the case of Red Violet if the company
filed for bankruptcy within 2 years of being spun out of Cogint (source). This seems like
a likely possibility given that 2017's annual cash burn was $10 million, and they only had
$20 million of cash when they were spun out. So, the company will either run out of cash
or face a dilutive equity raise:

Characters Involved - Michael Brauser & Co - Lawsuits alleging fraud,
SEC subpoenas, DOJ investigations, etc.:


Past failures are no guarantee of future performance.


"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"


In case you own shares in Red Violet, we think it is important that investors know the
background of the characters involved. The head of Red Violet is Michael Brauser, who
is the Chairman of the Board & Major Shareholder. Michael Brauser, his brother (a Red
Violet paid consultant), and board of directors have a history of shareholder wipeouts
and fraud accusations a mile long.


Michael Brauser has been described in the following terms by Business Insider "He's
been sued multiple times for fraud involving small, public companies." But investors
shouldn't just take Business Insider's word for it, so we will highlight all the reasons why
they said that. And later, we will present evidence of close to two decades of Michael
Brauser track record. SPOILER ALERT: it includes >20 shareholder wipeouts.


Accusations/charges against Brauser and Friends include:


SEC subpoenas - A recent common sight at Michael Brauser companies are SEC
subpoenas. An SEC enforcement subpoena came for Brauser involving a company
he was invested in, MGT Capital (SEC Subpoena) last year that requests
communications between the company and Brauser specifically by his name and
via his investment company Grander Holdings. Riot Blockchain one of his most
recent investments just received a SEC subpoena too.


Civil Fraud Accusations - there are multiple. Equifax Lawsuit accusing Brauser
of civil fraud (link - pg 6)- Equifax sued Brauser accusing him of manipulating
financials. Specifically, they filed a civil fraud case against him for creating fictitious

receivables and utilizing accounting overstatements to hide Naviant's true financial
condition. Michael Brauser was the CEO and on the Board of Directors of Naviant.


Sunair (SNR) sued Brauser, et al for federal securities laws violations.

Kast vs The Tube Media Corp. - Michael Brauser also was sued on January
30, 2009, for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty (Kast v. The Tube Media Corp.,
09-06285, in the Circuit Court for the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward
County, Florida)


Brauser's partner in founding Marlin Capital, Barry Honig name in an
SEC Securities Fraud Plea Agreement - Yes DTC lawsuit (YESD) -
(Securities Fraud Plea agreement (pg 13-16) for running a manipulative "pump
& dump" scheme). Specific accusations against Brauser's investment partner
Barry Honig. The plea details how Honig (and likely by association and
reputation Brauser) pull all the strings of these stock promotions.


Director, Management, or Large Investor in >20 companies that are complete
shareholder wipeouts.


California DOJ investigating - The California DOJ is investigating Brauser, Honig,
and the Frost Group according to Teri Buhl, an investigative reporter's article - (Teri
Buhl Article).


SEC Subpoenas:


It appears the SEC Enforcement Division has an awful lot of interest in the Brauser and
Honig Companies recently.


They recently subpoena MGT Capital Investments (OTCQB:MGTI), and it is not
surprising to see why Michael Brauser was named. Michael Brauser purchased 1.2
million shares of the company right before it began being "pumped" and went through a
business model shift to crypto. Grander Holdings (Michael Brauser's investment vehicle)
was specifically named in the MGT Capital SEC Subpoena twice, and then, all
communication with Michael Brauser was specifically requested by the SEC
Enforcement Division.


MGT Capital has since collapsed - John McAfee's mysterious new company got crushed

RIOT Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), one of the current Brauser (~2% owner) & Honig
(previously 11.4% owner) companies just received a subpoena from the SEC. They
were subject to an amazing CNBC Expose. The CNBC expose uncovered that RIOT
was likely being operated out of the office of Brauser's friend and investment partner,
Barry Honig. (Barry Honig and Michael Brauser run an entity called Marlin Capital
Partners together - Source). Even the Wall Street Journal got involved in calling BS on
this company and Honig and Brauser dumped the stock - WSJ article;


SEC subpoena (pg 16 of 10-K)


Brauser is involved via Grander Holdings, his personal investment vehicle and as
recently as February has been trying to unload his shares.

Equifax Lawsuit accusing Brauser of civil fraud - Michael Brauser's largest success
(the sale of Naviant to Equifax in 2002) turned out to be just another façade as Equifax
later sued Brauser accusing him of manipulating financials. Equifax sued Michael
Brauser for Fraud & Breach of Contract. (link) Specifically, they filed a civil fraud case
against him for creating fictitious receivables and utilizing accounting overstatements to
hid Naviant's true financial condition. Michael Brauser was both the CEO and on the
Board of Directors of Naviant. This case was ultimately settled out of court. (read the full
case of Equifax, Inc. v. Michael Brauser, et al., Case No. 04-80754 (S.D. Fla.) on

Michael Brauser and his brother have been arguably enriching themselves at Cogint
shareholders' expense, and this is set to continue at Red Violet. Michael Brauser
actually paid himself >$50,000,000 in stock awards for his consulting services. (pg 90 &
91 of 14C). We suspect that is why a condition of the new investor in COGT/FLNT was
that Brauser and his consulting contract both have to go with the Red Violet entity.


The consulting agreement with Michael Brauser was amended on June 23, 2017, to
force him to stop his ridiculous payouts from COGT (New Consulting Agreement). But
along with spinning off the money losing IDI (now Red Violet) business, Red Violet also
inherits Michael Brauser's consulting agreement and the baggage that comes with that.

Cogint bad apples all went with the spin RDVT - (Dubner, Brauser, the other Board
Members connected to shareholder wipeouts went with RDVT) - Based on reading the
proxy around the agreement, we think that Fluent management or Blue Focus Limited
(Fluent's new investor) pushed out the people that were arguably enriching themselves
at company's expense or perhaps they left due to their change of control agreements.
Either way, Red Violet now has the whole barrel of bad apples leading it.

CSO Ole Poulsen, and COO James Reilly all involved in TLO (Assets sold in

undisclosed stock promotion.


A Brief History of Red Violet - SPAC, Reverse Merger, 3 Name Changes, Auditors
resigning due to reporting false revenue numbers, and now a Spin-off!


Red Violet came to the public markets as the child of a SPAC that bought a "China
Hustle" advertising company, followed by a reverse merger, 3 company name changes,
1 big 4 auditor resignation, and finally a spin-off of the cash burning segment of Cogint
which we believe to have been an already poor business.


2007 - SearchMedia - created when Ideation Acquisition Corp. (a SPAC) purchased a
Chinese company and became Search Media. (Source - Settled lawsuit alleging false &
misleading statements). Philip Frost became a major shareholder.


In 2010, SearchMedia was ultimately discovered to have been overstating revenue
and did a significant revenue reversal, its auditor KPMG resigned citing deficient
controls and suspicious related party transactions. This Lawsuit against SMIL
alleging fraud that the company settle sums it up (SMIL lawsuit)


2012 - Tiger Media - SearchMedia was renamed Tiger Media (IDI) - Best description is
a Chinese out of home advertising company (source pg 1). Tiger Media was formed
during the Chinese Reverse Merger Boom highlighted in the "China Hustle
Documentary" (source)


2015 - March 21 - Tiger Media acquired in a reverse merger by The Best One = Tiger
Media + TBO changes name to IDI Inc. (source pg 1, also here). Derek Dubner joins as
CEO & Michael Brauser joins Board as Executive Chairman.


2015 - December 8 - IDI Inc. (IDI) acquires Fluent (source pg 1)


2016 - September 14 - IDI Inc. (IDI) changes name to Cogint Inc. (COGT) - (source)


2017 - September 6 - Cogint Inc. announces "spinning-off" money losing IDI inc assets
as Red Violet (Source - Separation Agreement);

Appendix B


Valuation:


Conclusion - Strong Sell - Short!


2018 - March 27 - Red Violet becomes a public company - All board members or
management that have either been accused of fraud or been involved in other
companies that have gone down by >85% go with the spin and join Red Violet


2018 - April 16 - Cogint changes (COGT) name to Fluent - presumably to separate new
company from Cogint's shady past.


Further Reading/Resources on Brauser, Frost, and Honig:


Thanks to the multitude of other short sellers & reporters that have exposed Michael
Brauser, Philip Frost, and Barry Honig related companies in the past. We suggest that
diligent investors read some of the great work by PumpStopper, BleekerStreet,
Unemon, Lakewood Capital, Teri Buhl, CNBC and the WSJ in order to gain even more
context.


We would normally start by providing our own methodology for valuing RDVT but luckily
Red Violet CEO, Derek Dubner, has an investing blog where he has provided his own
advice on how to value companies. Derek's investment advice is that "a company with a
P/E Ratio at par with the overall market or a relatively lower one is a good purchase."
Thus, we will follow Derek's own advice in valuing Red Violet, and by that metric, we
think that RDVT will ultimately be worth $0.00 since they have never earned positive
EPS or EBITDA.


Our immediate price target comes from valuing the idiCORE money losing business at
0.5x sales + the current estimated cash balance of $18.3 million which = $22.33 million
or $2.16 a share.


Long term, we think that the company will be worth $0.00 in <18 months when all the
cash is gone, either that or, they will be forced to do a dilutive equity offering.


Near-term price target of $2.16 and 1.5 year out price target is $0.00.

Red Violet represents a great opportunity as lots of spin-offs do. In this situation, it is as
a Short! The suspect management, terrible business fundamentals, involvement of
Michael Brauser & Philip Frost, insider enrichment of the company, and history of
shareholder wipeouts present an amazing opportunity. The real urgency to sell now is to
sell before the index funds do.


More important than the cash burn that will cause Red Violet to dilute shareholders/file
for bankruptcy within the next 18 months or the Brauser & Co management team is the
near-term selling that will come from the Russell 2000. In the next month (or sooner),
the Russell 2000 index funds will be forced to dump all the shares they recently
acquired of RDVT, which will cause the stock to collapse by 50% or more via likely
forced index selling.
