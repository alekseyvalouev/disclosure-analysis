China Medical Technologies: Does Missed Coupon Mean Company
Will Go Dark?
Feb. 2, 2012 5:57 AM ET25 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We think China Medical Technologies (CMED) is an attractive short at current levels, and
that its missed interest payment supports Glaucus Research's report arguing that CMED's
equity will end up being worthless. Most ominously, CMED's non-payment may indicate
that the company is no longer interested in meeting its obligations to foreign shareholders
and is preparing to go dark, following in the footsteps of many other troubled U.S.-listed
Chinese companies whose management teams simply disappeared into the sunset after
fraud was discovered at their companies.


China Medical's payment default was made public last week, when Fitch Ratings
announced that China Medical Technologies had missed the coupon payment on its $125
million 6.25% convertible senior notes due 2016, and it downgraded the company's rating
to "Restricted Default." Standard & Poor's has subsequently downgraded the company to
"SD", which indicates that a company has selectively defaulted on some obligations. As of
yesterday, both the 2013 and 2016 convertible notes traded at a bid price of 25 cents on
the dollar.


I contacted the company's bondholder trustee at Wilmington Trust, who confirmed that
"the company did not pay its 12/15/2011 coupon nor did it pay it in the grace period which
expired 1/14/2012." The trustee said that Wilmington Trust "will be sending a Notice of
Default very shortly."


I also reached out to Richard Thorp of Thorp Alberga, who is the company's Cayman legal
representative and is in charge of forwarding noteholder inquiries to the company via the
email address cmednoteholders@thorpalberga.com. Thorp has not been privy to any
bondholder restructuring plans nor has been informed of the company's restructuring
intentions, saying that he doesn't "know what their intended line is at all".


Interestingly, the company did not bother to report the missed coupon payment. It has
been more than two weeks since the grace period ended on January 14th, and China
Medical has still not issued a press release or 8K explaining the missed payment. As an
aside, this is a violation of SEC disclosure regulations, given that a missed coupon
payment on a company's bond securities is certainly a material event.

An Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee has been formed and has been working with legal
counsel Hogan Lovells to negotiate with the company. Neil MacDonald of Hogan Lovells,
who is one of the partners on the case, currently represents the official committee of
unsecured creditors (comprising primarily bondholders) in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of
ShengdaTech, Inc. (OTC:SDTH). He and other lawyers at Hogan Lovells also represent a
large bondholder group in relation to Sino-Forest (OTC:SNOFF) as well as a bondholder
group for China Forestry Holdings Co Ltd., the halted Hong Kong-listed Chinese forestry
company.


Equity holders in ShengdaTech, Sino-Forest and China Forestry have been virtually wiped
out.


From our discussions with Hogan Lovells and Wilmington Trust, the company has not
reached out to bondholders to begin negotiations on a debt restructuring. On December
14th, the eve of the coupon payment, the company surprised the market by announcing
the following:


The Company intends to implement a debt restructuring plan to improve its balance
sheet. The plan may include, without limitation, a debt-for-debt exchange with
existing holders of the Company's convertible notes maturing in August 2013 and
December 2016, which may potentially involve holders receiving new debts with
different interest rates, maturities and principal amounts compared to the existing
debts or other alternatives to be agreed.


Given the company's large reported cash balance, this release was unexpected. China
Medical's should not need to restructure its debt if its balance sheet is anywhere near as
liquid as the company claims.


CMED reported $206.5 million of cash on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2011.
The company's missed coupon payment would have amounted to less than $5 million of
cash outflow. It's difficult to believe that the company would voluntarily decline to make its
scheduled payment if it did in fact have $206.5 million of cash. Instead, similar to many
prior U.S.-listed Chinese companies like China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME) and
China-Biotics (OTCQB:CHBT), it is far more believable that the large reported cash
balance does not actually exist and that China Medical Technologies is misrepresenting
itself in its financial statements.

The missing payment naturally bodes very poorly for China Medical's equity holders. We'd
be surprised if bondholders willingly took haircuts to their claims while equity holders stood
by unaffected. More likely, bondholders would demand equity or dilutive securities if
they're being required to take writedowns on their security claims.


Missed Interest Payments: This Never Ends Well


China Medical is far from the first Chinese company listed outside of the mainland to stiff
bondholders on a required payment. And the range of outcomes for equity holders in
these scenarios has been between, at best, quite poor, to at worst, a complete loss of all
value in the common equity. During the previous spate of Chinese scandals, when a wave
of Singapore-listed Chinese companies failed in the so-called S-Chip scandal, numerous
mainland Chinese companies listed in Singapore suddenly lost interest in servicing their
debt, despite the fact that they appeared to have large cash balances and substantial
cash flow. A 2010 article from the South China Morning Post reported that:


Since late 2007, a spate of so-called S-chips - mainland companies listed on the
Singapore exchange - have borrowed money then failed to repay the debts, with
some becoming mired in fraud scandals. Of the 11 S-chips that issued convertible
bonds between 2005 and 2008, six have declared themselves unable to repay […]
Another five S-chips failed to repay bank loans during 2008-9. The effects on their
share prices have been, predictably, crushing.


The majority of these tainted S-chip companies have gone on to see their shares delisted
and shares have ended up worthless. For example, look at the case of China Milk
Products Group, a company that produced bull semen and cow embryos for sale to cattle
breeding operations. When investors in the company's convertible debt used an option
attached to the bonds to demand immediate repayment of the debt, China Milk's balance
sheet seemed to indicate that there was plenty of cash available to repay creditors.


China Milk's last annual report, for fiscal year 2009, claimed that the company had $239
million of cash versus $150 million of convertible notes. Furthermore, the company
claimed to have generated $51 million of cash flow from operating activities in the
previous year. The company's balance sheet appeared to be sufficiently strong to service
its debt with cash to spare.


The company blamed its failure to repay creditors on foreign exchange regulations that
had trapped its funds outside the country, and claimed that it would pay bond holders as
soon as possible. However, the debt was never repaid, and the company went dark.

Management disappeared, and finally, in July 2011 - 18 months later - liquidators were put
in charge of the company. It is unclear what, if anything, bond holders will recover. Equity
holders suffered a complete loss.


China Milk Products is just one example out of many where a bond default precipitated a
complete collapse of the company with equity holders completely wiped out. Celestial
Nutrifoods is another that failed to pay off its debt and entered liquidation within 18 months
after with shareholder equity entirely destroyed. FTI Consulting, the liquidator of the
remains of Celestial Nutrifoods, believes that Celestial Nutrifoods' management team
fraudulently transfered money out of the company just prior to that company's debt default.


In 2008, before the management allegedly began stripping assets, Celestial Nutrifoods
had $119 million of cash to support $180 million of debt, according to its annual report.
When the company defaulted on its debt in 2009, it still claimed to have $53 million in its
cash reserves. There is no reason to believe this company needed to default voluntarily.
Like China Milk and now China Medical, it claimed to have sufficient cash on its balance
sheet at the time it defaulted.


The list goes on and on. China Sun Bio-Chem, China Enersave, China Printing & Dyeing
and numerous others have stiffed bondholders, engaged in alleged accounting
irregularities, and ended up leaving shareholders with nothing. And even in the few
situations where the defaulted debt has eventually been serviced, the results have not
been pretty.


Take, for example, the case of Neo-China. The company is a Hong-Kong listed property
developer in Mainland China that failed to make a coupon payment in 2009. Neo-China
claimed to have more than HK$2 billion in cash and that its payment was merely delayed
due to China's Spring Festival (see here). Nonetheless, Moody's slashed Neo-China's
rating to its second lowest level possible after the late payment.


Neo-China's stock plunged 45 percent when its stock was finally reopened for trading after
a long halt, and the stock (now renamed Shanghai Industrial Urban Development) has
dropped an additional 50 percent in the subsequent 18 months. The former chairman of
Neo-China has become a wanted man by Hong Kong's anti-corruption authorities for
making illegal property transactions with the goal of "artificially inflat[ing] the profit and
assets of Neo-China."


Even in cases such as Neo-China where bondholders get their money eventually, equity
holders still lose. Well-run companies just do not voluntarily default on debt. Missing debt
payments - in Neo-China's case supposedly due to a holiday - is usually a sign of fraud or

malfeasance.


Does the Missed Coupon Payment Confirm the Glaucus Fraud Allegations?


This non-payment is suspicious especially in light of the Glaucus report issued last month.
In December, Glaucus issued a 23-page report that alleged the following:


CMED paid $28 million for an acquisition from a seller who [Glaucus] believes was
secretly related to CMED's chairman. Evidence also shows that CMED radically
overpaid for the acquisition: a few months before selling the company to CMED, a
company controlled by parties related to CMED insiders bought out minority
shareholders at prices suggesting that the business was worth $5-$8 million, not the
$28 million paid by CMED for the acquisition.
Despite a purportedly profitable business, CMED is a serial capital raiser and has not
generated free cash flow for most of its history. The company has spent twice as much
on "investing activities" as it has purportedly generated from operations, so much like a
typical Chinese fraud, it relies on debt or equity financing as its primary source of cash
generation.
CMED's balance sheet presents numerous highly suspicious red flags. CMED's
receivables account for a much higher percentage of net revenues than its Chinese
competitors and its Day Sales Outstanding are on average 141.9 days longer than a
leading Chinese competitor, despite the fact that both companies sell similar products
to similarly situated customers.
In 2009, an anonymous letter to the audit committee accused senior management of
committing fraud with respect to the company's financials and its acquisitions. After an
investigation by the audit committee, CMED's auditor, KPMG, resigned.


In the context of Glaucus' evidence for financial misrepresentation, the company's missed
coupon payment makes more sense. The company may be misrepresenting itself in its
financial statements, and therefore may not have sufficient cash to pay its near-term debt
obligations.


One explanation for the coupon non-payment is that the Glaucus report triggered the
beginnings of a deeper audit by the company's auditors at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. If
CMED management came to believe that there would be a high chance the company fails
its audit for fiscal year 2011, management may have begun draining the company's bank
accounts and transferring operating assets to private related parties. Under this scenario,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/334732-china-medical-technologies-does-missed-coupon-mean-company-will-go-dark 6/12


management could deem that it wouldn't make sense to send cash to foreign noteholders,
when the bonds would default upon a PWC resignation and likely equity trading halt
anyways.


A similar stock trading halt could occur if independent directors forced the company to
undergo an independent inquiry. As we have seen with companies like ShengdaTech and
Jiangbo Pharmaceuticals, independent directors can play a critical role in forcing
companies to open their books to outside third parties. As such, we could envision a
scenario where the Glaucus report triggered inquiries from the company's independent
board members, particularly its non-Chinese directors Iain Bruce and Lawrence Crum. Mr.
Bruce is a retired KPMG accountant and Dr. Crum is a research professor in electrical
engineering and bioengineering at the University of Washington. They likely do not have
much to gain from a cover-up. It's possible that they have urged for an independent
investigation, and that the management team has seen the writing on the wall and decided
to disengage foreign claimholders. Again, the thesis would be that management has
realized the likelihood of a trading halt, and has begun looting the public company's
assets.


Conclusion


Looking back at what has happened when other Chinese companies have voluntarily
defaulted on their debt, we think the outcome with China Medical is somewhat predictable
for equity holders. In most cases with S-Chips that skipped convertible note payments, the
default was not the only issue with the company; usually fraud, embezzlement, and other
unethical activities were being engaged in by the management teams. With Glaucus
having already laid out a compelling argument to suggest that China Medical is engaged
in questionable activities, we view this debt default as a sign that the company is following
the path of many S-chip companies. We fear that the company will soon go dark, with
management disappearing and the company ending up in liquidation, leaving equity
holders with nothing.

Very well written and researched article, thanks. One thing I'm wondering, how do these Chinese frauds trick the
auditors into thinking they have that much cash? Don't the auditors check the bank statements?


For example, A-Power energy (APWR.PK) showed it has $168M in cash and only $65M in debt, with a book value of
$6.83 per share.

Author’s reply »  Thanks Adam for the kind words.


I think there are a variety of ways companies in China can fake their cash. They can bribe bank officials, and
there are numerous instances of that. They can also borrow cash overnight or for very short periods to pass
the audit check, and then repay the cash once the auditors have checked the bank account. There is a
significant black market in China to lend cash to companies that want to pass their audits.


In the case of CHBT, China Biotics management created a fake bank website that they would direct their
auditors to.

Adam Gefvert;


China are the most advanced forgerers on the planet, in my opinon. China certainly has the longest history of
engaging in forgery, and it appears that have engaged in more forgery historically than any other country. A
long way of saying that it is quite easy for them to provide excellent forgeries of bank statements and other
documents. If the accounting firm attempts to check with the bank, the company can also provide a phony
contact that pretends to be a bank representative verifying the transaction, bribe a bank official, or merely
seek repayment of favors owed, aka guanxi. Many commentators have indicated that China does not have a

Thanks. I covered the rest of my shares at $1.76 yesterday. I had covered most much earlier at between
$0.80-$1.30. But now, the stock is continually going up. This is even though the bonds are currently only
trading at 30 cents on the dollar. I don't understand what's going on, and when I don't understand a stock, I
usually prefer not to get involved.

Thanks for sharing your research in this article. I was on the fence, holding to see whether they make their February
coupon payment, but by then I realize my entire position could be wiped out. Just folded today. I'll be watching the
company closely for an entry point if management changes its tune, but that's not looking likely.


This isn't the first time I've been ripped off doing business in China. It seems as though defrauding foreigners is a
national past time. It will come around to bite them in the a$$, though.


If CMED's financial statements weren't fraudulent, this would be the buy of a lifetime!

Sorry but Sino-Forest 3 person U.S. auditor committee just reported that the land in question by Muddy waters was
5% larger than on the books. Equity holders will see increase in share price upon re open for trading. These short
funds are having a field day spreading false info. Muddy will be sued by Sino until they cry uncle. What would happen
if Muddy spread report that Exxon was over stating its acreage? China Med situation is more iffy in that they are mum
and trustee has not heard anything about interest forebearance.

So, playing devil's advocate to your thesis, what would be the possible scenarios to consider for missing the interest
payment in the short-term if indeed the company's books are as the auditors say they are ... and CMED has the
ample cash on hand to pay? Are there some possible financial angles here that the company might be playing, that
shareholders might also want to consider?


02 Feb 2012, 11:44 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks Jacob1 for your question. I'm going to have to turn that question back to you. I don't
think there is a scenario here where equity holders are left better off subsequent to a coupon non-payment. If
you can think of a hypothetical scenario, I'd be happy to address it.

There aren't any angles I can consider. Why piss off the bondholders? If the company has the cash, the
bondholders can take it all. If they don't have the cash, everyone loses.


The only thing that the shareholders have is to hope that the management are just idiots who neglected to
pay the interest payments. That's the best case senario if you own shares.

Nice article, and good call, KCM. Your examples of similar situations were listed on foreign exchanges. Do
you know of US listed Chinese companies that similarly skipped a bond payment and "went dark?" I've looked
back at many Chinese company trade halts and found that most were due to audit problems and failure to file
restated financial reports on time, but haven't found one in CMED's situation. I haven't even found one that
went dark in any situation. It'd be very helpful to see US listed examples of what will likely happen here. The
ultimate outcome of the stock price is very important for me to forecast to make a decision now. With no
further information (seemingly the news media have gone dark on CMED, as well), it's really hard to figure out
whether it's likely that the executives have absconded with all liquid assets, or whether they simply deserted
when they couldn't make bond payment, and there might be something left for equity. One is total
embezzlement, whereas the other is simply accounting fraud. Thanks.

Rob Viglione:


If the Chinese management are crooks, then it is likely they have been crooks from the outset, concocting a
pump and dump scam to rip off investors from the beginning. It is very unlikely they are crooks, but then have
been operating a good, legitimate, profitable business that they took public, then didn't make a bond payment
to drop prices so they can pick them up cheap. If they want shares cheap, they just issue themselves free
stock and stock options for free. Thus, I put the odds of your scenario at slim and none, and slim got shot . . .
in other words, 0.

Even if there is a credible explanation for the default in the convertible bond payment, there is still a serious failure of
communication by the company.


On the subject of substantial accounts receivables, it could be possible that the company’s business contains a
greater proportion of products sold direct to hospitals, instead of indirectly through a distributor. Local authority
establishments in China are known for taking longer to pay bills compared to private entities. Nevertheless, it is fair to
say that unusually high levels of accounts receivables can also be an indicator of cooked books, and the case of
Yinguanxia, China’s most famous fraud, is testament to that.


It is also worth mentioning that the company has recorded 2,943,624RMB of unpatented technology assets on its
balance sheet, which equates to some 60% of its total assets. This is a very large amount. Moreover, this “unpatented
technology” has been assigned a weighted average amortization period (equivalent to depreciation period) of 20
years. This seems like a very long life for unpatented technology, especially in China, and again an explanation is
needed. Such a large proportion of intangibles may explain why the company needed to issue unsecured convertible
bonds to raise finance, since it would have been difficult to obtain cheaper bank lending secured against these assets.

From yahoo message board:


I was asked in another comment why I'm unsure and why I have doubts.


#1 reason is the complete difference in attitude. In the last years, CMED projected an image of professional business
like behavior. When a letter was sent, they reacted promptly with an investigation, when auditor changed they made
everything in their power to calm things convicing KPMG to write a support letter that was added as annex to their
annual report, when recent Glaucus report was released, CMED replied in 6-7 hours with PR of several pages. 
They promptly released information about receiving some ADS back from creditors. Equally fast was a reaction that
the 2011 notes were redeemed in full without dilution.


Suddenly, Fitch tries a week to contact CMED, fails and stop monitoring the company for rating. CMED missed a
payment for more than 1.5 months (more than 6 weeks). Chinese New Year is not a plausible cause. Any CFO on the
planet has a mobile phone. At least, CMED could have said that they will reply on Feb xth. But this is not a sudden
event. CMED has 6 weeks of being late.


So, suddenly, CMED is the most unprofessional and not-business-like company. A complete turn from the image they
projected up to late Nov. That is surprising to me: how come all the sudden this behavioral change.

The balance sheet of CMED on 9/30/11 show negative tangible asset (i.e. the total debt > total tangible asset). This is
fine as long as the operating concern is generating free cash (examples include Kroger after the huge cash dividend
in the early 1990s, tobacco company like MO and PM) and has the ability to pay back the debt by due date.


I totally agree with Adam that the sudden behavior change by CMED is puzzling. The CFO is a CPA, licensed both in
Hong Kong and the U.S. (per Form 20F year 2010-11). He should know this behavior could cause him losing his

To say that companies like CMED defraud foreigners is not correct. The truth is that many Chinese companies
defraud anyone including Chinese as well. Pretty much like Maddoff defrauded his own ethical people and other
Americans and foreign investors.


To be sure, fraudsters are blind to nationals or ethnicals. They cheat all kinds of people.


In CMED case, I offer my humble view: The company management is delighted to see the share price collapse and
go to zero and get delisted, upon which they can own the company for free from other investors. Again, this is simply
my guess work.

This is well done, even though the author is short the stock. CMED has not responded and still has not filed anything
on the missed coupon with the SEC. (disclosure: I have no position in CMED and will not take one in the next 3 days).

It's not about the cash, it's about the level of debt. 
You just have to look at Enterprise Value in relation to Market cap to see my point.


Market cap = $50M 
Enterprise Value = $260M


Enterprise Value = Market cap + debt - cash. 
You can figure out the rest.


It took me 5 minutes and I know nothing about the company.


And Kerrisdale... it is always fun to show everyone how foolish you are.

Good Report. Just a couple of questions? 1. Market Watch last week indicated that the coupon payment was late but
that all account payables and current operating expenses were being paid. 2. As late as June 2011 three company
officers were purchasing stock at 5, 6, & 7 dollars a share. (if books were being cooked, why purchase stock). 3. Hard
to believe that two major accounting firms who were performing the audits were hood winked and miss all the signs of
fraud & mis management. Big question I have is why company officials are not making some type of comment and
refuse to answer questions ??????

RAMO, do you have a link for that? That says something if the accounts payable and operating expenses are
getting paid. However, it might also mean the company is continuing with the business but still won't pay the
bonds so will end up bankrupt anyways.

What use is EV if you can't be certain of the integrity of the data being fed? Despite having $206 million in cash on the
books as of end 2Q, the company (1) has not been paying any dividends, (2) had little positive free cash flow as result
of the huge run-up in receivables, and (3) failed to pay the coupon on their convertible notes, amounting to just 5% of
their declared cash.


Moreover, EV dictates that the debt of the target company be in good standing. If the debt has a "default" rating, it is
considered next to worthless, and hence nothing really to add on to the market cap to get the EV. In this situation,
CMED's EV is actually $50m (market cap) + $0m (worthless debt) - $206m (cash) = -$156 million.

Anyone who buys into CMED didn't really understand Chinese business at all, no company in China spent 3 billion
RMB on unpatented techonology, they'd rather steal the key personnels, for much less. For the future, whenever you
see intangibles on Chinese books, read zero instead.

I agree. Look what happened with AMSC. Sinovel instead of buying AMSC propietary technology, bribed a
key personnel which was way cheaper.

Kerrisdale Capital are a bunch of losers. I bought every stock they shorted. 
Well, not this one because I don't know the company.
