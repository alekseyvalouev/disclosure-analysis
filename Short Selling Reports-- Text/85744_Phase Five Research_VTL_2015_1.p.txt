Vital’s ELAD system is using an immortal line of human cancer liver cells to filter
the blood of acute liver failure patients.


After over 20 years of R&D and several bankruptcies, the ELAD technology has yet
to succeed in a single pivotal trial with statistical significance.


ELAD failed to demonstrate superiority across any parameters when compared to
the MARS system, an approved non-biological liver dialysis system.


Based on past clinical data and patient baseline characteristics, we assume that
Vital’s ongoing VTI-208 phase 3 study will fail to demonstrate statistical significance
in 91-day overall survival.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3325155-vital-therapies-elad-vtiminus-208-study-chronicle-of-a-failure-foretold?source=all_articles_title 2/19


In 2003 Vital Therapies (VTL) emerged from the ashes of two bankrupt companies who
had been trying to develop the Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device (ELAD) biological liver
dialysis technology for over 10 years. Hepatix Inc, founded in 1991, was the initial
developer of ELAD. The company declared bankruptcy by 1996 and was re-registered
under the trade name VitaGen - which in turn went bankrupt in 2003. The ELAD
technology was acquired by Vital Therapies in the bankruptcy proceedings of VitaGen
and, over 20 years later, the technology has yet to succeed in a single pivotal trial with
statistical significance.


The ELAD system is using an immortal line of liver cells to filter the blood of acute liver
failure (ALF) patients. Although this solution sounds highly lucrative, ELAD appears to
be nothing more than living proof that the efficacy of such a system does not currently
extend beyond sheer theoretical hype. Throughout ELAD's laborious 20-year quest in
search of patients it can help, both the weight of the cells in a single ELAD cartridge and
the number of hepatic indications at which the device has tried its luck have steadily
accumulated. Unfortunately, neither did the trick as the technology has yet to find its
match in terms of hepatic indication and, due to the fact that liver disease comprises one
of the most heterogeneous patient populations in medicine, this may take a very long
time.


According to Vital's latest annual report, the U.S. FDA is also skeptical of ELAD: "the
FDA has noted its view that preliminary clinical evidence…does not indicate that the
ELAD System may demonstrate a substantial improvement over the current standard of
care". Added to that is the fact that the incidence of most adverse events was found to
be nearly three-fold in ELAD-treated patients vs control (and vs patients treated with
other dialysis systems in similar settings), and the fact that ELAD runs a potential risk of
leaking cancerous liver cells into the very patients it treats.


Performance in previous trials is a good indication of the drug/therapy's performance in
future trials, and in the case of VTL, the future appears to be a total failure. After dozens
of studies in humans and petri dishes ELAD has given absolutely no indication that it
can demonstrate statistical significance in the ongoing Phase 3 trials.

An even more telling sign of failure is the fact that ELAD failed to demonstrate
superiority across any parameters when compared to a standard non-biological liver
dialysis system, perhaps superseding such a device only in its cost, being approximately
10 times more expensive. When the results of ELAD's latest trial were directly compared
with the Phase 3 results of the non-biological MARS dialysis system (with the obvious
limitations of a cross trial comparison), ELAD was shown to have poorer efficacy even
despite the fact that MARS failed its Phase 3 study. For this reason it is extremely
unlikely that the VTI-208 trial, the results of which are being awaited in Q3 '15, will meet
its 91-day overall survival primary endpoint.


Liver Failure & Standard of Care


Acute liver failure refers to the rapid onset of liver dysfunction in a patient without
chronic liver disease. When acute liver failure occurs in the presence of underlying liver
disease, such as with alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD), the condition is
referred to as acute-on-chronic liver failure.


According to Vital, alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD) is caused by the recent
ingestion of alcohol and can occur with or without chronic underlying liver disease. One
common and well-recognized form of AILD is Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis (AAH), which is
characterized by inflammation and enlargement of the liver. ALF is associated with a
50%+ morality rate; AAH is currently associated with a mortality rate of 30% to 60% in
the short term.


During ALF, the standard of care is aimed at controlling complications while the toxin
loads are slowly diminished and the liver is allowed to heal, or while a transplant
becomes available. Steroid treatment to reduce inflammation is the most common
intervention, along with anti-cytokine therapy and combination regimens involving
vitamin nutrition and antioxidants.


Liver dialysis


In addition to the abovementioned standard of care, liver dialysis may be used to
temporarily compensate for hepatic function while the liver regenerates, or as a bridge
to transplant. Although not yet standard procedure, non-biological liver dialysis is
becoming more commonplace following recent FDA approvals for a number of hepatic
indications.

MARS non-biological liver dialysis system


Perhaps the best known non-biological dialysis device is the Molecular Absorbent
Recirculating System, or MARS, manufactured by Gambro [now part of Baxter (BAX)].
MARS uses human serum albumin contained behind a semipermeable membrane to
trap toxins from the blood.


MARS was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute intoxication and poisoning in
2005 and for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in 2013, but failed to demonstrate
a statistically significant 28-day survival benefit in trials on patients with acute-on-chronic
liver failure. As will be detailed in depth below, in this failed study, 81% of patients were
similar to the group of patients ELAD is currently being tested on. MARS performed
better than ELAD across all parameters which were made known to the public.


Although non-biological dialysis has been proven effective in some indications,
physicians argue that biological tissue is ultimately crucial for optimal liver dialysis. It has
been suggested that primary hepatocytes appear to be the most appropriate cells for
use in a bio-artificial liver. They should, in theory, provide all the metabolic functions
necessary to support an ALF patient with a limited immunological response.


More than 30 different hepatocyte-based support devices have been reported since
1987, and more than 14 systems have been reported in clinical trials. However, no bio-
artificial liver system has ever showed a significant benefit, and has ever obtained FDA
approval for the treatment of liver failure. Development of the majority of cell-based liver
dialysis systems has been discontinued.


ELAD - Extracorporeal Liver Dialysis System


ELAD contains a C3A hepatocyte cell-line that was originally isolated from an
aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma. In ELAD, about a pound of C3A cells is contained
in four hollow fiber cartridges behind a membrane which allows the passage of up to
~160 kDa blood components.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3325155-vital-therapies-elad-vtiminus-208-study-chronicle-of-a-failure-foretold?source=all_articles_title 5/19


Although Vital's C3A cells are technically hepatocytes, recent studies have shown that
these immortalized cell lines do not express normal metabolic profiles in comparison
with primary hepatocytes. Another study has shown that although C3A cells produce
urea, they do not express significant levels of all urea cycle genes and, therefore, do not
detoxify ammonia.


Another issue surrounding ELAD is the possibility of transmission of oncogenic cells
during therapy. Although the cells do not directly mix with the patient's blood, just a
single C3A cell leak could potentially result in cancer.


ELAD Clinical Studies: No Statistical Significance to Date


To date, ELAD has been tested in at least six various clinical trials on nearly as many
indications (table 1). The only time the therapy demonstrated any kind of statistically
significant clinical benefit was in a viral hepatitis trial conducted on 68 subjects in China
(study VTIC-301) - and even then, statistical significance was dubious as it was
achieved only across some of the survival endpoints.


The protocol of study VTIC-301 was amended mid-trial in order to enroll less sick
patients and shorten ELAD treatment time. In the total 68-patient cohort, ELAD
managed to demonstrate statistical significance only on one out of four survival
length endpoints - the 28-day survival (p = 0.015), while No benefit on 14-, 56- and 84-
day survival was demonstrated. In the pre-amendment 49-patient cohort, statistical
significance was achieved on days 28 and 56 (p=0.015 and 0.026 respectively), with no
statistical significance shown on days 14 and 84. Following the VTIC-301 trial VTL
applied for marketing approval with the Chinese FDA (CFDA) in 2007. This application
is still pending - according to VTL it is subject to approval of ELAD by the U.S. FDA
(source: VTL 2014 annual report, p. 13).

Phase 2 VTI-206 study: "Trend towards statistical significance" is exaggerated


Most recently, Vital ran study VTI-206 - a randomized, open-label, controlled, Phase 2b
clinical trial of ELAD in 62 AILD (used interchangeably with AAH in the company's
presentations) and non-AILD (non-AAH) subjects. The primary endpoint was time to
progression at which a 5-point or greater Model for End stage Liver Disease
(OTC:MELD) score is recorded relative to baseline and 90-day overall survival. In each
of the pre-defined cohorts, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ELAD plus
standard therapy, or standard therapy alone.


In January 2011, the trial's Data Safety and Monitoring Board reported that only the
AILD cohort had the possibility of showing any treatment effect and therefore
recommended the discontinuation of the non-AILD cohort. However, the FDA reviewer
raised statistical concerns about discontinuation of half of the trial's patients, and the
whole trial was terminated ahead of time when 37 subjects were enrolled in the pre-
defined AILD cohort. The ongoing VTI-208 trial is essentially the continuation (or re-run)
of VTI-206 but which enrolls only AILD patients.

In the VTI-206 non-AILD cohort, ELAD actually performed significantly worse than
the control group, with the control group "out-surviving" the ELAD patient group
nearly three-fold (table 2; figure 1a).


Table 2. The percentage of patients reaching 90-day survival in VTI-206 trial


The AILD subset showed a non-significant trend (p=0.27) toward improved 90-day
overall survival (OS) of 69.2% in the ELAD System-treated group versus 43.8% in the
control group - however, this figure is highly misleading as it includes survival data
from a patient in the AILD group who received a liver transplant. Although transplants
were allowed by the trial's protocol, this patient's survival was not due to ELAD. This is
particularly relevant as no equivalent patient in the control group received a transplant. If
the transplant patient is removed from the AILD ELAD responder cohort, the 90-day OS
becomes 61.5% (8 patients out of 13 in the per-protocol population).


The transplant is mentioned in only one of the company's presentations (fig. 2), and is
not mentioned in any of the company's financial reports. The more accurate transplant-
free OS data of 61.5% in the AILD group vs 43% in the control group is far from
statistical significance, as it actually equates to a difference of just one patient.

The VTI-208 study and why it is likely to fail

Following the "trend towards significance" which was observed in the AILD patients in
VTI-206, VTL decided to run VTI-208 - an extended trial which enrolls only AILD
patients. The trial is a Phase 3 randomized study to evaluate safety and efficacy of
ELAD with respect to overall survival of subjects up to at least Study Day 91, with follow-
up Protocol VTI-208E providing additional survival data up to a maximum of 5 years.


The company laid out strict inclusion and particularly exclusion criteria in order to select
patients most similar to those who responded to ELAD in VTI-206. The trial will attempt
to exclude patients who may be too healthy ("an improvement in bilirubin levels of 20%
or more in the past 72 hours & regenerable liver") or too sick ("High mortality rate, a liver
that is less than 10cm in size").


On April 27, 2015, the company released the full patient characteristics of the VTI-208
trial (shown in Table 5).


Below are reasons why the trial is very likely to fail:


1. The MARS Non-biological Liver Dialysis system outperforms ELAD across all
known parameters but still failed to show survival benefit


As the following sections will demonstrate, the non-biological MARS dialysis device is
actually more efficient than ELAD at lowering levels of most known serum toxins.
Despite this, the Phase 3 RELIEF trial, which tested the efficacy of MARS in patients
with acute-on-chronic liver failure, did not demonstrate a statistically significant clinical
benefit.


The MARS RELIEF trial was an open-label Phase 3 study which compared MARS
therapy to standard medical therapy in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The
trial demonstrated a significant decrease in serum bilirubin and creatinine levels and an
improvement in hepatic encephalopathy for patients treated with MARS therapy in
comparison to patients receiving standard medical therapy, but did not demonstrate a
statistically significant difference in survival between MARS therapy and standard
medical therapy. The 28-day survival was similar in the two groups in both the ITT and
per protocol populations (60.7% versus 58.9%; 60% versus 59.2% respectively).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3325155-vital-therapies-elad-vtiminus-208-study-chronicle-of-a-failure-foretold?source=all_articles_title 10/19


The OS of patients in VTI-206 was 69% (61.5% transplant-free) at day 90 which was the
same as the OS on day 30, as all the patients died by day 30 in the study (see Fig. 2b).
Thus VTI-206 and RELIEF trials can be argued to have achieved a near-identical result
- but a crucial fact to consider is that the RELIEF trial was at least three times
larger in patient number than VTI-206, and the AAH cohort in VTI-206
outperformed the control group by just one patient, which could have easily
occurred by chance.


In order to better demonstrate the difference between the efficacy of MARS and ELAD,
the RELIEF, VTI-206 and the ongoing VTI-208 trials' patient baseline characteristics and
results are directly compared in Table 3 (inclusion/exclusion criteria), Table 4 (baseline
patient characteristics) and Table 5 (results).

Although the VTI-206 trial focused predominantly on AILD/AAH and the RELIEF trial
focused on all types of acute-on-chronic liver failure, the causes of chronic liver failure
and precipitating events (highlighted in green in Table 4) were predominantly alcohol-
related in the RELIEF trial. The results compared herein take into account only the AAH
cohort of the VTI-206 trial, thus it can be considered that ELAD is given a slight
advantage over MARS, as RELIEF results are based on ~20% of patients who were
technically "non-AAH".

On many occasions, VTL has postulated that the ELAD system works by reducing the
patients' serum bilirubin - a toxic product of the body's clearance of aged red blood cells.
In one of its presentations Vital Therapies postulated that "Bilirubin Improvement
Correlates with 90-Day Survival with the Use of the ELAD System". The company then
went on to show that bilirubin levels were reduced over the first four days in the ELAD-
treated AILD patient cohort in VTI-206.


The same is true for serum creatinine - another toxic substance that is a crucial
determinant of ALF patients' prognosis. Together, creatinine and bilirubin constitute two
out of the four key parameters of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score - a major
clinical measure of the disease's severity. According to Vital, "these parameters
[bilirubin, creatinine, and sodium] are biomarkers pertinent to our understanding of the
mechanism of action of the ELAD System".


If the above is indeed the case, then the very least, in order to be an efficient liver
dialysis system ELAD must be able to perform basic toxin elimination functions well.
However ELAD fares much worse against MARS in this ability, as shown in Table 5.
Despite the fact that the value of serum creatinine was higher in the ELAD patient group
at baseline, the MARS patient group's reduction was nearly double that of ELAD at Day
4.


The baseline value of serum bilirubin in the ELAD study was never disclosed (the
company insisted on showing percentage change in all the released data instead), thus
a direct comparison was not possible, but net bilirubin reduction in MARS was also
double that of ELAD.

2. Despite several alterations, the VTI-208 trial is not that different from VTI-206
and RELIEF trials


As shown in Table 4, the MELD and Maddrey Scores, both arguably the best and most
commonly used predictors of survival for ALF patients, are very similar in the active arm
patient groups of VTI-206 and VTI-208 (28.4 vs 27.2 for MELD score and 69.3 vs 72.9
for Maddrey score; VTI-206, VTI-208, respectively), as are other baseline characteristics
shown in table 4 (serum creatinine, sodium, etc).


The set-ups and baseline characteristics of both VTI-206 and VTI-208 trials are equally
similar to those of the RELIEF trial. Since MARS appears to be a more efficient liver
dialysis system than ELAD, it can be inferred with a fair degree of confidence that ELAD
does not have a chance of outperforming MARS in the VTI-208 trial, and thus
succeeding in showing a clinically meaningful benefit, given the aforementioned
premises.


3. ELAD's potential is often misleadingly based on previous HepatAssist BAL trial
performance


The HepatAssist BAL device is a cell-based liver dialysis system comprised of 7 billion
porcine hepatocytes housed within a hollow-fiber bioreactor.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3325155-vital-therapies-elad-vtiminus-208-study-chronicle-of-a-failure-foretold?source=all_articles_title 14/19


The 2004 Phase II/III trial of the HepatAssist BAL system is often quoted as theoretical
proof that biological liver dialysis is efficacious. In the study, survival at 30 days was
71% for BAL versus 62% for control (p=0.26). The results were said to be particularly
promising for the FHF/SHF patients, where survival was 59% and 73% for the placebo
and the BAL group, respectively (p=0.117).


However, 55% of all the patients in the study received a liver transplant shortly after
enrolling in the trial, and survival for non-transplanted patients was 50% (20/40) and
38% (14/37), for BAL and control patients respectively (p=0.38 - less significant than the
trend observed in the AILD cohort of VTI-206). When adjusted for a common
denominator, this difference translates to 3 patients in favor of BAL. This advantage is
further offset by the higher severity of disease at baseline in the control group of
patients: 33% of the control patients vs just 29% of the BAL patients had stage IV
hepatic encephalopathy, where short-term mortality is predicted to be over 80%.


Thus, the "trend towards significance" demonstrated in the BAL trial may not be as
positive as often quoted. It is also noteworthy that despite the "positive signals", the
development of HepatAssist appears to have ceased altogether since the
aforementioned trial, which took place in 2004.


4. ELAD's safety profile is extremely poor


ELAD's benefits appear to be even more questionable in light of the serious levels of
adverse events ((AEs)) associated with it. The overall incidence of the majority of
common AEs in ELAD patient groups was nearly three-fold that of the control groups
(fig. 3). The levels of hyperglycemia were 10 times higher in the ELAD group.


A total of 67 serious AEs (SAEs) were also reported by 35 patients in VTI-206, of
which 6 were reported as possibly related to ELAD, including hematemesis (vomiting
blood), kidney failure, bleeding, sepsis, and intravascular hemolysis.

It may be argued that all of the observed side effects are commonly associated with
dialysis and were higher in the ELAD group due to the fact that control patients were not
receiving dialysis at all. This theory may be refuted by looking at the incidence of
adverse events observed in the Phase II/III study of HepatAssist BAL (fig. 4), whose
setup and patient demographics were similar to that of VTI-206, where the control
groups of patients received current standard of care. In this study, the AEs were found
to be balanced across the control and BAL groups in both incidence and severity. No
serious AEs were documented.


In the case that Vital submits a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA, the agency is
highly likely to question the disproportionate incidence of AEs caused by ELAD.
Furthermore, in light of the severity of AEs observed, the possibility that some deaths
are possibly related to the treatment cannot be ruled out.

5. Diagnosis and standard of care for liver disease are extremely heterogeneous
across treatment centers. VTI-208 is being run across more centers than ever
before.


Vital has nearly doubled the number of clinical centers where the study is being run (26
in VTI-206 vs 40 in VTI-208); a number of the centers are also located overseas in
Australia and United Kingdom. This is necessitated by a larger number of patients
enrolled in the trial; however, the multi-center set-up is likely to exacerbate the already
challenging problem of heterogeneity in patient diagnosis and treatment.


Many alcohol-related liver disorders have overlapping characteristics and, due to the
fact that ALF patients are very sick, they may present with a plethora of additional
ailments which are difficult to compartmentalize and balance between arms in a clinical
setting.


In addition to this, individual centers will have their own standard of care for ALF
patients, which may differ significantly between centers. This heterogeneity makes it
difficult to strictly select the patients that Vital believes could benefit the most from ELAD
and bears significant added risk to predicting the outcome of the trial based on previous
results.


Conclusion


Clinical trials so far have shown that the benefits of the ELAD system being developed
by Vital Therapies are purely hypothetical, as this live human cell line dialysis therapy
repeatedly failed to show a survival benefit and has proven to be inferior to a standard
non-biological system across most endpoint parameters.


Moreover, the benefits which the device has demonstrated in previous trials were
exaggerated and are much smaller than the figures commonly presented to VTL's
investors. In addition, the adverse events associated with the ELAD therapy are
dangerously numerous and serious. This report has presented proof that the Phase 3
VTI-208 trial is extremely likely to fail.

Upon the likely failure of the VTI-208 study, the future of ELAD in liver failure treatment
should be finally (and a bit too late) doomed. Accordingly, Vital's stock price should drop
considerably since further studying ELAD in other ALF sub-populations will bare an
even greater failure risk.
