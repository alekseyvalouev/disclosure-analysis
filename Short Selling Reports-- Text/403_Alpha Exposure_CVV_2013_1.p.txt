CVD Equipment's Business Is Failing: Don't Fall For The Graphene
Hype
Aug. 29, 2013 8:25 AM ET155 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


We believe CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ:CVV) is a compelling short and faces
an imminent and substantial collapse. Long on promises and short on delivery, CVD's
share price has been supported by unsubstantiated graphene hype and large (and now
completed) one-time orders for a failed thin film solar application. The promise of
graphene developments by CVD is a mirage and years away. Not only is it too far in the
future for CVD to benefit, but other more substantial companies are competing in the
space. Furthermore, now that CVD has delivered its large solar orders, current orders and
backlog have fallen to dangerously low levels. At $14.65/share, we believe CVD is a
compelling short and believe true underlying value is only $5 per share based on its
historic earnings, which is a generous valuation for a company that has since turned
unprofitable and is now shrinking.


Overview of CVD Equipment


CVD Equipment Corporation (CVD or "the Company"), per its own website, designs,
develops and manufactures customized equipment and process solutions used to develop
and manufacture solar, nano and advanced electronic components, materials and
coatings for research and industrial applications. While it sounds complex and
sophisticated, CVD basically acts as an outsourced manufacturing company for R&D
departments. Clients are typically universities and government and industrial laboratories
that order research and testing equipment that is manufactured by CVD. These clients can
choose to build this equipment themselves or outsource it to CVD. There is little know-how
that is inherent to CVD's capabilities.


Low Tech Margins


While the equipment that CVD makes is customized, it is not highly specialized. With
gross margins of just 31% in H1 and 36% in 2012, it's apparent that CVD's products are
not very highly value-add. For comparison, KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)
makes equipment for technology companies, such as semiconductors and
nanoelectronics, and supports companies from research and development to final volume
production. KLAC's gross margin and operating margin averages were 55% and 27%
during the last 2 quarters, far surpassing CVD's 31% and negative 9% operating margins.

Insignificant R&D Spending


CVD's low tech margin profile is not surprising if you consider that CVD spends virtually
nothing on R&D. Per the 2012 Annual Report (here), in 2012, CVD spent just $1.33 million
in total R&D, of which $389 thousand was to build internal R&D capabilities. The less than
$400 thousand spent on internal R&D capabilities is not indicative to us of substantial
know-how. The vast majority of the R&D, or $955 thousand worth, was spent on behalf of
customers for customer orders. This further corroborates CVD's outsourced manufacturing
status.


Weak IP Portfolio


Not surprisingly, with so little spent on R&D, CVD does not have a substantial patent
portfolio. CVD's 2012 Annual Report does not publish how many patents CVD owns, but it
is clear that it is not significant. In fact, in Note 6 of the 2012 Annual Report, CVD values
its patent portfolio at just $18 thousand. Furthermore, CVD states it only has $23 thousand
in Intellectual Property value.


This is indicative of weak IP and a minimal patent portfolio.


Graphene - Don't Believe The Hype

With miniscule resources and capabilities, the notion that CVV is on the cutting edge of
graphene technology development is laughable.


First, what is graphene? It is a crystalline form of carbon (Wikipedia entry here) that is
interesting because it is two-dimensional and has high conductivity, as explained here. It
has exciting potential in nanotechnologies. But it is years away from any real-life
application.


What does this have to do with CVD?


The hype around graphene and CVD started with a Bloomberg article in 2011 that
mentioned CVD as a company that sells 4-square-inch wafers of graphene. The article
can be found here. Notice that the article doesn't state that CVD is developing graphene
applications, or that CVD possesses any know-how. The article simply states that CVD
sells wafers of graphene so that others can develop it. We don't believe that CVD has
developed any capabilities with regard to graphene development. It certainly has not
resulted in any orders that have contributed to backlog.


In addition, a recent WSJ article (here) states that large multi-billion dollar companies like
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and BASF (OTCQX:BASFY) are
investing heavy resources into developing graphene applications and filing thousands of
patents all related to graphene. The notion that CVD can compete with companies like
these is preposterous. As we noted above, CVD spends roughly a million dollars a year in
total R&D for all of its applications, and has no significant intellectual property to speak of.


Business Has Fallen Off a Cliff


In the meantime, CVD investors blindly believe the hype on graphene and ignore the
alarming deterioration in the base business. In late 2010 and early 2011, CVD enjoyed
some large one-time orders that boosted backlog from $2 million dollars at the start of
2010 to over $22 million by the middle of 2011. This fooled investors into thinking CVD
was growing rapidly.


However, those large orders were tied to a thin film solar customer and have since dried
up. Thin film solar is a dying technology, and CVD has said that orders are unlikely to be
repeated from this customer. Since mid-2011, orders have declined year over year for 8
straight quarters and averaged under 0.7x Book-to-Bill.

Lies Behind The Deterioration In Orders


CVD blames the slow orders on the disruption from their move into a larger facility, but we
believe this is incorrect. First, CVD has been saying for over a year that quotation activity
remains strong and orders are imminent. If quotation levels remain so high, then why are
orders declining?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1663812-cvd-equipments-business-is-failing-dont-fall-for-the-graphene-hype 5/61


Second, if a manufacturing company is moving into a new facility that has double the
previous capacity, the company's main priority should be to fill backlog so that the new
facility's utilization is maximized as quickly as possible. Otherwise, margins will suffer.
Filling backlog for CVD is even more important since according to its 2012 Annual Report,
"the timing for completion of the backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be
as long as two years." If orders take up to 2 years to fulfill, then CVD should have been
aggressively filling its backlog as it was opening the facility, not depleting its backlog.


To us, CVD's promises don't ring true.


Most alarmingly, while CVV has promised new orders over and over again, their backlog
has fallen to desperate levels. Orders in the last quarter were just $2.6 million for a book
to bill of 0.5x, and CVD finished the quarter with just $5.5 million in backlog, or less than 2
quarter of sales. In the meantime, CVD is barely breakeven and cash flow from operations
has been negative for 3 straight quarters. So far this year CVD has earned $434 thousand
or $0.07 per share in net income, which includes a one-time $887 thousand gain from a
sale of property that should probably be excluded from earnings because it will not be
repeated. Excluding the one-time gain, CVD would have lost money. We believe more
losses are on the way.

Comments (155)


At $14.65 per share, we believe fair value of CVD is $5 per share or far less than half the
current share price. Over the past 6 years, which includes the large one-time solar orders,
CVV earned a total of $6.1 million. That's just over $1 million per year, or just under $0.20
per share in annual EPS. Being generous and putting a 20x multiple on that gets us to $4
per share. Adding the $1 per share of net cash gets us to our target price of $5 per share.
Don't fall into the trap of believing false promises. Value CVD on its fundamentals and you
will profit from your short position.

I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

You obviously did not read the last press release: “In addition we also received orders for two large Graphene
systems – one for a square 300mm substrate and the other for a round 200mm substrate.


“In our September 7, 2010 press release we announced receiving an order in excess of $2.5 million from a large
aviation component supplier for CVD coating systems. In our May 7, 2012 press release we announced receiving a
multi-million dollar design only order from a major aviation components manufacturer to design a custom CVD system
solution for their next generation of composite products. I am happy to announce we just received an initial $1 million
follow-on order to commence manufacturing on some portions of a much larger system and we anticipate that
additional multi-million dollar portions will be awarded in the near term.


“Earlier this year, we delivered a next generation production CVD system to a major medical manufacturer for
coatings on implants. The unit is operational and meeting the enhanced system production requirements. We
anticipate follow on multiple production system orders later this year.

stated certain of these articles contain "significant factual errors."


Mr. Rosenbaum observed that “although some of the false or misleading statements appearing in these
articles may have been unintentional, I believe that some authors may be purposefully attempting to create a
negative picture after taking a short position.”


He further stated that, “although our Company respects the rights of all to voice opinions openly, it is
scandalous and injurious to the public as well as to our Company when information that is not factual is
presented or information is presented in such a way as to intentionally attempt to create a misconception.” Mr.
Rosenbaum cautioned investors to view with a degree of skepticism all articles (both positive and negative),
particularly those by authors who fail to reveal their identity or affiliation.


Mr. Rosenbaum concluded that, “CVD’s Management continues to believe that it is in the best interests of our
shareholders that we remain focused on our business rather than debating or responding to internet bloggers.
However, due to the magnitude of inquiries to our investor relations and blogs containing baseless attacks
upon our integrity, we felt it important that we hereby reaffirm and stand by the accuracy of all information
which has been released by CVD.”

On revenue of approximately $4,848,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 which surpassed by
40.5% the revenue achieved in the previous quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax income of $1,005,000
and net income of approximately $874,000 or $0.14 per share both basic and diluted compared to a pre-tax
loss of ($903,000) and a net loss of ($440,000) or a ($0.07) loss per basic and diluted share for the quarter
ended March 31, 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2013 the Company achieved revenue of
$8,298,000 with net income of approximately $434,000 or $.07 per share basic and diluted. In April, the
Company sold its former headquarters which resulted in a gain of approximately $887,000.


With the sale of its former headquarters having been completed early in the 2nd quarter and the transition into
its new and significantly larger facility substantially completed, CVD has returned to profitability in Q2. The
Company continues to maintain a strong cash position and a healthy working capital. The backlog as of June
30, 2013 was approximately $5,516,000. However, as stated in the Company’s May 15, 2013 press release,
“during this transition period order acceptance levels were reduced to maintain a more manageable backlog
level and CVD is poised for growth in revenue and order backlog during the 2nd half of 2013”. Order backlog
usually is a reasonable management tool to indicate future revenues and profits. However it does not provide
an assurance of future achievement of revenues or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible.
Backlog from quarter to quarter can vary based on the timing of order placements and shipments.

It was down because of the move! You cant fulfill and take on orders when you have no equipment set up.
The breakdown and relocation took longer as expected, as the CEO spelled out.


Why would they invest and upgrade their facilities if sales were slowing? Why not just pocket the money
instead and run it into the ground like a penny scam?

The decreasing backlog/revenue is all very easy to understand. They were growing at almost 100% year over
year before the move, which is why they needed more working space. The CEO has explained this and it

when nothing could be further form the truth. "High quotation levels" means there is a lot of work to quote on
now that they are up and running again.


The sector is going to explode in the years ahead. Do your own DD and dont listen to the shorts whom have a
vested interest in getting people to sell to them before the masses figure it out how big graphene, carbon
Nanotubes, etc is going to become. This is why the short article was timed PERFECTLY when CVV started
breaking out and hitting new high. A 10% outstanding short is a lofty amount for a high potential LOW FLOAT
stock like this. They needed sellers to cover into, because the company is extremely clean/responsible and
does not dilute often (less than 1,500,000 shares issued in the past 6+ years)


Why did they need so much extra capacity if things were looking bleak for their future?!?!? Sales were at
RECORD LEVELS right before the move. Read and comprehend why the numbers were lower. Smart money
will be taking advantage of this temporary dip.


Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 vs. Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2012


Revenue


In March 2012, we purchased a 120,000 square foot facility located in Central Islip, New York (the “Property”)
through the Town of Islip Industrial Development Agency, (the “Islip IDA”) and subsequently added another
10,000 square feet to the facility. The building replaced our two Ronkonkoma facilities which totaled 63,275
square feet and were not adequate to meet our anticipated future production requirements.


During the six months ended June 30, 2013, and to a lesser extent in the three months ended June 30, 2013,
the results of operations were significantly impacted by this transaction due to the substantial amount of time
and effort dedicated to renovating and moving into our new facility which proved to be disruptive to our
continuing operations. We completed the relocation to our substantially larger facility in the closing days of
March 2013.


Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was approximately $4,848,000 compared to
approximately $7,094,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2012, a decrease of 31.7%. This decrease is
attributable to both the reduction in the amount of new orders accepted while we were transitioning into our
new facility and the reconstructing of equipment during the period. Revenue for the six months ended June
30, 2013 was approximately $8,298,000 compared to approximately $14,249,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2012, a decrease of 41.8%, for the same reasons as articulated for the three months ended June
30, 2013.

Now read this. This is from right before the move began.


Numbers were at RECORD levels, hence needing to increase their capacity when they did, which temporarily
hurt the numbers.


I find it funny that the shorts want us to think they should be able to maintain their growth during a multi
location consolidation/relocation. How is that possible?!

The key is that "quotation levels" have remained high, which says that the work is waiting for them. They just
need to quote on it and i bet they are be able to beat their old prices now that they are becoming more
efficient, which will equate too winning more large contracts than in the past.


CVD Announces Record First-Half Revenue


RONKONKOMA, N.Y., (Business Wire) – August 14, 2012 - (NASDAQ: CVV – News) CVD Equipment
Corporation, a leading provider of custom chemical vapor deposition systems, today announced that it had
achieved record first-half revenue of $14,249,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2012, representing a
3.9% increase over the $13,713,000 of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2011.


Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2012 was $7,094,000 compared to $7,155,000 in the three
months ended June 30, 2011, a 3.9% decrease despite the significant effort required for planning and
preparing the Company’s relocation to new headquarters scheduled to occur by October 15, 2012.


Gross margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 increased by 2.7% and 2.0% respectively
compared to the same periods in 2011.


Pre-tax income (excluding the sale of a building) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 increased
by 1.0% and 8.4% respectively compared to the same periods in 2011.


Having determined that larger quarters were required to facilitate the growth of CVD, First Nano and the
Application Laboratory, the Company is replacing its two Long Island buildings with a new building (also on
Long Island) which will double the facility size. The building that housed CVD’s Application Laboratory has
been sold, resulting in a capital loss of approximately $694,000 or $0.12 per share pre-tax for this quarter.
This loss reduced net earnings per share to $.05 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended June
30, 2012 and to $0.18 per share basic and $0.17 per share diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Sale of the 2nd building currently housing CVD/First Nano is in contract, expected to generate a capital gain,
and scheduled to close no later than October 15, 2012. The Company anticipates the net effect of these two
real estate transactions, when completed, will result in an overall net capital gain.


In addition to the condensed statement of operations in accordance with GAAP, we have included a pro-forma
statement of income from operations excluding the effect of the capital loss on the sale of the building which
housed the Application Laboratory.


Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Starting in Q2 we re-directed some of
our manpower toward the new facility into which we will start moving shortly. We have also started to expand
our sales effort with additional representatives, sales assistants, and direct sales personnel. Although we
have allowed our backlog to decrease to a more manageable level to ease the transition into our new
quarters, based on the continuing high level of interest in our products we are confident that orders will
increase going forward. Space limitations in our current facility hindered our ability to expand production and
add engineering and management personnel. Our new significantly larger facility will enable our growth to
continue both in equipment and materials with no significant increase in operating costs.”

The move, construction, etc took till the end of March 2013, rather than the October 15, 2012 target date.
THAT is why sales were hurt so bad. THAT is the cause of all the pain the past year, which in my opinion
makes it a strong buy as the shorts distort the facts and create a panic buying opportunity.


The market cap ($68,000,000) is way to low vs the potential.Penny stocks with just a small amount of hope
trade for this cap, not legit, responsible (low float), next generation equipment suppliers that deal with
Advanced Carbon (the future of everything). A slight amount of hype (or a broad bull market push) could run
this valuation into the $100's of millions fast and at these market cap levels, thats some big gains. THIS is
why the shorts had to stop its momentum when they did. They need to cover ASAP


It was all timed/planned. Look at the event time line vs the daily and weekly charts. The breakout would have
been strong, technically.


This is why you want to buy this dip, it will shift back to bullish momentum fast, if interest/volume remains
strong. The float is too small to handle this much volume churning and the shorts cant hold it back forever.


Buy the pain, sell the gain. They tried the EXACT same thing on DDD and SSYS the past couple years and
more recently XONE. Check out those charts along with my XONE comments (on Seeking Alpha) when
XONE was near the lows.

The orders are insufficient because of the lengthy move. Look at the orders BEFORE they planned the move.
They were at record levels


They stated long ago they were letting orders drop and not aggressively pursuing new leads because they
needed to consolidate their 2 plants into a larger facility.


Also, customers dont want to place multi million dollar orders and just let it sit until some unknown time, after
they complete their move.


It all makes perfect sense if you followed the company longer than a few days, like i have since $3

So many of these points are factually incorrect. CVV just sold multiple Graphene systems. They are also selling to
several other sectors besides Solar.


Besides their own, CVV is developing IP property through multiple joint ventures for CUSTOMIZED work, using their
experience which most companies wanting to work with Nano Materials do not have, which is why they pay CVV
millions in contracts.


This is a blatant short hit piece. Any dip is a buying op on this factually incorrect BS.


I remember when the shorts were saying many of the the same on the #D print stocks 2 years ago

Not enough to be profitable? They ARE profitability and margins will improve even more, due to combing 2
plants under one roof. None of this custom Nano Equipment and Engineering is cheap, yet there is growing
demand worldwide. CVV is one of the few that has experience in this area. Do the research


You dont even have an understanding of Graphenes growth potential. Companies like IBM, HP, Honeywell,
General Electric, etc hire CVV. CVV does not compete with them as you inaccurately stated.

Its worse because of the move! You cant fulfill orders when you dont have equipment set up to do anything.
HELLO?!


Customers did not want to place orders until they knew the company was ready to fill them, as the CEO
stated. This is why orders are picking fast since the move was completed.


The heavy growth numbers we saw in the past are just a hint of whats coming. Back then Graphene was still
in the early stages. More money is pouring into it now than ever, which is why they needed a bigger facility to
meet future demand

CVD Announces Record First-Half Revenue


RONKONKOMA, N.Y., (Business Wire) – August 14, 2012 - (NASDAQ: CVV – News) CVD Equipment
Corporation, a leading provider of custom chemical vapor deposition systems, today announced that it had
achieved record first-half revenue of $14,249,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2012, representing a
3.9% increase over the $13,713,000 of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2011.


Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2012 was $7,094,000 compared to $7,155,000 in the three
months ended June 30, 2011, a 3.9% decrease despite the significant effort required for planning and
preparing the Company’s relocation to new headquarters scheduled to occur by October 15, 2012.


Gross margins for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 increased by 2.7% and 2.0% respectively
compared to the same periods in 2011.


Pre-tax income (excluding the sale of a building) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 increased
by 1.0% and 8.4% respectively compared to the same periods in 2011.


Having determined that larger quarters were required to facilitate the growth of CVD, First Nano and the
Application Laboratory, the Company is replacing its two Long Island buildings with a new building (also on
Long Island) which will double the facility size. The building that housed CVD’s Application Laboratory has
been sold, resulting in a capital loss of approximately $694,000 or $0.12 per share pre-tax for this quarter.
This loss reduced net earnings per share to $.05 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended June
30, 2012 and to $0.18 per share basic and $0.17 per share diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Sale of the 2nd building currently housing CVD/First Nano is in contract, expected to generate a capital gain,
and scheduled to close no later than October 15, 2012. The Company anticipates the net effect of these two
real estate transactions, when completed, will result in an overall net capital gain.


In addition to the condensed statement of operations in accordance with GAAP, we have included a pro-forma
statement of income from operations excluding the effect of the capital loss on the sale of the building which
housed the Application Laboratory.


Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Starting in Q2 we re-directed some of
our manpower toward the new facility into which we will start moving shortly. We have also started to expand
our sales effort with additional representatives, sales assistants, and direct sales personnel. Although we

Honestly, don't know the business that well. But I side with Exposure. A company is "allowing our backlog to
decrease" because of a move is a GIANT red flag. No one does this while at the same time claiming they are
expanding sales effort. It is not that hard to manage a relocation and customers are not very understanding
when you explain to them "we want you to push off orders because we're moving". In some industries, they
would smile and let you know not to bother.

InvestorWisdom
You also misunderstand their margins. They had multiple production locations before, which was seriously hurting
margins.


This is the reason why they bought a new property and moved all of their employes and equipment into one
streamlined plant.


From the 8/14 news


With the sale of its former headquarters having been completed early in the 2nd quarter and the transition into its new
and significantly larger facility substantially completed, CVD has returned to profitability in Q2. The Company
continues to maintain a strong cash position and a healthy working capital. The backlog as of June 30, 2013 was
approximately $5,516,000. However, as stated in the Company’s May 15, 2013 press release, “during this transition
period order acceptance levels were reduced to maintain a more manageable backlog level and CVD is poised for
growth in revenue and order backlog during the 2nd half of 2013”. Order backlog usually is a reasonable management
tool to indicate future revenues and profits. However it does not provide an assurance of future achievement of
revenues or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible. Backlog from quarter to quarter can vary based on
the timing of order placements and shipments.


Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated:


“Issues associated with moving into our expanded facility are now behind us. As painful as it has been for everyone
involved, this was a required step to enable future growth opportunities. Our employees as well as the customers,
suppliers, and shareholders that have visited our new facility see our potential. We are convinced that our new 2X
larger facility is a turning point for the Company that will enable us to generate higher sustainable growth rates.


“I will now try to give some insight into our potential future and thoughts behind the relocation.


“In our September 7, 2010 press release we announced receiving an order in excess of $2.5 million from a large
aviation component supplier for CVD coating systems. In our May 7, 2012 press release we announced receiving a
multi-million dollar design only order from a major aviation components manufacturer to design a custom CVD system
solution for their next generation of composite products. I am happy to announce we just received an initial $1 million
follow-on order to commence manufacturing on some portions of a much larger system and we anticipate that
additional multi-million dollar portions will be awarded in the near term.

“In addition we also received orders for two large Graphene systems – one for a square 300mm substrate and the
other for a round 200mm substrate. Our application laboratory is playing an important part in our ability to deliver next
generation equipment that meets the evolving needs of this growing material area. Our expanded application
laboratory now enables us to work with an increasing selected customer base in the fields of Nanotubes, Nanowires,
Graphene, TCO coatings and other deposition requirements. If you have not looked recently at our Website where our
conference presentations are published, I urge you to do so. You will be able to see some of the directions we are
headed into with the intent of advancing these nano materials into large volume, value added products.


“Our First Nano research equipment and CVD custom production solution products will now benefit from our ability to
meet volume requirements, provide custom CVD solutions with faster deliveries and do this for a larger customer
base.


“Our quotation level continues to grow each year and we anticipate that 2013 will demonstrate we have a very bright
future. Our ability to work with more customers to solve their process issues by defining, designing and manufacturing
equipment and material needed to meet their production needs adds sustainable low risk growth.”

At the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 right before the 8 quarter "transition period" of the move where

Million dollars of stock. During the same period other insiders and directors sold over a million dollars worth of

We are entering the Carbon Age (not to be confused with carbon emissions). It will be used everywhere and
will be a trillion+ dollar industry without a doubt. I have done the research and the fact that more money is
being invested in carbon allotrope related research than any other advanced/future material says it all.
Carbon in its many forms, is also extremely abundant.


Also, keep in mind that trillion+ dollar industries (and companies) will be more and more common in the future
due to inflationary measures, modernizing populations and the demand they will influence, etc, etc. Im sure
you've noticed the world "trillion" becoming more and more popular these days.


Read this.....


A New Trillion Dollar Industry was born when Bessemer discovered a counter-intuitive process that by forcing
air through molten iron, he could in fact make the molten iron hotter which in turn could be more easily
converted into steel. Termed the Bessemer process it was patented in 1855 and shortly thereafter licensed to
aspiring steel manufacturers, including Andrew Carnegie founder of Carnegie Steel and Charles Schwab
founder of Bethlehem Steel. Within the next decade steel prices fell almost 90% to around the same price of
wrought iron. Even today, modern steel is made from the same process Bessemer used. His patented
process lead to the development of skyscrapers, railroads... the Golden Gate Bridge.


Today we are again presented with the same situation of needing materials stronger, lighter and cheaper.
Ironically we identified the evolution of the solution with the advent of steel, from iron, to iron combined with
carbon, now crabon graphene. Just like the steel dilemma, carbon graphene solves the problem of stronger
and lighter.


After nine years of scientific examination of graphene’s properties, market analysts have deemed graphene
an industrially disruptive technology or force, capable of causing most industries to re-think and re-engineer
the way they produce products. That disruptive force is causing the development of an infinite array of new
processes and products innovations that range from nanoscale medical devices that target individual cancer
cells with chemicals to the re-engineering of aircraft components. For example, researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a graphene invention that desalinates seawater and

" That disruptive force is causing the development of an infinite array of new processes and products
innovations that range from nanoscale medical devices that target individual cancer cells with chemicals to
the re-engineering of aircraft components."


hmmm, who keeps landing multi million dollar expansion orders from a aviation component supplier (and a
recent "major" medical manufacturer) ? This aviation company just placed another $1,000,000 order in
August and the CEO clams that more are coming in the "near term". Should i believe that this company is
doomed for failure, or are they positioning to grow with this relatively new mega industry?


CVV only needs a small slice to see massive growth. There is going to be room for many companies to profit.
Read close......


“I will now try to give some insight into our potential future and thoughts behind the relocation.


“In our September 7, 2010 press release we announced receiving an order in excess of $2.5 million from a
large aviation component supplier for CVD coating systems. In our May 7, 2012 press release we announced
receiving a multi-million dollar design only order from a major aviation components manufacturer to design a
custom CVD system solution for their next generation of composite products. I am happy to announce we just
received an initial $1 million follow-on order to commence manufacturing on some portions of a much larger
system and we anticipate that additional multi-million dollar portions will be awarded in the near term.


“Earlier this year, we delivered a next generation production CVD system to a major medical manufacturer for
coatings on implants. The unit is operational and meeting the enhanced system production requirements. We
anticipate follow on multiple production system orders later this year.


“In addition we also received orders for two large Graphene systems – one for a square 300mm substrate
and the other for a round 200mm substrate. Our application laboratory is playing an important part in our
ability to deliver next generation equipment that meets the evolving needs of this growing material area. Our
expanded application laboratory now enables us to work with an increasing selected customer base in the
fields of Nanotubes, Nanowires, Graphene, TCO coatings and other deposition requirements. If you have not
looked recently at our Website where our conference presentations are published, I urge you to do so. You
will be able to see some of the directions we are headed into with the intent of advancing these nano
materials into large volume, value added products.


“Our First Nano research equipment and CVD custom production solution products will now benefit from our
ability to meet volume requirements, provide custom CVD solutions with faster deliveries and do this for a
larger customer base.

The catalytic vapor phase deposition of carbon was reported in 1952[77] and 1959,[78] but it was not until 1993[79]
that carbon nanotubes were formed by this process. In 2007, researchers at the University of Cincinnati (UC)
developed a process to grow aligned carbon nanotube arrays of 18 mm length on a FirstNano ET3000 carbon
nanotube growth system.[80]


During CVD, a substrate is prepared with a layer of metal catalyst particles, most commonly nickel, cobalt,[81] iron, or
a combination.[82] The metal nanoparticles can also be produced by other ways, including reduction of oxides or
oxides solid solutions. The diameters of the nanotubes that are to be grown are related to the size of the metal
particles. This can be controlled by patterned (or masked) deposition of the metal, annealing, or by plasma etching of
a metal layer. The substrate is heated to approximately 700°C. To initiate the growth of nanotubes, two gases are bled
into the reactor: a process gas (such as ammonia, nitrogen or hydrogen) and a carbon-containing gas (such as
acetylene, ethylene, ethanol or methane). Nanotubes grow at the sites of the metal catalyst; the carbon-containing
gas is broken apart at the surface of the catalyst particle, and the carbon is transported to the edges of the particle,
where it forms the nanotubes. This mechanism is still being studied.[83] The catalyst particles can stay at the tips of
the growing nanotube during the growth process, or remain at the nanotube base, depending on the adhesion
between the catalyst particle and the substrate.[84] Thermal catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon has become an
active area of research and can be a promising route for the bulk production of CNTs. Fluidised bed reactor is the
most widely used reactor for CNT preparation. Scale-up of the reactor is the major challenge.[85][86]


CVD is a common method for the commercial production of carbon nanotubes. For this purpose, the metal
nanoparticles are mixed with a catalyst support such as MgO or Al2O3 to increase the surface area for higher yield of
the catalytic reaction of the carbon feedstock with the metal particles. One issue in this synthesis route is the removal
of the catalyst support via an acid treatment, which sometimes could destroy the original structure of the carbon
nanotubes. However, alternative catalyst supports that are soluble in water have proven effective for nanotube
growth.[87]


If a plasma is generated by the application of a strong electric field during the growth process (plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition), then the nanotube growth will follow the direction of the electric field.[88] By adjusting the
geometry of the reactor it is possible to synthesize vertically aligned carbon nanotubes[89] (i.e., perpendicular to the
substrate), a morphology that has been of interest to researchers interested in the electron emission from nanotubes.
Without the plasma, the resulting nanotubes are often randomly oriented. Under certain reaction conditions, even in
the absence of a plasma, closely spaced nanotubes will maintain a vertical growth direction resulting in a dense array
of tubes resembling a carpet or forest.


Of the various means for nanotube synthesis, CVD shows the most promise for industrial-scale deposition, because
of its price/unit ratio, and because CVD is capable of growing nanotubes directly on a desired substrate, whereas the
nanotubes must be collected in the other growth techniques. The growth sites are controllable by careful deposition of
the catalyst[90]. In 2007, a team from Meijo University demonstrated a high-efficiency CVD technique for growing
carbon nanotubes from camphor.[91] Researchers at Rice University, until recently led by the late Richard Smalley,
have concentrated upon finding methods to produce large, pure amounts of particular types of nanotubes. Their
approach grows long fibers from many small seeds cut from a single nanotube; all of the resulting fibers were found to
be of the same diameter as the original nanotube and are expected to be of the same type as the original nanotube.

It's not all about fundamentals. It's about the future. Fundamentals come into play with mature companies. You're
treading on thin ice with a float of 4.84M shares. A hedge fund could run this stock to 50. I've seen it happen with
ANTP and other low float stocks. Nanotech ranks up there with 3D printing as the wave of the future.


My suggestion is to cover while you can. The binderless lithium battery joint venture is a big deal. Keep in mind Tesla
electric cars run on lithium batteries and what's holding them back is the range of their cars. You solve the lithium
battery life, you solve the one limiting factor with electric vehicles which is keeping customers from buying them. Elon
Musk is on the prowl for novel battery technologies.

"While speaking at the Cleantech Forum in San Francisco, CA last week, Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla,
said he's willing to bet against batteries to be the technology that finally delivers the breakthrough that electric-drive
vehicles need to become mainstream. Earth2Tech quotes Musk saying:

What threats? Ive only read challenges to your claims, which you wont answer.


Like why wont you acknowledge that CVV is not a competitor to Apple and the other companies you listed?
This is one example of your blatant distortions. A company like Apple does not make their own Chemical
Vapor Deposition equipment, etc, they make phones and tablets which might require this equipment for
production. How does CVV's products and services compete with an iPhone?


Apple (through their manufacturers) buys from suppliers that specialize in various equipment and in the case
of these next generation materials, there are not many companies to turn to for CUSTOM equipment and
Engineering, ready to meet future demand. This is CVV's niche.


Most of these companies are patenting the specific USE of Graphene (new touch screens, electrode designs,
pebble bed reactors, etc), not the machinery used to apply and work with these materials, which is what CVV
does. For example, Apple hires Foxconn to do manufacturing and Foxconn is a CVV customer.


No one can patent these CUSTOM CVD systems, along with the raw commodities that CVV provides. Your
whole claim is a blatant misstatement of the facts, but then again, you are short and dont care about these
facts. Your goal is to manipulate the sentiment and scare people out, right?

Author’s reply »  At the end of 2010, this was a $7 stock. At the end of 2011 it was a $12 stock. Since then,
revenues are down, profits down, orders down, backlog down. Yet the stock is flat. Revenues this year are
likely to be around where they were in 2010 (H1 2013 revenues are $8.3mm - which is $16.6mm) yet today is
the company is shrinking and at the end of 2010 it was growing. The stock should be < $7 - my $5 price target
seems reasonable.

graphene is ever commercialized, it will be done using machines made for industrial production quantities and
not with the lab equipment that CVV makes. There is little reason to believe (and no evidence to support) a

First: I'm long CVV... Just to get that out of the way. Compare them with AAPL, Samsung and others? This company
operates far earlier in the production process.  
1. Why build a new facillity if they don't expect the growth to support it?  
2. They held of new orders during the course of 2012 because they couldn't keep up with the order pace while
maintaining the high quality standard  
3. The latest JV in battery technology is promissing  
4. Graphene based circuits are 30 x faster  
5. Graphene based batteries held 97% of their quality after 1000ds of recharges  
6. EPS went to a loss of 0.07 in Q1 because of transitions to the new facillity and the under item 2 mentioned reason


Some comments from the CEO: "The primary reason for the reduced gross profit margins during the current periods
was the hiring of additional engineering and production personnel so that they could be trained and more productive
after the move was completed." "the results of operations were significantly impacted by this transaction due to the
substantial amount of time and effort dedicated to renovating and moving into our new facility which proved to be
disruptive to our continuing operations."

Quotation levels are increasing but they could not take on all this work before the move, as the CEO

In the PAST they sold most of their systems primarily for R/D purposes because this sector was small and
relatively new, no one was producing Nano products yet. But NOW that is changing as the largest companies
in the world race to incorporate nano materials into their products.


This says PRODUCTION and this is just the first order of many that they have placed. You dont need this
many systems for R/D.

Your DD cant really be this bad. There was only a small market in the past for PRODUCTION equipment.


Graphene is just coming out of the lab and into the production environment. Of course their PAST sales were
mostly for R/D purposed. HELLO?!


But guess what, many of these companies are use to using CVV equipment and will most likely use the same
equipment when they start producing the products that have been in R/D.


You cant sell for production purposes when there is no market for it yet. This will take place in the years
ahead. This sector is just heating up. Do some real DD on the near and long term growth potential of this
sector.

Forecast Report on Global Market for Graphene 
Published on August 20, 2013 at 8:19 AM 
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "The Global Market for Graphene 2013: Forecasts
from 2010 to 2020" report to their offering.


Presented in magazine format this fully updated to August 2013 report provides and easily readable and
succinct guide to this wonder material. Driven by demand from markets where advanced materials are
required, graphene promises to outstrip all current nanomaterials, especially in electronics and energy
storage. Other markets graphene is impacting include aerospace, automotive, coatings and paints,
communications, sensors, solar, oil, and lubricants.


The exceptional electron and thermal transport, mechanical properties, barrier properties and high specific
surface area of graphene and combinations thereof make it a potentially disruptive technology all these
industries. The European Union is funding a 10 year 1,000 million euro coordination action on graphene.
South Korea is spending $350 million plus on commercialization initiatives and the United Kingdom is
investing over £70 million on various initiatives.


Applications are coming onto the market for polymer composites and EMI shielding coatings. Graphene-
based conducting inks are also finding their way into smart cards and radio-frequency identification tags.
China is expecting to bring graphene products to the market in 2014 in consumer electronics. Many of the
current and potential applications of carbon nanotubes may be taken by graphene, as it displays enhanced
properties but with greater ease of production and handling. In this regard, carbon nanotubes may be viewed
as a stalking horse for commercial applications of graphene.


However, in an interesting development, using carbon nanotubes and graphene in combination shows great
promise, allowing for greater consistency and higher concentrations of these materials in the end products.


Most graphene producers currently produce graphene nanoplatelets and graphene oxide. Within the last year
couple of years graphene producers have increased production capabilities considerably. XG Sciences,
Angstron Materials and Vorbeck have increased, or are planning to increase, their production capacities and
other large materials companies are getting in on the act. Producers are generally small, start-up companies
who have witnessed an explosion in demand for their materials from a variety of industries.


Companies such as Phillips, Nokia, IBM and Samsung are pursuing applications for graphene in electronics
and optics. Near-term demand is for composites and coatings for application in the automotive, plastics,
coatings, construction, metals, batteries, aerospace and energy markets.

coatings, construction, metals, batteries, aerospace and energy markets. "


Composites and coatings are the hot near term growth areas? hmmm, doesn't CVV supply the equipment to
do this, to the same sectors on that lists? Could this be the reason why they wanted to consolidate/expand
their facilities when they did, which caused a temporary drop in sales?


What will the upcoming quarters look like, now that the move is complete and they are ramping up again? Is
this why the shorts are panicking and willing to distort the truth, in an attempt to harm the stock? Its not easy
to cover a 10% short position on a low floater, unless you are buying into panic.


A major squeeze is possible with this stock. The CEO indicated that contract news is coming near term, per
the 8/14 news release. This is why the shorts are freaking out. Sales/contract news is the type of news that
moves markets. Nothing beats SALES! Go read the 8/14 release closely and accumulate into their
manipulation, because it wont last with Graphene gaining market exposure

As the author said: There is no money in graphene yet. Most likely CVD sells several 2"x2" graphene coated
copper foils every month for a few hundred dollars. It is a drop in the basket. NOTE: they never reported
actual numbers for graphene sales. Very likely it is so small that they do not want to reveal it.

I totally agree, but I think he has a point. Also stated by 4ron in comments beneath this article...


http://seekingalpha.co...


There is an absolute risk in back log orders. I don't know why anyone would build a facillity twice the size and
with changes that make give them the possibility to produce even more specialized products if they don't
expect back logs to improve significantly. Besides that, they are combinig two of their companies in one
facillity. That should increase net margins?

Very irresponsible! The first fact I checked showed how you play fast and loose with the truth. If you just search on the
company name you get a list of 50 patents! This is a travesty!

Did you actually check the list you posted? A patent must have the Assignee stated as "CVD Equipment
Corporation".  
As an example, "CVD, Incorporated (Woburn, MA) "is not "CVD Equipment Corporation (Ronkonkoma, NY)" 
Most of the patents belong to different corporations and have nothing to do with CVD Equipment Corporation,
NASDAQ:CVV. May be it is Friday night and you have posted it after a beer or two :-) 
Now get sober and check it one more time. Try to find at least one patent about graphene. Good luck!

CVV does not compete directly with these Graphene patents. CVV makes the CUSTOM systems that other
companies purchase so they can build the product that utilize their patents.


You need special equipment to incorporate Nano materials and most products require a CUSTOM system
design for their specific application. Just like you see in the semi conductor industry.


Seems like too many people have no clue what this company actually does, including the author of this article
who is ignorantly assuming that they compete with Apple, etc. lol


CVD Equipment Corporation designs, develops and manufactures customized equipment and process
solutions used to develop and manufacture solar, nano and advanced electronic components, materials and
coatings for research and industrial applications.


We offer customized chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other equipment, which is used by
customers to research, design and manufacture semiconductors, solar cells, smart glass, carbon nanotubes,
nanowires, light emitting diodes (LEDs), micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and industrial coatings as

I proved you wrong on this. Do you even read the DD i have provided? I hope people see through the games.


They are currently setting up multi million dollar production systems for that Aerospace supplier that i
provided info on. That is one example. The website has plenty more.


Here is a repost for you.....


Your DD cant really be this bad. There was only a small market in the past for PRODUCTION equipment.


Graphene is just coming out of the lab and into the production environment. Of course their PAST sales were
mostly for R/D purposed. HELLO?!


But guess what, many of these companies are use to using CVV equipment and will most likely use the same
equipment when they start producing the products that have been in R/D.


You cant sell for production purposes when there is no market for it yet. This will take place in the years
ahead. This sector is just heating up. Do some real DD on the near and long term growth potential of this
sector.

About Stainless Design Concepts (SDC)


Download Corporate Profile Brochure pdf


In December of 1998 CVD Equipment Corporation, AMEX (CVV) purchased all assets of Stainless Design
Corp., both tangible and intangible, including all of the intellectual property. This new company, STAINLESS
DESIGN CONCEPTS (SDC), now operates as a division of CVD Equipment Corporation. While CVD is a
manufacturer of chemical vapor deposition and other custom/research equipment for the semiconductor
industry, SDC made its’ mark as a technology driven manufacturer of Ultra High Purity (UHP ) gas and
chemical delivery systems for state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication processes. SDC operates out of a
25,000 ft2 facility fitted with over 4,000 ft2 of Class 10 and Class 100 clean room manufacturing and
laboratory space. These areas are tooled with over $1 Million in support and analytical equipment. With a
clear understanding of how instrumental process support equipment has become to next generation
microchip production, SDC offers complete gas and chemical delivery product lines ranging “From the Fab to
the Lab”. SDC is uniquely positioned for growth through global sales to major semiconductor, optoelectronic,
optical fiber, OEM as well as research, laboratory and University.


SDC is headquartered in Saugerties, New York, about two hours north of New York City. SDC has a
reputation for utilizing innovation and technology to produce a complete line of gas and chemical
management systems delivering QUALITY directly to the semiconductor wafer. Spawned from a small field
construction office, SDC has burgeoned into an influential equipment manufacturer with sales in excess of
$160 Million since its’ inception. This one time “field construction office” has evolved into the company’s Field
Operations Department, holding a pulse on technology, trends and opportunities while providing a TURNKEY
capability enjoyed by few in our niche. Customers now recognize SDC’s gas management systems and
application specific chemical systems among the most advanced available. What differentiates SDC from the
competition is its’ intimate understanding of the point-of-use process applications, having designed and built
complex process gas systems for the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturers and End
Users such as: Texas Instruments, Lucent/Agere, Applied Materials, Motorola, Intel, IBM, Lam Research,

clean room orbital weld stations and facilities expansion slots for numerous future stations.


SDC's Field Service Group is well equipped with several additional orbital weld systems of their own. SDC's
expertise and quality control in orbital welding of stainless steel are at the very foundation of the purity,
reliability, and safety achieved in SDC's products. The company’s analytical laboratory performs full
certification of products under both dynamic and static test conditions to verify functionality and meeting Ultra-
High-Purity (UHP) specifications. SDC has implemented a computerized materials resource requirement
planning system to track all aspects of production. SDC has a well-seasoned Quality Management Program
to improve many areas of the company’s business processes including; manufacturing efficiency, on-time
deliveries, supplier and customer partnering. The goal of this program is total customer satisfaction.


The current market for UHP gas and chemical delivery equipment tops $1 Billion, covering products ranging
from manual gas/chemical panels to fully automated gas and chemical management systems. Driven by
newer nanotechnologies and the usual push for smaller geometry’s and more densely populated microchips,
a much higher purity of gases/chemicals is required. No other company we know of offer the proven versatility
of comprehensive manufacturing combined with field knowledge to provide for true TURNKEY gas and
chemical delivery.

CVDGraphene™ Research & Development Services


The most critical part of a typical hi-tech product development cycle is a challenge of scaling-up production
from prototype quantity to commercial volumes on a limited budget and identifying a profit-making production
roadmap.


We provide a "one-stop" solution to help to accelerate and to lower the risk of commercialization of Graphene
enabled products by offering (1) a range of starting materials, (2) additional process customization, (3) scale
up equipment and process research and (4) production tooling scale up of graphene-based products.


The CVD Application Laboratory is a very cost efficient platform for the demonstration and/or optimization of
graphene manufacturing processes without prior capital investments. We provide access state-of-the-art
equipment for prototyping material processes, trial quantity manufacturing capability, access to a team of
equipment developers, process engineers, design engineers, and an in-house manufacturing capabilities, and
highly proficient team of scientists and engineers.


Our research team provides analysis of graphene and other carbon nanomaterials by Raman Spectroscopy,
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron
Microscopy. We perform electrical and optical studies of graphene coatings, the transfer of graphene on
various substrates, and perform contract research services on request.


CVDGraphene™ is grown presently on metals only. However, a majority of customer applications require
conductive Graphene coatings on an insulating substrate. We have the ability to transfer CVDGraphene™
films onto virtually any substrate by removal of the supporting metal with a chemical etching process, thus
making it transportable to virtually any solid and liquid object. This greatly expands the possible
CVDGraphene™ application range. In general, CVDGraphene™ coatings are fully compatible with
semiconductor process equipment but essential adaptation a standard set is required.

It seems the author doesn't realize how much went into building their new facility, which is why it took so long.


They had to relocate full scale clean rooms, expensive/delicate analytic and R/D equipment, production lines,
and countless other stuff. I bet it took a ton of work for floor planning alone.


This was not a simple consolidation of multiple locations. They just did a poor job of relaying this to the

So we all agree that CVD has no graphene related intellectual property and no patent protection. There is
nothing unique, and many companies can make similar equipment.


By the way, in order to make graphene on large scale, roll-to-roll growth MUST be employed. CVD does not
have this technology, so it has no chance to be a player in graphene mass production.

You cannot patent a commodity. Does anybody have aluminum patented? Or do countless companies work
with and make lots of money using it? You can patent the application/use and/or design, but no one can
patent the raw material.


CVV IP property is related to system designs, use, etc. Patents are granted and pending under various
names but CVV has the rights. (Including the insiders names, University partners and their customers who
have granted them use of various IP property)

Most Nano applications require CUSTOM equipment, just like you see with Semiconductor applications.
These companies are not buying a drill press or lathe that can be setup/adjusted on the fly. CVV designs
these systems for the specific customer/application. In fact, these systems are known for creating the longest
carbon nanotubes ever made (along with other scientific breakthroughs) and have a longer history than any
startup company trying to compete. CVD Equipment is the NAME in the industry for various purposes, do
your DD.


Could other companies build some of this equipment if they wanted to? Sure, some of it they can, not all of it
is technical, but who cares? Anybody can make semi conductor equipment and services, but do they?
Anybody can make the equipment that oil and gas companies use, but there are still countless oil/gas
services companies making billions in profits, right? CVV is not late to this party, they have their niches
already carved out and with this low market cap they only need a small slice of this future trillion+ industry to
make investors a lot of money.


You fail to grasp the heart of CVV niche and the reason why IBM, Ford, General Electric, Foxconn (Apples
manufacturer) and countless others are buying through CVV. Just because someone else can make
something, does not mean they will. CVV has been doing this longer than anybody and is known for selling
state of the art equipment to the largest companies in the world.


This market will be so massive, there is room for a dozen more companies like CVV and they can all make
billions as this sector grows, but it wont be easy to enter the market now and compete any time soon. It would
take a decade for a startup to catch up to the 100's (possibly 1000's) of products and services CVV already
provides. Have you actually looked at how many systems/products, analytical equipment, custom software,
commodities and services they sell through their multiple subsidiary websites?


Quote:"By the way, in order to make graphene on large scale, roll-to-roll growth MUST be employed. CVD
does not have this technology, so it has no chance to be a player in graphene mass production."


See, this is the problem i have with you shorts. You are making stuff up without caring if there is evidence that
proves your wrong. You are hoping that the naive will read and believe it without validating the fact. Instead,
you should ASK if they have these systems, instead you claimed they did not, which is 100% false and
misleading.


Not only do they have these Reel to Reel systems, they CUSTOM build them for others and the new facility
was designed with the intent to MASS produce raw materials, on top of building custom
machinery/Engineering. Do better research...


Reel To Reel (Roll to Roll) CVD Process Tool


CVD Equipment’s Reel to Reel (or Roll to Roll) chemical vapor deposition process tools deposit materials on
a continuous roll of flexible metal foils, plastics, and other materials in place of individual substrates. The
technology has been used for superconductor tape production and nanomaterial synthesis and is growing in
popularity for thin film solar deposition. Reel to Reel processing offers high production volumes at a low cost,
depositing quality films with consistent results.


CVD Equipment has successfully developed Reel to Reel systems for many applications. Custom systems
can be engineered to accommodate various tape widths and lengths.

²Graphene Batteries AS, Forskningsveien 1, 0314 Oslo, Norway


Battery and ultracapacitor electrodes are traditionally made with at least one polymeric binder material that
mechanically holds the various, powder like, raw materials together. In addition to increasing the electrode resistance,
the binder is assumed to be at least partially responsible for the performance degradation over time for rechargeable
Lithium batteries.


We present here for the first time, by example of a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based cathode, a novel lithium battery
electrode design manufactured with CVD Equipment Corporation’s proprietary NanoToMacro™ platform technology
that facilitates a binder-free approach. Preliminary tests, done by Graphene Batteries AS, show that between 0.2 and
5C rates this binder less cathode has a similar specific capacity versus charge/discharge rate performance as the
standard cathodes. Results of still ongoing more detailed studies will show if such a novel battery electrode
manufacturing design can actually be used to delay the degradation of lithium batteries charging performance over
increased numbers of charge/discharge cycles. In addition, we will present test results for 2-4 times thicker than
normal (60 µm) thick cathode electrodes, which we expect will allow to significantly increase the volume and/or weight
based energy density of lithium battery design.

CVD Equipment Corporation Receives Multi-Million Dollar 
Aerospace Order


RONKONKOMA, N.Y., (Business Wire) – May 7, 2012 - CVD Equipment Corporation (Nasdaq: CVV) announced
today that it has received a Multi-Million dollar order from a major aerospace components manufacturer to design a
custom Chemical Vapor Deposition System scale up solution for their next generation of composite products.


Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are very pleased that we were selected for
the design of a next generation production system solution which is needed to meet the capacity and yield growth
demands of this aerospace components company. This new design contract will enable us to build on the recent
successful startup of the systems we manufactured under a previous Multi-Million dollar contract with the same
customer. This success is rewarding because it is in line with our vision to accelerate the commercialization of
tomorrow’s technologies and to enable a cost effective and risk managed transition of more and more technologies
from R&D and pilot manufacturing to full scale production.


It is also rewarding to see that the efforts of our personnel and the requirements of our customers enabled CVD to
recently purchase a new 130,000 square foot facility that is 100% larger than the existing facilities we are selling. The
new facility expands our application laboratory, design engineering and manufacturing capability and will enable us to
manage our future anticipated growth in providing R&D, pilot and production custom Chemical Vapor Deposition
systems and material solutions to a broad range of markets. We anticipate full occupancy of the new facility during the
3rd quarter of 2012.”

That PR was from May 2012. The move took the rest of 2012 and into 2013 to complete, WHICH IS WHY THE

capacity and were inefficient with multiple production location. They had no choice but to move, or open another
location, which would be even more inefficient.


Now lets look at the numbers for each year. Sales were growing STRONG before the lengthy relocation.


Revs in 2010 was $16,257,587


Revs in 2011 was $30,993,885 (almost 100% year over year growth)


Revs in 2012 were $22,157,737 (which is still not bad considering that over half the year they were concentrating on
the move. What would the year have looked like if they did not stop taking quotes and completing orders?)


The author of this article is missing several key points. Business is not slowing, this sector is just heating up. The
CEO made it clear LAST YEAR that they would be scaling down their backlog, which was smart because the difficult
move took much longer than expected and could have upset some customers with big money hanging on the line.
They only fulfilled the small scale business that they knew they could complete easily/fast during transition.


The CEO now claims that the end of 2013 will be strong and so will the future. Why am i to doubt his word over the
writer of this article whom has already been proven to have made several false claims about the business?


Does everyone really think this relatively new industry is going to slow down from here on out? Do you really think
they would increase their capacity size if business was slowing and they could not fill it up with work? They grew
almost 100% from 2010 to 1011 and 1012 was on record pace even though they wasted half the year on the move.
Why would they be hiring so many new employees/Engineers right now if they cant keep them busy with work?


Or is it a more likely scenario that the 10% short position in this stock is nervous because it wont be easy to cover
their short, without a panic selloff to buy into? Is this the reason why they are going to desperate measures to distort
the facts? Are they trying to scare all the recent buyers out that haven't done their DD, so they can cover on the way
down before the stock start really breaking out with the increasing market exposure of Graphene and other Carbon

CVD Equipment: More Than Just A Pure Play On Graphene


Having followed the development of graphene over the course of the last year across multiple technology websites,
stock websites and most recently Bloomberg, I strongly believe this one-atom thick material is the future of multiple
facets of differing industries. As Seeking Alpha contributor Marvin Clark highlights in his piece, “A Pure-Play On

Game-Changing Graphene,” New York based CVD Equipment Corp. (CVV) is the best way to play this developing
technology. Not only do I agree with Mr. Clark, but also think there's more to say.


Silicon may be at the heart of our modern economy, and it may well be that graphene will not begin to take any sort of
sizeable market share for a decade if not more, so why invest in a company like CVV? Well, for two reasons:


One, CVV’s graphene chips are backlogged beyond anything the company expected. Two, I believe the stock is
extremely undervalued, in spite of its compelling run-up over one- and three-year periods. Extremely positive
company news and more specifically news about graphene has been overshadowed by macro news leading to large,
unjustified sell-offs of this fast-growing micro cap.


As Mr. Clark highlighted in his piece from CVV’s most recent press release,


“Backlog as of June 30, 2011 was $22,208,000. This record backlog is an increase of 376.2% from the backlog of
$4,664,000, reported for June 30, 2010. In addition, the backlog has increased 123.3% from the backlog total of
$9,944,000 that we reported for December 31, 2010. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we received
approximately $24,700,000 in new orders. Timing for completion of the backlog varies depending on the product mix
and can be as long as two years.”


There is simply an enormous demand for a product with extremely limited supply. Though large companies and the
various branches of government are experimenting with the new metal, they need to purchase product from someone
and today there are not nearly enough companies to fill this demand. So even in this "pre-development" stage of this
emerging technology, CVV has the backlog, demand, and demonstrated a hold on a niche that is heavily under
supplied. Aside from the growing number of research universities and research companies (Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, University of Illinois, IBM, DARPA) who need massive amounts of graphene to experiment with, solar
companies use large amounts of graphene to coat their panels. Thus, CVV has customers who have already
integrated its product into theirs, as well as a growing list of companies adding supply for new products. Finally, on
September 7th, CVV announced a doubling of capacity at its Long Island manufacturing plant in effort to catch up with
and continue to expand to meet demand.


CVD Equipment is up 446% since 2009 and 135.42% YTD, but the run is far from over for this stock. Even with the
stock up 48% over the last three months, large dramatic swings negative when the broader market is down allow
entry points for any investor looking to buy and hold, as well continue to add during heavy dips. These huge run ups
and then short period retreats allow for entries, profit taking, and adding to overall position. The percentages may
seem huge, but the future of this technology cannot be underestimated. Engadget has the following articles on
graphene and its expanding list of industry uses. 
CVD Equipment news goes unnoticed in the face of the overall market turmoil though it’s future and its product’s
future is extremely bright. Trading at 44.25 times future earnings, the company is historically at the lower end of its
P/E ratio (12x-125x). Finally, the news surrounding CVD Equipment has been nothing but positive, as well the news
surrounding its main product, graphene (self-cooling, oil well exploration, and super conductivity). Mr. Clark’s piece
was spot on, the future of this product and this company is the type of technological change that will outperform
macro currents for a very long time. I urge any investor to do their due diligence on the company, the product, and the
news surrounding both.

That has been answered many times (see above). You dont like the answer, but it makes more sense than
claiming the company is doomed to fail.


Revenues were growing at a RECORD PACE right before the relocation started and they just finished the last
part of the move. Its only fair to give them more time, but that is not advantageous for someone that is short,
is it? Shorts need to cover now, BEFORE the company starts showing positive growth indicators, right? This
is why this opinion piece was TIMED right when the stock started gaining some momo and hitting 52 week
highs, am i close?


Its not easy to cover a short this large (10%+) on a low floater, thats for sure. You need to be shaking people
out and buy into the pain.


The 8/14 press release gave some big clues. tic toc

Why wont you admit that you are wrong and there is a GOOD REASON for the drop in business (they had no
equipment set up during a multi location consolidation/relocation)


CVVs sales were at RECORD levels right before the move. Read close, LOOK AT THE DATES...


RONKONKOMA, N.Y., (Business Wire) - May 15, 2012 - (NASDAQ: CVV) – News) CVD Equipment
Corporation, a leading provider of custom chemical vapor deposition systems, today announced revenue for
the quarter ended March 31, 2012 was $7,155,000, a 15.3% increase over the revenue of $6,206,000 earned
for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, and its highest revenue and net income for a quarter ending March 31
in the Company’s history.


..... Shall we read that again?... "....and its highest revenue and net income for a quarter ending March 31 in
the Company’s history.


Doesn't that type of growth not create a good reason for them moving when they did? They maxed their
capacity and had no choice. There was TONS of available business (high quotation levels, per the CEO), but
they could not take it on without more room.


You are consistently leaving out several KEY points, in regard to the companies situation. I hope the readers
are paying attention.

Now read this PR which came out that exact same month (May 2012) and notice the area where it talks about
the move. This is the proof that sales were at RECORD levels, RIGHT BEFORE the move started and
remember that the difficult move took longer than planned (into 2013), hence the lower numbers over that
period. This is not that difficult to figure out when you have all the info available.

The larger facility was for lunch time floor hockey and all the people they just finished hiring are actually just there for
the floor hockey and dodge ball. I actually find this article has a very aggressive negative tone. I'm glad it is nothing
more than an opinion piece. Opinion essays are cute, but I don't let them influence my investing or trading.

Wow, the author spent an awful lot of time defending and responding to comments this week. I've never seen such a
great interest in bashing a 60 million micro cap company. Unless of course, your pumping and dumping, or in your
case dumping and dumping. Hope u made your short money and covered for u and your followers. 30% in a few days
not bad.
