Blue Sky Alternative Investments Limited (ASX: BLA) (“Blue Sky” or the “Company”) is an Australian fund 


manager with a purported $3.9 billion of fee earning assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 2017.  Blue 


Sky also claims to have achieved a 15% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) net of fees since inception. Driven by the 


supposed rapid increase in ‘fee earning’ AUM and fantastic reported performance, Blue Sky’s market capitalization 


has grown exponentially to nearly $1 billion.   





But all is not as it seems.  We believe that Blue Sky is significantly overstating its fee earning AUM by reporting the 


gross value of certain assets as AUM instead of the fair value of the capital invested.  Based on our analysis, we 


estimate that Blue Sky’s real fee earning AUM is at most $1.5 billion, 63% less than Blue Sky’s reported figure.  





We believe Blue Sky compensates for its overstated AUM by charging clients egregious management fees, which 


can reach up to 17% of the capital invested in Blue Sky funds and are charged irrespective of the performance of the 


underlying investment.  Because investors will soon wise up, we view Blue Sky’s fee revenues as inherently 


unsustainable.  In other cases, such as private equity, we present evidence that Blue Sky has overstated its returns on 


many investments (a practice we believe is systematic).  Through the overstatement of AUM and returns, Blue Sky 


inflates its current revenue and profits, driving up its stock price and attracting further capital.   





Blue Sky’s main broker, Morgans, claims that AUM is the key driver of revenues and ultimately the share price of 


the Company.  Blue Sky likes to compare itself to US-listed alternative asset managers; Apollo, KKR and Blackstone 


have an enterprise value which is on average 13% of their fee earning AUM.  If we apply the same ratio to Blue Sky, 


and factor in a corporate governance discount, we estimate that the Company’s shares are worth at most $2.66 per 


share.   





1. Blue Sky Wildly Exaggerates its Reported Fee Earning AUM.  Based on our review and analysis of the assets 
in Blue Sky’s portfolio, we believe that Blue Sky’s reported fee earning AUM does not reflect the true value of 


the asset manager’s fee-earning invested capital. Breaking down AUM by asset class, we estimate that Blue 


Sky’s real fee earning AUM is at most $1.5 billion, and even this estimate is likely far too generous, because it 


gives full credit to Blue Sky’s claims regarding the performance of its unrealized investments. 





a. We Estimate Real Estate AUM is no more than $683.5 million.  Reputable asset managers, including 
KKR and Blackstone, define fee earning AUM as the fair value of invested capital. We believe that the 


Company reports real estate fee earning AUM as the gross value of the assets, including the indebtedness 


on its property developments.  By doing so, we believe Blue Sky vastly overstates its reported fee earning 


AUM.   





According to the Company, real estate related investments comprise 50% of Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM, 


meaning the value of invested capital in such properties should be $1.9 billion.  But based on our review of 


Blue Sky’s real estate portfolio, including residential developments, student accommodations, retirement 


homes, commercial property and other related investments, we believe that Blue Sky is reported the gross 


value of its investments as its AUM.  Once we net off third party debt and JV equity, we estimate that the 


maximum equity attributable to Blue Sky in this segment is just $683.5 million.  In our opinion, Blue Sky 


overstates its real estate AUM by at least 2.9x.

b. We Estimate Agricultural and Resource AUM of $315 million.  Investments in real assets, a term Blue Sky uses to describe 
agricultural and resource investments (“Agricultural and Resource”), reportedly comprise 25% of its fee earning AUM, 


meaning the fair value of Blue Sky’s equity in such assets should be at least $975 million.  This value is purportedly 


underpinned by Blue Sky’s open-ended water fund (“Water Fund”).  When we called the Company to inquire about investing 


in the Water Fund, a sales representative told us it was ‘closed’ and that the AUM was “north of $150 million.”  We have 


identified four additional single asset funds in this segment.  When we break down the maximum amounts invested in these 


assets using the underlying fund documents and Blue Sky’s public disclosures, we estimate that the maximum AUM for 


Blue Sky’s Agricultural and Resource investments is $315 million. 





c. We Estimate Private Equity AUM at most $419 million.  Blue Sky claims that private equity comprises the remaining 
25% of its AUM, meaning the value of its invested capital in this segment should be $975 million.  Blue Sky currently reports 


33 PE investments which it categorizes as either growth or venture capital (“VC”).  Yet a 2017 investment memorandum for 


Blue Sky’s flagship VC Fund (“VC 2017”) reveals that Blue Sky invested only $86 million in 17 businesses, an average of 


just $5 million per business.  If we assume these VC assets appreciate in value at the claimed IRR of 13.9% (and for the 


record, we doubt it), we estimate an AUM of $136.6 million for the VC asset class.  Through additional fund documents and 


Blue Sky’s public disclosures, we estimate an average investment size of $12.7 million for Blue Sky remaining “growth” 


investments.  A similar calculation yields an estimated fee earning AUM of $218.6 million in Blue Sky’s growth category.  


Together we estimate that Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM in its private equity segment is no more than $419 million, and this 


is if we give full credit to Blue Sky’s markups of its unrealized investments, which as we will see, is likely far too generous.     





2. Evidence that Blue Sky misrepresents the performance of its investments.  Blue Sky has reported an impressive 15% IRR net 
of fees since inception in 2006.  To put this in context, if such returns are true, Blue Sky is one of the best asset managers in the 


entire world over the last decade.  But there is good reason to be suspicious.  Since inception, Blue Sky has only exited 39 


investments, an average of 3-4 per year, of which a large number have been residential property developments around Queensland.  


As a result, the vast majority of Blue Sky’s reported performance is based on the markup of unrealized investments still lingering 


in its portfolio.  We believe that Blue Sky has been overstating its financial performance by aggressively, and unjustifiably, marking 


up the value of its unrealized assets.  Our thesis is based on two categories of evidence: the first is the Company’s consolidated 


financial statements, the second is documented examples where Blue Sky has, in our opinion, clearly overstated the performance 


and value of certain investments.   


 
a. Ballooning Receivables and Deteriorating Cash Flows.  Over time, inappropriately inflating the value of unrealized 


investments begins to distort the financial statements of an asset manager because its receivables balloon with uncollected 


performance and management fees.  In Blue Sky’s case, receivables have grown so rapidly that they comprised 129% of 


revenues as of H1 2018, up from just 45% of revenues as of FY 2015.  As receivables have ballooned, Blue Sky’s reported 


free cash flow has deteriorated despite seemingly impressive paper profits.  This is, in our opinion, a telltale sign of overstated 


performance. 





b. Foundation Early Learning is 10.8x levered.  Blue Sky has marked up its investment in Foundation Early Learning (FEL), 
a roll-up of day care centers, by 42% since 2014.  Blue Sky touts FEL as one of its best performing investments.  Yet according 


to its publicly available accounts, FEL’s operating cash flows fell 62% year-over-year in FY 2017.  We calculate that FEL’s 


EBITDA was just $1.8 million in FY 2017 and that it has a startling net debt to EBITDA ratio of 10.8x.  Given FEL’s negative 


cash flow and excessive leverage, FEL looks closer to financial calamity than a successful investment warranting a markup 


in value.

c. Billion Dollar Burrito.   Beach Burrito was Blue Sky’s first “VC” investment.  The Company wrote a $200,000 check in 
December 2006 to fund the opening of the very first store.  Only a handful of investments were made in 2006, hence tweaks to 


the value of Beach Burrito can skew the “since inception” performance Blue Sky relies on to market its funds today.  It is 


therefore alarming that Blue Sky has marked up its initial 2006 investment in Beach Burrito a suspicious 74x.  If we assume no 


debt, then Blue Sky is claiming that the value of Beach Burrito’s 12 sites (one restaurant abruptly shut in October 2017, hardly 


a sign of growth) is $62 million or 31x the forecasted EBITDA.  Blue Sky values a fast food Mexican restaurant chain at $5 


million per restaurant, which is laughable.  Such a valuation strains credulity and casts doubt over Blue Sky’s purportedly stellar 


“since inception” performance. 





d. Vinomofo: Strapped for Cash and Missing Growth Forecasts.   Blue Sky invested $25 million for a 22.7% stake in Vinomofo 
in February 2016.  By December 2016, Blue Sky had already claimed a 9.3% IRR on its investment.  Yet Vinomofo soon missed 


its forecasted revenue targets (despite doubling its marketing expenses) and continued to burn through cash at an alarming rate.  


Publicly available financials show that Vinomofo’s cash flow from operations was negative $6.3 million for FY ending June 


2017.  By June 2017, Vinomofo only had $2.2 million in cash left.  At that run rate, Vinomofo will likely run out of cash without 


further investment or financing.  Given that Vinomofo is struggling to grow and hemorrhaging cash, it appears to be 


underperforming, not meriting a markup in value and a claimed 9.3% IRR.    





e. Failure to THR1VE.  In 2015, Blue Sky invested in THR1VE (“Thrive”), which owns and operates a series of health food stalls 
scattered across Australian malls.  Blue Sky invested at an implied valuation of $8.4 million, 1.0x EV/revenue.  In 2017, Blue 


Sky announced a $10 million follow-on investment in Thrive at an implied valuation of $30 million, and a ludicrous 3.2x 


EV/revenue multiple.  Blue Sky’s follow-on investment makes it appear as though its 2015 investment is thriving (pun intended), 


when in reality Thrive’s growth has stalled.  Thrive’s EBITDA declined from negative $1.8 million in 2015, to an even more 


dire negative -$2.1 million in 2016.  Over that same period, revenues grew by just $2 million to $9.4 million.  By making a 


follow-on investment at a valuation determined solely at Blue Sky’s discretion, Blue Sky was free to overstate the value of Thrive 


and collect an upfront fee of 14% of the total invested capital.  We believe the data clearly indicates that Thrive is flailing, and 


that Blue Sky has overstated the performance of its investment.  





f. Viking Dunnies: Bad Smell.   In 2008 Blue Sky invested $2.7 million in Viking Rentals, an Australian renter of portable toilets.  
From the start, Viking underperformed Blue Sky’s forecasts.  Investor updates show that Viking’s EBITDA was just $1.1 million 


in 2009 (28% less than forecasted), and $1.7 million in 2010 (41% less than forecasted).  Despite poor underlying performance, 


Blue Sky marked up its investment by 3.7x and raised a new fund (EC 2010) to buy out previous investors at the higher valuation.  


In 2015, Blue Sky sold its investment in Viking to a mysterious buyer, Bayfront Capital Management (“Bayfront”).  Bayfront 


does not have a website, and the only employee publicly identified with it does not even list Bayfront on his CV.  ASIC fillings 


reveal Bayfront’s “principal office” is a modest residential property on the outskirts of Adelaide.  Ultimately, we question who 


really put up the money to fund Bayfront’s acquisition and find it suspicious that the buyer has no operating footprint.   





g. Lenard’s: Crying Fowl.  Blue Sky initially invested $3.3 million in 2008 for a 30% stake in Lenard’s Chicken, an owner/operator 
of chicken shops.  Lenard’s immediately underperformed.  Blue Sky reported that Lenard’s FY 2009 EBITDA was $718,000, 


65% less than forecast at the time of the Company’s initial investment.  In 2010, Blue Sky announced a follow-on investment 


from a new fund (EC 2010) of $7 million to buy out its previous investors at a price implying that Lenard’s had doubled in value 


in 28 months.  Similar to Viking, despite the fact that Lenard’s had performed disastrously, Blue Sky significantly marked up the 


value of its initial investment, then used a follow-on investment to bail out old investors.  This is quintessentially Quintis.   





h. HeyLet’s Overstate Performance.  Blue Sky invested in HeyLets, a social networking site, in July 2014.  In an April 2017 
investment presentation, Blue Sky claimed an 8.5% IRR on its investment.  This is remarkable as Blue Sky admitted that HeyLets 


was in the process of being liquidated in an investment memorandum dated March 2017.  How could Blue Sky claim such a 


return on an investment that appears to have been a total loss?  





3. Blue Sky Gouges Australian Investors with Extortionate Fees.  Because of fee pressure on asset managers in recent years, only 
the world’s best can charge some variation of 2/20: a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee.  Yet, hidden in the fine print 


of Blue Sky’s investment documents, we discovered that Blue Sky consistently charged Australian investors extortionate 


management fees as high as 17%.  These are not performance fees tied to the success of the investments.  Rather, Blue Sky charges 


such fees up front and labels them as management fees, establishment fees, due diligence fees or other advisory fees.  Not only are 


Blue Sky’s ludicrous upfront fees an abusive practice that gouges the very investors Blue Sky claims to serve, but Blue Sky’s 


revenues will continue to shrink as it runs out of suckers to pay such exorbitant fees. 





4. Those Who Know Best, Sell.  We believe that as AUM grows, Blue Sky’s overstatement of its fee earning assets and returns gets 
bigger and bigger.  We expect that this scheme will soon collapse, so it is a significant red flag that Blue Sky’s founder and Managing 


Director Mark Sowerby abruptly resigned in September 2016 and had sold 50% of his entire holdings that year, pocketing $35 


million.  To us, the timing is no coincidence.  We believe that if Sowerby had confidence in Blue Sky, he would not have exited such 


a large block position so quickly.  But given what we have uncovered in analyzing the Company’s disclosures, in our opinion, 


Sowerby was selling out before the Company’s share price inevitably collapses.

VALUATION 





Blue Sky’s main broker, Morgans, claims  that AUM is the key driver of revenues and ultimately the share price of the Company.  Blue 


Sky compares itself to US listed alternative asset managers, which trade at an average multiple on enterprise value to fee earning AUM of 


0.13x.  By comparison Blue Sky’s shares are expensive, as the Company trades at a higher multiple (0.23x) of even its claimed fee earning 


AUM. 


 
Source: Bloomberg, calculated as of March 27, 2018 





Investors are pricing Blue Sky at a premium to the private equity powerhouses such as Blackstone and Apollo.  Not only is such a premium 


entirely unjustified, but in this report, we present an exhaustive body of evidence to support our investment thesis that Blue Sky’s real fee 


earning AUM is a fraction of what it claims.  Furthermore, we believe that Blue Sky’s revenues are comprised of either extortionate 


management fees used to gouge unsuspecting investors (which we view as unsustainable) or dubious receivables based on what appears 


to be Blue Sky’s systemic practice of overstating the value of unrealized investments.   





Based on our analysis, we think Blue Sky’s maximum fee earning AUM is no more than $1.5 billion, 63% below the $3.9 billion in fee 


earning AUM that Blue Sky reports to investors.   
 


 
Source: Glaucus Calculation 





In addition, we think that Blue Sky should trade at a discount to blue chip asset managers because of the multitude of corporate governance 


concerns identified in our analysis. 





 
Source: Glaucus Calculation 





Our valuation implies a market capitalization of $256 million and a Glaucus adjusted share price of $2.66, 77% below the current share 


price of $11.43.  That said, we believe that this valuation is likely far too generous to the Company because it gives full credit to Blue 


Sky’s reported performance on its portfolio, which we believe is significantly overstated.  We therefore think it would be reasonable for 


investors to value Blue Sky’s shares even lower.  Where the bottom is, perhaps not even Blue Sky knows.

BLUE SKY WILDLY EXAGGERATES ITS FEE EARNING AUM  





Blue Sky Alternative Asset Management Limited (ASX: BLA) (“Blue Sky” or the “Company”) is an Australian fund 


manager with a purported $3.9 billion of fee earning assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 2017.  





 
Source: 1H 2018 Investor Presentation 





This capital is invested across 80 individual funds spread across three main asset classes; real estate, private equity 


and agricultural and resource assets (such as water) (which we will define as “Agricultural and Resources”).   Blue 


Sky claims to have achieved a 15% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) net of fees since inception.  Driven by the supposed 


rapid increase in “fee earning” AUM, Blue Sky’s market capitalization has doubled in two years to nearly $1 billion. 





In its prospectus and earlier annual reports, Blue Sky differentiated between fee-earning AUM (then called FUM) and 


AUM, but the Company has since abandoned such distinctions.  For example, on the March 2018 capital raising 


conference call, Managing Director Robert Shand stated that Blue Sky “only reports the AUM that has been awarded, 


deployed, and is therefore fee earning.”   





But all is not as it seems.  We believe that Blue Sky is significantly overstating its fee earning AUM by reporting the 


gross value of certain assets as AUM instead of the fair value of the capital invested.  





Blue Sky’s public filings give very limited disclosure regarding a breakdown of its investments, but even from the 


Company’s financial statements it is obvious that something is amiss.  Management fees have consistently lagged the 


rapid growth of fee earning AUM.  For example, from FY 2015 to LTM H1 2018, Blue Sky’s reported fee earning 


AUM increased from $1.35 billion to $3.9 billion, yet management fees only increased from $25 million to $41 million 


over that same period.  If management fees are charged as a flat fee on AUM, why would management fees not 


increase lock step (or close to lock step) with reported fee earning AUM? 





 
Source: Blue Sky Public Filings, Glaucus Calculation 





In late 2017, we contacted the Company about making an investment in one of its funds. A sales representative 


disclosed that 50% of Blue Sky AUM was allocated to real estate investments, with the remainder split between 


Agricultural and Resource investments and private equity.  This split is corroborated by Blue Sky’s reported 


performance fee revenues across asset classes. 1   


                                                           
1 Returns are remarkably similar across the three main asset classes.  Therefore, performance fee revenues should be a good indicator of the AUM 


of each asset class.

2. Performance split: Morgans Presentation 20162 





If Blue Sky is telling the truth about its fee earning AUM, then we should be able to verify that the value of its invested 


capital in real estate investments is $1.95 billion, the value of its invested capital in Agricultural and Resource assets 


(such as water rights) is $975 million, and the value of its invested capital in private equity (including growth 


investments and venture capital) is $975 million.   





Yet after reviewing the underlying investments we estimate that Blue Sky’s actual fee earning AUM is a fraction of 


this reported figure and that Blue Sky is inflating its reported AUM.  





1) We Estimate that Real Estate AUM is no more than $683.5 million 
 


Blue Sky’s touts its success as a real estate investor, claiming to generate an internal rate of return (IRR) of 15.8% 


p.a. net of fees in this segment since 2007.3  As of December 30, 2017, Blue Sky claimed to have $1.95 billion in real 


estate assets spread amongst dozens of funds in residential property, student dormitory, retirement living developments 


and commercial property.   





We believe that Blue Sky materially overstates its real estate AUM by counting the gross value of its real properties 


as AUM rather than the fair value of its equity investment in such properties. 





The basic premise behind real estate or private equity investing is that asset managers borrow much of the capital 


required to purchase and develop an asset.  For example, if an asset manager buys a real estate development worth 


$100 million, the asset manager will typically invest $30 million in equity and borrow $70 million from a bank.   





In our theoretical example, credible asset managers like KKR and Blackstone would report that the fee earning AUM 


of the project is $30 million, the value of the invested capital.  As the fund manager would not typically earn fees on 


the $70 million borrowed from the bank to complete the transaction, this borrowed money would not be included in 


its reported fee earning AUM.

We believe that Blue Sky unjustly inflates its reported fee earning AUM by, using the above example, reporting the 


AUM of the project as $100 million, including both the $30 million in invested capital (on which Blue Sky earns fees) 


and the $70 million in debt borrowed from banks to complete the purchase on which, critically, Blue Sky does not 


earn fees.   





To our knowledge, no other asset manager defines fee earning AUM in this way.  We contacted the leading asset 


managers who invest in private equity, real estate and alternative assets, including KKR, Apollo and Blackstone.  Each 


of them defines fee earning AUM as the fair value of their invested capital and not the gross value of assets, 


companies or real properties.  Blue Sky can’t claim this is some sort of Aussie quirk, because ASX listed asset 


managers Magellan Financial and Rural Funds also use the proper definition of fee earning AUM as the fair value of 


invested capital.  





By overstating its fee earning AUM, we believe that Blue Sky not only defies standard reporting practices followed 


by major publicly listed asset managers, but it unjustly inflates the Company’s stock price.  To understand Blue Sky’s 


deception, we believe it is critical to go back to its IPO prospectus, where in our opinion, Blue Sky first began to 


overstate its fee earning AUM.     





In its original4 IPO prospectus, Blue Sky reported that its real estate AUM was $89 million (40% of Blue Sky’s total 


AUM).  Blue Sky’s prospectus included the following table, which calculated real estate AUM as the sum of four 


unrealized investments.

4 Blue Sky included this AUM breakdown in its first IPO prospectus, dated November 16, 2011, which can be found on Bloomberg. Suspiciously, 


a week later, this information was taken out of a subsequent IPO prospectus submitted to the Australian Securities Exchange.

Our analysis shows that Blue Sky was overstating its real estate AUM in its prospectus by including the gross value 


of the properties and not, as is proper, simply the value of invested capital.   


In the Company’s IPO prospectus, Blue Sky reported that the AUM for the Milky Way Development 2 (“Riverway 


Point”) was $25 million as of June 2011.  But the investment memorandum for Riverway Point, dated October 31, 


2007, clearly stated that the future gross value of the development will be $24.4 million, and that Blue Sky invested 


only $4 million of equity in the development.   








 
Source: Riverway Point Supplementary Investment Memorandum 2007 





Put simply, when Blue Sky referred to the AUM of its real estate investment in Riverway Point in its initial IPO 


prospectus, it was mischaracterizing AUM as the gross value of the property, not the equity invested in the project by 


the fund.5   





This overstatement appears systematic.  Blue Sky stated in its initial prospectus that the AUM for the Kelso Investment 


Unit Trust (“Kelso”) was $4 million, as of June 2011.  The investment memorandum for Kelso dated January 3, 2007, 


stated that Blue Sky invested only $1 million of equity to develop the property, and raised $1.8 million in debt to 


complete the project.  The total project value, as reported by Blue Sky in 2007, was $2.8 million.  





 
Source: Kelso Investment Memorandum 2007 





We think it is obvious that the Company’s reported AUM of $4 million for the Kelso investment in its IPO prospectus, 


like Riverway Point, was Blue Sky’s estimate of the gross property value, not the value of its $1 million equity 


investment. 





We find the same pattern in analyzing the remaining real estate investments disclosed in the Company’s IPO 


prospectus even though we were unable to obtain the underlying investment memoranda.  In its prospectus, Blue Sky 


stated that the Brisbane Eight Mile Plains Trust development, known as Centrus One (“Centrus”), had an AUM of 


$15 million as of June 2011. Blue Sky disclosed that Centrus is a 38-unit apartment block completed in February 


2013.  Blue Sky’s disclosures imply an average value per apartment of $394,737.  Centrus is located 16 kilometers 


away from Brisbane City.  Domain provides transaction history of properties in Australia. The record showed that the 


                                                           
5 This is corroborated by comparing the reported Riverway Point unit sale price $348,571 with the actual average sale price of units in that 


development; $354,000

units of Centrus were sold, on average, at $339,357, meaning that Blue Sky was clearly, in our opinion, conflating the 


fee earning AUM of Centrus with the gross value of the entire development.    





Blue Sky completed the RAMS Plantations Fund development (“Plantations”) in October 2011.  As of June 2011, the 


property was still under construction. Blue Sky stated that the AUM for the Plantations in its IPO prospectus was $12 


million. This implies a value per apartment of $285,714.  The Plantations is located 37 kilometers from Brisbane.  An 


Australian property website shows the units of Plantations were sold for $310,824 on average.  Again, to us it is 


obvious that in its prospectus, Blue Sky reported the AUM of Plantations as the value of the entire development upon 


completion (equity investment plus debt), even though it does not earn fees on debt raised to build the apartments and 


had yet to finish construction.   





The same is true for the fourth and final IPO real estate asset, Milky Way Development 4 Unit Trust, (“Castle Point”).  


Blue Sky reported an AUM of $36 million for Castle Point in its IPO prospectus.  This implies a value per apartment 


of $352,941.  Australian property website shows the units of Castle Point were sold at 353,500 on average.

Blue Sky reported a real estate IPO AUM of $89 million from the four developments we discussed above: Riverway 


Point, Plantations, Centrus and Castle Point.  From our analysis, it is clear that Blue Sky’s reported AUM is the 


Company’s assessment of the gross value of those developments.  In order to estimate Blue Sky’s actual fee earning 


AUM associated with its residential developments, we can extrapolate based on the ratio of equity to project value in 


Blue Sky’s projects for which the underlying investment documents are available.   





The investment memorandum for the Riverway Point development shows an Equity to Value (“ETV”) ratio of 31% 


for the project (i.e., $7.7 million in fair value of equity on a $24.4 million project).

Blue Sky, like other real estate developers, tends to borrow a significant portion of the construction costs for their 


property developments.  Accordingly, in our analysis we assume that the Equity-to-Value ratio for the Riverway Point 


development is likely consistent across Blue Sky’s other developments.  





By applying a 31% ETV ratio to Blue Sky’s other real estate developments, we estimate that Blue Sky’s real estate 


AUM was a maximum of $27 million at the time of the IPO (69% lower than reported).  This implies that Blue 


Sky’s IPO prospectus overstated its real estate AUM by at least 3.3x.   





 
Source: Blue Sky Prospectus, Glaucus Calculation 





Independent data corroborates our conclusion.  In 2014, Microequities Research published its initial report on the 


Company.  In its research, Microequities estimated the gross realizable value of the Company’s real estate investments.

The Microequities estimates, prepared at the behest of Blue Sky, corroborates our analysis that Blue Sky’s reported 


real estate AUM in its IPO prospectus was significantly inflated.   





Today there are several key segments that supposedly make up Blue Sky’s $1.9 billion in reported real estate AUM: 


residential properties, student accommodations, retirement living homes and commercial property.  We think it is 


clear, on an inspection of 39 Blue Sky real estate related investments, that the Company is playing the same tricks 


today as it did at IPO. 





a. Residential Real Estate AUM at most $135 million.  
 


Blue Sky’s residential property website lists investments in 24 residential properties.  Blue Sky lays out the location, 


completion date and number of units per property on this website. For instance, the development referred to as the 


Establishment is located in Kangaroo Point, has 105 units and was completed in January 2017. 





 
Source: The Establishment, residential property website 





In compiling our estimate of Blue Sky’s true fee earning AUM, it is necessary to remove from our calculation the 


residential properties that were already sold and are no longer part of Blue Sky’s real estate portfolio.  





Blue Sky’s prospectus lists three projects that were completed prior to the Company going public: Paddington 


Terraces, Kelso and Milky Way 1.  In addition, a publicly traded related party named the Blue Sky Public Access 


Fund (ASX: BAF), (“Access Fund”), which invests exclusively in funds managed by Blue Sky, reveals other 


residential property developments which have been sold.7 





                                                           
7 The Access Fund is a public investment vehicle floated by Blue Sky in 2014 to invest exclusively in Blue Sky managed investments.  As of 
October 2017, the access fund has raised $224 million from the Australian public markets.  The Access Fund has a market capitalization of $249 


million.

From public disclosures we estimate that Blue Sky has sold at least 11 of these property developments as of December

Sky’s fee current earning AUM, as these assets should no longer be included in the calculation.

In order to value the remaining unrealized properties in Blue Sky’s real estate portfolio, we can extrapolate based on 


the gross value of one of Blue Sky’s poshest developments, Flora Street Greenslopes Trust, The Florence, (“Flora”).  


In its investment memorandum for Flora, Blue Sky forecasted to sell Flora’s 112 apartment units for a gross sale price 


of $54.7 million ($488,214 per apartment). 





                                                           
8 We can tie these property trust names to the specific properties on the Blue Sky residential website. This is relatively simple, for instance, it is 


clear that the Establishment is Kangaroo Point Trust. They share the same name, location and number of units.  Disclosures in Microequities 


research reports also provides information on which properties have been sold.

Source: Flora Information Memorandum 2015 





In addition to debt, Blue Sky deducted apartment transfers and other project cost to arrive at a value of equity upon

According to Blue Sky’s website, the Company has made a total of 24 investments in residential real estate and is 


currently raising capital for two additional residential projects.  After subtracting the realized investments, we estimate 


that Blue Sky has 15 current residential properties included in its fee earning AUM.  





If we analyze Blue Sky’s 15 property investments on a unit basis we can estimate the true residential fee earning 


AUM.  Blue Sky reports the number of apartments per property.  To estimate gross property value, we multiplied the 


number of units per apartment building by the average unit price Blue Sky forecasted for one of its poshest property, 


the Flora, of $488,214.  Using this logic, we calculate that the gross value of Blue Sky’s portfolio, which we believe 


is at most $540.5 million (1,107 units multiplied by $488,214).   





To get an equity value of Blue Sky’s residential portfolio, we combined our estimate of the gross value of Blue Sky’s 


properties with the ETV ratio of 25%, which is the ETV ratio of Blue Sky’s Flora development.  From there, we 


estimate that Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM associated its residential portfolio is $135.1 million.

Note: We apply an ETV ratio of 25% (The Flora Project ETV ratio is 23%) to Blue Sky’s other residential property developments  





The point is that even if we make generous assumptions in favor of the Company’s portfolio (by ascribing the value 


per unit of the Flora development to Blue Sky’s other residential developments), we calculate that the maximum AUM 


from its residential real estate portfolio is $135 million. 





We cross checked our estimates of the specific gross property values against the gross realizable property values

Blue Sky claims that its real estate AUM is 50% of its total fee earning AUM, or $1.95 billion.  But if residential 


properties contribute at a maximum, only $135 million in fee earning AUM, can the remainder be accounted for by 


the Company’s investments in student accommodations, retirement homes, commercial property and other real estate 


investments?  The answer is no.

We were also able to glean the key details for the Student Accommodation Fund IV (“SA 6”).  Blue Sky sought to 


raise equity of $15.75 million and debt of $39.5 million, Blue Sky also anticipated funding of $15.75 million from 


Goldman Sachs, for a total project cost of $71 million.  The projected LTV for SA 6 is 50% and the development is 


anticipated to have 546 beds at a gross value of $144,689 per bed.

To understand the maximum equity value across Blue Sky’s student accommodation fund, we first calculate the 


average gross value per bed for SA 4 and SA 6 ($138,062).

We then multiply by 5,200, the number of beds Blue Sky claims in its H1 2018 results presentation.  From there, we 


assume a generous 50% LTV on the finished property to calculate the maximum equity value of invested capital in 


this segment.   





But there is a final step.  In March 2016, Blue Sky partnered with Goldman Sachs to build a portfolio of 10,000 student 


beds. The JV with Goldman Sachs is structured as a typical 50/50 joint ownership.10  Blue Sky recently confirmed in 


its March 2018 capital raising presentation that it splits ownership of its ~5,200 beds in its student accommodation 


segment 50/50 with Goldman Sachs.   





 
Source: Blue Sky Equity Raising Presentation March 2018 





Public disclosures indicate that Goldman provided 50% of the invested equity in Blue Sky’s student accommodation 


developments in Australia (with the possible exception of Blue Sky’s first fund).  From the estimate of the average 


value per bed, we can use Blue Sky’s total number of reported beds to estimate total project value.  From there, we 


apply a generous estimate of 50% LTV, we can calculate the equity value of the projects and the amount likely invested 


by both Blue Sky and Goldman in these projects.

Based on the calculation above, we estimate that the maximum equity value for the Student Accommodation portfolio 


is $189 million. This generously assigns the completed value to all the properties in the student accommodation 


portfolio despite Blue Sky assigning a blanket 2020-2022 exit date across eight properties.11  





c. Retirement Living AUM at most $149 million.  
 


In 2017, Blue Sky also began raising capital for a retirement living investment called Parkwood.  We have obtained 


the underlying fund documentation for this investment.  





According to the fund documents for Parkwood, Blue Sky plans to invest only $12.6 million of equity into the 


Parkwood fund to build 261 Independent Living Units (“ILU”).  Blue Sky estimates that Parkwood will have an 


estimated total project value of $144 million. This equates to an average value of $551,935 per ILU.

The table above shows that while Blue Sky reports a total project value of $144 million, Blue Sky has invested only 


$12.6 million in Parkwood.  If Parkwood is any indication, Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM for retirement living 


investments is only 9% of total project value ($12.6 million divided by $144 million), with the rest made up of JV

is typical across other Blue Sky retirement investments.   





Blue Sky disclosed to the Financial Review that the Corinda Fund, (“Corinda”) will be a ILUs property with a 


completion value of $130 million. This implies a value per unit of $520,000.  Aura’s LinkedIn page states that the 


Maroochydore Fund will consist of 117 ILUs with a final value of $67 million. This equates to $572,650 per unit.  


From the above values per ILU stated for Parkwood, Corina and Maroochydore, we assume an average ILU upon 


completion of $543,081.

Like student accommodation developments, Blue Sky also develops retirement living properties with a JV partner, 


SC Capital, a real estate investor.  According to the Company’s disclosures, SC Capital provides 50% of the equity 


for Aura’s retirement projects and Blue Sky funds the other 50%.

Blue Sky states that it has > 1,100 ILU in its portfolio as of H1 2018.

If we assume the value of ILUs is consistent with values per ILU stated for Parkwood, Corina and Maroochydore, 


then the gross realizable value of these 1,100 ILU would be $597 million.13  If we generously apply a 50% LTV on 


the gross property value, which is consistent with the Parkwood fund documentation,14 we can estimate the equity 


portion of these retirement property projects.  As Blue Sky contributes only 50% of the equity portion, we estimate 


that Blue Sky’s AUM in retirement living segment as $149 million.

settlement proceeds are contingent on the success of earlier phases in the project, and are not invested capital. 
13 1,100 ILUs multiplied by $534,081 
14 Note that a 50% LTV for Parkwood is exceptionally generous.  Blue Sky only invested $12.8 million of equity to arrive at a project value of 
$144 million.  The 50% LTV is based on Blue Sky receiving future proceeds from the first and second phase of sales in Parkwood and 


reinvesting the proceeds in Parkwood as equity.

3.  Glaucus Calculation 





Residential Developments, Student Accommodation and Retirement Living represent the three largest areas for Blue 


Sky.  We also believe that these three segments represent the key areas where Blue Sky has chosen to grossly 


exaggerate AUM.  Yet, as should be obvious based on the underlying investment documents and our calculations, 


Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM (or the fair value of the invested capital in these assets), is only a fraction of the total 


value of these projects.  We believe that, when reporting fee earning AUM to the market, Blue Sky fails to deduct 


debt and capital from JV partners like Goldman and SC Capital.   





Our sum of the parts analysis relies on estimates because Blue Sky is not transparent with investors about its portfolio.  


However, we believe that our analysis is likely overly generous to the Company because we have made a number of 


assumptions in the Company’s favor.  





In order to be as comprehensive as possible, we will also include our estimate of other real estate related assets in our 


calculation of what we believe to be Blue Sky’s true fee earing AUM, including investments in commercial property, 


student accommodations in North America and management rights. 





d. Other Real Estate Related Investments 
 


Blue Sky has also invested in commercial property, a category by which Blue Sky refers to its 38% ownership stake 


in the Cove Property Group (the “Cove”).  Blue Sky claims that the Cove is “currently managing >USD $1 billion of 


equity and debt capital” across two properties, the Hudson Commons and 2 Rector St.   








 
Source: March 2018 Capital Raise Presentation 





The Hudson Commons at 441 Ninth Avenue was acquired by the Cove for USD $330 million ($450 million) in a joint 


venture with Baupost Group.  A debt facility of USD $220 million ($300 million) was provided by Deutsche Bank to 


purchase the property.  We calculate an LTV of 67% at acquisition in December 2016.

value of USD $225 million ($300 million).

The Cove also secured a property loan from Apollo of USD $479 million ($628 million) to expand the Hudson 


Commons property.  From these disclosures, it appears that Blue Sky are once again conflating gross value, including 


debt capital provided by other asset managers, as the fee earning AUM of the Company.   





 
Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 





Blue Sky claims that it reports 38% of the fee earning AUM in the Cove.  If Blue Sky is up to its old tricks, then Blue 


Sky’s “fee earning AUM” would be $489 million ($1,288 million multiplied by 38%).  We calculate that the genuine 


fee earning AUM attributable to Blue Sky from its Cove investment is just $50 million.

Blue Sky has also invested in student accommodations in the United States with an American joint venture partner, 


Student Quarters.  We have obtained underlying documentation pertaining to two such investments:  Student Quarters 


Yield Trust 2 and Student Quarter Property Trust 2.  The underlying fund documents show that debt comprises 65% 


of the projected value of these investments and an average value per bed of USD $98,287 ($123,362).

From the Access Fund,15 we know that a fourth management rights fund exists, however, disclosures state that the 


fourth fund has sold its rights in the Southport Residential Apartments to the Mantra Group.  Therefore, this fund has 


likely been realized and is excluded from our calculation of fee earning AUM.   





According to the Australian Business Register (ABR), the first management rights income fund was registered in May 


2012.  





 
Source: ABR Website 





If we assume all funds were started on the same day as the first fund, clearly a generous assumption, then the current 


value of invested capital at Blue Sky’s stated IRR of 15.8% for real estate implies an AUM contribution for 


management rights of $40.7 million.  





 
Source: Glaucus Calculation 





A sum of the parts analysis of Blue Sky’s portfolio is notoriously difficult because the Company is deliberately vague 


about the composition of its portfolio and its various investments.  Because it is hard for investors to pin down exactly 


how Blue Sky calculates its fee earning AUM, it is difficult for the market to check the Company’s representations.  





Blue Sky’s representative told us on a recorded phone call that real estate related investments comprise 50% of the 


Company’s reported $3.9 billion in fee earning AUM, or $1.95 billion in fee earning investments.  Yet of the 39 real 


estate funds included in our estimate, we calculate that the maximum fee earning AUM of Blue Sky’s real estate 


related investments is no more than $683.5 million.  By our estimate, Blue Sky’s real estate AUM is 65% less than it 


claims.

2) We believe Real Asset AUM is $315 million 
 


Blue Sky’s public filings give limited information regarding its alternative assets, which the Company confusingly 


refers to as real assets.  For clarity, we refer to this category as Agricultural and Resource investments.  The Company’s 


H1 18 presentation boasts a 16% IRR in this category since inception, highlighting the performance of its water fund.  


When we called to enquire about investing in Blue Sky’s Agricultural and Resource funds, a Blue Sky representative 


told us that this segment contributed 25% of total AUM, which would amount to $975 million in fee earning invested 


capital as of December 31, 2017.  





The Blue Sky Water Fund is marketed as open ended. Yet when we called Blue Sky, a sales representative stated it 


was closed, and would remain closed for further investment for the next year or so. The representative went on to 


reveal, in a recorded conversation, that the AUM of the Water Fund is “north of $150 million.”  





This statement puts Blue Sky in a difficult spot as the remaining Agricultural and Resource funds are tiny single asset 


investments. We obtained the underlying investment memorandum for the Blue Sky Premium Beef Development 


Fund (“Beef Fund”), which provides a breakdown of the remaining Agricultural and Resource investments made by 


Blue Sky.   





 
Source: Beef Fund Information Memorandum May 2017 





From the Access Fund disclosures, we get a description of certain Agricultural and Resource assets.  All are described, 


as is typical across Blue Sky’s investment portfolio, as single asset investments bar the strategic Australian agriculture 


fund.16

Source: Access Fund June 2017 Monthly Update 





First, the Agriculture Fund, which made an investment in a company named Gundaline Pty Ltd in March 2014, via 


Southern Agricultural Resources, (“Southern”).  Southern purchased Gundaline for $25 million.  News articles 


reported that Southern is backed by undisclosed, “overseas investors.”  But we know from the Access Fund disclosures 


that this “undisclosed” investor is likely Blue Sky.   





We generously assume that Blue Sky is the only investor in Southern.  We further generously assume that Blue Sky 


has generated a 16% IRR on this investment, in line with the stated Agricultural and Resource return claimed by Blue 


Sky.  This implies an AUM attributable to Blue Sky from the Agriculture fund of $44 million as of December 2017. 





Agriculture Fund II’s only investment was into Hillston Citrus (“Hillston”), an irrigated citrus orchard new Hillston 


in NSW. According to InvestSMART, Agriculture Fund II planned to raise $10 million in August 2015. We apply the 


16% return to this fund, and get an AUM of $14 million as of December 2017. 





 
Source: InvestSMART 





Agriculture Fund III’s only asset is a  $12 million  investment in Kialla Pure Foods (“Kialla”) in May 2016.  Blue Sky 


owns 33% of the company. Kialla is a flour processing facility. Again, we assume Blue Sky achieved its stated 16% 


return. We estimate AUM of $15 million as of December 2017.   





Finally, with respect to the Beef Fund, we have obtained the underlying documentation for this fund. Blue Sky claims 


to have raised $10 million for the Beef Fund in May 2017.  





 
Source: Beef Fund Information Memorandum May 2017 





We assume, between May 2017 and December 2017, the Beef Fund achieved the segment IRR of 16%.  This implies 


an AUM of $11 million for the Beef Fund.   Note that this estimate gives full credit to Blue Sky’s claimed returns, 


which, as we will see, merit considerable skepticism.  But for the purposes of calculating Blue Sky’s AUM, it is 


important to note that even if we assume Blue Sky has achieved its stated IRR on all its Agricultural and Resource 


assets, its AUM cannot even be close to what the Company claims. Nor do we deduct the exorbitant upfront fees 


totaling 13% of the capital raised from our generous estimate of Blue Sky’s Beef Fund AUM.

There is a final consideration.  Blue Sky is in the process of raising what it refers to as a Strategic Australian 


Agriculture Fund (SAAF).  Blue Sky states it is expected17 to raise $300 million in 2018, and therefore for the purposes 


of calculating the Company’s reported fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2017, we exclude SAAF in our estimate 


of fee earning AUM because has the fund has not yet closed.  We were able to find two contributions for a total of 


$81 million to SAAF.18 We generously include these contributions in our calculation of AUM.  





 
Source: H1 2018 Result Presentation 





If we add up the estimates for the invested capital across Blue Sky’s Agricultural and Resource assets, we calculate 


that Blue Sky’s AUM in this segment is at most, $315 million, 68% less than the Company claims.

Blue Sky might grumble that we have failed to include the “institutional mandate” in our calculation, which the 


Company acquired in 2015.  But on review, we see that this “institutional mandate” has little to do with fee earning 


AUM or the actual management of funds.  Blue Sky was acting as a mere advisor to a fund manager, First State Super.  








 
Source: Financial Review 





At IPO, Blue Sky included a “Sub-investment advisory” mandate with asset manager, Summit Water Asset 


Management in its calculation of AUM.  





                                                           
17 Blue Sky often claims to be in the process of raising significantly more capital than the Company manages to eventually raise.  The VC 2017 


fund is a case in point, Blue Sky claimed to be raising $200 million for the VC 2017 Fund but the same fund is still open for investment today and 
the information memorandum for VC 2017 reveals a minimum raise target of just $20 million.  
18 $15 million was contributed by the Access Fund.

We suspect that Blue Sky may be conflating “advising” with actual fund management.  Blue Sky published a press 


release stating a “strategic agreement”19 with Canadian pension fund, PSP, but failed to disclose the nature of such an 


agreement.  We suspect that Blue Sky may be up to its old tricks of overstating AUM, but this time, by classifying 


advisory “mandates” as fund management mandates; two very different things.  





Our estimate of the real estate ($684 million) and Agricultural and Resource AUM ($315 million) puts the burden on 


the private equity segment to provide the vast majority of the remaining claimed $3.9 billion AUM.  But as we will 


show, it is not even close.   





3) Our Estimate of Private Equity AUM is a Maximum of $419 million  
 


Blue Sky claims that private equity comprises the remaining 25% of its fee earning AUM, meaning the value of its 


fee earning invested capital in this segment should be $975 million.  Blue Sky currently reports 33 private equity 


invested businesses which it categorizes as either growth investments or venture capital.

a. 2017 fund document reveals only $86 million of equity invested in VC funds 
 


VC is supposed to contribute a large portion of AUM, yet underlying fund documentation for Blue Sky’s VC2017 


ESVCLP Fund (“VC2017”) reveals that Blue Sky invested only $85.8 million into 17 VC stage businesses; an average 


of just $5 million per company.

Because Blue Sky provides money multiples on its venture capital investments, we can therefore calculate the fair 


value of VC investments as $115.1 million as of December 2016.  The Company reports in its H1 18 Presentation that 


the return in its private equity segment is 13.9%.  Therefore, we assume that the $115.1 million grew, at the rate of 


13.9%, a highly generous assumption,20 to $136.6 million as of H1 2018.

Note: 1. we think the actual returns for each investment are much lower than reported, but for the purposes of estimating fee 


earning AUM, we conservatively give Blue Sky credit that its VC investments have generated an IRR of 13.9% after fees. 


2. Disposed investments are excluded from AUM (grey shaded) 


3. Shopback raised $32 million (USD 25 million) from 10 investors in November 2017.

In addition to its VC investments, Blue Sky lists 11 current “growth capital” investments.  We were able to find the 


invested amount for six businesses.  The remaining businesses; Sunfresh Salads, Active Adventures, Better Medical 


and QFS are small businesses (hence the lack of information).  We generously assume Blue Sky invested at the average 


value of $10 million for these remaining four businesses.

EVIDENCE THAT BLUE SKY OVERSTATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS INVESTMENTS 





Blue Sky has reported an impressive 15% IRR net of fees since inception in 2006.  To put this in context, if such 


returns are true, Blue Sky is one of the best asset managers in the entire world over the last decade.  But there is good 


reason to be suspicious of such claimed performance.  Since inception, Blue Sky has only exited 39 investments,21 an 


average of 3-4 per year, of which the majority have been residential property developments around Queensland.  As 


a result, much of Blue Sky’s reported performance is based on the markup of unrealized investments. 





Because its investments are illiquid and not traded on any verifiable stock exchange, management has considerable 


discretion over the valuation of its unrealized investments.  Even though Blue Sky claims that it retains internal and 


external “valuation specialists” to “assist” in valuing its investments, such evaluators are paid by Blue Sky and thus 


are not incentivized to disagree with management; lest they forfeit fat fees or future business.  





 
Source: Blue Sky Annual Report 2017 





The higher Blue Sky’s management marks its unrealized assets, the more performance and management fees the 


Company can “recognize” in its financials.  The more fees it recognizes, the larger the Company’s reported profits, 


and the higher its share price.  Aggressively marking up the value of its assets also allows the Company to claim 


fantastic investment returns, which Blue Sky uses to attract new investors; pushing up AUM and thereby increasing 


the Company’s stock price.  This creates a feedback loop by which management can enrich themselves simply by 


pushing for the markup in value of unrealized investments.

Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 








We believe that Blue Sky has been overstating its financial performance by aggressively marking up the value of its 


unrealized investments.  Our thesis is based on two categories of evidence: the first is the Company’s consolidated 


financial statements; the second is documented examples where Blue Sky has, in our opinion, clearly inflated the 


performance and value of certain assets in its portfolio.   





Blue Sky’s consolidated financials provide the first clues.  Over time, inappropriately inflating the value of 


investments begins to distort the financial statements of an asset manager because its receivables balloon with 


uncollected performance and management fees.  In Blue Sky’s case, the shoe fits.  





We believe that Blue Sky has marked up many of its investments to levels for which an exit is not possible without 


recording a loss or write-down.  Therefore, as marked-up assets cannot be realized (without recognizing a loss), the 


Company’s receivables balance grows and grows.  In Blue Sky’s case, receivables have grown so rapidly that they 


comprised 129% of revenues as of LTM H1 18, up from just 45% in FY 2015.  





 
Source: Blue Sky Public Filings 





The growth of receivables has led to a deterioration in earnings quality, as the Company has failed to generate free 


cash flows despite reporting seemingly impressive paper profits.

Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 








In our opinion, the deterioration in the Company’s cash flow generation and its ballooning receivables balance are 


both evidence that management is playing games by inappropriately marking up the value of unrealized investments.  


We believe that it will be impossible for Blue Sky to exit many of such investments without recognizing significant 


losses or impairments.  But this thesis is not only based on the consolidated financials; underlying documentation for 


Blue Sky funds reveal, in our opinion, that the Company has inflated the value of certain private equity investments 


in its portfolio.   





a. FOUNDATION EARLY LEARNING: FLOUNDERING, EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE 
 


Blue Sky presents Foundation Early Learning (“FEL”), a roll-up of child day care centers, as one of its top performing 


private equity investments.  The Company has long claimed FEL is moments away from IPO.  The Access Fund 


reveals that the Foundation Early Learning fund has been marked up 42% since the investment was made in 2014.  


Yet the latest annual report for FEL shows a business that, in our opinion, is excessively levered with little chance of 


being sold anywhere close to its current mark.  





Blue Sky paid $22 million for a 74% stake in FEL.  Blue Sky claims that FEL has performed strongly since acquisition.  


Access Fund monthly updates reveal that FEL was marked up by 12.37% in November 2014.  Blue Sky boasted that 


an exit was possible “in the second half of calendar 2015.” 





 
Source: November 2014 Access Fund Monthly Update 





Blue Sky marked FEL up a further 26.3% in January 2017. 
 


 
Source: February 2017 Access Fund Monthly Update 





This aggressive mark up in value does not tie with FEL’s annual reports, which show a business flirting with financial 


calamity.  According to its publicly available accounts, FEL has $18.7 million of debt and has a liability of $2.6 million 


related to acquisition payments.

We believe Blue Sky has over paid for small, barely profitable day care centers. For example, in FY2017, FEL spent 


$13 million to acquire 7 day care centers which collectively generated only a 1% pre-tax margin.

Over-levered and overvalued, FEL’s woes will have likely been further exacerbated by a worsening of industry trends 


since the publication of its June 2017 annual report.  Industry leader, G8 Education(“G8”), reported  “supply issues” 


and “regulatory requirements in relation to staffing ratios” in its latest trading update.  Since November 2017, G8 


Education’s share price has almost halved from $4.56 to $2.71.  Yet Blue Sky has marked up its investment to an 


EV/EBITDA multiple of 33.7x, a mighty premium to the 9.4x EV/EBITDA multiple at which industry leader (G8) 


trades.   
 


 
Source: FEL Annual Report 2017, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 


Note: G8 Education’s EV/EBITDA is on March 23, 2017 





A comparison between FEL and industry leader G8 shows that FEL’s valuation is absurd.  FEL, despite smaller size, 


has lower EBITDA margins and generates negative free cash flow.  It is also substantially more levered.  We calculate 


that FEL has a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 10.8x, compared to 1.5x for G8.

The only positive going for FEL is its supposed sales “growth,” but we know that such growth is attributable to 


acquisitions funded with excessive leverage.  We struggle to see how FEL will pay off such liabilities with negative 


net free cash flow, let alone be valued at a significant premium to a much healthier industry leader like G8.  





News articles claim that FEL is struggling to be sold with Blue Sky extending the deadline for the realization of the 


fund, just as the Company has done with other investments.  Blue Sky has marked up the value of its investment in 


FEL, yet the underlying business is dangerously over levered and based on the rapid decline in reported operating 


cash flows, FEL appears to be lurching towards calamity.   





If we valued FEL at the same multiple as G8, then we calculate that FEL is worth only $17.3 million, meaning investors 


in Blue Sky’s FEL Fund are likely sitting on a loss of invested capital rather than the 42% gain reported by Blue Sky.

Rather than reporting impressive returns by marking up the value of FEL, we believe that Blue Sky should be 


impairing its investment.   





b. The Billion Dollar Burrito 
 


Beach Burrito was Blue Sky’s first “VC” investment.  The Company wrote a $200,000 check in December 2006 to 


fund the opening of the very first store in January 2007.  Blue Sky then made a $2.8 million follow on investment in 


December 2012.  While Blue Sky prides itself on its stellar returns since “inception” we believe that the Company is 


distorting performance for its early years by using Beach Burrito’s valuation as a plug to generate an inflated IRR 


across its entire private equity portfolio.   





The VC performance track record of 25.4% is just the simple average IRRs of four categories: 2006 Vintage (26.7%), 


VC 2012 Fund (40.2%), Other 2012 Vintage Investments (26.9%) and VC 2014 Fund (8.1%).

We suspect that Beach Burrito is an even bigger contributor to overall performance “since inception” as Blue Sky 


made only a few investments in 2006/2007 and therefore tweaking the performance of just one investment can have a 


big impact on the overall 2007 performance and therefore a big impact on reported total returns since inception.  





It is thus alarming that Beach Burrito is so egregiously overvalued.  Blue Sky holds a 33% equity stake in what the 


Company calls a fast casual chain of Mexican restaurants.  Blue Sky expects run rate23 EBITDA to be $2 million by 


the end of FY2017 across 12 restaurants.

23 We have seen countless instances were Blue Sky’s claimed “run rate” EBITDA is much higher than what the underlying financials show.  


Therefore, we are being exceptionally generous by valuing Beach Burrito off of Blue Sky’s claimed “run rate” EBITDA.
42 
 


Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 





If we assume no debt, then the implied value of Beach Burrito’s 12 restaurants (one restaurant abruptly shut in October 


2017, hardly a sign of growth) is an absurd $62 million or 31x the forecasted EBITDA.24  
 


 
Source: Glaucus Calculation 





The absurdity of Blue Sky’s valuation is evident when compared with other publicly listed fast casual dining chains 


specializing in Mexican food such as Pollo Loco or Del Taco.    
 


 
Source: Bloomberg, Company filings 





Despite generating comparable EBITDA per store, Blue Sky has valued Beach Burrito at a massive premium to more 


established, fast growing brands.  We calculate that at current markup, Blue Sky values each of Beach Burrito’s fast 


food counters at $5 million per restaurant, which is laughable. 





Why has the Company marked up Beach Burrito so egregiously?  With so much riding on Blue Sky’s reported returns 


“since inception,” it is one of the early investments whose valuation can be tweaked to inflate Blue Sky’s reported 


performance.  As other investments underperform, more heat is put on Beach Burrito’s valuation to pick up the slack. 


Hence the bizarre circumstance where one of Australia’s leading asset managers with a $1 billion valuation is at least 


partially propped up by its markup of a $200,000 “VC” investment in a beach burrito fast food joint.  





c. VINOMOFO: STRAPPED FOR CASH AND MISSING GROWTH FORECASTS  
 


Vinomofo, an online wine retailer, is meant to be a rapidly growing flagship investment for Blue Sky.  Instead, 


Vinomofo’s latest annual report reveals a floundering business.  According to the VC 2017 Investor Memorandum, 


Blue Sky invested $25 million25 for a 22.7% stake in Vinomofo in February 2016.   
 


                                                           
24 We suspect that like Thrive, Beach Burrito is loss making at the EBITDA level, but we do not have the underlying financials so we are forced 


to use the “run rate” EBITDA figure of $2 million as claimed by Blue Sky.  


25 AFR reported that the Blue Sky investment memorandum for Vinomofo sought fees of $3.9 million including $1.3 million of “transaction fees” 


and 5 years of upfront management fees.  This equates to 16% upfront fees!  No wonder Blue Sky invested in Vinomofo.

By December 2016, in just a few months Blue Sky had marked up the value of its equity in Vinomofo by 1.1x and 


claimed a 9.3% IRR on its original investment.  
 


 
Source: VC 2017 Investor Presentation 





Such returns seem improbable given that Vinomofo almost immediately missed its revenue growth target, it continues 


to burn cash at a torrid pace, and appears to be dependent on further financing or investment to survive.  According to 


the AFR, Blue Sky forecasted that Vinomofo would generate $81.2 million of revenues in the fiscal year ending June 


2017.   





But publicly available financials state that Vinomofo’s revenues were only $43.7 million, 46% below Blue Sky’s 


forecast for that year.26  





In addition to missing revenue forecasts by a wide mark, Vinomofo reported a massive pre-tax loss of $6.7 million 


(almost double the year prior).  In December 2016, Blue Sky had marked up the value of its investment.  But at this 


time, Vinomofo was already halfway through a disastrous fiscal year in which revenue growth had stalled and losses 


had almost doubled!  Vinomofo’s sluggish growth was even more disastrous considering it doubled marketing 


expenses over the previous year ($6 million in FY 2017 vs. $3.2 million in FY 2016).  This suggests that despite 


investing more resources, customer acquisition costs are surging.

At that cash burn rate, we estimate that Vinomofo will likely run out of cash this fiscal year without further borrowings 


or investment.  Compounding our suspicion that the business is struggling, Vinomofo’s sole independent director, 


Rob Chapman, who was only appointed in August 2016, resigned just prior to year end.

Based on our review of Vinomofo, we struggle to see how Blue Sky could claim an 9.3% IRR on startup which was 


badly missing growth forecasts (despite a doubling of marketing expenses) and hemorrhaging cash.    





d. Failure to Thrive 
 


In December 2015, Blue Sky invested in THR1VE (“Thrive”), a small chain of healthy food stalls.  Eighteen months 


later, in June 2017, Blue Sky announced a follow-on investment of up to $9.9 million for an additional 33% interest 


in Thrive.

The investment memorandum reveals that after the follow-on investment, Blue Sky’s ownership stake in Thrive went 


from 26.3% to 50.6%.

Source: Glaucus Calculation 


Note: We calculate Blue Sky’s ownership interest prior to the follow-on investment 





Based on the amount invested and shares received at the time of the follow-on investment, Blue Sky had marked up 


Thrive to a point implying a total return of 257% and an IRR of 134% for its original investment, which closed a mere 


18 months earlier.    
 


 
Source: Blue Sky Investor Presentation June 2017, Glaucus Calculation 





In just 18 months, Blue Sky had marked up the value of its unrealized investment in Thrive to the point where it could 


claim a 134% IRR on its original investment.  This valuation was not determined in a market but, because Blue Sky 


was the only investor in the follow-on funding (and was diluting other shareholders), Blue Sky had sole discretion to 


set the price at which it would re-invest; and thus determined the return reported to original Thrive investors.   





Although such a markup may be justified if Thrive was indeed thriving, the financials indicate that Thrive’s underlying 


performance has stalled.  Although Thrive operates a simplistic business model, a few food stalls scattered across 


shopping malls, the business continued to hemorrhage cash and operated at an increasingly large operating loss. 


Revenue grew by just $2.4 million despite a doubling of the store count.  Yet Blue Sky still saw fit to increase its 


investment in Thrive at a valuation of 3.2x EV/revenue, even though it originally invested at a multiple of 1x 


EV/revenue just 18 months prior.

We question how Blue Sky can justify its decision to mark up the value of its investment by 257% in 18 months under 


such circumstances.  We suspect that rather than Thrive being a good candidate for growth and further investment, 


the business was actually running out of cash and needed Blue Sky to inject further funds to perpetuate the façade.  


We believe that Blue Sky marked up the value of its Thrive investment and announced a follow-on investment at a 


valuation which made its prior investment appears successful, even though in reality, the underlying financials suggest 


that the business had stalled.  





e. VIKING DUNNIES: A BAD SMELL 
 


Viking Rentals, (“Viking”) is a portable toilet business and was one of Blue Sky’s earliest private equity investments.  


The performance of Viking is held up as one of just three VC exits since 2006.  Blue Sky purportedly sold its stake in 


Viking to Bayfront Capital Management (“Bayfront”), an Adelaide investment group, for $11 million in July 2015.  


Our due diligence of this transaction raises more questions than answers: we can find no evidence that Bayfront has 


any operations, and the only person publicly affiliated with Bayfront fails to list his involvement on his CV.  Although 


we hesitate to characterize the exit as a sham transaction without more information, it certainly appears suspicious.  


Yet the transaction also highlights what we believe to be a recurring pattern: that despite poor underlying performance, 


Blue Sky appears to have marked up the value of its investment to a valuation that looks inappropriate.     





Blue Sky touts Viking as one of its successful private equity exits.  Blue Sky claimed in its VC 2017 presentation to 


have invested $4.7 million into Viking and achieved an impressive 15.8% IRR, net of fees.   


 
Source: VC 2017 Presentation 





According to the investment documents available on the website of Pamplona (affiliated with Blue Sky’s chairman),27 


Blue Sky initially invested a total of $2.7 million in Viking across different funds at three different points between 


2007 and 2008.

This transaction reminds us of Quintis.  Blue Sky used new funds raised from investors (EC 2010) to buy out old 


investors at a dubious valuation, even though Viking had underperformed Blue Sky’s financial forecasts.  Over the 17 


months between the November 2008 investment and the transfer to EC 2010, Blue Sky marked up the value of its 


investment by 3.7x, which allowed the asset manager to claim a 75% IRR on its initial investment.

We do not see how Blue Sky could justify such a markup given Viking’s significant underperformance of Blue Sky’s 


financial forecasts.  Indeed, Blue Sky originally projected that it would exit Viking in 2010, but for years could not 


find a buyer at such an absurd valuation.   





But a mysterious buyer eventually arrived.  According to Blue Sky, it sold EC 2010’s stake in Viking to Bayfront in 


July 2015, for $11 million, implying an equity to EBITDA ratio of 7.0x.

But this transaction has many suspicious features.  First, Bayfront does not appear to have a website.28  Second, Blue 


Sky’s press release announcing the transaction quoted Daniel Hill, Bayfront’s “spokesperson,” as stating that “we are 


very much looking forward to the opportunity presented in the business.”  When we pulled the publicly available 


ASIC company information for Bayfront Capital Management Pty Ltd, the same Daniel Hill was listed as both the 


sole director and Company secretary.

Yet Hill does not mention Bayfront or his role as its director or spokesperson, on his LinkedIn page (although he does

CFO of AEM Cores.   





If the only person publicly affiliated with Bayfront does not see fit to mention it on his CV, we begin to wonder who 


exactly funded the Viking buyout?  Adding to our suspicion, the ASIC company registrar states that Bayfront’s

In our view, the transaction appears deeply suspicious.  If Bayfront was a legitimate third-party investor, why does it 


not have a website? Why can’t we find any evidence that Bayfront is an operating business with employees or a 


physical address?  The only individual publicly affiliated with Bayfront does not even list his involvement on his CV.  


Furthermore, Bayfront is registered to a modest residence in Adelaide, not what we would expect from an investor 


with sufficient resources to pay $11 million to Blue Sky for a 56% stake in a port-o-potty business.    





Ultimately, the Viking transaction leaves investors with more questions than answers.  Blue Sky created three separate 


vehicles to invest in Viking.  Despite the fact that Viking underperformed, by some margin, Blue Sky’s projections, 


Blue Sky continued to mark up the value of the business in its portfolio.  In 2010, Blue Sky transferred its stake in 


Viking to itself (the EC 2010 fund) at a markup of 3.7x over the previous 28 months, a ludicrous upward revaluation.  


Reminiscent of Quintis, Blue Sky used new investors to buy out old investors at a premium valuation (set by the asset 


manager), only to turn around and claim fantastic performance on the underlying investment.    





Then, Blue Sky appears to have miraculously offloaded its stake in Viking to a mysterious investor in 2015 (five years 


after it projected to exit), of whom little information is known.  Other than Blue Sky’s press release, we could find no 


evidence to suggest that Bayfront is an operating business.  This raises the possibility, in our opinion, that perhaps 


Blue Sky (or investors affiliated with Blue Sky) were really behind Bayfront.  The truth, we expect, will come out.    





f. LENARD’S CHICKEN: CRYING FOWL 
 


Another one of Blue Sky’s larger initial investments, Lenard’s Chicken (“Lenard’s”) operates a string of chicken 


shops across Australia.  We believe that Lenard’s presents another example in which Blue Sky overstated the 


performance of its unrealized investment.  Despite evidence that Lenard’s has underperformed Blue Sky’s projections, 


Blue Sky raised new money from the market to buy out old investors at an absurd premium, which again, is 


quintessential Quintis.   





Blue Sky initially invested $3.3 million for a 30% stake in Lenard’s, implying a total equity value of $11 million ($3.3 


million divided by 30%), in June 2008.

In order to market the follow-on investment, Blue Sky reported that Lenard’s EBITDA was $1.8 million, because 


Blue Sky added back any losses attributable to the failure of the Lenard’s Extra business.  We find this decision highly 


questionable, because the Company included the revenues attributable to Lenard’s Extra for FY 2009 but eliminated 


the losses.

forecasts by a wide mark.  The evidence indicates that Lenard’s was struggling, yet Blue Sky raised money from new 


investors to buy out its initial investors at a hefty premium.   





Once Lenard’s was transferred to EC 2010, information has been hard to come by.  Blue Sky removed Lenard’s from 


its list of private equity investments.  News articles suggest that Lenard’s continued to struggle.  The Courier ran a 


story in September 2017 stating that Lenard’s EBITDA went to negative $300,000 in 2015, and only positive $1 


million in 2017.  This suggests Lenard’s EBITDA has barely grown since 2008.  But that did not stop Blue Sky from 


marking up the value of Lenard’s in its portfolio. 





g. HeyLets Ignore Liquidation 
 


Blue Sky invested in HeyLets, a social networking site, in July 2014.  In an April 2017 investment presentation, Blue 


Sky claimed an 8.5% IRR on its investment.

This is remarkable as HeyLets was in the process of being liquidated as of March 2017!  Blue Sky trashes the

Examples like HeyLets would be comical if not so tragic.  How could Blue Sky mark up the value of its investment 


at the same time it admitted that HeyLet’s was in the process of being liquidated? It may sound obvious, but shouldn’t 


such a failed investment be marked to zero?   





Selling Winners; Keeping Losers 





A final wrinkle deserves mention.  Blue Sky attempts to bolster its credibility by claiming that it has exited 39 


investments since inception (in 2006) and that the “realized track record of 16.7% per annum (net of fees) is superior

the Company overstates the performance of its investment.  But far from contradicting our thesis, this detail 


strengthens it: but of course the returns for realized investments are superior.32  That is precisely why Blue Sky realized 


them.  In other words, in order to boost credibility, we believe that Blue Sky has sold (realized) its successful 


investments while it keeps the failures on its books.   





The result, we believe, is adverse selection in which Blue Sky’s portfolio becomes increasingly dominated by its duds.  


We suspect that Blue Sky sells its good investments to justify its reported returns, while keeping its failed or 


underperforming investments on its books.  As long as such underperforming assets are never realized, Blue Sky is 


free to mark them up over time in order to generate paper profits and fees. 





























                                                           
31 Blue Sky 1H 18 Interim Report  


 
32 Blue Sky claims an AUM for private equity of $975 million but most of the realized private equity investments have been tiny.  For instance, 
Blue Sky’s H1 18 Presentation trumpets “successful exits” of Pet Circle and Hatchtech.  But Blue Sky invested only $4 million and $1 million 


respectively in these businesses.  Investors should be skeptical of Blue Sky’s reported performance as a private equity investor given that so few

BLUE SKY GOUGES AUSTRALIAN INVESTORS WITH EXTORTIONATE FEES 





Alternative asset managers typically charge two fees: a fee tied to the performance of their investments and a 


management fee which is typically a flat percentage on invested capital.  For a long time, fund managers held to the 


traditional 2 and 20 structure: 20% performance fee and a 2% management fee.   





Management fees are ostensibly designed to “keep the lights on” by ensuring that regardless of performance, a fund 


manager can pay for expenses.  Today, only the world’s top fund managers can charge close to 2/20, and even the best 


are fighting a rearguard action to preserve their fees. 





Yet our review of Blue Sky’s fund documents suggest that Blue Sky is a massive outlier because it gouges Australian 


investors with extortionate upfront “management” fees as high as 17%, which we believe is an off-market, abusive 


and unsustainable practice.   





For example, in 2017, Blue Sky announced a $9.9 million follow-on investment in the struggling health food chain, 


Thrive.  Recall that Blue Sky had invested in Thrive in 2015, so it was already intimately familiar with the restaurant 


chain.  Yet for its follow-on investment, Blue Sky charged $1.4 million in upfront fees to investors under the guise of 


various “due diligence” and “M&A advisory” fees.  Blue Sky also deducted management fees for three years, up front.  


On a $9.9 million follow on investment, Blue Sky deducted, upfront, management and establishment fees equal to 


14% the invested capital!

This was obvious to investors only if they read the fine print, as Blue Sky pocketed these establishment and 


transactional fees as the “trustee.”

Blue Sky categorizes such fees as “management fees” for the purposes of its consolidated financial statements, even 


one-off transactional and establishment fees.

Such extortionate fees do not appear to be unusual, but rather standard practice for Blue Sky.  Blue Sky announced 


that it was raising USD $23.7 million for an investment for an Energy Storage Infrastructure Fund to invest in a nascent 


start up called Es-volta. On this investment, Blue Sky’s disclosed that it would charge upfront fees of USD $3.7 


million, 16% of the capital raised!  Included this amount were 5 years of annual management fees, paid upfront, and 


various other establishment, advisory and transactional fees.

Blue Sky will likely object that other asset managers charge such due diligence and advisory fees associated with 


closing a transaction or investment.  This is true, but the key difference is that even for the world’s best asset managers, 


transactional fees (advisory, M&A and due diligence fees) charged by the asset managers are offset against 


management fees.

Based on our review of the industry, transactional fees are deducted from management fees and not double counted.  


Yet Blue Sky layers transactional fees on top of management fees, leading to an extortionate fee structure designed to 


rip off investors regardless of whether the underlying investment succeeds.    





Blue Sky is guarded about sharing its underlying investment documents, probably because it wants to conceal its fee 


structure.  Of the information memorandums we reviewed, we calculate that upfront management fees and related 


“establishment” charges account for an average of 14% of the capital raised by Blue Sky managed funds, suggesting 


this practice is systemic.  





 
Source: Company Filings, Information Memorandums, AFR, Glaucus Calculation 





Such practices are abusive and gouge the very investors Blue Sky claims to serve.  Blue Sky’s fee structure is also 


unconscionable in the context of other asset managers.   





So how does Blue Sky get away with it?  We believe that Blue Sky has historically raised capital from Australian 


retail and “wholesale” investors, many of whom lack the experience to decipher the fine print or the sophistication to 


know they are being ripped off.  





 
Source: Company Filings 





Charging such extortionate upfront fees to relatively unsophisticated investors is not only abusive but unsustainable.  


We believe that Blue Sky was able to get away with it at small capital levels, but that there are simply not enough 


suckers for Blue Sky to continue to charge such fees as it tries to raise larger and larger slugs of capital.  This means 


that even as Blue Sky grows its fee earning AUM, its earnings generated from the capital it raises are likely to struggle 


because the asset manager will be unable to charge such extortionate fees to a larger investor base.  





Indeed, there is already evidence that Blue Sky’s days of charging exorbitant management and establishment fees are 


fast ending.  In its 2017 financials, Blue Sky reported that its management fees dipped to around 1% of its “reported” 


(i.e., what we believe to be an exaggerated figure of fee earning AUM).  No such decline occurred at Blue Sky’s self-


selected peers.

A smart reader of this investment opinion may wonder, if Blue Sky’s management fee was supposedly 1% of AUM 


in 2017, then how can we claim that Blue Sky is charging up to 17% management fees on investments?  The answer, 


in our opinion, is that it only appears to be a 1% management fee because Blue Sky is overstating its fee earning AUM.  


Rather than charging 1% on a large fee earning AUM, we believe Blue Sky is actually charging extortionate fees on 


a much smaller base of invested capital.   





But there is a further wrinkle.  Blue Sky and its promoters ask investors to value its shares on a multiple of what it 


characterizes as “recurring” management fees.  The logic is that such management fees are charged as a flat fee on the 


value of invested capital, thus investors can confidently expect Blue Sky to collect such revenues every year going 


forward until such time as the underlying investments are realized.  But this is not the case.  





To the contrary, we calculate that the bulk of the Company’s reported management fees are comprised of one-off 


establishment fees, which are charged up front at the beginning of the investment and by nature are not recurring. 


Based on the investment memoranda we reviewed, we estimate that one off “establishment” fees (like due diligence 


fees or transactional advisory fees) constitute 81% of the total “management” fees received by Blue Sky in the first 


year of a new investment.   





 
Source: Company Filings, Information Memorandums, AFR, Glaucus Calculation  
This explains why Blue Sky forms so many single asset funds.  As of December 31, 2017, Blue Sky reported 80 


different funds, a 19% increase in just six months.  Blue Sky is heavily incentivized to form a separate vehicle for 


each investment because on each new fund, Blue Sky levies extortionate establishment fees irrespective of quality or 


performance.   





Based on our estimate of Blue Sky’s actual fee earning AUM, we calculate that recurring management fees are at most 


$15 million (1.0% of $1.5 billion), and this is likely far too generous because it gives full credit to Blue Sky’s claimed 


performance.  The larger point is that investors valuing Blue Sky’s shares cannot count on the Company’s management 


fees to be a steady, recurring source of revenues because at least half of such management fees are extortionate, front-

loaded establishment fees charged to unsuspecting investors on new investments.  But evidence indicates Blue Sky is 


running out of suckers, meaning its days of getting away with this fee structure are numbered.

THOSE WHO KNOW BEST, SELL 





Mark Sowerby founded Blue Sky in 2006, and until his abrupt resignation in September 2016, was the managing 


partner and CEO of the Company.  He was also Blue Sky’s largest shareholder until he resigned and cash out a 


significant amount of his shares.  We believe that his departure was the first step in the unraveling of Blue Sky’s 


scheme.   





Sowerby decided to abruptly sell 47% of his shares in a year before resigning in September 2016.

We believe that as AUM grows, Blue Sky’s overstatement of its fee earning assets gets bigger and bigger.  We expect 


that this scheme will soon collapse, so it is a significant red flag that Sowerby abruptly resigned in September 2016 


and had sold 47% of his entire holdings that year, pocketing $35 million.  To us, the timing is no coincidence.

As the founder and CEO, Sowerby was best placed to know the true value of Blue Sky. We believe that if Sowerby 


had confidence in the Company, he would not have exited such a large block position so quickly.  But given what we 


have uncovered in analyzing the Company’s disclosures, in our opinion, Sowerby was selling out before the collapse 


of Blue Sky’s share price.

VALUATION 





Publicly traded asset managers are typically valued on a percentage of their fee earning AUM.  The larger the fee 


earning AUM, the larger the revenue stream and the higher the valuation for the asset manager’s shares. 





Illiquid and unrealized investments are, by nature, difficult to value and therefore, much trust is placed in asset 


managers to value such assets in good faith.  We believe Blue Sky abuses this privilege.  Even at its reported fee 


earning AUM, Blue Sky’s shares are expensive, as the Company trades on a premium to even the best publicly traded 


alternative asset managers. 
 


 
Source: Bloomberg, calculated as of March 27, 2018. 





Blue Sky’s shares are already valued at a premium to blue chip asset managers such as Blackstone, Apollo, Ares and 


Carlyle.  Blue Sky has nowhere near the skill, reputation or resources of such top-flight asset managers, so even on its 


reported AUM, we would expect its share price to decline from reversion to the median multiple of EV to reported 


fee earning AUM.   





But as we discuss extensively in our report, we believe that Blue Sky has materially exaggerated its reported fee 


earning AUM in order to attract capital and boost its share price.  Blue Sky’s reported fee earning AUM has supposedly 


grown by 2,000% since IPO.  During that period, its enterprise value has increased a staggering 4,027%.    





 
Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg 





Indeed, Blue Sky’s brokers even identify AUM growth as the primary catalyst for the asset manager’s rapidly 


appreciating share price.  Morgans’ November 2017 note was titled “Institutional AUM lifting off,” and its February 


2018 follow-on note was titled “Long runway for AUM growth.”   





Based on our review of the publicly available information regarding Blue Sky’s investments, which includes an 


exhaustive sum-of-the-parts analysis of the assets in its portfolio, we believe that Blue Sky’s maximum fee earning 


AUM is likely no more than $1.48 billion, which is 62% below the $3.9 billion fee earning AUM figure reported by 


the Company.

Yet we believe that even this analysis is likely far too generous.  We suspect much of the capital invested by Blue Sky 


has been squandered in extortionate one off “management fees,” charged up front to investors.  There is also evidence 


to support our investment thesis that Blue Sky has significantly overstated the performance of its investments. For 


these reasons, we suspect that Blue Sky’s true fee earning AUM is much smaller than even our maximum estimate.   





It is important to note that we are playing the role of financial detective, reconstructing Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM 


from the limited disclosures by the Company about the exact composition of its AUM and the performance of its 


investments.  We suspect that Blue Sky is cagey and opaque about its assets and performance because it wants to 


avoid scrutiny of its investments.   





For simplicity, we value Blue Sky’s shares on a multiple of enterprise value to our estimate of its maximum fee earning 


AUM of $1.5 billion.  In addition, we think that Blue Sky should trade at a discount to the multiple for blue chip asset 


managers because of the multitude of corporate governance concerns identified in our analysis. 





 
Source: Glaucus Calculation 





Our valuation implies a market capitalization of $343 million and a Glaucus adjusted share price of $2.66, 77% 


below the current share price of $11.43.  That said, we believe that this valuation is likely far too generous to the 


Company because it gives full credit to Blue Sky’s reported performance on its portfolio, which we suspect is 


inappropriately exaggerated.  We therefore think it would be reasonable for investors to value Blue Sky’s shares even 


lower.  Where the bottom is, perhaps not even Blue Sky knows.
