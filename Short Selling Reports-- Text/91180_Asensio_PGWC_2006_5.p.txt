PGWC’s Links To The


“Corporate Scandal Of The


Century.”


On January 16, 2006 Pegasus Wireless Corporation


(NASDAQ: PGWC, $7.09) completed the acquisitions of


partial interests in three tiny and seemingly unrelated


companies. One of the companies was incorporated in the


Cayman Islands but headquartered in Taiwan, another was a


Taiwanese company, and the third California based but


headed by a Chief Executive O�cer (“CEO”) of Taiwanese


origin.


The Taiwanese connection continues with PGWC’s


involvement with a Taiwanese national who stands accused


of using over 100 bogus companies to embezzle in excess of


$525 million from three di�erent companies and who is a


director of one of Pegasus’ major shareholders. The


shareholding company is the same company that owns an


interest in a Pegasus subsidiary, and which had dealings with


PGWC’s President and newly announced Co-CEO, Jasper


Knabb, since at least 2001. Mr. Knabb has seen legal and


�nancial controversies of his own.


According to Securities and Exchange Commission �lings,


Vision 2000 Ventures, Ltd (“Vision”) owns approximately 13%


of PGWC. Vision is a Taiwanese based corporation also

incorporated in the Cayman Islands whose director is


Taiwanese citizen Hung Chiu-Hu.


Mr. Hu was arrested on May 18, 2005 for his involvement in


what is notoriously referred to by the Taiwanese press as the


“corporate scandal of the century.”


Mr. Hu was arrested, along with two co-conspirators, in


connection with the embezzlement of over $456 million from


the Taiwan-based Paci�c Electric Wire and Cable, Co. Ltd


(“Paci�c Electric”).


Mr. Hu is accused of embezzling the funds during his tenure


as Director of Finance of Paci�c Electric.


Mr. Hu stands accused of setting up 146 dummy


corporations and taking out loans in their names, for which


Paci�c Electric acted as the guarantor. The dummy


corporations defaulted on the loans and Paci�c Electric


shouldered the debt.


According to the Taipei Times, during the investigation of the


Paci�c Electric, investigators also found evidence that Mr. Hu


had embezzled in excess of $68 million from two more


Taiwanese companies where he had served as a board


member.


As of July, 2005 Mr. Hu was awaiting trial and prosecutors


were seeking a 20 plus year jail term.


The ties between Mr. Hu and Mr. Knabb existed prior to


Vision acquiring shares of PGWC. Mr. Knabb’s dealings with


Mr. Hu goes back at least to 2001, when both were involved


in OTC Wireless (“OTC”).


Vision’s PGWC stock holding resulted from Pegasus’


acquisition of OTC in November, 2004. Mr. Knabb served as


OTC’s Managing Director from 2001-2002.
