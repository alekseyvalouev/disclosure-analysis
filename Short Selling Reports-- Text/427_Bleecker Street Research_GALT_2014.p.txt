Galectin Therapeutics: Why This Penny Stock Dressed Up By Stock
Promoters Is A Short
Jul. 28, 2014 10:32 AM ET60 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


GALT has strong ties to multiple stock promoters.


Insiders have been selling the stock in the midst of a campaign to promote the stock
to retail investors and retirees.


Since becoming GALT in 2011, GALT has never spent more on R&D than on G&A.

Galectin Therapeutics is a development stage biotechnology company that is developing
drugs for fibrotic diseases and cancer. From the GALT website:


Galectin Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on discovery and
development. We apply our leadership in galectin science and drug development to
create new therapies for fibrotic disease and cancer. Drug candidates based on our
unique carbohydrate technology target galectin proteins, which are key mediators of
biologic and pathologic function.


GALT has strong ties to well known stock promoters, and has been paying for campaigns
targeting retail investors and retirees. GALT has been paying for these campaigns and
has done significant capital raises on the back of these promotions. Since these
promotions have begun, GALT's stock has more than doubled and volume has exploded.
But first, some history.


The History of What Is Now Galectin Therapeutics


What is now Galectin Therapeutics was founded in 2000 as Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Adam Feurstein provided some color in his Biotech Mailbag on Pro-Pharmaceuticals all
the way back in 2010. While one shouldn't hold what happened to Pro-Pharmaceuticals
against GALT, it does provide some interesting context. GALT's story begins on May 26,
2011, when Pro-Pharmaceuticals changed its name to "Galectin Therapeutics." That's
when the current GALT story began.


The Promoters Enter The Scene

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2347785-galectin-therapeutics-why-this-penny-stock-dressed-up-by-stock-promoters-is-a-short 3/20


From the time of the name change up until TDM Financial began getting paid to promote
the stock, GALT was a sub $5 stock that traded sparsely. The promotion worked, as
GALT's stock has nearly tripled since TDM Financial began targeting retail investors and
retirees. Since the promotion began GALT has used the strength in its stock to do a $100
million offering which included a 500,000 share sell from Richard Uhilein. How do we
know GALT is targeting retail investors and retirees? TDM Financial has provided a "case
study" on its website of the GALT promotional campaign complete with a quote from
GALT's chairman.


The stock has gone up partially on the back of numerous press releases such as this one,
which have been written by Emerging Growth Corp.


TDM Financial said GALT hired them to:


"Galectin Therapeutics Inc. engaged TDM Financial on July 12, 2013 to broaden and
enhance their shareholder base, as well as reach an audience of sophisticated
individual and institutional investors, through a combination of dedicated list
mailings, targeted content syndication, and other forms of measurable and effective
outreach."


Under the "Audiences Targeted" section of the report, TDM Financial says that they are
targeting retail investors and retirees.

TDM Financial goes on to boast that its campaign increased the price of the stock and its
visibility.


The promotion has continued to work, if one measures the success of a promoter by an
increasing stock price. This is clearly being done by retail investors buying into the
constant flow of positive press releases.


Indeed GALT has continued to steadily pay TDM Financial for its services, having paid
$35,00 since the beginning of the promotion.

So how do we know Emerging Growth Corp is also TDM Financial? Well it's pretty easy. It
all goes back to one Daniel Minton of Whitefish, Montana. Daniel Milton's LinkedIn page
shows that he is the owner of TDM Financial.

Using the State of Montana's LLC search to search for "Emerging Growth Corp." one sees
that Daniel Milton is listed as the registered agent for this entity. An interesting note, while
Emerging Growth Corp. has been promoting stocks for well over a year now, the LLC was
only two months ago.

If you're still not satisfied that TDM Financial is Emerging Growth Corp, going to
emerginggrowthcorp.com should settle it for you. Going to that web address takes you to
TDM Financial's website.


Who Else Has Emerging Growth Corp. Promoted?


You can see the full list of stocks that Emerging Growth Corp (a/k/a Daniel Milton) here.
As you can see it is a list mainly comprised of penny stocks. Just in the last month Mr.
Milton has promoted these stocks through his Emerging Growth Corp.

As you can see, most of these are truly penny stocks with microscopic market caps. Can
you spot the outlier? (It's GALT). So why is GALT using a penny stock promoter for
"marketing services"?


Another Penny Stock Promoter Has Been Involved


Having connections to one stock promoter is bad enough, but GALT has ties to another
stock promoter. This time the stock promoter is Patrick Cox, who also promoted PVCT
right before the stock plunged 90%. Patrick Cox has promoted numerous biotechs, here is
an interview in which he touts several biotechs including GALT. As BuyersStrike points
out, Patrick Cox has colorful background. This is Patrick Cox. This is Patrick Cox calling
GALT a company that will "change the world." Here is a picture of Patrick Cox.


Who Owns The Stock? (Hint - The promotion has worked)

The promotion has targeted retail investors and retirees, among others. And that's
basically who owns the stock. Institutional ownership is very low and insiders have been
selling stock.


Institutional ownership is just 16% of the float.

Insiders Selling The Stock


Over the last twelve months there have been a total of 17 insider buys in the open market,
while there have been 16 insider sales in the open market. While that doesn't sound too
bad, according to NASDAQ, insiders have bought less than 15,000 shares while they
have sold 700,000 shares in the last twelve months.

GALT R&D Spend vs. General & Administrative Spending


Since the name change to Galectin in 2011, GALT has never spent more on R&D than it
has on General & Administrative (G&A).


If you look at other biotechs in similar positions they are spending substantially more on
R&D than they are on G&A. For example, Sarepta (NASDAQ:SRPT) spends around $2 in
R&D for every $1 it spends on G&A.


Tuesday's Announcement


On Tuesday, July 29th the company will announce the findings from its Cohort 2 of Phase
1 in the Clinical Trial of GALT's main drug, GR-MD-02. This cohort will be dosed with twice
the level of Cohort 1. Only 8 patients are in this Cohort. If the data is positive the stock will
likely go up, if negative it will go down. This article is not attempting to forecast the results
of an 8 person Cohort in a Phase 1 trial, but rather to examine the background of those
involved with GALT.


Summary


They say you judge the character of a person by those with whom they associate. If that
holds true with corporations, then GALT has been associating with penny stock promoters
that have pushed all sorts of subpar companies on retail investors and retirees. Perhaps

GALT is showing its true colors by associating with these types of people. Time will tell.


Note: I have contacted GALT IR about their connection with Emerging Growth Corp and
TDM Financial but have not heard back. If I do hear back I will update this article if
necessary. I am long put options on GALT, however I am not short the stock.

Nothing in here about the science and whether or not you have anything intelligent to add on that front. Why not wait
to see what the data suggests? I see the Baker Bros. been accumulating the stock, now one of the largest holders. I
find their purchasing more instructive than your analysis. The only suspect thing here is the timing of your short raid
IMO.

Agree - no reference to any of the scientific results. Also, in Galt Price/Volume image displayed, author conveniently
neglected to point out that the spike up in price/volume occurred at the same time as two Analysts initiated coverage
on Galt with a Buy rating.

conflict of interest there either.

And the other company??? I'm sure you can come up with a biased reason for them initiating and rating Galt
as a Buy.

Let's take a poll, who do SA readers despise more: 
A) paid stock promoters who don't shave or wear $1500 suits; 
or 
B) short hacks who make personal attacks with zero relevance to the business' prospects or technology.


"Like" for B, 
"Reply" with a personal attack for A  
(disclosure - I don't shave or own even a $150 suit)


28 Jul 2014, 11:19 AM


ilanfl
The stock promotion is the problem, not the suit (though it seems to help, see my comment below :)).


A paid stock promotion does have relevance to the business' prospects, because serious companies seem to
never engage in it.


Also, if the stock promotion is paid for, but that is not disclosed, I believe it is illegal?

All the companies that pay for a press release via accesswire post that they pay for the Press Release. They
don't hide it! They even show you the amount that is paid! All companies that are public pay for promotion
unless they hide it, it is not illegal. yet I wonder why all these bearish articles pass it off as being illegal when it
isn't.

These articles pass it off as being shady, not illegal. You can have a company that is extremely shady with
okay early-stage clinical products that you can be bearish on as they have no significant revenue chances
any time soon and will not be bought by big pharma given how sketchy the company is. I thought it was a
very well-written article....thanks to the author!

I guess it does not matter that the insider sales referred to in the article were to allow those "insiders" to exercise
warrants that resulted in said "insiders" actually INCREASING their GALT share count. Nasdaq apparently does not
recognize exercised warrants as a "buy". Thanks to Biotech2010 for reminding me of this fact.


From Biotech2010 on iHub... 
"10X Fund sold shares and then exercised options at lower cost in an almost equal dollar amount-the net result is that
insiders owned more shares, not less plus almost $3M in working capital went into the company."

If you're a small development stage company, how else are you to get yourself noticed? PR companies are paid to
draw attention to you, it's up to the potential investors to do their own DD. Regarding the PR I've seen from EGC, it
really doesn't say anything more than what the PR's we've gotten from the company, just phrased in a different way
and, as would be expected, a suggestion that it is worth looking at for an investment. Who doesn't use PR? Do you go
to a ball park and not see soft drink, beer and other logo's? Unless all you watch are paid movie channels then you
see major corporations promoting their product all the time, yes even large pharmaceuticals, Cialis anyone??


To hire a PR firm is not, in and of itself, bad, if it's misleading that's another story and so far I've not seen the PR from
this firm to be misleading in regards to GALT. I've done my DD & am waiting to hear the results from the 2nd cohort
tomorrow.

Who are you supposed to target? Institutional investors don't pay attention to these PR's, they have their own

The author states that GALT hired Patrick Cox to promote the company. I don't know any company who does NOT
promote, advertise or otherwise endorse their company. They hire "experts", actors, celebrities and lobbyists to further
their profits. Maybe Mr. Cox has seen the science. Maybe you haven't.

(EDITED) This article ignores - fully - the science of the business, and in this case that the drug being researched has
been fast tracked by the FDA (no small thing), and executes attacks on the company's attempts to promote the
product. Looking at the data sets already available, it would seem that a wise investor would be looking at the product
(the FDA sure has) rather than the manner in which promotion of the company has been executed.

Science seems quite solid. However, that doesn't change the fact that the stock price has risen a bit too fast
considering the competition in the space.

I have just reviewed all the documents at Edgar and find that the Insiders are not selling stock other than small
amounts periodically; for instance, Dr. Taber has as of the last filing (2014-1-24) 134,000 shares; and, James Czirr
(chairman) has as of his last filing (2014-1-29) 2,309,519 shares. The remainder of insiders have not been selling but
have been accumulating. I find that these short-sellers/Put-Buyers seem to publish these negative articles at very
opportune moments in time and it would appear that those who are writing these articles may very well be doing so
for their own purposes. What I continually do not understand is that these types of miss-leading articles are published
without the publisher first verifying that the information is correct.

I wonder if GALT Investor Relations will release a press statement clarifying the issue - companies typically do.

I've done a bit of due diligence on this stock and have decided I'd rather trust the legitimacy of this research based on
articles written by gastroenterologists and hepatologists than the seemingly self serving interests of anonymous
bloggers. Tomorrow will be interesting for certain.

Good luck everybody. I must admit to having made a quick small profit on this co. and then sold. Its not something
that I really support because these pharmacy development companies have become little more than financial drivers
for corporate Wall St. hedge fund managers. They use investment capital to finance investment plans, and that is the
priority. The research which may/may not be good, is secondary to that, and when the life saving drugs are developed
they make them unaffordable. They charge enough for them to impact financial security for anyone who needs them,
raising health care costs for everybody and bankrupt important entitlement programs that are safeguards for the poor.


Its not a good system and it should be changed.

Decided to listen to the broadcast. The doctor seems intent on showing that they learned something but in this case
the results may just be too boring for an environment like Wall St. --Investors may not want to try to understand
complex, boring, systematic, or methodical. They want sensational, something to move stock... welp.. that's not
medical research.


That's why these co's are such a bad risk for investors seeking to profit from volatility in a good way. Too much risk.

"... seeking to profit from volatility in a good way" ... 
couldn't that be rephrased as "Seeking Alpha"

just a big free for all. someone buys puts---but "I am not short GALT" Really??? so maybe this author does not
understand what a put is. A put is a short position, betting that the stock will go down in price. A put is an option to sell
the stock at a high price and then buy the stock at a lower price in the future. And then the author, who is not
short(haha)writes an article we are supposed believe. Interesting. Too bad the SEC cannot watch all of the circuses in
this market. This author must be incredibly uninformed.

Author’s reply »  Being long a put is not the same as being short a stock. They have different r/r profiles. I
understand what a put is. I rarely short the stock of biotechs, if I am bearish I believe it is much safer to buy
puts (as your downside is capped). Thanks for reading.

Pretty amazing how coordinated shorts can use predicted headline news to help them short a stock for tremendous
profits in a day. They are "our" profits, PLUG power's profits, but this once illegal tactic continues to slam average
people down whenever they get up again. But this was a huge fall, much more than I thought it would be. GALT is at
6.50 as of this post.

The fall is because of their webcast from this morning, not because of this article.

Yesterday this article made the price fall slightly, but it's nothing compared to today's move.

Author’s reply »  This article did not cause today's 55% drop. Read this, this is why the stock is down so
much today.

RXII and GALE both have a long history of using stock promoters. Scumbag behavior, if you ask me.

Look at their 5-year charts, spot the price spikes, then you tell me.

Hmm. Lawsuit announced today re Galt's informational process to share holders and others. Could be a bad day.


Sold my shares at reasonably good profit a few days back when it was up. Thankful to be out.

the past few days over 15 million shares of Galt changed hands at the $5 to $6 range. thats almost 3/4s of its
outstanding shares. Some people whoever they are, think that galt is a good value at this price to the tune of $75
million dollars on a market cap of $121 million. It also seems like a pretty strong support level. My disclosure, I was
lucky, I bought a 3 and sold at 14. I am seriously considering buying again. The company is well financed with over 36
million cash. Though I am worried about that giant sucking sound caused by defending against spurious legal attacks.

Confession: I am "Alex M", Adam Feuerstein's correspondent in that 2010 article of his. It's disappointing to see that
this is one leopard that hasn't changed its rather sleazy spots. Thanks for the great analysis of the current
shenanigans of GALT's hired stock pushers - in that respect it's identical to its predecessor, PRWP.

This is an old article, but it would be interesting to know whether the jump over the past week (since 9/20/2016) in
price of $GALT and then subsequent fall today after hours (9/27/2016) has any promotional component to it.


Obviously the run up was to some extent the excitement of people seeing how $TBRA gained a 700% premium on
being bought by $AGN, and the drop is related to this news about GALT's mid-stage study: http://seekingalpha.co...


Was the huge drop solely a reaction to that, or was it perhaps aided by any promotions of the sort described in this
article?
