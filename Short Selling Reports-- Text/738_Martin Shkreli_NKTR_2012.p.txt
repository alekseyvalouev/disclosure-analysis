Nektar Phase III Trials At Risk
Jun. 18, 2012 12:58 PM ET13 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Shorting Nektar (NASDAQ:NKTR) is a good investment. There are material deficiencies
with lead asset NKTR-118, which I believe will result in the failure of this drug to achieve
Phase III clinical trial primary endpoints. In the absence of positive results for NKTR-118,
Nektar is worth very little (~$1 per share). Even if NKTR-118 succeeds, I don't think NKTR
stock is worth $8 per share.


NKTR-118 is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist constipation drug with seemingly positive
phase 2 data in opioid-induced constipation ("OIC"). Phase 3 results will be reported in Q4
2012 and this is a significant binary event for the company. I believe these phase 3 studies
will fail. The reason for this is the unreliability of mu-opioid antagonists in eliciting a robust
anti-constipation duration of effect in clinical trials. ALKS 37, Entereg, CB-5945 and PTI-
901, all opioid antagonists, have failed to show a durable effect in long-term studies of
constipation. All of these drugs show good short-term effects on constipation, but no drug
has a long duration of action. Some of these drugs are FDA approved and to gain any
share, NKTR-118 needs to show long-term (12 week) alleviation of opioid induced
constipation. The one drug in this class to show a robust long-term response is oral
methylnaltrexone (Relistor). This drug will likely be FDA approved this year, and Nektar
and AstraZeneca will be playing "catch-up." The lack of efficacy at the low dose of the
Relistor study illustrates that constipation studies, in general, are difficult to achieve
success with. It will be hard for NKTR-118 to differentiate from Relistor, if it succeeds in
the forthcoming pivotal trials.


The phase 2 results of NKTR-118 show a doubling in increased bowel movements at the
target dose at 1 week. It is very important to note the primary endpoint is at just one
week of therapy (there is some confusion that this was a four week endpoint). The
clinical effect is small, with only one and a half increased bowel movements per week
versus placebo. Indeed, this improvement is smaller than that seen with ALKS 37. Recall
that ALKS 37, despite initial great short-term data, failed to replicate this effect in a longer
study. Remember, these drugs are very similar, and the ALKS 37 experience illustrates
why it is hard to trust replicating and extending initial OIC data with a mu-opioid receptor
antagonist. At lower doses, NKTR-118 doesn't work well, and at only moderately higher
doses is it too toxic (see the SAE). Finally, I'm not sure the improvement in bowel
movements seen with NKTR-118 is clinically meaningful.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/666541-nektar-phase-iii-trials-at-risk 2/9


Constipation trials are very hard to run as the effect size of any drug is usually small with
large variability in results. There are numerous other agents and non-medicinal
physiological procedures patients can try during the study, even if they're encouraged not
to. Psychological and physiological resistance and acclimation also occurs in these trials,
especially if they are done over longer periods of time (1 week versus 12 weeks). Patient
adherence and self-reporting is yet another clinical trial issue. The primary endpoint of the
NKTR-118 trial is over 12 weeks (3 months). Nektar and its partner AstraZeneca are
running just two Phase III trials to win approval of NKTR-118. The FDA requires two
successful Phase III trials to grant approval.


Even if NKTR-118 works over 12 weeks, there are several other mu-opioid antagonists,
including Relistor, CB-5945 and Entereg it will have to compete with. Using an 11%
discount rate (quite generous given the operational hurdles), a 100% chance of success
(no discount for failure), a $700 million peak sales estimate, a 21% no-cost royalty, no
other costs whatsoever, the full value of filing and approval milestones, a patent expiry in
2026, 5% return on cash and full value for cash on hand now, I get a stock price very
close to the current stock price ($8.22). Why would one go long a stock that is pricing in
perfection? If anything at all happens to these projections, such as a competitor entrance,
failure to achieve peak sales, failure to achieve clinical success, failure to persuade FDA
of clinical significance, failure of IP, failure to reinvest funds properly, etc, the investment
can be lost.


A bull might argue that $700 million is conservative for this product. That is impossible
given the variety of other mu-opioid receptor antagonists there are. If approved, this drug
would sell a lot less than $700 million, if the results are good at all, and if the FDA believes
those results are worth approving. The FDA has been changing its mind quite a bit when it
comes to constipation. Keep in mind no company has cracked the constipation market
with a large product thus far. The Takeda/Sucampo product Amitiza is a relatively minor
product with only ~$200 million in sales. Zelnorm was a $600 million product before it was
withdrawn from the market and Lotronex sales are tiny. Entereg and Relistor sales are
microscopic. Increasing spontaneous bowel movements is a reasonable endpoint for this
disease but I question the medical significance of one more successful bowel movement
than placebo in a one week period. With at least 3 look-a-likes, it is practically impossible
for NKTR-118 to be worth $8 per share, and is probably worth $1-$2 per share in present
value.

I don't value Nektar's next most highly valued product, a pegylated irinotecan called
NKTR-102, very highly at all. In fact, I think the NPV of this project is negative. Cancer
companies have abandoned developing new chemotherapies. Ask Bristol, Merck and
Roche if they're interested in licensing NKTR-102. They'll stick with their PD1, MET and
other exciting new targeted cancer drugs. Nektar is nevertheless running the Phase III
"BEACON" study in almost one thousand breast cancer patients. This trial will take a long
time to enroll and a long time to report results.


There is precious little evidence to handicap the results of this hail-mary Phase III. The
company has some uncontrolled response rate data that seem encouraging, but with
expectations moving so quickly with drugs like Perjeta receiving approval, it's hard to know
what is good in breast cancer anymore, especially without randomized studies. I'm not a
big believer in trying to predict OS data with uncontrolled response rates and single-arm
survival.


Enzon has a very similar drug which the market is not giving it much value for. So I'm not
sure we should do the same for NKTR. Of course, Nektar is spending an enormous
amount of money on NKTR-102, which really drains from any value one might assign to
NKTR-118. Nektar has routinely made missteps with NKTR-102. First, the company had
us expecting a partnership for the product, which hasn't materialized. Next, the company
suggested it could receive FDA approval in non-randomized ovarian cancer results, which
is absurd. These false starts make me wonder if Nektar really knows what it is doing in
cancer.


BAY855 is a pegylated hemophilia product being developed by Baxter with a royalty to
Nektar. There is no clinical data I'm aware of for this compound and a ton of other
companies are developing long-acting Factor 8 products. I suspect Biogen and others
would have something to say if I valued this any more than nominally.


NKTR-061 is an inhaled antibiotic with minor sales potential being developed in
collaboration with Bayer. It is unclear if this product is being pursued any longer after a
very public set of issues. I don't value it as the sales potential of the product and it's
current inactive state give me pause.


I don't value the rest of Nektar's preclinical pipeline which leaves us with their two Phase I
pain projects. These aren't worth anything to be either. Trying to perfect pain drugs is a
Sisyphean task. They are about as close to perfect as you're going to get in
pharmaceuticals. Marginal improvements do not create value in the drug business (see
tapentadol).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/666541-nektar-phase-iii-trials-at-risk 4/9


Nektar has a strange setup. The company has 423 employees, which seems about two- to
three-times as many necessary for what it does. The stock price hasn't moved in 5 years
and the CEO makes several million dollars per year, a lot of it in cash. Most importantly,
the entire company had $113 million of negative cash flow in 2011, and they seem to be
on a path to exceed even that in 2012. This greatly reduces any NPV of NKTR-118, to a
point where even in a best-case-scenario that drug goes from being worth $8 to perhaps
as little as $6. I don't like buying stocks where the most I can make is -$2 per share. The
opposite holds true, I love shorting stocks where no matter how well the company's assets
perform, the stock drops $2 due to the company's mismanagement of expenses and
funding of low-impact projects and the implied 100% probability of success of the stock
market.


As you might imagine, I am short Nektar stock and I suspect it will fall 80% when one of
the NKTR-118 Phase III trials fails. If the trial works, the significant competition and small
market size will result in the stock falling 50%-80% anyway.

Disclosure: I am short NKTR.


Author's note: I have removed the reference to the Litman et al. paper which I incorrectly
misinterpreted. Thank you to a shareholder of NKTR for pointing this out. I misread this
paper and apologize for any confusion that may have resulted. My thesis, is however,
unchanged.


Additional disclosure: I may change my mind.

"How can NKTR-118 do what the other mu antagonists can't do?"


From my little understanding, is not NKTR-118 some commonly used drug which neutralizes the opioid. Therefore,
since opioid is neutralized, you have no opioid constipation. Genius. Do the other existing drugs do that?


Anyway, you seem to have pushed down NKTR with your article. Congrats. Obviously, you needed some relief since
NKTR was approaching a new 52-week high.

Just read the abstract of the three month Methylnaltrexone study. Methylnaltrexone didn't seem to lose effectiveness,
instead there was an incredible placebo effect that occurs starting at one month. How do the authors explain that?


At the Phase I dose, ALKS-37 had much higher rate of diarrhea than any of the other drugs in the category. ALKS
didin't explain why it discontinued development, whether it was efficacy or side effects.

>>>"A careful reading of the Lipman publication reveals that the difference between drug and placebo of the
peripheral mu-opioid antagonist Relistor narrows drastically after just 1 month. At the end of the second
month of therapy in that study, the difference between drug and placebo is inverted: placebo works better
than drug! It's clear to me that this class of medicine's effect is tolerated quickly."


-- I would like to withdraw my previous comment about the Utah Methylnaltrexone study. The truth is that *all
patients* received Methylnaltrexone open label after the initial DB period. The study clearly demonstrates that
Methylnaltrexone maintains its efficacy over a three month period, in fact efficacy appears to increase.

Precisely the opposite of your conclusion, Mr. Shkreli. Careful reading my foot, you completely misinterpreted
the results!


Here's another, three month results... "The response rate remained consistent throughout the extension trial."

There are more out there. Care to revisit your so-called research?

Mr. Shkreli, I see you withdrew your "huh?" comment, but I'll respond anyway.


I will put it in plain English. In the University of Utah study, patients were double blinded to receive either
Methylnaltrexone or placebo. Efficacy was 45.3% for Methylnaltrexone and 10.8% for placebo. After the initial
study point, *all patients* received Methylnaltrexone for a period of three months. Efficacy for the patients who
received Methylnaltrexone for the entire study was 45.5%, 57.7%, and 57.3% at the one, two and three month
evaluations. Efficacy of Methylnaltrexone on those patients who received placebo at the start was 48.3%,
47.6%, and 52.1% at the one, two and three month evaluations. Virtually identical. How in the world can you
possibly claim that the drug is tolerated quickly? In fact, you can make a case that Methylnaltrexone becomes
more effective over time.


Here is a good summary. "Methylnaltrexone is well tolerated and remained effective in randomized controlled
trials of up to 16 weeks."

In general I like your opinion pieces and agree on BMRN buyout being real this time. My guess is Shire is the likely
acquirer and they do it BEFORE GALNS data. I think they do it like the TKT deal and can back out with a (relatively)
small fee with data out before it closes or a CVR. Even if the Phase 3 were to fail BMRN has enough studies going
and ERT's have enough history that I think they eventual would get it approved. Pompe and PARP data may be what
determines the premium.


Now on to NKTR aside from your (IMO) satire at the valuation you missed some things. 
1-What about the pain drugs? Those are in the clinic. 
2-I don't disagree completely on 102 Robin should have partnered. I think your negative valuation is a bit of an
exaggeration. 
3-Robin's salary is certainly nothing to sneeze at. But give him credit for being able to do lucrative deals both with

4-I figure in your valuation you write off their current royalties and net cash position since they are a typical bio that
burns money... I tend to think they are worth > $1 a share :-).


You seem to base the majority of your valuation on 118. I would agree on some risk and AZ is testing a dose not
tested before (to my knowledge) but here are couple things readers should be aware of that I didn't see you mention: 
1- From the Phase 2 PR "The increase in SBMs versus placebo was maintained over the 28-day treatment period (p
<0.01)." 
2-It sounds like you are saying all the drugs are the same and its crowded yet 118 won't work?

Like I said, NKTR-118 is a commonly used drug, naloxol, so it probably works. In fact, Relistor is also a form of
naloxol. The difference is Nektar's pegylation. That is the genius part.


The pegylation of naloxol neutralizes opioid in the gut, but does not neutralize opioid effect. So the goal is to combine
NKTR-118 with opioids to form product NKTR-119. Blockbuster?

I am a private investor long NKTR at 7.65, with a long history of success investing in the biotech and commodity
sectors over 25 years. Mr.Shkreli's comment that " If the trial works, the significant competition and small market size
will result in the stock falling 50%-80% anyway" is so ludicrous that it discredits the rest of his analysis. Successful
Phase III trials of NKTR-118 are likely to lead to a buy-out of NKTR by AZN or the likes. Please note the deal terms
publicly available on the agreement between AZN and NKTR with particular attention to the large payments due from
AZN. It would be more economical for AZN to simply buy NKTR. Further, how can Mr. Shkreli presume to say that 1.5
additional bowel movements per week is not significant for a seriously ill person with an ileus!? I am extremely excited
about the prospects for NKTR 181 for chronic pain syndrome, which just got fast-track treatment from the FDA. 
Why does Mr. Shkreli ignore this when pain medication makes up a huge proportion of the total worldwide spend for
medication??? And what about the ovarian cancer drug NKTR-102? Finally, Mr. Shkreli's timing of his article is perfect
because it coincides with a recent runup in NKTR shares which have been building toward a massive short squeeze.
Mr. Shkreli neglected to mention the huge size of the short interest in NKTR and the fact that he and his cronies have
been squirming with discomfort at the impending breakout. Perhaps they are assuming that they will be able to cover

ALKS 37 molecule is a secret so how can you say it is VERY similiar to NKTR-118, or any other drug? Alkermes

NKTR-118 dosages being tested are 5mg, 25mg, 50mg. Dosages up to 1000mg were tested in phase 1 and were
safe. You are trying to scare people with the word toxic. Why do not you just write severe adverse events?

Entereg is hospital use only and has a maximum of 15 doses. Relistor is subcutaneous. People do not like needles.

There are 4 or 5 phase 3 trials involving NKTR-118 listed at ClinicalTrials. Anyway, so if the drug test only last 12
weeks and clinical trial last over a year, would not AstraZeneca see that NKTR-118 is working or is not working from
data collected from 2011. It would be pretty stupid to continue the clinical trial if drug did not work after examining
interim data. So given phase 3 clinical trials are almost to completion, the drug is probably meeting primary end-point.
