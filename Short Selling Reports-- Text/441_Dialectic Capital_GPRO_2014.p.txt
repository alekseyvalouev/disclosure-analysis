The enthusiasm in GoPro stock is unwarranted and deserves to be
shorted, Dialectic Capital's John Fichthorn said Wednesday.


"It's a company that is trading at a high multiple for what it is, which is
something that we often look for," he said. "GoPro pitches itself as a ...
almost a media company, which has helped it garner this amazing
multiple relative to the fact that it is just a consumer electronics camera
company.


"It's funny, on their website they say they're a versatile camera
company, but you can't find the word 'camera' in their SEC filings."

On CNBC's "Halftime Report," Fichthrorn, who is short GoPro stock,
said that the "adrenaline-junkie camera market" is a small one. GoPro
cameras have gained a following among extreme sports aficionados,


"It's 10 million devices, and they already have 80 percent share," he
said. "You know, Apple invented the tablet, and it's gone from 100
percent share to 30. GoPro is not going to be able to hold on to this
incredibly high percentage that it's got today."


Fichthorn said that the camera-maker's product line is already
competing with "things like your basic smartphone that already has
[high-definition 1080 pixel camera], that you can stick in a plastic case
and get wide-angle viewing and attach it to a stick, and it's basically a
GoPro."


He said that it was a question of whether GoPro was going to lose
market share to other companies.


"It's a hypercompetitive, low-margin business in the camera business,
as opposed to the media business," Fichthorn said.
