EYE


National Vision is the product of several bankrupt companies being funded by
Private Equity firms and then floated on the public markets.


Those players (KKR and Berkshire Partners) have stepped off the BOD and/or sold
their shares.


The company has a Free Cash Flow Yield similar to the US 10 year and is priced at
a 60% premium to the S&P 500 on that metric.


The "Signature Offer" of "Two glasses and a Free Eye Exam for $69.99" looks too
good to be true and may run afoul of FTC "bait and Switch" rules.

National Vision (NASDAQ:EYE) trades at 16.6x 2019 EV/EBITDA, has ~3 turns of debt
and generates a paltry 1.5% FCF yield that could see pressure as consumers (and
possibly regulators) increase scrutiny of the company’s potentially deceptive ads – ads
that are integral to the company’s ability to drive customers to its stores. In addition to its
reputational risk, in my opinion, EYE is overstating EBITDA by double-digit percentages
via add-backs and accounting gimmickry.


To their credit EYE has warned the Street (see the Managed Care and Insurance
section) that the growth of its managed care business is expected to slow as it continues
to approach overall industry penetration levels. Despite the fact companies in this
industry have a history of failure due to over-expansion (here, here, and here), EYE
plans to open 75 stores per year and more than double its store base. Importantly the
company says its sales at America’s Best Contacts & Eyeglasses "ABC" are driven by
its “Signature Offer” for “two-pairs of eyeglasses plus an eye exam for $69.95,” but as
detailed below, the company’s ads may be considered deceptive according to the FTC
and state statutes (further evidenced by the cacophony of consumer complaints). Its two
flagship brands, America’s Best and Eyeglass World, represented 63% and 11% of the
company’s net revenues in 2018, according to the March 2019 presentation.


EYE trades at an estimated forward FCF yield on par with the US 10Y treasury (at
1.651%), and a shocking 66% below the S&P 500 FCF Yield of ~4.5% (according to
Bloomberg). Said another way: EYE is a company with slowing single-digit growth that
won’t be valued on par with the market until it falls 66% to a stock price of roughly
$10/share.


(Author's Note: I reached out to the company on Monday asking about compliance with
FTC law in regards to their "signature offer" and the supporting materials associated
with it, they have not yet responded)

A Child Born Of Bankruptcies


EYE was constructed out of a series of Chapter 11 events. Private Equity infused
capital, took it public and walked away. Both the private equity sponsors (Berkshire
Partners and KKR) that funded the legacy companies and growth trajectory have sold
their stakes in EYE. The historical reality of two separate bankruptcies speaks to the
competitive nature of the business that EYE has to navigate. Now that Luxottica has
merged with lens maker Essilor EYE will have to compete against a fully integrated
business (frames, standalone stores, insurance, and lenses). EYE’s response has been
that they will grow their footprint by 75 stores per year, running the risk of growing the
business faster than what the cash flows will support (as was done twice before).

EYE Engages In Aggressive Add-Backs To EBITDA That Materially Inflate
Adjusted EBITDA.


According to the company’s 8-K, EYE defines adjusted EBITDA as “EBITDA, further
adjusted to exclude stock compensation expense, management fees, new store pre-
opening expenses, non-cash rent, management realignment expenses and other
expenses.” However, all of these expenses seem to be ongoing and normal course of
business. In all the adjustments accounted for a 9% inflation of EBITDA in 2016 but
have ballooned to 18% in 2018 – ACTUAL EBITDA only grew 2.9% YOY in 2018.

EYE has engaged in practices that appear to make its performance look better than they
are – including the highly unusual use of “adjusted comparable store sales.” Based on
an SEC search, only two other companies utilize this same metric (0.76% of the total
companies I found reporting the metrics below).


Source: SEC Filings


The fact the company calculates its adjusted comparable store sales on a cash basis
and that the revenue is estimated based on processing and delivery leaves significant
wiggle room for earnings management. In Q119,the company lowered its Q118’s
reported results; this had the effect of making EPS and margin growth look better (on a
year over year basis) than it was. Adjusted Diluted EPS in Q118 was reported as $0.35,
but in Q119 that number was changed to $0.34. In Q219, the 2018 comparable numbers
were revised down AGAIN; this consistently overstates EPS and Net Income YOY
growth by 3%-5%.


Source: Company Filings


The 6-month reporting shows that the first quarter was also managed on a YOY basis
given that gross numbers are larger than the Q219 downward adjustments

The company has expanded the length of time it excludes in total comparable-
store sales “from stores opened less than 12 months” in the 2017-10-K and prior
filings to: “sales from stores opened less than 13 months” in the 2018 10-K and
the Q119 report.


According to the 2017 10-K, Q117, Q217 and Q317 quarterly reports, the company
says they calculate total comparable-store sales based in part “on consolidated net
revenue excluding the impact of (I) Corporate/Other segment net revenue, (II) sales
from stores opened less than 12 months,”


In the 2018 10-K and the Q119 quarterly report, the company says they calculate
total comparable store sales based in part “on consolidated net revenue excluding
the impact of (I) Corporate/Other segment net revenue, (II) sales from stores
opened less than 13 months,”


The company added orders “placed and paid for or submitted to a managed care
payor” to its definition of adjusted comparable store sales growth in the 2018 10-
K and the Q119 reports as well.

The Company’s Promotional Program Puts EYE In A Difficult Position With
Clients, Investors And Regulators


Legally the company must say that their promotion is bona fide and that consumers who
wish to utilize the promotion may.However, if customers only use the promotion, the
company’s margins and sales will not grow as expected. The company states clearly in
its last 10-K that a “significant number” of its customers choose upgraded frames/lenses
and not the base offer and that the upgraded offerings generate higher margins.


EYE is stuck – abide by the letter of the law as it relates to deceptive trade practices,
including bait & switch, or please Wall Street and upsell as much as possible.

EYE's own risk factors highlight the reality that regulation could be a business risk. In its
form 10-K EYE states, “Some of our promotions, such as our America’s Best offer of a
“free” eye exam, are subject to compliance with laws and regulations governing use of
this term. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority under Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) to investigate and prosecute practices
that are “unfair trade practices,” “deceptive trade practices,” or “unfair methods of
competition.”


Consumers complain of deceptive trade and bait & switch tactics, of bad
prescriptions and shoddy service.


Given the number of complaints about the promotion (here, here, here, here, here, and
here) and the fact the company is not BBB accredited” and has a “D- BBB rating,”
according to the Better Business Bureau, it seems the company has chosen to please
Wall Street.

Highlighting The Potential Issues With The FTC


Not only do consumers complain of deception, but they also complain of rushed
eye exams and bad prescriptions (here, here, here, and here). Shoddy prescriptions
may stem from the pressure EYE puts on its optometrists to see more patients, who
according to an October 2018 William Blair report, see as many as six patients per hour
during busy periods vs. the average of 1.1 eye exam per hour based on an American
Optometric Association member survey.

The two glasses and free eye exam offer however, is only valid for single vision
uncoated plastic lenses (think coke bottles) may be deceptive as a reasonable
consumer does not understand what an uncoated plastic lens means.


According to the FTC, an advertisement is deceptive if it “is likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,” and “is "material" - that is,
important to a consumer's decision to buy or use the product.”


The FTC further states that it determines if an ad is deceptive “from the point of
view of the "reasonable consumer" - the typical person looking at the ad. Rather
than focusing on certain words, the FTC looks at the ad in context - words,
phrases, and pictures - to determine what it conveys to consumers.”


Since most consumers don’t know what a single vision uncoated lens is or how it might
be used as such granular information is only provided after the customer takes an eye
exam and is handed a prescription, it seems possible these ads could be considered
deceptive.


The company’s ads may violate the FTC’s guidance on the word “Free” as the
company does not make clear upfront that the eye exam is not free if the
customer does not purchase glasses.


“RULE SUMMARY: The offer of "Free" merchandise or service is a promotional
device frequently used to attract customers. When making "Free" or similar offers

all of the terms and conditions upon which one can receive and retain the “Free”
item should be set forth clearly and conspicuously at the outset of the offer so as to
leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood.”


Since the company does not clearly explain anywhere that the exam may not be
free unless the customer purchases glasses from the company, in my opinion the
ad likely violates the FTC’s guidance. Nowhere in the advert does it say that if the
customer does not purchase glasses, the exam is not free.


Source: Company Website


Even if the customer clicks through to the “learn more” button nowhere does it
say the customer might have to pay for the exam. The company only says that the
FREE exam is a $50 savings when you purchase any two pairs of glasses.

The company’s ads may violate the FTC’s guidance against bait switch

Companies are prohibited from discouraging “the purchase of the advertised
merchandise as part of a bait scheme to sell other merchandise,” according to
section §238.3. As noted above, consumers complain that salespeople disparage
the advertised product as coke bottle lenses, that salespeople tell the customer the
lenses are thick and will not look good.


The fact the company says a “significant number” of America’s Best and Eyeglass
world customers choose upgraded frames/lenses versus the base offer, could
indicate a lack of intent to sell the advertised product, according to interviews with
experts.


The company’s ad may violate the FTC’s guidance which says that “advertisers
should adopt the perspective of a reasonable consumer,” and that should “assume that
consumers don’t read an entire website or online screen, just as they don’t read every
word on a printed page.” A review of internet and TV ads here and here reveals different
font sizes and hard to read the text and while the company provides information about
the single vision lens requirement, but the detail is flashed for a few seconds, is in white
and is very hard to read.

A review of this back to school ad does not seem to disclose that impact-resistant
lenses are included in the $69.95 promo for kids under 13, and includes a disclaimer
that flashes on the screen for a few seconds in white: “Restrictions apply.” It would seem
a reasonable person could assume kids’ glasses include anyone under the age of 18,
not 13.


“When it comes to kids glasses, don’t overpay, overdeliver. Excite your little ones, and
enjoy big savings with everyone’s favorite Monster Jam frames. Get 2 complete pairs
with impact-resistant lenses, and a free eye exam for just $69.95.”

Grab the growth, tame the risk

Should the company be required to change its promotional program or
advertising campaigns, its sales and margins could be negatively impacted. The
company says it uses its national advertising for America’s Best to communicate its
value proposition to current and potential customers, which, in turn, drives comparable-
store sales. The company further states that they believe that television is a key channel
for connecting with its customers and that they use TV ads to “gain a larger share of
voice, and, in turn, drive traffic and margins.”


Bait and switch. The company says in its last 10-K that a “significant number” of its
customers choose upgraded frames/lenses and not the base offer and that the
upgraded offerings generate higher margins. This could easily be construed as a lack of
intent to sell the advertised product, a key element of illegal bait and switch.


Playing on the parent’s need to protect their child to drive sales and margin


In its apparent quest to increase sales, the company also appears to pressure parents
to purchase polycarbonate lenses for children over 13 by extolling the safety features of
polycarbonate vs. the CR-39 lenses offered in the $69.95 promotion. Such a policy puts
the parent in an untenable position - either pay up for safer lenses or take a chance with
the health and safety of the child’s vision. And while the company says it automatically
upgrades lenses for children ages 13 and under to polycarbonate – polycarbonate is
recommended for all minors, not just those under 13, according to Pamela Miller, OD,
JD and former president of the American Optometric Association. According to Miller,
not only should doctors “always recommend the higher-impact-resistant lenses, such as
polycarbonate,” in patients who are aged fewer than 18 years, “eye-care professionals
(ECPs) have an ethical as well as legal responsibility to inform their patients regarding
lens material options and safety.”

EYE is massively overvalued and is reporting adjusted EBITDA that masks its lack of
organic growth, worse the company has abandoned a golden rule of retail “never treat
your customer like garbage, or they will vote with their feet.” In its current form EYE will
likely trade to $10/share, if the FTC gets involved the damage could be much worse.
