Tuesday's Conference Call: Qihoo's Web Game Revenue Grows Faster
Than The Math

QIHOO 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU)


If a person of sound mind tried to tell you that he had a three-foot crowbar inside a one
foot square box, you wouldn't need to (1) look inside that box, (2) get a subpoena from a
judge, or (3) debate the man's honesty. You know that (1) this is mathematically
impossible, (2) additional information would be nice, but it wouldn't be necessary, and you
would also know instantly that (3) he's lying to you. That's what's so nice about deduction.
It's neat; it's clean; it's done.


Qihoo 360 recently changed its reported ARPU quotes from Monthly to Quarterly figures.
(ARPU stands for Average Revenue per Paying User.) What was once quoted as
somewhere between the impossible 380 and 440 monthly ARPU is now reported at 400
… for the quarter. Qihoo also tells us that this is gross ARPU.


In Tuesday night's Conference Call:


"Total web game playing users reach 148,000 in June. Web game gross ARPU for
this quarter was approximately RMB400." (Transcript and audio)


400 RMB converts to $62.96 USD. (here)


Unfortunately, those numbers belong on the left side of the revenue equation and cannot
possibly equal what Qihoo claims for the right side: total revenue. They said,


"Within IVAS, web game revenue were $19.1 million, up 189% from the same period
last year and up 10% from the prior quarter." (IVAS stands for "Internet value-added
service"; Transcript and audio)


Is this revenue net of sharing with developers?

"We concluded that game developers are the principals based on the fact that the
games are primarily hosted on the game developers' servers and such developers
are responsible for the maintenance of the games and determination of the prices of
the virtual items used in the games. Therefore, we report such revenue on a net
basis." ~ QIHU SEC 2011 20-F


But of course, in the real world none of this matters. Even if filed with the SEC, words and
definitions are constantly changing in this business ‒ with apparently little consequence.
(EG, here and here.) And then we have the press at large, who resist the hardest facts in
order to keep the broadest audience. So our most serious debates are left to message
boards. As I write this I can already hear the "refutation" ‒ "They meant gross-this, but you
said net-that" ‒ or vice versa. So I'd like to pin this squirming little bug down to the
Styrofoam. Let's forget about the revenue split with developers and net ARPU. We will
take the gross ARPU of 400 RMB as claimed in the conference call and multiply it by the
maximum ‒ the ending user base for June. We have 148,000 users in June, up from
139,000 users last March, which means that the average user base for the quarter would
be somewhere in between, but we're going to forget that. Let's count the whole 148,000
users for the entire quarter. This gives Qihoo maximum room for the math to work.


148,000 x $62.96 = $9.3 million USD … versus the total $19.1 million that Qihoo claims
they made. (And as a reminder, this is before revenue share with developers.)

As you can see, the reported numbers are so bad that even if we gave Qihoo maximum
elasticity to reinterpret "net" and "gross," the numbers are not even close. If someone
wanted to say that the $19.1 million represents revenue before revenue sharing (forget the
other implications for now), then the bar chart shown here would accurately show the
disproportion. The point here is not to illustrate revenue as it is, but to demonstrate the
impossibility of using Qihoo's numbers and arriving at Qihoo's totals ‒ while providing
Qihoo with the best possible set of numbers.


Let's cover every possibility … or, impossibility rather. If we refer to the $19.1 million (left
bar) as total revenue net of sharing with developers, then our calculated $9.3 million (right
bar) does not correspond and is much too high, since for argument's sake it has been

calculated with gross ARPU. In actuality, revenue sharing at a ratio of 70:30 with June's
user base brings us to $6.5 million. The disproportion is even greater than that shown in
the bar chart.


As you can see, even if the revenue were reported on a net basis and the ratio of revenue
share with developers were said to be 99:1, Qihoo's numbers would still be impossible. As
good as it gets is real bad.


To grow faster than mathematical possibility … that's really humbling for the rest of us who
were born within the limits of the finite world. In fact, these guys are soooo fast that the
only thing faster than Qihoo's web game growth is Qihoo's story-telling.


And Qihoo needs stories. Short sellers and others have made strong cases that …


The advertising revenue doesn't add up. (here)
The web game revenue doesn't add up.(here)
The web traffic doesn't add up. (here)
And so far the new phones appear to be a flop. (here)


This is what I meant by "Qihoo needs stories." It's "web search" makes front page news,
and any questions of the authenticity of Qihoo's current revenue are rarely even
mentioned. Apparently, people need to look forward and not to the very real problems in
the here and now; if they did they just might sell.


As it is, Qihoo's price has been going wild, as if to say, "Tomorrow's happy story is more
comfortable than today's impossible revenue." …. Well, with a big enough crowd you can
shout down good math with bad, but a person needs to be sure that the situation is
inconsequential; for example, things just might not work out for those who try to drive
across a 100 foot canyon on a 20 foot bridge. Bad math won't save them. With the stock
market of course it's not that simple. Trying to calculate how high the irrational will carry
the price is not a rational exercise. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances with the math.

Are you LONG in BIDU ? It's uncommon to see someone who wrote extra long stories 4 times since May 31,2012
against this small company. Contrarian thinking if you fear the possibility you deny the possibility more. Its what I think
your situation right now that you got burnt because you SHORT on QIHU and posting up this kind of articles to hope
to arouse the mass to deny the possibility as you. LOL.

It's uncommon to see a writer to submit articles 5 times to dis a small company like QIHU. The only reason is he is
SHORT on QIHU and probably LONG on BIDU. Contrarian thinking leads me to believe the write got burnt so bad in
the past week and do all in to write articles to deny the possibilty that he fears most - BIDU drops and QIHU rises. I
look at QIHU and it's like BI|DU when it started. Providing links to pirated MP3-4 and videos to attract traffics. BIDU
had it all and still able to become a 10-bagger. If QIHU follows the successful footstep of BIDU it will become a 10-
bagger very soon.

Why do you think the auditors don't catch these revenue discrepancies - if they exist?

Author’s reply »  "If they exist" ...


A student can chalk 2+2=5 on the board and the teacher still not correct him. I can know that this equation
cannot be demonstrated in the real world and still not know why the teacher had not corrected him. These are
two separate debates.


I can know that Qihoo’s math doesn’t add up and still not know why Deloitte signed off (or even whether or
not the SEC has a broader purpose with its present lawsuits against Deloitte).

Since when have you come to expect auditors will catch problems?

dude, i think the answer to your riddle is obvious - ARPU is and has always been monthly in every industry i know.
multiply 9$M by 70% and you get 6.5$M, then multiply that by 3 months and get the net revenue of 19.5$M for the
quarter.

Author’s reply »  I'm quoting Qihoo not posing or answering a riddle.


Read the first quote in the article; click on the links to verify. (CC script 400 arpu reference is on page 2)


Qihoo quoted 400 RMB monthly until 2nd Q '12, after which they changed their quoted ARPU to 400 RMB
quarterly, with no explanation.


Compare the above article and 2ndQ CC with this article: http://bit.ly/PFhMUl


Qihoo contradicts itself. No riddle.

As a little bit of comon sense and my math shows as well, what they actually do is: dividing the total revenue
in the quarter by the average number of users and then dividing that by three to get the ARPU. Should that be
called monthly or a quarterly? i dont know, but arguing about this does not seem essential since the revenue
number is most likely fake anyway.

Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  There's no confusion. Qihoo used the words, "monthly" and "quarterly."


Qihoo's recent contradiction, 
Q1 2012 CC: “ … the ARPU for the month was about 440 …” 
Q2 2012 CC: “"Web game gross ARPU for this quarter was approximately RMB400."


Question: Does 440/month even come close to 400/quarter? A third grader could figure this out.


There was ZERO explanation for the downshift in numbers. If Kai-Fu Lee “proved” Qihoo’s monthly 400
ARPU, then he refuted Qihoo’s new numbers. If Kai-Fu LEE “proved” quarterly 400 ARPU, then he proved
Qihoo’s Q1 ARPU claims were indeed unrealistic. In short, Qihoo had already tried to GO BACK to realistic
numbers. But it really doesn’t matter. Kai Fu can say one thing, Qihoo another, and in fact Qihoo can say one
thing in the first quarter, then contradict itself in the second, and people will only believe the MOST RECENT
STATED conclusions, regardless of how obvious the contradictions are.

The issue is not whether these guys know english or finance or even math sufficiently well to know that
monthly ARPU when it is averaged over three months does not become quarterly ARPU, because it seems
you and i are unable agree on it either. The real issue is only whether the $19.1 million revenue in the quarter
is real. That is the important number which someone should verify or refute. I read Lee's letter as well and i
dont think he is just making stuff up as he goes, but there is still something that smells fishy here, perhaps the
reason he is defending them is that other chinese companies also would like to claim they are making more at
these online games than EA, Microsoft and Sony. The bottom line is, a smoking gun proof that qihoo is lying
is still not apparent, because i personally have read their filings with my own eyes before putting on the short. 
However to sell or to put on a short, there is plenty enough to go by. There is the trojan/malware stories, there
is the business model which is changing every few months, there is the founder who is a fraudster,
unverifiable revenue and market share claims and so on...
