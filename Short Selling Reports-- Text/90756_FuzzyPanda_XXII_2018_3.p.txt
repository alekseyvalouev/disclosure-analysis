XXII


XXII's key QPT patents behind the tobacco used in their MRTP & PMTA
applications started expiring in 2018.


QPT expired patents are the essential patents behind the Vector 21-41 tobacco. In
our opinion, the Patent Expiration explains why BAT was not willing to pay even
$3m for exclusivity.


Big Tobacco can produce a similar plant to XXII now. Major tobacco companies
already have a plethora of low-nicotine tobacco patents and can adhere to FDA
low-nicotine standards.


Lawsuit accusing XXII and CEO Henry Sicignano of stealing and copying the
intellectual property of Global Tobacco LLC.


XXII was exposed by Sharesleuth as having fake positive article written about
them, engaging in paid stock promotion, a 7a) exemption to deny an FOIA reveal a
likely SEC investigation.

Essential Patents Expired! (QPT Patent Family started
expiring in 2018)


We discovered that the most important patents in XXII's patent portfolio have now
expired. In fact, some of them expired back in 2018!


From the evidence we uncovered, we believe that these expired patents (the QPT family
of patents) are the primary patents behind the Brand A/VLN (very low nicotine)
cigarettes. Those who have been tracking XXII for a while know that Brand A/VLN Cigs
are the exact same cigarettes that XXII submitted their FDA applications for their MRTP
(Modified Risk Tobacco Product) and PMTA (Premarket Tobacco Product Applications).
This patent expiration is important because it means that even if XXII were successful in
getting FDA approvals, then Big Tobacco companies would be able to come out with
similar products by developing their own tobacco plant strain using the expired patents.


These patent expirations finally explain why British American Tobacco walked away
from their XXII license agreement 2 years ago, in my opinion. As a reminder, it would've
cost BAT only $3 million in license fees for what XXII says is "game changing
technology." BAT evidently didn't think it was worth the cost and now we know why.


XXII's disclosed in the 2017 10-K that the QPT patent family started expiring in 2018.
When you think QPT Patents, we want you to realize that these are the essential
patents behind Brand A/VLN Cigarettes for which XXII filed their MRTP and PMTA
applications.


From 2017 10-K pg 12:


Our patent protection relation to the QPT gene expires in 2018. The expiration
of the QPT patent family will give third-parties the freedom to target to the QPT
gene in experiments…"


Brand A/VLN cigarettes are used in MRTP & PMTA Applications:

Tobacco for Spectrum/Brand A cigarettes (Vector 21-41)
comes from the expired QPT patents:


We will first show below that Brand A/VLN (aka Spectrum cigarettes) are the cigarettes
that XXII's MRTP and PMTA applications are based on. Then we will show that the QPT
patent family is the essential patents group behind Vector 21-41 tobacco, which we
believe is the tobacco used in Brand A Cigarettes.


On December 27, 2018, 22nd Century submitted to the FDA the Company's MRTPA
for its BRAND A product under the proposed brand name of VLNTM cigarettes… The
MRTPA states that 22nd Century's proposed VLNTM cigarettes are the same as
the lowest nicotine content style of the Company's SPECTRUM® research
cigarettes.

The problem for XXII is that the tobacco used in Spectrum and Brand A cigarettes is
believed to be from a tobacco plant called Vector 21-41. The Vector 21-41 tobacco plant
was developed (pg. 16) at North Carolina State University by Dr. Mark Conkling. The
Vector 21-41 works by suppressing the QPTase gene. The Vector 21-41 plant was
developed from the same QPT patent family that just expired in 2018.

QPT Patents are expiring!


More proof that Vector 21-41 comes from the QPT gene modifications.


The approved application for the Vector 21-41 tobacco strain by the International
Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotechs Applications specifically references
modifying the QPT gene.


QPT Patent Family - This group of patents is focused on genetically altering the DNA
encoding on the QPT enzyme in order to lower the nicotine level that the plants
produce. The tobacco for XXII's VLN/Brand A cigarettes is produced primarily using
these patents. We have emailed management to confirm this and given them over 2
weeks to respond, but they have still not responded.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/4/15/47539163-15553547072598283_origin.png

http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=238
According to the below chart and the patent database, there are 8 patents that consist of
the QPT Patent Family. The first issued ones and most important ones expired in 2018
and 3 other ones we have found expire later in 2019,starting next month (XXII
management suggests that some patents expire in 2020, but we weren't able to identify
those). The expiration of the patents in 2018 allows big tobacco companies to start
working on developing a low nicotine tobacco strain based on modifying the QPT gene if
they want to.


Source - Patent Estate - Heracles Pharmaceuticals Has Over 200 Issued Patents


Patents - 6,423,520; 6,586,661; 7,425,670; 7,605,308; 7,645,925 - All expired in 2018

7,795,509 - Expires Nov 28, 2019


In their 2018 10-K, XXII management admits that the expiration of the QPT Patent
Family will allow third parties to target the QPT gene and work on developing their own
tobacco plant that would be similar to the Vector 21-41 plant.

Competition - Big Tobacco already has low-nicotine patents:


FY 2018 - 10-K Pg 13


Based on XXII's unwillingness to disclose bad news, we do not expect them to confirm
for investors or acknowledge on conference calls how important the expiration of the
QPT patents are.


As XXII admits, any tobacco company can make low nicotine cigarettes using the exact
same methods as XXII via QPT gene modification, provided they wanted to. They
cannot use the exact same Vector 21-41 plant in their cigarettes until 2023 due to it
being under "Plant Variety Protection," but if they wished to, they could use the same
methods to modify the QPT gene in order to develop their own new plant varietal. As we
illustrated in our initial article on XXII "22nd Century - Cutting through the Smoke & Hype
- 75% downside," Big Tobacco companies do not need the Vector 21-41 plant as they
have all been capable of growing low nicotine tobacco for a while and already have very
robust low nicotine patent portfolios.


Recent developments confirm that Big Tobacco has other means of meeting the FDA's
low nicotine tobacco requirements if those regulations come into effect.


RJ Reynolds presentation (slides 10-20) from September 2018 shows 7 cases
including Vector 21-41 where researchers were able to reduce nicotine content by over
90%.


Vector 21-41 (2001): 92.5% nicotine reduction1.

BAT wasn't willing to pay $3 MILLION for XXII Patents!


A recent lawsuit brings into question the ethical standards of
XXII's CEO and connects him to Trey Prevost, a felon.


Independent major tobacco company British American Tobacco let its partnership with
XXII expire when it would cost only $3 million in license fees over the next two years to
have exclusivity over the commercialization of XXII's patent portfolio. In other words,
some of the smartest tobacco investors in the world decided that XXII's "tech" is worth
less than a $3m call option.


(Pg 6 - 2016 10-K)


Here is the September 2017 press release by XXII on BAT not deciding exercise their
option to license XXII's patents. (Press Release)

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170925005580/en/22nd-Century-Free-Restrictive-License-Agreement-British
In the lawsuit Global Tobacco LLC v. 22nd Century Group, (Case # 2:15-cv-05227-RGK-
PJW) Global Tobacco alleges that CEO Henry Sicignano and a man named Trey
Prevost have teamed up to steal, copy and capitalize on the existing goodwill of a
popular brand of cigars called Clipper. XXII at the direction of Sicignano designed
manufactured and sold a brand of cigars called Cigar Cartel, which were designed to
look exactly like a successful competing brand called Clipper Cigars. We believe it
shows questionable decision making for the CEO Henry Sicignano to associate himself
with Trey Prevost, a man with a history of criminal activity. (WSJ story below)


The case was settled out of court, but interestingly XXII now manufactures Clipper
cigars for Global Tobacco, and we believe Global Tobacco is one of XXII's largest
contract manufacturing customers. Given the nature of the relationship between Global
Tobacco and XXII, we think this could explain why the economics on their contract
manufacturing business have such terrible gross margins (just 3% in 2018 and -4.3% in
2017) (pg 35 2018 10-k)

SEC Investigation update:


In October we published SEC FOIA's in an article "FOIA's reveal suspected undisclosed
SEC Investigation" that showed that the company was likely under active investigation.
Instead of addressing that for shareholders, management has focused on telling
investors that they currently don't have an "SEC Enforcement action." In our opinion,
this specific wording of "Enforcement Action" is likely only confusing word-play by XXII
management. An enforcement action only comes at the conclusion of an investigation.
So, in our opinion, they are trying to disprove the existence of what we suspect is an
ongoing SEC investigation by saying that they don't have an "Enforcement Action."


For more information on SEC Investigations & Enforcement Actions, please see the
SEC Website.

We reiterate that the SEC's responses to FOIAs on XXII and subsequent appeals that
were denied are clear. Based on the Exemption 7a) response to our FOIAs it is our
suspicion that there is an active SEC Investigation into XXII. As the below letter printed
on SEC letterhead explains an exemption 7a) was correctly asserted regarding XXII
because "releasing the withheld information could reasonably be expected to
interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings."


We encourage investors to do their own due diligence here. It is easy to submit your
own FOIA. Click on this link, select XXII as the company you would like to FOIA, and
then choose investigations. For the vast majority of other public companies, you'll get a
reply citing no material regarding investigations found. For XXII you should receive the
same 7a) denial (like the above) that we did on SEC letterhead stating that records are
being withheld.



https://www.sec.gov/page/office-foia-services
XXII other suspect practices:


We think this situation will end up similar to the one at Zion Oil & Gas where the
company adamantly denied there being an SEC investigation and then months later
filed an 8-k that they had received subpoenas from the SEC Ft. Worth office.

XXII's essential patents, the QPT Patent Family, have now mostly expired. These
patents were the key patents behind Vector 21-41 tobacco, which is the tobacco used in
Brand A/VLN/Spectrum cigarettes, the tobacco that XXII used with their MRTP and
PMTA applications with the FDA. The expiration of these patents means that XXII's
technology is no longer defensible, and it is finally clear why British America Tobacco did
not think it was worth paying $3 million for exclusive rights to their patent portfolio.
Furthermore, big tobacco is unlikely to ever pay XXII licensing fees since the
"technology" XXII has to license is no longer protected by patents.


XXII management have been accused of stealing their customer's intellectual property,
paying for stock promotions, having fake positive articles written about the company,
and worst of all now the "technology" & "patents" that this whole story has been built on
have EXPIRED.
