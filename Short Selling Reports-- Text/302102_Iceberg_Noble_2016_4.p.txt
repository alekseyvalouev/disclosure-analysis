DISMISSAL OF NOBLE GROUP’S CEO,
YUSUF ALIREZA


May 31, 2016  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 12 Comments  


Mr Alireza was recruited by Noble Group four years ago after he left


Goldman Sachs. His first day as CEO of this large physical trader was his


first day in the commodity business. The learning curve has been a


particularly painful experience for the company’s shareholders: the share


price fell by 76%. Noble dramatically underperformed the other traders that


can be short or long commodities. The trader even underperformed many


producers that are structurally long.


Although Mr Alireza played a major role in Noble’s collapse, the dubious


accounting practices, especially the commodity contracts fair values did not


start with him. The level was already suspiciously high under the previous


CEO, Ricardo Leiman. He also found Noble in poor shape after his


predecessor made investments in sugar assets at the very wrong


time. However, Mr Alireza could have walked away from a company


increasingly dependent on accounting alchemy to hide bad results. Instead,


he manipulated the financial statements even more aggressively, and the


fair values grew even faster. The auditor, Ernst and Young, allowed Noble


to discreetly exploit every accounting loophole to give a fundamentally


misleading representation of its profitability. Noble was able to “manage”


its bottom line, something CEOs dream of. The board of directors, the


institutional investors, etc. were particularly passive. Mr Alireza received


not less than 75 million stock options.


Problems started in February 2015 with our reports. Mr Alireza vigorously


defended his company, hired infamous spin doctors Bell Pottinger,


multiplied defamatory statements, and embarked on a full-scale campaign


against “malicious” researchers and short sellers. Capital markets watched


this embarrassing show for one year: a former Goldman Sachs working in a


trading firm who complained that the market was unable to value things

Well said! Take a bow Iceberg, you have been right from day one!


Simon Jacques · May 31, 2016 - 4:34 am · Reply→


Bye Alireza, welcome Randall.


correctly. Yancoal overvalued by 48 times its market value on Noble’s


balance sheet? No problem: it’s because it’s illiquid. The commodity


contracts suddenly impaired by $1.1b while the company had been immune


to impairments? No this does not mean they were overvalued, absolutely


not…


Mr Alireza’s reaction to criticism was particularly aggressive and many


investors immediately understood that something was wrong with this


company. For the journalists who were asking critical questions, Noble had


one answer: a letter from its lawyers. Even an NGO received legal threats.


For the press, it has been very difficult to cover this company normally. Mr


Alireza claimed he wanted to defend shareholders against Iceberg. In


reality, he wanted to stifle free speech. If he had any respect for his


shareholders, he would have disclosed the remuneration he received for his


extremely poor performance. Noble does not comply with the Singapore


Governance Code’s recommendation to disclose individual remuneration of


senior management.


Mr Alireza is not done with Noble. Some statements made by the former


CEO create some legal exposure for him. From misleading declarations on


the financials to defamatory statements about us, we have always been


surprised by how careless Mr Alireza was when he spoke in public.


The firing of the CEO was long overdue. However, this does not solve the


financial crisis at Noble.

this insanity has not stopped:


“Mr. Alireza has helped guide Noble through a very challenging


period, moving the company to an asset-light, merchant-focused


model”


-Does the asset-light model excuse trading co. like the Noble to


not produce any retained earnings ?


“With this transformation process now largely complete, Mr.


Alireza considered that the time was right for him to move on.” -


Noble Group OfficialPR


-Instrumental in wasting more than $2.68B in free cash flows


since 27 months.


Let me tell you something; the Big N has a lot of paper, more


exactly a NON-AUDITED $2.617B Net Fair Value Gains on


commodity contracts $3.1B AUDITED (with some non-realized-


profits booked over 10 years in the future) for a $3.4B balance-


sheet equity.


The new entrants in commodity finance from the country of


tulips precisely Raiffeisen Co-op Bank (what they now brand as


Rabobank), ABN Amro are relatively small in sizes are set to learn


the positive skew of commodity lending.


They are simply left with the leftovers that the nobody wants to


quote.

unable to understand the following. Why do such an expensive


rights issue at one third of market price if company has no


liquidity issues and they will anyway raise USD 1.5 billion from


sale of US asset. Did the banks just give them bridge financing in


the latest round and not really roll over the debt? Why does the


company need 2 bn of cash when it is going into an asset light


model. What will they use the cash for? Pay dividends? 


Why is Elman reducing his stake. Is it a sign that Noble is


overvalued even at 11c? If Elman knew the company better than


anyone else (and hopefully he does), he should be underwriting


the whole deal and looking to increase his stake? 


Bonds have rallied like there is no tomorrow. If they sell US


assets, is company not effectively left with no assets, their biggest


earning generator gone. Why is the bond, especially the perpetual


bond, rallying so much. And sell side buffoon analysts are


changing their recommendation to Buy. 


I dont understand what is going on and sell side analysts havent


got a clue. Look forward to some answers from Iceberg.


Iceberg Research · June 22, 2016 - 8:44 am · Reply→


AK, you bring excellent points. The refinancing did not


solve Noble’s liquidity issues. They got $1b cash but the


$2b borrowing base is not a simple loan: drawings can be


made only against sufficient collateral. On top of that,


many suppliers are very cautious with Noble and cut


credit. Noble’s liquidity is tight. We also think the banks


want to reduce their exposure and offload the risk to


shareholders.


Indeed Elman could reinvest more money in Noble. He


does not.


Bondholders should ask themselves what Noble’s cash


generation is exactly, now that the assets are sold one by


one, including NAES a rare good asset.

As long as senior management and the auditor (EY) are in


place, stakeholders should not expect any transparency


from this company.

Any comments on the rights issue and sale of US assets?


Iceberg Research · June 22, 2016 - 8:44 am · Reply→


See above.


Iceberg Research · June 22, 2016 - 8:48 am · Reply→


We think our arguments are now validated. It is up to the


stakeholders to understand that they cannot trust this


management or this auditor. If they think things have


improved in terms of transparency, they are wrong and


can only blame themselves for future losses.

And how’s the court case coming along?


N has been oh so quiet about it now hahah

Going nowhere as expected.

Noble have always been dodgy. Circumvented brokers and stole


their rightful commission during the early days.
