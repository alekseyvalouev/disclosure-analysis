EBIX: Not a
Chinese Fraud,
But a House of
Cards Nonetheless
Mar. 22, 2011 10:43 AM ET31 comments | Includes: CRM, …


We have written a report on EBIX Inc. (NASDAQ:EBIX) that may be of interest
to shareholders, auditors, and most importantly - the IRS and SEC. 
 
The full report can be downloaded here: 
www.scribd.com/doc/51304576/EBIX-Not-a-C... 
 
Winston Churchill's famous quote, "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
enigma," might as well have been targeting Ebix Inc. (ticker EBIX). EBIX has
been an aggressive acquirer of a variety of companies over the years, many of
which focus on the insurance industry. The company's offering mix is a
confusing amalgamation of niche products that all have a "roll-up" stench.
Robin Raina, EBIX's CEO, has liberally described his business with the buzz
words du jour, such as "exchanges," "CRM," "The Cloud," and "SaaS." The
stock has performed well, fueled by retail investor interest, momentum
publications like Investors' Business Daily and minimal scrutiny from analysts.
We believe that EBIX is nothing more than a roll-up that has materially
misrepresented its business (relative to the CEO's buzz words) as well as its
organic growth. Its business model is predicated on two principals: tax
arbitrage and dramatic cost cuts (headcount reductions and offshoring),
neither of which is sustainable. Further, the company's tax arbitrage may be
more than "just" unsustainable, it may actually be illegal.  


EBIX's problems run deeper than unusual accounting. The EBIX story also
comes with multiple auditor resignations, governance abuses, misrepresented
organic growth, questionable cash flow and a contentious CEO. Below we
address these concerns in great detail. Given the gravity of these issues, we

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/152143-ebix-not-a-chinese-fraud-but-a-house-of-cards-nonetheless 2/17


have notified the IRS and the SEC of the material abuses at EBIX. We hope the
warranted scrutiny saves investors from significant losses as the true EBIX
story gets told. 


EBIX shares are worth no more than $9.00, a level that would represent a
65% decline from current prices. We arrive at our target by adjusting current
consensus estimates for a 35% tax rate (where it will likely go), and applying
a generous market multiple of 12x normalized earnings (consensus estimates
include assumptions that are unattainable and adjust for oddities such as
amortization, while failing to contemplate massive underinvestment in sales
and R&D). We estimate that the company has less than $0.75 of de novo
earnings power.





This report will detail:


1) The History of a Roll-up & Its "Slash & Burn" Strategy. The $970
million of "value creation" imbedded in EBIX's valuation is likely to collapse
given the myriad of issues the company currently faces.


2) EBIX's Atrocious Organic Growth and Manipulative Metrics. Investors
have a distorted view of the company's growth profile. We estimate organic
growth was negative in 2009 and was less than 4% in 2010. Management's
definition of organic growth is highly manipulative and demonstrates the
deceptive nature of the CEO.


3) Growth Crippled by Suspiciously Low Sales and R&D Expense. EBIX's
extremely low sales and marketing and product development expenses are not
consistent with a technology company. EBIX's company-wide sales and
marketing expense was $2 million less than the stand alone run-rate of a
recent acquisition. This acquired company that outspent EBIX was 1/20th of
EBIX's size. EBIX's margins are overstated and will be crippled by massive
reinvestment to avoid larger declines in organic growth. The only segment of
EBIX's business that has not benefited from a recent acquisition declined 27%
in the fourth quarter.


4) ADAM Assumptions are Incomprehensible and Will Drive
Disappointment in 2011. EBIX recently closed its largest acquisition to date.
EBIX must improve ADAM's margins by 2,500 basis points on day one, grow

faster than ADAM did in the previous 3 years, recognize no D&A expenses and
recognize a zero percent tax rate to generate the $0.15 of accretion that the
company has guided to. This overly aggressive guidance will result in negative
earnings revisions relative to analyst's elevated expectations.


5) Potentially Illegal Tax Strategy and Impact on Earnings and
Valuation. EBIX utilizes two strategies to reduce taxes to nearly zero. The
first strategy suggests a lack of oversight from auditors and earnings
manipulation. The second is more sinister and potentially illegal. Through a
series of superficial transactions that pose no business purpose other than to
avoid U.S. taxes; EBIX was able to turn each dollar of foreign revenue into
$1.40 of profits in 2010. This tax strategy is not sustainable in the near, or
intermediate, term. A higher tax rate in the future will dramatically change the
economics of EBIX's business, significantly impair its earnings expectations,
and could subject the company to significant fines, penalties and back taxes.


6) Free Cash Flow Myth. Many investors use free cash flow to justify EBIX's
valuation. We believe EBIX's free cash flow is a highly distorted metric given
limited cash R&D expense and its questionable tax strategy. In fact, if
investors simply adjust for a normalized tax rate, then EBIX trades at 37x free
cash flow.  Taken a step further and adjusting for R&D expense for acquired
technology costs (acquisitions in the cash flow from investing segment), then
EBIX trades at nearly 50x free cash. 


7) Significant Quality of Earnings Issues. EBIX appears to manage
earnings through accounting shenanigans, including accounts receivable and
its allowance for doubtful accounts. The very low level of acquisition price
allocated to non-indefinite intangibles is highly suspicious for a technology
company and points to a lack of auditor oversight and a desire to overstate
earnings through lower amortization. In 2010, EBIX generated almost $0.20 of
earnings that are unlikely to repeat in 2011, which could drive incremental
earnings disappointment.


8) History of Auditor Turnover, Shockingly Low Audit Fees and
Accounting Red Flags. Investors should view EBIX's stated financials with
extreme skepticism given the myriad of accounting and oversight issues. EBIX
has had four different auditors over the past seven years. Management's
explanation for the high auditor turnover does not reconcile with the

company's filings. EBIX pays its tiny regional auditing firm less than $350,000
a year in audit fees, a tiny fraction of the audit fees that are paid by
companies EBIX's size.


9) Controversial CEO Appears to Demonstrate a History of
Misrepresentation. EBIX's CEO does not allow analysts or investors access to
other members of his management team. This alone is cause for concern
about what Robin is hiding. The CEO makes 1,250% more than any other
employee. The company's lack of bench strength will again be on full display at
their second ever analyst day on April 1st. The CEO's charity appears to make
outlandish claims relative to its size and scope.


10) SaaS Provider? We Think Not. EBIX's management and analysts claim
EBIX is the next great SaaS provider. This is a gross misrepresentation. SaaS
companies measure their deferred revenue in quarters and years due to the
subscription nature of the business. EBIX's deferred revenue can barely be
measured in days and weeks.  As a result, EBIX has minimal visibility relative
to real SaaS providers. Also, management misrepresents its products by
classifying the majority of its business as "exchanges." These
misrepresentations are consistent with management's historical actions.





(Due to the danger of retaliation from the company, this report was written
under a pseudonym, Copperfield Research. People like Robin Raina are willing
to do anything to keep the house of cards in tact. The author of this report can

Copperfield Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  ozzfan1317, thanks for
the question. We meticulously documented
our sources if you read the document.
EBIX shifted 77% of their income to their
foreign operations (mostly India and
Singapore). EBIX generated 75% of their
revenue in the US. The carryovers play a
smaller part in EBIX's tax situation today
(although this has been a source of
earnings manipulation as documented in
our research).

sailrmann
How is EBIX's shifting of 77% of their
income different than any other
company's doing it? Don't other
companies do it too? While I personally
don't like it (and probably most people
don't) is it illegal? IE, why is this an
issue?

Yes, I agree with Pat, it is really
reprehensible to not have the, well, for
lack of a better word, maturity, to post
your real name. I may have missed this in
the article, but I assume you are shorting
the stock? (If you are short the stock but
didn't mention it, that's also
reprehensible). I find it comical when
short-sellers post anonymous rants on
sites like Seeking Alpha and think they are
so influential that their pronouncements
actually move markets! Really, that just
makes me laugh.


In any event, I am not saying that some of
your concerns aren't valid, it's just that
you don't provide much evidence to back
them up, and to make claims that this is a
house of cards, that the company is
engaging in accounting shenanigans, etc.
etc., well, those are serious claims that
deserve a serious analysis, not the
anonymous rant you post here.

Another question: who is Copperfield

All I can find on Seeking Alpha is that
"Copperfield Research is the pseudonym of
a research organization focusing on
publicly traded equities."


Why does Copperfield Research use a

You posted your article on scribd.com. I
have never heard of that website. Can you

counsel for two (2004 – 2006). From that
association, as well as from ongoing
anecdotal evidence and third party
corroboration (some really smart people
have been kicking the EBIX tires for years
– resulting in some impressive holders who
have met the team), I continue to have
nothing but confidence in his abilities to
execute the EBIX business. Whereas many
small-cap CEOs are fixated on their share
price and focus their efforts to curry favor
with analysts & funds and the media,
Robin’s focus has been on execution and
letting the “numbers speak for
themselves.” He has built his company
through acquisitions that have delivered
new technology, customers, markets,
capabilities and business models – almost
all of which he structured and funded
without the assistance of bankers.


What he has achieved at EBIX has been
nothing short of amazing and visionary –
he has transformed a company that was
mired in a money-loosing shrink-wrapped
software model into a new markets and
businesses including some that have since
been deemed SasS, the Cloud, etc. He has
always had great vision and large goals
which have enabled him to achieve great
things for EBIX – he’s done what he said
he would do – and has shown his
confidence by holding on to the bulk of his
stock.


I am still reading Copperfield’s “Research”
but as a career IR professional I can’t help
but be wowed by their skillful (and
unbridled) use of innuendo, slanted
opinion, hyperbole, misinformation, and
“glass half empty-ism” to create a tempest
where there really is none. They review
clearly disclosed metrics, facts and

developments as revelations – and layer
them to form a mirage of conspiracy like a
great summer novel.


The velocity of their spin is truly
impressive – and the masterful
manipulation starts with a powerful nod to
“Chinese Fraud” and leverages that
inappropriate but colorful slur by making it
a “Three Part” saga. A normal one-part
blog post would likely get little attention
but a 3-parter carries much more gravitas
– it even suggests substance or true
research and camouflages what is no more
than good old fashion stock manipulation
propaganda. The language is colorful and
leads the reader into a reverie of terror:
‘“roll-up” stench,’ “auditor resignations,”
“deceptive nature of the CEO,” “Growth
Crippled by,” “ADAM Assumptions are
Incomprehensible,” etc. – just on page 1!


I’ve skimmed the report and see nothing
new – just a very clear attempt to twist
well-known facts into a persuasively
argued but intellectually dishonest treatise.
And to top it off – Copperfield has NO prior
activity on SeekingAlpha and refuses to
identify themselves for fear of the “danger
of retaliation from company management”
– an ironic coup de grâce of their spin
campaign.


Given the barrage of personal and
professional affronts –and today’s share
price impact – it would be hard for EBIX to
not react to this assault – and perhaps
EBIX my rebut this report in some way –
other than holding their already scheduled
analyst day in NYC on April 1st.
Fortunately, running a business well is the
best revenge, and I can count on Robin to
do that for many years to come. He’s had
similar people say similar things – but in

less colorful ways - over the past few years
– but has stuck to his business and the
Company performance speaks for itself.
This may even give the company an
opportunity to repurchase some stock on
the cheap!


Fortunately the stock market is a voting
machine in the short term and a weighing
machine over the long term. Copperfield
gets their day in the sun while us EBIX
investors can count on Robin and his team
to move the scales for us in a meaningful
way. If you know what you own – you can
be confident in riding out the storm – but
if you don’t – you will likely be swayed by
the newest prophet to hit the blogosphere.
For me – EBIX’s track record is long and
openly disclosed – while Copperfield is new
and unknown – I’m going with what I
know.

While I do find the analysis very detailed
and may in fact have tremendous merit, it
is still very distasteful to see a "Research
Firm" hiding behind a pseudonym in order
to 'protect itself from hostile management"
(their words, not mine.....)


Really?


And in agreeing that SA should not be
lambasted for allowing the free flow of
opinions from all sources, I do seriously
need to question how Copperfield Research
can be a #1 Opinion Leader on Software
with only 3 articles written, all three parts
of the same article, and with only 3
'comments' made.....and all made within
the last two days!


This does nothing to refute the allegations
made against EBIX, detailed as they are,
but by hiding behind the curtains and
playing with smoke and mirrors, one must
seriously question the motives of these
individuals who will not stand behind their
work.

It is quite simple to put this dispute in
rest. All Ebix or Robin needs to do is
coming out with strong language and
challenge the Copperfield Research Psy.

The days of the SEC or the NASD
investigating 'stock manipulation', with
the heavy push for 'deregulation' in
Washington, is long gone. This is clear
manipulation but the people in Congress
are on a boat that basically says
individual American investors are on
their own.......and GOOD LUCK! When I
hear a buffoon in Congress screaming
about how we need 'LESS REGULATION'
in Gov't., I want to scream at the top of
my lungs "That's how we got INTO this
mess! 1) Banking Crisis - No regulation
of derivatives, 2) Horizon disaster -
SELF- Regulation or closely tied
regulation in the Oil/Gas industry, 3)
Bernie Madoff - NO Scrutiny or follow up
by the SEC at all after repeated
warnings


I am FOR strong, smart regulation with
teeth because without it the wolves will
continue to fleece the American public
as they continue to do today.

To sum up your arguments.


EBIX is tax sheltering -- Them and
everybody else. More and more global
companies are headquartered in tax-
friendly domiciles. That's life. It's not
illegal, just annoying and they aren't going

to 35%. That number is completely out of
left field and I suspect that you know that.


EBIX growth isn't organic -- Yep. Duh.
They grow by acquisition using their cash
flow. I don't care what numbers they use
for their organic growth as long as the
bottom line earnings numbers continue to
hold their growth, which they have done
quarter after quarter. Anyone who
understands the company and has
watched them knows that they grow by
acquisition.


They don't have enough R&D -- That's
because they grow by acquisition. See
above. If you're comparing them to other
technicals that have to continue to develop
new technical break-throughs, you're
missing the point.


EBIX doesn't have good cash flow -- That's
a bunch of hooey based on your bogus
35% tax rate idea and that you don't
understand why their business model
doesn't require high R&D costs.


You don't like their CEO -- I could care
less. I do like their CEO. I think he's an
innovative leader.


They aren't cloud -- I generally agree, but
I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Cloud is
sexy, but it isn't particularly profitable for
most yet.
