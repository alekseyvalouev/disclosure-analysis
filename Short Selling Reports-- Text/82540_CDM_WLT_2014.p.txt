Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Basic Materials


Walter Energy's over levered capital structure is becoming too constrained to
maintain its rapidly rising interest payments.


A global supply glut of Met coal will likely take years rather than months to reverse
course.


High yield market is already betting on a restructuring, interest payments alone in
the last four quarters have risen from $53 million to roughly $80 million per quarter.


Debt service payments for fiscal year 2014 will reach an all time high at
approximately 23% of revenues.


"The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that
basket." -Andrew Carnegie


In November of 2010, Walter Energy (NYSE:WLT) made a $3.25 billion offer for Western
Coal Corp., which, at the time was thought to be a "transformative" transaction that
would enable Walter to compete on a global scale.


From a December 2010 press release:

"This is a transformative transaction at a time when global demand for metallurgical
coal is surging," said Joe Leonard, interim chief executive officer of Walter Energy.
"Western Coal has an attractive high-quality metallurgical coal asset base and has
embarked on an organic growth strategy that is expected to increase production more
than 60 percent by fiscal 2013. It is a unique strategic fit with Walter Energy's large
scale, high-productivity mines which produce premium-quality metallurgical coal for
customers in South America and Europe. Our combined production capacity and
geographic footprint leaves us extremely well positioned to benefit from favorable
sector dynamics driven by increased steel production in markets such as China, India
and Brazil. Bottom line, this is the right transaction at the right time."


Ironically, less than four years later, that single transaction has Walter on the precipice of
financial ruin. We think speculative bulls in Walter Energy are enamored with the
unrealistic possibility of a quick recovery in the metallurgical (Met) coal market. In our
estimation, the probability for Walter Energy to emerge from this mess unscathed
(restructuring) is in the single digits. While we do believe that there will be an eventual
metallurgical coal recovery at some point (likely years from now), we think Walter
Energy will be long gone before the recovery-- due to some grave mistakes made at the
peak of the market. Not only did management take its eye off the basket, but it picked
the entirely wrong basket altogether, adding heavily to an already large concentration of
Met coal production at peak multiples.


Company profile:


"As of March 31, 2014, the Company operated eight active coal mines, a coke plant
and a coal bed methane extraction operation located within Alabama, West Virginia,
Northeast British Columbia in Canada and South Wales in the U.K. We operate our
business through the U.S. Operations and Canadian and U.K. Operations principal
business segments. The U.S. Operations segment includes hard coking coal and
thermal coal mines in both Alabama and West Virginia, a coke plant in Alabama, and
coal bed methane extraction operations located in Alabama.

The Canadian mining operations include three metallurgical coal surface mines
in Northeast British Columbia (the Wolverine Mine, the Brule Mine, and the
Willow Creek Mine). The Willow Creek mine operations were curtailed during
the first half of 2013 and on April 15, 2014, the Company announced that it will
idle the Wolverine mine immediately with plans to idle the Brule mine by July
2014. The Company will continue to operate the preparation plants at these mines to
complete processing of coal inventory that has already been mined. Our U.K. mining
operation consists of an active curtailed underground mine located in South Wales
that produces anthracite coal, which can be sold as a low-volatile PCI coal.


Sales of metallurgical coal were 2.6 million and 2.8 million metric tons for the
three months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively,
accounting for approximately 88% of our coal sales volume for both periods.
Sales of thermal coal were 343 thousand and 387 thousand metric tons for the three
months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively, and accounted for
approximately 12% of our coal sales volume for both periods." 10-Q

In terms of proportion of production exported, Australia is the largest exporter in the
world, with roughly 75% of total coal production exported. Australia also happens to
have some of the lowest production costs in the world (shown below), which is
reshaping the global marketplace by replacing higher cost operations in North America
and Russia. As the demand picture has slowed materially in China, this has created a
twofold dynamic of lower demand and a well supplied market. This is likely to be a
consistent theme over the next few years as the over supplied market works off
excesses and recovers with large scale efficient producers getting even stronger.


A portion of the supply glut blame goes to large scale producers (BHP Billiton (BHP),
Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKY), Vale (VALE), & Rio (RIO)) with deep pockets and
large economies of scale which are able to weather gross margin compression while
producing coal at depressed prices-- essentially forcing weaker competitors out of the
market. While not an explicit strategy for major producers, keeping prices low for an
extended period of time would weed out less efficient producers with weak balance
sheets. As shown below (in turquoise), the majority of the world's lowest cost coking
coal originates out of Australia. With growing Met coal production out of Australia in
2014 dwarfing curtailments, we anticipate a problematic next few years for many high
cost producers such as Walter, Arch Coal (ACI), and Alpha Natural Resources (ANR).


As the shakeout continues, another issue has arisen with legacy take-or-pay contracts
signed during the coal boom. Many of the long-term port contracts were struck at the
peak of the market during the frenzy in 2011. These long-term contracts became a
catch-22, with money losing mines choosing to stay open thereby meeting agreed upon
production targets. Thus, for many producers it is actually cheaper to continue meeting
production quotas at modest losses rather than pay the port and rail fees, which can
amount to between $14-20 per tonne. These detrimental contracts have pushed even
more supply onto the market at the exact moment when it is not needed. This take-or-
pay effect is likely to slow any price recovery for coking coal in the near term, and delay
a re-balancing of supply and demand even further into the future.

The coal market in North America, particularly the U.S., has been suffering secular as
well as cyclical challenges that are likely to persist for some time. While some of these
recent production increases from Australia, Indonesia, and Mongolia have fully offset
any reductions in North America, those reductions, according to UBS, only account for
approximately 4% of global supply. The other issue affecting U.S. coal producers are
some of the highest cash costs per ton versus the rest of the world. As shown above,
the U.S. has the highest coking coal cash costs of any major exporting country. Not only
that, but the major end markets (China, Japan, India, and Europe) require substantial
transportation costs hurting margins even further. As coking coal prices remain low, U.S.
producers with the highest cash costs in the world will suffer the most as production
shifts to lower cost regions.


A note from Goldman Sachs seems to agree with our longer-term view of a slow multi-
year recovery.


"Goldman Sachs cut its metallurgical coal price projection to $141 per metric ton in
2014, down from $150 previously. The downgrade also forecasts lower coal prices in
2015 and 2016 as well - on the heels of higher output in Australia and slowing growth
of Chinese imports. The firm's other issue is limited supply rationalization in the
United States."

Australia's Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics (BREE) seems to agree with
Goldman's recent commentary; it said in a quarterly update on June 26th that it had cut
its forecast for Met coal prices and iron ore for 2015. The forecast change was largely
credited to rising output from new mines more than offsetting production cuts from mine
closures.


"BREE also forecast a sharp dip in metallurgical coal prices to $118.90 a tonne in
2015, well down on its March forecast of $134.60. It slightly increased its forecast for
exports to 180.5 million tonnes in 2014/15, just up on a year earlier."


Only the first liens in Walter's capital structure will come out successfully from a
reorganization.

As stated in our opening comments, the acquisition of Western Coal is not merely a
thorn in the side of Walter; it may prove to be fatal in early 2015. As cash on hand
dwindles and liquidity dries up towards the end of the year, we think the problems will be
even more pronounced than management has alluded to in recent investor
presentations.


The fact that Walter has been aggressively attempting to control costs by idling its
Canadian operations and halting other mines with high production costs has forced
Walter into a corner. In a capital intensive business such as coal mining, less capacity
utilization has the opposite effect on fixed cost leverage. While management has tried to
cut as many costs as possible, we feel there is only so much juice one can squeeze out
of this lemon-- as evidenced by the unsustainable depreciation to Capex differential last
quarter, $95 million to $12 million, respectively. We think normalized Capex would have
an annual run-rate of approximately $400 million, which would be very similar to current
levels of depreciation. With normalized capital expenditures alone, that would use up the
entire cash balance Walter has at the end of Q1 by the first quarter of 2015, not to
mention there are significant costs associated with take-or-pay contracts for each of the
mines currently being idled. The new cost structure should become much more
apparent on the Q2 conference call.

The other major issue we see with Walter is the rapidly rising interest expense on debt.
For example, total interest expense has risen from $17.25 million in FY 2010, to an
estimated $320 million for FY 2014. Interest expense this year based on the most recent
run-rate should equate to roughly $320 million, or over 75% of the current market cap. In
just the last four quarters interest expense has risen an astounding 49%. We think that
this trajectory will continue, as more high interest debt was added on March 19th.


The high interest debt recently added seems to be just the tip of the iceberg; in fact,
during the refinancing process it was said that Morgan Stanley was essentially forcing
managers to purchase the Second Lien PIK Toggle Notes before allowing them to
purchase the First Lien Senior Secured.


"Walter Energy's US$350m 11% April 2020 payment-in-kind (PIK) deal in March
traded poorly from the start, plunging six points in price on the break.


Two investors said left-lead Morgan Stanley had told some portfolio managers that
they would only get allocation on a US$200m first lien add-on, which was issued by
Walter at the same time, if they also bought into the PIK."

An 8-K filed on 03/19/2014 would seem to agree with the commentary from the portfolio
managers. It shows there was substantial interest in the Senior Secured, with an
increased size of $100 million, to a total of $200 million. Return assumptions from the
Senior Secured First Liens seems to nullify the highly probable scenario of a complete
loss on the corresponding issuance of the PIK Toggle Notes. It also appears portfolio
managers started dumping the PIK Toggle Notes at the first available opportunity. If this
is true, Morgan Stanley is essentially selling a bankruptcy scenario where the Senior
Secured comes out of Debtor In Possession (DIP) mostly intact with significant claims to
the underlying assets. The demand appears to be so high that bond investors were
willing to take the prospects of an immediate loss on the PIK Toggle Notes for a chance
to participate in the highly likely scenario of a restructuring. We have never found it a
good thing to have the underwriter essentially betting against the company with its pitch
to bond investors.


"On March 19, 2014, Walter Energy, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release
announcing the pricing and increase in size of its previously announced private
offering of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes
due 2019, to $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes due 2019 with a coupon of 9.500% (the "New First Lien Notes"). The New
First Lien Notes are a follow-on issue to the $450.0 million aggregate principal
amount of the Company's 9.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 which were
issued on September 27, 2013." 8-K

As shown above, interest expense over the past few years has risen rapidly; even more
worrisome is that gross margins have yet to bottom. Gross margins have fallen from
52% in FY 2010 to 15% in Q3 2014. With margins likely to compress even further in Q2,
with the benchmark HCC coal prices falling from a benchmark of $143 in Q1 to $120 in
Q2, a sixteen percent decrease sequentially.


At first glance, it also appears that some of the SG&A expenses have been rapidly
declining. A closer look reveals that more than half the recent decrease was due to a
"reclassification" of expenses.

"Selling, general & administrative expense includes costs for corporate and direct
administrative functions not directly assignable to an individual operation. Selling,
general & administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased
$33.5 million, or approximately 25.1% to $99.9 million, as compared with $133.5
million in 2012. The decrease was attributable to our cost containment initiatives as
well as the reclassification of selling, general and administrative expenses of
approximately $17.4 million to cost of sales as discussed in Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."
10-K


Given what we know about what is taking place in Q2 with the Canadian mines idling-- a
16% drop in HCC benchmark and the sale of the Blue Creek terminal for $25 million--
we can get a picture of what the quarter will likely look like. Given the Q1 revenues of
$413 million, we see a sequential impact of ~20% on Q2 sales given the price
decreases and production curtailment in Canada. Considering the sale of the Blue
Creek terminal in May, we estimate overall sales in the $330-350 million range for Q2.
The street consensus is well above that range with estimated revenues at $377 million.

We see an interesting comparison between Patriot Coal and Walter Energy. We forecast
Q2 gross margins for Walter at ~10-11% after accounting for take-or-pay contracts,
significantly lower fixed cost leverage, and a 16% sequential decrease in coking coal
benchmark prices. The more troubling line item is that Walter has 4x the interest
expense to sales that Patriot had right before filing bankruptcy, while Walter should have
a comparable gross margin profile in Q2. With roughly 5x the net debt of Patriot Coal
(prior to Chp. 11), it seems Walter has very limited options to improve liquidity, other
than asset liquidations at fire sale prices.


Even more alarming for Walter investors is iron ore and coking coal producer Cliff's
(CLF) recently amended its $1.75 billion credit revolver arrangement to stave off
breaking covenants, which has negative implications for Walter's refinancing
possibilities. Cliff's ended up being able to amend covenants that restricted the amount
of debt it has relative to EBITDA in place of a debt to capitalization ratio measure of less
than 45%. Lenders also required Cliff's to maintain an EBITDA-to-interest ratio of at
least 3.5. If you place Walter under the same light, EBITDA-to-interest for 2014 is
forecasted to be substantially below 1. In fact, we estimate Walter's EBITDA-to-interest
coverage ratio will be only about ~.3125 ($100M EBITDA/$320M int) for FY 2014.
Essentially, Cliff's was on the verge of breaking covenant restrictions with more than ten
times the EBITDA-to-interest coverage of Walter-- a sign that cannot be good news for
any investor subordinate to the first liens.


S&P downgrades Walter Energy's Corporate credit rating to CCC+, outlook negative.


"The negative outlook reflects our expectation that weak met coal market conditions
will persist, which will pressure the company's liquidity position," said Standard &
Poor's credit analyst William Ferara. "We also expect very weak credit measures in
2014, with debt leverage above 20x and EBITDA interest coverage of less than 1x in
2014."


We believe the company's capital structure is likely unsustainable in the long-term
absent an improvement in met coal prices. We could lower our rating if met coal
prices further deteriorate, liquidity becomes further constrained, or negative cash flow
from operations is sustained. We could also lower the rating if the company were to
risk a breach of its financial covenant. This could occur if the company needed to
draw more than 30% on its revolving credit facility."

While the recent Standard and Poor's rating cut and commentary seem quite negative,
we don't think the forecasts are entirely pessimistic enough. For instance, Standard and
Poor's in June of last year had estimated leverage for 2014 "above 5x", now in 2014, it
is clear we are above 20x leverage, and in our view likely to get to around 30x leverage
by year end. We think with settlements for Met coal in Q3 are likely to be ~$120, which
will keep leverage metrics under significant pressure for the remainder of 2014.


Available liquidity and Altman Z-score analysis:


At a Morgan Stanley conference, Walter Energy listed available liquidity as $270.9
million plus cash equivalents of $404.7 million. However, there is one major caveat: the
$270.9 million is part of the $313.8 million revolver, and once it exceeds a draw of 30%
the senior secured leverage ratio covenant becomes effective. Therefore, the real
available liquidity is not the entire $270.9 million, but only $51.24 million remaining, as
they currently don't meet the senior secured leverage ratio covenants. Therefore, the
total available liquidity is not $676 million from the slide deck, but rather only $456
million.


"The Sixth Amendment also suspended the senior secured leverage ratio covenant
until the aggregate amount outstanding under the Revolver exceeds 30%, or $94.1
million, of the total revolving commitment of $313.8 million, and became effective
upon consummation of the offerings of the Add-on 2019 Notes (as defined below)
and the Second Lien Notes (as defined below), the repayment in full of the term loan
A and other customary conditions." 10-Q


"The required maximum senior secured leverage ratio covenant shall be the following
for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ending: June 30, 2014-8.0x;
September 30, 2014-7.5x; December 31, 2014-6.5x; March 31, 2015-5.5x; June 30,
2015-5.0x; September 30, 2015-4.5x; December 31, 2015 and each fiscal quarter
ending thereafter-3.75x." 10-Q

Walter's Altman Z-score appears to be in the middle of the range when benchmarking its
Z-score against its two bankrupt predecessors. For those not familiar with the Altman Z-
score, it has been developed into a solvency test over the past 40+ years, and is now
used by accountants, auditors, and lending institutions to measure credit worthiness.
The Altman Z-score has a successful history of predicting a bankruptcy event with over
80% accuracy one year before the event. There are three zones of discrimination a Z-
score above 2.99 = "safe zone", a Z-score between 1.81 and 2.99= "grey zone", and a
Z-score below 1.81 indicates a "distress zone".


In regards to Walter's Altman Z-score, if you adjust for some known revenue variables,
particularly the 16% decrease in coking coal prices quarter over quarter and the idling of
the Canadian mines, you would arrive at a substantially lower revenue figure for the next
twelve months. We think the revenue run-rate might be as low as $1.4 billion annually,
which would give Walter Energy an Altman Z-score (everything else constant) of .11,
matching James River's Z-score prior to filing Chapter 11.


We have called Walter Energy management on multiple occasions with questions
pertaining to the current operating environment. Unfortunately, we have not had any
responses from investor relations or management. We also have not had our questions
answered surrounding the deleted archives of old conference calls. While this in itself
may not be an issue, we find it suspect given the difficult operating environment Walter
is currently facing.

Conclusion:


Unfortunately, the acquisition of Western Coal Corp. by Walter Energy management in
2011 set the stage for significant financial hurdles that have jeopardized the solvency of
a decent unlevered business. There are significant headwinds facing Walter Energy
over the next 12-18 months. Some of these headwinds include restrictive take-or-pay
contracts, falling coking coal prices, idling of Canadian operations, negative fixed cost
leverage, and an unsustainable capital structure.

We believe sell side analysts have systematically ignored what Walter's business looks
like in a $120/MT coking coal environment. For instance, at a Q2 revenue run rate of
roughly $350 million, which is optimistic in our view, annual interest expense as a
percentage of sales would be ~23%. Unless Met coal prices were to improve drastically
(above $200) and stay elevated we think that Walter is facing a never ending uphill
battle. Even if Walter was able to get significantly higher Met coal prices, as in 2012 with
three of the four quarters having coking coal prices above $200, interest expense would
still be 3x operating income (excluding non-recurring charges) during FY2012.


The one bright spot for Walter and the reason it has not had to restructure sooner, are
the lower cost operations in Alabama. Jim Walter Mine #7 in Alabama is still cash
positive in the seaborne market. The problem is that none of the other mines are
remotely competitive at current coking coal prices. Walter's key issue is not the amount
of its reserves, but the incremental cost of production. The firm is asset heavy and cash
poor at the exact moment when it needs a streamlined cost structure. The upcoming Q2
conference call should shed light on the future structure of the business as well as the
legacy costs associated with the idled mines.


We agree with Standard and Poor's that Walter's long-term capital structure is
unsustainable. In the event of a Met coal recovery, we still think Walter will have difficulty
making any headway on its massively over-leveraged balance sheet. Debt maintenance
alone this year will be roughly 75% of the company's total market capitalization. To say
Walter has an uphill battle, is the understatement of the year. After all, even the
underwriter is betting against a recovery.
