GSX Techedu Inc. – Grizzly Research Presents Smoking 
Gun Evidence of Fraud
Grizzly Research LLC published a bearish research report on GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE:GSX) on February 25th, 
2020. Please find our research report here. A series of events have occured since: 


Company Update on GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE:GSX)


• The company gave multiple conflicting responses to
allegations leveled by us, and later by other short sellers.
In the meantime, we procured what we deem further
definitive evidence that demonstrates GSX’s false and
misleading statements.


• We have continued our research and analysis, and
have discovered what we believe is comprehensive
first-hand data that originates from GSX themselves
that shows the real enrollment count of students, as 
opposed to calculations that derive this number. In our 
opinion, this amounts to definitive proof of GSX’s fraud, 
and shows that GSX publicly claimed student enroll-
ment count and revenue are inflated by approxi-
mately 900%.


• Our report contains technical instructions and a
video guide showing how anyone can replicate our
findings. We urge investors and regulators to look into
this matter in immediately because GSX will likely try to
cover up its tracks now that we have exposed the meth-
odology of its fraud.


• We have also reviewed detailed evidence that
confirms that GSX appears to be conducting illegal
marketing activities on a massive scale. We believe
the company's core marketing strategy is built around
identity theft.


• We obtained records from a third party vendor in
China that alleges that it was paid by GSX to supply GSX
with fake WeChat IDs and national IDs. We confirmed the 
authenticity of these documents, including wire trans-
fers between GSX and the vendor.


• Our analysis of this data suggests that GSX bought
over 200,000 fake WeChat Accounts. We sampled 3,000
accounts, most of which we could identify as GSX teach-
ers/tutors. These practices are illegal, we expect Chinese
regulators to step in soon.


• We cover numerous other wrongdoings in this
report. We believe that GSX will not be able to credibly
defend itself against the numerous allegations that we
now confirmed with definitive proof. Other short sellers
have started to wise up on GSX’s fraudulent behavior,
and we believe the market and regulators are soon to
follow.

Company Update on GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE:GSX)


Definitive Evidence of Highly Inflated Top line Revenue 


A decade ago during the era that is now called “The 
China Hustle”, when a Chinese company with ground 
operation committed fraud, a site visit would reveal 
much valuable information. For Internet-based compa-
nies with little or no physical footprint, it is arguably 
harder to gather key metrics. The approach we took is 
to track GSX’s “digital” footprint, or more specifically, 
the data communication between GSX’s applications 
and servers through its APIs.


We discovered an API offered by Gaotu Ketang. The API 
was intended to provide course searches (we will refer 
to it as the course search API) 
, i.e. users can enter a subject 
name (English, Chinese, 
Math, Physics etc.), a grade 
level (first grade, second 


True revenues and student count are only 
11% of what GSX suggests to US Investors. Why Gaotu Ketang is So Important


GSX has claimed that majority of their revenue comes 
from Gaotu Ketang, contributing close to 70% of the 
total revenue.  Gaotu mainly focuses on the K-12 
education, the largest revenue segment of GSX. 
Though the company never disclosed how many 
enrollments Gaotu accounts for, due to the similar 
prices charged on Gaotu’s courses, it is safe to say that 
Gaotu should at least account for 70% of the compa-
ny’s enrollments. 


June 2nd 2020


Since our initial publication short sellers Muddy Waters 
and Citron Research have put forth web traffic analysis 
that suggests GSX student counts are vastly inflated. 


Our analysis is completely different. By using Gao-
tu’s own publicly accessible API, one can see the real 
student count and revenues for each class directly. 
Note that the list of classes obtained from the API is 
more comprehensive compared to the website and 


app course center (
选课中心 ) results. 
The API captures all 
enrollable classes,

grade, high school freshman etc.) or a season (spring, 
summer fall, or winter class) to find the matching 
courses. We will cover our methodology in detail in 
the next section and Appendix A. This methodology 
returned not only reveals basic information about, but 
also the exact enrollment count for each course.


We discovered that, to our utter amazement, the true 
number of enrollment and revenue are merely 11% of 
what the company suggests. We tracked the enroll-
ment numbers returned by the  API for over a period of 
two weeks and conducted numerous experiments to 
verify the reliability and authenticity of the enrollment 
and revenue numbers.

ie. in different formats. 


Definitive Evidence of Highly Inflated Top line Revenue


API 2:  https://api.gaotu100.com/teacher/search?page_num-


The particular API we use to gather information about 
enrollment count is API 2. It is presumably used by teach-
ers to search existing courses. A particular set of parame-
ters needs to be provided for it to return results, as 
illustrated in the Figure below. 


When you insert a query word such as  (First 
Grade), the API returns a set of courses related to “First 
Grade”. The information related to each course is compre-
hensive. Among them, a few notable ones are:


• Teacher name
• Course start and end time
• Price for the course
• Course enrollment count


Here is what the returned information looks like. The 
data returned is in a format called JSON. What’s 
shown here is reformatted to help readability. Enroll-


ment count and price fields are highlighted. 


Given the strong incentive for GSX to hide this piece of 
data from the public, we believe that as soon as this 
report is published, GSX will redact the enrolled_count 
information from the API, or remove this particular API 
altogether. We have also made a video [0:00 - 0: 52] to 
show you the process (see page 6). 


June 2nd 2020


We use Gaotu’s API (Application programming interface) to do that. An API, is just like a web URL, except that it 
returns information for machines to read, as opposed to a web-page humans can read. For Gaotu, the web-page 
URLs start with www.gaotu.com while its APIs start with api.gaotu100.com. For instance, you can view the informa-
tion for a particular course via web-page, https://www.gaotu100.com/learn/4529082895664128. 


A computer program can get the same set of information via API1. The purpose of an API is to provide unified infor-
mation for many applications, such as mobile applications and modern web pages.

Definitive Evidence of Highly Inflated Top line Revenue
How Do We Track the Enrollment 
Counts of All Courses Over Time?
Depending on the search keyword, the course search 
API returns a set of matching courses, along with their 
enrollment counts. 


The following process ensures we track ALL of Gaotu’s 
courses, so we can accurately track Gaotu’s revenue. 


The comprehensive coverage is straightforward to 
accomplish: 
Our set of keywords covers all the grades (from first 
grade to last year high school, including college 
entrance exam prep, i.e. 


), on all the subjects (i.e. 


), over all the school years (i.e. ). In 
practice, using a subset of these keywords should be 
enough to cover all the courses listed.  We lean on the 
safe side and use all the keywords here to ensure our 


analysis is comprehensive.


Our capturing job ran approximately every 12 minutes, 
over the full set of keywords. In other words, our capture 
of Gaotu is accurate and comprehensive, and we are 
confident that our analysis does not omit any classes. We 
also confirmed that there were no new addition of Q2 
courses, hence we believe we obtained full coverage 
of Q2 courses. 


Further, by tracking and analyzing the enrollment data 
over time, we were able to observe that all Q2 enroll-
ment numbers are flat-lined. The flat lines are to be 
expected: All Q2 courses have already started (they start 


earliest in April and end latest in June). We are 
already half way past May, and users are typically 
not interested in enrolling into classes that are 
already in session. Hence these Q2 courses bring 
in little to no new enrollments and revenue in 
the remaining Q2. 


The flat-lined enrollments for all Q2 courses are 
confirmation of the reliability of our calculation. 
Depending on potential new enrollments or 
course cancellations, the number at the end of the 
quarter may change slightly from what we 
captured here, but the flat-line here clearly 
suggests that the change will be within a few 
percentage points. We are confident that the 
picture is already clear for Gaotu’s Q2 based on the 
data we captured here -- an abysmal quarter.

Fidelity Check of Price and Enrollment Count
To ensure data fidelity, we compared all the prices we get from the Search API and the prices displayed online and 
in the mobile app -- they match 100%. Considering that users can bargain to get a lower price, we are overestimat-
ing GSX’s revenue, by using the full listed price of the courses.

To verify enrolled_count is indeed the enrollment count for the course , we designed a process to prove, definitively, 
that enrolled_count is indeed the actual enrollment count for a course.


The idea is simple: we purchase (i.e. enroll into) a set of classes on Gaotu, and pull the enrollment count immediate-
ly before and after, and see if the number is indeed increased by 1. If enroll_count always increases by one when a 
new student enrolls, then it is an accurate reflection of enrollment number, similar to how tally counter works to 
keep track of how many people are in a concert.


The results show how enrolled_count increased by 1 when we enrolled into the class. Correspondingly, the 
left_count decreased by one, presumably indicating that there is one less slot left for students to register.


June 2nd 2020


A few things we did to ensure our experiment is reliable:
- We intentionally picked a low traffic time, such as 2-5am Beijing local time, when it is very 
unlikely anyone else would enroll into courses.
- Before we enroll into the class, we pull enrollment count a few times to ensure that there is no 
one enrolling into that class.
- We enrolled into the course via either Gaotu mobile app or Gaotu’s web interface to ensure the 
number is not for tracking platform-specific enrollment. 
- We conducted the experiments multiple times over a time span of a week on a set of randomly 
selected courses to further rule out any possibility of coincidences. 


We have recorded in video as a live demonstration on how this enrolled_count increases by 1 when we enroll into 
class. Please see video [0 : 52, 2 : 50]

Definitive Evidence of Highly Inflated Top line Revenue
Fidelity Check of Price and Enrollment Count


June 2nd 2020


The authenticity of our findings are self-enforcing since 
GSX has gone through huge efforts to hide any informa-
tion related to class enrollments. Not only did they inten-
tionally remove all enrollment counts on Gaotu and 
Genshuixue’s individual paying courses, (only disclosing 
the enrollment count for free classes for marketing 
purposes), but added another layer of security by 
removed it from commonly used APIs. To show how 
Gaotu intentionally tried to hide anything related to 
enrollment, we tracked two generations of its API related 
to the exposure of another related number in the API. 
See Appendix B for more evidence and technical details 
on our findings. 


Now that we validated the authenticity of enroll-
ment count and price data from Gaotu, we present 
the whole picture on Gaotu’s Q2 revenue. 


Here is a sample of Gaotu’s Q2 courses and their 
revenue. This sample and the full list are based on 
the full catalog of courses we captured on May 10th, 
2020, at 8:00:44 am, Beijing time. As of today, we 
haven’t seen any new Q2 courses being added, and 
don’t expect there to be, considering the duration of 
the Q2 classes we see in the API. In fact, Gaotu has 


started to remove Q2 courses from the API since May 14th. Meanwhile, we believe no Q2 courses were removed 
prior to May 9th. Hence May 9th data is a good representation of the full Q2 picture. 


In Q1 earning’s call, GSX gave a Q2 guidance of net revenue between RMB1,526 million and RMB1,556 million.
GSX repeatedly claimed that Gaotu represents a majority of its revenue. In their rebuttal to Citron’s report, GSX 
claimed that Citron’s report “proved” its numbers, implying that Gaotu represents about 70% of its total revenue. 
Thus, the company was giving out guidance expecting about RMB 1,063 million net revenue from Gaotu.


The enrollment number from Gaotu contradicts GSX’s reported revenue by a large margin. It is worth emphasiz-
ing that the number is not an estimation. It is Gaotu’s own internal numbers, from its own API, that contra-
dicts with the reported numbers. The numbers reveal that Gaotu only generated RMB 116 million net revenue in 
Q2, off an abysmal 71,609 paid enrollment (or about RMB 1,646 per enrollment). Gaotu is only achieving 11% of its 
suggested revenue in the guidance.


Gaotu’s Actual, Abysmal Q2 Revenue


7


We also have definitive evidence that Gaotu has 
started to inflate the enrolled_count internally for 
all it’s Q3 courses. (See Appendix C). Since Gaotu 
didn’t expect to expose this number to the public, 
enrollment count, for all its worth, is an internal KPI 
for Gaotu. We cannot imagine why the company is 
not even honest internally.  Not being honest on this 
key internal metric can only hurt its own teachers, 
partners and rank-and-file employees, and any 
possibility for real business growth. We believe GSX 
is rotten to its core.

Definitive Evidence of Highly Inflated Top line Revenue


June 2nd 2020


In this section, we show definitive evidence that suggests 
genshuixue.com is systematically creating fake user 
accounts using bots. We present two pieces of evidence in 
summary and a detailed technical discussion on the bot 
behavior in the Appendix D & E. 


- First, genshuixue’s user number growth follows a 
perfect linear pattern. This is implausible for organic 
user growth, as they naturally fluctuate over time. 
- Second, genshuixue’s user number are automated to 
reach certain targets: If user growth slows down for as 
short as 15 seconds, the speed of account creation would 
accelerate in the next 15 seconds to “catch-up”.


It is evident that organic user growth would fluctuate with 
time, and there is unavoidable randomness to it. For exam-
ple, more users tend to register during the day than in the 
middle of the night. A marketing campaign can drive users 
to register, and the effect would wear off. All these effects 
add spikes and troughs to the organic user growth curve. 
In short, the user growth curve is not going to be a straight 
line, and these ups and downs are opportunities for a 
company to learn and adjust its user growth strategies.


However, genshuixue’s user growth curve looks like a 
straight line. The bots work like clock-work to create 
accounts. The graph below shows the perfect linear rate of 
user growth on genshuixue.com, plotted using thousands 
of data points, at a sampling rate of every 20 seconds.
We refer readers to the Appendix D for technical details on 
how we tracked user counts.


The next graph shows the zoomed-in linear user growth 
on genshuixue.com in 1 hour 45 minutes. The “notch” 
patterns are where the bots had technical issues (thus the 
flattened user count for 5-10 minutes) and then caught up.


From May 8 to May 21, we tracked the creation of about  


Automated, Constant-Speed User 
Creation at Genshuixue.com


790,000 user profiles on genshuixue.com. We conducted 
an extensive sampling to try to find any signs of real user 
accounts. Regrettably we didn’t find a single user account 
that we could identify as a real user (simply due to the 
overwhelming amount of fake accounts). In fact, when 


Zoomed-in linear user growth on Genshuixue.com in 1 hour 45 minutes. The 
notches are quickly self-corrected to return to perfect linearity.


we tried to create an account, though it is in the system 
and that we can make comments using the account 
profile, sampling is akin to finding a needle in a haystack 
due to the swarm of fake profiles being created. Based on 
this finding, we have a very strong suspicion that 
although genshuixue.com has added 790,000 user regis-
trations from May 8 to May 21, less than  0.01% (i.e. 79) of 
them are real.


This fraud is unprecedented. User growth is one of the 
most important and the most closely watched metrics of 
any Internet and TechEdu business. It is a key metric for 
calculating marketing ROI, user conversion, teacher/tutor 
load forecasting and hiring, revenue forecasting, as well 
as technical infrastructure and streaming bandwidth 
planning. 


The fact that constant user creation has no sign of slow-
ing down confirms to us that this fraud is organized and 
can only come from the top. We are convinced that the 
CEO and the CFO are fully aware of the user creation 
shenanigans, and are enabling it, while telling the world 
that integrity is their core value.


As we will show later, we have evidence that genshuixue 
is illegally purchasing WeChat accounts from other 
parties to create fake profiles on its platform. We want to 
alert auditors that genshuixue’s user growth is fabricated. 
We also want to alert Tencent/WeChat of the huge breach 
of WeChat profiles led by genshuixue. 


We have decided to open source our code, for the public to 
see the account creation fraud in action, see the Appendix  A 
for more information.


Almost perfect Linear relationship between time and user growth from May 
17th to May 21st, 2020.

Problems with Weishi
Weishi is another platform operated by GSX. Per F-20, 


 “Our main mobile apps include Genshuixue, Gaotu and Weishi.”


 Unsurprisingly, we have found Weishi to be equally untrustworthy .


We monitored the platform in 2020 and discovered that the application updated its entire course content in April 
2020. Prior to April 2020, the courses offered on Weishi were completely different from its current course offerings, 
and included very few paying courses. Ironically, of the three paying courses, two were listed as duplicates. 


Following April 2020, Weishi’s courses were completely updated. However, similar to Gaotu, the majority of the 
course enrollments happen at the very beginning of the courses. We continued to monitor the following perfor-
mance of the courses and noticed that enrollment counts barely changed. 


However, Gaotu’s constant enrollments can be explained by courses supposedly ”being live streaming” and that 
they are promoted way before courses even starts. However, we do not see any similar marketing approaches on 
Weishi. In fact, according to our analysis, most, if not all, of the course are pre-recorded. So there isn’t a good expla-
nation why enrollments would suddenly stop once the course has been promoted for a week.


This finding highly corroborates our previous findings and suggests that the company is artificially inflating the 
enrollments. However, perhaps due to the Weishi platform being the least important of the three, GSX has failed to 
make an effort to even hide these numbers, in fact, readers can validate these number directly on their mobile 
platform. 


Course offerings following April 2020. We see alarmingly similar trends where mass enrollments happen when the 
course is posted and immediately turns into a “zombie state” where little to no new enrollments occur. In fact, we 
suspect less than 200 real students enrolled in the following 1 month.

Cheap Recruiting Attempts Using Lies and Criminal 
Activities
The other piece of puzzle to the high growth high 
profitability story GSX has been pitching its investors is 
its abnormally low cost structure.


Former COO of EDU Xinzeng Pan previously stated: “I 
have always wondered how GSX was able to maintain 
hyper growth while obtaining profitability, while the 
rest of the industry is operating at a lost.”


GSX’s core marketing activities are illegal 
and employ massive amounts of fake 


identities 


GSX CEO Larry has 
expressed on multiple 
occasions that GSX is best 
at how to spend money. It 
is because of this lean 
management and frugality 
that operating costs are so low. However, we have 
found evidence that GSX has been conducting 
illegal activities to reduce the costs of sales.


GSX claims to benefit from its ability to acquire 
students at low costs. While competitors spend close 
to 2000 RMB per student, GSX spends merely 1000 
RMB per its own disclosure. Having been doubted 
numerous times on this, Larry expressed on earnings 
calls that external sourcing costs will eventually 
return to industry average (indicating that their 
profitability will be decreasing), but internal sourcing 
costs are what contributes to high profitability. 


However, the internal sourcing methods imple-
mented by GSX are illegal.


GSX has been heavily abusing WeChat platforms, 
WeChat groups in the form of “ ” or “


” (hitherto referred to as WeChat Method) for 
internal sourcing. External sourcing is advertisement 
using other platforms such as Douyin, Weibo and 
other platforms.


10


Unlike external meth-
ods, WeChat method is 
a relatively low-cost 
method in that mini-
mal fees have to be 
paid to the advertise-


ment platform. In addition, WeChat is the widely used 
platform in China. GSX can target WeChat users by 
either promoting their business through “


” (WeChat Official Accounts), where people can 
subscribe to their official accounts, or by adding 
WeChat users to WeChat Groups. On occasions, they 
might even become their WeChat Friends and gain 
access to a private informational space called “
” (WeChat Moments) where intimate friends share 
information with other friends.


Advertise through 
close to 100 WeChat 
Public Accounts


Publish articles to 
promote user growth


Promote free classes
Get invited to 
WeChat groups


Add tutor and 
teachers as friends


Participate in free            
classes


Enroll in paying 
classes after joining 
in free ones


Final payment for 
classes


This is GSX ‘s supposedly “low cost high return” advertisement strategy. Starting from WeChat Public Accounts to WeChat Groups to 
WeChat friends and eventually to payment. This has proven to be a low cost, but borderline illegal technique and is one of the dirty secrets 
of the online education industry.

The WeChat method is considered as a non-mainstream method due to its numerous restrictions, and is mainly 
used by Grey/Black (Illegal) industries such as lottery, gambling, plastic surgery, etc. The two most prominent 
reasons why this method is not widely used are:


 1.       It is detrimental to WeChat Platform’s core values and interest, as it turns a semi-private/secluded platform 
into a commercial tool for advertisements.
 2.       It requires a large number of WeChat IDs. However, WeChat IDs are heavily regulated and monitored. Almost 
all WeChat IDs are “ ” (certified by real identities). Misuse of WeChat IDs for excessive advertisements and 
other non-appropriate measures will likely result in “ ” (banning) of the WeChat accounts.


We have received concrete evidence that GSX has been illegally purchasing massive amounts of WeChat 
accounts, personal information and engaging third parties to assist them in conducting illegal activities. 


Here’s a list of the commonly used terminology in this grey industry:
a.     Identity Package ( ) The identity package includes name, national ID number 
(similar to SSN), bank account number and phone number tied to bank account number. 
GSX purchases Identity packages to validate WeChat accounts and gain full access to 
WeChat’s functionalities including joining large groups and conducting transactions. It is 
important to know that each person (identity) can only have up to 5 WeChat accounts. 


B.   Promotional Accounts ( ) Accounts often occupied by instructors, tutors to 
promote business, maintain client relationships. The account is typically used for a long 
time.      


c.    Cultivated Accounts ( ) Accounts that are mass farmed to imitate real human 
behaviors such as sending messages with friends, spending money, etc. The accounts are 
cultivated to fool WeChat into believing that a real person is behind the WeChat account 
and is also validated using personal information. This process can take up to 1 year. GSX 
can use these accounts as promotional accounts after purchase. These accounts have 
higher initial costs but are less likely to get banned. Note that the personal information 
used to validate these accounts are almost all illegally acquired.  


d.    Personal Accounts ( ) Accounts that are actually used by a real person for 3 
months to 3 years before being sold to GSX. GSX can use these accounts for long-term 
Promotional Accounts. The accounts are already validated by the previous owners’ person-
al information. 


e.     Blank Accounts ( ) Accounts with minimal personal information. Typically used 
for sending group messages, bundling, adding and spamming friends, and other aggres-
sive advertising approaches. These accounts are extremely short-lived and are constantly 
banned by WeChat platform. GSX can choose to purchase other materials to turn blank 
accounts into promotional accounts. 


f.      Account Maintenance ( ) All WeChat Accounts face potential of being banned. 
This is especially true for Promotional Accounts and even more so for Blank Accounts. 
After an account is banned, there are certain ways to unban the account such as by having 
friends on the banned account verify certain information. The process of unbanning the 
accounts is commonly called Account Maintenance. GSX routinely employs such mainte-
nance parties to help maintain their purchased accounts.

We Obtained Evidence from Industry Insiders


We have been in contact and consulted with industry insiders. We confirmed that one company (Party A) sold IDs 
to GSX and illegally maintains accounts for them. Our industry contact confirmed that GSX has already purchased 
over 50,000 Promotional Accounts and 150,000 to 200,000 Blank Accounts in total. We have received and 
confirmed the authenticity of documents that show:


1. Over 3,000 Promotional Accounts, where GSX has employed Party A to maintain
these accounts. According to party A, this number was 4,500 in the first half of 2018.
The list includes a comprehensive overview of WeChat IDs, WeChat Names and WeChat 
Personal Descriptions.


2. Incriminating evidence that GSX purchased large quantities of Identity Packages


3. Bank wire statement that GSX subsidiaries “Beijing BaiJiaHuLian Technology Co.,
Ltd.”and “Beijing Lexuebang Network Technology Co., Ltd.” routinely engaged external
parties for the procurement of WeChat IDs, maintenance services and Identity Packag-
es since early 2019.


Details of such evidence follows:


Evidence 1: Below is a snapshot of 33 sample WeChat accounts that are part of a list of over 3,000 WeChat 
accounts that GSX purchased and Party A maintains for GSX. 


Note that names displayed on WeChat can be changed if GSX wanted to change them. In addition, we were also 
told that GSX could also choose to close the searchable function, meaning certain accounts that showed informa-
tion could become unsearchable later.

We conducted thorough analysis on the data and discovered that:


• Of the 3000 WeChat accounts, only 1355 remain searchable (unbanned). This goes to show how badly 
WeChat suppresses the use of Promotional Accounts
• Of the 1355, 1282 can be identified to be Tutors or Teachers. 
• Of the 1282, 883 can be identified to be attributable to GSX either through disclosed brands or undisclosed 
brands. 
• The majority of the teachers are from Gaotu and GSX with Gaotu accounting for around 70% of total teachers.


We discovered some other brands that are operated by GSX but are not widely known brands,  such as Beike and 
Heya. We followed their promotional trail and were led back to GSX. To our surprise the GSX tutor didn’t even 
know who Beike Classroom was! This is one of the very brands that referenced us to GSX. However, we found zero 
mention of such brands within any GSX filings, which could also be due to the fact that Beike and Heya are sub 
brands of Beijing Genshuixue Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing Lexuebang Network Technology Co., Ltd., which are 
disclosed subsidiaries of GSX. 


We also noticed that Beike was actually sued by CCTV for unauthorized usage of brands. There are also numerous 
other allegations against Beike. There seems to be a pattern, GSX was recently sued by VIPKid and is threatened 
by Youdao over intellectual property infringement.  


Evidence 1: Below is a snapshot of 33 sample WeChat accounts that are part of a list of over 3,000 WeChat 
accounts that GSX purchased and Party A maintains for GSX.

Below are screenshots of conversations between GSX’s main contact person Mr. Bean “ “ ( XX, phone number: 
1355207xxxx) and the party selling and maintaining Promotional Accounts. We provide a few conversations to 
illustrate how the process is conducted. For more evidence please see Appendix F.


R E P O R T S


1. Mr. Bean inquires the quality of WeChat accounts and buy testing samples
2. Having verified the quality, Mr. Bean then continues to purchase such accounts at larger quantities.
3. Having purchased the accounts, the accounts are transferred live to GSX. 


Notice that two teachers from Jinyou Xuetang, a sub brand of GSX participated directly in the group 
chat and the purchased Promotional Account log in process.

Evidence 1.1: Conversation history documenting the process --- A Look Behind the Scenes of How GSX 
Really Operates
Below are conversations between Mr. Bean and Party A for the maintenance of such purchased accounts. For more 
evidence please see Appendix G.


R E P O R T S


According to Party A, there are over 50,000 such Promotional Accounts used in 
GSX operations. In addition, 150,000 to 200,000 Blank Accounts were also trans-
acted in a similar fashion. We believe these indicate that GSX is clearly conducting 
illegal business activities as it violates not only protocols set forth by WeChat 
platform but also is an infringement of personal identity laws and false advertise-
ment.

Evidence 2:  Incriminating evidence that GSX 
illegally purchased and used Identity Packages
Below is a sample of Identity Packages with four differ-
ent kinds of information: Phone Number, Name, 
National ID, and Bank Account Number. We don’t show 
the last four digits of the phone number, national ID 
and bank account number, and didn’t show the last 
name of each individual for privacy purpose. However, 
full information is available for regulators’ review. 


R E P O R T S


We obtained a detailed list of Identity Packages GSX 
illegally purchased and have screenshots of conversa-
tions where they use these Identity Packages for the 
verification process of their Promotional Accounts. We 
speculate the company might be using this informa-
tion for even worse purposes such as order brushing, 
as revenue from these purchased Identity Packages 
will go largely unnoticed in the eyes of auditors. 
According to Party A, GSX has purchased 30,000 to 
50,000 Identity Packages similar to these. 


Evidence 2.1:  Conversations documenting 
Purchase & Use of Identity Packages by GSX
Below are screenshot of GSX purchasing such Identity 
Packages for 150 RMB per piece. For further evidence 
please see Appendix H.


Party A verified that Justun was representing GSX in 
purchasing, in this case, 600 Identity Packages. This informa-
tion is later used to verify WeChat IDs for them to become more 
suitable for promotional services.

We have obtained bank wire statements between Party A and GSX subsidiaries Beijing BaiJiaHuLian Technolo-
gy Co., Ltd. and Beijing Lexuebang Network Technology Co., Ltd.  routinely employed external parties for the 
procurement of WeChat IDs, maintenance services and Identity Packages since early 2019.


Below is a portion of the list of transactions between GSX and Party A. 


Evidence 3: Bank wire statements between GSX and Party A for aforementioned services


Notice that GSX previously blatantly used their own subsidiaries to directly conduct in such transactions. However, 
following our initial report, the company started to cover its tracks by employing a third party to issue payments, 
as indicated by the top two records from ZHAO WU. We highly suspect that ZHAO WU was the supervisor who 
worked at Beijing BaiJiaHuLian Technology Co., Ltd. from Mar 14th 2019 to Feb 4th 2020. We also confirmed with 
Party A that these payments are indeed still from GSX for services such as the procurement of Promotional, Blank 
Accounts, Account Maintenance etc. This behavior at best is trying to cover their tracks for such transactions, at 
worst is blatantly shifting expenses away from the public Co. We suspect there are many more such events 
going on.

Evidence 3 Bank Wire Statements between GSX and Party A for aforementioned services


中


According to “General principles of civil law of the people's Republic of China”, No.111, “Personal 
information is protected by law. Any organization and personnel must legally acquire such 
information and protect its integrity and safety, they must not illegally collect, process, purchase 
and provide such information.


As a public firm, GSX has clearly violated such laws by purchasing and using personal information for marketing 
purposes. There are many media reports (link 1, link 2) in China that discuss how the purchase of personal informa-
tion including phone number, name, national ID, address, etc., is a serious crime. 


This is one of the main reasons why we urge and why we think regulators should step in. This kind of activity 
should be immediately stopped and investigated, and, as a public listed company, people from the company 
involved in this kind of activity should be held accountable.

Conclusion


R E P O R T S


We believe GSX can simply not to be trusted; The company has been fueling their growth miracle with nothing but 
lies and criminal activities. The spotlight is now on the company, other short sellers have started to wise up on 
GSX’s fraudulent behavior, and we believe the market and regulators are soon to follow.


We have laid out in this report evidence, not allegations regarding two key aspects: 


 (1) We prove that student enrollment count is vastly inflated by 9x. 
 (2) GSX is conducting illegal marketing activities on a massive scale. 


We expect sooner or later US regulators will be forced to address the first point, while we expect Chinese regulators 
to have a close look into GSX’s illegal marketing activities.

Appendix B- Evidences on Gaotu trying to hide every piece of information related to 
class enrollment


June 2nd 2020


To show how Gaotu intentionally tried to hide anything related to enrollment, we tracked two generations of its API related to 
the exposure of another related number: the number of slots left in a class (subclazz_left_count) is present in the version 6 
of an API, but subsequently removed in the version 7 of the API.


API v6: http://api.gaotu100.com/course/v6/detail?course_id=4738658381173760


In Version 6 (V6), subclazz_left_count is exposed to the public.


In V7, subclazz_left_count is no longer shown to the public. Subclazz_left_count can be used to infer the enrollment chang-
es on Gaotu, because enrollment leads an increment of enrolled_count and an decrement of subclazz_left_count.


API v7: http://api.gaotu100.com/course/v7/detail?course_id=4738658381173760

Appendix C- Evidence on Gaotu inflating enrollment count to newly added courses 
to its inventory


June 2nd 2020


Tracking Gaotu’s whole inventory and their enrollment counts over time led us to other findings that, not surprisingly, show Gaotu is a total 
sham. How it works is very simple: about every ten minutes, we take a snapshot of Gaotu’s course inventory. By comparing the information 
between two snapshots, we can track when new courses were added to Gaoto’s inventory, as well when expired courses were removed from 
the inventory.


We zoom in on two inventory snapshots that our program captured. They are Gaotu’s full inventory (including enrollment counts), taken at 
17:42:25 (Snapshot A) and 17:54:19 (Snapshot B) Beijing time, respectively, on May 11, 2020.


These two snapshots are approximately 12 minutes apart. Looking at the differences between snapshot A and snapshot B, we found 14 new 
Q3 courses in snapshot B but not in snapshot A, indicating that Gaotu added these courses to their inventory between 17:42 and 17:54.


To illustrate the addition of courses, we use a program called “diff” to compare the differences side by side between snapshot A and B. In the 
figure below, the left side(from snapshot A) is blank and the right side (from snapshot B) has about a course. This side-by-side comparison is 
a common way for information comparison. In this case it means this particular course is added to Gaotu sometime after 17:42:25 (thus not 
in snapshot A) but before 17:54:19 (thus in snapshot B).


As you can see, at its first appearance in Gaotu’s inventory, this course’s enrolled_count is already at 2344 to start. Put it plainly, within 12 
minutes, Gaotu not only added a brand new course SKU, but also did a doorbuster sale to students and parents between 5:42pm and 
5:54pm Beijing time, when most people are still at work or commuting.


According to this data, 2344 (a peculiar and easy to type number) students would purchase and pay RMB 1099 yuan ($157 USD) within the 
10 minutes after this course is released. Note that these courses don’t even begin until July! At this rate of sales, we could only imagine how 
Gaotu courses can overtake Apple as the best selling company.


Ironically, as we track the enrollment number of the course in the next hour, day, and week, the enrollment number immediately flat lined, 
even in the time window of 5:54 PM - 6:04 PM. There are two explanations, one is that somehow all these 2344 real parents and students 
found the course at 5:42 PM earliest, and rushed through the finishing line to pay the course before 5:54 PM the latest. They were so efficient 
that all transactions were finalized before 5:54PM, and no students enrolled into the course for the next 10 days. The other explanation is 
that this number is completely fabricated at course creation time. Which one is more plausible?


Again, since Gaotu didn’t expect to expose this number to the public, enrollment count, for all its worth, is an internal KPI for Gaotu. We 
cannot imagine why the company is not even honest internally.  Not being honest on this key internal metric can only hurt its own teachers, 
partners and rank-and-file employees, and any possibility for real business growth. We believe GSX is rotten to its root.

Appendix D- Determining Genshuixue’s user count and zoning in user profile cre-
ation


June 2nd 2020


To store and uniquely identify user profiles in a back-end system, each user profile needs to be assigned a unique ID. It is 
similar to the idea of a social security number. When a new user is created and added to the system, a new user id is created 
for that user.


A popular, yet technically unsophisticated practice in back-end engineering is to assign ids incrementally. For example, when 
the first user is created, he or she will get id = 1. The second will be assigned id = 2, so on and so forth. Genshuixue’s back-end 
database, MySQL, has native support for this id assignment strategy called AUTO_INCREMENT.


Here is our idea from a high level: we probe genshuixue and ask its system, say, whether user id “12345” exists. If it exists, we’d 
be getting a profile page back by visiting https://m.genshuixue.com/x/12345. If 12345 does not exist, we’d get blank results. 
When we get blank results, we can try 12344 (going lower). If 12345 exists, we’d try 12346 (going higher). 


This way, we can probe for the biggest id in the system. After that, we can track how new ids are created, by asking the same 
questions, starting from the biggest id known to us from the last probe. For example, if the last id is 12355, we’d start probing 
12356 and so on, until we find a new id that is the last id at this moment, say 12375. The delta between two consecutive 
probes, or 12375-12355=20, is the number of new users created in the time window between two probes.


There are two technical caveats to this. 


The first is that GSX has decided to “encrypt” its ids, meaning the query used to fetch user profiles is https://m.genshuix-
ue.com/x/<encrypted_id>. Probing with an unencrypted id would not return meaningful results, thus preventing sequential 
probing. It is a common practice, because probing is not a new idea. 


We discovered the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt these ids. Once we know how to encrypt and decrypt them, we send 
encrypted ids to the API to probe, while increasing or decreasing the real ID depending on the direction of probing.


The second caveat is we use a technique called binary search to locate the last id each time, as opposed to the simple sequen-
tial probing. This improves algorithm efficiency and reduces the load on GSX’s server. The code we share is using binary search 
probing.

Appendix E- Bot behavior and flavors in creating fake accounts


June 2nd 2020


There are three flavors of these fake accounts, indicating three different bot teams or strategies in creating fake accounts. 


Bot flavor 1: Female profiles without avatar


In this flavor, profiles created are all marked as gender: female ( : ), with a default female avatar. Their profile names are 
random nouns in Chinese. None of these names are real Chinese names (all real Chinese names use a finite set of family 
names) despite the fact that they are all in Chinese characters. 


Bot flavor 2: Female profiles with phone numbers that looks real


In this flavor, again, profiles created are all female, with a default female avatar. Their usernames look like a masked phone 
number, giving the impression that they registered with a mobile phone number. However, our statistical analysis on the first 
three digits and the last four digits reveal that they cannot be real. 


We found the probabilistic distribution of the first three digits (i.e. 131, 189, 187) being uniform. The first three digits are 
special -- they indicate the telecom provider. The probabilistic distribution sampled from a real set of mobile phone numbers 
is proportional to the user base of each telecom provider. For example, China Mobile has a much bigger user base than China 
Telecom. The uniform distribution indicates that these phone numbers were generated using a random number generator, as 
opposed to an actual phone number owned by users.  


The digits appearing in the last four positions are also uniformly distributed, according to our analysis. In reality, Chinese users 
have strong cultural preferences to pick or avoid certain numbers (such as 8 or 4), and it is highly unlikely that the appearance 
of digits are uniformly distributed. The only possibility is that these numbers are randomly generated to look like a phone 
number, as opposed to being a real phone number.

Appendix E- Bot behavior and flavors in creating fake accounts


June 2nd 2020


Bot flavor 3: Female profiles with mismatched, low-res (132x132px) profile pictures.


In this flavor, again, profiles created are all tagged with gender: female. They do have an avatar that makes it look real. Howev-
er, half of these avatars and names would clearly indicate it is a profile of a male user, while the gender of these created 
accounts are all female.


All profile pictures are at an extremely low-res. We know these accounts are fake because when a real user creates an account 
via genshuixue or linking through WeChat, avatars would be created at the original resolution (square selfie is usually at or 
bigger than 1024x1024px these days), and thus impossible to have all 10,000 profiles we looked at all using 132x132px.
