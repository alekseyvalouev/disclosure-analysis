Global Sources: Latest Company Actions Speak Louder Than Words;
Extreme Caution Warranted

Introduction


On October 13, 2011 Spruce Point Capital Management issued a report (click here) that
indicated we had major concerns with Global Sources (Nasdaq: GSOL), a Chinese B2B
trade and media business. Our major points of concern are primarily focused on the
company’s weakening financial prospects, opaque financial reporting, and unusual
financial strategies at odds with its business model.


Recent Developments


The age-old saying “Actions Speak Louder Then Words” is particularly fitting to the
situation faced by Global Sources. Since the publication of our report, the company has
not made a prepared response or comment addressing the our conclusions. This has not
typically been the approach taken by management teams that have been highlighted by
bloggers, hedge funds, and other investors.


Take for example Silvercorp Metals (NYSE: SVM), which has taken its fraud allegations
very seriously, openly communicated with investors, repurchased shares, and formed an
independent committee that hired an outside forensic accountant to investigate matters
(SVM news). Another approach, used by Camelot Information Systems (NYSE: CIS), our
last target of investigation, was to hold a same-day investor conference call in an attempt
to quell investor’s fears and halt the stock from falling farther. Our concerns about
Camelot’s employee defections and business deterioration ultimately proved correct.


Is Global Source’s decision not to comment on our allegations a tacit acknowledgement
that our conclusions are correct, and the stock is worth nothing more than $2.50/share?
Based upon Global Source’s recent action to file a $300 million shelf prospectus on
Friday, October 28th, we think the answer is a resounding "Yes." The stated intention
of the filing is for “general corporate purposes” and does not appear to be justifiable on
any grounds. This is yet another “red flag” that has been typically observed by Chinese
RTOs: raise capital at any price and valuation before the market shuts and the game
ends.

ZST Digital Networks (Nasdaq: ZSTN) is a perfect example that illustrates our point. In
November 2010, we warned investors about our concerns with this company. (Source:
here). The company’s management did not address the conclusions we made in the
article. Instead, it proceeded to file a shelf registration for up to $50 million of capital on
January 7, 2011 (Source: here). At the time, ZSTN had a market capitalization of $80m,
and was reporting that it had $34m of cash on hand, and generating $18.5m of cash from
operations.


Put in context, ZST’s management was indicating to investors it was willing to dilute over
60% of its market capitalization while showing elsewhere that both its cash on the balance
sheet and cash from operations could more than cover the $50m shelf requirement.
Ironically, ZSTN then announced on January 28th, that it would purchase office space to
support its "growth" for $7.8m. (Source: here (.pdf)). Investors have since wised up to
ZST’s actions, and shares have declined almost 70% since the date of the shelf filing.


What could Global Sources possibly need up to $300 million of capital for? The answer is
not entirely clear, especially in light of the company’s SEC reported financials. The charts
below profile the company’s reported cash balances and free cash flow (cash from
operations less non-property capital expenditures). As clearly indicated by the charts,
Global Sources paints the picture to investors of a healthy company, with ample cash
resources and free cash flow to support the operation of its business and finance its
general corporate purposes.


Could the shelf filing be related to the Company’s recent and mysterious $50 million
acquisition of property in Shanghai to support its “growth?” (Source: here). The answer is
still not entirely clear because the company has yet to provide any information publicly to
investors on where the property is located and if the transaction has closed.

The $300 million mixed use shelf also appears to be an incredibly large amount by any
relative measure. We have analyzed its recent shelf size in comparison to other U.S. listed
Chinese RTOs in the table below and illustrated the results in the following charts. To
make the results comparable, we look at the ratio of the shelf size in comparison to each
company’s market capitalization, reported cash balance and cash from operations for the
period closest to the shelf’s filing date.


The results are quite striking. Global Sources is an outlier on nearly every metric we
analyze. The fact that the shelf size of $300m is greater than the company’s entire
market capitalization alone is cause for serious concern.

Comments (15)


The cumulative stock price performance post a mixed shelf filing is unambiguous and
clear. On average we should expect a 76% price decline following an unexplained shelf
filing.


Conclusion


Spruce Point Capital Management has worked tirelessly to warn investors of the problems
associated with foreign companies that raise money from U.S. investors without any clear
intentions. Our efforts have resulted in the delisting of companies such as China
Integrated Energy (PINK: CBEH) and have helped avoid further losses in companies such
as ZST Digital Networks (Nasdaq: ZSTN) and Camelot Information Systems (NYSE: CIS).
The company’s lack of response to our investigative work and recent $300 million shelf
filing points to greater concerns with this company than initially suggested. We believe that
the conclusions previously drawn about Global Sources being opaque and not run for
shareholders best interests’ are fundamentally sound. As a final reminder, “Actions Speak
Louder Than Words.” We are standing behind our words, and our action has been to short
the stock of Global Sources.


Disclosure: I am short GSOL.

,Very informative.............. keep up the good work. They hate it when speculators (investors) shine a light on their dirty
doings, remember there is no due process in China. Caveat Emptor

Wugu: Ben has had a lot of good calls with his write-ups. Rather than just dismiss the write-up because he is short the
stock, maybe you should consider it carefully. If you strongly disagree with the piece, feel free to write a rebuttal.
However, my guess is you cannot write a coherent rebuttal and are likely someone being paid to pump this stock on
unsuspecting retail investors.

"Our concerns about Camelot’s employee defections and business deterioration ultimately proved correct. " 
i forgot what you wrote exactly, but i am sure those are not you major concerns, or those were not your concerns at
all. you were suggesting that there was some fraud going on, as their revenues per employee seemed too high.

I take it that there was a comment by a "WuGu", which has been expunged. As to pdtor's observation about lack of
due process in China, due process (where it exists) is rarely dependable in most of the world. Baksheesh may not be
a rule, but it is often observed.


Even accounting standards may be Untrustworthy. Have a look at the following interview transcript: http://bit.ly/rNt9un

There have been some real losers in those other shelf filing RTOs: COGO, CHBT, RINO, ABAT, etc.


Very concerning that GSOL would do an even bigger filing than all those dubious companies.

Are you sure these are all the mixed shelf filings in the past 2 years and you didn't cherry pick the ones that
performed the worst?


05 Nov 2011, 09:14 AM


Ian Bezek, Marketplace Contributor
I'd be curious to hear if you have any counter examples to see if there was cherry picking or no.

you mean "rotten" cherry picking, don't you?

Two points: 
- Company revenues growing fast  
- Cash piling up fast 
Two data points very tough to misstate under any accounting principles.


Technical observation on valuation methodology - if valuing a business by the EBITDA multiple method why then
adjust for balance sheet working capital liability? It is hitting the 'valuation by $3 per share': an error, technically. Looks
like a buy opportunity. (Disclosure: I am long)


08 Nov 2011, 02:05 PM

Watch the cash: there is $2+ per share there, after buying an Asian real estate portfolio (probably as good as any bet
on the planet), and its piling up at faster than $1 per year per share (and cash is cash under any accounting principle).


(Valuation exercise underlying a $2.5/share price target: surely technically wrong to adjust the calculated value of a
business using an EBITDA multiple approach, by the working capital (or in this case negative working capital)
employed in the business - that liability is not debt and never has to be "repaid" - fix that and it is a $3.5 per share
addback to the value obtained in that - somewhat conservative - $2.5 calculation).


The $300m shelf - odd certainly for so cash rich a business: but do they need cash ahead of a deal, which they are
not yet able to nail and announce yet? They should tell us what it is about soon: agreed.


A frontier business in a developing part of the world with all that means, and worth a discount.


But, taking everything at face value, this is a $12 stock, easy, so that discount looks more than fully built into today's
price: I am long.

Clearly, the author doesn't understand the Chinese business. Diversification is good, even if off target to the author's
more rigid idea of a business model. I'm sorry his picks haven't performed. Too bad he's trying to influence others in
sharing his experience in a global market.
