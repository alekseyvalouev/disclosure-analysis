5/23/2018 Revealed: Secret short bets of 6 top hedge funds


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revealed-secret-short-bets-6-185634598.html 1/4


Six hedge fund managers gave their best investment ideas at an
exclusive-and private-conference, including new bets against
companies.


The investors were part of a session to present one long and one
short idea each at Morgan Stanley's "Breakers" conference, put on
annually by the bank's hedge-fund-servicing unit at the posh Breakers
Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida.

The event Wednesday was private and closed to the media, but a
person in attendance shared the recommendations with CNBC.com,
along with a summary of the rationales. The picks were:


Aaron Cowen of Suvretta Capital Management: Long pick: Adobe
Systems (ADBE). The company's new subscription-pricing model
should work and will help improve profitability, but that isn't being
priced in to analyst estimates. Short pick: Target (TGT). Extra
consumer cash from low oil prices will boost sales, but it will help low-
cost retailers like Family Dollar Stores (FDO) more. Margins are high
compared to Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and there's no growth in the
number of stores. Target price for the stock is in the high $50s or low
$60s.


Daniel Lewis of Orange Capital: Long pick: Amaya Gaming
(Toronto Stock Exchange: AYA-CA). Amaya's purchase of
PokerStars gives it leading market share. It also has low taxes from
its base on Isle of Man. New PokerStars management is good and
the stock is worth more than $50 a share. Short pick: MGM China

5/23/2018 Revealed: Secret short bets of 6 top hedge funds


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revealed-secret-short-bets-6-185634598.html 2/4


(Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 2282-HK). Trends in Las Vegas have
been good, making it relatively cheap compared to Chinese gambling
hub Macau (as a pair trade, Lewis also likes regular MGM (MGM)
stock long).


Kurt Billick of Bocage Capital: Long pick: Lundin Mining . The
copper, zinc and nickel miner is poised to benefit from recent
investments in its business. Short pick: natural gas. It's still
overvalued at $3 per million British thermal unit given there's not
enough storage in the U.S. Prices will fall below $2 per million Btu.


Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital: Long pick: 21Vianet (VNET).
The company is growing well and is trading at a discount to Equinix
(EQIX) but with a much higher growth rate. Short pick: Youku Tudou
(YOKU). Competitors are being run as loss leaders to attract new
users, making it difficult for Youku, the YouTube of China, to compete
and be profitable. The bull case is it will be bought out by Alibaba
(BABA), but it won't because it would have to consolidate the losses.


Anthony Bozza of Lakewood Capital Management: Long pick:
American Capital (ACAS). The business development corporation
trades below net asset value. It has a corporate restructuring later this
year and will split into multiple businesses. There's a more than 40
percent to 50 percent upside. Short pick: Arista Networks (ANET).
The company faces steep competition from Cisco (CSCO) and
others, which is destroying margins.


John Pinkel of Indus Capital Partners: Long pick: PICC Property &
Casualty (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 2328-HK). Premiums
should rise in China, up 15 percent a year for the next 10 years. Short
pick: Belle International (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 1880-HK).
Margins of 20 percent on footwear are too high, and there's lots of
competition from Alibaba's Tmall and other e-commerce companies.

A spokesman for Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment. A
spokesman for Orange Capital confirmed the summary of Lewis'
picks but declined further comment. Spokesmen for Lakewood, Light
Street, Bocage and Suvretta declined to comment. Indus did not
respond to multiple requests. Reps for the companies shorted did not
respond to requests for comment, except for Target, which declined.  


The Breakers conference is one of the most prominent annual
gatherings in the hedge fund industry, offering Morgan Stanley's
hedge funds clients a chance to show their smarts to potential
investors also in attendance.


Well-known money managers who attended this year, according to
the person inside, included Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital
Management, Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, Paul Tudor Jones
of Tudor Investment, Dan Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management
(OZM), Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and James
Dinan of York Capital Management.


The investor Barton Biggs described the Breakers event as "fabled" in
a 2006 memoir, Hedgehoggng.

"This conference is widely considered the prime event at which to
