ParkerVision Bulls Vastly Overstating Pre-Judgment Interest Amount

Summary


ParkerVision's pre-judgment interest is likely to disappoint.


Careful calculation shows Qualcomm owes only $20.5 million in pre-judgment
interest.


ParkerVision remains enormously overvalued.


On May 29th 2014, ParkerVision (NASDAQ:PRKR) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
met to discuss pre-judgment interest, supplemental damages, and post-verdict damages.
During this meeting, the parties agreed on a pre-judgment interest methodology and rate.
Since the ParkerVision bulls are greatly overstating the amount of pre-judgment interest
that was decided upon, this article will lay out what was actually approved by both parties.


Before going into what was decided on May 29th, let us first look at what both parties went
into the negotiation requesting. ParkerVision's request can be seen below in Exhibit A of
document 531. The fact that ParkerVision does not have a copy of document 531 on its
website and Exhibit A has now been filed under seal on Pacer may be causing some of
the confusion regarding what was decided on May 29th. Fortunately, we were able to
obtain a copy of this document on Pacer before it was put under seal, and therefore, can
show quite clearly that ParkerVision was requesting approximately $24.7 million heading
into this meeting.


While ParkerVision's request for $24.7 million was clearly laid out in document 531, as far
as we can tell, Qualcomm never publicly filed the amount it was willing to pay. What we do
know is that ParkerVision modified Qualcomm's methodology to produce its request. The
adjustment ParkerVision made to Qualcomm's methodology was that ParkerVision used
Florida interest rates, while Qualcomm used the prime rate. Therefore, if we use
ParkerVision's numbers from Exhibit A of document 531, but substitute in the prime rate
for the Florida rate, we can ascertain Qualcomm's number. Doing this leads us to believe
that Qualcomm offered approximately $15 million. Therefore, ParkerVision entered this
negotiation requesting approximately $24.7 million, and Qualcomm was offering
approximately $15 million.

Now that we know what both parties were hoping for, let's look at what was agreed upon.


Document 540 states:


The parties have agreed that (i) a pre-judgment interest award should be calculated
in accordance with the methodology proposed by Dr. Leonard in his January 8, 2014
declaration; and (ii) that the rate to be used to calculate any pre-judgment interest
should be a rate midway between the Florida statutory rate proposed by
ParkerVision and the prime rate proposed by Qualcomm. Following Qualcomm's
provision of actual sales figures from verdict to judgment for the products found to be
infringing, the parties will provide to the court a calculation of pre-judgment interest
based on the mid-point of prejudgment interest between the Florida statutory rate
and the prime rate.


As a reminder, Dr. Leonard is Qualcomm's expert, and while his January 8, 2014
declaration, document 505-1, was filed under seal, as we stated earlier, ParkerVision's
spreadsheet in Exhibit A of document 531 is a spreadsheet that, according to
ParkerVision, replicates Leonard's methodology, but with ParkerVision using the Florida
rate rather than the prime rate that Dr. Leonard had used.


Knowing what has been agreed upon allows us to calculate the pre-judgment interest rate
agreed to by both parties. To calculate this rate, we duplicated ParkerVision's Exhibit A in
Excel, and then created a new set of columns with the average of the prime interest and
Florida interest as agreed to by document 540. Making this adjustment allowed us to
derive a pre-judgment interest number of $20.5 million. Our work can be seen here.


To be clear, this $20.5 million number must be approved by Judge Dalton. However, it is
the amount the parties have agreed to, and we feel it is unlikely the Judge will argue with
terms the parties have agreed upon.


Based on the $20.5 million of agreed-upon interest, we need to revise down our best-case
estimate of fair value for ParkerVision, which previously used the $24.7 million that
ParkerVision requested. As a reminder, this valuation can be seen in our prior article. The
net result is a decline in best-case value to only $2.07 per share, or approximately 57%
below today's price. Accordingly, we reiterate our strong sell recommendation on
ParkerVision's stock.

You must be kidding. Let's assume your right about pre-judgment interest, which your not, have you forgotten about
the 100's of millions that Qualcomm will have to pay to Parker for royalties and licensing going forward once the
JMOLS' are decided. There is also an asset called Parkervisions patent portfolio that you should have considered in
your valuation. If you are so desperate that you need to write misleading articles about the smallest component of the
overall damages Qualcomm will be forced to pay Parker through 2020 than you have truly missed the boat. You have
been trying for years to convince investors to short Parker. The result has been that your short numbers have swelled
to 25 million shares that I believe started at $.80, you've managed to do nothing but help the stock increase in value
and allowed it to raise capital at will. Great short. Wake up before it's to late.

Again you trifle with the truth and suggest that your methodology be used rather than the clear language of the
agreement. Exhibits, charts, reports etc. are not in the agreement and I suggest before you try to deceive again, you
re-read the exact terminology of the agreement; namely the Fl. interest rate and prime divided by 2. That figure will be
somewhere between 80 and 110 million. We will all know soon enough if Judge Dalton is dense enough to follow your
convoluted theory.

In looking at the worksheet what struck me was the low rates on either calculation. Sub 1% for prime and less than
1.2% for the statutory. Where do I get money at that rate? I guess Qualcomm asked themselves that question and
decided to steal.

The interest rates you are looking at in the calculations are for 3 months. To get the annual rate used multiply
by 4

Why would you focus on a document the Judge agreed to seal? That just doesn't make sense. Dalton hasn't giving
out any freebees thus far, so he obviously believes it should be sealed. Therefore, what impact could it have?

SA editors, where is your quality control? The Prime rate in 2006 was 8.25%, 8.2% in 2007, 5% in 2008, 3.25% in
2009, 2010. The authors spread sheet is a completely wrong.

Ummm.....


1) It's not the "authors spread sheet" - it's Exhibit A.1 to a court filing.


2) The prime rates in the document you linked lines up pretty closely with the court document.


Ergo, you could benefit from a bit of "quality control" yourself...

As pointed out earlier, the numbers in the spreadsheet are quarterly interest rates, so multiply by 4 to get
annual interest. Your numbers are right, so are the spreadsheet numbers.


The author simply copied and added to ParkerVision's spreadsheet, which originally used quarterly interest
rates.

Keubiko: I think a lot of these commenters could benefit from the simple rule of speaking or in this case
posting less and reading more. Let’s do a quick review of some of the comments.


1. One commenter does not know the difference between quarterly and annual interest rates.


2. One commenter does not think document 531 means anything because it was filed under seal.


3. One commenter (who I still do not believe to be an 82 year old lawyer) is stuck on the 80-110 million
number, despite definitive proof that PRKR only asked for 24.7 million. I guess this commenter just thinks the
judge will be generous and tell PRKR that even though they only asked for 24.7 million, he will give them 80-
110.


4. Another commenter is upset that the author did not value the patent portfolio even though PRKR has never
made any licensing deals. This commenter is also upset that royalties were not valued out until 2020, despite
the author's evidence in a previous article that a non-infringing alternative may exist.

"...despite the author's evidence in a previous article that a non-infringing alternative may exist..."


If "if and buts" were candy and nuts, what a Merry Christmas we'd all have. The non-infringing alternative.
Yup. We've been waiting for three years yet Qcomm has billions and plenty of techs in it's R & D unit.
Qcomm's own staff said it would be very, very tough. After what was said at the trial, Longs are not worried
about this.


11 Jun 2014, 05:00 PM


silence_twain
moneymade: I guess the longs are very selective about the "if and buts" they accept then because I have yet
to meet a long who does not talk about how in the valuation you need to include the licensing deals (that
would be an if), the win in a second lawsuit against QCOM (that would be an if), and PRKR developing their
own chips and selling them (that would be an if). The real problems the longs have is in the math laid out by
the author in his previous article. The reason longs run into trouble with that math is because it shows that
even if they collect the 172.7 million, the 20.5 million in pre-judgment interest, and some royalties, the stock is
still overvalued. That means that the longs need certain "ifs" to justify the current market cap. PRKR winning

the JMOLs and surviving an appeal should add no value to PRKR stock because that is already baked into
the value. Therefore, it is the longs and not the shorts who need a lot of "ifs" to justify the current market cap.

Silence-twain, 
Silence...please. Yes, those are pending. But here are facts:


FACT: PRKR won the Markman 43-1  
FACT: PRKR won the Patent Infringement trial.  
FACT: PRKR won the 9th largest patent infringement award in history 
FACT: Qcomm continues to infringe, even though they were notified years ago that this was occurring  
FACT: Qcomm continues to infringe today.  
FACT: There is a new patent infringement allegation entered in court 
FACT: While the first law suit involved a product worth $4.00 the second suit involves royalties on a product
worth $20 or greater. 
FACT: The same renown legal team that beat the pants off Qcomm in the first trial is representing PRKR in
the 2nd suit.  
FACT: There are close to 24 million short shares, many who got on board when this stock was less than 1.50.
It's flirts with 5.00 today 
FACT: This stock went from less than 1.00 just over 2 years ago to almost 5.00 today.


I can go on, but "silence is golden." Your contention about PRKR being overvalued is not fact, it's your
opinion. The "fact" is that this stock today is worth 4.88 as of 12:15 pm Eastern time on 6/12/14. And as a
long, that's what I could sell my shares for right now. But why leave money on the table, my opinion is this
stock is heading higher as Dalton is due to deny the JMOL's and increase the money to PRKR.

Document 531 is irrelevant, if, in negotiations, the parties agreed to something else. Frankly, I don't know what the
correct figure should be, but if Judge Dalton upholds the jury's verdict, and if Qualcomm loses the D2P and baseband
trial to come, I expect that Qualcomm will have to pay ParkerVision lots and lots of money every year for years to
come. That should be the focus.

Document 531 is not irrelevant because it helped serve as the basis for what was decided between the 2
parties. I guess one could consider it irrelevant now since a number, seemingly 20.5 million, has been
decided upon. However, until that number was agreed upon, document 531 was very relevant.


And how do I value "lots and lots"? Do you use a DCF, comparable deals, comparable multiples. Are the bulls
really down to using childish terms to disprove well written articles? This article focused on pre-judgment
interest and laid out what that number would be. The author has a previous article laying out the valuation
work. Yet you want to convince people the author is wrong and just use the term lots and lots. I know a little
boy who can express himself with actual numbers. Try doing the same.


11 Jun 2014, 03:36 PM


User 15924502
silence:


I intentionally used the term "lots and lots" because I do not know the number, and I am not placing a valuation on the
shares. I suggest that the author, by focusing on the interest and ignoring the damages, ongoing royalties, and the
result of the second lawsuit is the one sprinkling childish fairy dust.


Since I am not writing the article, and since I do not project a valuation, I feel no need to be specific in my estimates of
moneys to be paid to ParkerVision in the years ahead. I am pretty sure they will be non-zero, and that the author
would like his readers to ignore the facts.

Did anyone else besides me see that IPR's were filed yesterday to challenge the patents? If I were ParkerVision, I
would be very scared at this point. These patents will now have to stand up to a technical review which will be done
by people with a much greater understanding than a jury down in Florida.

Anotherday14. You couldn't get a more twisted serpent. Mike Farmwald & Rambus signs with Qualcomm on 6/11 and

anotherday14
moneymade: The logic of your post makes no sense on several levels. 
The first reason why it makes no sense is because RPX is part of the IPR filings. What exactly did they get
from this Rambus/QCOM deal? The second reason it makes no sense is because if QCOM is found to be the
party behind the IPRs, they get dismissed. RPX just had that happen in the IPRs they filed with regards to the
VHC/Apple case and Mike Farmwald would certainly be smart enough to know this therefore than can be no
quid pro quo. One of the big differences between these IPR filings and the one for VHC/Apple is that Apple is
a client of RPX and QCOM is not.


Has it ever occurred to you that QCOM is a large company that is running a business and unlike PRKR they
actually produce things and to make those things they need to make deals with different companies? Maybe
you should worry less about who filed the IPRs and more about what is in them. The prior art is pretty
damning and they were written by an expert in the field. That to me would be cause for concern if I were a
shareholder.


16 Jun 2014, 08:58 AM


moneymade
anotherday14.  
If I were you, I would also consider many other factors here.


There is one major problem with this IPR filing. An entity only has 1 year to file an IPR. That period has way passed
for Qcom to file. The glitch with this filing is that Mike Farmwald is a related party to Qcom. An entity can not have a
related party file an IPR in order to get around the one year period. Mike is going to deny that he is a related party but
there is plenty of evidence to show that he is in bed with QCOM.


This filing is actually a positive for PRKR and QCOM is going to be really pissed off at this filing. It just opened QCOM
up to a whole new round of due diligence in order to prove that Mke F. is a related party to QCOM. If it is proven (with
very high likelihood) that Mike F. is related to QCOM (i.e.:exchanged emails, phone calls, strategized etc), then not
only is this IPR going to be thrown out but also MF and  
QCOM are going to be investigated for stock manipulation.


This might finally be the final nail in Farmwald's dumping on PRKR. He now opened himself up as well as QCOM) to
personal legal charges as well as lawsuits by PRKR and its shareholders, including me, for stock manipulation.


That to me would be cause for concern if I held a short position against PRKR.
