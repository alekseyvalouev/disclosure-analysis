Brushed Student Counts and Cooked Books:  
Why We Believe GSX Techedu is the Worst Publicly 


Traded Education Company 
 


• GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE: GSX) (“GSX Techedu” or “GSX”) is portrayed as a rising star 
in China’s online education space, having seen its stock more than triple since its NYSE 
IPO in June 2019. 


• GSX reports financials to the SEC that we believe are simply too good to be true. Our 
extensive research including review of PRC Credit Reports, SAIC filings, and web 
analysis indicate to us that GSX’s success is actually based on a fraudulent scheme. 


• PRC Credit Reports suggest that the company has been drastically overstating its 
profitability in its US public filings, especially for 2018. 


• We found multiple related parties that we suspect are used to offload costs to report 
better financials to the SEC and investors. Employee CVs, job recruitment postings 
and work locations indicate several off-balance sheet entities that are actually the 
alter-egos of GSX.  


• We are deeply concerned about the recent acquisition of commercial real estate in 
the city of Zhengzhou, China in January 2020, and we suspect CAPEX fraud. According 
to our research, a total of only RMB 75 million went into the facilities that GSX 
recently purchased for over RMB 330 million. 


• Our research found multiple strong indications of past and current order “brushing” 
– essentially fake student enrollments to boost student count.  


• Our web traffic analysis supports the opinion that many of GSX’s reported students 
do not actually exist. 


• While the company touts its high-quality teacher recruitment mechanism, we found 
a sign-up website that was not functional, multiple allegations of GSX hiring teachers 
right out of college with no prior experience, and fabricated teachers profiles.  


• We distrust management deeply. Insiders and old shareholders are selling 
aggressively.  


• GSX’s former CFO left in a rush during the 2019 IPO, and the current CFO was formerly 
involved in a Chinese online education company that also has numerous allegations 
of being a scam.

1. Introduction – The Official Story Seems Too Good to be True 





GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE: GSX) (“GSX Techedu” or “GSX”) has been a new rising-star in the US capital 
markets. Founded by New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE: EDU)’s former executive 
president Xiangdong (Larry) Chen in 2014, GSX has made a name for itself as one of the fastest growing 
online education players in China, and the first to purportedly achieve profitability. Analysts and 
management have been attributing this apparent phenomenal growth to its great management skills, low 
sales and marketing costs (aka student acquisition costs), and its high profitability achieved by its ground-
breaking ‘star-instructor, dual-teacher, large class’ model.  


On June 6, 2019, GSX began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “GSX” at $10.5 per share. During the 
past eight months, the stock has risen to a high of $42.07, reaching an astonishing annualized return of 
roughly 450%.

GSX is the only publicly traded Chinese online education company that consistently reports bottom line 
profitability and an overall superior margin profile. While most competitors struggle with keeping gross 
margin above 50%, GSX is averaging around 70%, and purports to be constantly improving quarter over 
quarter to just shy of 80% in Q4 of 2019.

Note that costs of revenues are defined relatively similarly amongst competitors, including mainly 
teachers and tutors’ salaries, teaching infrastructure rental expense, teaching material expense, etc.  


We fail to see how this is either realizable or sustainable, especially considering GSX is paying their 
teachers extremely high wages compared to its peers. According to this report, GSX’S main lecturers’ 
salaries are about 40% to 50% higher than industry average, and front-line (sales) employees earn about 
30% to 40% more than industry average. We see a large disconnect between the high costs and high 
margins and how they can co-exist with each other. This was our first clue that something might be amiss 
with the company’s financials.  


After reviewing GSX’s service offering it also became clear to us that GSX’s model only has minor 
differences when compared to its competitors. GSX replaces teachers with tutors and apparently has 
bigger classes than peers, which in our opinion should reduce the quality of education. GSX also targets 
students and parents in third-tier cities where the ability to pay is substantially lower than in wealthier 
areas in China. Yet, GSX reports that it charges substantial premiums for its course. Once again, we are 
wondering how this can be possible.

It all seems so perfect and we can understand how investors were lured into the company’s stock by 
trusting SEC reported numbers. However, experience has taught us that what looks too good to be true 
often is not.  


After extensive research, we have discovered many aspects that we believe have not been fully 
understood by the market and should be very disturbing to investors. We believe that GSX’s superior 
financial performance stems from a different mix of “advantages”, none of which has been properly 
disclosed because each amounts to a form of financial shenanigans: 


1. Offloading costs to controlled but not consolidated entities; 
2. Creating Fake Enrollments through Third Parties; 
3. Super-aggressive, bordering on predatory, marketing; and 
4. Cutting corners on the quality of education.  


In this report, we will detail our analysis of the available information and the reasons why believe that 
GSX is what most companies that are too good to be true end up being:  a fraud.

2. Credit Reports Filings Indicate Exaggerated Margins 





One tell-tale sign that a US-listed Chinese company is falsifying its books is that the financials reported to 
the SEC are much better than the financials reported to Chinese authorities. We pulled the Chinese credit 
reports for GSX operating entities. 





                                              Source: Corporate structure chart from company’s prospectus 


The credit reports we obtained for GSX’s 7 main operating entities show that GSX has apparently been 
overstating its net profit by an astounding 74.6% in 2018! Below are the revenues and net profit (loss) 
that each entity reported in the credit reports. 


Net Profit (RMB’000) 2017 2018 
Beijing Lexuebang (WFOE) (36,466) (40,385) 
Beijing BaiJiaHuLian (VIE) (13,394) 164,513  
Beijing Genshuixue 18  (2) 
BaiJiaChengXi (11,826) 901  
Beijing Jiazi (6,795) (3,703)

Shanghai Jinyou1 (168) (623) 


   
Sum Based on Credit Reports (86,125) 11,252  


   
SEC Reported Net Profit2 (86,955) 19,650  


   
Overstatement in % 1.0% 74.6% 


Note 1: Shanghai Jinyou became wholly-owned subsidiary on January 31, 2018, before that time GSX owned 25% of its equity in 2017, thus 25% 
of net profit/(loss) of Shanghai Jinyou was assigned for 2017. Assuming full year net income of Shanghai Jinyou for 2018.  
Note 2:net income did not include the loss recorded from the convertible redeemable preferred shares redemption value accretion 


The consolidated net loss for 2017 was RMB 86.1 million, which is almost a perfect match with the SEC 
reported loss of 87.0 million in 2017. But when we look at 2018, the consolidated net profit was RMB 
11.25 million based on Credit Reports, which is 42.7% less than the SEC reported net profit of RMB 19.7 
million in 2018. In other words, the net profit GSX reported to the SEC in 2018 was overstated by 74.6%!  


The consolidated revenues in both 2017 and 2018 shown in the credit reports are within a 2% range 
difference with the revenues reported by the company to the SEC. The slight difference of the 
consolidated revenues between credit reports and SEC reported numbers, as well as the small difference 
of the consolidated net loss between credit reports and SEC reported numbers in 2017, make us believe 
that the company has been mainly manipulating its profits in 2018. See Appendix A for these 7 companies’ 
translated income statements. 


Revenues (RMB’000) 2017 2018 
Beijing Lexuebang (WFOE) 0  971  
Beijing BaiJiaHuLian (VIE) 91,132  368,583  
Beijing Genshuixue 0  0  
BaiJiaChengXi 3,949  20,086  
Beijing Jiazi 449  0  
GaoTuYunJi 644  1,028  
Shanghai Jinyou1 0 11,794  


   
Sum Based on Credit Reports 96,174  402,462  


   
SEC Reported Revenues 97,580  397,306  


   
Overstatement in % 1.5% -1.3% 


Note 1: Assume full year revenues of Shanghai Jinyou for 2018. 





Our credit report review already proves in our opinion that the company’s portrayed profitability is a lie 
and that financials cannot be trusted. We dug deeper into the company to unravel the schemes GSX 
employs to manipulate its financials.

3. We Suspect Related Parties are Used to Manipulate Financials 





We believe a key mechanism that GSX employs to hide expenses from investors, auditors, and regulators 
is the use of unconsolidated related parties. We found multiple parties that we suspect of effectively 
acting as an alter ego of GSX. Since these parties are not consolidated, expenses do not appear on GSX’s 
financials. These “alter-ego’ entities effectively allow GSX to shift expenses off the books as it pleases.  


The reasons why we suspect these related parties are in fact alter egos of GSX are: 


• Operating out of the same office(s) as GSX 
• Employee resume identifies GSX and the related company as one and the same 
• Multiple job postings indicate that the related company and GSX are the same 





3.1 Beijing Youlian Global Education Technology Co., Ltd. (“Beijing 
Youlian”) 





In GSX’s prospectus, the company disclosed Beijing Youlian as a related party and that it would recognize 
expenses from receiving advertising service provided by Beijing Youlian. For example, for 2018, GSX 
recorded 4.67 million RMB in revenue from Beijing Youlian and recognized an expense of 2.05 million RMB 
due to Beijing Youlian. For the first 3 quarters of 2019, GSX recognized 3.615 million RMB in expense to 
Beijing Youlian for advertising services, and recorded 0.56 million RMB revenue. It’s worth noting that it 
appears GSX has been dramatically increasing spending on the advertising services provided by Beijing 
Youlian. 


 Revenue 
RMB’000 FY 2017 FY 2018  9M 2018 9M 2019 
Beijing Youlian 1,528 4,670  3,113 556 


 Expense 


 FY 2017 FY 2018  9M 2018 9M 2019 
Beijing Youlian 33 2,052  580 3,615 


Note: The Group recognized revenue from providing technical service; The Group recognized expense from receiving advertising service provided 
by Beijing Youlian. 
Source: GSX prospectus in November 2019.  


However, based on certain job recruitment information published by Beijing Youlian (aka Jiazhang Jia), we 
believe Beijing Youlian is a company that GSX uses to transfer part of its selling expense out of its income 
statement and we suspect the expenses that GSX should have recognized are probably much bigger than 
what was disclosed. 


Per SAIC, GSX’s VIE company Beijing BaiJiaHuLian and Chairman and CEO Xiangdong Chen became Beijing 
Youlian’s shareholders on February 22, 2016. Beijing Youlian’s current shareholder chart is shown below:

Source: Qichacha 


GSX owns 30% of Beijing Youlian through its VIE company Beijing BaiJiaHuLian, and GSX’s Chairman and 
CEO, Xiangdong Chen, personally owns 10% of the company. Beijing Youlian’s SAIC registered address is 
Shijingshan District Lugu South Road No.26, Floor 2 Room 201, Beijing (北京市石景山区鲁谷南路 26 号
二层 201). Beijing Youlian is a GSX investee company, but it is supposed to operate independently, and 
thus is not consolidated into its financials.  


However, we found several job postings that spanned from 2017 to recent that show the actual business 
address of Beijing Youlian is at the same address where GSX and its subsidiaries are located. Below is the 
table that summarizes the registered address of GSX’s subsidiaries in the city of Beijing:

These job postings indicate to us that Beijing Youlian Global Education is not just a related party, but 
perhaps an alter ego of GSX, and effectively one and the same company.

Additionally, we were able to identify a resume from a former employee who clearly states that GSX and 
Beijing Youlian are one and the same company. Note that employment was from September 2016 to 
March 2019, during which time period Beijing Youlian was only an investee company of GSX. However, it 
is obvious that this person disagrees.  


When we discovered that Beijing Youlian Global Education was actually registered using a different 
address but couldn’t be reached at that address by the local regulator, our concerns were solidified. We 
question the setup, as it only gives GSX the ability to employ “cookie-jar” accounting and shift unwanted 
expenses to the subsidiary where they can be hidden from public shareholders.

3.1.1 What Does Beijing Youlian (aka Jiazhang Jia) Do? 





Beijing Youlian, aka Jiazhang Jia, is a company that is focused on teaching parents on how to parent their 
children through various WeChat groups and postings. The company was founded by former GSX 
employee Xiao Xiong in February 2016. According to an article on Jianshu, Jiazhang Jia was created for the 
purpose of developing consumer-side users  for GSX, which is essentially the majority of GSX’s current 
business model.  


According to the article: 


在跟谁学的一年多时间里，他一直被一个问题困扰：谁是我们的用户？谁来实现消费和购
买。跟谁学在成立一年多的时间，发展出 50多万的老师、6万家教育机构入驻平台，都是


B端用户。 


「当时，我在思考一个问题，跟谁学是由 B端和 C端用户构成的一个学习服务型的教育
020平台。就像淘宝是由 1千万卖家中小企业和 20亿买家用户构成的交易平台，所以我一
直认为一个大型的教育 020平台要着力发展 C端用户是必不可少的。但是，谁来做？我来


做，这才有了现在的家长家。」 


Translation: [paraphrased] 


During over one year’s time when he [Xiao Xiong] was with GSX, he was bothered with one 
question: Who is our user? Who will consume and purchase? GSX in just over one year developed 
over 500,000 teachers, and had over 60,000 education institutions join the platform, but they are 
all Business-side users. 


“During that time, I was thinking about one question, GSX is an educational service O2O 
platform that is comprised of Business-side and Consumer-side users, just like Alibaba’s Taobao 
is a trading platform that is comprised of 10 million small and mid-sized enterprises and 2 billion 
consumers. Hence, I always believed that a big education O2O platform should develop 
Consumer-side users. But who will do this? I will do this, hence came Jiazhang Jia.” 


This statement by non-other than the founder of Jiazhang Jia, coupled with our findings that job postings 
shared the same business addresses as GSX reaffirms our suspicion that Jiazhang Jia is a company that 
channels sales to GSX.  


In fact, when asked how Jiazhang Jia makes a profit, Xiao Xiong stated: 


Q：家长家未来的盈利模式是靠付费社群吗？ 


Q: Is Jiazhang Jia’s future profitability model based on paying social medial groups? 





安：据我们观察，家长的付费意愿很强，但是我们不想走这种模式，我们更想把它做成一
个家长的免费学习平台，做成行业媒体的形式，给家长持续地提供优质的内容。至于盈利
模式，我们还在探讨和完善中，但是我们三个月就养活了自己，实现了盈利。现在阶段主

要是养好用户，不考虑快速变现的问题。但是，我们一旦要考虑变现，一定是井喷式的发
展态势。 


Andy (aka Xiao Xiong): According to our observation, parents have a high willingness to pay, but 
we don’t want to go down this route. We want to make it a free platform for all parents and into 
a media for the industry to provide premium content to parents. As for profitability, we are still 
discussing and improving, but we gained profitability within three months. Right now, the key is 
to cultivate users, and not to consider the issue of fast monetization. But once we do want to 
monetize, the development trend will explode. 


In our opinion, we do not think that making lots of profit is the first priority for Jiazhang Jia, rather that 
their true duty lies in channeling parents and their children as users to GSX.  


And here is how it’s done. 


We believe Beijing Youlian, through its various WeChat official accounts and chat groups, has obtained a 
big pool of Chinese parents through free/coupon online class campaigns and after those parents entered 
in their designated WeChat groups, Beijing Youlian would try to make them eventually enroll into paid 
online K-12 classes. Of course not all the parents who enrolled in free classes would become paying clients, 
but as long as the pool is big enough and keeps growing (according to the job recruitment introduction on 
Jiazhang Jia, it has gathered close to 10 million parents on its platforms whose kids’ age range from 0 to 
18 years old), and the conversion ratio (from free class to paid class) is stable, the system works.   


This pattern is something that we see throughout our research on GSX. The company seems to be very 
focused on driving student count (even fraudulently through brushed orders) and marketing and seems 
to have very little regard for the actual quality of the education it provides.  








3.2 Disposed Company Still Next Door to GSX Subsidiary 
 


According to the company’s filings, GSX disposed two entities in 2017, namely Beijing Baijia Shilian 
Technology Co., Ltd (北京百家视联科技有限公司, “Baijia Shilian”) and Beijing Baijia Yuntu Technology 
Co. Ltd (北京百家云图科技有限公司, “Baijia Yuntu”) for no consideration, and the equity interest in 
these two companies were distributed pro rata to the Group’s shareholders.  


Disposal of Beijing Baijia Shilian Technology Co., Ltd (“Baijia Shilian”) and Beijing Baijia Yuntu 
Technology Co. Ltd (“Baijia Yuntu”) 


In September 2017 and December 2017, the Group disposed 100% equity interest in Baijia Shilian 
and Baijia Yuntu to the existing shareholders of the Company for no consideration. Baijia Shilian 
and Baijia Yuntu mostly focused on developing video player software with the function of providing 
live and on-demand video services. The disposals were accounted as a pro rata distribution to the 
Group’s shareholders and accordingly, any gains and losses resulting from the transaction were 
recorded as contribution from and distribution to shareholders.

The operations of Baijia Shilian and Baijia Yuntu prior to the disposal were insignificant and thus, 
did not have a major effect on the Group’s operation. 


It is strange that after more than 2 years of the disposal, Baijia Yuntu is still operating next door to GSX’s 
Beijing subsidiary Beijing Genshuixue.

Not only are Baijia Yuntu and Beijing Genshuixue next door to each other, Baijia Yuntu also hires 
employees, i.e. in city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, that work in GSX’s Wuhan office. Below is a list of job 
recruitments in the city of Wuhan: 


• Sales Manager 
• Market Development Manager 
• Sales Development Representative 


The work location of all these three listed jobs posted by Baijia Yuntu is Genshuixue Company Luoyu Rd 
No.10, Qunguang Center Floor 20 (跟谁学公司珞喻路 10 号群光中心 20 楼). Basically, it directly says 
the work location is in Genshuixue, aka, GSX. 


The obtained SAIC filings on Baijia Yuntu’s financials are worrisome to us. In 2017 Baijia Yuntu only 
reported 1.69 million RMB in revenue yet lost 8.7 million RMB. SAIC financials for 2018 are not available 
(one possible reason is that Baijia Yuntu hasn’t filed their financials to the local bureau, which, in the first 
place, is already a redflag regarding Baijia Yuntu). We speculate that at least part of the loss, based on the 
evidence we provided above, was due to that Baijia Yuntu is also helping GSX take off expense from its 
income statement.  


RMB‘000 2016 2017 20181 
Revenues 1,089 1,686 N/A 
Net Profit -17,601 -8,716 N/A 


note 1: SAIC financials are not available for 2018. One possible reason is that Baijia Yuntu hasn’t filed their financials to the local SAIC bureau  


It appears to us that GSX’s investee (Beijing Youlian) and disposed entity (Baijia Yuntu) continue to have 
its employees work in GSX’s building/office. However, it is unclear whether GSX treats these employees 
as its own employees or not. As we mentioned, we strongly believe GSX use these entities to hire 
employees while at the same time hiding these expenses from its income statement.

3.3 Where Did the Cash go? We Suspect CAPEX Fraud in the latest 


Commercial Buildings Purchase 
 


One key issue for companies who report fake profits is finding ways to explain the missing cash without 
developing suspect balance sheet accounts. We suspect GSX committed CAPEX fraud in its commercial 
building purchase, and in reality paid a substantially lower price for the real estate than reported to 
investors. 


GSX announced on January 31, 2020 that: 


“It has recently closed the purchase of several plots of commercial real estate in the Economics 
Development Area of Zhengzhou, Henan Province, for a total consideration of RMB333.8 
million. GSX has made the first installment payment of RMB69 million, and expect to complete the 
payment of the remaining installments within the next 3 years. Such commercial real estate 
includes two completed office buildings and one office building in construction. GSX plans to use 
these premises for business operating functions. They expect to begin business operations in these 
office buildings in the second half of 2020.” 


Our research casts serious doubt on the legitimacy of this deal and we strongly urge the company to 
explain more details around this deal to investors. There have been no details or actual agreements filed 
by the company, even though this event seems to be quite material.  


According to the SAIC information, GSX’s VIE company Beijing BaiJiaHuLian acquired a company named 
Zhengzhou Kaitong Kegongmao Co., Ltd. (郑州凯通科工贸有限责任公司, “Zhengzhou Kaitong”) on 
January 13, 2020.  





 
source: Qichacha 


On January 19, 2020, the name of Zhengzhou Kaitong was changed to Zhengzhou GaoTuYunJi Education 
Technology Co., Ltd. (郑州高途云集教育科技有限公司, “Zhengzhou GaoTuYunJi”).  


Based on the public information from National Zhengzhou Economic and Technological Development 
Zone (郑州经济技术开发区), Zhengzhou Kaitong in 2016 (now Zhengzhou GaoTuYunJi) had applied to 
build 2 R&D buildings and 1 product display sales center. Here is the detailed environment effect 
evaluation report which the company submitted to the local government on January 6, 2016. We did not 
find any other reports/documents that indicate new constructions were undertaken apart from the 
aforementioned three buildings.

Below are some more detailed information from the evaluation report regarding this project: 








This form clearly states that the total investment into this project amounts to RMB 75 million. 


Here is some more information regarding this project: 


“本项目占地面积为 16709.61m2 ，建设 2 栋研发楼和 1 栋产品展示销售中心，总建筑面积
为 64660.62m2 。项目建成后主要作为写字楼出租或出售给民企和社会团体使用。” 


Translation [Paraphrase] 


This project’s area is 16,709.61 square meters, and it is to construct 2 R&D buildings and 1 product 
display sales center. The total construction area is 64,660.62 square meters. After the project is 
completed, it is mainly for office building lease or sale to private companies and social 
organizations.  


According to the evaluation report, there is 1 R&D building that has 21 floors and it was under construction 
[back in 2016], and the other R&D building has 6 floors and was completed. The product display sales 
center has 4 floors and was completed. The total project, after completion, is expected to host 1,877 
people.  


The following reasons make us believe the three buildings that GSX announced to have purchased are the 
three buildings referred in the environment effect evaluation report by Zhengzhou Kaitong in 2016:
22 
   








 
• Timing: GSX announced on January 31, 2020 that the deal was closed RECENTLY vs the 


shareholder change of Zhengzhou Kaitong that happened on January 13, 2020; 
• Buildings: GSX stated that the deal include two completed office buildings and one office building 


in construction vs Zhengzhou Kaitong’s 2016 application of constructing 2 R&D buildings and 1 
product display center; 


• Utilization purpose: GSX stated it plans to use these premises for business operating functions vs 
Zhengzhou Kaitong’s 2016 evaluation report clearly stated after the project is completed it is 
mainly for office building lease or sale to private companies and social organizations. 


If these three buildings that GSX mentioned in their press release are in fact the three buildings (2 R&D 
buildings and 1 product display sales center) Zhengzhou Kaitong applied to construct in 2016, our question 
would be why does GSX want to pay RMB 333.8 million for three buildings while the total investment of 
this project from Zhengzhou Kaitong is only RMB 75 million? This payment, although in installments, is 
over 4 times the total investment Zhengzhou Kaitong spent just a few years ago. GSX could be vastly 
overpaying, but we strongly suspect CAPEX fraud. We believe GSX overstates its capex investment in order 
to wash off the cash that was exaggerated on its balance sheet in the first place.  


Again, we believe our deduction based on the limited information the company disclosed is reasonable, 
and if the company does not agree with our findings, they are welcome to offer a much more detailed 
explanation to the investors.
23 
   








 
4. Fake Student Enrollments 





We believe GSX is the worst among its peers and generates a massive amount of volume from fake student 
enrollments. 


According to a report published in June 2015, GSX asked companies to brush orders (which means using 
fake accounts to purchase online classes offered by GSX and create inflated demand for those classes) for 
them: 


某教育公司老板在朋友圈晒出截图，曝料跟谁学要求入驻机构刷单，从截图中的对话中可以看出，
某商家被“跟谁学”要求刷单，刷钱最多的十二个机构可以获得跟谁学平台推荐。 


据该商家透露，其一个月在跟谁学平台上刷单四十万元。他们与跟谁学签订了协议，之后每个月要
保持至少 20 万，同时要求在 6 月 16 号跟谁学活动上，单日需要刷 10 万。 


“（刷单）的号都是假的，平台给了我们十几个号，加上我们自己员工申请的，大概二十多个号，
我们一个课，就买 2-5 万。”该商家称。 


据行业人士称，不仅跟谁学，其他的家教 O2O 平台存在刷单现象，刷单在行业里已是公开的秘密。 


一位北京地区知名 K12 领域老师对多知网表示： “ 我在一个 500 人的老师群问谁在跟学谁获得学生
订单，除了我们把线下的学生通过跟谁学支付外，没有一个老师获得订单，这是令人吃惊的。” 


Translation [Paraphrase] 


One boss from an education company put out screenshots on WeChat Moments, saying that GSX 
asked other parties to brush orders [for GSX]. The conversations from the screenshots show that 
one company was asked by GSX to brush the orders, and 12 companies that brush the most orders 
would be recommended by GSX platform.  


According to this company, it will brush orders worth of RMB 400,000 a month. They have signed 
agreement with GSX, and was required to maintain at least RMB 200,000 a month, and in the 
same time [it was requested by GSX] to brush order worth of RMB 100,000 on the daily activity 
held by GSX on June 16 [,2015].  


“The accounts [to brush orders] are all fake. The [GSX] platform gave us more than 10 accounts, 
plus the ones our own employees applied, it’s over 20 accounts. For one class, we would purchase 
amounts from RMB 20,000 to 50,000,” stated by the company.  


According to the person in this industry, not only GSX, other O2O platforms also have order-
brushing activities, and the order-brushing is a known secret in this industry. 


One well-known K12 teacher in city of Beijing area told duozhi.com that, “I asked in a GSX WeChat 
group with 500 teachers in it if anyone received order from any student, not a single teacher got 
the order, except for the students that teachers acquired offline... This is shocking.” 


 



http://www.duozhi.com/company/201506153416.shtml
24 
   








 
Some might argue that this incident is years ago and the company might have ceased doing that. Whereas 
in our opinion, GSX is likely to keep doing it as long as it does not get caught.  


We found evidence that the company is currently actively recruiting people to brush orders.  





We signed up for a free account on GSX’s mobile portal and found a suspicious profile of another user 
that blatantly advertised jobs to brush orders for the company. We understand that a company would not 
recruit for these kinds of positions through its official job portal, so seeing the job advertisement placed 
in such an odd way makes sense to us. What other reasons are there for the existence of such an 
add/profile on GSX’s platform? We are deeply concerned that GSX is using off the radar means to recruit 
personnel that is essentially just tasked with creating fake student accounts and enrollments.  


Our suspicions were also validated by a recent report published by “Moses English” on December 15, 2019. 
Moses has been an English teacher posting his experience on learning English vocabulary since 2008, and 
can be considered a thought leader in China on online education. He has his own website, blog and 
WeChat subscription account (used to share articles on WeChat). He is also the author of a book called

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMjE2MDY5NQ==&mid=2651433984&idx=1&sn=25faa2aa2447a7b5e42155720f15428b&chksm=8133ad58b644244ed66e55ab37fa96ec135bb8bf07ef4a65b7bb47d7d645378ed86c84448122&scene=21#wechat_redirect

“English Vocabulary Bible”, which was recommended by many people including Minhong Yu, the founder 
of New Oriental Education.  


According to the report, “Moses English” whose last name is Liang, enrolled into a vocabulary class offered 
by GSX, and was invited into several WeChat Groups hosted by GSX. However, when the course ended, 
Liang noticed that the people in the WeChat Groups were giving out multiple great identical reviews to 
teachers.
26 
   














According to Liang, he listed at least 6 incidences where “students” in different groups gave out exactly 
identical reviews. When Liang pointed this out to GSX teachers, they simply stated there was no problem 
with identical reviews as their courses were so good that people unanimously felt great about it. They 
went on and stated that these repetitive reviews were simply a coincidence. Apparently GSX had fake 
students enroll in trial classes in this incident to give positive reviews and encourage others to sign up.  


About a month later on Jan 14, 2020, Liang wrote another article titled “GSX: The way you defraud 
consumers to purchase courses are disgusting”, further addressing his concerns about the review brushing 
situation.  



https://card.weibo.com/article/m/show/id/2309404460552687583293?_wb_client_=1
27 
   














Above is a screen shot of another repetitive comment, review. This time, Liang identified as many as 25 
comments that were identical and repeated by different users in different WeChat groups.  


Note that we did not find any comparable cases where Moses English went so far as calling a company he 
reviewed “fraudulent”. He has tested many platforms and participated in numerous causes, yet his strong 
criticism against GSX stands out as uniquely devastating. These recent cases confirm our concerns that 
order brushing and creating fake profiles wasn’t something GSX did in the past, but is likely something 
they are still doing. In light of this evidence, we find it extremely difficult to rely on the glamorous guidance 
and financial KPIs the company has been reporting.
28 
   








 
5. Web Analysis Validates GSX Lagging Behind its Peers 





Since online education is conducted via the internet, we consider web traffic to be a good proxy for how 
many students are actually visiting GSX’s websites and platforms. We referred to multiple sources 
including Alexa, Baidu Index, WeChat Index to check rankings, and referred to rank2traffic.com, and 
multiple other sources to reflect absolute traffic volume. Given that many students may opt to use mobile 
application to enroll and participate in courses, we also analyzed app download data across both IOS and 
Android from qimai.cn. 


Alexa 


Alexa is a widely used platform that ranks websites in terms of traffic trends. Those with higher rankings 
(lower numbers) typically perform well in terms of traffic volume, and those with lower rankings (higher 
numbers) usually lags behind. According to Alexa, GSX has in fact been trending quite poorly in the past 
few years compared to its online education competitors. In fact, GSX and its platform Gaotu have 
consistently been underperforming its major competitors ever since 2018. However, its stock 
performance has been steadily outpacing its peers.  





We see that both GSX and Gaotu were ranked as the lowest tier compared to its major publicly traded 
competitors.  



https://www.alexa.com/pro/dashboard
29 
   














Despite this fact, GSX’s stock has been outperforming its major competitors by a large margin. There is 
clearly a disconnect. The stock comparison tool on Yahoo! Finance make this crystal clear. 


Baidu Index 


Baidu Index is more or less the equivalent of Google Trend in China. It reflects the popularity of key words 
via search scores. The higher the score, the higher the popularity.  





As we can see, GSX and its other platform Gaotu haven’t been trending well ever since 2017. In fact, they 
are amongst the lowest. We see a general hike during the beginning of this year due to coronavirus and 
the online education frenzy it has brought about.  



https://finance.yahoo.com/

http://index.baidu.com/v2/index.html
30 
   














However, when we zoomed into the beginning of 2020, the timeframe during which online education 
benefited the most, we found surprising data. One would think that a popular online education provider 
like GSX would likely benefit greatly from the recent coronavirus as a halt on all offline afterschool 
education was issued by the Chinese government. However, data shows otherwise. We see that TAL’s Xue 
Er Si has been trending particularly well, most likely due to students and parents switching aggressively to 
online education. However, GSX barely budged.  


How does GSX perform compared to non-public online education companies?
31 
   














Data indicates that neither GSX nor Gaotu have been trending above most of the private online education 
platforms in the last 4 years, nor has their popularity risen much recently compared to their private 
competitors.
32 
   








 
WeChat Index 





WeChat Index is similar to Baidu Index, but has gained popularity due to more people relying on mobile 
application and WeChat to conduct searches. The index only shows search trend for the past 90 days. We 
can clearly see that GSX and Gaotu, the lines in yellow and light blue are almost consistently at the bottom 
of the charts, indicating relatively low popularity. This is especially significant, considering GSX alleges that 
they were able to achieve such exponential growth at low costs due to precisely their presence and 
strategic focus on WeChat promotions.  





Rank2traffic.com 


Rank2traffic.com estimates visitors for millions of websites, and includes a wide variety of features 
including historical traffic, Alexa rankings etc. Due to Rank2traffic having the most comprehensive data 
set spanning across at least the past two years. To ensure that we were including all traffic data that could 
potentially relate to enrollments, we included all meaningful company websites and domains (those with 
insufficient data were left out). Below are some of the results.

Note1: TAL states that Xue Er Si generates around 13.3% of revenue as of 2019. However, we have generously assumed all enrollments are 
related to online education. Notice, this assumption will only lower Visits Per Enrollments Per Year. 


Note2: TAL 2019 enrollments are estimated using latest quarter results due to different fiscal year ends.

Note1: HK1797 does not disclose sufficient information, hence we are using EDU’s data here as a substitute. Notice that due to EDU  having 
many offline enrollments, this substitution will only lower visits per enrollments per year. 


Note2: EDU 2018 and 2019 enrollments are estimated due to different fiscal year ends. 2018 results are from Q3 2018 to Q2 2019, 2019 results 
are from Q3 2019 to Q2 2020.

Note: VIPKID does not disclose enrollment data, however, it disclosed that it currently has 700,000 students. We have separat ed students by 
half and allocated it to 2018 and 2019. Notice even if we allocate 700,000 to one year only, the Visits Per Enrollments Per Year would still be 
significantly higher than GSX.

We discovered that GSX had significantly lower number of visits per year per enrollment. Essentially, this 
means that each enrolled student will visit the website only 20 times per year in 2018 and 4 times per 
year in 2019. We acknowledge that all companies’ visit numbers seem low considering the frequency of 
online courses. This is most likely due to many people ultimately using mobile applications instead of 
websites to actually participate in courses. However, this should not affect the comparability of these data. 
In addition, we have generously attributed all enrollments from both TAL and EDU, who have significant 
offline enrollments, to online education. In reality, without these assumptions, the results would likely be 
even less favorable for GSX.

In addition, we are also concerned with the relatively high referral sources GSX has compared to others. 
Referrals are visits that are not from direct website searches or search engine hits, but are from other 
websites that redirect users to visit the designated websites. We see direct and searches to be organic 
sources to the website and referrals as the lowest quality source. 


Qimai.cn 


Qimai.cn is a professional mobile application analytics platform. It provides app download data from a 
wide variety of platforms including the majority of the commonly used Android platforms in China and 
the Apple IOS platform.  


Due to the prevalence of mobile phones and each company having its own mobile platform, we felt it 
important to compare the performance of such applications. We are using daily download volume as a 
proxy for enrollment. We believe that enrollments should be positively correlated to the app download 
volume due to new enrollments being at least partially students who haven’t used the application before. 
We extracted 12 months data from February 2019 to February 2020, and compiled app download data 
for both Android and Apple iOS platforms. Android platforms considered includes “360”, “Baidu”, 
“Huawei”, “Meizu”, “OPPO”, “VIVO”, “Wandoujia”, “Xiaomi” and “Yingyongbao”. We compared GSX and 
Gaotu applications with applications by public companies including “有道精品课” by DAO, “新东方在线” 
(Koolearn) by HK1797, “学而思”(Xue Er Si) by TAL and applications by non-public companies including “猿
辅导” (Yuanfudao) and “作业帮” (Zuoyebang). 


 
         Source: Qimai.cn; Grizzly analysis 


We see that “Zuoyebang” single handedly dwarfed all other platforms in terms of download volume. 
However, it is still evident that GSX and Gaotu are performing quite terribly, as GSX is barely visible.

If we remove Zuoyebang, we see a clearer picture. GSX and Gaotu is lagging behind competitors by a large 
margin (over 50%) compared to both public and private competitors.  


 
         Source: Qimai.cn; Grizzly analysis 


Even after we consolidate GSX and Gaotu, we see that GSX (Consolidated) are still the weakest of the 
competitors.  


The data shows overwhelming evidence that GSX is actually not the hypergrowth, well-regarded, well-
known all-star company that management or sell-side analysts have been touting.  


We encourage you to do a search for the China online-education ranking and the China online k-12 
education ranking. We found numerous websites providing all sorts of rankings, however, almost none

even mentioned GSX or Gaotu as a top platform. One example would be the top 10 ranking provided by 
Chinaapp.com.  


 



https://www.chinapp.com/paihang/zaixianjiaoyu
39 
   








 
This ranking is sorted by brand recognition. We see many big names listed here, including HK1797, TAL’s 
Xue Er Si and other public and non-public companies. TEDU and DL are also on the list. TEDU currently 
trades at about 115M market cap. DL has seen its stock price almost double since August 2019 and 
currently trades at a 290M market cap at a PE of 13.69x. GSX currently trades at about 10B market cap at 
a PE of 249x.  


This website provides rankings based on other criteria, such as “premium select”, “up and rising” and 
“popularity”. None showed GSX or Gaotu. 





It appears that the only thing noteworthy about GSX is its stock price. If this is not a bubble destined to 
pop, we really don’t know what is.  


The data from the mobile site alone was also disturbing. QuestMobile published a report on February 12, 
2020 that includes TOP 5 mobile apps that have the highest DAUs (daily average users) from January 14, 
2020 to February 4, 2020, which are Xuexi Qianguo, Zuo Ye Bang, Wangyi Youdao Cidian, Xiaoyuan Souti, 
Xue Er Si Wang Xiao, with Yuan Fu Dao. It is clear that neither GSX’s mobile apps Genshuixue or Gaotu 
Class are among these TOP 5 DAU mobile apps.

While GSX has been touting its impressive growth speed, we have uncovered that GSX in reality lags 
behind significantly in traffic data and market recognition.  





According to an online education industry report by IResearch, GSX was not even mentioned as one of the 
major players in this track in 2018.

6. Worst Teacher Recruitment Practices 





According to GSX, the company has a rigorous screening process that hand picks the best teachers.  


From the pool of prospective instructors we identified in 2018 and during the three months ended 
March 31, 2019, we meticulously evaluated and employed less than 2% of the candidates. As of 
March 31, 2019, we had 169 instructors and 522 tutors. 


However, according to a source who claims to be a former GSX employee, GSX actually hires cheap 
teachers that just graduated and also allows applicants to make up their profile.  





His core concerns about GSX were: 



https://www.zhihu.com/question/31133946
42 
   








 
1. Hires fresh graduates cheaply 
2. Newly hired teachers filing fabricated false profiles and resumes 
3. Order brushing firms give 5-star reviews and create fake student profiles. The ratio of students 


that are actually online during classes is terrifyingly low. 


This is reaffirmed by another ex-intern in the same post: 





In point number 7, he expressed that:
43 
   








 
Teacher’s levels were widely different, there weren’t strict teacher selection standards. Usually 
when a new institute joins GSX, we get the account the teacher registered, his ID and his photo, 
and would make up the rest.  


We also found a review from a former teacher in the same post: 





These reviews point out worrisome factors, such as bad business practices, teacher profile fabrication and 
fake reviews. 


Worse yet, these bad practices seem to be currently still ongoing. We discovered that as recently as 
December of 2019, company employees were extremely critical in regard to this issue. In reviews on
44 
   








 
Kanzhun, which is a widely used job platform in china, one employee stated that they had almost no time 
to rest, the company wasn’t paying well and it was all about aggressively pushing sales.  





This is just one of numerous complaints who allege the same wrongdoings. We do not see this kind of 
employee treatment as sustainable and don’t find comparable allegations for any of GSX’s competitors.  


We attempted to validate these concerns by trying to construct a fake profile online and submitting our 
application through the GSX teacher application portal. However, to our surprise, the portal does not even 
work.  





By clicking the join now button, the website actually guides us to an empty bbs page, which is shown 
below.

https://www.genshuixue.com/static/teacher

http://bbs.genshuixue.com/forum/postBrowse/63491
45 
   

















When we try to apply via phone on the mobile website, we got to the page below where we were asked 
to fill in a cell phone number to receive a verification code. However, after we filled in the cell phone 
number and clicked “retrieve the verification code” button, nothing happened, meaning we did not 
receive the verification code no matter what we tried. Multiple attempts failed.
46 
   








 
It is clear to us that on both PC and mobile sites teacher recruitment does not work. Teachers who want 
to join GSX to become an authorized teacher are not able to do so through the company’s website.  


Yet just recently, it was reported that in light of the coronavirus event, GSX is recruiting nationwide online 
for teachers. We fail to understand how a firm with such a high growth rate and so many new student 
enrollments fails to have its teacher recruitment portal up and running, especially after being reported to 
go full-steam in terms of recruiting. This just doesn’t make sense to us.   


The numerous complaints regarding GSX’s teacher and employee recruitment indicate symptoms of bad 
business practices, the fact that its online teacher recruitment portal doesn’t even work is even more 
concerning.

7. Mysterious Departure of CFO Before IPO, Currently 


Untrustworthy CFO 
 


One thing that we always pay attention to is the turnover and credibility of a company’s CFO. Our due 
diligence on GSX’s CFO history produced concerning results.   


In an interview in November 2014, when introducing the 6 co-founders (including Xiangdong Chen 
himself), Xiangdong Chen stated that one of the co-founders, Yuxiao Song, was in charge of company’s 
finances. Yuxiao Song used to be in charge of financial data organization and analysis, related party 
transactions, tax, and management of financial managers before the current public company EDU was 
listed in the U.S. This seems to be a credible background. However, it was reported that just before GSX 
went public, Yuxiao Song resigned from the position and the reason internally announced was due to 
family reasons. Although it is unclear when exactly Song resigned, judging from the disclosed information 
it seems that the current CFO, Nan Shen, was in position since December 2018. So GSX’s former CFO must 
have resigned just 3 months before GSX submitted its initial filing to the SEC. Again, we found it strange 
that Song resigned just months before GSX’s filing for IPO. Would you exit just when the big pay day is 
about to arrive? Color us skeptical.   


Moreover, we also question the credibility of its newly appointed CFO, Nan Shen.  


According to GSX’s introduction,  


“Ms. Nan Shen has served as our chief financial officer since December 2018. Prior to joining us, 
Ms. Shen was the chief financial officer of China Sinoedu Co., Ltd. from November 2017 to 
November 2018. Before that, Ms. Shen served multiple positions at PricewaterhouseCoopers 
between February 2012 to November 2017…” 


We were particularly interested in Ms. Shen’s experience as CFO of China Sinoedu Co., Ltd. First of all, 
based on the direct Chinese translation of this company’s English name, we failed to find any 
corresponding Chinese company per SAIC. However, we did find one company called Beijing Sino Sunshine 
International Culture Communication Co., Ltd. (北京新诺阳光国际文化传播有限公司, “Beijing Sino 
Sunshine”) which operates a brand called Sinoedu ( 外 教 中 国 ) (Facebook page: 
https://www.facebook.com/sinoeduBJ). According to the introduction on the Facebook page, Sinoedu’s 
website is http://www.sinowaijiao.com/, which is the same registered website as Beijing Sino Sunshine 
(website page does not work anymore). 


After researching Sinoedu online, we found an unproportionally large amount of detailed posts that allege 
Sinoedu of being an outright scam. Below are a couple of examples: 


WARNING! SinoEdu & Sino J are China Job Scams targeting Foreign English Teachers (posted on 
April 2, 2018) 


“Attention all TEFL & ESL teachers looking to work abroad teaching in China...SinoEdu is a 
Chinese chain school that also uses the alias brand of SinoJ or Sino J. Do not believe anything 
they tell you even if they put it in your contract. They exploit foreigners and do not pay what they 
promise and force you to work unpaid overtime. If you dare to complain they threaten to get you

arrested and deported because they deliberately got you the wrong visa so they can keep you on 
a string. They were supposed to have gotten you a Z visa (work visa) from the first day. When 
you ask about this they will tell you that you will get it after your 90 or 180 day probation period, 
But when that time comes they only give you a contact on the black market and tell you to buy 
your own Z Visa for 20,000! 
They also take twice as much taxes as they should from your pay check because they figure since 
you cannot read Chinese you will never know the true tax rate for foreigners (10% excluding the 
first 4,800 of income which is tax exempt), Anyway, there is nothing good about this school 
operation even the pay which is 5,000 per month below the average pay of 18,500 for foreign 
teachers in China. 
 
They will take your photo and use it to make fake testimonials on the internet that you will not 
even know about and no matter where you come from, they will lie to the mothers and say you 
a famous American teacher and then demand that you go along with their lies! 
RECOMMENDATION: AVOID!” 
 


Here is another one: 
 


SinoEdu aka Sino J is a China Job Scam for English teachers to avoid in Beijing (posted 1 year and 
10 months ago) 
 
“First off this company is Chinese owned and likes to tell parents they are part of an "American 
Joint Venture" This is false. Secondly they are not registered with nor approved by SAFEA to hire 
foreigners, so all the foreign teachers working there are illegal and can be arrested any day... 
and then deported as a convicted criminal with a record. Thirdly, from the three teachers we 
spoke with that work there, only a Syrian or Ukranian refugee would think their salary is OK. All 
other foreigners say it is "garbage pay" and only a job they take until finding a better one. 
 
They also play money games with their teachers by letting them work 39 hours a week instead 
of 40 because full-time teachers must be given rights and benefits. Fake taxes deducted from 
monthly pay is a common problem. The illegal teachers cannot complain to the police about this 
or they get arrested and deported. Part-time teachers cannot complain about unpaid overtime, 
and will not get vacation pay or medical insurance. All the foreign teachers are presented as 
"American native speakers to the mothers." In reality, most of them are from Eastern Europe 
and of 153 foreign teachers working at 4 locations, 7 were actually real teachers before coming 
to China. 
 
In 2015-2016, 47 of their fake teachers were arrested and booted out of China dor fake diplomas, 
phony TEFL certificates, or black visas. For desperate refugees they fill a niche market. But the 
PSB was just told about these shysters and all the parents will be getting the 411 on them shortly. 
The smart ones will get a refund while there are still assets and money in their bank accounts. 
 
They are blacklisted by both the CTA and CFTU and more comments about them are at 
reddit.com/r/chinascamcentral.” 
 


The content of these posts and allegations are pretty detailed and look credible to us. To be clear, we do 
not know whether or not the company Nan Shen worked for before joining GSX is actually a scam or not, 



https://eslwatch.info/en/forum/china/1147-sinoedu-aka-sino-j-is-a-china-job-scam-for-english-teachers-to-avoid-in-beijing.html
49 
   








 
it’s just that these posts were online in the 2018 period (maybe early 2019), when Nan Shen was Sinoedu’s 
CFO (November 2017 – November 2018), and we believe these kind of allegations are a legitimate reason 
for people to question the credibility of the company Sinoedu, and also to question Nan Shen’s integrity 
as a CFO, in our opinion. We note that the allegations are numerous and detailed and we couldn’t find 
anything comparable on competitors.  


It is a big redflag to us that GSX’s co-founder and CFO, Yuxiao Song, resigned months before the company’s 
filing for IPO. We also see as a red flag that the company that current CFO, Nan Shen, used to work for 
was alleged to be an education scam.

8. Management’s Background Presents Risk to the Company 





GSX’s founder, Chairman and CEO, Xiangdong Chen, is the biggest shareholder (35%) of a financial 
company called Jining Century Tangren Minjian Capital Management Co., Ltd (济宁世纪唐人民间资本管
理有限公司, “Tangren Capital”), which is a 50% equity interest holder of Jining Shende Taihe Minjian 
Capital Management Co., Ltd (济宁慎德泰和民间资本管理有限公司 , “Taihe Capital”). Both these 
companies are in the business of conducting equity and debt investment, short term financial investments, 
investment consulting, etc. However, these two companies were mentioned by the local government 
multiple times as not having the required operation certificates to conduct its business.  


First, it was reported by Jining Daily that according to [Shandong Province] Jining City Rencheng District 
local finance regulator in February 2017, both Tangren Capital and Taihe Capital did not obtain business 
operating certificates.  





Secondly, even as recent as January 10, 2020, according to the notice published by Jining City Rencheng 
District local finance regulator, these two companies still do not have the required business operating 
certificates to conduct business: 


 



http://www.jnnews.tv/p/791.html

http://www.rencheng.gov.cn/art/2020/1/10/art_33675_2425496.html
51 
   








 
Based on the information mentioned above, it appears to us that for nearly 3 years, these two companies 
have been operating without required local-government-approved certificates. Although Xiangdong Chen 
is not listed as these two companies’ key management, the fact that he is the biggest shareholder (35%) 
of Tangren Capital and indirect 17.5% shareholder of Taihe Capital puts him at risk. Conducting business 
without the required certificates in the financial industry is a very serious crime in China and both big 
shareholders and key management and shareholders could face severe backlash.

9.  Existing Shareholders Are Selling and Co-Founders are Leaving 


the Company 
 


According to the prospectus filed in November 2019, insiders and former shareholders have been selling 
shares aggressively. GSX did not sell any new stocks and all the 18 million ADSs were from its existing 
shareholders with an aggregate of $252 million. The tables below are a summary for the existing 
shareholders that sold their stocks in the offering.

Early investors Gaorong Capital and Qifu Capital cashed out $59 million and $67 million, respectively. 
Entity Origin Beyond Limited whose beneficiaries are GSX’s employees cashed out $33 million, and it 
appears to us that one of GSX’s co-founders, Bin Luo, also cashed out $8.7 million. In addition, according 
to the prospectus, one of the co-founders, Gangjiang Li, granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable 
within 30 days from the date of the prospectus to purchase up to nearly 2 million ADSs, with an aggregate 
of about $28 million; and another co-founder, Yuxiao Song, who was in charge of GSX’s finances but 
resigned months before GSX’s IPO, also granted the same option to underwriter to purchase up to 250k 
ADSs, with an aggregate of about $3.5 million.   


Another thing we want to point out is that the company’s second biggest individual holder, Huaiting Zhang, 
who is also one of the co-founders, resigned in December 2019. Although he did not participate in the 
initial offering, he held 14.5 million equivalent ADSs, which is worth about $500 million based on the 
closing price of February 14, 2020. As soon as he decides to unload some of the shares that he owns, GSX’s 
stock would experience tremendous selling pressure.  


According to an interview in November 2014, Xiangdong Chen said there were another 5 co-founders for 
GSX, and they are : 


• Gangjiang Li: used to work at Microsoft, Intel, Goggle, Sohu Video and Baidu; 
• Huaiting Zhang: used to work at Baidu and played a significant role for Baidu’s search engine 


technology 
• Bin Luo: used to work at Baidu, and played a significant role for Baidu’s search engine technology 
• Yuxiao Song: used to work at public company EDU over 10 years and was in charge of financial 


data organization and analysis, related party transactions, tax, and management of financial 
managers before EDU was listed in the U.S. 


• Wei Su: used to be a teacher but later founded an education training company, an entrepreneur 
in the education industry 


Based on GSX’s disclosure and media reporting, it is expected that 4 out of 6 co-founders are planning to 
leave the company.  


Co-founders Status Time of Leave (or expected to) 
Gangjiang Li Leave 2017 
Huaiting Zhang Leave December 2019 
Bin Luo On N/A 
Yuxiao Song Leave 2018 
Wei Su On Expected to leave in 2020 according to report cited above 
Xiangdong Chen On N/A 


 
Generally speaking, we are cautious on the company when employees/insiders are selling stocks and 
multiple co-founders are leaving so quickly.

Conclusion 





Our research and analysis supports our view that the competitive advantages GSX claims do not appear 
to actually exist. We have laid out our case in detail why we believe that in reality GSX employs nefarious 
schemes like order brushing and the use of non-consolidated entities to offload costs.  


In short: We believe that GSX is a fraud. 


One of the things that struck us as peculiar in this case is that GSX should not hold up to the due diligence 
of any credible institution. A simple online review would reveal that the company is not what it portrays 
itself to be. Red flags around the CFO departure were blatantly ignored. Financials that are simply too 
good to be true are taken at face value. GSX’s auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and underwriters including 
Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Credit Suisse have apparently failed to perform 
basic due diligence on their client – otherwise they should have easily detected at least some of the major 
red flags we outline in this report.  


We see GSX as yet another example of skewed incentives due to a lack of skin in the game, that will 
ultimately go to the detriment of the public investors.
