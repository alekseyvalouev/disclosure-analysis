Truth and Consequences


Miller has allegedly broken a few important promises of its own since Boruff first arrived on
the scene.


Boruff spent most of his career in the real estate business, his corporate bio indicates,
before shifting his focus to investment banking and then going on to replace his father-in-
law as CEO of Miller about three years ago. He landed his first job in the securities arena
at GunnAllen Financial, industry records show, a long-sullied firm finally shuttered by
regulators in March of last year.


“They’ve hired a lot of shady brokers,” one recruiter told a trade publication shortly before
Boruff joined the firm. “If you’re on the cusp of sloppiness, you could have a place at
GunnAllen.”


Miller nevertheless relied on GunnAllen to arrange a critical joint-venture deal –with the
brokerage firm and Boruff promised a combined 5.6% stake in the company for their
services – and likely came to regret that transaction. Aided by GunnAllen, records
indicate, Miller convinced Wind City Oil & Gas to buy $4.35 million worth of company stock
and then allegedly blocked its partner from exercising an option that would allow it to
reverse that deal. Wind City sued shortly after Boruff left GunnAllen to work at Cresta
Capital, records show, with Miller soon hiring a Cresta subsidiary (Consoleum) to work on
settling the complaint.


Miller wound up demoted from the OTC Bulletin Board to the dreaded Pink Sheets in the
meantime, records show, where its stock steadily faded to an all-time low of just 2 cents a
share.


In mid-2008, some two-and-a-half years after Miller forged that doomed partnership, the
company finally negotiated a deal that promised to end its costly legal woes. With the
assistance of Cresta and its own future CEO, records show, Miller raised $19.625 million

5/22/2018 Miller Energy: This Hot 'Alaska' Stock May Be About to Melt (Part 2) - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/282826-miller-energy-this-hot-alaska-stock-may-be-about-to-melt-part-2 2/9


by assigning some Tennessee leases to a larger energy company and gave Wind City
$10.65 million of that – more than double the cash it had received from its former partner
in the first place – so that it could put the dispute to rest.


“This is a huge deal,” Boroff told the local newspaper at the time. “The company has been
literally tied up in litigation for years.”


That month, records show, Boruff left Cresta – which would go on to become the
investment banker for fraud-riddled SpongeTech Delivery Systems (OTC:SPNGQ) – and
landed his current job shortly after that. Boruff officially became CEO of Miller in August of
2008, records show, when the company carried out another notable change as well.


At that point, records show, Miller retained Sherb as its independent auditing firm. Six
months later, armed with audited financial statements, Miller escaped from the Pink
Sheets and returned to the OTC Bulletin Board once again.


“One of the first orders of business when I became CEO,” Boruff proclaimed at the time,
“was to put in place the systems and relationships to assure that Miller always meet
(regulatory) filing deadlines.”


Miller recently fell short of that promised goal, however, when the company missed the
most critical filing deadline that it has faced since upgrading to a respectable auditing firm.
The company never filed an 8-K disclosing a recent legal setback, potentially material in
nature, either.


The month before Miller raised the cash that funded its big Wind City settlement, records
indicate, the company allegedly promised to sell the leasing rights that it had just signed
away to another firm called CNG Gas – at a much lower price – instead. Miller soon faced
a new lawsuit filed by CNX as a result, records show, but actually scored a legal victory for
a change when a trial court agreed in late 2008 to dismiss that complaint.


CNX overcame that ruling this May, however, when an appeals court reversed the original
decision and set the case on a path toward future trial. Although Miller loudly celebrated
its “huge” victory when it won that early round, the company buried news of its recent
setback near the end of a 100-page attachment to an 8-K filing – easily overlooked by
even astute investors – instead.


Meanwhile, Miller has long since rewarded Boruff for arranging the rival deal that triggered
that lawsuit. The company named him as its top executive just two months after it inked
that controversial transaction, records show, paying him a sign-on bonus of $300,000 that

5/22/2018 Miller Energy: This Hot 'Alaska' Stock May Be About to Melt (Part 2) - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/282826-miller-energy-this-hot-alaska-stock-may-be-about-to-melt-part-2 3/9


actually exceeded his entire $250,000 base salary for his first year. The company also
granted him 250,000 shares of restricted stock and options to purchase another 250,000 –
at just 33 cents a share – as well.


Miller then threw in an even bigger reward for Boruff’s “extraordinary efforts” in settling the
Wind City case, corporate filings show, issuing him 2.5 million shares of restricted stock to
compensate him for the “significant” payout he sacrificed when leaving Cresta to join the
company. But Miller had by then already paid off Cresta itself, records indicate, giving the
firm a combination of cash and warrants before showering its new CEO with a much larger
stock-based award for related (if not identical) services.


Miller has painted an awfully impressive picture of Boruff in the meantime, portraying him
as a veteran real estate broker – responsible for developing golf courses, convention
centers, hotels and condominiums – who “created several start-up ventures that grew into
multimillion-dollar companies” before he ever began his lengthy real estate
career.TheStreetSweeper searched an extensive news database for evidence of those
projects, however, and came away almost empty-handed in the end.


Boruff showed up on a list of players involved in a couple of real estate developments
more than a decade ago, but he generated no coverage for larger projects – such as golf
courses or convention centers – at all. He failed to attract media attention for the
“multimillion-dollar companies” that he reportedly launched, either, although court records
show that he did file for bankruptcy when doing business as CeeBee’s Rock ‘n Roll Café
back in 1994 and wound up slapped with numerous liens in the years that followed.


Friends and Foes


Miller employs another key executive tarnished by a past bankruptcy as well.


The month after Miller installed Boruff as its new CEO (and Sherb as its independent
auditing firm), records show, the company hired Paul Boyd to serve as its finance chief.
Boyd clearly needed the job, records indicate, since his former employer – where he
served as CFO for the previous seven years – had just filed for bankruptcy protection four
months earlier.


More recently, Miller hired a new president to fill the post abruptly vacated by Graham in
the middle of last year. David Voyticky assumed that position in June, records show, with
his generous salary eclipsing that set for the Vulcan leader he replaced.

5/22/2018 Miller Energy: This Hot 'Alaska' Stock May Be About to Melt (Part 2) - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/282826-miller-energy-this-hot-alaska-stock-may-be-about-to-melt-part-2 4/9


Specifically, records show, Miller has agreed to pay Voyticky a base salary of $475,000 a
year (more than double the sum promised to Graham) and a potential bonus that could
reach three times that amount. All told, records indicate, Voyticky could pocket $1.9 million
– or more than half of the total cash listed on Miller’s most recent balance sheet – for one
year of service to the company.


Miller actually welcomed Voyticky to the company in the spring of last year, records show,
when it appointed him to its board and assigned him a seat on its audit committee. But the
company hired Voyticky’s consulting firm to help it with financing activities a few months
later, records show, so it gave another director (who met independence requirements) that
committee assignment instead.


The better part of a year passed before Miller finally landed a new funding deal, records
show, with Voyticky – like his predecessor before him – credited for the “instrumental” role
he played in securing fresh resources for the company and winning a job as its new
president in the process. Although Miller wound up with a $100 million credit line, records
show, the company had to secure that loan with “substantially all” of its assets -- valued at
$500 million (on its official balance sheet) to more $1.2 billion (in a particularly generous
review of its Alaska prize) -- and agree to pay steep interest rates and sizable brokerage
fees in return.


Under the terms of that deal, corporate filings show, Miller must give Bristol up to $3
million – on top of the $10 million in principal, plus interest, it must repay to that Kessler-
led firm – in consulting fees for the credit line that the company publicly applauded (and
richly rewarded) its new president for arranging instead. As it turns out, company records
indicate, Keller and Voyticky have actually teamed up on other occasions and share ties –
through a notorious player in the penny-stock arena -- that extend well beyond Miller itself.


Earlier this month, records show, a microcap company led by Anthony “Tony” Cataldo – a
name connected to Kessler for years – appointed Voyticky to serve on its board. Both
Cataldo and Kessler previously surfaced at a doomed penny-stock outfit known as VoIP,
records show, before that company – later targeted by regulators, along with its auditor,
for allegedly engaging in fraud – wound up forced into involuntary bankruptcy under a pile
of unpaid bills.


A former finance manager at VoIP blamed both Cataldo and the company’s biggest
financial backers, including Kessler himself, for that disaster and the pain that it ultimately
caused.

5/22/2018 Miller Energy: This Hot 'Alaska' Stock May Be About to Melt (Part 2) - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/282826-miller-energy-this-hot-alaska-stock-may-be-about-to-melt-part-2 5/9


“How could a group of intelligent, experienced men such as yourselves allow a business
enterprise to self-destruct and cause so much human suffering?” Monique Costantino, the
company’s former treasury manager, challenged in a letter to Kessler and other big VoIP
stakeholders a few years ago. “You now have rooms full of paper, equipment and furniture
… but no human resources, other than the two least experienced employees: Tony
Cataldo and his son. It doesn’t sound very promising.”


Cataldo now serves as chairman and CEO of Genesis Biopharma (GNBP.OB), a microcap
company – viewed as a likely “scam” by online critics of its controversial leader – that just
welcomed Voyticky as the newest member of its board. Voyticky serves as a director of
Best Energy Services (OTC:BEYSQ), an obscure penny-stock company (with a disabled
website) that counts Kessler among its largest shareholders, as well. That stock currently
trades on the Pink Sheets for a fraction of a penny a share.


Like Boruff before him, however, Voyticky sounded like a prize catch upon his arrival to the
Miller executive suite. When the company introduced Voyticky as its new president,
records show, it portrayed him as an accomplished investment banker – who actually
served as vice president of Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in the
past – and never mentioned any ties to the penny-stock world, where Miller had spent
most of its own life, at all.


Aches and Pains


In fairness, Miller has also installed some actual veterans of the energy industry to help it
run the show.


When Miller purchased CIE -- issuing warrants for 3.5 million shares of stock, priced at a
penny to $2 a share, as payment -- the company also hired CIE’s top three executives as
part of that celebrated deal. Miller awarded all of them multi-year contracts with six-figure
salaries, records show, but terminated the CFO Troy Stafford barely five months later.


According to court documents, Stafford arranged a key consulting agreement with an outfit
known as VAI that ultimately led to the acquisition deal. In recent months, records show,
both Stafford and VAI have sued Miller for allegedly failing to honor its obligations after
that acquisition closed.


Stafford sued the company in May, seeking more than $650,000 in cash (for wages and
severance) and warrants valued at roughly $2.7 million at the time. He may need those
funds, records indicate, since he faces a default judgment in a separate case that accuses

5/22/2018 Miller Energy: This Hot 'Alaska' Stock May Be About to Melt (Part 2) - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/282826-miller-energy-this-hot-alaska-stock-may-be-about-to-melt-part-2 6/9


him of swindling an investor – by selling 20% of a bogus seafood company – to raise
money for his own 20% stake in CIE ahead of its lucrative sale.


The month after Stafford sued Miller, records show, VAI filed an even bigger lawsuit
against the company. According to that complaint, VAI played a critical role in Miller’s
acquisition of CIE but -- despite written agreements in advance – never received any
payment for its services. VAI is now seeking court-ordered enforcement of those alleged
agreements, with demands for warrants to purchase 1.75 million shares of Miller stock
(the equivalent of 4.4% of the company’s outstanding share count) priced at just a penny a
share.


Meanwhile, Miller has appointed two directors to its board – Jonathan Gross and Don
Turkleson -- who lost their jobs at Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) when that company
almost collapsed a few years ago under a staggering mountain of debt. Gross became the
first major Cheneire executive terminated during that crisis, a trade publication noted at
the time, with a once-bullish analyst slashing his former $20 target price on the company’s
stock to just $1 a share right before Gross walked out the door.


Turkleson hit the exit the following year, records show, resigning from his longtime post as
the company’s CFO with just a single month of severance pay and some restricted stock
that he could not unload during a well-timed insider selling spree. Turkleson personally
sold more than $5 million worth of Cheniere stock at double-digit prices during that
massive insider dump, records show, prompting at least one nervous analyst to
recommend that ordinary investors shed their own stock in the company – as it continued
a hairy march all the way below $1 – as well


“There are so many fine energy companies,” Bernard Picchi of Wall Street Access told the
Houston Chronicle at the time. “Why would you want to mess with this one?”


Although Cheniere has rebounded off the dismal lows it set after Gross and Turkleson
departed, the company – still burdened by an onerous debt load -- never fully recovered
and in fact landed on a list of possible bankruptcy candidates as recently as February of
this year.


Meanwhile, despite its stunning gains, Miller has since lost some analyst support of its
own. C.K. Cooper downgraded Miller from buy to hold in March, records show, and then
followed up this week – shortly after the company missed the deadline to file its audited
financials -- by dropping coverage of the name altogether.

Notably, on the very day that Miller reported a delay in filing that crucial report, The Motley
Fool sounded its own alarm about the company’s stock. It portrayed Miller as a risky
highflier – its shares boosted by possible accounting games -- that could soon find itself
spiraling back to earth.


“Since the purchase (of its Alaskan) assets and subsequent one-time gain, Miller’s stock
has nearly tripled,” The Motley Fool observed about two weeks ago. “But is this
warranted? I’d say no …


“Miller Energy Resources continues to work its slight-of-hand tricks on paper,” the Fool
declared, “but it’s not fooling me!”


Disclosure: TheStreetSweeper, through its members, began establishing a short position
in Miller Energy Resources on June 24 and has now shorted a total of 129,441 shares of
the company’s stock at an average price of $7.07 a share. It expects to profit on future
declines in the stock by covering its short position at a lower price and will fully disclose
the details of its transactions as they occur.

Oh so me get this straight, First establish a short position then use your contacts to spread your venom.... seems to
me like a one sided story with no fair balance.....

This is like cheap, trashy tabloid journalism. I am glad I only scanned it.

Very good, thorough due diligence, and well written report, thanks. Your firm deserves all the gains you made from
your short position.


I was wondering, I saw that Street Sweeper covered its short position, most of its shares at $3.76, and I was
wondering why you covered at that price. Do you think the stock is worth over $4 a share?

This is the second time a FAIRY TALE published on SEEKING ALFA by a heavy shorter trashing a good company
has cost me money the first company 3 months later has only regained 60% of it's pre attack value and now you've
done it to Mill. I hope everyone at Street Sweeper and Seeking Alpha made a lot of money on the short.Maybe one
pissed off investor can't do anything but the SEC has already gotten my complaint and many more.Yellow Journalism
at it's worse.I held didn't sell I don't know if that makes me stupid but when the better adviser publications didn't jump
on the part 1 then the total trash I knew this was BS. Unfortunately you scared someone enough or was that stock
that was accumilated then dumped in mass to GET THE SHORT PLAY ROLLING.I want $3 a share times 3000 from
you and Street Sweeper for your so blatant manipulation of this stock

Check out the facts for yourself. It is not that hard. See if it is true or false. I have been wondering when someone
would shed some bright light on Mill.  
Check it out.

People need to look carefully at this stock. The CEO still running around claiming he purchased the same assets that
Pacific purchased for $400+MM even discussing this valuation in the open letter to the shareholders. The reality is
Miller purchased only a fraction of what Pacific purchased- Miller did not get the exploration acerage that included
Corsair (Now Kitchen Lights) about to be driller but more importantly they did not get the interests in TBU and TBF
where over 2/3 of the prodcution and even more of the resereves are. Miller purchased the Redoubt asset and some
small onshore production assets that when Pacific purchased them were valued at less than $50MM. I am surprised
that no one has pointed this out and that the CEO continues to perpetuate this lie that he knows in NOT true.

Thanks for sending the post. I have been cleaning out my "dogs and cats" at the beginning of 2015. My stock talk on
$SPNGQ brought me to this board------$SPNGQ -------often buying stocks based upon what I use or in a new market I
bought that stock.


Looks like that stock is both a dead cat and dead dog.
