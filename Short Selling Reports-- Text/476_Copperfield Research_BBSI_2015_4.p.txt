BBSI - Garbage
In, Garbage Out
Feb. 4, 2015 3:16 PM ET3 comments | Includes: Barrett Buâ€¦


There is not a lot else that can be said as it relates to Barrett Business
Services (NASDAQ:BBSI). You either blindly believe in the moving numbers
and management that is self-proclaimed as strong as "tempered steel".... or
you don't. While our arithmetic is fallible like everybody else with a
spreadsheet, we at a minimum try to understand the garbage going in and
coming out. This basic desire to understand how a guided number is built
makes us a bit different than the two sell-side buddies of BBSI management.


In its earnings press release, management guided 2015 EPS to $3.30 per
share for 2015. Coincidently, this was precisely inline with the average of the
two estimates ($3.31 to be precise based on estimates of $3.46 and $3.15).
The basic drivers BBSI management provided lead to an EPS number that is
starkly different (lower of course) than their inline headline number. The
publicly stated disclosures include: 18% revenue growth, a workers'
compensation accrual between 4.8% and 5% of gross revenue, and a mid-to-
high 30's % tax rate. The company will have around $1.5 million of
incremental interest expense based on their maturity schedule. Direct payroll
costs and payroll taxes have been relatively consistent for years (and they are
already benefiting from applying prior wages against the taxable wage basis as
new customers are onboard). The only significant unknown variable is SG&A
expense. On its fourth quarter 2014 conference call this morning,
management stated that they plan to invest in additional business units,
geographies, and related "structural and organizational build," which would
seem to suggest continued SG&A growth. If we conservatively assume SG&A
grows at a mere 14% (compared to 18% top-line guidance), then a basic
model seems to calculate an earnings estimate of $2.25 per share at a 5%
accrual. This is approximately 33% lower than management's guidance.

Using the lower end of the accrual range (4.8%), we still calculate an earnings
number of $2.94 per share, significantly below the $3.30 of guidance (see
model at end of the document). It is worth noting that a number of
incremental costs will now be flowing through the workers' compensation
accrual. Management seemed to suggest that the incremental surety bond
expense and letter of credit expense will now flow through the workers'
compensation accrual. If their California surety bond covers the size of their
reserves, or roughly $185 to $195 million, then this is a large probable step-up
expense. In addition, ACE will collect full fronting fees and BBSI will have to
pass through premium taxes to the State of California (PEOs avoided this tax
prior to having their licenses revoked). We estimate that BBSI's "other
workers' comp expense," which covers commissions, fronting, reinsurance and
other expenses, was running near 1.6% of gross revenue in the second half of
2014. If this increases to only 1.7% with additional ACE costs and surety / line
of credit expenses, management's 4.8% to 5% workers' compensation accrual
guidance implies the claims expense accrual (what actually builds reserves to
cover future workers' comp claims) would be running at, or below, the levels
of 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013. As we ultimately found out, those accrual

levels resulted in BBSI being significantly under reserved. These years
included a claims expense accrual of 2.37% to 3.11%, which increased
significantly from the company's third quarter 2014 reserve charge. By
comparison, we estimate the 2015 claims expense accrual implied in
management's guidance will only be 2.52% to 2.72%. As such, we view the
4.8% to 5% accrual as an aggressive assumption.


We can address BBSI's strained liquidity at a later date. However, we found it
amusing (we'll avoid any stronger language) that management pointed to $25
million of restricted cash freeing up this year from California. This cash will
only free up as they pay out $25 million of claims (so no real incremental cash
flow from the balance sheet). We have previously pointed out that free cash
flow is a highly questionable statistic for an insurance company that is growing
their exposure in long-tail claim payments. Regardless, BBSI had roughly $65
million of free cash flow in 2014. Of this $65 million, more than $50 million
was needed to fund the ACE trust account alone. Contributions into the ACE
trust account could double in 2015, in which case a large negative cash flow
hole would exist prior to the $25 million of Wells Fargo debt that is scheduled
to mature. The only way BBSI we envision BBSI generating sufficient cash flow

to fund its growing liabilities would be to continue to under price its workers'
compensation business to attract new customers, with the hope claims
expense down the road somehow improves. We continue to think this ends
badly and believe shares have significant downside from current levels.

Good recap, thanks....

Ken,


You see, assuming you believe BBSI's
staffing business will maintain its 2014
gross margin into 2015, then you believe

that the gross margin of the PEO business
will expand a mere 5 basis points from
2014 into 2015, despite the fact that BBSI
is regularly increasing its client markup to
account for its higher WC expense. As
well, your model shows WC/rev at 5.0%,
whereas BBSI clearly stated 4.8% to
5.0%. If you add another 20 bps to the
PEO gross margin, and reduce WC/rev by
10 bps, you get to $3.30.


Plus, what do you think the chances are
that BBSI experiences some positive
reserve development in the coming
quarters? I think the chances are very
high, based on how claims are being
closed.
