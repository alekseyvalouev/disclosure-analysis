8) History of Auditor Turnover, Shockingly Low Audit Fees and Accounting Red
Flags


Investors should view EBIX's stated financials with extreme skepticism given the myriad
accounting and oversight issues. EBIX has had four different auditors over the past
seven years. Two of the three auditors TERMINATED their relationship with EBIX per
the company’s own filings. The only Big Four firm who audited the company was KPMG.
According to the EBIX's filings, "KPMG LLP resigned as the independent registered
public accounting firm of our Company" (our emphasis). Just prior to its resignation,
KPMG found:

(1) delegation of authority and what KPMG considered to be inadequate reviews by a
person other than the preparer of accounting information, (2) the lack of a formalized
contract review process to ensure proper revenue recognition, (3) the lack of a
complete understanding of the Company’s income tax positions and related
accounts, (4) inadequate documentation for certain unusual transactions (including
the basis for the Company’s accounting conclusions), and (5) internal control matters
(documented and testable control environment) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.


Shortly after KPMG resigned, EBIX's new auditor, BPO Seidman, also "identified certain
significant deficiencies relating to the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting." In another peculiar move, "on December 12, 2008, Ebix, Inc. received notice
from Habif, Arogeti & Wynne, LLP of its decision not to stand for re-appointment as
Ebix’s independent registered public accountant."


This is particularly shocking because Habif, Arogeti & Wynne is a small Georgia
accounting firm. A public company like EBIX would be a prized client for a small firm like
this. Additionally EBIX is in their backyard geographically. However, they decided to walk
away. EBIX current auditor is the tiny firm Cherry, Bekaert & Holland. Despite the
complexities of EBIX's financial shelters, EBIX only paid Cherry, Bekaert & Holland
$343,250 and $262,500 for their 2009 and 2008 audits, respectively.


Management has suggested to analysts and investors that they changed auditors due to
high fees and lack of presence in Atlanta. We find this explanation spurious at best.
First, the company's own filings do not support that conclusion. Second, the history of
audit fees at the company has been extraordinarily low (Table 15). And finally, each of
these accounting firms has today, and always had, a major presence in the Atlanta
market (including BDO).

We compared EBIX's audit fees to other public companies that analysts have used as
comps for EBIX (we would disagree with some as explained below). EBIX pays audit
fees that are a fraction of these companies.

On conference calls, the CEO has stated that some of these former accounting firms
have performed non-audit work as evidence that his company is not an accounting
fraud. We would remind investors that Arthur Andersen was not put out of business
because of their consulting work at Enron or E&Y was not charged with fraud at Lehman
because of their tax work, it was because of the audit practices and procedures (the
sacred cow of the Big Four business). We believe it is well known that accounting firms
are much more judicious selecting audit clients, and much less so with non-assurance
engagements.

Frequent auditor changes are not the only questionable corporate governance issue at
EBIX. In 2009, the board of director's approved one of the more unusual provisions that
we have ever reviewed. EBIX's board "unanimously approved" a change in control
provision. Under the provision, Robin Raina is guaranteed a cash payment of 20% of
the difference between the transaction price and the valuation of the company at $7.95
per share in the event of a change in control.


While we highly doubt any buyer would pay anything near the current price for EBIX's
hodge-podge of rolled up companies, the point is the Board is dominated by the CEO.
Hypothetically, if EBIX could find a buyer, it would be Robin Raina who would get the
massive payday, not shareholders.


9) Controversial CEO Appears to Demonstrate a History of Misrepresentation


The CEO of EBIX, Robin Raina, dominates the organization. According to the latest
proxy statement, Raina's compensation was 1,250% higher than any other employee at
EBIX. His cash compensation represented 12.3% and 15.9% of total general and
administrative expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively. To our knowledge, Raina does
not allow analysts or investors access to other members of his management team. This
alone is cause for concern about what Robin is hiding. The company's lack of bench
strength will be on full display at their second ever analyst day on April 1st. This was
apparent in the first investor day, held in December 2009.


The CEO has also sensationalized his history of charitable work. We highly admire
charity work and believe people should be commended for it, especially those who
conduct charitable work without the need for publicity or recognition. We do not believe
Robin Raina and his "Robin Raina Foundation," fall into this category. The foundation's
noble goal is to provide support for poor children in India. We commend the goal, but we
question the execution. The foundation's website contains what appear to be outlandish
statements, including:


He spends two continuous months every year working in the slums – meeting
children, interacting with parents, helping build homes, playing cricket with blind kids
etc. This is in addition to visiting India once every few months to do the same. On a
typical day you could see him work 18 hours leading from the front.

Today, he his [sic] foundation has adopted in excess of 3500 children across the
Indian sub continent in addition to presently carrying out the largest private charity
initiative in the Indian sub-continent, in terms of building 6000 homes free of cost for
the underprivileged.


FINAL SUMMARIZATION: When you consider his absolute excellence in the area of
public service, it leaves you rather dazzled. When you consider that he does that
while running one of the most successful companies on the NASDAQ with a
shareholder return of 4,720% over the last 5 years, you marvel at his abilities to
balance his zeal for charity with his work.


More troubling than the aggrandized claims is that they appear inconsistent with IRS
filings. Given the claims, we assumed the foundation was a hundred million dollar
organization. Information on the charity is available for 2004 through 2008. The charity
is much smaller than The Raina Foundation suggests. Through 2007, the charity had
less than $250,000 in assets. In 2008, assets grew with the addition of "equity
securities," assumed to be EBIX stock.


Table 17 - Charity Assets


2004 2005 2006 2007 2008


Total Assets $136,714 $232,292 $246,292 $246,794 $1,560,795


Source: IRS Form 990s


We found the 2007 IRS filing very peculiar. In 2007, the Robin Raina Foundation spent
$143,933 (versus $246,794 of assets) on two fundraisers that "required a number of
Bollywood singers performing for charity reasons" and "required the Indian musical
legend Anup Jilota to sing his melodies to the crowd with his entire band in a live
concert…at the Ashiana Restaurant." Also, in 2007 the foundation listed then EBIX CFO
Richard Baum as the person responsible for the foundation's "books". In 2007 and 2008,
EBIX donated $66,000 of shareholder money to the Robin Raina foundation.

In 2010, EBIX donated $39,000 to the foundation. Again, our aim in not attacking
charitable work. What is apparent is that the charity seems to stroke Raina's ego by
generating an enormous amount of press for the small organization and supported by
the production of strange video tributes to Raina. It also appears that the enormous
claims about the organization do not match the size and scope of its assets. By
extension, it would seem that the charity has misrepresented its true character. We only
highlight this because we see a similar misrepresentation with EBIX's businesses.


10) SaaS Provider? We Think Not


EBIX has held itself out as a SaaS vendor - a business description that couldn't be
further from the truth. In its press releases, EBIX describes its business with the
statement: "through its various SaaS-based software platforms." Investors and analysts
apparently have taken the bait. A recent initiation report by a firm called Craig Hallum
described EBIX as "a provider of SaaS-based solutions for the insurance sector." A
recent article on Seeking Alpha compared SaaS darling Salesforce.com (CRM) to EBIX.
We find this comparison absurd.


SaaS business models are highly attractive for good reason. With a SaaS model, a
company is able to collect subscription payments quarters or even years in advance,
creating large deferred revenue. The SaaS provider has visibility into its earnings model
as most of the revenue and earnings are pulled from the balance sheet. As a result,
deferred revenue and bookings are the most important factor for SaaS stocks. In
reviewing EBIX's results, the deferred revenue is virtually non-existent and has
experienced negligible growth despite all of the acquisitions.

This discrepancy is even more dramatic when you compare EBIX to "real" SaaS
companies like Salesforce.com (CRM), Netsuite (N), SuccessFactors (SFSF), and Taleo
(TLEO). As Table 19 illustrates, these companies typically have 1.5 to 4 quarters of
deferred revenue on their balance sheet. In contrast, EBIX's deferred revenues can be
measured in days and weeks due to its transactional nature. As a result, EBIX has
minimal visibility relative to real SaaS providers.


Other parts of the income statements are also vastly different. The SaaS vendors listed
below spend 40% - 50% of revenues on sales and marketing. EBIX spends 4.6% of
revenues on sales and marketing, while R&D expense is roughly one-third compared to
the other group.

Another misrepresentation is EBIX's liberal use of the word "exchanges." According to
EBIX, 70% of their revenues are derived from "exchanges." Listening to EBIX, an
investor might expect them to operate a vibrant exchange where insurance policies
trade back and forth in huge volumes as EBIX captures a piece of the spread. The same
Craig Hallum initiation report on EBIX stated that "insurance exchanges are a greenfield
opportunity with few comparables in other sectors."


In reality, these niche products are simply order entry systems and comparative raters,
which have been around for decades and represent a highly competitive industry in
insurance. EBIX states as much in the 10-k: "We operate in highly competitive markets.
In particular, the online insurance distribution market, like the broader electronic
commerce market, is rapidly evolving and highly competitive." EBIX's three most
important products in their "exchange" segment are Winflex, LifeSpeed and Annuitynet.
In its latest 10-k, the company describes each of these products as:


"Winflex is an exchange for pre-sale life insurance illustrations."

Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and

"LifeSpeed is an order entry platform."


"This exchange [Annuitynet] is an order entry platform for annuity transactions."


Simply put, Winflex is a comparative rater and LifeSpeed and AnnuityNet are order entry
systems. This view is supported by EBIX's competition. In reviewing company literature
for EBIX's private comps like Blue From and iPipeline, they describe their products as
"order entry," "order management," and compliance programs. The word "exchange" is
not used by EBIX's private competition. This is just another attempt by EBIX to
manipulate investor perception.


Conclusion


EBIX is a house of cards. EBIX currently trades at 20x 2010 EBITDA. EBIX trades at
16x 2011 EBITDA, or a 35% premium to the average multiple of high quality financial
software providers that focus on banks, insurance, and other financials (SLH, SONE,
ACIW, ONE, EPAY). EBIX investors face material downside and have significant
exogenous risk from regulatory, tax, or oversight investigations. With a 5% organic
growth rate, 28% operating margins (adjusted for the accounting irregularities and
massive underinvestment in sales and R&D), and 35% tax rate, the company has less
than $0.75 of earnings power currently.


This margin would still represent one of the highest in the industry. At a very generous
market multiple of 12x earnings (given minimal organic growth, a roll-up strategy, and
issues presented above), we believe the stock is worth no more than $9.00 per share.
