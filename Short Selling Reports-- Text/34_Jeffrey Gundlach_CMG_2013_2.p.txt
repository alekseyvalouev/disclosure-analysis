The image above is of the street-facing windows and facade at the New York Yacht Club,
poured and molded concrete in the shape of a ship’s stern. It’s one of the many
landmarks on 44th Street, a few doors down from my office, and the site of the
DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach for the third year running.


I took a bunch of notes from the lunch and have assembled them in a logical order below,
just as I’ve done for you the past two years (see 2011 here and 2012 here for reference).


Without further ado, here’s what I took away from the event:

5/20/2018 Notes from the DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach, Spring 2013


http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 3/22


First off, no matter how many times you’re in this room, you never get over how incredible
it is. You’re surrounded by carved wood and centuries-old ships’ prows, adornments and
other artifacts of the city’s seafaring distant past. It’s truly magnificent, if you can ever find
a reason to get in there I suggest you check it out.


Jeff and I chatted a bit before he took the podium, I think he’s sick of looking up and
seeing me on the firm’s TV screens. He doesn’t watch much financial television and, as a
contrarian, really only uses it to find out what the consensus is all hopped up about at any
given time.


I should mention that he’s the most consistently well-dressed money manager I know
(and I go to an awful lot of conferences). I’m not sure why this might be important to you,
but the congruency of a Bond King looking the part is important to me. I think I might start
doing some pocket squares and stuff myself later this year…


Anyway.


Jeff’s presentation was entitled “Why Own Any Bonds At All” and it speaks to the recent
zeitgeist surrounding the concept that the Fed has made it so that stocks are the only
game in town and bonds are useless.


Gundlach respectfully disagrees. The purpose of his talk today was to show that, while
the bond market is not exactly the free lunch it became in 2009-2010, there’s still plenty
of fruit hanging from the tree if you know which orchards to look in. Jeff demonstrates
why the Fed’s policies literally cannot change any time soon and how investors can use
this as an opportunity.


Most of the below is me paraphrasing, but where you see something in quote’s it’s
Jeffrey. Let’s begin…


We’ve heard this question before
For starters, this isn’t the first time the investor class has questioned whether they should
own bonds at all. The last era during which this was an open question was 1997 – but for
different reasons.


In 1997, bonds and stocks were positively correlated. When bonds went down, stocks did
too. But when bonds went up, stocks went up even more. And so why bother with the
5/20/2018 Notes from the DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach, Spring 2013


http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 4/22


bonds at all, went the thinking.  US bond yields in 1997 were 6%, so you can just imagine
how much higher the expectations were for stock returns then!


Jeff loves the Japanese comparison and uses it here – in 1989, the year the Nikkei
(Japan’s stocks) peaked, Japanese government bonds were also yielding 6% – obviously
Japanese bonds were the (much) better buy then versus stocks.


No bond bubble
America does not “over-own” bonds.”Raise your hand if you own a Treasury mutual fund
for yourself or your clients…”  No hands go up in the entire room (maybe out of
embarrassment or because the salads were served).


If anything, relative to the rest of the developed world American households over-own
stocks and are perhaps equal to the rest of the world in terms of bond holdings.  The
below chart is Net Worth in Financial Assets by Country, the black portion of the bar is
bond ownership and the dark blue is equities:

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 5/22


There’s no bubble in bonds. Gundlach is amused by those claiming that the bond market
is on the verge of some kind of imminent collapse. “They’re dead wrong.”


Why do American households own so much stock compared to other countries?
Gundlach believes that the massive wealth polarization in our country versus other
countries plays a role – so much of our wealth is concentrated amongst the very rich,
who tend to own stocks.


QE and ZIRP are a New Way of Life
Gundlach laughs whenever the Fed Minutes come out or a governor speaks and people
search for clues about the end of monetary stimulus or accomodative low rates. Not
happening this year or next.

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 6/22


Publicly made comments and dissent is just talk.  The entire world is embarking on what
Gundlach refers to as “the circular financing scheme”. The below slide shows how just
about every single country in the world is currently running a trade deficit at the same
time – “How is this even possible?”  The answer is the circular scheme being perpetuated
around the world (Bank of Japan, Bank of England, the ECB and the Fed are all
expanding their balance sheets at the rate of 3.5% of GDP per annum). “This is what
Krugman says is the answer to five millennias-worth of human struggle. Maybe he’s right
but it seems a little too easy.”


See below, that’s central bank balance sheets, January 1995 through January 2013:


He mentions that Ben Bernanke has publicly stated he sees “no observable negative
consequences” from this activity and that Janet Yellen is even more dovish, has made
comments about allowing this to run through 2025 if need be.

5/20/2018 Notes from the DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach, Spring 2013


http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 7/22


The trade deficit is what’s supporting the US economy and the Fed’s purchasing is the
only thing keeping interest expense low enough to allow the government to continue
running a trillion dollar deficit. We know that the only glue holding this altogether right
now is that the interest we’re paying on government debt is manageable – no one is
going to pull that chair out from under us on purpose.


Combine this with the state of the labor market and you know the Fed is going nowhere.
When they say that they’re pondering the end of QE, Jeff says “Of course they’re
pondering it, gee I would hope so!” but this does not mean they are considering an exit
right now. He believes the exit will look like a run-off of the existing treasury and
mortgage bond portfolio as the bonds the Fed holds mature – but not an outright sale of
the portfolio.  “There’s a better chance Bernanke buys every Treasury bond in existence
before he ever sells a single one”


Gundlach breaks out the fan favorite slide – Bernanke’s Wheel of Fortune:



http://ep60qmdjq8-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wheel.png

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 8/22


All of the options in yellow have already been attempted.  Gundlach says that of the
remaining, default is not going to happen and the long-rumored “print and pay” that the
policy bears fret about is “not timely.”  He says print and pay may happen someday but
we’re simply not there yet, too early. He mentions that removing the tax benefit from muni
bond interest for ultra-high net worth households is likely which keeps him cautious about
the muni market in general. Entitlement reform would be nice – but when you poll
Americans you realize that this has the support of only 10% of the population (about the
same percentage as believes in Bigfoot) and so it won’t happen – you could never get
elected.


How to play continuation of the Fed’s policies
So if we know that QE and ZIRP are here to stay for the time being, is the answer stocks
or bonds?  Jeffrey says stocks maybe but bonds definitely. He notes that quantitative
easing has had no effect on the commodities complex (CRB index) but the “transfer
mechanism has weirdly benefited stocks.”


The below is the cumulative effect of QE on the stock market:
5/20/2018 Notes from the DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach, Spring 2013


http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 9/22


But it is the bond market that has the real “put” he says, and not the stock market. 
Quantitative easing “goes right through the heart of the bond market.”  Which is one of
the reasons why Gundlach is back to buying longer-dated Treasurys with some of his
portfolio.


Speaking of the labor market…
…it still sucks no matter what the headlines say. The participation rate is alarming. The
old people won’t retire (they can’t) and the one thing you can’t fake – employment-to-
population – has not improved.  On top of which, right now we’ve got 40 million
Americans age 65 and older. In 15 years we’ll have 70 million age 65 and older! This

large, aging population, he argues, is a bullish factor (or at least a supportive one) for the
bond market.

The bottom line is that this jobs picture is not conducive for any kind of ZIRP or QE exit
anytime soon, hence continued support for the bond market.

What to do in the bond market
So if you agree that bonds are the bigger beneficiary of ZIRP-forever, what can you with
a bond portfolio? Some key points Gundlach makes:


Investors have been spoiled by bond indexing – because it has worked. Here’s the total
return of the long bond vs the S&P etc over the last 40 years:


But those days are over.


If you look at the major bond indexes (like the Barclays Aggregate) they are overloaded
with Treasurys which have the lowest yields. Average durations for the Aggregate index
have remained around 5 or so – interest rate risk hasn’t gone up, in other words – but

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 14/22


yields-to-maturity have collapsed to around 2%. There’s not much in the traditional index
left to scrape up, in essence. This is the anti-passive, anti-bond ETF argument.


So being selective will work better than just going with the index going forward.  In the
below slide, perhaps the most important, Jeff shows how the “non-traditional” sectors of
the market differ greatly from the more mainstream, developed ones in terms of yield.
These outside-the-index areas are where there is still fruit left on the trees:


Jeff mentions that the single best area of investment grade fixed income right now is
dollar-denominated emerging market corporate bonds. He still favors non-agency MBS
but these credits will continue to be bid higher and then disappear, un-replaced.


He believes that when private financing (non-Fannie, non-Freddie) does return to the
mortgage markets, it will create tremendous opportunities for bond investors.

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 15/22


He mentions bank loans being an interesting area for opportunity as well. The caveat is
that the higher yield stuff should be paired with something like a Treasury for risk
management purposes (barbell strategy?). I should note that DoubleLine is launching a
floating rate bank loan fund shortly.


He also likes high yield corporate as he believes default rates should stay low given
balance sheet strength – even if profit margins mean-revert lower. In this regard, Jeffrey
agrees with John Hussman that 70%+ is probably the peak for the cycle and
unsustainable. This shouldn’t hurt corporate bonds, however, the impact on stocks is
debatable.


A word on Japan
Jeffrey mentions that Japan is important to watch for several reasons. He calls it the
“Pace car for stock market peaks, weird policy responses and currency debasement.” 
He sees it as a template for how the rest of the world will deal with deflation and
demographic issues. When queried about the Japanese stock rally, he mentions that he
went bullish on Japanese equities last November and people told him him he was an
idiot. A big time “Republican center of influence guy” emailed him “Don’t you know that
Japan is where capital goes to die?”


Looking forward, Jeff says it’s hard to imagine that the 50% rally in the Japanese market
just stops on a dime and reverses itself to the downside.


Besides, he thinks that over time – not tomorrow but one day – the only way the
Japanese can ever deal with their debt level is more debasement so a Yen at 200 over
the USD is conceivable.


Japan, most importantly, illustrates to investors that bond yields can stay low for as long
as they want to.


Odds and Ends


When we got to the Q&A the first thing people wanted to hear was a comment on Jeff’s
now legendary pairs trade from last summer. I was in the room when he mentioned he
liked “Short Apple versus 100X long Natural Gas futures” – he was demonstrating the
ridiculousness of the consensus at the time, which was that Apple could never go down
and natural gas was headed to zero. Obviously, he nailed it and the opposite happened.

http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 16/22


Nat gas almost doubled from there and Apple was just about cut in half from its high.
World-renowned for his modesty, Jeff mentions that the trade was actually even better
than we all think it was because “it was never down even or a single day.”  My table – all
wealth management guys with big egos (i’d presume) – got a kick out of that.


Here’s the chart of his pairs trade’s performance:


When asked for a new miracle trade, the manager demurred a bit but then mentioned
that he would short Chipotle – which promptly knocked the stock down 8 points once the
media reported my tweet from the event, what a world we live in! Jeff’s point – much the
same as David Einhorn’s from last fall – is that the multiple is quite high for what is
essentially an “oxymoron” product, the “gourmet burrito”. He’ll be at the Ira Sohn Value
Investing Conference in May (as will I) and so maybe we’ll get more detail on this idea
then.

5/20/2018 Notes from the DoubleLine Lunch with Jeffrey Gundlach, Spring 2013


http://thereformedbroker.com/2013/04/12/notes-from-the-doubleline-lunch-with-jeffrey-gundlach-spring-2013/ 17/22


He was asked about preferred stock as a way to cope with the low rate environment and
admitted he had no opinion (first time I’ve ever heard him punt on a question). Like
Socrates, he admits to knowing what he doesn’t know.


Nobody asked Jeffrey about gold for the first time – he was very surprised by this so he
brought it up himself. He thinks that as fear of systemic collapse rolls away in the short
term, gold should continue to slide. He mentioned $1200 an ounce as a possible target
but didn’t seem emphatic one way or the other.


There was a question about assets under management and getting too big to be an
effective total return investor.  DoubleLine currently manages $56 billion – $40 billion of
which is in Jeff’s Total Return flagship (full disclosure – we own this fund in client
accounts at our shop and have since inception). Jeff thinks anything over $100 billion
would hurt the strategy and $75 billion may even be too much. He takes a dig at “trillion
dollar bond funds” in that they’re forced to use derivatives and swaps and as such they
have counterparty risk, the single worst thing in Gundlach’s eyes (he refers to it as
“rewardless risk”).  DoubleLine is actively rolling out funds in new categories (there’s
even a hedge fund in the works) and may soft-close Total Return at some point soon
should the inflows continue at the current pace.


I asked the last question of the day. At the 2011 lunch he mentioned that high net worth
investors ought to keep a portion of their wealth outside of banks and the traditional
financial system so I brought up Bitcoin in that context. He said he really prefers to own
things like fine art (he is an avid collector – I was awed by I saw in the lobby and hallways
of DoubleLine’s L.A. office when I visited this past fall) as well as precious gemstones.
“People scoff when I mention gems as an investment – then I tell them that I possess
some of the most flawless, perfectly formed emeralds in the world and they beg to see
them.”  Jeffrey thinks Bitcoin is a “mega mania” and a gimmick, not a currency. “I’d rather
own diamonds and Picassos.”


Spoken like a true boss.

Anyway, hope this was helpful for you. Taking these kinds of notes and then putting them
together for you helps me learn and absorb a great deal as well – so thanks for reading!
