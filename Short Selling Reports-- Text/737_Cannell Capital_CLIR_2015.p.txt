A Windfall Or A Whiff? ClearSign's Kern County Prospects May Be
Less Than Golden
Sep. 29, 2015 9:17 AM ET58 comments
by: Cannell Capital LLC


Summary


Lou Basenese speculates that pending environmental changes in Kern County could
account for $156 million in revenues.


A close reading of the prospective regulations in Kern County does not bear this out.


Even if Mr. Basenese's overly optimistic revenue assumptions were true, ClearSign
would still be grossly overvalued.


This article provides a counterbalance to the opinions and representations made by Mr.
Louis Basenese in his September 9, 2015, Seeking Alpha article entitled "ClearSign
Combustion: California Regulator Poised To Deliver A $156 Million Sales Windfall?"


Mr. Basenese presents Kern County's plans with regards to the products of ClearSign
Combustion Coporation (NASDAQ:CLIR) as all but finalized. In fact, Kern County is only
part way through the multi-step process of reviewing environmental matters. While county
has drafted revised ordinances that might favor CLIR, the county is legally required to
consider many alternatives. Only one of the six alternatives under consideration would
require the use of the particular technology which CLIR hopes to sell.


Mr. Basenese writes that:


"We could be less than six months away from such a monumental regulatory ruling,
whereby operators will be required to install CLIR's Duplex burner on all new and
existing once-through-steam generators (OTSG)."


This is incorrect. The July 8, 2015, Kern County Draft Environmental Impact Report
(DEIR) that Mr. Basenese cites in his article actually states that:


"All new and replacement steam generators for thermal EOR activities would be
required to implement low-emission steam generation technology, such as the
ClearSign Duplex Tile combustion technology or the equivalent." [emphasis added]

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3539466-windfall-whiff-clearsigns-kern-county-prospects-may-less-golden 2/15


Thus the DEIR references CLIR products only as an example of what might eventually be
mandated. This sentence is the one and only mention of "ClearSign" in the 1,876 page
report (see above links).


The Kern County DEIR leaves the door open for the implementation of technologies other
than those produced by CLIR. There are many alternative emission reduction
technologies for OSTG other than those developed by CLIR. Other producers of such
technologies include Coen QLN-II and North American Magna-Flame LE.


Prior to its September 2015 agreement with Aera Energy LLC, CLIR had never
successfully sold its Duplex™ Technology. Would Kern County, home to 50,000 oil- and
gas-related jobs, pass regulations mandating that the energy companies within its
boundaries use a product with such a limited track record?


Mr. Basenese assumes that CLIR will achieve an average selling price of $200,000 per
Duplex system. On the Q1 2015 earnings call, CLIR Chief Executive Officer Stephen
Pirnat said that the revenue opportunity per OTSG could be "as small as $50,000 and
could be as high as $350,000. So, to taking that and extrapolating it for some meaningful
revenue stream would be pretty difficult." If the CEO of CLIR isn't confident projecting
revenue per unit, then how can Mr. Basenese purport to do just that?


Mr. Basenese says that the revenue potential for CLIR in Kern County is "more than $150
million in sales". He would seem to derive this by multiplying an average selling price of
$200,000 by an installed base of 782 OTSGs. However, according to the DEIR, the
relevant alternative plan (which, again, references CLIR only as an example) would apply
only to new OTSGs and those installed before 1990. To be clear, OTSGs installed after
1990 will not require replacement. This fact plainly contravenes Mr. Basenese's statement
that the DEIR will require replacement "on every existing OTSG…within five years".


Our September 16, 2015, conversation with CLIR's Chief Financial Officer James Harmon
reflected a decidedly less optimistic tone. To paraphrase, Mr. Harmon stated that he was
not as optimistic as Mr. Basenese in his belief that the new environmental ruling would
cover the entire installed base in Kern County. Mr. Harmon reflected that the
environmental rules were written in an unclear way, so it would be challenging to predict
the outcome.


Mr. Basnese's enthusiasm for its regulators aside, it should be noted that Kern County's
production of oil has been in decline since 2000. This is hardly a booming market.

Let us suspend reality and pretend for a moment that the rosy revenue assumptions and
incorrect regulatory forecast of Mr. Basenese were possible. Such would imply a revenue
opportunity of $150 million for CLIR, supposing (contrary to the published plan) that the
county were to require installation of CLIR products on all of its OTSGs over the next five
years. Let us assume this revenue is distributed evenly at $30 million per year for the next
five. Even on this basis, CLIR would be far overvalued relative to peers, which currently
trade at about half of sales:


CLIR comparable valuation as of Sep 21, 2015


[Source: Bloomberg LLP, CECE & BW "2016E Revenue" reflect consensus estimates as
of 09/21/2015]


Looking at CLIR beyond the hype of the Kern County proposal does not increase one's
confidence in the company. Despite its $71-million market cap, CLIR has generated a
paltry total of $93,000 of revenue in its 14 quarters as a public company. These were "co-
development revenues" of $50,000 and $43,000 in Q3 and Q4 of 2013, respectively. They
were generated as the result of a working group formed with Covanta to "accelerate
commercialization of the company's Electrodynamic Combustion Control™ ("ECC™")
technology". To date, every other promised commercialization of CLIR has remained just
that, a promise. (Revenue data from Bloomberg. Covanta press release viewable here)

CLIR may one day successfully commercialize its nascent technology. But the reality
beyond the hype of Mr. Basenese's article suggests that such a day will not take place
anytime soon.

Even though I disagree, I’m glad to have someone from the short side (now @ 2.07 million shares) publicly, not
anonymously, sharing their thesis. Having both sides engaged only helps new investors with diligence.


Several clarifications/points:


1. BACT (best avail control tech) designation in Kern County is not central to investment. I think it’s inevitable for
Duplex in severe non-attainment areas. But I own CLIR because of large revenue potential with previously announced
customers (Aera Energy and Tesoro) and others in pipeline, not because of the potential for regulatory mandate.


2. Process is not “only part way;” it’s almost complete. Here are the dates: began officially on January 22, 2013 with
public hearing. Final public hearing is Oct. 5 (with Oct. 8 as backup). Board meets November 15, with deliberations on
December 8 and 15 (if necessary), at which point decision will be made. After decision, any ordinance changes go
into effect after 30-day waiting period.


3. Interpretation of report language based on conversations with regulators. Whether the tech will be required for all or
a portion of OTSGs in Kern County is ultimately up to the Board of Supervisors. They can modify or draft new
language as they see fit. My statements were made after speaking to a representative from Kern County. I’m going to

reach out for clarification to confirm previous comments. Again, being mandated in next 6 months or so is not central
to my owning CLIR.


4. There is no equivalent tech. Coen and North American’s burners require costly flue gas recirculation (FGR) to
achieve sub 5ppm NOx, which adds $150k-$200k to burner cost. You can confirm FGR requirement by checking
recent permit approvals like these: http://tinyurl.com/pmf... and http://tinyurl.com/qf6.... CLIR’s Duplex does not require
FGR and it increases efficiency by as much as 4%, which COEN and NA do not.


5. Pricing based on size of OTSG. Pirnat gave range, which would encompass smallest (~5 million Btu/hr) to largest
(85 million Btu/hr) OTSGs in Kern County. Data shows OTSG market heavily skewed to the high end (>75% of
OTSGs are >60 million BTU/hr), hence $200k ASP assumption.


One last thing to consider - CLIR has been so heavily shorted, possibly without borrow, it’s now on Reg SHO list

Do your own due diligence and decide. Good luck to all.

First of all, thank you for a fine presentation, however I have built these type of chambers or enclosures or burner-
boxes (316 Stainless Steel) all my life and feel comfortable rebutting several points. There has been little income,
therefore it won't show up on any P&L statements until later, as frequently happens bringing a new item to market.
Then there is the labor of actually developing the item. Let us say it is 50% gross profit, leaving 50% for labor and
materials. Subtract $20,000 for materials would leave us about $80,000 of labor to build and install one unit, perform
the plumbing, electrical, rigging to place, sheet metal fabrication to fit into a site, crane rentals, and so on, not to
lengthen this response anymore. The fabrication part is about 320 man hours in the shop but here is where the rest of
the labor is used up. $55,000 is the regular hours and double time hours to install as respect must be shown for
minimum downtime to the customer. Then there are the ancillary costs for permits, electrical panel modifications and
installation and similar items. Point is there is no place yet for economies of scale, as that will occur on the 10th or
50th installation, as the people involved become familiar with the projects and what is expected of them. This will take
a year or two to show up on a P & L and that is why I am long on this stock, as this type development will require two
or three shifts a day to meet deliveries in all similar refineries for this product. Each one will be different, in some way,
from all the others, but not for long. Eventually, the fabrication process will go much faster, the installation will be
about the same but the customers will be waiting years to get a reduction in fines they now pay for emissions to
atmosphere unless they expand territories, as it now appears. I have no inside information on all the numbers above,
but only use them for illustration purposes. Thank you for your opinion, dmac

Again dmac to the rescue when it comes to a reality check based on market experience. Weigh the facts
readers. The short thesis is extremely shallow. Look at the recent news and all of the potential catalysts. I
predict a share price north of $10 no later than Q1 2016.

Shorts are masters at manipulating language from prior articles and news releases just enough to cloud their
accuracy. They always throw in the lack of revenue from 2013 and 2014 as evidence that the company hasn't had
sales in the past and therefore won't have sales in the future. They are well aware that Clearsign is just recently
transitioning from development to manufacturing and sales. And as Kitesurfer has pointed out, the timing of this
article, about an hour or so after the Delek announcement, is pretty ironic. I think this author's interpretation of what's
happening in Kern Co. is completely off the mark and fortunately we will soon find who is right.


30 Sep 2015, 10:28 AM


ER Capital
Glad the shorts are publishing under their real names.


I am in this stock because I believe the Duplex technology is truly "disruptive." Comparing Flue Gas Recirculation
(FGR) to the Duplex is like comparing a VW Diesel to a Tesla because they are both cars.


FGR by COEN and NA are selling an old technology which is a commodity. Duplex is the only technology that
reduces NOx to less than 5 PPM...and probably less than 3PPM, AND reduces fuel costs.....when you are talking
about saving 3-4% energy costs over FGR on an OTSG, they payback is less than two years...environmental benefits
aside.


And the OTSG market is tiny compared to the refineries. No reason why Duplex should not replace every OTSG and
refinery burner. Also low oil prices are good for refineries so more fund for cap ex spending.


$70M valuation with no debt and two years of cash makes this a value stock.


Of course the golden goose is the ECC. That is still in the lab, but if it works, the numbers are so big they are silly to
talk about.

I have never had a position in BABA (although I think it might well be a buy in a month or two), ONVO or
BBLU and sold DDD well over a year ago for a small loss. I made money on KORS which I sold over a year
ago and I do think it is a current buy, but not a screaming buy like CLIR. I did lose some money on small
SZYM position.


More to the point, my very large (for me at least) CLIR position just went up 17% today; it must be a
coincidence--even a blind pig etc...

What the shorts don't understand it's not just about NOx. The duplex solved some serious problems in the refinery
space that no one else has been able to solve. Why do you think it's getting such an enthusiastic reception? What an
attractive acquisition target for a combustion company trying to gain an advantage!

CLIR could easily garner more than $10 per share right now for a buyout, but I very much doubt that they are
interested in any offer at this point. Certainly, no offer below something like $25 per share.

d2mccarthy
Grossing $100,000 per installation, let's say, of this system simply means to the average executive 'we're going to
need more distributors'. That process will be a deliberate one and may take years. It is all a function of available man
hours to fab and install and we estimated approximately 1200 hours per job which is 30 man weeks each project + or
-. So if you have 100 or 10,000 projects to do.....do the math. This will not be accomplished in any quarter, year or
even decade. And then there is ECC. That is what they meant when they said it boggles the mind. So I don't see
them selling anytime soon. Not when you cannot see the end of a rainbow. dmac

Stevenkind; If the average price was $200,000/unit and the selected gross was 50% it follows that the rest was labor
and materials, I stated on 9/30, above, I was using typical figures for fabricating and installing S.Stl. enclosures that
came from 42 years of doing that work. 80% labor at $66.66/hr yielded 1200 man hours or 30 men a week. The
numbers all change based upon a higher or lower sales price per unit. Further, the more units you build, the cheaper
to build, but not until a production line is established, however the installation labor is a constant. dmac Ihave no
inside information on all the numbers above, but only use them for illustration purposes.

Great dialogue guys and keep it up. You both have experience in the combustion industry and add a lot to discussions
on CLIR. Steve has spent time at CLIR headquarters and is a retired combustion engineer. You both know a lot about
the ins and outs of how this works--and it does work!


02 Oct 2015, 11:51 AM


stevenkind
I can tell you the selected gross was way North of 50%. Materials are very inexpensive. CLIR is partnering with a local
field services contractor that performs all the basic install work (refractory, steel supports, burner mods, etc.) CLIR
engineers then commission the unit and assure proper operation. Contractor is giving CLIR a break for future rights
and materials are fairly inexpensive. We are looking at major margins here. Standard oil field construction cost
models are not applicable here.


Retrofit fit of just the operating AREA units around Bakersfield represents Millions. I am not privy to the exact pricing
model, but I would guess that CLIR is simply licensing the Duplex Tech to their contractor partner and AREA on a per
unit basis, passing operational risk down stream and creating some sort of monthly cash flow to both CLIR and their
partner(s) based on improved energy consumption and the reduction in monthly Air Quality fines, which I understand
run somewhere near 2 million per year for AREA alone. I would guess that the ongoing operational testing is looking
at long term reliability and stability. CLIR has never been about product manufacturing, Their about the development
of tech, that can be licensed to ultimately generate monthly positive cash flow.


With something over 700-800 units operating in Kern County, their is a good potential for steady income. Now, take a
look at the use of OTSG's in places like the Canadian Tar Sands in Edmonton, Heavy oil in Eagle Ford and market
potential for just this application looks pretty good.


Ultimately, Duplex will be named BACT (Best Available Control Technology), leading to a captured market. It will then
be what ever the market will tolerate.


02 Oct 2015, 02:15 PM


GreenGrowthGeek, Contributor
Yes Steve, and we aren't even touching upon revenue from boilers in your comment. Success is breeding
success right now and the tech will likely become ubiquitous in oil fields worldwide at some point. An
educated guess would be soon after the engineering firm Tesoro has hired to validate the technology signs off
on it. The CEO gave a conservative timeline of 18 months or sooner at the last quarterly call. My guess is that

even stricter CA regulations, plus the sooner they implement, the quicker they start saving money.

feasible."


A Kern County meeting "to receive comments" will be held today at 5:00 PM. However a "Staff Report" was already
published last Thursday. (At least, that's when I found it.) Clearsign has already been rejected due to technological
and commercial infeasibility.

Always Incredulous, Contributor
everyone knew you were immediately going to comment, and totally misconstrue what was said.


I encourage everyone to read the actual language, not Mr. Berry's very very very incomplete and incorrect
interpretation.

Read it carefully: http://bit.ly/1OT2iMo.


Those terms are official language. Alternative only ruled out because 1) not enough operators using Duplex in field
yet and 2) because it achieves LOWER emissions than required by BACT. It has nothing to do with the tech not
working. It's being deployed regardless of Kern county proposal, which is why I own. Favorable outcome here would
have only accelerated deployment.


Do your own due diligence. Good luck to all.

Not just official language. "... lower-emission steam generation technology, such as, by way of example, the ClearSign
Duplex Tile combustion technology or similar technologies …. However, Alternative 5 is not technologically or
economically feasible. Low-emission steam generation technologies are still in the demonstration and prototype
phase.” …

you should teach a master class in effective use of logical fallacies.


for everyone else, here is a handy list of them: http://bit.ly/1cfWJHz


fun drinking game: go to MR. Berry's pieces and then drink every time you find a logical fallacy. bonus shot for
each statement that you find that has subsequently been refuted by actual commercialization or third-party
verification.


*warning: you will get seriously drunk, really damn fast.


05 Oct 2015, 01:34 PM


Always Incredulous, Contributor
missed this part, huh Matt? you are usually so on top of this, you must have just missed this accidentally.


“By comparison, the low-emission steam generation technology contemplated by Alternative would be
expected to achieve rates comparable to or lower than 5 ppm NOx at 3% O2 for steam generators operating
at 55 MMBtu/hr.”


 
except, remember those articles you kept penning saying this technology was a fraud, didn't work, etc etc?
Weird how you seem to have not penned a mea culpa there, huh Matt?

My research on ECC technology is decisive: http://seekingalpha.co...


Aera Energy states that as of September 10, 2015 CLIR's Duplex tech has not been officially tested. Why? ...
one of the reasons why Duplex was rejected.


05 Oct 2015, 03:18 PM


GrowthGeek
Are you serious Mr. Berry that this old worn out moot article is decisive research? Duplex is being accepted
by the industry; it has certainly NOT been rejected. Your statements are extremely misleading.


05 Oct 2015, 05:27 PM


Always Incredulous, Contributor
they aren't misleading. they are decisively incorrect. Berry is likely a paid shill of the shorts. the tactics are the
exact same as is used by special interest groups and politicians the world over.

use every logical fallacy in the books, and then hope the readers are too lazy to actually verify anything.


btw, matt, your articles are hilarious. please keep em coming.

Maybe Berry should call and enlighten them to their folly.

Matt Berry, Contributor
You wrote about my research: "they aren't misleading. they are decisively incorrect" & "use every logical
fallacy in the books"


You were taken up on that statement and challenged to provide examples. You provide none, because there
are none. Here is my research. Show me an example of an error. Here is my research.

I would not call that article research, far from it. Your article is basically an irrelevant smear campaign and
unworthy of reading or a reply.

It is official language tied to BACT designations. I say this after talking with multiple regulators in CA. BACT
designations come about in one of two ways...


1) Achieved in practice in the field. SJV staff told me they want to see it working in the field for 1-year min.


2) If not #1, regulators need 3rd party data that tech is "technologically feasible" and "economically feasible"


Regarding #2, KCP is a little behind on their work, as 2 OTSG operators are deploying in the field, not one.

At the end of the day, everyone should do their own due diligence, make a decision short or long. And then, the
market will decide an ultimate winner. Good luck to all!

Great link Lou. Mr. Berry picks and chooses parts of comments out of context. For those familiar with biblical
hermeneutics, this is what is called "proof texting" using selected scripture portions totally out of context to
prove one's point.


Kern County is basically saying that they need more data regarding Duplex Technology; they are certainly
NOT saying that this technology does not work.


05 Oct 2015, 02:42 PM

Your allegations are irrelevant. People might take you seriously if you provided credible problems with current
leadership or their award winning technology.

Since 4/1/2015 the short interest has risen by 987,129 shares! I estimate the average weighted price was around
$5.48. At the current price that translates into a loss of $921,822. Based on recent regulation SHO listings and the
"cost to borrow" it also seems that the shorts have exhausted the pool of shares available to borrow. The shorts were
the ones providing many of the shares to new buyers during August and September. Now that they seem to have run
out of ammo I wonder where the next wave of buyers are going to acquire shares?


Also, the technical indicators, stochastic, MACD and RSI, all appear to be indicating a signal to buy. In summary, we
really don't need any short covering to see the next leg up. The next announcement could really have a powerful
impact.


Although I am a little curious to see which one of these short sellers is bright enough to be the first to turn on the
others.

So here we are about 18 months later. Any idea if Kern Co. has adressed this or is everything still in limbo?


18 Mar 2017, 05:28 PM


GrowthGeek
It has been a disappointing 18 months regarding the share price and how incredibly slow this industry moves.
It has been an excellent 18 months in terms of confirming how well Duplex performs in multiple verticals. The
company has also done very well at positioning themselves with deals in numerous places--California,
Western Canada, Texas, Oklahoma and now expanding to Europe and Asia. We aren't there yet, but the
share price is truly a Bargain at this point given how all the stars are aligned in favor of great things in the
near, mid and long term.

Yes, but has Kern Co addressed any other technology, is this still a viable opportunity, and if the answers are
no and no, what is going on there? I apparently mistakenly thought that this was something they had to
address.


29 Mar 2017, 05:54 PM


GrowthGeek
CLIR management is meeting with Southern California Air Quality Board leaders and hopes to have Duplex
confirmed by them as BACT and BART this Summer (2017). Things do move painfully slow in this space, but
they do move.
