Will MiMedx And Its CEO Both Go Down In Flames?
Mar. 21, 2014 2:27 PM ET15 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


With the SEC seeking to nail its top executive for insider trading, MiMedx stands to
lose the accomplished industry veteran widely credited for its amazing success.


By keeping its mouth shut and its fingers crossed, MiMedx has practically assumed
that its CEO can somehow escape from even the damaging publicity of a high-profile
trial completely unscathed.


Despite its treatment by MiMedx as an underdog, the SEC has defeated Petit's
efforts to derail the case and feels confident enough to risk the outcome on an
unpredictable trial.


MiMedx (Nasdaq: MDXG) better hope that its top executive can work the same kind of
magic on the federal judge who will soon decide his fate as he has on the shareholders
who have placed so much faith in his word.


With its turnaround CEO Parker "Pete" Petit set to face trial on insider-trading charges as
early as next month - and its shareholders largely oblivious to both the proximity of that
courtroom battle and the gravity of its final outcome - MiMedx desperately needs that
looming verdict to favor its accomplished leader and spare its highflying stock from the
trauma of his stunning exile. After all, as graphically illustrated by the 70% loss that it
suffered back in September, MiMedx paid a staggering price the last time that the market
felt blindsided by a major regulatory scare. Now that MiMedx has fully recovered from that
nasty wound to reach even loftier highs - achieving a generous $740 million market value
that literally eclipses the $500 million value recently assigned to the entire "skin substitute"
market that the bleeding firm serves - the company sure would hate to plunge yet again on
an overlooked danger capable of erupting into bombshell headlines.


To be sure, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seems bent on a victory that
would make those jarring headlines come true. Convinced that Petit tipped off a friend
about the imminent buyout of the last public company that he ran, the SEC filed charges
against the veteran corporate executive back in early 2012 and - after soundly defeating
his motion to dismiss the charges that he actually bothered to challenge - looks fully
prepared to move forward with a high-stakes trial that could literally end his entire career.

In a vivid display of its determination, the SEC has invested years in a case against Petit
based upon suspicions raised by a pair of trades that date all the way back to 2007 and
involve a relatively modest windfall that never personally benefited the seasoned
executive at all. Still, the SEC highly doubts that his longtime friend simply lucked out by
gambling half of his net worth on Matria Healthcare (the company that Petit led at the
time) ahead of a generous buyout offer to score an easy $94,000 jackpot as a total novice
playing the market for the very first time. Seeking to nail the veteran officer for that
suspected leak and prevent him from committing any future offenses, the SEC has
proposed a severe punishment that - by stripping Petit of the right to serve as an officer or
director of any publicly traded company - threatens to drive the popular MiMedx leader
right out of the executive suite.


MiMedx did not respond to requests from TheStreetSweeper seeking input from the
company ahead of this story.


Miracle Cure


Try to imagine MiMedx without the celebrated industry veteran who has presided over the
powerful rally that fueled its escape last spring from the lowly OTC Bulletin and magically
transformed the stock into a Nasdaq darling. A bleeding firm that obviously still needs to
prove itself, MiMedx has nevertheless blossomed from a neglected $1 penny stock into an
explosive $7 highflier - generously valued at the sort of nosebleed multiples often reserved
for lucrative buyout offers - by relying heavily on its accomplished leader to lend the
company its outsized respect.


Go ahead and ask the proud CEO himself. Hardly shy about taking credit for his
contributions to the company, Petit has repeatedly pointed to the expertise of senior
executives - his own in particular - as the driving force behind that amazing success.


"The one key issue that's been very key to our growth is our management," Petit bragged
at a major investment conference earlier this year, reinforcing the message that he likes to
deliver on a regular basis. "You cannot grow a company at 100 percent a year-plus
without having key management to bring to the team at the right point in time …


"As you can imagine, this management team is looking forward to 2014," he later
concluded at the end of that bullish presentation. "We expect, this time next year, to be the
unquestioned leader in the advanced wound care sector."

Right now, however, MiMedx cannot even promise that the confident executive who made
that bold call will remain "the unquestioned leader" of the company itself. While MiMedx
has practically assumed that Petit will clear his name from the very start, casually
downplaying the stubborn charges against him as little more than a pesky nuisance on the
rare occasions when the company has bothered to mention them at all, the SEC itself has
clearly taken the opposite stand. Hardly intimidated in spite of its treatment by MiMedx as
an underdog facing long odds, the SEC obviously felt driven enough to chase after the
prominent executive for years - successfully overcoming his efforts to derail the case
along the way - and has since emerged confident enough to take its chances on an
unpredictable trial.


Indeed, if not for scheduling conflicts that prompted the SEC to request a later date, Petit
and his alleged co-conspirator Earl Arrowood would face a four-day trial starting early next
week. With the SEC free in April and already booked up throughout most of May, that
delay could prove brief enough to simply postpone the trial until sometime next month.


Painful Sting


The SEC has dropped no obvious hints about a possible settlement since it originally filed
its complaint more than two years ago, either. The last sign of negotiations dates back to
September of 2010, well ahead of the actual charges, when the SEC almost struck a deal
with Arrowood - who directly implicated his friend by agreeing to confess that Petit had
"tipped" him off ahead of the second trade that struck regulators as suspicious - before
changing his mind and deciding to fight the charges instead.


Although Petit sought to dismiss that withdrawn "proffer" as mere hearsay, the judge
refused to grant his wishes and simply blocked the SEC from using that damaging
evidence against Arrowood himself instead. Moreover, back when Petit originally filed his
motion for a summary judgment, the executive simply challenged the allegations related to
the first trade that caught the attention of securities regulators and never even bothered to
contest the charges prompted by the second transaction that (as illustrated below)
arguably looks like the far more suspicious of the two. Rejecting his arguments about even
the more distant trade - executed months ahead of the actual buyout deal - the judge ruled
against Petit, anyway.


"Given that a merger is such a significant event in the life of a company, the Court finds
that inside information regarding exploration of the possibility of a merger - even if not
concrete information about when and with whom such a merger would occur - could be
material even at such an early stage in merger discussions," the federal judge wrote last

summer, when denying Petit's motion for a partial summary judgment that would have at
least narrowed the scope of the case. "The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact
exist as to whether a reasonable investor would find the information Mr. Petit allegedly
disclosed to Mr. Arrowood to be material, and these factual issues must be submitted to a
jury."


Contagious Fever


No wonder all of the charges managed to stick. Take a look at some of the more
noteworthy discoveries reported by the SEC in the chronology presented below:


August 2004: Petit agrees to help Arrowood out with his personal investments by
managing an IRA account for the Delta pilot after he retires. Friends for more than a
decade by then, Petit and Arrowood have flown together on a regular basis for years and
even vacationed together with their respective wives. Granted the authority to exercise full
control over the IRA, consisting of $212,024 in cash, Petit will go on to conduct all of the
trades in that account - making investment decisions without consulting Arrowood in
advance - for almost three full years, providing his services at no charge to his close
friend.


November 2004 and December 2005: Petit actually uses funds from the IRA account to
buy stock in his own company Matria on two separate occasions, purchasing a total of
5,700 shares, as an investment for Arrowood that will ultimately backfire. The highflying
stock will peak just a couple of months after that second purchase, with the shares
reversing course and losing a big chunk of their value soon after that.


Late 2006: As both the chairman and the CEO of Matria, Petit begins receiving a string of
calls from a number of potential suitors expressing interest in a possible buyout of the
company.


May 2007: With Petit fielding calls about a potential buyout of his company, he proceeds
to unload all of the Matria stock that he previously acquired for his friend - liquidating the
entire position at a loss - and suddenly stops trading in the IRA account altogether.


Sept. 27, 2007: A few months after Petit dumps all of the stock from his friend's account at
a loss, Matria officially hires an investment banker to explore a potential sale of the
company. By the end of the following month, Matria will attract interest from five different
companies - including its ultimate suitor - serious enough to conduct due diligence for a
potential buyout offer.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2102513-will-mimedx-and-its-ceo-both-go-down-in-flames 5/12


Oct. 25, 2007: With Matria set to host a quarterly update half an hour before the market
opens, Petit fields a burst of early-morning calls from Arrowood during a 20-minute span
that ends almost two full hours ahead of the opening bell. Arrowood first contacts the
home of the CEO, receiving a call from the home of Petit's son seven minutes later, and
then follows up with two calls to the home of the executive's daughter 11 minutes after
that. Less than 10 minutes after Matria hosts its quarterly conference call, lowering its
guidance (and likely the price of its stock right along with it), Arrowood suddenly executes
his very first stock trade in the IRA account that Petit alone had previously managed for
years. Despite the loss that he suffered a few months earlier, when Petit unloaded all of
the Matria stock from his account, Arrowood decides to take his own chances on a
massive investment in that very same company. By splurging on 8,452 shares of Matria,
with the stock trading at $25 a share, Arrowood literally depletes the entire $213,000 cash
balance sitting in his IRA account. Following that big-ticket purchase, Matria represents
almost 90% of the holdings in his entire portfolio.


Dec. 5, 2007: Matria delivers official letters to all five of its potential suitors, requesting that
each one submit a written buyout proposal within the next two weeks.


Dec. 19, 2007: Of the five potential suitors that previously expressed interest in a buyout
deal, three submit preliminary non-binding offers at prices ranging from $26.50 to $31 a
share.


Dec. 20, 2007. The day after Matria lands preliminary buyout offers from three different
bidders interested in a potential deal, Petit and Arrowood begin exchanging the first of 15
different phone calls that they will make to one another in the span of one short week.


Dec. 27, 2007: Following a flurry of calls that began a week earlier, Arrowood starts his
morning with yet another call to Petit and races into action just minutes after he hangs up
the phone. Suddenly eager to raise a fresh mountain of cash, Arrowood proceeds to
liquidate the longtime investment that originally ranked as the sole holding in his IRA
account before he retired. He sells all 14,260 share of Delta stock left over from his career
as a pilot at the airline, voluntarily swallowing a bitter $70,000 loss in exchange for the
$282,000 that he clears to replenish his IRA account. After speaking to Petit twice again,
Arrowood promptly blows most of that cash within a matter of hours by spending more
than $200,000 on another 9,100 shares of Matria - at prices that have drifted below $23 a
share by this time - early that same afternoon. Arrowood calls Petit one last time a couple
of hours later before he ends his busy day.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2102513-will-mimedx-and-its-ceo-both-go-down-in-flames 6/12


Jan. 15, 2008: Less than three weeks after Arrowood doubles down on the stock, Matria
publicly announces that the company has reached the advanced stages of negotiations for
a possible buyout deal. The stock instantly soars from its previous close of $24.45 a share
to $29.34 a share - recording an immediate 20% gain - on mere news of a likely buyout
alone. After purchasing his initial stock in Matria at $25, then boosting his position at
prices below $23 a share the previous month, Arrowood manages to record a handsome
$94,000 gain on his well-timed trades before the company even announces a concrete
deal. Matria will actually go on to fetch a far more generous price of $39 a share a couple
of weeks later, with one of its five original suitors - already conducting due diligence on the
company back when Arrowood purchased his first block of stock - emerging as the
ultimate buyer in the end.


Festering Wound


The SEC found that chain of events fishy enough to suggest likely insider trading. Four
years later, with Matria long since swallowed and MiMedx now relying on Petit as its
turnaround CEO, the SEC officially filed charges against both the veteran corporate
executive and the retired pilot suspected of striking it rich on a generous favor from his
longtime friend.


Dutifully rushing to Petit's defense, MiMedx automatically responded to the SEC complaint
with a public display of support for its embattled chief. After that, however, MiMedx spent
the next two years largely ignoring the dangerous charges that now threaten to end his
celebrated reign.


MiMedx never bothered to disclose the pending SEC complaint in any of its official
regulatory filings until last summer, for example, when the company suddenly added a
new warning to the quarterly report that it issued the day after the judge refused to dismiss
the charges against its CEO and cleared the way for a rare courtroom trial instead. With
the prospect of a high-profile trial attracting some unwelcome media attention, practically
forcing the company to acknowledge the SEC complaint that it had failed to mention in its
seven previous financial reports, MiMiMedx finally acknowledged the pending charges by
slipping a brief disclosure into its second-quarter report for last year underneath a section
entitled "We depend on key personnel."


When MiMedx filed its next quarterly report a few months after that, however, the
company reverted back to form by inexplicably removing that disclosure even as the case
moved closer toward a risky trial. Indeed, before MiMedx even got a chance to issue its
next financial report, the court officially scheduled Petit for a four-day trial set to begin

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2102513-will-mimedx-and-its-ceo-both-go-down-in-flames 7/12


before the end of this month. Spared from an immediate trial by scheduling conflicts that
postponed the original court date, but likely by no more than a month or two, MiMedx
retrieved the disclosure that it had previously discarded and - looking forced once again -
acknowledged the pending charges against its CEO in its recent 10-K filing, with the threat
now posed by an imminent trial proving virtually impossible to ignore.


Second Opinion


Otherwise keeping its mouth shut and hoping for the best, MiMedx continues to bank on
Petit to shake the stubborn charges that still linger more than two years after the company
first dismissed them as a legitimate danger. Despite the unwavering faith that the
company has maintained in its CEO throughout his courtroom setbacks, however, his
second-in-command (and most obvious heir to the throne) seemed almost rattled when
suddenly faced with heightened odds of trying to fill those giant shoes.


Starting the day before the judge officially released his decision to uphold the charges
against Petit and continuing on the actual date of that ruling, MiMedx President William
"Bill" Taylor proceeded to cash out a mountain of cheap stock options a full seven years
ahead of their distant expiration date. After scoring a cool $1 million on those rare insider
sales, Taylor still managed to clear more than $850,000 even after covering the cost of
exercising another 200,000 cheap options to quietly replace all of the pricey shares that
he had just sold.


Granted, after working alongside the popular MiMedx leader for so many years, Taylor
understands firsthand just how much Petit means to the bleeding company and its senior
management team. Of course, Petit makes that pretty clear to the general public, too.
After all, he seems to remind the world every chance that he gets.


Just look. As always, his words speak for themselves.


"Fiscal year 2013 was an exceptional year for MiMedx," Petit boasted during the
company's latest quarterly conference call. "We faced a number of hurdles that may have
crippled an organization with a less seasoned executive team. We came out of the year
with a substantial degree or organizational maturity from the 2013 challenges and are a
far stronger and better-prepared organization to lead (our) various opportunities …


"On the reimbursement front, fortunately or unfortunately, because of my tenure in the
industry - 47 years - I have been involved with health plans for the majority of that period
of time. I know a lot of people. I'm experienced more than anybody can even imagine … I

Her bio definitely appears to be exaggerated regarding her “seven years as one of the top investigative reporters at
TheStreet.com”


http://bit.ly/1d8c244


Apparently, she was just writing articles at home.


How about folks at Motley Fool? Below is a blog post regarding Ms. Davis and her profiting from sensationalism, poor
journalism, and fraud.


http://bit.ly/1d8c0Jw


There is an obvious pattern when researching “The Street Sweeper.”


In my opinion, Melissa Davis clearly is into tabloid journalism. She wraps her arms around Jim Cramer and then
shorts a stock when he trashes it on his show.


Consider this from http://bit.ly/1d8c2kr. “I find it interesting that Jim Cramer has his arm around Melissa in a photo on
the TheStreetSweeper.org site and he slammed SWSH shortly after her article. How many shares did he short?”


Cary Spivak wrote, “Short on Ethics? Two Web sites that investigate business fraud are funded by short selling—
placing market bets that the stock of companies they write about will go down. It’s an approach that makes journalism
ethicist very uncomfortable.”


Apparently, Melissa is in plenty of bad company. There are several web sites masking themselves as investigative
journalism whereby struggling journalist have discovered that by shorting a stock prior to their story, they can get rich
quick. Barry Minkow has made his living doing this after his stint in prison. I read his book several years ago, called
“Cleaning Up”.


Melissa's web site partner is Hunter Adams. “Hunter Adams, the brains behind The Street Sweeper
(thestreetsweeper.org), helped launch the site last year, just eight years after federal prosecutors labeled him an
associate of the Gambino crime family in New York. Adams, who was convicted for his role in a massive "pump and
dump" scheme involving penny stocks, is still on federal probation for his crime. “


I find it rather hypocritical that Melissa cites BRLI as having ties to the Gambino family when she herself is working
with Mr. Hunter who did prison time for his association with the Gambino's.


After reviewing several of Melissa's articles, they all follow the same pattern. Short a company, then use the internet,
youtube, media, etc to profit by shorting it.


I think BRLI is oversold. I'm not interested in anything Melissa Davis and her cronies at The Street Sweeper are
saying by profiting from tabloid journalism.


I'm going to watch "The Tools." Phil mentioned using an Option Strategy called a Strangle that could be effective.
Even something as simple as a basic CALL option may be helpful if indeed BRLI is at the bottom.


I'm more inclined to listen to our BRLI Sales Rep's opinion of MANAGEMENT, my wife's belief in BRLI's MOAT and
the MEANING it has to her, and my understanding of its MOS.

I see that the SEC has just dismissed the case on Petit. May I suggest two things? You owe a deep apology to the
company and should immediately apologize for this muck raking article. You should also consider changing your
name to Sewer Sweeper.


I would also like to know how you get paid for writing an article like this? Do you have a model based on advertising?
With your limited content the answer is almost certainly no. Is it the case that hedge funds who are short the stock are
paying you and providing some of your content? Thank you in advance for your response.

I always viewed the SEC case as completely baseless after reviewing the information Pete Petit put up on his
personal site.


More importantly, I thought that even if Mr. Petit was found guilty and banned from remaining as a public company
executive, there would be almost no impact to the company. Pete has already completed all the heavy lifting with
setting up supply/distribution networks, drastically growing the sales organization and helping to influence massively
beneficial changes to reimbursement that make Epifix the clear winner in the skin substitute market. I thought the
worst case scenario was that he would remain on as a "Senior Adviser" role and continue to build value for the
company.


Thank you Street Sweeper for creating my original buying opportunity by perpetuating a flawed short thesis that
ultimately wouldn't have impacted the business much even if it proved to be true.

They don't get paid for writing the article other than pennies per click. They make their money by working with hedge
funds to short the stock and then publishing the article. Should not be a surprise give the apparent fact that the
founder of street sweeper has mob ties according to the US Government. Any more brilliant predictions sewer
sweeper?

Go back and read the original hit piece and notice the certainty of the writer's accusations and predictions regarding a
trial that never will occur.

Just curious OP,


When you are as wrong as wrong can be, do you come back and apologize?

Looks like smutsweeper lost again. First, Petit is cleared, next FDA allows AmnioFix to remain on the market? Any
more defamatory claims you want to make up shorty?
