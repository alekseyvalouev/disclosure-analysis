K12's Stock Is Up 122% From Its 52-Week 


Low and Is Near Its All-Time High

K12 Since Its IPO
Conflicting Thoughts on Shorting 


I have two strong feelings about shorting right now: 


1. It's a horrible business, it's cost me (and my investors) a fortune over the past 4½ years, I 


wish I'd never heard of it, and every bone in my body wants to cover every stock I'm short 


and never short another stock again; and 


2. In my 15-year career of professional investing, the only other times that have been as 


target-rich in terms of juicy, obvious shorts are late 1999/early 2000 and late 2007/early 


2008 (and we all know how those ended…). 


So which feeling am I going to follow? I don't know, but this I know for sure: the only 


other time I felt like covering every short and becoming a long-only manager was 


October 2007. At that time, I went through my short book, stock by stock, and said, 


"OK, am I willing to cover MBIA at $70? Hell no, not a single share! Allied Capital at 


$30? Hell no, not a single share! Farmer Mac at $30? Hell no, not a single share!" 


And on it went… I couldn't bring myself to cover a single share of any stock I was 


short – they were all "trembling-with-greed" shorts.  


And that's exactly how I feel today. I look at K12 and the other 10 stocks I'm short – 


all of which I think are absurdly overvalued and sure to collapse – and feel intensely 


that covering them now would be the most boneheaded capitulation trade of all time. 


That said, unlike in 2007, I don't have the same foreboding feeling that there's a 


good chance that the world will fall apart in the next year or two (though it's 


possible), which makes being short that much harder…

Overview of K12 


• Founded in 2000, K12 is a for-profit education company that offers 


"proprietary curriculum, software systems and educational services 


designed to facilitate individualized learning for students primarily in 


kindergarten through 12th grade" 


• It operates in three segments: 


• Managed Public Schools (86% of FY 2013 revenues), primarily managing 54 


online (aka, cyber or virtual) charter schools in 33 states and DC 


• This presentation focuses only on this segment 


• Note that my critique is specifically of K12, not all online charter schools, for-profit 


charter schools or blended learning schools. While I think the online charter school 


sector has, overall, run amok, there are a small number of good online schools – 


and a few students at even the worst online schools are doing well. 


• Institutional Sales (9% of revenue): work with districts and schools "to offer 


their students an array of online education solutions, including full- time virtual 


and blended programs, semester courses and supplemental solutions" 


• International and Private Pay Schools (5% of revenues): operate three online 


private schools and manage a foreign brick and mortar private school

The Bull Case for K12 


• Revenue growth of 32% 


annually for the past decade: 


• Projected revenue and EPS 


growth of 16% and 32%, 


respectively, over the next 12 


months, fueled by 10 new 


schools and enrollment cap

($M) 


• Average revenues per student has risen for the last four quarters 


• K12 estimates the market for online schools is as high as $15 billion annually (vs. 


nearly $2 billion today) 


• Online schools can be an excellent option for certain students 


• For example, children whose pace is extremely accelerated, entertainers, solo athletes, 


victims of bullying, children with cancer, seizure disorders, peanut allergies, etc. 


• K12 has a well-regarded curriculum and reports very high parental and student 


satisfaction 


• Strong political support, especially among Republicans, for giving parents school 


choice 


• Online learning has enormous buzz (MOOCS, etc.)
Like subprime lending and for-profit colleges, the business makes sense on a small scale but, 


fueled by lax regulation and easy government money, the sector, led by K12, has run amok 


-8- 


Summary of Why I'm Short K12's Stock 


• K12's aggressive student recruitment has led to dismal academic results by students 


and sky-high dropout rates, in some cases more than 50% annually 


• I wouldn't be short K12 if it were carefully targeting students who were likely to benefit from its 


schools – typically those who have a high degree of self-motivation and strong parental 


commitment  


 But K12 instead appears to be doing the opposite; numerous former employees say that K12 accepts 


pretty much any student and may even be targeting at-risk students, who are least likely to succeed in 


an online school 


• There have been so many regulatory issues and accusations of malfeasance that I'm 


convinced the problems are endemic 


• Enrollment violations, uncertified teachers, illegally siphoning profits from nonprofit entities 


• States (and the IRS) are waking up to what K12 is doing and the company is coming 


under increased scrutiny, which is beginning to impair K12's growth – and I believe 


this trend will accelerate 


• K12's founder, Knowledge Universe, distributed its entire stake to its investors earlier 


this month 


• Yet the stock, trading at nearly 50x trailing earnings, is priced as if K12 will continue to 


grow at high rates for the foreseeable future and also improve on its persistently low 


margins and free cash flow
I am Not Short K12's Stock Because I Oppose Charter 


Schools, Online Education, or For-Profit Schools 


My parents are educators and my primary philanthropic activities relate to charter 


schools and school reform: 


• My parents were both public school teachers in New Haven, CT in the mid-1960s when I was 


born 


• My father has a PhD in Education from Stanford and has spent most of his career doing teacher 


training and developing/managing educational projects in Third World Countries (as a child I 


lived for three years each in Tanzania and Nicaragua). He also earned an MBA degree from the 


University of Colorado at Colorado Springs in 2003 after studying entirely online for five years 


while living in Ethiopia. 


• Upon graduating from Harvard in 1989, I was one of the first people to join Wendy Kopp starting 


Teach for America 


• For more than a decade I have served on the board of the KIPP Academy charter school in the 


South Bronx, which is part of a national network of 141 college prep public charter schools in 


low-income communities 


• I was on the board of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools from 2010-12 


I am not opposed to all online schools – I think such schools can be a great option for 


some students and families, but an inappropriate and harmful option for others 


I am a champion of high-quality charter schools (including online and/or for-profit ones), 


but I think that low-quality charter schools give the movement a black eye 


To be clear: I am not bearish on K12 because I am short the stock. Rather, I am short 


the stock because I am bearish on K12

Since I Made This Presentation Public, Nearly All of the 


Feedback I've Received Confirms My Conclusions 


A friend of mine told me after reading this presentation: 


"I met with Ron Packard years ago and could tell his motivations had little to do with kids, everything to do with 


manipulating state regulation to protect his interests. I started digging into the results, the business model, the 


organization, and discovered much of what you lay out in detail in your presentation. As I said, they are terrible and 


epitomize everything that we should be working against in the ed reform movement." 
 


Another told me: 


"You're totally right about K12 and, on top of it, they lie all the time. It's naïve to trust anything they say. So I'm not 


sure if their schools can be fixed, at least under the company's current leadership. There's no such thing as a successful 


online school in the entire country. To be sure, it works well for some students, but I'd guess only 15% of the ones cyber 


charters are currently serving." 
 


Another emailed me: 


"I worked with/for K12 for a number of years. I thought you were absolutely dead-on in your presentation. Thanks 


very much for the article, insight and courage. I appreciate the way that you have focused the conversation on the 


damage that is done to kids and ed reform by K12. The people at K12 are not bad people but it's a recipe for disaster 


when missionary zeal and an ends-justify-means approach combine with aggressive lobbying, huge and sophisticated 


marketing, enormous stock market pressure, self-interest and a corporate ethos that sees any attack on K12 as an 


attack on school choice and on education reform itself, rather than on K12's particular aggressive growth tactics. It's 


tough to say the things that need to be said and I'm glad someone is doing it. The whole thing is like something out of 


Cialdini's book Influence on the psychology of human misjudgment." 
 


And another emailed me: 


"I know the company very well and your presentation rings true. They have a well-deserved terrible reputation." 
 


Yet another emailed me: 


"I think you are correct about K12 Whitney. I had an inside view of this company early on. They appeared giddy with 


the fact that they could receive almost the same per-pupil funding levels as brick and mortar schools and use the 


difference for big salaries and profit (on the public dime). If they are not providing a truly great education it means that, 


once again, students lose to adult interests."

K12 Aggressively Capitalizes Certain Costs – 


and Does Not Use a Big Four Accounting Firm 


• K12 capitalizes much of its software and curriculum development costs 
• As of FYE 6/30/13, "Capitalized software, net" was valued on K12's 


balance sheet at $43.5 million and "Capitalized curriculum development 


costs, net" was valued at $64.6 million 


• Capitalizing these costs rather than expensing them boosts reported 


margins and profits 
• EBITDA would have been 21% lower in FY 2013 had these costs been 


expensed 


• While permissible under GAAP accounting, it is uncommon 
• Salesforce.com (not known for conservative accounting, to say the least) 


does not capitalize any software development expenses 


• Learning Tree International (LTRE), audited by the same BDO office as 


K12, does not capitalize curriculum expenses 


• Perhaps there's a reason K12 chose BDO USA as its auditor, rather 


than a Big Four accounting firm? 


• K12's new CFO (as of June), James Rhyu, has an MBA, not a CFA 


• The chair of K12's audit committee, Steven Fink, is a lawyer by training, 


not a CFA

Former Employees and Other Sources Reveal 


What's Really Going On in K12's Schools
Comments By a Board Member of a K12 


School 


Interview with a board member of a nonprofit charter school that's contracted with K12: 


Everything you and the disgruntled employees say is right. The company is 


inherently broken. 


K12 simply doesn't know how to manage schools. The systems and business 


processes inside the company are broken or don't exist. The notion that they have 


any kind of national model that they're consistently replicating across all of their 


schools is simply false. And they've been so focused on growth that basic stuff 


isn't there or doesn't work. The culture of the company is just bad in many ways. 


You can rarely get them to execute on anything in a timely manner. It's like pulling 


teeth to get them to respond to anything promptly. 


K12's reputation is very poor. It's all about spin and manipulation. Nothing was 


ever their fault. 


I think they're bad actors. There needs to be an inquiry at the state and federal 


level into these education management companies. That's odd for me to say 


because I'm a socially conservative moderate Republican. But these guys are 


worse than what I've seen in the for-profit college space. 


I can tell you I wouldn't enroll my kids in Ohio or Agora or anywhere else 


because I've seen how the company operates. I've been in the belly of the beast. 


Knowing what I know now, I'd dump the stock.

Online Schools Are Only Appropriate For 


a Small Number of Students 


While online schools can be an excellent option for certain students, it's a very small number 


– typically those who have a high degree of self-motivation and strong parental commitment.  


It's sort of obvious if you think about it. Do you think you would have learned more during 


your K-12 educational experience if you'd sat at home in front of a computer vs. what you did: 


gone to school and had daily face-to-face interaction with teachers? How many of today's 


youth – in a world filled with 500 TV channels, texting, video games, etc. – do you think are 


better off at home rather than being at school?  


Lastly, what do you think the answer is for the most at-risk kids, who typically come from 


poor, single-parent households, in which the parent has little time or ability to be the "parent 


coach" that's so critical to online education? 


Tom Loveless, an education researcher at the Brookings Institution who did paid consulting 


for K12 in its early years, said: "The enthusiasts for cyber learning have overstated the 


potential. What they keep forgetting is we're not talking about college students here. We're 


talking about high schoolers and young kids. The idea that parents go to work and leave their 


kids in front of a computer—it's absurd." 


In summary, online schools are only educationally appropriate for a very small number of 


students, which means that K12 and its peers need to be highly selective in recruiting 


students, and warn parents away whose kids are unlikely to succeed at an online school, 


especially at-risk youth. 


So what does K12 do? Exactly the opposite.

Former Employees Tell Consistent Stories 


of a Growth-At-Any-Cost Mentality (1) 


Interview with Jeff Shaw, former Head of School of Ohio Virtual Academy 


When I began to recruit students for the inaugural year of the (OHVA) high school, I 


told parents we have a remarkable curriculum, but it's best suited for students who are 


hard-working, internally-motivated self-starters, and who have at least one parent in 


the home during the school day. An online school isn't right for everybody. A failure of 


a few classes in high school can be devastating. Students can fall behind their 


graduation cohort group and be at greater risk of dropping out of school altogether.  


Our administrative and enrollment team at OHVA was able to tell with a high degree 


of accuracy which students would do well academically with us. After the first year or 


so of the OHVA high school program, a decision was made by someone at a higher 


corporate level to market the high school program to all high school demographics 


ranging from at-risk to accelerated (Advanced Placement) students.  


After the IPO, I got discouraged because the company's priority seemed to shift 


from academics to growth – it wasn't so much about academic achievement but on 


delivering the promised enrollment numbers to shareholders. (emphasis added)  


(continued on next page)

Former Employees Tell Consistent Stories 


of a Growth-At-Any-Cost Mentality (2) 


Interview with Jeff Shaw (continued) 


Towards the end of my employment with K12 , corporate assumed control of the 


initial steps in the enrollment process, both at our school and nationally, via call 


centers that were encouraging enrollment of students who were obviously ill-suited for 


learning in a virtual environment. It was apparent to those of us operating schools that 


parents weren't being given the whole story. K12 oversold students' potential to be 


successful and obligated teachers to do things they wouldn't likely to be able to do.  


Eventually, it seemed as though K12's enrollment strategy was to cast a wide net 


into the sea of school choice and keep whatever they caught regardless if the catch 


was appropriate for virtual learning or not.  


During weekly enrollment calls we were constantly pressured to overlook enrollment 


paperwork that was critical, consistent with best practice, or even compliant with state 


guidelines. For example, in order to speed up enrollment conversions, we were 


pressured by enrollment management to enroll students without a birth certificate or 


proof of custody. In my opinion, the company was totally crossing the line. 


I am shocked that the stock continues to rise. I think it's a house of cards that is 


going to collapse. It boggles my mind when I read about and hear stories about what's 


going on in schools managed by K12. (emphasis added)

K12 and Its Peers Spend Millions to 


Attract Students 


• Online charter schools, using local taxpayer money, "are buying TV, radio, 


newspaper and Internet ads to attract students, even as brick-and-mortar public 


schools in the districts they serve face budget crunches." 


• "The USA TODAY analysis finds that 10 of the largest for-profit operators have 


spent an estimated $94.4 million on ads since 2007. The largest, Virginia-based 


K12 Inc., has spent about $21.5 million in just the first eight months of 2012." 


• "A look at where K12 is placing the ads suggests that the company is also working 


to appeal to kids: Among the hundreds of outlets tapped this year, K12 has spent 


an estimated $631,600 to advertise on Nickelodeon, $601,600 on The Cartoon 


Network and $671,400 on MeetMe.com, a social networking site popular with 


teens. It also dropped $3,000 on VampireFreaks.com, which calls itself "the Web's 


largest community for dark alternative culture."" 


• "Kevin Welner, a University of Colorado professor who tracks virtual schools, 


estimated that K12 is on pace this year to spend about $340 per student on 


advertising, or about 5.2% of its per-pupil public expenditures" 


• "K12 spokesman Jeff Kwitowski wouldn't say whether the estimates are accurate or 


provide actual K12 figures."

Other Former Employees Describe K12's High-


Pressure, Misleading Sales Tactics That Deceive 


and Mislead Parents and Students 


Former sales employees at K12's call centers described high pressure to make 


huge enrollment quotas in order to get a commission. Sales employees were 


provided with a "script" of what to say to prospective students and parents, 


including purported "statistics" showing that K12 students were years more 


advanced than brick-and-mortar school students. Sample quotes: 


1. CW2 described a toxic work environment where sales staff were pressured to 


meet unrealistic quotas, frequently being forced to make as many as 200 


outgoing calls daily to keep up. CW2 confirmed that sales staff were never 


given any actual data of student performance, but were instead fed statistics 


from K12's website, and were told to tell parents that students who did the K12 


program for 1-2 years performed better than their peers at brick and mortar 


schools. 


2. CW4 stated that there was constant pressure to generate sales, describing the 


Company's sales philosophy as "enroll, enroll, enroll." CW4 stated that 


enrollment consultants were instructed to refer to the performance of K12 


students as "comparable [to] or even better" than the performance of students 


at traditional schools, and to state that students at K12 schools were "on a 


better tier" than those at traditional schools.

K12 Is Increasingly Targeting At-Risk Students 


That It Knows Are Likely to Fail (1)  


• K12 CEO Ron Packard claims that K12 is serving at-risk students for noble 


reasons: "It's just K12's culture. We want to help kids. It's just so ingrained all the 


way through the organization about helping as many kids, doing the right thing for 


kids." At another time, he said: "We don't want to be recruiting kids who it's not 


right for. That would be a disaster academically. It would be a disaster for the 


company economically." 


• Based on my conversations with Packard, I believe he's sincere – but others are 


more skeptical. Luis Huerta, Associate Professor of Education & Public Policy at 


Teachers College, Columbia University, who has studied K12 carefully and 


published reports on virtual schools, told me: 


"The virtual providers like K12 are now mostly going after at-risk kids, kids on their last 


straw – if they didn't sign up, many would be dropouts or go back to juvenile court.  


K12's phone banks have figured out a way to target dropouts and special ed kids. They 


will sign up anyone – as long as that warm body signs in periodically, K12 can draw 


enrollment money from the district.  


It isn't for some noble reason – it's because these kids demand the least amount of 


education. These aren't kids and parents who will be knocking on K12's doors saying, "Hey, 


you need to do more for my kid."  


K12 and Packard use this as an advertisement, saying they're doing noble things and 


wondering why they're being criticized. It's almost comical. It's so misleading and 


conniving." (emphasis added)

K12 Is Increasingly Targeting At-Risk Students 


That It Knows Are Likely to Fail (2)  


• One person told me that online charters know that "internet advertising leads to lots of students 


enrolling, but none succeed. Yet online charters are spending big money on this." 


• A board member of a K12 school told me: "K12 was enrolling kids over the phone or online, 


without intentional regard for fit and careful likelihood to succeed. They advertise to the wrong 


demographic. And, they are enrolling a very large number of new students in August and 


September – after the school year has started – which is indicative of why growth hasn't been 


the right kind of growth." 


• A former K12 Market Research Manager described how K12's aggressive marketing kept 


recruiting children unsuited to K12's program, stated "it was as if you were trying to stop the 


bleeding but were still inflicting wounds at the same time." 


• A former Employment Consultant wrote the following on the web site, Glassdoor: 


They push these quotes and "true stories" about all the children they have helped, but the truth is, this 


product is really only good for about 10% of the market that they target. The only success stories come 


from homes where there is a large parental support and willingness for the student to learn. K12 markets 


to low income families who are oftentimes more interested in a free computer and staying out of truancy 


court than anything else. Not only that, but the curriculum (which is actually very well developed) simply 


will not work for a low educated family who is having a hard time getting their child to go to a brick and 


mortar school, let [alone] apply themselves in a home based environment. They push enrollments on 


families where the adult in the home cannot even read, speak, or write in English, knowing that these 


students are destined to fail. (emphasis added) 


While K12 celebrates how many at-risk students it's serving, I view it as an educational 


catastrophe in light of the these students' need for intensive, personalized instruction and hence 


how inappropriate online education is for most of them

Former Employees Tell Consistent Stories of 


Harried, Overworked, Unsupported Teachers 


My interview with a former teacher at K12's Largest School, Agora (PA)  


"I taught English at Agora from 2010-12. It was a horrible experience. Every teacher had the 


same experience I did. It was all of us. 


Before I started, I was told there would be a lot of support, a low student-teacher ratio, and 


that if there were students who didn't show up, they'd take them out and replace them with 


another. But they took everybody. There was no teacher to student ratio.  


When I started, I was assigned 300 students, which was very, very overwhelming. I would try 


to spend the appropriate time to read and grade each of the essays students turned, but I was 


really struggling with that. I couldn't keep up. I was told to skim over the papers and grade with a 


rubric. 


For each class, I'd have maybe seven out of 30 students in that particular section attend – and 


even among those seven, just because their name was there showing them present doesn't 


mean they were at their computers. 


A huge portion of my students never showed up or did anything. I have no clue what 


happened to them, though I have no doubt Agora was charging the state for them. I would tell 


Agora at the end of the week that I had concerns about certain students, so they'd tell me it was 


the teachers job to call the families. Once we set up an entire day and called students on the list, 


but I couldn't reach most of them. 


When it came time to give grades, I was told, whatever I had to do, I had to pass every 


student. 


I would not say there was much learning going on. If students were doing the program like 


they were supposed to, it could work – but the majority of students weren't coming from a family 


where a parent would help them. (emphasis added)

Comments By a Board Member of a K12 


School About How K12 Treats Teachers 


Interview with a board member of a nonprofit charter school that's contracted with K12: 


K12 apparently thinks teachers are a necessary evil and have a factory 


production line model. In some ways it's become a businessman's approach to 


education, which I don't inherently mind (as a businessman myself), but they've 


tried to make teachers become something they are not.  


Our teachers report that they are only able to spend 30% of their time actually 


teaching kids; the rest of their time they're required to do other things. Great 


teachers love to teach kids. Our teachers are not able to focus 100% of their time 


doing what they're trained to do. 


The assessment culture that K12 has desperately thrown at this doesn't work. 


Our teachers have to use several different systems and can't get real-time data – it 


takes many days or even weeks. 


What gets measured gets managed. K12 has teacher metrics that have nothing 


to do with educating kids. It's absurd. Teachers don't respond well to being 


managed in the same way some might try to manage a sales team. 


Across all of K12's virtual academies nationwide, teacher satisfaction is not 


great.

The Poor Performance and Reputation of K12 and 


Its Peers Is Hurting the Ed Reform Movement 


Interview with a friend who runs a high-performing bricks-and-mortar charter school in 


a state in which K12 has a large presence: 


The results of the online schools (of which K12's is among the largest) are so 


terrible that, when CREDO studied the entire charter sector in our state, the 


online schools dragged down all charter schools' results to such a degree that 


our state was one of the worst that CREDO had studied. 


The scandals and terrible academic results of the online schools are hurting all 


charter schools because we get lumped in with them. 


The statewide charter school organization has a terrible dilemma because the 


online charters provide much of the funding – and boy can they turn out a lot of 


parents at rallies! (Not surprising, I guess, given how much money the online 


charters spend on this and the fact that these are stay-at-home kids so they're 


easily available to attend rallies.) But the conflicts are so great that we and a few 


other high-performing charters have hired our own lobbyist. 


To persuade us to keep working with them, the online charters actually make 


the "first they came for us, then they'll come for you" argument. Seriously!  


I can understand why, in the short term, it's convenient to work with them, but 


in the long-term it's going to kill us. I agree with you completely that they're a 


cancer that we have to cut out of our movement.

Math
Why K12's Scantron Results Are 


Virtually Meaningless 


• K12 measures its students' academic growth (shown in the charts on the 


previous two pages) using the Scantron test, which is not a state-adopted exam, 


but rather simply a diagnostic tool that is used by K12 


• K12 has yet to allow independent external evaluators to both validate its data 


collection efforts and more importantly evaluate its analysis of student 


achievement data, across all K12 schools 


• The Scantron test is given in the home, unsupervised and untimed, making it 


easy for students to get help from a parent or the internet 


• Jeff Shaw, former Head of School of Ohio Virtual Academy, comments: 


• For K12 students, Scantron is given in the home. It is possible for a parent to help 


Johnny or coach Johnny intentionally or unintentionally. It wasn't unusual for parents to 


call the school to express concerns that their student had been taking the assessment 


too long and in tears over the test. Parents were resistant and objected to Scantron 


testing because it represented one more thing they had to oversee and one more test 


their student had to take. Also of concern with parents and students was the fact that 


students were being tested on items they had not yet learned in the K12 curriculum.  


• K12's purportedly strong Scantron results stand in stark contrast to K12 


students' dismal results on state tests 


• Noting the discrepancy, K12 only says it is "not seeing the same level of success with 


external gains models that are now being used in some states, and thus, we are actively 


engaged in research to analyze why our Scantron gains scores do not always correlate 


to the states' gains scores." 
-38-
K12's Own Data Shows Why Its Scantron 


Results Can't Be Relied On 


• K12 says that "In the fall of 2011, and again in the spring of 2012, approximately 


38,700 K12-managed public school students in grades 3–10 took the Scantron 


Performance Series tests in Math and Reading…Only students who are enrolled 


for a full academic year and take the fall and spring tests within the designated 


Scantron Performance Series testing windows are compared with the normed 


group data" 


• As of 9/30/11, K12 had 106,665 students in its Managed Public Schools division 


and approximately 70% of K12 students are in grades 3-10, so K12 had 75,000 


students who were eligible to take the Scantron tests 


• Yet only 38,700 (52%) did. Why? There are only two possible answers, both of 


which skew the data toward the most successful students: 


1) Either a large fraction of eligible students didn't take the test, or;  


2) A large number of students who were present and took the Scantron test in the fall of 


2011 were no longer students in the spring of 2012, indicating high turnover 


• In either case, it means the results are virtually meaningless – but that hasn't 


prevented K12 from peddling them to shareholders, politicians, regulators, etc.

Even K12 Admits That Its Scantron Results 


Can't Be Relied On 


"The Scantron tests are optional for K12 students, and about 30 percent 


decline to take them. That means the company has been comparing a 


self-selected group of K12 students to the national norm, which isn't 


appropriate, [K12 Executive Chairman Nathaniel] Davis said. 


The company, he said, needs to find "a more honest assessment" of 


student progress. 


Davis said he pushed teachers to prod more students to take the 


Scantron last spring in hopes of getting a more valid sample. The 


company has not released data from those exams."

University of Arkansas Study of K12's 


Arkansas Virtual Academy 


• K12 often cites a University of Arkansas evaluation released in 2012 of the Arkansas Virtual 


Academy (ARVA), which "found that students attending the online public charter school 


perform very well compared to nearly identical students in other Arkansas public schools. 


The study found "very positive trends for ARVA" and highlighted five conclusions: 


• ARVA students outperformed their comparison peers in math. 


• ARVA students outperformed their comparison peers in literacy. 


• The positive trends were apparent in nearly all grade cohorts. 


• Economically disadvantaged students did particularly well at ARVA, outperforming their comparison 


peers in math and literacy.  (Sixty-one percent of ARVA students are identified as economically 


disadvantaged). 


• There were no statistically significant negative effects for ARVA students in the analyses conducted." 


• There are a number of reasons to discount this study, however: 


• It only considered students who had taken tests in both 2009 and 2011 (the first and last years in the 


sample period). If student attrition at ARVA is anything close to other K12 schools, well under half of 


students would be there for two full years – reflecting a small subset of students who may, in fact, be 


doing well at ARVA 


• By state law, ARVA is capped at 500 students so ARVA has likely been more selective in taking only 


students who are likely to succeed at an online school (exactly what every K12 school should be 


doing!) 


• ARVA only goes through 8th grade (in high school, course failure rates are very high and overall 


student achievement and withdrawal rates are higher) 


• It's also interesting to note that an article about the study is posted on K12's web site, but 


the actual study has been removed from the site and I cannot find it anywhere on the web

nearly identical to the overall performance of all private Education Management

K12's Academic Results Are Dismal By 


Many Other Measures as Well 


• 29 of 36 K12 schools (81%) that were assigned school performance 


ratings by state education authorities failed to earn a rating that indicated 


satisfactory progress status in 2010-11 


• The mean performance on state math and reading assessments of K12-


operated virtual schools consistently lags behind performance levels of 


the states from which the schools draw their students. 


• Across grades 3-11, the K12 schools' scores were between two and 11 


percentage points below the state average in reading. 


• In math, K12 students score, on average, between 14 and 36 percentage 


points lower than students in their host states, with the gap increasing 


dramatically for students in higher grades.

K12's Dismal Academic Results Are Not 


Due to Serving More At-Risk Students 


K12 claims that its dismal academic results are because it serves more at-


risk students, but this is questionable for two reasons: 


1) Though its proportion of at-risk students has indeed risen in recent 


years, it's from a low base so it's not clear whether K12 is, in fact, 


serving a higher proportion of such students relative to state averages 


2) Even growth measures show dismal performance  


 K12 argues (correctly) that "a more accurate method for measuring 


student performance is the progress a student makes over the course of a 


school year, also known as a "growth measure"

K12 Tries to Excuse Its Dismal Academic Results By 


Highlighting the Number of At-Risk Students It Serves, 


Which Has Increased in Recent Years 


Source: 2013 K12 Academic Report, 2/6/13. 


"We estimate that as many as 50% to 70% of new 


students did not achieve proficiency in math on 


state exams taken in the year before enrolling in a 


K12-managed public school, and up to 40% did not 


achieve proficiency in reading. K12-managed 


public schools are also being chosen by large 


numbers of high school students who are not on 


track for on-time graduation—in one sampling of 


these schools, approximately 40% to 60% of 


incoming 10th, 11th, and 12th graders were credit 


deficient upon enrollment." 


In fairness to K12, charter school laws 


require them to accept all applicants, 


but K12 is aggressively targeting 


students it knows are least likely to 


succeed at an online school. As noted 


on page 25, I view the number of at-


risk students K12 is serving as an 


educational catastrophe rather than 


something to be celebrated.

Conclusions From A Study of Colorado's 


10 Largest Online Charter Schools (1) 


• Students attending Colorado's full-time online education programs have 


typically lagged their peers on virtually every academic indicator, from 


state test scores to student growth measures to high school graduation 


rates. (emphasis added) 


• Between 2004 and 2011, [K12's] COVA's reading scores dropped six 


percentage points and math results flatlined. Academic growth indicators 


put student progress at 29 in math and 36 in reading, far below the state 


average of 50. 


• Online student scores on statewide achievement tests are consistently 14 


to 26 percentage points below state averages for reading, writing and math 


over the past four years. The gap in reading and writing has remained 


about the same between 2008 and 2011, and the gap in math has risen 


several percentage points. 


• Double-digit gaps in achievement on state exams between online students 


and their peers in traditional schools persist in nearly every grade and 


subject – and they're widest among more affluent students. 


• Most online school students do not appear to be at-risk students.

Conclusions From A Study of Colorado's 


10 Largest Online Charter Schools (2) 


• Half the online students wind up leaving within a year. When they do, 


they're often further behind academically than when they started. 


• Students who transfer to online programs from brick-and-mortar schools 


posted lower scores on annual state reading exams after entering their 


virtual classrooms…59 percent had scored proficient or above in reading 


while in a brick-and-motor school. But after a year in online school, only 51 


percent achieved that score. 


• Students who stayed in online programs long enough to take two years' 


worth of state reading exams actually saw their test results decline over 


time. 


• Millions of dollars are going to virtual schools for students who no 


longer attend online classes. 


• The churn of students in and out of online schools is putting pressure 


on brick-and-mortar schools, which then must find money in their 


budgets to educate students who come from online schools mid-year.

Conclusions From A Study of Colorado's 


10 Largest Online Charter Schools (3) 


• Online schools also had among the highest dropout rates and lowest 


graduation rates in the state over the past two years. In 2010, fewer 


than one in four online school seniors graduated compared to nearly 


three of every four high school seniors statewide. (emphasis added) 


• The dropout rate in the top 10 largest online programs last year was 12 


percent – quadruple the state average of 3 percent. 


• Other studies of Colorado online students have found similarly poor 


results: The state's annual online school report released in June found 


that "results indicate achievement of online students consistently lags 


behind those of non-online students, even after controlling for grade 


levels and various student characteristics," such as poverty, English 


language ability and special education status.

• Some online schools appear to be collecting a full year's payment for 


students and then sending them back to regular schools 


• Many of GOAL's recruited students returned to St. Vrain schools in the 


middle of the year, behind in school, Haddad said. For many of the 


returning students, their time in the online program was "wasted," he said. 


These institutions, what they do is borderline unethical behavior in my 


mind," said Haddad, who supports online learning as a tool. "It's a money-


making proposition and they have no problem sending the kids back after 


the October count. The sales job they get up front, it's a travesty." 


…About a dozen of the students came back after Oct. 1, the official state 


count day to determine per-pupil funding. GOAL got the funding; Florence 


got the students back. Then the school had to find ways to help them catch 


up.

Lessons From the Only K12 School I've Identified 


That Doesn't Have Terrible Academic Outcomes 


• The Dorothy I. Height Community Academy Public Charter School is Washington 


DC's only online school and uses K12's "award winning curriculum" 


• It's a mediocre school, rated Tier 2 (out of 3) with a score of 55.4% (down from 


64.1% in 2011). But it does represent the first K12 school I've found that's not truly 


terrible. Eureka! 


• So is this evidence that my assessment of K12 schools is wrong? Not at all – in 


fact, it confirms what I've been saying: namely that, to be successful, online 


charters need to be carefully targeted to the small number of students for whom 


this type of education is appropriate. Height Community Academy is a perfect 


example of what every K12 school should be: small! It only has 95 students. In 


contrast, K12's Ohio Virtual Academy has 13,800 students, 145 times as many, and 


Agora in Pennsylvania has more than 8,000 students. These are the schools that 


are more typical of K12 – and the ones that have run amok. 


• Also, note that Height Community Academy does not serve a representative subset 


of DC public school students: it doesn't have a single English Language Learner 


(vs. 10% for the district), only 8% special ed (vs. 17%), and most importantly, a 


mere 26% are low income (vs. 77%). This reinforces what I've been saying about 


the students who are mostly likely to succeed in an online school: those who are 


not at risk and who have a college-educated parent at home with them full time as 


the parent coach (meaning, in most cases, these families are not low income).

2010/2011 school year with 9,593 withdrawing by the end of the year, for 


an astoundingly high churn rate of 51.1% 


 CAVA schools signed up a total of 16,934 students in the 2010/2011 


school year (11,682 were enrolled in September) and 23.8% pulled out. 


 COVA schools had 6,449 students registered through the 2010/2011

In Pennsylvania and Colorado, the Dropout 


Rate Is Roughly 50% 


• Columbia Prof. Luis Huerta confirms the high dropout rates at Agora: 


• "We calculated churn rates as high as 57%, where September 2009 


enrollment was 4,718 kids and by May 2010,  2,688 kids had dropped out. 


Yet during the same academic year they enrolled 2,860 new kids, and 


finished the year with 5,022 kids." [see Appendix A for details] 


• In Colorado, "Half the online students wind up leaving within a year." 


(note that this includes all online schools, not just K12's) 


• Of 10,500 students in the largest online programs in fall 2008, more than 


half – or 5,600 – left their virtual schools by the fall of 2009. They were 


more than replaced by 7,400 new recruits by that fall. That new group also 


experienced high turnover, with more than a third of the students leaving 


by the end of that school year, the analysis showed. By October 2010, only 


about a quarter of the students remained in their same online program after 


two years. (emphasis added)

Testimony as Part of a Class Action Lawsuit 


Reveals K12's Student Churn 


Employee CW3 


CW3, a former administrator at California Virtual Academy who attended weekly enrollment 


meetings, confirmed that the turnover rate was high, stating that as soon as students withdrew, 


more would be brought in to replace them. CW3 referred to California Virtual Academy as a 


"revolving door." 


Employee CW5 


CW5, a former K12 Market Research Manager from July 2008 to April 2011, confirmed that 


management internally tracked churn. CW5 was a statistician with a doctorate who was 


charged, among other things, with studying churn at K12's schools. According to CW5, another 


factor contributing to churn was the mistaken impression (fed by the Company's marketing 


team) that K12's program was flexible and not state-regulated – when it became clear that the 


program was required to meet certain state requirements, the parents withdrew their children. 


CW5, describing how K12's aggressive marketing kept recruiting children unsuited to K12's 


program, stated "it was as if you were trying to stop the bleeding but were still inflicting wounds 


at the same time." (emphasis added) 


According to CW5, by 2009 "everybody knew there was an issue with retention," and the 


Company accordingly created an internal "Retention Task Force," comprised of V.P.- and-


above level employees, to focus on retention problems. Defendants, however, did not publicly 


disclose the retention and churn problems until the end of the Class Period.

Is K12 Receiving Money It Shouldn't From 


States Via Lax Enrollment Policies? (1) 


In most states, K12 must stop charging states for students if they stop signing in after a certain 


period of time, but there is significant anecdotal evidence that K12 doesn't do this: 
• A study of 10 online schools in Colorado concluded that "millions of dollars are going to virtual schools for students who no 


longer attend online classes." 


• A former Agora teacher told me: 


If students didn't log attendance for 10 days in a row, they were supposed to be withdrawn, but it never happened. 


When I mentioned it to Agora, they never replied. 


The only time I ever saw a student drop off is if a parent were to notify Agora (that their child was withdrawing). It 


was very rare to see a student drop off. They'd stay on for the whole year. 


• Heidi Gardner, a former K12 special ed teacher at Agora, said the turnover in enrollment led to a massive expansion in 


non-instruction work for teachers: 


If you weren't trying to make initial [E-mail or phone] contact with new students then you were trying to keep on top 


of the 'inactive' [students who had not logged on to Agora's web portal in a few days] or confirm if students who not been 


in contact with [teachers] for weeks or months were still enrolled. You could add four hours to your work day doing this. 


• A Bloomberg BusinessWeek article noted: 


At least 15 percent of the students enrolled in cyberschools in Pennsylvania's Bangor district end up as virtual 


truants, Superintendent Patricia Mulroy estimates. As Mulroy puts it: "We pay for them, even though they haven't logged 


in." 


• Another teacher wrote on the web site Glassdoor (see Appendix B): 


More than half of my job is not about teaching, but about how to trick the state to give K12 more money, so the 


CEOs will get more pay 


• Melony Black, a former K12 English teacher at the Colorado Virtual Academy, said: 


Three-quarters of my credit recovery kids never logged in, never completed any work, never answered their emails 


or phone calls, yet they remained on my class rosters. I began wondering about the state-mandated hours for students 


at the high school level. No one is monitoring this as far as I can see. (emphasis added)

Is K12 Receiving Money It Shouldn't From 


States Via Lax Enrollment Policies? (2) 


A story in the NY Times reports: 
"With retention a problem, some teachers said they were under pressure to pass students with marginal 


performance and attendance.  


Students need simply to log in to be marked present for the day, according to Agora teachers and 


administrators.  


For most students, attendance is recommended but not mandatory at what are called synchronous sessions — 


when they can interact online with the teacher. A new grading policy states that students who do not turn in work 


will be given a "50" rather than a zero. Several teachers said assignments were frequently open for unlimited 


retakes.  


Agora records from last year show that failing students were told they could make up their work. "All students 


with a course average of 40 to 59 percent were called and told all assignments past due could be made up without 


penalty," according to minutes from a school board meeting. Similar calls were going out to students with averages 


of 0 to 39 percent.  


Theresa Henderson, an Agora teacher until June 2010 and the mother of four of its students, said she was 


among faculty members who requested a stronger policy to dismiss students who were not doing their work.  


Several current and former staff members said that a lax policy had allowed students to remain on the rolls 


even when they failed to log in for days. Officials of the Elizabeth Forward School District in western Pennsylvania 


complained that Agora had billed the district for students who were not attending.  


One of them was a girl who had missed 55 days but was still on the school's roster, according to Margaret 


Boucher, assistant business manager at Elizabeth Forward.  


The school has cracked down on disengaged students, according to a statement by its director, Sharon 


Williams, who said a policy adopted last December mandates attendance at online classes for those students who 


do not log in, repeatedly fail to complete lessons or are failing three courses. She said the school follows state law 


by removing students who are absent for 10 consecutive days.  


Poor attendance and disengaged students have been such a problem that Agora dismissed 600 students last 


year for nonattendance, 149 of them just before state tests were administered, according to school board minutes."

Audits of K12's enrollment figures revealed significant problems in 


Michigan and Nevada: 
• In Michigan, pupil count auditors described difficulties auditing Michigan Virtual 


Academy's enrollment in 2010. "While teachers sign a print-out of log-ins, there 


is no verifiable evidence of student attendance, absences are not recorded, and 


many parents do not complete or submit their attendance paperwork on count 


day. For an auditor, this lack of systemic recordkeeping poses a distinct 


problem."  


• Similarly, a 2009-2010 Nevada audit found that "Nevada Virtual Academy was 


unable to produce and maintain complete enrollment records in a timely manner. 


While we were eventually able to reconcile enrollment and attendance reports, it 


was noted that the completed Master Register contained multiple inaccuracies 


regarding the dates and codes for pupil enrollment or withdrawal [and] [t]hese 


Master Register violations are repeat findings from the previous Pupil Enrollment 


and Attendance Audit." (emphasis added)

K12's Relationship With 


Nonprofit Charter Holders
K12's Relationship With Nonprofit Charter 


Holders Is Rife With Conflicts and Self-Dealing,  


Which May Violate IRS and State Regulations 


• Of the 42 states (and DC) that permit charter schools, most will only grant charters to nonprofit 


501(c)(3) entities, for which the IRS code states: "none of its earnings may inure to any private 


shareholder and individual" 


• This presents a vexing problem for K12, but it gets around this by signing long-term contracts with 


local nonprofit entities to provide management and other services that, in effect, allow K12 to siphon 


off all of the profits for itself 


• While this type of arrangement doesn't technically violate IRS regulations – nonprofits contact with for-profit 


businesses all the time – it's critical that the nonprofit be a truly independent entity with an independent board 


of directors looking out solely for the nonprofit mission of the organization. 


• This doesn't appear to be happening with many of the nonprofit charter schools K12 contracts with: 


• K12 employees sometimes serve on the board of the nonprofits and, worse yet, are sometimes involved with 


their very creation (One person told me that "Many of these nonprofit boards are tiny, clueless, dysfunctional, 


and have K12 employees on them") 


• The contracts are often awarded to K12 without competitive bidding 


• K12 usually directly or indirectly employs all key people, including the Treasurer – a particularly blatant 


conflict of interest 


• K12 often reviews its own billings and then fails to provide the boards with detailed accounting for its 


expenditures 


• The contract with K12 typically results in the nonprofit entity reporting minimal "profits" or, often, a loss, which 


K12 then "forgives" 


• "We take responsibility for any operating deficits incurred at most of the Managed Public Schools we serve" – 


LRN 2013 10-K 


Conclusion: Many of these nonprofits are a sham. For all intents and purposes, K12 


controls, operates, and profits from the supposedly nonprofit charter schools, in 


blatant violation of most states' laws and IRS regulations.

Newark Prep Charter School Is a Good Example of 


How K12 Effectively Runs Schools That Are 


Supposed to Be Nonprofit (1) 


"Newark Prep Charter School opened last year with 150 students, a dozen 


teachers and big ambitions to become among the first schools in the state to offer 


classes taught online.  


It hired K12 Inc., a for-profit online learning giant, to handle the start-up and offer 


many of the services the high school would provide.  


A contract obtained by The Star-Ledger shows the publicly traded company — 


which operates charter schools for thousands of students in 27 states and made 


$30 million in the last school year — selected Newark Prep's principal, drafted its 


budget and leased it furniture and equipment.  


In return, Newark Prep paid the company nearly half a million dollars, or 17 


percent of the $2.8 million it received last school year to educate students, 


according to financial data provided by the school's board of trustees. This year, as 


the student body grows, the fees could take up to 40 percent of the school's 


revenue, according to the contract.  


New Jersey law allows for-profit companies to play a big role in public schools.  


One thing they can't do is run the place.  


But charter school experts and one lawmaker said it's sometime hard to tell if the 


rules are being followed, and K12's involvement with Newark Prep is one of those 


instances. (continued on next page)

""Technically, on the books, K12 is just a contractor hired by Newark Prep 


Charter School, but in reality it is running the school, soup to nuts," said Luis 


Huerta, a Columbia University Teachers College professor who studies the impact 


of virtual charter schools across the country. 


In addition, Assembly Education Committee Chairman Patrick Deignan (D-


Middlesex) called the steep fees and the terms of the contract "deeply troubling." 


…A letter written on behalf of the seven-member board called the $489,848 the 


school paid K12 last school year a "tremendous bargain" because the company 


allowed the school to postpone payment of other fees it was scheduled to pay last 


year.  


"The board, principal and school business administrator set all policies and run 


the school," the letter states. "K12 is a vendor. They make suggestions and provide 


support, but that's all." 


But when asked to describe a specific responsibility it handles without any 


guidance or assistance from K12 Inc., the board could not name one."

"…Seemingly contradictory clauses in the contract cement K12's authority over 


important decisions that affect the school's academic success and the company's 


bottom line, said Huerta, of Columbia. 


For example, the contract stipulates that Newark Prep's board must oversee K12 


Inc.'s work, but it also requires K12 to implement whatever school policies it deems 


necessary for the success of its proprietary online curriculum. 


The contract, which was drafted by K12., states that Newark Prep Charter 


School and the company are "independent contractors," pursuant to New Jersey 


laws and regulations, yet K12 is free to use the school's name "in press releases, 


on its website, or in other marketing materials." 


The document also states in a section titled "exclusivity" that the school cannot 


consider hiring another curriculum contractor or breaking its agreement with K12 


without giving 18 months' notice or getting permission from the company. 


If the company expects the school's state aid to decline dramatically, however, it 


can cancel the contract with 60 days' notice."

Ohio Virtual Academy Is Another Good Example of 


How K12 Effectively Runs Schools That Are 


Supposed to Be Nonprofit 


Jeff Shaw's comments about the Ohio Virtual Academy: 


It was rather obvious to me as Head of School that K12 wasn't 


always interested in reducing the non-profits' expenses if those 


savings would impact the bottom line for K12.  


K12 assumed control of most of the OHVA budget and a majority of 


any excess funds was soaked up by the end of the year, often to the 


point where the school would show a loss. In this case, the agreement 


with K12 required them to issue a credit for management fees so 


OHVA would show a small surplus for the fiscal year.  


The volunteer governing boards assume a limited role in the 


school's overall governance. The boards tend to put their faith in K12 


and count on it to do what is in the school's best interest. A Head of 


School walks a fine line in order to balance the best interests of both 


parties. In many cases, the boards know only what K12 wants them to 


know. It's like the fox guarding the henhouse.

Comments By a Board Member of a K12 


School 


Interview with a board member of a nonprofit charter school that's contracted 


with K12: 


Everything you said about the nonprofits not being fully independent, 


about K12 exercising an inappropriate level of control was certainly true 


at our school for more than a decade. 


One of the problems with the nonprofits K12 contracts with: most have 


no staff, so they are totally dependent on K12. There's no review of 


invoices, no independence, no accountability.  


K12 received nearly 80 cents of every dollar we received from the 


state, excluding teacher salaries. It's outrageous! 


They've forgotten that we're the customer and they're the vendor.

The IRS Is Scrutinizing the Tax-Exempt Status of 


Online Schools That Use For-Profit Management 


Companies Like K12 


-79- 
Source: Increased IRS Scrutiny of Charter Schools Operated by For-Profit Management Companies, Lewis Roca Rothberger, 6/8/12. 


An alert by the law firm of Lewis Roca Rothberger warns: 


Many charter schools are intended to be operated as 501(c)(3) public charities. 


Historically, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has carefully reviewed other types of 


charitable organizations operated by management companies to determine whether they 


qualify as a tax-exempt charities because they are, in fact, operating for the private benefit 


of the for-profit management company. However, the IRS has not brought a similar focus 


on this issue to charter schools generally – until now. The IRS is poised to increase its 


scrutiny of charter school/management company relationships and is now subjecting 


charter schools to more stringent standards defining such relationships.  


Certainly, for those charter schools with management companies that are now seeking 


or will be seeking tax-exempt status, the level scrutiny of applications for recognition of tax-


exempt status will increase.  


Charter schools subject to management agreements that are already exempt should be 


prepared to closely review their management agreements with their counsel to confirm that 


the management agreement does not violate private inurement and private benefit 


restrictions applicable to all charitable organizations.  


The IRS has thus far refused to disclose the standards and criteria it will employ in 


reviewing tax exemption applications of charter schools with management companies. It is 


clear that the IRS's review of charter school management agreements will become more 


common and burdensome for both existing and new charter schools, and may require 


amending management agreements – both with respect to their substantive terms and 


their pricing.
Does K12 Really Save States Money?
It's Not Clear Whether K12 Saves 


States Money 


Though K12 schools only cost "approximately 60% of the national average 


per-pupil expenditure," it's not clear that they really save states money 


• Online schools result in states paying for an unknown number of 


students who would otherwise be home schooled (at parental expense) 


• "Another way K12 maximizes its income is to establish schools in poor 


districts, which receive larger subsidies in some states."  


"The company administers one of K12's newest schools from Union County, 


Tenn., a mountainous Appalachian enclave where nearly a quarter of the 


residents live in poverty.  


The Tennessee Virtual Academy is technically part of the local school 


district, which receives more per pupil from the state than most other districts 


in Tennessee. But of the school's 1,800 pupils, few are actually from Union 


County.  


Out of the state money, the Union County schools will get an administrative 


fee of about $400,000. K12 stands to collect almost $10 million to staff and 


manage the school. Dozens of other Tennessee counties, however, lost state 


financing when some of their students elected to go to the virtual school."

Case Study: Virginia (1) 


"The Virginia Virtual Academy, another K12 venture, began enrolling full-time 


students across the commonwealth in fall 2009, more than a year before state law 


addressed this new kind of education. 


The Virginia school offers a lesson in how K12 relied on political savvy and 


statehouse connections to build its business. 


The Virginia venture was a partnership between the traditional schools of Carroll 


County — a rural county bordering North Carolina — and K12. Children who 


enrolled in the Virtual Virginia Academy were counted as Carroll County students 


no matter where they lived. 


That was no accident. 


State aid varies by school district and follows a formula based on poverty, among 


other factors. Affluent Fairfax County receives $2,716 per pupil from Richmond, 


whereas relatively poor Carroll County receives $5,421, according to the state 


Education Department. 


This year, 66 Fairfax students are enrolled in the virtual school. Richmond is 


paying the virtual school twice as much for those students as it would if they 


attended neighborhood schools in their own county. 


"Clearly, it's not a logical or equitable system," said state Sen. George L. Barker 


(D-Fairfax). "It's a horrible deal for taxpayers.""

• "PA spends about…$3,500 more per student to educate a child in a cyber charter school 


compared to the national average, which adds up to $315 million in annual savings." 


• Yet the legislature hasn't acted. Why? Perhaps it's because, as the New York

• "Has spent $681,000 on lobbying since 2007. The company also has friends in high 


places. Charles Zogby, the state's budget secretary, had been senior vice president of 


education and policy for K12. In a statement, Mr. Zogby said he still owned a small 


number of K12 shares, but did not make decisions specifically affecting online schools."

"Among individual donors backing cyber schools, few have been as generous as 


William Lager, who founded Ohio's largest virtual school, ECOT — and who runs 


both the company that manages the school and the company that sells the school its 


online curriculum. 


Lager has contributed $387,000 to Republican politicians and political organizing 


committees just in the past year and a half, a period in which the state began to 


calculate academic growth for all students in cyber schools — and found ECOT 


sorely lacking. On the most recent state report card, ECOT got an F on every

…Republican Gov. John Kasich has made clear that low scores and poor growth 


rates are unacceptable in Ohio's traditional school districts. He has even proposed 


stripping funding from urban public schools and turning them over to private groups 


that promise better results. 


But he and other leading lawmakers have shied away from criticizing ECOT, which 


serves about 14,000 students and received $88 million in public funds last year. Nor 


have they taken on other low-performing cyber schools in Ohio, including one run by

"Indeed, Ohio's existing cyber schools are in line to get more money per student in 


the coming school year; the legislature even voted to permit them to tap, for the first 


time, into funding reserved for vocational and technical education. A state legislative 


analysis puts the boost at an estimated $4.5 million extra for ECOT alone, if it maintains 


its enrollment. 


A spokesman for Gov. Kasich, Rob Nichols, said the bounty of donations from Lager 


and Brennan has not influenced treatment of their schools. 


"Obviously not," he said. 


Nichols pointed to the governor's effort last year to pass standards for cyber schools; 


the draft didn't require schools to hit specific academic benchmarks but did urge them 


"to provide a high quality education." The draft did not pass the legislature. 


ECOT Vice President Nick Wilson, meanwhile, said the school rejects as invalid all 


the F's on its state report card. The school does its own assessments, he said, and is 


confident its students are learning. "Is it leaps and bounds above where they were? Not 


necessarily," he said. "But it is progress."

their kids?" (continued on next page) 


The protest was prompted by questions Mr. Dyer had raised over the 


state's financing formula for charter and online schools. The group 


describes itself as a coalition of parents, teachers and employees of the 


schools. But Mr. Dyer said that his wife questioned the people carrying the 


signs and found out they were paid temp agency workers.  


A telephone call to a toll-free number on the Web site for My School, My 


Choice was returned by Mark Weaver, a Columbus lawyer and political 


consultant with Republican ties dating back to the Reagan administration.  


Mr. Weaver said the group's crowning achievement was a 2009 rally 


against legislation in Ohio that would limit school choice. "We put 4,500 


people on the statehouse lawn," he said. But he declined to answer 


questions about the group's leadership and financing."

Case Study: Massachusetts 


"K12's push into New England illustrates its skill. In 2009, the company 


began exploring the potential for opening a virtual school in Massachusetts in 


partnership with the rural Greenfield school district. 


But Massachusetts education officials halted the plan, saying Greenfield had 


no legal authority to create a statewide school. So Greenfield and K12 turned 


to legislators, with the company spending about $200,000 on Beacon Hill 


lobbyists. 


State Rep. Martha "Marty" Walz, a Boston Democrat, wrote legislation that 


allowed Greenfield to open the Massachusetts Virtual Academy in 2010. She 


acknowledged that the language was imperfect and didn't address issues of 


funding or oversight but said she couldn't wait to craft a comprehensive plan. 


"You do what you need to do sometimes to get the ball rolling," said Walz, 


who accepted at least $2,600 in campaign contributions from K12, its 


executives or its lobbyists since 2008, according to the National Institute on 


Money in State Politics. 


That scenario is repeating nationwide as K12 and its allies seek to expand 


virtual education."

Case Study: Idaho 


"In Idaho, K12 donated $44,000 to the re-election of the state's top 


education official, Tom Luna, who pushed through requirements that students 


take online classes to graduate, according to an investigation by The Idaho 


Statesman. Another Idaho paper, The Times-News, found that while state law 


only allowed taxpayer funds to go to schools operated by nonprofits, the state's 


largest virtual school diverted 70 percent of the $9 million it had received from 


the state to its contractor, K12; a smaller virtual school sent 85 percent of its 


$829,000 allocation to its for-profit provider, Connections Education of 


Baltimore, the country's second-largest online education provider. 


"K12 actually gets paid transportation costs in Idaho because they argue 


that since they bring the school to the children they should be paid the same 


as (ordinary) schools," says former Republican state Sen. Gary Schroeder of 


Moscow, who chaired Idaho's education committee for 18 years and 


sponsored that state's 2004 charter school law. "Virtual charter schools are 


organized for the most part by money, and the decision-making process in 


your state will be influenced heavily by education management organizations 


like K12.""

Case Study: Maine 


The key findings of an investigative journalism report that won the 2012 


George Polk Award for Education Reporting were as follows: 


• PULLING THE STRINGS: Maine's digital education agenda is being guided 


behind the scenes by out-of-state companies that stand to profit on the 


changes. 


• FLORIDA CONNECTION: The LePage administration has relied heavily on 


former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's Foundation for Excellence in Education, a 


conservative think tank, in writing policies to create taxpayer-funded virtual 


schools in Maine. 


• FOLLOW THE MONEY: This foundation and its top officials receive funding 


from online education companies, which will profit if the initiatives go forward. 


• REMOTE CONTROL: The foundation wrote much of the language in Gov. 


Paul LePage's Feb. 1 executive order on digital learning, which embraces 


foundation policies. 


• BACKSTAGE MEETINGS: The secretive American Legislative Exchange 


Council -- a corporate-backed political group for state legislators -- developed 


digital learning legislation that was introduced by Maine lawmakers. Stephen 


Bowen (pictured) was a private-sector member until he was appointed 


education commissioner in Maine.

K12 Is Encountering Regulatory 


Problems Across the Country
K-12's Terrible Results in Tennessee Has Led to a 


Political Backlash and Student Enrollment 


Dropping By 2/3 


• "Tennessee Education Commissioner Kevin Huffman declared the 


Tennessee Virtual Academy's results "unacceptable" and demanded "an 


immediate turnaround" 


• "The school also is free to enroll as many students as it would like this 


year. But enrollment appears to be slipping. The Department of Education 


said Friday that the school's current enrollment is 969 students, less than 


one-third its enrollment last school year." 


• "K12 Inc. has asked to open a second school — the Tennessee Cyber 


Academy in neighboring Campbell County. The Department of Education 


last month turned down the application, citing insufficient information."

An Investigation in Florida Revealed K12 Employees 


Covering Up the Illegal Use of Uncertified Teachers, 


and Class Sizes of Up to 275 Students 


-97- 
Source: In K12 Courses, 275 Students to a Single Teacher, Florida Center for Investigative Reporting and StateImpact Florida, 9/16/12. 


"The state Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, prompted by school 


officials in Seminole County, is examining whether K12 uses improperly certified teachers, in 


violation of state law. K12 allegedly asked certified teachers to sign for having taught students 


they never encountered, according to documents that are part of the investigation. 


In a Feb. 15, 2011, email, K12's Samantha Gilormini wrote to certified teachers in Florida: 


"So if you see your name next to a student that might not be yours it's because you were 


qualified to teach that subject and we needed to put your name there." 


Gilormini sent one K12 teacher in Seminole County a roster of more than 100 students. She 


only recognized seven names and refused to sign.  


"I am happy to sign for the seven Seminole students who are my students, but I cannot sign 


as the teacher of record for students who I do not know," Capelle wrote. "It is not ethical to 


submit records to the district that are inaccurate." 


According to a subsequent survey conducted by school officials in Seminole County, only 36 


percent of parents said their child's teacher was the one K12 had listed. (emphasis added) 


Seminole County school officials said the K12 problems uncovered there may exist 


statewide." 


"K12's executive vice president of school services, Chip Hughes, laid out the company's 


class-size formula in a confidential April 2010 memo. 


Under the formula, the more a school district pays, the better the student-teacher ratio. 


School districts that pay $4,000 or more per student receive a 225-to-1 student-teacher ratio 


in high school classes. Districts paying less than $3,000 per student have a 275-to-1 ratio."
In Georgia, K12 Was Caught Using Uncertified 


Teachers, Contrary to State Law 


"The Georgia Department of Education cited the special education 


program of the K12 administered Georgia Cyber Academy for a host of 


violations in June; a letter discussing these issues issued last month is 


here. The letter leaves little doubt that the Department of Education 


means business: If GCA does not fix a host of problems by the end of 


October, steps to revoke the school's charter will begin. 


The issues read like a laundry list of evergreen complaints made 


against K12-run schools: High caseloads, high staff-to-student ratios, FTE 


reporting and questions over compliance with spending IDEA funds. 


In K12's defense, the letter notes that progress has been made in 


improving several areas. Asked for comment about Georgia, K12's 


spokesman said matters are in hand. 
Georgia Cyber Academy (GCA) has been working with a consultant, 


recommended to GCA by the Georgia Department of Education (DOE), for the 


last several months on these issues. That consultant recently filed a report to 


the DOE indicating that the school has taken action to address each issue 


identified by the DOE. The consultant considers the school to be in substantial 


compliance and is awaiting final review and acknowledgement by the DOE."

K12's Difficulties In Colorado 


• State auditors found that the K12-run Colorado Virtual Academy (COVA) 


counted about 120 students for state reimbursement whose enrollment 


could not be verified or who did not meet Colorado residency 


requirements. Some had never logged in. 


• The state audit of COVA, which found that the state paid for students who 


were not attending the school, ordered the reimbursement of more than 


$800,000. 


• In 2011, COVA received "one of the state's two lowest ratings, requiring 


the school to submit an improvement plan for state approval and giving it 


five years to improve or face state sanctions. This rating was revised 


upward, from the lowest rating of Turnaround, with the state's approval." 


• In January 2012, COVA's authorizer nearly closed the school, but instead 


granted a one-year renewal under the condition that COVA find a new 


charter authorizer by June 2014 (emphasis added) 
• "The school's 22 percent graduation rate, high student turnover and questions 


about COVA's management company, K12 Inc., originally led district staff to 


recommend denying the virtual school's multiyear charter application."

K12 Was Denied Online Schools Recently in 


New Jersey, North Carolina and Maine 
Hence, K12 Is Not Opening Schools in Any New States in the Next Year 


• In New Jersey, after giving initial approval in January 2011, in June 


2013 both K12 online charter schools were blocked: 
"The state Department of Education has blocked two virtual charter schools 


from opening this fall that had sought to enroll New Jersey students from 


across the state in courses taught online, Education Commissioner Chris Cerf 


said. 


In letters sent to the Newark and Tinton Falls-based schools earlier this 


week, Cerf cited legal concerns and insufficient evidence that web-based 


school models help students achieve academic success. 


"Uncertainty about the legal foundation for fully virtual charter schools and 


the department's serious concerns regarding its ability to effectively oversee 


and monitor such schools precludes the department from granting (final 


charters)," Cerf wrote in the letters." 


• In North Carolina, the state board of education refused to consider the 


application of K12's North Carolina Virtual Academy in March 2012 and 


in June 2012 a judge upheld this refusal – in effect, a denial 


• In Maine, K12's application to open the Maine Virtual Academy was 


denied in January

Public Policy Recommendations
States Are Making Many Changes That Will Benefit 


Students – But Have Deleterious Consequences for K12 


States are responding to the online charter school sector having run amok by adopting 


one or more of the following changes, none of which are aimed specifically at K12, but all 


of which have deleterious consequences for the company: 
1) A full moratorium on any new cyber charters and/or cap limits on existing ones 


2) Cut funding to cyber charters to levels below that of bricks-and-mortar charters 


3) Improved accountability systems for all public schools (e.g., every school receives an A-F 


grade) 


4) "Default closure provisions" for all charter schools so, for example, if a school is in the bottom 


25% of all charters in the state, it automatically won't get its charter renewed. Or, if a school gets 


an F for two or three consecutive years, it's automatically closed (though there's usually an 


appeals process). This applies to all charter schools, but would disproportionately affect low-


performing online schools like K12's 


5) Improved practices for charter school authorizers, especially getting rid of rogue authorizers 


6) Prevent charters from district/authorizer shopping 


I actually think the most elegant solution would be to let online charters pick and 


choose their students, and then tie a meaningful portion of what they are paid to each 


student's successful completion of a course and demonstrating proficiency/growth. This 


would incent schools to help students succeed and penalize them for enrolling those 


unlikely to succeed. (Note that states would have to change their rules to allow this, as 


most have laws that prevent any charter from being selective.) 


The result would be online charters only serving a small fraction of the students they 


do now – which would be a very good thing. 


-102-
K12 Needs to Do Two Things 


1) Do a better job up front, during the enrollment process, of screening out students 


who are highly likely to fail. Though K12, by law, can't refuse admittance, it can 


adjust its marketing, require in-person meetings with nearly all new students, and 


identify students who have little chance of succeeding – and give parents that 


unvarnished information.  


    The Colorado Virtual Academy implemented these things during recruiting for 


the current school year and the result was the number of new students enrolling 


fell from more than 3,000 to about 900. But the school is now performing much 


better, as evidenced by the fact that 93% of students are actively engaged on a 


daily basis vs. less than 70% last year. This is what needs to happen at every K12 


school. 





2) Once it's clear a student isn't engaging, K12 should be doing everything in its 


power to get the student back into a traditional school. K12 needs to track all of its 


students, carefully measure their engagement, and then act aggressively to deal 


with the ones who aren't engaging. Within a week or two of new students enrolling, 


K12 can begin to measure their engagement. If attempts to engage them fail after, 


say, a month, it's clear that they are never going to engage, so K12 needs to try its 


best to counsel them out.  


   What is not acceptable is what's happening too often today: a student lingers for 


six months or a year and then re-enrolls at their local regular school, far behind. 


-103-
K12 Needs to Not Only Slow Its Growth But 


Actually Shrink Substantially In Order to 


Properly Serve Students and States/Taxpayers 


Perspectives from Jeff Shaw (OHVA) 


I can't see how K12 can get significant increases in student academic growth 


under their current model. They need to say, "Let's not focus on growth – let's first 


get the academics right and then look into growing in a controlled fashion so as not 


to sacrifice student achievement for growth. If student really achieve, the company 


will grow for the right reasons.  


 Why would anyone in their right mind sacrifice student achievement for company 


growth? Those of us at the school level sometimes felt as though Ron Packard was 


charging ahead full speed to grow, grow, grow and not focusing on long-term 


sustainability and student achievement.    


This kind of thinking hurts students. If you enroll students who clearly are not 


appropriate for the virtual school setting, you're doing that student a terrible 


disservice. You have sacrificed a real person for your own economic gain. And I 


think that's immoral and unethical.  


K12's managed schools are public schools. Every student has a right to attend, 


but as education professionals we have a responsibility to see that  students are 


enrolled in a school most appropriate for their needs. In the end, it's the parents and 


students who make the ultimate decision regarding what school they attend. Our 


obligation as professionals is to present them with the realities of virtual schooling 


and how this school choice option may or may not be the best choice. The profit 


motive should not guide this process – but at K12 it appeared to. (emphasis added) 
-104-
K12 Needs to Shrink – Colorado Case Study 


• One of K12's original schools, Colorado Virtual Academy, grew very rapidly after K12 


went public and, consequently, the school's academic results plunged 


• As noted on a previous slide, in January 2012, COVA's authorizer nearly closed the 


school, but instead granted a one-year renewal under several conditions including an 


enrollment cap and a prohibition on no new transfer students into the high school 
• "The school's 22 percent graduation rate, high student turnover and questions about COVA's 


management company, K12 Inc., originally led district staff to recommend denying the virtual 


school's multiyear charter application." 


• In addition, the new leadership of COVA's board, dismayed by K12's focus on growth 


at the expense of academics, is ending its management relationship with K12 after 


this school year 


• The new leadership has done a number of things to improve the school: 
• Gained control of the marketing message to ensure that parents and students understood 


what it takes to succeed at an online school 


• Insisted the K12's telemarketers change their message to one less focused on sales and 


more on describing who would be a good fit for COVA and succeed there 


• Initiated in-person meetings with new students and families to, again, make sure there would 


be a good fit 


• As a result, about 900 new students were approved to enroll at COVA this year vs. 


more than 3,000 the previous year – and current indicators demonstrate a significantly 


higher student engagement than in previous years 
• 93% of students are heavily engaged in daily learning, up from less than 70% last year 


• This is what needs to happen at most K12 schools

K12 Needs to Shrink – Another Colorado 


Case Study 


"One of Colorado's oldest online programs, Branson Online School, is 


also its highest-performing. But to get there, the school had to cut back. 


In 2005, the Branson school district on Colorado's southeastern border 


with New Mexico ran the state's third-largest online school, enrolling more 


than 1,000 students. By 2010, the school had dropped back to sixth in 


size, enrolling 427 students. 


Branson assistant superintendent Judith Stokes, who oversees the 


online school, said the growth and lagging scores – combined with a 


critical 2006 state audit of online programs – prompted the ranching 


community's school board to slow down. 


"We had grown very, very rapidly at one time, before the audit, and at 


that point, we pulled back," she said. 


Stokes said growth slowed when the school focused on ensuring 


families understood the online program before enrolling because, "If 


you're looking for easy, it's not us." 


In spring 2011, Branson online students beat the statewide average in 


proficiency in reading and were six percentage points short in math."

How to Ensure That Only Students Who 


Will Benefit Enroll at Online Schools (1) 


Interview with a friend who's been a charter school authorizer for many years:  


Putting aside K12's performance and recruitment practices, I have actually 


long argued that virtual schools as a whole should not be part of the charter 


sector. The reason for this is really quite simple—charter school enrollment 


structures are not consistent with the pedagogical approach of on-line schools.   


Charter schools by definition are open admissions schools that choose 


students by lottery. In other words, they cannot control the kind or type of student 


who applies to them and is admitted. This means that even if K12 and others did 


not actively recruit students who do not have a parent at home who can 


meaningfully assist them with the on-line curriculum, they would still get many of 


these students who apply and who are admitted. From my conversations with 


folks in Colorado, this happens frequently. And yet it is painfully obvious that an 


on-line curriculum no matter how good is only a good alternative for those 


children who have parents/guardians able to oversee their educational progress, 


particularly in the early grades. Moreover, an on-line school really has no plan B 


with a failing student. It cannot offer a different curriculum, one-on-one tutoring, 


special time with a reading specialist, etc.  in the way that a normal school can. 


As such, failing students are essentially left to rot. 


(continued on next page) 


-107-
How to Ensure That Only Students Who 


Will Benefit Enroll at Online Schools (2) 


(continued) 


This is not to say of course that the on-line approach is not a good one. On-


line schools clearly can work with some students, probably with those students 


who are home-schooled and in which the school itself simply provides a 


curriculum and assessment structure that is helpful to the parent. But it is limited. 


There are clearly kids who don't belong in these programs. But as above, as 


charters, they cannot discriminate and kick out kids who do not belong. 


The solution therefore is to make on-line schools contract directly with the 


state or a district. With that structure, not only can one create a funding 


mechanism that is specific to the costs of providing such a program, but the state 


and district can appropriately control enrollment. For instance, it could and 


probably should limit enrollment to those students who are succeeding in an on-


line program; and it should require those students who chronically are not to 


either dis-enroll or to be provided with additional assistance with more traditional 


forms of learning. Obviously as well you would want to make a student eligible for 


such a school where health or other emotional/social issues make these 


programs the better choice. Yes, there is paternalism in the above and yes there 


is over-riding of parent choice. But given the evidence that I've seen and that 


you've compiled, the present system isn't working. 


Let's have on-line schools but there is no reason why they should be charters.

Conclusions and Catalysts
-110- 


Conclusions and Catalysts 


• K12 is pursuing a growth-at-any-cost strategy that is harming countless students, 


likely violating numerous state laws and regulations, and wasting hundreds of 


millions of dollars of taxpayer money every year. 


• What the company is doing is becoming increasingly well-known so states – and 


possibly the IRS – are waking up and thus the company faces increased scrutiny 


and regulatory risk 


• The likely result is that K12 will not only miss its growth projections (analysts 


project that K12's revenues and profits will grow 16% and 32%, respectively, in the 


next year), but will actually have to shrink substantially in order to properly serve 


students (and states/taxpayers) 


• Possible short-term catalyst: the company could disappoint when it issues FY 


2014 guidance in mid-October and/or when it reports Q1 '14 earnings in early 


November because: 


• Growth has been slowing 


• Preliminary enrollment data at a few schools are weak 


• Analysts seem to be factoring in rising margins and continued growth in 


revenue per student, both of which I think are unlikely 


Trading at nearly 50x trailing earnings, K12's stock is priced for 


perfection, yet its future is likely to be far from perfect

Aggressive Sales Tactics
Jeff Shaw Was Initially Very Positive About K12 


and Said It Was a Good Fit for Certain Students, 


But Screening Was Key 


Additional notes from my interview with Jeff Shaw, Former Head of OHVA 


"I was with K12 for 6½ years from 2003-2010. When I joined K12, I was really excited by the 


school choice and the virtual school option. I loved working for K12. If more public schools 


operated like K12, then our education system would be better. They did a lot of good things. It 


was very data oriented, looking at how kids were doing, and they tried great strategies – more 


sophisticated than other districts I've seen. We had some smart people and the opportunity to 


strategize together.  


I am an educator and I was very sensitive to at-risk students. Bricks-and-mortar schools 


often tried to coach students to choose a virtual school rather than continue to attend their 


school. Also, we had students enrolling in order to hold off truancy charges, suspensions, or 


expulsions from their home schools. These are characteristics of students who are least likely 


to succeed with us.  


An online school isn't right for everybody. I'd have a conversation with families and say 


things like "If you are considering enrolling your son here because he won't get out of bed in 


the morning, he won't succeed here either given virtual learning is one of the least restrictive 


environments of school choice options."  


Helping these families understand why the virtual school isn't a good fit and helping them to 


select a better option is far better for students and gives the virtual academy a fighting chance 


at reaching NCLB academic goals.

Testimony as Part of a Class Action Lawsuit 


Reinforces Shaw's Description of K12's Sales Tactics 


Former sales employees at K12's call centers, located in Virginia and Kentucky, described high 


pressure to make huge enrollment quotas in order to get a commission. Sales employees were 


provided with a "script" of what to say to prospective students and parents, including purported 


"statistics" showing that K12 students were years more advanced than brick-and-mortar school 


students. 


Employee CW1 


CW1 was an enrollment consultant who worked at K12 from April 2010 through September 


2011, reporting to K12's Vice President of Enrollment. CW1 stated that salespeople were paid 


a commission based on the number of students that they enrolled, but explained that the 


commission structure was not typical – rather than payment based on each student enrolled, 


K12's salespeople had to hit a target total dollar figure every quarter in order to make any 


commission. CW1's target was around $400,000 per quarter. If he didn't meet this target, he 


received no commission. CW1 said the sales pitch was very vague and included statistical 


claims that K12 students performed 30% better on standardized tests than students in brick 


and mortar schools across the country, were 1-2 years more advanced, and that that K12 


students had a better chance of going to college. CW1 noted that sales staff had no contact 


with teachers or schools. CW1 observed that "the goals kept going up and [commission] 


payments kept getting lower." In 18 months, CW1 sold approximately $1.5 million worth of 


contracts but was only paid $80,000. CW1 repeatedly asked his supervisors for the underlying 


data for these performance statistics, as he felt it would help him close sales if he were able to 


better explain the statistics to parents, but was never given anything in response.

Employee CW2 


CW2 worked at K12 from 2003 to 2011. CW2, who worked in customer service and 


Sales/Enrollment, described a toxic work environment where sales staff were pressured to meet 


unrealistic quotas, frequently being forced to make as many as 200 outgoing calls daily to keep 


up. CW2 confirmed that sales staff were never given any actual data of student performance, but 


were instead fed statistics from K12's website, and were told to tell parents that students who did 


the K12 program for 1-2 years performed better than their peers at brick and mortar schools. 


Employee CW3 


CW3 worked as an administrator at K12's California Virtual Academy ("CAVA") during the 


Class Period until June 2011…CW3 confirmed that enrollment consultants were paid on 


commission, with their primary goal to enroll as many students as possible...According to CW3, 


the weekly enrollment meetings were "all about numbers," and focused on enrollment projections. 


CW3 stated that a draft enrollment "script," which originated from K12's corporate office, was 


distributed and discussed at several of the enrollment meetings. CW3 described the script as a 


"flow chart," which contained responses to potential questions that parents might ask during a 


sales call. 


According to CW3, "enrollment process requirements would change after the 


school year started." Whereas the "required documents [to] process enrollment" were supposed to 


include the student's most recent report card, transcripts from prior schools, and a "release of 


records" enabling K12 to request the student's records from prior schools, the requirements 


"would change at some point in the year to only require the birth certificate and proof of residence. 


It seemed to depend on where we were in relationship to [enrollment] projections."

Employee CW4 


CW4 worked for K12 from May 2011 through August 2011 as an Enrollment Consultant for 


K12's Colorado and Arizona schools, reporting to Bobby Merchant, a Team Leader. CW4's 


primary responsibility was to contact potential students' parents from a list of "leads" Merchant 


provided to each sales associate daily. CW4 stated that there was constant pressure to generate 


sales, describing the Company's sales philosophy as "enroll, enroll, enroll." As added incentive, 


K12 offered gifts, lunches, and cash bonuses on a weekly basis to the top performing enrollment 


consultants. CW4 confirmed that a script was given to salespeople for use on their calls. 


According to CW4, Erica Scott, an Enrollment Manager, provided consultants with a script 


containing key "verbiage" to use, and various approaches to take with potential customers. 


Although the script also contained statistics comparing K12 schools to "brick and mortar" schools, 


such as graduation rates, CW4 was never provided with underlying data supporting the statistics. 


CW4 stated that enrollment consultants were instructed to refer to the performance of K12 


students as "comparable [to] or even better" than the performance of students at traditional 


schools, and to state that students at K12 schools were "on a better tier" than those at traditional 


schools.

Employee CW6 


CW6 was the Senior Director for School Development from September 2008 through 


September 2009, reporting to Peter Stewart, the Vice President for Business Development. 


According to CW6, when discussing the Company's sales strategy with Peter Stewart 


("Stewart"), Stewart informed him that the K12 curriculum wasn't built for "inner-city kids," but 


instead was geared towards "gifted and talented" students. This struck CW6 as odd because 


the majority of K12 students were inner-city students. CW6 asked his superiors on more than 


one occasion to see data that supported the Company's claims concerning the above-average 


performance of K12 students, but was told that there was no such data. 


According to CW6, K12 targeted inner-city and at-risk populations due to their higher 


potential profit in those areas. CW6 stated that Stewart didn't necessarily agree with this 


practice, but told CW6 "that's what they had to do." According to CW6, Stewart – who routinely 


received orders directly from Packard – was acting on Packard's instructions. 


Employee CW7 


CW7, a former operations manager at one of K12's virtual schools from October 2008 to 


June 2010 whose responsibilities included supervising all enrollment activities, confirmed that 


"habitually truant students drive revenue…and that K12 needs these students or they would 


have to spend a lot more on instruction." In other words, K12 corporate officials knowingly 


enrolled students that would be a bad fit for K12 schools and were likely to drop out, resulting in 


more churn and more instability in enrollments (and, accordingly, revenues), and K12's 


recruitment of inner-city and at-risk "last resort" students had another benefit – these students 


used up less of K12's educational and teaching resources while permitting K12 to collect full 


funding from the states.

Excessive Class Sizes and Harried, 


Overworked, Unsupported Teachers
Additional Notes From a Former Teacher 


at Agora, K12's Largest School 


Additional notes from my interview with a former teacher at Agora 


"When it came time to give grades, if a student had a 10%, we were told to give them a 


minimum of a 35-40% so they could move along to the second marking period, where they were 


given the opportunity to pass. I was told, whatever I had to do, I had to pass every student.  


I was told that if there were students who were not coming to class, but I could reach them by 


phone, I was supposed to provide them with a modified program so they could pass. I once had 


students who, at the end of the semester, decided they wanted to pass, so Agora told me to 


ignore the fact that they'd completed no assignments all semester, give them the end-of-semester 


test, and if they failed, help them pass. 


The majority of students were not at grade level. Some essays were only three sentences – 


that were not grammatically correct. If I told my supervisor, I was told, "That's your problem, do 


whatever you have to do." That was their answer for everything. 


They wanted us to go out and meet the students – go to their homes. That was a nightmare. 


Not everyone lived in a safe area. Requesting to have someone come along was hard – no-one 


was available. So I went to some areas weren't very safe. They said if I was uncomfortable 


(during a visit), I could walk out the door. There was a mix of students – some were wealthy, but 


the majority were not. More were at-risk kids; some were suspensions. 


We had professional development four times during the year (each two days, one night). It 


wasn't really useful or well organized. There were times when we were reprimanded because the 


school hadn't met AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress). It's on the teacher if the school didn't make 


AYP, but the school has never made AYP. They offered us a 10% bonus if more than half of 


students passed, but nobody earned it. It was like a greyhound chasing the rabbit."

Another Teacher Tells a Similar Story 


Melony Black, former K12 English teacher at the Colorado Virtual Academy 


(From article published in The Examiner, 9/5/12) 


"I started the year with 287 students in my seven high school English classes. I was teaching 


three sections of lower-level English students who struggled with reading and writing. 


I asked how I would manage that many students, especially in a school that advertises itself as 


providing individual support. 


The week before the student-count for COVA, K12's marketing department redoubled its efforts; 


and scores of new students enrolled. "Class sizes skyrocketed! We were getting emails daily - 


many of them - listing our new students," Melony said. 


Melony explained, "we were told to hold kids accountable to logging in and working on count-


day." In short order, she adds, "I had over 577 assignments to grade." 


"I was grading essays, journals, response to prompts, resumes and cover letters, threaded 


discussions... I had research papers to grade," Melony explained. "My philosophy did not mesh 


with COVA's," Melony said, describing how she typically worked 60-65 hours per week. 


COVA's leadership downplayed the workload issue, explaining that they predicted one-third of 


the students would drop out before second semester started. "What is sad is that these students 


were supposed to be screened to ensure a good fit for online school", Melony added. 


Whatever screening process K12 uses, it was clearly their intent to enroll as many students as 


possible; with the expectation that significant numbers would drop out mid-year. 


"Three-quarters of my credit recovery kids never logged in, never completed any work, never 


answered their emails or phone calls, yet they remained on my class rosters," she said. "I began 


wondering about the state-mandated hours for students at the high school level. No one is 


monitoring this as far as I can see."

Yet Another Teacher Tells a Similar Story 


Heidi Gardner, former K12 special ed teacher at Agora Cyber Charter 


School 


Heidi Gardner, an Agora special education lead teacher who resigned last 


year, said the turnover in enrollment led to a massive expansion in non-


instruction work for teachers. 


"If you weren't trying to make initial [E-mail or phone] contact with new 


students then you were trying to keep on top of the 'inactive' [students who 


had not logged on to Agora's web portal in a few days] or confirm if students 


who not been in contact with [teachers] for weeks or months were still 


enrolled," Gardner said. "You could add four hours to your work day doing 


this." 


"When it came to the actual instruction, you'd be a secretary, scheduling in 


10 minutes here and there for students who often had complex learning 


challenges. For the harder cases, [teachers] always put in the time and just 


carved it out of our lives."

Jeff Shaw Tells a Similar Story of Excessively Large 


Classes and Overwhelmed Teachers Treated Poorly (1) 


My interview with Jeff Shaw, OHVA 


Student:teacher ratios at the OHVA were higher than what you'd find in 


traditional brick and mortar public schools. When speaking about student:teacher 


ratios, one usually refers to the total number of students an individual teacher 


serves as the "teacher of record" for a subject or courses taught per 


day/week/quarter/semester/year. Since the highest expense for school operations 


in staffing, K12 is very sensitive about teacher ratios being as tight as possible. An 


English teacher for example may have 220 students assigned to him/her at any 


one time. This would constitute a 220:1 student:teacher ratio. Given this high ratio, 


the teacher's ability to provide constructive and meaningful feedback on frequent 


and substantive student writing is very challenging. The same difficulties are 


experienced in math, science, and foreign languages, as well as elective courses 


where student:teacher ratios are significantly higher.  


Hiring decisions were made on a "just-in-time basis." This practice lead to 


teachers having even larger student:teacher ratios for short-term or even long-term 


periods. One significant problem with this practice is that new teachers – those not 


only new to OHVA, but new to virtual teaching – were paired with brand new 


students who had no experience with virtual teachers or learning. It became a 


situation where the efficiency of the learning curve was so compromised it was like 


the blind leading the blind. (continued on next page)

Jeff Shaw Tells a Similar Story of Excessively Large 


Classes and Overwhelmed Teachers Treated Poorly (2) 


My interview with Jeff Shaw, OHVA (continued) 


The teacher pay was pitiful and an embarrassing topic to discuss with potential 


new hires. At one point, it was suggested by upper management that we decrease 


teacher pay 20% and then encourage the teachers to earn (the unknown 20% 


decrease) back as a bonus based on student test scores and teacher effort. This 


was a plan I could not endorse and did not implement at OHVA.  


K12 seemed to have a greater appreciation for people with an MBA than for 


educators with a master's degree or higher. In an education company you would 


think a teacher's value would be considered a priority and they would be 


compensated appropriately. High school graduates were being paid more than 


teachers with master's degrees because they functioned in an 


operational/business capacity rather than an educator. This makes no sense to 


educators and does nothing to attract high quality teachers and sustain teacher 


motivation.

Excessively Large Classes (1) 


"I know on the elementary level we have anywhere from 70 to 100," Ms. Long said. 


"I don't know anyone who has 50 students."  


Some teachers said they were initially attracted to K12 by the flexibility of working 


from home, in some cases allowing them to take care of their own children while 


teaching.  


…But many teachers said the job had become less desirable as the company 


increased enrollment, particularly because pay at many K12 schools starts in the low 


30s — low even for online schools. Some class sizes have become unwieldy, they 


said, requiring 60-hour weeks and compromising instruction.  


At Agora, enrollment has reached 8,836, up from 6,323 in May, according to figures 


released by the school. As of late November, the total number of staff members — 


408 — was lower than last year. Some high school teachers said they were managing 


as many as 270 students, even though they had been told they would have 150. 


Agora officials said last week that they hired 25 teachers in the past couple of weeks.  


Some Agora teachers have been asked to take on extra students at the rate of $1 


per student, per day, according to a newsletter from the Pennsylvania State Education 


Association." (continued on next page)

A New York Times Article Highlights 


Excessively Large Classes (2) 


"In interviews, former teachers at Ohio Virtual Academy and Colorado Virtual 


Academy also complained of bigger class loads, with elementary teachers who once 


handled 40 to 50 pupils now supervising 75. A teacher with an elementary class that 


size and a 40-hour workweek could devote little more than 30 minutes a week to each 


student.  


Mary Ravanelli, a former teacher at Ohio Virtual Academy, said she oversaw more 


than 70 students at a time, answering calls from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., updating parents on 


students' progress and attending various school outings. "We'd actually meet our 


students several times a year," she said.  


With teacher salaries and benefits the biggest cost to K12, increasing student-to-


teacher ratios is an easy way for the company to increase profits. Ms. Henderson, the 


former Agora teacher and mother of four students, said the ultimate losers are the 


children."

Descriptions of K12's Overextended Teachers 


Employee CW8 


CW8 described the student-teacher ratio as "unmanageable," eventually leading to his 


departure from the Company. CW8 stated that at the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year, 


he was responsible for approximately 150-180 students, although some of these students 


ended up withdrawing. Moreover, that ratio was actually the lowest in the Texas Virtual 


Academy – most teachers were responsible for 200-300 students, and one teacher, Joe 


Sullivan, was responsible for over 400 students. 


CW8 suffered "insane" hours and reached out to Mary Gifford, Regional Vice President, 


Central Region at K12. CW8 informed Gifford that the "school is unworkable," and that 


"something needs to be done." Gifford requested that CW8 ask other teachers to participate in 


a conference call regarding the problems. According to CW8, approximately 20 teachers 


participated in the call with CW8 and Gifford. When the teachers raised the issue of teacher-


student ratios, however, Gifford refused to acknowledge that the numbers being provided by 


the teachers were accurate, and quickly "shut down" the discussion.
