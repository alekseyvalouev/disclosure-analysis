Summary


After review of the various rebuttals made by the Nobilis Special Committee in
relation to my original post, I have updated one point as set forth below.


The note below provides updated details on selected insider shareholder changes.


Please see commentary below.


After review of the various rebuttals made by the Nobilis Special Committee in relation to
my original post, I have updated one point as set forth below. As noted by the special
committee on Nov 3, 2015 (source), my original table contemplated the change in select
insiders' share counts from December 31, 2014 to the date of the initial article (October 9,
2015). My original post used information from pages 62 and 63 of the company's
December 31, 2014 Management Information Circular (source) which resulted in my
including derivatives in the December 31, 2014 numbers - I regret the error. The below
table has been updated to account for the change in shares from December 31, 2014 until
the day of this posting using sedi filings and appropriately reflects only shares held.


The updated chart implies that insiders have sold approximately $35 million of stock. Chris
Lloyd and other Athas owners would also have been paid gross $3 million in cash (on
closing) plus gross $12 million in debt (which was later paid in cash using the debt issued
to GE Capital; for a total of $15 million in cash - source). Total insiders thus likely received
gross proceeds of $50 million (as opposed to the $65 million that was stated in the initial

Nobilis Sues Anson Funds and Anson Analyst Sunny Puri for $300 Million 
HOUSTON, TX--(Marketwired - Nov 5, 2015) - Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSE MKT: HLTH) (TSX: NHC) ("Nobilis" or the
"Company") announced today that it has filed suit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Sunny Puri, Anson
Canada, Anson LP, Anson Capital, Anson Investment Fund, and Anson Catalyst Fund, along with John Does 1
through 20. The claim alleges that these individuals perpetrated a scheme to damage Nobilis' reputation and business

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3670356-nobilis-fall-nobility-original-post-update 4/9


relationships in order to profit through short-selling of Nobilis stock. Nobilis is seeking monetary damages in excess of
$300,000,000 along with punitive damages. Nobilis expects to add more Anson affiliates and other participants in the
scheme as defendants.


The complaint specifically alleges that the Anson family of hedge funds and associated-individuals devised and
participated in a "short attack" scheme against the Plaintiff, Nobilis Health Corp., in which the defendants broadcast
false and defamatory information about Nobilis in order to drive down the price of Nobilis' publicly traded stock (the
"Nobilis Common Stock") so that the defendants could profit from short positions they had taken in Nobilis Common
Stock and derivative securities thereof. The key to the scheme was the written attack (the "Article") on Nobilis'
business which the defendants prepared and anonymously posted under the pseudonym "The Emperor Has No
Clothes" to the website "Seeking Alpha" (http://bit.ly/89UJPz) ("Seeking Alpha"). The Article made numerous
statements of purported "fact" about Nobilis' business that were false and defamatory, including allegations that the
Company's auditors resigned amid controversy (untrue), CFOs had been shuffled to hide impropriety (untrue),
insiders had sold all of their Nobilis Common Stock (untrue), that the Company was hiding poor performance behind
acquisitions (untrue), that major insurers would not pay for certain medical procedures billed by Nobilis (untrue), and
several other false, defamatory and misleading statements.


Nobilis Common Stock traded at $6.81 at the open of trading on Toronto Stock Exchange on October 9, 2015 -- the
day the Article was broadcast. At close that day the price was $4.93. Over the next two weeks Nobilis Common Stock
continued trading downward to a low of $2.83, a drop of approximately 60% from price at the open of trading on
October 9, 2015. That decline translates to a loss of over $300,000,000 million in market capitalization.


Nobilis believes it is entitled to damages for reputational harm, disruption of its business and affairs, loss of corporate
opportunities, costs of investigating and correcting the false and defamatory statements, costs of defending against
investor litigation initiated as a result of the false and defamatory information, and other consequential damages
resulting from the defendants' scheme and market manipulation.


The case is Nobilis Health Corp. v. Sunny Puri, M5V Advisors, Inc (c.o.b. as Anson Group Canada), Admiralty
Advisors, LLC, Frigate Ventures, LP, Anson Investments LP, Anson Capital, LC, Anson Investments Master Fund, LP,
AIMF, GP, Anson Catalyst Master Fund, LP, ACF GP, and John Does 1 through 20, Court File No. CV-15-11162-0000,
Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Nobilis management is in discussions with US-based counsel regarding the
Company's legal recourse against parties located in the United States.

Independent investigation finds SA blogger posted FALSE report


independent counsel Robert Hopper and Lanny Davis,


After examining all of the blogger's allegations, including the five primary ones above, we have determined that the
allegations are false, misleading, or without foundation. Moreover, given that we find other allegations are false or
misleading, based upon all statements taken, all supporting documents reviewed and, on the face of the company's
securities filings, we find the blogger is not credible


http://bit.ly/1kAKPfz

1. Acquisition Versus Non-Acquisition Growth


Blogger: "Roll ups have a recurring pattern of being bad stock market investments. The strategy sounds
appealing to investors as an acquiring entity goes out picking up businesses and putting them together with
the promise of significant synergies and cost reductions. Investment banks and their analysts love roll ups as
well, as the constant stream of acquisitions provide continuing opportunities for transaction advisory and
financings related to paying for them, both of which all add up to rich fees. For investors, roll ups are not
nearly as attractive. Acquisitions give the impression of growth, even if the actual businesses are not growing,
or even in decline."


Here and elsewhere, the blogger implicitly asserts that Nobilis's revenue growth is the product of acquisitions,
and that Nobilis's business is not otherwise growing. This assertion is false. We reviewed corporate earnings
and the source thereof, for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014. A substantial portion of Nobilis's growth in
revenues in 2014 came not through acquiring revenue, but from management's effort to build revenues
through pre-existing and acquired assets.


The data from the company's public securities filings are clear:


From FY 2013(1) to FY 2014, Nobilis's revenues grew from $31.1 million to $84 million -- a growth of $52.9
million in one year, or 170%; and 
Nobilis's two material acquisitions in 2014 -- First Nobilis Hospital and Surgery Center and Athas Health, LLC
-- contributed a total of $15.6 to 2014 revenue.(2) 
Therefore, of the total of $52.9 million in 2014 revenue growth(3), 70.5% was attributable to growth of pre-
existing facilities or management's strategic efforts to improve the growth at acquired facilities.

2. Insurance Coverage of AccuraScope Procedures


Blogger: "From what I have found, most of the big insurance companies do not cover AccuraScope or similar
minimally invasive spine surgeries...One part of the excitement surrounding Nobilis' stock relates to growing
the mix of in-network surgeries, but this is odd, given insurance already appears to be skeptical of the
surgery...Per my review, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and Humana do not insure AccuraScope or similar
procedures; so, who exactly is insuring this? How is it being put through insurance? Is there risk of not being
paid by insurers?"


The blogger's assertions are false and misleading. "AccuraScope" is a brand label encompassing multiple,
specific spinal procedures, each of which has its own independent "CPT" code. Aetna, Blue Cross, Anthem,
Humana, and virtually all health insurance companies pay claims submitted under these codes.(4) Indeed, of
Nobilis's $84 million in total revenue in 2014, 88.5% ($74.4 million) came from private insurance and other
third-party payers (with a small amount coming from Medicare).


16 Nov 2015, 04:01 PM

5. Auditor and CFO Changes


Blogger: "And of all the accounting firms to audit that complexity, which one did Nobilis pick? None other than
tiny Calvetti Ferguson, with a total of 38 professionals. Barely more than the number of entities it audited at
Nobilis. And the company's CFO situation inspires no more confidence. Since 2010, Nobilis has changed
CFOs four times (Source: Bloomberg, Company Filings). In August, Calvetti resigned as auditor. This follows
closely after the last CFO change in July. A new CFO and a new auditor are now charged with figuring out all
the complicated arrangement and deals built up over the years. While this does not guarantee that any
problems will be found, it definitely increases the uncertainty."


These assertions are misleading as they imply something imprudent or improper about the replacement of
Nobilis's auditor and the hiring of more experienced CFOs. As Nobilis explained in its securities filings, the
regional firm Calvetti Ferguson and Wagner resigned at Nobilis's request as the company's Auditor so that
Nobilis could have an Auditor with expertise more suitable for the company's growth. Thus, Nobilis retained
the national firm, Crowe Horwath as its new outside Auditor.


Similarly, Nobilis has hired new CFOs as the company's growth has required greater expertise. All but one of
the former CFOs all still work with Nobilis in other capacities.(9)

If someone is long they should not be allow to write either, right? It's a conflict of interest to own something
and then write something positive about it.

Consider the motive behind anyone posting negative comments about a company, particularly those making multiple
comments. Then consider this particular company has had some issues. Then consider there is a pretty substantial
short interest looking to profit off the doubts they attempt/hope to instill in INVESTORS minds. Then ask yourself why
would I pay attention to anything they had to say? Tune out the BS, do your due diligence. reap the rewards. Enough
said...carry on....
