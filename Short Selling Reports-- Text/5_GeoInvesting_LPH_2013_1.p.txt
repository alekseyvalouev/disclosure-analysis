ON-THE-GROUND DUE DILIGENCE & 


INVESTIGATORY REPORT 


on 


LONGWEI PETROLEUM 


(NYSE:LPH)

Longwei Petroleum: The Most Brazen China-Based U.S. Listed RTO Fraud to Date 


Since 2010, Geoinvesting.com has helped investors navigate the U.S. Listed Chinese company universe 


(ChinaHybrids)  that has proven to be full of companies actively engaged in deceiving investors.  As 


investors read our exposé on Longwei Petroleum Investment Holding Limited (NYSE: LPH)  today they 


need to realize that our due diligence process employed similar tools, such as video surveillance of 


operations, recorded interviews, and SAIC filing analysis that directly led to the halt and eventual 


delisting of numerous ChinaHybrids.  Our exposure of the fraud perpetrated by Puda Coal (PUDA) and 


Yuhe (YUII) was ground breaking in that both managements actually admitted their deceit.  Likewise, 


Alfred Little’s report on China Integrated Energy (CBEH) was the first to use video surveillance to prove 


fraud.  Today’s report on LPH combines these approaches and allows us to make our strongest 


conclusion of fraud to date.  The choice investors are left to make is very simple: Do I hold onto LPH and 


wait for the rhetoric that its management and its fee collectors will spout or do I sell out prior to what 


we believe is the inevitable trading halt and delisting, trusting in Geoinvesting’s due diligence and track 


record? The choice is yours and yours alone to make.  We have made ours.  


Longwei is reportedly engaged in the wholesale distribution of finished petroleum products in the 


People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).   LPH’s headquarters are located in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, 


adjacent to and overlooking its Taiyuan fuel storage facility.  LPH has a reported fuel storage capacity of 


220,000 metric tons located at three storage facilities within Shanxi: Taiyuan, Gujiao and Huajie, which it 


claims have individual storage capacities of approximately 50,000 metric tons (“mt”), 70,000mt, and 


100,000mt, respectively.  Unfortunately for owners of LPH stock, we have determined that the 


company’s purported business operations are massively overstated and a brazen fraud, on an order of 


magnitude unmatched before by any China based companies we have seen.  Furthermore, we have no 


faith in LPH’s auditor, Anderson Bradshaw. This is because the firm’s head of quality control, Russell 


Anderson, was the audit partner of YUII while he worked at Child, Van, Wagoner & Bradshaw.  Russell 


failed to detect the massive YUII fraud we uncovered and did not resign until the YUII Chairman 


admitted fraud 5 days after we exposed them. Our exposé led to YUII’s delisting.  LPH stock in our 


opinion is virtually worthless, completely un-investable and should be immediately delisted by the 


New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We are sending all of our evidence to the NYSE and other securities 


regulators, just as we have done in prior cases. 


Contents 


Part I – Wholesale Fuel Sales Are Virtually Nonexistent 


1. 7 weeks (October 26 to December 13, 2012) of 24/7 time-lapse video surveillance of LPH’s 


Taiyuan and Gujiao fuel storage depots detected only 5 tanker trucks fueling at the two 


facilities, combined. 


2. In recent press releases and 8-K filings, LPH exaggerated its main Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities’ 


November 2012 sales by a factor of over 800 times.
3. In October 2012, prior to conducting our video surveillance, we discovered that the railroad 


spurs to the Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities were covered with vegetation and appeared unused in 


quite some time. 


4. Locals that we interviewed said that LPH’s business had been bad for a long time.  We were told 


that the Gujiao facility had been almost completely idled since 2011, when it began losing 


money on fuel it sold due to unstable fuel prices since 2011.  


5. From December 9 to 22, 2012, we conducted 13 days of 24/7 time-lapse video surveillance of 


the newly opened Huajie fuel storage depot and detected zero tanker trucks being fueled at the 


facility. 


6. CFO Mike Toups, by simply looking out of the Taiyuan office windows at the nearly idled tanker 


fueling station next door should have easily detected and prevented LPH’s brazen fraud given 


the amount of time he claims to spend at the facility. 


Part II – Legal Issues Abound 


1. LPH never disclosed an investment of $32 million (out of a total commitment of $222 million) in 


a Tourism business made by its subsidiary Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Co., Ltd. 


(“Zhonghe”). 


2. LPH has eerie ties to Ming Zhao and Puda Coal Group (“PUDA”) through its Zhonghe and Huajie 


facility acquisitions.  Investors may remember that Ming Zhao was the mastermind behind the 


massive PUDA fraud  that the GeoTeam uncovered - a fraud which Ming Zhao tried to conceal 


with a bogus private takeover offer of $12.00 per share while the stock was halted.  


3. LPH’s minority interests in Taiyuan Longwei, owned by Mr. Cai Yongjun, are not reflected in its 


balance sheet as non-controlling interests.  


4. In its 2011 10K, LPH claimed that Shanxi Heitan Zhingyou Petrochemical Co., Ltd (“Zhingyou”) 


was an operating subsidiary that had income tax due during the financial year ending June 30, 


2011. However, in its 2012 10-K, LPH claimed that Zhingyou was a non-operating subsidiary in 


the financial year ended June 30, 2012 and did not have income tax due on June 30, 2011.   


5. The disclosed SAT/SAIC file by LPH on June 29, 2012 for the calendar year 2011 claimed that 


only Taiyuan Longwei Economic & Trade Co., Ltd. generated revenue and paid income tax and 


VAT tax.  This contradicts the annual report (SEC) for the financial year ended on June 30, 2011 


during which Zhingyou was still the operating subsidiary for the Gujiao facility.   


Part I – Wholesale Fuel Sales are Virtually Nonexistent 


1.  Seven (7) weeks (October 26 to December 13, 2012) of 24/7 time-lapse video surveillance of LPH’s 


Taiyuan and Gujiao fuel storage depots detected only 5 tanker trucks fueling at the two facilities, 


combined. 


Seven weeks (October 26 to December 13, 2012) of 24/7 time-lapse video surveillance of LPH’s Taiyuan 


and Gujiao fuel storage depots detected only 5 tanker trucks fueling at the two facilities, combined. 


For 49 consecutive days, from October 26 to December 13, 2012, we performed uninterrupted 24/7 


time-lapse video surveillance of LPH’s Taiyuan and Gujiao fuel storage depots, which together accounted 



http://www.slideshare.net/GeoTeam/puda-coal-investigatory-report-probe-into-corporate-structure-and-ownership
for 96% of LPH’s total sales in the last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012.   What we discovered 


was shocking.  During this entire period we only saw only 5 tanker trucks fueling at the two facilities, 


combined. 


Taiyuan Facility 


The following satellite overview image of the Taiyuan facility is marked showing the location and field of 


view of our cameras: 





As shown in the overview image above, Camera 1 had a clear view of the Retail Gas Station, Tanker 


Fueling Entrance and a partial view of the Tanker Fueling Station.  Camera 2 had a clear view of LPH’s 


corporate Office Entrance adjacent to the Taiyuan facility. 


A comparison of our overview image with the following image from page 5 of LPH’s October 11, 2012 


RedChip PowerPoint presentation confirms that we had our Camera 1 aimed at the Tanker Fueling 


Station (labeled “Control Center” in LPH’s image): 



http://blog.geoinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LPH-Redchip-10.11.12-PPT.pdf
The following photo of the entrance to LPH’s corporate office (where CFO Mike Toups claims to spend 


half the year working) was taken from our Camera 2 on December 2, 2012:
LPH’s corporate office is the building pictured on the right (with the flags on the roof).  


The following photos of the Taiyuan Tanker Fueling Entrance and Station were taken from our Camera 1 


on October 26, 2012, showing the only tanker truck we ever saw fueling during the 49 days we filmed 


the Taiyuan facility.  The tanker truck entered the Taiyuan facility at 2:04pm and departed at 3:28pm, as 


shown below:
The Tanker Fueling Station is located just behind the small retail gas station pictured above in the 


foreground (see the red taxi fueling).  The Tanker Fueling Entrance is a gate shown on the right side of 


the pictures above.  There is also an access gate on the left side of the retail gas station (pictured above) 


but during the course of our surveillance it appeared to be rarely, if ever, used.  We observed a small 


amount of business at the retail gas station from locals during the daytime, limited by the poor location 


and the fact that the station offers only 90-octane gasoline and diesel fuel.  We generously estimate that 


the average daily fuel sales at the retail station should not exceed 10 metric tons. 


You can view 3 of our time-lapse surveillance videos of LPH’s Taiyuan Tanker Fueling Station filmed 


from our Camera 1 at the following links: 


 October 29, 2012 


 November 13, 2012 


 November 27, 2012 


We are sending the other 46 days’ videos from our Camera 1 as well as the videos from our Camera 2 to 


the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC Office of the Whistleblower. 


Gujiao Facility 


The following satellite overview image of the Gujiao facility is marked showing the location of our two 


cameras:

https://vimeo.com/56565319
As shown in the overview image above, Camera 1 had unobstructed views of the Gujiao Tanker Fueling 


Station and the Tanker Fueling Entrance.  Camera 2 had an unobstructed view of the Weighing Station 


and a partial view of the Rail Spur. 


A comparison of our overview image with the following image from page 6 of LPH’s October 11, 2012 


RedChip PowerPoint presentation confirms that we had our camera aimed at the Tanker Fueling Station 


(labeled “Control Center” in LPH’s image): 



http://blog.geoinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LPH-Redchip-10.11.12-PPT.pdf
The following are images of the Gujiao Tanker Fueling Station taken from Camera 1 on November 27, 


2012, showing one of only four tanker trucks we ever saw fueling during the 49 days we photographed 


the Gujiao facility (the other three tanker trucks showed up on October 29, November 13, and 


December 6, 2012):
As shown above, the tanker truck fueled at the Tanker Fueling Station of the Gujiao facility from around 


2:14pm to 2:26pm.  Before and after fueling, the tanker truck was weighed at the Gujiao Weighing 


Station, photographed by our Camera 2 as shown below:
You can view 3 of our time-lapse surveillance videos of LPH’s Gujiao Tanker Fueling Station filmed 


from our Camera 1 at the following links: 


 October 29, 2012 


 November 13, 2012 


 November 27, 2012 


The dates of these three videos coincide with the dates of the Taiyuan Tanker Fueling Station videos we 


shared.  Three of the four tanker trucks that fueled at the Gujiao facility during the 7 weeks of our 


surveillance can be seen in these surveillance videos.  We are sending the other 46 days’ videos from 


our Camera 1 as well as the videos from our Camera 2 to the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC 


Office of the Whistleblower. 


2.  In recent press releases and 8-K filings, LPH exaggerated its main Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities’ 


November 2012 sales by a factor of over 800 times. 


During the month of November 2012, our time-lapse video surveillance filmed only 2 tanker trucks 


fueling at the Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities, combined.  For all practical purposes the Taiyuan and Gujiao 


facilities were nearly idle, with minimal sales coming from the small retail gas station selling fuel to 


locals in front of the Taiyuan Tanker Fueling Station.   


The following table compares LPH’s reported combined November sales at its Taiyuan and Gujiao 


facilities to the bleak reality we filmed as part of our on-the-ground due diligence of LPH:

Inflated product sales factor  882x   





As shown above, by our estimates LPH brazenly inflated its November Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities’ 


combined product sales by over 800 times.  In our recollection, no other China-based U.S. Listed RTO 


has ever inflated its sales performance this much.  (Note: Even if we include the maximum possible fuel 


sold by the small Taiyuan retail gas station (10mt x 30 days = 300mt) into our calculations, LPH still 


inflated its combined Taiyuan and Gujiao fuel sales by 875x.) 


Therefore we have to seriously question LPH’s CFO Mike Toup’s claims he makes 10 minutes 30 seconds 


into this May 2011 RedChip promotional video interview, where he states that:  


“We’ve got anywhere from 50-60 trucks coming through [the Taiyuan facility] on a daily basis…”  


RedChip CEO Dave Gentry then steps in front of the camera and states:  


“So 50-60 trucks are coming through here per day…”

http://www.redchip.com/visibility/video/displayClientVideoflashMainTemplate.asp?videoUID=151
In the RedChip promotional video, there were at least a dozen trucks driving around inside the Taiyuan 


and Gujiao Tanker Fueling Stations.  However, during our 49 consecutive days we filmed the two 


facilities, there were only 5 tanker trucks, combined.  The RedChip promotional video sounds a lot like 


the March 2011 staged investor tour conducted by China Integrated Energy (“CBEH”), a fraud busted by 


Alfredlittle.com and delisted to the Pink Sheets after its auditor, KPMG, resigned in April 2011.   


LPH and RedChip made their promotional video in response to the CBEH debacle to try to convince 


investors that its Taiyuan and Gujiao fueling businesses were real.  In fact, at 25 minutes into the 


promotional video RedChip CEO Dave Gentry points out that CBEH was halted from trading and under 


SEC investigation for potential fraud after investors filmed its facility for four months and determined 


that the flow of trucks did not match the revenue and earnings that the company was reporting.  Mr. 


Gentry then asks LPH CFO Mike Toups:  


“To what extent have you verified what we’re seeing on the ground what we’re told in the 


financials is accurate?”  


Mr. Toups replies: 


“Dave, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time here in Taiyuan City working with the company, 


working with the management.  I’ve really rolled up my sleeves in terms of understanding the 


financials…”
Mr. Toups then announces that LPH would set up webcams on its new website so investors could view 


the facilities and see the tanker trucks fueling.  Nine months later, after repeatedly making excuses for 


delays installing the live webcams, Mr. Toups (on page 15 of LPH’s Q2 2012 earnings conference call 


transcript dated February 10, 2012) announced that the webcam project failed because “The Company 


deals with several sensitive industries in terms of some of the customers that we serve, the military or 


military-related customers, so we have not been able to come out through the Chinese firewall with the 


webcams or any type of a live feed.”   


Our video surveillance proves that CFO Mike Toups’ claim of 50-60 trucks per day fueling at LPH’s 


Taiyuan facility is an outrageous exaggeration that Mr. Toups should be well aware of every time he 


visited the nearly idle Taiyuan facility.  The real reason LPH never installed the webcams is because they 


have no business to film, as we observed during our 7 weeks of time-lapse video surveillance.  LPH is 


defrauding its investors, just like China Integrated Energy, only on an even larger scale. 


3.  In October 2012, prior to conducting our video surveillance, we discovered that the railroad spurs 


to the Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities were covered with vegetation and appeared unused in quite some 


time. 


LPH claims its Taiyuan facility is supplied with fuel by rail.  However, our initial site visit in October 2012 


found that the railroad tracks outside of the gate leading to Taiyuan facility were covered with 


vegetation as shown below: 



http://blog.geoinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LPH-Q2-2012-earnings-call-transcript-2.10.12.pdf

http://blog.geoinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LPH-Q2-2012-earnings-call-transcript-2.10.12.pdf
These vegetation covered tracks are hardly indicative of the thriving business LPH claims to operate out 


of the Taiyuan facility.  Our photos paint a very different story than the photos on the LPH and RedChip 


websites showing only the railcar fueling terminals inside the facility. 


Just like the Taiyuan facility, it appears the Gujiao facility had not been supplied with any fuel by rail in 


quite some time, as shown by our October photos of the railroad tracks leading to the Gujiao facility: 





In this case, the vegetation has overgrown the tracks just inside of the railroad gate leading to the Gujiao 


railcar fueling terminal.   


We conclude that for some time prior to our surveillance, neither the Taiyuan nor Gujiao facilities were 


being supplied with any material quantities of fuel. 


4.  Locals that we interviewed said that LPH’s business had been bad for a long time.  We were told 


that the Gujiao facility had been almost completely idled since 2011, when it began losing money on 


fuel it sold due to unstable fuel prices since 2011.
We spoke with several locals who were knowledgeable about LPH’s recent business condition.   Our key 


findings were: 


 The Gujiao facility has been losing money and has been virtually idle since 2011 


 The Gujiao facility storage tanks are empty 


 The Taiyuan facility wholesale business is likewise virtually idle for a long time 


 The Taiyuan small retail gas station does more business than the Taiyuan wholesale business 


We recorded all of our interviews and are sharing them with the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC 


Office of the Whistleblower.  To protect those filmed in the interviews we will not publish the interviews 


in this report.  Retaliation by Chinese companies against whistleblowers has been well documented by 


the media (for one example, check out www.publiccompanyprisoner.org) 


5.  From December 9 to 22, 2012, we conducted 13 days of 24/7 time-lapse video surveillance of the 


newly opened Huajie fuel storage depot and detected zero tanker trucks being fueled at the facility. 


From December 9 to 22, 2012, after discovering that LPH’s Taiyuan and Gujiao facilities were almost 


completely idled, we decided to film LPH’s newly opened Huajie facility, performing 13 days of 24/7 


time-lapse video surveillance.   Once again we were shocked.  We saw absolutely zero tanker trucks 


fueling at the Huajie facility. 


The following image of the Huajie facility copied from LPH’s website is marked showing the location of 


our camera: 


 



http://www.publiccompanyprisoner.org/
Our camera was placed in the field between the Tanker Fueling Entrance and the regional rail station 


(shown in the distance).  We had an unobstructed view of the Gujiao Tanker Fueling Entrance and 


Tanker Fueling Station (as well as scores of amusing goats) as shown in the following sample photo: 





You can view one time-lapse surveillance video of LPH’s Huajie facility at the following link: 


 December 11, 2012 


We are sending the other 12 days’ videos of the Huajie facility to the New York Stock Exchange and the 


SEC Office of the Whistleblower. 


To recap, all of the videos referenced above can be seen together here. 


Conclusion Regarding Fuel Storage Facilities 


LPH’s business at its 3 fuel storage facilities is in reality almost nonexistent, very likely since 2011, in 


sharp contrast to its recent press releases touting record October and November sales.  In fact, based on 


our experience uncovering numerous frauds, LPH’s recently reported sales are the most exaggerated 


by any China based company we have seen to date. 


6. CFO Mike Toups, by simply looking out of the Taiyuan office windows at the nearly idled tanker 


fueling station next door should have easily detected and prevented LPH’s brazen fraud given the 


amount of time he claims to spend at the facility. 



https://vimeo.com/56565320

http://vimeopro.com/user15483410/lph-facility-entrances
LPH CFO Mike Toups has repeatedly told investors that he spends half the year in China, at LPH’s 


corporate office adjacent to the Taiyuan tanker fueling station.  If Mr. Toups has been telling the truth 


about the amount of time he spends at the Taiyuan facility, then he could not possibly be unaware of 


the fact that the Taiyuan facility is nearly idled. 


Mr. Toups claims to have over 12 years of experience with Asia-based companies.  His experience as a 


director of Lotus Pharmaceuticals (LTUS – now $0.01/share) and interim CFO of Worldwide Energy and 


Manufacturing (WEMU – no longer trades due to the SEC revoking registration), both companies that 


were also clients of RedChip, should make him painfully aware of the prevalence of fraud in China.   


Likewise, his participation in LPH’s investor relations response to the collapse of China Integrated Energy 


(CBEH – delisted), including his participation in the RedChip “documentary” showing how LPH was 


better than CBEH indicates that either Mr. Toups was aware and a part of LPH’s fraud, or else he has 


seriously exaggerated the amount of time and attention he has paid to LPH’s business operation.  Based 


on our research we are inclined to conclude that Mr. Toups is at best a very negligent CFO who seriously 


misled investors to believe that LPH was operating a meaningful business.  


Part II – Legal Issues Abound 


1.  LPH Did Not Disclose A RMB 200 Million (USD 32 Million) Investment In A Tourism Business By Its 


Subsidiary, Zhonghe. 


We learned that the Chairman of LPH, Cai Yongjun and Zhonghe, a claimed non-operating LPH 


subsidiary, own 10% and 90% respectively of a tourism project called Shengjing Mountain Tourism 


District, in Wendeng City, Shandong province.  Shandong Jinriyue Tourism Development Co., Ltd. 


(“Jinriyue Tourism”), established in October 2009, was the company developing and managing the 


project. LPH never disclosed any details regarding its involvement in the project.  Based on public 


information in China, as of November 2011, Zhonghe invested more than RMB 200 million (USD 32 


million) in this tourism project and even planned to invest as much as RMB 1.4 billion (USD 222 million).    


Here is some information published on the Shengjing Mountain project’s website, regarding Zhonghe’s 


tourism business: 


Excerpt 1: 





August, 2009, Wendeng City intensified its investment promotion efforts.  Shanxi Zhonghe 


Energy Conversion Ltd. [LPH subsidiary] obtained the Shengjing Mountain tourism district 


development rights by virtue of its strong financial capacity.  Shandong Jinriyue Tourism 


Development Co., Ltd. was established in October 2009 as the direct developer and 


manager of Shengjing Mountain tourism district.   



http://geoinvesting.com/companies/wemu_worldwide_energy/research

http://www.shengjingshanjingqu.com/news_detail.aspx?news_id=327
Excerpt 2: 








 “The project has a total planned investment of RMB 1.4 billion from Shanxi Zhonghe Energy 


Conversion Ltd. [an investor] who is responsible for [funding the project’s] development 


and construction…” 


“… At present, more than RMB 200 million has been invested [not disclosed in SEC 


documents] in the attractions and supporting projects under construction [that are to] be 


open to the public before November [2011].” 


We also found some pictures where Mr. Cai Yongjun (LPH Chairman) is “escorting” local government 


officials around the project site. 


Cai Yongjun’s picture on the tourism business site:

http://www.shengjingshanjingqu.com/news_detail.aspx?news_id=64

http://www.shengjingshanjingqu.com/news_detail.aspx?news_id=346
We also pulled the SAIC file of Jinriyue Tourism, in which the shareholder information is disclosed as 


follows:
Our research raises the following questions:  


1. Why didn’t LPH disclose its large investment in a tourism business, which is 90% owned by 


Zhonghe, LPH’s subsidiary? 


2. Where did the money invested in the tourism business come from?  


2.  LPH’s Huajie Acquisition Seems to Have Eerie Ties to PUDA and Its Chairman Ming Zhao 


Longwei completed an Asset Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of the assets of Huajie Petroleum 


Co., Ltd. (“Huajie”) on September 26, 2012.  On September 27, 2012 LPH announced that it paid RMB 


700 million (approximately USD 110.6 million) for the assets.  


“The Assets purchased from Huajie consist of fuel storage tanks with 100,000 metric ton 


capacity with accessory facilities and equipment, delivery and distribution platforms, including a 


dedicated rail spur and a vehicle loading and unloading station.  The purchase also includes a 


3,000 square meter office building and land use rights for approximately 98 acres of land 


adjacent to the main regional rail line.” (8-K, September 26, 2012) 


LPH also disclosed that the assets were non-operational with no historical revenue.

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1111817/000101376212001881/form8k.htm
As shown above, Li Qi is the legal representative of Huajie Petroleum Co., Ltd. (“Huajie”) and signed the 


Asset Purchase Agreement with Taiyuan Longwei, the operating entity of LPH.  However, our further 


research disclosed that… 


 Li Qi, 


 LPH, 


 Cai Yongjun, LPH’s chairman, and  


 Ming Zhao, PUDA’s chairman  


…are closely tied to one another as shown in the following diagram: 





Notes:  


- (0) Cai Yongjun is LPH’s chairman.  


- (1) Zhonghe is a LPH’s subsidiary. 


- (2) Zhonghe and Li Qi (6) jointly owned Lvhai which King Stone Energy (8) planned to acquire. 


- (3) Zhonghe, LPH’s subsidiary, and Lanxing which is jointly owned by Cai Yongjun (4) and Li Qi (7), share 


the same address. 


- (5) LPH acquired Huajie, whose legal representative is Li Qi (9). And whose shareholder is Langqian 


(Jiangtong) (10). 


- (11) Langqian (Jiangtong) and King Stone Energy has a joint venture.   



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1111817/000101376212001881/ex101.pdf
- (12) and (13) Ming Zhao controlled King Stone Energy and PUDA. 


The details of the relationships are explained as follows:  


a. Li Qi and Cai Yongjun jointly own a company with the same disclosed address as Zhonghe.   Li 


Qi and Cai Yongjun jointly established a company called Shanxi Lanxing Xintong Science & 


Trading Co., Ltd. (“Lanxing”) on July 27, 2010, as follows:
In the Tax reconsolidation report provided by LPH on June 29, 2012, Zhonghe carries the same address 


as Lanxing as follows:
b. Li Qi and Zhonghe, a subsidiary of LPH, jointly owned a company called Shanxi Lvhai Mining 


Co., Ltd., which was eventually acquired by Hong Kong publicly traded King Stone Energy 


Group Limited (0663 HK) (“King Stone Energy”), a company controlled by Ming Zhao, PUDA’s 


chairman.  





On February 9, 2011, King Stone Energy made a disclosure regarding its acquisition of Shanxi 


Lvhai Mining Co., Ltd. including the following information:  





“The company (“Shanxi Lvhai Mining Co., Ltd.”) was established as a limited liability 


company in the PRC on 13 October 1997 with registered and paid-in capital of 


RMB1,000,000. Since then, [LPH subsidiary] Shanxi Zhong He Neng Hua Company 


Limited (‘‘Shanxi Zhong He’’) (Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Co., Ltd.) held a 90% 


equity interest in  LPH, and Mr. Wei Yong held a 10% equity interest in the company.  





After two equity transfers transactions in August 2008 and July 2009, respectively, the 


company was owned as to 90% and 10% by Shanxi Zhong He and Mr. Li Qi, 


respectively. 





On 15 July 2009, the registered capital of the company increased to RMB 10,000,000 


and Shanxi Zhong He further injected RMB 9,000,000 into the company. Thereafter, 


Shanxi Zhong He’s and Mr. Li Qi’s equity interest in the company were 99% and 1%, 


respectively.

On 26 September 2009, Mr. Meng Haigui acquired, in aggregate, 55% equity interest in 


the company from Shanxi Zhong He and Mr. Li Qi. Thereafter, Mr. Meng Haigui’s and 


Shanxi Zhong He’s equity interests in the company changed to 55% and 45%, 


respectively.” 





c. Huajie’s shareholder, Shanxi Langqian Mineral Co., Ltd. (former name: Shanxi Jiangtong 


Chemical Co., Ltd.), has a joint venture with King Stone Energy which is controlled by Ming 


Zhao, PUDA’s chairman. 


On June 2, 2011, King Stone made an announcement regarding its joint venture with Shanxi Langqian 


Mineral Co., Ltd. and CITIC Trust, a company prevalent in the PUDA fraud story.  According to the 


disclosure: 


“The Board is pleased to announce that in furtherance of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, 


山西普華德勤冶金科技有限公司(Shanxi Puhua Deqin Metallurgy Technology Company 


Limited) (“Shanxi Puhua”), which is a subsidiary of the company established in the People’s 


Republic of China (the “PRC”), CITIC Trust and 山西朗亁礦業有限公司(Shanxi Langqian Mineral 


Co., Ltd) (“Shanxi Mineral”), both being independent third parties not connected with the 


Company.” 





On May 18, 2011, Shanxi Langqian Mineral Co., Ltd. (“Shanxi Mineral”) dismissed its former name, 


Shanxi Jiangtong Chemical Co., Ltd., as shown below: 


 



http://www.663hk.com/attachment/20110602194701001217354_en.pdf

http://www.663hk.com/attachment/20110602194701001217354_en.pdf
Note: Shanxi Langqian Mineral Co., Ltd. changed its name from Shanxi Jiangtong Chemical Co., Ltd. on 
May 18, 2011.   
 


Before this change, on March 14, 2011, Shanxi Mineral signed a letter of intent with Taiyuan Longwei to 


sell the Huajie facility to LPH.   


 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1111817/000101376211000602/ex991.htm
Therefore, we can conclude that LPH has a very close relationship with King Stone Energy (HK: 0663) 


through LPH’s subsidiary Zhonghe and the acquisition of Huajie facility whose shareholder (Langqian, 


formerly Jiangtong) has a joint venture with King Stone Energy.  





Experienced China RTO investors already know the intensive relationship between King Stone Energy 


and PUDA and that both were controlled by Ming Zhao, who the SEC has charged with securities fraud in 


connection with PUDA. 





3.  LPH’s Minority Interests In Taiyuan Longwei Owned By Mr. Cai Yongjun Are Not Reflected In Its 


Balance Sheet As Non-Controlling Interests  


In LPH’s SEC filings, the corporate structure is stated as follows:  


Subsidiaries Country Percentage of Ownership 


Longwei Petroleum Investment Holding Limited British Virgin Islands 100% 


Taiyuan Yahua Energy Conversion Ltd. PRC 100% 


Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Ltd. PRC 100% (a) 


Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. PRC 100% (a) 


Shanxi Heitan Zhingyou Petrochemical Co., Ltd PRC 100% (a) 





The 2011 10-K contains the following footnote, designated by ‘(a)’ in the above chart: 


“A total of 95% of the ownership units are held by the LPH’s subsidiaries. The remaining 5% of 


the ownership units are held in trust for the benefit of the LPH’s subsidiaries in accordance with 


local Chinese regulations, therefore no non-controlling interest is recognized.  The 5% 


ownership units are held in trust by our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Cai Yongjun, for the benefit of 


Taiyuan Yahua Energy Conversion Ltd. and Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Ltd.  The 5% 


ownership unit held in trust for the benefit of Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. is held 


by an individual who is also an employee of the LPH. This ownership structure is organized to 


comply with PRC and local business ownership requirements 


Taiyuan Yahua Energy Conversion Ltd., Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Ltd. and Shanxi 


Heitan Zhingyou Petrochemical Co. Ltd. are taxed pursuant to the New EIT Law with a unified 


enterprise income tax rate of 25%. None of these companies had income taxes due during the 


three month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.  Since these three entities have 


minimal business operations, the three entities are unlikely to have profits in future periods. As 


a result, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are deminimus, and management would have a 


100% valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets.  


The operating subsidiary of Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. is taxed pursuant to the 


New EIT Law with a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25%.  This entity had taxes due for the 


three month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 of $6.2 million and $5.3 million, 


respectively.”

However, on June 29, 2012, LPH disclosed its Tax Reconciliation Report including a purportedly official 


Taiyuan Longwei SAIC report:

 English Version of the above image 


The SEC disclosure referenced in the above footnote of the 2011 10-K that states that... 


"The 5% ownership unit held in trust for the benefit of Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. 


is held by an individual who is also an employee of the LPH." 


...differs from what is disclosed in Taiyuan Longwei’s SAIC filing presented by LPH which reveals that Mr. 


Cai Yongjun, LPH’s chairman actually owns 5% of Taiyuan Longwei. 


Based upon the SAIC file we pullied, the real corporate structure is as follows:  





Therefore, in this circumstance, LPH should  either execute a new  agreement with Mr. Cai Yongjun 


regarding his 5% of Taiyuan Longwei and/or list Mr. Cai’s non-controlling interests in LPH’s financial

statements.  Also, LPH may also need to disclose the 5% “in trust” agreement to its shareholders and/or 


investors to make sure that it can abide by the “U.S. GAAP standard for conslidation without non-


controlling interests. 


4.  Inconsistencies Between 2011 and 2012 Financial Reports Regarding Zhingyou’s Operating and 


Financial Information 


LPH’s annual report (10-K) for the financial year ended June 30, 2012 contradicts information in its 


annual report (10-K) for the financial year ended June 30, 2011 regarding Zhingyou, the operating 


subsidiary of the Gujiao facility. 


Obvious inconsistencies in its revenue claims exist in its SEC filings: 


 In its annual report for the period ending June 30, 2011 LPH stated that Zhingyou (owner of its 


Gujiao facility), along with Taiyuan Longwei (owner of its Taiyuan facility), paid substantial 


taxes and reported large revenues.  


 This is totally contradicted by LPH’s annual report for the year ending June 30, 2012 that clearly 


states Zhingyou had minimal operations and paid no taxes in its 2011 financial year.   


Here are the specific details: 


In the annual report for the period ending June 30, 2011, LPH disclosed that Zhingyou was the operating 


subsidiary for Gujiao facility as follows:  


“The operating subsidiaries of Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. and its subsidiary 


Shanxi Heitan Zhingyou Petrochemical Co. Ltd. (Gujiao operations) are taxed pursuant to the 


New EIT Law with a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25%.  These entities had taxes due 


during the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 of $23.6 million and $16.7 million, respectively. 





In the same annual report, LPH disclosed that the Gujiao facility generated revenue and sales volume in 


the two quarters (January 1, 2011 to June 30, 3011) of 2011 as follows:  





Gujiao Facility  Quarter ended  


March 31, 2011 


Quarter ended  


June 30, 2011 


Product Sales Revenue  $ 51,408,000 $ 50,072,000 


Sales volume  48,076mt 42,431mt 





However, in the annual report for the period ending June 30, 2012, LPH disclosed that it only has one 


operating subsidiary, Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd, and that Zhingyou became a non-


operating subsidiary:  


“Taiyuan Yahua Energy Conversion Ltd., Shanxi Zhonghe Energy Conversion Ltd. and Shanxi 


Heitan Zhingyou Petrochemical Co. Ltd. are taxed pursuant to the New EIT Law with a unified 


enterprise income tax rate of 25%. None of these companies had income taxes due during the
years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.  Since these three entities have minimal business 


operations, the three entities are unlikely to have profits in future periods.  As a result, all 


deferred tax assets and liabilities are deminimus, and management would have a 100% 


valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets. 





The operating subsidiary of Taiyuan Longwei Economy & Trading Ltd. is taxed pursuant to the 


New EIT Law with a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25%.  This entity had taxes due for the 


years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 of $21.3 million and $23.5 million, respectively.” 





Yet, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, LPH claims that its Gujiao facility continued to generate 


substantial revenue.   





Gujiao Facility  Quarter ended 


Sep. 30, 2011 


Quarter ended  


December 31, 


2011 


Quarter ended 


March 31, 2012 


Quarter ended 


June 30, 2012 


Product Sales Revenue  $ 54,843,000 $ 56,261,000 $ 64,293,000 $ 58,351,000 


Sales volume  43,844mt 47,542mt 51,900mt 47,140mt 





The only reasonable explanation for the change in the number of subsidiaries is that after June 30, 2011 


Zhingyou ceased its Gujiao facility operation and Taiyuan Longwei operated both facilities: Taiyuan 


facility and Gujiao facility, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.   





However it not reasonable to assume that the Gujiao facility has been closed when we consider that, as 


of today, Zhingyou still carries the required Dangerous Chemical Distribution License.  Therefore, we 


conclude that Zhingyou still exists and is still the operating subsidiary of the Gujiao facility. This raises 


the question: 


 Why did LPH claim that Zhingyou suddenly is not an operating subsidiary when it appears to still 


operate the Gujiao facility? 


The answer may lie in the SAT/SAIC filings that LPH disclosed as part of its reconciliation.  Perhaps LPH 


did away with Zhingyou to avoid having to present Zhingyou’s SAT documents to U.S. investors, so that it 


could omit the true SAT filings of its Gujiao facility. 


5.  The Tax Reconciliation Report (SAIC/SAT file) provided by LPH on June 29, 2012 claimed that only 


Taiyuan Longwei generated revenue and paid income tax in the calendar year 2011. This contradicts 


LPH’s 10-K filing for the financial year ending June 30, 2011, which clearly mentioned that Zhingyou 


was also the operating subsidiary of the Gujiao facility and generated substantial revenue.    


Quick Refresher on ChinaHybrid Subsidiary Financial Data Consolidation 





Regarding ChinaHybrids, we discussed the relevance between the SAIC/SAT and SEC files in past articles.  


By now, investors in this space should know that Chinese companies need to file their financial numbers 



http://www.sxwhaj.gov.cn/cx/licence.jsp

http://blog.geoinvesting.com/?p=1021

http://geoinvesting.com/forums/yaf_postsm3587_Annual-Inspection-and-Income-Tax-Filing-Process-in.aspx#singleMsg
to SAIC for each calendar year ending December 31.  Chinese companies file their own financial numbers 


and never consolidate their subsidiaries’ financial data, except in situations where holding companies 


clearly make a note that their financial statements are consolidated for the whole group.  LPH has never 


made such a consolidation statement in its filings. 





In an effort to appear transparent to investors, LPH disclosed SAIC and SAT financial data to investors for 


the calendar year ending December 2011.  Only on June 29, 2012 did LPH disclose Taiyuan Longwei’s 


SAIC and SAT numbers for the calendar year ended on December 31, 2011 to reconcile its SAT/SAIC file 


to its US GAAP filings.   Furthermore, based upon Taiyuan Longwei’s SAT/SAIC file, Taiyuan Longwei was 


the only LPH operating entity, paying all of LPH’s PRC income tax and VAT tax in the calendar year 


ending December 31, 2011.    


Based on the above, we would have expected LPH to present SAIC/SAT information for its two 


subsidiaries (Taiyuan Longwei and Zhingyou) it historically claimed to have operated in 2011.  But this 


was not the case, leading us to believe that LPH may not have provided investors with authentic 


SAIC/SAT filings, and leaving us wondering why the company omitted the 2011 Zhingyou SAIC/SAT filing. 


The following diagram explains the different disclosures between LPH’s SEC file and its SAIC/SAT file 


regarding its operating entities:  





In the SEC filings, LPH claimed that Zhingyou was an operating subsidiary for the Gujiao facility in the 


financial year ended June 30, 2011 and generated substantial revenue. LPH should have also disclosed 


the SAIC/SAT filings for Zhingyou to reflect its Gujiao operation for the first half of 2011. Yet LPH did not 


disclose any SAIC/SAT files regarding Zhingyou for its Gujiao facility operation.   



http://ir.stockpr.com/longweipetroleum/tax-reconciliation
Most importantly, based upon the LPH disclosed SAIC/SAT file, Taiyuan Longwei recorded Zhingyou’s 


revenue regarding the Gujiao facility for the first half of 2011 (January to June 2011) when Zhingyou was 


allegedly the operator of Gujiao facility.  


The Gujiao facility operated by Zhingyou and the Taiyuan facility operated by Taiyuan Longwei are 


located in different districts and are covered by different SAT authorities.   


Simply put, for 2011:  


 Taiyuan Longwei should pay taxes for its operation to its local SAT office: Wanbailin District SAT; 


and 


 Zhingyou should pay taxes for its operation to its local SAT office: Jiancaopin District SAT.  


Ironically and contrary to PRC law and practice, Taiyuan Longwei allegedly paid all the corporate income 


tax and VAT tax that Zhingyou was legally required to pay for its Gujiao facility operation for the period 


ending June 30, 2011, when LPH clearly stated that Zhingyou was the operating subsidiary of the  Gujiao 


facility. 


LPH claims that Taiyuan Longwei allegedly paid all corporate income tax and VAT tax to the Wanbailin 


District SAT for both the Taiyuan facility and Gujiao facility.  However, based upon the SEC files, 


Zhingyou was responsible for paying the corporate income tax and VAT tax for the Gujiao facility for the 


period ending June 30, 2011.  Zhingyou is supposed to pay the corporate income tax and VAT tax to its 


own SAT office in the Jiancaopin District for the Gujiao facility operation before June 30, 2011.  It is 


illogical that Taiyuan Longwei paid corporate income tax and VAT tax to its Wanbailin District SAT for the 


Gujiao facility operation before June 30, 2011.    


We therefore question the authenticity and truth of the SAIC/SAT reconciliation disclosed by LPH on 


June 29, 2012.  


Conclusion:    


We could not believe that after three years of the market exposing the fraud that has occurred in the 


ChinaHybrid space that a company like LPH and its fee collectors still believe that they can peddle a story 


to U.S. investors that is almost certain in our opinion to end horribly.  Not one part of LPH’s story holds 


credence, whether one looks at it from an operational or legal perspective; which is why we believe LPH 


is the most brazen fraud we have seen to date among China based U.S. listed companies.  We view a 


halt and delisting as inevitable and would not be surprised if the SEC chooses to revoke LPH’s 


registration as a public company.  LPH does not even deserve to trade on the Pink Sheets in our view. 


Over the past few years we warned investors through our in-depth analysis about Subaye (SBAY), China 


Redstone (CGPI), Lotus Pharmaceuticals (LTUS), Puda Coal (PUDA), Yuhe (YUII), New Energy (NEWN), 


Orsus Xelent (ORSX) and Sino Clean Energy (SCEI).  All now trade as penny stocks.  SBAY, PUDA, YUII, 


ORS and SCEI all made investors suffer through de-listings.  SBAY and PUDA were both charged with 


fraud by the SEC.  We warned RedChip about LTUS.  Now we are appealing to their sense of ethical duty 


to heed our warning about LPH and to not spend even one day longer backing a fraud.
