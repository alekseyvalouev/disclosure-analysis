Globalstar: TLPS In Perspective
Nov. 20, 2014 9:30 AM ET26 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Support for TLPS was the brainchild of John Dooley of Jarvinian.


The background of Dooley and Jarvinian show the risks of unbalanced optimism for
unproven technologies.


Other wireless constituents continue to line up against Globalstar with the FCC.


I continue to be fascinated by the action surrounding Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT). The
stock has been very volatile as a largely retail investor base tries to handicap the odds of
spectrum riches vs. bankruptcy vs. distressed financing.


Jim Cramer recently highlighted the risks of Globalstar, sending the stock down a quick
15%. It was notable that Cramer did not try to handicap the prospects for the company's
technology. CEO James Monroe (who has recently been buying stock) subsequently
appeared on Cramer to support the stock, but so far the share price has not been
cheered.


In my past articles, I also deliberately tried to take a step back and evaluate Globalstar
without delving into the technological minutia. I believe that there are bigger picture
issues, which dominate the equation and that many people who are spending their time
trying to decipher all of the techie details are missing the forest for the trees.


Today, however, I am looking at a technology aspect. But I am doing it in a different way
so as to provide additional perspective for those who are trying to piece together the TLPS
puzzle. Specifically I am looking at the origins and history of Globalstar's involvement with
TLPS and the involvement of the entity known as Jarvinian.


Back in January of 2013, Globalstar had a share price of around 30 cents and the
company was basically in tatters. TLPS was the "brainchild" needed to resuscitate the
company. But it was not the brainchild of Globalstar itself.


As mentioned on a January 2013 webinar, General Counsel L. Barbee Ponder said:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 2/15


Now I'm pleased to be joined by John Dooley of Jarvinian. The TLPS opportunity is
his brainchild, and we are grateful for all of his technical assistance in making
TLPS a reality this year.


It should be noted that elsewhere within this webinar, Ponder noted that TLPS was on
track to become a "reality by the end of the year." Yet as we are approaching 2 years
out, we still have no TLPS reality.


In order to better understand the prospects for TLPS, it is instructive to evaluate its history
with Dooley and Jarvinian.


The key point from all of this is that Globalstar has relied heavily on Dooley and his
Jarvinian to sell investors on the TLPS concept. In fact, it appears that they may
have largely oversold Mr. Dooley as well as the TLPS concept.


Mr. Dooley is still heavily involved with the TLPS concept. Following the presentation of
the short thesis by Kerrisdale Capital, Globalstar held a lengthy conference call to rebut
the negative sentiment. Dooley was the key speaker on this call and his remarks were in
fact more than twice as long as those from CEO Jay Monroe. This led to some confusion
among listeners who assumed that Mr. Dooley must be a Globalstar employee. In fact, he
is not.


On the conference call, CEO Monroe introduced Dooley as "the founder and managing
director of Jarvinian, a spectrum and advisory practice that has been working with
Globalstar for the last several years to develop the concepts around TLPS."


Mr. Dooley wrote the technical appendix to Globalstar's 2012 petition for rulemaking. But
his background there is relayed in a different context:


I, John Dooley, am Managing Director of Jarvinian Ventures, a wireless investment
fund. I am an Engineer with 17 years of experience in the development of advanced
wireless technologies. I am qualified to provide the opinions and analyses presented
in this Declaration. Under penalty of perjury, I hereby declare that the preceding is
true and correct to the best of my information, knowledge, and belief:


So the first question about Jarvinian is: is Jarvinian a spectrum and advisory
practice working for Globalstar, or is it a fund pursuing its own objectives as it
stated to the FCC?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 3/15


Finding out much about Dooley is a bit of a challenge. Mr. Dooley did author several self-
promotional articles on himself on Wikipedia, but these were deleted after the self
promotion was highlighted by other users. It appears that Dooley was using aliases ("B
Manohar") to attempt to try to create buzz around his own name (i.e. pretending to be
someone else) before being discovered. Clicking on the link and viewing the history of
changes to the article makes this clear.


Despite the curious background, Globalstar's recent conference call presented him with
significant accolades. But it appears that they largely oversold their conference call expert,
saying that he:


· Developed regulatory and technological solutions for the reformation of previously
unusable RF spectrum


· Assisted Globalstar in developing TLPS, made possible with Globalstar satellite
spectrum


· Developer of a regulatory and engineering solution for Terrestar, opening up
unanticipated new 4G spectrum in L-Band


· Founder of Nanoton; created advanced nanomaterials enabling next-generation wireless
filters and antennas


· Holds numerous patents in wireless and intelligent computing technologies


In fact, Terrestar (OTC:TSTRQ) is a pink sheets traded company which is also being
restructured. It business description states that Terrestar "seeks to launch a wireless
communications system to provide mobile coverage throughout the United States and
Canada using integrated satellite-terrestrial smartphones." But so far, there has been no
petition for rulemaking and Terrestar is currently realizing revenues of just $3 million per
quarter while losing $60 million per quarter at the bottom line.


Nanoton sounds very advanced, stating that it is "developing advanced nano-polymer
filtration capabilities for next generation wireless networks." But its website still refers to
Jarvinian's old office address, as it has since 2010. The only real press release to come
out of Nanoton was in January 2013, at the same time as the Globalstar webinar, which
stated that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 4/15


Jarvinian Wireless Innovation Fund has begun a long-term development and
investment relationship with Nanoton, a producer of high performance nanomaterial
derived RF filtration for wireless infrastructure. Jarvinian will help Nanoton accelerate
the availability of high-selectivity filtration, which is critical to the efficient utilization of
new spectrum.


Basically, it is a company, which is not engaged in commercial activity, which is simply
founded by one arm of Dooley to interact with his other arm, Jarvinian.


As for the "numerous" patents, Mr. Dooley has received three according to Google's
patent search function. One in each of 1995 (expired), 2007 and 2013.


But Jarvinian and Dooley were clearly very important to the October 9th Globalstar
conference call. A majority of the technical diagrams and analysis were directly sourced
directly to information supplied by Jarvinian. This can be seen in the footnotes on each
exhibit.


Jarvinian has been involved in a back and forth battle with the Engineers for the Integrity
of Broadcast Auxiliary Services Spectrum also known as EIBASS. In 2013, EIBASS wrote
Ex Parte comments to the FCC accusing Jarvinian and Globalstar of violating the terms of
its test licenses by not contacting the relevant broadcasters for interference coordination.
Jarvinian's role is mentioned specifically throughout.


EIBASS has taken an aggressive stance against Globalstar's testing of TLPS, stating
(emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 5/15


In its reply comments, Globalstar once again incorrectly claims that the issue
of grandfathered TV BAS Channel A10 at 2,483.5-2,500 MHz is a settled issue.
It is not.


What is important is that this Globalstar filing constituted an acknowledgement, at
long last, of the fundamental incompatibility between grandfathered TV BAS
Channel A10 operations and MSS ATC operations. Adding AWS-5/TLPS only
aggravates the problem.


Globalstar did not entertain the notion of frequency coordination being able to avoid
interference between BRS1 base stations and MSS ATC base stations, even
though both would be fixed-site stations. Why? Because the MSS handsets that
would communicate with MSS ATC base stations are mobile devices, triggered by
subscribers making telephone calls, web surfing, or other data requests, whose
time-of-use and location is never known in advance. It is the identical conflict for co-
channel grandfathered TV BAS Channel A10 ENG operations and MSS ATC/AWS-
5/TLPS.


The response and rebuttal from Jarvinian on behalf of Globalstar can be found here.


EIBASS's latest filing from November 2014 with the FCC can be found here. ABC and
CBS Television networks have already come out in support of EIBASS's position, stating:


This letter is filed on behalf of the ABC Television Network ("ABC") and CBS
Television Stations ("CBS") in support of the ex parte comments of the Engineers
for the Integrity of Broadcast Auxiliary Services Spectrum ("EIBASS")… ABC and
CBS wish to emphasize the critical role that BAS spectrum in the 2450-2500 MHz
band, namely BAS Channels A8-A10 ("BAS Channels"), plays in the coverage of
sports events and other events of public importance, e.g., breaking news, coverage
of emergency situations, etc.


The ABC and CBS filing with the FCC can be found here.


The battle has continued, even after the short thesis, which has been presented by
Kerrisdale.


According to tvtechnology.com, "EIBASS Warns of Globalstar TLPS Interference Propose
2 GHz Wi-Fi said to pose problems"


The article notes that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 6/15


A group of engineers who actively rally for Broadcast Auxiliary Service spectrum say
a proposed Wi-Fi service in the 2 GHz band would interfere with BAS. Globalstar
of Covington, La., is proposing to build a terrestrial, low-power broadband network
on its licensed spectrum at 2,483.5 to 2,495 Mhz….


The Globalstar ex parte filing spends pages explaining how TLPS/AWS-5 would be
compatible with existing 2.4 GHz S-band WiFi operations, while ignoring how
newcomer co-channel AWS-5 operations would avoid interference to grandfathered
A10 TV pickup stations in many of the major metros, such as Boston, Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Sacramento, San
Francisco and other areas," the Engineers for the Integrity of Broadcast Auxiliary
Service Spectrum said, also in an ex parte filing.


While the headlines focus mostly on Globalstar, the Ex Parte filings themselves have a
heavy focus on the involvement of Jarvinian in conducting the testing.


For those who are determined to try to handicap the outcome of the FCC decision making
process, I strongly encourage them to have a read through all of the Ex Parte filings,
which can be found here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 7/15


Jarvinian and Dooley have a long history of ambitious plans. There is heavy marketing of
the ideas and a strong sales pitch, but ultimately results have traditionally failed to appear.
So far, this has also included Globalstar's TLPS.


In 1993, prior to Jarvinian, Mr. Dooley filed for a patent for a "space lattice passive
repeater," or SLPR. The goal of this was to reduce interference from local cell base
stations.


In 1996, he founded Novatics, Inc. and appointed himself CEO. By June, he had assigned
his SLPR patent to Novatics. The website has since been taken down for Novatics, but a
snapshort of it from archive.org reveals heavy promotion of this idea. For example, there
was the following "press release":


New Technology Allows Wireless Operators to Untether Broadband Internet


New York, NEW YORK - The Novatics corporation will today announce the unveiling
of Conduit3G, the Wireless industry's first new model for system development in
over two decades.


"Conduit3G represents a dramatic leap forward in network capabilities," says John
Dooley, Director of the Novatics Advanced Systems Group. "For the first time, we
will truly have to [sic] ability to bring high capacities and advanced applications, such
as broadband Internet, to wireless users. Up until this point, many were questioning
whether the promises made regarding mobile videoconference and Internet
browsing were going to be viable. Conduit3G removes any doubt - such things are
now possible with our technology.


Five years later, in 2006, Dooley was still posting white papers and a "pre-market
technology briefing and disclosure."


Like the TLPS concept at Globalstar, the need for Conduit3G was portrayed as being both
indispensable and imminent. But I can find no reference to the technology having been
adopted in practice.


Likewise, other projects came up with fancy sounding names and terminology, but which
never ultimately resulted in any commercial activity. There was the "the Hyper-Sensitive
RF Transducer Project," "the recently announced 5-Year Initiative," and "ultra-massively
parallel supercomputing."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 8/15


The point is that, just like with Globalstar's TLPS, there has been a tendency to present
the adoption of new wireless technologies as being certain and imminent. The results then
fail to materialize.


As with TLPS, the estimation of the timing appears to be right around the corner. There
are subsequent delays. Then it is dropped altogether.


In 2004, the Novatics stated that "Fully [sic] availability of Novatics technology for next-
generation commercial wireless networks can be expected by Q4 2005 in nearly all
markets." But by 2005, it was "by Q1 2006." Then in 2006, it was "by Q2 2007." This was
the case until, 2009, when the Novatics website was finally taken down.


The point is that we can also see from the predecessor to Jarvinian a history of over-
excitement and hype for an imminent technology adoption, which never happens.


I have no doubt that Mr. Dooley and Jarvinian hold the same level of excitement towards
TLPS as they have with their past technological predictions. But if the past is any guide,
then TLPS likely faces a challenging future.

This is a terrible article. You never write anything of substance. Looking at the past is just looking at the past. Examine
the current situation. You fail to mention that the NPRM was issued by the FCC and that the comment and reply
period have passed a few months ago. The last step is TLPS approval which is a question of when not if. Also, every
time you write an article the stock goes up. According to your logic the stock will fly today. The stock will go higher
today anyways but not because of your logic.

In the disclosure at the top of your article: 
"The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."


You mention Kerrisdale, but not their stock, in your article. Have you been compensated by Kerrisdale for your
analysis of GSAT's prospects?


In any event, thanks for the link to the ex parte filings. Ruckus stands out as having unparalled expertise and interest
in effective use of 2.4 and 5 GHz spectrum and an absence of conflict of interest. They say:


"Since our founding in 2004, Ruckus has led the industry in performance innovation, never relying on off-the-shelf,
reference design radio technology that doesn't deliver the capacity, range or interference mitigation necessary to
make the dream of high performance wireless a reality."


"In order for this performance innovation to continue to meet the exploding demand for mobile data applications and
services, every megahertz is important, but all megahertz are not created equal. Ruckus urges the FCC to move
forward to free up additional low, mid and upper band spectrum. .WHile the FCC's ongoing efforts to open up the 5
GHz band to greater unlicensed use is critical to this effort, the 2.4 GHz band will remain an important source of
unlicensed spectrum due to its superior propagation characteristics. Given the well-documented fact that existing 2.4
GHz unlicensed spectrum is becoming saturated with use in an ever increasing portion of the nation, the FCC's
proposed rules in the above referenced proceeding will provide a much needed significant increase in available mid-
band spectrum."


"... Ruckus urges the FCC to adopt its proposed rules in this proceeding expeditiously."


Whom should we believe? You, Adrangi and Akin? Or Ruckus?

By now it should be obvious to even casual observers that S/A is engaged in a coordinated effort to attack and drive
down the share price of GSAT for what can be loosely characterized as 'dubious' purposes. S/A is NOT a company
providing useful and informed investment insights, but rather a rogue entity that is intent on launching a barrage of
intentionally misleading predictions to support a short thesis made by a supposedly unaffiliated third party. These
flagrant disparaging claims are crafted to seem like realities, when in fact, their thesis is flimsy at best, and at worst, a
complete fabrication. IMO, S/A needs to be investigated by the SEC to see what their real agenda is... now THAT
would make an interesting article!

I'm not ready to say Seeking Alpha is part of this conspiracy without more information - but there does seem

When it comes to misdirection and self-serving, Pearson and Adrangi come out about equal in many ways.
Perhaps Cramer was their inspiration and mentor (in secret abstention?) But take a look at this video to see if
you don't find some like thinking and action to what Cramer describes. Cramer says he won't say this on TV,
and I doubt these authors would say such a thing in public either.


Hear what Cramer has to say about how to deal with TRUTH from any short hedge fund perspective,
especially if those funds think they are about to lose money: "What would you do?"

Want to know what's really going on with GSAT? View the link provided above by Sand Paint: http://bit.ly/ujbmbI
(Thank you, SP!) In it, Cramer talks about some of the hedge fund practices being perfectly legal, but then he turns to
the ones that are blatantly illegal, yet commonly practiced, b/c the SEC (allegedly) doesn't know how to prosecute
them. It's quite interesting to hear him explain how the stock market REALLY works (i.e., gets manipulated), and in
doing so, he inherently explains everything that has been going on with GSAT lately. (How Cramer stays out of jail
making statements like the ones in this video totally escapes me.)

Nothing wrong with Cramer per se. Under the practised buffoonery, paid for by CNBC and their surrogates, he
knows exactly what goes on. There is certainly nothing wrong or untoward in describing what is/should be
considered criminal. It is truly a public education service he performs in that regard, he has zero to do with it.
We fondly remember days long past when 'Wash Trading' was not only illegal, but was actually prosecuted.
Today, deep dark whirlpools can create the same result (in the honored name of 'liquidity') which cannot be
detected.

Author, your earlier Article gave us great reason to compare the long term 'value added ' of three quite different
business models- GSAT, UBNT , and ALU. While the immediate reaction would be 'thats apples, oranges, and
bananas' , we came to the conclusion that what ALU (also NOK, or ERIC ) cannot (now or soon) do really well on that
difficult 'last leg', that UBNT can generally do faster and cheaper than any satellite. GSAT money (sadly) has now
been redeployed (profitably) to ALU and (so far breakeven) to UBNT. The latter is a sleeper but speeds and user cost
are radically better than anything satellite. And the 'extremely remote' market (cruise ships, equipment) is a cost
sensitive market that is already well serviced in our universe. Check out INMARSAT/ALU news today for more
valuable insight. Satellite as a service is rapidly becoming a high cost service commodity with few barriers to entry.

CCI, DISH, GSAT, T, TMUS, VZ Spectrum Auction Positive For DISH, Globalstar #GSAT, Says JPMorgan. As seen on
http://bit.ly/12Dvz7t News Breaks November 19, 2014 13:10 EDT                                                                                    
                             


DISH, Globalstar #GSAT climb as wireless spectrum bids reportedly jump Shares of DISH DISH and Globalstar
#GSAT are climbing after JPMorgan wrote that results from an auction of AWS-3 wireless spectrum bode well for the
companies' outlook. Both companies own a significant amount of wireless spectrum. WHAT'S NEW: The value of bids
for AWS-3 wireless spectrum being auctioned by the FCC reached $16.4B yesterday, well over the minimum price
threshold of $10.6B set by the FCC and significantly higher than the $8.9B level reached on Monday, JPMorgan
analyst Philip Cusick wrote in a note to investors before the market opened today. The news is positive for DISH and
Globalstar #GSAT, Cusick stated. The results of the auction imply that DISH could be worth over $85 per share, the
analyst estimated. The bidding also bodes well for cell phone tower operators American Tower #AMT, SBA
Communications #SBAC, and Crown Castle #CCI, Cusick stated. On the other hand, the news is negative for AT&T
#T and Verizon #VZ which are looking to buy the spectrum, the analyst believes. Two other telecom companies - T-
Mobile #TMUS and U.S. Cellular #USM - could also be harmed but the high costs in the auction, he believes. T-
Mobile may wind up getting little spectrum from the auction, while US Cellular could end up spending more than the
$150M-$250M that had been expected, Cusick predicted. PRICE ACTION: In early afternoon trading, DISH rose
7.9% to $73.22 and Globalstar #GSAT gained 4% to $2.65.                                                                                            
                                                                                              Spectrum auction positive for DISH, Globalstar #GSAT,
says JPMorgan November 19, 2014 07:19 EDT                                                                                                          


JPMorgan notes the AWS-3 spectrum auction continued on Tuesday with the aggregate value of licenses with bids at
$16.4B, up from Monday's $8.9B and compared to the reserve price of $10.6B that the FCC set for the entire auction.
The firm views the rise in prices as negative for telecom carriers that are spending more than expected, namely AT&T
#T and Verizon #VZ, and possibly T-Mobile TMUS and US Cellular. It views the prices as positive for independent
spectrum owners like DISH #DISH and Globalstar #GSAT, as well as tower companies American Tower AMT, SBA
Communications #SBAC and Crown Castle #CCI.

Dane Ericksen, P.E.
Thank you for identifying the TV BAS conflict. The FCC will need to make its usual balancing of the public interest
between incumbent users and a proposed new service. Just as long as Part 74 TV BAS and Part 101 FS operations
aren't ignored, as several parties to this rulemaking have tried to do. EIBASS re-checked with the Boston TV station
where the initial meeting with Jarvinian was held, and confirmed that there was supposed to have been a follow-up

meeting to complete the required frequency coordination, but that meeting never happened. So EIBASS stands
behind its June 26, 2013, FCC filing, and has to disagree with Jarvinian's version of what transpired.

WallStPriate, it seems you have written a total of zero articles. Before assigning others homework perhaps
you should do some yourself.

Globalstar sails as Kerrisdale exits short options


Feb 17 2015, 17:13 ET | By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor Contact this editor with comments or a news tip 
Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) gained 6.3% today (and is on the move after hours, +2%).Hedge fund Kerrisdale
Advisers filed a 13F indicating it closed out its bearish position, $7.3M in put options, as of Dec. 31.Kerrisdale's Sahm
Adrangi famously knocked Globalstar shares for a loop in early October by pricing the firm's equity at $0: "Globalstar's
equity is worthless. It is not worth $4 billion, or $3 billion, or $1 billion. It is worth nothing."Shares had risen 58% in the
52 weeks prior to Adrangi's take; they slipped some 25% in the wake of rumors that he had gone short.

So far I haven't seen any comments presenting hard facts contradicting what this article says about Dooley. I think
that Pearson has researched this very well.


But just to check, is there anyone with hard facts contradicting what Pearson says about Dooley?
