Alliance Data Systems: If You Don’t Like the 
Answer ... Just Change the Question. 





Citron Target on Alliance Data Systems Corp is  
50% Near-Term Downside 





This month Citron Research celebrates its 15
th


 year of publication -- exposing, for lack of a 
better term, “market inefficiencies”.   
 


This neutral-sounding moniker is occasionally an accident ... but rarely.  Most often it exploits 
the shallowness of Wall Street's "insight" with management's intentional hype, misdirection or 
just plain fraud.  It has become too profitable taking advantage of a bullish market environment 
to ever let the truth get in the way of a good story.   
 


And then comes Citron Research 
 


In the Case of Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS), Wall Street is just now waking up to the 
misrepresentations that have been promulgated by ADS management.  At best, this is a mis-
categorized company which should immediately be priced 40% lower.  At worst management is 
covering up a business that has an entirely different risk profile ... and is one big credit event 
from derailing into a devastating downward spiral. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
What makes this story timely is that it is not just Citron but Wall Street analysts who are finally 
catching up to the story, as reflected in this weeks' note from Credit Suisse, which states:

Citron could not have said it better.  However, although Credit Suisse DID acknowledge the 
elephant in the room, they stopped short of driving their verdict to its inevitable valuation 
conclusion. 
 


"Increasingly Viewed As A Lender" 
 


Let's begin with the background for those who are not familiar with Alliance Data Systems.  This 
is what management CLAIMS they do in their most recent 10-K: 
 





This would lead most investors, and importantly, indexers, to categorize ADS as a business 
services company, which deservedly trades on earnings rather than book value, and be 
assigned a higher multiple than a bank.   
 


But as Credit Suisse noted, the lion's share of earnings do in fact come from the 
banks they operate.  The myth of ADS being a business services company has been widely 
accepted because the company is in the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index but not 
the S&P 500 Financial Sector Index.  Alliance Data Systems has no incentive to correct this obvious 
mis-categorization; management prefers the higher valuations that are associated with tech companies. 
  


“We are a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and 


loyalty solutions serving large, consumer-based businesses in a 


variety of industries. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of 


integrated outsourced marketing solutions, including customer 


loyalty programs, database marketing services, end-to-end 


marketing services, analytics and creative services, direct 


marketing services and private label and co-brand retail credit 


card programs.” 


 -- ADS 10-K Dec 31, 2015  


Alliance Data Closer To a Card Lender Than A Tech Company  
says Credit Suisse 


Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE: ADS) is being increasingly viewed as a lender, and 
its shares should trade in-line with other credit card lenders.  The market would eventually 
recognize Alliance Data as a lender.... 
 


The operations of the company’s card services business, which contributes the lion’s 
share of earnings, is at two bank subsidiaries. These two entities are limited by regulatory 
and capital requirements, which limits the parent company’s use of the cash generated by 
them.

Three divisions of ADS must be considered separately when valuing the company: 
 


1 LoyaltyOne 
(Tech) 


Runs loyalty programs and leverages the data collected to help design 
and implement marketing programs.  


2 Epsilon 
(Tech) 


A comprehensive suite of targeted and data-driven marketing services. A 
majority of clients do not currently use the full suite of services.  


3 Card Services 
(Bank) 


Provides a variety of funding and processing services for private label and 
co-branded credit card programs; leverages the transaction level data to 
drive multi-channel marketing activities.   





So while LoyaltyOne and Epsilon can fairly be valued as members of the Business Services (IT) 
cohort, ADS is more and more a bank wrapped in the Halloween costume of a business services 
company.   
 


The Obvious Next Question:  What’s the Breakdown? 
 
As we can see, ‘Card Services’ are more often than not discussed last, but is by far the most 
important division of Alliance Data Systems.  The bank-like portion of the business, is almost 
2/3rds of the business.  From the chart below you can see why ADS would rather be considered 
a tech services firm than a bank:

There aren’t too many tech companies out there that report zero Research and Development 
costs ... but it gets even more obvious than that. 





What does Alliance Data Systems Really Do?   
Numbers Don't Lie! 
 


The majority of its income being generated from its banks, ADS is clearly not primarily a 
technology company.  As the operator of Comenity Bank, ADS issues credit cards from Victoria 
Secret, JCrew, Ulta, and a list of other retailers.

* For those who defend the company claiming it should trade at a premium 
because their might be synergies between the two business …this is simply 
UNTRUE.  Citron's investigation makes clear that the crossover between clients 
is statistically insignificant; instances can be counted on one hand.  The only 
ones of note are Express and New York & Co.  





    Management Has Promoted This Deception 





Meanwhile, the company stopped reporting free cash flow in its Q2 2016 investor presentation 
(the last time it was not disclosed was Q4 2014).   
 


Generation of free cash is NOT what a bank should be focused on. 
 


More importantly the company is categorized into the Info Tech part of the S&P Index. 
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard 





Worse, ADS is explicitly in the “S&P 500 Ex-Financials” Index. 
 


Yet, until now analyst have still been complacent spouting off free cash 
flow when discussing the financial health.  Almost like having a 
conference call about how fast Usain Bolt can swim:  WHO REALLY 
CARES...? 
 


“In terms of the businesses, and what we worry about, what we're looking at, 
probably the thing that's important here is free cash flow. I am old school, believe very 
big in the generation of free cash.”

Plain and Simple:   
 


ADS sells the investment community on cash flows, not Return on Equity or Return on Assets, 
metrics that a bank would be valued on.  Instead they refer to financial metrics that are akin to 
a technology company. 
 


The Only Intellectually Honest Way To Value ADS 
 


While Credit Suisse got the ball rolling …. Citron now completes and publishes the obviously 
needed analysis.  Because of its two completely different business units, the only way to value 
ADS is a complete sum of the parts analysis -- looking at the bank and the tech operation 
separately. 
 


To be fair, we assign the non-bank business a fair multiple of 10x EBIDTA, which is widely 
accepted for this type of business. This is right in line with Amiya (AIM in Toronto), the largest 
of all customer loyalty data driven companies. 
 


We will add that to the value of the banks, assigning them a 2x book value, which is the same as 
Synchrony Financial, the gold standard of private label credit cards. 
 


*NOTE:  The corporate debt must be assigned to the loyalty business.  Due to Section 23 of the 
Federal Reserve Banking Regs, banks cannot hold corporate debt. They certainly can't raise 
debt to buy back shares. This concern is acknowledged in the GS research report on ADS. 
 


Because its more than half a bank, not a tech firm, the valuation models of 
Alliance are miles from reality!   
  


“However, we suspect that ValueAct is looking at free cash per share guidance in 
excess of Core EPS and is interested in two key potential avenues: first, the 
implementation of a dividend and second, a long-term commitment to prioritizing 
capital returns over M&A.” 


 -- JMP Jul 11, 2016 
 


“During the quarter, free cash flow was $421 million, with operating cash flow of $474 
million and capex of $53 million. 


 -- Raymond James Jul 21, 2016 
 
  


“strong free cash flow generation is used to repurchase stock to support EPS growth 
and the stock price.”

  Realigning Perceptions and Reality 
 


In a best-case scenario, ADS should trade at $100 per share -- $125 tops -- which is more than 
fair.  Worst case scenario, it could go much lower with a credit event.  While this story does 
need to explain what could happen, investors would be foolish not to pay attention to a lender 
with more red flags than the Beijing Olympics…..ALL WHICH COULD TRIGGER A CREDIT EVENT 
AND SEND THE STOCK LOWER THAN OUR PROJECTIONS 
 


The Single Most Disturbing Data Point about ADS: 
 


   ADS DOES NOT disclose FICO scores of their borrowers.  They are 
the only credit company in the S&P 500 that does not … this is beyond disturbing, 
because they intentionally cater to a lower than prime client.  See the "Shopping 
Cart Trick" below.  
 


And the other Red Flags:  
 


  Many of ADS private label credit cards purposely do not offer an auto pay 
feature, which enables them to earn a higher ROE from late fees charged.  This 
has already been the target of the FDIC and could go to the CFPB. 
 


  Comenity bank already has history of run-ins with regulators, and has been 
fined. CFPB is always a threat.   http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/comenity-bank-
fdic-fine-refund-1282.php   
 


  ADS is possibly the only bank on the S&P 500 that does not disclose Return 


on Equity or Return on Assets. 


 ADS is the rare financial institution on the S&P 500 that has > $5 billion of 


debt and no credit rating. 


 The sub-prime book is becoming more apparent -- you can see the 
connection to Lending Club of page 9 of their most recent 10-K.

  Charge-offs are growing: 
 





 Lastly, and the Biggest Red Flag of them All, is Comenity's 


Prominent Use of the “Shopping Cart Trick” 





Citron believes that a big part of the online credit card business of Comenity is based on a 
widely known trick amongst the subprime community which allows consumers to get credit, 
especially high fee retail-branded credit cards, without a credit request ever getting put on 
your credit records or lowering your FICO score.  Comenity is well aware of this credit 
loophole; you will be amazed of how popular it has become with the subprime community.   
 


Below are just 3 but there are literally hundreds of sites and videos dedicated to this Comenity 
“loophole".  Folks this is the Holy Grail of subprime lending:

prime customers:

How to Perform the Shopping Cart Trick 
1. Go online to the store’s website for the card you want. 
2. Register for their website or loyalty program. You will want to provide your 


personal information. Providing your address is a must because it allows them 
to send promotions to your address. 


3. Add a couple of items to your shopping cart. 
4. Continue the check-out process until you reach the final page. If you have not 


received an offer, then you will have try again or try another website. Again, 
you do not have to purchase anything. The process of going to the final 
checkout page increases your chance of an offer to pop up. 


5. Accept the offer and complete the application. 
 


Note: Be sure to enter the same information that is on your credit 
report when you’re applying for the credit card. If they cannot verify 
your identity, then you will not be eligible for the card.

So Why Do Investors Own ADS??? 
 


Simple: Investors buy ADS as a yield name as it boasts 10% free cash flow yields.  
Yet, using this  metric for a bank instead of its price to book is like asking Ryan 
Lochte how his night was.  You'll get an answer; it's just that reality might be a 
different story.   
 
The company has said numerous times in SEC filings that in 2015 they generated 


$1.3 billion in free cash flow.  This is not only misleading – in our opinion this is 


borderline fraudulent. 


In a time where we all increasingly struggle to understand or delineate GAAP vs. non-GAAP 
figures, the SEC has attempted to add clarity with Regulation G.  This regulation forces 
companies to “show their homework” when disclosing any non-GAAP financial measures, in this 
case when disclosing cash flows – Alliance Data Systems should show investors how they were 
calculated.  They should provide a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to provided GAAP figures (as 
free cash flow is a non-GAAP figure).  But Alliance Data Systems does not do this.   





Worse- they have changed their own definition of free cash flows. 
Q1 2013 Earnings Call  Q4 2014 Earnings Call  


Edward Heffernan (CEO): “One of the 
key things is free cash flow… everyone 
seems to define free cash flow 
differently. I keep it real simple, which 
is how much is left in the bank account 
at the end of the year, which means 
how much after you pay for CapEx and 
interest and taxes and working capital 
and bank capital and everything else.” 
(source) 


Edward Heffernan (CEO): “Then finally, 
free cash flow, if we are going to do 
around $1.8 billion or so of net EBITDA, 
if you take out CapEx and cash interest 
and cash taxes, we will probably be 
around $1.3 billion of free cash flow” 
(source) 





Research done by numerous accountant and industry experts has 
concluded that the actual free cash flow of ADS is less than HALF of 
what is disclosed, just $539 million … and here is the homework.

Citron Unmasks ADS August 19, 2016 Page 11 of 11 
 





While ADS wants investors to believe that free cash flow = EBITDA less taxes, 
capex, interest – in reality and in their own former calculation it is… Net dividends 
from the two banks to the parent plus the free cash flow of the non bank 
businesses.   
 


DUH!!!  Everyone knows that EBITDA is the most useless metric when looking at a 


bank ... Everyone except maybe ADS. 


       Conclusion 
 


Citron has attempted to present this story as simply as possible.  Goldman Sachs already 
understands the mispricing of ADS, and reports even its Sum of The Parts analysis is significantly 
lower than the stock's current lofty levels.  Now Credit Suisse is on board.  Pretty soon, all of 
Wall Street will wake up and understand that AT BEST- Alliance Data Systems is a $100 stock.  
And if we see a recession or other threat to consumer credit default rates, the floor becomes 
the ceiling ... overnight.
