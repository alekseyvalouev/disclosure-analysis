Cellceutix: A December To Remember May Turn Into A 2015 To Forget
For CTIX
Jan. 23, 2015 10:30 AM ET116 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


CTIX has made numerous misleading statements in the past.


CTIX has been promoted by an unregulated Swedish entity.


CTIX is burning around $5M cash per quarter and only has $7M in cash on hand
from the most recent quarter.


A December to remember may turn into a 2015 to forget for Cellceutix investors who have
been enjoying a run-up in the stock price on the back of several promotional press
releases. "Cellceutix expects December to be a momentous month in its history," read one
press release on November 24th, 2014.


A series of events have helped propel CTIX shares to a $500 million valuation.
Investors and traders would be wise to look deeper than these recent events into
this company's history.


Cellceutix (CTIX) entered the market through a reverse-merger with a company called
Econoshare, Inc. In December 2007, the company acquired Cellceutix Pharma, Inc. which
was a privately owned Delaware company that was incorporated just six months prior to
being acquired. Between its incorporation in July and the reverse merger in December
2007, Cellceutix Pharma acquired the rights to six pharmaceutical compounds. The
company said at the time that it would spend the majority of its time and resources on
Kevetrin. According to the filing:


The Company will initially spend most of its efforts and resources on its anti-cancer
compound, Kevetrin, for the treatment of head and neck cancers. This compound is
furthest along in in-vivo studies in small animals. Based on the results, the Company
has decided to advance it along the regulatory and clinical pathway.


Since then CTIX has added several other drugs to its pipeline. From a recent
presentation, these are CTIX's drugs.

Brilacidin


CTIX acquired Brilacidin out of bankruptcy from PolyMedix. Here is the press release
announcing the deal. CTIX paid $2.1 million in cash and included 1.4 million shares in the
deal. At the time CTIX was trading around $2/ share, bringing the total acquisition price to
$4.9 million. In the press release, CTIX said:


This is a transformational development for our Company and shareholders; adding
the assets of PolyMedix for a tiny fraction of what we believe the company is truly
worth," said Leo Ehrlich, Chief Executive Officer at Cellceutix. "We are very excited
about instantly having a strong antibiotic franchise to complement our already robust
pipeline that now contains 18 compounds. We intend to quickly advance Brilacidin
into a Phase 2b clinical trial, a drug that we believe could one day compete with
drugs like Pfizer's Zyvox, which generated $1.35 billion in sales in 2012. The
acquisition, which includes laboratory equipment and other furnishings that
we are confident cost in excess of $1 million, makes us an even more
formidable company.

In the press release, CTIX touted that they were also acquiring laboratory equipment and
other furnishings, in which they were "confident cost in excess of $1 million." While that
may be technically true, it is somewhat misleading. It doesn't matter how much PolyMedix
paid for the assets, because CTIX's press release does not take into account depreciation,
a very real cost for medical and laboratory equipment. According to the last 10-Q filed by
PolyMedix before CTIX acquired PolyMedix had $749,000 in "Office furniture and lab
equipment" as of September 30, 2012.


And since CTIX acquired these assets almost an entire year later, this does not factor that
additional depreciation. PolyMedix's accounts show accumulated depreciation of $1.2
million, meaning that PolyMedix did indeed cost more than $1 million, but again what it
cost does not matter as much as what the equipment is worth after depreciation. I believe
it is misleading for CTIX to reference the dollar amount that the assets cost originally and
not what PolyMedix thought they were worth in their last 10-Q.

In a more recent presentation from a Rodman and Renshaw event, CTIX continued with
the somewhat misleading statements about PolyMedix and that deal. Below is the slide
which I believe is misleading.


First of all, the slide says that "Cellceutix Acquired PolyMedix." This is not true. Cellceutix
acquired the assets of PolyMedix out of bankruptcy. But it sounds better to say that you
acquired another company instead of saying you acquired the assets from a failed
company. The press release that CTIX issued at the time tells the true story: "Cellceutix
Acquires PolyMedix Assets From Bankruptcy Court, Gains Ownership of Two Clinical
Stage Drugs, Multiple Compounds, and Equipment Assets."


And then CTIX seems to try to suggest that they acquired a company with a $227 million
market cap, but wait - that was before bankruptcy. And also that the company had and an
"Outperform rating." An outperform rating does not mean anything. CTIX tries to sweep
under the rug that they bought the assets from a failed company for $4.9 million and try to
make it look like they acquired a much larger and successful biotech company.


Kevetrin

Kevetrin is CTIX's anti-cancer drug. According to CTIX, Kevetrin has "consistently shown
activity as good or better than standard chemotherapeutic therapies, given at
approximately equitoxic doses. Kevetrin has demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy
against various carcinoma xenograft models: lung, breast, colon, prostate and squamous
cell carcinoma, and in a leukemia tumor model." This is an overview of the drug from a
slide from CTIX's presentation at the Rodman & Renshaw conference this past
September.


Source: CTIX Website


On January 20th, CTIX put out a press release claiming that a spleen lesion disappeared
in a patient with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer on a CTIX clinical trial. The press release read:


Cellceutix Reports Spleen Lesion 'Disappears' in Patient With Metastatic Stage 4 Ovarian
Cancer in Clinical Trial of Anti-Cancer Drug Kevetrin


CTIX stock went up nearly 25% that day as traders and investors were enamored with the
headline. The press release continued, saying:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2844246-cellceutix-a-december-to-remember-may-turn-into-a-2015-to-forget-for-ctix 6/37


[CTIX] is pleased to report the near complete disappearance of a metastatic lesion in
the spleen of a Stage 4 ovarian cancer patient who was enrolled in the Company's
Phase 1 clinical trial of anti-cancer drug candidate Kevetrin™ being conducted at
Harvard Cancer Center's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. According to information supplied by the hospital, the patient, who
successfully completed three Kevetrin 3-dose cycles before discontinuing the
trial, experienced increased energy, while scans showed a reduction in the amount
of peritoneal fluid (ascites) during treatment with Kevetrin. Subsequent to the second
and third Kevetrin cycles, scans showed the spleen lesion to be essentially
undetectable and the patient's disease to be clinically stable."


So CTIX's star patient has actually dropped out of the trial. I contacted Cellceutix about
this and promptly received a response from Mr. Ehrlich. He cited the press release,
saying:


The patients in our trial are incredibly sick, have often run the gamut of approved
treatments and subject to constant therapy modification to address the greatest area
of need at the given moment. That's an everyday practice in oncology, especially
when a drug regimen, such as the strict protocol with the Kevetrin trial where dosing
levels and intervals absolutely cannot be changed. We are not privy to the minutiae
underscoring any physician's decisions in a trial, but we interpret the stabilization of
the cancer as allotting the physician an opportunity to modify treatment to improve
the patient's quality of life, an opportunity that potentially may have not been there
without Kevetrin."


The Stock Promotion


I found some evidence of potentially fraudulent firms engaging in the promotion of CTIX
stock in 2014. It is important to note that I found no connection between these entities and
the company, however, I still believe it is a red flag. In January of 2014, the Swedish
Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) put out a warning to
investors about dealing with unregulated firms. The company in question here is Dyman
Associates, which according to their very vague description on their website, "is a Merger
and Acquisition Advisory Firm that has been dealing with middle-sized organizations for
numerous years in the acquisition and purchase of various businesses."


This note accused Dyman Associates of not being authorized and specifically mentioned
Cellceutix as a company that Dyman was promoting through phone calls.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2844246-cellceutix-a-december-to-remember-may-turn-into-a-2015-to-forget-for-ctix 7/37


Dyman Associates has not received authorisation from Finansinspektionen and
therefore is not entitled to provide financial services in Sweden. Finansinspektionen
has not received any notification of cross-border activities from other EEA countries.


Representatives from Dyman Associates contact Swedish investors through
unsolicited telephone calls and offer them to buy holdings of shares in a American
OTC companies such as Cellceutix.


History of Management


An article that originally appeared in INDIA New England raised questions about some of
the claims that CTIX President Krishna Menon had exaggerated some of his past. This
article by "Pump Terminator" on NNVC, where Mr. Ehrlich was CFO from 2005 to 2007,
made some interesting observations.


"routine fact-checking by INDIA New England soon revealed that the story of Krishna
Menon contained many false claims and exaggerations" - India New England Article


We noticed this story was no longer on India New England's website and some claim
it was taken down because it was false. We called India New England and here is
what we were told about the article's accuracy: "All entirely true, no question. The
only reason we took it down is the editor is no longer with us and this story caused
quite a stir, and we grew tired of all the phone calls when the editor who wrote it
doesn't even work here anymore."


I contacted Mr. Ehrlich about this and his response was that the story was removed from
the website and that should cause one to be more skeptical of it, which is a fair point.
Although it would appear that Pump Terminator has contacted INDIA New England and
that they still stand by the story. Mr. Ehrlich also highlighted that since the article
appeared, CTIX has risen 10 times.


The same article from Pump Terminator also highlighted several other discrepancies.


Amazingly we found even more examples of conflicts in what Menon has publicly
said. In his NNVC management biography he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology in
1984 from Harvard University " and yet in the CTIX management biography (where
he is President) he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology from Kerala University ". We
don't see how Menon can be telling the truth in both statements.

Note: The links from the Pump Terminator article now lead to different pages but here is a
screenshot from the NNVC website accesed via the Wayback Machine that shows Dr.
Menon saying that he received his PhD from Harvard University.


And then here is Dr. Menon saying he received his PhD from Kerala University, from the
CTIX website.


Summary


CTIX has been burning about $5 million in cash a quarter and with only $7 million in cash
as the last 10-Q, I don't see how CTIX can last much longer without doing a dilutive capital
raise. That, combined with all the other issues, could make 2015 a year to forget for CTIX
shareholders.


Disclosure: The author is short CTIX.

Lol! Exactly the sort of blogpost i'd write if I was short and running scared Cellceutix' amazing run up and good news
show won't stop soon. If you're interested in biotech companies check out CTIX and their amazing pipeline. And do
your homework but don't be fooled by gossip and innuendo like the scary story above.

The article has some inaccuracies and twists a bit. I might respond to it fully, but, don't have time to do so now.


The only thing I can see that is accurately presented in this article is the Cellceutix typo on one of their slides. The
word assets is missing. If you look at the pr's you'll see they clearly reference to the PolyMedix acquisition as an asset
purchase.

First "misleading statement" is from the "short" author Christopher Drose cites the following statement as
inaccurate:


"The acquisition, which includes laboratory equipment and other furnishings that we are confident cost in
excess of $1 million, makes us an even more formidable company."


and then sites as misleading:


'"CTIX's press release does not take into account depreciation, a very real cost for medical and laboratory
equipment."


DEPRECIATION, a tax relief gimmick, giving benefit of a write down, has NOTHING TO DO WITH, and
DOES NOT REFLECT "Market Value", "Replacement Cost", or "Cost Basis (Price Paid)" for this equipment.

Therefore, he is falsely misusing a "entry" number as "actual value" or "replacement value" of the equipment
purchased,  
By extrapolation...if Congress permitted the equipment rightdown over 1 year to stimulate the economy and it
"depreciated" for "tax purposes" only to ZERO...then we would have to say the "value" of the tangible
equipment?


...imputing as a misleading CTIX's statement...is ironic since, in fact the author's statement is the one
TOTALLY MISLEADING.


...then again...He is short and intends to manipulate...not report facts.

How in the world can Seeking Alpha publish this laughable bash and deny a much more rational positive article by
Allan Harris? What the heck is going on here?


C'mon, man! In depth analysis of accumulated Polymedix depreciation and no depth at all on the multiple trials and
drug candidates coming down the pipeline right now? And Allan Harris' article is too much of a pump?

The most annoying is that the author has absolutely no idea how FDA works and how they assign the Qualified
Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status (Brilacidin). The author did not bother to evaulate anu data from the clinical
trial (brilacidin). The authors have also NO IDEA about clinical trials and stage IV ovarian cancer. Yes, the purpose of
a Phase I clinical trial is to evaluate toxicity, patients there are terminally ill they don't expect to be cured i nthe Phase
I. Someone with a widespread ovarian cancer is in so much pain that you should be be ashamed to trivialize any
benefit that she got from an experimental drug. And lastly, the author has no idea how academic institutions (Dana-
Farber/Beth Israel at Harvard, and MD Anderson and University of Bologna) work and perform clinical trials.  
Some accusations are flat out lies. So the Indian journal took the misleading story down, because it was false, but
after the author talked to them, they say it's true, but they removed it because the editor doesn't work there
anymore??? All article true, no question, but we took it down....?


All that being said, feel free to short. I will be happy to pick up your shares

Do you have any evidence that the story was true? Actually yes I do, they took it down themselves. Journals
usually stick to their stories if they are true, particularly if the truth is juicy. Removing it because "the editor
doesn't work there anymore" is a joke that even the most anti-CTIX analyst cannot take seriously. With all due
respect, you should find other sources than India New England alone,m if you want to discredit the company. I
have nothing against a good short thesis, even when I am long. It forces me to revisit my own thesis. But you
failed (on purpose) to list any successes of the company. You failed to acknowledge the FDA QIDP tag for
Brilacidin, which makes me believe that you have no idea how FDA treats biotech companies and you have
no idea how antibiotics work. They don't give this out as a candy. You may pump and dump stocks, you may
short them and write a bashing article. But FDA actually requires real data and doesn't care whether the stock
is OTC or NASDAQ. Going to FDA with false data puts you in prison for a long time.... Kevetrin story is the
riskiest play in biotech. You could have found many (real scientific) reasons why p53 targeting drug may not
work. I can provide you some of them. There is no question this is a risky play. But the fact that a Stage IV
metastatic cancer showed ANY response to single agent therapy is amazing. It could be a coincidence, it
could be a random event, that's all fair and they need to confirm it in more patients with less progressed
cancer. But the fact you are saying that the (terminally ill) patient dropped off a trial and therefore it's a fluff
just shows you have no idea about Stage IV cancer and Phase I clinical trials.

I like how you keep jumping from one minutia to another. If you think CTIX management is fraud, I strongly
advise you to notify FDA, Harvard Medical School and MD Anderson, they obviously didn't do their research
as well as you did :).  
But you are forgetting one thing: even if only Brilacidin works, you are cooked. And from the clinical trial data,
it seems it did.

Here we go again. The news on the Stage 4 Ovarian patient was a game changer for Kevetrin and CTIX.
Although I believe Brilacidin alone is a game changer for CTIX. My opinion is the Kevetrin news was a dagger
in the short thesis. I think there are some big short bets, based on 2 fronts 1) its a small cap biotech running

out of $$$ (the basic biotech short playbook -- nothing deeper than that on analysis of the drugs in the
pipeline) 2) It became known that a patient dropped out of the trial. Although the news as to why wasn't
known until recently, the basic assumption was it is really bad, which is usually the case. I myself had doubts
about Kevetrin, very tough areas of cancer to crack. So given the leak, some big Hedgeunds, investors took
out some huge short positions-in my opinion.


Then the news came out on the patient that left the trial. This news is as big as the news AGIO's CEO had in
the New Yorker on a patient in their early trials IMHO. There is just no way to discredit how significant the
results are for a stage 4 OV patient. I can't think of a rational explanation to discredit this news other than the
patient healing on her own, which may be possible, not sure that has EVER happened. So the news is
unbelievably good, shorts are trapped, now what to do. They go back to the old playbook, how CTIX acquired
their pipeline, (“look they only paid $5M, blah blah blah” can’t be worth anything, management blah blah blah
can’t be trusted). I suppose if you find a diamond in your back yard, or Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway
when he bought it at a 20,000% discount to today can’t be worth anything right. Now they add how furniture
was acquired, lab equipment, and attacking the lead researcher who won the President’s award at LLY. 
What is very disappointing is how Seeking Alpha promotes the articles from Ben Sharvy and this anonymous
hack, and doesn’t allow credible balanced articles from Named contributors with credentials. I think we should
all write MSN and get Seeking Alpha off every link. This is just garbage at best, maybe something much
worse.

Bring on all the hit pieces that conveniently leave out compelling events and outcomes that Cellceutix has
accomplished to date. It provides opportunities for the knowledgeable investors ( that ARE cognizant of Cellceutix, its'
Leadership and Pipeline ) to buy MORE at lower prices. I will admit that I now feel very different ( negatively different )
about the objectivity of Seeking Alpha. You would not allow Alan Harris to publish his article ( you indicated too
positive ) however you publish this article. All I can say is WOW....I guess what people have been telling me for

I think a lot of these short sellers use minimally disguised names that reveal what they are up to when you do
a little unmasking - e.g., "bleaker" street, painting a bleak picture of stocks in order to drag the price down, in
the hope of escaping their sad fate as one CTIX trial after another suggests that this could be a company with
multiple blockbuster drugs.

Crimson,


Use your chart tools, RSI, MACD, and even the MFI will tell you exactly what is currently happening on any
given stock.


Another method is simple common sense. Any stock rallying over 50% in just a few short months is due for
profit taking. Short interest is also a definite marker.


Should note that an uplist to NASDAQ will draw in some institutional interest. A stock split to boost the share
price above $5 is even better.

This article does not address the science of CTIX and the institutions that have conducted much of the research. It
picks at extraneous details that do not amount to a hill of beans, and an old hill of beans at that. If you want to

Dilution is going to happen with any startup pharmaceutical, and it will periodically depress stock prices. Nobody
should invest in this kind of company thinking it's going to be a parabolic curve upward right through approval and
marketing. But the success of the trials suggests that they will not have trouble raising capital in the short term, and
they appear to be moving in the direction of a NASDAQ listing and a $5 stock price. At that point, abandon hope, all
ye who have entered short positions - hedge funds and biotech mutuals will be scratching at the door to get in, and
the $400M market cap you see today will be a thing of the past.

Hey Chris - there are two types of evidence in the law: circumstantial and direct. Nothing you stated in your article
comes anywhere near the level of being direct evidence that CTIX's science will fail.


You focused on the characterization of the depreciation of office furniture, an unregistered company... in Sweden...
pushing CTIX (without any evidence whatsoever that CTIX had anything to do with it), the fact that an anecdote is not
a statistically valid sample (yes, many of us took 
econ stats as well), and Menon's biographical misrepresentations.


If the last one was a big deal, I would think that Eli Lilly wouldn't have hired him, that his published papers (dozens)
would not have been cited, and that the Dana Farber Institute would have noticed by now as they've been testing one
of his compounds for over two years now. But I'm sure you're smarter than all of those people. You did go to Furman,
after all.

The author may want to do a little research on the company before writing this type of piece. Below was written about
a couple of the compounds the author didn't want to speak much about.


Patrick Cox - Cellceutix Continues to Push Disruptive Technologies Forward


Brilacidin: Biomimetic Breakthrough


Brilacidin is a biomimetic that copies your own body’s natural antibiotics; the defensins. As I explained in my initial
coverage, defensins are found throughout the animal kingdom, including insects. They are nature’s antibiotics and are
responsible for preventing the complete infection and death of everything.


Structurally, defensins are peptides, short amino acid chains with an electrostatic charge. Defensins attach
themselves electrostatically to bacteria and other microorganisms, including fungi and some viruses. For these
targeted microbes, this attachment is the hug of death. Once defensins are locked onto bacteria and other
microorganisms, they perforate their outer membranes. The resultant “leaks” disrupt the microorganisms’ vital
functions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2844246-cellceutix-a-december-to-remember-may-turn-into-a-2015-to-forget-for-ctix 19/37


This is one of the reason that bacteria don’t and almost certainly can’t develop resistance to defensins. Conventional
antibiotics have to penetrate bacterial cell walls, but defensins act directly on the surface membrane. To escape the
defensins, bacteria would have to evolve entirely new outer-membrane characteristics, which is nearly inconceivable
for these simple organisms.


Defensins are found in and on many human body parts including the skin, tongue, cornea, salivary glands, kidneys,
esophagus, and lungs. They form the protective barrier that prevents infection from ubiquitous bacteria. Only when
this barrier is broken can infections take place.


You’ve heard, no doubt, about flesh-eating bacteria. Various common bacteria are responsible for these infections,
called necrotizing fasciitis. One culprit in this ugly disease is Bacteroides fragilis, which naturally and harmlessly
thrives in the human colon. When the defensin barrier is intact, we’re protected from the various bacteria responsible
for necrotizing fasciitis, even if we are covered in them.


Other flesh-eating bacteria are endemic to warmer coastal waters. Normally, they are no threat. If bacteria can bypass
the defensin barrier, however, they can cause terrible problems—especially in individuals with compromised immune
systems. This usually takes place via some sort of break in the skin such as a scratch or an insect bite.


For as long as there have been humans, however, our defensins have been protecting us by killing bacteria.
Nevertheless, bacteria have never developed resistances to our defensins. Never. This is why University of
Pennsylvania scientists investigated these natural antimicrobials.


That research led to Brilacidin. As you know, the phase 2 clinical trial in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure
Infections (ABSSSI) showed us exactly what we expected. Data demonstrated that a one-time dose of Brilacidin
achieved statistically comparable efficacy to a seven-day dosing regimen for the current gold standard treatment for
ABSSSI. Moreover, bacterial resistance is developing for the best current treatments. This is not the case for
Brilacidin, nor do I believe it ever will develop resistance. The company won’t mention this last point, by the way,
because you can’t prove that someday resistance won’t emerge. Tests, however, have shown not the slightest
indication that bacteria can evolve to deal with these defensin mimetics and the basic science basically rules it out.


Perhaps the most important reason that we’ve seen Cellceutix’s stock price increase is the granting by the FDA of
Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation for Brilacidin. According to a new federal program, QIDPs
will get five additional years of market exclusivity in additional to the normal five years. QIDP-designated drug
candidates also receive priority review status, which shortens the regulatory process. So let’s review some of the
data.


On October 23, 2014, Cellceutix announced positive top-line results for the randomized double-blind study comparing
three dosing regimens of Brilacidin to daptomycin for the treatment of ABSSSI. The FDA-defined primary endpoint of
at least 20% reduction in the area of the ABSSSI lesion, relative to baseline, was achieved in all study populations at
48-72 hours, for each of the three Brilacidin dosing regimens and the active comparator, daptomycin.


In treated patients assessed at 48-72 hours, 47/51 (92.2%), 46/48 (95.8%), 51/52 (98.1%), and 45/48 (93.8%)
achieved clinical success in the Brilacidin 0.6 mg/kg single-dose group, Brilacidin 0.8 mg/kg single-dose group,
Brilacidin 1.2 mg/kg 3-day group, and daptomycin 7-day group, respectively.


The corresponding 95% confidence intervals around the clinical success rates were 85-100%, 90-100%, 94-100%,
and 87-100%, respectively. It is important to note that this phase 2b study was not powered for statistical

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2844246-cellceutix-a-december-to-remember-may-turn-into-a-2015-to-forget-for-ctix 20/37


comparisons. Nevertheless, because the 95% confidence intervals overlap, these clinical success rates are
considered similar. Regulators prefer the use of 95% confidence intervals, rather than p-values, when comparing
efficacy rates in clinical trials, as they can provide more information than p-values. A much larger study—such as the
kind done in phase 3—would have the power to make statistical comparisons.


On December 22, 2014, Cellceutix also reported positive results in the Microbiological Intent-to-Treat (MITT)
population. This is an important population that includes patients with baseline cultures positive for common ABSSSI
pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In this
population, clinical success rates at 48-72 hours were again very high (above 90% across all treatment groups) and
again very similar (with overlapping 95% confidence intervals).


Clinical trials for Brilacidin-OM for Oral Mucositis are set to enter phase 2 soon. Procedural work is being conducted
at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and other sites participating in the study. These indications are,
however, only the tip of the iceberg. Once Brilacidin is approved for any indication, we would expect it to progress
quickly into other markets with potential big pharm partnerships.


Kevetrin News


Brilacidin and its many future variants are enough IP for one company, but Cellceutix has several other big platforms.
Kevetrin is an anticancer drug that activates the p53 “guardian angel” gene, which repairs the genome. As such, all
cancers disable the p53 gene. By reactivating it, as Kevetrin does, we can turn on the body’s primary defense against
mutations.


I won’t go in-depth into Kevetrin now, but the drug is showing an excellent safety profile going into its tenth cohort. At
Biotech Showcase several weeks ago, the company presented an example of a stage 4 cancer patient with a
significant result. In the ninth cohort, dosed at 350 mg/m2 once weekly, a 57-year-old female with metastatic ovarian
carcinoma (lesions in colon and spleen) and ascites requiring weekly paracentesis demonstrated the complete
absence of previously scanned lesions. Also, preliminary data show that 50% of patients treated with Kevetrin through
the eighth cohort demonstrated enhancement in expression of p53 in peripheral blood cells.


Those observations appeared dose-related. A phase 1b on AML cancers conducted by the University of Bologna is
set to begin at high dosage levels based on the safety data that has now been generated.

Patrick Cox may or may not be credible. I, too, would question anyone who says PVCT has great science. Dr

a big winner for CTIX.


23 Jan 2015, 07:13 PM


BioDD
Here are some other comments from a knowledgeable and successful investor that has been following it since
2011....


Cellceutix just reported that in its 9th cohort a spleen lesion metastasis has been stabilized in a stage 4 Ovarian
cancer patient. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynecological cancers and is one of the leading causes of cancer-
related death in women. This is a big breakthrough in cancer research as Kevetrin is only in a Phase 1 safety study
and researchers are not looking for tumor shrinkage. Kevetrin is unlike any other chemotherapy or immunotherapy
compounds, it is non genotoxic with no hematological, hepatic, or renal toxicity in patients. As a completely new class
of chemistry in medicine, Kevetrin has significant potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of solid
tumors. Mechanism of action studies showed Kevetrin's unique ability to affect both wild and mutant types of p53
(often referred to as the "Guardian Angel Gene" or the "Guardian Angel of the Human Genome") and that Kevetrin
strongly induced apoptosis (cell death). p53 is an important tumor suppressor that acts to restrict proliferation by
inducing cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, or cellular senescence. Dana Farber has just approved dosing to
450mg/m2 as well as asked the company to prepare a publication.


Cellceutix is not a one trick pony like 99.9% of the biotech company's out there. They also have a drug called
Brilacidin. Brilacidin is a revolutionary drug in that it is a platform for many indications. It is a first-in-class small
molecule in a completely novel class of drug called defensin-mimetic. The drug has a unique mechanism of action to
imitate the body's front-line immunological defense, meaning that it selectively targets and destroys bacteria and not
mammalian cells. Brilacidin is rapidly bactericidal which means it decreases the chance of the bacteria becoming
resistant. Clinical trials and laboratory research showed Brilacidin as a disruptive technology that demonstrated

potent, broad-spectrum activity against multiple Gram-positive pathogens as well as Gram-negative pathogens.
Brilacidin has just successfully completed a Phase 2B clinical trial for ABSSSI showing a one-time dose of Brilacidin
achieving statistically comparable results to the seven-day dosing regimen for the current gold standard treatment for
ABSSSI, which sells about $1 billion a year of their drug, branded as Cubicin. In early December, Brilacidin received
the coveted FDA QIDP designation. Also, Brilacidin is set to begin a Phase 2 clinical trial for Brilacidin-OM, an oral
rinse for the prevention of Oral Mucositis (OM). This is very significant as there currently are no prophylaxes for OM,
positioning Cellceutix as having a potential monopoly for the millions of sufferers of OM each year.


Let us also not forget about Prurisol, Cellceutix anti-Psoriasis drug that just successfully completed a Phase 1
crossover trial and is set to begin a Phase 2/3 clinical trial as treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis.


Cellceutix now has been aggressively moving forward with Kevetrin, Brilacidin, and Prurisol. Putting conservative
values on Cellceutix's drugs at their current stages of development. I would place a $500 million conservative
valuation on Kevetrin considering both the positive news being released from its clinical trial as well as the multi-billion
dollar valuations of early stage immunotherapy cancer therapies, an additional $500 million for Brilacidin (just for the
ABSSSI indication) as Brilacidin is potentially the best gram positive antibiotic out there and also considering Merck's
$9.5 Billion dollar acquisition of Cubist as well as Durata Therapeutics being acquired for over $600 million dollars. I
would place an additional $200 million dollar valuation on its other compounds as they are set to begin Phase 2

What sophomoric garbage this article is. Complete waste of time reading it. They accounted wrong for $300k in
furniture? Really? What a joke, talk about missing the forest for the trees....


"But it sounds better to say that you acquired another company instead of saying you acquired the assets from a
failed company."


Too funny. Great analysis.

Cellceutix CEO Leo Ehrlich has been very approachable. It's not surprising to see attempts to launch short attacks
during lulls between events. CTIX is one of the top performing stocks on the OTC. Certainly not the highest priced
OTC, but one of the most active. And with plenty of volatility. 
It is amusing however to see the authors correspondence leave out some tidbits. As I mentioned, Mr. Ehrlich is very
approachable and willing to correspond with various writers. The content mentioned in this article differs from what
was actually "sent". Here it is as it was intended and also was posted on IHUB by KarinCA. I edited the author as
"Contributor" to protect identity.


Leo Ehrlich provided me (KarinCA) with actual correspondence...


FROM "Contributor":


Hello,  
I am a writer from the investment website Seeking Alpha. I am examining CTIX and have some questions. In your last
press release it said that the patient had quit the trial even though her tumor (It was a metastasized spleen lesion)
disappeared. Can you share what the reason for the patient leaving the study is.


LEO EHRLICH RESPONSE:


Hi "contributor",


From the 1/20/15 press release:

"I can't overexpress the excitement at Cellceutix regarding Kevetrin or the significance of a metastatic lesion
disappearing in a late-stage ovarian cancer patient," commented Leo Ehrlich, Chief Executive Officer at Cellceutix.
"We don't know of any other company, regardless of specialization, albeit small molecule, immunotherapy or other,
that has published an effect like that in such a hard-to-treat disease like metastatic ovarian cancer during a Phase 1
safety trial. The idea that a stage 4 ovarian cancer patient's disease was clinically stabilized, although her CA-125
count was increased in the third month, is remarkable. The patients in our trial are incredibly sick, have often run the
gamut of approved treatments and subject to constant therapy modification to address the greatest area of need at
the given moment. That's an everyday practice in oncology, especially when a drug regimen, such as the strict
protocol with the Kevetrin trial where dosing levels and intervals absolutely cannot be changed. We are not privy to
the minutiae underscoring any physician's decisions in a trial, but we interpret the stabilization of the cancer as
allotting the physician an opportunity to modify treatment to improve the patient's quality of life, an opportunity that
potentially may have not been there without Kevetrin."


"Contributor":


I also came across this article about misleading claims from Cellceutix management. I understand this was a long
time ago but would like to get a comment from the company.


LEO EHRLICH RESPONSE:


The article was taken off the web by the publisher/writer. As a writer that should warn you about its reliability. Since
that article first appeared our stock has increased about 10 times. The facts are Dr Khorana and Dr. Frei were
founding shareholders of CTIX. They appear on the official Stock Transfer company's records at the time Cellceutix
was formed; Dr Frei was a very close advisor to the Company and I visited him a number of times at his daughters
home in Illinois; His children are friends of CTIX to this day. Dr Menon, out of tens of thousands of employees at Lilly,
received the Presidents Award.


Cellceutix has multiple clinical trials ongoing at premier institutions. We have some of the brightest minds in the US
assisting us from our Scientific advisory committee to world class consultants and employees. We have novel
platforms possibly enabling us to become world leaders in oncology and anti infective medicines. Cellceutix now has
over $11 million in the bank. We have announced we signed a material transfer agreement with one of the world's
largest pharmas. The gram positive market is very hot with the recent takeovers in this space. We have possibly the
worlds leading gram positive drug which has just successfully completed a phase 2 clinical trial. The great thing for
our shareholders is we have so much news coming out continuously during the next month(s). We have doubled our
stock price about every 1.5 years and we hope to continue that pattern.


Sincerely,


Leo


----------


I look forward to further articles on Cellceutix and even more so for updates to come from the company. Very much
looking forward to their meeting in Europe in April for Brilacidin. Best of luck to everyone. 
My disclosure should be apparent, LONG CTIX.

Thank-you for reposting the actual email from Leo. I have made a copy as many should and keep reposting

It is sad that seeking alpha is a front for stock manipulators, who care little about the truth and only want to
profit from mis-representation of company details. I suggest that Allan Harris's article be posted if SA has any
sense of fair play and integrity.


Truly sad to see the misrepresentation from what is suppose to be impartial news outlets. No wonder Yahoo
no longer carries their posts.

As a disclaimer, I am long CTIX and up until now I have been very impressed with the science behind their various
compounds. Most notably, I have been under the impression that the cancer compund, Kevetrin, and the antibiotic,
Brilacidin, both show strong evidence of efficacy and that they are safe. I have been impressed with management's
ability to drive the company forward without very much dilution.


Today, I realize that this was all smoke and mirrors and that I have been wrong.


I especially like the part where the office furniture is put under scrutiny. That was an eye opener for me. Never would I
have gotten the ida of researching such a vital and important part of the business. I now fear that the latest surge in
share price was not due to the FDA granting Brilacidin QIDP designation but merely a matter of speculation based on
an unrealistic valuation of the 25 hight adjustable desks and the almost new canteen vending machine.

To summarize your article: 
1. They left out the word "assets" on the slide indicating how they obtained PolyMedix's IP and that they may have
overstated the value of some lab equipment, even though 
they provided full disclosure in their press releases. 
2. Kevetrin is no good because one patient discontinued the trial for personal reasons. 
3. An unregulated pumper promoted the stock, even though it had no connection to the company. 
4. An article questioning management's credentials written several years ago that has since been removed from the
website should be cause for concern about the credentials of CTIX management. 
5. They are burning cash too fast and will have to dilute.


I'd say that this article is concentrating completely on the wrong things. When investing in a developmental stage
biotech, the most important items to identify are the following: 
1. What drug or drugs does the company have in its pipeline and how far along are they?  
2. How is management planning on continuing to fund the company?


Let's answer these questions: CTIX has three drugs, Brilacidin, which recently completed a succesful Phase 2B trial,  
Kevetrin, still in a Phase 1 trial at Dana-Farber, a world-class cancer research insitution, and  
Prurisol, which recently successfully completed a Phase 1 safety trial. 
You can verify this progress independantly at: http://1.usa.gov/1zE7jBj


As for financing, they currently have agreements with Aspire Capital to purchase shares as well as a shelf agreement
to raise capital. 
Partnership for Brilacidin is likely in the near future (6 months or so), which should provide regular income. 
Even at their current burn rate, at its current price, CTIX could dilute with about 1.5 million shares (about 1% of the
OS) per quarter, which overall has a low impact to the company.


Full disclosure: I'm long CTIX.

Dear Mr/s Bleecker 
Care to comment on any of the following links below? Some of the actual science behind Brilacidin (QIDP designation
by FDA for ABSSSI) via CELLCEUTIX's asset purchase of Polymedix. It might take some time, putting on the thinking
cap, but after performing additional DD, I think (hope) you'll see the company has legs -- even if the depreciating
value of some of the office furniture seems to have caused you considerable concern. Thought also worth posting
another take on Kevetrin, since a healthy exchange is always advisable when it comes to investing----knowing what
you own----no? 
Regards, and look forward to your take on the merits of the science.

I've been trading in biotechs for quite some time now and every single one of them has message boards full of people
who claim that their company's science is going to change the world and that large amounts of cash are just sitting on
the sidelines waiting to buy this company up. It's really fun and easy to get wrapped up in that and imagine the new
beach house you're going to buy when the stock is up 10,000%, but which of the following do you think is more likely:


- That a small biotech company scooped up a multi-billion dollar antibiotic for pennies, while every other pharma
company on earth missed it.


- Or that a company that admittedly has had some small successes, but who has yet to make a single cent might just
be a tad overvalued and overhyped at $500 million dollars.


I'll put my money on the non-stupid side. It almost seems like everyone in this stock knows they're just throwing
money away, but it's just more fun to play fantasy and freak out at people with a short thesis.

mjl962, 
Its not the actual shorting that gets traders & investors upset; yes, you are correct and shorting an over-
extended biotech as a TRADE is not the issue, nor a bad strategy. The issue is contributors ( & I use that term
loosely ) like Bleeker St and Ben Sharvy is basing their short thesis on the distortion of facts regarding the
science, innuendo, and a twisting of the company disclosures and actions. Is CTIX ultimately going to be the
next Amgen? Longs can only hope. But it has become increasingly apparent that its not a SCAM or a
FRAUD. It's just another speculative biotech worth taking a shot with. Disclosure: I am long CTIX, have taken
profits from a cost basis in the mid $1.70's, and have not, nor ever, received any compensation from SA for
expressing my opinion.

managed.

Polymedix went broke b/c they mismanaged (manipulated, some would say) expectations FOR ANOTHER
DRUG, NOT BRILACIDIN (http://bit.ly/1JKHjGA).


It was a blood-clotting drug that led to their downfall, not B.

Polymedix went under because it was an reverse merger scam with worthless assets and a shareholder base
of suckers.


If Brilacidin had any value at all it would never have ended up with Polymedix, and then would never had
been bought by CTIX.


You do know that the CTIX was the ONLY bidder for the Polymedix assets, right? The ONLY ONE. Every
legitimate company in the industry passed. Every single one.

BuyersStrike: you should be adviser for FDA. I think they really don't know what they are doing granting
Brilacidin the Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status based on clinical trials results alone. I mean,
you are so much more informed than they are and who knows what FDA based their decision on. Maybe Leo
just smooth talked them into it....? A person so deeply educated in these matters and so unbiased could save
many patients :).

To me the evidence for the efficacy of Kevetrin falls short of convincing, AT THIS TIME, and it would be wise, in my
opinion for the company to stop commenting on what may be significant events, but, which may not. The fact that the
trials (admittedly with very difficult tumor and patient circumstances) continue at these prestigious institutions, is a
positive, but, we should wait for trial evaluations to draw conclusions. The pre-clinical studies on Kevetrin, did not go
far enough, in my opinion, but, showed, at least short term efficacy against several tumor types. There may need to
be combination, add-on therapy, as alluded to by Cellceutix management. 
The evidence for Brilacidin being a potential blockbuster, in light of its ability to achieve, in a single dose, what the
primary comparator required 7 days to do, is very exciting to me and to those who may benefit in the future. Add to
that the broad spectrum potential of treating both gram positive and negative bacteria, as well as fungi, and you have
a true breakthrough drug. Pre-clinical studies on Prurisol showed clear efficacy, which, hopefully, will be proved in
humans.

Dana Farber is keeping the data very close. What little information Leo gets, he runs with it. Moving to the
10th cohort is pretty significant in itself. Quite possibly the news about the one patient would get out and be
misconstrued. Leo put it on the table for all to see, at least with what he was given. May be a bit over zealous
in some of his press releases but in my opinion not misleading as this "writer" would want us to believe.
Things can get tweaked along the way as we well know. I think we're surpassing the expectations of the
primary goals of PH1 and touching all the secondary's listed on the clinical trial objectives 
Brilacidin is showing excellent potential and I think it will be well received in Europe at the conference this
spring.


An excellent team that is building into a future very nicely with an exceptional pipeline.

Small Pharma Analyst, Contributor
Micro, 
I think you summarized well. Too much showmanship with management - let the science speak for itself.
Does management really need to start a press release with "I can't overexpress the excitement at Cellceutix?"


QIDP designation for brilacidin is huge for the company - instant credibility. More importantly it gives them an
extra 5 years of patent life. The composition of matter patent on brilacidin expires in 2020 which would have
meant brilacidin would have been facing generic competition shortly after launch. Now it has a chance to be a
commercial success and likely more interesting to mid- or large pharma.

The results of the patient dropping out of the trial is not showmanship. It came from the researchers
overseeing the trial assessing the patient's condition and data that must be provided to the FDA. There is a
legal obligation to publish this type of data after each Cohort good or bad. Think about it trials are halted,
stopped until the FDA examines the data on a patient trial exit trigger. Sounds like you don't know how trials
are conducted.

I think the article raised one good point that merits concern but over-reached on the other points; the author is too
bearish, just as some commenters here may be uncautiously bullish at the moment. (Disclosure: I am long the stock.)
The lie about Dr. Menon's "Harvard" academic credentials is indefensible, and I note that management did not
respond to it. Nevertheless, this company is showing incredible results on Brilacidin, has sound science behind

Kevetrin that merits the interest it is generating, and Prurisol shows promise. The company is being taken seriously by
almost everyone except the author, Mr. Bleeker, but his thin short thesis will do nothing to change that. A
disappointing SA article for this serious investor.

frrol... click on the link claiming to show that Dr Menon lied about his credentials. You'll find the section was
quoted from an erroneous article without the author looking at the link. I've reported it to SA as a link that
doesn't show what it's supposed to. Hopefully, the author or SA take it out.


I checked into this when the first erroneous article came out and decided that the mistake on the other site
wasn't Dr Menon's. And, it was not only corrected, it was taken out completely.


Brilacidin having successfully, completed a phase IIb with one dose for one day vs daptomycin twice daily 7
days dosage is what most are looking at when they bid the price up. That and the QIDP designation.
Brilacidin should have a phase III ABSSSI trial starting soon. Based on the data out thus far on the phase IIa
and the phase IIb there is a 98% probability this phase III will be successful. That's still not a guarantee, but, I
like the odds. Brilacidin has substantially derisked this investment.


The science is what will make or break this company.


Kevetrin phase I data slowly coming out is looking promising, but, it's too early to say how that story ends.


Aspire was at the Biotech Showcase and is willing to give Cellceutix more capital if they should want it.


There is a shelf in place to raise more funds if needed. Interestingly, Cellceutix isn't paying for all of the trials.
For example, the upcoming Kevetrin trial at the University of Bologna will be covered by the University.
Cellceutix only provides the Kevetrin.

Kevetrin news is Novel, breakthrough type news. Granted we won't really know until we get a full picture from
trial data, but trust me its very big. There was a lot of uncertainty on Kevertrin with the cancers they are
targeting. You can blindly make short bets on biotechs targeting these cancers and be rewarded >90+ % of
the time. This news was a huge de-risking of Kevetrin, and probability success models would increase the
present value considerably. IMHO.

Judging by the furious, accusatory, blanket dismissals of this article you ought to know that a lot of them
exceed the rules of fair debate established by SA. If you don't like it then don't comment. Otherwise tailor your
comments to be a tad civil and decent. Or go to the Yahoo swampboards where you can say anything you
like.

Geez didn't think they were any more un-civil than others. Help me out, do these sound better?


Author, your focus on the past acquisition of furniture was a bit off base. Please don't be offended! If you
could next time, would you add some analysis on the drug's in the pipeline, and there potential? Thanks!


Or how about this one. Author, your accusations on Dr. Menon, I believe are out of line, and shouldn't be
discussed given the present decorum of Seeking Alpha contributors, and fellow followers. I would if I may
extend that to your accusations of the management team. Please don't be offended by my suggestions --
Author, I couldn't come up with a better word than accusations.


Is that better? BTW, I hear SA is coming out with another slam on Monday, hope that isn't true. If they do it
tells you how the recent-Kevetrin news really puts their short positions in one heck 
of a bind.

"Dr." Menon's past, and tenuous grip on the truth, is extremely relevant. (I, for one, do not believe he even
has one PhD., let alone 2). Especially as his KARD Scientific entity (named for himself and his family, Krishna
Anita Rajah Dorrett) sucks money quietly out of both CTIX and sister company NNVC.


25 Jan 2015, 06:40 PM

Prove it, show us some credible evidence. If you can't you shouldn't post here anymore.


Meanwhile, CTIX did prove something to the FDA, QIDP. B is all it takes my friend for this to be a winner.

the word today (January 26) is that CTIX is applying to uplist to the NASDAQ---I'm sure based on this very

BuyersStrikeWP... most of the information regarding Dr Menon putting out false information is incorrect. I
researched it a couple of years ago when this first surfaced. Apparently, the article in India that came out with
some major falsehoods was pulled. And, then there was some confusion in the translations from English to
Indian and back again to English in a publication that posted his credentials. Dr Mennon was at Dana Farber
at the time ... Harvard. Then, to compound matters it was picked up in an online resume that nnvc produced
when he was doing some work for them with his CRO KARD. That resume has since been pulled.


In the meantime, the incorrect resume from that site has been copied around the net and gone viral. The
correct resume is on the Cellceutix site. It's really a shame to see it printed again in Seeking Alpha. The
article should be pulled.

Author’s reply »  KarinCA,


The title of the publication is INDIA New England. They cover what is happening generally in the business
world in New England. The articles are not written first in India. They are written by in-house reporters and
there is absolutely no translation, therefore there is no room for something to get lost in translation.

@KarinCA, nice try, but even CTIX's own filings show two different versions of Krishna Scamon's resume.

These attacks at CTIX, Leo Ehrlich and Krishna Menon come in yearly cycles. Always the same recycled information:
Leo is not a manager, Menon is not a scientist, CTIX stuff is all smoke and mirrors. When you look at short attacks at
CTIX 2 years ago, there are no different than today. They all assume that academic institutions using CTIX
compounds for clinical trials (Dana Farber, MD Anderson, University of Bologna) and at this point FDA (granting the
QIDP tag for Brilacidin) are fools who need to be brought to reason by investigative shorts. The sad part is that they
do a lousy job dissecting the real risks of an OTC early biotech company. 
I would be able to put together a better short thesis based on previous failures of p53 targeting drugs by other

companies and the competition in the antibiotic space.  
So to me all of that made very little sense so far. Furthermore, building a short attack at a ~$4 OTC stock to me
seems quite ludicrous. Limited potential reward combined with high costs of such a short position... Aren't there more
overpriced stocks to short, with a biggest potential downfall and bigger volume? So my thinking now is, that those
"shorts" are actually not shorting anything. These investigative pieces probably serve to scare people off and for
someone to gobble up the shares.  
I know risks of the biotech well enough to know what a real risk of CTIX is. And furniture depreciation is not one of
them.

Matija, always appreciate your articles...because they are well thought out. I think it could very well be what
you are saying. If you noticed these posters are carry overs from NNVC and prior. It could be they shorted
and lost big, or it could be a Hedgefund shorted NNVC and piior Co's and got burned and they want revenge.
It seems personal, and not rationale. I short stocks too, but I am very careful, CTIX would not be a stock I
would consider shorting. When I lose $$$, I just move on, busines is business. These guys are taking it
personally and really stretch what they call evidence. I really think they believe it is evidence, because is
supports their feelings, notice I said feelings. Or as you say, the tree is being shaken for shares. I've been
loading up., was very concerned about Kevetrin prior to the news, and thought the shorts could very well be
right on that drug, but the news really turn out to be great news. I really was playing CTIX for the antibiotic
play like I have done with Trius, DRTX, TTPH, and CEMP. Kevetrin now maybe their lead drug.

Your right Huskers 123, I am with your words 100%. Wait until someone famous ask for compassionate
utilization of Kevetrin or enters a trial.


I believe that Steve Jobs, would be alive had he known about Kevetrin. Coretta Scott King, had Ovarian
Cancer when she died of respiratory related issues, remember K recently did a notable job healing a woman
with Ovarian cancer. Warren Buffett took a many radiation treatments to beat prostate cancer. With Kevetrin
he may not have missed more than a day of work and been without any side effects,


It is only a short amount of time before Kevetrin, is actually intertwined into the flow of current events, similar
to the way I am suggestively superimposing it on the past.

Actually, I sold back in January, but will very likely get back in before the end of the year. Their antibiotic is a
very good one and justifies more than the current share price; I'm much more non-committal re. the rest of the
pipeline but it comes as a bonus. It's all about timing and picking the winners in microcap developmental
biotech. Brilacidin is a winner, but it was time to sell for now in January.
