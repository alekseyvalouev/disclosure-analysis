Heading Into 2014, Shorts Return With A Vengeance
Dec. 23, 2013 7:27 AM ET35 comments
by: Richard Pearson


The year 2013 will be remembered as a very painful one for anyone who was short just
about anything. Dedicated short funds got clobbered while even long/short funds found
that their massive losses on soaring short positions greatly curtailed what should have
been a stellar year on the long side.


But now the shorts appear to be coming back with a vengeance. And recent trades show
that the shorts have been doing well in publicly exposing troubled companies where they
suspect substantial overvaluation, evidence of excess promotion and, in some cases,
fraud.


Many institutions are now realizing that in a very toppy market, finding that next long trade
that will go up by 50% or more is now extremely difficult. By contrast, finding overvalued
and troubled companies which should quickly fall by 50% is now quite easy. They are
everywhere.


As a result, many institutions are getting much more vocal about their favorites short
trades while research efforts are being increasingly devoted to short ideas.


My inbox is now brimming with some very impressive short ideas which get submitted to
me from all over. Many of these appear quite compelling, so I expect I will be very busy
publishing as soon as the holidays are done.


But for now, I take a look at some of the more compelling short calls that are still in play,
including Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO), Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS), Renewable
Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) and Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK).


Organovo


Organovo is a $700 million market cap reverse merger. Several years ago, Organovo
acquired several pieces of IP for just tens of thousands of dollars each. The company
spends an average of $1.5 million per quarter on R&D. Even its own management expects
no commercial revenue until December 2014 (at best). At that time, revenues may
eventually ramp to "tens of millions of dollars", which would potentially justify a $3.00
share price, but certainly not more. Yet actual timing for this eventual ramp is unclear.

In the last quarter, grant and collaboration revenue was a mere $23,000. Not surprisingly,
management has been selling millions of dollars worth of stock in just the past few months
while filing to sell millions of new shares by the company as well. Meanwhile the company
has institutional ownership of only 13.43%, while a large chunk of the company is held by
retail investors who appear convinced that they will become obscenely wealthy when this
company eventually fulfills its futuristic destiny of "3D bio-printing" fully useable human
organs. I have been active in Organovo for most of the year and I enjoy the fact that I
have been one of just a few people to WRITE ABOUT the short thesis this year. Back in
November, the stock traded to just shy of $14.00 (exceeding well over $1 billion in market
cap), but following my last article the shares fell by around 40% to around $8.00. They
have currently bounced slightly and trade for $8-9. I am still short.


Unilife


In contrast to Organovo, it seems that everyone who has ever shorted a stock has
recently SHORTED UNILIFE. They have also invariably felt compelled to publicly tell the
world why this is such a compelling short. When this many parties are short a stock, na√Øve
investors may be tempted to play it for a short squeeze. But given the size and
commitment of the institutions involved, they likely have ample staying power to simply
short more if Unilife rises some. The near term catalyst for Unilife is a desperately needed
equity offering as the company runs out of cash. This may see the share price quickly
drop by around 20-30%. But the real catalyst will be the ultimate resolution of litigation
alleging massive fraud against investors. This is the black swan event that has the
potential to send Unilife to zero on short notice. A copy of the current legal filings in these
fraud suits can be found at my website moxreports.com. Anyone who is long or short
Unilife should certainly feel obligated to at least read these legal filings.


Investors who are long Unilife should take pause to consider whether or not they should
care about the institutions who are vocally short Unilife:


Why should investors care what Whitney Tilson says?


Tilson has been on a roll lately with his public short trades. Names like Questcor (QCOR),
Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL), K12 Inc (NYSE:LRN) and InterOil (NYSE:IOC) have often
shown moderate drops following his announcement of a short position, but have then
gone on to drop by 30-60% in subsequent weeks. According to headlines, Tilson referred
to Unilife as "an obvious fraud". This is the oldest trick in the book for short sellers. If a
short is confident that a company is committing fraud, he makes a loud public statement of
this. He is hoping and praying that the company will sue him such that he can get legal

discovery in court. This is why troubled companies almost never sue their accusers. In any
event, investors should now be quite concerned that Unilife does not feel any need to take
action against (or even respond to) parties who make such aggressive public statements.
But of course, just because Whitney Tilson is short Unilife does not mean it will go down
by 50-100%.


Why should investors care what "The Street Sweeper" says?


According to its website, "The Street Sweeper" has published nine short reports in 2013.
Only one of these stocks has gone up since the report. (Ticker SGMO is up by around
12%). Other stocks have fallen by 20-95% following Street Sweeper reports. Unilife
investors may also wish to take note of the fact that The Street Sweeper published reports
on both Revolution Lighting (NASDAQ:RVLT) and Coronado Biosciences (CNDO). These
risky reverse mergers were highlighted as great long picks by Unilife promoters Tech Guru
and The Focused Stock Trader. The reports from The Street Sweeper did not cause
immediate drops in these stocks. Instead, the subsequent events, which were described
by the Street Sweeper, caused these stocks to fall by 30-80% in subsequent weeks. But of
course, as with Tilson above, just because Street Sweeper is short Unilife does not mean
it will go down by 50-100%.


Why should investors care what Kerrisdale Capital says?


Kerrisdale Capital's website simply states that "We make value-oriented investments in
public securities". But what many investors may not realize is that Kerrisdale made the
bulk of its fortune almost entirely by shorting frauds and presumably playing many of them
to near zero. I first heard of Kerrisdale a few years ago following their scathing short report
on China Education Alliance (formerly CEU). The report was so aggressive that I felt it
simply must have been overstated. Further research on my part revealed that this "hedge
fund", Kerrisdale, was based in New York and did not demonstrate any China specific
credentials. The credentials of the "investigators" that it had employed in China were also
not clear. Kerrisdale's assets under management of just a few million dollars at the time
hardly qualified it to be called a "hedge fund" in my view. I flew to Harbin, China for a week
to evaluate a potential long investment in the stock which had been beaten down following
Kerrisdale's report. I found that Kerrisdale was wrong. Kerrisdale had stated that CEU was
"mostly a hoax". Instead, my work on the ground revealed that CEU was in fact "entirely a
hoax". It would have been laughable had it not been so criminal. Investors need to
remember that at the time, CEU had been listed on the New York Stock exchange and
had at times been valued at over $200 million. They continuously made the rounds and
had been featured at all of the popular investment conferences of the time. They had been

perceived as an entirely legitimate company until they were exposed by Kerrisdale. The
company was subsequently delisted from the NYSE (even after its auditor had confirmed
its "enhanced cash verification" procedures at CEU).


Kerrisdale went on to become a prominent short seller of fraudulent companies and based
on that success grew from a tiny $2 million fund to reportedly over $100 million in around
2 years. Although Kerrisdale is not a dedicated short fund, they are regarded as one fund
that originally rose to prominence purely off the back of their expertise in shorting
fraudulent companies. So now we have Tilson, Street Sweeper and Kerrisdale all
convinced of an imminent plunge in this controversial stock. But of course none of this
guarantees that they are all right.


Renewable Energy Group


This is perhaps my favorite among under-followed shorts. There is so much nonsense
going on here that I expect this stock will drop by at least 50% during the month of
January. The only risk is that the trade may get crowded as the stock falls to around
$7.00, such that further declines may end up being a bit slower. In any event, the trade is
a low risk short without any meaningful upside catalyst in the foreseeable future.


Prescience Investment Group was the first one out of the gates to highlight the short
thesis on this stock. I am now joining the battle cry on this short trade, but based on new
and very different issues. As with Unilife, I expect that this will quickly become a favorite
short trade among investors.


Prescience highlighted the fact that REG is heavily dependent upon tax credits which
expire on December 31st, 2013. In years past, without such credits, revenue sat at around
$100-200 million. At that time, REG (as expected) lost money and burned cash. But the
extension of these generous credits allowed REG to swell revenue to over $1 billion. The
firm became profitable and cash flow positive. It should be fairly transparent what will
happen as soon as these credits expire in just a few more trading days. REG will return to
a troubled state of losing money and burning cash.


Some who are long this stock are clinging to hope that Congress will simply change its
mind and renew the credits in 2015 or 2016. After a year or two of losses and cash burn,
they hope the government handouts will continue to provide support to REG. This is
extremely unlikely. The past extensions were simply stapled on to an unrelated fiscal cliff
bill as "pork" by affected states. The urgency of the fiscal cliff made this easy to slip in.
Unfortunately the tax credits are largely uneconomic and most people (including
Congress) now understand that the full "carbon footprint" of producing, converting and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1912331-heading-into-2014-shorts-return-with-a-vengeance 5/22


transporting biofuels greatly reduces their relative benefit. The size of that relative benefit
had previously been considered to be much larger and made it easier for members of
Congress to overlook the poor economics of the tax credit. It is now no longer easy for
them to overlook such uneconomic and wasteful government spending.


More recently, significant attention to fraud and diversion by those in the biofuels industry
also makes it much harder for Congress to allow another tax extension to slip into any
unrelated bills. As noted in the Daily Caller just a few days ago, "Fraud! EPA finds 33.5
million more fake biodiesel credits". A host of similar articles can be found with a simple
Google search. The point from all of this is that we should now expect much greater
resistance from members of Congress when individual senators try to slip in these
extensions as part of "pork" amendments into unrelated bills.


Prescience also points out that insiders have been aggressively selling ahead of this
expiration, with the two largest shareholders unloading $50 million in stock in just the past
few months, and (of course) ahead of the tax credit expiration.


I was slow to get involved in this trade due to other projects. What finally caught my
attention was the company's recent acquisition of Syntroleum (NASDAQ:SYNM) last
week, which REG rushed to complete before the tax credit expired (and while their share
price was still in the double digits).


To me, it is this acquisition which seals the deal on REG as a short trade. Investors in
REG may wish to strongly reconsider their enthusiasm for the acquisition of Syntroleum
for over $40 million.


Earlier in 2013, Syntroleum had traded down to just 35 cents, but it conducted a 1:10
reverse split in order to avoid a delisting.


This is not surprising given that the company's only plant has been completely shuttered
and without any production whatsoever since October 2012.


Syntroleum operates via a joint venture with Tyson Foods via a JV called Dynamic Fuels.


Syntroleum filings reveal the following:


Primarily as a result of the extended period the Plant has been in standby
mode, Dynamic Fuels determined that the carrying amount of the Plant may
not be recoverable.

Depending on whether or not the plant is restarted, the company will reassess potential for
recoverability and any potential impairment.


Syntroleum is actually in the business "renewable diesel" not "biodiesel." REG is only
involved in actual "biodiesel". Investors need to understand that these two products
comprise entirely and radically different technologies which are in no way compatible.
There are no synergies in the technology whatsoever.


The facilities of REG and Syntroleum are also on opposite sides of the country, with
Syntroleum's only plant (the shuttered one) being in Louisiana. So there are no synergies
with respect to their geographic locations either.


So why did REG suddenly rush to pay a massive premium for an acquisition of a no-
revenue, non-producing nano-cap which had been facing delisting? It is simple. REG likely
knows (as its largest shareholders do) that the share price is likely to begin a steady
descent in January. With the share price above $10 at present, the stock serves as a
valuable acquisition currency and it needed to be used before the share price declines.
When the share price falls to $5.00 or below, such an acquisition becomes entirely too
dilutive.


Both that major shareholders and REG as a company are eager to trade shares of REGI
for something which may retain some value after December 31st. The shareholders sold,
trading their shares for cash. REG issued more shares in exchange for an acquisition,
hoping that it will retain at least more value than a falling share price.


It may be the case that in future years, "renewable diesel" becomes a far more viable
product that simple "biodiesel". This is the lottery ticket that REG decided to purchase
while it still had the buying power of a high share price. It is clear that when things become
bad, management teams (at all companies, not just REG) often feel the pressure to "do
something ‚Ä¶ do anything !". And this is how I view the Syntroleum acquisition.


Even though this short trade is patently obvious, the stock has yet to exhibit a meaningful
decline. We have seen this repeatedly in 2013. Many investors simply wait until AFTER a
negative catalyst emerges and drives the stock lower, rather than selling in advance of a
negative catalyst. They then sell at a substantial loss which could have easily been
avoided. The $50 million in recent sales (in advance of the tax credit expiration) by REG's
major shareholders suggest that they are a bit more pragmatic than less informed 3rd
party shareholders.

The last short report from Prescience affiliates was Fleetmatics Group PLC (NYSE:FLTX).
By the time I finished reading this report in September, the stock was already down by
around 25% that day so I decided not to chase it further. But Fleetmatics is headquartered
in Ireland, so before the US markets opened on day two I was able to speak with company
representatives in Ireland and I learned that they had no coherent response to the
scathing allegations being leveled at them. Nothing.


As a result, I shorted on the early morning bounce on day two. When the market's
expectation of a response was sorely disappointed, the stock resumed its decline, quickly
falling another 20%. Although I missed the best part of this trade, it was still quite
reasonable.


Opko Health


Last year we were all treated to the entertaining spectacle of Ackman vs. Ichan in the
Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) long-short debate. It was so much fun to watch that Bronte
Capital's John Hempton dubbed it "hedge fund porn".


This year we are being treated to a sequel where Lakewood Capital is squaring off against
the Street Sweeper in a long-short debate on Opko.


Lakewood originally presented this thesis on November 21st at the Robin Hood
Conference in a presentation entitled "Opko Health: The Placebo Effect".


During 2013, I published TWO ARTICLES ON OPKO HEALTH. Both of these disclosed
my short position and both of them coincided with a double digit percentage drop in the
share price of multibillion dollar Opko. In one case, Opko responded to my concerns in a
public press release.


The South Florida Business Journal noted that "Opko Health issues statement after
shares drop 10% in heavy trading".


At 45 pages in length, Lakewood's piece is the most thorough analysis of Opko's history
and its product portfolio that I have seen so far. The grim view expressed by Lakewood did
not really spill over into the mainstream until December 11th, when $5 billion Opko began
a plunge of as much as 30%.


Lakewood outlines its view very clearly and presents a very strong case for why investors
should sell Opko. However where Lakewood fails is that it fails to explain why investors
should sell Opko ‚Ä¶ RIGHT NOW. In other words, despite the significant concerns raised
on valuation and history, Lakewood does not present a clear and identifiable catalyst for a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1912331-heading-into-2014-shorts-return-with-a-vengeance 8/22


near term decline in Opko. One painful lesson that I have been forced to absorb during
2013 is that overvalued companies have a way of staying overvalued (or even becoming
more overvalued) for extended periods of time before they correct.


When I presented my two short theses earlier this year, I also took the view that Opko was
overvalued. I also raised concerns about overly optimistic outlooks for Opko products such
as 4KScore without adequate substantiation for those bullish views. However, my reason
for being short the stock was more based on what I felt was a near term catalyst. In each
case I felt that the onset of any meaningful amount of insider selling would cause a quick
reversal in sentiment by Opko longs, who are most retail investors.


It has been many months and Opko had nearly doubled, but so far my predictions have
been disappointed. I never expected Dr. Frost to sell any stock. The selling I expected
would have come from the newly minted insiders who sold their companies to Opko in
exchange for stock. These entrepreneurs received tens of millions of dollars in Opko stock
and then watched the stock go on to double or triple. It seemed inconceivable that they
would not sell as soon as any lockups expired. Yet they haven't.


As my catalyst failed to materialize, Opko's product portfolio comes closer and closer to
larger revenue catalysts, which increases the risk of being short Opko.


So now there are multiple competing catalysts as follows:


Downside catalyst: Insiders did not sell at the time of their lockup expirations or 144
eligibility. But perhaps they are instead simply waiting for a new calendar year and will sell
in early 2014, still at prices neat all time highs. Investors will sell en masse upon the first
reported insider sale. Or of course, maybe this won't happen.


Upside catalyst: Large scale revenues could begin to materialize from products such as
4K Score and which may reduce the current valuation discrepancy. If more than one of
Opko's "shots on goal" begin to pay off at the same time, there could be significant further
upside to Opko's stock. Or of course, maybe this won't happen.


Downside catalyst: Revenues may materialize but they may be far less than expected.
This would give credence to the Lakewood thesis that revenue expectations are now
confirmed as being unattainable. Stock will sell off. Or of course, maybe this won't happen.


Conclusion on Opko

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1912331-heading-into-2014-shorts-return-with-a-vengeance 9/22


Many on Wall Street refuse to ever utter the words "I don't know". They feel that they must
have an opinion on everything. In the case of Opko, I have no problem saying that at the
current time, "I don't know" which way the stock will head.


I will continue to monitor for the emergence of the catalysts above. I also continue to
conduct substantial independent research on components within Opko's product portfolio
using various tools at my disposal across multiple countries. I also continue to receive
ample amounts of analysis from various 3rd parties (both positive and negative). If I can
get meaningful clarity, then I will trade accordingly.


Conclusion on Dr. Frost


Although I was previously a vocal short on Opko during 2013, readers should be able to
see that I have never expressed any lack of respect for Dr. Frost himself. Over the years
Dr. Frost made billions of dollars through successful investing and management within the
healthcare space. He has delivered many more billions in shareholder value to the
investors who were involved in his companies.


Even those who are short Opko or other Frost names should certainly acknowledge the
inherent value that his involvement brings to the table. The "cach√©" of Frost allows Opko
better access to new acquisitions, potentially at favorable prices. His involvement will also
likely give him an edge in penetrating distribution channels with products within Opko's
growing portfolio. Finally, there is the element that thwarted my two short theses in 2013.
Confidence in Frost by insiders (new and existing) seems to reduce the likelihood of them
selling their stakes in Frost related entities even following sharp rises in the share price.
This keeps confidence (and share prices) in Frost entities at premium levels.


Additional Frost plays


At present I have no position in Opko, but I reserve the right to go long or short Opko at
any time based on new findings. I continue to conduct my own research and I continue to
receive much research from external sources. In the meantime, I have occasionally played
some smaller Frost plays on the long side and done quite well.


Despite my vocal shorts about Opko during 2013, the many retail investors who follow
Opko have not held a grudge against me and have kept things surprisingly civil. They
regularly send me fairly detailed analysis of Dr. Frosts many other, smaller investment
plays, which I probably would have not been aware of otherwise. Although the bullishness

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1912331-heading-into-2014-shorts-return-with-a-vengeance 10/22


from these investors is often a bit excessive (i.e. "this is a guaranteed 30 bagger"), the
opportunities presented are often very attractive on a risk reward basis (when kept in
realistic perspective).


I was previously long on Castle Brands (NYSEMKT:ROX) and did reasonably well. In
2013, Castle was a quadruple as of November, hitting $100 million in market cap. As of
December it is still a triple since January. I was also long on Biozone (BZNE) for a time,
but I am currently on the sidelines as new developments there need to be digested. I am
currently long Senesco Technologies (SNTI) which is one that I believe will go up 3-5x in
2014. Dr. Frost disclosed a 9.9% investment in just Senesco last week, which has not yet
been noticed by many investors.


Earlier in this article, I made the point that some of the best shorts in the country have
expressed complete conviction that Unilife is headed to zero. This universal conviction
certainly does not guarantee that Unilife will go to zero. But I believe that it tilts the scale
greatly towards a likely share price decline.


Likewise, many investors in Opko (and many other Frost names) seem convinced that the
involvement of Dr. Frost somehow "guarantees" that his stocks will do well. Again, there is
certainly no guarantee, but the involvement of Frost is certainly a positive, not a negative.


Afterward


I am currently in the process of authoring two books on reverse merger fraud in the U.S.
and in China. My experience in Harbin investigating China Education Alliance currently
occupies two full chapters, one on due diligence techniques and one on lessons learned.
It was a bizarre experience, parts of which are laughable and parts which are tragic.


I have many, many other examples of reverse merger fraud gained from years of
experience and observation. But I always welcome submissions from those who have
their own observations, experiences and case studies which they may wish to share. I
would be quite honored to hear from anyone who has been a victim or who has had
experience in exposing such schemes. For those who wish to share anonymously,
confidentiality is assured.


I have now looked at so many reverse merger frauds and stock promotions that I view it
as largely a cookie cutter process with blatant similarities shared across the vast majority
of them. I hope that by illustrating the patterns and techniques involved in these
processes, I can provide a useful handbook to allow investors to avoid getting hoodwinked
in these never-ending schemes.

Thanks for a well written article. I was drawn to your article as I think I need some short balance to my portfolio and as
I am selling some big winners (some directly, some with trailing stops, some though covered calls).


A few questions about shorts, short squeezes and short defenses:


- How many shares of a company can legally be sold short? Is it just the total shares? Is it total shares which can be
borrowed and then which shares can be borrowed?


- If there is a limited number of shares which can be borrowed, who audits and enforces that?


- Can a person keep their shares from being borrowed for shorting by putting them up for sale in a limit order (even is
placed well above the current market price)? Is this a legtimate startegy to keep a short raid on a company you own?


- How do shares end up on a 'hard to borrow" list? Where can one find an updated 'hard to borrow' list?


- Besides the NASDAQ site publishing short volume twice a month, is there a site to get more frequent data?


- What do you know about the data at this shortanalytics site. http://bit.ly/1ezIvR5 The numbers (and percentages)
seem way too high but are the trends and changes in trend valid?

So your short trades have not worked out and you want to allege fraud. 
According to Todd Smith's (the litigant) 'LinkIn' profile he is a genius that performed all sorts of marvelous deeds

From his job description and title most of his complaints are within his duresdiction that he was employed to ensure

I would be careful with the analysis of REGI. The markets are simply failing to understand how the regulatory system
is designed. Claiming that the tax credit is responsible for the bulk of the EBITDA is simply wrong. The RFS2
implements multiple mechanisms to ensure profitability in the renewable fuels market. 1) The EPA set the biobased
diesel RVO at 1.28 b gallons for 2014. This is the same level as 2013, but groups are pushing for it to go higher. The
effective RVO for biodiesel is over 2 b gallons because biodiesel can be used to satisfy the advanced biofuels
mandate, and 20% of overproduction is allowed. 2) The RVO for 2013 for biodiesel has already been met, which
would usually drive D4 RINs lower, but they have remained near $0.30. 3) In 2012 talk of the reinstatement of the tax
credit drove RINs down creating the negative margins. Once the tax credit was reinstated and the tax credit applied to
the appropriate quarters of production profitability was restored. 4) This year talk of the expiration of the tax credit has
provided support for the RIN prices, so Q4 2013 should be strong for REGI 5) margins have been strong and positive
all Q4 2013, as they have for most if not all of 2013 6) The elimination of the tax credit would result in higher RIN

prices and a stable margin. 7) As RIN prices have fallen, so have feedstock prices, which is responsible for about
80% of the costs of production, margins have been maintained 8) REGI has a P/E of less than 3, and earnings are
almost certain to be strong for Q4. In conclusion, margins are what matters, not whether or not the tax credit is in
place. The tax credit is a redundant subsidy, which results in lower RIN prices. Without the tax credit RIN prices will
appreciate, and/or feedstock prices will go lower. As long as the RVO remains, biodiesel must be produced, and it
isn't produced with negative margins. The Tax credit, RINs, RVO and feedstock prices all must be considered when
analyzing REGI. A simple tax credit analysis simply isn't enough to understand REGI or the market in which it exists.

Agree with your comment Robert. Many people currently going short REGI are trying to paint the
RFS2/biofuel sector with a broad brush in respect to the implications of the biodiesel tax credit expiring. The
whole short thesis rests solely on the back of the expiration of the tax credit.


The author then states that there are no "catalysts" for REGI to go higher, yet with the recent 33% drop from
the Stifel report (voicing the same concerns as the shorts on SA seem to be parroting), the market has
seemed to have already priced in the possibility of the biodiesel tax credit expiring.


In reality, there are numerous catalysts to take REGI higher. 1) The biodiesel tax credit is renewed and made
retroactive (which is exactly what they did at the beginning of 2013). I believe this to be very likely given that:
A) There is bipartisan support for the incentive B) The tax incentive has existed in one form or another since
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 C) Senator Chuck Grassley publicly stated that he expects the tax credit to be
renewed D) The Senate's Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus informally included an "extenders" bill
on the committee agenda for 2014, with the package likely to be retroactive just like the prior extension. E)
Despite the recent EPA decision regarding the RFS2 mandate, the Obama administration is still firmly
supporting biofuels. Published over the summer, this infographic (http://1.usa.gov/192aCnr) displays the
administration's views on the importance of biofuels. F) On last Thursday, 54 members of the House of
Representatives from 24 states sent a letter to the EPA administrator and the White House asking for the
2014 biodiesel blending to be increased to 1.7 billion gallons from the current level of 1.28 billion gallons.


"President Obama's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget commits to increasing funding for clean energy technology
across all agencies by 30 percent. This includes investment in a range of energy technologies, from
advanced biofuels and emerging nuclear technologies to clean coal."


"The Administration will also support the Renewable Fuels Standard and invest in research and development
to help bring next-generation biofuels on line."


It's also important to keep in mind the current mandated volumes from the RFS2 are NOT final. The numbers
are currently open for public discussion and the advanced biofuel mandate could be increased significantly
from where it currently is (though it is unlikely to be as high as the prior iteration). Biofuel advocates has been
pushing for an increase from 1.28 billion gallons to 1.7 billion. As Robert mentioned, one must also account
for the "advanced biofuel" mandate which is 2 billion gallons.


I could write an entire article on this subject but I'll leave that to more informed writers like Robert who have
been following and covering the industry much longer.

Robert, I'd very much like to hear your thoughts on the SYNM acquisition. Daniel Oh has been making very
shrewd acquisitions over the past couple years and I believe this will prove to be another one.


23 Dec 2013, 10:58 AM


Robert Wagner, Contributor
Aedius, I agree with you, I believe the Tax Credit will be extended. I remember at the end of 2012 everyone
was saying it was dead. The republicans were shutting down the government and it still passed. I can't
imagine the republicans would pass something when they were trying to shut down the government, and then
not pass it when they are trying to keep it open and make amends. I would also expect the biobased diesel
RVO to me increased. It would simply make sense to cut back ethanol and boost biodiesel. It would be a
political win lose vs a lose lose which is what they have now. No one will be upset if ethanol is cut and
biodiesel is boosted to compensate. Lastly, I think the SYNM purchase is pure genius. It greatly reduces
REGI's regulatory and firm risk. REGI is no longer just a biodiesel firm, they are a diversified energy firm.
They can do biodiesel, renewable diesel, GTL, CTL, cellulosic diesel, cellulosic fuel and others/PCM. REGI
provides SYNM what they have always needed management/operations expertise and capital. REGI makes
GTL and G2, G3 and G4 all possible, and they should be able to finally prove that G1 can run as forecast.
SYNM also provides REGI with contacts with the USN, Sinopec, Sasol, Exxon and others. Bottom line, if G1
does run as expected, REGI just bough at asset that can pay for itself is less than 2 years. More importantly,
with TSN as a partner and supplier of yellow grease, they may want to expand their exposure in this industry
and support more plants geographically distributed around the nation to capitalize of the lower transportation
costs. CA has its own incentives to produce biofuels, and seems to be a good location for a plant. Bottom
line, REGI has the capital to fully recognize the potential of the SYNM patents. IMHO what all this tax credit
talk has created is a bear trap for the shorts. If the tax credit does pass and the RVO is increased, their entire
thesis evaporates and REGI has a P/E of less than 3, and almost certain strong earnings for Q4. Bottom line,
most of these questions should be answered by the end of January 2014. The RVO may take longer as it did
last year, but there will likely be some news as if there is movement. The 60 comment period ends soon on
the proposed 2014 values.

To add to Robert and aedius' detailed comments on REGI, I would just point out that the insider sales that
these incessant short-pumping pieces keep citing (without mentioning price levels) mostly occurred in the
$14-16 range. That's hardly evidence that the stock is overpriced at $11. Nice try, guys.


Looking forward to the January short squeeze after tax loss selling ends, and then earnings report.

MWinMD, I totally agree. This unjustified panic about the tax credit has created a perfect short squeeze
situation. REGI has a P/E of less than 3. Since the tax credit bearishness began, I'm showing that margins

REGI having a gross margin of over $1.00 using yellow grease. Margins have been extremely strong all
quarter, and remain so even though the 2013 RVO has been exceeded by over 120% through Nov.
Theoretically once 120% is reached D4 RINs should trade at $0.00, but this year other factors have impacted
the price, namely this tax credit issue. Because the tax credit is expected to not be renewed, theoretically D4
RINs should jump in price by $1.00/1.5 in 2014. Right now, expecting higher RIN prices in 2014 due to the
loss of the tax credit, obligated parties can buy RINs at a 50% discount. That is largely why RINs still have
value even though the D4 mandate has been exceeded. There are other factors like the D5 and D6 not yet
being met, so the tax credit isn't the only story, but it is part of it. In any case, margins are what matter and
that is what the markets just seem unable to grasp and margins are strong, and they will likely to remain
strong in 2014 whether or not the tax credit gets extended. Even if the RVO remains at 1.28 bgal, much of
that is soy oil, and as long as soy oil based diesel is required, the low cost producers like REGI should do just
fine and simply gobble up more market share from SME producers. There is a lot of market between 300
mgal and 1.28 bgal that REGI can take from SME. REGI is a growth stock in a no growth industry as long as
SME is required to reach the RVO.

One more misleading statement in this article is the conflation of biodiesel with ethanol here:


"The urgency of the fiscal cliff made this easy to slip in. Unfortunately the tax credits are largely uneconomic and most
people (including Congress) now understand that the full "carbon footprint" of producing, converting and transporting
biofuels greatly reduces their relative benefit. The size of that relative benefit had previously been considered to be
much larger and made it easier for members of Congress to overlook the poor economics of the tax credit. It is now
no longer easy for them to overlook such uneconomic and wasteful government spending."


"Biofuels" is a broad category. This poor net benefit of ethanol's carbon-footprint has not been the case for biodiesel.
Biodiesel from waste grease (increasingly the business of REG) results in an 86% reduction in greenhouse gases

compared to petroleum-based diesel, and has none of the food-vs-fuel or indirect land use issues that plagued

23 Dec 2013, 01:35 PM


Robert Wagner, Contributor
"Syntroleum is actually in the business "renewable diesel" not "biodiesel." REG is only involved in actual "biodiesel".
Investors need to understand that these two products comprise entirely and radically different technologies which are
in no way compatible. There are no synergies in the technology whatsoever."


Once again, I would caution people about the analysis being provided about the biofuels industry, REGI and SYNM.
To understand this industry one needs to fully understand how the regulatory system operates. The tax credit is only 1
mechanism, and it is a redundant/overlapping subsidy. With the introduction of the tax credit, the competing regulatory
mechanism the EPA's RIN fell by a comparable price of $1.00/1.5. The key being, the margins are maintained with or
without the tax credit. That has to occur because of the mandated 1.28 billion gallons that must be produced. You
can't produce 1.28 billion gallons if the margins and EBITDA are wiped out as many are claiming the tax credit
expiration will do. With bonds you are told "don't fight the Fed" in biofuels you are told don't fight the EPA. The RVO
remains at 1.28 billion gallons, much of that is high cost SME. REGI is mostly a flex feedstock firm, so they should be
fine. With regards to the above quote from this article, the thing investors must understand is that prior to the SYNM
purchase REGI is a 100% undiversified biodiesel company. They produce biodiesel and biodiesel is 100% dependent
upon the EPA's RFS2 mandate. Biodiesel and ethanol are government constructed/manufactured and supported
industries. They only exist because of laws and regulations. Without the law and regulation REGI simply wouldn't
exist. That is unbelievably high risk. REGI and the entire industry can vanish with a stroke of a pen. With the purchase
of SYNM REGI is no longer a biodiesel firm, they are a diversified energy producer. SYNM produces a "drop-in" fuel
whose market exists with or without subsidies. REGI can now survive if the RFS2 goes away. REGI can now get into
markets that don't rely on government support like GTL, CTL and other FT applications. REGI can now grow beyond
the stagnant and feedstock capacity limited biodiesel into the unlimited market of cellulosic feedstock biofuels and
synthetic diesel. Bottom line, REGI's purchase of SYNM is a transformative acquisition, and will allow REGI to greatly
expand and diversify beyond the restrains of the biodiesel industry. Bottom line the diversification and risk lowering
benefits of the SYNM acquisition appear to me to be worth far more than what they are paying for SYNM. REGI
simply needs a way to survive in the long run and through different regulatory environments and SYNM provides them
with the tools needed. If you choose to follow this industry and stocks be sure to understand the EPA's RFS2, the tax
credit and other congressional actions, the interaction between the fuel price, feedstock prices, RIN prices, the
nesting structure of the RINs, the RVOs of various renewable fuel category and their impact on margins. Margins are
what is important, not the tax credit. We should see the outcome early in 2014 because we can calculate the margin
on a daily basis, and my bet is margins will be maintained, earnings will be maintained, the RVO will be reached, and
REGI should do just fine with or without the tax credit.

In the recent REGI conference call they give insight into the regulatory mechanisms and how the margin is what is
important. Q3 had EBITDA margins of $0.80/gal and adjusted for the hedging loss, they would have been $1.00/gal.
Margins have been as strong or stronger throughout Q4, and they expect higher production, so I would expect
earnings to meet or beat on the high side. Also, look at how much cash they generated in Q3, and I would expect
even more generated in Q4. Anyway, be sure to read this conference call to understand how the regulatory system
works, why the tax credit isn't all that important and why REGI should beat expectations for earnings in Q4.

I'm not going to beat a dead horse in explaining how your analysis on REGI is incorrect, Robert, aedius & MW did a

position.


24 Dec 2013, 09:40 AM


MWinMD
Oh but there's yet more shenanigans here to debunk.


"So why did REG suddenly rush to pay a massive premium for an acquisition of a no-revenue, non-producing nano-
cap which had been facing delisting? It is simple. REG likely knows (as its largest shareholders do) that the share
price is likely to begin a steady descent in January. With the share price above $10 at present, the stock serves as a
valuable acquisition currency and it needed to be used before the share price declines. When the share price falls to
$5.00 or below, such an acquisition becomes entirely too dilutive."


Interesting that you claim that REGI paid a premium for SYNM when there are already three separate investigations
or resolutions by SYNM shareholders alleging that the board inappropriately accepted a bargain basement price.


Throw stuff at the wall and see if anything sticks?


24 Dec 2013, 11:03 AM


Robert Wagner, Contributor
MWinMD, I was going to comment on that as well. Once again people need to understand how this industry works
before reaching a conclusion. In 2012 the tax credit didn't exist, but talk of its retroactive reinstatement drove biodiesel
margins into the RED during the 2nd 1/2 of 2012. The impact of this can be see on page 15 of this conference call
presentation. http://bit.ly/1eCAcnA


Before the tax credit reinstatement the earnings basically disappeared in Q3 and Q4 of 2012. After the retroactive tax
credit was applied, Q3 and Q4 were profitable quarters. The important issue however is that for Q3 and Q4 REGI
needed to have plenty of cash to ensure they could continue to produce when margins collapsed. Because of the
uncertain regulatory requirement holding cash is key to survival in this industry, and with the possibility of the tax
credit expiring, REGI knows it needs to have plenty of cash on hand because of the uncertainty of what is going to
happen. Do I expect margins to go negative w/o the tax credit? No, but in the short run the markets may do that as
things adjust. The other thing is that the negative margins of 2012 were due to the reinstatement of the tax credit, not
its expiration. As explained above the expiration should support RIN prices above where they would be without the
expiration. That is a bonus to REGI, not a negative. They are making higher profits now because of the fear of the tax
credit expiration. That is what is so ironic about these short position arguments. The need for cash is why REGI would
want to use stock instead of cash. REGI is also buying SYNM as a very reasonable price and it will almost certainly
be beneficial to REGI shareholders, so that is another reason to use stock. SYNM would have generated $10 million
in 4 mo, or $30 million annually according to SYNM's last conference call and that was based upon 85% production.
Cash or stock, it is clear that if the DF plant runs at or near capacity, REGI is getting a bargain. Right now REGI must
hold a cash buffer in case of a short term collapse in margins. That is why REGI would use stock over cash. Once
again, people must understand the dynamics of this industry to understand how things are valued and behave. A

simple tax credit analysis is a very very very wrong approach to analyzing these stocks. Bottom line, this industry is a
often a feast of famine industry, with cash being king. Firms with ample cash can continue to produce in markets
where other have to shut down. In Q3 and Q4 2012 REGI was able to continue to produce even with negative
margins as other plants had to shut down. Once the tax credit was reinstated, REGI made nice profits during Q3 and
Q4 whereas the firms that shut down, like SYNM, had to burn cash without any production and didn't get any tax
credit for Q3 and Q4. Cash allowed REGI to capitalize an take risks other firms couldn't. Once again, that is why
REGI wants cash, and would rather issue stock.


24 Dec 2013, 11:28 AM


Robert Wagner, Contributor
Not to beat a dead horse, but this article was written about the tax credit and its impact on the markets back in
February 2013. It pretty much reviews the impact the reinstatement had on the margins. Initially the markets do seem
to take a bit of time to adjust, but by the end of the year, all markets seemed to be working as intended.

when authors are short, it is easy to see the bias. 
If there is anything positive about a company, they leave it out of the article. 
not fair and balanced at all.

Fair enough Richard, but what's your view on LTS...? it's going up, up and up....! That's one of Dr. Frost's "mini
investments" too!

Mr. Pearson, it is sad that you need chose between profits (or limiting losses) and your credibility. Not a good position
to be in!

Well, let's see, if I a pure MBA&engineer is better to quess the future of REGI than a former investment banker
(Richard Pearson).


I don't see any reason why Congress will not extend the tax credit. 
It is always good to remind that even if diesel consumption continues to fall, the country's overall blending ratio of
1.16% is nowhere near the theoretical limit of 7% for diesel-based fuels. However, that's not the case,because diesel

i love how SA always delete my positive posts. Anyways here it is again. Im up 18 000 USD from a 12 000 dollar
position. Glad I invested in ONVO . My best performing stock I have ever been involved in. This is by far 5 the best
stock one can get into.


ONVO may save millions of animals from suffering. It may save drug companies trillions of dollars. It may change the
way we do modern medicine. Burn patients may be able to get new skin grafts. There is endless potential for this
revolutionary company.


And technically speaking I can not find a MORE BULLISH CHART. ONVO chart looks like it in the start of a
SECULAR BULL RUN> Technically ONVO chart is extremely bullish. I would encourage everyone to buy this stock.

Due to ONVOs volatility, Mr. Pearson will be right some of the time--I wonder at what price he intends to close his
position. How many incredible investments began with the perception that they were overvalued? this remains the
technology of the not-to-distant future--staying long!
