TRUP


I planned on writing a follow-up article that highlights the questions I have around
the way in which veterinarians receive "points" in Trupanion Express.


In the process of asking the company for comment they chose not to answer any of
my questions but did accuse me of Libel and Fraud.


Below is the conversation and a series of open questions that remain unanswered.


Threatening someone as small as me seems like an epic waste of management's
time; it would be more effective to simply answer these outstanding questions for
regulators, investors and veterinarians.

Background


Last week I published an article here warning investors about the potential regulatory
risks from Trupanion's (NASDAQ:TRUP) Territory Partners. I intended to publish a
follow-up article walking through the payments made to Veterinarian clinics based on
what appears to be the successful sale of insurance at their clinic. In the process of
requesting comment from the company for that piece, the company accused me of
making false statements that constituted libel and securities fraud.


News outlet The Capitol Forum (paywall) recently confirmed that Washington state's
Office of the Insurance Commissioner has launched an investigation into TRUP.
Washington now joins Colorado (also highlighted by the Capitol Forum) with active
investigations into the company. Together, these states represent ~9.5% of policies
written at Trupanion.


Thursday, I sent a list of questions to TRUP management to provide comment about
their referral payment systems, specifically:


I am writing a follow-up piece for "The Capitolist" on Seeking Alpha about your sales
and marketing practices regarding the Veterinarian Rewards and the Territory Partners.


Do you - or have you this calendar year - rewarded veterinarian clinics for points
"based off of certificates issued at your [the veterinarian] hospital"?


1.


Do you - or have you this calendar year - provided cash rewards to your territory
partners based off of the successful conversion of a new policy holder?


2.


Do you provide training to the veterinarians and their staff that they are specifically
NOT allowed to offer or comment on specific insurance products without being a
licensed agent?


3.


Trupanion's Chief Administrative Officer Asher Bearman and chief council Gavin
Friedman chose not to offer answers to the questions posed above but did take issue
with our previous note (link) threatening me with libel and a potential securities fraud
claim, Full Text in Bold Italics below

We were provided with a copy of an article from “The Capitolist” published this
morning. In that article, you disclose that you are short TRUP shares. That is your
prerogative, of course. You then proceed to make objectively false statements
about our business practices. Your article appears to be premised entirely on
these factual errors. We believe these false statements are libelous and probably
constitute securities fraud considering your short position. To ensure that other
investors are not mislead by your false statements, we require that you correct
them immediately, including the following:


“100% of Territory Partner and Veterinarian compensation is dependent on
the successful sale of insurance…”


“…a largely unlicensed network of third parties (referred to as Territory
Partners) and the completely unlicensed Veterinarians - both are paid
insurance commissions based on successful sale of the insurance.”


“…we believe TRUP also pays Veterinarians based on the successful sale of
insurance…”


“…the territory partners and potentially the veterinarians who refer their
patients to the insurance product (and are also reimbursed based off of
successful conversion of patients into plan holders).”


“The sales channel consists of Territory Partners - converting veterinary
clinics to Trupanion Express - and the Veterinarians then converting their
patients into insurance policy holders.”


“Territory Partners are paid ONLY when they generate a patient who converts
to a plan holder…”


Contrary to these statements:


Veterinarians are not asked to sell or solicit insurance.


Trupanion does not pay any compensation to veterinarians based on the sale
of insurance.


Territory Partners do not sell or solicit Trupanion direct to consumers unless
they have elected to obtain a license as direct marketing is not their role.

My Response:


“100% of Territory Partner and Veterinarian compensation is dependent
on the successful sale of insurance…”


Territory Partners and veterinarians do not convert pet owners to become
policy holders. Trupanion sells insurance to pet owners through its website
and telephonic service center.


Territory Partners are compensated through a combination of referral fees for
new pet enrollment and residuals tied to pet retention within their territory.
Their compensation is not tied to whether their activity results in a lead or a
conversion.


Here is a screenshot of the response for good measure


TRUP is a +$1B company and I am a sole proprietor, so the threat of suit is incredibly
intimidating. Because the company obviously feels as though the previous article came
off as accusatory in tone I'm taking this opportunity to dial back the rhetoric and in the
spirit of open dialog, speech and debate I will address the bullets above as open
questions to the company, regulators and investors alike. To the extent that any of my
statements need to be augmented after reviewing the information I have at hand I've
done so. However, I take issue with the assertion that my article is based off of the
regulatory angle, this is a false premise. I make it quite clear the company is massively
overvalued on a price to book basis - and all price targets are based off of that - even in
a situation where all is well the stock should trade down to $20/share, if the regulatory
component comes to bear then my $10/share price target stands. Now let us get into the
mix...

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200696-trupanion-moonshot-valuation-lingering-questions?source=all_articles_title 5/14


The company has a point here and this statement needs to be tweaked - I published
evidence that the Territory Partners were compensated via a "100% Commission
Structure" frame work that TRUP publicized in their "Territory Partner Brochure." Below
is a photo of from the link in question.


Source: Territory Partner brochure


Using the company's own language in the slide above it is clear that TRUP pays their
Territory Partners 100% on commission. It is also clear that the commission is derived
from "each new policy within your region" and there is an annuity associated with that
policy, so there is no real debate as to how the Territory Partners are compensated.


There is a reasonable criticism that I included Veterinarians and their clinics into this
bullet point. I should have suggested that the highest point total available in their
compensation was derived from the successful sale of insurance as opposed to 100%.
With that in mind I think it is even more critical for the company to answer the question
posed to them in my email:

“…a largely unlicensed network of third parties (referred to as Territory
Partners) and the completely unlicensed Veterinarians - both are paid
insurance commissions based on successful sale of the insurance.”


Do you - or have you this calendar year - rewarded veterinarian clinics for points
"based off of certificates issued at your [the veterinarian] hospital"?


Specifically because a Veterinarian shared the screenshot (from May 10 , 2018) of the
Trupanion Express Points system with me, below.


See Point 7: "Fulfill medical records request for a new Trupanion pet enrolled from a
certificate issued from your hospital - 200 points"


th


This appears to be payment for referral and specifically one that resulted in the
successful sale of insurance and originated from that particular Veterinarian's office. So
the debate should be focused around the referral payments which is precisely why we
asked them to comment on those practices in our email. We have not received any
comment from the company on the legality of these practices or how they justify them
under the referral based laws. I think Regulators, Investors and Veterinarians deserve
an explanation.


I am confused about this statement being considered false, perhaps it is simply
semantics where I used the word commission and they use the words "referral fee" but
functionally this seems like the same thing. Perhaps the company can offer up an
explanation on why these payments are not tied to the successful sale of insurance and
why they are in compliance with the referral laws?

“…we believe TRUP also pays Veterinarians based on the successful sale

“…the territory partners and potentially the veterinarians who refer their

“The sales channel consists of Territory Partners - converting veterinary

patients into insurance policy holders.”


“Territory Partners are paid ONLY when they generate a patient who
converts to a plan holder…”


Let us look at the statements that the company makes in the email


Veterinarians are not asked to sell or solicit insurance.


Again the screenshot clearly states there is a 200-point reward for, "certificate issued
from your hospital."


So please do explain to Regulators, Investors and Veterinarians why this is not payment
based on the successful sale of insurance?


Once more, I believe that there is an issue of semantics at work. Perhaps the company
can clarify how their own literature does not suggest this statement is true? not to
mention the SEC correspondence, which says:


This is an excellent opportunity for the company to explain why the payments that they
advertise are not based on the successful conversion of patients into insurance policy
holders?


This statement needs to be tweaked - As the Territory Partners brochure clearly lays out
they are paid when a patient converts to a plan holder and they receive an annuity on
the plan holder there after.


Contrary to these statements:

This is not the issue at hand. The issue I have questions about is whether they are paid
on referrals that result in the successful sale of insurance. Although I think the fact that
the bonus is so large (in comparison to the rest of the payments on the Trupanion
Express website) could instigate the solicitation and sale of insurance. It is up to TRUP
to regulate this and train the veterinarians and their staff that the solicitation and sale of
insurance could put them at great risk of violating state insurance regulations. During
the TRUP incentive trip to Hawaii, a Facebook group was created so that the
Veterinarians and/or assistants could share experiences and ways to sell more
Trupanion. I initially was allowed in the group, but TRUP has made it private so all we
have are the screenshots. In the screenshot below, it is clear that at least some
Veterinarians do not understand that they cannot sell or solicit insurance.

Trupanion does not pay any compensation to veterinarians based on the
sale of insurance.


Territory Partners do not sell or solicit Trupanion direct to consumers
unless they have elected to obtain a license as direct marketing is not
their role.


I don't understand this statement given the Trupanion Express screenshot...

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200696-trupanion-moonshot-valuation-lingering-questions?source=all_articles_title 10/14


Territory Partners and veterinarians do not convert pet owners to become
policy holders. Trupanion sells insurance to pet owners through its
website and telephonic service center.


Territory Partners are compensated through a combination of referral
fees for new pet enrollment and residuals tied to pet retention within their
territory. Their compensation is not tied to whether their activity results in
a lead or a conversion.


The Semantics Game Needs To Stop


I never brought up the solicitation rules or regulations, this does not seem relevant. My
concerns are explicitly around the payments attached to referrals, please answer the
question that I posed in my email:


Do you - or have you this calendar year - provided cash rewards to your territory
partners based off of the successful conversion of a new policy holder?


1.


Again - no one accused them of this (although the Veterinarian Facebook page is
worrisome) I simply asked if you had provided them cash or other payments based on
the successful conversion of a patient into a policy holder.


If the referral fee tied to the successful sale of insurance, and the brochure seems to
suggest that it is, then this statement is hard to understand.


Most of the protests from the company refer to the solicitation and sale of insurance,
and in the context of poorly trained Veterinarians this could be an issue. However, it's
important to establish that there are multiple laws governing the solicitation and sale of
insurance as well as the referral of insurance clients.


There are key differences between the "Selling Laws"


and "Referral Laws"

It should be obvious by now that my questions surround the "referral laws" not
"solicitation laws." It is incredibly odd that the company keeps defending itself with
solicitation comments when those are not relevant to the questions I have posed.


According to this link, Section 2116 governing Insurance Commission law reads as
follows:

As stated earlier, I think it's valuable to reduce the rhetoric and move this towards an
open dialogue about the company so that regulators, investors and veterinarians alike
can gain a greater understanding of the regulatory framework TRUP operates in. In an
attempt to facilitate such a discussion I have re-posted the questions below.

Perhaps I am misreading the laws and this is entirely a valuation short, I can live with
that as the regulatory concerns do not alter the fundamentals as they sit today.
However, I still think that there are questions that remain unanswered regarding the

this as an opportunity to educate regulators, investors and veterinarians alike. I reassert
my generous $10 PT that is based off of 3x book value. If I am wrong about any of the
