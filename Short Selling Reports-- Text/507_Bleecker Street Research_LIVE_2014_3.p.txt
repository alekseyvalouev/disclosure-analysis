LiveDeal.com Is Not Generating Any Revenue
Feb. 14, 2014 10:17 AM ET122 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Executive Summary:


LiveDeal is not generating any revenue.
Investors likely believe that the website is generating revenue.
Over the next six months, a short is attractive.


_________________________________


This article will focus on several new developments that have occurred since my last
article. The main point of this article is that there is no way LiveDeal (NASDAQ:LIVE) is
generating revenue. In press releases, LiveDeal has made LiveDeal.com the crown jewel
of what the company is. Most people buying the stock are probably betting on this "deal-
making" website. Here are some facts for longs to consider.


Here are the revenues from the past two years.


Since LiveDeal's fiscal year ended on September 30th, investors have no idea how
LiveDeal is performing. Additionally, LiveDeal recently changed its fiscal year to end in
December. And since the LiveDeal segment launched in September 2013, investors really
have no idea about the performance of the segment. Although I think most would probably
think that LiveDeal is generating revenue. But I don't think it is.


If you go to LiveDeal, you can sign up and put a deal in your cart. Aside from giving them
your email address, it's totally free. Then you print out the deal, take it to the restaurant,
and they supposedly honor it. In my last article on the stock, I called 15 of the top
restaurants in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties and asked if they
used LiveDeal. Only three said they did. The deals, however, are being offered by the
restaurants through other deal channels. If the restaurants don't know what LiveDeal is,
then they certainly aren't paying LiveDeal anything.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2021971-livedeal-com-is-not-generating-any-revenue 2/29


To confirm this, I called LiveDeal's IR contact listed on the website. LiveDeal's IR firm is
CorProminence, LLC, and I spoke to Scott Arnold. I asked him if LiveDeal was generating
any revenue right now and he said that it was not. He told me that LiveDeal was targeting
market share now.


I then called the LiveDeal main office. No one initially answered the phone, but a couple of
minutes later I received a call from someone named, I believe, Sarah. I tried to set up a
phone call with CEO Jon Isaac or any other member of management, but she did not
seem to want to. I asked her if LiveDeal was generating any revenue and her response
was "I imagine so." So someone in the main office thinks LiveDeal is generating revenue,
while the IR spokesman says it is not generating revenue.


This leaves the legacy business of online marketing, for which it no longer accepts
customers.


We continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from servicing our
existing customers under our legacy product offerings, primarily our InstantProfile
line of products and services. Because of the change in our business strategy and
product lines, we no longer accept new customers under our legacy product
offerings.


So it is no longer accepting new customers, which means that revenue from this line is
going to be slowly drying up. And with the new LiveDeal not generating any revenue, I
think bulls will be in for a nasty surprise when investors are faced with LiveDeal numbers
after the first quarter.


Bulls will probably say that LiveDeal said that traffic to its site was up 153% in January vs.
December. While that's nice, according to Alexa, at least 35% of that traffic is coming from
India.

Somehow I don't think that traffic from India is really helping a website that at the time was
only in three counties in California, but you can make that judgment.


I tried to call Stock Market Media Group, LiveDeal main offices, the IR firm, and Isaac
Corp. on Thursday, but no one picked up the phone at any place.


Goldman Research and New Promotions


On February 12th, Goldman Research (Not Goldman Sachs) initiated coverage on LIVE,
rating it a speculative buy, and put a $12/ share price target on it. The main issue I have
with the Goldman Research report is concerning intellectual property.


"The rights to intellectual property are maintained through a mixture of copyright and
trademark laws, which have been utilized for its two integral businesses. LiveDeal's
publishing system that provides its tools for website design is proprietary as well, as
is its mobile app software."


This is simply not true. LiveDeal states pretty clearly several times in the 10-K that it has
no intellectual property.


"We estimate that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how
will continue to be our principal method of protecting our trade secrets and other
proprietary technologies"-10-K

That doesn't exactly scream IP protection. It should also be noted that Goldman Research
was compensated $4000 from a third-party to publish the research.


Goldman Small Cap Research was compensated by a third party in the amount of
$4000 for a research subscription service.


Another piece of sponsored research I found this morning was from an article appearing
on "$tockroach.com." The article opened saying:


Until yesterday's split, LiveDeal Inc. (LIVE) was way out of our league at $17 per
share, so I wouldn't have even considered writing it up for you. But after a
blockbuster bull run, LIVE management decided to go 3 for 1 in order to get the PPS
back to a more "normal" level.


Because at $20 dollars a share pre-split that was apparently pricing out too many
investors. The article went on to say:


Now even "down" here around $8, LIVE requires slightly special handling from us
bottom feeders. For one thing, this stock has actual fundamentals! LIVE's online
restaurant coupon business took in $2.3 million last year. For now, think of a
baby Groupon that learned from big brother's mistakes. (Read more) Gross margin
on that is tracking at a fat 60%,although admittedly LIVE is still a dot-com
start-up and so the P/E (yes, it has one) is negative.


I'll address those claims point by point.


1. The author says that LIVE's online restaurant coupon business took in $2.3 million last
year. This is simply not true, as the online restaurant coupon business was launched in
September and LiveDeal has not reported numbers since that business launched.


2. That author said that gross margins on this revenue were 60%. These GM numbers are
right if you only consider cost of services, but when you also include operating expenses,
gross margins are actually negative.


3. I'm not exactly sure what the point about the P/E ratio is, but it isn't negative. A negative
P/E would imply that it actually has earnings. This company barely has revenues.


There was also this tidbit in the disclaimer.

StockRoach.com is wholly owned by Global Oasis Group Inc. Global Oasis Group,
Inc is currently being compensated seven thousand dollars from Cream
Consulting LLC (a non-controlling third party) for LIVE advertising and
promotional services. This compensation constitutes a conflict of interest as to our
ability to remain objective in our communication regarding the profiled company.
Because of this conflict, individuals are strongly encouraged to not use this
newsletter as the basis for any investment decision.


So what is Cream Consulting, LLC? It appears to be an entity set up to promote stocks.
You can see a history of all the stock it has promoted at stockpromoters.com.


I can't find much else about Cream Consulting, LLC on the internet other than the previous
stock it has promoted, and most have ended badly. I expect that LiveDeal will end badly
as well. This isn't a call on what the stock will do tomorrow, or the next week, but rather
the next 3-6 months. If you want to be on LiveDeal, just remember that LiveDeal is not
generating revenue.

There is not really a market. It is impossible to short shares (have been trying for 3 days) which distorts the price.
Hang in there!


I agree w/ your conclusion (that there is no rev being generated, no brand value being created). I'm incredibly
frustrated that I can't get a borrow..

live's platform can be used by anyone selling anything....if it splits a couple more times, you'll be able to get
some shares. however, by then Google will have bought them out.


14 Feb 2014, 11:43 AM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  No reason to buy this company out. You could replicate it very easily and since LIVE doesn't
actually do deals the restaurants, they just pull deals from other deal sites.

"I'm not exactly sure what the point about the P/E ratio is, but it isn't negative. A negative P/E would imply that it

- If the company has losses (which it does), it has a negative P/E. Revenues don't even enter that calculation.

I have been thinking as a speculator here, but I will not chase this (ala dot.com days). With 13M shares in the float
and a 7M daily volume, this has to be a massive day trade waiting to crash if they report any numbers. Good article
keeping my trigger finger in my pocket.


14 Feb 2014, 10:52 AM

How can you tell when shares are afloat from chart?


14 Feb 2014, 04:28 PM


dmadesign
you have to look deeper in the charts. I did not find it on yahoo, but I'm sure it is there. All companies have to
list the shares in the public. When the trade volumes are half of the float, it means there is churn on the public
shares, meaning the same shares are trading over and over. That you can't tell, then surmising the volume
numbers.

Christopher, 
I have enjoyed reading all three of your articles you are an excellent writer, do great analysis, and form a well thought
out opinion. I have to say good gob and I think you are 100% correct except for one thing; People are buying in to the
potential and the hype not because they believe they are making money now but in the future if this does gets
popular. But what are the chances of that? Power ball is at 335 million today, I might have a better chance at hitting
that.


I just have one question:


How does shorting this stock work? I have not shorted any stock or do not plan on shorting it but I am just curious. Do
you have to put up money up front? What if this stock jumps 10 more dollars? Do you have to pay something or can
you just say I want to wait six month and it will be a lot lower? I believe this stock in six month will be under a dollar
but who know what it will be before then. It could run to 20 since they started advertising on CNBC again. Then they
could slit 3 to 1 and it run up again just based on hype and the low stock price. I would be worried for the short run but
for six month it seems like a given to short it.


Since you shorted this stock, are you worried this might happen?


Casey


14 Feb 2014, 10:58 AM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for the nice comment. To address your question about shorting I wouldn't pick this
for the first stock to short. To short a stock you first have to borrow the stock (right now it's not possible to
borrow). Then later you buy them back from the person you borrowed them and you keep the difference.
(hopefully a gain if the stock is lower). I am mildly concerned that that will happen, I wish there were put
options on this stock so I could short it through puts instead.

You are looking at LIVE in one dimension, you have no idea what the company could be working on nor any clue as
to the potential for their team to bring strategic transactions to the table, what you see is not what you get here, your
short call could be steamrolled. Stock price action and volume tell it all, see you at $20.


Look at insane valuations in the Internet space, this is only $100 million, can 10x with the right deal and continued
proliferation to NFL cities. 29 more NFL cities to launch, mark this post.


14 Feb 2014, 11:12 AM


utcasey99
Everyone seam to compare it to the market cap of groupon and retailmenot and say how undervalued this
company is. Try comparing it to the million other internet companies that have failed and they will be
overvalued.

Well coordinated pump and dump of the year. If you'll notice literally every single morning at 9AM ET out comes
another press release describing how great they are doing and what new city they're in with little or no financial
substance either from the company itself or one of their paid touts. Still under $1 million revenue and losing money
like a siv. When the extra shares hit the endless short squeeze should come to an abrupt halt and reverse direction
back to the presplit $1 level where this stock meandered for years before all the foolishness.


14 Feb 2014, 11:27 AM


jon_davi
It appears that LiveDeal is striving to develop as large a market share as possible all across the country, without
having a basic revenue generating model in place. It's easy for anyone to recreate this type of web service, but
difficult to make money on it unless you have a well thought out revenue plan.


I can find no information on how this company expects to make money from the large market share it is obtaining.
Look for the increasing stock price to draw investment interest, as well and stock secondary issuances to maintain
national expansion to large cities. Still, when they finally come out with a revenue plan, this stock will deflate and
crash hurting many small investors looking for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. All they find is rain.

Great article and I agree with every point you made. Does anybody know what LIVE's market cap is after all of these
splits? After seeing LOT78 run over $1B in market cap in a similar pump and dump last year, any short needs to be
timed extremely well. Never underestimate the power of the promotion and the stupidness of the sheeple buying into
it. #internetneversleeps


14 Feb 2014, 12:14 PM


ParaDiddle
Yup, this is also why I have not gone berserk on this pump and dump. This really points out how many
unsophisticated investors there are out there, only armed with a hope and a prayer to get rich quick. They
don't even understand any fundamentals or metrics, they only understand a small number for the share price
and then see goog at 1000 etc... and think that this could happen for them.


14 Feb 2014, 12:28 PM


ParaDiddle
This company has already done a pump and dump of themselves back in 2004 and it ended badly. If you investigate
the roots of the company, you will find multiple lawsuits  
(judges ruled against the company) and numerous consumer complaints. The people running this company appear to
be the type of "marketing experts" who skate the thin line between what is legal, and specialize in charging money for
services either never rendered, make it difficult to cancel, hook people on "free" services and then charge their credit
card unauthorized etc... In other words, they are a boiler room of telemarketers (they call them sales associates).
Does anyone really think that a legitimate software company, challenging GRPN and others, would feel comfortable
with a history like that? They would imagine that somebody would surely investigate their past and learn this
information, being listed on Nasdaq. Also, what legitimate company releases a press release nearly every day with
the same information? Every CEO gets on CNBC and says that they don't want their share price going up fast, but
obviously the executives of this company are focused on that, paying thousands of dollars for paid PR releases and
an advertising campaign on satellite radio. Has any legitimate company being listed on the major exchanges actually
advertised their stock, or worse, put the words "Nasdaq: LIVE" on their actual logo.


Do you people realize that their website doesn't even work in IE 9 (or lower)? What legitimate software company
would release a website that doesn't work in about 15-20% of all browsers?


Then there's the deals themselves. Most of their deals aren't really deals at all, but published and known deals at the
establishments. This is very convenient because if a customer comes in and asks for the $4.75 breakfast special, it's
already on the menu. I would expect most of their deals are schills to make the site look more legitimate than it is.
Chris's research suggests this too, and points out regardless of what's going on, Livedeal isn't making any money on
it anyways.

I still think too early to short. Need to wait for absolute capitulation. It still could get to $15-$20, regardless of how
insane that makes the valuation. Once the retail shorts end up panicking and covering and maybe even believing the
fairy tale, thats when I'd want to swoop in. Although if you are short now and have the liquidity and will power to
weather the storm, you can't possibly lose as eventually it will go back down to well under $1.


14 Feb 2014, 01:19 PM


jpc170
There are no shorts avialable so the stock is going to rise no matter what because the shorts still have to buy back
their shares. There havent been any shorts since the split so that means any short is close to being at 100% of a loss
right now!!!!!!! Your better off buying regardless this company is a scam because it has to go up from all the shorts
getting margin calls.

"I would short to zero ANY company that Tim Matula is involved with."


Really? To zero? Most brokerages require you to post $5 of margin per share when the stock trades below
$5. That means that shorting 10,000 shares of this at, say, $0.50 a share will tie up as much margin as
shorting 10,000 shares of a $10-a-share stock, but offer 20 times less upside for you.


Have you really thought this through, or do you just enjoy hearing yourself utter nonsense?


14 Feb 2014, 04:40 PM


JeremyJackson314
If you're shorting this stock you're not making any money right now. Maybe you're on the wrong side of this trade....


14 Feb 2014, 03:59 PM


ParaDiddle
So there's a right side to a pump and dump?

Chris, 
What brokerage company are you using to short?


14 Feb 2014, 04:28 PM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Interactive Brokers. They don't always have shares available though.


14 Feb 2014, 05:09 PM


Stephen User 19923011
They did not have any on Scot trade either. It will be interesting to see how that will develop this week.


16 Feb 2014, 01:12 PM


jpc170
That's what through me for a loop. I also use Scottrade and 90% of the time prior to the split shorts were
available. After the split I kept checking to see if any became available as one would assume with the PPS
doubling over two days was a short squeeze. Clearly that is not the case because I even when the PPS hit
$11.96 there were no shorts available. Based off neither Scottrade or Interactive Brokers not having any
shorts available would lead me to believe the sky rocketing PPS was just people driving the price up due to
the hype. As we know each clearing house only has a certain amount of shares to short available each, but
this really leads me to believe someone "close" to LIVE bought as much of shorts available from different
clearing houses, then also bought regular shares, this way they made millions on the way up, sold before the
10Q was released and now going to make millions on all the shorts they are holding! All from a company who
stated they "plan" on being able to afford to stay in business the next year with the $100k left in their account.


16 Feb 2014, 08:05 PM


breal100
Chris, the more you talk about shorting, the more people will look to buy in and squeeze shorts, knowing that
someone somewhere is out there.


25 Feb 2014, 11:26 PM


Owen
Right, because no one knew anyone was shorting this stock until Chris spilled the beans.


Does short-squeezing work when a company is delisted? Maybe you can bring it back to life with a good
squeeze.

How do these criminals not get stopped?


14 Feb 2014, 05:01 PM


ParaDiddle
This is NOT an innovative idea and the company owns zero IP. There are dozens of other companies doing this,
including GRPN. There are companies with 90,000 merchants and millions of users that are getting bought for 2-5
million, while LIVE claims only about 2000 merchants and lies about their web usage, since 41% of it is from India.
That's about $55 per merchant (best case scenario) and would value LIVE at just over $110,000, not the 120m mkt
cap they are now. It will be curious to see the download count when/if their app is released. I expect that their app is
just a dangling carrot, but if it does come out, I would NOT be surprised if they have paid some sort of botnet in India
to hit the downloads for a misleading press release, that is probably already written as of today.


If you did some research on Mr. Drose, you would know that he promotes legitimate stocks with a might fine ~40%
return on his picks, and does short illegitimate stocks, such as LIVE with a good track record of about 39% on each
pick.


What you don't realize rhinodoc is that Mr. Drose is on your side, while the executives of LIVE are really the ones
interested in fulfilling their own prophecies and profits at yours and other shareholders expense. Do some research
into the history of the company, YP.com and LiveDeal.com. Check out the people who are running it and promoting it.
You will find multiple lawsuits they either settled or were found guilty for fraud. Take a look at the other companies
their IR guy has promoted. All pump and dump candidates, penny stocks, highly manipulated, absolutely no revenues
or real business but lots of great website and CEO's talking about how great the opportunity to buy 1 million shares of
their worthless stock will be because their company will be worth zillions.


Do you understand that ALL the press releases you read are PAID for? The companies releasing them are all named
to confuse unsophisticated investors into thinking that the source of the news is legitimate, hence Goldman and
MarketWired, StockMarketMediaGroup etc... What legitimate company pays for press releases?


Do some DD, and continue to follow Mr. Drose in the future. I guarantee you that if you hold this stock for a year, you
will lose 99% of your money. I feel sorry for you if you are this unintelligent.

Chris, This is a greatly needed article to get out. Although it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what this
company is up to it appears that P. T. Barnum knew what he was talking about. We all seen this time and time again
these type companies with no real business case, no revenues and a whole lot of paid PR's. When a company's main
PR focus is to sell you their stock, RUN.  
A poster stated the site does not work under some IE versions, go figure. They don't even bother to correct spelling,
grammar or functional mistakes on the ads. BTW they don't use HTTPS for your logins either. Yep this is state of the
art business. 
BTW look at livedeal.gr, same look and feel and style, guess which livedeal was up and running first?

Obviously, this company is a pump&dump scheme. Eventually it will go under, but it doesn't mean short at this level
will make you money. In fact, it is generally hard to profit from shorting a pump&dump scheme.

product they will let investors ask questions.

Facebook offer 1.2 billion for TUMBLR which has no revenues and kayak.com only takes deals from other websites.
Both models are going well. The Livedeal site is very ergonomic and the stock is up on hype not any different then
fluctuations in BP over the oil spill. You act like sentiment can't be traded on. I've made over 200% while everyone
here waited for a short. Called a short, degraded the company. Honestly. You might be right, but your pocketbook is
suffering. Now I have sold my profits this morning. I will re evaluated next week. Good luck waiting.

Well $11.94 is as good as $12, and that was the target. As I post this I am looking $9.28 AH and have a very bad
feeling about LIVE. These things never end good for investors. About 11.4 million shares traded and suggest that
someone was ringing the register ahead of the weekend. At some point, the trap door will open wide and many
investors will be hurt. Stock moved to fast, and to far. Nevertheless, I love the story.


14 Feb 2014, 06:16 PM


ParaDiddle
I'm worried about you R.J. Chopin. "I love the story" You don't love the real story, you love the dream you are
being sold. The real story is that this company is run by unscrupulous executives who have been sued and
found guilty of fraudulent schemes to defraud people out of money by using illegal marketing practices, like a
boiler room. The company is directly marketing their stock to investors for the sake of sending the share price
up as quick as possible, which is NOT what any educated financial professional would do, but certainly what
a pump and dump would do. They are paying illigitimate PR firms to post stories on fake news sites and with
names that are meant to mislead investors to believe that major firms are recommending and covering the
stock. The investor relations person is a known pump and dumper that has numerous press releases out for a
handful of companies exclaiming why you should buy those stocks, and how those companies will be billion
dollar companies. All those stocks are at zero or nearly at zero. The pattern is clear, they are not building a
legitimate technology company but rather trying to cash in on the recent success of some web 2.0 companies
by putting a new spin on an old pump and dump scheme. This is the first company I have ever seen who paid
to advertise their stock on satellite radio. Would any legitimate company pay to place an ad that sounds like a
real recommendation radio segment just to sell it's shares? Heck no... Anyone who can't see the scam here
needs to ask themselves if they should be investing in a market where it pays to be smarter than the average
schmuck and dumb money is at a greater disadvantage than gambling against the house.

He's interested in the company as a SHORT. DO you understand how that works?

As most stocks in the market today are pump and dumps, you had to be blind to buy in believing all the BS articles
published daily. I have bought and sold this stock back since Jan knowing each time it was a crap shoot if it would
continue to get lucky and make money on its ridiculous gains day after day or would I get stuck holding the bag once
an article such as this one today or even worse the 10Q. As soon as I saw that I immediately dumped all my shares
AH luckily before it went to its current close. I am very curious as to what this thing opens at on Tuesday!

Dear …. 
A few comments in response to your article regarding Live Deal Inc (LIVE) 
1. I doubt very much most of your arguments regarding this company just because the facts are a bit different:
expanding growing companies not always are profitable the next minute. When they reach this point, they are too
expensive to buy. The opposite is true: there are numerous examples when profitable well-rated companies’ stocks fly
down. Thus, ENPH (Enphase Energy), had solid cash in hand, high growth rates of 87.46, growing sales, high ratings
by Zack in the strong buy category in November – December 2013, it was in the Top 100. Nevertheless, it fell from
$8.2- to $5.0 within a few days and managed to recover only a few months later. 
2. You can also compare profits of CSIQ (Canadian Solar) which was leading Top100 on Nasdaq in 2013 and is still in
this category. Do you see considerable profits there based on the financial data provided by NASDAQ? 
3. But my strongest argument regarding you article about LIVE is the time of its publication. Today, February 14
between 10 and 11 a.m. when LIVE reached its highest point in price, you article arrived. To be exact I got it at 10:17
a.m. That is the perfect time to buy short. I was just wondering if it is just a coincidence or somebody just plays the
game this way. Then, there should be a disclosure posted if you have short position in this stock. 
4. Another remark, a month ago somebody was writing an article how bad GALE is. Three pages plus of an analysis,
then on the last page that not all readers who just scan through would even reach, this writer discloses information
that he holds the short position in this stock. Why not to start with this disclosure on the first page?


People do invest in future, and this is a low cap company which started something new.


15 Feb 2014, 05:52 AM


jpc170
Tat there where no shorts available at the time of Chris published this article. Also if the 10q was not dropped
by LIVE after hours unannounced clearly shows they waited to milk every penny from this scam. The article
from Chris would have just impacted the PPS until LIVE had 3 more paid publications come out every day
until Tuesday which would drive the stock back up. Knowing this was a scam and gamble each time I owned
shares I would have help my 6900 shares over the 3 day weekend even though this SA article pulled the PPS
down. Once the 10q was announced it factually backed up every single thing Chris mentioned in this article
as he stated Jan 29th.

no clue why it fell at that time. Nobody knew that this article was coming out beforehand.  
4. All articles have a disclosure at the very top stating whether or not we have a position in the stock. Some

Your post in reply to the article is nonsensical and does nothing to address this articles facts. All you did was
list some completely irrelevant examples of other companies circumstances. Chris's articles have stated
several huge concerns that all investors should be aware of. No one has shown anything stated was not
completely accurate. This article was about revenues or rather complete lack of revenues to support this
business or the ridiculous share price.

Tatrous,


I can only say two things about reading your post..


1) either you are part of pump n dump scam & afraid f Christopher's excellent research 
or 
2) you are too novice in stocks ( which being on seeking alpha.. i doubt). if this is the case, i feel super sorry for you


Enphase and Canadian solar are real companies with products, employees and history. Enpahse was in fortune
companies list of innovations prior to going public. it was backed by reputed investment firms. Live deal has no
employees. you can only find three people on linked in ( all with questionable backgrounds). Every single company
they have found have changed names.. inconsistent reporting standards etc..and are poker players


this company is pure market manipulation.. i will keep my hands off it for now

The traffic from India is pretty simple to explain. It's their website developers. Those hits are their live testing of the
site.


Look at Yelp or any other site that uses a lot of Indian programmers or outsources their coding to an Indian firm.
Those hits from India are not customers, they're developers.


15 Feb 2014, 12:59 PM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks, that seems live a good explanation. But that would seem to suggest that a lot of the
153% increase in traffic was coming from developers not customers.


15 Feb 2014, 01:13 PM

I don't think it is all developers actually, I would bet that they have a number of offshore people to create this
coupon listings. It appears almost all the ads have: 
1. A generic picture of the subject item, (ie pizza, drink...) for the coupon. That can be found on several other
websites. You would think if the restaurants were creating these ads there would be some specific original
pictures highlighting that restaurants offerings.  
2. A coupon offer that is almost always an general offer made on the restaurants website or other coupon
websites. That is a big giveaway, any restaurant owner offering a discount would make is specific enough to
know where that customer got the offer. That way they would know what advertisement is working for them. 
3. Some have spelling or grammatical errors or odd phrasing. You would think that Ghirardelli Chocolate
Company would correct a spelling error in "Chcolate". but that was scraped from another site.

I've read every single comment up to now, very interesting. Each side whether long or short has some valid points;
Now instead of beating each other up lets talk about some stuff that is worth talking about:


. Chris, whether you're right or wrong about LiveDeal you've single handedly caused the stock to crash twice for your
own benefit, as you're shorting it. You're influencing the investors with your words to do what you want to happen to
the stock, so you can take maximum benefit. To me this is stock manipulation for your own benefit and should not be
allowed. Other investors cannot really influence the stock as much as you can. Don't take advantage of your position
at Seeking Alpha with its now 3 million subscribers. I can see if you had no position in this at all, but not when you are
in it. Why didn't you say anything when the stock was at 10 bucks pre-split?


. The 153% increase in the traffic means nothing. 153% from what? From Zero? 
The Alexa ranking algorithm is not very reliable for websites with low traffic, but as serious traffic starts to pour in the
numbers become more accurate and if a website is in the top 1000 websites in the world then the Alexa rankings
become very accurate. I would say if a website has an Alexa ranking of more than 100,000 I would not take that
website as a serious site, let alone for a company that is supposed to be worth $130M. For example I have a website
with Alexa ranking of 169,000; this site gets about 500 visitors a day. That's a joke. its ranking should be over a
million. On the other hand I have another site that gets over 30000 visitors a months with Alexa ranking of 580,000.
So you can see it's not reliable with sites with low traffic. I checked the Alexa ranking of 20 different known coupons or
deals sites and every single one of them had an Alexa ranking of less than 2000 (not 164,000). You can go to
flippa.com to see that sometimes websites with very good Alexa ranking (less than 10,000) sell for less than $20,000
or $30,000. 
So the increase of 153% in traffic really doesn't say a whole lot. If LiveDeal Alexa ranking goes under 5000 then I'm
gonna look at it as a serious player.


. My main problem with this company is not even its Traffic or Alexa ranking. So what, that can change, maybe in 6
months or so their ranking will improve. Lets wait and see. My main issue is very simple: HOW DO THEY MAKE
MONEY? Show me the money! You see, with Groupon there is a real mechanism in place to make sure that Groupon
gets paid. It forces the merchants to pay them right off the bat or else Groupon wouldn't even initiate the offer. So,
Groupon makes sure it gets paid first. With LiveDeal the offers are non-exclusive, meaning the same offer could show
up at another site, and another... and so on. So, what's the difference between this site and XYZ deal site. Why is this
worth $130M market cap and some other ones on Flippa.com are worth only thousands. If somebody could please
answer me that or clarify that I'll buy LIVE first thing on Tuesday morning and for the fellow who made 200% return on
this Stock: Good for you man! Good for you.

Author’s reply »  I didn't really cause Friday's crash (I don't think). Also I haven't covered a share. You can
accuse me of manipulating the stock but what about all the paid pumpers? What about all the press releases?
As to your other point, yeah even the people at the company don't know how this is going to generate
revenue, so I don't think you are going to get a satisfactory answer.

Chrisbond, This article may have caused a dip for Friday, but another paid publication by LIVE pumping the
stock would have more then rebounded on Tuesday. I bought 6900 shares after this article came out at
$10.20 avg PPS banking on another "amazing" article about LIVE . Again knowing from LIVE's prior earnings
I never bought shares of this stock because I believed in all the hype , I bought it because LIVE had a great
PR campaign to have huge increases from day to day by BS advertisements. I knew every time I would buy
shares I was taking a huge risk based off the single fact LIVE has nor makes money! If the 10Q was not
announced AH I would have rolled the dice to see what creative PR stunt came next. Instead I dumped all
6900 shares AH at a loss of $7k. Who knows maybe their PR campaign is so good instead of the PPS
dropping like a rock which it should based off the 10Q it goes to a 52 week high. Either way I will still buy , sell
or short (if available ) LIVE in the future if they continue along the path two weeks ago with the PPS swinging
$3 a day. This is a gamblers stock not an investments,!

The one thing I can agree on, and so should everyone else is that this company cannot be worth over 100
million with no revenue plan in place.


This is a place to share ideas and it shouldn't matter if the author has a position or doesn't. If he states what
his intention is, backs it up with his own money it shows the commitment to his thesis. It would be a dark deed
if say an intention was to pump up the stock with a positive article and then go short on a position after other
news develops. Obviously we all know what this is.


My concern with Chris at this time is that he wrote the articles weeks ago and has continued to stick to his
guns. I believe the stock will go down in the near future, but when you see a market trend it would be better to
cut the loss you have now and then re-enter the market when it becomes more favorable.


For instance, Chris having done his research and knowing the stock would go down could hedge by buying
shares now and selling later on with the proper stop loss while shorting more shares at the current price.


That fact is why I am hesitant going further into this discussion because so many facts are missing on not
only the company but the also a proper strategy on behalf of the author. (sorry Chris, I really like your article
but a strategy is always needed, especially if you are calling such a huge fall like this)

"could hedge by buying shares now and selling later on with the proper stop loss while shorting more shares
at the current price."


How would that work, exactly? Do you move money from one pocket to another to feel richer? Look only at
the statements from the account where you made money that month?


I love these common-sense arbitrage techniques.

Its a common strategy., although most do it with options and not the stock itself. It is also common with the
belief of increasing/lowering the average share price.

You're right jpc170, this stock is a pure gamble. You could make 200% or you could lose $7000 in a matter of
minutes. But at some point, perhaps not far from today as Warren Buffet once said once the tide goes out you'll see
who's been swimming naked and let's hope none of the people on this board will be there swimming on that day.

Think about the concept of their business for a moment: Offering a deal or some sort of a discount that is Live and
one should take advantage of it before it's gone... Well, that's how they all are. Every single deal or offer you see in a
deal or coupon website IS LIVE of course. If you see it that means they have to honor it. If I see a hotel room for $99
on some travel website that's a live deal, it's not old. If I see a flight to Miami for $199 that's again a live and real deal.
All Groupon's, FatWallet's, coupon.com's ... etc. deals are all Live. So what does a LiveDeal really mean? Or how is it
a new concept? Has anyone ever thought of it this way? People get excited for nothing. It's the same old idea.

People don't realize that there are dozen's (maybe hundreds) of companies (marketing & software) that are
trying to build a proximity based deal network. GRPN is already offering these types of deals and tools to
merchants. The best case scenario for this company is to get bought out for anywhere from $250,000 to
$1,000,000. That's if they are even telling the truth about their 2000 merchants, which I doubt they are based
on the inconsistencies on their deals page. It looks to me like they are making up deals to make their service
look more entrenched than it is.

ParaDiddle, you hit the nail on the head and LIVE is exact example of how a stock can be easily manipulated
based on today's technology. As you mentioned there are probably 1000's of other companies just like LIVE.
Years ago before we all had high speed internet connections and the ability to read extensive information
available on the internet about a stock we would only invest in something that was main stream enough that
we at least heard of the company. Now people buy and sell stocks daily based off of flashy articles
speculating and insinuating if we invest now we will have the potential to be part of the next Apple or Google.
Of the other 1000 companies doing the same thing as LIVE why aren't we reading or investing in them? It's
because they don't have dozens of articles hyping them up daily and planting a seed in an investors mind
they have a chance of a life time to become rich overnight buy investing in a hidden gem such as "LIVE" . 15
years ago what were the chances any one of us would have invested in a company such as LIVE? Probably
less then 1% because we wouldn't have known who they were. The market 15 years ago has changed
drastically to what it is today. Today the market is controlled and manipulated by MM's , paid publicity and
hype. Because we have access to read so many speculative articles regarding the smallest of companies
even ones who opened their doors a week ago we will invest in these companies when they haven't even
sold single thing yet! Again as I have stated I have bought and sold this stock many times, not because I
believed the value, because I believed the publicity would drive up the PPS. That is also the reason I would

Live Deal is basically a startup website where local merchants (in 4 cities only) can access and create a discount offer
that is beamed via email (phone apps coming latter) to subscribers of live deal using GPS to locate them in the
neighborhood. This is a great idea and Groupon is already moving in that direction, but LIVE is a long way from being
a Groupon. Here are a few thoughts:


1. How large is the subscription email base that receives these email deals? 
2. How many merchants are using the software to create deals? 
3. What is the response by consumers to each deal (full metrics and demographics)? 
4. What fees are charged to merchants, or consumers?  
5. Is there advertising revenue? 
6. Website Traffic increased 153% last month? If 500 people visit the website each month and a 53% increase equals
765, that's 1265 visitors. I know I visited at lease 10 times trying to see through all the smoke and mirrors. But recent
website traffic is a metric for eyeballs that only advertises look at.


It is most likely counterproductive to LIVE's pump and dump campaign to release any other stats or facts. They are
marketing a "vision" as a "reality." Groupon can easily burry LIVE because Groupon has over 60 million apps
downloaded. How many does LIVE have? None. Live has no market for their merchants to access like Groupon.


"Groupon's mobile app (pictured in the upper right-hand corner of this article) is the first cutting edge app with
searchable deals featuring up to 50% discounts. With 60 million apps downloaded and growing, this innovative
revenue channel is driving Groupon's revenues and will take Groupon to the next level."

I'm in the software business. I could write the LiveDeal myself in about 1-2 months. I could offshore it for 5-
10k and do it in house with a full team for about 20-50k including the mobile app. On top of that, I checked the
NY livedeal page yesterday and there were only 4 deals in NYC, 1 of them was fake, as it was a copy of a
restaurant in Manhattan Beach (NOT Manhattan NY). That's one heck of a huge launch in NYC. They make
their announcements for sensational purposes only and to move the stock. It's counterintuitive to what any
responsible executive would do. It's a clear case of Micro Cap Stock Fraud, aka. Pump and Dump! I just feel
sorry for all the dreamers caught up in their mind state of desperate poverty.
