Short Ideas China


I am short ChinaCast Education (OTCPK:CAST-OLD) for the following reasons:


1. ChinaCast has engaged in several dubious transactions with seemingly related
parties. 
2. It's quite possible that ChinaCast investors' funds were misused or misappropriated
during these unusual transactions. 
3. Several of ChinaCast's important subsidiaries were not audited by Deloitte, but rather,
by largely unknown auditing firms. 
4. There appear to be numerous errors and omissions in past ChinaCast filings with the
SEC and communications with investors. 
5. ChinaCast is highly reliant on creating future transactions to keep up its reportedly
strong rate on growth. 
6. ChinaCast's questionable management team is rapidly losing investors' confidence.

ChinaCast Education wants you to believe that it, a tiny Chinese company, has
managed to create a prosperous education business by purchasing private universities
at great prices from, among other people, a peasant farmer and the owner of a tiny
printing shop. This outstanding company has managed to outmaneuver huge
international, university-operating players, such as KKR and George Soros-backed
Laureate Inc., along with all the Chinese competition. This fantastic company has
managed to find hidden deals the big players missed among the small pool of 250
Chinese private universities and leveraged them to create a rapidly growing and
tremendously profitable business.


But there are numerous problems with this laughable pitch. It appears that ChinaCast's
major acquisitions have all been with related parties, the company's management
appears to have lied when questioned about these transactions, and the company has
not disclosed numerous seemingly important pieces of information. ChinaCast has
argued that its deals are too complicated to be understood by ordinary investors, and as
such, it chooses not to release numerous pieces of crucial information because it claims
that we, the general public, just wouldn't get it. I think there is a better explanation:
ChinaCast is hiding some dirty laundry. Let's dig in.


Dubious Transaction #1


ChinaCast allegedly purchased the Hubei Industrial University Business College
(HIUBC) from an independent party in 2010. But, all signs point to this purchase being a
related-party transaction. ChinaCast purchased HIUBC from a wholly-owned foreign
enterprise (commonly shortened to as WOFE or WFOE) named Rubao. Here's what we
know about Rubao.


Rubao listed its contact phone number as 68644666 in its 2008 annual inspection
report. This phone number is identical to ChinaCast's phone number. In the same 2008
Rubao inspection report, ChinaCast's CEO, Mr. Ron Chan, was listed as Rubao's
corporate contact. Also, in Rubao's 2007 financial statements, we see (.pdf) that
ChinaCast is documented to be a major debt holder/shareholder. If Rubao shared the
same phone number and corporate contact prior to ChinaCast's purchase of Rubao, and
Rubao's major creditor was ChinaCast, it logically follows that Rubao was a related
party to ChinaCast. How can ChinaCast claim that Rubao wasn't a related party?

Rubao also had an unlikely owner. Mr. Wu Shi Xin, a middle class print shop owner
(according to page 3 of this (.pdf) OLP Research report), somehow came up with the
funds to establish Rubao and purchase the HIUBC university. Mr. Wu also managed to
purchase $29.3 million of ChinaCast stock despite his middle class background and lack
of any apparent means. I've never heard of any middle class person purchasing either a
university, or $29.3 million of private placement in stock. How did Mr. Wu possibly come
up the funding for these purchases? It would seem more likely that Mr. Wu was merely a
front man for ChinaCast's related-party dealings.


Dubious Transaction #2


ChinaCast's purchase of Lijiang College (LJC) also raises concerns. ChinaCast
purchased Lijiang from a WOFE named Xijiu. Xijiu appears to have been created and
managed by ChinaCast employees. Ms. Hu Xiaolei, a longtime ChinaCast employee,
has been responsible for filing Xijiu's annual reports. She served this role both before
and after ChinaCast's purchase of LJC.


Mr. Song Hongtao, a former ChinaCast employee, served as Xijiu's legal representative
from Xijiu's creation in 2005 onward. With ChinaCast employees filing annual reports
and serving as legal representatives for Xijiu for years before ChinaCast acquired Xijiu,
it would seem that ChinaCast clearly purchased a related party. At no point does it seem
that Xijiu was an independent entity from ChinaCast. It appears ChinaCast purchased
an entity that it had previously created. This acquisition definitely raises eyebrows.


Follow The Money


While undisclosed related-party transactions are pretty bad, the story gets worse when
we try to figure out who benefited from these seemingly related-party transactions. The
WOFEs involved in ChinaCast's transactions made large sums of money in a very short
period of time. While it is unclear where this money went, it is unlikely that ChinaCast
shareholders are the ones benefiting.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/262299-6-reasons-im-short-chinacast-education?source=all_articles_title 4/8


According to ChinaCast's recent 8-K, Xijiu paid 235 RMB ($36 million) for Lijiang
College, and three weeks later, ChinaCast purchased Lijiang for 365 RMB ($56 million),
130 RMB more than what Xijiu paid. How can ChinaCast possibly justify this huge
increase in Lijiang College's price in a mere three weeks? If ChinaCast were as shrewd
as it claims, you'd think it would have simply paid $36 million for Lijiang three weeks
prior and not involved a middleman. It seems ChinaCast shareholders got ripped off.
Xijiu made 130 million RMB ($20 million) in just three weeks of owning Lijian -- at the
expense of ChinaCast owners. Strangely, the buyer (Xijiu's owner) who supposedly
pocketed this $20 million windfall with the presciently timed purchase and resale of
Lijian University was a poorly educated peasant farmer (according to this (.pdf) OLP
Report, page 3). I find that unbelievable.


Furthermore, as established previously, it seems that the middleman, Xijiu, was set up
and operated by ChinaCast. Why would ChinaCast create a company to purchase a
university and then have the related party sell it back to the parent company at a grossly
inflated price? It would seem that the company is either playing games to filter money or
it is directly misappropriating investors' funds. Regardless of which of these possibilities
is correct, the implications are very bad for ChinaCast investors.


That's not all. I also have grave doubts about ChinaCast's acquisition of Foreign Trade
and Business College of Chongqing Normal University (FTBC). ChinaCast's subsidiary
Yupei Training Information Technology purchased FTBC in 2008. According to
ChinaCast, Yupei paid 480 million RMB ($73 million) to acquire 80% of FTBC.
According to Yupei's audited financial statements (which can be found here (.pdf),
appendix 1), Yupei paid 165 million RMB ($25 million). What's the explanation for the
$48 million difference?


ChinaCast tried to explain this difference by saying that a different ChinaCast subsidiary
(ChinaCast Technology) paid the other $48 million. However, the audited ChinaCast
Technology statement for 2008 shows (.pdf) a cash outflow of only 7,000 RMB ($1,069).
It appears that ChinaCast lied when it published the 8-K with this piece of apparently
errant information. The question remains: What happened to the unaccounted for $48
million?

There are several other significant cases of financial transactions that don't make sense
and money that seems to disappear unaccounted for. But for the sake of brevity, I'll
move on to the big problem that arises from these transactions: Management is unable
to reasonably explain these bizarre dealings.


Baffling Corporate Response


I can accept complicated and unusual financial transactions, provided that management
can clearly explain them to investors. But ChinaCast has failed to explain itself. Its CEO
has repeatedly taken pride in the sophistication of its dealings. According to the
Financial Investigator's report, CEO Ron Chan has stated about its complex
transactions that: "Apollo [Group] won’t do these deals." When questioned about these
deals, ChinaCast refused to provide crucial details, in essence saying that the deals
were too complicated to be understood. For example, take this quote from ChinaCast's
8-K that sought to explain the deal:


Once again, these transactions are complicated and, to the extent that you are
trying to follow the cash, you need to be careful to understand how the transaction
works. We obviously cannot in this short statement provide a thorough explanation
of the transaction.


Since this is an 8-K, the company has an unlimited space to explain itself. It is bizarre to
claim that management cannot provide a thorough explanation of the transaction.
ChinaCast stated that in the end, a sum of money was paid to acquire each university,
and that these transactions were audited. But ChinaCast has left out all the details about
the multiple levels and layers of these transactions. As noted previously, ChinaCast
appears to have dealt with many undisclosed related parties. Since this is the case, the
details of how these transactions occurred are relevant and ChinaCast should disclose
this information rather than claiming that the deals are too complicated to be
understood. ChinaCast's behavior leads me to ask: "What are they hiding?" Investors
are supposed to be partners with management, but ChinaCast's management is acting
as if it is superior to its investors.


Auditing Concerns

https://seekingalpha.com/article/262299-6-reasons-im-short-chinacast-education?source=all_articles_title 6/8


ChinaCast has made a point of noting that it is audited by a Big Four auditor (Deloitte)
and that Deloitte has not raised concerns about the acquisitions. In reality, however,
there are two big concerns about ChinaCast's auditing. The first of these is that Deloitte
has noted problems with ChinaCast's lack of effective financial controls as reported in
ChinaCast's 2011 10-K. Deloitte stated that:


The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in
management's assessment:


1) Lack of sufficient skilled resources in the finance team to meet the demands of
rapidly expanded businesses which resulted in a delayed closing process.


2) Lack of contemporaneous documentation of certain decisions made by the
Board of Directors.


I am curious as to what the Board of Directors has been doing recently. While the Board
was unable to document its decisions to Deloitte's liking, a certain board member, Ned
Sherwood, recently purchased two million shares of CAST in the following week after
the latest 10-K was filed. Why was Sherwood in such a rush to acquire stock (he
accounted for nearly 40% of the volume in the days he bought stock) while the public
was dumping their stock following the worrisome 10-K?


The second auditing-related problem is that Deloitte did not audit ChinaCast's
acquisitions when they occurred. For example, I noted the missing $48 million in Yupei's
acquisition of FTBC. Deloitte didn't audit the seller of this transaction (Hai Lai), instead,
Hai Lai's books were audited by Jimmy C.H. Cheung & Co. In addition, the Yupei
subsidiary that purchased FTBC from Hai Lai was also audited by yet another firm,
Shanghai Hongzheng, rather than Deloitte. Here is ChinaCast's comment on the
auditing of this acquisition from a recent 8-K:


This acquisition has been fully disclosed in our 2008 annual report (10K), which
includes financial statements audited by our auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
CPA Ltd., and filed with the SEC.

This is an artful avoidance of the issue. Sure, ChinaCast's 2008 annual report contains audited
reports from Deloitte. But the issue that matters is whether or not Yupei was audited by Deloitte,
and as you can see, local auditors were engaged, rather than Deloitte. If there was anything wrong
with the Yupei deal, Deloitte probably would have missed it since they didn't audit Yupei.


This article was written by


For statutory purpose, local auditors were engaged each year to audit all of our
local subsidiaries on a standalone basis. The local auditor for Yupei only
considered payment made directly by Yupei as long term investment and the
consideration paid by other companies within our Group were not included in
Yupei’ s accounts.


Numerous other acquired parties and ChinaCast subsidiaries were audited by smaller,
less reputable auditors and were excluded from Deloitte's audits. Deloitte's role, as the
China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME) scandal clearly showed, is merely to make sure
the books add up. Since ChinaCast excluded the dubious transactions from Deloitte's
audits, Deloitte would miss any fraud that ChinaCast may have committed in these
unusual transactions.


Future Outlook


I believe ChinaCast's past acquisitions are largely unexplained to investors, and as
such, there are potentially grave problems buried within them. I also doubt that
ChinaCast will be able to secure future acquisitions at prices beneficial to shareholders
as ChinaCast is competing with far better financed and far more reputable operators in a
small and fiercely competitive marketplace.


Also, ChinaCast's management has little credibility since it has been unwilling to frankly
and forthrightly explain these questionable acquisitions. ChinaCast has been unable to
answer OLP Global and the Financial Investigator's questions about the company's
unusual dealings. ChinaCast is running out of time before investors lose confidence in it.
ChinaCast shares will likely collapse unless the company reverses course and starts
openly communicating with shareholders regarding the labyrinthine structure of its
dealings.


Disclosure: I am short CAST.
