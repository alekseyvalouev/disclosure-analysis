Chinese State Media Confirms GeoInvesting's Key Finding On L&L
Energy
Sep. 24, 2013 3:50 PM ET45 comments
by: The GeoTeam


(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


On September 19, 2013, we published our research report on L&L Energy
(NASDAQ:LLEN), "Blowing the Whistle on LLEN." On Tuesday September 24, 2013 the
National Business Daily ("NBD"), a national financial newspaper in China, published an
article regarding our report. In this news piece, NBD reporters concurred with many of the
GeoTeam's findings.


We summarized a few of the more important points addressed by NBD:


1. The Hong Xing coal washing facility that LLEN claims to own in fact stopped its
operations in 2012. This point supports our similar finding and that LLEN significantly
misrepresented reported revenues from Hong Xing for its fiscal year ended April 2013.


2. Interestingly, the article also pointed out that LLEN does not own Hong Xing. Rather, it
is owned by an individual. This concurs with our evidence that LLEN does not own
Hong Xing according to officially chopped (sealed) SAIC records.


3. NBD stated that ZoneLin was shuttered and confirmed the government website source
of our information.


4. Confirming our finding, the NBD article also states that the DaPing mine was assigned
to Pan County Pannan Coal, not Union Energy.


5. Union Energy is approved to consolidate mines in Guizhou province, whereas LLEN is
not approved to consolidate mines in Guizhou province.


6. NBD found that none of the 5 mines LLEN claims to own in Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces are in fact owned by LLEN.


In our opinion, NBD's finding on Hong Xing is a de-listable event on its own.


We applaud the Chinese State Media for its quick action reviewing some of the most
important conclusions in our report. We can't help but notice that PRC reporters were able
to establish in a couple of days what L&L's so called "Independent Committee" apparently
have not verified in the past 5 days. What did NBD reporters do to research our evidence?
They simply showed up, asked questions, clicked on government websites, made some
calls and gave readers their truly independent findings.

Based on the fact that this article makes no reference to today's PR from LLEN, I think that it was actually
submitted before the PR was issued.

LLEN is a scam and always has been. It's amazing that lemmings buy the stock even after directors have resigned
one by one and with each director making negative comments about the company and crooked CEO. It gets halted
and delisted this time. Game over and it's about time.

I believe in local media article there's one more relevant message .... even if we assume the three Guizhou mines
belong to LLEN (which is irrealistic given the evidence), LLEN had in any event no future as a coal producer in
Guizhou, not having the minimum size to survive as a consolidator. LLEN was thus forced to sell to a Consolidator .
Highly likely, Lee's secret plan was to sell to Union those assets and move away and try again maybe in Shanxi
region. In my view, this is enough to not trust Lee anyway. He never disclosed he had no chance to survive on current
stance.

Sorry guys, but your CBD article was simply a rehash of your original claims and was obsolete the second "Dragon
Mining" issued its PR this morning (Pacific Daylight Time).


Your release of the original report shortly after the Mid-Autumn holiday began put you inside of LLEN's OODA Loop
(look it up) and put them in a position where they couldn't begin to mount a serious response until today.


I think you're going to find that LLEN is now inside your OODA Loop, and you're going to find it harder and harder to
respond quickly enough.


Frankly, I'm surprised you didn't cover your short yesterday and go long, as you had to know this was coming.

Seems to me that this State Media Article they quickly point out confirms their findings is actually quoting GEO's
"reporters" not their own. Much of what they "confirm" is taken directly from Geo's first article and is directed towards
their audience. So basically they're letting people know what GEO had to say and GEO is claiming they're confirming
evidence.


24 Sep 2013, 05:27 PM


VoraciousValue
I believe this is true. Upon comparison of Geo's original report and the China NBD, and reading the way the
China NBD is worded, it seems clear that the China NBD article is simply reporting on information provided to
them by Geo, and not any independent investigation of their own. I believe through some "creative"
translation Geo has tried to make it seem otherwise.


Here is one very clear example of where Geo claims that China NBD reporters confirmed their "findings"
when this was not the case. Geo's item 4 in the article above states: 
"4. Confirming our finding, the NBD article also states that the DaPing mine was assigned to Pan County
Pannan Coal, not Union Energy." 
However, the only reference in the China NBD article to Pan County Pannan Coal states as follows: 
"In addition, Geo’s report also claimed that, during the consolidation and reorganization activities within the
coal industry in Guizhou province, the Daping Mine was assigned to the Pan County Pannan Coal Investment

The China NBD is simply reporting on what Geo has claimed in their short report, nothing more.

CoolWatch
'China NBD article is simply reporting on information provided to them by Geo'. Not quite, if you google
translate this sentence ' 昨日（9月23日），《每日经济新闻》独家从美... 
(Yesterday (September 23), the "National Business Daily" learned exclusively from the United States research
house, Geoinvesting (hereinafter referred to as Geo), its senior vice president Dan David, that GEO has
submitted to the NASDAQ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Short report in relation to
LLEN and has initiated contact with the Stock Exchange.)'


You will notice the meaning is so different from what GEO says in its article that 'GeoInvesting is preparing to
file a whistleblower report to the NASDAQ and SEC that will accuse L&L Energy of defrauding investors by
.....'


Funny that GEO deliberately chose not to clarify the statement made by Dan David as quoted by NBD above
because readers in the US have never been told by GEO that it has filed anything with the regulators so far.


Maybe GEO should make such clarification here whether or not Dan did say that. If he didn't, GEO has the
OBLIGATION to ask NBD to make ratification immediately; otherwise, this little research house will show us
how sloppy again its work is.

LLEN nowhere says Hong Xing accounted for 39% of their revenue. They said coal washing accounted for 39% of
revenue. They had four wash plants they either own, operate or have a right to operate.


In the press release - http://prn.to/1bEeptp  
- they generate approximately $160 per washed ton of coal. That would be approximately 480,000 tons of coal a year.


- Dapuan – they did segregate this revenue so don’t include this.


- Hong Xing – they do state the specific amount generated, but has capacity of 600,000 tons. Throughout year they
state it was idle for significant periods of time but did run during the year, which Geo states.


- Ping Yi – they get paid back 3% to 5% of purchase price from washing coal. During the fiscal year they were paid
back $408,020 (http://1.usa.gov/1bEerkV) Which would equate to $10.2 million of the revenue or 64,000 tons.


- HunTai they got the rights to operate. They projected producing $63 million from per the press release above. Which
would be around 400,000 tons or the balance. That being said we


To jump to the conclusion that it was all from Hong Xing is factually incorrect and never stated by LLEN anywhere.
LLEN only references coal washing in their statements, never independent facilities. Someone from Geo tried to bait
them into saying this, but they didn’t break out segmented revenues per facility anywhere.

L&L Energy Produces Documentation to Repudiate Short-Seller Allegations 
2 hours 59 minutes ago - DJNF


SEATTLE, Sept. 24, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- L & L Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: "LLEN") ("L&L" or the "Company"), a U.S.-
based company with a track record of profitable energy (coal) operations in China, announced today that
management has produced key documents to the special committee of independent directors to repudiate the short
seller allegations posted by GeoInvesting. 
The GeoInvesting report alleges that L&L does not own the LuoZhou and LaShu mines. The claim hinges on the fact
that the mines are owned by an entity not named "L&L Energy." In the company's SEC Form 10-K report for the year
ended July 31, 2013, the company clearly states that it acquired the mines by purchasing equity interests in Union
Energy subsidiaries. The Company completed the acquisition by obtaining a 95% equity interest in two entities,
"Guizhou Union Energy Shun Da Inventory and Transport Corporation", the owner of LuoZhou Coal Mine and
"Guizhou Union Energy WuZhou Energy Development Corporation", the owner of LaShu Coal mine. The Company
supplied to its independent board committee the following documents: the equity acquisition agreement; a supplement
that explains the deal structure; a Proof of Purchase Status document stating that L&L fulfilled its payment obligations
under the agreement; and a legal opinion from DaCheng Law Offices that confirms L & L's controlling interest in the
LuoZhou and LaShu mines. Similarly, allegation 7 purports that SAIC filings show that neither Union Energy nor L&L
own the DaPing mine and ZoneLin Coking Plant. The Company has provided to its committee both the original and
translated versions of the Acquisition Agreement of DaPing Coal Mine, and an original copy of the ZoneLin
Acquisition Agreement. 
The Company is still collecting all relevant documents and is making progress in delivering evidence to the committee
of independent board members. The committee is to examine all information with a critical eye and formulate their
independent opinion to the public in due time.

All LLEN longs, just for a moment put your convictions to the side and take an objective look.


FACT: In hindsight, well over 70% of these Chinese reverse mergers have been shown to be frauds..trade for pennies
or have been delisted permanently. This fact alone should keep one from any Chinese RTO.


FACT: In the past 10 years, LLEN has seen a revolving door for their CFO's and independent auditors. Current
account firm is from a crackerjack box.


FACT: The illustrious "TDR...Taiwan Depository Receipt", it is a joke, complete BS...20 years experience and I never
heard of a legit company wanting to have a TDR. Reason? They ran out of suckers in the USA, with their weak
financials they could never list in Hong Kong and are smart enough not to try and list on the Shenzen where if you get
caught running a fraud the gvt. will kill you...lol.


You have a CEO with limited coal extraction background, he throws together a team which takes a coal washer..with
aims to be a sizable coal producer and now wants to branch out to clean coal technology??? Last 5 years have been
chock full of asset swaps, asset divestments.


LLEN, along with the remaining Chinese RTO's should be avoided like the plague.

I actually do find it sad when others lose $$ in an investment and my original post was not to mock but rather
to educate. I recommend longs to go back to basics and read all you can on Buffett, Jim Rogers, Naseem
Taleb(Fooled by Randomness is very under rated) as a start. Afterwards, If you are still drawn to chinese
RTO's, sub-penny stocks, investment newsletters, Iraqi dinar and/or the Vietnamese Dong then perhaps
equities are not for you and you should consider savings bonds or precious stones.


25 Sep 2013, 04:51 PM

Correction, most of the RTO companies to which you refer have not been proven frauds. They have been
delisted and their share prices have been decimated, but they have yet to see their day in court...which
normally takes three years plus.


Check Silver Corp and see how Mr. Block is doing with them.


The tide is turning and the security exchanges are starting to consider the short & distort's and associates
"inside traders".


I have no prediction for LLEN other than I have read their 2013 10K and much of Geo's report is hogwash.

Just look at the price of SVM, who you think won that fight?


There are 2 kinds of investors, one's who are obsessed with being 'right;...and one's who invest to make
money.


LLEN has engaged in numerous asset swaps, private placement of restricted shares, had to issue $5 million
in shares recently to pay off an accounts payable debt. If being a Chinese RTO wasn't bad enough, you are in
a toxic...race to the bottom coal sector that is in a terminal, structural decline. Even without fraud allegations
you'd have to be insane to play in this space. Good luck to all, you're going to need it.

Yes. SVM is winning they are trading at 22.7 times EPS. Precious metals are in the toilet, and Silver Corp still

BTW, as someone mentioned, the content at Geo's new link is primarily a quotational regurgitation of Geo's original
claims, with the one note that they did research the mine's ownership, and tracked the ownership to the same
companies, of which L&L stated they own a 95% controlling share. L&L presented documentation to that effect. So
this "retort" by Geo was refuted before it even went to ink.


So the sad thing is all these lawyers going after L&L now, as if they had done something wrong, when [it appears to
me, at least] it's Geo who bashed the stock without conducting sufficient due diligence... lots of research, but missing
key facts: subsidiary ownership -- ownership by proxy. If I were you, Geo, I'd be trying to figure out how to backpaddle
so as to avoid prosecution by L&L and the SEC.


25 Sep 2013, 08:55 AM


Jtechkid
Whats hurts Geo is they have all these research guys on the ground but obvious these guys don't see anything
positive thru their vision. 
Geo done a great job getting some fraud but since then Has not been real positive on any Chinese names in which
you had huge stealth rally- Qihu-nq-noah-sfun-yy-v... ect. we are talking huge moves. 
So are the guys on the ground in China just told to look for bad things? In which, if they want to get paid they come
back with bad reports. It's no different from the perma bulls which just see positive things no matter what. Geo just
turning into Muddy waters perma bear firm.

jdl51
It's all about creating doubt and then capitalizing on the dip. They'd have a bit more credibility if they didn't
take short positions before releasing their misinformation/distort... For small investors that can't navigate the
ins and outs of the Chinese system, hearing about records discrepancies is enough to cause them to dump
their shares. Geo made tens of millions on their latest report, so there's plenty of incentive to do what they do,
whether they're right or wrong doesn't matter to them.


25 Sep 2013, 11:20 AM

I believe they do not their own research team working in China. Most likely they may subscribe services from
some local agents which sell business information to short sellers at high price. So, information may be
retrieved on secondary research without or with limited verifications. GEO Investing is known to us to hold
poor quality control in research work. This time is no difference. They only take results that are favorable to
their short activities. That's all!

I just wonder how much did you pay and did you appoint them as your agents or you just "subscribed" their services
like your members do. How reliable and credible are these agents? Did you checked them out before the
engagements?

"Regarding the TDR, as you are aware we are preparing a Taiwan Depository Receipt, or TDR, listing to further
enhance our ability to raise capital. We expect that the application should be submitted in September which means
this month since nearly all of the work is completed.


As announced earlier, the accounting review of our F2012 and F2011 financial statements are completed and the
current F2013 review by KBMG should be done shortly. KBMG has indicated that they will issue an unqualified
opinion of the F2012 and F2011 financial statements, and it is their customary practice that KBMG does not issue
formal written opinions until the entire opinion of the GDR packages is submitted to the Taiwan Stock Exchange
because KBMG in Taiwan is also subject to Taiwan regulators."


From F1Q 2014 transcripts. Think KBMG actually means KPMG. Should KPMG issue an unqualified report it would
be interesting. It appears as if the report should have been completed by end of September but allowing for some
delays after a week it should really become interesting as provide more clues as to who is correct. Management or
the Geo team

One thing which worries me is that the company indicates that it is looking to be listed in Taiwan.


That means, they cannot get finance from US stock market.
