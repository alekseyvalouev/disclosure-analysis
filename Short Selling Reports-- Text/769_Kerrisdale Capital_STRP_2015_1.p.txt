As we discussed a year ago in our original report on Globalstar, the stock market has a sad 


history of gullibly buying into grandiose narratives about spectrum value. In Straight Path (NYSE 


MKT: STRP), the latest and, in some ways, most egregious example of this phenomenon, the 


market has found an unlikely object for its enthusiasm: a company with only seven employees 


and $426,000 of annual core revenue headed by a 29-year-old whose previous job was serving 


as the rabbi of a 50-person synagogue in the Bronx – a far cry from telecom. 





Despite these obvious red flags, Straight Path trades at an almost $600 million market cap 


because investors regard it as a play on “5G,” the nebulous label applied to the next generation 


of cellular technology after 4G LTE. Though still years away from standardization, let alone 


commercial release, 5G might include (as just one component) the ability to use extremely high, 


“millimeter-wave” (mmWave) frequencies that are currently relegated to niche, non-mobile use 


cases as a result of their very poor propagation. Straight Path holds a large portfolio of spectrum 


licenses (primarily in the 39GHz band), supposedly making the company an enormous 


beneficiary of the move toward mmWave technology. In 2015 alone, Straight Path’s stock price 


has appreciated 151%, with the latest move up triggered by Verizon’s marketing announcement 


in September that it would launch 5G “field trials” next year. 





But mmWave is just one small subset of 5G, and Straight Path’s spectrum is just one minuscule 


fraction of the gargantuan amount of mmWave bandwidth likely to be available, much of it for 


free. For example, telecom regulators from the Americas, including the FCC, are already 


considering rezoning almost 34 gigahertz of mmWave spectrum for mobile use, and that total is 


likely to grow. Straight Path’s 39GHz portfolio – with less than 0.7 GHz of average bandwidth 


nationwide – is thus a tiny fraction of the pending supply. Not only is the portfolio nothing 


special; it also has the distinct disadvantage of being fragmented and non-contiguous. Though 


one sell-side bull has characterized the future of Straight Path’s spectrum as “[p]erhaps…no 


different than Manhattan real estate,” a more appropriate analogue would be a few small, 


scattered plots of undeveloped land in the middle of the world’s largest desert.  





Moreover, though even widespread deployment of mmWave frequencies would still fail to 


generate real value for Straight Path, such deployment is unlikely to ever take place. While 


complex multi-antenna arrays may help to overcome weak propagation in a cost-effective way – 


itself an open question – mmWave transmissions still won’t be able to go through walls or over 


hills, severely limiting their usefulness, and will require extremely dense and thus very 


expensive networks. There is no straight path here – just a winding, dusty road to failure.

I. Investment Highlights 


 
5G ≠ mmWave. Straight Path enthusiasts tend to mix up distinct concepts, speaking as if every 


new announcement about “5G” – like Verizon’s – necessarily involves mmWave. But many key 


aspects of the nascent 5G vision have nothing to do with high-frequency spectrum at all. New 


air interfaces and massive MIMO, for instance, are technologies that can greatly enhance 


throughput in the bands already used for 3G and 4G, as well as low-frequency bands to be 


rolled out in the future, like the 600MHz band, which FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler described in 


August as “a prime candidate for deployment of a wide-area 5G coverage layer.” In early 


October, the Chinese equipment vendor Huawei and the Japanese carrier NTT DOCOMO 


“announced…the world’s first successful large-scale field trial of 5G new radio access 


technologies,” including Sparse Code Multiple Access and Filtered OFDM, achieving peak 


downlink throughput of 3.6 gigabits per second (Gbps). But this trial didn’t use mmWave: the 


press release clearly states that it used “the sub-6GHz frequency band.” Indeed, the first 


commercial deployments of 5G – whenever they occur – are widely expected to use 


conventional bands, not mmWave. 





5G is also about far more than just higher throughput for smartphones. Key players see it 


primarily as a platform for communicating with large numbers of distributed sensors (the 


“Internet of Things”) and other machines, like driverless cars, that may require extremely low 


latencies and high reliability but not necessarily large quantities of data. (Driverless cars, for 


instance, are not going to be watching lots of ultra-high-resolution video.) For these crucial and 


novel use cases at the heart of 5G planning, mmWave is irrelevant. Indeed, Verizon’s own 


promotional video about its 5G efforts emphasizes the Internet of Things and features the 


company’s vice president of network planning stating (at 0:54) that “people have enough 


throughput for the kinds of services they’re performing today on the mobile network” – hardly an 


indication that enormous amounts of mmWave bandwidth will come in handy any time soon. 





Straight Path’s spectrum is just one tiny drop in the mmWave bucket. Straight Path likes to 


point out (see slide 6) that it holds “96% of active 39GHz FCC licenses”; credulous listeners 


interpret this as a monopoly on “5G spectrum.” Yet the company’s 828 39GHz licenses 


comprise just 34% of the total 2,450 licenses that were up for bid at the FCC’s 2000 auction. 


The explanation is that so many of the companies that attempted to use the 39GHz band gave 


up, went out of business entirely, or ran into trouble with the FCC that large numbers of licenses 


across the country were voluntarily canceled or forcibly terminated. (Indeed, Straight Path itself, 


in its previous identity as IDT Spectrum, canceled 298 of its 39GHz licenses in 2010 – almost a 


third of the portfolio it had acquired out of the Winstar bankruptcy.) Based on the FCC’s recently 


released Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), these unused licensed will ultimately be re-


auctioned to the public, thereby completely circumventing Straight Path. 





But the future sale of a large amount of 39GHz spectrum not held by Straight Path is just a 


small part of a very large problem: the only reason to use mmWave bands at all is because

there is so much spectrum available there. Without this vast supply, research into mmWave 


mobile broadband might be an interesting academic problem but would be an obvious 


commercial non-starter given all the immense and as yet unsolved technical difficulties. The 


only practical reason to bother is the prospect of accessing huge blocks of spectrum, which 


regulators around the world are beginning the process of freeing up. From a technological 


perspective, there is nothing special about Straight Path’s 39GHz band as opposed to the many 


other mmWave bands, including several that either are or are likely to become unlicensed and 


thus free to use. 





The chart below illustrates the size (in gigahertz of bandwidth) of the mmWave bands most 


likely to be repurposed for mobile use in the medium term, putting Straight Path’s holdings in 


perspective: 





  
CITEL/CEPT/APT/RCC are regional regulatory bodies for the Americas/Europe/Asia/Eurasia, 


respectively. 


Note: “FCC NPRM bands” includes the 60GHz band (57-64 GHz) already available for unlicensed use.

Above, on the left, we show the aggregate amount of high-frequency bandwidth proposed for 


consideration as future homes for mobile broadband by various regional regulatory bodies, 


including CITEL, the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, of which the FCC is a 


member. These proposals will be further discussed at the upcoming World Radiocommunication 


Conference (WRC) in November and finalized in 2019. We also show the total size of the bands 


in the FCC’s recent NPRM, including the existing 60GHz band, already available for unlicensed 


use, including mobile. But these bands are only the first step – FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler 


has already publicly pledged to consider others in the near future. With 20 to 30 GHz in sight, 


Straight Path’s nationwide average of 817 MHz, including 691 MHz in the 39GHz band and 126 


MHz in the LMDS band, looks trivially small. (Even that total is overstated since much of the 


LMDS band is excluded from both the NPRM and the international proposals.) Far from a

mmWave monopoly, Straight Path’s holdings amount to a drop in the bucket. Anyone interested 


in using mmWave spectrum will have an embarrassment of riches. 





Moreover, the supply is likely to grow further, from tens to hundreds of gigahertz, a point ably 


made in 2011 by two of the mmWave researchers then at Samsung, one of whom went on to 


become Straight Path’s chief technology officer. They argued that there was 252 GHz of readily 


usable bandwidth between 3 and 300 GHz, and that even if only 40% could be unlocked for 


mobile networks, it would amount to “more than 200 times the spectrum currently allocated for 


this purpose below 3GHz.”

Indeed, one of the benefits of mmWave technology that the Samsung mmWave group has often 


pointed out is that there’s so much spectrum for the taking that even exclusive access will be 


incredibly cheap – potentially good news for carriers and consumers but not spectrum owners 


like Straight Path. 





In keeping with the absence of any compelling reason to prefer Straight Path’s spectrum to 


other similar bands, recent 5G demos have focused elsewhere. For example, back in July 2014, 


Ericsson, in collaboration with NTT DOCOMO and SK Telecom, demonstrated 5Gbps speeds 


using the 15GHz band. In March, NTT DOCOMO and Nokia achieved a speed of 4.5 Gbps 


using the 70GHz band. In April, at the Brooklyn 5G Summit, Nokia demonstrated “a 10 Gbps

peak rate system over the air at 73 GHz.” Consumer products using the large, unlicensed 


60GHz band via the WiGig protocol already exist. In short, mmWave spectrum will be a 


commodity in vast supply, and Straight Path has nothing special to offer. In fact, because 


Straight Path’s 39GHz holdings consist of scattered 50MHz units, not the very wide contiguous 


channels sought after by industry participants, it’s difficult to see how, without significant favors 


granted by the FCC, it will ever be practical to use its spectrum for 5G. 





mmWave spectrum has fundamental limitations that, even if technology improves, will 


sharply restrict its usefulness. To be sure, major companies have developed prototypes and 


simulations showing that sophisticated antenna arrays using very wide bandwidths can 


overcome some of the propagation problems of the mmWave bands. But it’s a long way from 


large, clunky prototypes to real-world networks and user devices. In particular, even if signals 


can reliably achieve targeted ranges on the order of hundreds of meters, they will still suffer 


from enormous losses when going from outside to indoors – orders of magnitude worse than 


conventional cellular frequencies, many of which already struggle with in-building penetration. 


Since approximately 80% of cellular usage is indoors (almost always using signals transmitted 


from outside), the practical applications of mmWave technology will be few and far between. 


mmWave handsets also face severe challenges since the user’s head and fingers can easily 


block the narrow beams used by mmWave signals, potentially requiring multiple duplicate 


antenna arrays on different sides of the handset. High power consumption is also a problem. 


Perhaps most dauntingly, mmWave networks will require extremely high base-station densities, 


thousands of times higher than existing networks, implying enormously costly and time-


consuming buildouts for no clear economic benefit. It’s no wonder that the CEO of one Hong 


Kong-based carrier dismissed 5G as the creation of “equipment vendors…asking us to plow 


more money in there for a purpose that is not yet entirely clear….You don’t need that much 


bandwidth.” 





Valuation precedents and benchmarks imply that Straight Path’s spectrum is worth >90% 


less than its current market cap. Even if we ignore the shortcomings of Straight Path’s 


spectrum, the likelihood that mmWave networks will simply never be deployed on a large scale, 


and the vast supply of highly similar competing spectrum, Straight Path is still worth very little. 


For example, based on the price at which Level 3, a large, savvy telecom firm, was willing to sell 


39GHz and LMDS licenses in 2012 – just $203,000 for more than 46 billion MHz-pops – Straight 


Path’s entire portfolio is worth just $1 million. Attempting to extrapolate from dollar-per-MHz-pop 


levels paid for conventional cellular spectrum but adjusting for the vastly higher cost of 


deploying the extremely dense network that mmWave would require generates an estimated 


value of approximately $40mm – more than 90% below the current market cap. Simply put, 


Straight Path is a bubble, driven by hype, misconceptions, and wishful thinking.

II. Company Overview 





Straight Path: Capitalization and Financial Results 





Straight Path’s origins date back to the FCC’s auctions in 1998-2000 of large blocks of spectrum 


in what are now known as the LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service) and 39GHz bands. 


The FCC viewed this high-frequency spectrum as a platform “to create robust competition to the 


local telephone companies” by allowing new players to transmit voice calls and data wirelessly 


(via line-of-sight links between fixed antennas) rather than using local phone lines. Winstar 


Communications, founded in 1990, was one of those players, a “Wall Street darling” that spent 


billions of dollars affixing microwave dishes to office buildings in order to make use of the high-


frequency spectrum it had purchased. But, despite Winstar’s claims that its so-called “Wireless 


Fiber” was superior to actual optical fiber – claims Straight Path has repeated – very few paying 


customers were convinced, and Winstar filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. 





However, IDT, a New Jersey-based telecom company founded by Howard Jonas, bought 


Winstar’s operating assets – including its 39GHz and LMDS spectrum – for $42.5 million in a 


transaction that Jonas described in the official press release like so: 





This is an incredible deal. It might not top the Dutch settlers buying the Island of 


Manhattan for twenty four dollars, but it comes pretty close. 





But IDT had no more luck than Winstar at making money from mmWave, and by 2004 it had 


largely discontinued its efforts. (It even unsuccessfully sued Blackstone and other advisors 


involved in the Wintrust bankruptcy for, according to Law360, “costing IDT more than $300 


million” by misrepresenting Winstar’s financial condition.) Nonetheless, after forming a new 


entity, IDT Spectrum, to own the Winstar licenses, IDT attempted to take it public, filing an S-1 


in 2005. The S-1 spoke of how “the continuing deployment of 3G services [would]…cause the 


demand for bandwidth by mobile wireless customers to increase steadily” and described IDT 


Spectrum as “well positioned to provide a single source of fixed wireless spectrum solutions 


across a variety of geographic areas and bandwidth requirements.” By the end of the year, 


however, IDT “postponed” the Spectrum IPO, citing “market conditions” and the availability of 


alternative funding sources but reiterating that the company was still “developing a fixed

wireless network platform that will integrate its wireless spectrum with its operational 


management capabilities.” 





But that didn’t come to pass. By late 2006, IDT had closed its Spectrum operations; its CEO at 


the time, James Courter, noted that “it became clear that the United States is moving a little bit 


more slowly towards second and third and even fourth generation cellular devices. And 


therefore those carriers such as…Sprint and others, T-Mobile, that would use this spectrum, 


don’t really need it at the present time” 1 – presaging likely future disappointment about 5G. Still, 


the company held out hope that demand might materialize beyond the following 18 months. 





That didn’t happen either. In late 2007, a questioner on an earnings call asked Jonas, in his role 


as chairman, why he no longer highlighted IDT’s spectrum holdings (emphasis added): 





<Q - Clayton Moran>: Okay. One more question. You mentioned a bunch of assets in 


your prepared remarks; you didn't mention anything about the spectrum, you are not 


optimistic there anymore? Can you give us your thoughts? 





<A - Howard Jonas>: Yeah. Well, we have two big piles of spectrum. One is the 39-


gigahertz that we have all across the country, and the other one is the 28-gigahertz that 


we have in the major cities. We are seeing activity in the 28-gigahertz band because 


there is a lot of equipment that's made for that band and so forth. So, I believe we have 


entered into a contract with NextLink to do some leasing, and I believe we've entered 


into something with Hughes in a joint venture. We are not having the same success in 


the 39-gigahertz field, because there's not like the equipment out there to really use to 


do it. We are working with universities, we are looking at new applications, I mean some 


of them seem nuts, like you can irradiate bugs from airplanes that are attacking plants – 


I don't think that's going to be where we wind up going. But, I would say, I am not – don't 


think that that's one of the great hidden values of the company. But that's what I am 


saying today, I mean we are working on developing it.2 





Within six years, IDT’s spectrum had gone from a bargain on par with the 17th-century 


“purchase” of Manhattan to a multi-hundred-million-dollar embarrassment, the best use of which 


might be irradiating bugs from airplanes. In 2009 a press release announced, “IDT Spectrum 


Puts FCC License Holdings Up for Sale”: 





ID Spectrum…said today that it is accepting offers for its portfolio of 38 GHz3 and 28-31 


GHz spectrum licenses. … “Networks nationwide are straining to accommodate new 


bandwidth intensive applications. Our licenses enable scalable and cost effective 


wireless backhaul and last mile solutions,” said Michael Rapaport, President of IDT 


Spectrum. The deadline for offers to be submitted is Thursday, November 12, 2009.

But there were no buyers. IDT’s CFO put a positive spin on it: “Although the auction generated 


no bids, we continue in discussions with interested parties.”4  





What happened next became the subject of litigation between IDT and Michael Rapaport, the 


former head of IDT Spectrum. In Rapaport’s version of events, IDT had given up, “written down 


the value of these licenses to zero on its balance sheet and expressed no interest in renewing 


the licenses, which were set to expire in October 2010.”5 But Rapaport insisted that the licenses 


“could be worth millions of dollars.” Though, according to Rapaport, “[t]he Jonases [Howard and 


his son Shmuel, IDT’s chief operating officer] were initially skeptical about the future value of 


Spectrum’s licenses,” they agreed to attempt to renew some of the licenses, splitting the 


regulatory costs with Rapaport personally in exchange for ceding to Rapaport a percentage of 


any future “proceeds generated by sales or leases of such licenses”6 – ranging from 12.5% for 


“Schedule A” licenses (one in each market) to 49% for “Schedule B” licenses (additional 


spectrum in higher-end markets). As to the remaining “Schedule C” licenses – some 298 in total 


– IDT allowed them to lapse. 





Rapaport, who claimed he was “the only IDT employee spending any significant amount of time 


working on the Spectrum portfolio,”7 began generating small amounts of revenue from spectrum 


leases and collecting his share of the proceeds via an entity he named Spectrum Holdings 


Technologies, LLC. In late 2011, he hit it big, convincing the carrier MetroPCS (since acquired 


by T-Mobile) to buy hundreds of megahertz in New York, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and 


Orlando for $6.8 million. According to Rapaport, once IDT realized that it would now be on the 


hook for a million-dollar payout under the terms of its deal with him, IDT reneged and cut him 


loose. By mid-2012, Davidi Jonas – Howard Jonas’s son and Shmuel Jonas’s brother – took 


over as head of IDT Spectrum. 





Before that, however, in early 2012, Rapaport negotiated the purchase of additional 39GHz and 


LMDS licenses from LICT Corporation and Level 3 Communications. Although these licenses 


were on the verge of expiration, Rapaport – and presumably the sellers – knew that it might be 


possible to meet the relevant build-out requirements quickly and at relatively low cost and thus 


secure renewal. Still, the sellers placed little value on the spectrum: LICT sold its licenses for no 


money upfront but a share of any future proceeds, while Level 3 sold its licenses – amounting to 


46 billion MHz-pops – for just $203,000, a price of approximately $0.000004 per MHz-pop. 





But the legal buyer in these purchases was Spectrum Holdings, not IDT. As Rapaport’s dispute 


with his ex-employer intensified – Rapaport alleged that Davidi Jonas was “dispatched…to loiter 


an entire day outside of [Rapaport’s] house with no purpose other than to intimidate [him]” and

“told [him] that IDT would ‘fight dirty’”8 – he refused to hand over the licenses that IDT claimed 


were rightfully the company’s, not his. Under a June 2013 settlement, IDT gave Rapaport $1.5 


million plus 50% of the proceeds from certain licenses up to a cap of $3.25 million; in exchange, 


Rapaport’s Spectrum Holdings assigned to IDT the disputed licenses from LICT and Level 3. (In 


its financial statements, Straight Path values these licenses – 33% of its total license count – at 


$350,000.)  





In May 2013, IDT filed to spin off its high-frequency spectrum holdings into a new company, 


Straight Path Communications, led by Davidi Jonas. Straight Path also included a wholly 


unrelated asset: a portfolio of soon-to-expire patents that the company claimed a host of deep-


pocketed technology firms were infringing upon. But after recovering $18 million in gross 


settlement receipts, Straight Path suffered a major legal setback in late 2014 when the Patent 


and Trademark Office’s Trial and Appeal Board invalidated many parts of a key patent; 


additional patents are also being challenged. Thus Straight Path’s patent-troll strategy – the 


company’s only source of positive cash flow historically – has ground to a halt, although accrual 


accounting has spread the recognition of its past victories across multiple quarters. While 


Straight Path does lease some of its spectrum to a small handful of customers for backhaul and 


fixed wireless connectivity, that operation generates only a few hundred thousand dollars of 


annual revenue; its expenses are 5x higher. But the market no longer cares about Straight 


Path’s IP or its actual spectrum-lease business; the story it has bought into is all about 5G, 


which is therefore our focus in what follows. 





III. 5G Is Not Near and Does Not Require mmWave 





Our answer to the 5G question is, “Hell, we just rolled out LTE in the last 36 months!” For God’s 


sake, let us sweat that for a while and utilize that! 


—Dave Mayo, T-Mobile SVP of technology, September 20159 





5G is not all about bands above 6 GHz; bands below 6 GHz are just as, if not more, important.  


—Ofcom (UK telecom regulator), April 2015 





Anyone that claims today to know the details surrounding 5G is either a clairvoyant, a liar, or a 


little bit of both.  The truth is that while there are a number of generally accepted principles 


regarding the requirements of 5G, no one knows for certain when those requirements will be 


implemented (Phase 1 or Phase 2), or the detailed technical specifications regarding how they 


will be implemented. 


—Signals Research Group, September 2015 





By 2020 the global investment in LTE will amount to something like $1 trillion, with physical 


infrastructure, spectrum licenses, software and service. LTE will have had many significant

to obsolete that? What is the financial case for an upgrade? Why can’t we sweat that asset, 


rather than scrapping it? I fear we are in danger of creating a very expensive white elephant: a 


compromise that does not actually deliver any compelling advantages or business case. 


 —Rupert Baines, technology strategy and marketing consultant at Real Wireless, April 


2015 





While 5G is often discussed in the context of the higher frequencies, existing “traditional” mobile 


frequencies may also be candidates for employing a next generation of technology. Moreover, 


the term “5G” sometimes appears to be used to describe an evolution from the existing 


technology (4G) to a more advanced version – but in reality the technologies for above-24 GHz 


spectrum may involve radical departures from existing ones. 





While it is important to explore the potential for use of the above-24 GHz bands, the 


Commission and industry will need to overcome substantial hurdles before the spectrum can 


potentially be used for mobile commercial use. Technological breakthroughs and major 


investments will be necessary before these frequencies are commercially viable. By contrast, 


the know-how to deploy mobile operations using more traditional mobile frequencies already 


exists… 


—Verizon, January 2015 





Rather than focusing principally on the mmW bands above 30 GHz, the Commission would be 


better served by a focus on bands below 6 GHz and subsequently 10-30 GHz, with bands 


above 30 GHz being phased in over time…Systems will need to be engineered for the mass 


market, and the state of the art is yet to make significant headway beyond laboratory 


prototypes…It is premature to address what licensing and regulatory mechanisms are most 


appropriate for 5G systems, especially mmW spectrum, given the substantial technical 


development that needs to be done. 


—Ericsson, January 2015 





I would say, people are expecting that the U.S. is going to be populated with 5G cell sites by 


2020, whatever they're having I would like to have some of it, but I don't think that's a realistic 


expectation. 


—Davidi Jonas, Straight Path CEO, June 201510 








Before we discuss the technological and economic problems facing Straight Path’s spectrum, 


it’s important to distinguish between 5G marketing and lobbying, on the one hand, and reality, 


on the other. The telecom industry has a long history of forecasting imminent triumphs and 


disasters, only to experience far less dramatic outcomes. One study outlined the story of 3G:

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many hailed the then upcoming allocations of 3G 


spectrum as a revolutionizing step in telecommunications. Fueled by the success of the 


Internet, 3G promised to take “mobile telephony beyond just voice … giving people a 


whole range of new exciting services down to their mobile phone” … The anticipated 


significance of 3G initially led to exuberantly high spectrum valuations. … 





With 3G reaching mass markets, analysts quickly began speculating [about]…when 3G 


would become the dominant technology. … Recent data on 3G penetration rates 


demonstrate that these and many other statements and forecasts were far too optimistic 


as actual 3G penetration rates fell significantly short from most of these claims. … The 


December 2009 US 3G penetration rate was 26.1 percent, which is less than one third of 


the number forecasted for the US by various analysts for 2010. 





Eventually, the popularity of smartphones led to more widespread usage of 3G and now 4G, 


but, relative to the early optimism about deployments, these technologies arrived more than a 


decade late. When industry players now talk about 5G timelines, it’s important to parse their 


language carefully: “beyond 2020” may sound soon, but the interval between completed 


technical standards and real-life commercial build-outs has typically been many, many years. 


LTE Advanced, for instance, dates back to at least 2009, but capacity-enhancing features like 


carrier aggregation have barely begun to be used. 





The same disconnect between rhetoric and reality characterizes discourse about the so-called 


spectrum crunch. In 2010, an FCC technical paper suggested that mobile data usage was 


growing so rapidly that “an additional 275 MHz of spectrum will be needed…in 2014,” beyond 


the 547 MHz estimated to be already available in 2009. These projections assumed steady 


network densification, with cell sites reaching almost 345,000 by 2014, but concluded that 


infrastructure alone wouldn’t be enough. In reality, data from the wireless industry group CTIA 


show that the number of cell sites in 2014 fell short of these projections by 14%, and large 


amounts of the 547 MHz of spectrum allocated in 2009 have only just started to be deployed or 


are still unused today, in particular the large 2.5GHz band largely controlled by Sprint. 


Nonetheless, even with fewer cell sites and much less spectrum in use than expected, the 


spectrum “deficit” never materialized. A combination of Wi-Fi usage, better spectral efficiency, 


consumer price elasticity, and faulty projection methodologies, among other factors, have belied 


the doomsaying. 





Even today, with smartphones nearly universal, CTIA figures indicate that growth in cellular data 


usage has decelerated sharply, from 120% in 2013 to just 26% in 2014. Moreover, with large 


stores of available spectrum still unused, including DISH’s ~75 MHz, the carriers’ recently 


acquired AWS-3 licenses, the virgin 100MHz in the 3.5GHz small-cell band, the 600MHz band 


scheduled for auction next year, the unlicensed 5GHz band expected to be used by the 


controversial LTE-U and LAA technologies, and Sprint’s still largely fallow 2.5GHz holdings, 


there are hundreds of untouched megahertz available. In the words of two telecom analysts, 


“Spectrum exhaust is simply not on the horizon.” Both 4G LTE technology itself and the existing

wireless spectrum inventory will work perfectly well for many years to come – perhaps 


indefinitely. 





If that’s the case, then why is the industry talking about 5G and mmWave at all? One reason is 


intra-sector self-interest: equipment vendors, especially newer entrants, would always like 


carriers to buy more sophisticated, more expensive next-generation infrastructure and thus must 


pitch the next big thing. Another reason is politics: ceteris paribus, the mobile industry would 


always prefer the option of more spectrum and therefore constantly competes with other groups, 


like the satellite industry, to convince regulators that its spectrum needs are more pressing than 


theirs. Indeed, the timing of the recent wave of 5G demonstrations is likely linked to the 


upcoming global regulatory conference WRC-15, which will help to define the agenda for the 


next major conference, WRC-19, where the FCC and its international peers will begin to 


reallocate high-frequency spectrum. The more enticing the 5G vision, the more likely regulators 


will be to favor mobile interests over satellite interests; the more dire the forecasts of spectrum 


scarcity, the more generous the allocations. This political process does not tend to foster even-


handed analysis. “We probably have enough spectrum already, but we wouldn’t mind some 


more!” makes for an underwhelming rallying cry. 





Indeed, novel spectrum is just one part – arguably a small one – of the industry’s early plans for 


5G. As wireless service revenues have, in the aggregate, stopped growing, and ARPUs have 


declined, a compelling financial rationale for deploying a costly new network just to provide an 


enhanced version of the now familiar consumer mobile-broadband experience is difficult to 


imagine. Instead, operators hope to broaden their addressable market by serving connected 


machines – for example, remote-controlled industrial equipment or autonomous vehicles. Such 


use cases have little in common with looking at Instagram on an iPhone. The challenge is less a 


lack of bandwidth than high latencies, inadequate reliability, an uncertain business model, and 


other orthogonal issues. Connecting with far-flung sensors and devices won’t require gigabits 


per second of throughput but likely will require good, cost-effective signal propagation; mmWave 


is pointless on the first count and worthless on the second. Even for conventional mobile 


broadband – looking at Instagram on an iPhone – improvements like massive MIMO (using 


large numbers of coordinated antenna elements to simultaneously transmit signals) can improve 


throughput using existing spectrum, as well as greenfields like the 3.5GHz band. 





In response to the FCC’s Notice of Inquiry regarding mmWave spectrum, commenter after 


commenter pointed out that 5G, when it comes, will come to low-band spectrum first. AT&T, for 


instance, spoke of the “ample lead time for 5G deployment” and said, diplomatically, “As the 


earliest form of 5G will occur in frequency bands below 6 GHz, the near-term spectrum need for 


5G is not only the spectrum above 24 GHz, but also the spectrum located below 6 GHz.” T-


Mobile noted that “LTE is still in the early stages of its lifecycle, which for cellular technologies 


has historically been approximately 20 years from launch to peak penetration” and urged the 


FCC to focus on freeing up more sub-1GHz spectrum. Verizon was similarly tepid – albeit 


politely so – about any near-term application for mmWave spectrum in a world where LTE and 


conventional bands still have a long way to go. Indeed, by far the most enthusiastic supporters 


of mmWave 5G are incumbent license-holders like Straight Path, who hope to profit from it, and

academic and industry researchers, who view it as an interesting technical problem but are 


removed from direct market pressures. More practical-minded operators have barely started to 


think about low-band 5G – which is still years away from having a technical definition – let alone 


the far more exotic possibilities of centimeter-wave 5G or millimeter-wave 5G. Straight Path 


bulls who expect anything more than marketing and demos in the foreseeable future will be 


sorely disappointed. 





Indeed, it’s unclear whether the core value proposition of mmWave 5G – “gigabit mobility,” as 


Straight Path puts it – will even resonate with consumers. In Wi-Fi, for instance, depending on 


the access point and user device, gigabit speeds are already possible in the 5GHz band using 


the 802.11ac protocol – but this improvement has hardly caused a step change in Wi-Fi uptake 


or gotten much mass-market attention. Consider some simple arithmetic. According to Ericsson, 


in North America, data traffic per active smartphone totaled 2.4 gigabytes per month or 


approximately 80 megabytes per day. Assuming an average US LTE speed of 10 Mbps (based 


on OpenSignal data), this implies a total of 63 seconds per day spent downloading mobile data. 


If speeds rose to 1 Gbps, that time would drop to just 0.6 second per day, thus saving the 


average users about a minute per day. But even if we value time at a rate of $100,000 per year, 


a minute is still only worth $0.19; a minute per day would be just $69 per year. To achieve those 


savings with mmWave 5G would require inventing new radio technology and deploying orders 


of magnitude more base stations than currently exist, and it would still likely falter in areas with 


trees, hills, or severe rain, not to mention when going from outdoors to indoors. To be sure, data 


usage will likely continue to increase, but not at an astronomical rate – Ericsson, for instance, 


only expects usage to reach 14 GB per month by 2020. Downloading a billion bits in a second is 


great, but it doesn’t do much good when users are only interested in downloading that many bits 


in a month. Carrier commentary and advertising about the importance of consistently good 


throughput rather than simply exciting-sounding peak throughput represent an oblique 


acknowledgement of this point: today, ever higher download speeds per se generate little 


incremental value for consumers. 





Straight Path has happily cast itself as the royal road to 5G, with the move to “gigabit mobility” in 


the mmWave depicted as thrilling and inevitable. But it will be likely be the 2030s before 5G truly 


exists on a large scale, and even later, if ever, before the mmWave version of 5G comes into 


being in the few places where it might make economic sense. With all this “ample lead time,” in 


the words of AT&T, global regulators will have the luxury of studying and rewriting rules for large 


swaths of high-band spectrum well before it becomes commercially relevant – creating an 


unprecedented wave of spectrum supply that will dwarf Straight Path’s holdings.

IV. Straight Path’s Spectrum Is a Small Slice of the 


Enormous mmWave Pie 





The use of millimeter wave bands will open the door to an abundance of spectrum…[L]arge 


chunks of spectrum are available… 


—Nokia, February 2015 





 Enormous blocks of spectrum [are] available for short range outdoor or indoor access 


—Alcatel-Lucent, May 2015 





The high interest in millimetre wave bands has risen due to the enormous amount of bandwidth 


that lies in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. With respect to the present regulatory 


status, typically V-band offers 7 GHz bandwidth of contiguous spectrum (57 - 64 GHz), 


extendable to 9 GHz whenever also the 64 - 66 GHz is open for fixed services, and E-band 


provides two times 5 GHz bandwidth, namely 10 GHz aggregate spectrum (71 - 76 GHz and 81 


- 86 GHz). Similarly, at frequency bands above 100 GHz, there are blocks of plentiful spectrum, 


which could be allowed for extra bandwidth for future broadband wireless transmission services. 


… The millimetre wave frequency range provides massive and underutilized spectrum… 


—European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) millimetre Wave 


Transmission Industry Specification Group, August 2015 





[A]bove 6 GHz, sharing of the spectrum may become easier due to the limited range of the 


systems and this could be further improved by the use of advanced antenna techniques with 


greater directionality. 


—Ofcom, January 2015 





The technologies being developed for advanced mobile applications in frequencies above 24 


GHz could allow opportunities for reuse of spectrum and for spectrum sharing that are not 


possible at lower frequencies with current technology. In principle, tightly packed base stations 


with dynamic beamforming capabilities should be able to share the same channels without 


causing mutual interference by pointing their beams in non-interfering directions. 


—FCC Notice of Inquiry, October 2014 








Spectrum bulls often liken spectrum to a natural resource in fixed, finite supply; scarcity, they 


believe, is what gives it such great value. While this scarcity is as much a product of technology 


and regulation as of physics, it’s true that the low-band spectrum most efficiently used by 


existing systems is limited in quantity. But mmWave spectrum is a different story altogether. In 


high bands, regulatory allocations contain hundreds of times more bandwidth than they do in 


low bands, which helps to compensate for the inherent propagation challenges of higher 


frequencies. Straight Path’s favored 39GHz band is indeed wide, but so are many of the other 


mmWave bands under consideration for future mobile usage by global policymakers, and these 


bands in the aggregate are very large indeed.

Consider the bands that the US is proposing for study at WRC-19, according to an August blog 


post by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. Together, they amount to 22 GHz of spectrum, with the 


largest individual piece by far being the 59.3-71.0GHz band, with almost 12 contiguous GHz:

50.4 52.6 2.2 


59.3 71.0 11.7 


 Total 22.2 





Only a subset of those bands was included in the FCC’s recent NPRM, which proposed 


aggregate bandwidth of 10.85 GHz for mobile use, on top of the 7 GHz already available in the 


unlicensed 60GHz band. But, in response to complaints from some FCC commissioners that 


even more spectrum should be considered – at least another 12.5 GHz, according to 


Commissioner Ajit Pai – Chairman Wheeler has pledged a “follow-on proceeding” in the coming 


months to go further still.11 





But the story doesn’t stop there. Everyone agrees that the ideal outcome for 5G would be global 


harmonization of potential mmWave bands, and given how early it is relative to any plausible 


timeline for commercial deployments of mmWave 5G, international regulatory agencies aim to 


be open-minded rather than prematurely anoint any one band as the answer. Different regional 


regulatory groups have devised their own proposals based on different criteria, but in every 


case they’re looking at tens of gigahertz, multiples of what Straight Path has to offer. The chart 


below illustrates the proposals graphically. (CITEL is the regional organization for telecom 


regulators in the Americas; CEPT, Europe; APT, the Asia-Pacific region; and RCC, Central 


Asia/Eurasia, including Russia.)

mmWave Bands Tentatively Proposed by Regional Regulatory Bodies

By 2019, when the WRC-19 conference takes place, the hope is that, after studying many of 


these bands, regulators can reach consensus about which are the most plausible targets for 5G 


developments, taking into account not just technological constraints but also alternative 


spectrum uses, which vary from country to country. Nonetheless, a few important themes 


emerge from the work that’s already been done: 





1) Very large bandwidths are likely to be opened up for mobile services. The graph below 
summarizes the aggregate size of each regional group’s proposed bands, juxtaposed 
with Straight Path’s combined 39GHz and LMDS holdings (measured as a nationwide 
average). With ~30 GHz on the agenda everywhere, all of Straight Path’s MHz-pops no 
longer look especially impressive.

2) Straight Path’s bands are not supported by a global consensus. Global harmonization is 
important in part because of cost: both device makers like Apple and equipment vendors

like Ericsson enjoy economies of scale when they can use the same components across 
the world, and carriers and consumers enjoy the benefits. Some of the proposed 
mmWave bands do enjoy global backing already, including (with some small variations 
from region to region) 31.8-33.4 GHz, ~45-50 GHz, and ~66-76 GHz. By contrast, 
Straight Path’s most important band – 39GHz, which represents 85% of its MHz-pops – 
is fully included in just one proposal (CITEL’s), only partially included in two (APT’s and 
RCC’s), and entirely absent from CEPT’s. Similarly, one piece of the LMDS band, which 
is split into three non-contiguous pieces, is not in any region’s proposal, while the other 
two are largely absent outside of CITEL. To be sure, Straight Path’s bands could still be 
designated as global mmWave mobility bands in the future – just as bands missing from 
the FCC’s initial NPRM could easily come into play in follow-up rulemakings – but the 
fact that many regulatory groups across the world simply don’t view Straight Path’s 
bands as compelling priorities gives the lie to the notion that they are somehow essential 
for 5G. On the contrary, they are at best just one minor piece of the puzzle. 





While the exact details of the bands repurposed for mmWave mobility will remain undefined for 


years to come, it’s already clear that regulators are explicitly trying to make this spectrum 


abundant, not scarce, and their initial proposals reflect that intention. With so much competing 


spectrum supply, Straight Path will have no bargaining power. Why bother negotiating with a 


rent-seeking incumbent in the 39GHz band when so many other similar bands will be available? 


Indeed, even in that band, Straight Path won’t have a monopoly, since the FCC will likely seek 


to re-auction the many expired and unused licenses in markets across the country. And with a 


potential lack of global support, the 39GHz band will be even less attractive. 





Furthermore, the raw number of gigahertz in the mmWave bands actually understates the true 


abundance of spectrum. Current research suggests that, even with complicated techniques like 


beamforming and adaptive antenna arrays, the practical range of mmWave signals will be on 


the order of 100 meters. While short ranges and narrow beams present major challenges, they 


also have a key benefit: the ability to reuse the same spectrum over and over again within a 


small physical area. In principle, two mmWave base stations operated by two different carriers 


could be fairly close together and run on the same exact channel without even “noticing” each 


other.  





This state of affairs differs greatly from the lower-band status quo, in which nearby base stations 


on the same channel would greatly interfere with each other, making exclusive control over 


individual spectrum blocks in particular locations the most natural solution. AT&T and Verizon’s 


networks would not work very well if the cell towers of each were trying to use, say, the 700MHz 


C Block simultaneously in the same town, especially because they radiate energy in every 


direction. By contrast, mmWave systems will need to direct energy in a more focused way within 


a small space, so there’s no good reason why AT&T and Verizon couldn’t use the same exact 


frequencies within a region as large as, say, a city, as long as the base stations weren’t on top 


of each other. Such considerations are precisely why regulators are seriously considering 


making large swaths of mmWave spectrum either unlicensed, lightly licensed, or shared. The 


physical characteristics of mmWave systems greatly reduce the value of legally guaranteed, 


wide-area exclusivity and make less conventional models more practical. In the words of

Gerhard Fettweis, a German academic in the field of wireless communications who holds a 


Vodafone-sponsored professorship and heads 5G Lab Germany:  





Obviously, if we go to these frequencies we can also change the licensing game 


completely. … We can…go and have Vodafone and Telefónica using exactly the same 


frequency band. All they need is a certain spacing apart, little more than 10 


meters…Then there’s no reason why we cannot just have the same frequency band. So 


forget about frequency auctioning of “your spectrum only.” You can then have really 


shared access. We only need somebody to manage to make sure that the base stations 


are far enough apart in space. 





Multiple gigahertz-wide bands, each of which can likely host multiple operators within a given 


market (assuming some degree of coordination), are about as far away from spectrum scarcity 


as one can get, making exclusive control over any individual slice of spectrum – like Straight 


Path’s – relatively unimportant. While carriers have traditionally shied away from unlicensed 


spectrum, the drumbeat of support for LTE-U and related technologies like LAA – which tie 


together licensed, low-frequency spectrum and the 5GHz unlicensed band to enhance downlink 


throughput – demonstrates that carriers are open to different approaches. One compelling 


option for mmWave 5G would be to tie together reliable baseline coverage in a low band with 


vast capacity in the unlicensed 60GHz band – currently 7 GHz wide and likely to expand to 14 


GHz under the FCC’s future rule. With so much bandwidth operating over such short distances, 


carriers could achieve extremely high throughput while suffering few ill effects from the 


unplanned interference than can be more problematic in unlicensed bands with better 


propagation. Straight Path insists that carriers will want the certainty of exclusive, licensed 


spectrum even in the exotic territory of mmWave, but this low-band logic just doesn’t apply with 


the same force. Even if it did, carriers will likely have a very rich menu of licensed mmWave 


spectrum to choose from. If scarcity fosters high valuations at low frequencies, then radical 


abundance will generate unprecedented cheapness at high frequencies. 





Finally, while the FCC’s 5G preparations have focused on mmWave spectrum between 24 and 


roughly 71 GHz, some researchers also believe that even higher frequencies can work for 


mobile applications – potentially better than lower-frequency mmWave. For instance, the 


aforementioned Professor Fettweis has argued that we can harvest hundreds of gigahertz 


above 100 GHz, where propagation is not much worse than it is in the “lower mmWave” but 


antenna elements can be significantly smaller, enabling easier and more cost-effective 


miniaturization. Such research is far from commercialization, but it highlights an unfavorable 


dynamic for Straight Path: by the time mmWave technology is good enough to be economically 


viable, it’s reasonable to expect that it will soon work at 120GHz as well as it works at 39GHz, 


further obliterating any suggestion of spectrum scarcity.

V. Large-Scale mmWave Networks May Never Be 


Commercially Viable 





After reflecting on the week that I just spent at the Small Cell Forum, it’s clear that the view on 


outdoor small cells really hasn’t changed much.  Everyone now has a bit of pilot and trial 


experience under their belt, and we’re all still saying mass deployment is 12 months away, just 


as we have been saying for the past 3 years. However, during this time period no real outdoor 


volume deployments have occurred, and those few plans that had been announced have largely 


stalled and been delayed. 


—Greg Friesen, DragonWave VP of product management, June 2015 





[W]hatever licensing regimes we adopt should take into account the fact that signals from 


carriers’ outdoor base stations will rarely be able to penetrate into the interiors of buildings, 


where around 75 percent of cellular data usage occurs today. 


—FCC Notice of Inquiry, October 2014 





Up through 4G, each generation of mobile technology has been able to balance subscriber 


growth against the shrinking of inter-site distances and, at the same time, provide increasing 


data rates to users both individually and in the aggregate. … However, it is not clear that 


deployments in higher frequency bands, especially those above 24 GHz, can provide the same 


advantages of capturing ever increasing numbers of users… 


—Ericsson, January 2015 





Even if mmWave 5G one day becomes widespread, Straight Path’s spectrum will still have little 


value given the massive amount of competing spectrum and the relative ease of sharing the 


same channel among multiple operators. But it’s also important to realize that, notwithstanding 


the current level of R&D aimed at rendering mmWave bands practically usable for mobile 


services, it’s likely that, even if mmWave mobility is feasible, it still won’t be economical and thus 


will never be widely deployed, making Straight Path’s potential value negligible. 





mmWave optimists have focused on overcoming the challenges of propagation, where the 


problem is that mmWave signals transmitted between a pair of standard antennas can only 


travel over very short distances. The usual workaround in backhaul applications, where each 


endpoint is fixed, is to use highly directional antennas manually aimed straight at each other. 


But this obviously doesn’t work when at least one of the endpoints is small and mobile, like a 


smartphone. However, by using a sophisticated mixture of hardware and software, researchers 


have shown with early-stage demos, prototypes, and simulations that multi-antenna arrays can 


provide a similar degree of directivity. The devices used in these tests are very much not ready 


for prime time – in one, for instance, the smartphone proxy is a large, bulky trolley – but they 


serve as a proof of concept, showing that there’s at least a chance that this approach could 


work in mass-market products.

But would it actually make economic sense? Even with complex engineering, mmWave cells are 


expected to have radii on the order of just 100 meters – dramatically smaller than for 


conventional cellular systems. Worse still, because usable mmWave signals require narrow 


beams and tend to reflect rather than diffract, any obstructions would be far more damaging 


than they would be for lower-frequency signals, calling for high levels of redundancy to mitigate 


against outages. As a result, mmWave systems demand enormously high cell densities. Base 


stations need to be packed very close together, and each one needs power, backhaul, 


computational resources, and permission to use a given physical location, all at the mercy of 


local stakeholders including, in particular, a patchwork of municipal governments and utility 


companies. 





In other words, mmWave takes the laundry list of problems that have prevented normal small 


cells from ever living up to expectations and tacks on many more. Wireless industry observers 


have long predicted that cellular networks, which are today heavily reliant on traditional large 


(“macro”) towers, will evolve toward a small-cell architecture, with compact radio equipment 


located on sites like lamp posts and utility poles, greatly enhancing capacity while using normal 


low-band frequencies. In 2012, AT&T even announced that it would deploy 40,000 small cells 


by the end of 2014. In reality, though, AT&T quietly gave up on that plan after deploying, 


according to industry experts, only a few thousand. Finding and getting rights to 40,000 usable 


locations at a low enough cost in a short enough time to justify the investment – especially 


relative to more conventional macro capex – proved to be impossible. 





To be sure, the small-cell approach hasn’t been abandoned, but few regard earlier projections 


of millions of cells across the country as realistic for the foreseeable future, and even Sprint’s 


more recent plan to roll out tens of thousands of sites has been dubbed “very aggressive, even 


in a three-year period.”12 But while dense small-cell deployments complement macro sites to 


add capacity in conventional frequencies, they’re non-negotiable necessities in mmWave, where 


macro-style wide-area propagation is impossible. If carriers can’t make the math work to deploy 


large numbers of small cells using familiar bands with relatively good propagation, how can they 


possibly justify even larger numbers using exotic frequencies and complex, likely costly 


equipment (which doesn’t even exist in commercial form today)? For mmWave to work, a small-


cell architecture must already be in place – but once such an architecture is in place in lower 


bands, it will significantly improve network performance on its own, further calling into question 


any incremental ROI on adding mmWave on top. 





But the cost associated with high cell densities is just one of the practical problems with 


mmWave. One of the best summaries comes from Ericsson, the world’s largest telecom 


equipment vendor and hence a firm with about as much mobile-network expertise as anyone in 


the world. Ericsson’s detailed comments on the FCC’s mmWave Notice of Inquiry read like a 


horror story for mobile-operator CFOs:

[I]n the nearer term, the Commission should focus on spectrum above 10 GHz (rather 


than above 24 GHz) as today’s evolving technology can more easily transition to these 


frequencies. The radio environment at higher frequencies is simply very different, and it 


gets more “different” as the frequency increases. … 





A much denser site grid may be needed, limiting the economic benefits of deployment 


within areas that are capable of generating traffic. …  





Propagation limitations will greatly limit non-line-of-sight (“NLOS”) coverage, especially 


between indoor and outdoor locations and in rural and suburban areas…LOS coverage 


will be possible, but obstructions and vegetation will pose difficulties in reception. … 





High directivity for mobile antenna systems will have to be achieved by arrays of many 


elements. This is by no means a trivial task, and current research and development 


efforts are just beginning. … 





[T]he random orientation of handheld user equipment, limits on EIRP [i.e. power levels] 


in proximity to the human body, and blockage of the signal by parts of the human body 


require compensation at the base station’s receive antenna. … 





In outdoor environments, the system is unlikely to provide ubiquitous coverage—for 


example, it will be difficult to account for losses through vehicles…Even communications 


through a window may require higher power than an outdoor-to-outdoor link because of 


high attenuation through windows as well as wells. In addition, commercial buildings 


often have windows that are metallized, which will further attenuate signals. … 





Handsets, to some degree, can overcome obstacles in their path by finding other signal 


paths to close the link; however, outage probabilities for high data rates will likely be 


significant, because buildings, foliage and atmospheric conditions can affect propagation 


characteristics with significant attenuation in comparison to bands below 3 GHz. … 





There are fundamental physical differences that require completely different approaches 


rather than tweaks, such as the path loss, which is proportional to the square of the 


frequency. As a result, when the frequency is increased by a factor of ten or more, the 


design of the circuity and antennas is not simply scaled up or down a bit, as may be the 


case when there is a more moderate increase in frequency; the design needs to be 


fundamentally reexamined. … 





NLOS outdoor to indoor coverage cannot be obtained in a satisfactory manner at 


frequency bands above 24 GHz. … 





Obstructions can cause problems with coverage, for example down side streets, behind 


large trees, inside a car, or behind a large truck or bus. Nomadic obstructions such a

parked truck will cause sporadic dropouts…[A] single building, some trees or a truck or 


bus obstructing the path might break the connection. … 





Coverage over and beyond a hill will likely not be possible. … 





In sum, in addition to requiring a dense small-cell architecture that has not proven to be 


economically compelling using conventional cellular bands, mmWave networks will face severe 


difficulties achieving things that users today largely take for granted, like providing service 


irrespective of how they hold their phones, whether they’re standing behind a hill, or whether 


there’s a truck or bush nearby. Perhaps most fatally, while existing cellular systems almost 


entirely provide coverage to indoor users via outdoor cell towers, mmWave signals generally 


won’t be able to penetrate walls or even common types of glass, narrowly circumscribing their 


usefulness or requiring costly building-by-building indoor deployments, a model that cannot 


scale to large areas. Beyond a small handful of high-density outdoor events like the recent 


papal visit in Philadelphia – which was well-served by conventional cellular and Wi-Fi systems – 


the vast majority of cellular data consumption occurs indoors. The entire rationale for traveling 


down the long, difficult path of fundamentally reexamining all aspects of radio engineering to 


enable mmWave mobile networks is to provide very high data rates – but those data rates will 


fizzle out and often drop to zero in precisely the places they’re needed.  





It’s easy to dismiss these profound limitations by just asserting that R&D will address them 


somehow down the road. But while the basic outlines of how to compensate for weak mmWave 


propagation in free space are already known – use a lot of coordinated antenna elements – the 


failure of mmWave signals to penetrate most building materials is simply a physical fact, as is 


the likelihood that a user’s head or fingers will disrupt narrow mmWave beams. There are no 


practical, ready-to-hand solutions to these problems, and they are so fundamental that it’s 


difficult to imagine any. At the recent Texas Wireless Summit in mid-October, leading mmWave 


expert Robert W. Heath, Jr., a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University 


of Texas at Austin, spoke frankly about these issues (starting at ~10:25): 





[T]hat main signal path…can be blocked by buildings. You know, you’re in Manhattan? 


There’s a lot of buildings around! … Boy, people can block the signal too, depending on 


which frequency you’re operating at. We tend to either scatter or absorb a ton of 


mmWave frequency. It actually even depends on clothing – I mean, wearing a wool 


sweater is hugely different than a synthetic shirt. But anyways, basically people block the 


signal. So if you have, like, a low transmitter/receiver, people walking around: your 


signal’s going to be blocked, like, all the time. 





By the way, we block the signal ourselves. I could be communicating with this base 


station right here, I turn my back to talk to someone over here – I just blocked my best 


propagation path. My SNR [signal-to-noise ratio] goes down 25 dB [decibels]. I get 


nothing now. So. We block our own signal. And then it goes to the extreme that in fact 


we can even block the antenna elements on our hand. Everyone remembers this Apple 


“antenna-gate,” but this is a big issue at mmWave because, even though you have an

array of antennas, that array is not very big. You could very easily just happen to cover it 


with your thumb. … 





So what can you do here? The Samsung approach…is to actually have two arrays, and 


that’s a great idea. … Of course, if you turn that [device] landscape to watch a YouTube 


video, you just blocked both antennas. [Audience laughter.] So what are the other 


solutions here? The one I was thinking about recently is this…You could have a little, 


like, shock, or a buzzer or something, that tells the user, “Get your finger off the 


antenna!” [Audience laughter.] I mean, I don’t know! But, in all seriousness, this is going 


to affect a lot of how we use the technology, because no more can we kind of use it 


everywhere – now we have to be mindful of where our fingers are, where the base 


station is. I mean, something silly like this – this could kill it. If the typical user…can’t 


figure out how to get the iPad working, man, it’s going to be dead. 





What rational actor would have the appetite to spend enormous sums of money building out a 


large-scale mmWave network using completely new, untested technology to provide at best 


inconsistent and unreliable – and at worse nonexistent – service indoors, in suburbs, near trees, 


or in cities with too many or too few buildings? With such a daunting, operationally difficult, and 


expensive project, how much room would there be in the budget to pay for spectrum? To 


achieve any economic return, the underlying spectrum has to be trivial in cost, undercutting the 


purported value of Straight Path’s licenses. 





The bull case for Straight Path is built entirely on the success of mmWave 5G. But 5G is likely 


decades away from peak deployment and has no inherent need for mmWave, which in turn 


faces so many staggering economic and technological limitations that it may never come to 


fruition at all, like so many other hyped-up concepts in telecom. Even if mmWave 5G does 


succeed, there will be so much available spectrum that incumbents like Straight Path will have 


no bargaining power and little to offer.  





VI. Valuation Precedents and Benchmarks Demonstrate that 


Straight Path Is Worth Very Little 





The typical bull case for Straight Path takes the company’s 256 billion MHz-pops – the sum of 


bandwidth times population for each market for which it holds a license – and applies some 


price per MHz-pop derived from cellular bands, less an arbitrary discount. The dream is that, 


although such high-frequency spectrum has typically traded for prices per MHz-pop that are 


several orders of magnitude lower than what carriers have paid for lower-band spectrum, that’s 


just because mmWave bands weren’t yet authorized for mobile use and didn’t have the right 


technology. Now that regulators are moving toward favorable rules and researchers are 


developing new kinds of equipment, Straight Path bulls contend, mmWave spectrum prices will 


begin to converge with those of conventional bands.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 25 





By seeking to map the value of normal cellular bands onto Straight Path, bulls are applying a 


radically incorrect model, ignoring basic first principles. But before explaining why, it’s worth 


reviewing just how inexpensive mmWave spectrum is. In 2008, for example, the United 


Kingdom auctioned off three GHz of spectrum in the 40.5-43.5GHz band – similar to Straight 


Path’s 39GHz band, but with roughly twice the bandwidth. A firm called UK Broadband 


purchased rights to 2 GHz in this band for just £120,000. Not £120 million -- £120 thousand. Nor 


was this price an incredible bargain; by 2009, the firm, which had sought to use the spectrum for 


wireless broadband, had already given up on much of its plans. 





Similarly, in 2012, as noted in the Company Overview section above, Level 3 Communications, 


the large telecom infrastructure firm, sold its portfolio of mmWave spectrum, inherited via an 


acquisition, to Spectrum Holdings Technologies, an entity controlled by the former head of IDT 


Spectrum, the unit that later became the core of Straight Path. These licenses account for 


almost a third of Straight Path’s total holdings today. The price, revealed in legal documents 


filed as part of litigation between IDT and the former executive,13 was just $203,000 for licenses 


covering, according to our license-by-license calculations, 32 billion MHz-pops in the 39GHz 


band and 14 billion in the LMDS band, for a total of 46 billion MHz-pops. The arithmetic is as 


simple as it is striking – $203,000 divided by 46 billion MHz-pops implies a price per MHz-pop of 


$0.000004. Obviously, applying such a low benchmark to Straight Path indicates that its 


portfolio is worth very little. To be precise, 256 billion MHz-pops x $0.000004 yields an 


aggregate value of just over $1 million. Even if this calculation were off by a factor of 10, 


Straight Path’s stock would still have 98% downside.  





Bulls will insist that such a comparison is unfair, even though it involves a relatively recent and 


relatively large transaction between knowledgeable parties. After all, that price likely only 


contemplated the niche use cases of fixed wireless broadband and wireless backhaul, not the 


much larger market for mobile broadband that regulators might ultimately open up for Straight 


Path. Spectrum for mobile broadband changes hands for prices measured in dollars per MHz-


pop, not tiny fractions of a cent. Why shouldn’t the same ultimately apply to Straight Path’s 


spectrum? 





The answer is that a band’s frequency has a large impact on its cost of deployment, with the 


number of required infrastructure nodes rising exponentially with frequency. As a result, 


operators historically pay less for high-frequency spectrum than for low-frequency spectrum, 


because it’s cheaper, less difficult, and less time-consuming to build out low-frequency 


networks. A recent real-world example of this effect comes from Canada. In March 2015, the 


Canadian operator Telus purchased spectrum in the AWS-3 band – centered roughly at 2 GHz 


– for ~$2/MHz-pop at auction. Very shortly thereafter, in May, the same company purchased 


spectrum in the 2.5GHz band – centered roughly at 2.6GHz – for just $0.36 per MHz-pop at 


auction. The frequency was only 30% higher, yet the price was more than 80% lower. What

would the price have been for mobile spectrum whose frequency was not 30% but 20 times 


higher? Almost zero. 





Even if we charitably assume that antenna arrays and beamforming can overcome the 


enormous challenges of mmWave propagation, it’s clear that mmWave networks will need huge 


numbers of nodes even to cover small areas with the multi-Gbps throughputs expected of 5G. 


One of the most useful analyses in this regard comes from Nokia’s comments on the FCC’s 


NOI, which include, in Table 2, estimates (derived from a simulation) of the relationship between 


radio node density per unit area, average user throughput, cell-edge throughput, and outage 


probability, factoring in the presence or absence of foliage, which has a large impact of system 


performance. With foliage, achieving a high cell-edge throughput and a low probability of service 


interruption – consistent with the widely discussed 5G design principle of creating a more 


consistent and uniform user experience – would require approximately 187 radio nodes per 


square kilometer. By contrast, based on CTIA data, the US has 298,055 cell sites covering an 


area of 9.8 million square kilometers, for a density of just 0.03 nodes per square kilometer. In 


other words, mmWave could require a network more than 6,000x denser (187 / 0.03 = 6,233) 


than existing cellular networks. If we assume a benchmark valuation of $1/MHz-pop for non-


standard cellular spectrum at ~2GHz – in line with what Verizon has reportedly been willing to 


pay – then we estimate that a best-case valuation of Straight Path’s portfolio, at a much higher 


frequency and requiring a much more dense network, not to mention a fundamental rethinking 


of many aspects of mobile technology, would be only a few tens of millions of dollars in the 


future – more than 90% lower than where it trades today. 





Illustrative Valuation of Straight Path’s 
Spectrum Based on Cellular Benchmarks 





Source: company filings, Kerrisdale analysis 





Of course, this valuation only factors in the decreased utility of any similarly high-frequency 


band relative to conventional cellular bands. It makes no adjustment for the availability of large 


swaths of competing spectrum, much of it unlicensed, or the incremental cost of using exotic 


hardware and software to cope with the challenges of mmWave. Nor does it adjust for the 


impracticality of covering indoor locations via outdoor cell sites – the standard model for almost 


all existing network deployments – which would imply a dramatically higher node density than 


that assumed above, given that the 187 nodes/sq. km. figure was based on a simulated outdoor 


network. Thus we regard this valuation as highly generous on multiple fronts – even if we ignore 


the high probability that Straight Path’s spectrum will simply never be used for mobile service at

We also neglect an important Straight Path–specific issue: its lack of large blocks of contiguous 


spectrum. Many industry participants have highlighted the importance of contiguous spectrum in 


mmWave bands, since, again, the only rationale for engaging in the necessary R&D is to obtain 


large bandwidths of many hundreds of megahertz; some even call for gigahertz-wide channels, 


as already exist in the 60GHz band. While Straight Path’s holdings in its favored 39GHz band 


do add up to hundreds of megahertz in total, the band plan consists of paired 50MHz units 


separated by 700 MHz from each other. While the details vary from market to market, Straight 


Path generally does not have rights to large, contiguous blocks. Instead, it has scattered bits 


and pieces, often separated by channels formerly owned by companies that are now defunct.  





The table below provides a summary of the top 30 markets, ranked by population.  While 


Samsung has called for at least 500 MHz of contiguous mmWave bandwidth to achieve 


targeted 5G performance, and the regional telecom regulatory body in the Americas, CITEL, 


has noted that “[c]ontiguous wide system bandwidth (approximately 500 MHz to 1 GHz or more) 


will be considered as a critical factor for efficient delivery of ultra-high end user bit rates,” 


Straight Path has, on average, less than 200 MHz of contiguous bandwidth in the largest 


markets.

Straight Path 39GHz Portfolio: Maximum Contiguous Bandwidth 
by Market 





Source: FCC Universal Licensing System, Kerrisdale analysis 





Although few equity-market participants have noticed that Straight Path’s lack of large, 


contiguous bandwidth could render it useless for 5G mobile service, Straight Path has certainly 


noticed. As a result, it’s hoping to convince the FCC to let it engage in a reshuffling of the 


licenses in each market in order to make its holdings more contiguous. It’s far too early to know 


whether the FCC will prove amenable to this request for special treatment – effectively a

subsidy for a legacy license holder whose aspirational business model is to hoard unused 


spectrum in hopes of cornering the market. But the risk is asymmetrically negative for Straight 


Path. If it does get permission to reshuffle its licenses and assemble as much contiguous 


bandwidth as it can, it still faces all the other problems we’ve examined, from the enormous 


supply of other mmWave spectrum to the great practical difficulties of building an effective 


mmWave network to the simple fact that operators are nowhere near considering major 5G 


build-outs, let alone anything as exotic as mmWave 5G. But if Straight Path does not get special 


favors from the FCC, then its hopes of being the poster child for mmWave 5G are simply 


doomed from the start; its contiguous bandwidth is wholly inadequate. Straight Path will 


certainly be very busy lobbying for years to come.  





VII. Conclusion 





The notion that a company as silly as Straight Path – a 7-person patent troll cum spectrum play, 


with the former role having already run its course and the latter premised on an exotic frequency 


band that has driven almost everyone who ever touched it into bankruptcy or failure – is worth 


almost $600 million defies common sense. Investors have been swept up in 5G hype that is, in 


reality, a mixture of marketing fluff and regulatory lobbying, much of which has nothing to do 


with mmWave bands at all. In all the excitement, they have overlooked the utter lack of 


mmWave spectrum scarcity, the enormous barriers to cost-effective mmWave networks (going 


beyond merely weak propagation and extending to issues as fundamental as being able to 


access indoor locations from outdoor cell sites), and the entire concept that network operators 


are not going to completely overhaul the status quo at enormous cost unless that strategy 


presents a compelling return on investment. Looking at prices per MHz-pop as if all frequencies 


behaved the same way violates economic logic. To repeat Ericsson’s basic point, “The radio 


environment at higher frequencies is simply very different,” and with orders-of-magnitude 


differences in basic network parameters, like cell density, there will naturally be orders-of-


magnitude differences in spectrum prices. 





At an even more fundamental level, supply and demand govern the price of spectrum as surely 


as they govern the price of any commodity. With low demand, given the great difficulties of 


practical mmWave deployments, and extremely high supply, given all the spectrum that will be 


available in the next several years and beyond, mmWave spectrum will never fetch a high price. 


Straight Path’s valuation is irrational and unsustainable.
