Provectus: Strong Sell, Ties To Paid Stock Promoters, SEC Halt Risk,
Price Target $0
May 21, 2014 10:40 AM ET220 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


PVCT has just FOUR full-time employees, HQ appears to be a metal barn in rural
Knoxville, claim to have effective treatment for cancer with commodity red dye "Rose
Bengal."


PVCT is connected to questionable paid stock promoters whose other
recommendations have recently been halted by the SEC: including FSPM, PHOT,
and PTOG.


Insiders were paid ~$49m during a 12+ year period while PVCT shareholders
accumulated losses ~$150m with zero revenue and shares outstanding have
increased 20x.


PV-10 has no Phase 3 trial in sight while patents begin expiring in 2016 and appears
to have failed their FDA Breakthrough Designation Request.


PVCT appears extraordinarily overvalued with ~$750 MILLION fully diluted
valuation. I believe fair value is closer to $0 and outline why in this report.


Summary


I believe shares of Provectus Pharmaceuticals (OTC:PVCT) are worthless. This report
outlines connections between PVCT and some of Wall Street's shadiest participants. The
report further outlines a consistent pattern of substantial shareholder losses at numerous
companies the current management team and board (including Craig Eagle) have been
involved with, several of which have indisputable ties to paid stock promoters. The stocks
of many of these companies experienced losses in excess of 90%, several of which were
complete wipeouts. It also appears PVCT's BreakThrough Designation request has failed
as well.


Perhaps more concerning is the company itself. PVCT has a mere four full-time
employees, yet boasts a market cap of $750m on a fully-diluted basis. This eye-popping
number is despite a lifetime history of zero material revenue, total management
compensation of nearly $50 million (almost entirely for these four employees), and

cumulative net losses of ~$150m. The company's R&D line in its 10-K seems to me to be
a "black-hole" of aggressive fully-vested warrant grants to undisclosed consultants. PVCT
appears to be run out of a metal barn on the outskirts of Knoxville. I believe the company's
one drug, PV-10, has no hope of becoming a commercial success as there is no phase 3
trial in process and patents begin to expire in 2016.


PVCT management claim to have found effective treatment to multiple cancers in what
they claim is a purified version of a commodity textile and food dye called "Rose Bengal"
(aka: Food Red No. 105) that can be bought for $30 at any medical supply store. Recently
PVCT stock has gone parabolic on a promotion campaign involving questionable stock
promoters while the doctor involved with research into PV-10 was sued by the SEC for
insider trading and was recently involved in a failed cancer trial that resulted in drug
abandonment. I believe shares of PVCT have no intrinsic value and predict the stock price
will collapse once PVCT shareholders understand the disturbing truth about where they
have been persuaded by promoters to put their hard-earned money.


My research has discovered numerous issues with PVCT including:


1. PVCT is connected to questionable stock pumpers promoting PVCT including Small-
Cap Street LLC. Multiple stocks covered by Small Cap Street LLC have recently been
halted by the SEC and I believe PVCT could be next to be halted given its weak
disclosures and zero revenue.


2. PVCT's PV-10 researcher Dr. Sanjiv Agarwala has a history of failure and has been
sued by the SEC for insider trading. Dr. Sanjiv also recently presided over the famous
VICL trial failure, resulting in VICL stock price implosion and drug abandonment.


3. PVCT board and management are associated with multiple, very questionable paid
stock promotions and companies that wiped out shareholders.


4. The founders of PVCT's last company, Imcor Pharmaceutical Company which had the
PH-10 drug, stock was also a complete shareholder wipeout.


5. PVCT management received stated compensation of $49m since inception while
paying over ten million dollars to unnamed "consultants" - all while the company has
lost ~$150m and never generated material revenue over the past 12 years.


1. PVCT management compensation is so egregious they were recently sued in a
shareholder derivative lawsuit and had to settle, apparently resulting in paying back
some of their inflated compensation.


6. PVCT has stayed solvent by repeatedly diluting shareholders with equity raises using
"Network 1 Financial." Network 1 financial seem to face fraud allegations according to

history" through employee background at F.N. Wolf


1. Why does PVCT choose a financing partner like this?


7. PVCT's claims of PV-10 are incredulous and the lack of a credible large pharma
partner taking a stake in the company or Phase 3 trials strongly indicate the drug is
unviable.


1. If PV-10 was so groundbreaking, why is PVCT the subject of a paid promotion
campaign with questionable stock promotion outfits?


8. Recent PVCT website changes strongly indicate to me the BTD application was not
approved.


9. I predict PVCT management will repeat its performance at Imcor, and leave
shareholders with $0.


SEC Warns Investors about Stock Promotions, Halts Stocks


On Friday, May 16th, the SEC issued a warning letter to investors. In this warning letter,
the SEC highlighted 5 stocks it has recently halted. These stocks are:


1. FusionPharm Inc. (OTC:FSPM) - promoted by Paul Lipp's OTCbbjournal.com -
HALTED BY SEC


2. Cannabusiness Group Inc (OTC:CBGI)
3. Growlife, Inc. (OTC:PHOT) - promoted by Mark Bonacci Paul Lipp's "SmallCapIR" -


HALTED BY SEC
4. Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc (OTC:CANN)
5. Petrotech Oil and Gas, Inc. (OTC:PTOG) - promoted by Paul Lipp's


"StocksImpossible" - HALTED BY SEC


While the press release specifically focuses on marijuana-related investments, there is
another story behind three of these stocks: FSPM, PTOG and PHOT were all stocks that
benefited from positive research reports from Small Cap Street LLC, a firm that gets paid
to release positive research reports about public companies. Small Cap Street LLC is
owned and operated by Paul Lipp.


Small Cap Street has also recently published on PVCT, which was written by the same
author who wrote the PTOG report, Osman Ghani - Osman is a paid writer for Small Cap
Street LLC. I believe it is highly possible shares of PVCT will also be halted by the SEC.

PVCT Tied to Questionable Stock Promoters and Paid Touts:


PVCT is a reverse merger stock which uplisted this week to the NYSE with an incredible
~$750m market cap after running up over 300% from 80 cents/share under 6 months ago.
How did PVCT, a company with $0 revenue and little cash, accomplish this? I believe
much of the current demand for PVCT stock is connected to questionable stock promoters
potentially aimed at unsophisticated retail investors. When that promotion runs out of
steam, I believe PVCT stock price will likely implode as PVCT already has achieved one
of the highest market capitalizations I have ever seen for a company of this nature.


In January "Small-Cap Street" issued a report claiming PVCT is worth $62 per share
written by "Osman Ghani" whose resume lists no biotech or pharma experience. Osman
Ghani has recently authored numerous reports on a variety of stocks as a paid article
writer, including NVLX, another penny stock paid promotion. Osman Ghani also recently
wrote about PTOG, recently halted by the SEC. In fact, two other stocks covered by Paul
Lipp's firms were also halted by the SEC recently (more below).


Small-Cap Street's disclaimer reads:


"We are engaged in the business of marketing and advertising companies for monetary
compensation."


Who is Small-Cap Street? Small-Cap street (based on this internet registry information,
Michigan articles of incorporation, and these property records) appears to be closely
associated with a host of questionable small cap stock promotion focused websites and
businesses including Small Cap Specialists, LLC, Elite Traders Group LLC,
firstpennypicks.com, stocksimpossible.com, and OTCbbjournal.com. From what I can tell
these entities are owned by a "Paul Shawn-Ray Lipp" and run out of a small house near
Flint, Michigan next door to a pet grooming business.

The Headquarters of Paul Lipp's "Small-Cap Street LLC"


I researched Paul in great depth and found a lot of red flags. Given his ties to paid stock
promotion websites I do not recommend you take financial advice from him.


Furthermore, Paul S. Lipp's "Small Cap Specialist" and "Small Cap IR" disclosures state
(emphasis mine):


The Group (and our Media Publications/Products) is periodically compensated for
describing certain securities of the issuers highlighted on SCS Websites. Such
compensation may consist of Cash, Restricted Securities, Convertible Liabilities,
Options Contracts, Warrants, Subscriptions, Exception Specific Securities,
Corporate Bonds, and other financial instruments in the companies highlighted and
may vary by company. In addition, in some instances the Group and SCS Websites's
affiliates, officers, directors and employees may also have bought or may buy, or
have sold or may sell the securities discussed in SCS Websites and may profit in the
event of a rise in value of those securities. The Group and SCS Websites may not
announce when or if it decides to buy or sell any such securities.


FirstPennyPicks.com also has a similar disclosure.


I think it is clear Paul S. Lipp and these various companies are in the business of offering
paid stock promotion. What kind of companies does Paul Lipp's firms typically cover? Just
to use "OTCbbjournal.com" as an example, EKNL listed on the otcbbjournal.com
homepage with RFMK and OOIL shown as their picks here.


EKNL: $0 revenue, basically $0 cash and $2.85m market cap with huge stock decline

OOIL: stock -96% since 2011, $12.4m market cap, no material revenue, $1.3m cash on
the balance sheet,


Unfortunately, the questionable people above are not the first or only time PVCT appears
to have been connected to paid stock promoters. PVCT also seems to have been
previously promoted by the extremely questionable Patrick Cox.

Patrick Cox: Has Promoted PVCT In the Past


PVCT also had to pay for this interview. I strongly recommend you never ever invest in a
company that has to pay for this kind of stock promotion.


I also find the disclosure on compensation regarding Small Cap Street to be confusing as
well. This Small Cap Street PR about PVCT shows no disclosure of compensation as of
1/22/2014. However, this PVCT announcement shortly after on 2/27/2014 shows Small
Cap Street was paid $10k by the mysterious "Hunter Marketing." Was Small Cap Street
not paid for the first report or was the disclosure simply left off? What exactly is going on
here?

Multiple Small-Cap Street LLC Stocks Have Recently Been Halted by the SEC: Is
PVCT next?


Just this last Friday 5/16/2014 the SEC issued a warning to investors. In this warning the
SEC highlighted they have halted 5 stocks recently.


1. FusionPharm Inc. - promoted by Paul Lipp's OTCbbjournal.com - HALTED BY SEC
2. Cannabusiness Group Inc
3. Growlife, Inc. - promoted by Mark Bonacci Paul Lipp's "SmallCapIR" - HALTED BY


SEC
4. Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc
5. Petrotech Oil and Gas, Inc. - promoted by Paul Lipp's "StocksImpossible" - HALTED


BY SEC


Of these 5 that the SEC stepped in and stopped, 3 of them were recently covered by Paul
Lipp's Small Cap Street stock promotion firm.


Given the recent SEC actions against three public companies Small Cap Street LLC has
recently written about, I think it is possible that the SEC is looking at the various people
involved and the other companies they are involved with. PVCT stock is clearly on this list
and I would not be surprised if the SEC steps in and shuts PVCT down or halts the stock
soon as well.

PVCT Financed by Network 1 Financial: "CHURNING, FRAUD AND

It appears to me the only way PVCT has been able to afford "Investors Relations" and
their incredible compensation is through repeated financings with Network 1 Financial, a
firm that has done 8 financings for PVCT, per CapIQ. Who is PVCT's partner Network 1
Financial?


Network 1 Financial is a team run in part by Damon Domenic Testaverde, who is a
Managing Director at the firm. While for some reason this doesn't appear on Damon's
Network 1 bio, Damon D. Testaverde seems to have spent 6 years as Sr. VP at "F.N. Wolf
& Co" which is quoted by Forbes as being a "boiler room shut down by regulators in
1994." F.N. Wolf & Co. also appears to have been sued for millions for "one of the biggest
stock scams in North Carolina history." If you are curious about F.N. Wolf and the people
who worked there, this article may be insightful as is this Bloomberg article. Why has
Damon D. Testaverde apparently omitted his experience at F.N. Wolf & Co. from his
current bio when he used to include it in prior versions of his bio?


Network 1 also appears to have a wide array of allegations on their record including:


"A CLIENT OF THE FIRM ALLEGES A FAILURE TO SUPERVISE A REGISTERED
REPRESENTATIVE CONCERNING BREACH OF CONTRACT, CHURNING,
FRAUD AND MISREPRESENTATION…"


Further, according to this FINRA document, Network 1 Financial has had no less than 13
FINRA Regulatory Events against it. A sampling of the events includes: trading for its own
accounts ahead of customer orders, exceeding the limits that a controlling shareholder
could sell in a public transaction, and effecting equity securities transactions in the
accounts of public customers at prices that were unfair in relation to the market value of
such securities. This is bad stuff.


PVCT's Dr. Sanjiv Agarwala History of Drug Trial Failure and SEC Lawsuit


The principal investigator into PVCT's claimed Red Dye miracle is Dr. Sanjiv S. Agarwala.
Unfortunately, Dr. Sanjiv's history appears checkered and I question his credibility. Dr.
Sanjiv seems to have presided over the failed VICL trials, resulting in massive stockholder
losses with shares dropping -60%. Below we can see how VICL stock reacted to the news
of that trial's failure. The Allovection-7 drug was scrapped after the failed trial. Most
interesting however is Vical's failed drug Allovectin-7 seems similar to PV-10 to me and
patients treated with Allovectin-7 did worse than control arm patients in a real Phase 3

trial. Also note VICL's market cap was ~$370m prior to the stock price implosion, while
PVCT's market cap is 2x higher currently at ~$740m. How might PVCT stock react to
adverse news given its much higher valuation?


The VICL Meltdown


Agarwala also appears to have been sued by the SEC and settled insider trading
allegations regarding Sanjiv's work at Maxim Pharmaceuticals. Maxim was acquired by
Epicept which merged with Immune Pharma, and is now a $37m market cap stock
relegated to the OTC markets. Maxim Pharma was also sued and Dr. Sanjiv is quoted in
that lawsuit also.


Cancer is a highly complex group of diseases. Do you believe cancer will be cured by
someone with this track record of litigation by using a purified red dye?


So this PH-10 and PV-10 Red Dye No. 105 "technology" seems to have originated from
PVCT management's prior company: Photogen/Imcor. How did Photogen and IMCR turn
out?


PVCT Founder's Last Company Photogen/Imcor IMCR Stock Went to $0.0000


When entrusting your money to speculative small cap stocks it is vital you understand the
quality of the leaders you are investing with. Before PVCT, the founders led their previous
company Photogen, which apparently became Imcor Pharma, into the ground. IMCR
stock also had the purified "Rose Bengal" called PH-10 and yet it appears to have
declined -100% and was a total shareholder wipeout from what I can tell while also having
legal issues.

PVCT: 4 TOTAL Full Time Employees in a Metal Barn-Looking Structure in Rural
Knoxville?


PVCT's Headquarters looks to me like a metal barn structure outside of Knoxville. For
some reason I don't think Pfizer would want to buy this Metal Barn-Looking Structure or
it's 4 full-time employees for $30B (i.e., $30,000,000,000) as the bull case suggests based
on the stock promotion currently underway. It's worth asking again: How is a company with
a total of 4 employees, according to the 10-K, working out of a metal barn worth nearly
three quarters of a BILLION dollars? Given the history of repeated board and
management-led shareholder wipeouts, why would this time be any different?


Does This Look "Legit" as HQ of a $750m pharma company?


PVCT Insiders Are Getting Extremely Wealthy and Shareholders Get Dilution


Since inception PVCT insiders have stated compensation of $49m. Over the past 12 years
PVCT has produced essentially $0 revenue. Please reread and let that sink in for a
minute.


Furthermore, PVCT insiders were sued in a derivative lawsuit for paying themselves so
much and they appear to have settled and forced to repay a large amount of their stated
compensation over two years according to page 16 of this document.

PVCT CEO Craig Dees: Paid Millions for What?


Where did PVCT get this $49m to pay insiders? And what have PVCT shareholders
received in exchange for this incredible insider compensation? Not much aside from
persistent and impressive dilution as far as I can tell. $152m in cumulative losses (so far),
no revenue, no big pharma development partner, no phase 3 trials, no indication of near-
term revenue, while shares outstanding have increased more than 20x since inception.


2002-2014 PVCT Dilution: Shares Outstanding Increased 2,060%!


In 12/2002 shares outstanding were 9.4m and as of March 2014 they were stated at
173.1m. The shocking thing though is that excludes another 73m shares worth of warrants
and options which brings the total fully diluted share count to ~246m.


Despite all the hype, insiders seem to be unwilling to make open market acquisitions of
PVCT stock with their own cash (if this stock is really worth $62 a share as the promotion
pieces claim where are all the insider buys? We know they have plenty of cash after all
the compensation they have received). In PVCT's 12 years, CapIQ shows only one very
small open market acquisition on record, back in 2006.


PVCT's R&D Budget: A Black Hole of Confusing Cash Burn?

5/22/2018 Provectus: Strong Sell, Ties To Paid Stock Promoters, SEC Halt Risk, Price Target $0 - Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2230483-provectus-strong-sell-ties-to-paid-stock-promoters-sec-halt-risk-price-target-0 13/82


While the $49m of stated total compensation (this includes both stock and cash, and
outlined in chart below) PVCT's insiders have received is shocking to me, more
concerning is that this $49m is only a small fraction of total cash and share cost (PVCT
has net losses of ~$150m since inception). So where in the heck did the OTHER >$100m
go? This company has not completed a phase 3 trial and only really completed a small
phase 2 trial: $100m is a huge amount of cash so where has the money gone?


I tried to parse out, with the public filings, where the money has been spent but was left
utterly confused. From what I can tell PVCT doesn't offer much detail on where and to who
the R&D cash cost and shares have gone.


All that is included in the public filings is that there is an enormous amount of "payroll" and
"consulting" costs which offer virtually no clarity. I could find no meaningful disclosures in
any of the materials about who these consultants are or what they are doing to justify this
level of compensation. How much compensation has the company's Advisory Board
received and for what - are these people part of the "consultant" pool? If this was my
company I would demand more transparency.


Further, does it smell right that the company has spent ~30x as much on Payroll and
Indirect line items as it has on its Melanoma studies, according to PVCT's own filings?
Before 2011, the company didn't even report this data - it took an SEC correspondence
letter to change the company's disclosures. And why hasn't this miracle drug company
that has a wonder drug for Melanoma spent even $1.00 on this Melanoma line item since
2009?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2230483-provectus-strong-sell-ties-to-paid-stock-promoters-sec-halt-risk-price-target-0 14/82


Given the background of the various parties involved here I find the lack of disclosure on
where $40m+ in cash and shares has been spent to be extremely concerning.


I have also been truly amazed at the form of compensation these consultants are earning.
Why would a company grant fully vested warrants to its consultants in large volumes
unless they needed to rapidly sell the stock proceeds?


High Profile Board Members and FraudCaps: Quick Educational Interlude
(Unrelated to PVCT)


For those of you without experience looking at fraudcaps I thought it would be interesting
to include a quick piece of education based on my experience. Completely unrelated to
PVCT, what I have noticed with a lot of fraudcaps is that they can often pay an excessive
amount of cash or stock to someone with a seemingly high profile resume or impressive
association to join the company in some limited way, such as become a member of the
board of directors or company advisory board. The obvious reason is this lends optical
legitimacy to the fraudcap in question and can help make people think the fraudcap is
legitimate. The famous fraudcap "Sino Forest" which went bankrupt after being exposed
as a Fraud by Muddy Waters, for example had five directors on its board from reputable
accounting firm Ernst & Young - clearly a move designed to inspire confidence among the
investing public. End of educational interlude that is not related to PVCT.


What about PVCT advisory board member Craig Eagle? Doesn't he have some
connection to Pfizer?


Craig Eagle is on the board of PVCT and is a strategic adviser. Some people who own
PVCT stock seem to believe Craig Eagle's involvement with PVCT means there is an
imminent partnership with Pfizer due to what appears to be some past work of Craig's at
PFE. Let's be serious investors here for a moment and look at Craig's track record to
discuss the real implications of Craig's involvement with PVCT.


Per CapIQ, Craig Eagle was/is on the board of a few other questionable, small
biotech/pharma stocks.

Given Craig is also on the board of these other companies according to CapIQ, let's look
at how these companies and their shareholders have fared:


Assured Pharmacy Inc. (APHY): stock declined -95.9% over the time frame below.
Currently $1.15m market cap (no typo) and appears to have $0 in cash currently.


APHY seems to have been featured on the website of the famous Dream Team Group.
Unfortunately, this Dream Team Group recently became famous for the Galena Biopharma
paid stock promotion scheme where insiders (potentially illegally) cashed out their stock
and made millions. APHY also appears to have been featured on such reputable
investment websites as "the stock mafia," "Alpha Penny Stocks," "Epic stocks picks,"
"OTCreporter," and "stockstars.net." APHY appears also to have paid for some of this
coverage.


Craig Eagle apparently received 10m shares of APHY in exchange for his services. The
CEO of APHY, Robert Delvecchio, who signed the consulting agreement with Craig Eagle,
appears to have founded Brockington Securities, inc. which was expelled from the

securities industry by FINRA in 7/2010 for failing to pay fines apparently because "the firm
failed to detect, investigate or report multiple instances of suspicious activity in customer
accounts." Why is Craig Eagle associating with people like this?


"Generex Biotechnology Corp." (OTCQB:GNBT): Another company where Craig Eagle
sits on the board, has declined -94.6% over the time frame below. GNBT shows no
material revenue over the past 3 years, $23.5m market cap, and I estimate has less than
one year worth of cash burn left on the balance sheet.


"Regenicin Inc." (OTCQB:RGIN): this stock of another company Craig Eagle sits on the
board of might be the most "questionable" one of all. The price chart may look familiar to
some of you familiar with questionable small cap stocks involving what could be paid stock
promoters:


The RGIN promotion repeated claims and posts by questionable "AimHighProfits"
(apparently a penny stock promotion website subsidiary of the famous Cooperman Bros.
stock promotion outfit) stating that"RGIN could see $1.8B in annual revenues." In my
opinion these promotional "estimates" are not credible and neither are these penny stock
promotion websites.


"AimHighProfits" disclaimer says:


"Since AimHighProfits.com sometimes receives compensation from, and its owners,
operators and affiliates may hold stock in, the profiled companies, there is an
inherent conflict of interest in AimHighProfits.com statements"

"Never invest in any stock featured on our site or emails unless you can afford to lose your
entire investment."


From the peak, RGIN stock declined -97.9% and looks like there are lawsuits involved as
well. RGIN now has $2.4m market cap, shows $0 revenue over past 3 years, with just
$40k in cash on the balance sheet.


In all of these companies Craig Eagle is/was involved in, shareholders basically lost
essentially everything and there are ties to stock pumping websites.


It also appears to me that Craig Eagle's contract with APHY has a specific clause that if
Pfizer found out and/or disapproved they would not publish or disclose Craig Eagle's
arrangement.


Well… That IS pretty bad…. But Jan E. Koe is an Independent Director! He could
save PVCT?


Some investors cheered the arrival of Jan Koe as an independent director given his
experience at ONE Bio, another public company. Unfortunately, Jan's track record as a
director at public companies appears pretty bad to me.


Jan E. Koe's ONE Bio ticker (OTCPK:ONBI) stock appears to have declined -99.16% over
the time frame in this chart. ONBI looks to be some sort of Chinese reverse merger herbal
extract company trading on the pink sheets which appears to have been hyped by the Red
Chip stock promotion firm that became famous for touting failed China reverse merger
frauds. Red Chips' disclosure on ONBI implies to me that Red Chip could have received
shares or options in ONBI in exchange for the promotion. Red Chip called ONBI a
"company you can trust" - trust that was apparently misplaced given the -99% price
decline.


I don't trust ONBI and I don't recommend you do either. ONBI stock declined -99% and
now looks to have a $1.87m market cap and doesn't appear to have filed SEC filings in
years. Jan E. Koe looks to have been paid a large amount of ONBI options in 2010 before
One Bio essentially went to $0. Jan E. Koe has experience on the board of a failed

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2230483-provectus-strong-sell-ties-to-paid-stock-promoters-sec-halt-risk-price-target-0 18/82


Chinese reverse merger, which seems to me to have used paid stock pumpers. Does this
qualify him to be a member of PVCT's corporate governance committee? Is this the
governance that shareholders deserve?


Further, in the PVCT 2013 proxy, the company discloses that it "paid $75,000 to each of
Mr. Smith and Mr. Koe for consulting services performed in 2013 with respect to investor
relations." I cannot recall ever seeing a company pay its own supposedly independent
directors additional non-board fees for investor relations activities. This seems like highly
questionable behavior for someone who owns 1,186,300 shares according to the latest
proxy. I note that Jan Koe also sits on the compensation committee - which appears to be
a highly questionable conflict of interest given these circumstances.


Well What About Jacob M. Plotsker?


Jacob looks up for the job at PVCT also, based on his experience. He is on the board of
EMIS, which has accumulated deficit of -$488m and the stock is -77% over the past 5
years. EMIS trades for $0.23 per share and has a $15m market cap on OTC with some
confusing related party transactions.


PVCT Financials are Tenuous with Less Than 4 Quarters of Cash Burn Left Per My
Estimates:


I believe PVCT's auditors and the NYSE are likely to require PVCT keep $4m+ in cash on
hand to avoid a "going concern" warning. Therefore PVCT will likely have to raise capital
and dilute shareholders when it gets close to the $4-5m cash level - in fact, I think the paid
stock promotion efforts exist exactly for this reason. Based on last Q, PVCT currently has
a cash burn of ~$950k per month, with $16.6m in cash on the balance sheet. I expect
PVCT will have to fund more FDA required work, more paid "Investor Relations" work and
possibly some other expenses meaning PVCT currently has less than one year worth of
cash on hand by my estimate. If they can't raise equity, perhaps because they fail to
increase their share count on their upcoming AGM, well, biotech firms can go bankrupt or
to $0 all the time, much like the multiple biotech stocks PVCT's cornerstone advisory
board member Craig Eagle is involved with.

How much longer can this go on?


PV-10 Claims are Not Credible and I believe PV-10 is worthless


Although I will share some background for context, the whole PVCT situation is so absurd
I don't even feel the need to go deep into the weeds and explain the "science" claims
here. If necessary I can delve into that in a later report. In order to understand PV-10 you
can just ask yourself some simple questions:


If PV-10 is so amazing why is PVCT covered by paid stock promoters? Why hasn't a big
global pharma company stepped in to partner on this claimed cancer treatment? Why no
Phase 3 trials despite years passing since the Phase 2 trials? Why has PVCT tried to
align itself with claimed Pfizer representatives who have been involved with numerous
failed stock promotions that resulted in total shareholder wipeouts? These questions
answer themselves in my view.


That being said, a little background is likely useful to explain my view that PV-10 is clearly
worthless. I believe the science behind PV-10 and PVCT's interactions with the FDA have
already been debunked thoroughly by Adam Feuerstein here, here and here - Provectus
has yet to convincingly respond to the issues Adam raised, in my view. So no need to
rehash what is already out there.


PV-10 is a fancy name for what they claim is a purified version of Rose Bengal, a common
dye that costs $30 from any medical supply store and is just a sodium salt stain,
apparently a derivative of coal tar, which is typically used to diagnose conjunctivitis. Also
commonly known as "Red Food Dye No. 105", it has been used as a food and textile dye
for decades. PVCT claims to have some technology to purify it but they have not started
Phase 3 trials and no formal partnership with a large pharma company has been
announced despite the fact that Pv-10 and Ph-10 have been touted for nearly 15 year
now.


Are we to believe that the good people of a large global pharma company with billions of
dollars of R&D budget overlooked the miraculous properties of a dye solution that has
been around for decades while simultaneously believing the only people capable of
unlocking this secret were four guys working out of a barn structure in rural Tennessee
who recently settled a lawsuit claiming they've been vastly overpaid?


PVCT completed a Phase 2 trial, 3 years ago and it appears to me that PVCT has done
virtually nothing on development since. No Phase 3 trial, no announced development
partner with a big pharma name, nothing material that I see. PVCT met with the FDA now

2 years ago about pursuing SPA for Phase 3 study.


From the title of this PVCT document (top left) some of the PV-10 research was conducted
in Iran? I have many Persian friends but Iran is not exactly a current hot bed of credible
biotech work at the moment. Why was PVCT conducting its scientific work in Iran?


PV-10 appears to have actually been promoted for over a decade now (as a similar drug
called PH-10 back then) back when it was at Photogen. As far back as the year 2000, PH-
10 was supposed to be a $200m (in the US) cure for psoriasis. It was also claimed PH-10
could be used as a radiation sensitizing agent. Neither of those claims worked out and
Photogen also was unable to ever secure a partnership with a large pharma company to
develop PH-10 despite public statements highlighting that as a goal.


Even if you think PV-10 has some value (beyond doubtful in my view) many of the patents
on PV-10 expire in a few years anyway. It's been at least 14 years since this drug was
originally hyped, so where are the results? I strongly doubt there will ever be any material
revenue generation to show for the R&D dollars and time spent on PV-10 and PH-10.


PVCT: If the FDA minutes and communications have been so promising why don't you
release it to the public and your shareholders?


FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) Odds are Heavily Against PVCT


The mathematical odds of PVCT receiving BTD is extremely remote. In 2013, 90.9% of
BTD requests were denied. Since October 1, 2013 84.2% of BTD applications have not
been approved. I believe PV-10 is clearly worse than your average drug applying here and
I believe has worse odds. From the FDA:


"The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence
that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically
significant endpoint over available therapy."


In my view there is little probability that PV-10 can be shown to have a substantial
improvement over available cancer therapy. Even in the remote chance PV-10 receives
BTD approval that does not by any means mean it is automatically approved or that it will
ever be used on patients.

I also find it concerning that apparently few reputable firms have put their money into
PVCT stock. Where are BlackRock, Fidelity, or any reputable focused healthcare
investors? Have any serious big-name healthcare investors scrubbed PVCT? Per CapIQ
data, this stock appears to be literally held almost entirely by unsophisticated retail
investors who typically don't have the resources to background check all the executives,
scrub the FDA trial data, FOIA the relevant government agencies, etc. This is never a
good sign in my view for a company that is claiming their purified Red Food Dye No. 105
cures cancer. I believe the retail shareholder base is entirely consistent with the paid
promotion efforts.

PVCT Valuation Makes No Sense:


If there is one thing investors have learned so far in 2014 it is that "story stocks" trading at
impossible valuations deliver swift and brutal losses when they come unwound. PVCT is
quite possibly the most overvalued stock I have ever seen. Based on the 173m shares
outstanding with the 72m options and warrants the market cap is an eye-popping $761m.
Cumulative net losses have been over $150m. I believe a company run by a small group
of people with a history of failure, paid stock promotion and an SEC lawsuit working from a
strange metal barn structure outside of Knoxville claiming their pure "red food dye no.
105" cures cancer is, at best, worth less than the few dollars in my wallet right now (I
mainly use my debit card for purchases these days).


By the way, the $62.04 price target on PVCT claimed by Osman and Small Cap Street is
completely absurd in my view. Based on PVCT's fully diluted share count of 245m shares
outstanding, $62 per share would mean PVCT has a valuation of $15.2B,implying this red

dye reverse merger with zero revenue or even Phase 3 trials is worth about the same as
global pharma giant Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) who is in 140 countries and has $7B in annual
sales.


I also find it interesting VICL had a market cap of HALF PVCT's before they tanked post
Phase 3 trials. Why PVCT deserves more than twice the valuation without phase 3 trials
and many more questionable issues is beyond me. With the recent destruction of many
momentum story stocks (FEYE, KEYW, UNIS, LOCK) if there is one thing investors have
learned it is that valuation matters and I think investors need to do their research here or
they risk suffering potentially total losses in quick order.


Even If You Believe PV-10 If Legitimate and Will Be Approved: Patent Cliff Starts In
~2 Years Anyway


I am not going to go through each of these patents but note that even if you believe PV-10
is an effective compound, the patents begin expiring very soon. This is one side effect of
touting a drug for over a decade without moving to phase 3 trials and approval. Even if
PV-10 is ever commercialized (I doubt) it seems likely that some other pharma company
can likely just produce a generic or engineer their way around the increasingly sparse or
expiring patents left on PVCT's purified version of "Food Dye No. 105". This patent chart is
directly from PVCT's SEC filed 10k.

Management Response:


I spoke with PVCT management. The company has stated they did not pay for the Small
Cap Street report but did not provide a direct answer as to whether they paid Hunter
Marketing. Did Hunter Marketing Group pay $10K to Small Cap Street for this report out of
generosity? Have there been payments made to other "marketing" firms by PVCT who
may have then paid for a promotional campaign? These remain important questions in my
mind. I think shareholders deserve immediate and complete transparency about where the
money for these promotional reports came from, all of PVCT's marketing and IR
"partners", and the complete FDA minutes need to be publicly released immediately in my
opinion. When asked about the $45m+ in compensation they have received, management
didn't even seem to know the number was this high.


Conclusion:


Even though I have years of dredging through small cap garbage under my belt, I still
found researching PVCT to be completely shocking - this is one of the worst stocks I have
personally ever seen. I feel sad for investors who have put their money in this stock who
may have not done their complete homework and checked the facts. PVCT was a ~$0.65
reverse-merger stock trading on OTC markets not long ago and I believe the stock is
going back there shortly once the promotion ends. Now with a larger share count, PVCT is
likely to trade well below its previous lows and I expect it will eventually disappear and go
to $0 like the founders' previous company IMCR.


Given all the red flags here and questionable people involved I believe even if you want to
speculate in tiny biotech stocks, you can find a better one than PVCT. I believe you could
basically throw a dart at the wall and find a biotech stock with a more promising collection
of people and future prospects than this mess.

Exactly - A lot of smaller biotechs rely on third parties to conduct trial testing details too. They do this to help
keep expenses down from hiring employees they don't need until it's time to actually launch a marketable

Although I agree with everything you wrote, been watching this one a long time. Got any idea why or how
they just added a Bayer exec. to their advisory board ? Even if it is about money, I would think a Bayer
employee would not do this....


Only thing I can think of is that they offered, he turned it down, but they "misunderstood his response" and
posted the PR anyway. That would or could be yet another sneaky trick....


I do still wonder about PV-10 , thoughts ? And how strange is it that you write today, so does AF, get a 17%
drop off of it. And it is countered with their PR... Very confussing, usually when a pump n dump works they
stick to one or the other...


21 May 2014, 06:53 PM

There are multiple large pharmaceutical companies who have high level execs on PVCT board. These people
are not there to waste their time, they are there because they are interested in the drug and the potential for
acquisition. Pfizer has 2 execs along with other BIG pharma. People do your homework. This article is full of
lies. Read the companies response.

"The mathematical odds of PVCT receiving BTD is extremely remote."


We aren't playing blackjack here. Therefore mathematical odds DO NOT MATTER. Each submission for BTD is
independent and should be treated as such. Tell me if the data stands up to what is required for BTD acceptance and
nothing more.


21 May 2014, 11:10 AM


jkrywyn
There are no ways to calculate odds since each submission is an independent event and because the FDA
does not publish each submission - we don't know what is being submitted or rejected in most cases.

How did you calculate those "mathematical odds"?


YOU DID NOT. You CANNOT. The FDA does not disclose who applies, who is rejected, and who is
rescinded. Companies usually only announce when they are accepted.


PVCT had full disclosure. Maybe one of two or three companies who have every disclosed applying for
breakthrough designation.


It is impossible to calculate those odds plus they are independent events. A qualifying drug gets BTD, 100%
of the time.


NO FACTS. Sad.


21 May 2014, 02:20 PM

When 9 out of 10 get rejected, the math does matter. Odds are in favor of rejection.


22 May 2014, 05:09 AM


Nick Santa
Odds and probability are both math logics. You just contradicted yourself.


If you want to go there, then how about this...most rejections are within 45 days of submitting for BTD. PVCT
is well past 45 days. Odds are therefore in favor of approval.

I am completely with you Derrick. This is a pretty outrageous article. I see no tangible evidence of stock
promotion, and to suggest that the structure of a facility is an indication of a poorly run, stock promoting
company is absurd. No tangible evidence whatsoever. Again, I don't understand why such articles get
published when it is all mere speculation...and it also doesn't cover the risks to a short position in the stock.
Why do I have to incessantly worry about covering risks in my bull articles on micro-small cap equities when
this author fails to mention the contrary perspective whatsoever?

PVCT has worked with an SPA for Phase 3 with the FDA and were ready to proceed. Then the FDA radically changed
their structuring. Essentially, the FDA reshuffled their organization and management was working with CDER for SPA
(who had no experience with local agents and SPA for melanoma, according to the blog). Management and
consultants thought they would get SPA summer 2011.


The CCDER and CBER staff were "reshuffled into DOP1 and DOP2 (division of oncology produts)


Essentially, the people they dealt with changed. Then, as they likely got back on track (they suggested it set them
back a year), in early 2013 BTD became an option.


BTD would get the drug to market faster so they are pursuing that and have had a cooperative working relationship
with the FDA

6. PVCT is a biotech startup. Average companies brining a cancer drug to market take over $1 billion dollars and ten
years. They have been working quicker and have used well under $200 million. They have been working with several
hospitals - the leaden in cancer research including Anderson and Moffitt. Most startups, unfortunately, don’t get
favorable financing. They had to use Network 1 and no longer do.

A lot of innuendo and very few facts. Guilt by association. Not a word about the research and the clinical results.


Not a word about Moffitt Research, including a peer-reviewed article in PLOS1, a release last August calling PV-10 a
potentially revolutionary treatment for melanoma, research reported in April at the AACR meeting about the efficacy of
PV-10, announced poster presentations at the upcoming ASCO convention and numerous other reports.


Provectus, with PV-10, is pioneering a new approach to treating cancerous tumors that only attacks the tumors
themselves, and also helps the body's own builtin defenses by causing or helping the immune system to attack
untreated tumors. Final data for its Phase 2 clinical study of PV-10 treatment of melanoma were presented at the

Their data is stunning.


Please read the data and abstract to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncoloy which is

1. Four employees: There is no argument there. To insinuate that a company with four employees means anything
negative is ridiculous. MULTIPLE cancer centers are doing clinical studies. The FDA designated PV-10 orphan drug
status and they are under compassionate use CUP program.


2. PVCT is not “connected” to paid stock promoters. This guy uses anecdotal evidence of other companies and tries
in a a roundabout way to connect them to Provectus. Not true. No facts to support this.


3 PVCT has worked with an SPA for Phase 3 with the FDA and were ready to proceed. Then the FDA radically
changed their structuring. Essentially, the FDA reshuffled their organization and management was working with CDER
for SPA (who had no experience with local agents and SPA for melanoma, according to the blog). Management and
consultants thought they would get SPA summer 2011.


The CCDER and CBER staff were "reshuffled into DOP1 and DOP2 (division of oncology products)


Essentially, the people they dealt with changed. Then, as they likely got back on track (they suggested it set them
back a year), in early 2013 BTD became an option.


BTD would get the drug to market faster so they are pursuing that and have had a cooperative working relationship
with the FDA


4. To suggest they had PH-10 and PV-10 in their last company - also a lie. They were a laser company.


5. Compensation is in line with other pharmaceuticals. Also - nothing there but anecdote and insinuations.


6. PVCT is a biotech startup. Average companies brining a cancer drug to market take over $1 billion dollars and ten
years. They have been working quicker and have used well under $200 million. They have been working with several
hospitals - the leaden in cancer research including Anderson and Moffitt. Most startups, unfortunately, don’t get
favorable financing. They had to use Network 1 and no longer do.

Here is a comment from Bronte Capital as it relates to articles such as this one. Like this article, this is one person's
opinion.  
“The area is incomprehensible even to most experts and hence it is very hard to tell a real biotech stock from a no-
hoper promote,” Bronte Capital’s March investment letter said, adding that “…virtually nobody is ever prosecuted for
fraud in biotechnology. This means promoters can sell dodgy biotechs free from risk of prosecution” 
Hempton, who has a widely followed investment blog, is apprehensive about the quality of information on Seeking
Alpha, which he says contains “free content from ratty short sellers to slimy stock promoters”.

“Quality control is not a high point on this site. Outrageous statements are a feature not a bug,” he said, noting that
Seeking Alpha does have a policy not to pay paid promoters. 
“Most of the people that write on this are interested in separating other people from their money. Free stock advice is
very expensive,” he says. 
Seeking Alpha has its critics but it has argued that it offers less conflicted research than sell-side analysts who
ultimately derive revenues from equity capital raisings. Often companies that do not have sound businesses are
forced to raise capital from investors repeatedly, generating fees from brokers. 
A research paper examined Seeking Alpha and suggested the site was able to harnesses the “wisdom of the crowds”
effect to outperform Wall Street analysts. 
Unilife’s tirade is not the first time the privately owned Seeking Alpha, which pays contributors based on page-views
and generates its revenues from advertising has attracted controversy.

Since you have started your article with "I BELIEVE", let me tell you what I BELIEVE. I believe you have spent an
incredible amount of time on writing this article, to which I commend you greatly. It was an in depth piece that took
much research, unlike some of the other articles out there. I believe that you have dredged up some VERY OLD
information that is being presented in a very SKEWED and DECEPTIVE manor.


I have been an investor in this company for quite awhile. As many of my SA friends are aware, I have had to battle
what WAS stage IV cancer for the past 6 years. I have fought, like so many others do. And now let me tell you what I
BELIEVE. I BELIEVE you are not presenting factual statements. I BELIEVE you are associated with other shorterers
to take this stock down. I BELIEVE you have no concern for someone like myself who has suffered through this
disease and desperately looks for a cure EVERY SINGLE DAY. I BELIEVE that your article along with some of the
others are setting cancer research and cures back years.


The biggest thing that I BELIEVE: I have had enough of this slander and I CHOOSE to fight cancer any way that I
can. I BELIEVE THE DRUG SHOULD BE JUDGED ON THE MERITS OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. I believe we
should wait for the FDA to make it's decision rather than rely on people like you who seem to just run this company
down based upon what I believe is your own personal grudge and financial interest.

They don't use their office to develop the drug. They used labs. Would a fancy building change the data? A
building is a building. It's sad if you judge any company's product based on their buildings.


How about you look up the several hospitals that use the drug for compassionate use or as designated by the
FDA as an Orphan Drug. And what about looking up MD Anderson or MOFFITT who present the data which
they are presenting in a few weeks at ASCO.

I would like to know why none of the reputable research that was done by the Moffitt Cancer Center was commented
on? It seems that all that was commented on in this article was meant to bash and scare stock holders. If a company
runs their business out of a warehouse, what is the big deal? To me, that accounts for low overhead. There has been
substantial research done on this drug on animals as well as humans. There seems to be a "personal" issue here
between the writer of this article as well as Feuerstine that provides bias against this company and its founders.
Business is business and business is 90% of the time dirty. Do your own research people. Whether this drug was will
be marketed by dirty businessmen or by saints, if it works, then it works. The FDA is so afraid of allowing certain
drugs to go through, not because they think it may not work, but because they think it will. Cancer is a moneymaker.
That's why they haven't banned cigarettes...it makes the government money. They know cigarettes cause cancer and
kill numerous people every year but tobacco it a crop we need to keep our economy afloat. Use some common sense
and don't feed into scare tactics. Look up the Moffitt research. My guess is that it wasn't mentioned because they do

OK, I almost bit until this article. You say do your own research? I went to Moffitt site. Seems like they are
shooting mice with the dye and checking the tumors and survivability, not doing that with the humans, hence
not advancing tumor reduction claims in humans.


Moffitt study (paid by Provectus) is designed to "assess immunological and blood biomarkers of melanoma
lesions injected with PV-10 and will not measure tumor response." This is Moffitts quote.

I've also looked at what isn't there - i.e. no progress some 4 years after the trial and the notable absense of
major partnerships. Also of note is that virtually no healthcare or biotech funds (or really any institutions at all)
own it - a huge red flag in biotech.


I put a zero % chance the FDA fast-tracks this thing.


Factor in the insane valuation and this looks like like a no-brainer short if one can withstand the volatility as it
makes it's way into penny stock land again.

The thing about articles such as this is that they cause people to look further into the drug/company to
eventually learn more.


You are looking at one minor study to begin to understand mechanism of action and there are many more
studies and much more data on humans.


Over 200 patients have been treated. 80 were used in an FDA approved phase 2 study. You are looking at a
preliminary study not to assess the drug's effectiveness but the first step in trying to understand the
immunological response. PV-10 is a cancer therapy but they have found that it has the effect that 1. it boosts
your immune system and 2. it works on non injected (bystander) lesions.


They cannot just observe these and say it's true so they begin with murine (mouse) studies then human
studies to understand the mechanism of action. Standard research protocol. The first studies begin with mice
then lead to humans to be sure it's safe enough and to get a head start and better understanding before using
humans. Humans were used.

including Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. The program has now been expanded to the United States, and
more than 100 patients have participated at the following active sites:


http://bit.ly/1toEwdV 
St. Luke's Hospital and Health Network, Bethlehem, PA; 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; 
University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; 
Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, CA; 
Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, Australia; 
Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; and 
Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.


 
Please note: PV10 was used on people who have been treated by other drugs and those treatments failed:


"“What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest
drugs including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter"


This shows it has effects that are in some cases responding where other drugs do not. Furthermore, it has
better response rates, including some complete responses. So it is actually more than "just a red dye". These
are independently verified studies and REAL PEOPLE who were suffering with cancer.


http://bit.ly/RVfK7r


Of the 28 uninjected bystander lesions 10 achieved complete response.


“These sub-analyses show PV-10- injection results are maximized when all lesions get treated. What we’re
seeing here is a remarkable response in a heavily pre treated or refractory patient population with locally
advanced cutaneous melanoma who have unmet medical needs since, unlike patients with more advanced
disease, limited treatment options are available,” said Eric Wachter, the Chief Technology Officer at
Provectus, who co-developed PV-10. 
That 56% of lesions in the sub-analysis only required one or two injections to achieve a complete response,
he added, underlines the simplicity of PV-10 treatment regimens.


“These results support a premise that not only is PV-10 safe and effective, but unlike many other intralesional
therapies, requires limited injections. This could prove highly advantageous for both patients and clinicians,”
said Wachter.


In a second abstract Amod Sarnaik, from Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa, Florida, investigated the
immunological mechanism of the ‘bystander effect’ where uninjected tumours undergo complete response.


In the study eight patients with dermal and/or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma had two lesions sampled
bybiopsy prior to treatment, then one of the two lesions was injected with IL PV-10, and both residual sites
were completely excised one to two weeks later.


Six of eight patients had metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab, anti-PD-1 and/or vemurafenib
therapy. Peripheral blood was collected pre-treatment, at the time of resection and four weeks after PV-10
injection.

Results showed treatment with PV-10 led to pathological complete response (pCR) in post-treatment biopsies
of both PV-10-injected and uninjected bystander lesions in four of the eight patients, and all eight exhibited at
least partial regression of the injected lesion. IL PV-10 was associated with an increase in circulating cytotoxic
CD3 /CD8 T cells (paired t test, p=0.008).


“What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest
drugs including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a
small molecule ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of
patients.


Both abstracts will be featured in the Poster Highlights Session, Melanoma/Skin Cancers, on June 2, 2014
during the American Society of Clinical Oncology (OTC:ASCO) Annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois.

And we shall see if your opinions are on track soon enough. FDA decision any day now. If they are approved,
will that change your mind?


So you only looked at the early data? What about the current data just released this week? http://bit.ly/RVfK7r


A zero chance is a bit extreme. FDA looks at the data. It's both safe and effective. What's not to approve?
This is a no brainer.


"Also of note is that virtually no healthcare or biotech funds (or really any institutions at all) own it - a huge red
flag in biotech."


You do realize they just uplisted to the NYSE?

>>Bayer board member was added yesterday to go along with:


2 Pfizer board members. 
1 Sanofi Board Member 
1 BoehringerIngheim<<


That is fiction. these individuals are not on the board of directors. They are only participants in a "Strategic
Advisory Board" which means they have no director liability and are effectively paid consultants.


 
>>They were recently VETTED by the NYSE and uplisted. I think the NYSE has due diligence. Took them
three months from application to uplist.<<


The NYSE does not do scientific due diligence. If you meet the listing requirements you are in:

Your first point is certainly accurate... Your second is baloney. There are thorough background checks done
on individuals and the Company before listing is allowed. You think there is simply a little check list which
suggests if you have enough of a market cap and pay the fee you are in ?


If it were that simple, NYSE would have been lumped with the OTCBB/pinksheets a long, long time ago.


Rubbish...

Directly from your very own link regarding listing standards:


Qualitative Standards


In evaluating listing eligibility, the Exchange also considers qualitative factors such as the nature of a
company's business, market for its products, reputation of its management, historical record and pattern of
growth, financial integrity, demonstrated earnings power, and future outlook.

Several things:


1) It's not even on the NYSE, it's the NYSE MKT which is the former AMEX


2) The poster was using the the NYSE as somehow validating the people and the business. That is pure
nonsense.


3) Exchanges (private for-profit entities) rely on the SEC, underwriters, and Auditors and their due diligence
on a business is virtually nil. Let alone making a scientific call LOL.


4) Even if you were right that the NYSE does a "thorough back ground check" what the heck does that mean?
Searching for criminal records, liens, and bankruptcies won't give much.


Feel free to outsource investment diligence to a listing officer on a stock exchange and see how far that gets
you.


I guess NQ Mobile (an NYSE-listed company) had NYSE investigators crawling around China and doing
forensic audits prior to the listing, right?

The article above indicates all sorts of associations with sleazy individuals and stock promoters. The author
was able to uncover this information on his own but the simpletons at the NYSE couldn't find any of this ?
couldn't make any of those same connections ?


I don't recall having suggested that people outsource their due diligence to the NYSE... their recent up listing
is one many factors that need to be considered, including the background of individuals who join the advisory
board and most of all - the apparent positive test results.


I don't claim to be able to offer an opinion on the science, only that it would appear to me that some reputable
institutions (NYSE, Moffit) and individuals have staked a degree of their hard earned credibility on this
Company.

"I would like to know why none of the reputable research that was done by the Moffitt Cancer Center was
commented on? It seems that all that was commented on in this article was meant to bash and scare stock
holders." In case this wasn't rhetorical: Shorts are under no obligation to present a fair and balanced view of
the stock they wish to push down. Maybe you can write your own positive article and submit it to SA.


23 May 2014, 10:40 AM


Derrick Lilly, Contributor
True, but according to the "guidelines" SA gives to contributors and supposedly follows regarding biotech
articles, in order to be published the article should:


"1) Core Scientific Competence: Demonstrate more than a basic familiarity with the scientific and medical
knowledge necessary to judge why said drug's prospects are either bullish, bearish or neutral.


2) Fundamental Analysis: A sound, and reasonable look at the the balance sheet, burn rate, etc. Obviously,
we don’t get hung up on earnings of early-stage companies, but let readers know the financial health of the
company and future prospects for the same.


3) Potential Risks: “There is always risk in early-stage biotech” does not suffice as a risk statement.
Regardless of a long or short thesis, present what hurdles must be watched for the reader to gauge the
ultimate likelihood of success of your thesis.

4) Quality Sourcing: Source material should be from reputable sources and should complement the piece, not
account for the majority of it. Cutting and pasting abstracts and the like doesn’t offer unique analysis.
Presenting an abstract in context of your own analysis does.


Finally, a word on bombast. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. An article claiming a stock is
going up 100% or more better be extremely well-supported. If you’re saying a drug will cure a disease, prove
it. Reasoned analysis draws the right kind of crowd. Yelling from the rooftops does not."


This "article" fails and should not have been published, IMO.

Wow, what a long article on here. First of all no position, so many comments are not from someone with a stake. I
hate this for those that are long, because if not true, then it hurts bad. The 4 employee thing looks to be defended well
on here, for a start up might make sense. As for the building, it does not look like a metal building from Oak Ridge
Hwy a major thorough fare btwn Oak Ridge and Knoxville as shown on google maps street view. Also, if the data is
found to be sound and verified by the FDA that is what matters most. Stock paid promotion? I would not want to invest
in a company that paid a penny stock promoter if they are found to do that, but is it illegal? Many companies are
involved in some form of payment for road shows to get secondaries paid for, am I right? Anyway, good luck to longs
if these accusations are proven to be false.

EvilBarbie's comment is poignant demonstrating the human reasons many of us are investing in this sector. Not to
say we don't do our due diligence. To imply it is a high handed insult. I have no problem with supporting companies
regardless of their pasts and hoping to make some profit by seeing their work benefit the patients who suffer any kind
of disease. I feel morally and financially rewarded.


It is just an ignorant argument to say because a drug is derived from a simple common substance it cannot be a
success. Do some basic research and you will find many.


Though I come from a family of lawyers, I am not one. There is and will continue to be serious investigations into the
legality of some of the statements made. I do not believe this kind of public manipulation falls under constitutional
freedom of speech. I am not alone and the overstepping to slander and defamation of character will ultimately land
this writer and his ilk under the heavy hand of legal justice. It is legal as well as moral turpitude.

MacCBOE
Atropa belladonna or Atropa bella-donna, commonly known as Belladonna or Deadly Nightshade, is a
perennial herbaceous plant in the family Solanaceae, native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. The
foliage and berries are extremely toxic, containing tropane alkaloids. These toxins include scopolamine and
hyoscyamine, which cause a bizarre delirium and hallucinations,[1] and are also used as pharmaceutical
anticholinergics. The drug atropine is derived from the plant. - this is from Wikipedia


I trained as a Pharmacist. There are so many drugs that are plant and simple chemically-based in origin. And
yet, consider the plant that we often derive life-saving drug atropine from:


Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found in the Eastern Hemisphere.[14] All parts of the plant contain
tropane alkaloids.[15] The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have
a somewhat sweet taste.[11] The consumption of two to five berries by a human adult is probably lethal.[16]
[17] The root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another.
[18] Ingestion of a single leaf of the plant can be fatal to an adult.[11][15]


Sounds pretty bad, does it not? And yet many drugs have their derivation in very simple chemicals and plants
and animals.


This running down of the Provetus drug PV-10 and its being Rose Bengal-derived? Just more comments to
defend your short position I suppose...

your post is pretty foolish, along with this entire article that fails to discuss anything related to the actual
medical studies going on with this product. You seriously think St. Luke's, Moffitt and other research facilities
around the world would be testing PV-10 and presenting on it if it was a farce? Look at the entire list of Board
members and their current employers and credentials... pretty sure Bayer, Pfizer, Sanofi, Livestrong,

From the link provided quoting a Life-Science Interview: Provectus is a fantastic story. The original Paul Ehrlich
(1854?1915) was a German scientist who came up with the term "magic bullet," which has become critically important
in the history of disease therapies. He found dyes that had no effect on healthy cells but could change the color of an
unhealthy cell. He surmised that if we can affect only an unhealthy cell, we can come up with magic bullets to cure
disease but don't affect healthy cells.


The irony is that one of the dyes he was working with was rose bengal, which is a derivative of coal tar. It was used to
dye wool a beautiful rose tint. Fast-forward 100 years to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where scientists look at
rose bengal and realize it has interesting ions that can be modified and activated using light and radiation. They're
really nanotech machines and vastly complex.

Sorry those of you mislead or who lost money or panicked and sold:


1. Four employees: There is no argument there. To insinuate that a company with four employees means anything
negative is ridiculous. MULTIPLE cancer centers are doing clinical studies. The FDA designated PV-10 orphan drug
status and they are under compassionate use CUP program. They work in the Oak Ridge National Lab.


2. PVCT is not “connected” to paid stock promoters. This guy uses anecdotal evidence of other companies and tries
in a a roundabout way to connect them to Provectus. Not true. No facts to support this.


3 PVCT has worked with an SPA for Phase 3 with the FDA and were ready to proceed. Then the FDA radically
changed their structuring. Essentially, the FDA reshuffled their organization and management was working with CDER

for SPA (who had no experience with local agents and SPA for melanoma, according to the blog). Management and
consultants thought they would get SPA summer 2011.


The CCDER and CBER staff were "reshuffled into DOP1 and DOP2 (division of oncology products)


Essentially, the people they dealt with changed. Then, as they likely got back on track (they suggested it set them
back a year), in early 2013 BTD became an option.


BTD would get the drug to market faster so they are pursuing that and have had a cooperative working relationship
with the FDA


4. To suggest they had PH-10 and PV-10 in their last company - also a lie. They were a laser company.


5. Compensation is in line with other pharmaceuticals. Also - nothing there but anecdote and insinuations.


6. PVCT is a biotech startup. Average companies brining a cancer drug to market take over $1 billion dollars and ten
years. They have been working quicker and have used well under $200 million. They have been working with several
hospitals - the leaden in cancer research including Anderson and Moffitt. Most startups, unfortunately, don’t get
favorable financing. They had to use Network 1 and no longer do.


7. PVCT has not made claims. They have shown data and clinical researcher and the most renown doctors and
cancer hospitals have shown data. This guy says nothing about data but linking to Adam F who has also never
refuted the data. He has also claimed he bashes PVCT for “Sport"


Located in Tampa, Moffitt is one of only 41 National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, a
distinction that recognizes Moffitt's excellence in research, its contributions to clinical trials, prevention and cancer
control. Moffitt is the No. 1 cancer hospital in Florida and has been listed in U.S. News & World Report as one of
"America's Best Hospitals" for cancer since 1999. With more than 4,200 employees, Moffitt has an economic impact
on the state of nearly $2 billion


http://bit.ly/1k5pdEr


look at the data


8. The recent changes were being pointed out by SALLY CHURCH and myself @jkrywyn on twitter contacted
management. There has been no decision and you do not and cannot know that until the FDA announces. I think
you’re mentally challenged. make it true. They made the changes to the website and Adam F went ahead and wrote
the article he was insinuating he would right saying it was false advertising. He wrote it anyway making (again - a
baseless one) an insinuation that this meant something or another.


It’s impossible to be worth $0 when your company has $18 million in cash.


Lastly:


In 2006 his father’s account purchased and profited $14,000. Dr. Argawala paid a fine and he has recently disclaimed
not to own any Provectus shares. He had made a mistake before this company was even an idea in his mind. Again.

things contradict you.

Again. I can never trust seeking Alpha again for misleading investors this way.


You imply the “mathematical odds of getting BTD” are slim. That is not possible to calculate. The FDA does not
disclose who applied. Only number of rejections, rescinded, and approvals. A good drug get it 100% of the time…. but
you’re using language like “mathematical odds” to sound smart and know nothing about statistics.

A VERY long SA article (it seems that the power of an SA article is proportional to word count).


I wished that the author could have talked more about its clinical data to invalidate their claims of PV-10 to cure
melanoma.


Still an interesting article to read through, though it took me an hour to finish. I agree PVCT is worth zero unless its
PV-10 could be approved. The chance of FDA approval is almost nil at this moment. So mathematically, it should be
traded less than 5 cents.

no one ever said PV-10 "cures" melanoma. It has shown a response rate of 51% in phase II trials. This is far

Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Refutes Inaccuracies in Seeking Alpha Article 
Business Wire Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. 3 minutes ago 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--


It has come to the attention of Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT: PVCT) (http://www.pvct.com), a
development-stage oncology and dermatology biopharmaceutical company (the "Company" or "Provectus"), that an
article was published on seekingalpha.com on May 21, 2104, which contains numerous inaccuracies and

misstatements about the Company. Without attempting to address every false statement and inaccuracy contained in
the article, the Company wishes to address some of the misinformation with the following facts:


The article alleges that the Company's oncology drug PV-10 "appears to have failed their Breakthrough Therapy
Designation." This statement is completely false. The FDA has not reported back to the Company with respect to the
Company's application for Breakthrough Therapy Designation. 
The article indicates that Provectus is "connected to questionable stock pumpers promoting PVCT including Small-
Cap Street LLC." To the contrary, Provectus is not connected in any way to Small-Cap Street LLC or any other similar
promoter. 
The article indicates that Provectus's patents begin expiring in 2016. In actuality, the most important patent with
respect to PV-10 does not expire until 2031, and of the eight patents that expire in 2016, none of the patents relate to
PV-10; seven of the patents relate to medical devices and one relates to dermatology. 
The article's summary concludes by saying "PVCT appears extraordinarily overvalued with ~$750 MILLION fully
diluted valuation. I believe fair value is closer to $0 and outline why in this report." Because the article is based on
numerous inaccuracies, this "belief" is unfounded. 
The legitimacy of any article authored by a pseudonym has to be questioned. The Company is at a loss as to why
individuals would be attempting to disparage the Company, but the Company will continue to proceed with our
business and plans as we have in the past.

Abstract NCT01760499 mon june 2nd 2014 asco


written by: 
Author(s): Amod Sarnaik, Georgina Crago, Hao Liu, Krithika Nandakumar Kodumudi, Amy Weber, Timothy McCardle,
Jeffrey S. Weber, Shari Pilon-Thomas; H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, FL; Moffitt Cancer
Center, Comprehensive Melanoma Research Center, Tampa, FL


Results: Treatment with IL PV-10 led to pCR in the post-treatment biopsies of both PV10-injected and uninjected
study lesions in 4 of the 8 patients, and all 8 exhibited at least partial regression of the injected lesion. IL PV-10 was
associated with an increase in circulating cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ T cells (paired t test, p=0.008). Pre and post PV-10
treated PBMC from one patient were re-stimulated with autologous tumor in vitro. Compared to pre-treatment, PV-10
treatment produced an increase in tumor-specific interferon-gamma release by ELISA. Six of 8 patients had
metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab, anti-PD-1 and/or vemurafenib therapy. Four of these 6 patients

PVCT stockholders would do well to review PVCT's response to an earlier attack at 
http://1.usa.gov/RVu8ww


The author here describes PV-10 as " a purified version of a commodity textile and food dye called "Rose Bengal"
(aka: Food Red No. 105) that can be bought for $30 at any medical supply store." 
Provectus earlier response noted that "We are writing in response to Adam Feuerstein’s article, “The Obsolescence of
Provectus' Skin Cancer Drug Means Current Speculative Run Ends Badly,” published on TheStreet.com, January 23,
2014. In it there are several inaccuracies and omissions. For instance, he writes that 'PV-10 is a diluted solution of
Rose Bengal' that 'can be purchased by the gallon from any chemical supply company.' In fact, the opposite is true.
PV-10 is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, high-purity concentrated solution of rose bengal manufactured specifically for
Provectus to modern pharmaceutical standards, under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), by specialty
contract manufacturers. The investigational drug product undergoes comprehensive chemical and biological release
testing prior to use in clinical trials. Neither the drug substance nor the drug product are available for third-party
purchase from any commercial source and both are of markedly higher purity than commercial dye-grade material
referenced by Mr. Feuerstein."

Mark Sams
This article is filled with half truths and glaring omissions. What about the great data from PV-10, what about the well-
reputed researchers who say it works and is safe, what about the lives they've saved where other (approved) drugs
couldn't make a dent?

Regardless of the veracity of the 'article' PV-10 has always been a crap shoot. 
Product still needed FDA approval. The company did introduce a carnival atmosphere with its prominent
references to "breakthrough". The small staff with the big salaries. The fact it was based on "unknown
actions" of a common dye that needed special purification. Couple that with the uncertainty of just how airtight
the relevant patents were. While these and other factors are not individually fatal, taken together they were

I think people are inferring that an association of company A with company B means there's some sort of tacit
approval. Just because a stock promoter touts PVCT doesn't mean PVCT approves of it. And just because
Pfizer is sharing the podium for a few seconds with PVCT does not mean they approve of it

Terrific work. I've seen a lot of dubious activity around tier-Z biotechs, and investors should all be a bit smarter. Paid
stock promoters seem to be in abundance in this space, and one of the things they appear to be doing is stimulating a
lot of chatter on various Internet forums; makes sense, doesn't cost them anything.


Kudos to author for doing the legwork here. With all the "XYZ Biosys ready to blow out the doors" articles here, its
nice to see a well researched bear article. PVCT proves once again that credulous investors will confuse a cheap
stock price with a cheap stock . . .

Gee.....I thought Apple began operations out of a residential garage? Silly me!


Oh, and isn't it odd that PVCT's PV-10 has achieved, at a couple of the most prestigious cancer research/treatment
centers in the US, an amazing record of efficacy for advanced recurrent melanoma in patients who have failed
multiple other treatments....think the ORR is over 50%! That is better than anything ever approved by FDA - these
patients are approaching death's door with no options left, and here comes a treatment which achieves such results
and even has a positive systemic effect on distant untreated tumors! Just odd that a 'scam' treatment, by a 'scam'
company could achieve such results.....guess Moffitt, St. Lukes, M.D. Anderson are all involved in the scam - yeah,
that explains it! ASCO guys must be involved too!! Boy what a 'service' you have provided with this article....your

21 May 2014


by ecancer reporter Janet Fricker


Half of patients with locally advanced cutaneous melanoma who had all their lesions injected with the investigational
agent PV-10 achieved a complete response, reports a subgroup analysis of an open label phase 2 study.


The sub-group analysis, released as an ASCO abstract (May 14, 2014), provides the basis for the pending
breakthrough therapy designation application for PV-10 submitted to the FDA in March 2014.


PV-10, a 10% solution of Rose Bengal that was originally used as an agent to stain necrotic tissue in the cornea, has
been developed to selectively target and destroy cancer cells without harming surrounding healthy tissue, minimizing
the potential for side effects.


Between October 2007 and May 2010, 80 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma received up to four treatment cycles
of intralesional (IL) PV-10. 
Altogether up to 10 cutaneous or subcutaneous target lesions and up to 10 additional non-target lesions received IL
PV-10 at day 0 and could receive up to three further treatment cycles at weeks 8, 12 and 16 if tumour remained.


Furthermore, up to two ‘bystander’ lesions were identified that underwent biopsy to confirm melanoma, but did not
receive treatment.


The subjects, recruited from seven centres in the USA and Australia, all had locally advanced disease refractory to a
median of six previous interventions.


In the current abstract, Sanjiv Agarwala, from St. Luke's Hospital and Health Network, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
explored the subgroup of 54 patients from the phase 2 study who were able to have most or all of their lesions
injected, leaving out patients with more advanced disease where substantial numbers of lesions went untreated from
the analysis.


Results showed that for 28 patients who had all their existing melanoma lesions injected with PV-10 (i.e. had no
uninjected lesions) the overall response rate was 71% (CI 51-87%) with 50% achieving a complete response (CI 31-
69%).


In a second analysis when these 28 patients who had all their lesions injected were considered together with a group
of 26 patients who had up to two lesions left untreated (to investigate bystander effects) a complete response was
achieved in 232 of the 363 injected lesions (64%).


Furthermore, the abstract showed that in the combined analysis 121 lesions required a single injection for complete
response, 84 required two injections, 22 required three injections and five required four injections.


Of the 28 uninjected bystander lesions 10 achieved complete response.


“These sub-analyses show PV-10- injection results are maximized when all lesions get treated. What we’re seeing
here is a remarkable response in a heavily pre treated or refractory patient population with locally advanced
cutaneous melanoma who have unmet medical needs since, unlike patients with more advanced disease, limited
treatment options are available,” said Eric Wachter, the Chief Technology Officer at Provectus, who co-developed PV-
10.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2230483-provectus-strong-sell-ties-to-paid-stock-promoters-sec-halt-risk-price-target-0 61/82


That 56% of lesions in the sub-analysis only required one or two injections to achieve a complete response, he
added, underlines the simplicity of PV-10 treatment regimens.


“These results support a premise that not only is PV-10 safe and effective, but unlike many other intralesional
therapies, requires limited injections. This could prove highly advantageous for both patients and clinicians,” said
Wachter.


In a second abstract Amod Sarnaik, from Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa, Florida, investigated the immunological
mechanism of the ‘bystander effect’ where uninjected tumours undergo complete response.


In the study eight patients with dermal and/or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma had two lesions sampled bybiopsy
prior to treatment, then one of the two lesions was injected with IL PV-10, and both residual sites were completely
excised one to two weeks later.


Six of eight patients had metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab, anti-PD-1 and/or vemurafenib therapy.
Peripheral blood was collected pre-treatment, at the time of resection and four weeks after PV-10 injection.


Results showed treatment with PV-10 led to pathological complete response (pCR) in post-treatment biopsies of both
PV-10-injected and uninjected bystander lesions in four of the eight patients, and all eight exhibited at least partial
regression of the injected lesion. IL PV-10 was associated with an increase in circulating cytotoxic CD3 /CD8 T cells
(paired t test, p=0.008).


“What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest drugs
including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a small molecule
ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of patients.


Both abstracts will be featured in the Poster Highlights Session, Melanoma/Skin Cancers, on June 2, 2014 during the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (OTC:ASCO) Annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois.

I would say the biggest asset this company has are its passionate "True Believers"


I have no skin in the game either way, but it seems unfathomably expensive at current prices. My best guess is that
the shorts will win this one. They usually do. But if this turns out to be the real deal, there may be some upside. Not
enough to justify the risk IMHO. I don't have the time or interest to check on the claim about the fully diluted share
count, but if there are that many options or warrants out there, depending on the strike price, that could be a huge
limiting factor.

And one of those BTD approvals was given to Clovis Oncology for this reason...


"The designation was based on interim efficacy and safety results from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of CO-
1686. An objective response rate of 64% in 14 of 22 evaluable T790M positive patients was observed. There
was no evidence of systemic wild-type EGFR inhibition."


So why would PVCT be denied BTD if Clovis was approved?

22 May 2014, 12:50 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
>>So why would PVCT be denied BTD if Clovis was approved?<<


There are many reasons. I'll give you one: There are no approved treatments at all for cancer patients with
the T790M mutation. That is not true for melanoma. For example Yervoy (which has data from over 1,800
patients from 12 different trials) and based on long-term follow-up studies extends life significantly.


22 May 2014, 01:39 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Yes you are right - the 10% is for biologics (CBER). 37% is still rather bad - and my opinion is Provectus is
weill below average in terms of data quantity and quality, and importantly there alternative melanoma
treatments on the market which is a major factor.


Also of interest in your link is the 100% performance rate. That is, 100% were dealt with within 60 days. 60
days from March 24 is tomorrow, no?


Didn't Provectus just yank "breakthrough" off its website on Tuesday?

You may want to look into Yervoy a little more.


Moffitt's "Assessment of immune and clinical efficacy after intralesional PV-10 in injected and uninjected
metastatic melanoma lesions."


"Six of 8 patients had metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab (Yervoy), anti-PD-1 and/or
vemurafenib therapy. Four of these 6 patients exhibited pCR to PV10 in both the injected and uninjected
lesions." PV-10 generated a complete response where other drugs failed to do so.


22 May 2014, 03:22 PM


Nick Santa
Yes they yanked Breakthrough the other day, but it's been up for years. They removed it on their own accord.
But Adam F chose to turn that into a negative. Makes sense though...that's what he does. That's quite a
reach to go there. His article was kinda lame.

Keubiko,


you get no respect for mentioning Yervoy, where death is a known recorded side effect and response rate is
horrible, almost not even worth taking by patients.


Rose Bengal has been used in Humans for decades with no serious known side effects. It is inserted into the
human Eye on regular basis....


Granted the dosage and administration route is different in PV-10, none the less 51% response rate is
unheard of in melanoma. only ONCS comes close with 38%, i know of nothing else that is even half that.


Don't try to pull this "breakthough" thing either and quote Adam F. He's a joke, and most people who do any
DD know this. He just writes about whatever and essentially has a 50/50 chance of being right....


You are on my "don't follow" list.

Keubiko, you still haven't responded to my question earlier. Why is that?


Yervoy is considered the gold standard. Because nothing is better on the market. Yet.


PV-10 data far exceeds Yervoy in both safety and efficacy. Once on the market, Yervoy will be a distant
memory.


What are your thoughts on this?

completed a thoroughly investigation of the people involved in Provectus and the company activities and associations,
from day 1. They also ensured that the company had the Management and Governance structure to be a going
concern of the caliber required for a NYSE listing. "

Well folks, as one of th spooked rabbits who beat feet, I can say this in hindsight: 
People are not thinking about the science, they are thinking they can't make money on their investment. They have
been induced to think that the principles are using the stock proceeds primarily as a means to enrich themselves.
That the amount of potential shares current or pending is out of line with the value or prospects of the company. That
the Companycollaborated with people primarily concerned with creating an exaggerated valuation of the Company.
These dilution issues must be addressed and disclosed specifically with names, numbers, amounts and dates. Then,
the discussion will return to the value of the science.


22 May 2014, 01:21 PM


Derrick Lilly, Contributor
The amount of fully diluted shares decreased in April. I'm not sure you know what you're talking about when
you say "dilution issues". SEC filings detail everything you need to know about warrants and options and
share issuance.


The real problem is that there is very little coverage of this company and is therefore prone to volatility when
news is released. Now that the stock has been uplisted, it will likely pick up real analyst coverage in time
which will reveal true data and financials and analysis of the industry like the one from Canopy I linked to
earlier.


22 May 2014, 01:30 PM

Canopy is an English company unregulated by their FCA which 'discloses' that it does sponsored research paid by
the client, presumably PVCT.


22 May 2014, 02:10 PM


Derrick Lilly, Contributor
Again, you'll cherry-pick information. They do both in-house and sponsored research.


"Canopy Research Approach 
The sponsored investment research program starts with the Canopy Research Profile (CRP), an in-depth
analysis of the company and the equities. This report is free of any trading recommendation and target price.
We estimate a fair value based on our valuation modelling with a NPV decision tree approach highlighting
possible outcomes and taking into account the flexibility and risk of the company business model. Even if our
investment research is sponsored by our clients, our opinion, estimates and fair value are only stemming from
our solely independent thinking. 
All data are from verifiable sources or based upon our explicit financial modelling and 
assumptions. Our research approach outlines our independent view of the business

My point was, however, that a true analysis presents the science and financials and competitive space. All
other things aside, NYSE listing should trigger future analysis because the stock is now more viable for
institutional investment.

Nice feint past the issue of who paid for 'this' Canopy research.


Lets forget who is dumping who is pumping and who is humping who and turn to the patents. Not the expired patents
which was a cheap shot, but the fundamental patent  on PV-10.


My understanding is that the patent is for purification and specifies that  the effect on cancer is by an "unknown
action". Me I think that *until* the specifics of the therapeutic actions are known and specified in the patent, the patent
can be challenged by a potential rival with a rose bengal variant or similar compound. At the very least this sets up
a potential patent fight with a richer adversary.


22 May 2014, 03:37 PM

I prefer to call "rose bengal" by it's other name:

Got it? Canopy was not paid to do it. It is their objective opinion. So once again, you are wrong. PVCT did not
pay for this report as you first suggested and then tried to state as fact.


I won't pretend to be a patent expert. Patent law and infringement is an increasingly complex topic. The fact
that they hold a patent for the purification and synthesis process required to create their formula (that works)
is a big deal and would be a roadblock for others trying to copy it.

Also the Canopy does not make all the reports available to unsophisticated or retail investors. Since you are

Kretikos, done and gone sounds like a good idea for you seeing that you don't seem to have the capacity to
do your research or present it fully. Again, you select one line from a very long ethics code and disclosure
pertaining to all aspects of Canopy's business. Why not include the entire thing? Because it doesn't support
the wrongful claim that you are trying to make that PVCT bought this report? I've already provided you with
the clear cut copyright text that discloses their PVCT report was not paid for or sponsored. Whether they do
other reports that are paid for is irrelevant because we are talking about "this" report, and "this" report was not
bought. End of story.

$PVCT has been denied BTD by the FDA. Solid work Pump Stopper. Sometimes people just want to believe what
isn't actually there.


23 May 2014, 02:18 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Make sure you read the FDA letter attached to the 8-K. My favorite quotes from the FDA:


"This determination is based on the paucity of data on endpoints indicative of clinical benefit"


"our inability to determine the clinical significance of the reduction in the size in one to 10 target lesions in patients
with locally advanced melanoma, who may have additional untreated cutaneous, subcutaneous, or visceral sites of
disease. The information provided on durability of response is also of unclear clinical significance given the
modifications to RECIST"


And here is the baseball bat over the head:


"FDA previously communicated concerns regarding the development program and provided advice regarding the type
of data that should be systematically collected to investigate the clinical benefit(s) of an intratumoral treatment of a
subset of individual lesions in a systemic disease (malignant melanoma), as previously discussed at the April 8, 2010,
March 7, 2011, and October 18, 2011, end-of-Phase 2 meetings and the December 16, 2013 General Guidance
teleconference. "


Some people always have to learn the hard way it seems.

in a mail stack that they just opened this morning, giggle, giggle. At least no worries about cover the short:)


Details:


Provectus 8K today with FDA May 16 letter exhibit: 
"...We have reviewed your request and while we have determined that treatment of “locally advanced cutaneous
melanoma” meets the criteria for a 
serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the preliminary clinical evidence you submitted does not indicate that
the drug may demonstrate 
substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Therefore, designation

Do I have to respect his product out of respect for those suffering from what he purports to cure?

Chris... did you read the phase II data..... please explain how it doesn't work and how you have come to the
conclusion that it will simply make tumors red....


This isn't a "con man" scenario. There have been a phase I and phase II trial done already. Trying to relate
pv-10 with a 51% ORR to a con man is just plain mean, inconsiderate and poor poetry.

23 May 2014, 05:01 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
MichaelJ8 - it's a common error in biotech investing to put the cart way way before the horse based on early
Phase I and Phase II data.


The study was extremely small (only 80). Much of the data is on a small subset of only 28.


But importantly it was an open label trial and subject to enormous bias. E.g. melanoma lesions can come and
go, specific target legions can be selected on a biased basis, same with patients etc., little data on clinical
endpoints and so on.


They need to do a large well-controlled Phase III double-blind random study with well defined endpoints.
Should have been done years ago.


The lack of any sophisticated biotech investors in this one should have been a huge red flag.

Keubiko,


I love this at the end of your statement: 
"The lack of any sophisticated biotech investors in this one should have been a huge red flag."


Your a class act, you know that. Wilson Wang you too.


I confront Chris Deluth about making fun of melanoma treatment that could save lives, you guys come rush to
his defense with ridicule.


Chris never answered my question.


Keubiko gives some type of answer about it being open label and a small study, while valid point, and may
very well be the reason BTD was rejected, it still doesn't answer my question: Is pv-10 just a dye as Chris
claims, or does it show effectiveness?


I will ask you this Keubiko, and any of the doubters: Has there been anything ever that comes close in any
study, open label or not, randomized or not, that comes close (excluding oncs)?


The answer... no.


They do need to a large well controlled phase III double blind random study... this is true for everything
Keubiko and its a moot point


I'll buy more come Tuesday, much more. If its sub 1$, i'll triple my position. I will put my money where my
mouth is. And I 'll be the last one laughing....


You shorts won this battle, and enjoy it while it lasts, but the war will be won by longs.

“This report outlines connections between PVCT and some of Wall Street's shadiest participants.” If you think those
mentioned, which you TRY to link to PVCT are shady, you don’t know Wallstreet.


“patents begin to expire in 2016.” Yes, the patents not related to their cancer treatment which expire in 16+ years.


“can be bought for $30 at any medical supply store” An AF talking point. It’s not the same and it can’t be used from
the medical supply store. No doctor ever would.


“the doctor involved with research into PV-10 was sued by the SEC for insider trading”.’ He is settled a suit with no
wrongdoing when his father’s account made $14k in 2006 before an announcement of a drug trial result. He paid a
fine. He disclosed no ownership in PVCT in a recent article. This happened years before ever working with PVCT. He
is employed by St. Luke’s research hospital.


You say he is “the doctor”. That is incorrect. He is one of more than ten doctors with their names tied to the research
of PV10, including world and US renown melanoma experts.

You try to manipulate to your advantage that he “was recently involved in a failed cancer trial that resulted in drug
abandonment.” Show me a clinical researchers


“PVCT is connected to questionable stock pumpers” You try to make a vague connection with no proof and saying
they are connected to someone who is connected - guilty by association?


“SEC Warns Investors about Stock Promotions, Halts Stocks” You list these stocks and insinuate PVCT is next. But
they have no connection to PV10 and your Small Cap conniption is unproven.    
“While the press release specifically focuses on marijuana-related investments” Yes. Because US Banks are unwilling
to take marijuana money yet as it conflicts with US law. You’re connecting this issue with PVCT?


“In January "Small-Cap Street" issued a report claiming PVCT is worth $62 per share” PVCT had nothing to do with
this and it appears to be a pump and dump scheme, before a short attack by Adam Feurestein. I am not alleging
Adam was connected (don’t use your logic), but his articles aided in the quick stock decline and panic.


“Osman Ghani has recently authored numerous reports on a variety of stocks as a paid article writer.” You fail to
mention he was not paid by PVCT but by his employer who pays him to write articles. You do realize that journalists
get paid by employers (and writers on seeking alpha get paid by seeking alpha) to write articles, no?


“I researched Paul in great depth and found a lot of red flags.” Could you provide the research and what the red flags
are? That’s what a journalist does. They present the facts. The do not say “I researched this a lot and found a lot of
bad stuff. Trust me.”


PVCT will be fighting these allegations and the lawyers looking to make a buck. I believe they are quoting Adam
Feurestein and this article as the basis for their lawsuit, which seems to lack any credible evidence (just accusation).


 “Just to use "OTCbbjournal.com" as an example, EKNL listed on the otcbbjournal.com homepage with RFMK and
OOIL shown as their picks here.


EKNL: $0 revenue, basically $0 cash and $2.85m market cap with huge stock decline”  Are you suggesting every
single stock they picked (not to defend them, I don’t read their things because they aren’t very capable writers) went
to zero? None went up? Or are you cherry picking a few bad examples?


“I also find the disclosure on compensation regarding Small Cap Street to be confusing as well. This Small Cap Street
PR about PVCT shows no disclosure of compensation as of 1/22/2014. However, this PVCT announcement shortly
after on 2/27/2014 shows Small Cap Street was paid $10k by the mysterious "Hunter Marketing.””   You really
need to have some evidence that “Hunter Marketing” is related to PVCT. There is clearly no evidence of that. How
about the idea that Hunter Marketing participated in the run up in January and then the naked short scheme. There
have been allegations a large firm in Canada naked shorted some 20 million shares.

“Multiple Small-Cap Street LLC Stocks Have Recently Been Halted by the SEC: Is PVCT next? 
Just this last Friday 5/16/2014 the SEC issued a warning to investors. In this warning the SEC highlighted they have
halted 5 stocks recently.” 
 MOST OF THESE ARE POT STOCKS!!! You are cherry picking information and virtually all pot stocks were halted,
not because of their promotion by any company (and there have been many promoting pot stocks) but because the
SEC is trying to figure out the legality of those types of stocks as marijuana is illegal by federal statute.


“Given the recent SEC actions against three public companies Small Cap Street LLC has recently written about, I
think it is possible that the SEC is looking at the various people involved and the other companies they are involved
with. PVCT stock is clearly on this list and I would not be surprised if the SEC steps in and shuts PVCT down or halts
the stock soon as well.”


CLEARLY ON THIS LIST???? “I think it’s possible” (anything is possible. You have no proof and are just guessing)
yet say “PVCT is clearly on the list”   WHAT LIST??????? There is no list. You just said you only think it’s possible.
 


“PVCT's Dr. Sanjiv Agarwala History of Drug Trial Failure”  EVERY Clinical researcher does. Show me one that
has a 100% successful drug research rate and I’ll give him a nobel prize. Investigating drugs MEANS trying to see if
they work or not. He has not bearing on if the drug works or not. Ever. He and other doctors administer and document
the drugs. He has never misled or forged any clinical tests. The accusation here does not point to anything concrete.


“Cancer is a highly complex group of diseases. Do you believe cancer will be cured by someone with this track record
of litigation by using a purified red dye?”


This doctor did not make the drug. He is one of more than a dozen doctors at seven sites in two countries doing trials,
administering the drug under compassionate use to those who do not have any hope (and have tried all approved
drugs). AND current research shows PV-10 is working on dying patients (refractory patients) who did not even
respond to the current leading drugs:   
““What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest drugs
including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a small molecule
ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of patients.” 
 http://bit.ly/RVfK7r


I could continue, but I only wanted to point out some logic errors. It’s not worth my time. People interested can learn
the facts about the drug and its efficacy, which you even fail to get into. Linking to Adam Feurestein articles does not
prove the clear evidence of efficacy, just that it has not been approved yet. He even himself suggested that they “do a
phase three and until then, shut the f#$k up” at the end of the article. Classy and professional, I might add.


The fact is, PV10 works. It works on multiple stages on melanoma. It has shown success in liver and breast. It has
shown that it boosts the immune system (it has local and systemic benefits), as well as killing cancer cells that are not
directly injected (which is great for cells not seen). It has been treated on over 200 patients to great success and has
helped the lives of many people.

21 May 2014


by ecancer reporter Janet Fricker


Half of patients with locally advanced cutaneous melanoma who had all their lesions injected with the investigational
agent PV-10 achieved a complete response, reports a subgroup analysis of an open label phase 2 study.


The sub-group analysis, released as an ASCO abstract (May 14, 2014), provides the basis for the pending
breakthrough therapy designation application for PV-10 submitted to the FDA in March 2014.


PV-10, a 10% solution of Rose Bengal that was originally used as an agent to stain necrotic tissue in the cornea, has
been developed to selectively target and destroy cancer cells without harming surrounding healthy tissue, minimizing
the potential for side effects.


Between October 2007 and May 2010, 80 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma received up to four treatment cycles
of intralesional (IL) PV-10. 
Altogether up to 10 cutaneous or subcutaneous target lesions and up to 10 additional non-target lesions received IL
PV-10 at day 0 and could receive up to three further treatment cycles at weeks 8, 12 and 16 if tumour remained.


Furthermore, up to two ‘bystander’ lesions were identified that underwent biopsy to confirm melanoma, but did not
receive treatment.


The subjects, recruited from seven centres in the USA and Australia, all had locally advanced disease refractory to a
median of six previous interventions.


In the current abstract, Sanjiv Agarwala, from St. Luke's Hospital and Health Network, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
explored the subgroup of 54 patients from the phase 2 study who were able to have most or all of their lesions
injected, leaving out patients with more advanced disease where substantial numbers of lesions went untreated from
the analysis.


Results showed that for 28 patients who had all their existing melanoma lesions injected with PV-10 (i.e. had no
uninjected lesions) the overall response rate was 71% (CI 51-87%) with 50% achieving a complete response (CI 31-
69%).


In a second analysis when these 28 patients who had all their lesions injected were considered together with a group
of 26 patients who had up to two lesions left untreated (to investigate bystander effects) a complete response was
achieved in 232 of the 363 injected lesions (64%).


Furthermore, the abstract showed that in the combined analysis 121 lesions required a single injection for complete
response, 84 required two injections, 22 required three injections and five required four injections.


Of the 28 uninjected bystander lesions 10 achieved complete response.

“These sub-analyses show PV-10- injection results are maximized when all lesions get treated. What we’re seeing
here is a remarkable response in a heavily pre treated or refractory patient population with locally advanced
cutaneous melanoma who have unmet medical needs since, unlike patients with more advanced disease, limited
treatment options are available,” said Eric Wachter, the Chief Technology Officer at Provectus, who co-developed PV-
10. 
That 56% of lesions in the sub-analysis only required one or two injections to achieve a complete response, he
added, underlines the simplicity of PV-10 treatment regimens.


“These results support a premise that not only is PV-10 safe and effective, but unlike many other intralesional
therapies, requires limited injections. This could prove highly advantageous for both patients and clinicians,” said
Wachter.


In a second abstract Amod Sarnaik, from Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa, Florida, investigated the immunological
mechanism of the ‘bystander effect’ where uninjected tumours undergo complete response.


In the study eight patients with dermal and/or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma had two lesions sampled bybiopsy
prior to treatment, then one of the two lesions was injected with IL PV-10, and both residual sites were completely
excised one to two weeks later.


Six of eight patients had metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab, anti-PD-1 and/or vemurafenib therapy.
Peripheral blood was collected pre-treatment, at the time of resection and four weeks after PV-10 injection.


Results showed treatment with PV-10 led to pathological complete response (pCR) in post-treatment biopsies of both
PV-10-injected and uninjected bystander lesions in four of the eight patients, and all eight exhibited at least partial
regression of the injected lesion. IL PV-10 was associated with an increase in circulating cytotoxic CD3 /CD8 T cells
(paired t test, p=0.008).


“What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest drugs
including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a small molecule
ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of patients.


Both abstracts will be featured in the Poster Highlights Session, Melanoma/Skin Cancers, on June 2, 2014 during the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (OTC:ASCO) Annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois.

jkrywyn_john, thanks for the pointing out the multiple fallacies in the post.


I think SA editors should put their foot down. Any argument that essentially says "the company is bad
because bad third parties unrelated to its officers have chosen to write positively about it" should be edited
out before being published. SA articles should contain VALID arguments for or against a company.
Sensationalist articles may get more eyeballs short term, but will wear down the brand longer term.

I have sent them numerous emails. Unfortunately, the require extra fact checking to promote a biotech stock
in a bullish sense, but apparently much less or none when bearish. They want to protect investors because of
the risky nature of biotech startups.


Documentation of trying to submit bullish articles (not me. Alan Ross) with fact checking and data to prove it,
being refused publication demonstrate this.


My conclusion is Seeking Alpha favors bearish slants.

I know you're NOT AN INVESTIGATIVE journalist. You indicate you are a SHORT and wish to prove that
point.


A real journalist presents both sides of view and the facts and lets people decide. You want to present only
information that supports your position and want to convince people. I understand that. I can even respect
your efforts.


In fact, your melanoma patient valuation is NOT the complete truth as you can find (Alan Ross found this data
and posted it on his free site):


http://bit.ly/1wCrLPA


PV-10 has shown promising results. In fact, Moffitt started a study to explain WHY it created an immune
boosting response. They injected patients and checked a few days later to see if they could begin to
understand how it works. THERE WAS NO MORE CANCER, so they had to do it again.


"Dr. Pilon-Thomas of Moffitt stated, "These data are exciting and illustrate successful translation of our pre-
clinical work in mice to clinical results in melanoma patients. With only 8 patients we've been able to clearly
observe statistically significant increases in beneficial T cell populations in peripheral blood. Ironically, the
original aim of the trial to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was thwarted when biopsies of patient tumors
collected just 7-14 days after PV-10 injection no longer contained viable tumor tissue. We are following up
both the human data and continuing to design more experiments in mice to better explain the systemic
immune effects elicited by PV-10 ablation."

You are assuming only one part of a stage of melanoma. You are assuming a ridiculous price of $50,000 (it
would be closer to $30,000 per treatment - 1/3 the cost of the current treatments of $100,000 or more), it
could be used at multiple stages and it could be used before surgery in stage 2, resectable patients. Cheaper
(insurance companies will prefer it) and more widely used (the old supply demand curve where you can
charge less for something you sell way more of).


It has also shown stunning results in Lung and Breast.


So here are some numbers for you (remember YOU said numbers DON'T LIE)

Here you can find information about world cancer statistics for the most common cancers (excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer) in 2012, the latest year available.


http://bit.ly/1dGc7My


 
Lung cancer was the most common cancer worldwide contributing 13% of the total number of new cases
diagnosed in 2012. 
Breast cancer (women only) was the second most common cancer with nearly 1.7 million new cases in 2012. 
Colorectal cancer was the third most common cancer with nearly 1.4 million new cases in 2012. 
Rank Cancer New cases diagnosed in 2012 Per cent of all cancers 
(excl. non-melanoma skin cancer) 
1 Lung 1,825,000 13.0 
2. Breast 1,677,000 11.9 
19. Melanoma 232,000 1.6


 
So while the FDA said the NEED MORE DATA, this drug works and it works astonishingly well.


30 May 2014, 07:55 PM


jkrywyn_john
You also fail to mention their PH-10 drug and the fact that these drugs, if approved, both PV-10 an PH-10, would be
sold worldwide for more than one indication.


30 May 2014, 02:25 AM


jkrywyn_john
To suggest this is not a real drug and dismiss it by calling it "just a dye" is ludicrous and childish. They would not have
gotten through a phase 1 trial successfully and then a phase 2 trial with the FDA. Furthermore, the FDA would not
have told them to re apply for BTD in the FDA letter and they would not be working with them.

Still waiting for the "Ties to stock promoters". You can't tie something to someone without evidence and just because
you "think".


I also find it HILARIOUS that you mentioned three or four stocks this Small Cap Street place mentioned that ended up
going to zero.

By that logic, since the Wall Street Journal has likely had articles or talked about 3-4 stocks that have failed, every
stock they mention will fail?


Such weak logic.
