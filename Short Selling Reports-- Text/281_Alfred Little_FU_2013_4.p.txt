FAB Universal Media Kiosks: A Fundamental Misunderstanding?
Dec. 17, 2013 8:39 AM ET43 comments
by: Alfred Little


Editors' Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less
than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.


After an unnecessarily long delay, on 12/10/13 FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) finally
responded, in part, to the numerous issues raised by others and myself. FAB admitted that
one of their Chinese "VIE" subsidiaries sold $16.3 million in Chinese bonds without
disclosing the issuance to the SEC and U.S. shareholders in violation of numerous
Federal securities laws.


The illegal bond issuance was first exposed on 11/15/13. On 11/19/13 FAB CEO Chris
Spencer acknowledged receipt of an email from me that contained a copy of the bond
prospectus, clearly showing that FAB's VIE subsidiary was the issuer. Even though Chris
had evidence in hand that proved the bonds were issued, he nevertheless authorized a
press release the following day containing a "vehement denial" of all the allegations.


Chris's reckless behavior lured investors into buying millions of more shares of FAB before
trading was finally halted two days later.


In today's report, I challenge FAB's response point by point, showing:


1. FAB has failed to take the most basic step allowing investors to verify the existence of
its media kiosks.


2. FAB does indeed guarantee a minimum return on franchisees' investments.
3. FAB has failed to acknowledge its removal of pirated content from its media kiosks.
4. FAB's cash confirmations are meaningless.
5. FAB's independent directors have yet to agree to meet with me to review the evidence.


Kiosk Business Misunderstanding?


In its response, FAB again failed to provide the locations of its media kiosks, the existence
of which I continue to challenge. Instead, FAB asserts that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 2/18


"The short sellers have a fundamental, but understandable, misunderstanding of the
economics of the Company's business. FAB does not buy, sell or own kiosks.
Instead, it sells licenses to operate Intelligent Media kiosks and to use the software
to run the kiosks through 40 independent regional agents who are responsible for
signing up licensees, deploying the kiosks and reporting the number of installed
kiosks."


I do not see where there is any misunderstanding. FAB's SEC filings are reasonably clear
about the operation of the kiosk business, as shown below.


According to FAB's 6/1/12 Proxy, the FAB licensing program binds FAB and "each small
investor" (the franchisee) as follows [Note: Spelling and grammar errors in the original]:


"FAB licensing program is a merchant program that binds the FAB and each small
investor or vendor. Under this program and associated contract, both licensor and
lincensee take their joint-business obligations as follows:


1. The licensee pays for FAB Kiosk and other equipment and fixtures while the
licensor (FAB Media) is responsible for the complete set-up of each FAB outlet
from the location selection to construction or conversion, remodeling and
equipment installation.


2. All FAB outlets will be owned by the licensee, but supervised by a designated
management company - Beijing Huzhong Culture Co., Ltd ("Huzhong Culture") in
accordance with FAB's distinctive business formats.


3. FAB kiosks are linked to the server station through the internet to remain
updated. Such maintenances are operated by Huzhong Culture."


Furthermore, FAB's 2012 10-K contains a warning that:


"Our ability to generate revenues from Kiosks depends largely upon our ability to
provide licensees networks of Kiosks in desirable locations throughout major urban
areas in China. This, in turn, requires that we develop and maintain business
relationships with real estate developers, landlords, property managers,
hypermarkets, retailers, and other businesses and locations in which we are
provided space for our facilities."


The indisputable points from FAB's SEC filings regarding its kiosk business are:


1. FAB selects and maintains the locations.



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1074909/000101041213000061/f10kv10clean.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 3/18


2. FAB builds out and installs the kiosks at the locations FAB selects.
3. FAB, via Huzhong, supervises the kiosks in operation.


Critically, the FAB Chinese bond prospectus disclosed that Chairman Zhang controls
Huzhong. FAB's SEC filings failed to make this same disclosure.


Thus the franchisees (or licensees, as FAB also calls them) are merely investors. It is
therefore not surprising to see that FAB in the Proxy mentioned above, actually refers to
the franchisee as a "small investor."


As I have explained before, given FAB's control over the kiosk location selection, build-out,
and operation of each kiosk, FAB management should be well aware of the precise
locations of each of the purported 16,820 media kiosks actively deployed. Publishing a list
of the 3,954 Beijing media kiosk locations should be as simple as making a PDF of a
spreadsheet, assuming the kiosks exist. There is no need to translate the Chinese
addresses since an English list would be harder to verify.


Rather than printing out and publishing the list of media kiosk locations, FAB's Board has
wasted a lot of time reviewing franchisee-licensing agreements:


"As part of its preliminary review, the Board has examined data concerning the
licenses to operate kiosks entered into by the Company as of September 30, 2013,
and has re-verified 12,866 licenses. Verification of the remaining licenses will
continue until all licenses have been reviewed."


What was the point of verifying licensing agreements, when the physical existence of the
media kiosks is in question?


FAB should simply publish the locations and let investors perform their own verifications.
FAB's continued delay in publishing the locations only allows Chairman Zhang more time
to cover-up his fraud.


3,954 Beijing Media Kiosks: No More and No Less?


FAB's response asserts that the company has deployed 3,954 media kiosks in Beijing as
of 9/30/13. FAB has claimed to have precisely 3,954 media kiosks in Beijing since at least
2011, when FAB disclosed this exact same number in an 8/9/11 press release filed as an
8-K.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 4/18


Therefore for the past two years, FAB would like investors to believe that its purportedly
wildly profitable kiosk business in Beijing has not grown or declined by a single unit. This
seems highly unlikely since FAB has an office in Beijing where FAB's Director of
Franchisee Sales, Wang Lirong, promotes FAB's kiosk business to potential franchisees.
As part of her sales pitch, she pointed out that she franchised a kiosk, herself, in March
2013, participating in FAB's Beijing media kiosk deployments this year. Even so, FAB's
Beijing media kiosk count somehow remains stuck at 3,954.


Minimum Guarantee Shenanigans


Regarding the minimum guaranteed return FAB promises on Franchisees' investments,
FAB responded:


"To date, the Company has completed a review of 75% of the license contracts and
has not identified any instances of a minimum guarantee. FAB maintains that it has
never entered into any agreement with an agent or licensee for a minimum return
guarantee or stock payment by the Company. Any communication to the contrary
was unauthorized and is unenforceable."


Therefore FAB seems to be saying that the sales brochure provided by FAB's Director of
Franchisee Sales to my investigators was not approved by FAB. Neither was FAB's
Chinese bond issuance approved by FAB. That does not mean that promises of
guaranteed minimum returns were not made.


The guaranteed minimum return is clearly spelled out in FAB'S franchisee sales brochure.
FAB promises that a franchisee's investment of 80,000 RMB to buy a media kiosk will be
worth at least 90,000 RMB after two years, regardless of the profitability of the kiosk.


FAB's response does not mention whether the FAB Board reviewed the operating
agreements that accompany the franchising agreements. The operating agreement that
my investigators reviewed clearly states that Huzhong guarantees the franchisee's
investment of 80,000 RMB per kiosk. Recall, again, that Chairman Zhang controls
Huzhong, according to the Chinese bond prospectus.


The operating agreement references an acknowledgement letter agreement that on the
surface appears to entitle the franchisee to have his/her kiosk bought back by FAB for
cash or stock at a premium to the amount originally invested, in accordance with the terms
set forth in the sales brochure. However, the acknowledgement letter contains a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 5/18


contradiction: the brochure promise that FAB "will" buy back the franchisee's kiosk is
replaced by the statement that FAB "can" buy back the franchisee's kiosk after two years,
creating a loophole for FAB to dishonor the promise made in its sales brochure.


Any potential franchisee who carefully reads the agreement would likely strike out the
word "can" and replace with the word "will" before signing it, to match the language of the
sales brochure. However, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that many franchisees do not
catch the change of terms. In those cases, their 80,000 RMB investment is still
guaranteed by Huzhong, according to the operating agreement, but FAB might be able to
avoid being forced to buy back the kiosk for 90,000 RMB as stated in the brochure.


Pirated Content


FAB has not acknowledged that its Beijing media kiosks contained pirated content that my
investigators caught FAB subsequently removing. In its response, FAB simply promised to
"…examine its content control processes with the assistance of the independent third
party and implement any measures deemed necessary to tighten controls."


Without the pirated content, which included recently released movies not yet available on
DVD, FAB's media kiosks will have difficulty attracting consumers. If FAB's Board
succeeds at banning the pirated content and eliminating the minimum guaranteed returns,
FAB's media kiosk business model is unlikely to attract new franchisees.


New Retail Store Prepayments


Shifting its focus going forward toward digital distribution, FAB decided to cut back new
store plans and seeks the return of $17.8 million in new store prepayments purportedly
made to third parties over the last year. Were these prepayment ever made in the first
place?


Cash Confirmations


FAB reports that it received "cash confirmations" from five bank accounts confirming its
cash. Do cash confirmations mean anything in China? Definitely not. Professor Paul Gillis
of Peking University explains why, here on his China Accounting Blog.


Additionally, FAB received a cash confirmation from the (unnamed) account where
Chairman Zhang had secretly deposited the Chinese bond proceeds. After being busted
by GeoInvesting, Zhang returned the bond proceeds to a "FAB Universal" operating
account. Since Zhang purportedly returned the proceeds, should he avoid getting charged
with fraud? Hopefully not.

Conclusion


I have repeatedly offered to meet with Chris Spencer, FAB's independent directors, and
auditor to present my evidence. To date, while Chris Spencer initially expressed interest in
meeting, neither Chris, the directors, nor the auditor have arranged a meeting. It is
imperative that FAB's newly appointed independent investigators contact me to review my
evidence. As I have said before, it is critical for FAB's gatekeepers to take swift action to
protect shareholders.


Disclosure: I am short FU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Lucky?
So the cash is fake, because all companies fake cash in China? That's your argument? Of course cash can be
verified in China. You just have to skip the small town branches and go to the main office. I thought after Longtop
everyone knew that? Well, maybe "everyone" was too much of a stretch. 
As for this: 
"This seems highly unlikely since FAB has an office in Beijing where FAB's Director of Franchisee Sales, Wang
Lirong, promotes FAB's kiosk business to potential franchisees. " 
You're kidding me, right? Beijing office? Really? How about they met your kids at the Joy City Store after a phone call.
Director of Franchisee Sales? Yup, and what great investigative work did the kids do to verify that title? Really? This
just asked her? I thought FAB just stated they sell licenses though INDEPENDENT agents. What did she say when
the kids asked her that? Oh, they didn't? 
Well, what did she say when she offered up a brochure and a sales agreement that contracted each other? Really?
They missed that question, too? Alright, those were tough ones for kids to run with. How about when she stated she
herself recently bought a "Beijing License", did the kids ask to see it? What did she say when they told her FAB hasn't
sold one in Beijing in a year and half? Oh, they missed that one, too? 
Did they ask her what is the difference between the modern day Kiosks and the 10,000 plus FAB sold prior to the
2012 agreements you keep quoting? Whoops, missed that one, too. How about what part of the 4M in annual revenue
FAB gets for advertising on these "non-existent" from the two companies you refuse to let you kids call? Nope,
another missed opportunity. 
And you wonder why no one wants to talk to you or your kids.

Author’s reply »  Wang Lirong's FAB business card shows she is an employee of FAB, with the title Director
of Franchisee Sales, working out of the FAB sales office in the Joy City building in Beijing. She sent the
agreements via email several days after the meeting.


FAB's Beijing media kiosks franchising is managed by Director Wang, and her staff, working in FAB's own
company sales office. Wang's statements should be more reliable that any agents working outside of Beijing.


We raised most of the items you mention with her. We recorded detailed answers from her. Yes, she gave us
a scanned copy of her Beijing kiosk operating agreement and side-letter acknowledgement agreement.


She explained that FAB had stopped selling the old "green" 5C kiosks a few years ago, having switched to a
new "5C Pingo" branded model with some additional features. The key point is that whe was unable to ever
give us locations where we could see the new 5C Pingo media kiosks deployed in Beijing.


In over a month now, FAB cannot provide a basic Chinese list of media kiosk locations either. You have to
conclude that the 3,954 Beijing media kiosks don't exist.

responsibilities to FAB shareholders. Rogers should immediately resign as a director if he does not want to do

The SEC is getting tougher on what the agency calls "Gatekeepers" - Auditors, accountants, and directors. I
hope the SEC will charge all of FAB's gatekeepers with failing shareholders.

I attribute the losses to misguided short traders who found out in advance the bond was "illegally" sold in
China and then began short raiding (lowering image) and short trading with that secret information as
insurance to be leveraged at the right time.


Jim Rogers is a living legend and if you watch a video with him you will see why. He is a smart, nice man. He
is anything but a crook him himself. I don't think the FAB team are fraudsters, but the merger and presentation
of the Chinese operations may have been poorly managed from a compliance point of view, given how small
the company is.

I do think the writer is right, I am chinese I can't see any FAB's kiosks around me in China, and one of their

Hill3,


China is a big place. :) But if you have not seen any kiosks, there are probably no newer kiosks around you. I
have talked to several Chinese who have used the kiosks. They are popular with the under 25 crowd wanting
to share the social experience of media.


18 Dec 2013, 08:23 AM


SurprisedGuy
One point that Alfred Little and Geoinvesting would have us believe is that Beijing Huzhong Culture Co. is
"under the control" of FAB's Chairman.


While the prospectus translation from Geoinvesting that we get in their FAB bond article states this FAB
control by teh FAB Chairman (correctly or incorrectly?), the same article states that Huzhong is owned 100%
by two other named Chinese persons, one with 80% and one with 20%. That leaves 0% ownership possible
for FAB's Chairman. So the translation of the Chinese and what is meant by under control will be important in
getting to the bottom of this issue. If the business is not owned by the FAB Chairman, how can it be under his
control? Perhaps some one here can clarify this to me. Clearly, by all disclosures, Huzhong works closely with
FAB in the servicing of media kiosks.


I agree with Lucky's assessment of the cash situation as being of paramount importance. If the cash reported
by FAB is there, and is confirmed by the independent reviewer, then I would not want to be short when trading
starts after the independent review. There are ways for an independent reviewer... and the SEC... to reliably
verify cash in China.


Many of the attacks by the shorts on FAB have been against a business model of their own imagination, and
not what FAB has in place. That's why counting the kiosks is so important to the shorts and not to me, a real

investor in FAB. Do you really think that the shorts are motivated by altruism for investors?


To FAB's credit, as a legitimate champion of intellectual ownership and copyrights in China, FAB's business
model has been designed to navigate a transition period over which the Chinese culture is moving towards
the Western standards. If FAB can navigate this course successfully, considerable opportunity awaits. Maybe
in the future, they will be more like a Redbox, or an iTunes in a box, as the prospects of iTunes coming to
China anytime soon are not likely.

Author’s reply »  Cash in China is the least important factor. Cash is easily faked, as even the Big 4 auditors
have repeatedly encountered.


If you think Cash is verifiable, please tell us how? Short of actually withdrawing the cash and depositing it to
another bank, as NQ mobile did, bank balances mean nothing.


An even in the case of NQ, the cash could be offset by undisclosed debt. FAB investors now have a taste of
the undisclosed debt problem in China.


Ignore the cash. Focus on the business. Where are the media kiosks? I am shocked you don't seem to care.

A wise man once said "Know Thyself." I pride myself on knowing the limits of my knowledge. You seem to be

I don't think any of us here in this forum know how many kiosks that FAB has in Beijing. That said, you may
be right. I think that FAB has deployed the number of kiosks in Beijing that you keep tracking, but they may
not still be actively deployed.

17 Dec 2013, 09:29 PM

Hill3, the vast majority of those Kiosks were placed before the acquisition. Meaning there was no FU stock to promise
anyone, it didn't exist yet. 
Maybe 3 or 4K Kiosks have been sold since then, and none by FAB....sold by independent agents. 
FAB seems very confident at this point in the existence of all their cash. If an independent 3rd party verifies it then the
business is legit...simple as that. Shorts are afraid of the cash being legit, which is why they already trying to belittle
the verification process. Everything but the cash is just noise. My guess is this will not trade until the 3rd party review
is done, and that could take a month or two. Odds are the restatement and even the 4th quarter will be released by
then.

slimshady
isn't a restatement basically saying that a company gave wrong information and now it is going to give
different information? 
why would any company report "wrong" information (unless it does not know the actual information or does
not wish to disclose it)? 
can either be a desirable situation or are both problematic?  
how comforting is it if company "seems confident" that it has cash (it either has the asset or it doesn't)?  
or, how does any company not know about a bond offering and has to take steps to make sure it doesn't
happen again?

Author’s reply »  Lucky, see my comment above. I am not afraid of the "cash" at all, because it has no value
since it cannot be verified in China. Cash exists only in so far as FAB can prove how it was generated and
how it is being spent. So you first ask: Where are the media kiosks? Only if the business completely checks
out do you believe the cash printout from the bank teller.


Furthermore Cash in an account in China today is cash stolen tomorrow. It's the hardest asset to verify and
the easiest to steal. Ignore it when you evaluate Chinese companies.

Lucky,


Take a look at this quoted excerpt from the 12/20/13 Barron's article by Shuli Ren:


Canadian securities regulators announced fraud charges on Thursday against the head of a hedge fund
whose researchers’ arrests in China were the subject of a recent story in Barron’s (“The High Price of Digging
Up Dirt in China,” Sept. 30).


The British Columbia Securities Commission said that in 2011 Jon Carnes published falsely negative reports
about the Chinese mining operations of Silvercorp Metals (ticker: SVM), a company whose shares are listed
in Toronto and New York. Silvercorp had been sold short by EOS Holdings, the hedge fund that Carnes
managed. As Barron’s reported, Carnes disguised his authorship of the critical reports by using the
pseudonym Alfred Little."


We may see a similar outcome in this FAB situation...

As of 12/18/2013, Investor's Business Daily states the eps due date as being 03/18/2014 on FU's Stock Checkup
page. (I thought IBD stated the eps date as 03/24/2014 one day ago). Considering the last eps date was 11/13/13,
looks like we are going to be waiting a while to hear from the CEO. (Also waiting for the question/answer period on
the conference call, of course).

5/18/2018 FAB Universal Media Kiosks: A Fundamental Misunderstanding? - FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 13/18


Lucky?
Slim, for the most part accounting is not a science...it's a whole bunch of generally accepted principle that get debated
and changed all the time. Restatements for the most part are common, it's the reasons behind the restatements that
are important. Cramer's basic rule is if they restate...run. Many follow this and it is the safest play...whatever the
reason. My thinking is you want to make large sums of money you need to take risks. Those two companies who
keep bringing up were two of many I've traded in and out of over decades of trading. I traded both before the extent of
Chinese Fraud RTO's was known by anyone....I think CCME started it all. The discovery was a process that extended
over a year or so. First it was small RTO's, then Sino-Forest changed that game with Big 4 accountants and then it
changed again with Longtop and it's IPO, Big 4 accountants and another game changer, local banks colluding with
the company to fake cash. Clearly there are still frauds out there, but they are fewer and further between and harder
to catch (it's been nearly two years since AL hit one).  
As for FAB's bond, my believe is Zhang started the process before the acquisition pledging his wholly owned
company FAB Digital and the bldg he intended to buy with it as collateral (he owned them both so why not?).
Completely legit. Since he knew the acquisition may go through there was a provision for an additional guarantee of
his shares of FAB Universal, should the deal go through. So the bond gets approved after many months and after the
acquisition and Zhang decides to keep the money (guaranteed by his personal shares) for whatever business
purpose he wants. Since he was personally liable and not FAB Universal at this point it was his call. Then the shorts
break the news of the bond, and to them it was proof FAB was a scam all along (otherwise why do the bond with
supposedly 40M cash in the bank), so they short with impunity with their inside knowledge of the bond ahead of the
news (short interest jumps over 1M shares in a few weeks). When FAB Universal finds out about Zhang's bond what
do they do? Try to explain the story that "technically" they were not required to report anything since it was never their
cash and Zhang can do whatever he wants with his shares or just suck it up, collect the cash from the bond, restate,
and move on. I think it took them a long time (two weeks) and discussion with their accountants before deciding how
to play this. Initially I think they were going to run with the "technical" story, which is why Spencer released that article
denying all short allegations (including the bond). Only later did they decide restatement was the simplest way out of a
bad situation. In the end only Zhang knows the truth about FAB, and he just gave back 16M to the shareholders and
let the BOD back off a building he clearly wanted to buy and expand with. Much more will come out before this starts
trading again, that much you can be certain of.

Is this how you reasoned that China Valves should be bought before it lost 95% of its market value, or that
Syntax-Brillian should be bought before it went to 0 losing 100% of its market value?

I was hoping Alfred Little would include translated artifacts in this article to help us follow along as accurately
as possible. Instead he has repeated the untranslated copy of a sales brochure (may or may not be authentic)
presented from an earlier article. Is he that this marketing brochure is part of the licensing contract?

5/18/2018 FAB Universal Media Kiosks: A Fundamental Misunderstanding? - FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 14/18


I had to smile when I read the following lines from the article:


"The indisputable points from FAB's SEC filings regarding its kiosk business are:


FAB selects and maintains the locations. 
FAB builds out and installs the kiosks at the locations FAB selects. 
FAB, via Huzhong, supervises the kiosks in operation."


Indisputable according to him, I guess... :) Certainly, not me. I have just reviewed again the referred to FAB
Proxy language and the recent FAB PR statement.


The passage I have quoted above is his interpretation of how FAB does things, and he has taken poetic
license (no pun intended with "license") to present the situation fortuitously for his purposes.


However, it should be noted that the Proxy's language says that FAB Media is "responsible for" various
functions. The Proxy does not say that FAB Media will perform the functions.


Therefore there is nothing in the FAB Proxy that is inconsistent with the recent FAB Universal PR release:


"...run the kiosks through 40 individual registered agents who are responsible for signing up licensees,
deploying the kiosks, and reporting the number of installed kiosks."


While there are minor variations from the Proxy language, all variations are mostly filling in details and well
within the Proxy and its mandate to serve the shareholders. I gather these 40 agents are local to the 40 cities
that have active licensing of kiosks, but that's just my guess. And that's my own take...

Take a look at this Bloomberg link below about the alleged fraud by Alfred Little against Silvercorp, and
consider what this implies for this FU situation....

Lucky,


In addition read this paragraph on the Silvercorp situation... perhaps the short trading juggernaut is finally
collapsing under the attacks of its own fraud:


"To date the Independent Committee has sought the assistance of various regulatory and law enforcement
authorities including the British Columbia Securities Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Integrated Market Enforcement Team
("RCMP"). In addition to the BCSC, the SEC and RCMP have opened files and are carrying out their own
investigation into this apparent fraud AGAINST the Company, through the manipulation of its market."

SurprisedGuy, 
Yea, I kind of noticed that 40 coincidence. They probably have protected territory. It's funny how AL with all his
skepticism about China and believing only what can be verified 10 times over when it comes to FAB, takes Wang at
her word solely because she has a "business card" that states she works directly for FAB and she showed up at the
Joy City Store where I would love to see a pix of her office (bet it doesn't exist). Then he spends another 2
paragraphs stating why even if FAB verifies all the cash it's still meaningless. Maybe if FAB just handed him a
business card with the cash balances written on the back he'd believe them? 
My thinking is those bondholders gave Zhang a 16M loan based on the value of his Chinese business. Are they
suckers, too? If the Kiosks are all fake why on earth would they give him cash, that's fraud in China against
Chinese...doesn't that get you shot? FAB also lists two companies on their web site that pay 4M a year total to
advertise on the Kiosks. If the Kiosks are fake why pay that much money? Again, Chinese scamming Chinese does
not go over well in China. And if those two companies are fake why hasn't AL with his crack team of investigators
posted proof yet? 
My thoughts are FAB is still working on populating a list of Kiosks locations, if they weren't they would have come out
with a statement just admitting their mistakes/exaggerations... they did with the bond. There is much to play out here
before it starts trading again, but the shorts are loaded up and stuck at the moment so I expect at least a few more
shots before this is over. 
And slim, I changed my mind about CVVT long before it was delisted and listed my reasons on the various message
boards. As for BRLX, I visited many stores through out Asia and their products were displayed and sold briskly
according to salespeople I talked to. To this day I have no idea why they changed from a legit business model into
straight up thieves.

While you may zing the CEO of Fab Universal and achieve your goals, I really think it is irresponsible of you to sling
around judgments at this juncture based on your limited understanding of the grand scheme of things . Surely, you
can understand Chris' need to vet information sources and what is what.


However, Chris reacted, whether good or bad, I don't think it was "reckless."

"Wang Lirong's FAB business card shows she is an employee of FAB, with the title Director of Franchisee Sales,
working out of the FAB sales office in the Joy City building in Beijing."


Let's just run this logic out.....


Wang has stated she is the Director of Franchisee sales for Beijing, has a business card and met you at the Joy City
store to "prove" it, yet can't give the location of a single Kiosk in all of Beijing?


Therefore, according to you, FAB is a fraud with further proof being no one will meet with you to view Wang's
business card.


On the other side of the aisle, FAB has stated they verified all the cash on their books, and is arranging an
independent third party to verify it.


Since cash can easily be faked but not business cards, clearly FAB is fraud?


Flawless logic. I can see why you have such a loyal following.


On the surface it looks like FAB is going to be halted until at least the restatments are in, and possibly until the 3rd
party review is finished. My hope is it's until the 3rd party review is in...even if it takes a few months.


28 Dec 2013, 02:59 AM


SurprisedGuy
Lucky,


I think you are right about the halt till the independent results are in. That's my preference too. This would be
in line with what i have recently read about how the markets use extended halts to clarify ambiguous
situations.


I know A*L (Carnes) is busy preparing his defense for his upcoming 2/4/14 Silvercorp fraud hearing in British
Columbia (BC). Since the SEC is involved there with supportive research, I think we can assume that subject
to the findings of the BC hearing that similar accusations may be forthcoming stateside as well for Silvercorp
and other episodes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1902391-fab-universal-media-kiosks-a-fundamental-misunderstanding 17/18


As far as Carnes' fundamental misunderstanding, it's clear that A*L is by outward appearances not a great
analyst, though he is clearly a shrewd, albeit quasi-legal, trader. As for his question on where the Beijing
kiosks are, if he read over the fabuniversal.com website and searched Fab Enterprise Group well, he would
have his answer clear enough, though with no addresses. The answer is there to be found...


This just goes to show that a large part of Carnes' game is intentionally letting outward rhetoric eclipse
outward presentation of the truth.


As a FU investor, I feel good with the way things are proceeding... no one has resigned yet... and Fab
Universal is obligated to announce to NYSE within 4 days any material resignations. The time for resignations
has come and gone, barring any surprises in the independent review.


I'm ready for the results of the independent review, the restatement of second and third quarter earnings, and
the statement Quarter 4 earnings.


If you look at http://www.fab.com.cn , you can see that that Fab is more vital than ever and things should
really be clicking on all cylinders starting within a month or so... I think 2014 will be a breakout year, not a
breakdown year... :)

my name is johnny ! i am writting this comment in china! there is one thing that I know for sure about FAB Universal
Corp. They are indeed bunch of frauds !!!!You want to know the answer of the question below: 3,954 Beijing Media
Kiosks: No More and No Less? Let me tell you the truth ! truth is before 2013,April FAB Universal only have 256
Media Kiosks in China. as for now the number of media kiosks are indeed increased , but please note that most of the
machines does not belong to FAB . The ways they operates in China are very tricky & dirty. FAB owns more than 80
empty shell companies! On surface they seems clean and unrelated , but in fact they are all can link to FAB's
Chairman Zhang Hong Cheng.

Hotfuzay,


Excuse my skepticism that A) You are Chinese and are in China; B) You know very much about the business
model of FAB; and C) That you know any more than I do how many kiosks are in China.


I see a lot of adjectives in your post but little evidence.


I think you are another short trader going through deceptions.


I invite you to prove me wrong and elaborate on your first post.

AL,


To use your own word "indisputable" from this FAB article, the British Columbia Securities Commission has you
seemingly under an indisputable and airtight set of fraud allegations, as listed in the SVM hearing request:


http://bit.ly/1cbdRpm


The playing field has changed. I don't think your investment disclaimer will help much, given your provable SVM
fraudulent behavior. I think the ramifications of this Canadian case go far beyond SVM and call for a full revaluation of
FU by traders and regulators.


AL, you seem nice enough but hubris seems your undoing... along with a wild inclination to exaggerate and write
overly persuasive language.


As well, I trust the SA editors understand SA's exposure to aligning with short traders.
