Massive Insider Deal Threatens Erickson Air-Crane
Jun. 13, 2013 9:36 AM ET31 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Not long ago, ZM Funds was in a serious pickle. It was the largest holder of $120 million in
second lien debt from a deeply distressed helicopter operator called Evergreen Helicopter.
Evergreen has received a going concern letter from its auditor. It was in default on its debt.
It was not even paying its accounts payable to such an extent that suppliers began
withholding parts and Evergreen was unable to maintain its aircraft. At present, only 50%
of its aircraft are even being used and the company is the defendant in multiple lawsuits
and legal proceedings with its creditors, suppliers and customers demanding immediate
payment. But in fact, the situation was set to get far worse for struggling Evergreen, given
that over 60% of its revenues come from DOD contracts in Afghanistan. The US has
already announced that the pullout from Afghanistan is set to accelerate and troop levels
will be further reduced by 50% in the next year.


In short, it was clear that ZM would not get repaid on this very large subordinated and
distressed debt holding.


Fortunately for ZM Funds, an elegant solution was found. ZM is the controlling
shareholder of Erickson Air-Crane (NASDAQ:EAC) and holds two board seats. Following
its recent equity offering, Erickson has a market cap of around $350 million. ZM simply
had Erickson, the company that it controls, borrow $400 million in debt and a $100 million
credit facility to buy the crippled and indebted Evergreen. Prior to the borrowing, Erickson
was down to just $1 million in cash and already had $100 million in debt, so this
represents a very substantial levering-up.


In exchange for its deeply distressed debt of Evergreen, ZM received millions of shares of
Erickson, which had been rising strongly. As we will see below, as soon as the
questionable acquisition was completed, ZM quickly began liquidating its shares in
Erickson and has just filed to sell 100% of its entire stake in Erickson.


Apparently this is all fine and legal, simply because Erickson had disclosed that it is
controlled by ZM. It notes that ZM may take certain actions and approve certain
transactions which are not in the interests of other shareholders and which other
shareholders would not approve. That is certainly putting it mildly.

That acquisition of Evergreen took place just a few weeks ago. The company has put a
positive spin on the deal, noting that it will increase revenues, along with "adjusted
EBITDA."


Despite the enthusiasm and urgency of Erickson and ZM, the transaction is far from
intuitive. In fact, it makes no sense whatsoever. Rather than help Erickson, this acquisition
is more likely to sink the entire ship for Erickson.


Portland-based Erickson has traditionally derived the majority of its revenues from
firefighting and timber operations in North America, not far flung Afghanistan. With respect
to the distressed Evergreen acquisition, Erickson disclosed the following:


- lack of experience in these business segments


- lack of experience with these types of aircraft


- lack of experience in these geographic regions (Middle East, South America and Africa)


- NO experience with Department of Defense customers and projects


For obvious reasons, ZM is clearly eager to get out of its holdings of this now debt-
saddled company as fast as possible. As soon as it was completed, ZM quickly sold
millions in stock. And now, two days ago, a massive S3 registration statement was filed in
which ZM will sell 100% of its remaining shares even as the ink on the deal is still drying.
The S3 notes that after the offering, ZM will hold zero shares. In addition, Erickson will be
offering 4 million new shares.


Astute investors will note that the 9 million plus shares in the S3 filing equates to 100% of
the company's current outstanding share count!


It also equates to over 45 days trading volume. Based on the sheer enormity of this
offering, the share price should be expected to automatically correct by at least 50% to
around $13.00.


After that, the share price will be a function of how well the debt saddled company can
turn around the struggling Afghan helicopter operations of the deeply distressed
Evergreen. Unless a drastic turnaround can be made with struggling Evergreen and its
Afghan operations, Erickson should easily see the single digits very soon. But by that
time, ZM will already be long gone.

Despite these troubling facts, shares sold short represents just 2% of shares outstanding
and only 1.5 days trading volume. Large short interest can often support a stock on the
way down, preventing it from falling as shorts become buyers. But with Erickson, this is
clearly not the case.


This could turn out to be a genius trade of epic proportions for ZM. First, it gets its very
distressed debt repaid in full. But even better, its repayment came in the form of deeply
discounted shares which it now sells at a price which is a triple at current prices. Even if it
gets out at $13.00, ZM's trade will represent a spectacular homerun.


Aside from ZM Funds, the stock has few major mutual fund holders. Only two mutual
funds own more than 1% of the company. Aside from ZM there are only two 5% holders.
As a result, this abusive transaction has gone largely unnoticed. But with the majority
owner planning on selling 100% of its shares, and with Erickson now saddled by debt and
maintenance requirements of a huge distressed acquisition, it is hard to see how these
smaller funds will wait around to be left holding the bag as ZM sells. It is also hard to see
how anyone else will buy shares of Erickson as ZM liquidates in the face of the massive
acquisition.


Looking further back, Erickson Air-Crane came public just over 1 year ago in a very
difficult IPO. At the time, the Oregon company had historically been engaged primarily in
providing helicopter services for firefighting and to the timber industry in North America.
After being repeatedly delayed for 2 years, the IPO had originally been slated to be priced
at $14.00, but weak demand caused the offering price to be cut and the size to be
reduced.


The company ended up coming public at $8.00, 43% below expectations. The share price
then quickly traded down to as low as $5.35, another 33% below the lowered IPO price.


Even home-team Oregon newspapers were not kind to the company's prospects, stating


Erickson isn't gearing up for rapid growth, however. It's a 40-year-old business just
trying to pay down $130 million in debt.


Erickson had been positioning itself for an IPO for nearly two years and repeatedly
failed to find buyers for its stock.


So earlier this month, it resorted to cutting its share price and reducing the number
of shares offered. "

The debt being paid down was actually being held by Erickson's ZM private equity fund. In
addition, ZM had been hoping to liquidate shares. Getting this deal done was therefore
even more crucial for ZM.


As a result it was reported that:


Discounted shares were evidently still insufficient to attract investors. So Erickson's
owner, the investment firm ZM Private Equity, stepped in and agreed to buy at
least 750,000 of the IPO stock itself, and perhaps as many as 1.25 million shares.


ZM, which is also an Erickson creditor, had planned to reduce its stake in Erickson
to around 50 percent through the IPO. If it buys the full 1.25 million shares, it will
retain a 63 percent interest in Erickson.


ZM ended up having to purchase 1.05 million shares (one quarter of the IPO) in order to
keep the IPO from failing and get its debt holdings repaid.


Now, with the acquisition of Evergreen, Erickson has levered up massively. Once again,
the reason is so that it can bail out ZM Funds from another distressed debt holding.


Yet the market has clearly missed these important nuances. Since those $5.00 lows, the
stock has been a rocket ship and is now closing in on $30.00. Including the effect of its
recently issued shares, the company now sports a market cap of nearly $350 million.


The reason for the rise is that the stock benefited greatly from a strong fire season in late
2012. As a result, the company actually turned a meaningful profit in one quarter out of the
past five. The result of this single strong quarter is that Erickson posted a positive net
income for full year FY 2012.

Erickson has always preferred to avoid any focus on its negative EPS and instead touts its
strong "adjusted EBITDA." And yet even this has received an artificial boost. The
company recently changed its methodology for calculating EBITDA, resulting in an
immediate boost of 30% without any change in the business. Investors in the stock have
largely ignored the fact that the company continues to lose money and was down to just
$1.3 million in cash at the end of Q1.


It should be viewed as intuitive that Erickson's non-GAAP "adjusted EBITDA" numbers will
give optimistic results. When a debt laden and capital intensive company simply ignores
all of its depreciation, interest and taxes, the strained results are naturally going to be
seen as just fine.


In mortgaging the farm to make these purchases, Erickson may have just committed a
colossal blunder which solely benefits its controlling shareholder and board member.


The situation at Evergreen is indeed very, very bad. Evergreen's situation was specifically
described as "distressed" in the recent 8K filing. It was unable to make good on its
payables, to the extent that its suppliers were withholding parts. It is noted that Evergreen


has been unable to adequately maintain certain of its aircraft


It has also been disclosed that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1499562-massive-insider-deal-threatens-erickson-air-crane 6/16


a number of EHI's aircraft are not air-worthy, causing dissatisfaction among certain
of its customers


At the end of 2012, target Evergreen was down to just $174,000 in cash. Only 50% of its
aircraft were even being utilized. The company is now subject to lawsuits and legal
proceedings from its suppliers, customers and creditors who are demanding immediate
payment.


Despite the deep financial distress, Evergreen does continue to generate substantial
revenue of nearly $200 million. It's just that these revenues do not translate into any ability
to generate a meaningful profit or accumulate cash to pay its massive debts or its
suppliers.


Erickson is also in the process of completing second acquisition, which is also with a
somewhat related party. Air Amazonia is the helicopter subsidiary of one of Erickson's
former customers in Brazil. The acquisition is set to close in Q3 for a price of $65-75
million, yet the company has just 14 aircraft. Like Evergreen, the aircraft utilization sits at
just 50%.


With both targets only showing 50% utilization, Erickson has communicated the view that
the glass is half full rather than half empty. With such low utilization, it hopes that there will
be room for improvement. Again, this is a substantial understatement. Yet the company
has clearly paid a tremendous price for two companies which are sitting at half idle. In
addition, Erickson's Central Point Oregon manufacturing facility also sits at just 50% of
capacity.


Conclusion


With few major holders and very limited research coverage, the rise in Erickson has gone
largely unnoticed. The massive related party acquisition of the distressed Evergreen has
also gone largely without any analysis by either longs or shorts.


Given that Erickson lacks any relevant experience in acquiring such a company, and given
that the Afghan pullout will greatly curtail its revenues, it appears that the only real
purpose of the Evergreen deal was to bail ZM Funds out of a 100% loss on a very large
position in the $120 million second lien debt. With ZM firmly in control of the votes and the
board at Erickson, this was an easy transaction to push through.


Now that this has been done, Erickson is saddled with half a billion in debt and is stuck
with a deeply distressed target to manage in a far flung corner of the world.

Comments (31)


Although Erickson has made positive statements about the acquisition and the use of
"adjusted EBITDA," it is clear that interest alone on the massive debt will preclude a profit
for years to come. In the meantime, Evergreen's fortunes are tied to Afghanistan.


It is not surprising that ZM is now selling 100% of its holdings in Erickson. Even if it
continues to sell at prices which are 50% below the current level, ZM will lock in a
tremendous gain and will have recovered all of its exposure to Evergreen's deeply
distressed debt.


The only thing that remains to be seen is if the many smaller holders of Erickson will wait
to be left holding the bag as ZM sells.

Author’s reply »  The newspaper articles were to describe the sentiment towards the IPO, which I had thought was
quite clear. As a result, of course they were written at the time of the IPO.


The LEGIT numbers are actually non GAAP, "adjusted EBITDA" numbers which ignore the massive interest payments
and growing depreciation. In addition, the company changed their calculation methodology to boost this metric by
30% even though there was no change in the business.


The much bigger question is: why would you be buying when ZM is selling ?

ZM isnt selling though. Read the sec filing.


"We may sell from time to time up to 4,000,000 shares" Key word may.


I agree with Superman: "Equity funds rolling up businesses they own is very common….as is founding equity
taking some off table at some point"


"Also, a shelf filing means they can sell some or all did not mean they did"


13 Jun 2013, 03:15 PM


Rope a Dope
Robert, the use of the word ‘may’ should be of secondary concern. If ZM was not considering a sale of ANY
stock there would be no need to file the registration with the SEC. If ZM was only considering a sale of 1
million, 2 million, or 3 million shares, they could have limited the scope in the S-3 and thereby limited the
damage to the stock price for the shares they would retain. This S-3 filing was a warning, regardless of the
wording, that introduced additional risk to shareholders.


Richard, excellent article. I bought EAC a few months ago at $12 and sold at $18 because I could not justify a
continued price increase based on fundamentals. Unlike deadjim, to me fundamentals are everything in the
long run.

I don't know what the hell is going on, I bought this stock about 2 weeks ago, and now down $6 a share from my
purchase price. Cramer had the CEO on about 3 weeks ago, i did (what i thought was my due diligence), and after
consideration, bought some shares. Nowhere in the interview did the CEO bring up ZM or the shenanigans going on. I
would love to see a class action suit over this, plain manipulation in my opinion. Nice background check Cramer.


Personally I believe companies pay CNBC to get their voices heard on Cramer's show, especially newer companies I
am not a true believer in Cramer, but, he does do a good job of entertaining. I am the idiot out at least 2 k on this deal.

One must be very careful when reading an article written by someone who has a long or short position in the stock, as
it will obviously be biased.


This article makes many statements that could be misleading if not understood in context . One example is the
following statement: "For obvious reasons, ZM is clearly eager to get out of its holdings of this now debt-saddled
company as fast as possible. As soon as it was completed, ZM quickly sold millions in stock."


In this article, every reference to a purchase or sale of stock is done in terms of number of shares ... except this
reference. Thus, one could easily read that sentence and believe it meant "ZM sold millions [of shares] in stock." In
reality, the author meant "ZM sold millions [of dollars] in stock." There is a big difference. Yes, ZM sold 250,000
shares between 5/16 and 5/30, which netted several million dollars. However, that was only 5% of their position, and
they still hold 4.65MM shares. I think we can all agree that selling 5% of a position does not equate to a desperate

liquidation like the author implies. If ZM was truly "eager to get out of its holdings of this now debt-saddled company
as fast as possible", ZM would have sold more than 5% of its holdings and the sales would not have stopped on 5/30.

If one has no position or interest on a stock, why he is willing to spend time to write an article.


There is nothing wrong for an author to write an article to show why he is long or short.


That is not price manipulation.


Price manipulation happens when big players try to move a stock against its fundamentals or make fake
stories or rumors etc on a stock in order to make a profit.

Erickson is a leading global provider of aviation services to commercial and government customers. On June
13, 2013, a report was published on SeekingAlpha.com asserting that ZM Funds, the controlling shareholder
of Erickson, orchestrated the recent purchase of Evergreen Helicopters, a struggling helicopter operator. This
effectively allowed ZM Funds to exchange approximately $120 million in distressed debt of Evergreen
Helicopters for millions of more valuable shares of Erickson. A recent filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission by Erickson indicates that ZM Funds intends to sell all of its remaining shares in
Erickson. The investigation relates to whether Erickson’s Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection
with the acquisition of Evergreen Helicopters.

comments on the acquisitions as I had this stock a few months ago and had done some research on it.


EAC purchased Air Amazonia (AA) from HRT, a Brazilian oil and gas exploration company. There were a lot
of comments made that pinned hope on increasing earnings as AA’s fleet saw only 50% utilization, but that
number is at 50% for a reason. HRT has not been very successful at finding oil in the Amazon Basin and this
was putting pressure on the company financially, thus the need to sell AA. HRT’s stock price lost about 20%
of its value over the last few months because they were not finding oil. Brazil’s economy is weakening and
even oil industry leaders like PBR are struggling right now. I wouldn’t count on any significant expansion by
HRT that would increase utilization of AA’s fleet. EAC (through AA) would need to find additional contract
sources in order to increase utilization rates and this may prove to be quite difficult given the declining
economic environment in Brazil. And one additional comment about Brazil; the government controls prices of
finished petroleum products (gasoline, etc) and forces companies to keep prices low to help alleviate poverty
in the country. Although price controls help the poor, it is suppressing oil and gas investment projects all
across the country. Many of Brazil’s largest oil companies are having extreme difficulty finding funding to
continue with oil and gas exploration and are being forced to sell assets or turn to foreign firms for investment
resources. The Brazilian government is suppressing the entire industry and this is unlikely to change in the
near future. I think AA will be fortunate if they can maintain current utilization rates let alone hope for
expansion.


Evergreen Helicopters – S&P had EHI on a ‘Credit Watch’ list prior to EAC acquiring the company. Much of
EHI’s income was derived from its Afghanistan operations which must not have been too successful if EHI
was struggling to pay its bills. I’ve read that AFG rotary contracts will almost double this year, but I have
serious doubts that will happen given recent the sequestration cuts that included the Pentagon. I left
Afghanistan 2 years ago and saw projects being scaled back then. Given the current troop drawdowns along
with civilian contractor support operations, I can’t see anything but a decline in AFG support contracts.


Finally EAC itself; part of its business included firefighting, timber harvesting, and servicing the oil and gas
industry. There are a few other business segments but I see no serious challenges to those at this time. But
with recent setbacks in the US economy, I think there is a greater chance of a decline in earnings rather than
an increase with regards to timber harvesting and the oil and gas sector. Damper spring weather across much
of the western US should also put a damper on earnings from firefighting efforts, at least in Q2 2013. Q3
earnings from firefighting should increase (YoY) with an expected increase in fire activity this year, but I would
not expect an increase in earnings from those operations until Q3. There appear to be more headwinds than
tailwinds for EAC segments at this time.

I'm sure everyone is looking forward to reading it.


What has been refreshing about the comments to this article, for the most part, is that there is obviously some serious
disagreement and strong feelings, but despite that the comments have focused on adding information and raising
issues and not on personal attacks.

Full Disclosure: I am not short EAC. In fact, I was long EAC until I got stopped out. There is an old saying that
everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts. I believe I will save my opinion until after the dust
settles from all the lawyers that are swarming. I can assure you this is far from over.


Wohl & Fruchter LLP Announces Investigation of Potential Breaches of Fiduciary Duty by the Board and the
Controlling Shareholder of Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated 
--headline from Press Release


We are investigating the board of directors (Board) and the controlling shareholder of Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated
(Erickson) (NASDAQ: EAC) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in connection with
Erickson’s recent acquisition of Evergreen Helicopters, Inc. (Evergreen).


As of December 31, 2012, a group of affiliated private equity funds, referred to collectively as the ZM Funds, held
approximately 50% of the $119.2 million in second lien debt owed by Evergreen.


Prior to its acquisition by Erickson, Evergreen was in severe financial distress. Among other things, Evergreen’s
suppliers were withholding parts due to unpaid bills, and Evergreen was unable to maintain its aircraft. Evergreen’s
auditor also expressed substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Further, a
significant percentage of Evergreen’s revenues came from Department of Defense contracts in Afghanistan, and in
February 2013, President Obama announced that half of US forces in Afghanistan would withdraw by early 2014. As
a result of the foregoing, repayment of the substantial second lien debt owed by Evergreen to ZM Funds was highly
improbable.


ZM Funds also held approximately 60% of the stock of Erickson. Two managers of ZM Funds, Quinn Morgan and
Kenneth Lau, sit on the Erickson Board.


On March 20, 2013, Erickson announced that it had agreed to acquire Evergreen for a total consideration of $250
million, including $185 million in cash, and 4,008,439 shares of a new class of preferred stock worth $11.85/share and
convertible into Erickson common stock on a one-for-one basis. Approximately 85% of the preferred stock was issued
to ZM Funds in exchange for retirement of the outstanding second lien debt owed to ZM Funds by Evergreen.


To finance the cash portion of the acquisition, Erickson issued $400 million in notes. Prior to the issuance of the notes,
Erickson already had approximately $107.9 million in long term debt outstanding.


In connection with the Evergreen acquisition, entities affiliated with Quinn Morgan earned a fee of $2.5 million for
“services rendered.”


On May 9, 2013, in its Form 10-Q, Erickson highlighted numerous risk factors associated with its acquisition of
Evergreen, including its lack of experience operating in Evergreen’s business and geographic segments, and

operating the types of aircraft acquired from Evergreen.


On June 10, 2013, Erickson announced a stock offering pursuant to which ZM Funds planned to sell 100% of its
remaining Erickson stock, thus leaving it with zero shares after consummation of the offering.


Since the announcement of the stock offering, EAC shares have declined 25% from a close of $26.73/share on June
10, 2013, to $20.05/share as of the close on June 13, 2013.


Our investigation concerns, among other things, whether the acquisition of Evergreen constituted a breach of fiduciary
duty by the Erickson Board and ZM Funds due to self-dealing by ZM Funds in connection with the transaction.


Persons with relevant information, and EAC shareholders with questions about this investigation, are invited to
contact the attorney below, or our Firm by calling 866.582.8140.

Oh, an attorney ad. How lovely.

My comment was intended to provide additional information with respect to the increasing efforts on the part
of attorneys in finding investors interested in joining class action lawsuits. I was a shareholder of EAC until the
rapid decline of its share price triggered stop loss orders and I am undergoing due diligence investigations
regarding causality.


Your comment was pointless, sarcastic, and added absolutely nothing. What is your motivation? If you can
defy gravity as you claim to then please fly home. There are grown-ups here and we are trying to learn.

Sorry--


Probably an inappropriate comment on my part. Wasn't intended to be directed at you. I'm an attorney and I
just have a thing against attorneys that advertise.

Do you work for Wohl & Fruchter LLP? or Do you work for Department of Defense?


I don't see any logic in above statements.


Thank you.

Marmadukemark
No, neither. I would have disclosed it. I live in a little college town in mid-Missouri and I don't work for
anybody. I think full disclosure is needed. That's why I began my comment the way I began it: Full disclosure.


The text you pulled from my comment does seem to be a bit of a nonsequitur. It was copied verbatim from
Wohl & Fruchter LLP's web site. You would have to contact them about the statement, but from what I
understand Evergreen Helicopters have been widely used in the military for years; in fact, their Sikorsky S-61,
was known in Southeast Asia as the H-3 "Jolly Green Giant."


Fast forward to Afghanistan, over the years the department of defense awarded contracts to Evergreen that
amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The Defense Industry Daily announced one of the contracts
(below).


"Apr 3/09: Evergreen Helicopters, Inc., of McMinnville, OR received a $158.4 million indefinite-delivery/
indefinite-quantity contract for helicopters, personnel, equipment, tools, material, maintenance and
supervision necessary to perform passenger and cargo air transportation services in Afghanistan. Work is
expected to start April 3/09, and run until Nov 30/13 . . . "


If you take this, in light of the information provided in paragraph four of Rope a Dope's excellent comment, the
assumption could be made that, because of the military draw down in Afghanistan, Evergreen Helicopters
were decreasingly needed by one their biggest contractors, putting into question the firm's future.


In fact, I'm surprised you didn't ask Rope a Dope about his information with respect to the connection
between Evergreen, Afghanistan, and the military. Rope a Dope seems to know a lot more about it than I do.


And TimeOnTarget, I am the one who needs to apologize. I took it as a possible flame throw, but it wasn't . . .
and I regret it. June 15 was quite a day. Thank you for understanding.

I can expand a little on what I know about the AFG operations, but probably not too much.

The troop drawdown has already begun and should be complete by the end of 2014 with actual remaining
levels to be decided along the way. There were at least 5 or 6 firms (maybe more) like EHI supporting both
civilian and military efforts there and it is important to note that they also supported the civilian effort as well.
And believe it or not there were probably 80 civilians in AFG for every 100 ISAF service members. With US
forces supposedly under 10,000 by the end of 2014, there may only be 5,000 civilians remaining as well.


So you go from the need to support roughly 300,000 people down to roughly 15,000. It doesn’t take much to
imagine support services like those offered by EHI should decline. I would expect the number of firms
receiving contracts to decline as there will not be enough work to support all the firms that are there now. If
EHI is fortunate enough to get a new contract, no doubt it will be for a much smaller amount of money,
assuming the Pentagon decides to spend our tax dollars wisely.


I should also note that the forces will pull back to 5 existing, well established bases.
