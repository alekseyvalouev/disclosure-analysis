Mellanox: End Of Romley Upgrade Signals Steep Downside
Sep. 10, 2012 8:30 AM ET29 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We believe that shares of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) are highly
overvalued, not only because it is a semiconductor company operating in a small and
technologically fast-changing niche trading at an absurdly high valuation, but, equally as
important, the Intel CPU chip upgrade cycle which fueled its past few quarters of atypical
growth is about to plateau, and then sharply decline.


Investors apparently misunderstand the cyclical nature of Mellanox's 56 GB/s "FDR"
Infiniband business and have mistakenly extrapolated the recent uptick in Q1/Q2 growth
into a long-term trend. As the upgrade cycle for Intel's Romley CPU plays out, Mellanox's
FDR revenue could plateau in Q4 2012 and sharply reverse in 2013. When this occurs,
the 50%+ quarter-over-quarter growth that investors have come to expect will be a thing of
the past. As Mellanox's lead product (54% of Q2 2012 revenue), FDR has been tailored
specially for the Romley CPU system, meaning that FDR revenues probably tie very
closely to Romley CPU shipments. Using this assumption and FDR revenue estimates, we
estimate that quarter-on-quarter growth of the base business, excluding FDR-related
revenue, was only 0.7% in Q2 2012. Non-existent growth in the core business hardly
justifies the 50% share price bounce (from $65 to $95) that Mellanox experienced after its
second quarter earnings release, let alone the further increase to $110 in the past two
months.


Unfortunately for most investors, the cyclical nature of the tech hardware business is
rarely modeled by analysts, who prefer straight-line forecasts and sky-high, AMZN-like
valuation multiples for whichever business is in vogue at the time. But while they lavish
Mellanox with unbounded praise in their qualitative analysis, most analysts have actually
modeled a material growth slowdown in 2013. As such, we believe that investors in MLNX
are currently playing with fire and would be wise to avoid shares at the current
astronomical valuation level.


As for the notion that MLNX may be acquired, we may explain in future articles that the
idea of an acquisition is preposterous at prices anywhere close to the current trading
levels. A scan of the tech landscape tells us that of the few strategic buyers that might
exist, most couldn't afford MLNX's current valuation (such as ELX, QLGC, HPQ). Those
that can would prefer higher-margin branded products and services (ORCL and IBM), or
have already made their Infiniband investments (NASDAQ:INTC). Others would likely

allocate internal resources to create a next-generation rival product instead of overpaying
for a risky acquisition (NASDAQ:BCOM). Since Infiniband remains a small niche market
confined to high-end supercomputing, no rational buyer would consider acquiring MLNX
for a $5+ billion valuation, in our opinion.


Notwithstanding its current share price bubble, we believe that Mellanox has built itself a
niche business and achieved a big win through the Romley upgrade cycle. But high-speed
computing is a cutthroat space and Mellanox still faces competitive risks from all sides
(e.g. Intel's Infiniband and Cray interconnect, 40GB/s low-latency Ethernet, etc.). Since
high-tech hardware is such a cyclical, competitive space, almost all peer companies trade
below 10x Forward EV/EBITDA and many trade below 5x. Mellanox's 28x FY12E EBITDA
is in another stratosphere, and as frequently occurs in the tech space, we expect shares
to sharply snap back at the slightest earnings waver. Make no mistake about it: this is a
momentum-driven growth stock and its shares can only levitate at these prices while the
company delivers spectacular growth numbers. Even Mellanox can only defy gravity for so
long.


THE ROMLEY UPGRADE CYCLE HAS DRIVEN SHORT-TERM GROWTH


Mellanox provides premium Infiniband chips used in high-performance computer ("HPC")
clusters. Infiniband is a hardware interconnection tool that allows stacks of databases,
servers, and computers to 'talk' to one another. While most commercial servers are
perfectly content with 1G/s or 10G/s Ethernet interconnection, a small niche of specialized
HPC clusters prefer the higher speed and low latency of Infiniband, of which MLNX is the
leading supplier, and are willing to pay the higher prices associated with it. In particular,
Intel's Romley CPU core, which was released in 1Q 2012, included Mellanox's products
as among its preferred interconnection tools; therefore, as has been the case over the last
few quarters, each time that an HPC cluster upgrades to the Romley core, many will
purchase the FDR interconnectors as well.


We believe that investors do not fully appreciate the cyclicality of Mellanox's business.
Intel's supercomputer processing units, the industry standard, undergo predictable product
cycles. Sales will ramp for three to four quarters before plateauing for a quarter or two.
CPU motherboard sales then fall sharply ahead of a new product launch since customers
won't pay top-dollar for soon-to-be outdated technology. Because Mellanox's FDR
Infiniband chips are usually purchased alongside high-end CPUs, Mellanox's sales cycle
should track closely to the Romley cycle. In fact, since much of Mellanox's FDR customers
represent the highest-end of the supercomputing market, we would actually expect the
FDR cycle to have a shorter duration than the overall Romley cycle.

This is because those willing to pay the extra costs for FDR over Ethernet were probably
also the first in line for the upgrade in Q1 and Q2 2012. Therefore, we expect that
Mellanox's temporary Romley-related uplift will be gone by Q4 2012 or Q1 2013,
potentially eliminating up to half of Mellanox's revenue in the quarters ahead of the
next server CPU launch. Since most analysts have merely assumed straight-line quarter-
over-quarter growth, we believe that Mellanox could materially miss estimates during Q4
2012 or FY 2013 earnings reports.


Below is a chart of Intel's Romley server upgrade trajectory, as compared with historical
high-end HPC server cycles.


As we can see, the Romley server ramp will probably plateau within the next few quarters.
Then Romley purchases should plummet.


The most recent 10Q discloses FDR-related and non-FDR-related revenue in Q1 2012
and Q2 2012. Growth in non-FDR related revenue was essentially flat in Q2 2012
compared to Q1. As previously discussed, a majority of FDR revenue is tied to the Romley
CPU system.

Deutsche Bank acknowledges the impact of the Romley release by stating, "Anticipation
of the Romley release led to some pent-up demand for Mellanox's products, which at least
partly explains the 111% YoY increase in revenues in Q2 2012" (DB September 4th, 2012
Research Report). Even more worryingly for Mellanox, Intel has indicated that Romley
uptake may have spiked more quickly than previous cycles. INTC stated that "one month
after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in
its ramp" (Q1 2012 Earnings Call).


The chart below shows revenue estimates using Wall Street consensus. We've also
overlaid grey circles to represent how we expect the Romley product cycle to play out.
Notice that analysts only have a 3% slowdown forecasted for Q1 2013. Compare that to
the expected Romley product cycle in our graph above and you have the recipe for a big
earnings miss.


Sources: CapitalIQ, Bloomberg, Company filings 
(1) The number of available estimates for Q1 2013 and onwards decreased from twelve to
nine.


Despite their flourishing compliments and extraordinary target prices, Wall Street analysts
generally agree that the recent uptick in revenue growth cannot be sustained. Analysts
expect MLNX to revert to single-digit top-line growth by Q4 2012. This type of growth
profile hardly justifies Mellanox's current 9.0x 2012E revenue (26.7x EBITDA) valuation
multiple. For comparative purposes, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has a 6.3x 2012E revenue
multiple, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is about 3.5x, and Broadcom is 2.4x.

Tellingly, Mellanox management only offers guidance for one quarter out (Q3 revenue
guidance of $150-$155m). Perhaps this is because they don't want to alert the Street to a
potential contraction as the Romley cycle ebbs. Here is an excerpt from the Q2 2012
Earnings Call:


<Equity Analyst>: "As we think about our models for December then, the December
quarter, should we think in terms of there having been a lot of one-time business in
the September quarter or should we think about growth again sequentially in the
December quarter?"


<Eyal Waldman, Mellanox CEO>: "Sure. So, we can't give you any guidance for the
December quarter."


It's unusual for companies to provide guidance only one quarter ahead, and comments
such as this indicate that management is in no hurry to open the kimono.


VERY FEW BUSINESSES ACTUALLY REQUIRE 56 GB/S SPEED


When it comes to purchasing CPU server processors, IT purchasing managers are
practical. The vast majority of corporations are more than satisfied with less-costly 10GB/s
Ethernet. Plenty of data centers even run at speeds of 1GB/s without any disruptions.


As such, the type of customer that is willing to spend hundreds of thousands, or even
millions, of dollars to upgrade their server clusters every 2-3 years is few and far between.
The high-end of the supercomputing market might include high-frequency trading, military
applications, cutting edge physics and some web 2.0 / cloud computing companies, but
most clusters don't need ultra-fast low-latency performance. While we acknowledge that
the overall high-performance computing market is expanding (7.5%/year according to the
HPC Advisory Council), this is an ongoing secular shift rather than a sudden step-change,
as the precipitous shift in Mellanox's valuation would indicate.


40GB/S LOW-LATENCY ETHERNET: "NOT AS FAR AWAY AS YOU MIGHT THINK"


As we've previously alluded to, Ethernet is significantly cheaper than Infiniband. According
to HP's website, a 40GB/s Infiniband adaptor costs $1,295 while a 10GB/s Ethernet
adaptor costs $699 and a 1GB/s Ethernet adaptor will run you only $229. That price
differential is especially significant considering that a standard HP ProLiant server starts at
only $858. Given this context, we believe that only deep-pocketed, price insensitive
customers are willing to pay for Infiniband over Ethernet. That may soon change should
40GB/s Ethernet networks become widely deployed, causing some high-performance

computing customers to switch to Ethernet. But Ethernet networks typically have higher-
latency than Infiniband, latency being the other measure of speed along with bandwidth.
However, if 40GB/s low-latency Ethernet networks become widely deployed, that could
result in even more HPC customers might switch from Infiniband. On their August 9th Q4
2012 earnings call, Emulex, a maker of fiber channel and Ethernet connectors, announced
its intention to create low-latency 40GB/s and 100GB/s Ethernet products:


Customers have asked us to provide a low-cost alternative to InfiniBand that
could be used to converge LANs, SANs and HPC workloads while allowing IT
managers to leverage a common set of tools and practices in the data center. We
see the opportunity to drive the second major phase of network convergence by
combining HPC and IP networks on a single wire with software designed networking
tools leveraging low latency 40gb Ethernet... Our investment in high-speed 40gb
and 100gb Ethernet ASICs… will allow us to very effectively tap into the rapidly
growing high performance computing opportunity. This strategy isn't just about
pointing into the future as we're starting to make announcements in this space now. 
- Emulex President and COO, Q4 2012 Call


Emulex goes on to mention that they've had numerous customers in the "web and cloud
space" inquire about an alternative to native Infiniband, which is costly and cumbersome.
They also note that, "We're not seeing InfiniBand so much in the storage space," which
Mellanox claims is roughly one third of their total addressable market (3.4m of 11.8m
endpoints).


Emulex currently trades below 1x 2012E revenue and around 4x EBITDA, which doesn't
bode well for MLNX's future valuation should 40GB/s Ethernet displace a portion of
Infiniband's market share.


IS INFINIBAND EVEN THE HPC INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE?


Semiconductors are a very fickle business. Brief product life cycles exist thanks to the
continued proof of Moore's Law. This year's hero could be the next year's zero. At the
moment, Mellanox is only one of two suppliers that make silicon for InfiniBand switches
and adaptors, the other being QLogic's former Infiniband business. QLogic has historically
lagged behind Mellanox's technology, and thus decided to sell its InfiniBand business to
Intel for $125m in January 2012. Intel was one of the original developers of Infiniband
silicon in the early 2000s, but it then switched its focus to Ethernet technologies. QLogic's
Infiniband can only achieve 40GB/s, putting them a cycle behind on the technology curve.
But many analysts believe that Intel's next CPU core (i.e. Romley's successor) may be

https://seekingalpha.com/article/856071-mellanox-end-of-romley-upgrade-signals-steep-downside 7/23


able to bundle its in-house InfiniBand interconnection technology with its next generation
server CPUs. Should this occur, high-performance computing clusters would have little
reason to purchase high-priced interconnectors from Mellanox during the next product life
cycle.


Additionally, if lower-cost Ethernet can be created to run at around low latency 40GB/s,
many cost-conscious datacenters could efficiently operate without a proprietary Infiniband
network. For an enterprise surrounded by such near-term technological risks, Mellanox
currently trades at a completely unjustifiable multiple. That's especially the case given that
once the Romley CPU upgrade cycle abates, we expect Mellanox's growth to materially
slow over the next few quarters. Once the market foresees this, Mellanox's astronomical
valuation multiples will quickly fall back to Earth.


HIGHLY INFLATED VALUATION IS UNJUSTIFIED


Below is a summary of MLNX's valuation:


We would propose a thought exercise to any investor. Go ahead and check the valuation
multiples for your current investments through Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg or a similar
portal. We would guess that most are priced well below MLNX. As the Facebook IPO
demonstrated, even disruptive monopolistic businesses are not good investments at
inflated valuations, let alone single-product technological components suppliers.


For additional perspective, we've indexed the historical trailing EV/EBITDA multiple for an
index of semiconductor and interconnector companies:


As the chart below shows, the industry generally has traded well below 10x trailing
EV/EBITDA for the past 2 years:

Broadcom, Microchip Technology, Marvel Technology, Brocade, ON Semiconductor, and
Advanced Micro Devices  
Source: CapitalIQ


Mellanox currently trades at 71x LTM EBITDA and 26x FY12E EBITDA, both well outside
the range of our chart.


A SOBER ANALYSIS: WHAT'S IT WORTH?


According to the industry-sponsored mouthpiece, the HPC Advisory Council, annual HPC
interconnect revenue will reach $2bn by 2014. This trade group forecasts that Infiniband
will have 43% of this market (vs. Ethernet and proprietary interconnectors).


While the industry analysts that we've spoken to believe that the $2bn market figure might
be too high, we'll be generous and use that figure to create an 'everything-goes-right' peak
valuation target for Mellanox. Assigning Infiniband a 45% market share, in line with HPC's
estimate, would infer overall Infiniband revenue of $900m/year by 2014. If Mellanox
dominates the market with 90% share, MLNX could theoretically achieve about $200m of
revenue and $60m EBITDA per quarter, or $240m of 2014 EBITDA (using a charitable
30% EBITDA margin). Since this is a peak EBITDA target two years forward, we would
generally assign a multiple below the industry peer average of 9x. But even if we use a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/856071-mellanox-end-of-romley-upgrade-signals-steep-downside 9/23


princely 10-12x 2014E EBITDA multiple range, which is beyond the top-end of the
industry's trading range, the business would only be worth $2.7-3.0bn or
$60-$70/share.


This is not our estimate of the fair value. Rather, it is the highest valuation we could
reasonably fathom should Mellanox execute perfectly over the next two years. This would
not only be a herculean task in and of itself; it would require Intel to fail to generate its own
Infiniband alternative to MLNX's technology and would also require Infiniband to maintain
its current market share relative to other technologies. We don't see how a rational
investor could possibly accept the risk-reward trade-off of MLNX's current share price of
$110 in light of these significant downsides.


MELLANOX'S VALUATION APPEARS UNSUSTAINABLE RELATIVE TO SELECTED
PEERS


Below is a table comparing Mellanox's valuation to other comparable companies in the
Ethernet and Fibre Channel semiconductor sub-sector, as well as the general
semiconductor sector.


We think the best long-term comparables for Mellanox are the Ethernet/Fibre channel
companies, Emulex and QLogic. Infiniband is currently experiencing a resurgence much
like Ethernet did from 2006-2009. We can use historical valuations from that period to give
us a sneak-peak into what the future might hold for Mellanox. The forward EBITDA
multiples for ELX and QLGC briefly hovered near 10x in 2007 before reverting to the 5x -
8x range following the financial crisis. Based on this analysis and the trading range of our

https://seekingalpha.com/article/856071-mellanox-end-of-romley-upgrade-signals-steep-downside 10/23


comparable index, we are comfortable assigning Mellanox a 10-12x FY14E EBITDA
multiple, which we feel more than compensates Mellanox for its current technological lead.
The prudent investor would of course only purchase or hold shares at a substantial
discount to our 'peak value' case of $60-70/share.


We believe that Mellanox's valuation multiple will revert to levels much closer to its peer
group once investors realize that Infiniband is susceptible to technological risks just like
Ethernet was a few years ago and fibre networks were before that.


WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE...


As we might expound upon in a future article, the tendency for investors to mistakenly
over-extrapolate a few quarters of growth is a recurring theme in the tech hardware
industry. We would direct investors to study the share price corrections of Sycamore in
1999-2000 (optical switches for fiber networks), STEC in 2009 (solid state drives), or
Acme Packet in 2011 (session boarder controllers for 4G-LTE). Time and time again, the
market shows a tendency to project recent quarterly growth into a long-term trend. But
frequently, growth will ebb following a short-term earnings spike as the product cycle
peaks, new entrants emerge and the technological landscape shifts. The key for a rational
investor is to understand why the market's mispricing exists and compare that to historical
precedents.


MLNX shares nearly tripled from $35 to $90 following the Q1 and Q2 earnings reports,
reports we believe were driven to the upside by a short-term Romley upgrade cycle.
MLNX's stock was then boosted from $90 to $110 on July rumors of a buy-out by Oracle

or IBM. Never mind that Oracle and IBM are extremely unlikely to pay $5bn+ for an
inconsequential supplier (MLNX sales to Oracle were $18.3m in 2011). But fanciful rumors
such as these are taken as legitimate news stories during investment frenzies. These
frenzies have been buffeted by irresponsible analyst price targets and an extraordinarily
busy PR department at Mellanox. So far in 2012, the company has created no fewer than
55 press releases, most of which contain unsubstantial, promotional headlines. We find it
interesting that for the majority of the press releases, the company does not file
corresponding 8-Ks, indicating that the news is a non-material event. Just in the last few
weeks, Mellanox has flooded investors with convoluted product headlines such as:


"Mellanox InfiniBand and Ethernet Interconnect Solutions Incorporated Within
Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Enable the Highest Performance for Cloud,
Database and Storage Infrastructures" - Sept 4th 2012


"Mellanox 40 Gigabit Ethernet Solutions Deliver Record Virtualization Performance
Over VMware ESXi 5.1" - Aug 28th 2012


"Mellanox's Hardware-Based I/O Virtualization Solution Over VMware ESXi 5.1
Enables Industry's Highest Performance in Virtualized Data Centers" - Aug 28th
2012


"Mellanox Introduces New RDMA-Based Virtual SAN Software Appliance Delivering
6X Higher Performance than Fibre Channel SAN Hardware" - Aug 27th 2012


What we view as more revealing than these press releases is the fact that MLNX
conducted a secondary offering in late 2011 at prices 70% lower than current levels.


IF MELLANOX IS UNDERVALUED AT $110/SHARE, WHY WAS THE COMPANY
SELLING SHARES AT $31.75


On September 20th, 2011, MLNX diluted shareholders by about 10% by issuing 3m
shares (plus a 450k greenshoe) at $31.75, netting MLNX $90.7m in gross proceeds. The
company did not disclose a specific use of proceeds, instead using boilerplate 'general
corporate purposes' language. Since the company had $102m of cash at the time and was
cash flow positive, MLNX does not appear to have had a good reason for diluting
shareholders. It is telling when a debt-free, cash flow positive business dilutes existing
shareholders by nearly 10%. Perhaps management decided to take advantage of what it
considered to be a frothy valuation at $31.75/share. Today, at prices 3.5 times higher than
the September 2011 valuation, MLNX's share price is no longer frothy; it is downright silly.

THE 800 POUND GORILLA: INTEL


The markets in which we operate are extremely competitive and are characterized
by rapid technological change, continuously evolving customer requirements and
fluctuating average selling prices. We may not be able to compete successfully
against current or potential competitors.  
- MLNX 2011 Annual Report


As Seeking Alpha contributor "Infitialis" adeptly summarized in his report, Intel has
recently positioned itself to re-enter the interconnector market with three acquisitions in
the past thirteen months: QLogic's Infiniband, Cray's proprietary interconnectors, and
Fulcrum Microsystem's Ethernet. We believe that this holistic approach to interconnector
technology (i.e. more than just Infiniband) could allow Intel to offer a bundled
CPU+interconnector offering when the successor to Romley is released.


At the moment, Intel appears to have made a strategic decision to delay direct competition
with Mellanox during the Romley release. Instead, Intel is probably attempting to skip a
product cycle and leapfrog Mellanox with a bundled offering. We believe that this week's
Intel Developer Forum might provide a glimpse into Intel's interconnector future. At the
current price levels, we believe MLNX shares could sell off sharply should Intel make any
interconnector-related announcements.


THE INTEL DEVELOPER FORUM


Much like the Apple product forums made infamous by Steve Jobs, Intel hosts a biannual
Intel Developer Forum (IDF) to discuss its latest technological advances and product
updates. The next IDF will be held September 11 - 13th and key items on the agenda
include next-generation CPUs, smartphone/tablet processors, and Windows 8 integration.
But what intrigues us with respect to Mellanox is Intel's scheduled presentation dedicated
to interconnector technology entitled, "HPC Fabric Performance Overview." According to
the agenda, "This session covers the architecture of the recently acquired Intel True Scale
Fabric [QLogic's Infiniband]." We would not be surprised to hear Intel hint at its next-
generation interconnector technology, be it Infiniband or a Cray-related proprietary mode.
If Intel can bundle its next-generation CPU with in-house interconnector adaptors and
switches, Mellanox could lose most of its FDR-related revenues in 2014 when the
successor to Romley is launched.

Comments (29)


We'll end this section with a quote from Scott Fulton, a journalist for the cloud computing
website ReadWriteWeb, who remarked, "If anyone can compete with Mellanox using a
QLogic product line, it's Intel."


CLOSING REMARKS


In summary, we congratulate Mellanox for creating an exciting technology and building an
impressive customer base. But the high-technology semiconductor business is extremely
cyclical and the "alliances" developed with the OEMs during Mellanox's temporary
technological lead will count for little as competitors emerge. Low-cost, low-latency
Ethernet or a bundled Intel CPU+Infiniband motherboard could very well disrupt
Mellanox's near-monopoly within the next few years. Even more ominously for investors,
the recent surge in quarterly revenue growth is probably a fleeting event. Once the
Romley upgrade cycle plays out, Mellanox's FDR chip sales (54% of total revenue in Q2)
should sharply reverse. If this causes an earnings miss in Q4 2012 or early 2013, MLNX's
share price should quickly correct itself far lower than today's $110 trading level.

The need for these super highways are a necessary link to the faster and higher digital volumes. 
Both MSFT and ORCL had projects in this area and due to MLNX advantage they stopped their projects and
conceded to MLNX as a monopoly in this area. Implied is the moat around the technology.


It's positioning is not as central as CSCO, but still it's a necessary technology with no competition.  
He draws comparisons to other internet technologies but has no clue of what he is talking about. The entry in
these other areas was trivial. The innovation nice but not exceptional (the vision is what was exceptional, but
this implies a shorted life span or market leading)

Akram's Razor, Marketplace Contributor
Actually this piece is great, if anything they were too soft on mellanox. Listen to a recent hpc wire interview
with the cray ceo about why they sold their interconnect hardware biz to intel. Intel's direction is without a
doubt to bring the interconnect closer to the processor and they have been buying assets to pursue this
strategy. If cray is willing to sell them the hardware and license it back to maintain their edge it says a lot
about the future direction of this biz. And if the only buyer of interconnect assets is intel that says something.

I don't have the time to respond to the whole thing... but just in the area of valuation, an example of bending
the facts... playing with words to lead reader in a very specific direction.


MLNX TTM pe is about 50.


"50%+ quarter-over-quarter growth that investors have come to expect" 
If we expected 50% growth Q/Q this will give a forward earning of ~$8 or forward pe of 13 to a company
growing at 500% clip, right? do you realize the PEG on this one? It's better than AAPL's, without the
limitations of size... AAPl cannot grow 10 times it current size, MLNX can. there is no roof over their growth. 
SO we DON"t actually "expect" 50% Q/Q, right? If we did the stock would be at $200+ or $400 ?

Another thing is the writer does mention that the specific technology is only 1/2 of the income and
immediately forgets about the other half. As if we are dealing with Arena (a 1 drug pharma) 
Forgets that the engineers who created both halves are still WORKING there (as opposed to writing articles
to push their shorts). 
Working on the next generation, and by the time Intel will/might? produce their product... who knows.


"But fanciful rumors such as these are taken as legitimate news" 
The guy spreads a rumor, disputes it 2 minutes later, in order to discredit MLNX (fancy dancing with words,
borderline criminal in this case - because of the short) 
who is talking about an Oracle take-over? and you know what - some big companies spent bigger money on
less valuable assets. Ask MSFT (skype and others), HPQ (I for get whom), ORCL (SUN)


By the way - Oracle is one of the biggest strategic customers, and if buying SUN made sense, so would
MLNX, a lot more sense, to anyone who understands the technologies - buying SUN would have made more
sense for EMC than for ORCL, but not really a good purchase for ANYONE... without geting too deep into it.
SUN was on the DEC trail to nowhere for 10 years. Too mant parallel weak chips with diminishing returns
limitation on computing power... instead of making stronger chips like INTC, HPQ

Small details, who cares, I am just trying to make a buck on my shorts


That's it - I don't have time to pull out every rock from this well. 
Initiate all the shorts you want - but my advice - pull them before next earnings (or maybe even before 4 pm
today - watch the graph carefully)


This guy has a long way to go before becoming the next Cramer

Author’s reply »  Pinocchio,


Thanks for your thoughts. We always appreciate the chance to defend our views.


We agree with you that the need for high-speed data centers is growing and we acknowledge that by
referencing the HPC Advisory Council’s 7.5% figure. But that doesn’t mean MLNX is a good investment no
matter what the price.


Frankly, we aren’t sure MLNX can grow at all after around Q4 2012, much less achieve an attractive P/E/G.
Since the highest-end of the supercomputing market (i.e. Mellanox’s FDR customers) is usually first-in-line to
upgrade their CPUs, we could see a scenario where FDR revenue begins to tail off with the projected
slowdown in the Romley cycle (see our first chart). Remember, these HPC clusters only need to upgrade
once.


Ultimately, none of us can know with certainty whether Mellanox beats Intel to the next-generation
interconnector. But we do expect that the next upgrade cycle won’t occur until late 2013 at the very earliest.
This leaves several quarters (Q4 2012 – late 2013) where MLNX could see FDR-related revenue falling

https://seekingalpha.com/article/856071-mellanox-end-of-romley-upgrade-signals-steep-downside 17/23


without yet having its next-generation product in place. Also consider that a 100GB/s+ interconnector is only
useful if you have a processor system that can utilize that speed, so MLNX might also be constrained by
whenever Intel (or another semiconductor company) releases a next-generation CPU. 
According to the 2011 10K, Oracle is no longer such as large customer. As we mentioned, Mellanox’s 2011
sales to Oracle were only $18.3m, or 7% of Mellanox’s total sales. This percentage actually fell from 8% in the
prior year. Ultimately, we don’t think that Oracle would pay $6bn for an $18m supplier who is only expected to
achieve $531m in 2012. That would imply an 11x+ revenue multiple. For comparison, the forward multiple on
the Sun deal was about 0.5x. You could well be correct that’s the some type of strategic value there, we just
don’t think the numbers add up at this price.


We aren’t sure of your TTM P/E source, but if you go through the past four quarters and calculate the diluted
EPS figures from the 10Qs/10K, you should be able to roughly back into our EPS figure. Using Friday’s MLNX
closing price as your numerator should yield the P/E figures we’ve referenced.

Akram's Razor, Marketplace Contributor
I dont have time to respond to the whole thing....but there are about 99 holes in your argument.


1) Intel's purchases are across the whole spectrum, but what is more important than intel buying is whose
selling. Cray's interconnect business is critical to what they do, and qlogic is a san focused company. What
you have here is outright acknowledgement that to improve performance ie lower latency and energy
efficiency you need tighter integration with the processor and only intel can provide that...also look at amd's
acquistition. These moves raise major long-term business viability concerns, and at even 20x earnings that's
a major concern over a 5yr period.


2) Anytime oracle is invested in anything there are rumors of buyout, but your comparables stink. Skype was
about buying a user base, sun isn't some niche interconnect business, and hpq buys are nowhere
close....services, cloud, mobile os, data center software etc


3) Look at stec and acme packet and come back and tell me you should not be worried at this price. The stec
story is really concerning if your a mlnx investor because they are focused on the same customer base, were
selling the same performance driven enterprise focused bell and whistle, had a big customer in emc and a
splurge in orders, was loved by the sell side, and collapsed just as quickly as it exploded. We can debate
mlnx all day at 40-50, but up here there is no debate. Name one soic that has focused on small hardware
component niche that has ever retained a bloated valuation for more than 18 months over the last decade.
Just one would suffice. Now name the flame outs....do a little homework there are plenty.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/856071-mellanox-end-of-romley-upgrade-signals-steep-downside 18/23


The rest of my forward calculations were just reflecting on your words on "our expectations" to show that no
one is expecting what you say we expect.


Additionally, there are analysts just like yourself who differ


http://bit.ly/S4PTCx


http://bit.ly/QAnUxF


According to them - you might be squeezed 
So, why don't you analysts get together and figure it out.  
Seriously, Do some real work to justify your position, your influence, how you effect people's future. I am
serious.  
If I evaluated the analysts as an industry in this situation, the differences between you are unacceptable.
Some or all of you MUST be very wrong. It's an F for the industry. And you have to understand that you are
dealing with people's pensions, take some responsibility.


Also, your opinion has less weight with me, because you have an agenda which aligns with what you write.


Like Cory Johnson says on Bloomberg West (one of the few analysts whom I respect) - it's not that the
"company missed analyst expectations" like is commonly stated on TV. Cory says "it's the analysts who
missed reality, again"


You have your ideas and you acted on them, fair enough.  
I think you ignore a whole suite of SW integration tools which were not factored in the last earnings, you don't
mention recent heavy contracts including China, alliances etc.  
and also, other analysts who explained why MLNX have a 2-3 year lead over competition, which is huge in
this space. Considering MLNX proven record of innovation and time-to-market of their products. 
They have a much better horizon than what you describe, and the 2 analysts presented seem to agree with
me (2 most recent in google search "MLNX price target"... not hand picked)


I once wrote here - Jimmy the Greek set the lines in Las Vegas Sports - and allowed you to bet against his
opinion. On ANY game. 
Take any analyst, maybe with a few exceptions, and have them post earning lines for every stock in Vegas,
and let us choose the spots where we want to bet against you... imagine what will happen


Regarding analysts' level of knowledge. I have met and was interviewed by analysts in my life, regarding my
company. Our 45 minute conversations were... mmm... worthless. it takes a lot longer to describe to someone
technical road-maps, comparisons to competition, describe current marketing pipeline, company
performance, management quality, margins, and how many geniuses you have in the company (in this
industry 1 exceptional brain is worth hundreds of average ones - unlike most industries) - the things that
actually matter.


Did you actually sit with MLNX? with their competitors? their customers? or you just "read about it" from
others like yourself

Akram's Razor, Marketplace Contributor
Yes, msft wrote down aquantive but i guess details are not that important to you. Don't really see your point
either on skype as you don't seem to get the difference between consumer targetted aplications and
enterprise hardware markets I was making. A killer consumer tech could have a ten year life cycle versus
hardware biz with much shorter life cycles. You come off as an overly defensive employee. And the
competition in this space is NOT huge. That's one of the reasons things are going so well for mlnx. Infiniband
has never been a very easy place to be and why for example qlogic exited as a lot of time and resources are
spent pursuing business that incrementally was not moving the needle. In mlnx case i don't think the bear
case is about 'competition' in the traditional sense, but rather about the type of competition that renders you
totally obselete. Intel makes the processor so if you are an interconnect specialist it is hard to claim you can
compete on performance if the team making the next processor is also working with the team making the
interconnect. Sorry, but thats the logic of cray whose entire model has been hardware architecture
differentiation in hpc selling their interconnect business while mantaining exclusivity and access to the
architecture so they can design solutions around it.


The sell side work on this company is such crap it doesnt even warrant discussion. Targets at 140-150 or
whatever are such a joke if you got any experience investing in tech hardware you know the script already.
Mlnx's is much more likely to go through a boom bust type of revenue sequence then some gradual climb
over the next several years.

Regarding a high-beta ride I agree. 
Regarding competition in this area - I disagree.


Yesterday MLNX CEO stated they have 3 years ahead with no competition. Maybe yes, maybe no. But I am
certain that the CEO is better informed than the analyst, but also have liabilities attached to such statements.
Time to place some liability on analysts too (throw away the disclaimers and start playing the real-life-field)


As far as agenda? of course the CEO has an agenda (he has long options), but so does the analyst (short
options).


The thing is, too often SA became a platform for questionable moves.  
and sometimes criminals. It's time to clean up this place, and generally make the analyst-space a lot more
responsible and liable.


Finally, do yourself a favor and don't go short on MLNX. There are much better risk-adjusted investments
around.  
Want a hint? look for heavy contango derivatives and short them. You'll have a contango on your side... this is
a present for you for your fine comments.


Until next time...

oooohhhh your MLNX shorts are biting you? getting nasty here?


http://bit.ly/OMneHt 
Click on the Insiders tab


The CEO has 0.5% of the company which has a 5B cap. The top 4 insiders hold about $20-25M each.  
So 3 of them are smart and put aside $2M for their kids' future, like any reasonable person would do. 
The 4th insider BOUGHT $10M worth of stocks... because the 3 others forgot to tell him their company is going down
in flames, but they did tell you, now did they?


Your analyst here didn't tell you about the 4th founder... oops. 
Why don't you do some research before burning away your money?


Your "insider reasoning" shows only one things - you have no clue about managing personal financing, you never
heard that the 1st 2M are VERY important, even if you sacrifies 80% of making 4M in the future. AND you don't do
your own research !!!


Well, that was an expansive lesson. And sure, you and your analyst know things that the SEC doesn't about MLNX
cooking their books. 
When Comverse cooked their books, they got caught... It's harder than you think (outside China and Russia).  
There are so many trolls out there kicking every stone.  
Every time a stock drops by 2%, any stock, there are dozens of trolls reading every word every insider said or wrote in
the last 2 years, going through every K-8 K-4 K-10 K-whatever looking for a reason to sue. You just don't understand
basics...  
I hate these trolls, they are ugly, but their vulture-job is nature's clean-up


You better get out of the stock market, because you'll be homeless before you know it. You put money on a single
analyst's opinion... ahhh


And by the way.... you missed a tip I gave you, about the only holding you'll ever need, because you are so caught up
in your ego. 
SO... one more time, and for the last time - find a strong contango and make it work for you.

hold such a slice of your money in a single position. You just DON'T. And I couldn't care less about what any analysts
shmanalysts kids will write about this...


Just like one of the main holders of FB did. It doesn't matter where FB goes, or what analysts made of his sale - he is
set for life, his kids are, his grand-kids are and their grand-kids too. and it has nothing to do with where FB goes in the
next 10 years.  
And it doesn't matter how many grand-grand-grand kids they'll have either.  
He is just very smart. And within 1 month no one will remember this transaction nor what the analysts wrote about it.

Isn't customer concentration an important issue for MLNX? How susceptible are they to losing a major customer to
Intel, now that has its own Infinband product?

Author’s reply »  They're susceptible to losing virtually all their customers to Intel if Intel comes out with its
own viable integrated interconnect solution. At this point, MLNX's technology is in the lead, so MLNX is the
go-to solution for Infiniband. But one of the problems with its current valuation is that analysts are assuming
this will always be the case, which we don't think will be true. Equally as important, the overall market for
Infiniband is just not big enough to justify the current valuation. It's a small niche market exclusive to high
performance computing and a small select number of non-HPC server clusters that need very fast speeds.
Most others are fine with the current Ethernet solutions. The growth we've been seeing is due to the Romley
upgrade cycle, and not due to some suddenly new secular growth trend in Infiniband's end markets.

Congrats, you nailed this call. Should feel proud when you get it right for the right reason.

I followed Kerrisdale in, and I've been very pleased to see the short thesis start to play out. Where is everyone else
closing their shorts? My first thoughts are to buy the position back now in the high 70s, take profits and give MLNX
some credit for being a good, honest business. But my second thoughts are to wait for another group of traders to
come in and start shorting now after the restriction, and buy from them.


Thoughts?

Author’s reply »  We're still short. The stock trades at 5x 2012 revenue and has forecasted sequentially
declining revenue in Q4. I think it remains attractive on the short side.

Great call, Sahm and Kerrisdale. I owe y'all a bottle of wine or something. This is at least the second time I've
followed you in to a short and done well.


To repay the favor, I want to tell you a long I'm getting interested in. It's chip manufacturer in a highly cyclical part of
the business whose share price is falling and has about a quarter of its market cap as cash on the books. Ticker
symbol is MLNX.
