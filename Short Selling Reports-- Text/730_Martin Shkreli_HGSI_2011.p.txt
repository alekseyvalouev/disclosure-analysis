Human Genome Sciences: Slow Benlysta Launch Results In Good
Short Candidate
Aug. 28, 2011 4:44 AM ET32 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Human Genome Sciences (Nasdaq: HGSI) has a market cap of $2.4 billion. Its main asset
is Benlysta, a newly approved lupus drug. Because HGS shares half of their gross profit
from Benlysta with partner GSK, it is more appropriate to think about the “Benlysta market
cap” of roughly $5 billion. WK sales data last month suggest monthly sales of $5 million for
this asset. At a run rate of $60 million annually, this is a product trading at 83x sales. Even
if the run rate increases substantially from here, as it did with the Remicade in its early
years, this early base is much lower than expectations.


My modeling suggests a global peak sales estimate of $750 million, with fair value for
HGS at $7 per share, or 40% downside. I think my peak sales and value estimates are
generous to HGS. This product is simply not efficacious enough. Drugs like Remicade,
Enbrel, Humira are “night and day” differences for their patients. Benlysta is much more
like Provenge, where the medical community is skeptical of relevant efficacy as the data
sets for both drugs suggest a modest benefit. Physicians will use their discretion as to
which patients may benefit most from Benlysta.


Lupus is a highly symptomatic disease where unless a flare is prevented or the severity
lessened, patients and physicians aren’t served. Benlysta doesn’t seem to do either,
instead it seems to provide a very small benefit in a highly variable disease. Lofty sales
estimates rely on Benlysta patients remaining on Benlysta, an unlikely to occur scenario
as the large patient copay and insurance pressures limit “perpetual” revenue drugs from
patients who are not clearly benefitting. I could see revenue for Benlysta peak soon and
then begin to decline sequentially as patient time on drug shrinks.

Benlysta is also a very expensive product. In the new healthcare and macroeconomic
environment, new drugs are being shunned, especially if they do not provide meaningful
improvements over old standards. Expensive and new drugs are even more carefully
scrutinized. My thesis is that when HGSI reports Q3 and Q4 earnings, the share price will
nose dive just as Dendreon’s (NASDAQ:DNDN) share price did. Reality is quickly setting
in for HGS longs, mostly growth-oriented mutual funds who have just completed large
purchases above $25 per share in Q2 2011.


I suspect these investors will exit as quickly as they entered, as the current $12 and
declining share price creates a panic.

What is DNDN's fair value?

Author’s reply »  Sadly I don't see a lot of value in DNDN. Maybe $5? It's difficult to know without
understanding the cost structure better. It is very unclear what is still being expensed in COGS vs already
cap-exed. Similar situation in operating expenses where it is unclear how much logistics reimbursement etc
really cost. If it is a true cancer drug with 50%+ operating margins (which it clearly is not), fair value would be
$30+. Even with 30% margins I'd think DNDN was cheap. Unfortunately they seem to be unable to breakeven
on a cash (not accounting) basis even with $400 million (according to their own comments). Time will tell but
I'd rather stay away from this one. Not sure I'd short it though!

Martin, Did you secretly unload your short offer and left the readers in the lurch or are you still invested on the
short side. Just curious?? Dare to comment!! Stock is at 15.5 as I am writing the comment!

35K a year isn't expensive. Provenge (93K) and the new SGEN drug (103K) are.

Author’s reply »  I liked this comment by accident.


I think $35,000 is expensive! I wouldn't compare it to other drugs quite yet, especially not cancer drugs. I
would think about cost savings to the healthcare system (employer benefit) and patient willingness to take the
therapy. Patients are clearly not running to Benlysta. Some have 20% copays and the idea of $7,000 out of
pocket plus time and money for doctor visits and travel is just too unappealing for the meager control. If
Benlysta were a great drug like Remicade, $35,000 would be fine. The fact is, it is a pretty modest drug,
borderline, even.

Martin, because so few patients can afford the copays of biologic agents, most companies with these
products have in place generous copay assistance plans to help patients who have private insurance with
high copays. Unlike 'regular' drugs where there are copay cards to reduce the copay by 25 bucks or so,
biologic companies will usually cover the entire copay or limit customer payment to $50/month (I'm basing this
assumption on my knowledge of the MS drugs). I spoke recently to a renal colleague who sees a fair amount
of SLE who mentioned that they did not know about a copay assistance program until recently, so it may not
have been available the first couple months (or maybe they were just unaware of it). Thus, any patient with
commercial insurance and a high copay will not now have to worry about $7000 out of pocket. As far as the
efficacy....though not stellar there is no other FDA approved biplogic agent out there and patients are usually
more willing to accept a small chance for fair improvement than their insurers.


There is, however, one very important caveat to my counterargument here. By law,companies are only
allowed to help copays for patients with private insurance. As an in-office infusable drug, Benlysta will fall
under Part B. Most Medicare patients will be in a Medicare advantage program, have a private insurance for
the remaining 20% or have Meidcare/Medicaid. So, only some Medicare patients have to worry about high
copays. Eventually the companies start offering free drug to this small group of poorly coverede Medicare
patients (at least they do for MS drugs like Tysabri). Those on Medicaid generally have ridiculous low copays
so are less affected by these kickback laws than the Medicare crowd.


Patients with SLE, severe enough to be treated by Benlysta, are probably more likely to be on public
insurance -- either Medicare or Medicaid. My state Medicaid did not cover Benlysta until July 1, 2011.
Because each state sets up its own Medicaid policies, this might have affected the ramp-up some.


Disclosure: No position. I think epratuzumab (IMMU) will be a better lupus drug.

Hello, Still curious if you have ur short position?? or did u offload it?? Martin, u enter the short position with
much publicity and when u exit the short position (especially, trying to save ur a**), u do it secretly.


26 Sep 2011, 10:36 PM 


Transparency!
Remember, at 76 weeks the efficacy is no better than a placebo. Also, HGS has warped the efficacy graphs
to suggest that the efficacy follows a slow and steady trend upwards to the 52 week endpoint. In reality,
however, the efficacy points before 52 weeks follow the placebo points quite closely. The 52 week efficacy
data point is like a star, way above, and out of line with the earlier points. You got love the honesty of
Marketing folks!

I guess since you think there is 40% additional downside you aren't afraid of being late to the party. I think globally
speaking a month or 2 ago many of these biotech launches were overpriced (SVNT, DNDN, HGSI) by any reasonable
sales or profit multiples. However, now with the Dendreon flu + general macro fears slamming the biotechs, is now a
great time to short? Also, sometimes it takes a little time to build a market and someone's its not a good reading 2
quarters or so in (I dont remember exactly when Benlysta was launched)


Any opinions on HGSI's pipeline?


By the way I like the contrarian opinion. I'm sick of "this is a disruptive technology and will change the world and make
a bazillion dollars" by ignoramuses.

Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I do think now is a great time! I wish I was in at $25 or $20, but there is still a large IRR
return possible. If shares fall 50% by year-end, you're looking at a 150%+ annualized IRR. With leverage
(puts?) you're even better off. I think some shorts are better when it's shooting fish in a barrel than when
you're not sure. A few months ago it was unclear how much sales would be. Now we see flattish sales in the
very early (4 or 5 months) part of a launch. 4 or 5 months ago we simply didn't have that information. I think
this is SVNT DNDN AVNR CADX etc all over again. The larger cap nature and lack of hysteria will make this
decline quick and easy in my opinion.


The pipeline is meager!

Thanks for your disclosure. You are obvioulsy biased and your opinion is designed to add to the fear and confusion.
Over 10 major analysts covering Benlysta have recently revised their estimates downwards and the current stock
price reflects their downgrades. It accounts for slow Benlysta sales and estimates HGSI/GSK will eventually ramp up
sales to account for 50,000 to 75,000 patients worldwide as more and more Rheumatologists find comfort in the
results and expand use to prevention of flares instead of maximizing steroids. If you pool Benlysta data from both
trials, Benlysta is highly efficacious. All the pasionate patient testimonies convinced FDA expert panel and FDA to
approve the drug. Rheumatologists are beginning to prescribe Benlysta for selective patients and this patient pool is
increasing. The drug clearly works in a select patient population estimated at 200K in US and 200K in Europe. So if
they even achieve steady state with 50K patients worldwide, they account for over $1.5billion in sales. So who do you
believe? This biased reporter who is short and can change his position anytime without informing anyone? He does
not disclose when he shorted? Why is he reporting doom and gloom now? Obviously to create panic and maximize
his profits. He sure does not have my best interest in his heart.  
And he forgets to mention that GSK can make a bid for a HGSI takeover for a 100% premium over current levels at
any time. After all GSK has 2 other drugs in Phase 3 trials in partnership with HGSI; Syncria and Darapladib. What
will such an action do to folks who establish a short position today? Deep fry them?

"slow launch" is not a game over. It's just a slow launch. Once it gains traction, this stocks goes back to $25/sh. Good
try. Good luck with your short position but I wouldn't want to be in your position.

Since the “Shkreli” thesis here is that Benlysta has minimal efficacy, especially when compared to the benchmark of
Remicade in rheumatoid arthritis, let’s look at the data. The widely used effectiveness metric of NNT (Number Needed
to Treat) for Remicade has been reported at approximately 4 (range 3-6) ktclearinghouse.ca/ceb..., which compares
to NNT of 8.5 for combined Phase-3 trials of Benlysta (BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials). When calculating for the most
stringent prescribing criteria being used in European approved label (“high disease activity” patients, i.e., prerequisite
of low complement levels and positive anti-dsDNA), the NNT is 5. HGSI reported at EULAR convention in May 2011
that this subset was 52% of the BLISS study population and whom had more dramatic steroid sparing, statistically
significant reductions in FACIT-Fatigue scores, SF-36 PCS, and severe flares. They also had statistically significant
SRI responder rate at 76 weeks (i.e., a durable long-term response). So if you limit the Rhum docs prescribing only to
this “high disease activity” population, the model conservatively predicts 150K to 250K patients in USA and EU getting
Benlysta. That compares to about 20K patients in the “Shkreli” model, which clearly is way underestimating the drug
efficacy & likely patient pool size…..even by Remicade historical standards.

HGSI way up recently. Martin, I notice that you thanked hardfocus and said he has great analysis, even
though his view differed greatly from yours. You also didn't have a rebuttal. Not saying Martin is wrong, just
saying maybe there's a middleground between the two of you, and it's something to observe in future Seeking
Alpha comments section. I'm a short term trader so I look at things like this. I don't have a clue about the
fundamentals of drug revenue predictions and pharma stocks, although they fascinate me.

Author’s reply »  Just out today from a major bank: 
HGSI: Benlysta tracking below, trajectory not picking up 
In its fourth month on the market, July Benlysta sales were $5.0M, well below our $6.8M est, suggesting that our
3Q11 $28.8M est is overly optimistic. Additionally, we note that July sales actually fall modestly below the linear slope
established in prior few months and while IMS data may be inaccurate, the trend is concerning.

Just out last week:


Piper Jaffray said GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) may be motivated to acquire Human Genome Sciences
(NASDAQ:HGSI) given its valuation discount to Benlysta's market value.


The analyst believes a takeout value would be between $21 to $26 per share and maintains its Overweight
rating with a new price target of $18, down from $31.


GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) has a potential upside of 17.2% based on a current price of $43.17 and an
average consensus analyst price target of $50.58.


GlaxoSmithKline is currently above its 50-day moving average (MA) of $42.51 and above its 200-day of
$40.46.


In the last five trading sessions, the 50-day MA has remained constant while the 200-day MA has remained
constant.

Fellows, Martin is a one trick pony: just trying the short idea. He wrote an article on BMRN, where he was
long almost 3 months back. He had a target price of 50 +. The price at the time of the article was 28 and now
it is still at 27-28. Great returns!!


He just tried the short side and got lucky with the market in the last couple of weeks. Plain simple! He got
lucky with NEOP and AVNR. And he is now trying HGSI. Any tom, dick and harry who shorted the market in
the last few weeks got lucky.


Note: I am not at all invested in HGSI and neither will be. Just commenting on poor articles !!


30 Aug 2011, 12:48 AM 


Steven Breazzano, Contributor
Not to blindly defend Martin, but overlaying a 3 month chart of BMRN vs. SPY shows that an investor long
BMRN has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, very impressive considering it has been a down market and
most biotechs were getting crushed.....


30 Aug 2011, 01:06 AM 


kiar97
Compared to S& P 500, yes, good returns! Comparing it to its nearest competitor: Watson Pharmaceuticals,
etc, (watson gained more than BMRN) has poor returns!!


I think, the more rationale approach is to compare to its competitors than.....

Compared to IBB (Nasdaq Biotech Index) its roughly 2-3% points better!

kiar97
If hedge fund (Martin Schreli's MSMB) is giving 2-3 % better returns than the index, then why invest in a hedge fund.
Any long term CD is much more safe and sound!!


U did not get what I was saying: BMRN's performance needs to be compared with WPI, Genzyme (which are the
competitors). Although it beat the index by 2-3%. Although Genzyme is no longer independent. For ex: If you have
MSFT, you have to compare it with its peers like GOOG and AAPL and see its performance. MSFT will outperform the
index, but will underperform its competitors. Hope u got it now!!

Would be difficult to use WPI and Genzyme as comparables. WPI is a global pharma in variety of products
(generic, branded, biologic) and Genzyme no longer trades as it was acquired by Sanofi and is a large

niche products and markets. But given similar market cap biotechs with products in the market (there isn't
many), the stock has held up very well in the current climate of global macro uncertainty and risk-off attitude.
When the markets stabilize and turn back up, BMRN will be an outperformer in the biotech sector IMHO.


I do think MS has a point despite some astute analysis of cllinical benefit and market opportunity for benlysta
by several posters. Physicians are under-prescribing the drug given its perceived cost/benefit profile.
Physicians I've spoke to have mixed feelings about the drug. Although, I believe the patient pool population is
bigger than what MS calculates, my worry lies with the acutal penetration within this market.
