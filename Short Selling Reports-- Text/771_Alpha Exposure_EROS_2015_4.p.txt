Eros: Revising Our TopCo Analysis
Nov. 20, 2015 9:29 AM ET51 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


We made an error in our TopCo analysis of Eros and EIML. This does not negate
any of the other damning questions that remain unanswered.


Eros reported another quarter of negative free cash flow as well as increasing trade
and other receivables.


We have written a letter to the enforcement division of the SEC. A link to it is
provided in this article.


Eros International Plc (NYSE: EROS) ("Eros") reported its second quarter results on
November 17th, 2015. Following the release of its earnings, the company held a
conference call. Notably, Eros did not take any questions from investors and only took
questions from two sell-side analysts, one with Macquarie Capital and one with Wells
Fargo. Both of these companies were Joint Book-Running Managers on the latest Eros
International Plc's stock offering (Source). Furthermore, yet again, Eros reported negative
free cash flow as well as increasing trade and other receivables. Trade and other
receivables were $225.5 million at the end of Q2 2016 vs. $216.6 million at the end of Q1
2016. We continue to believe that the company is a scam and that the equity is worthless.


We are revising our analysis on Eros International Media Limited ("EIML"), the publicly
listed Indian subsidiary, relative to Eros International Plc, its holding company parent. We
defined "TopCo" as the entities that belonged solely to Eros and not to EIML. As can be
seen in the red box in the below organizational chart:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701906-eros-revising-topco-analysis 2/15


We made the mistake of including in our calculations the various inter-party transactions
that arise between EIML and TopCo under the relationship agreement. The inclusion of
these related party transactions caused our analysis to understate TopCo's revenue as
these transactions are eliminated at the parent-level. Excluding these related party
transactions, TopCo's revenue would be as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701906-eros-revising-topco-analysis 3/15


Nonetheless, TopCo's days sales outstanding would still increase at a troubling pace if we
exclude these related party transactions as well as the related party trade balances.


In our third article, we estimated Eros' theatrical revenues based on the 132 films the
company claims to have released in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 in its 20-F filed with the
SEC (Source, see page 34). Since then, the company quietly added two films to the list,
Action Jackson in fiscal year 2015 and Siva Senai in fiscal year 2014 (Source, see latest
releases tab). Fortunately, we saved the movie list using WaybackMachine should the
company attempt to manipulate the films listed after we released our third Seeking Alpha
article (Source, see latest releases tab). We have shown the late addition of Action
Jackson below as an example.


Despite adding these two movies, we are still unable to come close to the company's
reported theatrical revenues based on the 134 films. Furthermore, we still believe revenue
from television syndication and digital and ancillary sources are even more egregiously
overstated based on industry comparables.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701906-eros-revising-topco-analysis 4/15


The red flags that we originally identified continue to exist. Investors should be concerned.
A brief review of these red flags includes:


Movie Count - The company provided a list of 64 and 68 movies for fiscal 2015 and
2014, respectively. Following our remark that the company was two movies short of its
reported numbers, two movies were added without notice. 26% of these films were
theatrically released prior to the fiscal year indicated.
Revenue - Based on publicly available sources, we believe theatrical revenue is
overstated by 95% and 49% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have now
included Action Jackson and Siva Senai in our theatrical revenue estimates as the
Company added these two films to their movie list subsequent to our third Seeking
Alpha article.
Revenue - The company's reported Television Syndication and Digital & Ancillary
revenues imply a 38-42% market share in fiscal year 2015. This is a far cry from the
20% implied box office gross market share based on their reported theatrical revenues
and the single-digit market share based on their theatrical gross box office according
to third-party sources.
Aggressive Accounting - The company changed its amortization period from 5 years
to 10 years which inflated operating profit by 176% during fiscal 2015. DSOs have
steadily increased from 139 days in fiscal 2012 to 277 days in fiscal 2015.
Capital spending - There has been no credible explanation for the $113 million
increase in capital spending during fiscal 2015. The additional information provided by
the company today, namely that 26% of the films that they purchased were purchased
post-theatrical release, makes the $276 million in investment during fiscal 2015 even
more incredulous.
CFO resignations - The CFO of Eros PLC resigned May 2015 and the CFO of Eros
International Media resigned November 2014.
Subsidiaries -The foreign subsidiaries are fueling the revenue growth, but the
reported revenues are not being collected, resulting in massive growth in receivables.
At one subsidiary, this receivable increase surpasses revenues for the period, an
accounting impossibility. More than 100% of revenue growth in fiscal year 2015 is
being earned in the UAE.
Auditor - The company hides behind Grant Thornton India LLP as the auditor.
However, Eros employs a local Indian auditor with only a few employees and no visible
website that uses a gmail email address. This very small accounting firm has audited
at least 9 subsidiaries in places as disparate as Mumbai, BVI, Mauritius, Singapore,
and the Isle of Man. The auditor recently resigned for at least one of these
subsidiaries.

Comments (51)


ErosNow - Eros' claims to have a 3,000+ library. This is in stark contrast to the 1,162
films actually available on ErosNow.
ErosNow - Management now claims that they hope to get a few million paid
subscribers over the next 3-5 years and that it will contribute meaningfully over the
long term. This is a big pullback from its $1.2 billion three-year goal discussed at the
FBR Digital Media Conference on October 8, 2015.
Related party transactions - The company has engaged in numerous related party
transactions of dubious value. One particularly galling example is Next Gen receiving
9%, 14% and 13% of Eros's capital spending during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively. Next Gen is 99% owned by an executive's mother and has no
employees


Conclusion


This is the fourth installment of our investigations into Eros. During a quarter in which Eros
released one of the top grossing Indian movies of all time, the company still failed to
generate free cash flow. Furthermore, the Company even admits that calendar year 2015
has been unusually strong with 8 out of the top 15 films being Eros films. Nonetheless, not
one of those quarters was free cash flow positive. We have now taken the unusual step of
writing to the enforcement division of the SEC and are composing a letter to the
company's auditors. We have posted a redacted copy of our letter to the SEC here. Recall
that the last time we did this, on UniPixel (NASDAQ:UNXL), the company ultimately
received an enforcement action and its stock has declined 97% since our first article. We
expect Eros' stock will decline by as much or more. We continue to believe the stock is
worthless.


Disclosure: I am/we are short EROS.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.

Going on about screen grabs and 1 missing Film title? please.


You also showed a fundamental lack of basic accounting and knowledge of the film business.


Good luck, but i think this muckraking is amateurish at best and generally a discredit to the Seeking Alpha community.

I second your view Michael. Unfortunately investor community took note of AE's article which were nothing
more than a good English and made others look like uneducated bunch.

This analysis is still wrong. And this author had revised it 3 times.


Its missing more inter-party transactions. Also glaring errors on other numbers.


Also their Claims on Eros Now Library - if you log in from US - number of movies are different than iof you log in from
india. Exactly same as for netflix. Different Rights!!. this is so obvious and basic.


They completely miss music distro rights as well.


Seeking Alpha - these articles are lowering the credibility of this otherwise credible forum

I think Seeking Alpha editorial work has been appalling letting this slip by. They need to use a little stricter editing to
stop people flapping away like this.


This is not in the same class of the body of work provided by Bronte Capital and Citron Research.

Again more misleading information. I don't ever recall EROS stating that all items in their library were available on
erosnow.com. In fact here is a quote from their latest SEC filing (also included in previous filings so we can't attribute
it's inclusion to your articles): 
http://1.usa.gov/1kKHNWh


"We expect that Eros Now will eventually include the company’s full film library, as well as further third party content."


I challenge the author(s) to correct me. In order to do so please cite the location I can find where they stated this in
either their official documents, press releases, or SEC filings. I will not accept third party statements as proof.


As for the rest of your article, I can't even read it to find other inaccuracies. It seems like you're just desperate, trying
to beat a horse until you gain your objective.

Truth is I think Seeking Alpha should be held accountable. If I was on EROS executive board, Id start a defamation

open itself up to a lot of liabilities.

I agree because they have editors that proof these and accept the submissions, so they cannot hide under
the 'not responsible for what users post on the internet etc" free speech defense.


They have edited, approved, and put forward this material, hence they actively help propagate the lies in
cases like this.

I just sent a message to the Eli Hoffman.


"Good morning Mr. Hoffmann,


I would to bring to your attention some troubling matters that have been highlighted in a past few weeks. A contributor
on your platform has been publishing inaccurate and misleading information about EROS Internal (EROS). Many of
the numbers and figures that the author has quoted have been found to erroneous and from un-audited sources (i.e.
Wikipedia). Many of the commentators have also pointed out the inaccuracies in his articles, leading to multiple
revisions. This kind of reporting is not only harming the reputation of the commentator but also for the general
Seeking Alpha community. I as well as many contributors feel that this author is using Seeking Alpha as a market
manipulation tool and thus is lowering the credibility of the whole community. Please look into this. Your help in this
regard will go a long way in helping build this platform and protect its reputation.

People have and he doesn't try to defend any of it. When some of them have approached him on Twitter he
had blocked them. If the author will not defend his(their) own work it helps lend credence to the hypothesis

This has been an orchestrated shorting campaign across Twitter and in the main this blog.


my observations on the 4 posts to date are as follows;


The accounting analysis is poor and frequently wrong.


The analysis of the film count was wrong, and the assumptions used to "recalculate" the revenue figures were based
on partial data for films with India only revenues (some were even taken from wikipedia!)

The attack on the amortization rates are purely subjective and the Eros methodology is not out of kilter with film
companies such as Lionsgate.


The cashflow points are valid but should be taken in the context that EROS is building its library and the negative
cashflow is reducing quarter on quarter and is expected to turn positive soon.


The point I agree in is the use of a tiny auditor for the subs, EROS should address this quickly to restore confidence,
but essentially after 4 posts nothing of note has been brought to light.


I think the market will see through this shortly but the damage for many equity/bond holders is already done as the
mis-information campaign would have scared people to sell at a loss. I am a Uk based investor and have a very small
exposure to the bonds. However, for some it may be material. The bonds were floated on a listing particularly aimed
at retail (and as such unsophisticated investors) called the ORB (order book for retail investors). Many will have sold
at a loss because of this misinformation.

The group distribution network includes over 50 countries, with films dubbed in over 25 languages[2] and

plus an additional 700 films for which the group hold digital rights only.

So everybody reading this is pretty much in the same boat. Here's an ethical question: If you believed you were in
possession of data that could possibly have the author banned from SA and forfeit his earnings from his writings,
would you submit it to SA? There's no guarantee they would remove the articles, but if they did it would be more
difficult (not impossible) for the SEC or the retained counsel of Eros, if they have an interest, to validate intent of
market manipulation. Keep in mind the damage has already been done, removal of the articles wouldn't reverse that
by any means.

Seeking Alpha would do a great service by seriously looking into the veracity of the other reports published by the
author on Eros. There were several glaring errors which were pointed out by fellow boarders and Seeking Alpha
doesn't lose by making a just appraisal and publishing after a lot of deliberation. You are doing a great service by
highlighting issues which can be debated both sides for the ultimate truth to emerge. It is definitely more scintillating
and eye catching when a fact is brought out as controversial. The patronage for your website goes up several notches
as a result. But when the countering views, though of longs or neutral viewers, identify glaring errors or surface level
reporting then it starts to question the very fundamental position of the author and here Seeking Alpha would indeed
be viewed as balanced site if it were to check on the trail.  
Coming back to Eros, most of the points raised ie receivables etc were already in the public domain and known to the
investing community, closely following the stock. If a company raises funds to enhance its business and is being run
by a professional team who have been in the business for over 3 decades, it does send a sense of purpose for the
long term benefits of all stakeholders. The American analysts had baked in the Erosnow potential into their near term
earnings when the company has repeatedly warned against building in material contributions from this service in the
short term. Kindly go through their recent earnings call transcripts where they have never committed on a material
paid subscriber base in the short to medium term. And here in this latest post you have the author carelessly mention
a $1.2 billion sales goal by the company in 3 yrs. Working backwards, it is the 100 million subscriber target which the
company is aiming for and the important point to note here would be all subscribers (paid and unpaid). 100 million is a

goal and would one invest in any company without a goal? From there they would aim at converting them to paid
subs.  
Most of the above points in addition to crass errors like highlighting CFO resignation (after 9 years and in good taste),
movie count, topco accounting etc highlight a malicious attack with only a surface level understanding by the author.
Its high time Seeking Alpha redeems itself by being ultra cautious on this freakish reporting by this hallucinating
author especially when the author accepts his error on the accounting comprehension which was the very foundation
of his reporting in the first place. 
Hope the class action suit filing legal firms have also taken a note of this acceptance of error committed by the author
for them to be turning around. He has bled people both sides in the fear psychosis generated through his seemingly
elaborate reports. Investors long as well as short have unnecessarily been made to bleed dearly not to mention the
debt holders. Seeking Alpha owes a moral responsibility to react and put a stop to this frivolous reporting. Better late
than never.

I do not have any position in Eros. I started looking at the bonds traded in London. Maybe I have misunderstood the
disclosures, but the standard of corporate governance does raise questions. On page F-56 of the bond prospectus,
Eros India provided a guarantee for borrowings of $26m for loans taken out by NextGen Films, a separate private
company which is owned by the brother-in-law of the directors Kishore Lulla and Sunil Lulla.13 Machester Square in
London is leased from a discretionary trust where Kishore Lulla is a potential beneficiary. The property is 4506 sq ft.
The lease commenced on 19 November 2009 and ends in March 2018. The current rent paid is $153k per quarter
which equates to $612K per annum. The £/$ exchange rate around the time of lease commencement was about 1.65
which give an annual rent in £ of about £370,000. Per sq ft this is £82. In 2009 property prices in London were much
lower than current prices. Currently, number 25 in the same square has an asking rental price of £57k per annum for
1405 sq ft or about £41 per sq ft. Looks like the company is paying about twice the going rate to rent a property where
they are the beneficiaries. 
Here are details 25 Manchester squarehttp://http://bit.ly/1QVQOaW 
Other properties to rent in Manchester square.http://bit.ly/1QVQOaY 
Have not done any more digging, but these items are sufficient to stop me from investing in either the shares or the
bonds. 
I look forward to any feedback.

Hi,


Your links are for residential flats...


12 manchester square a commercial property is currently up for rent at £79 per square foot...have a look on
property link website. I assume the rental agreement is subject to an rpi+ increase each year as would be
normal for office rentals in London. Thank goodness it's all disclosed correctly in the related party transactions
so we can check these things accurately.

Hope we are not assuming Eros mgmt are made up of Buddha & Gandhi. These exposures are healthy as it shakes
out the bad aspects of the company. Bet the auditors and angel investors will scrutinize the accounts better next time.


Is the exposure grossly wrong ? or the errors don't distort the big picture ? I have shares in the Indian entity
subsequent to price crash and generally take for granted that books of these companies are cooked (majority of
companies for that matter). For a typical Indian investor cooked books are not exceptions, but the norm. Retail folks
always lost money!

When is your next article coming up (were you too busy over weekend to write another article)? I need some more
cheaper shares .....


So keep writing the same and rehash (HINT - you know nothing about Indian Movie Biz and EROS positioning)!

Do not expect any more negative impact on this stock due to new articles from this author. Whoever is short
EROS, now is your last chance to cover. Mukhtiar Chadha has grossed $1MM within 3 days of release and is
on track to be the highest grossing Punjabi movie of all time (expected worldwide gross well over $10MM).
Bajirao Mastani is set to release in December and is expected to make over $35MM worldwide.

Somebody is really taking a lot of time to create new accounts that are bullish about EROS...

This is just a repeat of the ANFI story... anonymous rumor posts by shorts, followed by a rapid return tothe old price.

Its been a few weeks, Id like to just once again thank AE for making a good amount of $ this Christmas. You've truly
been like Santa Claus, Thank you. Im thinking about selling today, so can you please post a falsified hit piece so that I
can re-buy at a lower price. Much Appreciated AE.

You're not much of a true believer if you keep selling for a minor profit within a couple weeks.

Kris Patel and Co.
You could say I'm a believer based on market circumstances. The only thing I believe in is making $$$. I dont
have any emotional attachment to EROS. Even if AE didnt say anything, Im a seller at this time because
everday I open my news, I see another bunch of shake down class action Lawsuit artists asking for plaintiffs.
Even if all the rumors are false and unjustified, I see it as as a headwind that will keep all the "true believers"
out. Best thing to do is a wait and see approach, when the stock approach's my upper limit, I sell, when it
goes down to the point where I feel opportunistic, I buy.


I dont know what your personal investing philosophy is but mine seems to be working. Give it a try and tell me
how its works out for you.
