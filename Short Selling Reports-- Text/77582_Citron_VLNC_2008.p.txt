With the recent recharge in the stock, Citron thought we
would offer investors our perspective.


Short Ideas Industrial


“Trust, but verify.” – Ronald Reagan


Here is a short and sweet story that has been infesting Wall Street for over 15 years.
Valence Technology (VLNC) is one of those “developmentally challenged” companies
that never seems to get out of development stage. For 15 years, they’ve claimed to
have a lithium battery that is promised to have uses from computers to aircraft to
scooters to automobiles. Certainly, there has been a battery of press releases over the
past 4 years …. But no meaningful business ever comes to fruition.


Some things are better left non-editorialized. The
finances at Valence Technology are enough for a
report themselves. There is nothing more damaging
that Citron can write than what we read in the
company’s own filings:


Market Cap — $500 million +


Cash — $2.8 million


Long Term Debt — $74 million


Last Qtr revenue — $3.378 million

The scheme


Tanfield


Oemtek


Loss for Qtr — $5.7 million


Accumulated Deficit — $531 million


Historical Cost of Goods – 98% to 168%


Needless to say, all of these losses have brought Valence a well-earned “going concern”
from their auditor.


Running out of cash and fast, Valence decided to solve the problem in a standard Wall
Street recipe which we have seen too often:


Put out some murky press releases that sound better than they are.1.


Invite a brokerage firm to put a buy rec on them.2.


Turn around and give that brokerage firm the business and raise money at a higher
price.


3.


Here is the scheme broken into pieces:


On February 7, 2008 the same day that Valence announced extremely disappointing
quarterly results, they attempted to soften the blow by putting out the misleading press
release of an order by Tanfield of “up to” $70 million. Reading the supply agreement
between the two to see that nowhere does it state a minimum, nor does it ever say one
word to affirm that the $70 million figure has even a remote chance of being realized as
real revenue that investors can rely upon.


It is the opinion of Citron that the Tanfield agreement will turn out like every other
agreement held by Valence … all fluff and no substance … and no real revenue.


If one wanted to bet on the future of Tanfield, Valence is surely no way to do so. There is
a company on the American Stock called Enova (ENA) that develops hybrid drive
systems that it is currently selling to Tanfield. It has significantly more revenues than
Valence and 4x more cash. It has nearly zero debt, and currently sports a market cap of
$66 million (just so you don’t think we’re only hard-line cynics).

WM Smith


On February 19, Valence announced that it was shipping additional units to Oemtek for
its Toyota Prius add-on kit.


Note: the deal is not with Toyota (TM) but rather with a small startup company which is
trying to sell add-on kits for the Prius … kits, which cost almost half the price of the
entire vehicle — new. But here is where it gets funky. In the press release we read that
previously they have shipped Oemtek 300 modules and this is a follow-on order.
According to the information on the sites below, Oemtek was initially funded by none
other than Carl Berg, the chairman and largest shareholder of Valence.


Details on CalCars' Prius+/Escape Conversion Project


How to Get a Plug in Hybrid


What makes this so bad is threefold:


If Oemtek was funded by Berg, then all revenue from this transaction has been
improperly recognized and should be categorized as related party transactions.


1.


It was never disclosed in the press release or in any investor presentation that Berg
is financially involved in Oemtek.


2.


Even though the value of the transaction isn’t sufficient to benefit Valence materially,
the announcement alone is misleading because it induces investors to believe that
Valence was chosen for superior technology, not because of the subsidy of an
investor who stands to benefit by the transaction.


3.


Whether or not this was an oversight of the company or done intentionally, investors
have a right to full disclosure of Mr. Berg’s involvement in the funding of Oemtek.


4.


Needless to say Valence is currently raising money. The investment bank du jour
happens to be the only brokerage firm who covers them WM Smith….nothing else
needs to be said on this.


History Repeating


Citron finds it amazing that history is so accurately repeating itself in Valence. Below are
links to stories in Forbes and Dow Jones from 1993 expressing skepticism about
Valence’s promises of “$500 million revenue in 5 years.”

For one thing, at the time Forbes was clucking about how Valence’s unproven products
were commanding a market cap of over $300 million. Today that number stands in
excess of $500 million. And fifteen years ago, Valence was essentially debt-free.


So what’s different now?


Cautious investing to all.
