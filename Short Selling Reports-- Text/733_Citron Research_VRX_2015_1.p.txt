Why  a Congressional Subpoena to Valeant About 
Price Gouging on Drugs Should be Granted 
 


Short term price target $130 -- Longer Term … worse. 
 
Note:   This is part 1 in a multi-part story.  While this note 1 discusses moral 
outrage over Valeant’s (NYSE:VRX) twisted strategic assault on the 
healthcare system, Part 2 will discuss the imminent danger of an over-
levered balance sheet and why it will implode sooner than later. 
 
Note:  This is not a biotech problem.  It is a Valeant problem.  
 


The Real Risk to the US Healthcare System is when Health Care 
Costs are controlled by Hedge Fund Billionaires 
 


      How Pharmaceutical Pricing Runs Amok While  
U.S. Taxpayers Are Looted 





For the last 14 years Citron Research has specialized in stories fighting 
against the abuse of ordinary investors in the stock market.  Of course, we 
have never been shy to expose the greed of the Wall Street establishment.  
The story we share today has the farthest-reaching social implications of 
any that we have ever exposed.  
 


While the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a 
one-drug startup pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single 
AIDS drug, the real issue is a 100-billion monster only Wall Street could love 
-- an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of 
abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too 
wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of 
hedge fund operators.

The real problem with drug pricing in America is forged in a single word: 
 


Valeant 
 


Don’t Hate The Player – Hate the Game 
 


In the Twitter-storm furor over Turing’s recent one-drug price gouge 
attempt, the media has overlooked the reality that Martin Shkreli was 
created by the system.  Shkreli is merely a rogue trying to play the gambit 
that Valeant has perfected.   
 


This article is not for you hedge fund managers who believe that this 
quarter's performance is more important than human decency or long-
term viability; this article is for the millions of Americans who together can 
be strong enough to mandate change.  Wall Street will understand in time. 
 


While Citron Research analyzes the future viability of Valeant based on 
their highly levered portfolio of drugs, the main takeaway of this article is 
the danger that Valeant’s corporate strategy jeopardizes the entire US 
pharmaceutical industry, and its status as a leader in the development of 
drugs for the entire medical system. 
 


Systemic Drug Price Hikes ... Because they Can 
 


Lets us start with drug price hikes. Senator Sanders called attention to just 
two instances: heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress. 
 


Cleveland Clinic states price hikes for the two Valeant drugs unexpectedly 
adds $8.6 million, or 7%, to this year’s budget of roughly $122 million for 
medicines administered at its hospitals … 
Pharmaceutical Companies Buy Rivals’ Drugs, Then Jack Up the Prices  


(WSJ 4/26/2015) 





Sadly, these are but two examples of the whole truth.  Citron Research is in 
the process of compiling a comprehensive dataset detailing drug price 
increases by Valeant.  We will publish our findings on 
http://www.valeantpricing.com as soon as our research is conclusive.  In 
the meantime here is an example of some of the more egregious increases:

Consistently, the justification for high prices of drugs in the U.S. has been 
the argument that we need continued R&D to drive innovation -- and high 
drug prices are the only way to pay for such innovation. The argument has 
substantial merits.  However, it should be noted this argument is also highly 
subject to abuse; Valeant has become the ultimate abuser. 
 


Valeant's Slash and Burn Strategy for R&D 
 


Valeant CEO Michael Pearson is a former pharmaceutical consultant with 
McKinsey & Co. (23 years)   Correspondingly, Valeant's strategic plan reads 
like a consultant's playbook:  cut costs and raise prices.  Simple, right? 
From a consultant’s perspective, Valeant's fiscal strategy is logical.  
Unfortunately, from a systemic perspective, just about every American is 
worse off as a result of Valeant’s strategy. Increased drug prices also drives 
higher health insurance premiums for every policyholder in the entire 
country, and higher deficits for the Federal Government, which bears 
Medicare costs. Meanwhile, no one is getting any incremental benefit; 
Valeant has made little to no effort to improve these products.  
 


Comparative R&D Expense for Major Pharmaceutical Companies 
 





The chart above shows how pitiful the research and development spend is 
at Valeant.  The average pharma  spends 17% of revenue on R&D, but 
Valeant spends only 3%.
Citron Exposes Valeant Sept 27, 2015 Page 5 of 11 
 


 
An easy defense to this from bulls is the ineffectiveness of R&D.  Well that 
is what separates a “good” pharmaceutical company from one not so good 
--  the ability to innovate.  Any asshole can jack up prices and cut spending.   
 


To give an example to this point, look at the story of Allergan, the same 
company that rebuffed Valeant’s takeover proposal because of their 
business practices. 
 





http://www.wsj.com/articles/bid-for-allergan-puts-valeants-research-and-development-
cuts-under-scrutiny-1402443053 
 


Valeant has recently started to defend its scant R&D by stating they are 
more focused on “output” rather than “input”, meaning the results they 
achieve vs the money they invest.  This is an insult to every other 
pharmaceutical company and to the system that supports Valeant.  Do you 
really think that if you are efficient you can provide the same outputs and 
spend 90% less on research and development than companies like Johnson 
and Johnson, Pfizer, Merck or Eli Lilly?    
 


Escalating drug prices with no additional innovation simply drains 
resources from the system, and providing zero additional benefits. It 
should be stopped and needs to be stopped; otherwise, such practices 
simply encourage a crescendo of bad behavior from participants.  
Eventually, it reduces incentives for companies to invest needed R&D that 
can actually improve the quality of care through the development of new 
drugs.  


 
This is where is Gets Scary! 
Valeant's strategy to simply slash and burn R&D has rewarded it with an 
escalating stock price compared to peers.  Does this look like a bio-tech 
bubble or a Valeant bubble? 
 


"From the $7 billion that Allergan invested in R&D between 
1992 and 2013, the company gained $50 billion in sales 
between 2007 and 2013"  


-- WSJ, June 10, 2014

As shareholders notice the rising price of Valeant stock, other companies 
are starting to follow in lockstep. Recently, Endo International, now run by 
a former Pearson lieutenant, is emulating aspects of the Valeant approach 
by taking out costs and raising prices, then turning into an aggressive bidder 
for pharma companies like Salix. Similarly, Mylan has started to “play 
hardball” as we observe with the Epi-Pen controversy. 
http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/mylan-leverages-marketing-savvy-price-hikes-
make-epipen-go-med/2015-09-24 
. 
Note how extreme Epi-Pen price hikes impact public school district budgets 
for schools only trying to do the right thing by protecting students from life-
threatening anaphylactic shock incidents. 
 


The risk that Citron is discussing now was articulated in 2013 article in 
Forbes comparing Valeant to Genentech.  Genentech CEO Art Levinson is a 
scientist dedicated to research and development versus the consultant in 
Pearson.  This Forbes piece was a chilling foreshadowing of the future.

“There’s also the non-trivial concern that if Valeant’s acquisition 
strategy were widely adopted, who would build the companies 
everyone intends to acquire?”

It is just two years since this article was published.  Valeant stock price is up 
100% since this article and other pharmaceutical companies being forced to 
mimic its strategy. 
 


This has become such a plague in the pharmaceutical industry that the 
Allergan CEO was forced to admit that, “Dealing with shareholder activists-
like Pershing Square’s Ackman should become a CEO/Chairman’s first 
priority” 
http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Regulatory-Safety/Dealing-with-activist-shareholders-Allergan-CEO-shares-advice-at-
BIO?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright 
 


Does this mean you must answer to activist shareholders and work through 
government loopholes to increase share price regardless of the long term 
effects of an aggressively leveraged balance sheet? 
 


Valeant has forgotten that by the time this company staggers under the 
weight of their balance sheet debt, the “shareholders” they are appeasing 
today will have moved on to whatever the next opportunity is. 
 





      But Wait ... It Gets Worse!   
Valeant's True Core Competency:  
 


Lets Loot The US Taxpayer 
 
Follow the Money and See Exactly How They 
Do It.   
 


Take just one step back from connecting the dots on a system that rewards 
slashing R&D and forcing unlimited drug price rises, you get to an insight 
even uglier.  Follow the money to see why this company is a frontal assault 
on every American. 


Step 0: The obvious point that a vast amount of all drug research begins 
with National Institute of Health (NIH) Grants -- funded by all US taxpayers.  
Drug companies are all beneficiaries of this fundamental expansion of 
science, the intent of which is to make life better, for all of us.

Step 1  is the unregulated, ungoverned and unrestrained drug price jack-up, 
mastered by Valeant, as analyzed above.  The US is the only developed 
country without some form of control over drug pricing; we have the 
highest pharma prices in the world.  Most of the reason devolves from a 
backroom deal cut when the Bush administration set in motion the 
Medicare Drug benefit and inexplicably (if you’re not a lobbyist) gave away 
the rights of the US Government -- the nation's largest buyer of 
pharmaceuticals -- to negotiate drug prices with suppliers.   


Step 2 is the Tax Inversion Game.  Valeant was the first pharma company to 
play this gambit, rolling its tax burdens to friendlier venues offshore in 2010 
when it took over Biovail, a Canadian pharma company in order to lower its 
tax rate to 5%.  So as Valeant gouges the US healthcare system, you 
taxpayers will be happy to know lots of that revenue is (legally) evading US 
taxation.   
 





Step 3   Now it gets really perverse. Valeant becomes irresistible to hedge 


funds -- it has become a virtual hedge fund hotel.  Bill Ackman crows it 
is "a very early-stage Berkshire Hathaway"   ... "a platform company that 
systematically makes acquisitions in order to increase its own value'" 


In fact, CNBC recently listed it as the #1 "Most Profitable Hedge Fund Bet of 
Q2 2015" owned by 7 of the 20 top performing hedge funds.   
 


Most of these hedge funds own the stock in their offshore component and 
than the principles will take their fat profits using -- the carried interest 
loophole.   
 


Of course this tax break is true for every stock, but it is most important in 
Valeant because the company has given up a future in order to have a 
better “right now” just to assuage its many hedge fund shareholders 
without planning for the future.  As consistently stated by Valeant: 
 


" There is no question that we would not be in the same place we are 
in today if we had a higher tax rate,"  


-- " Valeant's former finance chief, Howard Schiller,  
testifying at a July 2015 congressional hearing

Why is this Moment of Truth for Valeant ?   
 


Short Sellers and critics have discussed Valeant for years.  But now it has hit 
a perfect storm of bad news over the past two months will have a direct 
effect on their share price.   
 


1. The presidential elections have made prescription drugs a major 
topic of discussion.  Bernie Sanders has already singled out Valeant 
for the increase in their heart medication pricing: 
http://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-elijah-cummings-question-valeant-
on-heart-drug-price-increases-1439574723   


Just wait until Senator Sanders get the full list of price increases 
employed by Valeant.  Senator Sanders most likely didn’t know that 
Valeant also raised the price of Metformin by a staggering 600%. 


 http://www.pharmacybenefitnews.com/#!PRICE-FLASH-Glumetza-therapy-
could-now-cost-you-50000-per-year/c193z/558f31730cf2711ebbcebec5 
 


Hillary Clinton has laid out an in-depth drug industry regulatory 
scheme to reward R&D and penalize companies that are gaming the 
system ... exactly like Valeant.  


2. The recent selloff in the market has forced investors to reevaluate 
risks in their portfolio and the highly levered balance sheet of Valeant 
does not seem as desirable as it was just 3 months ago. 


3. Martin Skrelli has put a face to the gouging of America by 
pharmaceutical companies.  The media seems roused to demand 
answers.  Now Senate Democrats are demanding action, and this is 
the stimulus. 








" Our duty is to our shareholders and to maximize the value of the 
products that Valeant sells"

The future for Valeant 
 


It is too late to put this genie back in the bottle.  America is starting to care 
about the rising cost of prescription medicine and it is a topic that will stay 
in the forefront of next year's presidential elections.   
 


US Citizens are not divided on this issue 
“One poll, released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 
93 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of independents, and 74 percent of 
Republicans want the federal government to negotiate drug prices for 
Medicare.” 
https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/08/24/prescription-drug-prices-becoming-presidential-campaign-


issue/tOlUbF6UBlAxj4ppnTgeSP/story.html 
 


Valeant is a malignant tumor on the US Healthcare system that needs to be 
removed before it infects all the other healthy companies ... or you end up 
with no money invested in drug innovation and forever skyrocketing drug 
prices.   
 


Part II will dissect the unsustainability of Valeant, even without the 
firestorm of public disgust with its drug price gouging.   
 


Analyst’s responses … duh! 
 


Citron expects the analysts to respond to this before we can even press the 
send button.  Valeant has a lot of friends on Wall Street and the banks will 
be quick to dismiss the validity of any critique, especially if the basis is the 
well-being of ordinary American citizens … Occupy Wall Street was not an 
accident.

Conclusion 
 


In this piece, Citron gives the full context of why Congress should move to 
subpoena Valeant about price rises to its portfolio of drugs.  Citron believes 
the moral outrage at Valeant’s abuse of the health care system is a story 
that will not go away.   
 
Those risks go right to the heart of Valeant’s strategy.  The stakes have just 
risen by orders of magnitude on its ability to raise prices, while overpaying 
for debt-funded acquisitions.  And its ability to service existing debt 
becomes an ongoing risk that the market has yet to factor in.  
 
In our soon-to-be-released part 2, we will provide further detail about 
Valeant’s debt-burdened balance sheet, analyzing the company’s ability to 
manage its ballooning debt.  Specifically, Citron will discuss the 
consequences if Valeant it cannot resort to unending cycles of unrestrained 
drug price hikes, or it cannot make ever-more overpriced acquisitions.
