Uni-Pixel: Bright Future Promised By Clouding The Gruesome Reality
For The Less Informed

by: Xuhua Zhou


Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) has tripled in price since its December 7th press release that it
has entered a "multi-million dollar preferred price and license agreement" to introduce
touch screen products based on its UniBoss technology. The day-trader's darling now
stands with more than 200 million dollar in market capitalization after accounting for the
dilutive stock options and warrants and practically zero revenue generated since its
existence as a public company since 2006. The intentionally vaguely worded press
release one month ago is probably the first tell-tale sign that the story likely extends
beyond its self-proclaimed leading edge innovative approach in the alternative non-ITO
based transparent conductors market. In fact, during the course of my extensive research
on Uni-Pixel, I have come away with the belief that the company intentionally boasted its
market opportunity and misled investors about its competitive position within a highly
competitive specialized niche market. Furthermore, conversations with well-published
scientists in the field further suggest Uni-Pixel's technology is far from established. More
importantly, Uni-Pixel's strikingly lack of intellectual property renders itself vulnerable to
patent related litigations and could complicate its relationships with existing or future
OEMs. This point has already been validated by the recent lawsuit brought by Carlco.


A little background on the company, Uni-Pixel was originally incorporated as Tralas
Technologies in 1998 and subsequently changed its name to Uni-Pixel Display. Uni-Pixel
was merged into Real-Estateforlease.com in 2004 and became a listed company in 2006
under the ticker symbol "UNXL". It traded on the OTC board until 2010 when it migrated to
Nasdaq. Its main technology is UniBoss, an alternative way to create micro-structures on
films that could be used to produce touch sensors, which are currently mass
manufactured using ITO based technology. Its corporate history is definitely a standout
amongst its numerous rivals I identified. While CEO Reed Killion and analysts who cover
the stock claim that UniBoss is the most advanced cost effective technology in the
alternative non-ITO based transparent conductors market, my research indicates such
statements/analysis could be no further from the truth. Its competition ranges from multi-
billion dollar multi-nationals to numerous VC backed private companies, and its
technologies seem less advanced than its competitors. Before delving into the competitive
landscape, however, I would like to point out that the company's potential market size is
much smaller than what the company would like its investors to believe.

During the last earnings conference call, Mr. Killion stated that


A touch panel module market opportunity ahead of us is estimated to reach $19
billion by 2018 according to Display Search. That's just on the sensor side of the
equation. But as we talked about, we are not limited to just display touch panel
sensors.


When commenting on the competition, here's what he had to say


There are many players that have looked for ITO replacement alternatives, and there
still are today. There are some that have been ahead of us in the development of the
technology that the technology didn't necessarily pan out well, and they've gone
back to the drawing board. There are a lot of silver-based technologies out there that
are trying to gain some traction and momentum in the market. We think we have an
advantage in the way that we print ours. Ours is an additive process. Most of the
similar technologies that are out there are photolith, and labor-intensive.


Furthermore, in a more recent conference call following the company's latest press
release, Mr. Killion further suggested that its expected gross margin will be over 50%. If all
of the statements were true, Uni-Pixel supposedly would have a leading edge technology
in a multi-billion dollar market with product gross margin exceeding 50%.


Any forward-looking growth oriented small-cap investor should be loading up the stock
hand over fist. Investing, however, is never this simple.


The True Market Opportunity Is Much Smaller


Uni-Pixel currently has a total number of shares outstanding at around 9.7 million shares;
in addition, at the current stock price, its outstanding stock options and warrants will add
another 3 million shares. It's notable that most of the stock options are awarded to the
management as compensation. A rough calculation at the current stock price accounting
for the options and warrants yield a market capitalization slightly above 200 million. Given
a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and its stated gross margin, 200 million seems to
be a fairly meager amount. But what if the real market opportunity for Uni-Pixel's products
is and will likely be non-existent or a slim 100 million dollar only a decade later? I will
present overwhelming evidence to show Uni-Pixel's recent statements are likely aimed at
intentionally misleading the market about the size of its market opportunity.

I would like to start with Uni-Pixel's own words back in 2010 when it first presented
UniBoss to the investing public. On page 19 of the following presentation made in
November of 2010, the company's own market size projection when the product was first
introduced into the market differs significantly from the CEO's more recent comments
when discussing the market opportunity of UniBoss. Less than 800 million revenue
opportunity in 2016!


Knowing the chart above is likely both overly optimistic and dated, I searched other
relevant research institutions in the transparent conductors market and came across
Nanomarkets. To provide some background on Nanomarkets, it's the leading research
establishment aimed at providing market research and industry analysis for transparent
conductors, silver inks, conductive coatings and smart coatings and surface. Any serious
investor with significant stake, long or short, should pay attention to this premier industry
researcher. It publishes an annual review on the transparent conductor market and the
research below comes directly from a conference call following its latest industry review
publication.

This detailed 8-year projection shows that the majority of the market share in 2019 still
belongs to ITO and related technology, followed by carbon nanotube and silver. All the
rest, including Uni-Pixel's copper-based solution, will only make around 100-200 million
dollars in 2019, largely negligible! The researcher discussed silver and carbon nanotube
quite extensively during the interview, but mentioned copper only once in a skipping way.


I suggest all investors in UNXL carefully read the transcript and discussion regarding the
transparent conductors market. According to Nanomarkets' projection, the market
opportunity for Uni-Pixel's flagship UniBoss product is in fact beyond gruesome. While it's
hard to predict what kind of market share UniBoss is likely to have in the other metallic
films segment, investors would have to wait a decade to see maybe 50 million dollar
revenue assuming UniBoss can take a significant percentage of that market segment.


The True Competitive Advantage Can Hardly Be Found


The previously quoted CEO comments were in fact one of the more toned-down versions
when discussing Uni-Pixel's competitive position within the transparent conductors market.
The recent sell-side reports tend to suggest Uni-Pixel as the only viable alternative non-
ITO based transparent conductor technology. I will discuss the sell-side research in a
separate section of the article.


Personally, I cannot help but notice the lack of presence of Uni-Pixel and its
"revolutionizing" UniBoss in such a lengthy discussion regarding the future of the industry
and its major players. It is hard to ignore the noted absence of UniBoss in such discussion
given its CEO's claim of the state-of-the-art nature of its product and technology. To further
validate my concerns, a simple Google search of uniboss nanomarkets and uni-pixel

nanomarkets both yield no relevant results published by nanomarkets.net. The lack of
presence of its technology is worrisome given most of the 200 million dollar market
capitalization is riding on that very technology.


While the transparent conductor markets are vast, UniBoss is a relatively niche product
focusing on a trend of the small but emerging market for alternative non-ITO based
transparent conductors. The existence of such a market and direction of future touch
screens are highly uncertain demonstrated by the recent advancements in in-cell
technologies by Apple. Within such a highly dynamic marketplace, Uni-Pixel faces
competition from well-funded VC-backed private firms such as Cambrios, publicly traded
companies like Atmel (NASDAQ:ATML), Elk (ELK manufactures many millions of
Capacitive Touch sensors every month), C3Nano, etc. Beyond these focused players,
giant companies such as 3M (NYSE:MMM), Agfa (OTC:AFGVF), Dow Chemical (DOW),
Hitachi Chemical (OTCPK:HCHMY), Mitsubishi (OTCPK:MIELF), SaintGobain, Sumitomo
(OTCPK:SMTOF) and Toray (OTCPK:TRYIF) are also aggressively pursuing opportunities
in this segment of the market. Apple's in-cell technology further brings the possibility of
rendering technologies like UniBoss completely obsolete in the medium term. In fact,
many of these firms are in a much more advanced stage in their product development and
production compared to Uni-Pixel. I would like to direct my readers' attention to two great
examples, Cambrios and 3M.


Cambrios was repeatedly mentioned in the conference call following Nanomarkets'
release of its 2012 annual review on the transparent conductors markets. The researcher
commented that the market for silver-based product this year is about $20 million and
Cambrios, being the leading firm in the space, is dubbed as the important company in the
industry when asked which alternative non-ITO based company he considered as
important.


I'm going to interpret "importance" as their level of influence. It's not just that they're
producing these things; they're companies with the ability to shape. The one that I
would mention first is Cambrios. I think Cambrios really deserves a little award for
showing that you can develop a new material like this and actually go out and sell it,
which is what they're doing. They're moving towards profitability.


In addition to praises from industry research, the strength of Cambrios' patent portfolio
simply is on a different level when compared to that of Uni-Pixel. Cambrios, with its 73
patents filed or approved directly related to the technology, makes Uni-Pixel's claim on
patent strength outright laughable. While Cambrios and Uni-Pixel do have different

emphasis in their approaches to bringing products to the alternative non-ITO based
transparent conductors market, it's still of significance to understand what it takes to be a
viable competitor in a niche sector. There will be a detailed section dedicated on Uni-
Pixel's patent portfolio later in the article.


3M is a classic example on the other spectrum of Uni-Pixel's competitors. It's a 65 billion
dollar company with resources unimaginable for a company like Uni-Pixel. It first
introduced its own patterned transparent conductors at the Consumer Electronics Show in
2011. In addition to being two years ahead in its product introduction, 3M's development is
clearly in a much more advanced stage when compared with UniBoss.


UniBoss Technology Is Unproven


Armed with a better understanding of its true market potential and competitive
environment, I attempted to gain a better understanding of UniBoss' technology. Normally
every technology has its pros and cons, but you almost never hear Uni-Pixel mentioning
the limitation of UniBoss. My analysis and understanding of UniBoss' technology stem
from numerous discussions with unbiased experts and researchers in the nanotechnology
sector. Through my conversations with relevant scientists, I've grown to have very strong
reservation with regards to UniBoss' viability and legitimacy. The concerns are on a
number of fronts.


1) Color. Copper is a reddish-pink color, which is a non-starter for any display.


2) Yield at small sizes. The picture of the 5-um line looks very rough, suggesting it will
easily be broken. Furthermore there may be areas in the film that have breaks as
fabricated. It is very technically challenging to make such fine lines at high yield in a high-

throughput process. Many large corporations have spent money in this area for years
without a product.


3) Competition. All the smart money is going to silver nanowire-based solutions at this
point because (1) the performance matches or exceeds that of ITO, (2) unlike copper the
color is neutral grey, (3) the production process is potentially high-throughput, (4)
leverages existing ITO-based patterning technology. Cambrios has announced touch
screen products with LG, Shinetsu and others.


4) Degradation. Degradation challenges with silver include electromigration and sensitivity
to tarnishing, but electromigration is perhaps not a big issue for the currents used in
displays (unknown) and Cambrios has worked hard to make the films resistant to
atmospheric degradation. Electromigration is not an issue for copper, but sensitivity to
oxidation is an even bigger issue. The copper lines will oxidize in a matter of months
unless properly sealed from environmental conditions, but this may also be able to be
addressed. This issue, although significant, is relatively minor compared to issues 1-3.


According to Professor Benjamin Wiley from Duke University, the color of copper is likely
an important limiting factor for UniBoss' application. In addition, in the product presentation
of UniBoss by Dan Van Ostrand, there's observable coppery color with its prototype
product which is likely why the company presented another version adding a "blackening
agent". The use of blackening agent, however, may impact transparency of the film.


In the most recent earnings conference call, CEO Reed Killion discussed the production
side of UniBoss.

Certainly. We have been focused on our in-house production capability and process
capability and we are going to expand that. What we are going to focus on in-house
is going to be our design capability, our mastering capability where we create a
master that's utilized to then apply to our roll-to-roll processing. What we will do after
that is the plating step and that placing step is something that we are looking to
outsource. We take -- of the 41 steps that are currently utilized to produce a touch
sensor, we reduced that to about eight. Our ability to print the bezel circuit and the
grid in one step roll-to-roll eliminates a lot of the costly process steps that are
associated with ITO and the other ITO alternatives that are looking to support this
market. Ours is the only additive step.


So with that we would then go to a plater, Electroless Plating and that plating step
can be done roll to roll. We are working on developing that process with some
equipment manufacturers. And then it comes out of the plating process and goes to
die-cutting, which is a standard die-cutting process.


From the die-cutting, it would go to tabbing, where you would put a flex cable on the
sensor. From there it would go to lamination, either a module house that would
laminate it to a display panel or directly to a display panel manufacturer where they
would do the lamination step themselves. So the ability to bring on platers is going to
be critical to meeting the volume demand that we see in 2013.


The management further confirmed and boasted its production technology by claiming it is
the only subtractive approach in the market that reduces steps and costs significantly;
when discussing production technology, the CEO mentioned it can print 50-ft per minute
and the next step is electroless plating at roughly 5-ft per minute.


Specifically, I would like to draw attention to his statement on going to a plater, electroless
plating and that plating step can be done roll to roll. Electroless plating of copper is very
difficult to control in terms of where the copper grows and how fast. There are a lot of
articles out there that discuss deposition rate:


Full Build Electroless Copper for High Density Interconnection


Complex Chemistry & the Electroless Copper Plating Process


These papers are citing deposition rates of 5 um/hr. Much, much too slow to be used in
any high speed, roll-to-roll deposition processes. Fast plating rates can be achieved, but
then all the copper in the bath is more likely to crash out of solution.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1105271-uni-pixel-bright-future-promised-by-clouding-the-gruesome-reality-for-the-less-informed 9/32


Another piece of evidence that questions the viability of an electroless process is the list of
metals in their data sheet: Cu, Ni, Sn, Cr, Ag, Au


Cr cannot be deposited electrolessly, and it is a very toxic and difficult electroplating
process.


Also, while it is relatively straightforward to switch metals with a vapor-phase deposition
process, it is not quite possible to switch for electrochemical or electroless plating;
otherwise, the whole bath chemistry is different and it's time consuming to get it to
properly function.


Finally, perhaps the most obvious point to a layman, the lack of market validation for
UniBoss technology over the past two and half years is the biggest tell-tell sign. UniBoss
was first unveiled on May 28th, 2010 through a press release to the general public as well
as an investor presentation. "Commercial products shipping Q4 2010". Indeed, it has been
two more years of zero revenue since the management's last prediction of
commercialization of the same technology. Last month, in an investor conference call with
Williams Financial Group, the CEO seems again to believe that it will be supply
constrained in 2013 and analysts conservatively estimated a 120 million dollar revenue for
Uni-Pixel. I wonder why all of a sudden, UniBoss caught its big break? Or did it really
catch a big break?


Patent Portfolio Is Slim And Legally Challenged


As a tech company claiming a leading edge market position in nanotechnology, Uni-Pixel's
patent position seems conspicuously weak. In 2010, Uni-Pixel appears to have sold all of
its patents to Rambus, according to its 10K, on Page F-13. The balance of patents was
cleared to zero. Since the 2011 10-K published on March 08, 2012, the company claims to

own 3 issued patents. I however found 4 patents, 2 issued by Europe, 1 by Japan and 1
by the US. It is possible that either the company is negligent or they do not own one of
them. However, only one of them is related to a touch sensor. The four patents are the
following


2505047 - Europe, 2012-03-10, FORMATION OF ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE
PATTERN BY SURFACE ENERGY MODIFICATION (The only one related to UniBoss,
and the only one that was applied after 2010) 
2328695 - Europe, 2011-08-08, MICROSTRUCTURES TO REDUCE THE APPEARANCE

2011013686 - Japan, 2011-01-20, DISPLAY DEVICE COMPRISING LIGHT GUIDE 
8,102,413 - US, 2012-1-24, STEREOSCOPIC IMAGING APPARATUS INCORPORATING
A PARALLAX BARRIER


With four approved patents and only one directly related to the touch sensor technology,
it's very difficult to fathom how cutting-edge Uni-Pixel's technology could possibly be.
Moreover, Uni-Pixel's noticeable lack of patented technology renders itself vulnerable to
lawsuits.


And rightly so.


On December 20, Uni-Pixel issued a strongly worded press release firmly denying any
relevancy and merits with regards to Carlco's recently filed lawsuit in the UK. With
curiosity, I attempted to find additional information regarding the potential merits and
demerits of the related litigation.


The PPT by CIT in 2009, earlier than 2010, presents the same technological details as
described on Unipixel's website. Also it agrees with statements made during the
company's conference calls. CIT ultimately belongs to Atmel. Given that CIT likely filed a
patent prior to its 2009 presentation, Uni-Pixel most likely will face significant challenges in
its legal battles rather than baseless speculation as claimed by CEO Reed Killion.


Not knowing the detailed cooperation between Carlco and Uni-Pixel and relevant patent
laws, I am certainly not in a position to judge merits of the litigation. However, Uni-Pixel's
perfunctory dismissal of the lawsuit likely doesn't answer enough questions raised by the
case. Any potential future or existing OEM partnerships are also in jeopardy if Uni-Pixel
doesn't own the intellectual property of UniBoss. Furthermore, CEO Reed Killion has
stated on multiple occasions that Uni-Pixel intends to outsource manufacturing; without
strong IP, the company really doesn't have anything given its lack of manufacturing
capacity.

In my view, the lawsuit filed by Carlco is likely the beginning of Uni-Pixel's patent legal
troubles. Another patent search on Google with electroless plating copper touch screen
yields patents belong almost exclusively to 3M. 3M also patented a type of touch screen in
2009. In the patent, it stated "after printing and curing, the inks can be electroless plated
with metals such as copper, resulting in high conductivity. Seed ink manufacturers include
CIT, a division of Carlco". Another few 3M patents also have observed similarity to Uni-
Pixel's published or publicly stated processes. With only one patent in place, Uni-Pixel's
potential of growing into a major player in a fiercely competitive niche market is slim. With
this in mind, I extend my research into the management team, including its CTO, Dr.
Robert J. Petcavich.


Management Team May Have Misplaced Incentives


When the UniBoss prototype was first presented during a SID Display Week held between
May 24th and 28th in Seattle, Dr. Robert Petcavich and Dr. Ram Ramakrishnan were
among the presenters to showcase the innovative approach. However, the scientists at
Uni-Pixel all seem to be part-time scientists. Dr. Robert Petcavich openly lists himself as
the president of Health Beacons Inc., while Dr. Ram Ramakrishnan is apparently the
president of A&B Lab even though he lists Director of Materials and Processing
Engineering of Unipixel on his Linkedin profile. With the company's two top scientists
wearing multiple hats, I truly wonder how innovative and leading edge its research could
possibly be. And its meager approved patent portfolio may come as much less of a
surprise to people. Further, how could Uni-Pixel compete with a myriad of formidable
competitors fighting for the same niche market and a few hundred million dollar revenue
opportunities in 2018. A further point looking into Dr. Petcavich, the LA Times article
detailed Dr. Petcavich's prior venture which seems to be filled with empty promises of
technologies with a bright future and a lack of eventual monetization opportunity. Although
it bears little relevance to today's discussion, I believe a CTO's track record is of
importance and relevance to the investing public.


Another important footnote on Uni-Pixel's 10K further raises eyebrows. On page 34, it
details the vesting schedule of options for executives in the management team. A
significant portion of options will be vested on 1/28/2012. It could be a mere coincidence
that a timely and vaguely worded contract was announced a little less than two months
ago tripling the stock price. It's also hugely concerning the fashion in which executives of
Uni-Pixel presented the company, including its emphasis on size of market opportunity
and the lack of clarity on its competitive position.


Sell-side Research Has Been Overly Optimistic

5/23/2018 Uni-Pixel: Bright Future Promised By Clouding The Gruesome Reality For The Less Informed - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seekin…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1105271-uni-pixel-bright-future-promised-by-clouding-the-gruesome-reality-for-the-less-informed 12/32


Uni-Pixel today is covered mainly by three brokerage firms that provide equity research.
They are MDB Capital Group, Craig-Hallium and Williams Financial Group.


MDB Capital Group, a consultant for Uni-Pixel itself, published an investment thesis on
Uni-Pixel back in April of 2012 and in its competitive analysis, MDB highlighted a number
of competitors but seemingly dismissed all of them as uncompetitive when compared with
Uni-Pixel's technology. The thorough discussion on the competitive landscape in this
article should provide a much more comprehensive picture.


Craig-Hallium also recently published a number of research reports rating the stock as a
strong buy, citing its competitive position and market opportunities. The senior research
analyst, Mike Malouf, who penned these reports, claims to have talked to numerous
industry contacts and confirmed Uni-Pixel's technology is indeed market leading. My
research seems to show the complete contrary. Additionally, on Craig-Hallium's website,
Mr. Malouf is listed as a consumer industrial and clean technology analyst. I hold my
reservation on Mr. Malouf's recommendation in the nanotechnology space.


Finally, commenting on Uni-Pixel's recent business projection and product gross margin of
over 50% cited in numerous analyst research reports, I find the number somewhat hard to
believe. Cambrios, the leading silver nanowire based solution provider, is still only close to
breaking even after seven years. With such a competitive landscape, there's little
economic rationale for any OEM to allow a small player such as Uni-Pixel without much
patent protection to achieve a gross margin even close to that number.


Conclusion


My research shows that:


1. The potential addressable market is a negligible $100-200m in 2019, compared with
$19b the management would like the investors to listen;


2. Uni-Pixel's technology has weaknesses that the management did not want to convey,
and this technology has been disregarded by the competitors with better technology
and financial resources;


3. Uni-Pixel has only one non-US patent approved to show for its UniBoss technology
and this very patent is challenged by its Europe competitor immediately after approval.


4. The management has a track record of delivery failures.


I thus believe the company's long-term viability is severely questionable. The current
exploratory types of relationships with certain OEMs are unlikely to yield major revenue
opportunity for the company due to flaws I discussed in this article. Even if the company

were to achieve limited success and generate some small revenue opportunities, the

This article, while very well researched, seems to be full of cherry-picking, old data, and misrepresented data. Firstly,
Unipixel has 83 patents pending, much more than your beloved Cambrios which has 73.

Second, your touch market potential chart is, as you state, from 2010. This is extremely outdated! The touch market
barely even existed in 2007, and has continued to crush estimates year after year. In my article I link to a RECENT
article from August 2012, that estimates the touch market will be $25B in 2014, not $1.3B according to your chart
(reverse engineered based on total revenue and market share). If Unipixel were to receive 17% market share as they
expected, this would amount to $3.4B in revenue, not $224M.


You claim that silver nanowires is so great and that Unipixel has tons of competition and discuss all these great
technologies... but then state that ITO will continue to get most of the market share. WHAT!?!? This makes no sense
at all. Why would any company continue using ITO when there are TONS of better technologies? All you need is one
better technology with capacity and ITO should practically disappear.


As for silver... Of course Cambrios is struggling to break even. Silver is currently 10x the price of copper. This makes
HUGE difference in margins.


Forget about Unipixel's ability and lets focus on Copper nano wires as a whole. Unipixel just signed up (at least) one
customer and has various partners. Atmel signed a 10 year exclusive agreement with Carclo (thats some dedication!)
and currently have at least 3 large customers. Who on earth is buying all this copper nano-wire technology when it
doesn't work, goes green after 3 months, breaks all the time, and is inferior to all other technology? I would love to
speak to those multi-billion dollar companies making those decisions. You even link to a youtube video of Unipixel
showing off the transparency of its film, where ANYBODY can see that it is 100% transparent... then you claim that it
is red or black. The only color on the film is the 'tail' of the copper nano-wiring, bunched up on the edge, which
wouldn't be seen by a user under normal circumstances.


The list goes on about the flaws in this article. Check your premises. These contradictions shouldn't exist.


10 Jan 2013, 12:26 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Chris, I don't want to argue with you about the market size. I'm citing numbers from
nanomarkets as well as the company itself and that's who you should be arguing with. 
I did mention the alternative non-ITO technologies but the non-ITO technologies are primarily designed for
larger touch screen display, a market currently doesn't exist. ITO works just fine for smaller screens and
tablets. Besides, the real costly part of ITO is the manufacturing process, not the material itself. 
Being able to sign partners with undisclosed terms doesn't say much to me. And nor could you claim the color
of copper is grey...

How'd that work out for you?


14 Mar 2014, 05:38 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
While many of these non-ITO technologies are focused on larger screens due to cost savings, they also are superior
to ITO in smaller screens. They are all cheaper than ITO at the most basic level, but, since they scale more efficiently,
the savings increase as the screen size increases.


ITO is costly due to manufacturing and the material. The material is approximately the same cost as silver, which,
again is 10x the price of Copper. The manufacturing process is extremely labor intensive, has 41 steps, and is very
costly.


I argue with your use of a 2010 chart regarding market size, which is very outdated. I could easily pull a chart from
2006 and tell Apple that Smart phones aren't going to sell because nobody cares about touch screens.

Author’s reply »  I'd like to highlight that the Nanomarkets projection was published September 2012. And all
your premise is based on a functioning technology; I have listed a number of reasons, on a scientific ground,
it doesn't even have a functioning technology. It's one thing to make a prototype with coppery color..its
another thing to roll to roll manufacture lots of them in an efficient way. And this will be my last response to
you mr.hofmann.

Xuhua Zhou,


I don't know whether to thank you or to curse you. I had quite a large position which I bought in the low 5's, so I've
made quite a profit. Your article panicked the stock, so much so, you forced me to sell my entire position in order to
protect my profits. I can always buy back in, but now is a matter of when. I still think UniPixel is a great investment, so
if you what you wrote proves me wrong, then I would have to thank you for forcing me to sell. But if I was right, then I
curse you for the inconvenience.


Can you please provide some insight as to your interest in writing the article. Did you intend to cause a panic selloff?
Did you short the stock prior?


10 Jan 2013, 02:08 PM

The article questioned the following:


1. Market size. What is the exact market size for UNXL's product;


2. Technology: Is it a product ready to make mass production in cost efficient way, whether the copper layer is
noticeable when used on touch screen, whether it is competitive compared with the products from other players??


3. Patent Portfolio: whether the company has a broad range of patents to cover its product?


I would like to hear more on this.


The author did have spent a lot time to write this article. I just curious how the author can get the shares to short. I
tried to do the same with my broker few days ago but I cannot get any shares to short. "no share available to short" I
am using AmeriTrade.

1. According to many recent sources, Touch Screen market will grow to $32B by 2018. Touch layer (Unipixel's
market) is generally about 85% of this. This is the target market size.


2. I don't work at Unipixel so I can't say for certain if the technology is ready for mass production. However the
company has guided that they will be producing 60,000 units a month by April 2013 and ramping quickly from

there. To me, that sounds like mass production. This is based on the customer they signed in December, who
clearly thinks the technology is good.


3. 83 patents in application - at least 20 filed in the past 6-12 months. Many, if not most, are related to the
touch screens / UniBoss.

In my opinion there are many great articles on Seeking Alpha, and many not-so-great articles. It would be
impossible and borderline unethical for the editors of Seeking Alpha to only allow articles through that they
thought were 'best' as it would involve bias. Therefore, it is up to the users to:


1. Only write the best, well researched articles 
2. Apply common sense and due diligence to filter out the bad articles


I wrote the article you linked to, and performed a significant amount of research first. I believe it to be well-
written and accurate.


This article is full of contradicting statements, which leads me to believe that the author didn't do solid
research but instead attempted to bash Unipixel as much as possible based on merit-less statements.

"Cambrios, with its 73 patents filed or approved directly related to the technology, makes Uni-Pixel's claim on patent
strength outright laughable"


Excerpt from a press release titled "Uni-Pixel Granted Additional Patents Strengthening Its Portfolio of Intellectual
Property" (Link: http://prn.to/U8qY5h):


"To date, Uni-Pixel, Inc. has proposed a total of sixty two (62) patent applications of which forty seven (47) are
pending or published. Additionally thirteen (13) patents have been issued and two (2) allowed for a total of fifteen (15)
patents"


so UNXL has 47 patents pending and 15 already granted/allowed for a total of 62. UNXL's 62 vs. Cambrios' 73 --
"laughable" might be a bit harsh/misleading, "comparable" sounds more fitting. Nice hit piece.

So at all is clear that big display market is developing exponentially; 
And ITO is not suited for big display;the same for silver because its cost.Then you have a market developping

I found your article highly deceptive.


You start off by claiming “The true market opportunity is much smaller.” Then you precede to tell us you will present
“overwhelming” evidence to support this notion. I found your analysis to be underwhelming and misleading. As your
primary argument you noted a company presentation where they had shown the market opportunity as less than
$800mn in 2016. You and I both know that the slide you showed referred only to the mobile market. In fact, if you look
at the same presentation on page 12, you see an estimate of $10bn for the sensors in 2016. Note that this is old info,
and the market has grown much faster than expected so these numbers are actually low. Look at Display Search for
their recent estimate and you’ll see that the number for 2016 is now $17bn.


Next you cite research from Nanomarkets. I read Nanomarkets research in my due diligence as well. To tell you the
truth, I found the little Glen Allen, Virginia based firm to be out of touch with what was going on in the market. My
discussions with scientists and engineers in the market confirmed this suspicion. Nanomarket’s seemingly positive
bias toward the nanomaterial ito-replacement technologies could be influenced by the fact that their clients are
all/most nano industry participants! Silver nanowire is for real. Cambrios is a good firm with good prospects. But
Cambrios’s manufacturing processes rely on much of the high cost infrastructure that got us into problems in the first
place.


Nanomarkets can talk about the market opportunity for “alternatives” being 100 million dollars until it is blue in the
face, but that won’t change the fact that UniPixel has a signed order for almost $1bn worth of product. Dell must not
have gotten Nanomarkets message that the market was supposed to be so tiny!

You question the credentials of a senior sell-side research analyst because his industry is clean tech and not tech. But
why shouldn't we discount your word/research? You're an Analyst at RBC in the ECM group, you're publishing
research for the first time, and you've started working just 9 months ago. Looking into companies like this is what Mike
Malouf is paid to do for 40 hours+ a week. Sure, they don't get it right all the time (dot com bubble, housing bubble,
any asset bubble), but they certainly have more connections and resources at their disposal than you or I do. What
you present to us is a frankenstein of dated research and slanted analysis (the most glaring of which is your
comparison of patents filed by Cambrios vs. UNXL that claims UNXL's patent portfolio is "laugable". In May 2011,
UNXL already had 62 patents filed (13 of which were issued and 2 of which were allowed). Today, they have over 80
pending. I'd say "comparable" is a better adjective). Good day, sir.

2. When negative information comes to light, you see the same "long" guys go on and stick with their story without the
slightest acknowledgement of the underlying problems.  
3. Sometimes, you have a complicit management which has a lot to gain from pumping the stock. Frankly, if UNXL
does have a real multi-million dollar deal signed and is on track to make 120 million in revenue with 50% gross margin
this year. My story should be least of its concerns. The stock will go through the roof regardless of what I say...So
there's no need for an indirect press release through Mr.Hofmann or whatever other channel to say my article is
misleading. 
4. Another article, with largely the same content as Mr. Hofmann's article appear immediately after my article in an
attempt to support stock price. It tells me at least somebody's terrified at the prospect of a lower stock price. It doesn't
take much to see which side is more biased. 
5. To all the momo traders out there, buyer beaware. It's a pump and dump scheme and there's a eventual dump. Get
ready for that so the manipulators aren't going to dump all the stocks to you.


This will be the last message I leave for the article. It's pointless to waste my time or energy to argue with anybody
supposedly "long" the stock. Good luck if you are really longing the stock after reading the story though! I really don't
mind where the stock goes tomorrow cuz I know where it will be 2-3 months from now. Cautious investing to all!

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Mr. Zhou, you continue to fight against yourself.


1. You make the faulty assumption that UNXL is a pump-and-dump.


2. These 'same long guys' are all acknowledging your erroneous material and disputing it. It is you who fails
to defend it and instead continue to preach UNXL as a pump-and-dump


3. The press release was not through me. I had heard this rumor as well and was frankly astonished. I
immediately contacted Benzinga and asked them who was the 'spokesperson' for Unipixel. They immediately
pointed out that it was the PR firm Liolios Group, which is the firm that provides PR/IR services for Unipixel.


4. The article that appeared after your article was likely submitted before your article ever appeared. Every
author on SA knows that there is a good 24 hour (or more) delay between submission and publication. To
ignore this is simply more deceit on your part.


5. Again, you are pushing the 'pump-and-dump' theme without actually refuting the bullish case or defending
your bearish case - see your own point 2.


11 Jan 2013, 09:12 AM


kowtowcow
This is just silly.


1.) i agree -- this is a criteria for a pump and dump, but it doesn't make every stock with lots of long investors
and positive articles about it a pump and dump stock. you think maybe it's just a stock with potential?


2.) no one disagrees with you on all of your points, just the points that are inaccurate.

3.) management ALWAYS has a lot to gain from an increase in share price, because the majority of their all-in
salary is probably paid in stock (alignment of incentives). i don't know about hofmann's "indirect press," but i
commented because a lot of what you said seemed misinformed and designed to attack the company. you
are short the stock and just so happened to release a hit piece (not an objective article) on Seeking Alpha
where there are more than 80K people getting emails/alerts on tech stocks and 600+ people for specifically
UNXL (amazing distribution). the stock is fragile because a lot of its price moves have been based on the
UNXL's potential (and thus speculative in nature), and you took advantage of that. good timing, but i'd argue
that you are just as dastardly as the UNXL management team that you've been trying to vilify.


4.) it takes a while for SA authors to get articles published -- at least 24 hours in most cases. given that it was
originally released yesterday around 8pm EST, i highly doubt that article (Link here: http://bit.ly/URub9n) was
written AFTER yours was published.


Instead of announcing that you won't be responding to comments anymore after reiterating what you've
already said in your hit piece, how about actually responding to the concerns of the people who took the time
to read and comment on your article? You still haven't address comments regarding UNXL's patents or its
partnerships with legitimate companies such as TI and and Carestream, etc who, might i remind you, through
their due diligence prior to partnership agreements, were privy to knowledge that is not available to the
investing public.


PS - your graph titled "Summary of Eight Year Forecast of Transparent Conducive Materials" is missing some
of its key/legend. I count 8 colors in the graph and only 6 in the legend, most notably the dark blue at the
bottom that represents the largest piece of the market for each year through 2019. ITO only accounts for a
small green sliver that's barely visible to the naked eye.

I'm not staying long in this stock but I don't see your bearishness on this to create a short panic. That was pretty
irresponsible to be honest but hey you aren't the first to do that. Then again, you did say you shorted the stock and we
all see things differently. I don't short but I don't hold things for long as I am not a buy and hold guy. I am a day trader.
I just don't try and tilt to make it fit my plan.


10 Jan 2013, 11:31 PM

Unipixel reminds me of a company called e.Digital. They made mp3 player prototypes in 1999-2000. These prototype
deals included licensing options of their "revolutionary" MicroOS to un-named (sound familiar?) "Billion dollar OEMs."
MicroOS benefits included "lower power consumption" (sound familiar?) The speculation that they would actually
receive this licensing revenue spiked their share price from 6 cents to $23. However, they never actually made a dime
from licensing their "technology" and the stock is now trading back down to 14 cents.


Now I can't say whether Unipixel has the goods or not. But as the author says, they are up against MUCH bigger
players in this arena. Just because they are "working to develop" something with an again "unnamed" PC
manufacturer doesn't mean squat until it is actually produced and SOLD.

Bottom-line is, until actual revenue is booked I would be very cautious in believing the hype here.


11 Jan 2013, 12:07 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Did e.Digital have partnerships with named multi-billion dollar companies like Texas Instruments, Carestream,
and N-Trig? Did they have multiple analysts covering their stock and rating them as a Strong Buy?


11 Jan 2013, 09:07 AM


katgod
I won't put to much stock in the fact that TI works with them. It means TI sees them as a customer for their
drivers and TI is being smart by covering possible emerging technology, I don't think that this is a strong
endorsement of this particular technology. I am not saying this means the stock is worthless I am just saying
don't read too much into this "partnership"


13 Jan 2013, 09:50 PM


johnpalpha
Why yes. Yes they did on both counts. e.Digital had many "partnerships." Including ones with Texas
Instruments and Lucent Technologies. How's this for a PR Headline from 1999?


"Lucent Teams With eDigital, TI on Secure Rival to MP3"


And what was the licensing revenue e.Digital derived from teaming up with Lucent and TI? $0


"Teams with," "Partnering," "Working with", etc. are all basically marketing weasel words. I could say I'm
"partnering" with Microsoft after installing Windows on my PC. Does that mean MS has developed something
specifically for me? No, of course not. The same goes for TI. They have not and are not developing anything
solely for Uni-Pixel. Exactly as katgod says below...Texas Instruments is glad for any company to use their
technology, the same way e.Digital used their DSP when they made their prototype mp3 players.


Oh Chris, you believe in analyst "strong buy" ratings? How how long have you been investing? How did
previous analyst "strong buy" ratings work out for you?


At this juncture, there are simply too many red flags here. My BS detector alarm bells have gone off several
times reading the hype surrounding Uni-Pixel. Until actual product is sold and revenues are booked, this
company is nothing more than a gamble.


When e.Digital stock spiked the execs sold several millions in options. Really telling will be if Uni-Pixel execs
sell their options or not.


In a nutshell: DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!


Disclosure: Currently I have no position in UNXL but I have successfully traded it several times both long and
short over the past few weeks.

fit. I don't think there is any other company out there with a cutting edge pixel display technology in their Real Estate

make the US housing market go BOOM in 2013. Better back up the truck on this one before the smell knock you out.

I'm cautious on this investment now that this article is out. However, I'd just like to say that Berkshire
Hathaway was originally a textile company and now it's a large investment holding company. So you never
know.... I currently feel there is not enough information to draw a decisive conclusion that this is a scam. I
would just hold off on buying more. And am definitely seeking more information. I would like to know the name
of the company that bought Uni Pixel technology. Anyone have an article that says Dell is the OEM??? I think
I read about the guess. But I am looking for the facts. Thanks!


11 Jan 2013, 03:12 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
The company has not announced that Dell was the OEM as the OEM wanted secrecy. However, I have
spoken with several people close to the company who state that it is Dell. This is just a rumor, but it seems
very viable. I have also heard rumors that they are very close to a deal with a 'chinese handset manufacturer'
- probably ZTE, maybe Huawei.

Transcend Asset, Contributor
Interesting. I do understand that some companies never share their client list. I'm in favor of monitoring UNXL
until its next earnings report. Then maybe just buying it again. Anyone got a tour of their plant? Because of
the comments going on, now I want to know if they even have a facility setup for production. I am wondering
what stops management from issuing more shares if they have such a hot stock going. You would think that is
the logical step to take to support their growth. Any idea what NDA stands for? When I first found UNXL on
Google, their name says Uni Pixel (NDA). I still don't know what that is. Investopedia describes NDA as non-
disclosure agreement. If that were so, I didn't know a company could be setup that way and yet be publicly
traded. I thought companies had to disclose certain items in order to stay on the SEC's good side. Maybe I
don't understand this particular investment. It is too hazy for my liking. I will just hold a tiny sliver for the
upside potential but not load up for more. Hope you can shed some light on this one! Here is the link in
question: http://bit.ly/100ZCmG


14 Jan 2013, 07:28 AM


SamsaricSufferer
Let me get my opinion, point of view, and prejudices out of the way first. I am long UNXL. I do not question the
motives of either Chris Hoffman or Xuhua Zhou. They have both posted what are polar opposite views of UNXL. They
both are new and unproven authors without an established history by which to judge their work. Anyone who is
making investment decisions based on their work is foolish. This is not meant to malign either author. They both
present their case using hyperbolic adjectives like "Gruesome" and statements like Mr. Hoffman's title " Uni-Pixel:
Possibly The Best Investment For 2013". Some of Mr. Zhou's data is obviously dated and as such are materially
incorrect. I would point to one fact. Windows 8 was notable for it's inclusion of touch screen input capabilities as it's
the single biggest improvement and seed change over previous versions of Windows. If Mr. Softy thinks touch is
important, it is important. They may get to the game late these last few decades but they always get there. As a
statement of constructive criticism for both of you. It would improve your articles if you took a more measured tone in
both articles.


Now more dispassionate information:


Abstraction of some of the information from "NPD DisplaySearch 2012 Touch Panel Market Analysis."


They projected last year a close to $25B market by 2014.


Direct quote from report, emphasis added:


“Demand is growing for THINNER, LIGHT WEIGHT, AND LOW COST TOUCH PANELS AND DEVICES. In addition,
we see strong touch screen growth over the next several years in larger display applications such as
convertible/hybrid notebook PCs and all-in-one PCs,” noted Jennifer Colegrove, PhD, Vice President of Emerging
Display Technologies at NPD DisplaySearch. “Over the next few years, in-cell, on-cell, and sensor-on-cover touch
technologies will surpass the add-on type projected capacitive touch.”

11 Jan 2013, 07:09 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
SamsaricSufferer,


Thank you for your comment in reference to me. In my defense (and probably Mr. Zhou's as well), headlines
are often hyperbolic to grab attention, get views, and facilitate the dissemination of the information presented
within the article.


While my article does include many large price expectations ($147 per share and up over 12-24 months), I
fully believe that Unipixel is able to increase to this value if they execute on their business plan - which seems
likely. I'm sure you feel the same way, since you're long the stock.


There is another great article out today (originally last night), that includes some excellent research. I highly
suggest you read it as it is very well written.


Best of luck to you and all, 
Chris

Michael Orwin, Contributor
Chris, I've no problem with your title " Uni-Pixel: Possibly The Best Investment For 2013". I understand
Seeking Alpha jazz the title up anyway if they think it's dull. They probably thought about deleting 'Possibly' :).
Anyone who confuses title with widely agreed fact should subscribe to science site physorg.com until they
learn.


I also don't mind genuine enthusiasm, as a reader it can help, and as an investor or speculator I ignore it. Its
the facts and argument that matter, apart from those I want you to say what you think and not tone it down to
sound measured.

The only real question for me now, is whether UniPixel can really produce product or not? And on what scale. When I
had originally invested in UniPixel, I had the belief that rolls of the product were coming off an assembly line
somewhere. This apparently, was wishful thinking on my part. Is there even one roll? For now, UniPixel has become a
highly speculative play, nothing more. I'm awake now. Thanks.

I would be VERY CAUTIOUS about sell side research on this name. MDB and Craig Hallum are SMALL investment
banks that ONLY put buy ratings on small caps - They are looking for the underwriting business of secondary
offerings and CANNOT put a sell on a company or they would get no business from them...this is very widely known.


Green river - I am VERY surprised you don't know this and you trust research from biased small banks looking for
biz... You say you are a "hedge fund manager" and don't know the motives of these small firms? That is a BIG joke.


Mike Malouf - the analyst that covers UNXL for Craig Hallum is a HEALTHCARE analyst - http://bit.ly/XwCuIo - You
trust this guy to "rank" a NANOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY's PATENT portfolio? Wow.


Patents - XUHUA IS ACCURATE. If you search for UNXL on the patent website - http://1.usa.gov/11tubSm -


they have results but are just MENTIONED in other patent filings. "One such company is Uni-Pixel Displays, Inc., Inc.
of Houston Tex" THIS IS NOT THEIR PATENT - do the deep dive gentlemen. This company sold nearly all of their
patents.


STOCK VESTING - stock options tied to the price of the stock are vesting jan 28th..To be clear - they can sell vested
shares, and they will. They also have other options that go to 2015 - far away so I dont look at this as "25%" of their
options are vesting. They have a chance to sell over 1MM SHARES. The second management files to sell shares
(which is a few days delayed and they will have already sold), this stock is going to be below 5$.


Guys - this is a SCAM. Get out. Sure...scams can last and might go higher in the near term, but this company is worth
0. I would bet that hoffman is employed by UNXL or being compensated in some way by management/company. He
is sitting on a computer spamming seekingalpha and yahoo message boards. this is the only company that hoffman
and many other commenters have posted on. Very prompt responses.


STOCK WORTH 0 - get the hell out.

As for the patents, if you spell it correctly, two patents come up under Unipixel's name. As discussed, there
are other databases and, more importantly, they have 83 patents currently in application.

Auction 12 reminds me about the high powered lawyers, which reminds me that UniPixel won't become profitable until
they roll out product. And profitability sounds like a long ways off. I can imagine UniPixel may already be exploring
ways to raise more cash to pay lawyer fees and for other costs should UniBoss become producible.


One way to raise cash of course would be a secondary stock offering. Hopefully the high powered lawyers will win
and their fees will be included in any settlement.


Am I correct to wonder whether UniPixel at some point needs to raise cash through a secondary stock offering?

Unipixel has repeatedly said that they should not need anymore secondary offerings due to their $15M in
cash, $0 debt, and preferred pricing arrangements. They expect to be cash-flow positive by the end of Q2,
possibly sooner if partnerships move faster.

Chris, Looks like I get one point and you lose one. Me for thinking UniPixel would need a secondary offering.
This is why you shouldn't take for gospel everything UniPixel says. Please take this in good jest.

There is a pattern with this company...


Let’s start in 2008 when Uni-Pixel was a flat panel display company. This seems rather convenient given the
proliferation of LCD/Plasma screen TVs at that time. They claimed to have a better, most cost efficient, energy
reducing technology called TMOS which would beat out LCD and Plasma as the leading technology. They trumpeted
the huge growing market and the strong technological advantages that would drive them to be the market leader.


To follow up this sensationalized BS, they touted partnerships with many OEMs to develop and manufacture the
TMOS technology. They announced that Lockheed Martin was granted exclusive partnership rights for development
of the technology for military use. Other ‘partners’ included Philips and a ‘large OEM’ (Source: 2007 10-k). Up to this
point they spent 14.3 million on R&D and had NO revenue.


Early in 2008 the stock price triples only to return to new lows shortly after.


Also, in 2008 they announced the development of Opcuity which is a finger print resistant film for use with touch
screen devices. In December 2008, the company announces it will collaborate with a ‘large Japanese manufacturing

company’ for both Opcuity and it’s TMOS technology (Source: Dec 17, 2008 8-k). Next, they announce a partnership
with Samsung (it’s a Korean company so not the Japanese company they were talking about before). This
‘partnership’ never amounted to any revenue or manufacturing.  
In 2009 it seemed to completely abandon its TMOS technology and move to its Opcuity technology, announcing
various partnerships and ‘collaborations’ with OEMs, research facilities, and touting the product at numerous trade
shows.


From the October 1 8-K: On October 1, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing that it has received its
first purchase orders for film products and has reached agreements with two high volume film production companies
to rapidly advance the production process for its Opcuity films to meet growing demand opportunities. Today’s
announcement further signals the company’s success in achieving a number of significant milestones as it transitions
from a development stage company to a commercial manufacturing business.


Obviously the company never made it to be a ‘commercial manufacturing business’. Still not a cent of revenue for any
of these ‘breakthrough’ technologies’.


On May 18th the company unveils UniBoss, and touts its low-cost, energy efficient capabilities and goes on to
describe the massive market that it will overtake.


Does this sound familiar?


Over the course of 2010 and 2011 it announced numerous partnerships, collaborations, and joint ventures with
numerous groups and companies including, RAMBUS, TARGUS, SKYFIBER, and Texas instruments. They also
announced number trade shows it will be attending. Still not even 200K of revenue by 2012 for all of this effort and
hype.


There is a definite pattern here. They tout some new technology that goes along with the flavor of the week and hype
it up with vague announcements of partnerships, collaborations, etc. This is all just marketing mumbo jumbo. All the
while they are granting stock options and financing with dilutive convertible debt well below market price.


This is a scam until proven otherwise. Period.

I will admit I did short this stock just recently and covered this morning because of the dark cloud surrounding this
company. With everyone so bullish I took the opposite trade. I am thinking of going long and should have this
morning...

Since you are already short, your article definitely made you a ton of money.

Author’s reply »  Reed resigned...Too much irony..almost exactly one year after I published the piece. Looks like this
scam has finally run its course..

Mr Z, you certainly deserve recognition now the end is getting nearer. You were certainly attached and vilified,
as were most everyone else trying to put up a red flag or two. Kudos for your early warnings. I hope you
made enough money off of shorting UNXL to further your goals. Still hasn't dropped back below $5 yet,
though, has it?

One of the best "short" article in SA. I changed my mind after read it. Sold all my position and never re-entered my
position. Wait to see real products no matter how bright it seems.
