Neoprobe: Why I'm Closing My Short Position
Aug. 5, 2011 11:11 AM ET11 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


I am closing my short recommendation for Neoprobe (NEOP) at $2.00. I think the
risk/reward of shorting NEOP is not so favorable as to initiate a short. I still think the stock
has more downside. I have material concerns about the study design and study results of
Lymphoseek.


I also think sales of Lymphoseek will be tiny. However, I cannot in good faith recommend
shorting Neoprobe to you at this price. I do not think being long makes sense, either,
however. If I found myself in a position where I was long Neoprobe, I would sell and move
on to my two other published long ideas: Biomarin (NASDAQ:BMRN) and Chelsea
(NASDAQ:CHTP).


Neoprobe was $5.25 when I submitted my article to Seeking Alpha. Today it is $2.00, a
decline of 61%. I believe in all of my other published ideas and will inform you in this
manner when I "close" them. Hopefully, this way, I will build an online "track record" for
you, the general public. I am not perfect and I will make lots of mistakes. Picking stocks is
a journey for information and opinions and together I think we can succeed.


Disclosure: I am short NEOP.


Additional disclosure: I may change my position at any time without notifying Seeking
Alpha.

Why stop now? 
Especially with a depressed market lately? 
Quite odd indeed.

Nope, that is a smart move. He made quite a call. He will move to the next target now, and NEOP will slowwwwlly
recover to the $5-$7 range.

Being on the Russell is now whats hurting NEOP, since the markets are tanking so will the Russell and NEOP. If they
were still "unknown" thye'd probably be a good bit higher. IMO

Marty, You need to provide proof of your 50% profit payment to a charity. You publicly stated you'd make this payment
and you need to hold to your word and provide proof. Use SA to communicate and it provide them proof so that can
communicate proof of payment.


Agreed!??!

Author’s reply »  I haven't covered. Seeking Alpha got the title wrong (the editors often write the title). I also
get paid like other fund managers - at the end of the year. I get 20% of profits. So we'll talk then!

I was doing very well on this stock. As soon as it hit its high there was a challenge to its Lymphoseek test results filed
with the FDA. The next day the stock tanked,and has been declining ever since. Then I come to find out that the party
that filed the challenge had a short position on the stock,and had a lot (profit)to gain from the stocks fall. This
scientifically unfounded challenge stinks to high heaven,and should be looked at by the FTC.
