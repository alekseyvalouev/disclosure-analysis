Fushi Copperweld: A Christmas present from the China
Development Bank and Abax Captial to arb funds
For the record: I lost on this one. See SEC filing... 
 
 
Fushi Copperweld - a small cap Chinese stock specializing in bimetallic wire - is going private -
purchased by "Green Dynasty" - a vehicle funded by Abax Capital and China Development Bank. The
deal was supposed to close in the week of 11 December 2012 according to a press release filed with
the SEC. 
 
It never closed.
 
The following Monday (before market) Fushi released an update regarding the merger. The press
release has so far not been filed with the SEC. To quote: "[b]ased on information provided by Green
Dynasty, the Company anticipates closing of the transaction by or on Monday, December 24, 2012." 
 
If the deal closes it will be a nice Christmas present from the Chinese to various arb funds because
this deal has had a fat spread for much of its existence. 
 
History of this transaction
 
This transaction has history. It was first proposed by the chairman in November 2010 at $11.50 - but
later withdrawn. The Chairman came back with a $9.25 offer and revised that offer to $9.50 which
was accepted. 
 
The stock is not without controversy. Muddy Waters (of Sino Forest fame) has alleged Fushi is a
fraud. Bronte was short a small amount well before the Muddy Waters announcement (and shorted
the original $11.50 offer) because the accounts were a little unusual. This was a stock on which we
won-some, we lost some. 
 
Even if the company is a fraud that does not mean the deal will not close. There were credible
allegations of fraud against Harbin Electric and the accounts were decidedly funky - but the deal did
close and many shorts (including Bronte) received a nastier than usual flogging. 
 
Moreover Harbin was taken private by Abax Capital backed by China Development Bank. The same
combination taking Fushi private. That I am short again (and in this time in quantity) indicates that I
am some kind of masochistic sucker for punishment. 
 
Why fraudulent Chinese companies were taken private 
 
There is a theory as to why some Chinese companies with fraudulent accounts were taken private.
About a decade ago you could not buy industrial land around Shanghai and other cities unless you
had a business to put on that land. 
 
So people invented fictional businesses to buy real land. 
 
Later they reverse merged those fictional businesses into the US and sold shares in the fictional
businesses. In some cases the land appreciated enough to make the stock worthwhile even though
the accounts are fictional. I know this to be true in at least one case (a case on which I lost money). I
am not sure whether it is true of Harbin but Harbin Electric did own lots of land. 
 
There is another reason why Chinese companies are taken private. And that is the operation was
originally the children of Chinese elites ripping off Western stock markets (by selling fraudulent
stocks). When that no longer worked they had no shame. Now they ripped off Chinese banks by
getting them to finance LBOs. I know of at least one fraud run by a child of a central committee
member that received a bid from a well connected Chinese private equity fund.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Fushi Copperweld: A Christmas present from the China Development Bank and Abax Captial to arb funds


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/12/fushi-copperweld-christmas-present-from.html 2/5


 
Back to Fushi Copperweld.  
 
The Fushi Copperweld saga is long running. Now it is a simple question of whether the deal will close
and today is the day of truth. 
 
It is likely to close. It is not over until the fat-lady sings - but she is clearing her throat. 
 
But imagine it does not close. Then it will likely be because the fraud allegations are substantially
correct and the stock should eventually trade at pennies. There will be a few arb funds with some
'splaining to do. (See this disclosure from Centaurus Capital for an example.) 
 
Boiler plate 
 
When examining situations like this its best to read the boiler plate. 
 
The boiler plate in various disclosures has changed recently. 
 
A press release dated 28 June 2012 and filed with the SEC says categorically: 


There is no financing condition to completion of the merger. Mr. Fu and Abax have
secured fully committed debt financing from China Development Bank Corporation
Hong Kong Branch to finance the transaction.


The press release of 11 December 2012 says that the deal will close "this week" (a week now well
and truly past). However it introduces a new paragraph into the boiler-plate forward looking
statements. 


A number of the matters discussed herein that are not historical or current facts deal
with potential future circumstances and developments, in particular, whether and when
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated. The
discussion of such matters is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties
surrounding future expectations generally and also may materially differ from actual
future experience involving any one or more of such matters. Such risks and
uncertainties include: any conditions imposed on the parties in connection with
consummation of the transactions described herein; satisfaction of various other
conditions to the closing of the transactions described herein; and the risks that are
described from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.


 
The press release of 17 December 2012 - the one not filed with the SEC - but which postpones
closing until 24 December says: 
 


"As previously announced, on December 11, 2012, the Company's stockholders
approved the Merger Agreement.  Green Dynasty has advised the Company that it is in
the process of effecting the satisfaction of all conditions to draw all necessary funds
pursuant to the facility agreement with the China Development Bank in order to
consummate the proposed merger.  Based on information provided by Green Dynasty,
the Company anticipates closing of the transaction by or on Monday, December 24,
2012."


 
"Effecting the satisfaction of all conditions necessary to draw all necessary funds" is a somewhat
weaker statement than "there is no financing condition to completion of the merger". 
 
All I can say for the arb funds involved. This better close. Or you are holding a very weak hand
indeed. 
 
But then I have never seen a deal fail so near the line. It should close and by close of business today
the stock will have disappeared and shareholders will be entitled to receive $9.50 per share from the
clearing corporation. And I will have lost a few pennies on my short (just in time for Christmas). 
 
Whatever happens - I hope you all have a merry and safe Christmas (or festive season if Christmas is
not your thing).

PPS: On Friday - just before closing - the market got a little jittery about this. Check out the one-day
chart. Someone panicked. (I was shorting earlier in the week.)

Have you ever wondered why so many PE funds are participating in the taking private of

Abax - not sure but the relationship to CDB is family. 
 
Carlyle - well - Sun Yee On Triad. 
 
Bain & Co. They did a really good deal where land was the underlying value - even
though company was a fraud. 
 
TPG - serious due diligence. Offered for a fraud. Walked out. 
 
CITIC Capital - do deals to bail out friends of the communist party. Suckers game for
investors. 
 
Beyond that I have no opinions.

FSIN has always been a bit creative with the boilerplate. Remember this hilarious bit,

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Fushi Copperweld: A Christmas present from the China Development Bank and Abax Captial to arb funds


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/12/fushi-copperweld-christmas-present-from.html 4/5


Techniques Employed by Manipulative Short Sellers in Chinese Stocks May Drive Down
the Market Price of Our Common Stock 
 
 
 
Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather
has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical
securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from
a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and
the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that
purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short sellerâs best interests
for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as âdisclosed
shortsâ) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant
issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and
generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. While traditionally these
disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to
otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological
advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog
(âbloggingâ) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a companyâs credibility,
strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of
investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firm and independent research
analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on
occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the
PRC and who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels
than U.S. domestic large-cap stocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks. 
 
 
 
These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory
organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to the certification
requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation AC
(Regulation Analyst Certification) and the opinions they express may be based on
distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications. The financial information
contained in the Companyâs PRC subsidiariesâ filings with the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) are consistent with the financial information contained in
the Companyâs SEC filing. However, the Company believes there may be fabricated SAIC
reports which may be used by the short sellers to attack the Company. 
 
 
 
While we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks,
oftentimes we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state
law (often called âAnti-SLAPP statutesâ), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the
manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should be aware
that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy â oftentimes
blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements â should we
be targeted for such an attack, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly
long term, decline in market price should the rumors created not be dismissed by market
participants. 
 
That little bit was one of the oddest bits of 10k legal nonsense I've ever come across,
basically the closest you will find to a giant blinking red neon "Fraud Is Here" light.
