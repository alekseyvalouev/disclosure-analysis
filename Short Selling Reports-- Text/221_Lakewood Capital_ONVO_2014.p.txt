Organovo On The Block As Hedge Fund Shorts Pile UP In 3D
Printing


February 11, 2014 3:45 pm  by Mark Melin


s noted in previous ValueWalk articles here and here, the 3D printing market continues to �nd


hedge fund short sellers, who now appear to be piling on the beleaguered and, some fund


managers say, over-hyped category with increasing regularity.


The latest to trash 3D printing high stock valuations was hedge fund Lakewood Capital Management. 


In a letter to investors reviewed by ValueWalk, Lakewood’s  Anthony T. Bozza mocks the hype,


commenting on one of its short in the category: “Perhaps no company has ever positioned itself at the


intersection of two hotter industries than Organovo Holdings Inc (NYSEMKT:ONVO), which appears to


be both a 3D printing and biotech play at the same time. In our �rst quarter 2013 letter, I highlighted


Uni-Pixel as a company that possessed as many traits that we seek in a short as we had ever seen (the


stock is down over 70% since). Organovo might be a close second.”

5/21/2018 Organovo On The Block As Hedge Fund Shorts Pile UP In 3D Printing


https://www.valuewalk.com/2014/02/organovo-on-the-block-as-hedge-fund-shorts-pile-up-in-3d-printing/ 2/5


Noting an absurd market capitalization with correspondingly high levels of investment in


R&D synonymous with so many in the category, the letter points out that Organovo had


36 full time employees, $1 million in property and equipment and had spent $11 million


cumulatively on R&D since inception in 2007. The stock has nearly tripled since last summer


to recent levels around $10 per share, representing a market capitalization of nearly $1


billion.  


The letter notes Organovo is optimistic in regards to selling bioprinted tissues with the �rst


such product being a 3D liver assay product for use in research labs during drug development


by pharmaceutical companies. Organovo believes this product will be in high demand by major


pharmaceutical companies.


“We are skeptical,” the letter notes. “Our research indicates Organovo is just one of several groups


working on such a product, and the machines are relatively easy to build and have been around for a


while. Many pharmaceutical companies build their own 2-D cultures, so if they are dissatis�ed with


the existing protocols, one might imagine they can a�ord to match Organovo’s cumulative R&D spend


of $11 million to make a 3-D culture (Eli Lilly, the smallest of the large cap U.S. pharmaceuticals


companies spends $15 million per day on R&D). Furthermore, a general protocol for drug development


that includes the use of 2-D cultures for toxicity has been in place for over a decade and is going to be


very di�cult to change to 3-D cultures.”


Personal attacks on Organovo
The attack on Organovo doesn’t end at the company balance sheet, it gets personal.  “Some


bullish investors have claimed that Organovo might one day even print human organs which, if


true, would make Organovo Holdings Inc (NYSEMKT:ONVO) a major step up for CFO Barry


Michaels who previously served as the CFO of two public companies that have both since


been delisted,” the letter snarks. “Furthermore, one might wonder why two of Organovo’s founders,


Gabor and Andras Forgacs, would have left behind such a fascinating opportunity to start Modern


Meadow, a company whose ambition is to print meat and leather.”


But perhaps Lakewood’s most e�ective attack comes when pointing out the lack of sales. 


“Researching a company that has basically sold nothing can be a challenging task,” the letter


dryly noted,  “but we were lucky enough to have found one university professor (and


prominent tissue researcher) who had evaluated Organovo’s machine for purchase.”  When


Lakewood asked the researcher why she never purchased from Organovo Holdings Inc


(NYSEMKT:ONVO), “she pointed out that it was cheaper to build the machine in-house with


‘a few grad students.’ When we asked her the total cost of the project, she estimated ‘tens of


thousands of dollars.’


War of the shorts continues unabated
But the issues don’t stop with Organovo Holdings Inc (NYSEMKT:ONVO)’s machines being


built more cost e�ectively by a group of grad students.  “Surely, a machine made by ‘a few


grad students’ would never match up against the revered product of a $1 billion market

capitalization company like Organovo,” the letter notes, setting up the punch line.  “We


asked the professor how much they had to sacri�ce in terms of quality by making it


themselves. She responded, “Oh no, our machine is better.”


And thus the war of the shorts in the 3D printing market continues unabated.

Jesus %&$^#, possibly the most grossly undeserving piece of research I've ever read (maybe that Citron piece
comes close). It's so full of lies and distortion that I'm embarrassed for the author. If you're shorting Organovo,
you're shorting the potential for better medicine for both humans and animals alike. (Not to mention it's almost
impossible to predict when the next piece of good news will hit, resulting in 5-10% pops at least...and the
management is good about PR!) I hope that Mr. Melin's conscious is clear after this abomination.
