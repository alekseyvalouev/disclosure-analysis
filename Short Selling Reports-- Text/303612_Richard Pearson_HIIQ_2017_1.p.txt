***  7 – 
 IMPLICATIONS OF
REJECTION IN
FLORIDA (ACTUAL VS
DISCLOSED)  
As we can see in that rejection letter


Summary
New data points: Fraud penalties expected to reach
$100 million or more. Other insurers required to
cease doing business with HIIQ as part of their
fraud settlements.
June 2017: HIIQ rejected for key insurance license
in home state of Florida as regulator uncovers
undisclosed legal actions against HIIQ insiders.
HIIQ privately warns of disastrous “domino effect”
spreading to other states, causing additional loss of
licenses. HIIQ makes no disclosure to investors.
Regulatory catalysts now approaching in October
2017.  Insiders have been publicly hyping the stock
while simultaneously dumping $50 million in shares.
HIIQ is nearly identical to �ve of my past trades
where Craig Hallum was on the other side.  They
each plunged by 80-100%. SEC investigations, fraud
suits and delistings.


Disclosure:  This article represents the opinion of the author.  The

****   2 –  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIIQ)) develops, distributes and
administers individual health and family insurance plans (“IFP”),
including short-term medical (“STM”) insurance plans and guaranteed-
issue and underwritten Health Bene�t Insurance Plans (also known as
“hospital indemnity” plans).


HIIQ designs these plans on behalf of insurance carriers and discount
bene�t providers and then markets them primarily through its internal
distribution network and an external distribution network of
independently owned call centers.

*** 3 –  INVESTMENT  THESIS
The theme I will show repeatedly below is one of “delay,
downplay, dismiss, deny” which then allows insiders to
aggressively dump their shares.

7/5/2019 Short HIIQ. Fraud penalties to exceed $100 million and undisclosed “domino effect” - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 3/29


Over the past 7 months, shares of HIIQ rose from below $5.00 to over
$35.00 – a seven bagger – despite only marginal apparent
improvements in its business.


During this time, revenue has increased slightly, and HIIQ has
successfully managed to lower its heavy dependence upon STM plans.
But this does nothing to absolve HIIQ of its massive undetermined
liabilities stemming from fraud investigations which now span fully 42
states
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm).
 And the problems then get worse from there.


HIIQ is now set to quickly plunge by at least 80% to $6.00 or below.
Such a decline would really just put HIIQ back to where it was right at
the time of the 2016 US election.  (see chart above)  In reality, I strongly
expect that there is a high likelihood that HIIQ ultimately plunges to
below $1.00 and faces delisting.   No, this is not an exaggeration. Keep
reading.


Consider the following:


HIIQ is now facing fraud investigations or cease and desist orders from
42 di�erent states.


Recently emerged data points now indicate that legal liability will be in
the range of $100 million or more (as opposed to the mere $1 million
number which has been published by certain authors who recently
spoke to HIIQ management).


On the heels of these mounting state fraud investigations, in June of
2017 HIIQ was just rejected for licensure
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808AAL-
070317-16455945.PDF) in its home state of Florida. In its appeal to the
regulator
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808PFAH-
070317-16455245.PDF) (also from June of 2017), HIIQ
then PRIVATELY cited to the regulator the specter of a disastrous
“domino e�ect”
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808PFAH-
070317-16455245.PDF) from this rejection by which licensing denials
will then spread to the other states in which HIIQ does business.


These were the actual very alarming words used by HIIQ
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808PFAH-
070317-16455245.PDF) to the regulator in June of 2017, yet this
impact was not disclosed to investors in the most recent 10Q
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm)or
anywhere else for that matter.


The scathing letter from the regulator cited multiple reasons for the
denial of the license, in direct contradiction with disclosure to
investors by HIIQ. For example, as part of its independent
background check, the regulator uncovered multiple undisclosed

legal actions against multiple HIIQ insiders. When confronted with
this by the regulator, HIIQ refused to respond.   Again, HIIQ disclosed
something very di�erent to investors.


Delay, downplay, dismiss, deny


HIIQ has retained an expensive law �rm and has now submitted, re-
submitted and appealed for this license at least 4 times over the course
of 2016 and 2017. Now that the �nal rejection is imminent, HIIQ has
somehow tried to suggest
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm) that
it doesn’t even need such a license in the �rst place.


As of the most recent disclosure, the Florida regulator is set to publish
its �nal determination in October 2017
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm) (a
few weeks from now).  For the sake of completeness, I have already
sent a copy of this entire article to the Florida regulator.


The slew of massive legal and regulatory problems facing HIIQ is set to
unravel in the very near term. There are multiple near term catalysts.
The most visible catalyst is coming in just a few weeks in October 2017.


HIIQ has repeatedly attempted to suggest that it is actually some other
party (such as HCC) that is being investigated or is at fault. Yet anyone
who reads the actual legal �lings can immediately see otherwise. In the
fraud complaints from 42 state governments, the repeated theme is that
HIIQ has engaged in fraudulent sales practices while operating without
a license.  And now HIIQ has brazenly attempted to suggest to
investors that maybe it just doesn’t need
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm) such
licenses at all.


And here is where it gets really interesting:


Even as HIIQ passionately encourages investors to buy, the insiders
have been aggressively dumping their own shares.  So far in 2017,
HIIQ insiders have dumped millions of shares taking in over $50
million.  Keep in mind that just a few months ago, the market cap
of the entire company was less than $200 million.  In November o�
2016, the market cap was just $70 million.


Notice that insiders were aggressively dumping a huge volume of
shares even when the price was more than 50% lower than the current
level, at just $14.   Selling has come from all corners, including the
founder, the CFO, CTO and the CEO of its Healthpocket division.

Delay, downplay, dismiss, deny


In fact, now that the legal consequences are rapidly closing in,
management’s actions are becoming downright blatant. Last week (on
Tuesday September 5 ), after the stock had suddenly dropped from
$37 to below $30, Craig Hallum put together a hastily arranged
conference call for management to reassure investors.  As expected,
the stock brie�y rebounded.  Just hours after this impromptu call
encouraging investors to buy, multiple members of management began
disclosing additional large share sales by insiders, quickly amounting to
$1.5 million over just two days.

found on Edgar)


                                        


As you read the magnitude of the problems below, keep in mind that
HIIQ has a cash balance of just $27.5 million
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm) with
which to run its entire business and then deal with all of these
impending liabilities.


The recently revealed data points indicate liability of $100 million or
more.


So you do the math !!


It will quickly become clear why I am saying that HIIQ has the potential
to drop to below $1.00 and face ultimate delisting.  Either way, given
the unfolding of the events above, a $6.00 share price will likely prove
generous by the time Florida makes public its decision in just a few
weeks.


This dire prediction for HIIQ is pretty much in line with what I had
predicted on �ve prior Craig Hallum trades. For reference, the �ve
companies were Unipixel (UNXL
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNXL)), Neonode (NEON
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEON)), Erickson Air Crane (EAC
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EAC)), TearLab (TEAR

7/5/2019 Short HIIQ. Fraud penalties to exceed $100 million and undisclosed “domino effect” - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 7/29


Just like HIIQ, each of these past stocks had quickly spiked by 200-
800% following gushing support from Craig Hallum. As the share prices
spiked, large share sales or equity o�erings then followed. As soon as I
exposed their terminal underlying business problems, each of these
stocks immediately plunged by 30% or more. Each of the stocks then
went on to by implode 80-100%, just as I predicted.  Among these �ve
companies, we then saw various combinations of SEC investigations,
fraud lawsuits, bankruptcy and/or delisting.  I am speci�cally including
below my �ve past articles which were speci�cally focused on past
Craig Hallum trades on similar toxic companies. I would strongly
encourage readers to have a look. The similarities to what we see with
HIIQ should become 100% obvious.


***   4 –  LOOKING AT FRAUD
INVESTIGATIONS FROM 42 DIFFERENT
STATES
Delay, downplay, dismiss, deny.


HIIQ is currently facing a tidal wave of fraud investigations, lawsuits and
cease and and desist orders which now already extend to at least 42
states (that we know about so far).


In March of 2016, here was the initial action taken by the state
of Arkansas Insurance Department
(https://insurance.arkansas.gov/news/2016/mar/28/kerr-issues-cease-
desist-order/) following a sting operation which revealed unlicensed
insurance sales in Arkansas. During additional calls,  “several”
company representatives misrepresented the insurance products in an
attempt to sell insurance plans, not realizing that the person calling was
actually The Arkansas Insurance Department.


Read this screenshot closely.

Within 60 days, in May of 2016, HIIQ had already received another
cease and desist from the State of Montana (http://csimt.gov/wp-
content/uploads/Temp-CD-Order-and-Summ-Jdgmt.pdf), requiring the
company to immediately cease and desist from selling insurance in the
State of Montana.


Delay, downplay, dismiss, deny.


In July of 2016, HIIQ �led a very lengthy 8K
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000149315216011658/form8-
k.htm) announcing the appointment of Gavin Southwell as President
and Josef Denother to serve as COO.  Within the 8K, HIIQ spent 4
pages elaborating in deep detail the most minute details of the terms of
employment for these two.  And then buried in the 8K
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000149315216011658/form8-
k.htm), 4 pages in, HIIQ included a single small paragraph disclosing
the commencement of a multi-state investigation being headed by the
State of Indiana.  And now �nally the company disclosed the Arkansas
and Montana legal actions from months earlier. But by this time, anyone
who actually made it through to page 4 of this 8K could see that the
investigations had expanded to include Arkansas, Florida, Kansas,
Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, and Massachusetts.


When HIIQ ultimately chose to provide more detail on these
investigations in March of 2017
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000149315217002078/form10-

among many players. Here is how HIIQ described the Montana fraud
complaint. Keep reading and decide for yourself if this is an
accurate representation or if it is wildly misleading.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/11/4238561-
15051142747545524_origin.png)


HIIQ speci�cally emphasized that it was “among more than two
dozen separate parties named”.  But the reality is that the other
parties being named in this Montana action (http://csimt.gov/wp-
content/uploads/Notice-of-PAA.pdf) were largely being named as a
result of the fact that they were doing business with HIIQ.


According to Montana (http://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Notice-of-
PAA.pdf):


These policies are routinely sold though misinformation and
deception at the point of sale by individuals not properly
licensed or appointed in Montana to conduct this insurance
business.


“The HII scheme”


In fact, throughout this Montana action, the Montana State Auditor
refers to the fraud directly as “the HII scheme (http://csimt.gov/wp-
content/uploads/Notice-of-PAA.pdf)”.  The Montana fraud complaint
includes only two graphics (http://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Notice-
of-PAA.pdf) throughout its 25 pages. Both of these graphics speci�cally
map out HIIQ’s role in the scheme, without any mention whatsoever
of the “two dozen” other players emphasized by HIIQ.


Here are the ONLY TWO GRAPHICS from the Montana fraud
complaint, both of which focus ONLY on HIIQ.

In a recent article on Value Investors Club, the author had stated that
HIIQ has also ceased doing business with HCC Life Insurance.  He
seemed to think that this was a good thing.  But it now strikes me that
this termination was more likely result of the multi-state investigation
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm) being
headed by the State of Indiana naming HCC for its involvement with
HIIQ.


 This is really, really bad.


And then it gets even worse.


Multiple new data points relating to multiple states have recently
emerged (including using HIIQ’s own disclosure).  These now indicate
that legal liability could be in excess of $100 million (and potentially
much more).


In the recent 10K
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000149315217002078/form10-
k.htm), HIIQ noted that a penalty of $100,000 to $315,000 was
“probable” in the state of Montana. Such a low penalty caused the VIC
author above to be optimistic that total penalties would only be around
$1 million.


Here is the disclosure
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000149315217002078/form10-
k.htm) from HIIQ:

investigation period, HII is only said to have brought in revenues of
$503,800 (http://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Notice-of-PAA.pdf).


In other words, in its own estimation, it is “probable” that HIIQ will
be forced to pay in the area of 20-60% of its revenues that were
generated in Montana. 


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/11/4238561-
15051144255185623_origin.png)


Based on the past disclosure patterns from HIIQ, I believe I have a right
to be suspicious that the estimate provided by HIIQ is still too low.


This suspicion is entirely borne out by looking at the next settlement
(which HIIQ is obviously well aware of).


In the recent 10Q
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm),
HIIQ made reference to a recent settlement by a carrier for “the same
set of allegations” by the Massachusetts Attorney General (“MAG”). 
HIIQ did not name the party by name and it stated that it was too early
to predict any loss as it might apply to HIIQ.


In fact, HIIQ suggested that there may not be any loss at all !!

Actually, a quick legal search reveals that the party who settled
was Uni�ed Life (http://agencychecklists.com/2017/04/11/mass-ag-
stops-illegal-health-insurance-sales-and-recovers-2-8-million-from-

complaints in other states.  In fact, as part of Uni�ed’s fraud settlement
in Kansas
(http://www.ksinsurance.org/department/LegalIssues/orders/2017/Uni�ed%20Life.pdf) (“KID”),
an explicit term of the consent agreement was that it was “contingent

Once we know this information, we can see from Uni�ed’s settlement
(http://agencychecklists.com/2017/04/11/mass-ag-stops-illegal-health-

5% interest per annum !!

Over the various time periods in question, HIIQ has generated over
$300 million in total revenues. Feel free to make your own calculation
on how to apportion these revenues across the 42 states that are
currently investigating HIIQ and according to what portion of the
revenues are applicable to the various investigations.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/11/4238561-

What you will �nd is that even by stretching one’s optimism and
creativity, it is very di�icult to come up with a liability that is less
than $100 million, even using very conservative estimates.

7/5/2019 Short HIIQ. Fraud penalties to exceed $100 million and undisclosed “domino effect” - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 14/29


As of Q2, HIIQ had just $27.5 million in cash
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm). 
I expect that HIIQ will need to conduct a large equity o�ering in order to
meet these liabilities.  Even with its lofty current market cap of $500
million, this would present a meaningful challenge.  At much lower
market caps (such as the $200 million where HIIQ was just a few
months ago) an adequate equity o�ering becomes almost impossible.


But clearly HIIQ has the full support of Craig Hallum who continues to
enthusiastically recommend the stock despite the obvious problems.


***  6 –   THE SCATHING REJECTION
FROM FLORIDA’S INSURANCE
REGULATOR  
Just recently, in June of 2017, HIIQ was rejected by the Florida state
insurance regulator
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808AAL-
070317-16455945.PDF) over its application for a license to conduct
business as a 3  party administrator in Florida.  HIIQ then �led an
appeal
(https://www.doah.state.�.us/DocDoc/2017/003808/17003808PFAH-
070317-16455245.PDF), also in June of 2017.


Below is a screenshot showing how HIIQ chose to disclose this event to
investors in the recent 10Q
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561387/000162828017008097/hiiq_63017x10q.htm).
In short, we are supposed to believe from the disclosure that it is just
“no big deal”.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/11/4238561-
15051145764576359_origin.png)


Apparently, after the noti�cation of fraud investigations by 42 states
claiming unlicensed selling, HIIQ now tells us that it is taking a
“prudent” approach and seeking a license in Florida.  HIIQ states that it
was only rejected because “the company had not yet provided all
information required”.  HIIQ notes that the denial is under appeal, set
to be �nalized in October.  In fact, maybe the Florida OIR won’t even
require a license at all !!


With such muted and understated disclosure, it is no surprise that
seemingly no one has even noticed this event.


Delay, downplay, dismiss, deny.

7/5/2019 Short HIIQ. Fraud penalties to exceed $100 million and undisclosed “domino effect” - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 16/29


The references above to “material errors and omissions” refers to
something bad.  In fact, it is really, REALLY bad.


On its application to act as a 3  party administrator, Florida asks the
applicants if they have been a party to any civil actions over the past
10 years involving dishonesty, breach of trust, etc.


The HIIQ insiders repeatedly answered “no” to those questions.  But
then an independent background checkby the Florida
regulator uncovered multiple such undisclosed legal actions against
multiple HIIQ insiders. This includes both the CFO of HIIQ (Michael
Hershberger) as well as its founder (Michael Kosloske).  Even when
pushed by the regulator, HIIQ refused to supply information over these
undisclosed legal actions.


Note that together, Mr. Hershberger and Mr. Kosloske have sold
over $40 million in HIIQ stock over the past few months.

ate is now just weeks away, HIIQ has attempted to change its story, suggesting that maybe it just doesn’t need
s license at all.


y reading the above rejection letter in full, you will almost certainly come to the conclusion that there is e�ectivel
zero percent chance of HIIQ getting this license in Florida. (Separately, for the sake of completeness, I have se

s shown, following its rejection for licensure as a 3  party administrator in Florida, HIIQ / HPIH wrote a letter of

ould then trigger a “domino e�ect” which could result in its losing licenses in the other states where it does

or two trading days, the stock had dropped from $37 to below $30. But because of this investor call, the stock
ce quickly rebounded.


s shown earlier in this article, almost immediately after the investor call boosted the stock last week,
siders began quickly disclosing more sales, amounting to $1.5 million across just two days. Sellers included
e CFO, the CTO and the CEO of HIIQs Healthpocket subsidiary.

novations-in-tampa-�-90072827)”.


ased on this overwhelming consensus from consumers, HIIQ has actually managed to obtain the ultra-rare “F
ting” from the better business bureau.


n the recent investor call, Craig Hallum posed a layup question to HIIQ management, e�ectively stating, “tell us
ow bogus and erroneous the BBB complaints are”.  HIIQ responded by attempted to convince investors that the
BB is a corrupt entity which has falsely listed more than 80% of the complaints on its site.  HIIQ also tried to stat
at the huge volume of online fraud complaints are simply the result of the fact that HIIQ does a high volume of
siness, such that a large number of complaints should also be expected.


ere are the links so that you can check their claims for yourself.

7/5/2019 Short HIIQ. Fraud penalties to exceed $100 million and undisclosed “domino effect” - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 21/29


just this one site alone, HIIQ has received 651 complaints.  Out of the 93 total customer reviews, 90 are
egative.  This is quite obviously not simply a question of  “high volume”.


et even aside from the “corrupt” BBB site, every other site I could �nd also contains very similar fraud
omplaints from di�erent consumers in di�erent states across the country. The reviews are again
erwhelmingly negative, regardless of which site is reporting.

https://moxreports.com/hiiq/ 24/29


efore proceeding further, take a few moments to click on the links above and judge for yourself.  When it comes
HIIQ, the caustic consensus among consumers from all across the country appears to be entirely similar
gardless of their location.


** 10 –    MY PAST ARTICLES ON “CRAIG HALLUM SPECIALS”
e are currently living through one of the biggest bull markets in history.  Stocks of all shapes and sizes continue
surge higher, even on bad news.


et somehow I have been able to repeatedly identify (https://seekingalpha.com/author/richard-
earson/articles#regular_articles) dozens of stocks which then quickly imploded by 80-100%.  SEC investigations
aud suits and de-listings followed soon after.


ne of my better sources of compelling short ideas (impending implosions) has been stocks which are being
ggressively recommended by Craig Hallum despite the presence of very obvious problems.


ach of the stocks below soared by 200-800% following aggressive and repeated recommendations by Craig
allum.


each case, the underlying business problems were not only terminal, but they should have been entirely
ansparent.  Not surprisingly, these companies often needed money and Hallum ended up making millions of
ollars in investment banking fees across these companies.

or precisely all �ve of the Hallum trades below, they quickly imploded by at least 30% as soon as I exposed them
hey then went on to implode by 80-100%, just as I had predicted.


he repeated theme was that even as the share prices soared ever higher, Hallum would just ratchet up the share
ce target again and again.  After insiders or the companies sold shares, the share price then began its inevitab
plosion.


or example, Hallum’s escalating series of buy recommendations helped to take fraudulent Unipixel (UNXL
ttps://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNXL)) from $5.00 to over $40. Hallum’s �nal target before the implosion had

arLab was able to raise large sums of cash from equity sales before imploding.
