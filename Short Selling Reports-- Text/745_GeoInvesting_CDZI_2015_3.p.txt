Cadiz – CDZI – Is Set to
Dilute, As Predicted
November 24, 2015 By GeoTeam


For those not
familiar with our
take on Cadiz Inc.
(NASDAQ:CDZI),
you can read our
two critical articles
of the
company here and h
ere. It had
previously been our


argument that the company was heading towards either
bankruptcy or dilutive financing due to an inability to meet
its short-term debt obligations and inability to monetize its
one major project.


The company operates with an insolvent balance sheet and
has hit a multitude of barriers on its sole water project that
we believe will prevent it from ever becoming a cash
generating, profitable company.


What we clearly have now is a company that is “keeping
the dream alive” by selling equity to pay down debt. We
believe the company’s creditors have no option but to
accept a refinance under these circumstances. Essentially
what you have with CDZI is an executive compensation
ATM machine paid for by issuing stock. The company is
giving the appearance of paying down debt, but
shareholders are really the ones “paying”.

How long can the company keep the stock up simply for
the purpose of paying down debt?


Cadiz Refinancing of Debt 


On the morning of November 24, the company issued a
release which states that the company refinanced some of
its short term debt by paying a $2.25 million fee and that it
plans to make a $9 million payment before the original
March 2016 maturity to its lender. We’ve emphasized the
important parts of the PR in bold:


Cadiz Inc. (“Cadiz”, “the Company”) is pleased to
announce today that it has entered into an
agreement with its senior lenders, including MSD
Credit Opportunity Master Fund, L.P., (“Senior
Lenders”), which grants the Company the right to
extend the maturity date of the $40 million first
tranche of its mortgage debt (“First Mortgage”)
from March 2016 to June 2017.  Additionally, the
Company has also entered into agreements with
a majority of its convertible note holders to
exchange a minimum of $40 million in
outstanding convertible notes presently due in
March 2018 for substantially similar convertible
notes due in March 2020 (“Convertible Notes” or
“Notes”).


Under the agreement with the Senior Lenders, if
the Company elects to extend the First
Mortgage, it must make a $9 million
payment to the lenders prior to March 5,
2016, which will also reduce the Company’s
outstanding mortgage balance. The Company
may fund this $9 million payment with the
proceeds of a possible future equity offering
or, alternatively, the Company may replace
or extinguish the mortgage debt prior to the

March 2016 due date in connection with a
potential expansion of the Cadiz Valley
agricultural operations. Negotiations with third
parties related to such an agricultural expansion
are ongoing.


The Company paid its Senior Lenders an
amendment fee of $2.25 million in
additional debt for the right to extend the
maturity date of the First Mortgage to June 2017,
which is concurrent with the existing due date of
the remaining $12 million second tranche of its
mortgage debt. Should the Company opt to
extend the First Mortgage maturity date,
then it will incur an additional fee of $2.25
million payable in either additional term
debt or shares of common stock at the
Lenders’ option. Interest will continue to accrue
on the First Mortgage at 8%.


It appears that they’re going to do this by issuing shares to
pay for the $2.25 million in fees, and then they state they
are going to make the $9 million payment by either issuing
equity or by expanding operations of their Cadiz Valley
Agriculture Operations. We think it is unlikely that the
company will be able to make this payment by expanding
agricultural operations, as this segment only generated
slightly over $200K last quarter. This segment also
operates at a loss.


The company is offering up to $2.25 million worth of
shares of its common stock, as stated in the Form 424(b)
(5) filed on November 23, 2015. This is for the $2.25
million in debt the company is taking on to pay the lenders
fee disclosed in the PR.


The company will still have more than $100M in total debt
obligations after making its $9M payment in March. We see

the only reasonable scenario in paying down this debt to be
issuance of stock. If the company wanted to pay down all
of its debt at current prices, it would have to issue about
26 million shares, which would more than double the
outstanding share count of 17.8M. With a share count of
about 40 million shares, today’s market cap would put the
stock at a price of about $1.50.


This generously assumes a best case scenario with the
equity priced at $3.50 and does not include interest
payments and financing for the company’s alleged growth.


GeoInvesting Knew This Would
Happen 


We said several times over in our two articles that we
believe the company is going to dilute shareholders. This
transaction proves our point and we believe that we are
going to continue to see dilutive financing take place. This
is what we said in our first article on CDZI:


Investors in this company need to consider
several things. The first is that they need to
consider that the company has an enormous
amount of debt coming due in the beginning
of 2016 that they cannot pay as they currently
stand. Second, they need to consider that the
company is burning about $10 million in cash per
year which, without considering their debt, gives
them roughly another 2 to 3 quarters to operate.
Lastly, investors need to realize that there is no
more room for give on the company’s balance
sheet and that any financing moving forward
is likely to be extremely toxic, resulting in
the issuance of even more shares
potentially coupled with warrants and other
instruments that could further dilute the
company.

The long and short of this transaction is that it seems to
only stave off bankruptcy for another year. The company is
operating with cash burn of about $3 million per quarter,
and we predict the company will need $15 million to make
it to the end of 2016. We believe the company has no
choice but to issue equity in order to meet these
obligations and keep the business running.


We continue to stand by our analysis that Cadiz Inc. is
worth $0.
