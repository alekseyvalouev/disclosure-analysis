We Still think Cadiz is
Worthless, Part 2: So. Cal.
Metropolitan Water
Department “Not Pursuing”
CDZI’s Water Project
October 26, 2015 By GeoTeam


Even if you
don’t agree with
our conclusion
on Cadiz Inc.
(NASDAQ:CDZI)
– a conclusion
that states that
CDZI’s sole
project is
extremely


unlikely to materialize (which we will reiterate with new
MWD commentary) – the capital that the company would
have to raise in order to complete this project would likely
be in the hundreds of millions of dollars – a sum that we
think would be near impossible to raise without issuing
tons of equity, especially given the company’s current
balance sheet. In our opinion, Cadiz is just a terrible stock
to own, with or without eventual success of its water
project. Based on MWD’s comments made just days ago,
we look to move the ball further on our case that CDZI’s
equity is worthless.


We continue to stand by our analysis that the equity
in CDZI Is 100% worthless

The company was recently denied a railroad right of
way usage exemption by the Department of the
Interior Bureau of Land Management to use Federal
land to build its water pipeline
The project now appears to be subject to a Federal
review, which we believe has almost zero chance of
receiving approval. In the interim, CDZI is burning
cash with major debt due early 2016.
Even if approved, the company would have to appease
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,
which owns the Colorado River Aqueduct and which
seems to have “bankruptcy” concerns and a very
strong distaste for all things Cadiz
A Metropolitan Water Department of Southern
California Meeting on October 13, 2015 confirmed the
MWD was “not pursing any negotiations or
conversations at all”

cash burning entity that relies on financing to fund its
operations. The company has a negative tangible book
value and the current CEO appears to be enriching himself
and his law firm by way of CDZI’s common shareholders.
Five key points of our initial article were:


A letter on October 5th from the California State
Office of the Bureau of Land Management continues to
paint a bleak picture for CDZI’s focus – its ongoing
“water project”.
This reconciles with, and further validates, past critical
articles suggesting that the project is doomed for
eventual failure and, as such, the company may be as
well.
On top of its main business operation looking like an
impossibility, CDZI faces a major liquidity crisis and
has enormous debt coming due
As it stands, CDZI’s balance sheet is insolvent and the
company’s equity is worth $0 dollars on paper, with
seemingly no future road toward profitability or cash
generation.
Without steady profits, we value CDZI at what it’s
worth on paper and believe it’s is on its way to $0, be
it from bankruptcy, eventual dilution or other means.


We concluded our article by stating that the recent opinion
of the Bureau of Land Management forecasts a very
dubious, if not outright impossible, future for CDZI’s solo
project – a project that it has been unable to get off the
ground for the last 15 years. Today, we are going to
present brand-new information from an October 13
meeting of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California that seems to finalize that CDZI’s project is not
going to be moving forward in any meaningful capacity at
any time soon.


We think that the comments presented herein clearly
validate our opinion that CDZI, as an investment, is 100%

worthless.


MWD: 13 Years of Worrying Cadiz
Will Go Bankrupt


The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(“MWD”) plays a crucial role in the future of CDZI’s sole
hope for its business. The Metropolitan Water District owns
and operates the Colorado River Aqueduct (“CRA”), which
is a key component of CDZI’s proposed plan.


From MWD’s website,


To supply the more than 300 cities and unincorporated
areas in Southern California with reliable and safe water,
Metropolitan owns and operates an extensive water
system including: the Colorado River Aqueduct, 16
hydroelectric facilities, nine reservoirs, 819 miles of
large-scale pipes and five water treatment plants.
Four of these treatment plants are among the 10 largest
plants in the world. In fact, Metropolitan is the largest
distributor of treated drinking water in the United States.
The District imports water from the Feather River in
Northern California and the Colorado River to supplement
local supplies. It also helps its member agencies develop
water recycling, storage and other local resource programs
to provide additional supplies and conservation programs
to reduce regional demands.


In other words, the MWD, like the Federal government
whose land CDZI is proposing to use, must be on board
for this project to even think about moving forward as it
has been presented in the past.


Consult this handy checklist provided by CDZI in an
October 2014 PowerPoint:

As you can see, this checklist as it would stand today
would look identical to the one published by the company
in 2014 – of course, with the exception of needing to push
the “Construction Start” phase back some years – or
maybe even eliminating it altogether from the list. As this
slide shows, the company still needs:


1. BLM/ROW approval (recently denied)
2. Finalizations of all purchase and sale agreements of


water (which may take months, if not years, to draft
and implement – and only if step 1 is finally
approved/circumvented)


3. Discussions with the MWD regarding use of the
aqueduct (which we’ll show may be a disaster in and
of itself – and only if steps 1 and 2 are completed)


4. Construction start (again, will require major financing
and steps 1, 2, and 3 to be completed)


Don’t forget, this is all just to complete “Phase 1”.


In our last article, we showed that the company is still
stuck on Step 1. In this article, we’re going to show why
it’s likely that yet another brick wall has been put up at
Step 3 – which we don’t believe CDZI will even get to. Lest

we forget, this all is going to require a monstrous sum of
cash and financing to take care of – which the company
currently does not have.


Only then, of course, would we move onto “Phase 2” –
another portion of the project that looks great on a
PowerPoint slide, but that is going to require exorbitant
sums of financing to implement in reality:


So, we continue to believe CDZI’s
water project, as a whole, is 100%
DOA as it stands.


We learned from the Bureau of Land Management’s recent
letter to the company that a full Federal review of the
project may be forthcoming and that in the past, CDZI’s
science has not seen eye to eye with government science.
You can read more about that in our above linked article.


Assuming they somehow miraculously get past the BLM
roadblock in the project, CDZI is then going to have the
MWD to deal with. Judging by the MWD’s October 13, 2015
meeting minutes, they are less than amused with CDZI and

in their own words, “are not pursing any negotiations or
conversations [with Cadiz] at all.”


The MWD’s October 13, 2015 Legal and Claims Committee
meeting with its Board of Directors, available to stream
and listen to at this link, paints an extremely bleak picture
of Cadiz’s future working with the MWD. Starting at 9
minutes, the MWD general counsel begins to review and
report on the department’s now closed litigation with Cadiz.


MWD’s extremely rocky relationship with Cadiz is evident
as MWD’s counsel lays out the key points of its relationship
that you can follow and listen to in streaming audio. We’ve
denoted the timestamp of these points:


The MWD’s initial concerns with working with CDZI in
2002 were based around CDZI not being able to
finance the project (22:00)
This supplemented a “growing number of reasons the
project might fail” (23:10)
The initial concerns that led to MWD taking a board
vote in 2002 that ultimately voted to “stop the project
in its entirety” (24:40).
Cadiz sued MWD in 2005, costing the MWD $3.1
million and 3 ½ years of legal resources. MWD
ultimately won on five legal causes of action and Cadiz
“walked away” and dismissed the suit with prejudice
after bearing its own costs, while the last claim was
pending (5 contract claims, 1 claim of breach of
fiduciary duty) (26:00).
This resulted in the MWD having a final
determination of not owing Cadiz any duty to
pursue the project that they had proposed to MWD —
in the future (29:00)
He concludes by saying, “Where we are today, as a
result, we don’t owe Cadiz any duty.” (29:40)

MWD: “We are not pursing any
negotiations or conversations at
all.”


After this report of the facts, MWD counsel turns to the
Directors for questions and answers. Several directors,
including Director Dick, sounding somewhat disgusted, ask
questions in order to make sure that MWD has no
obligation to work with Cadiz in the future. The directors,
sounding a little annoyed that Cadiz has put the MWD
through such painful litigation processes in the past, don’t
seem amused by this tremendous waste of legal resources.


In response to a question about the viability of the project
at (33:30), MWD’s counsel replies:


“There is a lot of skepticism on behalf of
Federal Government Agencies. The US
geological survey had done some research back
when we were considering the project and they
were concerned that the recharge through the
basin under the Cadiz property may be as little
as 5,000 acre feet a year…”


Obviously, this doesn’t bode well for an upcoming Federal
review, if that’s what the next step is for the company.


Director Dick, at 34:30, comments that the company has
been very persistent in its lobbying of the MWD for it to
approve Cadiz’s project requests. He then states that he,
and his colleagues, want CDZI to pay a $5M fee up front if
they are ever to try and approach MWD again on this
project. This would offset the legal costs that CDZI has
forced onto MWD through the 3 ½ years of litigation it put
the MWD through. This “application fee” also happens
to represent about half of the $10.6 million that
Cadiz has in the bank – and this is seemingly just a

fee to captivate the MWD to consider the project
again, with no guarantee of approval or any help.


Needless to say, the Directors do not sound amused by the
runaround that CDZI has put them through.


They are right that CDZI has been lobbying non-stop. This
language was included in an August 2015 press release,
touting support from Southern California Local Elected
Officials issued by Cadiz,


In a separate letter to MWD, Orange County Supervisor
Lisa Bartlett also stated:


“After extensive review and outreach, I am
pleased to learn that MWD and Cadiz Inc. are
working collaboratively to ensure
conformity to necessary water quality and
operational standards. While ensuring reliable
and safe drinking water, I encourage the Board
and staff to do everything they can within MWD’s
administrative procedures to expedite the
delivery of Cadiz water to Southern California.”


Additionally, letters like this one, published in August of
2015, continue to prod the MWD for support of Cadiz’s
project. As we’ll show, however, CDZI doesn’t seem to be
working with the MWD – collaboratively, or at all.


At 37:00 another director asks about the hurdles the
company is going through with trying to push its project
forward. He comments that it’s a “fairly speculative”
project with respect to its ability to deliver water. He then
asks about the nature of the proposal that CDZI is
currently delivering and states that he

“hope[s] we’re not making any
representations that we’re going to help try
to them push the project forward.”


To which MWD’s counsel responds,


“…we are not pursing any negotiations or
conversations at all.” (39:25).


We think it’s obvious that the MWD may be extremely
hesitant to work with CDZI in the future.


Going back as far as 2002, as laid out above, the MWD had
abandoned working with Cadiz for, among other reasons,
fear that the company was going to go bankrupt and
potentially default on its joint obligations.


Cadiz has now spent over 13 years pushing this project,
one optimistic statement at a time, while shareholders
suffer major losses. In 2002, you can see what reality
infringing on this optimism did to the share price.


We think another 99% loss situation is again brewing for
Cadiz’s shareholders buying at today’s prices.

https://geoinvesting.com/cadiz-is-worthless-part-2-so-cal-metropolitan-water-department-not-pursuing-cdzis-water-project/ 11/17


As a reminder, here is what CDZI was telling investors
during August of this year, before having its requests
denied by the Bureau of Land Management:


The proposed project has withstood numerous court
challenges and is awaiting federal Bureau of Land
Management approval, finalization of contracts with water
companies and water transportation approvals from the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.


Cadiz expects to clear all these hurdles this year,
said Courtney Degener, a Cadiz spokesman.


CDZI’s Responses Fall Flat


In addition to the extremely damning dialogue from the
October MWD meeting, the company has issued a series of
responses to the BLM decision and our initial article, which
we’d like to take a moment and briefly analyze.


The company announced this statement in the days
following our report which concluded by saying,


“We will be persistent in our efforts to
demonstrate to the BLM that the public interest
and its own guidance documents require that it
modify its baseless decision and if our requests
are unsuccessful, we will seek a swift
resolution in Federal Court.  We are confident
in our case and that our cause is just.”


Putting aside whether or not the company’s “cause is just,”
we’d like to know how the company plans on continuing to
fund the litigation it is alluding to here. Is CDZI going to
launch several more multi-year lawsuits that they may
eventually, again, withdraw from? Where is the funding for
this going to come from and how much of the company’s

representation comes directly from the law firm of which
CDZI’s CEO is a shareholder of? This continued legal
battle only seems to us to be benefiting one party: the law
firm that the CEO is employed at and, by proxy, the CEO
himself.


CDZI was also active on Twitter after our report, Tweeting
out a couple of strongly worded articles and commentaries
relating to the BLM’s denial of their right of way proposal.
There was this commentary from “IE Business Daily,” which
is a website we – and according to Alexa – no one else
seems to have ever heard of.


There were also commentaries like this one, published in
the San Bernadino County Sun, which called the BLM’s
“recent refusal” “an embarrassment” and called for the
“BLM director to “rescind the decision and hold those who
made it accountable.”


A strongly worded commentary – of course, until you read
the “About the Author” section at the bottom of the page:


“Larry Jensen is the former chief legal counsel to
the BLM and deputy solicitor at Interior. He is
currently a shareholder at Brownstein Hyatt
Farber & Schreck LLP and represents Cadiz
Inc.”

People at the company think the BLM made the wrong
decision; what else is new?


On the 16th of October, the company issued yet another
update. This helped perk the stock up momentarily, but its
key points didn’t move the company’s argument forward.
Here is a copy of the release, which leaves shareholders
with this conclusion of its key points of options moving
forward:


These various options have different time horizons.


We believe if we are to secure a near-term reversal of the
determination we will be in a position to construct the
pipeline in 2016.  If we must pursue a legal remedy or
additional environmental review, then pipeline
construction could be delayed. [Geo: further than
2016].


In this scenario we would plan to continue to build the
wellfield and utilize it for agricultural development until the
pipeline is permitted and constructed.


As we carry out the best strategy to implement the Project
in the most expeditious manner, we continue to be in good
financial standing. We are in compliance with all debt
covenants and have no payments due until March 2016. 
We also have cash on hand to implement the business
strategy.  We are confident we can refinance and extend
our debt covenants prior to their due date if necessary. 
Articles from slightly more reputable sources, like the LA
Times, took another tone – like this:

The LA Times also said inconvenient things, like this:


“[the scheme had] a sort of shimmering
authenticity, like a desert mirage,”


And this:


“Cadiz was the brainchild of an investment
promoter named Keith Brackpool, who came to
the U.S. after pleading guilty to criminal charges
relating to securities trading in Britain.”


Who Will Put an End to This
Insanity?


In truth, we cannot definitively say that the MWD is not
going to be working with CDZI at all in the future – but
what we can say is that it’s going to be up to the same
Board of Directors that seem genuinely concerned about
the nature of this project and the millions CDZI has cost
the MWD. Ultimately it’s going to come down to their vote,
so there’s technically a chance that the project could be
developed –eventually.


Dealing with the cash constraints and company issues until
such time is an enormous problem in and of itself. Finally,
common sense says to us that the Board doesn’t seem
interested in helping Cadiz at all.

In many of the company’s responses, they seem to
continue to point to litigation as a potential solution for
their problems. Despite not being successful in the past
trying to litigate agencies like the MWD, the company
continues to turn to this route as an explanation of how it
is going to further its operation.


This, similar to implementing the project itself, is a very
costly venture that the company is likely not going to be
able to fund with just the $10.6 million that it has in the
bank currently. Another point worth noting about using
litigation as a solution moving forward is that, as we
showed in our first article, this just seems to be another
way to enrich CDZI’s law firm – a firm that CDZI’s CEO is a
shareholder of andworks for.


The only meaningful cash the company can generate
comes from outside financing. The company has spent its
cash on administrative expenses and continued handsome
salaries of its insiders. Who is going to give up and call it
quits first: the company’s creditors, the company’s Board,
or the company’s shareholders?


Or, perhaps regulators may be growing tired of watching
this farce unfold?


The only conclusion that we can draw from
ascertaining this updated outlook from the MWD is
that CDZI now has yet another brick wall ahead of it
in the extremely long, arduous and improbable road
that it must go down in order to implement its sole
business project. Trying to handicap the likelihood of
CDZI ever becoming a cash generating business is
extremely difficult. Anyway that you look at it, there
appears to be a significant chance that CDZI is going to
wind up in bankruptcy or massively diluting its
shareholders. At some point, we hope that the company’s
Board of Directors and the regulators begin to look at the

situation realistically and ask what the best path is not only
for CDZI’s common shareholders, but for the company’s
creditors.


If not anything else, we have to give the company credit
for perpetuating the story and the perceived possibility of
this project for well over 13 years. The sordid reality,
however, is that some shareholders have suffered massive
losses – and those buying today may face the same fate.
