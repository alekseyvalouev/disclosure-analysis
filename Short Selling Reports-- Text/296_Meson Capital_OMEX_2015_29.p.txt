Odyssey Slammed In U.K. Parliament, Promotion Techniques
Exposed, Calls To Cancel HMS Victory Contract

Summary


Thursday in an adjournment debate in the U.K. House of Commons, MP and
Shadow Minister of Defence Kevan Jones slammed Odyssey Marine and its
involvement in the HMS Victory.


The MP also exposed OMEX's techniques for raising money: making exaggerated
and unproven claims via third parties that can then be repeated by newspapers.
Called for SEC to investigate.


Calls for investigation why OMEX appears to have underpaid the U.K. Government
by $4.9mm for SS Gairsoppa recovery.


Calls for an immediate cancellation of the HMS Victory contract with the MHF and
OMEX.


Respondent confirms the HMS Victory IS subject to a judicial review commencing so
had to be careful about verbal response given potentially imminent court actions.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) Thursday reached a new level that few
penny stocks have ever managed to attain. The U.K. Parliament - House of Commons
held an adjournment debate regarding the HMS Victory led by MP and Shadow Minister of
Defence Kevan Jones. Given OMEX's business is heavily dependent on favorable
relationships with governments, and is heavily regulated, this is important for investors to
understand.


Though the attendance on a Thursday afternoon in parliament is not particularly high,
importantly, the Minister called for 3 different government departments to investigate
Odyssey's potential misdeeds. To quote a more politically astute U.K. local reporter who
covered the action:


1) Allegations that the Maritime Heritage Foundation is nothing more than a front for
Odyssey with no experience no money and a shared consultancy and PR operation:
Charity Commission to be asked to investigate.

2) Allegations HMS Victory gifted without a Departmental Minute even though her
contents were worth much more than the limit of £300k: National Audit Office asked
to investigate. Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence also asked to
investigate.


3) Allegation that former Secretary of State at the DCMS and current Health
Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, held a meeting with Lord Lingfield where Victory was
discussed in breach of the Ministerial code: The Cabinet Secretary asked to
investigate.

whole day so fast forward to the last 30 minutes, starting at time 17:00 for the relevant
period.


British MP Kevan Jones in the House of Commons Thursday:


We are unfamiliar with the political dynamics or motivations of any of the involved parties
so readers can judge some of the comments for themselves.


Our analysis of this dialog in The House of Commons:


Firstly - this is the first time that we are aware that OMEX's activities at the HMS Victory
have bubbled up to the highest levels of government in the U.K. and thus the highest
levels of transparency. Up until now, as indicated in the transcript, the activities between
Lord Lingfield and the MOD have been without the benefit of all relevant parties at the

table. That will certainly now change and proper due diligence and processes will have to
be followed. Given that a cash bond is required according to the UNESCO Annex and
OMEX's cash balance was under $4mm as of Sept 30, 2014, this alone seems to be a
high hurdle.


Secondly, The Minister has called for (in a formal setting, in Parliament) an investigation
by 3 separate U.K. departments into different aspects of the project: The Charity
Commission; The Ministry of Defense; and The Cabinet Secretary. Additionally, he is
stating that he will deliver the information he has learned to the SEC in the U.S. after using
some very strong language describing OMEX's activities.


Thirdly, this is a highly credible source in a credible, serious venue reinforcing some of the
criticism we have laid at OMEX over the last 15 months including the clever promotional
techniques used to inflate the value of shipwrecks by using third parties. Indeed the
Minister highlights that there is no evidence to back up the claims that there is bullion on
the HMS Victory.


Finally, the response from the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy does confirm
our earlier statement that there is in fact a judicial review facing the project - technically
this is a review aimed towards the government / MOD and how they made the decision to
grant the project to OMEX.


Overall - this would appear to be a major blow to OMEX's involvement in the HMS Victory
project and in the best possible case will delay the timeline considerably and in the worst
case the Minister will be successful in his call to have the project taken away from the
MHF and OMEX. OMEX has claimed that it is pivoting its business away from situations
that resulted in the contentious and ultimately losing claim with Spain on the "Black Swan"
ship. OMEX continues to be reliant on constructive relationships with governments for
licenses and partnerships to salvage ships and its ability to navigate these waters seems
questionable when a prominent British MP slams OMEX so sharply.

Wreck of HMS Victory 1744


5 pm


Mr Kevan Jones (North Durham) (Lab):


At about the same time as HMS Victory was found and Odyssey became involved
with Sir Robert Balchin, the spelling of the admiral's name on the Balchin Family
Society website was changed to match that of Sir Robert.


Balchen's true descendants, the Temple West family, contacted Odyssey's chief
executive officer, Greg Stemm, to protest and raise their understandable concerns
about the fraudulent nature of Lingfield's claims.


Stemm responded by rubbishing their concerns:


"Sir Robert has always been insistent with us that he was not a direct descendant,
just that he was part of the same family. While that has possibly been changed to
'descendant' in some instances by the media, I trust that you are as cynical about
the media's ability to get everything right as I am."


It is therefore remarkable that Odyssey commissioned a set of portrait photographs
by Emma Duggan of Lord Lingfield standing in front of a portrait of Sir John Balchen
to use as evidence that he was connected to the


admiral's family.


Investigation Request #1: Cabinet Secretary to ask him to investigate Lord Lingfield


If the then Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport wanted to
avoid any accusation of improper ministerial conduct, holding a meeting with Lord
Lingfield about HMS Victory without any civil servants present may not have been
the best way to go about it given Lord Lingfield's role with the Maritime Heritage
Foundation and Odyssey.


I will write today to the Cabinet Secretary to ask him to investigate what I
would say is a clear breach of the ministerial code by the current Health
Secretary.


The mishandling of the case of HMS Victory does not end there.


The Minister exposing OMEX's stock promotion techniques
5/21/2018 Odyssey Slammed In U.K. Parliament, Promotion Techniques Exposed, Calls To Cancel HMS Victory Contract - Odyssey Marine Explora…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2872526-odyssey-slammed-in-u-k-parliament-promotion-techniques-exposed-calls-to-cancel-hms-victory-contract 5/3


Ministers from the current Government have ignored advice that they have received
from English Heritage about the Maritime Heritage Foundation and Odyssey Marine
Exploration, which are clearly not to be trusted.


Odyssey has a proven track record of playing fast and loose with historic facts and
archaeological ethics. This is a company whose chief executive officer, Greg Stemm,
told shareholders last September that it did not have enough cash to see it through
the winter. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that if Odyssey were forced to
raise equity, it would have to file for bankruptcy.


Its shares are worth absolutely nothing.


Odyssey also has a proven track record of ignoring the law, manipulating historical
data and making exaggerated and unproven claims to would-be investors of the
value of its projects. For example, there is no evidence whatever that there was, to
quote Greg Stemm, "more than a billion dollars of gold" on board HMS Victory, yet
that was claimed by Odyssey's share pumpers and never denied by the company.
That lack of evidence has been verified by a Wessex Archaeology report, the only
proper, independent investigation into the HMS Victory site. However, Odyssey
communicated the claim to its investors via a third party, presumably with the sole
intention of raising its share price and attracting new investors for its stock.


The company is well versed in that practice, having inflated the value of wreck sites
in the past, leading to newspaper articles in The Daily Telegraph, The New York
Times and The Sunday Times. Those newspapers have unwittingly been used by
Odyssey to add credence to its claims about the values of those sites, which are
then used as part of its campaigns to attract new investors for the company.


If deep-sea exploration and treasure hunting were such profitable and economically
attractive ventures, surely other deep-sea offshore oil and gas exploration
companies worldwide would be actively searching for shipwrecks and exploiting their
cargoes? Of the 17 projects Odyssey has pursued, it has excavated and generated
material revenue from only two. In fact, on the rare occasions that Odyssey does
carry out deep-sea exploration and salvage work, it charters ships from others and
hires temporary staff to perform the work.


Investigation Request #2: National Audit Office about the missing $4.9mm payment
for the Gairsoppa
5/21/2018 Odyssey Slammed In U.K. Parliament, Promotion Techniques Exposed, Calls To Cancel HMS Victory Contract - Odyssey Marine Explora…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2872526-odyssey-slammed-in-u-k-parliament-promotion-techniques-exposed-calls-to-cancel-hms-victory-contract 6/3


Odyssey has also repeatedly pumped non-existent "secret" treasure cargoes,
including on the SS Gairsoppa, which Odyssey won the contract for from the
Department for Transport in 2010. Odyssey changed the terms of that contract with
the Government after it was signed to the company's advantage, meaning that
Odyssey withheld $4.9 million from the Government to cover its salvage costs, which
it had no entitlement to retain. I will write to the Permanent Secretary at the
Department for Transport to investigate why the company kept what should be
taxpayers' money, and will also ask the National Audit Office to look at that.


Odyssey is a scam, which operates by encouraging mainly small investors to invest
in its outrageous claims of future returns from the salvage of wrecks. The company
has lost $185 million since its inception, and is backed by what can only be
described as a web of secret offshore companies. They have little or no real value
but are highlighted by Odyssey to give the impression that it has major investments
in a number of companies, including those that practise underwater mineral
extraction. A close look at the companies shows that the valuations are false, and
that many of the individuals involved in Odyssey also sit as directors of the other
companies.


Odyssey strangely seems to pay those companies for "work" at exorbitant rates.
Some of the directors are also highly dubious-some of the directors of a Panama
based subsidiary have been investigated for money laundering.


Investigation Request #3: Securities and Exchange Commission
5/21/2018 Odyssey Slammed In U.K. Parliament, Promotion Techniques Exposed, Calls To Cancel HMS Victory Contract - Odyssey Marine Explora…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2872526-odyssey-slammed-in-u-k-parliament-promotion-techniques-exposed-calls-to-cancel-hms-victory-contract 7/3


The only people who appear to have made money out of Odyssey and this lucrative
scam are Greg Stemm, who is a former PR man for the comedian Bob Hope, John
Morris, and the other members of Odyssey's senior management team. As Odyssey
is an American company listed on the NASDAQ, I believe that the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the United States should investigate its practices.
Later today I will pass on the information that I have collected on the
company. It is not the first time that Greg Stemm and John Morris have been
investigated by SEC-they were debarred from holding office in a previous company.


One very simple question needs to be answered. Why have the Government
entered into a contract to hand over one of the nation's most historic wrecks to a
company such as Odyssey with such a shabby record? It appears that no due
diligence has been carried out by the Government into this company. The facts are
not difficult to establish, as most of the information that I have found is in the public
domain.


In order for Odyssey to gain access to the wrecks, to inflate its share price and sell
new stock, it has used Lord Lingfield to create what I would describe as a front
organisation - the Maritime Heritage Foundation.


MHF is not independent of Odyssey. They share a PR company, Brunswick, and a
maritime consultant, Dr Sean Kingsley. MHF entered into a multimillion pound
commercial contract with Odyssey, yet it has no money apart from £65,000 in the
bank, having spent just £495 on charitable activities in 2013-14. A simple question
is: how exactly is it going to fund this multimillion pound contract? It would also be
interesting to know where the £65,000 came from. Did it actually come from
Odyssey in the first place?


Investigation Request #4: Department of Public Accounts and Ministry of Defence
5/21/2018 Odyssey Slammed In U.K. Parliament, Promotion Techniques Exposed, Calls To Cancel HMS Victory Contract - Odyssey Marine Explora…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2872526-odyssey-slammed-in-u-k-parliament-promotion-techniques-exposed-calls-to-cancel-hms-victory-contract 8/3


Serious questions can also be raised about the individuals involved in MHF: Sir
Robert Balchin, eminent plastic surgeon Professor Alan Roberts, and Mr Nigel
Branson, a member of the corporation of the City of London. None of those
individuals has any background or expertise whatever in marine archaeology or in
managing archaeological projects. I will be writing to the Charity Commission and
asking it to investigate this charity.


There are also serious questions about the procedures that led to the Ministry of
Defence gifting the wreck of HMS Victory to MHF in January 2012. It was to this
almost non-existent charity, with no expertise and nonexistent funds, that the
Ministry of Defence gifted HMS Victory in 2012. The threshold for gifting currently
stands at £300,000, meaning that a departmental minute is laid before Parliament
when items valued over this figure are gifted by the Government. This arrangement
provides transparency to allow Parliament to raise concerns


[Mr Kevan Jones]


about such gifts. The maritime archaeological community agrees that the guns alone
on the wreck are worth several million pounds. Why did the Ministry of Defence not
place a departmental minute before the House so that the gift could be properly
scrutinised? I have raised this matter with the Chair of the Public Accounts
Committee who has herself raised the matter with the National Audit Office. I have
also written separately to the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence to
ask him to investigate why Ministers agreed to this. Why was Lord Lingfield, a man
with no expertise in maritime archaeology, given such a prominent role in the
preservation of HMS Victory? We need to be clear about what motivates him. He
could just be an innocent Walter Mitty character claiming to have ancestral links to
boost his standing in the society in which he moves, or he could have direct or
indirect financial links or association with Odyssey, either through direct payments,
shares or an involvement in hedge funds trading in Odyssey's shares. If that is the
case, it would be very serious. It would clearly be a matter not only for the House
authorities, but the police. I am at a loss to know what his motivations are, but we
need a clear explanation from him, including how he became to be associated with
Greg Stemm and John Morris of Odyssey.


I am also at a loss as to why the Government should hand over this wreck to an
individual like Lord Lingfield, who has no experience in this field. They might as well
have handed this to the first member of the public who strolled past the MOD main
building that day. The only difference is that we know Lord Lingfield is very well

connected within the higher echelons of the Conservative party. The Government
should immediately cancel this arrangement with Odyssey and the Marine Heritage
Foundation.


Our nation rightly honours citizens who die in the active service of our country. I am
a commissioner of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and I am truly
privileged to serve on it. Just like the true descendants of Sir Robert Balchen, the
British public will be outraged and scandalised by the sleazy way the Government
have treated the last resting place of HMS Victory and her crew.


The response from the DCMS (Not the MOD for some reason) confirmed the judicial
review we reported on earlier this week:


The Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy


(Mr Edward Vaizey):


As I said before the hon. Gentleman's intervention,


the decision to allow the Maritime Heritage Foundation


to recover at-risk surface artefacts from the wreck of


HMS Victory is subject to judicial review. With the


greatest respect, therefore, it would be unwise for me to


go into the subject, given that court action might be


imminent.

Thanks, Ryan,


I listened to the entire speech and mild rebuttal.


That certainly was a slam by Kevan.


I am interested in reading (whenever it is available) the letter that the sitting representative of the Minister of Defense
will write to Kevan concerning his allegations.


If I were non-biased I would say that Kevan (the shadow Minister of Defense) has the opposing and ruling party on
the run based upon his presentation of this "gifting" and intends to make good on his attack, which means to me, he is
probably coming from strength. This does not look good for OMEX though to be fair, it could also blow over so still
speculation at this point as to the final outcome.

Speaking of Gifting. Do you realize the largest bronze cannon retrieved from the bottom of the ocean that was
retrieved from the Victory site was a gift from Odyssey to the UK.

Author’s reply »  For those who thought this was only covered by a couple people in an empty parliament - it
was picked up by the major UK paper the Independent:


http://ind.pn/18IKkKj


Kevan Jones, a shadow Defence minister, told the Commons he believes Odyssey is a “scam” and accused
Lord Lingfield, an education adviser to David Cameron, of being either a “Walter Mitty” or having an
undisclosed financial relationship with Odyssey. The Labour MP yesterday formally asked the National Audit
Office and the Securities and Exchange Commission in America to look into various aspects of the
Government’s attempts to secure Victory’s remains.

Meson Cap;


Please google Kevan Jones and scandals and you will get more hits than Giselle Bunchen on Tinder. Mr
Jones is a career politician with his share of issues. After his garbage time in Parliament (aka Adjournment
Debate) he went off on his own Twitter rampage, so it is no surprise the papers picked it up. Yes, the
Independent had a 3 paragraph article on it, but they also quoted Sean Kingsley responding to Jones as well,
which you didn't post.

You are aware that Mr. Jones is an MP of the United Kingdom, no? As such I'm not sure why he would be
interacting with the SEC.


Furthermore, parliamentary privilege provides complete legal immunity for anything said by a member in the
Commons.

Keubiko. Did you read the statement from Morris? "Labor Party requesting an investigation from the USA
SEC". I know a MP of the UK has immunity from civil charges of slander, but it is still slander. The boldest
claim was "OMEX is a scam and the stock is worth nothing" Immunity or not it is still the definition of slander.
This why some members of Parliament speak and act as buffoons because they know they can get away with
it.

Keubiko, you are way over your head here. I think you'd be better off chatting about companies you

There is no such thing as "MP of the United Kingdom." Kevan Jones is MP of North Durham. He is also
shadow minister of the armed forces. You speak as if he has some sort of executive authority but that's
nonsense.


"parliamentary privilege provides complete legal immunity for anything said by a member in the Commons"
You are absolutely wrong again. Parliamentary privilege doesn't protect members from criminal prosecution.
Also, according to the Parliamentary code of ethics, members are required to obey civil laws as well.
Parliament can impose punishments on those making civil infractions. Jones has obviously broken the Code
based not only on his slanderous remarks, but also due to his remarks' lack of honesty and objectivity.

>>You are absolutely wrong again. Parliamentary privilege doesn't protect members from criminal

I didn't state it protects them from "criminal prosecution", only that they have immunity for what they say in the
Commons.


http://bit.ly/1Kw38rL


 
"Freedom of speech is arguably the most important parliamentary privilege; for a democracy to function
properly the people’s elected representatives must be free to raise any matter. If a person speaking in
Parliament believes a fact or opinion needs to be raised in a debate, that person should not be deterred from
raising it by fear of a criminal or civil liability. This protection has long been claimed, and found concrete
expression in Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 and in the Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland."


"To ensure freedom of speech in Parliament it is right that parliamentary proceedings cannot be relied upon to
sue a Member of Parliament or a witness to a select committee for defamation."


Why don't you give me a single example over the past 300 years where an MP was successfully prosecuted
or had a civil judgement for libel?


 
This was just upheld by the court of appeals in the United Kingdom, specifically for a libel case in which Lord
Triesman accused a Thai official of corruption in the House of Commons:


http://bit.ly/1Kw38rP


"The unanimous decision by three senior judges relies on the ancient immunity granted to speakers under
article 9 of the bill of rights 1689, which protects MPs and peers' proceedings from being "questioned in any
court or place outside of parliament"."


Just because some angry OMEX bagholders want a 300 year-old law to go away doesn't mean it will happen.


 
Thanks for the condescending lesson. I don't feel over my head. Especially since none of this affects the cash
flows, or lack thereof, of OMEX.

Keubiko,

thoughtful, witty and just plain fun to read. I can also tell that the author here is a big fan, as his essays are of
a similar template, albeit many many notches lower- I kinda picture Masterblaster from the Mad Max series…
you can decide who is who in this situation…but I digress. 
Are you doing a deeper dive into the OMEX story, or are you just "visiting" so to speak?


06 Feb 2015, 09:16 AM


Rory Duncan
Keubiko, you claim, "I didn't state it protects them from "criminal prosecution", only that they have immunity
for what they say in the Commons."


But you are wrong again. Re-read your statement. You said, "parliamentary privilege provides complete legal
immunity for anything said by a member in the Commons." Your statement clearly implies that an MP would
have immunity from criminal prosecution for anything he/she said in the Commons as you cited "complete
legal immunity."


Parliamentary Privilege only provides immunity with respect to certain offenses, including from arrest on civil
matters. It does not apply with respect to criminal offenses.


I never once claimed that an MP was charged in a civil case for libel. I stated that when it came to civil
matters, the House of Commons relied on its own Code. That Code states in part, "Members have a duty to
uphold the law..." That Code also contains requirements with respect to objectivity and honesty which appear
to have been breached in Mr. Jones's speech, as he made some claims that any casual observer could see
were fabricated.


I am a shareholder in OMEX but don't consider myself an "angry bagholder" nor do I wish a 300 year-old law
to go away. I'm very happy to be a shareholder, and I'm very happy that the stock is so undervalued. It has
afforded an excellent opportunity to increase my exposure. We don't need a 300 year-old law to go away in
order to hold Mr. Jones accountable for his actions.


If you feel confident in your deep knowledge of OMEX, and you have such a negative viewpoint, I would
encourage you to short the stock. Such deep conviction deserves a large position.

"Lord Lingfield admits that Odyssey’s interest was of course initially piqued by the bullion, although says he
now doubts the existence of any treasure on the wreck site."


Boom.


16 Feb 2015, 06:57 PM


bulldog2014
Yes, because saying- on the record- that there is gold on the Victory, of which Odyssey's (the evil treasure
hunters) take is 80%, would really help the cause to silence the "opposition."

16 Feb 2015, 07:40 PM


26922203
Why doesn't Odyssey produce the document that they say shows there was merchant gold on the Victory?


17 Feb 2015, 04:34 PM


bulldog2014
Why should they? For whom? How would that help them? Would the archeonazis or the Wests or Wessex
change their tune if Odyssey did? There is no guarantee there is anything on the Victory. Odyssey's research
leads them to believe there may be gold, but they never said it with certainty.  
If they did produce their research would you stop your 9 years off incessant posting and start to establish any
economic position in the stock?  
There is only one way to find out if there was any significant gold on the Victory. The ones who took the
economic risk to find the actual ship should take the economic risk- and subsequent potential reward- if they
do find any gold.


17 Feb 2015, 05:44 PM


26922203
Well, in regard to their 'papers' they self publish, the Victory assessment that Odyssey wrote, and their field
work: the Wessex peer review destroyed their research and field work.


As noted by Wessex in the report, Odyssey promised to provide the source document, as well as other
foundations for their research and conclusions, but then never did, adding further suspect to the entire
document.


Just so you are aware, Odyssey was mapping the entire area south of the channel, and happened upon it.
Risk is researching a wreck, and then looking for it, not finding it by accident.


I think it is very interesting that you choose to use a term like "archeonazis" on this website.

Kevan Jones essentially provided a quick synopsis of your misleading and highly biased research over the last 14
months, Ryan. Are we to think these fraudulent claims are any more believable just because they are coming from a
member of parliament? Do you know the level of due diligence that Kevan Jones undertook prior to making these
blasphemous claims? For his own sake, one would hope that he has some very compelling evidence to support them.
Parliamentary privilege will not protect Mr. Jones from charges of slander and misfeasance of public office.


Luckily for OMEX, The Ministry of Defence and DCMS are far more balanced in their view of Odyssey, the Victory
rescue, and the roles and responsibilities of a Member of Parliament. Those institutions have spent years working
with OMEX and performing due diligence on the company. They were satisfied enough with the results of their
diligence that they awarded the contract to MHF and OMEX.

Just some perspective on the UK system. Firstly Mr Jones is SHADOW minister, not an actual minister. Actually the
more usual title is opposition spokesperson on defence. 
He has little resources but can, under privilege make allegations in Parliament. 
Calling for bodies to investigate eg National Audit Office or Charity Commission will, in itself, not result in anything.
His formal letters to the permanent secretaries will, however, obtain a response. These are often evasive but you can
depend that the staff of the ministry will not cover any fishy business. 
Finally the judicial review. All that was said is that they expect that somebody will serve papers on the Government to
try to start a judicial review in the near future. To me it sounds that they are using this to avoid, for whatever reason,
giving a more open response (this is normal in Parliament).

Moon Kil Woong, Contributor
Yawn another thinly traded junk stock with no earnings and controversy. If anything, it proves that this market is pretty
much allowing anything in the door and that valuations are so absurd companies like this can actually get investor
funding.


02 Feb 2015, 12:58 AM


26922203
MK Woong has stated the obvious nature of this stock. Currently, the losses are at over twice the market cap, total
debt and liabilities are nearing market cap, and there is no short term or mid-term hope for revenue. Short term debt
exceeds assets, and virtually all assets have now been encumbered with the latest loan.


While it appears a yawn from a market perspective, it is not from an archaeological one. There was quite a bit of
interest, and offers from local teams that expressed interest in the recovery. Odyssey was chosen over them, and now
that selection process is in question.


If the allegations of fraud on the Gairsoppa contract prove to be true, and Odyssey is forced to pay back the $4.9M
that Jones stated, where would they get that money from?  
Odyssey extended the contracts on the Gairsoppa and Mantola, holding to their story of a secret cargo of 3.7M
additional ounces their 'research' stated was on board, and waiting for the commodity price to recover to make the
project viable. This will make it far easier to investigate, as they are active contracts.


Mr Jones is correct, Odyssey is forced to hire others with the technical capabilities to actually perform recoveries such
as the Gairsoppa and Mantola. There were the two Russian vessels that searched for about 2 years, the purchase of
the location, and Swire Seabed that actually performed the deep recovery. 
Swire made history with the recovery, not Odyssey, and appears to have made far more on the project than Odyssey. 
I surmise this may be the foundation of the claim, that the contract was changed from Odyssey performing the
recovery, to others, ie Swire. The substantial rate difference between Odyssey and Swire was probably veiled until
expenses were paid.


It is curious where Jones got the $4.9M from, especially after the comments that the myriad of subsidiaries
overcharges between themselves for services. I suppose the investigation and the links to personnel and information
sources will root this all out.


This appears very similar to the Republic, whereas they found a fraction of the amount that they and the 'internet'
reported was on the vessel. At that time they terminated the recovery, they stated they were waiting for technology to

advance to locate the other 75%. Unfortunately, they are using the very same equipment that was used to recover the
Republic 10 years ago, so one would suppose they are still waiting for 'their' technology to advance.


The Victory has been worked for 5 years by Odyssey Marine for MHF. It is likely that, given the typical day rate and
cash burn, there is between $15M to $20M in arrears for the work done to date. There is no evidence that Odyssey
has been paid anything by MHF. Odyssey owes GALT $15M from any proceeds.  
It is likely that at least $30M would be needed just to break even. Since this is impossible, it appears that there is
significant foundation for Jones claims as the real intent.


The big question looming, will Odyssey provide a response to the allegations?


Will Odyssey issue a formal rebuttal, or simply confirm MP Jones allegations that they use the media, such as the
Yahoo OMEX Message Board to refute the allegations indirectly? (I am certain Mr Jones is enjoying reading the
comments posted about him)


Perhaps another Green River article with alleged valuations?

An "Adjournment Debate" is described by Wikipedia as "In the Westminster system, an adjournment debate is a
debate on the motion, "That this House do now adjourn." In practice, this is a way of enabling the House to have a
debate on a subject without considering a substantive motion."


"Normally, only the Member raising the debate and the Minister who is replying speak in the half-hour adjournment. It
is not uncommon for the Chamber otherwise to be empty".


You have to wonder if this obscure, back bench MP thought of this all by himself, or if he was fed the info, and by
whom (and why)?


I have to say I was delighted to learn the HMS Victory's cannon were worth "several million pounds". They are an
easy salvage, with immediate monetization.


Meson has forecast imminent bankruptcy for OMEX virtually every month for two years now, without success.
OMEX's daily trading volume is now under 200,000 shares. There is no way the short sellers of 19 million shares can
cover their position. Bankruptcy is their only hope.


Nor will here be anyone offering shares at low prices once they start up. I hope the shorts are loaded up with Advil,
they will need it when the margin calls arrive.

than $1.70 with hope and change.

We have seen several short squeezes in the last few months, only for the stock to decline even further. In the end the
company's fundamentals will prevail, and at the current cash burn rate and the current share price, a decent sized
secondary offering could cut the stock at least in half.

by U.S. businesses, foreign corporations trading securities in the United States, American nationals, citizens,
and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice whether or not they are physically present in
the United States. This is considered the nationality principle of the act. Whenever businesses decide to
follow the unethical road, there are consequences including high financial penalties. Any individuals that are
involved in those activities may face prison time.[3] This act was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful
for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in
obtaining or retaining business.[4][5] In the case of foreign natural and legal persons, the Act covers their
actions if they are in the United States at the time of the corrupt conduct. This is considered the protective
principle of the act.[5] Further, the Act governs not only payments to foreign officials, candidates, and parties,
but any other recipient if part of the bribe is ultimately attributable to a foreign official, candidate, or party.
These payments are not restricted to just monetary forms and may include anything of value.[6] This is
considered the territoriality principle of the act.[5]When looking at the outcome of the law, it appears to have a
positive effect. The growth of American MNC’s in the last few years confirms that briberies are not basic facts
of businesses in many countries, but it doesn’t mean that bribery doesn’t exist. Even though government and
companies have taken important steps, much more needs to be done because bribery continues to be a
problem in many countries.[7]

Short sellers may disrupt stock pricing in the near term, but so can buyers of the stock. Frankly, I find it disturbing that
the company blames short sellers for ongoing business disruption. If the information laid out by the short sellers is

several attempts to refute Meson's claims last year, the company has been unable to rightsize ship or stabilize the

Of course they do. did you bother to read the above post Woody. They are OK for now! and going into the Q


02 Feb 2015, 04:39 PM


woodywood.com
Murphy, just because a company says they do does not document it as the truth. Things change daily. Will few or no
news releases on their current business activities it is all a guess. We need some good news to offset the big chunk of
loses some of us have taken as stockholders.


02 Feb 2015, 04:49 PM


murphy8275
Than sell your shares and walk away Woody? this is not a company, At this point for the faint of heart. 
Can you afford to lose 40% more on any given day? if the answer is no! well.... 
Either way you have been here for awhile. As such you should by now know the risk of OMEX business model

Radioshack has a very valuable strategic asset in the form of a national store base that could be used by different
buyers to expand quickly. Furthermore, it should be noted that shareholders have practically been wiped out.


The cash burn at OMEX continues and the moment when this house of cards will collapse is nigh, however the exact
moment depends on the company's ability to raise capital. Even if they are successful at selling of another minority
stake in subsidiaries, it means that they are buying a few months time. The conclusion remains that this company
beyond the point of no return and a sharp decline in the share price - even at these levels - makes a lot of sense.


There is a common perception that since this stock is heavily shorted, it must rise sharply eventually. Not perse. If
short sellers play out their strong hand, a high short interest can cause a collapse in the share price if the scenario
above plays out.


The company has a cool business, but it is a terrible business to be in. I realize that a lot of investors like the binary
outcome of this situation. But if you treasure your savings somewhat, you shouldn't be here.


03 Feb 2015, 08:09 AM

So does Verizon, AT@T, T-Mobile, Sprint, APPL. With all there self supporting retail locations. RSH on the
other hand is a Bond holders NightMare? Think Circuit City? Outdated and very late to change.


Omex is in the process of a changed model! with Phosphate and underwater mining being the income driver
and wrecks and history being the annual boost in income! going forward!... 
As for me and $! This is a small part of the port and is hedged with puts and calls going out to june and sept.
also my buy in is @ .9068 average.  
I did do what most did when Omex was above $2.00. I shorted a large block @ 2.20 and covered @ 1.25! but
below a $1.00 well

It has been a nightmare, but an established retail network is a quick way for e.g. Sprint to grow its store base.

I don't buy the underwater mining argument as one of the potential drivers for the stock going foward.
Underwater mining at this stage is a high cost alternative that will require substantial regulatory approval and
capital investments that OMEX won't be able to fund. Theoretically, OMEX could sell off more of their
underwater mining subsidiaries to third parties to keep itself afloat. However, it will take a long time - if ever -
before OMEX will receive cash flows from those activities, especially in a deflationary environment.


03 Feb 2015, 09:05 AM


murphy8275
Mayflower your point is taken! but look at the investments Omex has made in that arena? Do you believe that
they would just throw it all out the window just to salvage Themselves for shipwreck recovery. That does not
make sense to me?  
Most of what they are mining for floats in international waters or within E-ZONES. As such they are not as
overburdened as the shipwreck business which has its deep issues politically? As we are seeing now! 
anyway! I get it more than most. I understand the downside risk. My portfolio is well diversified and
movements in Omex is not a big deal to me.

I guess it depends on what you think their mining subsidiary (I assume you are referring to Oceanica mainly)
is worth. That's the 20 million share question.


03 Feb 2015, 09:33 AM


Mayflower Capital Partners
Exactly, that is the big assumption investors have to ask themselves. Selling another minority stake at a high
valuation wouldn't necessarily validate its intrinsic value, but would sure keep OMEX afloat for a while. I think
it would be a difficult to fund major underwater mining projects at the moment given ongoing weakness in
most commodities.

"Selling another minority stake at a high valuation wouldn't necessarily validate its intrinsic value"

bulldog2014
Mayflower,


Your profile says that you are a value oriented hedge fund, yet your comment, "Selling another minority stake
at a high valuation wouldn't necessarily validate its intrinsic value" hints at some major flaw in your
understanding. If a company is valued at X, and they sell an asset (which the market had valued at, say,.25X)
at 2X or 3X, wouldn't that validate the intrinsic value? Isn't it the ONLY way intrinsic value could be fully
validated?  
Your view on funding underwater mining projects is another issue altogether. Phosphates have not been
tracking-nor do they- other commodities with any relevant correlation.


03 Feb 2015, 10:29 AM


Mayflower Capital Partners
Sure, it would be true that OMEX could cash in at those valuations. However, those proceeds will have to be
used for the ongoing cash burn. Simply selling a stake for a certain valuation doesn't validate the real value of
the asset, but rather reflects what certain parties are willing to pay for it.


If you believe that the underwater mining activities are the crown jewel for OMEX, then selling a minority
stake to fund the ongoing cash burn would limit your upside, if your bull thesis materializes.


03 Feb 2015, 01:00 PM


bulldog2014
Mayflower, 
"Simply selling a stake for a certain valuation doesn't validate the real value of the asset, but rather reflects
what certain parties are willing to pay for it." 
OK, I will bite: even if it doesn't validate it completely, it would come pretty darn close! What else would be a
better benchmark to validate an asset than an asset sale? You are using circular logic. I would assume, that
the buyer of part of all of the mining stake would be an industry player-most likely. I would have to assume
that a big industry player would have a pretty good idea what the asset is worth. SO: if Odyssey sells a 25%
stake in Oceanica to XYZ industry player for $250 million, you would be happy shorting OMEX at $1 because
your don't believe the asset is worth anywhere near a billion$? Do you normally short takeover stocks at a
deep discount to their takeout price just because a certain party decided to pay "x" price and you believe it is
overvalued?  
If the mining activities are worth a billion dollars , then selling 25% for $250MM will satisfy a lot of "burn." But it
just comes down to what you think the asset is worth, and you obviously don't think it's worth more than a
subway token, by the way you are talking.  
Also, I would be very very happy for OMEX to sell their asset at even half the price i think it's worth: THAT
would more than satisfy my bull thesis. That IS my bull thesis. The other stuff is interesting and will work out
much more smoothly if and when their balance sheet and cash position is right side up.

Mayflower Capital Partners
Sure, if they could sell it for those valuations, I am wrong and will cover. However, I think that the actual value
of those operations is substantially less than what you are probably estimating it at.

Rory Duncan
Mayflower, do you manage money professionally??


"Simply selling a stake for a certain valuation doesn't validate the real value of the asset, but rather reflects

How would you propose we understand the "real" value of an asset other than by finding out what the highest
bidder is willing to pay for it? The shorts have demonstrated plenty of ignorance before, but this may take the
cake!


03 Feb 2015, 02:08 PM


bulldog2014
Mayflower,


My numbers above were for illustrative purposes to try to prove a point (although my view on the Oceanica
valuation is not far off those numbers)- or better yet, to try to understand your valuation validation thesis. You
keep contradicting yourself, however: one one hand, you don't believe an asset is validated just because the
market (i.e. industry player) has just paid a dear price for it, on the other hand you state that you would cover
if someone paid $250MM for 25% stake. Huh? Will you be wrong because you undervalued the Oceanica
asset BEFORE an asset sale, or will you be wrong because your asset validation thesis is completely
misplaced? 
Whatever the reason, you just don't believe Oceanica is worth much and it is too bad that you are mucking up
your view with a misplaced "valuation validation" theory.  
But, while we are at it, what do you think Oceanica is worth?


03 Feb 2015, 02:20 PM


Mayflower Capital Partners
I personally assign very little economic value to the Oceanica asset. If it could find a buyer for their entire
stake that is willing to buy the asset for a reasonable sum, I would advise OMEX to sell it immediately.


Both economic profit margins on underwater mining activities and regulatory approvals remain big question
marks. So the Oceanica has a certain option value. One has to wonder why - if the share price is so
undervalued and unreflective of the Oceanica asset - strategic buyers wouldn't accumulate an indirect stake
in the Oceanica asset through an ownership stake in OMEX.

Mayflower Capital Partners
I am not sure that he is the kind of strategic partner the company needs to develop the property. Besides, his
stake stems from May 2014. If his intent was getting control of the Oceania asset on the cheap, he would
seriously increase his stake as the stock fell further.


03 Feb 2015, 04:32 PM


26922203
The real value of Oceanica is not what someone will pay for a share, but the value of the operation.


As noted in the EIS, the basic cost of dredging the material and separation is $65 per ton, this far exceeds
land based total costs. If one includes transportation and refining cost to a usable product, this does not
appear viable. As noted, there has been no news of any offers to purchase the product, which would be a
marketing point to attract investors.


If you lose money on every ton of material you dredge up, you don't make it up with volume.


OMEX stock, the parent company of Oceanica, is worth less than $90M in its entirety, yet somehow, a
subsidiary of which they own 40%, is worth hundreds of millions? 
There was plenty of time, once the assay results were published, for mining companies to invest, and/or
purchase adjacent lease areas. Mining companies did neither, and Oceanica was able to purchase all of
adjacent leases.


Nautilus Minerals, as an example, is over 50% owned by mining companies. They have permits in hand, and
equipment under construction for the mining operation. Currently trading at 33 cents US.


Yes, the OMEX business model has transitioned over the years. First the ship was for dining excursions, the
treasure hunting, commodity recovery, metal sulphide mining, and now phosphate mining. One common issue
remains, lack of revenue to cover operations and any sort of profit.


Currently, virtually all projects are involved in controversy. 
The Central America is in Court battles, and the foundation of the project is Bankruptcy Court.

The Victory 1744 is subject to judicial review, pending litigation, and several investigations. 
Oceanica permitting has stalled, with no response to SMEARNAT request for information for about 70 days
now. Environmental issues are significant. According to the EIS, the project needs $350M to begin
operations. 
Neptune and the SMS projects have fallen off the radar screen. Last news of Neptune had Odyssey lending
them $500K.


As of the last Q, debt was near 2 times assets. Unfortunately, now those assets are encumbered, leaving very
little liquidity available. While there are claims they have cash, it is more like they had some available credit, a
virtual cash advance on the credit card.  
Poster speak of a circular reference, but using loans to service debt on loans?

You state that "The math re costs says otherwise too." yet provide no foundation or reference for "the math".


What does 'the math' say is the cost per ton?


Please provide your foundation and the numbers that your math states is the cost per ton to dredge up and
concentrate the material.


09 Feb 2015, 09:09 AM


stampcollect15
Nice try 269, but I have not offered any unit/cost estimate for the project. You have made a definitive
proclamation that the cost is $65/ton per the EIS. Can you support this? I cannot find a rationale for it based
on simple math. Enlighten me and everyone else following this thread.


09 Feb 2015, 09:15 AM


26922203
READ page 26 of 70. The $65 is based on the commodity price of $110/ton.


You are simply blindly refuting what I have provided, stating that your math shows a different number. I asked
that you provide that number, yet you obfuscate.


09 Feb 2015, 04:58 PM


stampcollect15
You don't make any sense whatsoever. "The $65 is based on the commodity price of $110/ton."


You were making a claim about costs and you're referencing the commodity price? Odyssey's cost to extract
are independent of the price of the commodity. Do you think that because you've read the MIA, this somehow
gives you authority to just make stuff up?


First of all, making a definitive statement regarding unit costs based on the MIA is irresponsible. The MIA is
not a business plan. It doesn't provide the accuracy needed to derive unit costs. How much of the operating
budget is allocated to actual dredging versus g&a, transportation, community relations? You have zero idea.


Even if you were going to take a rough stab at it and assume that all operating and capital costs go
specifically to dredging and concentrating, you're still way off the mark. Page 26 states that the annual
operating costs of the project amount to $108mn usd. The capital costs are $357mn, so assuming 10% cost
of borrow, the annual expenses would be roughly $144mn. The plan assumes 7mn tpy production. This yields
a cost per ton in the range of $21, not the $65 you state.


I don't make a claim that the $21 is the right figure because you can't get an accurate read on unit costs from
an MIA. But your $65 number is ridiculous.

In my opinion, Mayflower, you are out of your league.


When you say "The company has a cool business, but it is a terrible business to be in" you reveal a basic
misunderstanding of OMEX's business and model.


If you are confident in your thesis, however, I would encourage you to increase your short exposure. More covering =
more money for longs. Good luck!


03 Feb 2015, 08:21 AM


Mayflower Capital Partners
First of all, in order to get bullish on the stock, one has to make onerous assumptions in terms of cost reduction and
salvage recovery, plus the ability to raise sufficient capital at reasonable rates. According to my estimates, all those
assumptions seem farfetched at this stage. I have a diversified book of undervalued longs and overvalued shorts, so
the mark-to-market movements in OMEX are irrelevant, as long as I believe the short thesis to be intact.

Rory, I don't believe Mayflower is out of his league? maybe misguided by the Meson lure which to date has played

03 Feb 2015, 01:02 PM


Rugby1992
Mayflower,


Firstly, acquiring an indirect stake in OMEX is not that easy, especially if someone wants to own a majority of
Oceanica. What would happen to omex stock price if some suitor ( MOS, AGU, etc) announced their 5% threshold in
a little known shipwreck company with a , as Meson believes, " waste clay" deposit? Oops and good morning! Omex
goes thru the roof multiple times and there goes the chance to " get it cheap and indirect. ". Moreover, it's easier to
sell to your BOD and shareholders an outright strategic asset purchase ( Oceanica ) rather than a hostile takeover of
a shipwreck/ treasure hunting/ commodity wreck business.  
You are dead set on your conclusion and are coming up with reasons to justify it. Logical fallacy.  
The one thing I will agree with, however, is that omex management has been terrible with their money management ,
but that is not enough reason for someone to write 30 articles in 14 months implying they are a fraud or scam. 
Regarding liquidity, a successful capital raise may not necessarily be as dilutive as you think and it will relieve their
cash issues and bring more institutional buyers into the stock. The stock will go higher( somewhat and not as much as
an outright asset sale) and not covering some at these levels at least will look foolish. There will be better shorts out
there at that point.


03 Feb 2015, 04:53 PM


Mayflower Capital Partners
I get what you are saying. However, a cash infusion wouldn't end the ongoing cash burn. Personally, I would
raise more cash upfront through a sale of a minority interest and a secondary offering.


Just out of interest, where do you see the value in the stock?


03 Feb 2015, 06:14 PM


26922203
One has to remember that the latest loan includes options to purchase Oceanica shares. The strike price was
hidden, as explained by Odyssey that they would put them at a competitive disadvantage


As many here place some sort of value on what option prices have been (very few have been at the $2.50
advertised), would not the latest strike price be a more current estimation of said valuation method.?

26922203
The recent ruling in the Central America Court case will have a significant effect on the costs and distribution of
proceeds from the recovery. 
At last Q there was over $6M in short term debt, accounts payable, $17M (now $20M) loaned on the Central America
recovery, on top of the other loans for the Republic silver, and the structures.


Acct payable is likely near $10M by now, so looking at about $40M in debt. It is very likely that the proceeds from the
recovery will not cover the 2 loans where it was used for collateral. It appears the 2 existing loans are maxed out.
Odyssey has reported a running loss of over $20M, so it is very unlikely that a monetization of the remaining 40% of
Oceanica will allow odyssey to break even, let alone provide for any payoff of debt. 
Should the issue of the Gairsoppa cost them an additional $4.9M, where will that be paid from?

BTW, 269, the Central America ruling looks to be a positive one for OMEX. The commission rate for Calif
Gold is well below the 30% that most have been assuming, and the fact that the coins may be sold in a retail
deal means that OMEX may extract a higher price than they would have at wholesale. The drawback is that it
might take longer. Then again, CG might just make an offer to take the whole collection at a wholesale rate,
and then OMEX would be indifferent as to who sold the coins.

In READING the Court document, one would see that the original deal was struck that allowed them to
purchase the entire first recovery at wholesale, IF CGMG agreed to market the down treasure at the
respective 5%/20% rates. It does not allow for a wholesale transaction.


I feel that the ruling is a loss, as the Receiver was not counting on CGMG marketing the recovery. It was likely
that Odyssey of the conservator would do that. I feel that this is a first tier expense, like other first tier
expenses, such as Odysseys expenses, and will be taken off the top of proceed distributions, RLP being one
of several. Assuming this, Odysseys contract is with RLP, and the 45% will be of RLPs respective proceeds,
not the entirety. 
In that same deal, CGMG purchased Thompsons percentage of the down treasure.

Should Odyssey ever produce the actual contract, everyone would know and understand the conditions,
since they do not, it is telling.


This appears to be very similar to the UK deal on the Gairsoppa, with the FOI document stating one thing on
expenses, and Odyssey stating something different. Who knows what will be the outcome, but it does appear
to be a valid issue.

269, you play very fast and loose with the numbers don't you? Does it really make sense to talk about current
liabilities without also addressing current assets? Only if you're trying to stir a panic, right?


At the end of last Q there was over $10mn in receivables and cash. You would also want to add to that the portion of
the Central America recovery not in receivables which is roughly $9-10mn. You would also want to add the $13-14mn
due from Oceanica since management has said they are in the process of monetizing the asset. That's around
$33mn, less cash burn, plus any additional receivables accrued. Even if we accept your $40mn in debt (where you've
ballooned payables from 3.8mn to 10mn in one quarter), the net figure would be around $7mn.


You say "Odyssey has reported a running loss of over $20M, so it is very unlikely that a monetization of the remaining
40% of Oceanica will allow odyssey to break even, let alone provide for any payoff of debt." First of all, you need to
check your figures because Odyssey owns approximately 50% of Oceanica. OMEX shareholders believe Oceanica is
a multi-billion dollar asset (assuming mia approval), so that 50% stake could be worth approximately $1bn. So, I'm not
sure that your idea that a monetization won't help make ends meet is very accurate.

Perhaps it would be best if you read the Q.


$6.4M in account receivables is based on expenses due for the Central America. When that will be paid, and
over how long of a period of time is unknown. 
Any cash on hand was due to draws on loans. 
All proceeds that come to Odyssey from the Central America go to the 5th 3rd loan first, and then to the
marketing loan. Those loans total $20M. It is doubtful that their percentage of the recovery will cover those 2
loans. 
Accounts payable: $3.8M 
Accrued expenses: $3.2M 
Are these from the CA recovery? If so, the $6.4M due for expenses does not cover these expenses.


As noted in the last Q, mortgages and loans were about $25M, which is now about $30M due to further draws
on the loans. That is just the simple math right from the Q.


Odysseys portion of Oceanica has pledged options to the holder of the marketing loan, so they do not have
their entire percentage available. It is irrelevant what shareholders believe the value is. The market and

investors do. MAKO did not exercise, when they did, it was usually at heavy discounts, there are no mining
companies invested, and the latest options are at such a price that it was hidden.


Currently, the SEMARNAT request for information has not been answered for over 70 days. It appears to be
virtually the same team that put together the CRP submittal?


An investor could purchase the entire company right now for $73M and get all of the subsidiaries and the
entire percentage of Oceanica, yet you feel that the OMEX percentage of Oceanica alone is worth $1B?!?!

A $1bn valuation for Oceanica is so out of touch with reality. It is too bad that OMEX hasn't been more
aggressive in terms of capital raising, when the stock was significantly higher. It is going to be seriously
dilutive at this point.

mayflower, 
Odyssey did everything they could to raise capital. look how many preferred shares were sold in the $2.50 to
$3.00 range. 
The MAKO $27M, the $7.5M from GALT.


Not sure what else they could have done.

Modification: After today's close, the market cap is $62M.


Wasn't it about the same group of 'researchers' and 'scientists' who submitted the EIS for Chatham Rock
Phosphate, the same group that submitted the EIS for Oceanica?


As Market cap is but about 30% of accumulated losses on the books, and near current debt levels, one would
not hope for many additional financing schemes to be available. GALT financing was at what level, 400% ?
The recent 'marketing' loan took what to secure the financing?


Bleeding a turnip financing is left.

I covered my short position Wednesday during the free fall, but I agree with your premise that it is going to be
very tricky to attract any financing at any economically attractive rate at this point. It is going to be very
interesting to see how it plays out.

They have 150M share limit they could try to use up.


As an example, a 20M share offering, with the diluted price would only net them about $8M.


Price is far too low to attract another preferred share offering.
