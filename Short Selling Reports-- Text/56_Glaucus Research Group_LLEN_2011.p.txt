• SAIC reports show that a coal coking factory purportedly owned by LLEN is legally owned by
Dickson Lee,CEO, founder and Chairman of the company and that he holds the entity in a sole pro-
prietorship.


• Chinese government filings also show that the equity of a coal washing factory was not transferred
to LLEN as the company has stated, but is still held in a sole proprietorship by a third party.


• LLEN has also failed to disclose significant minority shareholders in two major subsidiaries and cer-
tain material risks associated with its ownership of mining rights.


• LLEN’s stunning margin profile and meteoric growth rate are the envy of its competitors, even
other Chinese coal companies. This is remarkable because apparently three executives with respec-
tive backgrounds in finance, insurance sales/Chinese restaurants and career services for the elderly
turned a fledging firm into, adjusted for size,one of the most profitable and efficient coal mining com-
panies in the world in just three years. In our opinion, this is not credible.


• SAIC filings suggest that the Company has been greatly exaggerating its net sales, net income and
the value of its assets.


• As if to lend credence to our arguments, on July 29, 2011, LLEN’s auditor gave an adverse
opinion on the company’s internal controls over financial reporting, stating that there is a rea-
sonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.


• LLEN’s CEO and founder Dickson Lee boasts a checkered past. Five different regulators have
charged Lee (acting through an agent or through LLEN) with securities violations on five separate
occasions in connection with the sale of LLEN securities.


• LLEN has had five auditors in the last ten years, including Jaspers + Hall, PC,which resigned from
LLEN when the PCAOB suspended the registration of its only two partners and barred them from
auditing publicly listed companies for a minimum of five years.


• LLEN has only had a non-‘acting’ Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for an aggregate of four
months in its history. Suspiciously, three of its past four CFOs have resigned after the end of the
company’s fiscal year but before the CFO would have had to sign off on the company’s audited
financial statements.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


Executive Summary
L&L Energy, Inc. (“LLEN” or the “company”) operates a coal mining, coal washing, coal coking and coal wholesaling busi-
ness out of the remoteYunnan and Guizhou provinces in the People’s Republic of China (“China”). LLEN also maintains a
corporate office in Seattle,Washington. Like many other Chinese companies that have been investigated and delisted by U.S.
securities regulators for fraud, LLEN went public through a reverse merger transaction (“RTO”).


On paper, LLEN’s performance appears too good to be true. In three years, with little to no experience in operating a coal
mine among its executive officers, LLEN has purportedly become one of the most profitable pound for pound coal mining
companies in the world.


The adage goes that ‘things that are too good to be true usually are.’ We believe that LLEN is no different. According to pub-
licly available SAIC filings obtained from China, LLEN has greatly exaggerated its net sales and the value of its assets. Appar-
ently we were not the only ones questioning the authenticity of LLEN’s financials.


On July 29, 2011, LLEN’s auditor submitted a report to the board of directors of the company giving an adverse opinion on
LLEN’s internal controls over financial reporting. For those who do not speak accounting, an adverse opinion from an audi-
tor indicates that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


In this report, we carve through the company’s SEC financial statements and highlight many suspicious features of the com-
pany’s ostensible record, including the fact that LLEN easily outperforms its competitors (including Chinese firms) despite its
small size and despite the fact that its executive management team had little experience operating a coal mine prior to achiev-
ing such spectacular results.


We also present compelling evidence that contrary to claims in its SEC filings, the company does not legally own certain as-
sets. Chinese filings indicate that corporate funds were used to acquire a coal coking factory that is currently held in a sole
proprietorship under the sole ownership of LLEN’s CEO and chairman.We have also found evidence that LLEN has not
properly disclosed the company’s ownership stake in other assets and subsidiaries.


In addition, we explore the trustworthiness of management. Five different regulators have charged LLEN’s CEO and chair-
man (acting through agents or the company) with securities violations in connection with the sale of LLEN securities. Fur-
ther, LLEN has a troubled history of auditor and CFO turnover, casting further doubt on the credibility of its SEC financials.


CompanyAssets Under the Chairman’s Personal Ownership
According to publicly available SAIC filings, Dickson Lee, the CEO, founder and Chairman of LLEN, is the sole owner of
Zone Lin, a coal coking factory purportedly acquired by LLEN in the third quarter of 2009. Holding assets acquired with
corporate funds in a sole proprietorship is at best a major violation of SEC disclosure rules and at worst textbook fraud.


On February 6, 2010, L&LYunnan Tianneng Industry Co. Ltd. (“TNI”), a direct subsidiary of LLEN, purportedly acquired
100% of the equity of Luoping County Zone Lin Coal Coking Factory (“Zone Lin”), a sole proprietorship, from Lao Zhong
Yang (“LaoYang”) for $2 million.


Below, we present an SAIC filing from June 2, 2010, showing that Zone Lin is a sole proprietorship and that LaoYang is the
registered owner of all of the outstanding equity interests of the firm.This in itself is problematic. LLEN purported to acquire
“100% of the equity” of Zone Lin, yet even after the acquisition date, the business was still held in a sole proprietorship by a
related party.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


This SAIC filing clearly shows that as of June 2, 2010, LaoYang, not LLEN (or its subsidiary) was the sole owner of Zone Lin
and held the business in a sole proprietorship.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


Then things get even fishier. Below is a screenshot taken yesterday from the SAIC website showing that Dickson Lee, LLEN’s
founder, CEO and chairman (not LLEN or its subsidiaries) is the sole owner of the Zone Lin coal-coking business and that
he holds the business in a sole proprietorship.


We corroborated this screenshot with a second independent SAIC report. Put simply, the above SAIC screenshot shows that
Lee deployed corporate funds to acquire an asset that he (not the company) now holds in a sole proprietorship. Holding as-
sets acquired with corporate funds in a sole proprietorship is at best a material omission of a related party transaction from SEC
financials and at worst textbook fraud.

Who Legally Owns Hong Xing?
Local Chinese filings also reveal that LLEN does not legally own another important asset.


According to LLEN’s SEC filings, the company purportedly acquired 100% of the equity of the Hong Xing coal washing fa-
cility (“Hong Xing”) on November 30, 2009, through its subsidiaryTNI.1


Based on our conversations with Chinese lawyers and accountants, it is our belief that under Chinese law, LLEN’s subsidiary
TNI, as a sino-foreign JV entity, would not be permitted to acquire Hong Xing as long as the entity remains a sole propri-
etorship. It is our understanding that under Chinese law, (a) the interests in a sole proprietorship may only be owned by a Chi-
nese national, (b) all assets, investments and income from the sole proprietorship belong to the natural person who owns the
interest in the sole proprietorship and (c) such natural person is responsible for all liabilities and debts of the sole proprietor-
ship.


Even though LLEN states that it “owns 100% of the equity of Hong Xing” in fact the equity could not have been transferred
toTNI so long as Hong Xing remained a sole proprietorship. SAIC filings corroborate this conclusion.


According to an SAIC filing signedApril 15, 2010,Hong Xing remained a sole proprietorship that was wholly owned by Hong
Xing Li, the same individual who was supposed to have sold the factory to LLEN.


L&L ENERGY, INC.


1Without any interim disclosure, according to LLEN’s FY 2011 Form 10-K, the company transferred Hong Xing fromTNI to a newly formed subsidiary,Yunnan L&LTai
Fung (“Tai Fung”) in March of 2011.

http://baike.baidu.com/view/51349.htm

http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1137083/000116854211000044/form10k_v22final.htm
The above filing shows that as of April 2010, five months after the consummation of the purported sale, the company did not
legally own the equity of the Hong Xing coal washing factory even though LLEN claimed to have acquired 100% of the eq-
uity of the entity in its SEC filings.


Because a third party is the legal owner of the Hong Xing business, LLEN or its shareholders may have to litigate against him
to obtain legal title to the assets. A dispute between shareholders and a local Chinese businessman over assets located in China
is an unappetizing prospect.


Chinese courts are notoriously corrupt, arbitrary and protective of local businesses and industry.2 Notions of judicial inde-
pendence do not apply. As a result, for foreign investors or a Sino-foreign JV such as TNI, we suspect that litigating against a
local Chinese businessman in a Chinese court would be a Sisyphean task. Further hindering any prospect of recovery are any
relationships Hong Xing Li may have with the local government and state owned enterprises, which would only magnify his
influence over the judicial system.


Together, Zone Lin and Hong Xing provided approximately $10 million in net cash to the company’s operations in FY 2010.
Yet the company does not have legal title to the equity of either of these businesses. Zone Lin is held by the CEO and Chair-
man in a sole proprietorship and Hong Xin is held by a third party in a sole proprietorship. In each case, LLEN claims to own
100% of the businesses’ equity. This is at best a major omission from the company’s SEC disclosures and at worst fraud.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


Undisclosed Minority Shareholders
SAIC filings also show that contrary to the company’s claims, LLEN’s two sino-foreign joint ventures are not wholly-owned.


According to the company’s 2011 Form 10-K,LLEN owns 100% of Kunming Biaoyu Industrial Boiler Ltd. (“KMC”) and has
a 98% “controlling interest” inTNI.


But SAIC records forTNI show that it is only 70% owned by LLEN. The other 30% of TNI’s equity is owned by an entity
calledYunnanTianneng Industry, which is wholly owned by an unrelated third party, Yunnan Xinzhongan Fire Engineer-
ing Installation Co., LTD.


Strangely, we found support for our evidence buried in LLEN’s SEC filings. A January 1, 2010, acquisition agreement states
thatTNI is in fact a sino-foreign JV “(which L&L owns 70% voting equity andTianneng Co. owns 30%).”


This is staggering. LLEN claims to own a 98% controlling interest in a subsidiary in its Form 10-K but states that it only owns
70% in another SEC filing. Filings in China indicate the real number is 70% and that LLEN has been misrepresenting the per-
centage of ownership of its subsidiaries.


In addition, SAIC records obtained in May 2011 show that LLEN only owns 60% of KMC. Four minority shareholders own
the other 40%.


The following table summarizes the evidence:


At best, this is a material omission from LLEN’s SEC disclosures. At worst, this is fraud.


Mining Rights – Risky Business
As LLEN discloses to shareholders in its public filings, two of the company’s most important mining assets are owned not by
the company but are held (surprise!) by individuals in a sole proprietorships. Although the company is forthright in alerting
shareholders to this arrangement with respect to the mines, we believe that the company has downplayed the material risk of
this legal structure to LLEN’s shareholders.This is a risk we believe is only highlighted by the fact that LLEN purportedly ac-
quired an additional“20% ownership” interest in its two primary mining assets for no consideration.


The core of LLEN’s business is the DaPuAn Mine and theTuSong Mine (collectively, the “2 Mines”).
According to LLEN’s SEC filings, in 2008, the company acquired a 60% interest in the 2 Mines from two individuals,Xu Ban-
Sheng (who owned the DaPuAn Mine) andYang Xiao-Shu. These two individuals are Chinese nationals, and according to
the JointVenture Contract provided by LLEN, held their respective coal mines in sole proprietorships. SAIC filings indicate
that both mines are still held in sole proprietorships and that each of their respective owners, not LLEN, will each have the
legal title to the ownership interests in the mines. To be fair to LLEN, it does disclose that it does not technically “own” ei-
ther mine under Chinese law.


But LLEN’s prior disclosures made it seem as though the company could, and indeed was on the verge of, registering an own-
ership interest in the equity of the mines with the Chinese government.According to the company’s 2010 Form 10-K, LLEN
was “in the process of registering our equity ownership interest in the DaPuAn and SuTsong Mines with the
Chinese government, under the provisional name “L & L Coal Partners” through a nominee who is a Chinese
citizen that holds our equity ownership in trust for the benefit of the Company under an agency agreement
executed in April 2008.” This sentence made the company’s claims to the future rights of the coal at 2 Mines appear more
stable and legitimate to investors.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


Troublingly, the above sentence appeared in the company’s Form 10-K’s for FY 2009 and FY 2010. It was omitted from
the company’s FY 2011 Form 10-K. It is our opinion that this omission was not by accident. In its FY 2009 and FY 2010
Form 10-Ks, this sentence conveyed to shareholders that its interest in the mining rights at the 2 Mines could be reg-
istered with the government and would thus be more secure. Instead, because both mines are owned in sole proprietorships,
LLEN could not directly own or register such an equity interest.


Make no mistake; the company has disclosed that it does not directly own an interest in the mine. But we believe that its FY
2009 and FY 2010 disclosures that it “was in the process of registering” an equity ownership interest in the 2 Mines with the
Chinese government was misleading and downplayed the risks that would be obvious to shareholders if the company had
stated clearly that an equity ownership interest in a sole proprietorship could not be registered.


What bothers us about LLEN’s rights to the 2 Mines is that they seem to acquire them cheaply and that the company does
not disclose the terms of the deals. OnAugust 1, 2009, the company increased its ownership of the 2 Mines from 60% to 80%
with “no consideration given by the company to the non-controlling interest holders.”Despite the importance of these as-
sets to its business, LLEN did not file a Form 8-K detailing this transaction.


As of Q3 2009, according to LLEN, the 2 Mines were already incredibly profitable. Why would the minority shareholder
transfer 20% of an amazingly profitable business to LLEN for free?What did the company get for nothing?Would a
sole proprietor who owns a mine be willing to give up another “20%” because they knew at the end of the day, the mine is
owned only by the proprietorship and not LLEN?


Support for our argument that sole proprietorships present significant undisclosed risks to investors comes from LLEN itself.
In March 2011, the company acquired an interest in the DaPing Mine.The Equity Transfer Agreement governing the trans-
action requires the seller to “change the existing proprietorship business format to a corporation format” upon consummation
of the acquisition. In fact, under the EquityTransfer Agreement, the failure to change the DaPing Coal Mine from a propri-
etorship to a corporation is considered a “default” under the contract, releasing LLEN from its obligation to pay the seller.


The fact that LLEN required the seller to change the structure of the DaPing Mine to a corporation from a sole proprietor-
ship at the risk of a default under the contract should tell investors that the legal structure of a target entity is of paramount
importance.


But the company does not disclose the risks of its legal structure in its public filings. A risk we believe is only highlighted by
the fact that LLEN purportedly acquired an extra 20% ownership stake in its most profitable business for free. If LLEN
can get something for nothing, what does it really own?

LLEN’s By the Numbers
One of the common characteristics of Chinese reverse mergers that are fabricating their SEC financial statements is that the
company’s performance appears too good to be true. LLEN is no exception. In fact, LLEN’s financial performance is so far
superior to its competitors that it leaves only two choices: either LLEN is so much more efficient and profitable (adjusted for
size) than its competitors that it has revolutionized the coal mining business or LLEN is fabricating its SEC filed financial
statements.


According to the SEC filings, LLEN is one of the most efficient and profitable (pound for pound) coal mining companies in
the world:


As depicted in the table above, LLEN’s gross margins and net income margins were incredible as compared to U.S.-based coal
mining companies, but in line withYZC, its Chinese competitor. What does not make sense is thatYZC, PCX,ACI,WLB
andANR are much larger companies than LLEN. We would expect that bigger companies would achieve economies of scale
in a capital-intensive industry such as coal mining. Yet with the exception of YZC,LLEN outperforms all of its larger brethren.


We will concede that certain financial metrics vary across geographic markets depending on the number of competitors, the
maturity of the market, costs of labor etc… so in order to be fair to LLEN, we compared financial metrics between LLEN
andYCZ, a much larger Chinese-based coal mine operator.

Gross Margins 46% 46% 18% 24% N/S 20%

All other company information from January 1, 2008 - December 31, 2010
WLB - coal only segment was broken out and reflected above
L&L ENERGY, INC.


The above chart is incredible. Keep in mind thatYCZ is almost 10 times larger than LLEN if measured by revenue. Surpris-
ingly, LLEN’s gross margins and net income margins are similar toYZC’s despite the benefit of economies of scale thatYZC
should enjoy.


More suspiciously,LLEN’s return on average equity and return on average assets were double the returns forYZC.For the most
recent 9 months ending January 31, 2011, LLEN enjoyed a Return on Average Equity of 50% and a Return on Average As-
sets of 37% whileYZC had a ROAE of 28% and a ROAA of 14%. If we look at the 2009 numbers the ROAE and ROAA
difference is even more shocking.


LLEN’s phenomenal ROAE indicates that the company is acquiring its assets for much cheaper thanYZC. This corroborates
our findings discussed above, which suggest that LLEN does not actually own all of the assets it purports to have acquired.


Further, the company’s incredible ROAA indicates that it is almost twice as efficient asYZC at deriving net income from its
assets. Given that the company is a recent entrant into the market, we do not find such performance credible.


In short, LLEN is one of the most efficient and profitable (adjusted for size) coal mining companies in the world. It boasts even
more impressive returns on equity and returns on assets than even its Chinese competitor. This seems ridiculous. What makes
this story even harder to believe is that LLEN conjured its spectacular coal mining business . . .


Out of Thin Air
LLEN’s success on paper is nothing short of a miracle. In just 3 years LLEN went from a fledgling turnaround firm prima-
rily selling air compressors to a coal mining business that purportedly generates higher margins and a better return on assets
and equity than almost any other coal mining company in the world. To boot, LLEN achieved these results without any
top-level executive having any prior experience whatsoever in operating a coal mine. How can a company come out of
nowhere, led by a founder and chairman with no direct experience in operating a mining business, and effectively become one
of the most profitable pound-for-pound coal mining companies in the world?


Prior to 2008, LLEN’s business model was, according to the company’s 2007 Form 10-K, to acquire an interest in privately
held Chinese companies and then leverage western management and accounting techniques to improve stodgy and archaic Chi-
nese business practices.The company’s primary focus was an air compressor business.

More importantly, prior to 2008, LLEN’s business model was not to mine coal.3 In fact, in 2007, LLEN positioned itself as
a broker of coal mining rights when its subsidiary,KMC, sold the rights to a coal mine to a third party for cash rather
than establish an operation.


Suddenly, in May 2008, LLEN acquired rights in two operating coal mines (DaPuAn Mine and Su Tsong Mine) and in 3
years, LLEN boasts more impressive returns on assets and equity than companies that have been in the coal mining business
for over 100 years. Does that pass the smell test?


Even more suspiciously, other than CFOs (discussed below), until this year LLEN has only had three executive level offi-
cers in its history,none of whom, prior to joining LLEN, had any experience in the coal mining business. Ac-
cording to the company’s Form 10-K filings for FY 2008, 2009 and 2010 LLEN’s only non-CFO executive officers were (i)
the founder and chairman,Dickson Lee, (ii) his brother Paul Lee (who served as chairman and CEO for a short time) and (iii)
Clayton Fong.


Dickson Lee’s background is in accounting and finance. Prior to his brief stint in charge of LLEN, Paul Lee was an insurance
salesman and president of the Chinese Restaurant Association of Michigan. Clayton Fong, prior to joining LLEN,was the ex-
ecutive director for 13 years of a not for profit organization in Seattle that placed Asian American senior citizens in the work-
force. Other than a smattering of “interim” CFOs, LLEN’s 2008, 2009, and 2010 Form 10-Ks do not mention any other
executive officers.


This is remarkable because apparently three executives with respective backgrounds in finance, insurance sales/Chinese restau-
rants and career services for the elderly turned a fledging firm into, adjusted for size, one of the most efficient and profitable
coal mining companies in the world in just three years. The alternative explanation, and our opinion, is that LLEN has been
fabricating its financial statements.


SAIC Filings
SAIC filings corroborate our suspicion that LLEN’s incredible financial performance is simply not credible. According to pub-
licly available SAIC filings for the calendar year 2009, LLEN’s revenues are much smaller and its assets are worth considerably
less than the company claims in its SEC financial statements.4


According to 2009 calendar year SAIC filings, LLEN’s assets are only 25% of the value that the company
claims in its SEC filings and the company’s net sales are four times smaller than the company claims in its
SEC filings.

There has been much debate recently about the validity of SAIC filings. The SAIC is a government agency that, among other
functions, issues business licenses to Chinese firms. In order to obtain and renew a business license, which is required to op-
erate in China, a Chinese company must file an annual inspection report with a local government office containing a balance
sheet and an income statement.


Brokers pumping small cap Chinese stocks often argue that SAIC filings do not match SEC filings because the SAIC is a busi-
ness registrar and it does not review the accuracy of submitted financial statements. This makes no sense. Why would a gov-
ernment agency ask a company to submit a balance sheet or income statement and then not care if it is blatantly false? More
importantly, what would a company gain by lying on financial statements submitted to the SAIC?


Some small cap brokers have argued that Chinese companies understate revenue in SAIC filings so as to avoid the attention
of corrupt government officials. This argument is weak. Nothing should attract more attention from potentially corrupt gov-
ernment officials than raising tens of millions of dollars in cash throughAmerican capital markets. Regardless,why are investors
comfortable with a company that lies on any financial statement filed with any governmental agency, in the U.S. or China?


Western investors defending the discrepancy between financial statements filed with the SAIC and those filed with the SEC
should consider the following decision box:


Whereas for a Chinese company there is large upside and limited downside to lying to the SEC, there is by comparison no
upside and a potentially large downside to lying to the SAIC. So if there is a discrepancy between SEC and SAIC filings, it is
logically more likely that the SEC filings are false. Deductive reasoning aside, empirical evidence shows that there are many
examples of legitimate companies that file financial statements with the SAIC which are consistent with their SEC financials.
The company’s Chinese SAIC filings show that LLEN’s revenues and net income are much smaller than reported and its as-
sets are much less valuable than the company claims in its SEC financials.


Judge a Company By the Company It Keeps
Dickson Lee, LLEN’s founder,CEO and Chairman boasts a checkered history of allegedly making material misrepresentations
to investors in connection with the sale of LLEN stock. In addition, the only other key executive officer at LLEN other than
a smattering of CFOs landed at the company after apparently being dismissed for misconduct from his previous position as di-
rector of a charitable organization.


DICKSON LEE’S TRAIL OF TEARS


Regulators have charged Dickson Lee and/or LLEN with violating securities laws in connection with the sale of LLEN stock
on five separate occasions.5 Public documents reveal that prior to listing LLEN on the NASDAQ,Dickson Lee was able to
raise at least $2.8 million through the sale of unregistered private stock and warrant offerings. Lee was able to attract investors
thanks to incredible financial projections contained in a series of Private Placement Memoranda (“PPMs”). Four different state
securities regulators and FINRA initiated enforcement actions against Lee, his agent and/or LLEN, in most cases allegingma-
terial misrepresentations of fact in connection with offerings of LLEN securities. In plain English, law enforcement
charged Dickson Lee with lying to prospective investors.

WASHINGTON


In April 2009, the Securities Division for the State ofWashington charged that, in connection with the offering of LLEN se-
curities, Lee:


1.Misrepresented to investors the percentage of the gross proceeds of the offering that certain retained referral agents
and brokers could receive as a commission for their services; and


2. Failed to provide a reasonable basis upon which the projected operating results were made in [Private Placement
Memorandas (“PPM”) marketed over the phone to investors.]


Lee’s pitch to investors was that LLEN would acquire state-owned Chinese enterprises and, after a touch of American busi-
ness acumen and management expertise, such businesses would quickly turn profitable. Lee’s PPMs projected profits of $5.6
million by the end of 2004 despite the fact that LLEN’s SEC filings indicated that the company’s revenues were less than
$300,000 at the close of its April 30, 2003 fiscal year.


In addition, the Securities Division for the State ofWashington charged that Lee’s PPM deceived investors by stating that bro-
kers or referral agents could only receive a commission up to 20% of the gross proceeds of any capital committed by the in-
vestor, when in fact, Lee had promised a 35% commission to Steven Johnston,who was not even a licensed broker-dealer.


Essentially, the State ofWashington accused Lee of (1) lying to investors about the percentage of their dollars that would go to
his agents and (2) making wild claims about future performance of LLEN that had no basis in fact. These types of accusations
should sound hauntingly familiar to investors in U.S.-listed Chinese securities. But the State ofWashington was not alone in
alleging that Lee and/or LLEN violated the law.


FINRA


On January 12, 2007, Lee entered into a Letter of Acceptance,Waiver and Consent with FINRA whereby FINRA fined Lee
$65,000 and suspended him from associating with any NASD member in any capacity for one year. FINRA concluded
that “in connection with his company’s offers and sales of securities, Lee caused his company to make untrue statements
of material fact and omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements that it made, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.”


CALIFORNIA


On May 16, 2006, the State of California, Department of Corporations issued a Desist and Refrain Order against Lee, LLEN
and Johnston in connection with the sale of LLEN common stock. The State of California alleged “that the securities offered
and sold by Johnston … Lee and LLEN were offered and sold in this state by means of written or oral communications that
included untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the state-
ments made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in violation of section 25401 of
the CSL.”Again, in layman’s terms, the State of California accused Lee (through his agent) of lying to investors.


CONNECTICUT


OnApril 26, 2007, the Banking Commissioner of the State of Connecticut entered into a consent order with LLEN for vio-
lations of state securities laws in connection with the offering and/or sale of unregistered LLEN securities and of the use of
an unregistered agent. Pursuant to such order, the Commissioner fined the company and barred LLEN for a period of ten
years from selling securities in the State of Connecticut. This punishment was no mere “parking ticket.” For regulators to
ban LLEN from selling securities in the state of Connecticut for a decade, clearly regulators believed that LLEN’s conduct was
a serious violation.


NEW MEXICO


OnMarch 14, 2006, the State of New Mexico, Securities Division, entered into a consent agreement with Dickson Lee,LLEN,
and Johnston.The allegations included the use of an unregistered securities salesperson and failure to adequately supervise
Johnston in connection with the sale of securities.

In sum, securities enforcement agencies around the U.S. have charged Lee and/or LLEN with violations on five separate oc-
casions. According to these charges, Lee engaged in a pattern of behavior that looks remarkably similar to accusations lev-
eled at other Chinese RTOs accused of, or found to have been committing, fraud.


CLAYTON FONG


Clayton Fong, LLEN’s ExecutiveVice President of US operations and Lee’s right hand man, also has a history of troubled al-
legations. From 1996 to 2009, Fong served as the CEO of National Asian Pacific Center onAging (“NAPCA”), a Seattle-area
non-profit organization.


According to an investigative report by the SeattleTimes, NAPCA dismissed Fong in 2009 following an internal review,which,
according to the NAPCA board chairman,“uncovered a pattern of behavior and conduct of great concern to [the
board].”The chairman stated that the board “lost confidence in [Fong] to lead our organization.”


When pressed for additional details, the NAPCA’s chairman stated that the board “concluded that a number of [Fong’s] ac-
tions and conduct fell short of the standards we set in [the NAPCA’s] policies and bylaws”. In connection with Fong’s dis-
missal, the Chairman also stated that “we have a fiduciary duty here to look after the organization’s and funders’ resources.”
It does not take much to read between the lines: Fong appears to have been fired for misconduct potentially related to the mis-
use of a charitable organization’s funds.


This was not the first time Fong came under scrutiny for his use of the charity’s money. In 1999, Federal auditors working at
the behest of the Labor Department issued a highly-critical report on the NAPCA which questioned $330,000 in expendi-
tures and accused the NAPCA of “misusing taxpayer money to pay for golf balls, tobacco products, a Christmas
party and a trip to LasVegas for its executive director [Clayton Fong].”


The SeattleTimes reported that the federal audit investigation uncovered the following questionable transactions:


• Fong told employees that the NAPCA would pay a bonus of $1,300 to 21 workers, each of whom agreed to do-
nate $1,000 back to the agency to use at its discretion.


• The NAPCA spent nearly $35,000 on travel and miscellaneous expenses that were inappropriately charged to fed-
eral grants, withmost of the costs incurred by Fong.


• The NAPCA also incurred $13,700 in questionable travel expenses and credit-card charges, including a side trip by
Fong to LasVegas from Los Angeles, where NAPCA also has offices.


In sum, in order to be long LLEN, an investor would have to have confidence in the credibility and trustworthiness of a founder
and chairman that has been charged by multiple different regulators for securities violations in connection with the sale of LLEN
stock and his lieutenant who appears to have been fired from his previous position as a director of a charity for misconduct.


A lot of the above information has already been discussed in the public forum, but we wanted to reiterate some of manage-
ment’s troubling background because we believe that the trustworthiness of management is of paramount importance when
evaluating the credibility of Chinese RTOs.

If This Is HowYou TreatYour Friends…
LLEN’s transparency and the quality of the company’s disclosures has consistently been a grim joke at investors’ expense.One
example stands out in a crowded field. Between 2008 and 2010, LLEN engaged in a series of private placement transactions
with accredited investors that were favorable to purchasers and dilutive of existing shareholders. LLEN did not disclose the
terms and conditions of most of these private placements to investors in an 8-K filing, as we believe should be customary for
a transparent public company performing capital raises. Although not technically in violation of the SEC’s disclosure rules
(Reg D Rule 506), the opacity of these transactions is troubling. Perhaps the company was tight lipped because the terms of
the deal would have been wildly offensive to any existing shareholder.


On October 8, 2009, LLEN sold 1,371,021 units to accredited investors at $3.90/unit.The previous day’s closing price of
LLEN’s common stock was $5.50/share, meaning that LLEN sold the stock at 29% discount to the previous day’s close.


Each unit sold was comprised of 1 share of common stock and 0.6 warrants (i.e. 60% warrant coverage). The warrants had a
5-year term to expiration and a $5.62 strike price.Using the Black Scholes option-pricing model, a 75% implied volatility, and
the warrant inputs listed above, the implied value of the warrants sold in this capital raise equate to $3.36/share. Multiplying
this value by the 60% warrant coverage per unit equates to a per share value of $2.02/share. Netting off this free embedded
option value from the original unit purchase price of $3.90 equates to a net purchase price per share of $1.88. If you did not
follow the math do not worry.


The bottom line is that management was effectively selling shares of common stock through this private placement at only one
third of the price6 that public investors would have paid in the open market. LLEN made the same deal again on November
6, 2009, when LLEN issued 835,389 units at the same price and under the same terms as the October 8 issuance. In other
words, management was diluting existing shareholders and offering sweetheart deals to a select group of private investors.


In the aggregate, the company issued 5.3 million warrants through direct private placements in FY2010, which equates to
nearly 25% of the Company’s 2009 fiscal year end fully diluted shares outstanding. Thanks for investing existing shareholders!
Allow the company to repay you by diluting the value of your investment.


More offensive, one hedge fund participated in a series of direct private placements from 2008-2010 timeframe in which it ac-
quired approximately 280,000 shares at heavily discounted prices relative to market price of the stock. The associated war-
rant coverage with respect to these purchases could have been as high as 15 times the number of underlying
shares (approximately 4.25 million warrants received for purchasing 280,000 share of stock)! In layman’s terms,LLEN diluted
existing investors to give a hedge fund what appears to be as close to free money as exists onWall Street.


To be clear,we are not alleging that these transactions violated any securities laws or Reg D specifically.We are however, gravely
concerned over the transparency of the company and the quality of LLEN’s disclosures with respect to these transactions. If
LLEN had an interest in transparency, it would issue an 8-K describing the terms and conditions of each one of its private place-
ments. Are these deals not being fully disclosed because they are offensive to shareholders?


LLEN’s Auditors:WhoWatches theWatchmen?
The absence of internal controls has also been a consistent issue with reverse-merged Chinese companies accused of commit-
ting fraud. During a recent speech, SEC commissioner Luis A.Aguilar stated a common denominator among Chinese RTOs
was systematic concerns with the quality of the auditing and financial reporting.Aguilar warned:


I am worried by the systematic concerns surrounding the quality of the financial reporting by these companies. In particular, according to
a recent report by the staff of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), U.S. auditing firms may be issuing audit
opinions on the financials, but not engaging in any of their own work.37 Instead, the U.S. firm may be issuing an opinion based almost
entirely on work performed by Chinese audit firms. If this is true, it could appear that the U.S. audit firms are simply selling their name
and PCAOB-registered status because they are not engaging in independent activity to confirm that the work they are relying on is of
high quality.This is significant for a lot of reasons, including that the PCAOB has been prevented from inspecting audit firms in China.


LLEN has never retained an auditor that made Inside PublicAccounting’s list of top 100 firms. More troubling, it appears that


6$1.88 in the private placement vs. $5.50 in the open market.

L&L ENERGY, INC.


with the exception of Kabani, LLEN’s auditors have another thing in common: they are all small firms headquartered in the
US who for the most part, it appears, outsource accounting work to Chinese auditors. Just as Aguilar warned, such auditors
may have been issuing audit opinions based almost entirely on work performed by Chinese audit firms.


Given the record of certain of the audit firms listed above,we believe investors should have great concerns over the validity of
LLEN’s financials.


JASPERS


Of particular concern is Jaspers, an accountant instrumental in LLEN’s entry into the coal mining business. Jaspers bore many
of the characteristics that Aguilar warned of in his recent speech: it only had two partners and three staff members working
out of two offices in Colorado. Jaspers did not have any offices in China, but it was responsible for verifying the validity of
LLEN’s acquisitions of the DaPuAn Mine and theTuSong Mine, which have become the core of LLEN’s business.


Jaspers only quits LLEN’s auditors when the PCAOB sentenced the two partner firm to the accounting equivalent of the
death penalty. On October 21, 2008, PCAOB revoked Jaspers’ registration and barred its only two partners from being asso-
ciated with a registered public accounting firm for five years.The PCAOB determined that Jaspers and both its name part-
ners repeatedly violated PCAOB auditing standards from 2005 through 2007.


Among other sins, the PCAOB stated that Jaspers failed to “perform adequate, or sometimes any, audit procedures in areas
such as cash, deferred revenue, business acquisition accounting, equity, income taxes, related party transactions, and using the
work of specialists.”


Notably, in connection with a publicly listed company named Bio-Warm, the PCAOB found that Jaspers “failed to perform
any procedures to test the values Bio-Warm assigned to the tangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the business
combination and failed to test in any way management’s representation that Bio-Warm was the acquiring entity in the busi-
ness combination.”

If Jaspers was not performing any work to verify the value of assets acquired by Bio-Warm, a California company, can investors
have confidence that Jaspers was performing any work to verify the value of the coal mines that LLEN acquired in China? If
Jaspers failed to verify management’s representations regarding a purported acquisition by a California company, can investors
have confidence that Jaspers was independently verifying the representations of a management team operating a business in
China?


Alarmingly for investors in LLEN, Jaspers was instrumental in LLEN’s start on the fast track to becoming a profitable coal min-
ing company. Jaspers audited LLEN’s financial statements for three crucial years and signed off on the company’s 2006 10-KSB,
as well as its 2007 and 2008 Form 10-K filings. Jaspers audited the company when it acquired its first coal asset and transformed
itself from a middling Chinese turnaround firm into a flashy high-growth mining company, despite an executive management
team with no discernable experience or expertise in operating a coal mine.


Jaspers is just the type of auditor about which SEC Commissioner Aguillar recently warned investors: it had no presence in
China and according to the PCAOB it routinely failed to engage in independent activity to confirm its representations of its
clients. In other words, Jaspers bore the characteristics of an accounting firm commonly associated with fraudulent Chinese
companies.


KABANI


LLEN replaced Jaspers with Kabani, a firm that has audited a number of U.S.-listed Chinese companies accused of, or found
to have been committing, fraud. Kabani’s roster includes:


The above table should not engender confidence in any investor relying on Kabani as a bulwark against fraud.Neither
should the PCAOB assessment of Kabani’s 2010 auditing process, despite the fact that Kabani can boast a Beijing office.


The PCAOB’s 2010 inspection of Kabani found, in over 60% of the audits performed by the firm,“deficiencies of such sig-
nificance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm did not obtain sufficient competent evidential
matter to support its opinion on the issuer’s financial statements.”


ADVERSE ACCOUNTING OPINIONS


Kabani may have noticed that its reputation was negatively affected by the adverse PCAOB inspection and its association with
Chinese companies accused of fraud.


On July 29, 2011, LLEN’s auditor submitted a report to the board of directors of the company giving an adverse opinion on
LLEN’s internal control over financial reporting. For those who do not speak accounting, an adverse opinion from an audi-
tor indicates that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Kabani found the following material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls:


• The Company did not maintain effective controls over the process of ensuring timely preparation of its con-
solidated financial statements to allow for sufficient review prior to its filing deadline.


• Additionally, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the process of ensuring appropriate reconcilia-
tion of several account balances, which resulted in several adjustments to the Company’s consolidated financial state-
ments, principally including presentation of related party balances;disaggregation of assets and liabilities on
the face of the balance sheet, as well as reconciliations of cash.


• Lastly, the Company did not correctly characterize the accounting transaction related to treasury stock,
which occurred during the period under audit.


In plain English,Kabani is accusing the company of not giving auditors enough time to properly review the company’s financial
statements and not properly maintaining controls over the process of reconciling cash and account balances and the process of
breaking out the value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In a profession known for mild manners and book-
ish subtlety, an accountant’s warning to investors does not come much clearer.


Thus Kabani issued an adverse opinion on LLEN’s internal control over financial reporting, indicating that there is a reason-
able possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.


Nor can investors place their faith in the company’s litany of “interim” CFOs, most of whom suspiciously resigned just be-
fore they would have been asked to sign off on LLEN’s financial statements.


Woe Be the CFO
In its history, LLEN has only had a full time CFO (that is, a CFO who was not saddled with an “Interim” or “Acting”CFO
label) for an aggregate of less than 4 months. We believe LLEN’s high turnover at the CFO position should deeply
concern investors. In total, LLEN has had 5 CFOs in the last 3 years.


TIMING IS EVERYTHING


Look again at the left column of the table above. Notice a pattern?Alarmingly,3 of LLEN’s 4 former CFOs resigned soon
after the end of the company’s fiscal year (April 30) but before the CFO would have been required to certify the company’s
audited financial statements to the SEC.

The timing of these CFO resignations is noteworthy and suspicious. If any of the former CFOs were disturbed by the audit
process or suspected that LLEN was falsifying its financial statements, he or she would certainly want to resign before certifying
to the SEC that such financial statements fairly presented, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of the op-
erations of the company.To our knowledge, none of the CFOs have ever stated that they resigned from LLEN because they sus-
pected the that the company was committing fraud;but we believe that it is inherently suspicious that almost all of them resigned
almost immediately prior to the time when they would have had to vouch for the accuracy of the company’s financials.


A recent study of public company accounting fraud shows that, in the three years prior to the discovery of fraud,companies manipulating
financial statements experienced higher CFO turnover than non-manipulating firms.7 The study suggests that turnover is high at fraud-
ulent companies because CFOs who refuse to bury their head in the sand either leave or are fired. In LLEN’s case, the shoe certainly fits.


We believe that the history of CFO turnover at LLEN and the suspicious timing of the resignations of many of the company’s
CFOs is a serious red flag to investors. In fact, the only CFO in the history of the company to sign off on consecutive annual
reports was RosemaryWang…


Rosemary’s Baby
Confucius once said that “he who wishes to secure the good of others, has already secured his own.”We are suspicious that
Dickson Lee applied a Machiavellian bent to this old proverb about charity.


OnApril 10,2009 Lee donated one million of his personal shares, at the time roughly valued at $1 million, to ChungYuan Chris-
tian University Development Foundation of NorthAmerica (the “ChungYuan Charity”), a California non-profit organization.


According to publicly available tax records, the ChungYuan Charity was founded in 2008. In 2008, the charity received only
$51,623 in grants. However, the following year, the ChungYuan Charity received $3,288,396 in grants, almost a third of
which came from Dickson Lee. No doubt a banner year.


But amere twomonths after Dickson Lee’s unusually gracious donation,RosemaryWang agreed to become the actingCFOof LLEN.


Suspiciously, there are numerous documents linking RosemaryWang to the charity that received the timely and large dona-
tion from Dickson Lee. First,we believe that RosemaryWang is the name partner ofWang and ChouAccountancy Corp., the
accounting firm that prepared the ChunYuan Charity’s tax returns. Second, multiple public records list RosemaryWang as
the principal and primary contact of the ChunYuan Charity.


To be clear, we have no evidence that RosemaryWang directly benefited from the donation, or that Dickson Lee made the
donation in order to secure her loyalty, services or willful ignorance to fraud. However, we believe it is inherently suspicious
that RosemaryWang, the only CFO in the history of LLEN to ever sign off on two of the company’s annual au-
dited financial statements, was affiliated with, and possibly a principal of, a newly-formed charity which received an enor-
mous and unusual donation immediately prior to her becoming acting CFO of LLEN.


Hiding in Plain Sight
Because of the negative publicity surrounding Chinese RTOs and the fact that many such U.S.-listed Chinese companies have
been accused of, or have been committing, fraud, LLEN has recently waged a public relations campaign to shirk the “reverse
merger” label. Recently,RedChipCompanies, LLEN’s investor-relations gurus,went so far as to state that LLEN was “not re-
ally a reverse merger.” This is disingenuous to say the least.


According to LLEN’s FY 2003 Form 10-KSB filing:“in May of 2001, the Company, through a reverse merger, becomes
a SEC public reporting company.”


Like many of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies that have been accused of, or have been committing, fraud, LLEN circumvented a
traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO),which requires auditors, underwriters and prospective buyers to conduct a deeper due dili-
gence investigation, in favor of an RTO. It is offensive to the investing community that LLEN now tries to conceal its true identity.

Shevlin of the University ofWashington Foster School of Business, and Mei Feng and ShuqingLuo of the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business.

Valuation
Based on its auditor’s adverse opinion of the company’s internal controls, the fact that the company only reports to have less
than $5 million in cash, and the fact that various Chinese third parties have legal title to significant assets of the company lo-
cated in China, we value LLEN’s equity at less than $1.00 per share.

Conclusion
No section of this report should be read in isolation. In our view, the strength of each piece of evidence or argument rein-
forces the inferences we can draw from the other pieces of evidence or arguments.We are undoubtedly biased (very), but in
our opinion, the cumulative evidence that LLEN is committing fraud or at least omitting material information from its SEC
financial statements is overwhelming.


To review:


• SAIC reports show that a coal coking factory purportedly owned by LLEN is legally owned by Dickson Lee, CEO, founder
and Chairman of the company and that he holds the entity in a sole proprietorship.


• Chinese government filings also show that the equity of a coal washing factory was not transferred to LLEN as the company
has stated, but is still held in a sole proprietorship by a third party.


• LLEN has also failed to disclose significant minority shareholders in two major subsidiaries and certain material risks associ-
ated with its ownership of mining rights.


• LLEN’s stunning margin profile and meteoric growth rate are the envy of its competitors, even other Chinese coal companies.
This is remarkable because apparently three executives with respective backgrounds in finance, insurance sales/Chinese restau-
rants and career services for the elderly turned a fledging firm into, adjusted for size, one of the most profitable and efficient
coal mining companies in the world in just three years. In our opinion, this is not credible.


• SAIC filings suggest that the Company has been greatly exaggerating its net sales, net income and the value of its assets.


• As if to lend credence to our arguments, on July 29, 2011, LLEN’s auditor gave an adverse opinion on the company’s inter-
nal controls over financial reporting, stating that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


• LLEN’s CEO and founder Dickson Lee boasts a checkered past. Five different regulators have charged Lee (acting through
an agent or through LLEN) with securities violations on five separate occasions in connection with the sale of LLEN securities.


• LLEN has had five auditors in the last ten years, including Jaspers + Hall, PC, which resigned from LLEN only when the
PCAOB suspended the registration of its only two partners and barred them from auditing publicly listed companies for a min-
imum of five years.


• LLEN has only had a non-‘acting’ Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for an aggregate of four months in its history. Suspiciously,
three of its past four CFOs have resigned after the end of the company’s fiscal year but before the CFO would have had to sign
off on the company’s audited financial statements.


We therefore issue a strong sell rating on LLEN’s publicly traded securities.
