Several months ago, we shared our opinion that SODA was buying its Italian
distributor to provide a revenue and EBITDA boost through accounting
shenanigans. Simplistically, SODA previously made sales into its channel,
recognizing revenue. Then, they bought the distributor, assumed the
inventory, and could re-sell the product, effectively recognizing sales two times
on the same product. We believe this accounting treatment was the same
methodology used in the past when SODA bought its Nordic distributor. Recall,
on its Q2'13 earnings call, when management casually announced they had
bought their Italian distributor, the company guided for a minimal impact from
the transaction. To be precise, SODA guided for the transaction to add "$2
million" of sales in the second half of 2013. Also, they confessed (or blamed)
that they had assumed $10 million of Italian inventory from the distributor
they acquired. See below (emphasis added):


Q2'13 Call from 7/31/13


Jim Chartier: Good morning. The first question, how much did the acquisition
of Italy add to your outlook for 2013 revenues?


Daniel Erdreich (NASDAQ:CFO): Yeah, it won't be that significant, it will be
a couple of millions on top line and there won't be any impact on bottom line.


------


Jon R. Andersen: Can I just confirm, on the Italian - the acquisition of the
Italian distributor, your expectation is that will add about $2 million in the
second half of the year to sales, no impact on the bottom line, and kind of

$4 million on an annual run rate basis, is that the right way to think about
that?


Daniel Erdreich (CFO): That's right, Jon.


------


Scott Van Winkle: Hi, thanks, good quarter. Most of my questions have been
asked, but just a couple follow-ups. On net inventory, I think you talked about
Italy maybe selling through some inventory, having to work through is it; is
that referring to the $10 million of inventory you took on with the acquisition
or more in store?


Daniel Erdreich (CFO): No it's - the $10 million that was taken as
inventory is the increase, is the main item of increase in inventory that
we see in the account.

As we pondered after the Q2'13 call - SodaStream had already recognized
revenue on its sales into the Italian distributor, hence they could double count
the revenue based on the purchase accounting methodology. If SODA was
assuming $10 million of inventory, then presumably that was $21.7 million of
prior sales SODA had recognized into this distributor (assumingcthe corporate
gross margin of 54%). Therefore, future sales of this newly assumed inventory
would effectively create a double-counting effect on revenue.


SodaStream just reported its Q3'13 earnings and concluded its conference call.
The stock is down about 6%, but will likely be down significantly more as
investors and analyst digest the slew of issues. We do not believe the
shenanigans we identified are understood, nor even responsible for any
portion of the sell-off. Not yet at least. The stock is likely down because:


they missed the top line
missed Americas sales by a wide margin (with growth decelerating to sub-
30% after growing 88% last year and over 65% in the first half)
flavor sales collapsed to only 7% growth year-over-year, while Americas
saw flavor sales decline year-over-year
APAC declined by 21% year-over-year
DSO's jumped to 86

And inventory was up 43% year-over-year despite sales growth that slowed
to 28.5%
And for the first time in many quarters, they were unable to raise guidance


The lone bright spot appeared to be Western Europe, its largest region, which
inexplicably experienced year-over-year accelerating growth. The region grew
43% year-over-year, which was a huge jump from the 21.6% reported in the
first half. This, despite deceleration and/or declines in every other geography.
We believe that the "surprising" growth in Western Europe can be attributed to
its Italian distributor. Further, our analysis, which could of course be wrong,
leads us to believe management has completely understated the Italian
contribution. This acquisition alone appears responsible for the accelerating
growth.


On the Q3'13 quarterly call, the CFO unequivocally stated that part of the
inventory jump year-over-year was due to $6 million of remaining Italian
inventory. Based on the $10 million of initial Italian inventory disclosed on the
Q2'13 call, we can conclude that $4 million of inventory was sold in Q3'13 (10-
6=4). If we assume a gross margin inline with the corporate average, the $4
million of inventory that was sold would have resulted in $8.7 million of
revenue contribution during Q3'13. Recall, management said on its Q2'13 call
the Italian distributor sales would only contribute "$2 million" in the entire
second half. This appears to be rather inaccurate.


Turning back to the confounding acceleration in Western Europe growth, we
believe net of our calculated Italian distributor contribution, revenue growth
was inline. Western Europe delivered $75.5 million of revenue vs. $52.6 million
in Q3'12. However, if we reduce the Q3'13 revenue by our estimation of the
Italian distributor contribution of $8.7 million, then Western Europe would
have delivered growth of 27% ($66.8 million vs. $52.6 million YoY). This still
represents respectable growth, but would have turned a small overall miss in
Q3'13 into a much more problematic miss.


We continue to believe that SodaStream is playing extremely loose and fast
with its numbers and communication. We also think they will be unable to
grow significantly in 2014 without major door expansion OR by accounting
shenanigans through another distributor acquisition. Should SodaStream buy
another distributor, specifically its Japanese distributor, who as recently as last
quarter SodaStream was putting more marketing muscle behind, then we

think it will validate our concern SodaStream is "re-buying" revenue only to
"re-recognize" it all over again. While investors, and especially sell-side
analysts, will continue to hang on to the 2017 growth goals the company laid
out at its analyst days, the cracks are showing. We look forward to hearing an
explanation for the accounting inconsistencies around inventory and its Italian
distributor appearing to be a far larger contributor than management has
insinuated. However, we'll have to wait until the 20F to get an honest answer
because the company does not file quarterly reports and we definitely don't
trust the company's explanations.


Disclosure: I am short SODA.

From the conference call:


"Daniel Birnbaum - CEO 
One unusual situation is Italy. You
remember the transition into Italy. Right
now we’re selling inventory that we
acquired from the distributor and we’re not
taking full margin on that inventory. We
are only taking the portion so that we
don’t double account profit; we are only
taking the margin on that inventory which
is the distributor margin."


You conveniently left this major point out
of your "analysis".

When you dare posting that type of
comment, the least you can do is to make
sure you understand accounting.


First of all, what's wrong with selling the
inventories SODA bought back from the
Italian distributor? Nothing in my view.
SODA has bought a ready to sell inventory
which, if sold by the distributor to retailers
(assuming an ongoing relationship), would
have triggered more orders from the
Italian distributor to SODA. So the only
distortion at SODA's revenues level is the
pocketed distributor's margin . 
The trick, if there is any, is the discount at
which the inventory price was negotiated
between SODA and its former distributor.
And so far, you cannot be more precise
about what those 10 m$ are really
representing. It's a book value which
means the cash actually paid by SODA to
purchase what was left at the distributor's.
That does not mean the distributor bought
it for 21.7 m$. If no discount was
negociated between the parties, then it
was worth 4.6 m$ of SODA's stock which
were sold 10 m$ to the Italian distributor.
Full stop.

Now getting to your argument about the
window dressing with regards to the Q3
2013 European sales. Again, you are
assuming that when taking over the Italian
distributor, SODA paid for the inventory its
own sell out price. If you do have the proof
of that, I'm ready to reconsider my
position.

Hubert MATHET
I just got the company to confirm that the
10 m$ were exactly the price paid by the
distributor when he initally purchased the
inventory from Soda. So there is no
gimmick of any kind here and Mr
Copperfield, you'd better consider that
accounting is neither magic nor esoteric.
It's simple math.
