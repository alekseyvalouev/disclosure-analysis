RINO: Tax Evidence Completes the False Accounting Story
Nov. 11, 2010 8:33 AM ET108 comments
by: Alfred Little


An extremely well documented research report on RINO International Corporation
(NASDAQ: RINO) from Muddy Waters Research LLC was published yesterday. The report
outlines how their detailed research and investigation of RINO revealed fabricated
customer relationships, exaggerated sales, phony financial statements among other
misleading claims made to the investing public, including a $3.2 million Orange County
mansion RINO secretly bought for its CEO out of the proceeds of its $100 million financing
last December. A copy of the full 29-page research report can be downloaded from Muddy
Waters LLC’s website here.


My article today reveals a key piece of documented evidence Muddy Waters missed,
proving RINO is a fraud. Original copies of Value Added Taxes (VAT) filings RINO
submitted to China’s official revenue collection agency, the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT), show RINO reported revenue of only $8.9 million and paid almost no VAT
in 2009, compared to $193 million revenue and $14.3 million VAT payment RINO reported
in its SEC filings.
The Key Evidence
Each month, companies in China are required to file and pay their VAT by submitting a
standardized Tax Declaration Form to the local state tax bureaus. Accordingly, RINO files
and pays its VAT to the Jinzhou District State Tax Bureau of Dalian City, the local branch
of SAT in Dalian. I hired a Dalian attorney who spent months pressuring Dalian tax officials
to release copies of RINO’s VAT Declaration Forms. I have now finally obtained RINO’s
electronically filed monthly VAT tax declaration forms as well as a summary of its VAT
payment record for 2009. Additionally, I also obtained RINO’s tax record filed with Dalian
Jinzhou District Local Tax Bureau. Both records are stamped with the official seal of each
tax bureau and I have each record translated; they can be downloaded here.


Official VAT filing and payment records contradict SEC filings
In its SEC filings, RINO discloses five PRC entities registered in China. According to
Dalian City tax officials, only Dalian RINO Environment Engineering Science and
Technology (RINO’s VIE) reports any sales on its tax returns. The other four companies
have no record of sales or any type of tax payment at the tax bureaus. RINO disclosed its
VAT payment details in its 10-K and 10-Q footnotes as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/236264-rino-tax-evidence-completes-the-false-accounting-story 2/25


Based on the VAT information disclosed in its 2009 10-K, RINO paid over $14 million VAT
in cash in 2009 (see table above). However, as shown in the payment record from the
state tax bureau, RINO in fact did not make any VAT payments in 2009, only making a
single payment of RMB 1.2 million (about $175,000) in January, 2010. Tax bureau staff
explained to me that while RINO filed zero VAT payable throughout the year, the tax
officials disputed RINO’s tax returns and forced RINO to pay RMB 1.2 million in January.


Additionally, for the first six months of 2010, the tax bureau staff disclosed to me that
RINO reported sales of only RMB 16,906,636 or $2.5 million and a net loss of RMB
(6,213,139) or ($914,000) compared to sales of $113.2 million and net income of $39
million RINO reported to its U.S. investors in its most recent 10-Q.


Questions I would like answered:
RINO claimed it paid $14.3 million in VAT while in fact it only paid $175,000. Over $14
million of shareholder money is unaccounted for. Where did this money go?
Why did RINO’s auditor fail to catch this? Did RINO show its auditor alternate VAT tax
payment records to hide where the $14 million really went?
If RINO is evading VAT, as many small Chinese companies do, then how can investors
rely on RINO’s financials filed with the SEC when the cash RINO claimed it paid for
VAT was actually diverted somewhere other than the SAT?
The very low sales RINO reported to the SAT strongly support the facts obtained by
Muddy Waters showing that many of RINO’s FGD customer contracts are
questionable.
Why didn’t RINO’s auditor (Frazer Frost) go to the tax bureau (as I did) to verify the tax
payment records RINO management produced?

Hi,


When Muddy Waters torched ONP, they also produced official documents that proved their case.


In the end, it was Muddy Waters that was mistaken. The official documents had been obtained for a company with a
similar, but different, name.


Everything you and Muddy Waters are saying might be true. However, Muddy Water's track record would point to
otherwise. They only published one other article, and that one was indicated to be wrong by a Street.com article.
www.thestreet.com/_yah...


If I follow occam's razor, I can only conclude that Muddy wrote a very misleading report in order to short the stock and
make money for either themselves, or their clients. Consider that RINO has been on the fail-to-deliver list (naked
shorting) for the past 12 days. www.bloomberg.com/news...


It does contain some truths in it. The House loan is true (and old news), and the VAT might be true. However, most of
the report is based upon Moody's word. I wouldn't trade based upon their word. And if Muddy is wrong - as it was with
ONP - it's a shame that these guys are making money off of this strategy.

If one reads the last 10-k report in light of the supposed allegations, one comes away believing that the public
accounting audit firm must have done no audit work. In that set of financial statements, with a clean opinion,
one finds the explanation for the lower VAT, for example. Given the increased emphasis placed on
independent audit firms to conduct consideration of fraud potential in designing the audit procedures applied,
it is highly unlikely this company could have committed the gross fraud it is being accused of without some
detection by the auditors. I would have to see the evidence being brought forth by the new report from muddy
waters - an appropriate name for a firm with no professional designation to be doing the forensic audit work
necessary to convince this retired Certified Public Accountant / Certified Fraud Examiner. Come on Muddy et
al, lets see what specific details you have!!!!

He wasn't disbarred, he is delinquent with his NYS Bar membership.


Which is not a surprise, since he is China running a bunch of operations. Here is his Bio:


Currently, Carson is pioneering the introduction of self storage in Mainland China through the company owns,
Love Box Self Storage. He is also the founder and owner of ChinaPrimer.com (www.chinaprimer.com).
ChinaPrimer.com is a website that helps Western small and medium-sized enterprises save money and
minimize risks when entering China. Carson co-authored the popular Doing Business in China for Dummies
(John Wiley & Sons 2007).

Carson Cutler Block was with Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the world until 2007. Something went
wrong and he is not listed among Jones Day's 21 lawyers in their Shanghai offices. 
Why would an up and coming attorney with Jones Day suddenly depart their organization?

Apppro - The 750,000 block trade was more likely an institution that hit a stop, that's my guess. There is tons of
manipulation here, but in my opinion (and it's just a guess) that wasn't one of them.

from the comments read I have a good feel that this guy, Mr Little is a real crook - what is highly questionable is
however that he is allowed to have followers and actually are allowed to be a "contributor" on Seeking Alpha's

Al,


VAT payments are not in the public domain in China. Did you bribe a PRC tax official to release these numbers?


11 Nov 2010, 09:53 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
RINO is history now. Judging from how little VAT they paid, I'd like to add that they're probably facing severe
pernalties for illegal tax evasion. Excellent piece.


11 Nov 2010, 10:03 AM


Michael Anderson, Contributor
I do not know too much about RINO, but VAT filings are not public information. So it is highly possilbe that you have
done illegal activity by creating false documents or illegally getting the filings.


Remember when MW, CCA, and other shorts supposedly had documents with stamped proof of ONP's AIC
documents not matching the SEC documents? Well, we all obviously know that ONP's filings match and none of
these so called documents have never been presented because they were a false replication or just not true. I would
find it hard to believe that this is not the case with yours as well.


11 Nov 2010, 10:45 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
By the way, has anyone even done a simple analysis on the size of RINO's monstrous VAT balances? Even
without a comparison to the official tax filings, you can easily see those balances are not right. Dividing their
$53,066,225 VAT on sales by the 17% tax rate, you get over $312 million of implied revenue for 2009. This is
62% higher than the reported $192 million revenue! How is that possible? Clear sign of its book being
cooked.

The fact that RINO paid so little VAT to the government than the amount they told the investors means it is
probably using the non-existent VAT payments to steal money.

That's because the companies he has written on are frauds. Frauds have no place in the U.S. capital
markets. If there weren't short sellers doing real investigative work into these stocks, the market caps will only
grow bigger and bigger, and then when the day of reckoning comes, we'll be dealing with 600 chinese
smallcaps at $500m marketcaps that are hoaxes, instead of 100 at $200m market caps. The frauds needs to
end.


As an analogy, we all feel bad for Madoff's investors and I'm certain the investors were furious at the
government for shutting down Madoff before they had a chance to withdraw their funds. But it sure would
have been much better for Madoff to get shut down when he was running $1bn than when he was running
$60bn.

The frauds like this author and Muddy Waters is where the focus needs to be. If you sit here and think that
these open shorts with disclaimers as to the validity of these rumors are legit then i feel sorry for you as a
trader. You need to go back to the drawing board and learn where to draw conclusions from and where to get
your research on a business. Its not here or with Muddy Waters for sure.

Author’s reply »  I promise to find a good Chinese company you all can buy as soon as the market pulls back a bit.


The problem now is that with the market up 3 months nonstop, nearly all Chinese stocks have rallied. Good ones and
bad ones.


So right now it is easier to short the bad ones than bet the good ones will forever go higher.


But soon enough there will again be some value once the sector pulls back a bit.

No thanks!! I don't need to buy up a stock while you short me all the way down with your slander. You claim
you've been working on this for months. I find it odd that your timing is so perfect to this nobody's firm
accusations. This is a very pathetic attempt to make a buck by a few hacks while longs in this stock take a
bath. I haven't seen any publication that has came out to date that suggest any wrong doing or fraud. Do you
have a disclaimer as well as Muddy Waters, Mr Little?

Amazing!!! You are short RINO. What a surprise!! Both You and Muddy Waters have the motive to deceive

It's not odd at all. Darwin rushed to print, as did Erasmus, and the first modern geologists, Smith and Hutton,
when they realized competitors were doing similar work. Even if MWR was sloppy before, they've drawn
attention to the issue, and now commentators like Al Little and Chris Wu are taking a look for themselves and
doing their own investigative work to verify the claims. This is how the Media should work, and it's good to see
it in action.


Like another poster said, they are helping to keep fraud down by exposing it when the company is a small
cap, and not Enron-sized.


Finally, this company is down 50-60% over the past year, at the same time Chinese companies have been
appreciating substantially. That tells me other researchers - perhaps institutional investors - have come to the
same conclusion and have already gotten out or even shorted.

VAT Declaration Forms. I have now finally obtained RINO’s electronically filed monthly VAT tax declaration forms as
well as a summary of its VAT payment record for 2009."


.. hit piece from MuddyWaters was released few days ago... and just accidentally you have finally obtained document
"supporting" their claim... hmm... Moreover, you can not obtain that legally so I really wonder how you got that.


Another point, you claimed, both in BORN as well as in this piece that you "hire" people, yet, you claimed that you
were not short BORN (at least you make RINO disclosure here).


Why we should believe one anonymous poster, with China bashing history? Why suddenly hit piece when a
tremendous number is shorts are under water.. and they desperate need out?


Last note.. do you really think is is moral to load up short position & puts, release hit piece and profit regardless where
truth is??? Of course, it depends, to which extent is this factor taken into account at all.

For everyone from China, they should know any government document should have title in there official paper, they
won't create anything on a plain paper. Also, their official stamp normally would be larger and more complicated than
what shown on the PDF file. I'm highly doubtful about the authenticity of this document. It's so easy to ask somebody
to make a such stamp and seal it on your own document. JUST IMHO.

Don't know if this guy is telling the truth or not. But if I was a RINO official, I wouldn't be saying that I will comment
later about the matter. Rather I would be screaming bloody murder about the untruths being spread. The fact that
RINO doesn't want to comment now or deride the negative reports immediately, suggests to me that maybe there is
some truth to the negative reports. P.S. I have no short position or any position in RINO.

Right, the shorts were lying, which is why RINO was delisted and got smacked all the way down to the Pinks -
for not answering NASDAQ inquiries.

I am a simple investor that feels burned by Rino, though I take some blame for not drilling deeper in due diligence.


They claim to be a 200 million dollar a year company, but only have a couple of contact names on their website.


On Rino's own information there, they claim that their 200 million dollars a year company "did not know" cutting a
cheque for 3.5 million to the CEO for an undocumented "loan" was a chargeable offence.  
Notice there financial statements are always unaudited, as they will be again when released Monday at the company
webinar. 
Yeah right, the 200M company that can't ever spring for an auditor. 
If it looks like shit, smells like shit, then it's probably shit.

Here's a nice excerpt from their terms of service agreement,


"Muddy Waters, LLC has obtained all information contained herein and in reports from sources we believe to be
accurate and reliable. However, such information is presented “as is,” without warranty of any kind – whether express

Sounds like they're really trying to cover themselves from legal backlash. I think if all else fails they could be subject to
the manipulation of trade prices and volume. I've emailed the company to see if I can get a phone number or physical

Addendum to my earlier comment: If RINO believes it is totally honest and without fault, why wait until Monday to say
so. If the company is so concerned about shareholder relations, all they needed to do this morning is issue this

The issue is not Muddy Waters, the issue is checking what they claim. When the response comes on Monday along
with "unaudited"financial reports and no allowance for shareholders to ask questions, the stock will plummet again.

Author’s reply »  Weekend read:


Refco, Inc. entered crisis on Monday, October 10, 2005, when it announced that its chief executive officer and
chairman, Phillip R. Bennett had hidden $430 million in bad debts from the company's auditors and investors, and had
agreed to take a leave of absence. 
Refco said that through an internal review over the preceding weekend it discovered a receivable owed to the
company by an unnamed entity that turned out to be controlled by Mr. Bennett, in the amount of approximately
US$430 million. Apparently, Bennett had been buying bad debts from Refco in order to prevent the company from
needing to write them off, and was paying for the bad loans with money borrowed by Refco itself. Between 2002 and
2005,[1] he arranged at the end of every quarter for a Refco subsidiary to lend money to a hedge fund called Liberty
Corner Capital Strategy, which then lent the money to Refco Group Holdings. Bennett's company then paid the
money back to Refco, leaving Liberty as the apparent borrower when financial statements were prepared. It is not yet
clear if Liberty knew it was hiding scam transactions; management of the fund has claimed that they believed it was
borrowing from one Refco subsidiary and lending to another Refco sub, and not lending to an entity that Mr. Bennett
secretly controlled. On October 20, they announced plans to sue Refco. 
In April 2006, papers filed by creditors of Refco seemed to show that Bennett had run a similar scam going back at
least to 2000, using Bawag P.S.K. Group in the place of Liberty Corner Capital Strategy.[1] 
The law requires that such financial connections between corporation and its own top officers be shown as what is
known as a related party transaction in various financial statements. As a result, Refco said, "its financial statements,
as of, and for the periods ended, Feb. 28, 2002, Feb. 28, 2003, Feb. 28, 2004, Feb. 28, 2005, and May 31, 2005,

taken as a whole, for each of Refco Inc., Refco Group Ltd. LLC and Refco Finance Inc. should no longer be relied
upon." 
This announcement triggered a number of investigations, and on October 12 Bennett was arrested and charged with
one count of securities fraud for using U.S. mail, interstate commerce, and securities exchanges to lie to investors.
His lawyer said that Bennett planned to fight the charges. On October 19, trading of Refco's shares was halted on the
New York Stock Exchange, which later delisted the company. Before the halt, Refco shares were trading for more
than $28 per share, and as of October 19, they had dropped (on the pink sheets) to $0.80 per share.

People could have gotten out of Refco on that first day with a limited 45% loss instead of a 99% loss one
week later.


October 10, 2005


One of the world's biggest commodities brokerages said its chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, took an
indefinite leave of absence after the firm discovered an investment firm he controlled had owed the company
$430 million.


Refco Inc. said as a result its financial statements since 2002 "should no longer be relied upon" and that it
would delay filing its quarterly earnings release originally slated for next week. Refco said Mr. Bennett repaid
the $430 million. The company said it reported the matter to the authorities, which couldn't be reached on the
Columbus Day holiday.


The disclosure came two months after Refco launched an initial public offering of stock that raised $583
million and may raise questions about the company's financial disclosure ahead of that offering and could
raise liability issues if investors were to pursue action against it. Mr. Bennett held around 34% of the company
before the IPO and remains one of its biggest shareholders.


Shares of Refco yesterday plunged 45%, or $12.96, to $15.60 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, well below the IPO price of $22.

Let's be very clear:


RINO CEO essentially misappropriated the $3.2m from the shareholders to buy the house for himself


Why?


Because it's a direct purchase of the house concealed as a loan. Check out the record from Orange County Recorder
Office, the house is put under RINO INTERNATIONAL CORP.


Don't believe me? Go to cr.ocgov.com/grantorgr...... (enter “Rino” into the search box)


So it was a direct purchase by RINO from the beginning. Not only they LIED about this "loan" in their 10-K, and they
bought this right after they raised $100 million. This was sick. Sadly, people whose money was being stolen don't
even realize it in front of the solid evidence.


By the way, does this look like an office to be used for corporate purpose?

At 1st glance, ocgov.com seems suspicious, but oc.gov.ca seems to alias to it. The link given for online

What do the results of searching there demonstrate? Dejun Zou is shown as a grantee on 3-22-2010 and a

RINO brought the home under the Corporate Name. You can find this for yourself by going to the OC records
as Mr. Wu posted above. The CEO is only the reference name. The deed is not in his name, it is in RINO's.


Later, AFTER concerns were raised, there was some more deed shuffling. I can't tell how the loan was paid
back. Did Dejun get a 'cash loan' from RINO to take over the house from RINO? I don't know for sure - and
neither do you.


14 Nov 2010, 03:42 PM

I guess i will post yet another link on this site that outlines that loan. It was payed back in two installments with
interest of around 77,000 to RINO's favor. The loanee has since then made two loans to RINO at 0% interest
to the tune of just under $1 million. I did some research. I suggest you do the same amount.

OK, let's talk a bit about the CFO change.


In 2009 RINO signed a new CFO: 
" Jenny Liu. Pursuant to an employment agreement dated June 30, 2009, Jenny Liu is employed by RINO
International Corporation as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer for a term of 3 years at a monthly salary of
$10,000. In addition, Ms. Liu was granted 50,000 options to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $6.15 per
share, vesting in 3 equal annual installments beginning on June 30, 2010. The options will be issued as soon as
practical after July 1 , 2010."


In april 2010:  
" Effective on April 27, 2010, the Chief Financial Officer of Rino International Corporation. (the “Company”), Yi (Jenny)
Liu, resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. "


On 2010-03-31 the 10-K was posted. 
Signature CFO Jenny Liu.


On 2010-09-14 an amended 10-K/A was posted.  
What was changed? Not much. Signature CFO now Ben Wang.


So that makes a few very interesting question:  
1) Why was CFO Jenny Liu in such a rush to leave? Why couldn't she wait two months before the first installment of
the stocks would vest? 
2) Why was the 10-K amended and was Jennys name removed? Was that part of the agreement she made with
RINO?

one legitimate document that can be confirmed by a reliable source that proves any fraud by RINO. I can
however draw the conclusion by looking at the past history of MW and make a determination that they are
deliberately defrauding investors and their imaginary "secret" clients. So far this is only Rumor. In this case its

RINO International Corp. (RINO : NASDAQ): Fraud allegations difficult to clear; rating to SELL, placing target
price Under Review 
Michael Deng, 1.416.869.7285


Investment recommendation  
We are moving our recommendation on RINO to SELL from Hold and placing our target price Under Review,
after reviewing the Muddy Waters report and information available to us. We believe these allegations are
difficult to dismiss, and RINO's real business could indeed be significantly smaller than its reported financial
statements suggest. Therefore, given the significant potential downside, we recommend investors SELL the
stock.


Investment highlights


The Muddy Waters report claims that they contacted nine FGD customers disclosed by RINO, and six of them
denied hiring RINO. Our findings from checking with one of these steel companies, Yueyufeng, also
contradict management's explanation. Therefore, we have serious doubts about the existence of some of the
customer relationships claimed by RINO.


The value added tax (VAT) records revealed on the internet and the SAIC numbers shown in Muddy Waters
report could reflect the real revenue level of the company.

needing to cover positions?


This is a sobering lesson for any of us willing to invest in small Chinese companies. I'm now wondering just how much

Interesting article in response to what Alfred has been doing.. comparing SAIC to SEC. www.prnewswire.com/new...


The article points out directly what Alfred has been doing and it states to be wary of him and the rest who are short
these stocks.


"As long as a holding company structure is involved, the SAIC and SEC numbers cannot possibly match except under
an extreme circumstance in which a public company has only one wholly owned operating subsidiary and there are
no inter-company transactions of any sort, including expenses, different revenue recognitions under Chinese and U.S.
GAAP accounting etc. at the parent company level. Presently, no such China based company exists on any U.S.
stock exchange.


Any concern over SAIC filings is just one example of the many areas that investors are just beginning to learn about
Chinese business practices. Be wary of less professional advice from amateur or anonymous sources that often have
untold self-interest behind some seemingly legitimate arguments. There are often stock short sellers behind many
"sudden discoveries of fraud" at a legitimate publicly traded China based company. Avoiding fraud involves much
more than comparing apples to oranges. Understanding China, learning to speak the Chinese language, gaining
better understanding of China's complex cultural and business aspects are among the right steps one should take. "

Following both MW's reports on ONP and this. It seems that ONP had a totally different response to MW's report than
RINO. Even so, it takes more than three months for ONP to get close to completing its internal review, and the report
is not out yet.


If one looks at the RINO 10Q for Q3,2010, under Plant and Equipment, it does not show a balance that would indicate
the $102MM project was progressing that much.


The AR line and some other lines on Assets side also had unusally substantial increases. MW was right about RINO
burning through its cash if you look at the RINO's statement of cash flows. How much longer can RINO hold with this
cash depletion rate?


Also if one digs deeper into the old filings on change of accountants, there was one accountant that raised question
about RINO as a going concern a few years (2005/2006) back before they parted way with RINO.


MW might have some solid info on RINO this time around.

was halted.


As Barron's warned you, Beware this Chinese Export! More will fall before there is true value in China.

If there was no fraud, it shouldn't be difficult to refute MWs allegations.


It would have sufficed to ask a number of the customers in the MW report to confirm that they had ordered
products in the past. Looks simple to me.

Hey Alfred you old sleezeball: Guess what. Barron's (another author) is trying to get Barron's out of a jam.
Barron's got hoodwinked by the likes of people like you (my guess) and issued that article about Chinese
reverse mergers. Then, immediately after that article: many, many "very, very questionable" articles (like
yours) came out of no where and slamed many Chinese small cap reverse mergers. Guess what, Muddy
Waters is being "researched" by the SEC (are you affiliated with them?). Now another author in Barrons is
reporting that the customers have in fact been contacted and they are in fact customers. Additionally, RINO
stopped the stock from being traded so that they can defend themselves. I, myself, got an email and a phone
call asking if I had more information about Muddy Waters that was not already on the internet. I would
suggest you find a rock to hide under.

I suggest that you read the 8-K issued by the Nasdaq today.


Apparently the CEO admitted that some of the customers never ordered any products.

The power of cognitive dissonance is hard to break.


"RINO got the stock halted." All evidence points that the NASDAQ took action, not RINO. The halt was just
changed from T1 to T12.

The game is over for RINO and its shareholders. The CEO admitted the books are cooked. He and the CFO
will be forced to resign, the subsequent investigation will wipe out everything the claimed they ever earned.
The shareholder suit might at best hope to recover a couple dollars per share if the CEO doesn't run off with
it.


RINO will only reopen on the pink sheets and trade at a discount to net recoverable cash per share.


Great job Muddy Waters and IFRA Group who provided much of the evidence that went into the report.


The tax returns filed with the SAT, once again, are proven to be the most reliable indicator of the true sales
and earnings of chinese U.S. listed companies.


By my estimate there are another dozen or so big name Chinese scam companies to be exposed. Dozens of
smaller ones not worth pursuing. Sometime in 2011 all the garbage will finally be flushed down the toilet and
the remaining companies will deserve a premium valuation.


I am still a huge believer in the long term prospects of many Chinese companies. I will continue to do my part
to sort the wheat from the chaff.

Congrats on being correct as usual. I enjoy reading your articles.

alred: guess what. the story is not over. MW is being investigated by the SEC for many false claims that they
have made, the manner in which they made them, and the fact that they were manipulating the market in
many different stocks. I would not be surprised if you and ifra are also being investigated. We shall see what
happens to RINO. You may be correct; however, I think your friends' might be a little nervous about their short
positions considering the levels. Gloat all you want. You are still a bunch of manipulating, criminal, financial
terrorists.

By the way Alfred--Tell your buddies that naked short selling is a criminal activity (however, they already know
that--which makes them even more criminally minded.).

Oh, by the way, Alfred: I stand to lose about 3300 dollars on this. Which is probably about the equivalent of
you losing about 5 Million dollars or more (if I had the same assets as you). I hope you are very proud of
yourself you santimonious, filthy rich, right wing nut. I hope your stack of money causes serious problems in
your life.

Mattm, what are you doing putting such a large proportion of your wealth in one company to begin with,
particularly a small cap foreign stock?


Al Little is doing a great service by warning about numbers that just don't add up. You should be thanking him,
and using the lesson learned to exercise due caution with any other Chinese small caps you may have.


I recommend Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor" as a place to start.


IMHO, Financial Terrorists are the ones who push these kinds of small cap foreign stocks to retail investors.


You should be directing your anger at those who claimed to "Know" that RINO's numbers were A-Okay.

Well, at this point it looks like Muddy Waters was right, and you as well Alfred. Good job.

Oh, by the way, Barrons is a criminal enterprise also.


20 Nov 2010, 08:20 PM


ursamajor5813
Yes, a venerable old institution like Barron's is a criminal enterprise, but a foreign small cap company with
little track record, audited by a little Arkansas-based accounting firm, that did a reverse merger into a US
Shell company to get listed on the NASDAQ in a convoluted way, is above suspicion.

I think some people here owe Alfred an apology for the personal attacks, looks like he was right.


Mattm, you lose.

I am thinking about picking up and relocating to the PRC and creating a shell here in the U.S. which owns my
(invisible)subsidiary in china and reporting absurdly high EPS/revenues to the SEC(no actual revenue in china
though). I may even dilute/raise cash through a PIPE offering with Roth's assistance for my mansion in China as well.
When the gig is up...ohhh well...I am in China so the cash is mine, all mine.

Do think that any lawyer will ever collect from a Chinese company, especially if it is a fraud?

It's amazing to me how many fools there are who demonize anyone who attacks their beloved company which they
think they know so much about. They'll immediately believe anything that comes down with a company logo stamped
on it, but anyone else who dares question these shady foreign businesses is evil, corrupt, etc. It's downright
dangerous for other ignorant investors who read claptrap such as this and come to the conclusion that the messenger
is the problem and the company is a screaming bargain at "artificially depressed prices." Question for you idiots who
were loading up on this name in November: How's that trade working out for you?!

See Business Week, Jan 17 2010 PP 58-63, "You Will Regret this Investment." Muddy Waters,
ChineseCompanyAnalyst.... John Bird aka waldomushman, and many others who short Chinese Cos and accuse
quite a few of them of fraud, would appear to be right on the money.
