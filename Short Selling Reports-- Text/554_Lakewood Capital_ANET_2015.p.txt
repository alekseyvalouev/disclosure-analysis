The Breakers Palm Beach resort in Palm Beach, Fla., is shown in this aerial view.


Six hedge fund managers gave their best investment ideas at an
exclusive—and private—conference, including new bets against
companies.


The investors were part of a session to present one long and one short
idea each at Morgan Stanley's "Breakers" conference, put on annually
by the bank's hedge-fund-servicing unit at the posh Breakers Hotel in
Palm Beach, Florida.

The event Wednesday was private and closed to the media, but a
person in attendance shared the recommendations with CNBC.com,
along with a summary of the rationales. The picks were:


Aaron Cowen of Suvretta Capital Management: Long pick: Adobe
Systems. The company's new subscription-pricing model should work
and will help improve profitability, but that isn't being priced in to
analyst estimates. Short pick: Target. Extra consumer cash from low oil
prices will boost sales, but it will help low-cost retailers like Family
Dollar Stores more. Margins are high compared to Wal-Mart Stores and

there's no growth in the number of stores. Target price for the stock is
in the high $50s or low $60s.


Daniel Lewis of Orange Capital: Long pick: Amaya Gaming. Amaya's
purchase of PokerStars gives it leading market share. It also has low
taxes from its base on Isle of Man. New PokerStars management is
good and the stock is worth more than $50 a share. Short pick: MGM
China. Trends in Las Vegas have been good, making it relatively cheap
compared to Chinese gambling hub Macau (as a pair trade, Lewis also
likes regular MGM stock long).


Kurt Billick of Bocage Capital: Long pick: Lundin Mining. The copper,
zinc and nickel miner is poised to benefit from recent investments in its
business. Short pick: natural gas. It's still overvalued at $3 per million
British thermal unit given there's not enough storage in the U.S. Prices
will fall below $2 per million Btu.


Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital: Long pick: 21Vianet. The company
is growing well and is trading at a discount to Equinix but with a much
higher growth rate. Short pick: Youku Tudou. Competitors are being run
as loss leaders to attract new users, making it difficult for Youku, the
YouTube of China, to compete and be profitable. The bull case is it will
be bought out by Alibaba, but it won't because it would have to
consolidate the losses.


Anthony Bozza of Lakewood Capital Management: Long pick:
American Capital. The business development corporation trades below
net asset value. It has a corporate restructuring later this year and will
split into multiple businesses. There's a more than 40 percent to 50
percent upside. Short pick: Arista Networks. The company faces steep
competition from Cisco and others, which is destroying margins.


John Pinkel of Indus Capital Partners: Long pick: PICC Property &
Casualty. Premiums should rise in China, up 15 percent a year for the
next 10 years. Short pick: Belle International. Margins of 20 percent on
footwear are too high, and there's lots of competition from Alibaba's
Tmall and other e-commerce companies.

A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A spokesman
for Orange Capital confirmed the summary of Lewis' picks but declined
further comment. Spokesmen for Lakewood, Light Street, Bocage and
Suvretta declined to comment. Indus did not respond to multiple
requests. Reps for the companies shorted did not respond to requests
for comment, except for Target, which declined.  


The Breakers conference is one of the most prominent annual
gatherings in the hedge fund industry, offering Morgan Stanley's hedge
funds clients a chance to show their smarts to potential investors also in
attendance.


Well-known money managers who attended this year, according to the
person inside, included Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management,
Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor
Investment, Dan Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management, Andreas
Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and James Dinan of York Capital
Management.


The investor Barton Biggs described the Breakers event as "fabled" in a
2006 memoir, Hedgehoggng.


"This conference is widely considered the prime event at which to raise
money because it attracts the biggest, richest collection of hedge fund
buyers in the world," wrote Biggs, who died in 2012.
