Puda Coal Chairman Ming Zhao: Time To Expropriate The Expropriator
Sep. 9, 2011 11:09 AM ET22 comments
by: Alfred Little


On April 8th, 2011 Alfredlittle.com published a report alleging PUDA Chairman Ming Zhao
secretly sold half the company and then pledged the other half to Chinese PE investors.
The NYSE AMEX halted trading of PUDA within hours of the publication of our report.
PUDA’s Audit Committee commenced an immediate investigation into our allegations and
on August 30th, 2011 presented its interim findings to PUDA’s Board of Directors (the 8-K
can be found here).


Despite “the lack of cooperation by key individuals”, the Audit Committee verified
substantially all of the allegations of our original report (available here). Incredibly, and
overlooked by the media losing interest in Chinese stock fraud, PUDA’s Audit Committee
in section 6(b) of their report announced a major new finding: On or about April 26th, 2011
(following our April 8th report first exposing Ming Zhao's acts) without U.S. shareholder
notification or approval the ownership of 99% of Puda Mining was transferred from Putai
to Ming Zhao, once again leaving U.S. shareholders with no ownership or control of
PUDA’s key operating subsidiary Shanxi Coal.


This expropriation of PUDA’s key operating entity persisted until August 3, 2011 at which
point ownership of Puda Mining had been returned to Putai according to documentation
provided by Ming Zhao, through counsel. The Audit Committee did not state in the 8-K
who executed this latest ownership transfer (presumably Ming Zhao) nor why this transfer
was not disclosed sooner to shareholders. PUDA investors continue to wait to see if
Chairman Ming Zhao will ever actually buy-out their shares rather than simply
expropriating ownership of the company’s assets.


Meanwhile, then PUDA reported that the SEC made a decision to serve Ming Zhao with a
Wells Notice of their intent to serve him in Federal Court with a civil action charging him
with violating Federal securities laws (link here). Is the expropriator about to be
expropriated?


The story of PUDA should be a lesson to all investors who believe a buyout proposal
negates past sins. Ming Zhao now appears unlikely to escape a reckoning day. Investors
in Harbin Electric (NASDAQ: HRBN), another highly contentious buyout play, should take
note.


Disclosure: I am short HRBN.

WSJ article today on SEC going after D&T over Longtop. 
online.wsj.com/article... 
Here's an interesting quote:


"Deloitte could potentially face penalties from either side. Mr. Gillis, of Peking University, said the U.S. could revoke
Deloitte China's PCAOB registration so that it could no longer audit Chinese firms listed in the U.S."


This got me thinking about HRBN. Speaking from complete ignorance here but If the SEC and NASDAQ are not
ready to act, perhaps the PCAOB might be? Have you presented your findings to them? Frazer is the linchpin (or one
of many) to this whole scheme.

AL, can you show your real ID, name , adress, etc? You are making so many allegations but you id is like non-
existent. How can people trust what you said? 
DEER is suing you. Why don't you dare to show up?

Hysterical that someone questions the "real ID" of someone else whilst hiding behind an anonymous screen
name.

Bragging about a $0.04 increase from the close of yesterday? Currently $19.62 from closing at $19.58.

Guest closed at 22 cents higher than 19.58, but lol your so stuck in the 10 minutes of emotion you probably
forgot about that . Must be hurting even worse now, 2 weeks of straight losses for the Citron suckers camp

Guest187
@Mellon: In case you misread, my comment was at 2:01 p.m. Eastern time. So not sure where you're getting
the "10 minutes of emotion". Huh?? Clarify if you are able. - Methinks thou dost be attempting to gloat while
lamely attempting to rub my nose in what you mistakenly perceive as my misfortune. How humane of you;
good to see there is still some semblance of compassion and humanity in this civilized world. Does my heart
good to know there are wonderful people like you in the world who do not revel in another's misery. But, I
digress. Alas, I have no position on the questionable P.O.S. that is HRBN. Sorry I am not able to fulfill your
'pure-hearted' desire to know I am suffering financially from the current pricing in HRBN's stock. LOL (don't
you find it annoying when people use silly acronyms like that? Seems childish) 
However, good for you if you are making a profit from it.

@john: I think you meant to state the kettle calling the pot calling another kettle black. That is, if you're trying
to make a lame-brained attempt at witicism about my pointing out the irony of an anonymous person
questioning a third person's identity. Though, now we have gotten quite off the original topic of the article, my
good sir. However, that you found it news-worthy puts a wee grin on my face. Cheers, mate!

Frazer Frost is overdue for a PCAOB inspection which is required every three years. Frazer Frost has never been
inspected; it's predecessor, Moore Stephens Wurth Frazer and Torbet, was inspected in early 2008. 
pcaobus.org/Inspection... 
Interestingly, the letter reproduced here is signed by Dean Yamagata who just happens to be the lead on the HRBN
audit according to your report. Yamagata was named in the Cease and Desist Order from the SEC. Yamagata is
"denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant" for at least two years. 
www.sec.gov/litigation...

INSPECTIONS Sarbanes-Oxley Section 104 requires the PCAOB to inspect all registered public accounting firms. If a
registered firm provides more than 100 audit reports, the PCAOB must inspect it at least annually. All other registered
public accounting firms are subject to investigations every three years. Both U.S. and non-U.S. registered public
accounting firms must adhere to the board's and SEC's rules.

Frazer Frost was formed on January 1, 2010 through a merger of California based Moore Stephens Wirth Frazer and
Tolbert (MSWFT) with Frost PLLC of Arkansas. Frazer Frost is a member firm of Moore Stephens, the 12th largest
global accounting network. The merger was done on a trial basis, and on November 17th, 2010 it was reported that
Frost PLLC had called off the merger, the timing curiously close to the RINO announcements. How they will unwind
the firm is unclear.


Led by Frazier Frost, Moore Stephens had climbed to fifth place among auditors of Chinese companies listed in the
U.S., just behind the Big Four. Frazer Frost audited 15 Chinese companies, 1 on the NYSE, 12 on NASDAQ and 2
OTCBB, earning fees of $6.1 million. 
... 
Frazer Frost does not have an office in China, and has no staff permanently based in China, although Woo informed
me that they have staff working in China all year around. All of the staff are assigned from the California office, all are
Chinese, speak, read and write Chinese, and have been educated in the US.


A 2007 PCAOB inspection of MSWFT found no issues, nor is there any indication of issues in similar 2007 inspection
of Frost. Both firms were due for an inspection in 2010, which presumably would be of Frazer Frost.

Interesting that AL is not ducking for cover now that DEER is suing him, her or it, what ever AL really is?


I am far more more suspicious of AL and his short buddies (who are all hiding in the shadows) , than I am of public
Chinese firms.

I think it should also be well established who the geniuses were on short on HRBN. Just so they can proudly
stand behind their beliefs. Even Motley Fools avoids the list now that says something, who's the bigger fool
now? 
I present to you the 2011 HRBN public shorts who have tried so hard and failed so hard, try not to laugh to
hard:

Absolutely agree. 
Someone who just act on opportunities to drive the stock down and without showing any identity. Just like a
coward. Just like ghost. 
I am not a big promoter of chinese RTOs, but when they are abused buy the market to such a rediculous
point, they are undervalued.

This is, of course, the problem with trying to invest in China. The lawas are enforced inconsistently, the accounting
suspect. I have experience a few of these and read about others. I just don't invest in China because it is too
fraudulent.
