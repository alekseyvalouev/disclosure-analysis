Ampio Pharmaceuticals: 50 Shades Of Grey - Secondary On The Way
Jun. 6, 2013 4:53 PM ET51 comments
by: Greenwich Research Group


We've investigated Ampio Pharmaceuticals (NYSEMKT:AMPE) and found many items that
we find questionable. There is the all-too-similar comparison to Isolagen (ILE: delisted), a
company originally run by Michael Macaluso (now Chairman of Ampio) in the early 2000s
which was sued for deception and fraud (after he left the company), and went bankrupt.
There are the many questions regarding the current drugs being tested and the clinical
trials. There is the Luoxis spinoff, where the financial transactions appear to be less then
shareholder friendly. Finally there is the current stock price set-up which looks very familiar
to the set-ups in Ampio's history right before it issues a secondary offering. In this article
we raise many questions, and in our opinion, they give the appearance of a company that,
in our opinion, is not being run in the best interests of its stockholders.


In December 2012, a series of articles published on Seeking Alpha showed the similarities
between Ampio and Isolagen. Here is an excerpt from the first article:

Isolagen was a hot stock in the early 2000s. To its customers, it offered a miraculous
anti-aging process that was all but certain to be approved by the FDA. To its
investors, it offered the promise of exponential returns as it captured the aging baby-
boomer market. The stock traded as high as $8, as management touted how it's
"Isolagen Process" was successfully marketed and used in the U.K., and how FDA
approval was imminent in the U.S. It issued numerous press releases to this effect.
For example, the March 3, 2004 publication states:


The Company anticipates that the Isolagen Process could be commercially available
in the United States as early as 2005.


The February 25, 2005 press release states:


Since its launch in the U.K. in 2001, Isolagen has received resounding endorsement
from surgeons, patients and medical bodies and demand is growing at an increasing
rate.


In the meantime, insiders knew the truth was quite different - that the treatment was
not working well for younger people, and did not work at all for people over age 45
(how many baby-boomers do you know younger than 45?). Furthermore, there were
flaws in the treatment regimens so that even if treatments were successful, the FDA
would not accept the results of the trials. There was no chance for FDA approval,
and Isolagen's doctors repeatedly told them this. In the meantime, insiders sold large
portions of their stock as part of a secondary offering as Isolagen continued to pump
out press releases of the treatment's success, and imminent FDA approval.


But the trials couldn't go on forever and the truth came out - the treatments did not
work. The stock plunged down to the pennies and was finally delisted. The CEO and
other Isolagen insiders were sued for deception, fraud and many other acts of
wrongful and illegal conduct. The case summary from the plaintiffs' attorneys states:


Defendants' scheme to mislead the investing public concerning Isolagen's chances
of obtaining FDA approval of the Isolagen Process and to mass produce its sole
product inflated the price of the Company's securities and allowed Isolagen to sell
millions of dollars of new securities to investors - even while the Company's
executives were dumping their own Isolagen stock at artificially inflated prices.


Well a number of those same executives were the original founders of Ampio
Pharmaceuticals.

Ampio Pharmaceuticals has turned a micro cap stock investment into a company
with a $250 million market cap. Management was savvy enough, before this idea got
off the ground, to issue themselves 7.35 million shares of stock for a penny a share
in April of 2009 (Macaluso owns roughly 2 million shares, he used to own a lot
more). Of course Ampio had no assets so it needed some cash. So the insiders
brought in friends and relatives, and issued another 15 million shares at $1.75 per
share plus warrants. At the time of this actual raise the stock dropped from $9 to $2.


Turning to the present, Ampio just announced the formation of Luoxis along with a private
placement offering. From its recent 10-Q:


Note 2 - Formation of Subsidiary


On January 24, 2013, Ampio formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Luoxis to focus on
the development and commercialization of diagnostics utilizing Ampio's Oxidation
Reduction Potential (ORP) technology platform and all related patents. The lead
asset utilizes the ORP technology to indicate disease severity and progression
across a wide range of critical and chronic illnesses.


Luoxis has been initially funded through a private placement launched on February
15, 2013. On March 15, 2013, an initial closing was completed. A total of 3,465,000
shares were issued at $1.00 per share resulting in $3,465,000 of gross proceeds.
Net proceeds were $2,934,040 after placement agent and legal fees. The placement
agent will also receive 346,500 warrants to purchase

Table of Contents


Luoxis common stock valued at $226,298 in connection with the closing, which
amount has been included in total offering costs in the consolidated statement of
changes in stockholders' equity (deficit). The warrants have a term of 5 years and an
exercise price of $1.00. The warrants are issuable at the final closing and
exercisable one year thereafter. Concurrent with this closing, $330,000 was paid to
Trauma Research LLC and 50,000 shares of Luoxis common stock valued at
$50,000 was issued to Institute for Molecular Medicine, Inc., both related parties, for
assignment of all diagnostic patents previously licensed by Ampio. The patents will
be amortized over an overall estimated life of 15 years.


As a result of the initial private placement closing, on March 31, 2013, Ampio owned
85.02% of Luoxis. The consolidated financial statements include Luoxis since Ampio
has a controlling financial interest, however, the third-party holdings (14.98%) are
referred to as "non-controlling interests"


So, Ampio forms this subsidiary and funds it with $3.465 million taken from investors,
giving them 15% of the company. This values the company at $23.1 million. The
underwriters take $531,000 of the raise or 15.3% !! Then the first thing they do is pay
$330,000 to Trauma Research LLC. Trauma Research is run by David Bar-Or, M.D. Bar-
Or is the Chief Scientific Officer of Ampio and does most all of the research for Ampio.


From the 2012 annual report

Through a sponsored research agreement, our discovery activities are conducted by
Trauma Research LLC, or TRLLC, a limited liability company owned by Dr. David
Bar-Or. Under the research agreement, TRLLC conducts drug and biomarker
discovery and development programs at its research facilities, and we provide
funding and some scientific personnel. Intellectual property from discovery programs
conducted by TRLLC on our behalf belongs to us, and we are solely responsible for
protecting that intellectual property. While we have the right to generally request
development work under the research agreement, TRLLC directs such work and is
responsible for how the work is performed.


For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $7.5 million,
$6.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of research and development expenses.
Research and development expenses represented 63.1 %, 59.6% and 29.4% of
total operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.


But Dr. Bar-Or is also paid well by Ampio. The 10-K also states that he made $812,645 in
2012 in compensation from Ampio. We wonder how much he made from TRLLC in
addition.


Not only does Dr. Bar-Or run Trauma Research, his son, Raphi Bar-Or, is one of only a
handful of its employees - he works there as the Computational Biologist. Note that Raphi
is also a non-executive officer of Ampio. The 2012 10-K states that Raphi owns 945,283
shares of Ampio.


When Luoxis was formed, another 50,000 shares of stock was granted to the Institute for
Molecular Medicine . This is a nonprofit run by Dr. David Bar-Or.


To get a better feel for the current state of Ampio's clinical studies and outlook, our group
engaged the assistance of a hedge fund manager who specializes in Pharma stocks to
review them. Here are his comments:


Zertane: A phase 3 clinical study of application of Tramadol to treat PE was published on-
line. Data did show that the drug was effective, prolonging Intravaginal Ejaculation
Latency Time (IELT) by ~40 seconds, compared to placebo, when dosed at 62 mg (p =
0.04) or 89 mg (p = 0.03). DMI licensed Zertane to Biovail in 2007. Biovail began two 1050
patient studies (one each in Eastern and Western Europe) in 2008. Both studies were

discontinued in 2009. In a 10-K filing, VRX reports that the studies were discontinued due
to difficulties in enrollment and lack of commercial interest. They specifically stated in their
Q3 2010 Conf call


Based on a reassessment of the commercial opportunity for the product, and taking
into consideration the slower than expected enrollment rate in the Phase 3 trials, a
decision was made to terminate its development. A charge of $2.8 million was
accrued in the second quarter for the expected wind-down cost of the two European
studies that were underway


AMPE's plans for Zertane seem a bit slippery. In a June 21 2012 press release, Ampio
announced that it had had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA on June 15, and that


The FDA provided all the necessary guidance on the design and conduct of two
concurrent phase III pivotal clinical trials of approximately 15 weeks duration.
Successful completion of these trials, powered adequately (based on the phase 3
European trials), will allow for FDA clearance to market Zertane™ as a treatment for
life-long premature ejaculation (NYSE:PE)


On September 19, AMPE issued a press release stating


that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Ethypharm Ltd for the
manufacturing of Zertane™, Ampio's drug for the treatment of premature ejaculation


In a November 14 2012 Press release, AMPE stated


Ampio is poised to file an IND for pivotal trials under the 505(b)2 pathway in the USA
adhering to the guidance provided by the FDA during our Pre-IND meeting


and in its November 2012 Investor update AMPE proudly declared that


two concurrent Phase III pivotal trials set to begin enrollment in 1Q13


In the recent June 3 press release, there was no mention of any clinical studies for
Zertane beginning, as the company had touted, and the company stated "Ampio is in late-
stage negotiations to license Zertane, for treatment of premature ejaculation, and Zertane-
ED, for treatment of concomitant premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction". So a full
year after a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, AMPE has not even begun the phase 3

studies planned, and are trying to partner the drug. I'm pretty sure no partnership will ever
materialize, and Zertane will be brushed aside as AMPE management realizes it's as
worthless a "drug" as I think it is. It's worth noting that in its Q2 2011 10-Q, AMPE stated


management has been contacted by numerous potential marketing partners
concerning Zertane


Two years and we've gone from contacted by numerous potential partners to "in late-stage
negotiations"? That doesn't sound too promising.


Aside from the clear problem that low enrollment often does not bode well for market
potential, the study cited above included pooled data from 677 patients (418 from Western
Europe study and 186 from Eastern Europe study) even if Zertane were approved to treat
PE, how it would possibly result in any sales, given that MDs could just as easily use
currently available generic Tramadol (the differences between doses used in phase 3 and
the 50 mg commercial pills is less that the variation in weight of males. Ampio's IP (they
did file a patent in 2005) will likely work as well as SOMX' Doxepin patent. SOMX's
attempt to patent Doxepin did not work. This Seeking Alpha post from June 24, 2010
explains that in attempting to patent Doxepin, SOMX was


a company that takes an old, off-patent drug, packages the drug in a new dose, and
then tries to convince the world that it has on its hands a new drug for a new
indication…


Can you see the analogy to what Ampio is trying to do with Zertane?


Our biotechnology fund manager continues:


Optina: Repurposed Donazal (available as a generic in 50, 100, and 200 mg capsules) for
treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). A phase 2 study was being carried out at St.
Michael's hospital in Toronto. According to AMPE's investor presentation from June 2011,
this was to be a 60 patient placebo controlled study looking at two oral doses of Optina.
On March 3 2012, Ampio issued a press release from this study, stating

A preliminary assessment, of the primary end point (OCT) indicates a beneficial and
consistent effect with the ultra-low dose of Optina™ at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment
and no apparent benefit at the high dose. These preliminary results are in keeping
with the in-vitro data, which demonstrated a biphasic effect of the drug (effective in
reducing vascular permeability at very low doses and cessation of these beneficial
effects at the higher doses, which are used clinically for other approved indications).


From this press release, it's unclear to me what was measured, or in how many patients it
was measured in.


On June 6 2012, Ampio released another press release about its Optina phase 2 study,
this time from 32 patients. Recall from June 2011 investor presentation this was supposed
to be a 60 patient study. AMPE stated


At one of the low doses, regardless of BMI, there was a reduction of the subfield
central retinal thickness of approximately 20% at 4 and at 12 weeks, which was
statistically significant from placebo for the higher BMI group (p = 0.01). The lowest
dose of Optina™ showed a trend towards statistically significant reductions in central
retinal thickness in the lowest BMI groups (p = 0.11 and p = 0.13) at 4 and 12 weeks,
despite the small number of patients randomized to this dose.


Maybe this is a good result, but given that baseline data for treatment and control groups
were not provided, it's impossible to tell. It's also strange to blame small patient numbers
for not achieving p < 0.05 in a study that only enrolled half the planned patients.


On July 9 2012, AMPE issued a follow up press release on this study, in which it was
stated


An alpha of 0.20 was selected a priori for all analyses and any p value of less than
0.2 is considered statistically significant.


Interesting. Typically clinical studies are considered effective with a p value of less than
0.05. The approach of declaring after the study that you has prospectively declared a p of
0.20 of be valid is novel, and would have more credibility had AMPE previously mentioned
this. To the best of my knowledge, they did not.


Ampio is currently enrolling a phase 3 study of Optina to treat DME. (The primary endpoint
in this study is Improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at 12 weeks, a
secondary endpoint in the phase 2 study. AMPE has not, to the best of my knowledge,

disclosed the change in BCVA in the phase 2 study. One can assume that had the change
been positive that it would have been disclosed. Even with the ridiculouness of AMPE's
phase 2 Optina study, the phase 3 design is even sillier. Adam Feuerstein explained this
succinctly, and it's worthwhile to read his take. Suffice it to say, AMPE appears to have
deliberately run a study with no chance of obtaining FDA approval.


Ampion: ASP-ALA diketopiperazine (DA-DPK) to treat osteoarthritis via intra-knee
injection. DS-DPK is found naturally in albumin as a decomposition product. AMPE did
report data last year on a phase 2 clinical study of Ampion to reduce pain associated with
osteoarthritis. In this study, according to AMPE's most recent investor presentation, there
was no statistically significant change in difference in pain 3, 8, and 30 days post injection,
but magically at day 84 there was a change in pain with p = 0.04! I'm pretty impressed that
a small, highly polar molecule (which should have a half life in the body of minutes)
magically provided a benefit 84 days post dosing. Aside form the ridiculousness of
believing a small molecule drug would suddenly show benefit at 84 days, it's unclear if that
was even a prespecified endpoint. Looking at the clinical trial registry from Australia
(https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=343138), it appears that
observation in this study was supposed to be at day 2 and day 4. To be fair, AMPE was
slippery about the details initially (typical) and could have changed the endpoint, though
it's odd that it wasn't updated on the clinical trial website.


AMPE announced in in May 2012 that it had met with the FDA to obtain guidance for its
phase 3 clinical trials, and announced


The Company agreed with all the guidance for Ampion™ provided by CBER and
believes the regulatory path described is both reasonable and manageable by the
Company. The results of these trials (two phase III, well conducted, placebo
controlled trials, run concurrently) will form the basis for a BLA submission.


AMPE further stated in its November 2012 investor presentation


anticipate that US trial will begin at the end of 2012


Oddly, eight months after the May meeting in which AMPE agreed with the FDA's
guidance, in February 2013 , Ampio announced it's Phase III clinical study of Ampion™ for
the treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee


will include a dose-escalation run-in study as recommended by the FDA

Now, perhaps I'm outdated, but it seems to me that a study that informs the result of a
phase 3 study is a phase 2 study, which AMPE deftly does not refer to this as.
Regardless, it does strike me as peculiar that AMPE would have agreed with the FDA
guidance in May, and then changed the design. To be clear, the dose finding study AMPE
anticipated would begin by the end of 2012 began in April 2013, and data are expected by
Q3. The primary endpoint of this study is improvement in knee pain at 12 weeks. In theory,
this small molecule could well provide 12 weeks of pain relief but it would have to be "one
magic loogie".


In AMPE's Feb 25 2013 8-K they do state


However, the formal guidance the Company received from the FDA indicated that
the Company should conduct a dose ranging study "as a Phase II dose-escalation
study or as a run-in study for one of the Phase III studies.


In other words, they dropped the charade that the current ampion study was a phase 3
study.


On April 2, AMPE announced that it had started enrolling patients and had enrolled 15
patients as of that date.


On April 25 , AMPE announced that its dose finding study for ampion had enrolled in
excess of the targeted 320 patient goal.


The number of sites for the study is not listed. Does it seem odd to you that AMPE was
able to enroll greater than 305 OA patients in 17 days (assuming no patients were
enrolled on weekends)?


Finally, in his communication with us, our fund manager states


really remarkable how they're reproducing the Isolagen experience of constantly
misleading. Amazing that it's working so well for them


AMPE has a ton of, in our opinion, potentially worthless research studies in front of it! The
big question here is how the company will pay for these research studies?


The Q1 2013 balance sheet from the 10-Q shows the company finished the quarter with
almost $16 million in cash in the first quarter of 2013. The company is spending $4 million
a quarter in research currently. Our best guess is that the company will tap Aegis or
Fordham for a secondary offering 8.25M shares at $4.25 in the next few days.

Historically, in the days preceding an Ampio secondary offering, there are a number of
press releases and the stock price increases dramatically. In late May and June of 2012,
Ampio issued a number of press releases, including:


Ampio Pharmaceuticals Reports Pre-IND Meeting With the FDA to Obtain Clinical Path
Guidance for Ampion™ for the Treatment of Chronic Pain of Osteoarthritis of the Knee
and Schedules May 16th Webcast to Update Shareholders


Ampio Patent Protection for Optina™ Expands to Include Europe


Ampio Announces Positive Clinical Trial Results for the Treatment of Diabetic Macular
Edema with Orally Administered Optina


Ampio Reports Successful Type B Pre-IND Meeting with the FDA for its Drug Zertane™ to
treat Premature Ejaculation (PE)


The stock price reacted accordingly. From late May thru June 2012, it went from the mid
$2 range to $5.50. Here is chart of the price reaction:


Then, in early July, Ampio announced a stock offering


July 12: Ampio Pharmaceuticals Announces Pricing of Public Offering of 4,615,400
Shares of Common Stock (plus insider sales)


And the stock reacted, dropping quickly back down to below $3.

Now, Ampio will need funds soon to continue to fund Dr. Bar-Or's research. The press
releases have started to come out, and the stock price has reacted, going from $4.25 to
over $7:


What do you think will happen next?


There are just too many unanswered questions for this company to command the share
price it currently has. Here are just a few:

1. If you look at their November 2012 investor presentation it said they would start 2
pivotal phase 3 studies in Q1 13---this has apparently been forgotten, and the company is
waiting on a partner which it says it is in late stage negotiations for given zertane is a
generic drug for which the prior clinical study was stopped due to lack of commercial
interest this seems unlikely ampe has also fooled people into thinking they have 2 drugs in
pivotal studies ampion is in what's really a phase 2 study (i.e. dose finding) that will
determine dose for a phase 3 study given the laughable data from the phase 2 study (sta
sig, p = 0.04, only at 84 days post dosing this seems ludicrous ampe did start a phase 3
study of optina, with a 12 week endpoint. There is no current drug for dme approved on
such a short timeframe


2. How will Ampio raise the amount of capital it needs and not dramatically affect the stock
price?


3. If Zertane/Tramadol works, why did the Journal of Sexual Medicine conclude that it
didn't? If it works, why did Valeant Pharmaceuticals and DMI Biosciences abandon it?


4. If Zertane/Tramadol is safe, why did the FDA send the Warning Letter to Johnson and
Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) demanding that it disclose the risks?


5. Even if somehow Zertane proved successful and safe, and received approvals in
Europe or North America, why would a doctor prescribe it when generic Tramadol is
available?


6. If the demand for Tramadol as a cure for PE is so large, why couldn't Valeant enroll
enough participants to complete its study? Why


7. Why is only one hedge fund holding AMPE. By the way, we believe that this fund has
about 84% of its capital in one investment and no surprise - its not Ampio.


There are a lot of questions and very few answers. Greenwich may do a follow up on this
company after we see the final prospectus from the next offering.


Disclosure: I am short AMPE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.


Additional disclosure: This is my first of several articles on Ampio. The author, Joe
Dredly and his research group takes full responsibility for this article. We may short
additional shares or cover shares depending on what we see in the future.

This article is non sense!! I have to quote Agnew Peters from Yahoo finance message boards that wrote the following

Try Google to see if Joe Dredly exists. I did! Surprise, the so called author does not. The more shorts, the better. Just
ask Tesla Motors.... Bottom line, like Rick Santelli said on CNBC, " if you want to know the truth, follow the money !"
AMPE was at less than 3 dollars a year ago. Now it's at six. End of story!

WOW, your short! I would have never guessed! The only information that is new about this article coming from a short
player is the date. We have all heard these ridiculous, inconsistent, half truths and wrongfully misleading statements
before. I have been in the medical business since 1987 and made many,many times my investments in the industry.


I am always amazed at the complete idiocy of investors, fund managers and individuals who made the wrong play
(short), and continue to push their agenda hoping to turn the unavoidable, inevitable course and destiny of a growing
solid company around to their manipulative thought process. It won't work this time, and in most cases never does for
those who try at this stage with a company who has a solid pipeline. The proof will be out shortly, and you are about
to take a major bath. Oh sure, Ampio has made some mistakes with their shareholders, but their INTENT has always
been rock solid, especially when you evaluate their pipe vs. this multi-billion dollar industry.

I do want to thank you for one thing though! It has allowed this stock to be a great play off the yo yo you have created.
Rapid rise, get out, shorts make rapid fall, get back in, only this time buying one third more off the gains made. Please
try this one or two more times before the big releases come out, I want to buy 10-15 thousand more shares and don't
have the $50-75,000 needed.


It's so easy to see, it's like taking candy from a baby. So please, one or two more times while the price is still under
$10/share!!!


By the way, I'm long except for the in and out gains from our short friends, but I bet you would have never guessed
that.

This is the MOST OBVIOUSLY DECEPTIVE article designed to create selling to help the 5,000,000 shares short that

You're kidding, right? This is the most slanted, biased, agenda driven article that I've ever read on SA. Shame on

This article has no credibility. With huge near term catalysts on the horizon - Ampion trial results in 3rd Quarter,
Optina results in 4th Quarter, Luoxis data in 3rd Quarter, Zertane partnership tbd - it's painfully obvious this short who
is losing money on his position is trying to drive prices lower in order to cover. The bottom line is, it will all become
clear very soon. So why write this trash?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1486391-ampio-pharmaceuticals-50-shades-of-grey-secondary-on-the-way 16/25


Its not worth the time and effort to go through everything that is absurd about this "article" but let me just start
at the top.


I don't know anything about Isolagen (not that what happened to Isolagen after Macaluso left, and in which he
was not implicated, have anything to do with AMPE) but the article first makes the tie-in to Isolagen by stating
"Well a number of those same executives were the original founders of Ampio Pharmaceuticals." WRONG!! -
LIE!!


Ampio was "founded" through a name change from Chay Enterprises (a public shell company) "acquired"
through a reverse merger with DMI LifeSciences. DMI Life Sciences was a spin-off from DMI BioSciences. It
was NOT "founded" by a number of Isolagen executives. Macaluso made a significant cash investment into
the company for his shares. The founders of DMI BioSciences where the founders of Ampio, and had been
with DMI for 20 years.


Oh, heck, while I'm at it, I'll hit the next paragraph a bit: "Of course Ampio had no assets." WRONG!! - LIE!!
Ampio had significant assets primarily consisting of technology from DMI (a company that was founded by
David Bar-Or, and has been developing technology since the early 1990s).


Then we have this gem: "Management was savvy enough, before this idea got off the ground, to issue
themselves 7.35 million shares of stock for a penny a share in April of 2009." What? What idea is that
specifically? The idea of forming a spin-off company from that which you invested in and part of the deal is
issuing shares in the spin-off for a nominal amount? Its done all the time. The idea was to build a company
and commercialize technology that's been developed over the past 20 years. Good idea, if you ask me. Yes,
Macaluso had a lot more shares before - I'll have to go dig it all out and check, but I seem to recall he gave a
bunch back to induce DMI (Ampio's former "parent") to transfer the balance of its technology to Ampio.


I could go on - and on - and take days disproving almost every falsehood and innuendo of improper or "scam-
like" behavior. The article is all BS and nothing but a desperate attempt to negatively effect the share price so
the short investors can cover not only their shares, but their butts.

I don't get the response of the management. It did not address many issues raised in the article and instead went
straight for the author of an article written two years ago. Among the issues with their drug pipeline. Zertane is show
to be inferior to Tramadol HCI and Optina's phase II has zero bearing on the primary end point in phase III...The
Company appears to be a house of cards that is waiting to collapse...


Zertane appears to be a joke. If you read the paper published by Bar-Or in 2011 and compared the results to a paper
published in 2007.


Bar-Or's study of tramadol ODT end results :


Results and limitations: Tramadol ODT resulted in significant increases in median IELT 
compared with placebo; increases were 0.6 min (1.6 fold), 1.2 min (2.4 fold), and 1.5 min 
(2.5 fold) for placebo, 62 mg tramadol ODT, and 89 mg tramadol ODT, respectively 
(p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Men saw significantly greater improvement in all four 
measures of the PEP in both doses compared with placebo (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). 
Tramadol ODT was well tolerated; study discontinuation occurred in 0%, 1.0%, and 1.6% 
of subjects in placebo, 62 mg, and 89 mg tramadol ODT groups, respectively. Limitations 
include study inclusion for men with IELT up to 120 s.


07 study use tramadol HCI:


Results. The baseline (mean ± SD) IELT for patients before treatment was 1.17 ± 0.39 minutes. At the end of the 
treatment period utilizing the active drug, the mean IELT was increased significantly in patients on Tramadol 
treatment to 7.37 ± 2.53 minutes. The same patients on placebo medication had mean IELT of only 
2.01 ± 0.71 minutes. Patients uniformly reported satisfaction with their resulting control over ejaculation.

So let me get this straight, the generic tramadol provide results 3x better than the ODT and they are trying to get that
drug approved??


A specific discussion section on Bar-Or's paper:


Salem et al. previously examined the safety and efficacy 
of the same active ingredient present in tramadol ODT 
(tramadol HCl) for the treatment of PE [7]. Their AE rate in 
patients taking the study drug (13%) was similar to our 
study (12–16%). The authors examined the efficacy of the 
study drug by comparing mean changes in mean IELT by 
treatment group. It is well known that IELT is highly 
positively skewed and the mean IELT is an inappropriate 
estimator of effect size; we repeated their analyses for 
comparison purposes only. Salem and colleagues reported a 
mean end point IELT of 7.4 min with 25 mg tramadol HCl; 
these findings are disparate from ours (3.8 min for 62 mg 
tramadol ODT and 3.9 min for 89 mg tramadol ODT).

Abstract 
AIMS: 
To investigate the correlation between increased retinal thickness (RT) measured with spectral domain high-definition
optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA)) and best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with clinically significant macular oedema (CSME) and type 2 diabetes. 
METHODS: 
Seventy eyes with CSME were included in this observational study. Sixty-two eyes were considered for analysis and
were classified as having/not having retinal thickening in the central fovea (central 500-microm-diameter circle) by
Cirrus HD-OCT. RT measurements were computed and correlated with BCVA. For comparison purposes, the Stratus
OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA) central point thickness was also obtained in these eyes. 
RESULTS: 
In the 19 eyes with CMSE identified by Cirrus HD-OCT without increased RT in the central fovea (500-microm-
diameter circle), no correlation was found between RT and BCVA (R=0.062; 95% CI -0.404 to 0.502). In the 43 eyes
where the Cirrus HD-OCT identified an increased RT in the central fovea (central 500-microm-diameter circle), only a
moderate correlation between RT and BCVA was found (R=-0.459; 95% CI -0.667 to -0.184). 
CONCLUSION: 
Correlations between RT and BCVA in CSME are only present when the central 500-microm-diameter circle is
involved. However, even in this circumstance, a correlation was found in only 48.8% of the cases. RT cannot,
therefore, be used as a surrogate outcome for visual acuity changes.

How is the "facts" and "data" confusing to people? Those are published papers that show tramadol HCI gets

I agree with you that none of AMPE's clinical trials has any merit. That the Zertane phase 3 study has been
delayed so long seems pretty clear proof of that.

Really? What data do you expect from the "diagnostic device"? Best case, the only data AMPE will have is

Do you really believe Xuhua Zhou knows more than the FDA who had 3 large panels of their leading experts review
data from prior trials that was so compelling it caused them to actually provide guidance for the pivotal trials underway
now.


And their guidance is not near as demanding as for other trials of other drugs because safety and efficacy of Ampion,
Optina and Zertane have already been reasonably demonstrated.


09 Jun 2013, 02:25 AM 


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
This has nothing to do with who knows more who knows less. The paper referenced above are written by
experts in the field and they are backed up by data. I've got no beef about the fact Optina was somewhat
effective in reducing the retina thickness, but the paper I referenced clearly shows the weak to no correlation
between retina thickness and visual acuity, which is the primary end point in the 3rd trial. I'm sure the CTO at
the Company knows that as well but obviously his incentives are skewed in taking the drug into phase 3.
Again I did not say Zertane is ineffectively, I'm again quoting papers that show much greater efficacy of a
generic drug...What's the point of developing a drug when there's a much better and cheaper alternative in
the market already..It would be the equivalent of selling a computer that's a third of the performance but three
times the price..who's gonna buy it??

If a company requests a meeting, the FDA will generally grant it and will provide input. Asking that a company
conduct dose escalation prior to a pivotal trial is par for the course. They shouldn't need to, but most
companies are so eager to jump the horse that the FDA is forced to remind them the basic precepts of drug
development. This is in no way an endorsement by the FDA. They are saying: yeah, we'll allow you to
proceed with a pivotal trial if you prove to us that you have a dose response curve. Pretty basic, really.

Dear readers and Mr. Zhou 
I am informing everybody concerned that there is a direct co-relation between Retinal thickness + macular
edema and VA (visual acuity). increase in the retinal thickness and increase in the macular edema both cause
decrease in VA, this is not a theory THIS IS A HISTORICAL FACT WRITTEN IN OUR OPHTHALMOLOGY
TEXT BOOKS. 
Optina in clinical trials so far has shown to decrease both retinal thickness and macular edema. 
Important fact, Currently the treatment of choice for macular edema and retinal thickness is ----- You take a
syringe, load the drug and inject the drug directly into the eye ball. It is needless to say how uncomfortable it
is for us the Physicians. I can not comment on the feelings of our patients. Use of needle anywhere in the
body is a potential health hazard. OPTINA IS A PILL !!!  
Current market for this injectible form of treatment is dominated by big pharma and they are concerned about
Optina's approval. 
Thank you.

lmao, seems there is a lot to this RT (the way it is measured is fascinating). And infact changes in RT can
affect Visual acuity. 2 links do not prove a thing, but you shorts are wrong.

p.s. 
I just hate bashers is all, and I wanted to see if indeed there was a correlation to RT and VA. Guess what?
There is. AGAIN no position, just find it all fascinating.

These comments are not worthy of anyone's time that could be spent on actual research that clearly shows Ampio is
going to surprise a lot of short player and naysayers.


Good luck to everybody and be very careful about following negative writers whose only obvious interest is to
manipulate prices downward.


Less said the better because only results will count from here on out.


Talk is cheap unless you are talking to an attorney or a hooker.

I think your comment's the exact type of comment that's not worthy of anybody's time to read. If you have any
insights, make your case. Otherwise, your talk is cheap..

Hey Charley Chan, who all of a sudden put you on to AMPE? I see obcessive, endless negative bash comments
about Uni-Pixel, and now we should believe anything you say about AMPE? It strains all credulity. Go back into your
cave and keep posting about Uni-Pixel.

Speaking of cave... we write "obsessive". Obcessive might be acceptable in a cave but not otherwise.

Xuhua Zhou's wreckless and unfounded statements support the author to help cause as much selling as possible so
the shorts can cover with minimal losses. His comment .... "The Company appears to be a house of cards that is
waiting to collapse..." clearly shows his hand.


Careful examination shows that his comments are entirely unfounded and made to look credible by cutting and
pasting technical data that he clearly does not understand but wants you to think he does.


Think about this ... Last year, the FDA examined prior trial data on all three drugs, Zertane, Optina and Ampion before
they made a decision to assemble their large panel of experts that they don't do easily. The data was strong enough
that it caused the FDA to assemble large panels of their limited and valuable resources.


Now really, do you think Xuhua Zhou knows more than the FDA experts. They were so firmly convinced that they
provided guidance for the late stage trials of all three drugs that were relatively short in nature because the data was
so strong.


It's a free market and we all have free choices to buy or sell. I believe Xuhua Zhou and the Greenwich Research
Group are providing buyers with an outstanding opportunity to buy a cheap stock even cheaper.


Thank you for your help.

What is your point here. I read your comment and you said nothing..Which specific data point in those papers
i referenced is unfounded? Those are clearly contradicting to the Company's trial programs and I would love
for you to explain why those are not issues??

I won't waste time commenting on the rest of the article, but can say the comments about only one hedge fund being
long AMPE is BS. I've run a hedge fund for the last decade and my fund is long AMPE. I also know a couple other
funds that have gotten long AMPE. The summary of our assessments on the three drugs are: 
Zertane: Hard to say how big the market will ultimately be, but getting a partner for this and having the drug be
profitable seems likely. 
Ampio: will be a multi billion dollar drug if approved and the available data looks very promising. 
Optina: Has longer to go on the trial map, but available data looks very good and the drug would be a layup multi
billion dollar drug if approved.

Ah.. can you please prove that you have run a hedge fund or that you even know what a hedge fund does?
Otherwise please note that I have ran the US department of defense, several US senate committees, the
NIH, and departments of biology at Yale, Harvard, and MIT all while writing essays on the treatment of PE
and my opinion differs from yours.

"I am a Physician and I and many of my colleagues are long AMPE."


So what is your valid clinical data to support your long position in AMPE?


Can you address Bio.Bobby's question with concrete evidence without accusing someone else?

I addressed yours and Bobby's questions an hour ago, my reply has not been published. My five other
colleagues are with me here in LA, California. We will wait and see

Of course you are. I'm a physician, a physicist, and a phlebotomist.

Please try again. I am sure your answer is illuminating.

"My five other colleagues are with me here in LA, California."


So do you define "five" as "many" to prove that "many of my colleagues are long AMPE."?


I am not sure how you and your colleagues discussed about it in LA. By my colleagues and friends from
UCSF and Ivy Leagues have very different professional way to discuss about it.

Yes, you did address it with no reference of any data and texbook. We are still waiting for any valid clinical
data from you to support your long position.

Optina is basically Danazol ( a synthetic progesterone) The only difference between Danazol and optina is--- optina
will be used in much reduced strengths 1/10 or 1/20 to achieve the desired clinical results. 
Danazol is being used across the globe for decades for OB/GYN disorders etc. --- so in my humble opinion THERE IS
NO QUESTION of side effects what so ever. The physician community and the FDA scrutinize the side effect of a
drug very closely.  
I hope it is helpful.

Are you kidding me? There is a lot of side effect using Danazol which is basic form of Optina. Worse, there is even a
black box warning for it. Please check the following resource.

Innocent bystander here, 
"the so called Dr. and his pals in LA" didn't come up with an answer about RT (Retinal thickness), and Best correlated
visual acuity (BCVA). So, I looked it up.
