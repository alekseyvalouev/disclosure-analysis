M/A-COM Technology Solutions (MTSI): Exposing The Charade 
 


Since its IPO four years ago, MTSI has been methodically promoted as a 
growth business with “huge” opportunities. However, a thorough analysis 
of the operating model, financial results, and overall “growth story” 
reveals a very different picture marked by M&A that hides weak organic 
growth, intense hype, accounting alterations & shenanigans, and 
material misrepresentations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 


We believe M/A-COM’s charade of deceit began with a smoke and mirrors based IPO in 2012. With the help of 


its bankers and loyal sell-side analysts, MTSI was positioned as a turnaround with its re-energized new product 


pipeline driving organic growth acceleration. Through the subsequent years of failed promises and organic 


revenue declines, MTSI has relied on acquisitions to create the illusion of growth, while management has 


blatantly claimed acquired revenue as organic to “boost” reported results. We believe the Company’s liberal 


revenue recognition changes and “creative” Non-GAAP accounting that may appear straightforward on the 


surface, are blatant violations of SEC Regulation G and warrant an immediate SEC investigation. We also 


document material alterations to past quarter Non-GAAP presentations and pro-forma accounting treatments that 


vary quarter-to-quarter. 





Never shy about using forward-looking statements under the auspices of Safe Harbor language, we believe 


MTSI management has grossly misrepresented past results in its investor commentary. As we illustrate, SEC 


filings and investor materials have repeatedly diverged from management’s verbal commentary. MTSI has 


repeatedly winked and nodded about business opportunities measured in billions of dollars, all of which are 


always at the cusp of inflection or already ramping. Our analysis documents how none of these past stories have 


materialized in a tangible manner or have stemmed the secular decline in its core business.  





The latest growth story is premised on three product areas, each supposedly capable of doubling MTSI revenue 


in 3 – 5 years. However, unsettling discoveries from reputable sources, such as reports to Congress and 


documents from the FCC, NOAA and FAA, make it clear to us that two of these so-called opportunities (GaN 


and Active Antennas) are essentially R&D initiatives that are 5 – 10 years away from meaningful adoption (if 


they ever happen at all). The third story, datacenter 100G, is still in the concept stage and requires drastic cost 


reductions before meeting necessary price points. Despite the emerging holes in its story, MTSI management 


continues to set a lofty goal of 30% revenue CAGR, which stands in stark contrast to the Company’s negative 


6% organic revenue CAGR over the past four fiscal years.  





There are four factors that have driven MTSI’s severe dislocation from economic reality. First, prior to its IPO, 


MTSI was 66% owned by its Chairman and majority holder John Ocampo. While concentrated ownership is 


often aligned with shareholder interests, Mr. Ocampo’s incessant selling may suggest his incentives to “go the 


extra mile” to maximize valuation may have blurred the line with accurate messaging. Second, MTSI was a 


hodge-podge of unexciting microwave components in secular decline (Ford’s SYNCTM system was the growth 


component), which meant management required a “Cinderella’s story.” Third, MTSI’s leadership included a first 


time CEO. As a result, we have not found the typical conservative and transparent approach to investor 


communication. Instead, we believe Mr. Croteau has played fast-and-loose with numbers, while grossly 


underestimating the risks of misrepresentations and projections that are decoupled from reality. Fourth, MTSI 


has perpetuated the charade and illusion of growth through significant acquisitions in December in each of the 


last three years. To wit, MTSI has become an investment banker’s dream, which we would surmise may be a 


contributor to the lenient analysis and favorable ratings espoused by the sellside. While the carrot of future 


growth “opportunities” has been consistently dangled to investors, insiders have unloaded hundreds of millions 


of dollars’ of shares.     





The “borrow-acquire-grow and make promises about the future” game fails to work once investors lose 


confidence. With the analysis herein, the toothpaste will be out of the bottle. In our opinion, as that occurs, 


management will be hard pressed to explain the voluminous unhedged and irresponsible promises from past 


conference calls. Based on the rampant insider selling, this could present a major problem for management based 


on questionable revenue recognition changes and other deceptive tactics. When the dust settles, investors will see 


MTSI for what it is: a business that has organically missed the original fiscal year estimates by a staggering $32 


million the last four years, representing a 7.8% average annual shortfall. As the truth emerges, we expect the 


business to be valued for what it is – a debt-burdened, no-growth company in need of a hard expectation reset 


and a proper turnaround under a different management team.

THE FIVE OVERARCHING SEGMENTS COVERED HEREIN 
  


I. Exposing MTSI Management For Abusing Investor Trust with Smoke & Mirrors 
   AND 


II. Exposing MTSI Management’s Accounting & Reporting Shenanigans 


 In its F1Q15 (C4Q14) results, MTSI had a $15.1 million revenue and $0.18 EPS benefit from changing 
revenue recognition from sell-thru to sell-in. This was not communicated when the Company provided 


guidance in November 2014. If this effect had been disclosed at the time of guidance, the implied organic 


guidance would have been 11% - 14% and 45% - 55% below the prevailing consensus revenue and EPS 


estimates, respectively. This would have very likely resulted in a massive disappointment and significant 


stock price decline. The CEO’s prepared comments did not acknowledge the accounting change and the 


CFO’s comments failed to specifically state whether the accounting change was included in guidance. It 


stands to reason that the 51% advance in MTSI’s share price from the November earnings call to the January 


earnings release was primarily driven by the deceptive accounting changes. We would note that Mr. Ocampo 


sold $11.8 million worth of shares during this period in open-market sales. The accounting shenanigans 


continued into the next quarter with a $3.7 million one-time benefit from a deferred revenue recognition 


“windfall.” Without this benefit, MTSI’s actual results would have missed the midpoint of guidance and been 


$3 million below consensus estimates for F2Q15. Instead, due to a one-time revenue benefit, MTSI “beat” by 


$1 million.  


 In F1Q16 (C4Q15), MTSI once again pushed the boundaries of accounting interpretations into an area we 
believe violates SEC guidelines. After previously excluding the impact from discontinued operations, MTSI’s 


Non-GAAP Net Income calculation was inexplicably altered to no longer exclude Income from Discontinued 


Operations (the divested Automotive business). This calculation change to Non-GAAP Net Income added 


$1.2 million, which resulted in a 6% overstatement compared to its prior definition. Combined with the fact 


MTSI’s headline Non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 also included $0.5 million from acquisitions done during the 


quarter (i.e. not part of original guidance), the “true” EPS of $0.37 was at the low end of guidance and below 


consensus estimates. The unexplained inclusion of previously excluded Income from Discontinued 


Operations appears to be a blatant violation of the Non-GAAP disclosure requirement of SEC Regulation G.  


 After including discontinued operations in F1Q16, MTSI retrospectively altered the presentation in its 
subsequent earnings release for F2Q16 to exclude Income from Discontinued Operations. Incredibly, the 


Company chose to add back the income from Consulting Agreements related to the discontinued and divested 


Automotive business. This is a direct violation of MTSI’s own accounting policy as outlined in its 10-K 


that Consulting Agreement income is included in Discontinued Operations. The net result of MTSI’s 


altered treatment of Consulting Agreements, which were previously discontinued operations, results in an 


artificial $1.875 million quarterly boost to Non-GAAP Net Income. We believe this is a clear violation of 


SEC Regulation G and warrants an investigation by the SEC and MTSI’s Board (unlikely considering its 


Chairman). 


 Mr. Croteau has made many misleading statements, yet two warrant material scrutiny. First, perhaps in the 
spirit of focusing hype on the core business and deemphasizing the Automotive business, he encouraged 


analysts to model low-20% operating margins for Automotive revenue. The obvious result, in hindsight, was 


that the investment community overestimated the profitability of the core business. After MTSI announced it 


would divest this business, public filings revealed that the Automotive business had delivered 31.5% 


operating margins in FY2014 and 30.5% in the first three quarters of FY2015. While it is impossible to know 


whether the misleading margin insinuations were a function of ethics or incompetence, we believe the Ford 


business had limited life in sole-sourced status and MTSI attempted to soften the eventual perception hit as 


that business went away. Second, and perhaps more egregious than the misleading margin concerns, was Mr. 


Croteau’s promise to “backfill” the divested Automotive revenue through organic growth in lasers and optical 


components “within a few quarters.” In the body of our report on this section, we clearly show that the 


Company’s proud statement that it had filled the revenue hole just six months later was misleading as the vast 


majority of the revenue came from two acquisitions completed in December 2015.  


 More recently, on its F2Q16 earnings call, MTSI CEO “guaranteed” that organic revenue growth QoQ was 
“double-digits” in F1Q16. MTSI’s SEC disclosures reveal F1Q16 organic revenue was down 1.2% q/q and 


F2Q16 was up only 3.2% q/q. These numbers are obviously grossly decoupled from Mr. Croteau’s guarantee. 


While the complacent sell-side refuses to fact check MTSI’s misleading statements, we provide all of the 


analysis necessary to determine the actual growth rates.
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________5 


 Since acquiring BinOptics, MTSI has repeatedly alluded to doubling its capacity in the first six months after 
closing the deal and quadrupling it within a year. Inline with these claims, MTSI’s analyst day presentation 


depicted laser shipments almost quadrupling from F1Q15 (the quarter BinOptics was acquired) to F1Q16. 


Yet the story does not appear to reconcile with basic math, which suggests a disturbing number of 


discrepancies exist between management’s verbal statements and what is disclosed in SEC filings. For 


example, MTSI’s 10-Q and 10-K filings break out BinOptics full quarter revenue and indicate that BinOptics 


revenue were up only 44% in F3Q15 compared to the full pre-acquisition F1Q15 quarter, despite statements 


that the business doubled in six months. MTSI’s comments about capacity increases and analyst day slides 


showing a 4x increase in shipments look highly misleading if the price breaks offered to customers resulted 


in much slower revenue growth. 





III. Three Growth Opportunities: Still “Pie-in-the-Sky” After Years of Hype 


 1) GaN is one of the three product areas that MTSI claims can double the company’s revenue in 3 – 5 years. 
MTSI told investors GaN was a major growth driver two years ago. Management stated that they would 


disrupt the basestation power amplifier market (current LDMOS technology) and capture 80% market share 


of the $2.5 billion addressable market. A careful analysis of the market suggests MTSI’s GaN is nothing 


more than a glorified R&D project with highly uncertain prospects that will not see rubber meet the road for 


many years. Obviously, MTSI has not disrupted the market, and contrary to the CFO’s unambiguous 


statement that all “exciting opportunities” were “designed and qualified” as of May 2014, MTSI’s GaN 


product for basestations is yet to be qualified. The crux of the GaN argument is that it performs better at 


higher frequencies and there is speculation that the 5G wireless standard may spur the use of higher 


frequency bands. While the opportunity with 5G is unknown, deployments are at least 5 years out based on 


the Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance estimates. Further, there is no obvious reason for mobile 


network operators to undertake the hassle and cost of re-qualifying mature and cost-optimized 4G basestation 


equipment if the frequency bands do not change and GaN equipment costs are similar. Second, these higher 


frequencies have severe limitations due to signal loss and an inability to penetrate walls. As a result, the 


technical feasibility of higher frequencies is debatable, while the economic appeal has yet to be proven. 


Third, high frequencies are not licensed for cellular use in the US or anywhere else. The FCC started 


exploring this idea in October 2015 and has ran into an opposition from the satellite industry. In this context, 


MTSI’s plan to qualify the GaN products in summer 2016 and ramp revenue in by the end of the year seems 


consistent with so many of the Company’s promises since coming public. As such, we would expect to hear 


more of management’s selective disclosures from recent investor conferences that GaN revenue may slip out 


of 2016 and into 2017. 


 2) Active Antennas are the second growth driver that MTSI claims should double its revenue in 3 – 5 years. 
The crux of this story centers on the ramp of military and civil radars that use electronic scanning (a large 


number of small modules on radar surface scanning different segments of space simultaneously as opposed to 


traditional passive scanning). MTSI has built “tiles” that are building blocks for such radars. It has been two 


years since MTSI announced a $300 million program “under way” to upgrade F-16 fighter planes and other 


opportunities in active antennas, the biggest one being MPAR – the aspirational program to upgrade 350 


radars in the US for an opportunity of $500 million per year. Despite intermediate promises to see MPAR or 


Active Antenna revenue as far back as F3Q15 or F4Q15, the contribution to MTSI revenue remains 


negligible, as evidenced in MTSI’s 2016 analyst day slides and commentary. While government program 


delays are common, the MPAR deployment timelines of two agencies driving the MPAR program – NOAA 


and FAA, illustrate how deceptive and unrealistic MTSI’s promises appear. In a 2015 report to the Congress, 


NOAA set out a timeline for MPAR deployment starting in 2025, which is a timeline similar to what the 


FAA has presented. How can MTSI argue that active antennas will be a key driver of revenue doubling over 


the next 3 - 5 years when its customers do not expect deployments for nine years?  


 3) Optical components, especially 100G, are MTSI’s third growth area behind its promise to double revenue 
in 3 – 5 years. Unsurprisingly, this segment looks nearly identical to the first two segments: (i) promoted for 


a couple years without tangible results, (ii) aiming at a future market that is yet to materialize, with products 


that are not yet qualified (25G lasers), and at cost points that are not yet market-proven. To be clear, MTSI 


has analog components that can be used in 100G datacenter equipment, but the “big opportunity” is selling 


25G lasers to major datacenter operators for 100G transition. With the inherited portfolio of 2.5G PON lasers 


from BinOptics, the transition to 25G lasers may appear reasonable. However, MTSI does not have a 


working 25G laser at the required yield levels, and our diligence with optical component vendors
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________6 


unequivocally suggests that MTSI it is not close to having a working 25G laser. Nonetheless, we believe 


MTSI continues to mislead/misrepresent its 25G laser product progress, as evidenced by the highly 


misleading January 2016 press release stating AAOI has placed orders, and its F2Q16 earnings call statement 


that 25G lasers are already shipping (only to reveal later that these are not at required yield points and a real 


“inflection point” is more like 2017).  





IV. China and BinOptics – Double- or Triple-Ordering 


 BinOptics has been running heavily capacity constrained for several quarters, selling to Chinese OEMs who 
are notorious for double-ordering (e.g. Huawei). MTSI’s own recent forecast for the PON market had the 


industry growth (i.e. demand) stalling in 2016, which was ironically coincident with BinOptics adding 


capacity (i.e. no more incentive to double-order). While MTSI has pointed to a 4K transition and more 


content per box to combat investor fears of a China PON meltdown, data points continue to emerge (such as 


from Taiwanese module maker eLASER or US-based SemTech), of a demand slowdown and inventory 


digestion. With BinOptics as the only meaningful organic growth segment within MTSI (we estimate 


approximately 20% of revenue), the impact of a PON slowdown should be significant and is not reflected in 


consensus estimates. 


 A second major risk to MTSI on its optical segment is the possibility of the US Commerce Department 
imposing sanctions against MTSI’s largest customer Huawei. The U.S. Commerce Department recently 


subpoenaed Huawei on June 2, 2016 based on its involvement in Iran and Syria. ZTE was sanctioned earlier 


in March and is operating under temporary relief through August 30, 2016. With Huawei accounting for 17% 


MTSI F2Q16 revenue, and driving virtually all of the organic revenue growth in F1H16, sanctions are a 


material risk for MTSI. 





V. Consensus Estimates Imply A Baseless Growth Inflection. Fair Value < $21.08 


 Since its IPO four years ago, MTSI has delivered average organic revenue 8% below the prevailing 
consensus estimates when each fiscal year began. Acquisitions and accounting shenanigans have masked an 


ugly 6% negative organic revenue CAGR from FY2012 to FY2015, which contrasts with management’s high 


growth claims.  


 Through the BinOptics acquisition, MTSI has captured share in China’s PON build out through pricing that 
Avago and Mitsubishi wouldn’t match. It is unsurprising that Huawei has become the largest customer of 


MTSI. However, this growth at Huawei has masked a revenue decline of 1% y/y in F1H16 from all of 


MTSI’s other customers. The incipient data points supporting a PON slowdown, combined with potential 


sanctions on Huawei, creates material risk that the modest organic growth experienced in FY2016 will not 


continue.  


 As a result, we believe consensus estimates for F2H16, and more importantly for FY2017 where estimates 
imply 14% organic revenue growth, are meaningfully mis-modeled. The overwhelming body of evidence 


suggests MTSI’s three proclaimed growth opportunities (GaN, Active Antennas and Datacenter 100g) are 


unlikely to materialize any time soon, if ever. Barring additional acquisitions that obfuscate growth trends, 


we believe MTSI’s FY2017 revenue growth will reflect its multi-year organic revenue trajectory of flattish 


growth at best. 


 Generously assuming MTSI can overcome its margin dilutive acquisitions and return to 60% gross margin in 
FY2017, we estimate Non-GAAP EPS will fail to grow materially in FY2017. In light of the long-tail risks to 


its business, organic growth declines, material insider selling on a story we believe was misrepresented, and 


estimates that are too high, we see no reason investors will pay up for MTSI. Applying the 12x P/E multiple 


(generous for a debt-burdened, no-growth company that has a mark-to-reality ahead), we estimate fair value 


to be no more than $21.08 per share, or 39% below recent market prices.

A One Page Crash Course Behind Four-Years of Smoke and Mirrors 





 M/A-COM’s core business has been in microwave and millimeter wave radio components, with the “M/A” in 
its name derived from its original name “Microwave Associates.” The last compelling market for microwave 


components was basestation backhaul, which had brief success in the mid-2000’s, but has been in secular 


decline since 2009 as wireline alternatives have become more viable. The 90%+ collapse in share prices of 


pure-play microwave backhaul equipment vendors DRWI, CRNT and AVNW since their 2007-2010 peaks is 


a good proxy for the challenges in MTSI’s core business.  


 The business was operated as a cash cow by Tyco. After changing hands a couple times, it was picked up in 
2009 for $60 million ($90 million with earnout) by John Ocampo, who had recently sold SMDI to RFMD for 


$900 million. The positive glimmer of hope in M/A-COM’s otherwise struggling product portfolio was its 


ramping business in Ford’s SYNCTM entertainment system – not a core market for M/A-COM but a strong 


P&L driver at the time. 


 The MTSI charade appeared to start around the 2012 IPO when it was positioned as a story of reenergized 
R&D and new products in the core, which was driving growth acceleration beyond the industry’s 14% 


growth outlook. The Automotive business, which was essentially Ford, was left out of the spotlight, even 


though it was pulling a disproportionate share of the P&L weight.   


 However, results in the next 18 months started to expose the deep disconnect of the IPO story from the reality 
as MTSI’s FY2012 and FY2013 core revenue actually declined by 7.2% and 7.9%, respectively, while 


growth in Automotive accelerated to 32.7% and 76.7%, respectively. 


 Instead of owning up to the reality of a failed turnaround, MTSI’s new CEO/CFO team, with presumable 
influence from its Chairman and majority shareholder, John Ocampo, acquired MindSpeed (MSPD) for $313 


million and Nitronex for $26 million, which was owned by none other than Mr. Ocampo himself. The pivot 


from turnaround to acquisitions needed a story, which was ultimately centered on disrupting the basestation 


power amplifier market with GaN products. A May 2014 Analyst Day completed the full makeover with eye-


popping organic growth projections and forecasts of huge addressable markets seemingly imminent 


opportunities. 


 The Company “reported” 24.0% revenue growth in FY2014, which was labeled as an “excellent year of 
growth” and a “successful rebirth of M/A-COM as a growth company.” MTSI proudly announced that it had 


been presented the Deloitte & Touche award for Technology Fast 500 fastest-growing companies in North 


America. However, as we meticulously illustrate, the growth was not what it appeared. Based on our 


analysis, excluding MSPD and Nitronex, MTSI’s organic growth in FY2014 was a measly 0.6%.  


 As MTSI was on the cusp of lapping its two transformational acquisitions, MTSI acquired BinOptics in 
December 2014. Making organic growth comparisons more difficult, MTSI’s management continued its 


intense and misleading growth story. Yet, the facts painted a different picture. Based on analysis from public 


records, we believe MTSI’s organic revenue growth rate was negative 2.8% in FY2015, when excluding the 


BinOptics acquisition, a one-time revenue recognition benefit, and the divested Automotive business. 


 Continuing the cadence of annual acquisitions in December that render growth comparisons challenging, 
MTSI bought two struggling companies in December 2015 for a combined $97 million. In March 2016, the 


Company held its second analyst day, where attendees where treated to a story that became even more 


detached from reality. Management provided an organic growth target of “20%+” and flagged three distinct 


product areas that would double MTSI revenue in 3 – 5 years. As we illustrate herein, the facts fail to 


reconcile with the story.  


 Despite numerous claims of massive growth and large new product opportunities, MTSI’s organic revenue 
has declined at a 6% CAGR since its 2012 IPO. Over that same period, MTSI has spent $548 million on 


acquisitions (net of divestitures) to perpetuate a convoluted revenue growth story. Shareholders have 


experienced 18% share dilution since the IPO and $346 million of debt has been added to the balance sheet.  


 Meanwhile, Chairman Ocampo has sold $190 million of shares (25% of his pre-IPO holdings), with sales of 
$86 million in 2016 YTD alone. Mr. Ocampo’s sales have been accompanied by $4 million of sales by CEO 


John Croteau and 10b5-1 plans instituted in April and May 2016 by the Chairman and CFO suggest their 


desire to unload shares will continue unabated.

I. Exposing MTSI Management For Abusing Investor Trust with Smoke & Mirrors 
 


A. 1950s - 2000s: MTSI Origins – A boring microwave components business in search of an owner.  
 


MTSI’s origins date back to 1950s when it operated under the name of “Microwave Associates,” selling 


microwave equipment to the US military1. This is where the “M/A” in “M/A-COM Technology Solutions” 


comes from. The “-COM” part was added in 1978 as the company expanded into the telecom space and the 


“Technology Solutions” part was added in 2009 when the commercial portion of the business was separated 


from the military portion and divested out of Cobham plc.  





Microwave components have been at the core of MTSI since its beginning. The military part of the microwave 


market has largely remained a niche after various hyped opportunities for fleet upgrades and program ramps. The 


basestation backhaul part of the microwave market has seen two hype cycles – first in the dot-com era and then 


in mid 2000s - but microwave backhaul equipment revenue started to decline in 20092, as wireline alternatives 


became more viable, and have been in a secular decline since then.3,4,5,6 This is obvious from the performance of 


the pure-play microwave backhaul equipment providers DRWI, CRNT and AVNW whose share prices are down 


over 90% from their peaks in 2007-2010.   





In 1999, Tyco acquired AMP Inc. - which itself had acquired M/A-COM in 1995 – but in 2008 Tyco jettisoned 


the RF Components and Subsystems Business (predecessor of current MTSI) to Cobham for $425 million, which 


in turn divested the commercial portion of the business under the current name of M/A-COM Technology 


Solutions to John Ocampo in 2009. Ocampo subsequently reduced his ownership to 57.0% post-IPO in 2012 and 


to 40.7% currently. Nobody seems to want to own this business for very long. 





B. 2009: Ocampo Buyout – Seeing the Automotive “Gem” in the Rubble of the Core Business. 
 


John Ocampo had a big win before the MTS buyout – he sold the company he had founded, Sirenza 


Microdevices (SMDI), to RF Micro Devices in 2007 for $900 million. He started GaAs Labs private equity to 


look for other deals and bought MTS from Cobham for $30 million cash, $30 million 7.5% loan and potential 


$30 million earnout. In FY2007 (Sep), the business had revenue of $275 million with less than $10 million 


operating profit. Cobham’s CFO commented that “Cobham has sold MTS in the face of difficult market 


conditions.”   





But why would a smart guy like Ocampo buy an unexciting business like MTS in the first place? We believe the 


answer is Ford SYNCTM – the entertainment system Ford started using in 2007 – as it contained a meaningful 


amount of MTS components. This was a one-off win for MTS in the automotive market, but Ford was ramping 


SYNCTM across its models and in January 2009 MTS even increased its content by adding GPS and Bluetooth 


connectivity. This was far from MTS’s traditional markets of networking, aerospace, defense and multi-market 


catalog parts and was the only meaningful automotive business MTS ever had, but it was a boost to total revenue 


and profits. 





C. 2012: MTSI 1.0 – Misleading IPO Story Flops Right Out of the Gates.  
 


With FY2011 Ford revenue growing 26.9%, 860 bps faster than the “core” MTS business, Ocampo capitalized 


on the momentum to IPO the company in March of 2012. However, the IPO story was crafted around 


accelerating growth in core MTS business (outside of Automotive/Ford) driven by a torrent of new products that 


apparently had been introduced by the company. The company set a target of outgrowing its industry, which 


itself was growing at a 14.0% CAGR according to MTSI’s IPO Prospectus: 


 
“Frost & Sullivan estimates that the worldwide market for RF, microwave and millimeterwave semiconductors 


across Networks, A&D and Multi-market applications will expand from $33.2 billion in 2010 to $83.1 billion in 


2017, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.0%.” 





The table below has quotes from analyst initiation reports that consistently describe a story of growth led by 


Networking and Aerospace & Defense with emphasis on new product rollouts and market share gains.

________________________________________________________________________9 





Table 1: Quotes From MTSI Analyst Initiation Reports 


“We believe MTSI is positioned to grow faster than the overall industry it addresses (12-14% CAGR)… We believe 


market share gains, design wins, and new product ramps should drive double-digit sales growth at least 200-300 bps 


above peers, while a richer product mix and operational efficiencies should drive margin expansion of over 1,000 


bps (next six quarters).” 


JP Morgan initiation report, April 24, 2012  





“We believe M/A-COM is at the beginning of a strong and sustainable growth trajectory fueled by a reinvented 


product strategy and pipeline (3x larger)… We see sustainable 15% Y/Y growth with additional leverage as new 


products ramp… We see several material wins in Networking and A&D including cellular backhaul (38GHz and

“At the heart of MTSI's turnaround is the company's decision to increase R&D from 8% of sales over 2 years ago, to 


13% of sales in the most recent quarter. This investment is evident in the 3x increase in engineering headcount, and 


more importantly a tripling of new semiconductor product releases from 20 in FY09 to 60 in FY11… The company's 


increased R&D investment leads us to forecast YoY revenue growth to accelerate through the year to exit CY12 at

Note that Ford or the Automotive business were not integral to the thesis and were glossed over as a growth 


driver, even though Ford was a disclosed customer in the IPO Prospectus (10.9% of revenue in FY2010 and 


11.6% in FY20117). The story told by MTSI at its IPO, and rehashed by its analysts, was detached from the 


reality of the Automotive business pulling disproportionate amount of the weight while the stagnant core 


business was being paraded as a revamped, reenergized, high growth business. 





Still, the IPO priced at the high end of the $17 - $19 range and investors quickly got a taste of weak support for 


the MTSI turnaround story. MTSI guided down on its first earnings call - less than two months after its IPO. 


F3Q12 revenue was guided to $78 - $82 million vs. $81 million consensus and apparently with even 84% of the 


quarter already on the books as of May 8, 2012, MTSI eventually missed the quarter, delivering $77.1 million. In 


addition to the revenue shortfall, a 220 bps gross margin miss resulted from the “unexpected” weakness in higher 


margin (and seemingly more predictable) Aerospace & Defense business, which was followed by a 110 bps 


gross margin miss in F4Q12, accompanied by a sharp reversal of management’s prior outlook for an expected 


recovery of Networking in the second half of 2012. 





Over the course of the next eighteen months MTSI delivered FY2012 and FY2013 results that were completely 


dislocated from the IPO story. The Automotive business, kept under wraps at the IPO, accelerated, while the 


core business, where all the growth was expected to come from, actually declined, as shown in Table 2 below. 


Automotive revenue (using Ford as proxy in FY2011 and FY2012) was up 32.7% in FY2012 and 76.7% in 


FY2013 while the core business declined 7.2% and 7.9% in those years.

Note: Ford revenue used as proxy for Automotive revenue in FY2011 and FY2012. 





We believe this was not just a matter of poor execution or an unfavorable macro environment. We are confident 


this was a carefully orchestrated plan by MTSI’s Chairman and majority owner John Ocampo from the 


beginning to flip the challenged core business to naïve public investors under the illusion of growth being 


created by the ramping Automotive business. But Automotive could not have been the centerpiece of the IPO 


story – it was a non-core market and unlikely to experience sustained growth. The IPO pitch sounded much 


better as a “Cinderella story” with neglected product lines finally getting the nourishment of R&D dollars and 


ready to propel MTSI to a new era of growth. It was a good story, except it was not true. It was an extremely 


misleading story, in our view, delivered by MTSI’s then CEO Charles Bland and CFO Conrad Gagnon, with the 


help of Chairman John Ocampo, who personally participated in the IPO roadshow.  





There is an important nuance in our mind between an incompetent management team and a misleading one. The 


abject failure to deliver the promised growth in the two fiscal years after the IPO could have happened to an 


incompetent management team. The collapse of the core business simply does not reconcile with the growth 


story that MTSI painted – one that was diversified across several end markets and hundreds of new products. It 


is highly unlikely that one single product or market could have stalled the growth in core. It is much more 


plausible in our view that MTSI management and its majority owner knew very well what was coming but chose 


to steer (i.e. mislead) investors towards an unrealistic growth story to complete an IPO.  





Speaking of self-interest, John Ocampo sold $27.9 million worth of shares in the two years following the IPO 


and was still sitting on 26 million shares worth approximately $450 million – not bad at all for $60 million 


invested ($90m if the earnout was paid).  





A closer look reveals that John Ocampo killed more than one bird with the MTSI IPO – he “bundled in” another 


one of his companies before the IPO. In May 2010, MTSI bought Mimix Broadband – a Texas based RF 


company in which Ocampo had invested $10 million in July 2008 and owned a majority stake. MTSI paid $1.2 


million cash and 17.5 million preferred shares (equivalent of 4.4 million common) or $84 million value at the 


IPO price of $19 per share. This was a nice exit for the startup which had generated revenue of $25.4 million in 


FY2008.8 This wasn’t the only time Ocampo offloaded a struggling investment to MTSI. In February 2014, he 


sold Nitronix to MTSI for $26.1 million in cash, a healthy price tag for a business generating revenue of $1 


million per quarter and a promise of ramping Gallium Nitride (GaN) that has never materialized.

Approaching the two-year anniversary of the IPO, MTSI’s share price was drifting sideways, having dropped 


over 10% from the IPO, and underperforming the SOX Index which had risen 32% during the same period. 


There was also another problem – the Ford business had peaked at $20 - $21 million of revenue per quarter in 


late 2013, which meant the core business was at risk of being exposed.  





MTSI needed a new “cover up” for the core business and the story needed a makeover. So Ocampo and his new 


CEO John Croteau went to work. They acquired Mindspeed Technologies (MSPD) for a $313.3 million 


enterprise value. To say that MSPD was a struggling business would be an understatement – the stock price had 


declined from $50 in 2004, to $10 in 2010, and to less than $3 before MTSI’s $5.05 offer in December 2013. 


Shortly after the acquisition, MTSI held an analyst day in May 2014. The story evolved to focus on share gains 


and ramping GaN products, which was a new “growth vector” that came through the Nitronex acquisition just 


two months earlier. The new CEO John Croteau turned up the hype machine during the opening remarks of the 


analyst day (emphasis added): 


 
“M/A-COM is a growth company. That's the story you're going to hear this morning. Hopefully you'll leave as 


excited as I am about our prospects of outgrowing the industry and outperforming our peers for years to come. “ 





“The market and business stories that you are going to hear this morning add up to far exceed our internal goal 


of outgrowing the market by a factor of 3X. Again, we are grossly underpenetrated, relative to our natural share 


and our target markets. That's why we are highly confident that we can outgrow our competition minimally by 2X. 


We don't expect to bat 1,000 but we do aspire to win the Triple Crown. We'll have our share of home runs. On 


average, we will outbat the competition head-to-head and we'll even steal a few runs here and there, for speed 


and agility”. 





“I talked at the beginning about the opportunity with technology transitions and market transitions, whether it's 


markets transitioning to a radar detection, for both communications and radar, or technology transitions like 


gallium nitride and silicon germanium. Those present opportunities to grab even greater share. So -- and I said 


we're not going to bat 1000. (laughter) That said, we're planning on batting 1000. And if we do that, these turn 


into hypergrowth areas for MACOM. So, well on top of that 11% or 10% [CAGR], depending on which chart 


you're looking at. There is fabulous opportunity to grow here again, at several integer multiples of the market 


growth rate. But of course, batting 1000 is only theoretical. And so we de-rate that a little bit in terms of what we 


want to publicly commit”. 





MTSI CFO Bob McMullan echoed the CEO’s comments, yet specifically alluded to organic growth that was 


inconsistent with the financial results (emphasis added): 


 
“As John said, MACOM today is a growth story. MACOM believes it continues to realize market-share gains 


from our higher-margin products, generating solid organic growth, and our catalog product provides a source of 


recurring demand…” 





With a full quarter of acquired MSPD revenue, MTSI had just reported F2Q14 revenue growth of 38.1% y/y and 


was on track to post an impressive-looking growth number in FY2014. This surely gave MTSI management 


credibility to claim MTSI was a growth company and set big organic growth targets, or did it?  





The troubling truth was that excluding the $32.6 million revenue contribution from the MPSD acquisition9 and 


$0.4 million from the Nitronex acquisition,10 organic revenue actually declined by 4.2% y/y in F2Q14. In fact, 


FY2012 revenue declined by 2.6% y/y (declined by 7.2% ex Automotive), and while FY2013 reported revenue 


were up 5.5%, more than 100% of the growth came from Automotive, which was up 76.7% while revenue ex 


Automotive declined 7.9%. With Automotive revenue having stalled to 1.6% and 0.2% y/y growth in F1Q14 and 


F2Q14, respectively, that segment could no longer be called a growth business. The non-Automotive business, 


excluding acquisitions, was declining and could not be called a growth business in good faith either. In this 


context management calling M/A-COM a “growth company” was a gross misrepresentation of facts, in our view, 


and could make for a brilliant exhibit in a class action lawsuit.

Table 3 below outlines the simple math that exposes the huge discrepancy in MTSI’s reported vs. organic 


growth. Note that organic growth in FY2014 ended up being a measly 0.6% (2.3% ex Automotive), far from 


anything that would qualify as a “growth company”.

Perpetuating the fabricated organic growth story, MTSI went on to actually raise their official long term organic 


growth target at the 2014 Analyst Day from “above industry growth” to “2x the market growth,” while the CEO 


pointed to an internal target of 3x the market growth, as quoted above.

around the corner. We address these “growth opportunities’ individually later in the report as we compare the

As a side note - notice how CFO Bob McMullan is more careful with his statements than CEO John Croteau. We 


note he had several years of public company CFO experience at GSPN and CNXT. As such he undoubtedly 


realized the severe consequences of misleading statements. On the other hand, MTSI was John Croteau’s first 


CEO role facing public investors, and he was far less careful with unhedged, unconditional statements about 


what MTSI is and “will” do.  





The high intensity propaganda about MTSI as a growth company were not an isolated event and has continued 


steadily since the IPO. For example, on the C3Q14 (F4Q14) earnings call, MTSI management stated in prepared 


comments (emphasis added):  


 
“Summing up an excellent year of growth for MACOM, I would like to mention that we remain[ to] Deloitte & 


Touche's 2014 Technology Fast 500 fastest-growing companies in North America. Recognizing the relative use 


of the other companies on the list, this award really highlights the successful rebirth of MACOM as a growth 


company.” 





We are not sure which is more troubling – that Deloitte & Touche can’t tell the difference between a fast-


growing company and one that made a big acquisition, or that MTSI management is proudly parading this 


award, almost insulting the intelligence of the investor community in light of its 0.6% organic growth in 


FY2014. 





With the MindSpeed acquisition on the cusp of being lapped, MTSI acquired BinOptics for $223.1 million cash, 


almost one year to the day after MSPD was acquired. BinOptics made lasers primarily for Passive Optical 


Networking (PON), and to a lesser extent for telecom equipment. With test times stretching to over two weeks 


and other production bottlenecks, BinOptics’s incompetent manufacturing skills caused it to miss out on the big 


PON buildout occurring in China. This was a low hanging fruit for MTSI to remedy, although we demonstrate 


later in the report that BinOptics growth under MTSI ownership was less than management comments would 


have implied. Also, the Automotive business was divested in August 2015. We discuss below why we believe 


management misled investors and potentially withheld material information about this business. 





Behind all this smoke and mirrors, we estimate MTSI organic revenue declined again 2.8% in FY2015. The 


difference between an organic decline of 2.8% and reported growth of 24.0% is enormous and any management 


team claiming growth would appear to be either inept or willing to deliberately misrepresent their business.  





Note that in table 6 below, the stub period of F1Q14 MSPD only added $1.3 million in revenue.11 As such, to 


make full year revenue comparable, we are adding $30 million to FY2014, consistent with the $30 - $33 million 


revenue contribution from MSPD in the first three full quarters after the close. We are also subtracting $17.8 


million of revenue from FY2014 to account for the MSPD CPE business that was divested in May 2014, per 


management comments. Finally, we are reducing FY2015 revenue by the $17.4 million impact of change in 


revenue recognition – we discuss this episode in more detail later in the report. Note also that we are already 


including MSPD (with the above adjustments) into the organic business, giving MTSI credit for whatever 


growth that business delivered in FY2015.

E. 2016: MTSI 3.0 – Same Old Hype, Still No Organic Growth.  
 


With the divestiture of the Automotive business creating a 17% revenue hole and the anniversary of the 


BinOptics acquisition approaching, MTSI acquired not one, but two companies in December 2015 – Aeroflex 


Metelics and FiBest – for a combined consideration of $97.1 million. We believe these were hurried acquisitions 


with questionable synergies for the buyer that massively diluted gross margins (30% GM’s, or half of MTSI’s 


60% pro forma gross margin).12 It seems obvious to us that these acquisitions were made for the sole purpose of 


window dressing revenue as clean growth comparisons were finally on the horizon. 





With the 4-year anniversary of the IPO approaching, and having sold another staggering $132.8 million worth of 


shares in the past two years alone, John Ocampo appeared ready to re-spin the story again. MTSI held its second 


Analyst Day in March 2016. This time the growth story rested on three pillars, which were all essentially “on-


the-come.” Each pillar was described as capable of doubling the company’s revenue within 3-5 years. Table 8 


below illustrated the promotional nature of the slides and the story.

The new revenue growth target of “20%+” appeared nonsensical after the dismal organic performance since the 


last Analyst Day when the “2x the market growth” target was given. In light of the seemingly astonishing growth 


prospects outlined by MTSI, we understand why investors and analysts may have believed MTSI was a great 


growth story. We are of course very skeptical that these future growth opportunities will ever materialize and we 


discuss them in greater detail later in this report.

Recapping recent performance, Mr. Croteau’s prepared remarks at the Analyst Day remained as misleading and 


detached from the financial reality as before: 


 
“Our organic product developments have paid off with solid growth from new products, with 70%-plus gross 


margin… Last year, the first of our growth drivers kicked in, optical. Products rooted in the Optomai acquisition 


back in 2011 fueled breakouts in long-haul and now in metro networks. The Mindspeed and BinOptics 


acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 triggered breakouts in passive optical networks or fiber-to-the-home, and fiber

backhaul. This was a major impetus in MACOM being able to deliver 33% compound growth over the past two 


years – that's several times the industry average.” 





“Again, that's what you're going to hear about today – new product market areas where we've established clear 


number one positions and in some cases de facto standards within our industry. That's what's fueling our growth 


today. New high-margin products, most in excess of 70% gross margin where we are the unequivocal leader.”  





“Challenging conventional wisdom, enabling industry leaders, creating shareholder value, does that sound 


unorthodox? Does that sound radical? It's called leadership, bold leadership. This morning when you get the 


opportunity to hear about these realities, not dreams, from some of our industry's finest technologists and 


business leaders – that is our management team – they will talk about real products with real customers, 


servicing real applications and delivering real economic value.” 





His forward-looking growth comments promised more ambitious goals and bold, but still “just around the 


corner,” growth: 


 
“Once entrenched with pre-eminent positions in each of these areas, MACOM will be able to ride the wave of 


multi-decade build-outs for each class of product and technology. That's the recipe for sustaining growth and 


profitability in high-performance analog businesses.” 





“We can always grow by taking share even if the overall market is stagnant in 2016 or beyond”.  





“Looking forward, the third phase of optical growth is just now taking route… The second secular growth driver 


is rooted in materials technology in our traditional RF power space, the move from gallium arsenide and silicon 


LDMOS to a new compound semiconductor material called gallium nitride or GaN for short... Our third and final 


secular growth driver is Active Antennas”. 





“Taken in their entirety and assumingly [batting] about a 1,000, that means we have the juice to grow to close to 


$2 billion in revenue with over 30% compound growth over the next several years.” 





With the headline 33% compound growth “delivered” and 30% “on the come,” MTSI continues its misleading 


growth characterizations, despite organic revenue that was flat or declining in every year since its IPO. The 


purported growth drivers have been recycled from the last Analyst Day two years ago with no progress. 





The combination of the M&A machine and growth hype worked well for MTSI’s Chairman and largest 


shareholder John Ocampo and his management team. John Ocampo sold $190.4 million of shares (25% of his 


pre-IPO holdings), with $86.4 million in 2016 YTD alone (Table 10 below). CEO John Croteau has sold $3.7 


million worth of shares since 2013.  





Note that SEC filings by John Ocampo indicate a 10b5-1 plan was recently initiated13 in April 2016 and CFO 


Bob McMullan initiated a 10b5-1 plan14 in May 2016.

There is a real shareholder expense to covering up the struggling organic business. Since 2013, MTSI has spent 


$548 million on acquisitions, net of divestitures, in addition to diluting shareholders by 18% since the IPO (56.5 


million diluted share count guidance for F3Q16 vs 47.8 million diluted shares in the first quarter post IPO).

II. Exposing MTSI Management’s Accounting & Reporting Shenanigans 
 


A. Revenue Recognition Changes of $17.4 Million Hid Multiple Revenue Shortfalls. 
 


In June 2015 a Barron’s article titled “M/A-COM’s Accounting Issue”15 briefly highlighted MTSI’s revenue 


recognition change that helped the Company avoid missing Wall Street expectations “by a wide margin.” It only 


exposed the tip of the iceberg of disturbingly misleading behavior.  





On its November 18, 2014 earnings call, MTSI guided to F1Q15 revenue of $112 - $115 million, a seemingly 


healthy guide relative to the $112.8 million consensus estimate. MTSI’s guidance as outlined in management’s 


prepared comments and the earnings press release are copied below (emphasis added): 


 
“Moving to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending January 2, 2015, MACOM expects another quarter of 


solid performance with revenue expected to be in the range of $112 million to $115 million. Non-GAAP gross 


margin is expected to be between 51% and 53% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share between $0.33 and 


$0.36 on an anticipated 50 million shares outstanding. Operator, you may now open the call to questions.” 





Table 12: MTSI’s F1Q15 Guidance 


 
Source: MTSI November 18, 2014 8-K 





There was no discussion or even a reference to any revenue recognition change in these comments and the topic 


did not come up in the subsequent Q&A. Management neglected to disclose that the quarter would benefit from 


the recognition of a whopping $15.1 million of deferred revenue16 (full FY2015 was ultimately $17.4 million) 


based on MTSI changing from sell-thru to sell-in for segments of its business that were still using sell-in. This 


was only disclosed many months later in SEC filings:

Table 13: MTSI Revenue Recognition Change Disclosed in F1Q15 8-K (Emphasis Added) 


 
Source: MTSI F1Q15 8-K 





Without the $15.1 million accounting benefit, MTSI’s F1Q15 guidance would have been $96.9 - $99.9 million, 


or 11-14% below consensus. Without the EPS impact of $0.18, as disclosed in the 10-Q (Table 12 above) the 


EPS guidance of $0.33 - $0.36 would have been $0.15 - $0.18, or 45-55% lower than the $0.33 consensus at the 


time.   





When the F1Q15 results were ultimately reported, MTSI made no effort to exclude the material revenue 


recognition impact from is Non-GAAP results, as shown in Table 13 above and Table 14 below:

Between the November 18, 2014 earnings call with the misleading guidance and the next earnings call on 


February 2, 2015, when MTSI was forced to confess to the revenue recognition benefit, MTSI’s share price 


appreciated by 51%. This performance, which was clearly based on misrepresented growth resulted in MTSI 


substantially outperforming the SOXX index, which was up just 4% over the same period. Had MTSI been 


transparent about the huge shortfall in its guidance, we believe the share price would have collapsed. While 


MTSI’s share price was benefiting from this artificial boost, MTSI’s Chairman John Ocampo sold $11.8 million 


worth of shares during this period in trades that were outside of Rule 10b5-1 sales.17 CEO John Croteau sold 


$639 thousand worth of shares under 10b5-1, including $375 thousand under Form 144 – the largest single sale 


he has ever made. This type of misleading reporting, amplified by insider selling at artificial share prices is a 


blatant violation of investor trust, in our view, and quite possibly a violation of SEC insider trading rules18.

________________________________________________________________________20 





To underscore how little MTSI management values investor transparency, we note that even when the $15.1 


million benefit was reported on F1Q15 earnings release, management commentary on the earnings call was 


confusing, in a seeming attempt to confuse analysts and investors.  





First, the CEO’s prepared comments did not even acknowledge the $15.1 million benefit at all: 


 
“Straight to the results. Revenue for the first quarter was $114.9 million, which included $2.1 million of 


contribution from BinOptics during the two-week sub-quarter. Revenue excluding BinOptics would've been near 


the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 53.7% with non-GAAP net income of $18.7 million or 


$0.38 earnings per diluted share.”  





Then, CFO’s comments did not acknowledge the revenue recognition change upfront either… 


 
“Revenue was up $114.9 million, representing a sequential increase of 0.5% compared to the reported revenue of 


$114.3 million in the prior quarter, and an increase of 37.6% compared to $83.5 million in the fiscal first quarter 


of 2014.” 





… but proceeded into a lengthy discussion about a “one-time adjustment” – never really confessing openly that 


the $114.9 million revenue in the quarter included a $15.1 million benefit from revenue recognition. We have 


included the full length of comments on revenue recognition just to illustrate how deeply the one-time benefit 


was buried (emphasis added): 


 
The last action of integrating our recent acquisitions was to harmonize the revenue recognition practices to be 


consistent across the company, as this is standard practice, this change in estimate is being implemented in our 


first fiscal quarter. Certain agreements with distribution customers provided for right to return and price 


protection until such time the company's products are sold by distributors to their customers, and until the quarter 


ended January 2, 2015, for some distributors, we recognized revenue from sales under such agreements when the 


distributor resold the product to its end customer, the sell-through basis of revenue recognition. Over a period of 


eight months and during the first quarter ended 2015, we completed evaluation of our revenue recognition 


methodologies relating to all distributors and concluded that it was more appropriate to recognize revenue on 


sales to distributors at the time of shipment to the distributor, a sell-in basis of revenue recognition. Prior to the 


recent acquisitions, we had concluded that we had insufficient information as well as limited experience in 


estimating the effect of the right of distributors to return product and price protection, and accordingly, use a sell-


through method of revenue recognition. We have recently concluded a study, a three years of distributor-related 


transactions, in addition to our ongoing efforts to standardize our revenue recognition policies, and believe that 


the company now has a sufficient data to reach the conclusion that sales and revenue relating to distributor 


transactions are capable of reasonable estimation. Accordingly, we implemented the sell-in method of accounting 


for sales to distributors.  





We recorded a one-time adjustment during the first quarter ended January 2, 2015 related to this change to 


recognize $17 million and previously deferred revenue to recognize a related inventory cost of $4.4 million and 


to establish a reserve of $4.5 million against distributor sales. And in determining the new reserve amount, we 


noted that distributor payments are due under agreed terms and are not contingent upon resale or any other 


matter other than the passage of time. We have agreements with some distributors and customers from various 


programs including price protection, obsolete inventory, new products, and stock rotation. Sales to these 


distributors and customers, as well as the existence of sales incentive programs are in accordance with the terms 


set forth in written agreements with these distributors and customers. In general, credits allowed under these 


programs are capped based upon individual distributor agreements. We recorded charges associated with these 


programs as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based upon historical activity. Our policy is to use a 12-


month rolling historical experience rate as lower than estimated general reserve percentage in order to estimate 


the necessary allowance to be recorded. As noted in our press release, we refer you to our 10-Q filed to-date. 


Inclusive of the aforementioned change in estimate, network revenue was $53.5 million, aerospace and defense 


was $24.9 million, automotive was $18.3 million and multi-market came in at $18.2 million. 





Shockingly, there was only a brief discussion of this issue in the Q&A portion of the earnings call:
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________21 


“<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Great. And then just one follow-on for Bob. Just on the change in sales recognition, I 


think the Q said $15.1 million over several periods, how much of an impact does that have for you in December? 





<A - Robert McMullan>: So the December impact is $15.1 million and it's a change of an estimate because of the 


way we had to rework and estimate and get some historical trend information to be able to estimate potential 


returns and price adjustments. So that is a onetime change of estimate that goes through the P&L. The net $15 


million disclosed is an amount that includes a portion less the reserve that was on the books, the $17 million is on 


the books at the end of the fiscal 2014 period, and the additional amount to make $15 million is the current period 


addition. This is a onetime event that is no longer applicable. It's a GAAP transition, so all the disclosure around 


individual effect revolves around the necessary change in the required disclosure.” 





First, let’s attempt to reconcile the numbers – MTSI’s CFO was referring to the $17 million of deferred revenue 


at the end of F4Q14 – that was product that had been shipped to distributors and was waiting for sell-thru to be 


recognized as revenue. This deferred revenue number matched disclosures in MTSI FY2014 10-K, even though 


the $17.0 million noted in the “Revenue Recognition” paragraph below (emphasis added) did not match the 


$17.258 million deferred revenue number on the Balance Sheet.19 However, the $4.4 million related inventory 


cost number mentioned in the prepared comments did not match the $4.6 million mentioned in the 10-K 


(emphasis added). 








Second, MTSI CFO still referred to segment revenue “inclusive of the aforementioned change.” If it was only “a 


GAAP transition” as the CFO claims, why was it not excluded from the Non-GAAP results? Note that MTSI’s 


10-Q had extensive footnotes calling out the revenue recognition benefit on total revenue as well as segment 


revenue.20  





Third, MTSI would have generated 68.9% gross margin on the $15.1 million deferred revenue recognized in 


F1Q15, calculated based on the $4.7 million associated inventory cost, implying a 230 bps boost to the quarter’s 


gross margin. Its 10-Q in fact disclosed a 2.1% benefit to F1Q15 gross margin from the revenue recognition 


effect, which, of course, was not mentioned in the earnings call. Without this benefit, Non-GAAP gross margin 


would have been 51.6% vs. the 53.7% reported and 51-53% guided. 





Fourth, MTSI’s benefit from the revenue recognition change in F1Q15 was not a one-time occurrence. As 


disclosed in the F2Q15 10-Q, MTSI in fact saw another $3.7 million benefit from revenue recognition in the 


subsequent quarter: 





Table 15: MTSI’s Deferred Revenue Benefit in F2Q15 (Emphasis Added) 


 
Source: MTSI F2Q15 10-Q 





This $3.7 million revenue benefit was, once again, not mentioned at the time of guidance or during the 


subsequent earnings call discussing F2Q15 results. To again contextualize the impact from the undisclosed
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________22 


benefit, when MTSI guided F2Q15 revenue to the range of $122 - $124 million21, the midpoint of guidance was 


$1 million higher than the consensus estimate of $122 million22. Without the $3.7 million benefit, revenue 


guidance would have been $118.3 - $120.3 million, which would have been $2 - $4 million below consensus. 


Had the revenue recognition benefit been appropriately disclosed in guidance, the resulting shortfall vs. 


consensus would have likely resulted in a significant drop in MTSI’s share price. But this is not what happened. 


Instead, on the heels of its misrepresented guidance, MTSI’s share price reached new all-time-highs, allowing 


Chairman John Ocampo and Summit Partners to unload another $63.9 million worth of shares (not under 10b5-


1) to unsuspecting investors.  





Table 16: MTSI’s Revenue Recognition Benefit in FY2015 (Emphasis Added) 


 
Source: MTSI FY2015 10-K 





To understand why MTSI would have resorted to such misleading tactic, consider the change in tone that 


describes the market environment between the November 2014 earnings call… 


 
“… MACOM expects another quarter of solid performance with revenue expected to be in the range of $112 


million to $115 million.” 
 


… and the February 2015 earnings call: 


 
“During the quarter, similar to our peers, we saw broad-based seasonal softness across many of our end 


markets… Multi-market networks saw a soft demand for our broad base of catalog products. Certain networks 


businesses notably wireless infrastructure were down due to what we believe was our customers' year-end 


inventory management, specifically in Asia. Automotive was also down due to anticipated seasonality with Ford.” 





In the face of deteriorating market conditions and secular declines in its core business, MTSI management 


maintained F1Q15 consensus estimates by including an undisclosed $15.1 million benefit from the revenue 


recognition change, which was also an $0.18 EPS benefit. While business must have been very weak in F1Q15, 


we suspect it was not as weak as to create a $15 million hole, so we believe MTSI could have deliberately 


undershipped to distributors in F1Q15, given the large $15.1 million “windfall” revenue it was getting, and as 


distributors caught up on shipments, this would artificially boost next quarter’s revenue, together with the $3.7 


million more it was getting from deferred revenue recognition. 





The complacency of sellside analysts was mindboggling, but understandable, considering MTSI has raised over 


$230 million in equity and approximately $350 million in debt, completed $772 million in acquisitions and 


divestures while its shareholders John Ocampo and Summit Partners have collectively liquidated $348 million 


worth of shares. This is a total of $1.7 billion in investment banking business! 





The revenue recognition episode illustrates a recurring pattern of management omitting material information in 


investor communications, creating a false appearance of stronger financial results than the underlying business 


delivers. The artificial stock price performance was met by large insider share sales. This type of behavior is 


unacceptable and is worthy of investor disdain and an SEC investigation. 





B. A F1Q16 EPS shortfall was hidden by a $1.7 million alteration in the treatment of Discontinued Operations.   
 


MTSI’s F1Q16 Non-GAAP Net income and headline EPS as reported were $21.8 million and $0.40, 


respectively, which was at the high end of the $0.37 - $0.40 Non-GAAP EPS guidance range. During the quarter, 


after the guidance had been issued, MTSI completed two acquisitions – FiBest and Aeroflex Metelics.
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________23 


In the calculation of headline Non-GAAP Net Income for the quarter, MTSI failed to make two adjustments that 


together overstated Non-GAAP Net Income by $1.7 million, or $0.03 EPS, creating the appearance of an EPS 


beat. However, without the accounting shenanigans, EPS missed the midpoint of guidance and was at the low 


end of the range. We expose both factors in more detail below: 





1) Failure to Exclude $1.2 Million Income from Discontinued Operations; Change from Prior Periods 


MTSI failed to subtract the $1.2 million Income from Discontinued Operations (related to the divested 


Automotive business) from the GAAP Net Income when calculating Non-GAAP Net Income.23 In prior period, 


MTSI management ethically subtracted the Income from Discontinued Operations in the 8-K filed for F4Q15. 


Table 16 below shows the $1.2 million Income from Discontinued Operations as it appears in the GAAP Income 


Statement. Notice that there is a zero entry for the corresponding quarter in the Non-GAAP Net Income 


calculation shown in Table 17B. The $1.2 million difference represented 6% of “true” Non-GAAP Net Income, 


so we believe it is hard to argue it was immaterial. However small the impact was, its treatment was clearly 


altered from the treatment used in prior periods. Further, management’s altered presentation is inconsistent with 


how Non-GAAP Net Income is calculated.

2) Failed to Appropriately Exclude $0.5 Million Net Income from Acquisitions from Headline EPS 


The FiBest and Aeroflex Metelics acquisitions closed on December 9th and December 14th, 2015, respectively, 


and were not included in the F1Q16 guidance provided on November 17, 2015. MTSI’s earnings release 8-K 


disclosed the impact of these acquisitions on the reported F1Q16 quarter as outlined in Table 18 below.  





Table 18: MTSI Impact from Acquired Businesses 


 
Source: MTSI F1Q16 earnings 8-K 





While the quarterly results excluding the acquisitions were discussed on the earnings call, MTSI’s earnings press 


release highlighted the $0.40 headline Non-GAAP EPS number, which included the positive impact of both the 


$1.2 million Income from Discontinued Operations and the $0.5 million FiBest and Metelics Net Income.
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________25 


Table 19: MTSI F1Q16 Reported Headline Non-GAAP Net Income and EPS (Emphasis Added) 


 
Source: MTSI F1Q16 earnings 8-K 





Together, discontinued operations and acquisitions added $1.7 million of net income that was not contemplated 


when management gave its original guidance. Without these benefits, Non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.37, 


as shown in Table 20 below, or at the low end of the guided range. This would have been a material difference 


from the headline EPS of $0.40, which appeared to be at the high end of the range. While the impact in absolute 


dollars may not be large, we would argue that the perception effect of a stock missing EPS, as opposed to 


beating, can be significant.  





Table 20: MTSI Reported vs. Corrected Non-GAAP EPS 


 
Source: MTSI SEC Filings 





Why would MTSI suddenly change its Non-GAAP Net Income calculation method relating to Discontinued 


Operations? Once again, no analyst asked a probing question, and no explanation was offered by management. 


Following the revenue recognition shenanigans, this alteration to previous Non-GAAP presentations is yet 


another demonstration of MTSI management manipulating reported numbers to create the perception that 


business was stronger than it was.  





C. Retroactively Altered F1Q16 Non-GAAP Calculations, Exposing Artificial Boost to Non-GAAP Net Income 
from “Consulting Agreement.”  





After including income from discontinued operations in F1Q16 as described above, MTSI management went 


right back to removing the $1.4 million Income from Discontinued Operations in F2Q16. Incredibly, they 


manufactured a new $1.875 million line item called “Consulting agreement,” which now showed up in both 


F2Q16 and retroactively in F1Q16 Non-GAAP Net Income calculations. In fact, the Non-GAAP Net Income 


calculation for F1Q16 had been retrospectively revised in three major areas, highlighted in Table 20A below, as 


compared to the original Non-GAAP Net Income calculations shown previously in Table 17B:

i) The $1.199 million Income from Discontinued Operations that was omitted in the original F1Q16 
earnings report, was now correctly subtracted from GAAP Net Income. 


ii) Yet a new $1.875 million “Consulting agreement” line item retroactively appeared in F1Q16 Non-
GAAP adjustments to more than compensate for this correction. 


iii) The offset from the alteration of previous accounts was a revision of the “Tax effect of non-GAAP 
adjustments” from -$5.378 million to -$6.054 million to arrive to at the $21.833 million Non-GAAP 


Net Income originally reported.  





Table 20A: MTSI F2Q16 Non-GAAP Income Statement 








 
Source: MTSI F2Q16 earnings 8-K 





But what is this consulting agreement and why is it retrospectively being created? As originally disclosed in 


MTSI 2015 10K (emphasis added):  
 


“…we entered into a Consulting Agreement pursuant to which we may provide Autoliv with certain non-design 


advisory services for a period of two years following the closing of the transaction… We expect that the 


remainder of the consideration to be received from Autoliv, including any amounts related to the consulting 


agreement, will being [sic] accounted for in discontinued operations when the contingencies are finalized and 


the proceeds are realizable over the next several years.” 





Despite the typo in the 10K that speaks to careless presentation, the language is very clear about how the 


amounts from the Consulting Agreement should be treated. Consider also that during the F2Q16 earnings call, 


MTSI CFO noted the following (emphasis added):  


 
“Other income of $1.9 million represents revenue from a consulting contract from our automotive divestment that 


continues through fiscal 2017.” 





This is a serious problem. While MTSI’s 10K disclosure is very clear that the Consulting Agreement must go 


into Discontinued Operations (and thereby be excluded from Non-GAAP Net Income), MTSI clearly includes 


the income from the Consulting Agreement back again into Non-GAAP Net Income through “Other Income” in 


F2Q16 (F1Q16 was retroactively modified). The $1.875 million income from Consulting Agreement is material 


relative to the total reported Non-GAAP Net Income of $21.8 million and $25.7 million in F1Q16 and F2Q16, 


respectively.  





We believe there is sufficient evidence in MTSI’s F1Q16 and F2Q16 Non-GAAP Net Income accounting for the 


SEC and the Board of Directors to investigate MTSI’s Non-GAAP reporting practices. We believe there are
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________27 


blatant violations of SEC Regulation G that govern Non-GAAP reporting as well as MTSI’s own accounting 


policies as disclosed in SEC form 10K. 





D. Misled the Street About the Importance of Automotive and about Organic “Backfilling.”  
 


We believe MTSI management repeatedly misled investors about the reliance on the Automotive business. We 


also believe management may have withheld a huge material adverse development from investors that led to its 


divestment at a seemingly bargain price. 





1) Understated the Contribution of Automotive to Make the Core Look Better 


During the IPO roadshow in March 2012, management focused investors on the 120 new products introduced in 


FY2011 and 120 more coming in FY2012. Additionally, management stressed a rapid ramp of new product 


revenue to $25 million per quarter (from only $5 million two years prior) and its opportunities in wireless 


backhaul with Ericsson and in 40/100 Gigahertz optoelectronics.  





Automotive was described as a “nice cash cow” with mid 20% gross margin and ~15% operating margin. Little 


did anyone suspect that this “cash cow” would grow 33% in FY2012 and 77% in FY2013 (Table 3), while all 


other businesses combined would decline by 7% and 8%, respectively. In fact, up until the divestiture, 


management attempted to downplay the real earnings power of Automotive. For example, on the F3Q15 


earnings call, shortly after the divestiture announcement, MTSI’s CFO unambiguously blessed the “low-30% 


gross margin and low-20% operating margin” assumption: 


 
“<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice job on the quarterly execution. On the 


FORD SYNC business which you're selling to Autoliv, my understanding is that this segment generates sort of 


low-30% gross margins and low-20% operating margins. Is that sort of the right way to think about this business 


as we try to model the core M/A-COM business ex-auto? 





<A - Robert McMullan>: That's correct, Harlan. But as I said, we'll be coming out with some information that 


will guide you very specifically post-close, from the filings with the 8-K to give the right information on the 


business and the new business model going forward. 





<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: But am I in the ballpark? 





<A - Robert McMullan>: Yes, definitely.” 





It was not until subsequent 8-K filings that investors could calculate that the Automotive business had delivered 


a whopping 31.5% operating margin in FY2014 and 30.5% in the first three quarters of FY2015, as shown in 


Table 21 below. These actual results were significantly more profitable than the “~15%” or the “low-20%” 


comments management had previously made.

But why would management consistently understate the growth and profitability of this business? We believe the 


reason was that the Automotive business and its economics were unsustainable. We believe that the Ford 


business was sole sourced until 2015 and management wanted to soften the perception hit when that business 


would start to decline.  





2) Sold Automotive for Cheaply; Was Management Hiding a Material Adverse Development? 


In July 2015 MTSI announced it was selling the Automotive business for $100 million plus a $30 million 


potential earnout. While no valuation multiples were disclosed, subsequent filings allowed analysts to calculate 


that the Automotive business had generated $18.1 million LTM Non-GAAP Net Income. As such, MTSI agreed 


to sell the Automotive business for a 5.5x24 P/E multiple. Even if there was no growth, this would be an 


outrageous transaction. While the growth of Automotive had slowed by 2015, the business still had 1.5% LTM 


revenue growth at the time of the sale, with double-digit y/y growth in the two quarters preceding the sale. It was 


certainly not in decline…yet.  





With Automotive generating 17% of MTSI’s LTM revenue and 22% of Net Income, a major adverse 


development in this business would clearly be above any threshold of materiality for MTSI as a whole. 


Nevertheless, there were no negative developments communicated by management to investors.  





Based on our diligence, we are highly suspicious that the sole-sourced nature of the Ford supply agreement 


would soon be expiring, and MTSI faced increased competition, lower prices, or both. If this scenario is correct, 


then MTSI management failed to disclose this risk to investors, instead choosing to sell the business at a price 


that would reflect a severely challenged business.  





3) Promised to “Backfill” Automotive Organically, but Plugged the Hole With More Acquisitions 


When discussing the Automotive divestiture on its F3Q15 earnings call, MTSI’s CEO noted:  


 
“We believe that the expected growth in our other businesses will backfill the earnings contribution that would 


have otherwise come from automotive within a few quarters following the divestment.” 





“<Q - Mark Lipacis>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, John, I had an issue with my line, so I 


didn't hear this. Could you repeat what you said about what you thought was going to be able to backfill our 


automotive business and timing on that? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Yes. I mean I'll over simplify it and say its lasers and optical, exactly what you had 


predicted and it's 100G as well as access, so... 





<Q - Mark Lipacis>: And how many quarters? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: We don't give forward guidance, but let me just say given the – as mobile infrastructure 


recovers, that was a very substantial headwind. So as that turns around and turns into a tailwind, I think within a 


couple of quarters we could be back to what people had been predicting our EPS to be.” 





Doing exact opposite of what he promised, i.e. backfilling the hole organically with lasers and optical, MTSI 


CEO went on a slapdash shopping spree and spent $97.1 million, almost all of the initial proceeds from the 


Automotive divestiture, to fill the hole by buying two companies with no growth, inferior margins and 


ambiguous synergies. Perhaps most preposterously he declared on the F1Q16 earnings call: 


 
 “I am proud to say that five months following the automotive divestment, we replaced that revenue and EPS 


contribution and repositioned the company with higher quality revenue, faster growth, and stronger earnings 


potential”. 





As Table 22 below illustrates, the majority of revenue backfill between F3Q15 and F2Q16 came from the $18.8

The acquired businesses were disclosed to have gross margin of approximately 30% and as shown in Table 18, 


they combined to generate a $1.2 million gross profit on $4.6 million of revenue in the stub F1Q16 period, for 


gross margin of 27.0%.  





E. Exaggerated BinOptics Growth With Claims to Quadruple Capacity. 
 


On its F4Q14 earnings call on November 18, 2014 MTSI announced the acquisition of BinOptics for $230 


million. The comments below outline MTSI’s expectations of removing capacity constraints BinOptics had 


faced and quadrupling capacity in a year to take advantage of an “open playing field” of opportunities. 


 
“With this move, we anchor our new photonic portfolio with indium phosphide lasers. … As part of MACOM, we 


plan to scale laser production capacity and drive market share gains in what has been a supply constrained part 


of our customers' supply chain.”  





“… we had noticed that they had been taking an inordinate share of reference design wins, as well as customer 


selections and design wins…And then the opportunity came, where they needed to dramatically expand capacity. 


They were VC funded startup by background. So it naturally came a time for a company like MACOM to acquire 


and scale the operational capability of the company and that's what we plan to do.” 





“… they've been capacity constrained. The whole industry has been capacity constrained to the point where 


there's really been supply limitations in the access part of the market, but they also serve as big data centers. So 


high growth potential at the end market level, again, with suppliers that have been fading away. So they've got 


somewhat of an open playing field. To give you the sense of what we plan to do with them, our internal goals, 


what we're working to underpin are you can think about integer multiples increases in capacity. So doubling in 


six months, quadrupling in a year is kind of exponential growth potential. And our sense for the customer 


diligence process is that could all just – the revenue could scale accordingly. So it's a great upside possibility 


even beyond their own internal aspirations.” 





The same message of quadrupling capacity within a year of closing was repeated on subsequent earnings calls: 


 
“... I mean demand is such that our biggest problem frankly right now is harmonizing customer priorities. People 


are coming in, looking for demand and looking to negotiate long-term supply agreements that are in excess, in 


some cases far in excess of our ability to deliver even with the aggressive capacity ramp. So certainly through the 


rest of this year, I would say every laser that we can produce will ship. And doubling in six months and 


quadrupling in 12 months is, you can get a sense of what that would produce... So where I would see the material 


jump in terms of the capacity expansion would actually be our fourth fiscal quarter, to some extent third, but 


especially the fourth and then 2016 off to the races.” 


- MTSI F1Q15 Earnings Call  


 
“We are right on track to meet our two-step goal of doubling unit capacity by the end of June while quadrupling 


unit capacity by the beginning of calendar year 2016.” 


- MTSI F2Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“… we successfully achieved our goal of doubling capacity in Ithaca, New York... Nevertheless, we remain 


capacity constrained to meet laser market demand through fiscal Q4. In parallel, we're still on track to double 


unit capacity yet again in Lowell by the beginning of calendar 2016”.

“I don't want to sound a smug, but if we were to sell every element of capacity we have, it would probably grow 


1,000%. The factory in Lowell is just in order of magnitude larger in equipment capacity than Ithaca. So it's the 


reason why I say – and when we said doubling capacity by the first of the year. Once we're in Lowell, it's 


basically unlimited and which is key because from a unit volume standpoint, data centers could absolutely 


consume a sizable chunk of that, whether it's 10-fold or more or less remains to be seen. But I think so the first 


approximation was the way to think about it is infinite supply for the foreseeable two years” 


- MTSI F4Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“I'm proud to say that we've met our stated goal of doubling yet again laser capacity by January 2016. Our 


Lowell facility is now fully qualified for the first of three high volume runners and serving demand in our most 


cost sensitive PON business.”  


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





With the rhetoric on capacity expansion reaching a fever pitch with discussions of a “10-fold” increase, it is 


helpful to take a look at the actual results achieved by BinOptics, as shown in Table 25 below. Note that we have 


reconstructed BinOptics full quarter revenue numbers based on MTSI’s SEC filings, as shown in Tables 27-31. 





Table 25: BinOptics Pro Forma Full Quarter Revenue 


 
Source: MTSI SEC Filings 





1) BinOptics Revenue Did Not Double Six Months After Closing, Even if Capacity Did 


MTSI management was adamant about doubling BinOptics capacity six months after the close in December and 


being able to ship every laser they could make. However, BinOptics revenue of $20.2 million in June 2015 


quarter increased by 44% compared to the December 2014 full quarter’s revenue of $14.0 million, and only 41% 


relative to the prior peak quarter of $14.3 million. We suspect the volume growth came in part due to the heavy 


price discounts required to win business. While September 2015 quarter’s revenue was up, the growth was still 


just 55% vs. the prior peak quarter – a long way from the 100% capacity growth that MTSI management 


advertised. We believe management’s failure to delineate between capacity and revenue growth was highly 


misleading.   





During the March 2016 Analyst Day, MTSI showed the graph in Table 26 below, portraying laser shipments (not 


just capacity) increasing from just over 2 million in C4Q14 (F1Q15) to 8 million in C4Q15 (F1Q16), almost a 4x 


increase. From the Table 25 above we see that BinOptics revenue did not even double during this period, which 


does not reconcile with the near 4x increase in laser shipments during the same period.  





The delta between shipments and revenue can be explained by either fudged numbers, or more likely, a collapse 


in pricing. A careful review of MTSI’s financial filings does not offer up specifics on price declines, making 


their promotional commentary on “growth” highly misleading.

2) “Material Jump” in F4Q15 Did Not Materialize – BinOptics Growth is Stalling 


As quoted above, MTSI expected a “material jump” in capacity in F4Q15 and then 2016 to be “off to the races.” 


Instead, BinOptics posted just 10% q/q revenue growth in F4Q15, followed by 8% q/q growth in F1Q16. While 


still strong growth, the revenue growth diverged materially from the capacity growth as implied by MTSI 


management on its F1Q15 earnings call. While capacity may be expanding “exponentially” starting in January 


2016 to become “basically unlimited,” anyone paying attention to management’s comments would have noticed 


that revenue growth at BinOptics is not tracking capacity growth. The reasons are problematic. First, the PON 


market is rolling over. Second, the 100G product ramp will be slow as customers need to “walk before they run” 


(both of these topics are discussed later in more detail). If BinOptics revenue continues to increase at the pace of 


$2 million per quarter, consistent with the past two quarters, then C1H2016 revenue will increase by 45% y/y 


and 17% h/h. This is good, but not even close to the growth implied by management’s prior comments of 


quadrupling the capacity.

F. Grossly Exaggerated Organic Growth on F2Q16 Earnings Call.  
 


On its F2Q16 earnings call MTSI was asked what organic revenue growth was q/q in the December quarter. The 


answer was unambiguously up double digits (emphasis added): 


 
“<Q - Dave Kang>: Right. Actually the question was, what was the organic growth excluding that acquisition in 


the December quarter sequentially? Is it up about – still double-digits or...? 





<A - Robert McMullan>: Close to double-digits. 





<Q - Dave Kang>: Okay. 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Close to double-digits. One thing that I'll point out that's problematic is we don't have an 


apples-to-apples situation there. We described last quarter, so FiBest was a customer of ours. So that will be 


coming into as a business unit. The revenue is not incremental because if we lose the revenue claim into and it 


becomes – it shows up as products improvement, so it's impossible to do an apples-to-apples mathematical 


addition. Sorry, off the top of my head I can't answer the question, but I can guarantee you it's double-digit 


organic growth.”
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________34 


At the risk of picking on analysts, it is disappointing that there would be questions about organic growth in the 


December quarter, when the 10-Q had already been published and allowed for those figures to be calculated. 


Looking at the subsequent 10-Q filing once again reveals a large discrepancy of what MTSI management 


claimed and what the actual number was – in this case December quarter was down 1.2% q/q and March quarter 


was up only 3.2% q/q on organic basis, as shown in Table 31A below.  





Table 31A: MTSI Organic Revenue Growth 


 
Source: MTSI F1Q16 and F2Q16 10-Q filings 





Once again, MTSI management was throwing around big numbers with no regard for accuracy. Until now, 


neither sellside analysts nor investors have used basic math and company disclosures to throw cold water on 


management’s nonsensical growth claims.  





($ MM, FYE September) F4Q15A F1Q16A Q/Q (%) F2Q16A Q/Q (%)


Total MTSI Reported Revenues $112.6 $115.8 2.9% $133.6 15.4%


Subtract: FiBest Contribution $2.7 $8.4


Subtract: Metelics Contribution $1.9 $10.3


MTSI Organic Revenues $112.6 $111.2 -1.2% $114.8 3.2%


Neither one is even CLOSE to double-digits!!!

III. An Objective Perspective on MTSI’s “Growth Opportunities” That Never Seem to Materialize 
 


Technology investors salivate over stories of big dollar content in products that are at the cusp of parabolic 


growth. Investors with at least a decade of technology investing experience understand that the economics of the 


technology sector are generally much harsher than the get-rich-quick opportunities often found in PowerPoints. 


Further, for the few companies that do take market share in new growth vectors, industry evolution often takes 


longer than most investors are willing to wait. 





We believe MTSI has been promoting “growth opportunities” that are textbook examples of pie-in-the-sky 


addressable markets that will never materialize. Below, we share the sobering analysis on each of MTSI’s 


“growth opportunities,” focusing on tangible progress and the logical path to ramp volume.  





A. GaN – Nothing More than an R&D Project with Highly Uncertain Prospects in the Distant Future.  
 


MTSI first mentioned GaN products as early as 2012 and made it an “official” growth opportunity at the May 


2014 Analyst Day. The goal was targeting 80% penetration in the $2.5 billion market.  





What is GaN?  


Gallium Nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor material used for manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs). While 


silicon (Si) is the most commonly used material for IC manufacturing, some wireless and high speed wireline 


applications use “III-V” type compound materials, which are combinations of metallic elements from column III 


of the periodic table and nonmetallic elements from column V. These compound materials include GaN, as well 


as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Indium Phosphide (InP) and others. They compound materials typically offer 


higher performance than silicon, but come at a higher cost.  





Is GaN Going to Replace LDMOS? 


GaN’s higher power output makes it a good candidate, at least in theory, for power amplifier devices used in 


high power applications such as wireless basestations. GaN’s main disadvantage is cost due to the specialized 


fabrication process requirements needed to grow GaN crystal on a wafer. Lower yield rates and smaller 


production scale also drive up costs. The incumbent technology in basestation power amplifier devices is 


LDMOS – Lateral Double-diffused Metal-Oxide Semiconductor – a special variety of silicon MOSFET (Metal-


Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor).  





There are currently two main flavors of GaN – GaN-on-Silicon promoted primarily by MTSI and GaN-on-


Silicon-Carbide (GaN-on-SiC) developed by Qorvo (QRVO). MTSI describes its “MACOM GaN” as having 


performance advantages of GaN at silicon-based LDMOS cost structure, as shown in Table 32 below: 





Table 32: MTSI’s Claimed Advantages of GaN-on-Si

Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________36 


To be fair to the competition, we also present QRVO’s claims of GaN-on-SiC being superior to GaN-on-Si in 


Table 33 below: 





Table 33: QRVO’s Claimed Advantages of GaN-on-SiC 


 
Source: http://www.qorvo.com/gan 





Also, let’s not completely discount LDMOS, as that technology has beaten the higher performance GaAs in the 


past, killing some of the growth aspirations of GaAs suppliers (Table 34):  





Table 34: LDMOS Overview (Emphasis Added) 





 
Source: http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/ldmos 





As noted above, alternatives to LDMOS become interesting when frequencies increase above 2.5 GHz. This is 


also MTSI’s argument for expecting future bands > 2.6 GHz to be “All GaN” with “No LDMOS play” as shown 


in Table 35.

But does this all-out transition to GaN make sense and what needs to happen for it to materialize? Will cellular 


frequencies shift to >2.6 GHz? We need to go a level deeper into the underlying technologies to expose the truth. 





1) A Basic Understanding of Radio Frequencies and Bands.  
“Frequency” measures how many times a radio wave completes a full “up and down” movement in one second 


(Table 36). For example, 700 MHz means 700 million cycles per second. Generally radio waves with lower 


frequency travel farther and are better at penetrating thru objects such as building walls. Higher frequency radio 


waves can transmit more data per second by virtue of having more oscillations per second, but they travel shorter 


distances, making it more expensive for a carrier to provide full coverage in a given area. Frequency “bands” 


group frequencies within a certain range. For example the 700 MHz band includes radio waves with 698 – 806 


MHz frequency. 





Table 36: Radio Frequencies 





 
Source: http://www.smartmetereducationnetwork.com; www.howstuffworks.com   





2) Clarifying the Confusion between Frequency Bands and Cellular Standards.  


Cellular standards refer to the techniques used to send and receive data over radio waves. The second generation 


standard is called 2G, while 3G and 4G are the third and fourth generations, respectively. Each generation 


increases the amount of data that can be transmitted by making better use of available radio waves. Higher 


generations, such as 4G, have tended to use higher frequency bands, such as 2.6 GHz. But it is important to note 


that higher generations don’t have to use higher frequency bands - they can and do use lower frequency bands 


where available, as shown in Table 37 below. The problem has been that frequency bands such as 700 MHz are 


“prime property” in limited supply and carriers have been forced to use higher frequency bands over time. We 


want to clear a possible misperception here – carriers do not need to move to higher frequencies (i.e. > 2.6 GHz), 


just because they move to the next generation of cellular standards, such as 5G.

________________________________________________________________________38 





Table 37: Cellular Standards Usage of Frequency Bands 


 
Source: Wikipedia 





So far LDMOS power amplifiers and frequency bands up to 2.6 GHz have sufficient performance for a 


widespread rollout of 4G worldwide. Rollout of 5G at some point in the (distant) future does not itself 


necessitate the use of higher frequency bands. The real reason for carriers to use higher frequency bands is to 


improve the data throughput capabilities of their networks.  





3) Do Higher Frequency Bands Even Make Economic Sense for Carriers?  


A major business issue for populating an area with short-reach, high-frequency antennas is real estate as it will 


likely require carriers to have many more basestation locations than they have with current longer-reach, lower 


frequency antennas. Real estate for basestations is in limited supply, and adding them is costly and cumbersome 


given the environmental permitting process. 





4) Limitations of and Alternatives to Higher Frequency Bands. 


From a technology point of view, high frequency bands have a problem with loss of signal25 when there is no 


line of sight between the transmitter and receiver (e.g. basestation antenna and mobile handset). This is a 


particularly challenging issue inside buildings and in urban environments. 





One relatively obvious alternative to moving to higher frequencies is doing “carrier aggregation” or “channel 


aggregation” on current frequencies. This encompasses the process of aggregating several contagious or non-


contagious channels as small as 10 MHz to create bigger, usable frequency bands. Mobile operators, handset 


makers and semiconductor makers are working actively on implementing carrier aggregation and we expect it 


will continue to add available spectrum.  





Another alternative for cellular network operators is using WiFi access points to complement their cellular 


networks as China Mobile has done, for example, with 6 million access points.26 Higher frequency bands also 


have shorter effective range, so the coverage characteristics start to approximate those of WiFi, which has lower 


cost and broader availability due to its ubiquity and readily available supplier base. 





One more alternative to higher frequencies is ironically moving to lower frequencies. In October 2015, the FCC 


announced it would allow TV stations to auction off their 600 MHz frequency spectrum rights27 and the auctions 


have kicked off already. These frequencies are just below the 700 MHz band, which is the lowest band used by 


US mobile operators. Note that lower frequencies are much more desirable than higher frequencies as they travel 


further and better penetrate obstacles. 





There are other, more ambitious alternatives, such as creating cloud-based networks and radio-access-network-


as-a-service (RANaaS).28 High frequency bands are clearly not the only way forward and not nearly as inevitable 


as MTSI suggests.  





With the 5G wireless standard itself still being developed, it is far too early to know what technologies may or 


may not be better suited for 5G. One thing is certain, it will take time, likely years, before we come close to 


finding out. Each generation of wireless standards takes approximately 10 years to come out – 1G in 1982, 2G in
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________39 


1992, 3G in 2001 and 4G in 201229. Industry participants appear to be targeting 5G around 2020,30 which would 


be consistent with historical cadence. A rollout in the early 2020’s would be at least five years away from now!  





4) We are Very Early in the Process of Higher Frequency Bands Even Being Available for Use.  


In October 2015, the FCC adopted a proposal to make some high frequency, millimeterwave (mmW) bands (28 


GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz) available for mobile communication services. 31  The FCC then invited public 


comments on this proposal and documents filed by industry participants have revealed a strong opposition to this 


proposal by the Satellite Industry Association (FCC Docket 14-177)32.  





So far these bands have not been licensed for mobile communications use because of their unsuitability from 


propagation losses and failure to propagate around obstacles. The FCC report cited possible technologies to use 


beam-forming and work done by Samsung to capture signals reflected from obstacles, such as buildings. These 


developments could help overcome the propagation losses and line-of-sight limitations of higher frequencies. 


However, the FCC report also noted the following (emphasis added): 








So back to the initial question: Will GaN displace LDMOS? Consider the following: 





i) In order for that to happen, mobile operators need to move to higher frequency bands (>2.6 GHz), 
despite the serious technical limitations and economic disadvantages when compared to the other 


alternatives such as WiFi, carrier aggregation, etc.  


ii) There is no reason for mobile operators to switch out LDMOS in 4G basestations for current 
frequencies <2.6 GHz. The existing technology is mature and cost optimized. Any new hardware needs 


to be qualified in the labs and in the network, which creates extra work with no incentive, especially if 


GaN costs are the same as LDMOS and current frequencies don’t make proper use GaN’s theoretical 


advantages. 


iii) These higher frequency millimeterwave bands are not even licensed yet for cellular usage. The FCC is 
exploring the idea of licensing them and we do not yet know if and when the FCC will allow it.  


iv) Technology companies are doing development to try and overcome the technological limitations of 
millimeterwave bands, such as signal loss or line-of-sight requirement. There is still a lot of work to do, 


but there is not yet pervasive evidence that their efforts will ever work.  


v) The 4G basestation deployment cycle is approaching maturity in developed countries and the next 
major deployment wave is unlikely until 5G. It is hard to ramp GaN units when basestation shipments 


are nonexistent. 


vi) As mobile operators transition to 5G, they transition out of prior generations. This opens up frequencies 
to be used for 5G, so technology transitions themselves do not necessitate adoption of new bands. 


vii) 5G itself is still in development and we don’t know yet if it will use higher frequencies or not. It will 
likely take years before technology choices are narrowed down. Even if 5G sees mainstream 


deployment, it will likely be at least five years from now.  





So it is theoretically possible GaN could eventually replace LDMOS, but it looks very unlikely, considering the 


limitations listed above, and it will be years before we will know. Also, even if GaN succeeds, it is not a given 


that MTSI’s flavor of GaN-on-Si will prevail competing with QRVO’s GaN-on-SiC, further reducing the 


opportunity available to MTSI. 





Based on our analysis, the GaN opportunity is very far from the “just around the corner,” almost “inevitable” 


promote MTSI management has used. Just in case it is not yet obvious, we discuss GaN in more detail below.  





How Has MTSI Promoted the GaN “Story?” What Has Been Accomplished? What Are The Prospects?  


MTSI has discussed GaN for years. Its IPO prospectus listed GaN along with other compound semiconductors:
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________40 


 
“While we use silicon for some applications, we also often use compound semiconductor technologies such as 


GaAs, indium phosphide (InP) or gallium nitride (GaN) to deliver reliable operation at higher power, higher 


frequency or smaller form factor than a silicon solution would allow.” 





On the May 2012 earnings call, MTSI’s CEO noted a seemingly major contract signed for GaN smart pellets: 


 
“As an example of our success in the defense market, we recently signed a contract with a customer for the 


development of a gallium nitride smart pallet to be used in a mortar locating radar platform. Our innovating 


smart pallet approach optimizes performance, reliability and cost for the customer by combining multiple 


technologies and integrated circuits into a single compact module. We believe successful execution of 20 


prototype units later this year will result in full rate production volumes in 2014.” 





While the GaN products and “GaN strategy” continued to be a focus of subsequent earnings calls, the rhetoric 


stepped up meaningfully after MTSI bought GaN company Nitronex from its Chairman and majority owner 


Ocampo in February 2014. At its May 2014 Analyst Day, MTSI set a target of replacing LDMOS with GaN and 


capturing 80% share of the $2.5 billion addressable market. The implied opportunity for MTSI was $2 billion!  


 
“This morning, you're going to hear … how we are a leader in active antenna arrays for military and civil radar, 


100G optical and millimeterwave datalinks for defense, as well as commercial networks. And finally how we're 


driving a major technology transition from gallium arsenide in LDMOS technology to gallium nitride, a move 


that will disrupt almost every one of these application categories shown here on this slide.” 





“GaN is the next LDMOS. It's going to supersede that as the technology of choice. And MACOM is investing. 


They are the leaders in it, and that gap gets wider every day. GaN is at the very beginning of its penetration and 


adoption cycle.. GaN today has penetrated less than 6% of the estimated $2.5 billion high-performance RF 


market. It is truly at the early stages of adoption. We believe that GaN, over the next decade or so, will consume 


more than 80% of the high-performance RF market.” 





“… we will revolutionize GaN cost structure by moving to a silicon paradigm. GaN on Silicon allows us to exploit 


large diameter, high-volume, silicon fabrication facilities whose economics are driven by other markets with 


orders of magnitude greater size... MACOM is driving at least 100X reduction in the manufacturing cost of GaN 


compared to today. We know what we are paying today. We know what the costs will be in the future. It is utterly 


more than 100 times lower cost. This is driving both margin expansion and market adoption.” 





Table 38: GaN as a Disruptive Technology According to MTSI

Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________41 


On the F1Q15 earnings call in February 2015, nine months after the 2014 Analyst Day, MTSI updated investors 


on the status of GaN activities, setting a target for “material impact beginning in 2016”: 


 
“… behind the scenes, we made great strides in realizing the vision of our GaN strategy. As we described at our 


Analyst Day last May, we believe that GaN will ultimately disrupt as much as 80% of our target markets. We've 


assumed the leadership position in driving the GaN technology transition with the goal of enabling step function 


increases in market share. We're in the process of finalizing supply agreements with manufacturing partners that 


we believe will meet the demanding supply chain requirements for our various target markets. We believe these 


agreements will unlock the requisite cost structure, capacity, and scalability to displace incumbent, silicon, and 


gallium arsenide technologies with material impact beginning in 2016.”  





The F2Q15 earnings call contained an equally optimistic outlook for GaN and continued to be a focus of analyst 


attention, as 7 out of the 22 questions asked by analysts focused on GaN. MTSI set the target of qualifying GaN 


products during 2015 and starting volume production for basestation customers in 2016 (emphasis added): 


 
“… we've been working to realize the full potential of our GaN strategy. We're a year into transferring process 


modules with two high volume manufacturing partners that are currently running qualification wafers in parallel 


in two target production lines. During the remainder of 2015, we expect to qualify the process and the initial 


products with the goal of volume production in 2016. Our manufacturing partners were chosen based upon their 


manufacturing scale and cost structure and ability to service the most challenging customers and applications, 


notably 4G LTE base stations.” 





Subsequent earnings calls only reiterated that the GaN strategy was “on track,” even though somehow 2015 went 


by and the qualification was never announced. 
 


“<Q - Mark Lipacis>: Great. If I could just sneak one more in on GaN on silicon. Where are you in the process 


of qualifying your foundries?  





<A - John R. Croteau>: Sure. So we remain on track. We continue to progress with our qualifications of our 


production foundries.” 


- MTSI F3Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“We remain on track with our process qualification and customer adoption timeline leading to mainstream GaN 


adoption in 4G/LTE base stations in 2016.”  


- MTSI F4Q15 Earnings Call 


 
 “Now let me touch briefly on our GaN program status. Last quarter, we described our new base station team 


delivered complete production worthy reference designs and convinced the premier base station OEMs that our 


GaN on silicon was ready for prime time. Those engagements have since progressed to commercial discussions 


with a broad scope of program opportunities now open to us at three major base station OEMs... Absolutely zero 


change in the last quarter in terms of the outlook for both the GaN program and the Active Antenna programs.”  


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





At the March 2016 Analyst Day, MTSI reinforced the growth story that had been communicated over the prior 


two earnings calls – that GaN, Active Antennas and Optical were the three growth areas that could each double 


MTSI in 3 – 5 years. While no GaN revenue number was given, the chart in Table 39 can be used to conclude 


that the actual contribution is still minimal, i.e. there has been no meaningful revenue generated despite all the 


hype of the prior four years!

While MTSI didn’t reiterate the prior target of 80% share of a $2.5 billion market, they spoke about a 60% target 


market share, with even a 40% share yielding $400 million revenue: 


 
“<Q - Harsh V. Kumar>: Do you guys have any goals that you could share publicly, what your GaN on silicon 


RF marketplace could be in the base station, what your share could be on revenue or growth or anything like 


that? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Yeah ... If you look at the customer behavior, it's a customer concentration, supplier 


concentration… They typically have one primary supplier, one secondary supplier, and in some cases, like 


Ericsson maybe a tertiary supplier, like that's where Infineon tends to play. If you're not shooting for 60%, you're 


not playing in the game. In fact they don't even want to talk to you, if you're not capable of servicing 60% of their 


demand. They're searching right now for that next supplier or the next two suppliers to be the next generation of 


those RF power guys. And it's not going to be three guys or four guys or five guys. It's going to be two guys. And 


our plan is to be one of those two and the guy with 60% rather than 40%. If you take 40% of that market, that's a 


$400 million business, nearly doubling the size of our company. So that's the reason why we say, we're in a very 


good position that even in downside scenarios, it's a transformative effect on MACOM. But we're in a great 


position, I just – we're jumping at the bid being able to talk about exactly, which customers, which program – real 


programs being discussed. We have very tangible benefits that are now demonstrated.” 





Digging into the details, management disclosed that the qualification of GaN parts for basestations had been 


pushed out from 2015 to mid-summer 2016 but somehow the target for “material revenue” remained in CY2016 


(emphasis added): 


 
“We remain on track to complete process qualification by mid-summer 2016, with a series of Gen-4 product 


qualifications completing shortly thereafter. And we expect to have wafers coming from the fab to support product 


ramps at that time.”  





“Now, the comment that I also made in my … was it's very hard to tell the slope and the velocity of this thing, 


because we have to pass through the quals that Robert mentioned, assuming they will go great. The customer 


then has to put the product at the service provider's hands, who then has to do the field file and then do the ramps. 


Now, given the experience and I've been in this industry for a while, I think we're looking at the end of the 


calendar year, with all the assumptions that I gave you earlier for it to be material for in terms of revenue.” 





Still No Meaningful 


GaN Revenue

As of March 2016, MTSI expected to qualify the GaN parts in “mid-summer” (with Gen 4 parts qualifying even 


later), but ship product for “meaningful revenue” before the end of this calendar year. This is extremely 


aggressive, if not unheard of, in the technology equipment industry, especially with a solution as complex and 


critical as basestations. Power amplifiers are not a peripheral device. Instead, they sit at a critical point in the 


signal chain and their performance can make or break a basestation’s ability to provide reliable coverage. Even if 


basestation manufacturers do not need several months to test these devices, and instead design them into their 


equipment immediately, they still need to qualify the entire basestation systems with mobile network operators – 


first in their labs, then in the field. This takes many months. The entire process from sampling a chip to field 


deployment is typically measured in years. But MTSI planned to get to it within a few months.  





Just over a month after its Analyst Day, MTSI’s CEO repeated the pattern of confirming that MTSI is “100% on 


track” in GaN on its April 2016 earnings call. However, Mr. Croteau opened the door to the possibility that the 


meaningful ramp would slip out of calendar 2016 and into 2017 (emphasis added): 


 
“Moving to GaN, we continue to execute on our GaN vision and are 100% on track with process qualification as 


articulated at Analyst Day. Our confidence grows daily.”  





“<Q - C.J. Muse>: … going back to earlier questions around GaN on silicon ,you talked about meeting that 


process qual. But curious, once that comes in, what would the timing look like for first revenue there? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: So the difficult thing to predict is, when we deliver on these May deliverables, exactly 


when the deployments happen and when the customers – there's scenarios where they come in very rapidly and 


there's scenarios where they delay a quarter or so. So I'd put it this way, I mean, our position hasn't changed. 


There are scenarios where this calendar year we have initial production ramps. There are also scenarios where 


those same programs delay into the first or second quarter next year”. 





A few weeks later, at Jefferies TMT Conference on May 12th, the rhetoric on GaN timing continued to 


emphasize the possibility of slippage into calendar 2017 (emphasis added): 


 
“On GaN, we have customer programs. We are executing too that had production targeted for fourth calendar 


quarter. I'm always cautious when I say these things, because these are the things the customers are always 


destined to slip. So I don't want people to count on these things, but that is the customers own schedule, even if it 


slips, it slips into the first quarter of 2017. I would say, given more customers are committing to us now and 


talking about in terms of the aggressive transitions to GaN, 2017 is absolutely the knee of the curve, zero 


ambiguity something will have to go really south for that not to happen now.” 





To summarize out view on MTSI’s “GaN Story,” we are convinced it is nothing more than an R&D initiative 


that belongs somewhere in the back of the investor slide deck as an initiative being pursued with many

uncertainties and risks. To describe it as an immediate and transformational opportunity that can double MTSI in 


3-5 years, as MTSI has been doing, is misleading and irresponsible and should lead to repeated disappointments 


in the quarters and years to come. 





An added wrinkle on the purported GaN opportunity is the patent lawsuit that MTSI filed against International 


Rectifier (acquired by Infineon in 2015) in April 2016. As described in MTSI F2Q16 10-Q, “If successful, the 


relief sought would, among other remedies, require International Rectifier and Infineon to assign back to 


MACOM certain GaN-related Nitronex patents that were previously assigned to International Rectifier.” This 


suggests that there are holes in MTSI’s GaN IP portfolio and MTSI may have inadvertently given away IP that 


they are now trying to reclaim to avoid Infineon suing MTSI and killing MTSI’s GaN story in its tracks. Recall 


that in September 2013 MTSI paid $7.25 million to GigOptix (GIG) to settle a lawsuit filed against MTSI in 


April 2011.  





B. Active Antennas – A Pie-in-the-Stratosphere. 
 


MTSI needed a growth story for its Aerospace & Defense (A&D) segment desperately, which had been 


shrinking at a 4.6% CAGR over the past four fiscal years (adjusted for the revenue recognition benefit in 


FY2015). The rate of decline accelerated each year to double-digits in FY2015 (Table 41). 





Table 41: MTSI Aerospace & Defense Revenue 


 
Source: MTSI SEC Filings 





The growth challenges were not confined to one end market, but instead legacy programs, satellite, and public 


safety were all among the reasons listed in MTSI’s 10-Ks for the declines in A&D revenue (Table 42). 





Table 42: MTSI 10-K Comments Explaining Declines in A&D Revenue (Emphasis Added) 


“In fiscal year 2015, our A&D market revenue decreased by $4.3 million, or 4.9%, compared to fiscal year 2014. We 


attribute this decrease to lower demand and shipments of certain legacy radar programs as well as cyclical demand 


for radar applications.” 





“In fiscal year 2014, our A&D market revenue decreased by $3.8 million, or 4.1%, compared to fiscal year 2013. We 


attribute this decrease to ramp down of certain legacy radar programs as well as cyclical demand for radar 


applications.” 





“In fiscal year 2013, our A&D market revenue decreased by $4.8 million compared to fiscal year 2012. This 


decrease was due to decreased revenue from sales of our products for satellite communications applications and 


for tactical and public safety radios.” 





“In fiscal year 2012, our A&D market revenue increased by $0.8 million compared to fiscal year 2011. We attribute 


this growth to increased demand for satellite datalink products, partially offset by weaker demand for radar 


applications and weaker overall market demand for tactical and public safety radios in fiscal year 2012.” 
Source: MTSI SEC Filings 





While MTSI has spoken about radars in general since IPO, Active Antennas started to be promoted as a major 


growth driver during its 2014 Analyst Day (emphasis added): 


 
“Within a particular end-market you will periodically see product and technology transitions that present 


opportunities for new players to displace the incumbents and drive major shifts in market share. For instance, the 


transition from mechanically scanned to active antennas for radar and satellite communications or the move

What is an Active Antenna? 


Radars have traditionally utilized Passive Electronically Scanned Arrays (PESAs) whereby the antenna is moved 


around mechanically to scan for objects. Active Antennas, also known as Active Electronically Scanned Arrays 


(AESAs) are different because they are constructed from a large number of small modules, which enables them 


to send beams in multiple directions at the same time and scan a space without mechanical movement. The main 


disadvantage of Active Antennas is they come with higher costs. 





What Does MTSI Offer in Active Antennas? 


MTSI’s main offering for Active Antennas is a building block, sub-assembly in the form of tiles that they have 


branded SPARTM (Scalable Planar ARray) Tiles. These tiles were featured in the May 2014 Analyst Day (back 


then called MPAR Sub-Assembly) and have been a staple of MTSI’s investor presentations ever since.  





Table 43: MTSI SPARTM Tiles

Source: MTSI May 2014 Analyst Day; February 2016 Investor Presentation 





What does MTSI Claim the Near-Term Opportunity is for Active Antennas and How Have They Done? 


At the 2014 Analyst Day, MTSI outlined a big growth opportunity in Active Antennas. Management called out 


an 11% CAGR expectation for market growth, a $300 million opportunity in upgrading the F-16 fighter plane 


platform, and several mysterious opportunities. Combined the opportunity MTSI wanted investors to focus on 


was a massive “$1.5 billion a year.” 


 
“MACOM is driving the economics through our technology breakthroughs, making active antenna arrays 


economically feasible. So whether it's the Joint Strike Fighter platform or the F-16 upgrades underway in the air 


domain or the three-dealer program for ground-based radars, MACOM is well-positioned with our solutions to 


support some of the highest volume platforms…” 





“As we've seen, transition to AESA is the dominant secular trend in radar with a CAGR of over 11% as you 


already heard from Suja. This is nearly triple the growth rate of the general semiconductor market, but the real 


take-away here is that we expect to grow even faster than that as we take share… By moving to this technology, 


the mechanical gimbal is eliminated due to the active electronic scanning in the system. There are now thousands 


or even tens of thousands of transmit/receive change in the system and this clearly increases the RF content of 


each system compared to the older radar technology, which is a major growth driver for us.” 





“Out through the end of the decade, the value of the increased RF electronic content driven by this new radar 


technology reaches nearly $1.5 billion a year. And this is dominated by aircraft simply due to the sheer numbers 


of units involved.” 





“The F-16 platform alone represents nearly $300 million in GaAs MMICs over the next several years, calculated 


at about $80,000 of electronic content per plane across just under 4000 aircraft worldwide. This $300 million 


does not include other aircraft such as the F-15, F-22, F/A-18 or F-35, which you may know as a Joint Strike 


Fighter, nor does it include battlefield or weather or air traffic control radars. As you can see, AESA radar is not

________________________________________________________________________46 


only the dominant secular trend in radar. It's a fabulous business opportunity for MACOM, and a growth engine 


for us due primarily to the increased RF content as compared to prior radar deployments.” 


- MTSI Analyst Day, May 2014 





Table 44: MTSI Forecast for AESA 


 
Source: MTSI 2014 Analyst Day Presentation 





Yet, looking at the actual performance two years later, once again reveals many of the opportunities never 


materialized. The status of the F-16 program, more than two years later, is still “just around the corner”: 


 
“<Q - Harlan Sur>: Okay. Thank you. And then on maybe a separate but a related note, maybe John, you can 


give us an update on the SABR program, the F-16 fighter jet upgrade program, and where we are in that upgrade 


cycle? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Yeah. Actually Jack referred to it, not by name, you got to be careful using the program 


names. We are in production, we have our award, we did the initial shipments and now beginning in this summer, 


so either our third or fourth fiscal quarter, we will be in a sustained production on that program. So that's turning 


on. And that's actually just the first of many programs within that customer and other customers, and not just 


airborne, but moving into the ground based as well. So the MMIC business alone is set to drive significant 


growth. Great question.” 


 - MTSI Analyst Day, March 2016 
 


“<Q - Harlan Sur>: … And then on the A&D front, it came in flattish as expected in March. Wondering if the the 


SABR, you know, F-16 program upgrades start to drive some growth in the second half of this calendar year. 





<A - John R. Croteau>:Yeah. So the answer to the latter part of the question is, yes. Second half of the calendar 


year is exactly when the MMIC programs turn back and sustain production.” 


- MTSI F2Q16 Earnings Call 





Despite the optimistic growth prospects for Active Antennas in May 2014, as of the March 2016 Analyst day, it 


appears the actual contribution to MTSI was essentially zero (Table 45 below).
Cold Shower Analytics

Table 45: MTSI Outlook for Active Antennas 


  
Source: MTSI 2016 Analyst Day Presentation 





What is MTSI’s Biggest Active Antenna Opportunity and How Realistic is it? 


MTSI claims the biggest opportunity in Active Antennas is MPAR, which was first discussed in detail in 2014: 


 
“The US government operates eight unique types of radars that provide weather and aircraft surveillance for 


public weather services, air traffic control, and homeland defense. Because each radar type is dedicated to a 


single mission, there is a significant amount of overlapping coverage between them. By replacing all the networks 


with a single network of Multifunction Phased Array Radars, or what we call MPARS, it's possible to reduce the 


total number of radars required by approximately one-third… MACOM has designed and produced MPAR 


systems that even our customers are not yet able to produce themselves.” 


- MTSI Analyst Day, May 2014 





As illustrated in the following Q&A, as of the F1Q15 earnings call, MTSI was very explicit about their 


expectation of generating revenue from MPAR and AESA in F3Q15 or F4Q15 (emphasis added): 


 
“<Q - Quinn Bolton>: Appreciate the detail… And then just lastly on the radar business, at Analyst Day, you 


talked about a lot of the active radar programs that are sort of off in the future. Can you give us some sense of 


those? Do you think you see revenue kicking in this fiscal year, or is the MPAR and AESA radar, really more 


of fiscal 2016 revenue driver? Thank you. 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Sure. Let me address the second part of the question first, while it's not a tough one, 


right. So the MPAR program and derivatives thereof is moving from the advanced development phases with, that 


we did in conjunction with MIT Lincoln Labs into commercial deployments for both defense as well as civil use. 


These are real programs that customers are actively bidding and the government is awarding. So we are going to 


see material revenue from those in the form of early production orders, and additional field trials in our third 


fiscal quarter and fourth fiscal quarter of this year. That's already cooked into of our growth plan. Perhaps it's 


early as the fourth fiscal quarter, but absolutely 2016, that will turn an additional inflection point than our growth 


trajectory as those programs turn on, again for both, defense as well as civil use – civil program. So that's going 


to turn into a very exciting thing as we get to the latter part of this calendar year.”  





Contrary to management’s guidance, we do not believe any meaningful revenue has ever been generated from 


MPAR. But that did not prevent MTSI from using its 2016 Analyst Day to paint an even grander picture for the 


“monumental opportunity” that MPAR was for the Company (emphasis added): 
 


‘The MPAR program alone is a monumental opportunity for MACOM. The system build out will require over 350 


radar systems, the largest ground based radar program ever. This will drive a demand for over 275,000 SPAR 


Tiles. Depending on the ultimate build out schedule, this could represent an opportunity of greater than $500 


million per year for MACOM. There is a very real need for this program. Our air traffic control and weather

infrastructures is obsolete. It's not a matter of if, but when, we believe that MPAR will begin to ramp towards the 


latter part of this decade.” 


- MTSI Analyst Day, March 2016 





Table 46: MPAR Overview by MTSI 


  
Source: MTSI 2016 Analyst Day Presentation 





A $500 million per year opportunity at the end of the decade would imply doubling MTSI revenue within four 


years. If it is not clear by now, MTSI’s management has made a pattern of misleading and promotional 


communication. What is a more realistic timeline for the MPAR build-out? At the March 2016 Analyst Day, 


MTSI noted that the first prototype was verified in the lab and the first production order was received: 


 
“The first significant order of SPAR Tiles was used by MIT Lincoln Laboratory to construct the first prototype 


MPAR system. The system performance was verified in the laboratory, and then demonstrated in the field by 


tracking airplanes on approach to Logan Airport and by tracking severe storm at the National Severe Storm 


Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The success of this prototype system, has led to our first large scale production 


order for SPAR Tiles, for this construction of a full MPAR system.” 





During the F2Q16 earnings call MTSI management reiterated plans for a first production build out in 2H2016 


and expected volume production in mid of 2017: 
 


“<Q - Richard Sewell>: Got you. And if I can sneak one more in. That was very helpful. On SPAR, or the SPAR 


tiles, when should we expect that to ramp? Is there any update on that project? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Well, there's revenue contributions for the second half of this year from the first 


production build out for the MPAR program, the first full production system, but if you are – I infer from your 


statement, you're talking about the real inflection point of full scale production systems. That would be in 2017 at 


the earliest. As we said at the Analyst Day, we're building our capacity plan to be able to support initial program 


volume production in middle of 2017.” 





With the first order in hand and mid-2017 the potential start of 350 more systems, this would appear to be a huge 


near-term opportunity. But what is the realistic timeframe for volume implementation? It would seem the 


National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 


those in charge of the MPAR program, would have a more accurate picture. Shockingly, NOAA’s 2015 Report 


to Congress states the “Deployment of MPAR production units may not begin until 2025 or later.”33 Yes, it is not 


a typo – the MPAR program is not expected to deploy for another 9 years!!! This obviously fails to reconcile 


with MTSI’s “latter part of the decade” target set at its Analyst Day and is most likely well beyond the 


investment horizon of even the most visionary MTSI shareholders. 





We have included below some extracts from the Report to Congress that may be informative to the investment 


community. MPAR reports are available at http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/publications/mpar_reports/.

To add another reference point, Table 48 below outlines the MPAR deployment timeline as described in the 


February 2015 presentation by Kurt D. Hondl of NOAA/NSSL. 34  Consistent with the Report to Congress 


discussed above, this timeline also anticipates MPAR deployments commencing in 2025.  





Table 48: MPAR Timeline by FAA as of 2015 


 
Source: www.nssl.noaa.gov 





We assume MTSI’s management has been aware of these timelines, but has chosen not to disclose them. The 


illusion of a near-term opportunity, with volume production commencing as early as mid-2017, with a target of 


doubling MTSI revenue in 3-5 years, is far more appealing than a target market that is nine years out.  





A more recent report to Congress in 2016 (http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/publications/mpar_reports/) reiterates the 


FAA timeline with In Service Decision (ISD) not expected until 2025 (i.e. FAA will not even decide if they will

highlights that MPAR is expected to be one of three alternative technologies the FAA will consider.  





Table 48A: MPAR Timeline by FAA as of 2016 


 
Source: http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/publications/mpar_reports/ 





Another word of caution – such big, multi-agency programs tend to have delays, making the 2025 target for 


deployments even more precarious. For example, in their January 2007 report35 titled “MPAR PROGRAM 


OVERVIEW AND STATUS,” the FAA outlined an MPAR timeline shown in Table 49 below. This timeline 


anticipated completion of a prototype build by the end of 2014, with technology transfer and contracted 


production in 2015. So there appears to have been a ten-year push-out in MPAR deployment timeframe (from 


2015 to 2025) since the orginal targets were outlined in 2007.  





Table 49: MPAR Timeline as of 2007

To recap: 


MTSI has flagged Active Antennas as one of the product areas that will double MTSI revenue over 3 – 5 years. 


The largest program in Active Antennas – MPAR – is not even scheduled to begin deployment for another 9 


years. Some of the smaller programs that MTSI highlighted, like the F-16, have failed to materialize or have 


been too small to move the needle as evidenced by the accelerating rate of revenue declines in the A&D business 


over the past three years. 





With so much hype about both GaN and Active Antennas since the May 2014 Analyst Day and no tangible 


traction, we revisit MTSI CFO’s closing comments from the May 2014 Analyst Day (emphasis added):

“Do not expect all the exciting opportunities presented today to deliver revenue in 2015. But all have been 


designed and qualified, have major design win in customer systems, and will likely generate revenue over the 


next few years through 2018 and beyond.” 





GaN and Active Antennas were a major part of the “exciting new opportunities presented” (if not THE major 


part) and the statement that “all have been designed and qualified” should apply to GaN and Active Antennas as 


much as to any other products. The fact that basestation GaN products are still not qualified almost two years 


later and Active Antennas are still somewhere between proof-of-concept and prototype phase, suggests that 


MTSI grossly misrepresented the opportunities in 2014.   





Despite the abject failure to accurately anticipate and communicate revenue opportunities, MTSI will continue to 


perpetuate the Active Antenna story. Case in point, at the Stifel Technology Conference on June 6, 2016, MTSI 


started pushing any Active Antenna expectations out of this year’s expectations (emphasis added): 


 
“<Q - Tore Svanberg>: … So the gate array business and antenna – active antenna business. So you have some 


exclusive contracts already that you announced. I think the one question we always have an investment 


community is really the ramp of that business, because obviously it could be pretty significant, right? So, any 


update there as far as how we should think about the ramp? 





<A - Robert McMullan>: I have an update, but it's probably not the answer you want to hear. 





<Q - Tore Svanberg>: Okay. 





<A - Robert McMullan>: So as we sit here today and we get closer to the year-end – our fiscal year-end and with 


the election in the backdrop here, it's not clear to us whether some of these tenders that we participated with 


Northrop actually get resolved in our fiscal year, which we have thought at one time maybe the case.” 





C. Optical and 100G – All The Right Buzzwords but Still Not Even Close to an Inflection.  
 


Optical is the third product area expected to double MTSI revenue in 3 – 5 years. The primary driver of this story 


is a family of components for 100 Gigabit (100G) networking. We take a closer look at the supposed opportunity 


compared to the actual performance (and future prospects). 





1) MTSI Has Claimed 100G was a Growth Driver for Years. 


MTSI has talked about 100G components since its IPO, initially focusing on long-haul optical transport, and 


subsequently adding metro buildouts and datacenter opportunities. Below are some extracts to show how the 


“story” has progressed” (emphasis added): 


 
“We believe that with our broad portfolio of targeted products, M/A-COM is well positioned to benefit from a 


decade long build out of the 100G fiber optics market.” 


- MTSI F2Q14 Earnings Call 


 
“I will talk about how 100G presents a hyper-growth opportunity for MACOM, where we are in the 100G 


deployments, and why we are in a great position to win. 100G is a tremendous market opportunity for MACOM. 


The 100G transceiver market is expected to triple in the next four years from $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion as 


forecasted by a leading market research analyst OVUM. MACOM has been ramping to production volumes of 


100G driver solutions for longhaul and at client site. We have a strong position in 100G metro transceivers that 


are expected to grow rapidly next year. We are also well-positioned for the explosive growth in data centers.

Table 51: MTSI 100G Outlook at 2014 Analyst Day 


 
Source: MTSI May 2014 Analyst Day 





As of the April 2015 earnings call, the ramp in Metro optical was expected to “really fuel growth” through 2016 


(emphasis added): 


 
“… networks was up strong quarter-on-quarter on the back of our optical business as we begin to see 100G 


Metro deployments ramp… We've seen an inflection point in our demand in the last quarter for optical 


components across the board feeding into these deployments. … To-date, a lot of our 100 gig revenue has come 


from long haul. We have a fabulous design win position in terms of clear, clear, clear market share leadership in 


the initial Metro deployments and then in the next wave of CFP2 form factors, which are really optimized for 


Metro applications. So we would expect that with the Metro ramp and you're starting to see the announcements 


now that, that would be really fueling growth, I would say, through 2016.” 


- MTSI F2Q15 Earnings Call 





… but on the next earnings call the language changed to “starting in 2016” (emphasis added): 


 
“networks grew quarter-on-quarter on the back of strong demand in 100G for long haul and metro networks, as 


well as lasers in the access market… if you believe what they're saying about metro networks only beginning to 


deploy, and being a very strong growth driver starting in 2016, it's quite possible that 100-gig long haul metro 


stuff could be in excess of our laser business within a few quarters …” 


- MTSI F3Q15 Earnings Call 





… and culminating in Optical being called out at the 2016 Analyst Day to double MTSI revenue based on the 


expected ramp of 100G: 


 
“All told, our optical strategies that are already in motion could readily double the size of MACOM's existing 


revenue within three years to five years.”

2) But What is the Real 100G Opportunity for MTSI? Small Appears to be the Right Answer. 


Despite multiple attempts by analysts, MTSI has refused to disclose the actual size of their 100G business. We 


have presented below extracts of attempts by analysts to quantify the revenue of 100G (emphasis added): 


 
 “<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yes, thanks... You mentioned 100-gig starting to see some revenue contribution in the 


second half of the year. I'm just trying to understand how meaningful this is. Are we just going to start to see some 


revenue contribution and then bigger ramps in 2013 or were you already start to see some material revenue in the 


second half? 





<A - Jihye Whang>: Yeah, so I think what we're seeing is a very good trend right now, and we think that second 


half of this year you'll see that become something close to an exit of $1 million per quarter for us. And that's 


somewhat dependent on the design wins going into production. But we're pretty excited for the business and see it 


starting to ramp this year and then growing even further in 2013.” 


- MTSI F2Q12 Earnings Call 


 
“<Q - Erik P. Rasmussen>: Got it. Thank you. Maybe just then – just staying in networks, obviously you 


benefited lately from your success in the 100G Opto market. How big is this business today, can you comment on 


that? Or how do you see this business ramping in the coming quarters or years? 





<A - John Croteau>: Well, I don't mean to be dodgy about it, but we don't report with the granularity down to the 


product line level. But I would say that we are in the early stages of ramp. We're very much in the pre-production 


phase. The analyst reports that we see are very consistent with the forecast that we see from our customers. 


Analysts like Dell'Oro predict a compound growth of 75% for the coming years, coming 2 or 3 years. So it's the 


high-growth segment, or I should say end market, which is experiencing unquestionably strong capital 


investment. So it's – there's a lot of juice in it and we're just at the very early stages of what we believe could be a 


decade-long build-out.” 


- MTSI F3Q13 Earnings Call 


 
“<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: That's very helpful. Thanks. A follow-up if I may on, the 100-gig optical components 


were up 35% sequentially. Is it fair to assume that that has nothing to do with BinOptics? And can you give us a 


sense of the size of that business? Thank you. 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Yeah. I got to be careful, again, our policy is not to break down our business 


quantitatively by product line, but it is absolutely getting to be material, maybe our largest in our networks 


business relative to what was previously cable and wireless infrastructure. So it's not immaterial and as you can 


imagine, 35% growth is substantial…. So I mean, the way I would put it is, the business we had in 100-gig optical,
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________55 


they've even preceded Mindspeed is flying after the races. Mindspeed accelerated that. They were succeeding. 


They met all of their growth targets coming into the company from a year ago and now the BinOptics just puts it 


into overdrive. So everything standalone is pulling its own weight, everything together looks even better.” 


- MTSI F1Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“if you believe what they're saying about metro networks only beginning to deploy, and being a very strong 


growth driver starting in 2016, it's quite possible that 100-gig long haul metro stuff could be in excess of our 


laser business within a few quarters.” 


- MTSI F3Q15 Earnings Call 





So all we know is that 100G started from around $1 million per quarter exiting 2012 and has recently been 


“material” but smaller than the laser business as of F3Q15. We know BinOptics revenue was $20.2 million in 


that quarter, or 15% of revenue. Using BinOptics as a proxy for laser revenue, this gives us an upper bound of 


how big 100G could have been at that point.  





After a couple years of ramping 100G into a “hyper-growth…tremendous market opportunity,” less than 15% of 


revenue appears to be underwhelming. To be fair, growing revenue from $1 million per quarter to $2 million 


could be considered “hyper-growth,” but we find it misleading to use these terms without providing the Street 


context on the paltry absolute dollar amounts. 





3) Datacenters are a New, Big Driver of 100G Growth for MTSI. Or Are They? 


At the March 2016 Analyst Day, MTSI called out datacenter 100G as an opportunity that could alone double 


MTSI’s revenue (emphasis added): 


 
“… the third phase of optical growth is just now taking route. 100-Gig in hyper-scale data centers. Initial 


production orders are rolling in which are going to service demand for the major cloud service providers. Our 


FiBest acquisition last December is the final piece of the puzzle in MACOM establishing a preeminent position in 


data centers. All told, our optical strategies that are already in motion could readily double the size of MACOM's 


existing revenue within three years to five years. Arguably, data centers could do that alone.” 


- MTSI March 2016 Analyst Day 





But MTSI has been talking about an “explosive opportunity” in datacenters for at least two years with 


expectations for “some real juice” as early as 2014 (emphasis added): 


 
“… in the 100-gig space… where we see the real explosive opportunity is moving from long haul where we've 


traditionally done much better and into metro and especially data centers… With all of the intensity and all the 


upside forecast for data centers, that looks like it could be providing some real juice for growth through this 


year and beyond.” 


- MTSI F1Q14 Earnings Call 


 
“And then on the data center side, fabulous customer list in terms of the guys who are going to be building out the 


big data center, so really teed up for success.” 


- MTSI F4Q14 Earnings Call 


 
“I would say first of all, data center is going to be a key driver in terms of growth.” 


- MTSI F1Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“… time-dimensionally, the access market is where the action is today, very healthy business in fiber backhaul 


and mobile infrastructure. And the future is by orders of magnitude greater in datacenter.”  


- MTSI F2Q15 Earnings Call 





MTSI is even doubling the laser capacity at Lowell ahead of the expected demand in datacenters (emphasis 


added): 


 
“… we're still on track to double unit capacity yet again in Lowell by the beginning of calendar 2016. This is key 


as we prepare to address the next secular growth driver in 100G in data centers... This positions us ideally to take
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________56 


advantage of the explosive growth opportunities as 100G enters data centers… And we're told that overall 


demand, as that turns on, we'll be at least in order of magnitude even greater than PON. So it's the reason why 


we're so maniacally fixated on getting Lowell up and running, not just for the existing market on expand market 


share, but it's really for the next phase – as I said, the next secular growth driver in data centers.” 


- MTSI F3Q15 Earnings Call 


 
“… you have to look one step ahead to our qualification of lasers for use in 100G data centers which, much like 


PON, is a cost-driven market. We expect that our cost structure, quality and sheer capacity in Lowell for lasers 


for 100-gig data centers will serve as the first in a series of disruptive moves in this explosive emerging market".” 


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





A “multi-million dollar order” announced with AAOI on the same day earnings were released added 


“credibility” to MTSI’s 100G story and creates a good talking point:  


  
“Speaking of data centers, 100-gig optical is no longer a matter of speaking in future tense in data centers. 


Today, we announced a multi-million dollar order from AOI that spans the full scope of our 100-gig portfolio. We 


believe that our current data center backlog, taken in its entirety, is traceable to demand from all major cloud 


service providers.”  


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





However, there was a wrinkle in the press release (and we don’t mean the typo in the last paragraph)… AAOI is 


using its own lasers, as highlighted in the press release below (emphasis added): 








As such, we believe MTSI’s statement that the “order from AOI that spans the full scope of our 100-gig 


portfolio” borders on securities fraud. How can MTSI tell investors it is doubling laser capacity for datacenter 


expansion and then claim it is selling the full scope of 100G products to AAOI knowing full well that it is not
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________57 


selling lasers? In the press release, AAOI specifically states that it is NOT buying lasers from MTSI. Does the 


Company not believe analysts or investors can read? Either way, our diligence suggests that the order from 


AAOI is immaterial and is simply a standard order in an ongoing relationship between MTSI and AAOI. We 


also understand that MTSI asked AAOI to allow this press release as a “PR thing” ahead of its Analyst Day.  





When pressed on the issue, MTSI CEO resorted to his favorite “time dimensional” answer, which basically 


means they don’t have the business now but they hope to get it in another time (or maybe in another dimension, 


we cannot be sure) (emphasis added): 


 
“<Q - Mark Lipacis>: That's helpful, thank you. And I'll follow-up if I may on the AOI announcement. They're 


sourcing your PMD and using their own laser diode. Are the lasers from BinOptics, are those shipping into 100-


gig modules? And if so, what kind? Is it 4x25 or how should we think about BinOptics participating in the 100-gig 


data center market? That's all I had, thank you. 





<A - John R. Croteau>: No, problem. Yeah, so absolutely our laser business, our photonic solutions business, 


previously known as BinOptics, is actually well-positioned. That's actually a time dimensional answer as it 


relates to AOI. Initially, the designs were locked down before we had gotten our 25-gig lasers to full production 


qualification.” 


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





Then, in a big departure from the bullish rhetoric of the past couple years, especially considering the “multi-


million dollar order” in hand, MTSI proceeded to set expectations for datacenter 100G business to “walk before 


it runs” because the inflection point is not yet here (emphasis added): 


 
“Now I should be clear, we're not implying that the inflection point for the mass adoption of 100-gig in data 


centers is there, but the initial engagements and the initial traction for 100-gig is it's kind of walking before you 


run. And given the amount of content that we're capturing in that gives us the confidence that our ambitions to 


drive it to the kind of mass market adoption that we're on the right track.” 





“<Q - Tore Svanberg>: That's really helpful, John. And you talked about having already pretty decent backlog 


with the cloud guys for 100-gig data center. Does that backlog suggest initial ramps perhaps in the second half of 


the year and then maybe an inflection point starting next year? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: That's my guess. I mean, like I said, you have to walk before you run. This is the year of 


walking for 100-gig in data centers.”  


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





So more than two years after talking about a “real explosive opportunity” in datacenter 100G, 2016 is still not 


the year of inflection, which begs the question how misleading was it to set expectations for “some real juice for 


growth” as far back as 2014. 





4) OK, But We Are Now Ready To Ramp Datacenter 100G, Right? 





No, for two reasons: 





First, MTSI 25G lasers were not qualified as of the January 2016 earnings call: 


 
“<Q - Quinn Bolton>:… And then just a follow-up question on the lasers. I know you said you're going to qualify 


the 25-gig lasers here in the March quarter. How long will it take to get those into production? Is there another, 


say, six to nine months as the module guys take those qualified lasers and get them into production or can you 


move pretty quickly to production if the demand is their? Thanks. 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Okay. So let me start with the easy one first. So, I would say it's one quarter to revenue 


and volume production for 25-gig lasers. So assuming everything goes as planned and everything so far has been 


going as planned and normal so we have a very high degree of confidence.” 


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________58 


… and judging by the dodged question at the March 2016 Analyst Day, they were still not qualified: 


 
“<Q - Harlan Sur>: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. On the 100-gig transceiver as you drive down that cost 


curve, obviously at the same time I think you guys are trying to qualify with all of your datacenter customers, I'm 


just trying to figure out where you are in the qualification process? 





<A - Vivek Rajgarhia>: So, is the question specific to our component supplying into the 100G datacenter 


transceivers? 





<Q - Harlan Sur>: That's right. 





<A - Vivek Rajgarhia>: So again, we've announced a huge order from one of our lead customers, that goes into 


the hyperscale. So we are supplying there. We are supplying the components. The electronics, photonics, and also 


now with the FiBest OSA capability TOSA/ROSA that go into it. But again, the approach today and all is coming 


from – is being – is coming from the telecom side, so it's happening. So the inflection point for that to happen is 


where we are fully attacking from all angles. So we believe that inflection point, we will be able to influence that, 


and again, 2017 is our best expectation right now.” 


- MTSI March 2016 Analyst Day 





The comments on 25G laser qualification and volume ramp during the F2Q16 earnings call were contradicting 


and confusing, which is consistent with MTSI’s CEO talking out of both sides of his mouth. In prepared 


comments, Mr. Croteau stated: 


 
“We also began volume production ramp of 25 gig lasers in support of 100G and datacenters”. 





This was further unambiguously confirmed in Q&A: 


 
“<Q - Mark Lipacis>: …I think I heard you talk about a 25 gig product that you're shipping. When do you think 


that ships into qualified production 100 gig modules? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Last quarter. 





<Q - Mark Lipacis>: Pardon? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Last quarter.” 





But elsewhere in the Q&A, it became apparent that whatever product MTSI is supposedly ramping, it is not the 


product that is ready for prime time (emphasis added): 


 
<Q - Richard Sewell>: … And then specifically on the datacenter side, it seems like on the optical side within 


datacenters, revenue were starting to ramp there. How should we think about that ramp in the second half of the 


year and where are we from a cost structure on the datacenter side? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Yes, so all of the business this year is really reimplemented telecom design products. So 


it is not the cost driven, cost-optimized stuff that we talked about at the Analyst Day. The word at OFC was a lot 


of concern across a lot of customers about capacity limitations, the industry limiting the ability to supply the 


demand which is ahead of their expectations. We don't think we're going to have capacity problem servicing their 


demand. They are concerned about aspects of their supply chain. So it's all very strong, but the real inflection 


point is next year when we talk about the cost-optimized solutions that really drive 100 G connectivity, the cost of 


it, and the fabulous news there was the message that we delivered as it related to the L-PICs, laser PICs where 


the safety technology was unbelievably not only acknowledged but there was a feeding frenzy among the cloud 


service guys wanting to work with us directly and hoping to drive the economics for their solution. So that was 


frankly the biggest news and validation for us coming out of OFC”. 





This brings us to our second point. The cost of MTSI’s 25G lasers targeting 100G datacenter equipment is still 


far too high for volume adoption by datacenter customers. MTSI blames this cost conundrum on its legacy of 


selling 100G to telecom customers who have higher specifications, which we believe is partly true as telecom
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________59 


modules can have hermetic sealing and other costly features. But it is not obvious why there would be a big cost 


difference at the component level.  





Regardless of the reason, MTSI admits that their cost is too high relative to the datacenter customers’ willingness 


to pay, which we believe is 10x the cost of 10G for 100G, i.e. $/G parity (emphasis added):   


 
“<Q - Mark Lipacis>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple questions on the 100-gig in the data center 


market, John, you suggested that we're not quite at the knee in the curve for mass adoption in the data center. 


What has to happen to hit that curve? Is it a matter of price point or customers just feeling comfortable that the 


products work? And if it's the price point, where are we with the price point of the 100-gig modules and where do 


you think it has to get to, to get to that volume? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: It's a fascinating question. I can give you my crystal ball speculation. But I would 


describe the current state of 100 gig in data centers as modified telecom products attempted to fit into datacom, 


whereas, the datacom market is actually profoundly different than telecom. In telecom, people expect decades of 


use in field reliably and they pay for it. In datacom, they literally have a three-year life and then they pull them 


out and re-facilitate the data centers. So you have to design – ultimately, you have to design for costs rather than 


long-term reliability, so it's just a different set of product instantiations. But I would say we're in the early stages 


of beginning to apply some of that technology... To answer your question more directly, the rule of thumb the 


cloud service guys keep saying, $1 per gigabit, so $100 per transceiver, that may or may not be the real target. 


But it's certainly not where the telecom price points have been, which is several integer multiples above that 


price.” 


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 


 
“… So it's all very strong, but the real inflection point is next year when we talk about the cost-optimized 


solutions that really drive 100 G connectivity, the cost of it, and the fabulous news there was the message that we 


delivered as it related to the L-PICs, laser PICs where the safety technology was unbelievably not only 


acknowledged but there was a feeding frenzy among the cloud service guys wanting to work with us directly and 


hoping to drive the economics for their solution. So that was frankly the biggest news and validation for us 


coming out of OFC.” 


- MTSI F2Q16 Earnings Call 





At its March 2016 Analyst Day, MTSI referenced the industry research firm LightCounting to illustrate the 


magnitude of the needed cost reductions (Table 53 below). According to the chart, the cost of 100G was $30 - 


$40 per Gigabit/second (Gb/s) as of early 2016 vs. approximately $5 per Gb/s for 10G. This is a 6x – 8x 


difference! In other words, the 100G requires an 83-87% cost reduction. This may eventually occur, but it is 


definitely not likely on the near-term horizon.
Cold Shower Analytics

Table 53: Cost Per Bit Comparison

“… different hyper scale datacenters, builders would give you different data points. There was a chart I showed 


that a market, optical market research firm LightCount reports that there has to be profound cost improvements. 


Exactly what it is, is still to be determined. But it's going to be several fold or you know several times below the 


current cost structure…Actually 100G is happening now in the datacenters… But as you pointed out that the real 


inflection point needs to happen. And that is going to be driven by getting to the right cost per bit. And as my 


presentation showed, we have basically consolidated all the key capabilities that's required to create this 


inflection point. So we believe we're going to create this inflection point and 2017 is what our – what we expect to 


happen...” 


- MTSI March 2016 Analyst Day 





So to summarize MTSI’s 100G “story”: 





i) MTSI has been selling into the “hyper-growth, tremendous market opportunity” of long haul and metro 
100G for a few years now, without a quantifiable impact. However, we can back into 100G comprising 


less than 15% of revenue. Either way, any growth from 100G has not been enough for MTSI to post 


meaningful organic revenue growth in the four years since the IPO. 


ii) Management has repeatedly given highly encouraging tidbits of sequential growth in 100G, but never 
really allowing analysts and investors more than a keyhole look into that business. In the context of 


such a small 100G contribution, many of MTSI’s growth comments, especially in FY2014 and FY2015 


appear misleading relative to the importance of this business. 


iii) MTSI described datacenter 100G as an “explosive growth opportunity” as long ago as early 2014 and 
set expectations that it can provide “some real juice for growth” starting in 2014. Despite repeated hype 


and “fabulous customer list” of datacenter customers, this has not amounted to much – as of June 2016 


MTSI still expects 2017 to be the inflection year of datacenter 100G. 


iv) MTSI boasts that it is doubling the laser capacity at Lowell facility in anticipation of datacenter 100G 
shipments. They also issued a press release about a datacenter 100G win with AAOI. Beyond the smoke 


and mirrors, MTSI does not appear to even have a working 25G laser product. Even if it did, the cost 


structure is orders of magnitude too high. By its own admission, MTSI appears to require cost 


reductions of at least 80% to make its 100G viable for datacenters.   





Stepping back, the technological differences of datacenter 100G, GaN and Active Antennas are striking. Despite 


the different dynamics with each market, the similarities of these “major growth opportunities” to MTSI are the 


same: (i) they have each been hyped for a couple of years, (ii) there has been minimal progress in the way of 


tangible results, (iii) they are all applicable to future markets that do not yet exist, (iv) MTSI’s products for these 


future markets are not yet qualified, and (v) they have cost points that are far too high.

We do not believe the similarity of these future market stories is a coincidence. The “creative handwriting” is 


consistent, and the author behind these fallacious stories appears to be the same author that has consistently sold 


stock at inflated prices.

IV. China and BinOptics – Double- and Triple-Ordering Time Bombs  
 


A. The PON Market is Stalling after Several Quarters of Overheating.  
  


At its March 2016 Analyst Day, MTSI presented the PON market forecast in Table 54 below: 





Table 54: MTSI PON Market Forecast 


 
Source: MTSI March 2016 Analyst Day Presentation 





This forecast, calling for modest growth in 2016 after hyper-growth in 2015, predicts declines in years 2017-


2019. It is rare for a company to show an industry forecast that is not growing, and in the rare cases where a 


flattish trajectory is portrayed, it usually implies tough times are ahead. With a company as promotional as 


MTSI, we believe showing such a muted forecast is code for challenges ahead. 





Despite MTSI’s own forecasts, and the growing number of data points supporting PON challenges, Mr. Croteau 


attempted to marginalize the forecast declines: 


 
“I just recently last week toured our China PON customers, and I realized that we might be under calling the 


growth in next-generation PON. If true, then this PON market rather than slowing down, as shown in the chart 


here, might keep growing for many years to come.” 


- MTSI March 2016 Analyst Day 





Recall that BinOptics had grown sequentially for four consecutive quarters, with tight supply constraints and 


exceptional demand, resulting in double digits q/q growth in F2Q16. In the March 2016 quarter, MTSI claimed 


to ramp PON capacity at its Lowell facility, which would remove capacity constrains (emphasis added): 


 
“This quarter, we expect to fully qualify the remaining two PON products in Lowell. Not only will this solve what 


has been a particularly acute capacity problem in the industry but it will provide surge capacity that allows our 


customers to avoid the need to build buffer inventories or double or triple order products.” 


- MTSI F1Q16 Earnings Call 





With history as a guide for the dynamics of supply constrained markets, we believe BinOptics’s customers 


double-ordered product during 2015 to ensure availability. MTSI’s CEO completely dismissed this possibility 


(emphasis added): 





Hyper-Growth  


Is Stalling

________________________________________________________________________63 


“<Q - Mark Delaney>: And maybe if I could ask it just a little bit differently and focusing on the laser piece of 


the business. Now that you've been getting capacity up, has there been any change in the pace of orders for your 


laser business? I know you talked about risk of double or triple orders. Just wondering if, as you guys have gotten 


more capacity online, if you've seen any fall-off in orders? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: No, not at all. In fact, customers are still pounding on us for allocation and we're dealing 


with very difficult conversations with customers that haven't been happy that we couldn't supply even more. So, 


there is no indication whatsoever. I'm highly confident there has been no double and triple ordering. 


There is no buffer inventories with our customers or in the channel because if that were the case, we would not 


have the kind of conversations with our customers that we've had. And we're also very confident that our sales 


and operations team has been in the field with the major customers in the matter of the past few weeks and agreed 


upon share commitments and ongoing revenue contributions. So I think it's going to be a very smooth transition 


out of the supply constraint to the unlimited supply conditions.” 





However, the reasons MTSI has provided for overcoming projected PON declines are confusing and 


contradictory. First, the Company references “4K set-top boxes,” for which there are no tangible projections that 


can be used for support. Then there is reference to opaque share gains that will offset broader market declines: 


 
“The product that we're shipping out of Lowell is deemed to be higher quality, has associated benefits of lower 


cost and product manufacture, and even in an environment where you might see some softening in the overall 


PON market, customers are awarding us more and more and more share. So it's just a great story right now.” 





But the dynamics in the PON market make profitable share gains hard to fathom considering MTSI is already 


the dominant 2.5G PON laser supplier, with aggressive pricing agreements at Huawei that Mitsubishi and 


Broadcom (Avago) did not pursue. In another contradictory twist, MTSI’s CEO has in fact previously admitted 


that share gains beyond 60% would be difficult… but that does not stop him from then claiming the “sky is the 


limit” (emphasis added): 


 
<Q - Richard Cutts Shannon>: Okay, fair enough. And just one last quick question for me on the PON side here. 


You talked about some fairly substantial share gains. Is there a limit to where you can go out a few quarters? I 


mean it's rare to see shares much above 50%, 60%, 70%, but it's clear that you're very willing to supply the 


market, but what's your limit there? 





<A - John R. Croteau>: Sky is the limit. I don't know. To be honest, my theory in the past is getting above 60% is 


very difficult, because customers just want to maintain a healthy supply chain. In this particular instance, the two 


incumbents didn't support what the customers needed and wanted and we did, both from a capacity standpoint 


and cost standpoint and then the cost leverage…” 





CFO Bob McMullan has also pointed to higher content in PON equipment as an offset to overall market 


dynamics. At the Stifel Technology Conference on June 6, 2016, he stated : 


 
“If the marketing volumes have peaked, maybe the last quarter in terms of the total number, we continue to sell 


other components that we traditionally have not sold. We traditionally sold laser dye to the subcontractors of the 


system manufacturers. Now we're selling more components and the way we translate that is that in essence 


adding APD, a 10-gig pin, the package itself, TO-can. We in essence are getting ASP lift in selling more 


components around the core laser now that the volumes are so large, we have an attractive opportunity to add 


additional incremental revenue and gross margin.” 





MTSI appears to be struggling to find arguments that would calm investors’ fears that the PON market is rolling 


over in the face of negative datapoints, such as the May 17, 2016 earnings of Taiwanese PON module maker 


eLASER (Table 54A below).

A May 19, 2016 report from OTR Global further highlighted the risk of inventory digestion after C2Q16, as 


some carriers have completed optical network upgrades. On its June 1, 2016 earnings call SemTech noted 


slowing demand in PON for its July 2016 quarter  and expectations for “a quarter or two of adjustment”. 





Recall also that the major customers for BinOptics include the Chinese companies Huawei and FiberHome, with 


the former having a notorious track record of double-ordering optical components (see FNSR’s 50% blow-up in 


March 2011 as one example). 





MTSI has attempted to dismiss the growing concern at recent conferences by claiming it has not seen excess 


inventory build-up: 


 
“We have a diversified portfolio in other areas of optical and laser. And this recent discussion of channel 


inventory from our perspective, we do not see. We had people, senior executives, forward selling all our 


components in China over the timeframe this all came public. We were in daily contact. We do not see channel 


inventory.” 


- MTSI CFO at Cowen Technology Conference, June 1, 2016 


 
“… to be very candid, we have executives on the ground during that timeframe. This information – the stories 


came up. And so I was in – myself and John are in daily contact with our colleagues. They did not see a channel 


inventory that people are speaking to today.” 


- MTSI CFO at Stifel Technology Conference, June 6, 2016
Cold Shower Analytics   
 


________________________________________________________________________65 





Time will tell, but the story does not appear favorable. BinOptics has been running heavily capacity constrained, 


selling to Chinese OEMs who are notorious for double-ordering and now the PON industry demand appears to 


be stalling when BinOptics adds a lot of capacity. If this is not a recipe for an inventory digestion disaster, we 


don’t know what is. 





We estimate that BinOptics represents around 20% of MTSI’s revenue. As such, the P&L impact of a slowdown 


in PON revenue would be significant. With no visibility for near-term growth from GaN, Active Antennas or 


datacenter 100G, it is possible that we could see sequential revenue declines in the near-future, which is 


definitely not a scenario baked into current expectations. 





B. Export Sanctions against Huawei Could be a Major Blow to MTSI.  
  


On March 7, 2016, the US Commerce Department placed sanctions on ZTE for alleged violations of export 


controls to Iran. As a result, U.S. companies were forbidden from selling components to ZTE. For example, 


Oclaro downwardly revised its C1Q guidance on March 8th as ZTE was a 10%+ customer. MTSI stated at its 


March 10th Analyst Day that ZTE was not a material customer, which meant the restriction had no material 


impact to its business. Three weeks later, ZTE was offered a temporary relief by US Commerce Department that 


would last through June 30, 2016, which was subsequently extended to August 30, 2016. 





MTSI has been unharmed by ZTE sanctions, and we suspect the Company may have even benefited to the extent 


its customers (Huawei and FiberHome) gained share or proactively added inventory. On June 2, 2016 the US 


Commerce Department subpoenaed Huawei36 as part of a probe into its business in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, 


Sudan and Syria. While the temporary relief granted to ZTE alleviated investors’ fears, the Huawei subpoena 


suggests to us that the US Commerce Department is far from done, and sanctions against Huawei can not be 


ruled out.     





Should sanctions be imposed against Huawei, we believe the impact on MTSI would be material. Huawei is 


MTSI’s largest customer and accounted for almost all of the y/y revenue growth in F1H16. 





At the Stifel Technology Conference on June 6, 2016, CFO Bob McMullan stated that Huawei was a 16% 


customer in F2Q16. The 10-Q seems to confirm that Huawei is MTSI’s largest customer, which also allows us to 


determine the impact of Huawei on overall growth.  





Table 54B: MTSI Revenue by Customer 





 
Source: MTSI F2Q16 10-Q 





Revenue from Huawei increased by $28.0 million from F1H15 to F1H16, which implies that the revenue from 


all of MTSI’s other customers combined increased just $22.4 million. However, excluding the revenue added 


thru FiBest and BinOptics acquisitions ($11.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively), we can calculate that 


revenue from all of MTSI’s customers excluding Huawei actually declined by $0.9 million! Because FiBest was

V. Consensus Estimates Imply A Baseless Growth Inflection. Fair Value < $21.08 
 


Speaking at the March 2016 Analyst Day, this is how CEO John Croteau described the philosophy driving 


MTSI’s approach to M&A (emphasis added): 


 
“I was recently asked why we need to acquire companies to grow… It's all about hitting windows of opportunity; 


quickly establish leadership positions in areas of secular growth, and then executing organically. M&A is a 


requisite tool and core competence if you're going to reliably hit windows for secular growth in our industry… It's 


about being bold and decisive when the time is ripe… We select acquisition targets based upon upside growth and 


margin potential that MACOM can bring to the party… One plus one equals four, sometimes eight.” 





While this answer sounds great, we believe the honest answer to M&A would have been, “We need to make 


acquisitions to hide the optics of our contracting core business.” 





Mr. Croteau provided a misleading analysis of MTSI’s revenue growth and EPS potential at this same Analyst 


Day three months ago (emphasis added): 


 
“Last year, we grew EPS 41%. Consensus has us growing EPS 50% again this year, and we're confident we can 


continue to outperform our peers similarly over time. So what does this add up to? We believe that MACOM is 


poised to deliver a unique combination of high growth and high profitability for several years to come. So let's 


take a look at our growth model. MACOM's core RF and microwave business is a rock of stability, a multi-


decade franchise that with proper care and feeding with new products, and infusions like Aeroflex/Metelics, will 


grow at or slightly above the rate of our small corner of the industry, let's say, 5% to 10%.” 





Mr. Croteau’s “rock of stability” must be code for the sinking organic CAGR of 6% over the past four fiscal 


years that we analyzed earlier.  





But the hype just continues unabated on M&A (emphasis added): 


 
“Taken in their entirety and assumingly we bat a 1,000, that means we have the juice to grow to close to $2 


billion in revenue with over 30% compound growth over the next several years. Given their high margin profile 


and strong drop-through, operating margins will expand at an even faster rate and EPS faster yet again, just as 


we delivered last year and consensus has again for this year.” 





We strongly encourage any analyst or investor who may care on MTSI to listen to some of CEO John Croteau’s 


speeches - it is hard not to get filled with enthusiasm (or a less positive feeling). 





But here is the problem. Many of his references to past performance are inaccurate and misleading, while the 


bulk of his forward looking expectations have failed to reconcile with the ultimate performance. For a CEO of a 


$2.4 billion company, this predilection for inaccurate communication often results in investigations by regulatory 


bodies or informed Boards. 





Regardless of Mr. Croteau’s rationalization, one thing is clear: M&A has played  a massive role in MTSI’s life 


as a public company. Table 54 below summarizes the revenue growth over the last four years, as well as two 


years of projected consensus estimates. Note how every year the organic revenue growth, excluding the divested 


Automotive segment, has been significantly below the headline reported growth because of acquisitions and one-


time deferred revenue recognition.  





Obviously the exuberant tone from management has thus far trumped investor and analyst skepticism. Consensus 


once again expects a big uptick to double-digit organic growth in FY2016 that accelerates to low-teens in 


FY2017.

Table 54: MTSI’s Consensus Expectations vs. Historical Performance 


 
Source: MTSI SEC filings for historical years, Bloomberg Consensus for FY2016E and FY2017E. 


Note: Organic revenue growth in FY2016E and FY2017E excludes FiBest/Metelics and assumes $38.7 million of combined 


FiBest/Metelics revenue in F2H16 vs. $39.8 million combined revenue reported in the full F1H16 as per F1Q16 and F2Q16 10-Q 


forms. FY2015A also adjusted by adding back $11.9 million BinOptics revenue to account for full F1Q15 quarter post acquisition.   





Before discussing reasonable forecasts, it is informative to look at how MTSI has delivered historically against 


consensus estimates. Table 55 below calculates apples-to-apples comparables to consensus estimates: 


 We exclude revenue that was acquired within a given year to compare apples-to-apples versus the 
original consensus estimates.  


o In the case of FY2013, FY2014 and FY2015, we pulled the consensus estimates from 
November (fiscal first quarter - e.g. November 2014 for FY2015).  


o FY2012 estimates are from April 2012, which were the first estimates following the IPO. 


 We also exclude the impact of revenue recognition changes from FY2015, as this revenue benefit 
impact was obviously not contemplated in November 2014 when the consensus was established. 





Based on straightforward analysis, we can see that MTSI has organically missed the original fiscal year estimates 


by a staggering $32 million, representing a 7.8% average annual shortfall over the four years. Organic results 


missed consensus every single year, with the magnitude of the miss growing over time. FY2015 missed the 


original consensus estimates by a whopping 15%. 





Table 55: MTSI Organic Revenue vs. Consensus Estimates 


 
Source: MTSI SEC Filings, Bloomberg Consensus, Author Estimates 





To be clear, we do not believe MTSI’s business is worthless. As such, it would be silly to make up an 


unreasonable price target for the histrionics. But MTSI has been overhyped and overvalued for a long time. With 


legacy microwave products at its core and a patchwork of acquisitions layered on top, investors will likely face a 


multi-year project once the issues of secular declines are finally accepted. MTSI has existed in a bubble of false 


perception created by its Chairman and majority shareholder John Ocampo dating back to its IPO, which has

only been further perpetuated by the current management team through deception and misrepresentation. This 


report should begin to set the record straight and stop this charade.  





Having analyzed all three product areas that are expected to drive growth, we can confidently state that no 


evidence exists for material near-term traction. Adding the looming inventory correction and deceleration in 


BinOptics/PON area, we expect MTSI’s organic revenue to resume its flattish trajectory in FY2017. We 


generously assume no trade sanctions against Huawei, which would obviously result in a significant decline in 


MTSI revenue. We give MTSI the benefit of the doubt and model a return to the 60% gross margin target in 


FY2017 after 57% - 59% guidance for F3Q16. We estimate Non-GAAP EPS of $1.74 / $1.77 in FY2016 / 


FY2017. Applying what we consider to be a generous 12x P/E multiple for a no-growth company that has 


repeatedly misled investors, we estimate an upper fair value range to be $20.92 - $21.24, or $21.08 at the 


midpoint. This represents 39% downside from the recent share price.
