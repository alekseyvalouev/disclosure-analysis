Mesoblast: Caught Red-Handed

Summary


We believe we have clear, undeniable proof that Mesoblast changed the reported
endpoints in its Phase 2 Rheumatoid Arthritis trial.


MESOâ€™s auditor just issued a going concern warning.


Mesoblast admitted it had a material weakness in financial reporting. How much
should investors trust Mesoblast?


Proof Mesoblast Changed Endpoints


We believe we have clear, undeniable proof that Mesoblast (NASDAQ: MESO) changed
the reported endpoints in its Phase 2 Rheumatoid Arthritis trial to make the results appear
favorable.


Earlier this month, we wrote about how we believed the Phase 2 Rheumatoid Arthritis trial
for Mesoblast had failed, and we documented how we believed MESO employed
statistical sleight of hand, data-mining techniques, and post-hoc analysis to make it
appear that the trial had succeeded (here). We pointed out that many of the reported
endpoints that Mesoblast touted did not match the stated endpoints in the
ClinicalTrials.gov page, and it appeared to us that Mesoblast had changed its statistical
methodology. We believe this showed that Mesoblast had manipulated the trial data to
make the trial appear successful. We obviously hit a nerve with the company because
Mesoblast came out and protested our findings in both a hastily written press release (
here) and the FY June 2016 conference call (here).


In these recent public statements, the company swears that its statistical and analytical
methods were kosher and did not include any adjustments for multiplicity, post-hoc
analyses, or data-mined endpoints. However, we believe we caught MESO red-handed in
altering a key reported endpoint in the Phase 2 RA trial, which is in direct conflict with its
public statements. Investors can clearly see that Mesoblast changed the reported
DAS28/CRP endpoint from the initial results announcement back in February to the final
results release in August.

In the February 16, 2016, initial results press release (here), Mesoblast touts an endpoint
called, "Remission at week 12, as defined by Disease Activity Score (DAS28/CRP) <2.6."
In fact, Mesoblast highlighted this <2.6 endpoint as a "key top-line result" for the low-dose
cohort.


If this is actually a key endpoint and part of the trial's pre-specified Statistical Analysis Plan
(NYSE:SAP), then we should expect that same endpoint to be updated and announced as
part of the final results release. We believe a sign of quality in a trial's results is
consistency in the presented data. However, this "key top-line result" is nowhere to be
found in the August 9, 2016, final results (here). Instead, Mesoblast only mentions an
endpoint for "low disease activity state, defined as DAS28-CRP <3.2."


Not only has the DAS28/CRP endpoint been altered, but it's also a weaker finding than the
<2.6 cut-off because it no longer represents disease remission. We believe this is
undeniable proof that Mesoblast changed the reported endpoints in order to make the trial
results appear more favorable.


Where did this DAS28/CRP <2.6 endpoint go, and why wasn't it reported again in the final
results if it was a part of the pre-specified SAP? We believe the reason is clear: Mesoblast
conducted post-hoc analysis and data-mined to find the most favorable results it could
dredge up. When the DAS28/CRP <2.6 endpoint didn't turn out to be positive at the final
reading, we believe Mesoblast manipulated the endpoint criteria to present something
more favorable. We believe the Phase 2 RA trial failed and that Mesoblast is trying to fool
investors into believing the trial was a success.

Going Concern Warning


Why do we believe Mesoblast is trying to fool investors into believing the Phase 2 RA trial
was a success? We believe it is because Mesoblast needs to distract investors from its
perilous financial position.


Mesoblast's FY June 2016 Preliminary Final Report from August 25, 2016 (here, see page
188) reveals that auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a going concern warning.

We believe that this is a significant negative development for Mesoblast; and we feel that
investors should be alarmed, as the 2015 Independent Auditor's Report (here, page 107)
did not include a going concern warning. And, importantly, Mesoblast cannot claim that
this was the result of a change in service providers as Mesoblast used the same auditor,
"PricewaterhouseCoopers," and the same partner, Jon Roberts, signed off in 2016 as in
2015.


Material Weakness in Internal Controls Identified


In addition to a going concern warning issued by the auditor, investors should be aware
that Mesoblast "determined there is a material weakness in the internal control over
financial reporting." The disclosure can be found in the FY June 2016 Preliminary Final
Report issued August 25, 2016 (here, page 128).

We believe that a going concern warning from the auditor along with disclosures of
material weakness in financial reporting are serious problems that investors should be
gravely concerned about.


Should Investors Trust Mesoblast?


This makes us question what, if anything, we can rely on from Mesoblast.


We know that ex-partner Teva Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TEVA) abandoned the Phase
3 Chronic Heart Failure trial (here).


We believe the Phase 2 RA trial failed and that MESO performed post-hoc analysis to
data-mine for positive endpoints (here).


We believe we have caught Mesoblast trying to mislead investors when the company said
it had not altered the endpoints in the Phase 2 RA trial and data-mined for successful
results (here).


We know MESO's auditor has sufficient doubts about Mesoblast's financial viability and
accordingly, has issued a going concern warning.


Finally, we know that MESO has identified a material weakness in its internal controls over
financial reporting.


New Price Target: $0


Given the recent developments and the warning issued by the auditor and the lack of
financial reporting controls that Mesoblast itself identified, our new target price is $0.


Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short
position in MESO over the next 72 hours.

The results were dose dependent and the high dose gave highly significant results. Because the low dose was not as
effective 6 months later, is the result of honest reporting.

Don't listen to this clown. He's almost always a contrary indicator, perhaps excepting penny stocks.

What do you say to the announcement regarding Mallinckcrodt and their financial backing and new share holding in
MESO Anonymous/Alpha? MESO's financial situation doesn't look so perilous any more does it? The SP is a long
way from your predicted zero value. And crucially it seems that a reasonably big pharma company is backing up their
science as well. Eagerly awaiting the next attempted hatchet job from you or will it be in a new guise? What about
Spurious Alpha? RA results will be out soon, and with them will follow a massive short squeeze. Good luck.
