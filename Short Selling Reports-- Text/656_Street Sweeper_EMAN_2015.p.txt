eMagin: Imagine This Stock Collapsing Below $1
Jun. 11, 2015 10:26 AM ET19 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Considering the most bullish projected 2015 earnings of $0.03 per share, EMAN is
trading at an astounding ~100 times earnings.


Already struggling with a product issue that left one customer "not interested" in its
microdisplay, EMAN has just lost a Navy contract to its greatest little rival, Kopin.


EMAN’s thin, thin profit - after nearly two years of losses - can't erase the falling
revenue last quarter versus the same-quarter 2014, and full-year 2014 versus 2013.


Institutional holders have recently been selling out or decreasing positions in EMAN,
including two well-known institutions.


Looking for all the world like a virtual reality gamer, eMagin Corp. (NYSEMKT:EMAN) has
been virtually running in place ever since the introduction of its first microdisplay 14 long
years ago.


And now one of the OLED (organic light emitting diode) display maker's greatest rivals has
reached across and hit eMagin's reverse button… stealing a Navy contract right out from
under its nose.


This - and additional adversity - will likely squash the almost flat revenue anticipated for
2015. Though eMagin (pronounced imagine) just turned a slight profit after seven straight
quarters of losses, these challenges suggest it may have a tough time hanging on to that
oh-so-tenuous profitability.


Investors may check out other viewpoints here, which include bullish points such as
eMagin may gain government contracts, develop advantages over rivals and find more
growth opportunities. The company has not returned TheStreetSweeper's request for
comment.


Meanwhile, we'll hit the top reasons eMagin's virtual shoot-out will likely end badly. We're
looking for the stock price to drop below $1 because:


1. Yowza! Trading At 100 Times Earnings?!?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3252325-emagin-imagine-this-stock-collapsing-below-1 2/12


The most bullish analyst estimates EMAN's earnings will reach 3 cents per share for the
year. So that means investors are paying an astronomical 100 times more than the
earnings they expect to receive.


That's a lot considering the fact that EMAN is a little OLED microdisplay maker with
declining revenue - not one of the highflying biotechs working on a cure for cancer. We'll
save the multiple we're generously projecting for EMAN for the conclusion of this article.


2. Ouch! EMAN's Little Rival Nabs Military Contract


One of EMAN's greatest rivals, Massachusetts-based Kopin Corp. (NASDAQ:KOPN), just
pulled off a stunning upset. The rival announced a US Navy production order for its high-
brightness color SXGA displays for full-color, helmet-mounted display products for MH-60
helicopters.


Kopin stated its SXGA color display is the first microdisplay allowing full-color advantages
in aviation helmet-mounted displays. Lack of full color is a distinct disadvantage with
EMAN's prototype, though EMAN plans to add blue soon, according to this Upload article.


Military customers are vital to EMAN, of course. Hopewell Junction, NY-based EMAN has
won several Army and Navy microdisplay agreements, though most have been completed
in the last couple of years. Filings state one $6.3 million deal reached in 2014 remains
alive, but will die out completely in 2016.


EMAN certainly cannot afford to lose a single contract.


3. Contract Problems Began Earlier


The Kopin deal may or may not be tied to EMAN's earlier customer problems. Three
customers stopped shipments last year due to an apparent wire bonding problem in
EMAN microdisplays. Two clients resumed shipments, but the third customer is now "not
interested," according to EMAN.


EMAN has been trying to meet that customer's requirements. But, let's face it, it doesn't
sound promising. See the filing note on page 45 here, especially noting the last line:


"It is reasonably possible that eMagin will incur a future loss once the terms of the
proposal are finalized."


EMAN is learning the priceless lesson that one disappointed customer can sucker-punch
a company and leave it reeling for a long, long time.

4. Real, Robust Rivals


Kopin is just one of numerous large and small companies, nipping and thrashing away at
the very same market opportunities pursued by EMAN. Here's EMAN's link mentioning the
"highly competitive" industry packed with rivals such as:


Yunnan OLiGHTEK Opto-Electronic Technology Co. (Olightek) in China and
MicroOLED in France, the Sony (NYSE:SNE) division in Japan and Himax
Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) in Taiwan.
New York-based Vuzix Corp. (NASDAQ:VUZI), and private, San Francisco-based
Osterhout Design Group.


Quickly comparing EMAN with a couple of competitors shows the company has performed
worse than Kopin in half of the metrics and nearly as poorly in the other half… and worse
than Himax in all metrics:

5. Reality of EMAN's Virtual Reality: A Mixed Bag


CEO Andrew Sculley recently commented about potential partners' or customers' positive
reactions to EMAN's headset prototype as the company tries to attract a manufacturer to
produce a consumer product. But the prototype may not be hitting all the right buttons with
everyone.

Recent reviews during the Consumer Electronics Show by Virtual Reality Reporter
indicate the Osterhout Group's screen resolution, user-interface and overall experience
vaulted that new release into preferred status, though tempered by price concerns.


Reviewers also indicate Oculus Crescent Bay impressed with its display resolution and
immersive experience. They also liked Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Gear VR and the
affordable $99 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Tech - Go4D for use on all
smart phones.


While EMAN's most recent prototype apparently wasn't shown at this year's Consumer
Electronics Show, investors can see that EMAN's rivals have acquired a certain status.


The author of a June 9 Upload article tried and liked eMagin's newest prototype, but noted
some distinct negatives. Along with the currently missing blue LED, eMagin's display
cords would fall out unless its Dan Cui held them in place when the reviewer moved his
head. Also, the headset's headtracking was not ideal, though Mr. Cui said an add-on could
produce positional tracking that could improve gamers' experience.


A Seeking Alpha author also offers a nice comparison of the head-worn-wearable
components of EMAN and several other companies, here, suggesting EMAN offers
nothing extraordinary.


6. Institutional Investors Bow Out


Uh-oh, institutional investors appear to be discovering EMAN's negatives, too. It's always
a good idea for average investors to be on the alert if more institutional holders are selling
a stock than buying it.


That's exactly what is happening to EMAN:

Institutional holders that dumped their EMAN shares as of March 31 include Robert W.
Baird & Co. and Deutsche Bank. Altogether, 16 institutions unloaded some or all of their
holdings for a total of 100,873 shares sold, pretty close to double the number institutional
holders bought. Not a good sign.


And that unfortunate selling trend may link to another unsettling reality… revenue slips.


7. Slipping Revenue: Putting Income In Perspective


After almost two years of operating losses, EMAN last quarter reported income of
$320,000. That's great. But before we start imagining piles of pennies in EMAN's future,
let's take off our virtual reality headsets and grab a dose of actual reality.


Pushing through the Securities and Exchange Commission filings, investors can see
revenue is actually slipping. Down, down, down, down. Accumulated losses are going up,
up, up, up… to $207 million.


Check out last quarter revenue versus the same time a year ago, below:


And revenue dropped by over $2.2 million in 2014 versus 2013, almost as much as the
$2.6 million drop from the year before:


(Sources: SEC filings, here, here)


While we applaud EMAN for cutting enough costs to help it lightly step into net income last
quarter, companies cannot just cut their way into long-term profitability. They have to do
just the opposite of what EMAN has done lately… groooow revenue.


8. More Reality: Unsustainable Upward Trend


Over the last four months, EMAN appears to have been extremely overbought, reaching
an unsustainable excessive uptrend that occurs only 5 percent of the time. So, according
to NASDAQ, investors can expect the stock to turn sideways or drop.

Conclusion


Not so long ago, a company like this had to be consistently making money to be trading at
a multiple of 12 to 15 times earnings. Yet, EMAN's investors are paying just about 100
times earnings.


Considering all the challenges facing the company, we can bring ourselves to give EMAN
only a factor of 25 times the most bullish projected earnings - still incredibly generous.


So, as soon as investors push off their clunky virtual reality headsets, we imagine shares
will get shot down to ~$0.75 per share.

This company is a serial maker of promises, to the tune of $200+ million in accumulated losses. These guys can't
grow revenue and can't make money. Even if we generously valued the 'business' at 50% of revenue, the stock is
only worth $0.50-0.60. Should be a very good short here.

yeah? semiconductor yields tend to improve, yeah? so let's say 40m revenue and 8m operating profits in a
few years. i'd be disappointed but so will a short.


2) but how do u know that some morning at 8 am your portfolio won't have an atomic explosion inside of it?


like Yahoo news: 8AM, EMAN announces strategic investment from Google, up 200% pre-market...


how do you know? are you covering if that happens? or ride it out? you'll probably ride it: markets are
weighing machines and all that.


probably best to plan now just in case. not saying it'll happen, but when you short things like eman you should
probably figure out your margin limits and all that stuff.


of course, if you're a silicon valley optical engineer w/ real insights i apologize. r u?

"Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket."


Streetsweeper: I've profited from ~5 of your ideas. GORO made my year! Until recently anything you published I read
*immediately* and acted on ~10-20% of the time.


Are you out of ideas? Your hit piece on NILE, which I'm neutral on, surprised me.


But you've hit a new low here: random Yahoo commenters know more about EMAN than you.


I intend to rebut you formally, but I'll offer a quick tidbit.


Did you know KOPN's mil revenue was $52m in 2009? And $9m in 2013?


EMAN's rose from $6m in 2006 to $21m in 2010 where its stagnated at since.


KOPN blames their 80% decline on 'budgets'. I'm sure budgets are part of the story, but why do 'budgets' slice 80%
off KOPN while causing mere flatness at EMAN?


Did you know KOPN doesn't even name EMAN in their 10-K? Why do you think they don't want to set investors eyes
on their rival? EMAN names KOPN as competition loudly.


You can point to the bit of ground KOPN made up in 2014, and that avionics deal, but you're missing the big pic.


If the military likes KOPN then why is EMAN getting $7m in military research funds: http://bit.ly/1FLHj5o


EMAN gains a bunch of share and rapidly eclipses KOPN on the basis of superior yet costly displays; and the military
funds R&D to bring down their cost and improve their functionality for use in new markets, i.e. the few military ones
EMAN doesn't already possess.


Complete the picture.


I own EMAN and admit it is a speculative investment, but this is a helluva dangerous short. You appear to have sunk
to shorting based merely on numbers rationalized by brief hit pieces.


I talk here about when shorting on the #s is safe and when it's not: http://seekingalpha.co...

It's not safe here because EMAN possesses legit hard to copy tech (btw Yunan and microoled are not ROBUST
rivals; lol, you have to be kidding). LCD and LCoS displays might not be good enough for many applications. And
EMAN is by far the leader in micro oled.


Shorting a $70m company w/ potential hard to copy tech in emerging billion dollar markets, not a safe thing.


You've done good work, I've benefitted from it. Think harder here.

Streetsweeper is good at putting out hit pieces to support their short positions. They did the same to another
up and coming OLED company Universal Display (ticker OLED). Look at their chart for the last year. Maybe
this is a long term buy signal for EMAN.

Well, thing is, every streetsweeper report triggers wailing from longs.


But they used to undercover genuine scams ran by genuine scumbags with out genuine potential trading at
genuinely absurd prices.


Even their recent piece on MIFI was pretty good.


But nowadays they mix in crap like this. Self-corrective though: blindly shorting genuine moon-shots at 2.5x
sales is gonna end badly.

Yes KOPN did get a follow on order to the F-35 HMD but it still has problems :


"Needless to say, as many other F-35’s systems, the HMDS has suffered issues: whilst jitter and latency
problems have been solved, there is still concern with turbulence and buffeting, that can cause display issues

(particularly dangerous when the JSF is maneuvering to evade an enemy missile shot), decreased night-
vision acuity, and information sharing when 3 or 4 aircraft fly together.

Meanwhile it appears EMAN may be picking up the F-15 HMD as a recent release by Boeing states an
organic-lightemitting diode display is being used :


“This is the first major upgrade to the joint helmet system, which was first fielded 15 years ago,” said Greg
Hardy, manager for Boeing Tactical Aircraft Advanced Display Systems in St. Louis. “The technology is
revolutionizing air combat.” The digital system uses less power and has fewer parts in the helmet and cockpit,
making it more reliable, Hardy said. Its mass also is better balanced to reduce pilot fatigue, critical during
acceleration and high G-force maneuvering. In addition, the day visor can be swapped out quickly by hand,
allowing the aircrew to easily move between day and night operations. “Couple this technology with a sharper
image and improved day and night capabilities … and you have an advanced targeting solution that is more
reliable and less fatiguing for pilots to wear,” Hardy said. The Digital Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System
uses an organic-lightemitting diode display, which improves maintenance and reliability, Hardy added.

Here is video of the F-15 HMD being tested . OLED being used is stated by the narrator :

Furthermore the F-35 program continues to be plagued with problems .


The can't seem to even get a basic component like the engine right :


The F-35 is having significant problems with one of its most important components: the engine.


http://read.bi/1BdEddY


 
But back to the F-35 HMD with KOPN displays .


It appears that in addition to the problems I mentioned above , "green glow " is also a continuing issue :


But the helmet, like the rest of the F-35, ran into operational problems.


According to testing from the Department of Defense, turbulence and buffeting of the aircraft could cause
significant display issues within the helmet.


The report stated that during basic offensive and defensive maneuvers the conditions negatively effected the
display, a problem that could have "the greatest impact in scenarios where a pilot was maneuvering to defeat
a missile shot."

In addition, the Post noted that the helmets suffered from night-vision and streaming issues that caused
motion sickness among pilots. Fortunately these problems have largely been resolved, although the green
glow associated with the night vision is still a persistent issue.


http://read.bi/1Gl3p1l


So it looks to me that while KOPN gets to contribute to the problem plagued F-35 HMD, EMAN will have the
honor to upgrade the F-15 HMD in what is currently a more dependable and reliable aircraft .


Furthermore , hundreds if not thousands of F-15's will likely have their HMD's upgraded to the new EMAN
OLED's with "digital " technology while the F-35 tries to get it right with KOPN displays & their "green glow " .

this is in the wake of a interview UploadVR did with eMagin spokesman Dan Cui at Augmented World Expo. Mr. Cui
related in that interview "that eMagin is in talks with all the major headset makers to integrate their microdisplays into

God let's hope so. Once upon a time Street Sweeper used to write meaningful and impactful short articles.
Now they write short articles which usually send the stock higher on the day of the report which not only
impairs the short for better short sellers, it makes it's just embarrassing. Just say no to low quality research.

As I see it if 3 things are true EMAN is a winning lottery ticket: 
1) HMD market gets big. 
2) It migrates towards OLED microdisplays. 
3) EMAN retains leadership in OLED.


#1 is easy. Even low HMD estimates for 2020 are gargantuan relative to EMAN's market cap. So all the uncertainty is
in #2-3.


Arguments for 2: 
-fundamental architectural advantage over LCD and LCoS 
-already best in the things that are constraining HMD adoption, i.e. efficiency, contrast, and size. so, already chosen
where price insensitive. 
-not best in res/size, or pixel size, but not clear where that matters. 
-younger so performance gaps to grow as innovation space searched, and costs to decline 
-OLED finally winning in cell phones if not TV's; the hype overestimated pace but not potential 
-predictable pattern of expensive/best techs going military first then leaking into consumer markets

-in short, OLED has cost problem, LCOS/LCD have performance problem, and in tech history you bet on the young
tech to solve its cost problem


Arguments for 3: 
-hard to manufacture + learning curve effects + EMAN furthest out on the learning curve = robust advantage 
-their "competitors" like MicroOled haven't, far as anyone can tell, secured any meaningful design wins. MicroOled
claims "100k" units sold since 2012 but to whom? Must be low res displays for arduino tinker toy projects. 
-Yunnan? Again, competitors make prototype w/ sexy specs, but where is mass production? real wins? proof of yields
>1%? 
-Military backing; KOPN mil funding now zero; EMAN picking back up; mil considers US OLED of strategic import? 
-Threat: sony and samsung. sony did 0.5 inch high res display but just 80 nits i think. if #3 proves wrong it's not gonna
be because of Yunnan or the French wannabe, I'd think it'd be a Sony/Samsung type.


Seeking input, i.e. corrections, quantitative bolsters, or additional relevant pieces I miss.


I think the framing is useful: 1 is true so forget about it. Focus on 2, 3. Then we Fermi it: say, 20m HMD units in 2020,
1/2 OLED, 75% of OLED is EMAN, ~$50 average price per display = $375m revenue = carbomb in the Street
Sweeper's chassis. But again, the big uncertainty is in fraction OLED, and fraction of OLED that's EMAN.


What's strongest threat? Agree #3 is most uncertain? EMAN stubs all ten toes as Sony, Samsung, et. al catch up?
