Swisher Hygiene May Go Down the Toilet Again
May 4, 2011 8:39 AM ET33 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Swisher Hygiene (Nasdaq: SWSH) may have polished its act since going public again, as
suggested by the sweeping gains in its stock price, but it nevertheless remains a bleeding
sanitation company with a pile of dirt attached to its name.


Shunned like trash before its rescue by Wayne Huizenga and Steven Berrard, longtime
business partners credited with building the giant Blockbuster chain during its pre-
bankruptcy glory days, Swisher has managed to repackage itself as a future powerhouse
– worth more than $1 billion – in the mundane sanitation business.


The pair paid less than $20 million for the original Swisher, records indicate, a company
sullied at the time by past fraud allegations and a criminal conviction that sent its
namesake founder to jail. The duo operated Swisher as a private company for about five
years, records show, then took it public again last November through a reverse merger
with a Canadian shell caked with some muddy baggage of its own.


They tried to dress Swisher up with acquisitions in the meantime, corporate filings show,
but their familiar “roll-up” strategy failed to deliver consistent revenue gains – let alone
actual profits – along the way.


Nevertheless, Swisher saw its market value swell to almost $1.7 billion last month
following a breathless rally that had more than doubled its share price since the beginning
of the year. While its market value has since fallen to $1.3 billion, following a recent slide
in its stock from $11.43 to $8.77 a share, Swisher still commands a rich premium – trading
at 19.6 times sales in a sector where the dominant player trades for just two times sales
instead -- that looks downright gigantic based on traditional measurement tools.


Swisher faces the threat of massive dilution, too, which could expand its share count from
148.5 million to almost 260 million (or by 75%) over the course of the next year. The
company also carries some less obvious weight, research suggests, with the potential to
hammer its stock long before that time.


Consider the following alarms, sounded in just some of the disturbing news reports
uncovered by TheStreetSweeper during its review of Swisher and those with relevant ties
to the company:

Huizenga, the most celebrated (if arguably least involved) member of Swisher’s new
leadership team, originally made a name for himself by building Waste Management
(NYSE: WM) into a gigantic garbage-collection chain. Waste Management cooked its
books to sustain the illusion of powerful growth after Huizenga left, with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission later accusing the company of orchestrating “one of the most
egregious accounting frauds” it had ever seen. Huizenga’s fellow cofounder at Waste
Management wound up shouldering much of the blame, coming under fire by one of the
company’s own directors, who reportedly proclaimed: “The son-of-a-b ought to be in
prison.” (Sources: The Houston Chronicle, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal (pdf files)


Patrick Swisher, the original founder of the company, ignited a big accounting scandal of
his own. Swisher allegedly broke so many rules, in fact, that the company’s independent
auditing firm spent five pages documenting its concerns when abruptly resigning from its
post.


Swisher himself later went to prison for evading taxes on profits from secret offshore stock
sales, selling the company to Huizenga and Berrard – while retaining an important role at
the firm – shortly after his release. “He’s the brain trust behind this,” Berrard explained at
the time. “We want to continue to utilize his expertise and his knowledge to take this
business to the next level.” (Sources: Entrepreneur, The Charlotte Business Journal,
Federal Bureau of Prisons)


Hugh Cooper, the CFO of Swisher, previously filled the same post at young Fuzion
Technologies before it filed for bankruptcy. He resigned ahead of that disaster, which
reportedly prompted an FBI probe of Fuzion insiders suspected of looting the company.
“The company raised between $50 (million) and $55 million,” a confidential source stated
after the bankruptcy, “and the Feds are hot on the trail.” (Source: The South Florida
Business Journal)


Michael Serruya, the founding CEO of CoolBrands before its reverse merger with Swisher
(and now a director and major shareholder at Swisher itself), brought some dirt to the
company as well. Serruya and his family have reported ties to a notorious Canadian stock
promoter accused of fleecing so many investors that he was “barred from entering the
United States, from working in the giant U.S. securities industry for five years and from
holding a controlling interest in a public company anywhere in the world.”


CoolBrands itself suffered from a sullied reputation, too, ranking “dead last” for corporate
governance practices – on a list of more than 200 Canadian companies – during its final
years of operation as a failed yogurt chain before becoming the corporate shell that would

allow Swisher to go public again. (Sources: The National Post (pdf), The Globe and Mail)


Despite everything, however, Swisher has managed to recycle itself as a shiny, new
winner and enjoy the equivalent of superstar treatment in the stock market.


“This is one of the most distorted situations we have ever seen,” the Value Investors Club
wrote in a bearish report on Swisher after the stock broke past the $10 mark last month.
“We believe Swisher is worth no more than $2.00 per share in an optimistic case … More
realistically, it is probably worth $0.00 to $1.00” instead.


The same research analyst has made bearish calls on a string of others stocks in recent
years, all of them down – two by more than 80% -- since his original reports. He felt that
Swisher stood out even among that crowd, however, declaring it “one of the most
compelling short opportunities” he had ever encountered throughout his successful stock-
picking career.


Swisher declined to answer questions for this story.


Miracle Grow


Swisher investors appear to be banking on an outright miracle from Huizenga and
Berrard, The Wall Street Journal recently observed (pdf), whose celebrated records look
rather uneven at best.


As noted above, Huizenga is perhaps best known for building Waste Management into a
powerful empire before fraud forever tainted the company’s name. He then joined forces
with Berrard to create a new giant at Blockbuster, records show, which also faltered (and
ultimately filed for bankruptcy) after he left the scene. Although the pair followed up with a
lasting winner in AutoNation (NYSE: AN), news records (pdf) show, that company staged
an impressive comeback only after replacing Berrard and putting a proven industry
veteran in charge.


Meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported years ago, Huizenga and Berrard launched an
outright disaster – doomed floral chain Gerald Stevens – along the way. Through his
venture-capital firm, past news coverage shows, Berrard backed several other ill-fated
companies as well.


Huizenga clearly knows how to build industry giants that flourish with his help, history
suggests, but tend to suffer with his partners calling the shots instead. While Huizenga
has assumed the post of non-executive chairman at Swisher, records show, he has

indicated that he will play only a limited role at the company and rely on Berrard – the
actual CEO of the North Carolina-based firm – to deliver his own homerun for a change.


“I’m living in Fort Lauderdale, and Swisher is in Charlotte,” Huizenga pointed out in a
Bloomberg article published a few months before Swisher went public again. “Sure, I’m
involved more than before. But I’m in a different city, so how involved can you be?”


Under the leadership of Berrard, news records show, Swisher has employed the same
worn-out growth strategy that worked temporary wonders at Blockbuster – but failed
completely at Gerald Stevens – in an effort to build the company into a major sanitation
chain. Swisher spent huge sums chasing that growth as a private company (borrowing
more than $20 million from a firm affiliated with Huizenga), corporate filings show, but
actually saw its revenue decline in the years leading up to its return to the public market.
While a big spike in acquisitions finally boosted its sales in 2010, records show, that
growth came at a high price – with both losses and short-term debts exploding – that
overshadowed those modest revenue gains.


By executing a reverse merger with CoolBrands, corporate filings show, Swisher gained
access to a corporate shell with a big bank account and a publicly traded stock that could
supply even more valuable currency. On the day the two companies announced their
merger plans last August, news coverage reveals, Swisher – feeling suddenly flush – was
already gearing up for a big shopping spree.


“You go to a guy and say: ‘Do you want to sell?’” Huizenga told Bloomberg at the time. “If
they think they can be a part of something that’s going to grow – you give them some cash
and some stock – they’ll say, ‘Yes.’


“They want the stock,” he continued, “because they’ll think: ‘Oh boy. You guys are going to
grow this business, and I’m going to watch my stock grow!’”


Compulsive Shopper


The stock took off even before that deal closed, the National Post observed (pdf), jumping
to almost $2 on the original announcement and then soaring toward $5 a share in the two
months that followed. Once Swisher officially went public in November, records show, the
company promptly began to spend its newfound cash and pledge big chunks of its
increasingly valuable shares.


Swisher issued a $5 million convertible note as partial payment for an acquisition that
same month, records show, and a similar $3.9 million convertible note for another
acquisition the month after that. Those notes – convertible into stock priced below $4 a

share – mature this June, filings show, when the lockup period on some 32.84 million
shares of restricted stock (issued to acquisition targets and private investors) officially
expires.


Earlier this year, records show, Swisher purchased Choice Environmental – a company
with slim (and shrinking) profits, limited cash resources and sizable debt obligations – in a
deal valued at almost $100 million that ranks as its largest on record by far. Swisher
covered the vast majority of that acquisition with stock, filings show, issuing 8.3 million
shares (plus another 900,000 warrants) to Choice itself and an even higher 12 million
shares to investors who supplied funds to pay down Choice’s hefty $40.9 debt load.


Thanks to that deal, records show, Swisher finally scored a long-elusive spike in sales that
pushed its “pro forma” revenue above the $100 million mark. Even with that higher
revenue figure, however, Swisher still boasts a rich valuation that stands out from the
crowd.


Swisher trades at 12 times that pro forma sales total, records show, while industry giant
Ecolab (NYSE: ECL) trades at just two times its own sales instead. Otherwise, Swisher
seems completely outclassed when compared to its towering peer. It takes a year to
generate the kind of sales that Ecolab can produce in a week (or less), records indicate,
and posts losses as opposed to double-digit profit gains.


By now, some feel, Swisher looks like a compulsive buyer – grabbing even the youngest
of companies – in its heady push for growth. In recent months, they note, Swisher has
actually purchased at least two companies that (based on their incorporation documents)
appear to be less than one year old.


This January, records show, Swisher bought an outfit known as En-Viro Solutions for $1
million in cash and a chunk of stock now worth more than $3 million. At the time, records
show, Swisher portrayed En-Viro as a proven five-year-old company and even appointed
its founder, Michael Lezon, to serve as a corporate sales manager. However, records
indicate, En-Viro was actually incorporated by Lezon less than two months before selling
itself to Swisher in that multimillion-dollar deal.


Last month, records suggest, Swisher followed up by inking a similar (if smaller) deal for
another company that – based on its own incorporation documents – was barely nine
months old at the time.

Meanwhile, records indicate, Swisher’s new Choice subsidiary has already executed a
potentially troubling buyout deal of its own. In its first acquisition since being acquired
itself, records show, Choice arranged to buy a Florida firm called Lawson Sanitation for up
to $5.5 million in cash and almost 1 million shares of stock. Lawson Sanitation operates in
the same Miami neighborhood as another company known as Dade Waste Haulers
(located just two blocks away), records show, which in turn lists Lawson Founder John
Lawson Jr. and Choice Vice President Nick Cascisone among its four insiders (pdf). (A
third insider at Dade Waste Haulers, Carlo Piccinonna, appears to be among a crowd
arrested years ago in a reported crackdown on local garbage collectors suspected of
illegal government bribes.)


Choice and Lawson never hinted at any conflicts when joining forces with each other,
records show, with the latter’s founder actually coming across as a tough negotiator
instead.


“When Choice first approached me, the company was not for sale,” Lawson declared in
the Swisher press release officially announcing the deal. “That said, I looked at my
options, the timing in the marketplace and the opportunity at hand – including the ability to
be part of a dynamic group with the growth plans and prospects it presented – and I
decided to join the team.”


That “timing in the marketplace” looked downright perfect a few weeks later, when Swisher
hit an all-time high of $11.43 a share that temporarily placed a $16.85 million price tag on
that apparent (if undisclosed) related-party deal.


Odor Eater


As indicated above (and documented in more detail below), Swisher has relied on a
broken company merged with a tainted shell – now led by a CEO with a history of past
failures – to create an unlikely stock-market star. That recipe has worked sweet wonders
so far, despite the apparent use of so many spoiled ingredients.


Take the original Swisher International, just for starters. That Swisher enjoyed its own
glory days, Entrepreneur noted years ago, escaping from the penny-stock arena (pdf) to
become an impressive Nasdaq gainer – peaking around $13 a share -- before its dramatic
collapse. The year after the stock hit its all-time high, Entrepreneur revealed, Swisher lost
its outside auditor, its Nasdaq listing and its previously reported (but fabricated) earnings.
The SEC later sanctioned both Swisher and its founder, news records (pdf) show, who
ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal charges and wound up sentenced to 30 months in
prison as punishment for his crimes.

“Morally challenged corporate executives who fail in their duty to provide truthful and
transparent accounting information to shareholders and those considering investing in the
company will be prosecuted,” U.S. Attorney Bob Conrad declared in an Associated Press
story (pdf) covering the development. “The first principles of free markets – transparency
and trust – will be zealously protected.”


Swisher was released from prison in September of 2004, inmate records show, and
managed to sell his big stake in the company to Huizenga and Berrard just a couple of
months later. He pocketed more than $8 million on that deal, The Charlotte Business
Journal reported, walking away from another $1.5 million in forgiven debts to the company
as well. He also secured a lucrative consulting contract with Swisher, the newspaper
revealed, even though the company’s new owners clearly knew about his criminal
background.


(Swisher was actually still on “supervised release” at the time he sold his stake in the
company, court records indicate, although he managed to terminate that program early –
by satisfying court-ordered restitution payments in full – right after banking his millions.)


Swisher’s original consulting contract lasted for two years, the business journal reported,
his non-compete agreement for five. He registered the trademark for a new hygiene
franchise known as Enviro-Master Services in September of 2009 -- exactly five years and
10 days after his release from prison – and officially registered the name in July of 2010,
records show, indicating that he had finally severed his lingering ties to Swisher by that
time.


Meanwhile, The Deal magazine later revealed, Swisher Hygiene regularly fielded
persistent calls from CoolBrands pitching the idea of a reverse merger throughout that
same timeframe. Like the original Swisher, past news coverage shows (pdf), CoolBrands
had taken investors on a wild ride – with even more dramatic swings – that ultimately
ended in disaster.


In the case of CoolBrands, The National Post indicated (pdf), the founder simply forged
close ties with a suspected (if particularly infamous) con artist instead of engaging in
outright fraud himself. Serruya sat on the board of a dubious company spawned by
Canadian stock promoter Jack Banks, the newspaper revealed in mid-2002, with
Serruya’s father later bailing his “good friend” Banks out of jail – satisfying a $5 million
bond with funds pledged from a $12 million family trust – after Banks was arrested for
alleged stock fraud.

“Jack (Banks) has built … a stock-market house, using an ever-changing array of
companies that he and associates controlled,” The National Post explained. “One after
another, the companies’ stock prices soared briefly, only to thud back to earth, by which
time Mr. Banks and his associates had moved on, leaving behind a trail of debt, lawsuits
and angry investors across the United States and Canada.”


CoolBrands itself sparked regular controversies of its own, The Globe and Mail revealed in
a big investigative report (which read like an obituary of the company) a few years ago.
The stock repeatedly swung from double-digit highs to sub-$1 lows, the newspaper noted,
with company insiders – including Serruya and his brother – sparking outrage after quietly
cashing in a combined $43.6 million near one of those peaks along the way. CoolBrands
finally hit freefall mode after tripping a debt covenant in 2006, the newspaper added, when
Serruya stepped in to rescue the company in exchange for 5.5 million cheap warrants –
priced at just 50 cents apiece -- before going on to liquidate most of the chain’s assets and
create a cash-rich corporate shell.


“If CoolBrands rises for a third time in its history, and the share price takes off,
shareholders rights advocates might still complain about Michael Serruya’s 5.5 million
warrants,” The Globe and Mail stated back then. But “it’s a problem Serruya would
probably welcome” at this point.


Cash Register


Serruya held onto those cheap warrants through last fall’s reverse merger, corporate
filings indicate, executed by a firm – known as Broadband Capital Management (BCM) –
that has taken a string of companies public through similar “backdoor” deals.


Broadband initially catered to the so-called “Chinese reverse-merger” crowd, records
show, a shady arena now tainted by suspicious bookkeeping and allegations of outright
fraud. The firm actually broke into the business as the lead underwriter for Great Wall
Acquisition, records show, a company – now known as ChinaCast Education (Nasdaq:
OTCPK:CAST) -- that has since attracted scrutiny for a maze of bizarre financial deals.


Broadband also managed a private placement ahead of a reverse merger for Jamba
(Nasdaq: JMBA), records show, with Berrard supplying the “blank-check” shell for that
2006 deal and becoming chairman of the board – where Serruya serves as a director – of
the newly public smoothie chain. Jamba has since fallen from $7 to $2.50 a share, records
show, its stock long pressured by fears of possible bankruptcy.

As indicated earlier, Berrard helped launch other companies that have met with that
dismal fate (pdf) already. Together with two other Swisher executives, records show,
Berrard runs a venture capital firm that has backed a crowd of risky companies – such as
the disastrous Gerald Stevens floral chain – over the course of the past dozen years.
Embraced by growth-hungry investors like those now attracted to Swisher, records
indicate (pdf), Gerald Stevens fetched more than $45 a share just a year before the
company went bankrupt and rendered its stock worthless.


With a 15% stake in Gerald Stevens, the Miami Herald reported (pdf), Berrard’s
investment firm (New River Capital Partners) actually ranked as the biggest loser of all.
Berrard now owns a similar stake in Swisher, records show, which looks incredibly
valuable (pdf) right now. Like Huizenga, records show, Berrard controls 15.4% -- or 25
million shares – of Swisher’s stock, worth more than $220 million at today’s lofty prices.
But Huizenga and Berrard must hold onto that stock for a while, corporate filings show,
while others get a chance to dump mountains of shares first.


Serruya appears to be among the lucky crowd at the front of that line, corporate records
indicate, with he and his brother free to cash in all of those cheap warrants left over from
the CoolBrands deal – and set to expire in November – once the company’s recent
registration statement becomes effective (which could happen at any time). Choice and
other companies issued stock in buyout deals can begin selling this June, records show,
when the lockup restrictions on more than 30 million shares officially ends. Huizenga and
Berrard must sit on the sidelines throughout that potential selling spree, records show,
waiting until next spring to part with a single share.


By the time those restrictions finally expire, some predict, Swisher could fetch a mere
fraction of its current price.


“This is not a particularly great business,” the Value Investors Club emphasized last
month. “There is no clear business logic or synergy to buying small, local bathroom
cleaners in our view …


“As this stock gets more investor attention and people realize what is really going on
here,” the report concluded, “it will likely end up in the toilet well before Huizenga and
Berrard can dump their shares.”

I bought in at $5.90. I will wait it out. I agree with your assessment but I figure I'll wait it out. You never know and with
Wayne's name attached it would be stupid to sell my current position. Also, they are acquiring new businesses every
day!

It must be working since the stock is continuing to fade. Tell me why you would think this company has value.
New shares coming out, current insiders will dump in June, what is the scale benefit from batrhroom cleaing?,
and why would they deserve a valuation out 4-5 times the industry average? 
I understand the successful roll-ups thorugh Waste Management, Blockbuster and Auto Nation. If Wayne is
only lending his name for 19% I'm not so sure their is much to bet on here. Please make a sound financial
case other than a roll-up.

yep, now Missy is just acting for a shill for the shorts. This is the same article she released on another site a week ago
and the shorts have been playing in up big. Since it has not gone done now much they are now hoping re-releasing it
will give them more play.

Swisher is doing it's best clean up the dirtiest business out there- bathrooms, restaurants, buildings and taking
names- literally along the way. I was in SWSH at 6.16 and got out at 11. I'm back in at 7.75 with the belief that this will
be big, really big.

This reporter appears to be an expert historian dredging up unrelated dirt from the past. Maybe when or if she attends
the annual meeting she will we have a clue to a business plan that makes since for the future. After 43 years in the
securities industry, I am sure that the StreetSweeper shorting this stock prior to her article, is a classic case of insider
trading. It appears that the only affiliation she has is to short sellers.

How can somone be so negative on a stock, without being short. 
I am adding a boat load at 6.60. 
I suggest you cover soon. 
Basically your article says as long as Wayne is in your good. 
Thanks for the opportunity to add at a great price. 
Is this somewhat of a spec play based on Wayne's name and past and future performance. 
Yes 
Look at MCP. Total spec play, with no real earnings 
Cover soon

What is the real agenda here...is there any objectivity to this blog? Providing an assessment that is quite negative and
working with StreetWeeper who is actively shorting the stock smells of an ethical issue...someone is making money
by yelling "fire in a crowded theatre." As one poet stated: there is something rotten in Denmark...

around

The company is run by very business-savvy people with excellent reputations. This M. Davis was working at The
Street for Cramer before. She shorted SWSH and then, along with Cramer, they stomped all over it. A typical
scenario. Last week a caller on Cramer asked about SWSH, he had no idea of the company and said he could not
comment. Hang in Longs, this is typical Wall Street smoke and mirrors.

I seems odd to me that two very well respected and sophisticated money managers, Fidelity Management and Sprott
Asset Management along with Bank of Montreal and the Gabelli Group are all invested in this stock. Plus the
principals, Huizenga and Berrard hold over 25 million shares each. Either they are wrong and have not done their due
diligence or Ms. Davis is right about this company. Swisher suceesfully closed a private placement for 9.8 million
shares @ $7.70 on April 15th.


04 May 2011, 07:41 PM


macbeth48
Who owns this stock? Fidelity Management (9.2%); Bank of Montreal Capital Markets (1%) Berard and Huizenga
(16.6% each); Sprott Asset Management; Gamco (Mario Gabelli); Front Street Capital. With the exception of the two
principals these are all well known, highly respected asset managers. With a significant stake in the company the
owners are serious about growing th business. All of the information in the article is public knowledge and has been
for some time. I guess none of the above investors bothered to read it.

This article is well researched and written. I don't care who the principles are, what institutions own it, the numbers do
not add up to valuation of more than 50 cents to $1 per share. Tomorrow they are seeking authorization to issue 1/3
more shares? Well, I guess the Brooklyn Bridge looks like a bargain to someone who can buy it for as cheap as $5.90
a share! LOL.


This stock is a no brainer, as in, you have to have no brain to own ANY of it.

The annual meeting should be a tell. I also note that Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida etc., is on the board of this
company. Street Sweeper seems to be not one of the more visited financial websites. The article was well written yes;
but it was still a biased re-hash of known facts. I have followed Jim Cramer for years, long before he was well known.
We have corresponded in the past. He's a smart guy; but no one can have an informed opinion on every stock on the
board. I bought this one early and have sold enough above $9 to be comfortable. It is a hold.

The only intent of this article( well written or not). Was to pound the hell out of this stock. Scare everyone out, for your
gain 
Its a real sin what some people will do for money. 
Just a great opportunity to add to my investment.

A lot of biased information here. Blockbuster was an industry innovator and was continuously adapting to the
changing market. Blockbuster acquired Spelling Television, Republic Pictures, etc. Blockbuster was in the hunt for
Paramount Pictures. Under the original leadership Blockbuster was poised to be synonymous with entertainment no
matter the delivery vehicle. Blockbuster would have been Netflix, Tivo, etc. 
That all changed after the company was acquired by Viacom. Blockbuster's cash flow was used to purchase
Paramount and CBS. Spelling, Republic, etc. were stripped out and Blockbuster was set adrift on its own with huge
debt.  
I know America's Highways and byways are littered with formerly great companies that failed to adapt. That is not the
case with Blockbuster. A fabulous brand that was deliberately killed.

Brilliant Short Attack, Watching the Short Sales via the LL2 was and time and sales is hilarious. Will today be the
capitulation, only Wayne can tell. Why did those knuckleheads who invested in Swisher pay $79 million for their
shares? Was there a provision that would market to market and revise terms of the placement. Those stupid
institutions and World investors who paid $7.89 a share. What were those guys thinkings? Peace to All!

Wow, this is a really great article and one of the most expensive stocks I've ever seen... Ever.


I refuse to pay 20 times earnings for any stock, much less 20 times sales!!!


Judging from the amount of bullish comments from people with just 1 or 2 total comments, somebody has an agenda.

What amazes me is how this thing is acting like a subpenny stock. I honestly see no value to this stock. Pumping the
CEO, board members....you can't be serious. They are sealing a lot of acquisitions via leveraging. I'm not sure they
can get their own house in order let alone taking on the responsibility for all of these new acquisitions. This is an ultra-
volatile stock that is striking purely up and down without intermediate trends if you remove the noise. I would suggest

you double check your belief in this stock and recount what your trade is based on - these subpenney type

That's well over 3.6 mil, that's real money

After the SEC investigated the former Swisher public company, they found nothing that the company did wrong, only
one little personal tax situation with Pat Swisher. Wayne's accountants were very impressed with the company's
financials, it's why they bought it out. Pat's new Enviro-Master company is recreating the old successful business
model, even better, customers love it, franchise partners have a great long term opportunity!

Best buying opportunity right before earnings....forget about Blockbuster and Waste Management, look at what he did
with Republic Services. At the end of the day- he's using this to get back into the waste business which he is the
KING!!!

Lets not get bogged down with frauds and ethics. The point made by hawkeye, of the valueinvestorsclub, and a tru
master at shorting, is that this company is grossly overvalued. ever hear of mr market? So let's not take this
personally, let's figure out, is there anyway to justify a price of 10 times sales (not earnings) on a company that has
yet to make a nickel? (mind you, at current m.cap its more like 4.5x sales). Also bear in mind that early next year,
many shares are comming off restriction, increasing the float and possibly creating selling pressure. Common sense
please, leave the emoting for facebook.
