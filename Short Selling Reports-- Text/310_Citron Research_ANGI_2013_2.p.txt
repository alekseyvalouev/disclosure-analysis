This Company’s Story of its Path to Profitability  
Does Not Add Up.   





There are lies, damned lies… and Angie’s List 
 


 
 
 
Background 
In Part 1, Citron provided its analysis and opinion that Angie’s List (NASDAQ:ANGI) is not a business, but 
rather merely a stock market artifact left over from Web 1.0.   Established in 1995, Angie’s has never in its 
eighteen year history been profitable.  As promised, this report will explain how ANGI is manipulating their 
numbers to Wall Street to prove that they actually have a better business than they really have – and they still 
lose money … wow, do we live in “interesting times”! 
 
 





The other side of the coin, a listing of page after page of only “Grade A” reviews, in which service providers 
are jacked for “$15,000 to $50,000” for the privilege of being listed on the first-page, is not sustainable.   
 
 
 


   How Does a Company with 15 Years of Operating Losses Chart a 
Path to Profitability?   
 
The core of Angie’s thesis about coming profitability is based on its ability to drastically raise advertising rates 
for service providers.   Here is one sign of this impact emerging in the public eye:  
 


In this piece, Citron publishes a detailed financial critique of the company’s statements about its purported path to 
profitability.

   Numbers Don’t Lie:  Angie’s List Core Thesis -- Establishing 
Recurring Revenue Profitably -- is a Lie 
 


This report zeroes in on the main premise of analysts and fund managers who have built an analysis of a 
profitable future for Angie’s.  Angie’s management has been casting a fictitious future of profits from recurring 
revenues.  The reality is that investors’ money is plowed into bloated phone-room sales expense, which 
consumes all of its current revenues.    
 
Wall Street always loves and rewards recurring revenue, because it promises an income stream that levitates 
from the expense to maintain it – but only if it is truly recurring.  Citron now presents an analysis drawn from 
Angie’s own filed reports and public statements that proves this rosy picture of this future is knowingly false.  
 
The key to the flawed investment thesis in Angie’s List is a false picture of service provider renewal rates, as 
painted by the company.  Citron will now prove the falsity of that presumption.  The company has been 
dancing around this key figure in conference call after conference call.   Citron now lays out the full analysis to 
prove the company’s disclosures cannot be true.  
 


The heart of the bull case investment thesis is this:  While acquisitions of new service 
providers is a breakeven proposition, they renew at rates of 70% or more, and because of 
rate increases, the revenue from existing service providers comes in at 100% or higher, year 
over year, and has an 80% profit margin.   This thesis is now so persuasive to the ANGI bulls 
that they seem inclined to disregard all discussion of the value proposition or legitimacy of 
its business model, and all the red flags that go with that discussion.  So we now challenge 
their thesis head-on.    
 
First, Citron quotes ANGI’s making this claim over and over.  If the above statement is why 
you are an investor in Angie’s list, Citron suggests you read this report … sitting down.   
 


"The last time we priced it, the package they were describing to my IT group was 
somewhere in $12,000 to $15,000 range," said Joyce. 
… 
[ another service provider ] … really thought the site was just performance-based ... 
until he got a call from Angie's List, asking him to advertise:  "It was in excess of 
$50,000 to be ranked above companies that had lower rankings than we did."

Bill Oesterle:  “Yes, so the year one -- essentially year one net contribution is close to a 
push, roughly zero. But once you take into consideration commissions, and then all of 
the allocated service provider marketing, and the overhead of that department, it's 
effectively a push. There's a few points of margin in there.” 
 


 
 --  Q3 2012 Earnings call  


Question -- … So your statement that they renew at over 100% means that heading 
into next year if I use $100 million as a round number, then I'm going to have more 
than $100 million that comes at a margin of 80% or something along those lines? 
 Answer – Bill Oesterle: That is I think a very accurate characterization of how the 
math works. 
 
Question – Jordan Rohan: Okay. And in the past, you said that instead of just over 
100% you've given the number I think pre-IPO and in the prospectus it was 117%. Is 
it significantly over 100% when it renews? Is it greater than 117%, which was a 
publicly stated number? 
 Answer – Bill Oesterle: It's a -- our renewal percentages have been consistent, and 
at times better than consistent this year. So, anything that we have stated remains 
true.  
 
Question – Jordan Rohan: Okay. So if I use $100 million and consistent or better 
would get me to something over $117 million that has an 80% contribution roughly? 
Plus whatever you – right, next you're at a push for originated business? 
Answer – Bill Oesterle: I don't hear anything in the logic there that we would need to 
correct.

 Quarter 2012 Conference call 


" And so our service provider renewal rates are right around -- all in, around 70% -- 65% 
to 70%, depending on the time of year. 


--  Bill Oesterle, Angie’s List CEO 
BAML Tech Conference  6/7/2012
Citron reports on Angie’s List Part II June 12, 2013 Page 4 of 15 
 


 
 
So if service providers renew at a rate of 65% or 70%, after one year, 30% or 35% are leaving.  And having run 
for the exits, we don’t think those folks will be back so fast, either.  But let’s not quibble about the churn rate 
the company has steadfastly refused to disclose.  Let’s look at the decisive metric, which is dollar renewals.    
 
The problem is that Angies’ claim doesn’t hold up to its own disclosed financial statements.  Below Citron 
presents results from a basic analysis to apply these rates to Angie’s filed operating results.      
 
The arithmetic is straightforward.  It takes the company’s disclosed numbers, as well as the all-important 
guidance of percentage dollar revenue growth on renewals, and tries to tie them to the numbers disclosed 12 
months later.  The churn rate used comes directly from the company’s comments about churn.    


We have become increasingly sophisticated with that and that is manifesting itself in 
our ability to price optimally.  Occasionally service providers don't like that. We were 
driving price increases through the recession, this is 2009,  2010, we were driving 
50%, 60% contract price increases with the service companies because we deserved it 
because we had all those additional households to sell them, and in 2009 and 2010 it 
was pretty difficult to explain to a service company that your – the contract price is 
going up 60%, 70% but we were able to do it because we had the product to do it and 
as a result of that our dollar renewal rate continued to be well above the 100% from 
the service providers. So when we originate a contract, in year two it's likely to 
originate at something well over 100% because they're buying additional households 
and additional services that makes it whole lot easier to keep up with the member 
growth rate, when you're able to drive contract increases the way that we have over 
last couple of years.

Walk-through on the above table:   
We start with the total service provider revenue for the first quarter 2011 [A],  and 2012 [L],  
project it forward for the following year, by multiplying it by the 117% “dollar renewal rate” per company 
guidance at [B] / [M]. 
That lets us calculate the new service provider revenue by subtraction at [C] / [N] … 
Then the gross profit and cost of renewals based on the company provided margin of 80% at [D] / [O];  
then by subtraction, the remaining costs, which were to spent acquire new service providers at [E] / [P] .   
We then subtract to generate the LOSSES on acquiring new service providers at [F] and [Q].   
And these are just the direct costs – the G&A expenses are not allocated in this analysis!  
 
Using the higher threshold 150%, we repeat with [G], [H], [I], [J] and [K], and of course the loss on new service 
providers is even greater, as it is in 2012 referring to [R], [S], [T], [U], and [V].   
 
For both years, this analysis disproves the company’s core sustainability of new revenue claim that it can 
break even on new service providers while generating 80% margins on renewals at rates over 100%.  These 


new revenues are coming at a high price.  The company has been burning money acquiring new 
service providers (3 to 5 million at 117% renewal, or 5 to 7 million at 150% renewal) in every 
single quarter over the last two years, in direct contradiction to every comment they have 
made to analysts on the topic.   
 
 


    Citron conclusion #1:  
 





The preceding analysis proves that the company’s characterization of its core revenue 
model is untruthful, and has been misleading over the span of at least the last 8 quarters, 
compared to company officers’ statements in conference calls.  
 
Either the company is nowhere near break-even on new business, or renewal margin for 
service providers far less than 80%.   The company’s own numbers disprove it.  All the 
analysts’ forecasting models are wrong.
Citron reports on Angie’s List Part II June 12, 2013 Page 7 of 15 
 


  Eye-Popping and Unsustainable Service Provider Rate Increases  
Next, we use the same year-to-year analysts to look at average service provider revenue, from the number of service 
providers disclosed.   Again, it’s simple math, just follow the arrows from year to year, multiplying by the percentages 
given by the company in conference calls.    
 
We increase the Service Provider renewal revenue based on the percentages provided to the analysts, and make a 
reasonable estimate as to the SP renewal rate.   This lets us calculate a rate increase for the renewing service provider 
cohort.  ( * SP = Service Provider )

   Citron Conclusion #2: 
 





If we use the company’s claim of breakeven year 1 on service providers, a 64% churn 
and a 117% or 150% dollar renewal, the preceding analysis proves that the company 
is imposing high double-digit or even triple digit rate increases on service provider 
renewals -- at least 70%, and as high as 120% if its renewal income disclosures are to 
be believed.   Clearly this is not sustainable … and contextualizes the news story 
linked above regarding the outrageous $15,000 to $50,000 placement fees being 
investigated by a local TV station.   
 
For service providers who absorb that 70% rate increase as part of the year 2 cohort, 
what happens when they get hit with another 70% rate increase in year 3?   Clearly 
aggressive year 2 rate increases rope in Service Providers who feel they have 
“invested” in positive reviews to become noticed on Angie’s List.  But as the Service 
providers are met with steep listing fee increases, combined with demands for 
discounts, 1/3


rd
 are bailing immediately.  The ones that stay on create a new cohort:  


what was a run of the mill expense is now double or more, a real line item cost.  
Service providers are going to be a lot more careful in year 3 evaluating this cost.  
Even more will churn out.  As Angie’s List revenues come more and more from 
service providers and less from member subscriptions, what is the threshold at 
which Service Providers dump Angie’s List for better ROI on advertising dollars?   
 
Is Angie’s List pricing model at risk of being perceived as a bait-and-switch scheme 
by legitimate service providers?  The sustainability of these rate increases cannot be 
determined without a churn rate by cohort – and Angie’s doesn’t provide it.    


"He really thought the site was just performance-based... until he got a call from 
Angie's List, asking him to advertise: 


"It was in excess of $50,000 to be ranked above companies that had lower 
rankings than we did."

  Free Memberships:  Fact vs Fiction 
When Angie’s List enters a new market, it discloses it offers free memberships “for a few months” … 
sometimes referring to this number as “de minimis”:   
From Q1 2013 10-Q: 


 
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-LKYTL/2450519471x0xS1437749-13-4711/1491778/filing.pdf 


 
Compare this to the Cohort Analysis from the August 25, 2011 S-1:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1491778/000119312511232387/ds1.htm 
So while Angie’s is disclosing “Membership Revenue / Paid Membership, it doesn’t include monthly members 
nor does it include free memberships.   
 
Yet, analysis of individual markets indicates free memberships appear to be a lot more common than “de 
minimis” would suggest, and hang around a lot longer than “a few months.  Per their website, there is a 
selection that displays pricing in any zip code:   http://my.angieslist.com/angieslist/visitor/price.aspx 
 
For instance, you can enter 98801 – Wenatchee WA, and get pricing of zero:   
 


 
 
You can go here, enter [98801] and see they entered the Wenatchee WA market in February 2012, and it’s 
still free – 16 months later.   http://business.angieslist.com/Visitor/AngiesList101/Locations/

…  And who knows how many more ... 
 
Free multi-year subscriber memberships on Angie’s List are not “de minimis”, they appear to be common.  
Meanwhile, Angie’s list is arguing to its service providers that they should pay up for better display ranking in 
their list, and “zone down” to more precise zip codes.  But in all the areas where membership is free or almost 
free, are they misrepresenting the value of service providers paying up?   
 
If they weren’t adding free members in large numbers, why would their average revenues per membership be 
declining so rapidly?   
 
 
 


   Citron Conclusion #3:  Lying to Service Providers about Number of 
Paid Members  
 








Angie’s List is building its subscriber base using a lot more free subscriptions than it 
discloses.  And it is justifying higher service provider advertising fees based on its claims 
about the growing number of paid subscribers.  These claims are in severe conflict.

Meanwhile, the company continues to loudly proclaim its growth in “paid memberships”, but the numbers of such 
“paid members” is barely able to keep pace with the falling membership subscription rates.

    Citron Conclusion #4:  Declining average subscription rates imply 
bottom of the barrel geographies, increasing numbers of free subscriptions, and 
the end of the rainbow.

In our last report, Citron spotlighted HomeAdvisor.com, which runs a lead generation / service provider 
referral business the right way:  by independently verifying business licensing, performing criminal, bankruptcy 
and other background checks on applying service providers, and providing competitive quotes with a single 
request.   
 
Citron now compares Angie’s List to the business model that it had a 15 year head-start and should have 
adopted long before now.  ReachLocal (NASDAQ:RLOC) has a business model that sports an intelligent 
approach to qualifying service providers, establishing long-term value add relationships with them, and 
connecting them to consumers in the most cost-effective ways.  The thoughtfulness of this approach puts 
Angie’s List to utter shame.   
 
We’ll leave the comparisons for the serious investors who have read this far, but leave you with this table: 
 


 ReachLocal (RLOC) Angie’s List (ANGI) 


Revenues  473.17 m 176.88 m 


Market Cap  423.70 million 1.50 billion 


Price / Sales  .90 8.25 
 


At a similar Price/Sales ratio as ReachLocal.com, ANGI would be $3 per share.  


How are we to believe that average service provider revenue can climb sustainably at 
70% - 120% per year while average membership subscription rate is declining over a four 
year timespan, approaching half its rate of just 4 years ago?   
 
Angie’s sales pitch to service providers renewing contracts at higher rates is predicated 
on increasing number of paid subscribers.  But if large numbers of these turn out to be 
free… the service providers won’t continue to renew, and won’t pay up for 
advertisements , because their results aren’t supported by a larger and ever-more 
motivated membership.     
 
Plus large numbers of free subscribers, as well as monthly subscribers, are not even 
counted in these average revenue per subscriber figures…

  Do This Math!   
According to CEO Oesterle, There are approximately 300,000 eligible (“A” and “B” rated service providers) 
nationally.

In Angie’s telesales room, 500 of the 750 telemarketers are assigned to get new service providers to sign up.  
So if each of the 500 telemarketers makes 50 calls a day (a fairly modest load), they entire new service 
provider solicitation team is calling 125,000 service providers a week.  So if the maximum A and B list 
candidates are double what they now list, they’re each getting pinged with an outbound call every two-and-a-
half weeks.  No wonder former Angie’s List employees are saying their biggest problem is “not enough 
prospects left to call”.   And it also explains Angie’s new program: offering to call Service Providers own 
customers, to survey them about completed jobs, and writing the service provider review for the subscriber 
…another highly questionable ethical stance that is an early tell of saturation.

And the disclosure of which reviews are the “real” ones written by real people, and prose written by a 


telemarketer from phone survey results?  This isn’t disclosed to the subscribers!   
 
 


      Conclusion 
This report details the fallacy of Angie’s List core management premise regarding the promise of upcoming 
profitability:  That Service Providers can be added on a breakeven basis, and renew at 117% of year-one 
revenue and 80% gross margins, simply cannot be true.  It doesn’t bear out in the last 8 quarters of the 
company’s reported financials.  And Angie’s management must know this...better than anyone. 
 
Further, this model depends on renewing service providers to take year-after-year 70% to 125% revenue 
increases to overcome the 1/3


rd
 of new service providers who churn out after year 1.  But who replaces the 


ones who churn out after year 2?   
 
Citron challenges any analyst or the company’s new CFO (the third one in the last 3 years?!?) to either defend 
all the above statements or restate the company’s description of its revenue model for service providers.  And 
while they are at it, an unambiguous statement about churn rates would be much appreciated.  
 
Meanwhile, subscription revenue as a percentage of gross revenues has been falling every year, and clearly is 
now just a scant 18% of gross revenues.  Subscriber numbers are being used primarily as an argument to 
induce service providers to advertise, but the loyalty of subscribers to Angie’s brand name is now apparently 
weaker than ever.   


Bill Oesterle:  “"We have ratings on something like 2 million companies, and yet there 
are only 300,000 companies that are eligible (to advertise) because of their grade and 
the number of current reports," Oesterle said..” 


 -- Bill Oesterle, CEO

You financial analysts should already know that the $10 million Angie’s List claimed it generated from 
operations was not a function of profits, but rather a one-time adjustment, due to a change in the schedule of 
sales force compensation – which went from paid whole at the time of contract sale, to paid ratably over the 
course of the contract.   So this “cash” is merely a one-time adjustment, not a sustainable cash source --  
Angie’s still owes the sales people.  They simply generated a cash adjustment, and increased their liabilities to 
offset it.  Book value is now negative $100,000.   
 
So aside from temporarily manipulating expenses to eke out a small profit for a quarter or two, who will step 
up and demonstrate a model that justifies a $1.6 Billion dollar market cap without commensurate profits, 
and a path to achieving it that is anything more than fiction?   
 
The collapse in performance will appear over time.   The low member renewal rate in the 70% - 75% range 
means a new customer doesn’t break even for five or six years … and it is likely that former members churned 
out will not readily return to the fold.   Meanwhile, annual advertising increases of 75% - 125% on service 
providers may have caught a one-time updraft, but can’t possibly be sustainable either.  It remains Citron’s 
opinion that service providers will churn out at increasing rates as further renewals won’t be cost justified, and 
other competitors gain traction.   
 
In fact, Angie’s needs to track and report service provider churn rates for the first renewal-after-big-rate-
increase cohort  -- 12 months after these extraordinary rate increases, as their entire story depends on the 
sustainability of these rates.  Don’t hold your breath.
