HCI Group 10-K Review: The Fading Magic Of The Wizards Of Tampa
Mar. 27, 2015 1:35 PM ET3 comments
by: RH Analytics


Summary


Despite y/y declines in both profits and the stock price, overall compensation
expense continues to rise.


Share buybacks consumed 9.1% of book value in the year.


Management makes good on its determination to become the Berkshire on the bay
by funding a strip mall development and what appears to be a private BDC.


HCI carries immense catastrophic risk, has a declining core business, and
management intent on spending increasingly expensive capital.


It is becoming increasingly difficult to see why the stock should maintain its generous
valuation.


A review of the HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) 2014 10-K indicates business as usual in some
respects. The company continues to pursue financial transactions we consider of dubious
value, and compensation is still rising. Although the stock currently retains a handsome
valuation, we believe it will be difficult to maintain. HCI carries significant catastrophic risk,
has a declining core business, and will likely continue to spend as it searches for a
business model. When this is more apparent to the market, we hope investors become
more critical of the uses of capital and less generous with valuation.


Book Value - Erosion and Vulnerability


HCI repurchased a total of 990,701 shares during the year for a total of $38.35M including
fees. In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 256,324 shares for $10.56M. Share
buybacks at multiples above 1x book, erodes shareholder equity. We used the repurchase
figures to estimate the amount of equity HCI destroyed with the purchases.

During 4Q14, we estimate that share buyback's cost shareholders $0.57 per share or
3.1% of book value. Over the course of 2014, buybacks cost shareholders $1.84 or 9.3%
of book value. Moreover, the purchases are funded, in part, by $129.5M in long-term debt,
which cost shareholders $10.5M in interest expense 2014.


Loss Reserves


In our original research on HCI, we calculated that the company was probably under-
reserving for losses. The loss development schedule from the 10-K shows that initial
estimates for 2013 losses were quite low. The original estimate for 2013 was $43.69M;
one-year later, the estimate had risen $3.66M or 8.4% to $47.34M. In our view, this
represents a significant deviance from the estimates, particularly as 2013 was a very
benign storm year.


In a departure from standard practice, HCI does not use company loss experience in
estimating its exposure. The company uses industry data from A.M. Best's Aggregate and
Averages - Property/Casualty United States & Canada. HCI states that it uses industry
data because its loss experience is limited. The company also states that it assumes that
its loss development patters will be reasonably consistent with industry averages. It's
difficult to believe either of the two statements are true. We think 8-years of experience
with a book concentrated in south Florida likely constitutes a deep data set. Further, the
singular risk exposure of Florida carriers makes loss patterns in the state very different
from industry averages.


HCI's methods are apparently acceptable to their actuary and the OIR. However, two
things make us question them: we cannot find another company who does the same; and,
in our view, the reasons given for the methods do not make sense. We are left questioning
why the company would cling to methods that appear out of step with industry standards.

Investments


The 10-K indicates that HCI made two commitments in 2H14. In September the company
entered into a joint venture to develop a shopping center in Melbourne, Florida. As of
year-end, the company contributed $4.5M to the venture. Total future commitments are
not disclosed.


Following the document trail indicates that the joint venture partner is likely BishopBeale,
an Orlando, Florida based real estate company. The project is probably Pineda Landings,
which appears to be a strip-mall type shopping center with The Fresh Market as the
anchor tenant.


The 10-K also shows that HCI has made a commitment to invest $12.5M for a 16.5%
interest in a limited partnership that makes loans to lower middle-market companies. The
company has an unfunded capital balance of $9.86M. The LP is, in essence, a business
development company or BDC. To our knowledge, the BDC investment was not disclosed
previously to the 10-K.


HCI is following through on CEO Paresh Patel's statement that it would diversify out of
insurance. The overall investment strategy can be viewed alternatively as either emulating
Warren Buffett or throwing things against the wall and seeing what sticks, depending on
your viewpoint.


Compensation


2014 was an eventful year in some respects for HCI. The company's stock ended 2014 at
$43.24, down $10.26 or -19.2% from the 2013 closing price of $53.50. On the 4Q14
conference call, Mr. Patel announced that the days of takeouts from Citizens were at a
close. This basically implies that HCI's business model is disappearing. Finally, net income
for 2014 declined -4.4% from $65.6M to $62.7M. Yet, despite the challenging environment,
compensation increased. The table below shows compensation figures taken from the
company's 10-K.

As indicated above, compensation expenses increased $4.55M or 22.7% in 2014. The 10-
K notes that some of the increase is due to a higher headcount. Some, however, is due to
higher stock-based compensation. HCI's January 28, 2015 8-K revealed that CEO Paresh
Patel was scheduled to receive a cash bonus of $3.125M. Cash bonuses were down
marginally year over year. We will have a better view on total executive compensation
when the proxy comes out.


Conclusion


In some respects, our review of the 10-K shows more of the same. Troubling questions
regarding loss reserves remain; the company continues to pursue book value destroying
buybacks. Management also appears to be determined to remake HCI into a kind of mini-
conglomerate by deploying its cash into business ranging from real estate development to
software and middle-market lending. It is hard to see how shareholders benefit. We
believe the problematic aspects of HCI will become more obvious to investors when top-
line erosion increases and business challenges become more evident.


Investors have been generous, affording the stock a multiple of 2.5x book value. We
consider the multiple particularly lofty given that HCI seems to be a company in search of
a business model. As a company carrying substantial catastrophic risk facing core
business decline, we believe the stock warrants and will eventually receive a far lower
multiple.

Another good follow on to your ongoing HCI series. I think Patel's comments that the take-outs have largely been
exhausted will serve as a meaningful catalyst in upcoming quarters to drive this pig lower. This can't go on forever
and I don't see much upside.

Also, mgmt comp is ridiculous. Love the fact last year it was based on a significant decline in EBITDA. Also, the share
buybacks are some of the worst I think I've ever seen. This is capital destruction at its finest.

Bluegrass Holdings
Post from July 16 (I was correct on Q2 earnings beat):


I've been in and out of this stock since 2011, when I first bought warrants that went up 1000% in 3 months and then
rode the stock up another 100%. 
It got fairly valued at one point and I moved on. Happy to come back and find it severely undervalued again and still,
obviously from the short comments, very misunderstood. This is about the easiest company I've ever analyzed and I
know middle schoolers that would realize this is a no-brainer.


The third quarter is normalized earnings for these "4th quarter takeout" companies and with no storms, my back of the
napkin math shows HCI can make $1.60ish/share in the third quarter (they'll easily beat the current Q2 estimate, FYI.
And did one of these shorts put in the estimates for Q3 or something? Total joke.). I haven't studied the new
reinsurance contract, but I'm comfortable this management did the right things and so the costs are similar to last
year.


Multiply that by 4 and you get annual earnings of $6.4/share. A conservative investor pays 10x earnings. A huge
storm would wipe out one year of earnings (the shorts don't seem to understand reinsurance), so maybe a real
stickler would pay 8-9x for this. But with the way this management always seems to find growth and the fairly
consistent, temporary earnings from any takeouts 10x is reasonable.


I'll see you around $60 if Mother Nature is good to us again this year!
