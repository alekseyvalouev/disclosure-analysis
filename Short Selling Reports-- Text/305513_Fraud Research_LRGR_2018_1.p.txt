Luminar	Media:	A	'Shell	Risk'	Stock	Inflated	By	False	And	Misleading
Information

Summary


OTCMarkets.com	recently	added	a	"Shell	Risk"	designation	to	LRGR,	noting	a
Company	with	no	or	nominal	operations.


No	recent	company	news	or	business	developments	to	justify	the	short-term	share
price	increase.


The	only	explanation	we	can	find	to	explain	the	recent	+470%	move	is	a	penny	stock
promotion	newsletter	featuring	LRGR.


The	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign	featuring	LRGR	contains	a	substantial
amount	of	false	and	misleading	information.


Luminar	Media	Group	(OTCPK:LRGR)	has	been	one	of	the	top	performing	stocks	in	the
small	cap	market	during	the	month	of	April,	soaring	by	as	much	as	473%	during	the	past
few	weeks.	However,	with	no	recent	company	announcements	or	business	developments
reported,	we	believe	that	the	only	explanation	for	the	recent	stock	price	movement	is	an
ongoing	paid	stock	promotion	campaign	whereby	a	penny	stock	newsletter	is	spreading
information	disseminated	by	email	that	appears	both	false	and	misleading.


If	our	thesis	is	correct	and	LRGR	shares	are	inflated	due	to	the	current	promotional
campaign,	then	we	believe	that	it	is	only	a	matter	of	time	before	shares	collapse.
Specifically,	we	expect	the	stock	to	decline	by	90-99%	during	2018.


We	have	raised	all	of	our	concerns	published	in	this	report	with	the	issuer,	but	they	have
been	unwilling	to	provide	additional	comments	besides	referring	us	to	the	filings	and
disclosure	section	of	OTCMarkets.com.


About	The	Company


Luminar	Media	was	originally	established	as	part	of	the	Chapter	11	Reorganization	of
Spicy	Gourmet	Organics	on	December	30,	2010.	As	part	of	the	reorganization,	5	million
warrants	were	issued	in	Bankruptcy	Court	that	are	exercisable	into	shares	of	common

stock	with	a	$0.05	conversion	price	(2.8	million	warrants	still	convertible	as	of	December
31,	2017).


The	Company	was	formerly	named	Golden	Edge	Entertainment,	Inc.	and	intended	to
enter	the	music	production	business	but	was	unable	to	generate	any	operating	revenue.


On	August	30,	2016,	the	Company	announced	an	amendment	to	its	articles	of
incorporation	and	disclosed	a	corporate	name	change	to	Luminar	Media	Group,
Incorporated.


Luminar	does	not	appear	to	have	any	significant	current	business	operations.	The
Company's	most	recent	Annual	Report	discloses	that	its	100%	owned	subsidiary,	Big	Data
Media,	LLC,	was	incorporated	in	Delaware	on	June	1,	2016.	However,	we	were	unable	to
identify	any	company	website	for	Big	Data	Media,	LLC,	and	the	subsidiary	is	not
mentioned	on	Luminar's	website.	In	fact,	the	"About"	section	of	luminarinc.com	does	not
contain	any	information	and	simply	redirects	website	visitors	back	to	the	homepage.	The
website's	"Company	News"	page	contains	an	error	message	and	only	displays	three
headlines	related	to	a	licensing	agreement	with	Jenex	Corporation	that	was	terminated	by
Jenex	on	September	27,	2017,	for	non-payment	of	certain	fees	due	under	the	agreement.


The	Description	of	Current	Business	section	outlined	in	a	recent	LRGR	corporate	filing	is
extremely	vague	and	does	not	discuss	any	products	or	services	for	sale	nor	does	it
discuss	any	specific	products	or	services	in	development:


Prior	to	the	opening	bell	on	April	21,	2018,	OTCMarkets.com	updated	the	LRGR	Company
Overview	page	with	a	"Shell	Risk"	warning,	noting	the	Company	as	possibly	having	no	or
nominal	operations	as	determined	by	OTC	Markets	based	on	public	disclosures.

The	Company	previously	disclosed	being	a	shell	company	in	the	2014	Annual	Report	and
based	on	their	own	description,	it	appears	that	one	could	argue	that	Luminar	Media	may
still	be	characterized	as	a	shell	company:


We	have	emailed	the	issuer	requesting	clarification	on	the	company's	current	operations,
and	they	have	been	unwilling	to	elaborate.	Rather,	Chairman	&	CEO	Christopher	Cook
referred	us	to	their	most	recent	filings	and	provided	no	further	details.

Despite	no	recent	corporate	updates	besides	the	corporate	filings,	no	historical	revenue
and	no	assets	besides	$9,595	"advances"	on	the	balance	sheet,	the	stock	has
skyrocketed	by	as	much	as	473%	during	April	2018	on	high	relative	volume.


In	our	opinion,	the	recent	price	movement	is	attributed	to	an	ongoing	stock	promotion
campaign	written	by	a	penny	stock	newsletter	that	contains	copious	amounts	of	false	and
misleading	information	about	the	issuer.


Past	Stock	Promotions	Featuring	Luminar	Media


Promotion	Campaign	#1:	August	2015


The	current	stock	promotion	is	not	the	first	time	that	Luminar	Media	has	been	promoted	by
penny	stock	newsletters.	During	the	summer	of	2015,	Luminar	Media	was	subjected	to	a
stock	promotion	campaign	when	it	traded	as	Golden	Edge	Entertainment	(GDEE).	After
weeks	of	dormancy,	shares	soared	from	$0.51	to	a	high	of	$4.52.


(Author's	Note:	the	stock	chart	above	depicts	prices	adjusted	to	reflect	the	1-for-40
reverse	stock	split	previously	disclosed)


Although	the	Company	issued	several	press	releases	during	the	promotional	campaign,
there	were	no	significant	business	developments	reported.	Since	the	primary	catalyst	for
the	stock	price	movement	was	the	promotion	itself	and	not	intrinsic	business
developments,	the	stock	quickly	retraced	and	gave	back	all	gains.	Specifically,	after
shares	peaked	on	August	19,	2015,	they	fell	by	as	much	as	88%	within	three	trading	days.

Promotion	Campaign	#2:	Spring	2017


(Author's	Note:	the	stock	chart	above	depicts	prices	adjusted	to	reflect	the	1-for-40
reverse	stock	split	previously	disclosed)


On	March	30,	2017,	another	stock	promotion	campaign	featuring	Luminar	Media
launched.	In	total,	we	received	75	promotional	emails	featuring	LRGR	between	March
30th	and	May	28th,	2017,	in	the	email	account	used	for	tracking	stock	promotion	emails:

Many	of	these	emails	touted	Luminar	Media's	licensing	and	marketing	agreement	with
Jenex	Corporation	that	was	later	terminated.	During	this	campaign,	LRGR	shares	jumped
from	about	$0.45	to	$0.95	and	then	subsequently	fell	by	as	much	as	73%	within	eight
trading	days	after	peaking.


Current	Stock	Promotion	Campaign


Presently,	a	third	party	that	operates	websites	including,	but	not	necessarily	limited	to,
ExpertPennyStockAlerts.com,	is	promoting	Luminar	Media	shares	via	email	newsletter.
Based	on	emails	forwarded	to	us	by	a	colleague,	it	appears	that	emails	were	first	received
on	April	11,	2018,	the	exact	date	when	the	trading	volume	began	to	spike:

(Author's	Note:	We	captured	the	screenshot	above	from	an	email	that	was	forwarded	to	us
by	a	colleague	who	has	received	numerous	promotional	emails	featuring	LRGR.	The
above	image	does	not	contain	the	entire	email	transcript	and	is	used	to	illustrate	the	false
and	misleading	information	being	disseminated)


What	is	most	concerning	about	the	current	stock	promotion	campaign	is	that	Luminar
Media	has	never	disclosed	being	in	the	"Artificial	Intelligence	(AI)"	or	"drone	systems"
industries	and	does	not	employ	a	team	of	engineers	and	developers.	Similar	false	and
misleading	information	is	littered	throughout	the	emails	we	have	reviewed.	For	example:


"Undervalued	startup	that	has	solutions	for	some	of	the	largest	problems	plaguing
news	networks"
"LRGR	has	found	a	way	to	combat	[fake	news]	to	keep	its	drone	system	trustworthy"
"It	wants	to	fit	its	AI	network	with	a	blockchain	system"
"LRGR's	platform	could	eventually	even	be	used	by	law	enforcement,	the	military,	and
countless	other	organizations."


At	the	very	bottom	of	the	promotional	email,	a	legal	disclaimer	discloses	that	the
newsletter	has	been	compensated	$8,000	cash	via	bank	wire	by	a	third	party,	White	Box
Advisors	Advertising,	Ltd.	to	conduct	investor	relations	advertising	and	marketing	for
Luminar	Media	Group,	Inc.:

We	have	raised	our	concerns	with	the	issuer	regarding	the	false	and	misleading
information	presented	in	the	promotional	emails	featuring	LRGR	but	have	not	received	a
response.


Conclusion


After	the	publication	of	our	most	recent	report	outlining	OneLife	Technologies
(OTC:OLMM),	the	stock	fell	by	as	much	as	93%	within	three	trading	days.	In	fact,	every
penny	stock	that	we	have	previously	reported	on	that	was	subjected	to	a	stock	promotion
campaign	fell	substantially,	and	we	believe	that	Luminar	Media	Group	will	be	no	different.


Luminar	Media	has	not	issued	a	news	release	in	over	one	year.	Furthermore,	they	have
no	non-cash	assets	and	have	never	generated	any	revenues.	By	all	accounts,	it	appears
that	Luminar	is	arguably	a	shell	company.	The	only	explanation	for	LRGR's	recent	unusual
activity	that	we	can	identify	is	the	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign	that	contains	large
amounts	of	false	and	misleading	information.	Once	the	current	promotion	ends,	we	are
convinced	that	LRGR	shares	will	fall	by	90-99%.


Disclosure:	I/we	have	no	positions	in	any	stocks	mentioned,	but	may	initiate	a	short	position	in	LRGR	over	the	next	72
hours.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than
from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.


Editor's	Note:	This	article	discusses	one	or	more	securities	that	do	not	trade	on	a	major
U.S.	exchange.	Please	be	aware	of	the	risks	associated	with	these	stocks.
