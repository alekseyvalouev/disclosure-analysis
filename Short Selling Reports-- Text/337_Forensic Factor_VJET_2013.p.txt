Voxeljet - Printing Red Flags In All Dimensions

by: The Forensic Factor


There has been no shortage of "bubble callers" during the stock market boom of 2013.
Many of those Chicken Littles are either naïve or missing the relative value of equities
when compared to other asset classes. However, 3D printing stocks appear to be in a
bubble, driven by Wall Street hype, good stories, and a scarcity of perceived growth
stocks. Earlier this year, a range of financial publications, from Barron's to Reuters to
Morningstar, highlighted the exuberance of 3D stocks. The market leaders, Stratasys
(NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) are up 97% and 216% respectively over
the last 12 months, despite earnings outlooks that are relatively unchanged. But it isn't the
leaders that market observers should focus on to identify a bubble. It is the "me-too"
companies that have flimsy fundamentals, relying instead on stories created by bankers
and analysts to capture the minds of speculators. Amazon.com was overvalued in 1999,
but it has undeniably maintained its leadership role transforming e-commerce. Webvan
and Pets.com are much more indicative of the low quality "me-too" companies that come
public at asinine valuations in the latter stages of a bubble, only to crash when
fundamentals matter again. We believe recent IPO Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) will be seen
over time as the Webvan of the 3D printing bubble. While the valuation of Voxeljet is
beyond any rational framework, our negative stance is driven predominantly by the
misrepresentations of its selling model and other forensic issues. It is our belief that
Voxeljet has at least 75% downside to $16.79 per share.


Unlike the dot.com blow-ups, which were in many cases IPOs based on unproven
PowerPoints, Voxeljet actually has historical results indicative of an unimpressive financial
and operating model. With a market cap comfortably over $1 billion, and 2013 sales
guidance of only €11 million, Voxeljet trades at a dot.com-like 70x revenue. Voxeljet's
stock is up nearly 500% since pricing its IPO last month and has doubled in November
alone. At its most recent price of $65.00, it is the most expensive 3D printing stock,
despite possessing the slowest growth profile of its comparable set, and a myriad of
questionable practices we will discuss in this report.


To be clear, we do appreciate the 3D hype and in no way are we suggesting the potential
for 3D manufacturing is overstated. Stratasys is a fine company, while 3D Systems has
built impressive scale with 40+ acquisitions over the last five years. Stratasys and 3D
Systems will probably be around in a few years should the 3D "revolution" materialize.

However, Voxeljet, like Webvan thirteen years ago, appears to be nothing more than a
story. In the words of 3D Printing Industry, the leading global resource for 3D printing,
Voxeljet appears to be a bubble, with significant financial risk for traders and investors.


Below we discuss many topics, including our belief that Voxeljet completely
misrepresented its third quarter printer sales. Based on disclosures found in its 11/14/13
earnings 6K, we believe that Voxeljet did not sell one printer in the third quarter at arm's
length. While not fraudulent per se, Voxeljet management failed to disclose on its earnings
call that all three printers sold in Q3'13 were either financed by Voxeljet, or booked as
revenue with future payments to be made in services. The unorthodox sales all appear to
have occurred despite correspondence just one month earlier with the SEC stating
Voxeljet does not rely on vendor financed sales. Voxeljet management also seemed to
misrepresent its change in other operating expense on its Q3'13 call in response to a
question from a sellside analyst. Given the potential severity of these issues, we emailed
management after its earnings call but have yet to hear back with nearly a week having
passed (we tried calling IR as well). Should we hear back from management, we will
gladly provide the response in a new post or InstaBlog.


We believe Voxeljet has extremely limited intellectual property and R&D, as evidenced by
expenditures that do not seem to reconcile with publicly disclosed headcounts. Further, it
appears competitor ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) can impose restrictions on Voxeljet
manufacturing based on a 2003 patent agreement, which the SEC requested Voxeljet
disclose in its Registration statement. We also believe that Voxeljet's unusual past
payments to its CFO's company need to be clarified, while other transactions are more
reminiscent of the U.S.-listed Chinese debacles of the last five years (including paying the
CFO for his art collection at Voxeljet's headquarters and purchasing materials from the
CEO's brother). We believe it is only a matter of time before the retail-driven
momentum runs its course. When Voxeljet finally trades on fundamentals, it will
likely trade at a steep discount to its 3D comparables based on many of the issues
we discuss herein. Should Voxeljet simply trade in line with its 3D comparables, the
stock price would be $16.79, representing 75% downside. If Voxeljet traded at a
more likely 25% discount to its comparable group, the stock would face 79%
downside.


1) Voxeljet is a 3rd tier manufacturer


Voxeljet has very little mind share in the real world of 3D printing. According to a Discern
survey released on 11/15/13, Voxeljet was not even one of the top eighteen 3D printing
companies listed with an Intent to Buy. We would encourage anybody interested in the 3D

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 3/37


printing space to contact Discern directly. Survey participants were asked a number of
questions, including which printers/manufacturers and service bureau/paid parts have they
used, as well as questions about materials. Discern's survey was quite extensive and the
results serve to confirm our belief that Voxeljet is not relevant to the 3D printing landscape.
Per Discern's survey, respondents in the 3D printing community listed the following 3D
companies they intend to use:


Stratasys, 3D Systems, Materialise, Blue Printer, Solidoodle, Botmill, ExOne, Fortus ,
MakerBot , Solidscape, EnvisionTEC, Ultimaker, Printrbot, UP!, Shapeways, Ponoko,
Solid Concepts, and Sculpteo.


We counted eighteen different 3D printing companies/service bureaus, yet Voxeljet did not
appear one time in the published survey.


It is not just prospective buyers ignoring Voxeljet. The publicly-traded 3D competitors also
seem to have very little concern for Voxeljet. In the most recent annual reports from
Stratasys, 3D Systems, ExOne and Arcam, there were twelve companies listed as
competitors across the four filings (several have since been acquired by SSYS and DDD):


· 3D Systems Corporation


· CMET


· EOS Optronics GmbH


· EnvisionTEC GmbH


· Z Corporation


· Stratasys Inc


· Solidscape, Inc.


· Objet Ltd.


· Solid Model Ltd.


· MTT


· Concept Laser


· ExOne

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 4/37


Voxeljet was not listed as a competitor in one filing from any of the four publicly-traded 3D
printing companies. Perhaps this is because Voxeljet does not look, or act, like a 3D
printing company. In the most recently completed calendar year, Voxeljet only grew its
revenues by 20%. Voxeljet's growth significantly lagged the 30% growth experienced by
the 3D industry, as reported by Wohler's Associates in its oft-cited 2012 3D Industry
Report. This paltry growth is even more disappointing considering the law of small
numbers. In 2012, the company only registered €8.7 million of revenue. The number of
printers Volxejet sold in 2012 (6), as well as the lack of growth in printers sold (0%), is
completely incongruous with a dynamic 3D printing company. In 2011, Voxeljet sold 6
printers. In 2012, Voxeljet also sold just 6 printers. Through the first 9 months of 2013,
Voxeljet has again only sold 6 printers (including one used printer). Further, we will show
later that at least three of the printers sold in 2013 required Voxeljet to finance the
purchases or accept services in lieu of cash. We were able to obtain a picture of Voxeljet's
facility in Friedberg, Germany. It is worth noting that their facility is only 16,000 square
feet, which is not much larger than the typical floor of a New York high-rise. As can be
seen below, the printing facility illustrates the extreme disconnect between a $1 billion
market-cap company and Voxeljet's 16,000 square foot warehouse. The picture below is
reminiscent of Telestone (TSTC) and AutoChina (AUTC), two of the Chinese RTO frauds
we wrote about in the past (TSTC has declined 98%, while AUTC is being sued by the
SEC for fraud).

2) Voxeljet appears to have sold ZERO 3D printers in Q3'13 at arm's length?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 5/37


Based on analysis of Voxeljet's public filings, we believe there is a dirty secret that has
been suppressed by management, and conveniently ignored by the sellside analysts at
the firms that banked the Voxeljet IPO. Unlike other public 3D printing companies, we
believe Voxeljet had to provide financing to sell its printers. We also believe Voxeljet
management mislead the Securities and Exchange Commission approximately one week
prior to its IPO.


On page 51 of Voxeljet's Registration statement is the brief disclosure, "On two occasions,
we have provided loans to customers to cover the purchase price of a 3D printer. These
loans have a grace period of six to nine months after which they are to be repaid on a
monthly basis." If Voxeljet has indeed been supply constrained as management stated on
its third quarter earnings call, then why exactly would they need to sell printers to
customer with effectively zero down for six to nine months? Further, the company lists a
handful of multi-national customers in its Registration statement, such as BMW, Daimler,
Ford, and Porsche. In fact, several of the sellside initiations highlighted these customers
as evidence of Voxeljet's relevance. We believe customers of this nature, which definitely
look very good in a Prospectus, would not require vendor financing to buy a 3D printer
from Voxeljet. Apparently, the SEC shared our concern. While we do not have access to
Voxeljet's confidential Registration statement under the JOBS Act, we do know the original
filings resulted in a series of questions from the SEC on its use of vendor financing. In the
September 6, 2013 correspondence, the SEC remarked:


We note your disclosures on page F-16 and page 51 regarding two loans you have
granted to customers. We note your discussion on page 51 that you concluded that
the conditions had been fulfilled and that recognition of amounts as revenue was
appropriate. Please tell us more about the terms of these loans. In this regard, we
note that on page 51, you state that these loans provide a grace period of six to nine
months after which they are to be repaid on a monthly basis. However, you state on
page F-16 that repayment of the 2010 loan did not commence until November 2012.
Please clarify for us the repayment terms of these loans, including when repayment
begins. Discuss how you considered the delay between the time you granted the
loan and the time payments under the loan began in concluding that it was probable
that the economic benefits associated with the transactions would flow to you.


It appears the original disclosures relating to the loans were removed from Voxeljet's final
Registration statement. We have significant concerns that Voxeljet is using its financing
programs to potentially overstate revenue (an issue we will address below as it pertained
to the third quarter). In its September 17th response to the SEC, Voxeljet confessed that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 6/37


one of the loans was actually not repaid in full. Instead, Voxeljet repurchased the printer,
refurbished it, and then sold it to a bank - only to lease it back from the bank. The printer
was then subleased to another customer - generating revenue again. We can't emphasize
enough that these types of shenanigans are inconsistent with a healthy company. Further,
the detailed explanation below can only be found in the SEC correspondence, because
the background in the Registration statement has been truncated to just two sentences in
a note on page F-41:


In December 2010, the company granted a loan in the amount of €340,000 to a
customer. The terms of the loan required payments to begin in October 2011, with
monthly payments of interest and principal thereafter. The final payment of the
remaining balance on this loan was to be due in September 2016. In February 2013,
as a result of the individual who managed this customer's business accepting an
offer of employment with the company, and, thus, deciding to discontinue the
customer's business, the company identified a new customer for the printer and
repurchased the 3D printer subject to the loan at a price equal to the then-
outstanding unamortized loan balance and extinguished the loan. The 3D printer
was then refurbished and sold to a bank in a sale and leaseback transaction and
subsequently subleased by the company to the new customer under the terms of an
operating lease. The company does not believe the subsequent repurchase of the
3D printer calls into question its initial assessment that it was probable that the
economic benefit associated with the sale to the customer would flow to the
company. The company discloses the repurchase of this 3D printer in Note 3 to its
interim financial statements on page F-41 of the Prospectus.


While vendor financing may be costly for a company with minimal capital stability (Voxeljet
prior to its IPO), there is nothing inherently wrong with giving away product for some
period of time before a customer needs to make payments. However, we believe based on
its third quarter results, Voxeljet may have misled investors and the SEC regarding its
propensity for providing vendor financing. In its final correspondence with the SEC prior to
the IPO, Voxeljet management stated unequivocally that it "does not ordinarily offer loans
to current or prospective customers to cover the purchase of its 3D printers." The
language of the response from October 7, 2013 states the loan program is indeed out of
the ordinary.

Source - Voxeljet SEC filed Correspondence


We believe Voxeljet was highly misleading in its response letter, because in the quarter
completed September 30, 2013 (Q3'13), Voxeljet appears to have provided direct
financing for 1/3 of its printer sales and indirect financing for the other 2/3 of its sales. In
the body of Voxeljet's Q3'13 earnings release, there is no reference to the financing
program, nor was there any disclosure in its Q3'13 earnings call. However, two
unassuming sentences in the detailed footnotes suggest Voxeljet was unable to sell any
printers in Q3'13 without providing assistance. The two sentences are (emphasis ours):


· In September 2013, another loan was granted to a customer for the purpose of
financing their acquisition of a 3D printer in the amount of kEUR 678.


· In September 2013, the company recognized revenue of kEUR 868 on the sale of two
new 3D printers to a customer in exchange for consideration consisting of kEUR 630
cash and kEUR 238 in research services to be received.


In the third quarter, it appears Voxeljet sold one printer via an on-balance sheet loan, and
two other printers with 27% of the purchase price representing future research services
the purchaser agreed to provide in the future (presumably in lieu of cash payments).
Further, it appears all three of Voxeljet's printers were sold in the last month of Q3'13
(September), and without such sales, Voxeljet would have missed Q3'13 by approximately
50%. As such, Voxeljet sold ZERO printers in the third quarter for cash at its list
price, despite declaring to the SEC that this process is not "ordinary." We have been
unable to find any disclosure regarding the nature of the "services to be received," but find
this transaction extremely troubling in light of related party transactions discussed later.


3) Voxeljet's low-tech profile in a high-tech industry


We believe Voxeljet is a bottom-tier company with minimal mind share in the 3D printing
industry. Not only is this thesis supported by the Discern survey and lack of one reference
as competition from other 3D names, but the company's own financials support the thesis.
Voxeljet disclosed in its public filings that it only had "24 employees working in our
research and development department." While this is a razor-thin number of engineers,
we believe the quality of the engineering staff may be well below average based on
compensation estimates.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 8/37


In the third quarter just reported, Voxeljet only spent €447,000 on research and
development. In 2012, Voxeljet disclosed 44% of COGS were personnel costs.
Presumably we can use a similar ratio to determine what percentage of operating expense
is attributable to compensation (vs. non-comp costs). The Q3'13 R&D expense would
equate to an annual run-rate of €1,788,000. Assuming the 44% compensation ratio holds,
then Voxeljet is only paying its 24 engineers €32,780 on average per year. According to
Salary Explorer, the average engineering salary in Germany is €44,616, meaning Voxeljet
pays its engineers 27% less than the average engineering salary in Germany. Comparing
Voxeljet's R&D expense to its purported 3D peers is even more striking. ExOne is often
considered the small, third-tier U.S. 3D printing company. Yet XONE spends nearly 3x
more on R&D than Voxeljet. Further, Voxeljet spends just 0.18% of its market
capitalization on R&D, well below the peer group. Therefore, Voxeljet is significantly
under-spending its peer group, or its stock is wildly overvalued (or most likely both).


The infinitesimal R&D spend also fits with Voxeljet's poor IP positioning, which has forced
the company to license critical intellectual property from competitors. Based on
discussions with ExOne, it is our understanding that ExOne can place restrictions on
Voxeljet's ability to manufacture machines utilizing certain processes and materials. The
SEC deemed its IP business risk material enough to ask Voxeljet for more disclosure.

In fact, Voxeljet seems to acknowledge this business risk, although we are unsure whether
it was the SEC's request that led to the disclosures (Z Corp was bought by 3D systems):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 9/37


We have license agreements with respect to certain intellectual property that is
important to our business with both Z Corp and The ExOne Company, or ExOne,
that impose restrictions on our use of certain intellectual property.


Under this agreement, we are permitted to use machines and provide services
relating to these technologies, but not to make or sell machines utilizing these
technologies without ExOne's consent, although ExOne has an obligation to consent
if the machines do not compete with products engineered, manufactured or sold by
ExOne or its affiliates.


While our rights are restricted regarding use of certain binders and sand-based
casting methods in 3D printers under our agreements with ExOne, we believe these
restrictions will not materially impact the growth of our business.


Illustrating the inefficiency in the market, ExOne will do 300% more revenue than Voxeljet,
grows significantly faster and owns critical IP upon which Voxeljet is dependent. Despite
these factors, Voxeljet's enterprise is currently valued at a 25% premium to ExOne (as a
side note, we are not making a positive argument on ExOne - it too is obscenely valued
and has missed and/or guided down every quarter since it came public).


4) The Use of Sale Leasebacks and a Not-So-White Fib


Prior to its IPO, Voxeljet had been in such a precarious position that the company has
been forced to populate its service center with printers owned by third parties. Simply,
Voxeljet would sell a 3D printer to a bank (or other party) and then lease the printer back
from the bank for service center usage. Like so many of the flags in the Voxeljet story, we
have been unable to find sufficient discussion in sellside reports of this tactic. Fortunately,
Voxeljet was required to disclose the imputed interest rate, as well as minimum lease
payments in its Registration statement. Based on the unamortized interest expense, as a
percentage of the PV of minimum future lease payments, we can compute an effective
interest rate. Based on our analysis, Voxeljet is paying an effective 23% aggregated
interest rate for the right to use its own printers via a sales/leaseback transaction.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 10/37


While the usage of sale/leasebacks is typically associated with weaker capital structures,
it is perfectly legal and acceptable. However, management misrepresenting the nature of
sale/leasebacks when responding to a question on an earnings call is not acceptable. On
its third quarter earnings call, management was asked by a sellside banker (we cannot tell
if he is a banker or sellside analyst) about its increased other operating expense.


Analyst: Within operating expenses, you have a swing from a small income to a
small expense in the other operating expenses not the financial result but the one
that's above operating income. I was just wondering what caused the swing?


Rudolph Franz (CFO Voxeljet): It was mainly driven by let's say the increase in
expenses by establishing the organization for the next growth okay. This is mainly an
investment in that area and I think all the rest is I think it will grow with the revenue
but on a very low basis that's our plan actually.


We believe Mr. Franz's answer is a half-truth at best. Voxeljet clearly states in its
Registration statement that the impact from sale/leasebacks is accounted for in other
operating expenses. Mr. Franz failed to include this detail in his answer, which we believe
is indicative of several other questions we would raise relating to Voxeljet's management.


5) Unconventional Related Party Transactions


We are not willing to accept related party transactions as benign, simply because they are
disclosed. As it relates to Voxeljet, we have found several related party dealings that may
be indicative of a culture inconsistent with acceptable U.S. corporate governance.


First, Voxeljet paid €150,574 to a company called Franz Industriebeteiligungen AG, which
was an affiliate of Voxeljet owned by Mr. Franz. We have been unable to find additional
information other than payment was remitted to a company owned by Mr. Franz and
members of his family for "advisory services." According to public filings, Mr. Franz was
paid this fee prior to becoming CFO of Voxeljet. The SEC also found discrepancies
between payment amounts to its CEO that were originally provided by Voxeljet. These
discrepancies have since been remedied according to Voxeljet's response, and the
erroneous confidential filings on which the SEC is focused were not released to the public.

Additionally, Voxeljet has been paying its CFO, Mr. Franz, for personal paintings that have
been on display at Voxeljet facilities. While the remitted payments do not appear to be
significant, nevertheless Voxeljet is paying its CFO for his personal paintings.


Finally, we are extremely troubled by the fact Voxeljet has been buying materials directly
from Schlosserei und Metallbau Ederer, a metal workings company owned by Robin
Ederer, the brother of Voxeljet's CEO. A Google search for the Schlosserei und Metallbau
Ederer facility responsible for Voxeljet's COGS shows what appears to be a small lot in a
residential neighborhood.

6) Relative Fair Value is $16.79 and perhaps much lower


It is hard to fault the sellside analysts for promoting Voxeljet. It is their job to help banking,
even if it means creating unprecedented methods to value Voxeljet. For example, Cowen
uses a DCF that is anchored by an unheard of 10% terminal growth rate, as well as a
target price based upon a multiple of 100x 2017 earnings. We believe it would be wise for
retail investors to proceed with caution if they are relying on any of the fundamental work
of the covering analysts. For example, the Citi analyst has a Taiepi address and covers

5/19/2018 Voxeljet - Printing Red Flags In All Dimensions - voxeljet AG (NYSE:VJET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1853901-voxeljet-printing-red-flags-in-all-dimensions 12/37


Stephens analyst covers XONE and Voxeljet, but does not cover the two most important
companies in the 3D space, SSYS and DDD. Again, this is not a criticism of the analysts.
We simply believe they face incredible challenges presenting a balanced picture.


Who gets left holding the bag when Voxeljet ultimately reflects its third-tier status? Voxeljet
management sold 900,000 shares less than one month ago. In fact, Voxeljet management
not only sold 900,000 shares on the IPO, but their insider shares also represented 100%
of the 975,000 greenshoe that was sold. Their sale price on 1,875,000 shares was $12.09
net of the underwriter's discount.


So our guess is the retail investor recklessly bidding up Voxeljet gets stuck holding the
bag. According to Bloomberg, for the week ending 11/15/13, in which Voxeljet's stock rose
almost 50%, over half of the advertised volume was attributable to three heavily retail-
oriented brokers (NITE, UBS - via Schwab, and Fidelity Capital Markets).


We believe Voxeljet shares have at least 75% downside in the near-to-intermediate term.
Should we begrudgingly assume the other publicly-traded 3D stocks are fairly valued, and
Voxeljet trades in line with this peer group, then Voxeljet shares would be worth
approximately $16.79, which is 75% below its recent share price. However, this assumes
Voxeljet trades in line with its faster growing comp set, AND it assumes the comp set is
not overvalued. Should Voxeljet trade at a discount to its comp set, or should the comp set
correct, then Voxeljet could see downside well in excess of 75%. For example, if Voxeljet
were to trade at a 25% discount to its peer group (which would still be 11.6x sales), the
stock price of VJET would decline by 79% to $13.34 per share. We believe the damage is
a matter of when… not if.

No, Schlosserei und Metallbau Ederer are rumoured to use 7DP eventually, at 9876543210 DPI; that's one
resolute resolution, only achievable with unobtanium powder and gel-based wishalloy.

Mr. Hopf: I am surprised, possibly dismayed, at your omission of the recent advancements of CLUNK-
machining, boasting a resolution of .00000001 nm. I must confess that I am unaware of its precision utilizing
unobtanium powder, but I will speculate that its month-to-month reproducibility far exceeds any 7DP system.

I have it from Mr Musterman himself that this CLUNK-machining is not going to be on the market for another

I am in posession of insider information. Mr Mustermann is divorcing his wife, his aide and secretary, thus
putting the business at peril. Mrs Mustermann was virtually running Schlosserei und Metallbau Ederer with Mr
Mustermann rather being the facade for investors, having invented the unobtanium powder process that
would have enabled 7D printing. With Mrs Mustermann gone from the business, operating expenses will go
through the roof.

Quantum physics. Schlosserei und Metallbau Ederer had, under Mr. Mustermann's helm, developed a new
powder based gels that works with neutrinos and, eventually, Higgs bosons, hence the sub-atomic accuracy.

In addition to calling VJET to account, this points out deficiencies in the FASB standards for reporting sales; will the
SEC require more transparent (truthful) reporting that can be understood by ordinary investors or continue to allow
management discretion over items that can mislead investors.

There was nothing misleading. The author only says "I believe..." this or that and offers no proof. As for
financing a couple printer purchases, that was 3 out of 52 total and not a big deal. Maybe they should finance
more. And, yes, every company in the world counts a financed sale as a sale and has done so since the
beginning of time. Only this author and othe VJET bashers are unaware of this fact.

You should rather have this article removed as it shows, as so many AF articles do, that the author has no
oversight of either the company he is reviewing nor the market it operates in.

I am not invested in AF stocks at the moment, as they have all reached irrational territory where mirages rule

I agree the company's current status doesn't withstand the share price three days ago. However, technology and
business wise, you are free to argue about the 20+ employees in R&D, or metal working supplier from CEO's brother,
or informal loan program to customers, which doesn't make it look like comparable 3D printing company as DDD or
SSYS. But if we start thinking about this company as a start-up, that might be able to answer a lot of questionings.
And I think it has what it needs, though not fancy, for further development.

Yup. When you've got a valuation of a few hundred million dollars you'd expect at least a half decent auditor;
I'm not asking for a Big 4... but something. Even taking the results at face value,they didn't support the run up

Both may be true, perhaps. Still, Apple or GOOG are certainly well respected, growing and globally
established companies with real earnings. But even in their case - would you buy a share of them for a five-
figure $ amount? This is what you would pay for vjet, valuation wise. 
And here we have a shady start-up with lots of question marks in a highly competitive industry. Growth will be
there, plenty of it. (the industry itself speaks of about 20% p.a. for many years to come) But it already seems
to be that 3d printers will get commoditized rather quickly. 20% p.a. growth with margins getting thinner, not
fatter and those lofty valuations... ? hm...

SA seems to be orchestrating these overwhelmingly negative messages on VJET on this board. My previous
comment appeared briefly and then it was removed by SA.


Investors should focus on the latest earnings report from VJET. That is really what matters. Here is an excerpt from
the report.


======================... 
voxeljet AG Reports Financial Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 
4:54p ET November 14, 2013 (Business Wire)


voxeljet AG (NYSE:VJET) (the "Company" or "voxeljet"), a leading provider of high-speed, large-format 3D printers
and on-demand parts services to industrial and commercial customers, today announced its unaudited financial
results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2013.

their sales appear to be fabricated, and the SEC has requested further discussion on the nature of the sales
that occurred in 3Q...so unfortunately it does not matter

I got burnt by the 2010-11 chinese "reverse-merge ipo darling" scam. No way it's going to happen again. When there
is a high-growing country/sector-based frenzy, some crooks are bound to work their way in successfully and rip off
investors. But I don't blame myself for investing in Rino and other low-cap chinese scams: they cheated me and many
other way-more-experienced institutional investors.

Companies make more money by providing loans than by selling products outright. This is a standard in industry.
Most large industrial machines are financed as are cars, and no one has complained that car companies are
unhealthy or inflating their sales numbers by counting financed vehicles. And the entire housing and construction
industry also operates on loans.


There is nothing "unorthodox" about leasing or providing loans for items you are selling. It is the most common thing
in capitalism and the engine of the economy. Indeed, companies like it because they make more money.

Argyll: you are comparing apples to oranges. Voxeljet is supposed to be in its early growth phase. Demand should be
robust enough at this stage to preclude the need for company-provided financing. When a company does this (think
CSCO back in the late 90's) it greatly increases its risk. To eliminate this risk, most capital equipment companies use
3rd party leasing firms as intermediaries. When a manufacturer does it on its own, it implies that the "buyer" cannot
qualify for such financing.


Auto manufacturers' financing arms are separate divisions. This isolates the accounting and enables analysts and
shareholders to thoroughly assess the degree of leverage and the risks. Also, they have the option of securitizing the
receivables, if they wanted to or had to.


21 Nov 2013, 03:29 PM


Argyll
Voxeljet was established in 1999 and sold its first printers to BMW and Daimler in 2002. Many companies
provide loans to customers to finance purchases. Are you saying that every store that does financing is
extremely risky? If so, that would be the majority of companies in the world.


There isn't much risk with this sort of thing because it's sold to reputable companies. Major customers include
Ford Motor Co., The 3M Co., Daimler AG, BMW and Hyundai. 3D Systems Corp. (DDD) has also been a
distributor of voxeljet printers since 2011.


For the very few financed printers (3 out of 52) VJET gets some money upfront plus loan payments, and the
only reason it's not going to be paid is if the company goes out of business, in which case VJET gets back the
printer. Also, factor in VJET has done this for 3 out of 52 printers sold!


That is, they have financed 5.77% of all sales. So anyone harping on this this is ridiculously alarmist. VJET
will just take back their printer and resell it or lease it if there's a problem.

Payoffs to relatives. Lies to the SEC. A handful of real sales. I guess you long need an anvil to fall out of the sky

voxeljet has 87 employees as of 6/30/13.


The company's production facilities now stand at 16,000 square feet and are undergoing expansion to over
40,000 square feet. Proceeds from the IPO are for the establishment of new service centers in North America
and Asia, research and development, sales and marketing initiatives, and "general corporate purposes
including potential acquisitions".


Approximately 53% of sales to date have been outside of Germany and major customers include Ford, 3M.
BMW, and Hyundai.


3D Systems Corporation has also been a distributor of Voxeljet printers since 2011.

I'll also bet that when the dust settles, VJET will be regarded as a viable company but one of the riskier 3D stocks in

That is 16 printers in 4 years total!


They have a forward P/E of 338.20 (that is after the decline to 33.82$)


XONE 115.70 
DDD 56.44 
SSYS 49.21


VJET has a P/S ratio of 47.70 (again after todays close)


XONE 17.55 
DDD 16.07 
SSYS 12.26


And you can go on. By every factor you could come up with (check finviz for example) VJET after the pullback is the
most expensive of the 3D printing companies?


Even if we do not discuss the report of SA and Citron why should someone invest in a new company that has not
proven it can be the real deal, is two to x times more expensive than the established companies, is from a country that
you can not get hold of first hand information ...


Do not fall in love with a stock or an idea! Just follow the pure math when investing!


But it is just my opinion and your money...

You are completely forgetting the services division, and. with respect to printers, when you are selling million
dollar items, one or two per year is fine. Certainly, if I had six customers buying a million dollars worth of stuff
each year, I would think it fabulous.


They have both a systems division and a services division which includes their great customers, and explains
revenues of $11.3 million in 2012 on the sale of 6 printers.

Good article. I wonder now how long it will take before another good article surfaces and VJET goes up again. After
all they do have biggest printers. And after all they were in business since 90s. And they did invent and patented 3d
printing methods that XONE uses. Soo, while the article is good, I can't help but thinking that it's biased. I'll keep an
eye on VJET. Hopefully I won't miss its next rally. Happy hunting :)

I must say after looking at the report at citronresearch.com I have to wonder about the professionalism of Citron. 
Can someone answer these questions? 
Why does Citron they feel the need to use expletives? 
Why does the Citron report have the look and feel of a cheap infomercial? 
Why does Citron feel that Voxeljet needs to have a large facility to be successful? BTW, the image of the VJET facility
shown in the article above can also be seen in this interesting YouTube video http://bit.ly/18TVGEh 
Why does VJET have so many partners as listed on the contact page of their web site? http://bit.ly/1iAOzbf 
Why has 3D systems entered into a distribution partnership with VJET as advertised on 3D systems web site? 
Is it fair for Citron to state in it's report that VJET "doesn’t sell printers, it loans them". This implies they do not sell
printers at all. Is this true? 
Please, serious replies only.

Being deleted by SA is a Red Badge of Courage...lol. I really find the criteria for de-listing silly. I got deleted for telling
someone to "get a clue". It's really laughable. As for Vjet, SA should delete themselves for getting that great artical
that started this debate posted so late. Anyway, the mountain of evidence agaist VJET is compelling. SELL or
SHORT, especially if their is any type of bounce. If you like this space, DDD got great news today,SSYS held up well,
AMAVF was up 8 at one point. VJET has the advantage of selling 10 printers through 2012 that they don't have to
expand out of their big garage to do service, they can do it in a phone booth...like all billion dollar firms...

Dell started in a garage. :-) 
But VJET have a real plant. Just go on Google Maps and search for "voxeljet". It's a big white long
rectangular hall.

It's good to know that SA retains the right to keep its comments sections civil by deleting derisive comments.
If only they'd hire someone to do it full-time. I know my monthly subscription fee could pay for a good full-time
intern in India.

Anyhow, does anybody remember this article: 
http://bit.ly/IlaQM1


That's the real story. 70 was a bit too high (for now, too fast). Mid-40's is just right (realistic, for now). It went below 40
due to Citron... So, we had the meaningful pullback PJ were referring to, time to rise now, maybe not as fast, but
upwards for sure.

...So 44 at first as Piper called it, then 55 as Citi called it. And then we'll see. Maybe 70 again next year,
depending on how their business develops.

You have to realize that the Market may no longer let these companies trade at such high multiples. Bubbles
burst. It seems this Market, going through the end of this year and into 2014, is going to burst bubbles, one
sector at a time. Be careful....

It's not the height, it was the speed. VJET went to 70 too fast. But the same reasons that got it there are still
valid. It's the same company like last week, nothing changed. Just bad press. And what's in the press is not
some new miraculous discovery or unveiled corporate secrets. We all knew that stuff. We all knew 70 was too
high for now. But the reasons why it got to 70 are still valid, so it will get there again. But it will have to earn
the 70 back, over time. First step 44, then 55, then we'll see. VJET is a great company, just a bit small at
present. But people want everything NOW, hence the premature 70, and the subsequent profit taking. A no-
brainer thing.

@ Temenenemem: The barber always thinks you need a haircut. Of course PJ is a cheerleader for the stock -
they underwrote it! If you are brand new to investing you should know NEVER to take the recommendations
of brokers who just underwrote a deal. There is an implicit quid pro quo between companies going public and
the ibanks/brokers who take them public that they will be favorably covered. It's just good for business (for
them). I'm thinking of writing something about this but in the meantime, this might help clarify:


http://bit.ly/1iHgd6q


Perhaps you should use index funds and read books like Klarman's Margin of Safety (he breaks out wall st
incentives toward the beginning), Buffet's Annual letters to shareholders, and Ben Graham's books (also
check out Einhorn letters to s/hs). Then start investing once you have a bit more understanding how this all
works.

Promising industry, growing revenue, good gross margin, even profitable. Largest and fastest printers. I work
in the Automotive industry in Europe, and believe me, they are quite optimistic about (German!) 3D printed
parts. If you take VJET's financial figures and multiply them by a coefficient of 100, wouldn't it be a great
company? Just because they're small, doesn't make them bad. Alas, 70 came too high and too fast, but the
drop was just as reckless as the jump. On Tuesday 19th we had classic profit taking, all 3DP stocks went
down. VJET's RSI was 98%. Then on Wednesday 20th, the silly Citron article came out, and added fuel to the
fire. I like this take on Citron: http://bit.ly/1fB8qHU . I got in a few days after the IPO, and got out before it even
hit 60, let alone 70. I even warned that 60+ was very very bubbly (and did so before it dropped, check the SA
StockTalk on VJET). All I'm saying is that the drop was needlessly too deep. VJET is still the same company
people were willing to pay 70 dollars for. They didn't have any business shortfalls, just bad bearish press.
Don't buy (or sell in this case) into everything you read. That's less a reason to drop, than the reason(s) that

got VJET to 70. I got back in now, and I see a realistic price of 50. On paper that might seem high, but hey,
we're talking 3D printing; either you believe in the industry or you don't. I do.


24 Nov 2013, 06:14 PM

@ Forensic - did you see the piece on SA saying that VJET's service business bought half of the printers the systems
business sold thus far in 2013? Is that consistent with your understanding?

I am a European,NOT a german and every thing I buy,electrcally or a car is german.Everything they produce is very
good quality; I put a lot of money in Voxeljet and if I had any doubt that this was a fraud I would jump in my car,and
drive the 250 miles to inspect the company. Voxeljet is without any doubt a serious company.

It's funny how a few numbers and name calling through this momo player down. In this market I see bubbles
everywhere. People want money and so they are buying hoping that happens. VJET and all the other new tech
sectors will move forward just so that everyone can pump it and dump it for their gains. Good luck VJET all the way

Dude..sometimes a person can convince themselves that the company that they invested in just has to go up, that


they can't be wrong. This happens everyday and its happening to you. The evidence is OVERWHILMING kind of like
the OJ case..."a mountain of evidence" is staring at you. Even if you want ti ignore the evidence or twist it so it fits you
paradigm, the real money (institutions) do believe it. They rule the markets and determine the direction of the stock.
It's not us here on lowly SA. You can't fight the tape...

Hey Chan, thanks for the wonderful insight


25 Nov 2013, 05:09 PM

You are wrong Chan. I have no position in VJET. I do have positions in DDD, AMAVF, SSYS. These are real
companies. They don't BS the investors or the SEC or work out of a big garage or buy back their own products to fake
sales. All that being said, you missed the point AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. What is said on SA has no impact on
stock direction one way or the other. Get it? The institutions drive direction! The only reason I post on a stock like this
to save some people from false hope, and big losses. I would say that HP may be looking for a company to buy.
Given their history they could over pay and grind the technology into the ground. Thats your only hope. Waiting on
buyouts is a fast way to the poor house.


26 Nov 2013, 12:50 PM


temenem
Well, yes, the institutions drive the direction, but common folks and various article do push/pull the stock
somewhat too. The institution determine the mid to long-term direction, but the short-term ups and downs are
influenced by common folks. Vox populi, vox Dei. :-)

VJET will follow XONE and it is a better one. I trust Germen company, which has world number one technology and
provides the best quality products.


Bought it after crash.

I just hope VJET doesn't go up too soon and too fast again. Then it will start bubbling again. Why can't this stock be a
bit calmer... +3% per day is enough, no need for +10% days, followed by -40% drops...

VJET - has been in 35 - 47.50 range recently.

VJET is still in this trading range but has difficulty to move down below $40.00 even XONE bad news. It closed at
41.02 today and am waiting to see $35.00 to add position.
