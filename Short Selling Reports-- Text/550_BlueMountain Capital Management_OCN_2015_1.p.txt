Notice of Default 


Notice of Event of Default 
Notice of Facility Early Amortization Event


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We write on behalf of our client BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, as investment manager
to BlueMountain Montenvers Master Fund SCA SICAV-SIF, BlueMountain Guadalupe Peak Fund


L.P., and Blue Mountain Credit Alternatives Master Fund L.P. ("BlueMountain"), which own certain
Series 2012-T2 and Series 2013-T3 Notes issued in connection with the HLSS Servicer Advance
Receivables Trust (the "HSART Trust").  We write in reference to the Sixth Amended and Restated
Indenture, dated as of January 17, 2014, including all Schedules and Exhibits thereto (the


"Indenture"), by and among the HSART Trust, as Issuer, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as
Indenture Trustee, Calculation Agent, Paying Agent and Securities Intermediary, HLSS Holdings,


LLC ("HLSS"), as Administrator and as Servicer (on and after the MSR Transfer Date), Ocwen Loan

Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Administrative Agent, and


Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, and all agreements referenced
therein, including without limitation all the Designated Servicing Agreements and Transaction


Documents.  Unless otherwise speci�ed, capitalized terms used but not de�ned in this letter have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture and the Master Subservicing Agreement, dated


as of February 10, 2012, by and between HLSS, as Servicer and Ocwen, as Subservicer.
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


As particularized herein, we write to provide notice that Events of Defaults exist under the


Indenture pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(d), resulting from Ocwen's material breach of its covenants to,
among other things, comply with applicable laws and requisite servicing obligations; (ii) Section


8.1(m)(i), resulting from Ocwen's breach of a warranty in the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility


Agreement and a subsequent amendment thereto that it is not in violation of any law that could
reasonably be expected to cause, among other things, a material adverse effect on Ocwen's


business and �nancial condition; and (iii) Section 8.1(g), resulting from the failure of the Collateral
Test, which measures whether the Notes are adequately collateralized.[1] 


The facts establishing these Events of Default are irrefutable.  For example, Ocwen recently


"stipulate[d]" and "agree[d]" in a consent order with the New York Department of Financial
Services to violations of law and to engaging in imprudent servicing practices.  In addition, the


California Department of Business Oversight has commenced proceedings to suspend Ocwen's
servicer license in California, a signi�cant source of loans in the RMBS trusts that generate the


advances that collateralize the payments to Noteholders.  These (and other) agencies' �ndings


and enforcement actions demonstrate Ocwen's systemic, long-standing and continuing servicing
failures and disregard of applicable and analogous laws.  Evidencing the signi�cance of these


af�rmations of Ocwen's servicing misconduct, the rating agencies expressly referenced the state
regulatory authorities' actions as a basis for their decisions to downgrade Ocwen's servicer rating


and the corporate ratings of related entities, Ocwen Financial Corporation and Home Loan


Servicing Solutions, Ltd.  Likewise, the share price of the two related companies fell precipitously
following the announcement of the California suspension proceeding, i.e., by approximately 36%


and 20%, respectively.


The recent disclosures thus demonstrate Ocwen's material breaches of its covenants and


warranties not to engage in such illicit and imprudent practices; and those breaches in turn


materially increase the risk of loss on the Notes that are collateralized by receivables affected by
Ocwen's standing as a servicer.  Indeed, the offering memorandum governing the issuance of the


Notes explicitly recited the very servicing misconduct that Ocwen engaged in as a factor that
would increase the risk of loss on the Notes.  That material increase in the risk of loss gives rise to


the speci�ed Events of Default, and a corresponding right to an increased return for the


Noteholders.


Speci�cally, under the bargained-for terms of the Indenture, the Note Interest Rate is increased by


3.00% upon the occurrence of any Event of Default to compensate the Noteholders for the
associated increased risk of loss.  Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in its capacity as
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Calculation Agent, must provide "written notice specifying the nature and status of any . . . Event


of Default, Facility Early Amortization Event or other event or occurrence which could have an


Adverse Effect."  (Indenture § 3.3(b).)  Such notice must be provided to the Noteholders, the
Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and each Note Rating Agency promptly after receiving knowledge of


such event, but no later than three Business Days thereafter.[2]  (Id.)


The following sections detail (i) the facts that serve as a predicate for Events of Default under the


Indenture, (ii) the rating agency downgrades and the share price declines that evidence the


signi�cance of Ocwen's admitted violations of law and imprudent servicing practices, (iii) the
materially increased risk of loss to the Noteholders stemming from Ocwen's conduct, and (iv) the


provisions of the Indenture governing the speci�ed Events of Default.


I. Ocwen's Violations of Law and Imprudent Servicing Practices


A. New York Investigations


Facts admitted by Ocwen establish multiple breaches of various covenants in the Transaction
Documents and Designated Servicing Agreements and multiple defaults or Events of Default


under the Indenture.  On December 19, 2014, Ocwen and Ocwen Financial Corporation admitted
to facts that give rise to material breaches and defaults of the covenants and agreements in the


above-referenced provisions.  Ocwen's stipulations are memorialized in the Consent Order


Pursuant to New York Banking Law § 44 (the "2014 Consent Order") that Ocwen entered into with
the New York State Department of Financial Services ("NYSDFS").[3]  Speci�cally, the 2014 Consent


Order sets forth numerous facts to which Ocwen has admitted, including the following:
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Ocwen committed "numerous and signi�cant violations" of New York State laws and
regulations and engaged in "repeated non-compliance" with prior regulatory orders.  (2014


Consent Order at 1, 2 and ¶¶ 7, 11, emphasis added.)
In September 2011, "Ocwen and the [NYSDFS] entered into an Agreement on Mortgage


Servicing Practices ('2011 Agreement'), which required Ocwen to adhere to certain servicing


practices in the best interest of borrowers and investors . . . ."[4]  (Id. ¶ 2.)  In June 2012, the
NYSDFS conducted a review of Ocwen which "identi�ed . . . repeated non-compliance by


Ocwen" and violations of New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law ("RPAPL")
§§ 1304 and 1302.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Consequently, on December 5, 2012, Ocwen entered into a


Consent Order Under New York Banking Law     § 44 (the "2012 Consent Order"),[5] in which


the NYSDFS found that Ocwen had engaged in violations of the 2011 Agreement and
violations of New York state laws and regulations.  (Id. ¶¶ 9, 11.)


Following the 2012 Consent Order, a compliance monitor appointed pursuant to the 2012


Consent Order (the "Compliance Monitor") initiated a review of Ocwen in July 2013.  (Id. ¶ 10.) 
A review by the Compliance Monitor of 478 New York loans that Ocwen had foreclosed upon


revealed 1,358 violations of Ocwen's legal obligations, including:  "failing to ensure that


[Ocwen's] statements to the court in foreclosure proceedings were correct"; "pursuing


foreclosure even while modi�cation applications were pending"; "failing to maintain records


con�rming that [Ocwen] is not pursuing foreclosure of servicemembers on active duty"; and
"failing to assign a designated customer care representative."  (Id. ¶¶ 10, 12.) 


Ocwen has "inadequate and ineffective information technology systems and personnel."  (Id.


¶ 13.)


As a result of de�ciencies in its information technology systems, "Ocwen regularly gives


borrowers incorrect or outdated information, sends borrowers backdated letters, unreliably
tracks data for investors, and maintains inaccurate records."  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Examples of


backdating letters include giving borrowers 30 days from the date of a denial letter to


appeal that denial where "those 30 days had already elapsed by the time they received the


backdated letter."  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Ocwen's systems also show that "borrowers facing foreclosure


received letters with a date by which to cure their default and avoid foreclosure," but "the
cure date was months prior to receipt of the letter."  (Id.)  "There are insuf�cient controls in


place—either manual or automated—to catch all of these errors and resolve them."  (Id. ¶ 14.)  


"Ocwen's systems have been backdating letters for years" and "Ocwen's processes failed to


identify and remedy these errors . . . ."  (Id. ¶ 15, emphasis added.)


Even when an employee questioned Ocwen's backdating processes and informed the
company's Vice President of Compliance, Ocwen did not "fully investigate and appropriately


address the backdating issue."  (Id. ¶ 16.)  Ocwen ignored the backdating issue for �ve


months until the same employee complained again.  (Id.)  This time, Ocwen began an
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


investigation, which was incomplete, and "Ocwen has not fully resolved the issue to date,


more than a year after its initial discovery."  (Id.)
Ocwen's "core servicing functions rely on its inadequate systems."  (Id. ¶ 17.)  Though Ocwen's


"comment codes," which are used to initiate a process such as sending a delinquency letter


to a borrower or referring a loan for foreclosure, are ineffective, Ocwen "continues to rely on


[the inadequate systems] to service its portfolio of distressed loans."  (Id. ¶¶ 17, 18.) 


Ocwen "employ[s] fewer trained personnel than its competitors."  (Id. ¶ 18.)  Ocwen's Chief
Financial Of�cer has acknowledged that Ocwen is "simply 'training people to read the scripts


and the dialogue engines with feeling.'"  (Id.)  Ocwen forces its "customer support staff to


follow the scripts closely."  (Id.)  Ocwen has penalized and terminated employees who do not


adhere to the script.  (Id.)


Ocwen's policy of requiring its customer service representatives to adhere to the script has
"frustrated struggling borrowers who have complex issues that exceed the bounds of a script


and have issues speaking with representatives at Ocwen capable of addressing their


concerns."  (Id.)  In many cases, Ocwen's representatives "provide con�icting responses to a


borrower's question" and "fail[] . . . to record in Ocwen's servicing system the nature of the


concerns that a borrower has expressed, leading to inaccurate records of the issues raised by
the borrowers."  (Id. ¶ 18.)


"Ocwen's inadequate infrastructure and ineffective personnel have resulted in Ocwen's


failure to ful�ll its legal obligations."  (Id. ¶ 19.)


The NYSDFS also identi�ed "widespread con�icts of interest with related parties."  (Id. ¶ 13.) 


The 2014 Consent Order required that William Erbey resign from his position as Executive
Chairman of Ocwen and af�liated entities.  (Id. ¶ 57.)


B. California Investigations


Two different California regulators have found that Ocwen violated California law.  On a webpage


answering "frequently asked questions" related to Ocwen's settlement with the Consumer


Finance Protection Bureau and attorneys general from 49 states and the District of Columbia
(discussed below), the California Attorney General states, "[w]e believe that Ocwen violated federal


and state laws against unfair and deceptive practices.  Ocwen's unlawful conduct hurt consumers


who have had home loans serviced by Ocwen, Litton, and Homeward.  For example, Ocwen made


consumers pay improper fees and charges, caused unreasonable delays and expenses when


consumers asked for help to avoid foreclosure, and wrongly refused to give consumers loan
modi�cations that could have helped those consumers stay in their homes."[6]

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Separately, the California Department of Business Oversight (the "DBO"), the state regulator


responsible for Ocwen's residential mortgage lender and loan servicer license, has found that


Ocwen violated California Financial Code §§ 50326 and 50314 as well as a prior Order to


Discontinue Violations issued by the DBO.  "After a series of complaints tied to Ocwen's servicing


of mortgages in California, state regulators began investigating the company to ensure its
compliance with the California Homeowners Bill of Rights, a set of laws to protect against abusive


foreclosure practices, in addition to the state's Residential Mortgage Lending Act."[7]  On October


3, 2014, the agency commenced a proceeding to suspend Ocwen's license because "Ocwen has


violated [California] Financial Code section 50326 and has violated a prior issued Order to


Discontinue Violations."  (Accusation In Support of Notice of Intent to Issue an Order Suspending
Residential Mortgage Lender and Loan Servicer License ("DBO Accusation") at 6.)[8]

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


In January 2013, the California Commissioner of Business Oversight (the "DBO


Commissioner") "commenced a regulatory examination of Ocwen," as recited in the DBO


Accusation.  (Id. at 2.)  On October 15, 2013, the DBO Commissioner requested documents
from Ocwen "to ensure its compliance with the recently enacted California Homeowners Bill


of Rights . . . , a package of amendments to the California Civil Code that became law on


January 1, 2013."  (Id.)  According to the DBO Commissioner, "Ocwen failed to produce all of


the requested documentation and information."  (Id.)


The DBO made an additional request for documents on February 7, 2014, which included
documents previously requested by the DBO.  (Id.)  Although Ocwen "produced a portion of


the documentation," it did not respond to the [DBO's] inquiries seeking clari�cation whether


the documents produced "consist[ed] of all of the documentation called for in the [DBO's]


February 7, 2014 request."  (Id.)  According to the DBO Commissioner, "[t]he documentation


produced by Ocwen in response to the [DBO's] February 7, 2014 request is incomplete."  (Id.
at 2-3.)


"Based on Ocwen's failure to produce all documentation and information called for in the


Department's February 7, 2014 request, on March 12, 2014, the [DBO] Commissioner issued an


administrative subpoena duces tecum requesting documentation and information from


Ocwen."  (Id. at 3.)  Although Ocwen produced some documents requested by the subpoena,
"[o]n May 1, 2014, the [DBO] informed Ocwen that Ocwen's latest production is incomplete." 


(Id.)  The DBO "requested that Ocwen produce the outstanding documentation and


information by May 5, 2014, or the [DBO] may issue administrative orders and �le a petition


in California Superior Court to compel Ocwen to comply with the ongoing examination and


administrative subpoena duces tecum."  (Id.)  "On May 5, 2014, Ocwen produced a portion of
the outstanding documentation called for in the subpoena duces tecum."  (Id.)


On June 16, 2014, the DBO Commissioner issued an Order to Discontinue Violations, pursuant


to California Financial Code section 50321 (the "DBO Order to Discontinue").[9]  The DBO


Order to Discontinue states that Ocwen "failed to produce documents and records, upon


request of the [DBO] Commissioner and within the time period speci�ed, that would
properly enable the [DBO] Commissioner to determine whether Ocwen . . . is performing


residential mortgage loan servicing functions in compliance with the provisions of the


California Residential Mortgage Lending Act . . . and the rules promulgated thereunder in


violation of California Financial Code section 50314."  (DBO Order to Discontinue at 1.)  Ocwen


was ordered to "immediately discontinue the violations set forth [in the DBO Order to
Discontinue] and immediately produce all books and records requested by the [DBO]


Commissioner by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Paci�c time) June 26, 2014."  (Id. at 2).  According to


the DBO Commissioner, "Ocwen did not request a hearing to challenge the Order to


Discontinue Violations and the Order to Discontinue Violations is now �nal."  (DBO
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Accusation at 4.)  "On August 4, 2014, representatives of Ocwen and the Commissioner took
part in a meeting regarding Ocwen's production of documentation.  As a result of


discussions during the meeting, it became apparent that Ocwen had not produced all


outstanding documentation by June 26, 2014, as directed in the Order to Discontinue


Violations."  (Id. at 4.)


On June 16, 2014, the DBO sent Ocwen a letter requesting "a loan servicing report and other
information from Ocwen."  (DBO Accusation at 4.)  Although Ocwen produced some


documents, as of July 10, 2014, "Ocwen had still not produced all the information called for in


the June 16, 2014 letter."  (Id. at 4.)  On July 11, 2014, the DBO "noti�ed Ocwen that as a result


of Ocwen's failure to produce all matters requested in the June 16, 2014 letter," Ocwen shall


pay a $100 per diem �ne through July 20, 2014, "until Ocwen produces all of the matters
requested."  (Id.)  The July 11, 2014 noti�cation "further informed Ocwen that if it fails to


produce all matters requested by . . . July 21, 2014, this failure shall constitute grounds for the


suspension or revocation of Ocwen's license pursuant to California Financial Code section


50327."  (Id. at 4-5.)


On July 31, 2014 and August 5, 2014, the DBO requested additional documents to be
produced by August 15, 2014 "in preparation for an on-site examination of Ocwen."  (Id. at 5.) 


The DBO "informed Ocwen that failure to produce the requested information may lead to


the Commissioner taking adverse action against Ocwen's license."  (Id.)  Although Ocwen


produced certain documents requested by the July 31, 2014 and August 5, 2014 requests, as


of October 2014, "Ocwen ha[d] still not produced all matters requested," despite being
informed by the DBO that its failure "to produce all matters required by . . . August 28, 2014 . .


. shall constitute ground for the suspension or revocation of Ocwen's license pursuant to


California Financial Code section 50327."  (Id.)


On October 3, 2014, the DBO Commissioner issued the DBO Accusation, stating that "Ocwen


has violated Financial Code section 50326 and has violated a prior issued Order to
Discontinue Violations and based thereon, grounds exist to suspend the residential


mortgage lender and loan servicer license of Ocwen for a period of up to twelve (12)


months."  (Id.)  The DBO Commissioner's prayer for relief asked that "the residential mortgage


lender and loan servicer license of Ocwen be suspended for a period of up to twelve  . . .


months."  (Id.)  As of January 2, 2015, the DBO Commissioner's "legal action . . . to suspend the
mortgage servicer license of Ocwen" is pending before "an administrative law judge, with the


California Of�ce of Administrative Hearings . . . ."[10]


On October 3, 2014, November 26, 2014 and January 2, 2015, the Commissioner issued Orders


of Forfeiture against Ocwen, �nding that Ocwen had not timely produced all requested


documentation, as required by provisions of California law, and ordering Ocwen to forfeit
and pay penalties of $2,000, $1,000, and $1,000, respectively.[11]

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


A spokesperson for the DBO has stated:  "[Ocwen] failed to comply with requests for


information.  They failed to comply with a subpoena for information.  They violated a lawful


order from the commissioner.  And they failed to comply with an order from an


administrative law judge. . . .  We can't countenance that kind of behavior."[12]  "If Ocwen
ultimately doesn't or cannot satisfy the regulator's demands, it could be forced to transfer its


mortgage servicing rights in the state to other companies."[13]


If Ocwen's servicer license is suspended in California, as requested by the DBO Commissioner,


Ocwen would lose the right to service "23% by unpaid principal balance of [its] portfolio and 15%


by number of loans," and "potentially become ineligible to be a master servicer for any of its non-
agency trusts."[14]


C. Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and State Attorneys General Investigation


Additionally, in December 2013, the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ("CFPB") and the


attorneys general for 49 states and the District of Columbia �led a Complaint against Ocwen and


Ocwen Financial Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[15]  The CFPB
and state attorneys general alleged "violations" of (i) "state law prohibiting unfair and deceptive


consumer practices with respect to loan servicing," (ii) "state law prohibiting unfair and deceptive


consumer practices with respect to foreclosure processing," (iii) the Consumer Protection Act of


2010, 12 U.S.C. § 5481 et seq., "with respect to loan servicing," and (iv) the Consumer Financial


Protection Act of 2010, 12 U.S.C. § 5481 et seq., "with respect foreclosure processing."[16] 
Speci�cally, the CFPB and the attorneys general alleged that Ocwen engaged in the following


acts and practices:

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


"failing to timely and accurately apply payments made by borrowers and failing to maintain
accurate account statements";


"charging unauthorized fees for default-related services";
"imposing force-placed insurance when [Ocwen] knew or should have known that borrowers
already had adequate coverage";


"providing false or misleading information in response to borrower complaints";
"providing false or misleading information to borrowers regarding loans that have been


transferred from other servicers";
"failing to provide accurate and timely information to borrowers who seek information about
loss mitigation services, including loan modi�cations";


"falsely advising borrowers that they must be at least 60 days delinquent in loan payments to
qualify for a loan modi�cation";


"misrepresenting to borrowers that loss mitigation programs would provide relief from the
initiation of foreclosure or further foreclosure efforts";
"providing false or misleading information to consumers about the status of the loss


mitigation review, including while referring loans to foreclosure";
"providing false or misleading information to consumers about the status of foreclosure


proceedings where the borrower was in good-faith actively pursuing a loss mitigation
alternative offered by [Ocwen]";
"failing to properly calculate borrowers' eligibility for loan modi�cation programs and


improperly denying loan modi�cation relief to eligible borrowers";
"failing to properly process borrowers' applications for loan modi�cations, including failing to


account for documents submitted by borrowers and failing to respond to borrowers'

modi�cations to consumers who were eligible";


"providing false or misleading reasons for denial of loan modi�cations";
"with respect to transferred loans, failing to honor in-process trial modi�cations agreed to by


prior servicers";
"with respect to transferred loans with in-process trial and permanent modi�cations,

unmodi�ed terms";
"preparing, executing, notarizing, and presenting false and misleading documents, �ling


false and misleading documents with courts and government agencies, or otherwise using
false or misleading documents as part of the foreclosure process (including, but not limited
to, af�davits, declarations, certi�cations, substitutions of trustees, and assignments)"; and

information or documentation to verify the assertions in such af�davits[,] [p]opularly known
as 'robosigning.'"


(Complaint ¶ 20.)  Ocwen agreed to settle the claims by entering into a Consent Judgment with


the CFPB and the attorneys general.  In the December 2013 Consent Judgment, Ocwen (along
with Ocwen Financial Corporation) agreed to, among other things, (i) provide $127.3 million as


"cash payment" to, among others, "borrowers whose homes were sold in a foreclosure sale
between and including January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012" and (ii) "provide $2 billion of relief
to consumers who meet [certain] eligibility criteria . . . to remediate harms allegedly caused by the


alleged unlawful conduct of [Ocwen]."[17]  According to the CFPB, the Consent Judgment
"addresses Ocwen's systemic misconduct at every stage of the mortgage servicing process."[18] 


Ocwen's servicing failures continue to be investigated by state and federal regulators.  For
instance, Florida's Attorney General announced on December 16, 2014 that her "of�ce and other
attorneys general on the National Mortgage Settlement Monitoring Committee have been


investigating Ocwen ever since a whistleblower came forward earlier this year with signi�cant
issues about Ocwen's internal compliance review."[19]  "[T]he states' investigation, in their


enforcement role, is directed at determining whether Ocwen provided false or misleading
information during the course of its compliance reporting."[20]


D. Federal Monitor Investigation


On December 16, 2014, a monitor appointed in United States, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et
al., No. 12-CV-361 (D.D.C. 2012) (the "Federal Monitor") issued the "Monitor's Interim Report


Regarding Compliance by Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC as Successor by Assignment from
Defendants Residential Capital LLC, GMAC Mortgage LLC, and Ally Financial Inc. for the
Measurement Periods Ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014" (the "Monitor Report").  The


Monitor Report addressed, among other things, the "independence, competency and capacity" of
Ocwen's internal quality control review group ("IRG").  (Monitor Report at 7.)  According to the


Federal Monitor, IRG's processes and procedures "lacked the critical keys to integrity mandated in
the Enforcement Terms [as de�ned in the Monitor Report]," namely "an internal quality control
group that is independent from the line of business whose performance is being measured and


an internal quality control group with the appropriate authority, privileges and knowledge to
effectively implement and conduct the reviews and metric assessments contemplated in the


Enforcement Terms."  (Id. at 13 (quotations omitted).)  The Federal Monitor identi�ed a
"dysfunctional and chaotic working environment" during the �rst half of 2014, noting "serious
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


problems and �aws in the processes and procedures" employed by the IRG.  (Id. at 13.)  Based on


these �ndings, the Federal Monitor noti�ed Ocwen that the IRG had not correctly implemented
the Enforcement Terms in a number of "material respects."  (Id. at 14.)


II. The Market Reaction


The rating agencies have cited the NYSDFS's investigation of Ocwen as a reason for their
downgrading of Ocwen's servicer rating.  The rating downgrades have increased the risk that


Ocwen will be terminated as a servicer and/or subservicer.[21]  For example, in October 2014—
months before Ocwen signed the 2014 Consent Order—Standard & Poor's downgraded Ocwen's


servicer rating to "average" following a letter by the NYSDFS to Ocwen "stating that during its
review of Ocwen's mortgage servicing practices it had uncovered serious issues with Ocwen's
systems and processes, including Ocwen's backdating of potentially hundreds of thousands of


foreclosure-related letters to borrowers."[22]  Standard & Poor's concluded that, based on the facts
uncovered in the NYSDFS investigation, Ocwen's "internal practices and policies may not meet


industry or regulatory standards."[23]  On October 22, 2014, Moody's also downgraded its
assessments of Ocwen "as a primary servicer of subprime residential mortgage loans to SQ3 from
SQ3+ and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to SQ3 from SQ3+."[24]  According to


Moody's, "[t]he assessment actions follow [the NYSDFS'] allegations," which "also raise the risk of
actions that restrict Ocwen's activities, the levying of monetary �nes against Ocwen, or additional


actions that negatively affect Ocwen's servicing stability."[25]


Ocwen's servicing failures have also led to the downgrading of Ocwen Financial Corporation's and
Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.'s corporate credit ratings.[26]  Despite the fact that the


California suspension proceeding was initiated in October 2014, after it was widely reported in
January 2015, Moody's downgraded Ocwen Financial Corporation's rating to B3.[27]  Moody's


announcement stated, "[t]he negative outlook re�ects the uncertain outcome of the DBO
[Commissioner's] regulatory action and its effects on the Ocwen's ability to operate in California. 
The negative outlook also re�ects the uncertain outcome of the National Mortgage Settlement


Monitor investigation of Ocwen launched in December 2014 as well as potential exposure to other
investigations or litigation that exist or could be prompted by recent actions taken by other


regulators."[28]  Moody's further noted that the downgrade to Home Loan Servicing Solutions,
Ltd.'s rating was driven by its business "reliance on Ocwen" and the fact that "[v]irtually all of
[Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.'s] assets were acquired from Ocwen . . . ."[29]
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Similarly, on January 16, 2015, S&P revised its outlook on Home Loan Servicing Solutions Ltd.'s


long-term issuer credit rating "to negative from stable . . . based on the risk that the company's
sole subservicer, Ocwen, could lose the right to servicing mortgages in California—[Home Loan
Servicing Solutions, Ltd.'s] largest state exposure."[30]  According to Standard & Poor's, "[t]he


negative outlook also re�ects Ocwen's broader regulatory challenges."[31]  As Ocwen Financial
Corporation acknowledged in its Quarterly Report, dated October 31, 2014, "[t]he credit rating


agencies have generally cited uncertainty regarding the impact of the regulatory scrutiny and
possible regulatory actions against us as the primary basis for their actions."  (Ocwen Financial
Corporation, Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) at 69-70 (Oct. 31, 2014).)


After the California suspension proceeding was widely reported on the night of January 12, 2015,
Ocwen Financial Corporation's shares fell over 36% the next day.[32]  Given that "virtually all of


[Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.'s] assets were acquired from Ocwen,"[33] its shares also fell
nearly 20% in the wake of this news.[34]


III. Increased Risk of Loss to Noteholders


Ocwen's admittedly widespread and pervasive servicing failures, violations of applicable law, and
the resultant governmental scrutiny and downgrade in its servicing ratings, increase the risk of


loss to the Noteholders under the Indenture.  This conclusion is supported by the risk factors set
forth in the offering memorandum related to the HSART Trust, dated January 16, 2014 (the
"Offering Memo"), which acknowledge that the type of conduct and associated events (e.g., risk of


set-off in reimbursements from the underlying trusts, governmental investigations, ratings
downgrades, inability to or delay in foreclosure on borrowers' properties) increase the risk of loss


on the Notes.
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Ocwen's admitted failure to comply with the applicable laws and standards of practice of a
prudent mortgage servicer in violation of the Master Subservicing Agreement and the


Designated Servicing Agreements also increases the risk of loss to the Noteholders.  The
Offering Memo acknowledges that "[r]eimbursement of the outstanding amount of


Advances funded by the Servicer under a Designated Servicing Agreement may be subject
to delay, reduction or set-off in the event that the Servicer breaches any of its obligations
under the related Designated Servicing Agreement, including, without limitation, any


failure to perform its servicing functions in accordance with the terms of such Designated
Servicing Agreement . . . ."  (Id. at 44; see also id. at 59-60, emphasis added.)


Ocwen's admitted misconduct related to the foreclosure process increases the risk of delays
in foreclosure and/or the inability to foreclose.  The Offering Memo acknowledges the risk
that states will impose foreclosure moratoria pending investigation of robosigning and other


servicing misconduct.  (See Offering Memo at 33).  As noted in the Offering Memo, such
foreclosure risks create a concomitant risk of delays in reimbursement of, or losses in respect


of, the Advances and, consequently, delays in payment on the Notes.  (Id. at 32, 38-39.) 
Moreover, "[a]ny actions taken to remedy any tainted foreclosure proceedings or respond to .
. . foreclosure defenses . . . may result in increasing costs and expenses of the Servicer while at


the same time increasing the time Advances are outstanding and decreasing servicing cash
�ows."  (Id. at 39.)  Further, "[s]uch increased �nancial pressures may have a negative effect on


the ability of the Servicer to pursue collection on mortgage loans that are experiencing
increased delinquencies and defaults and to maximize recoveries on the sale of underlying
properties following foreclosure."  (Id.)


Ocwen's admitted misconduct and payment of �nes increases the risk of private litigation
and governmental oversight, including in states with statutes similar to the ones Ocwen has


admitted to violating in New York.[35]  As the Offering Memo acknowledges, "adverse
resolution of such proceedings could reduce amounts distributed on the Notes."  (Id. at 56.) 
As noted, Ocwen is already facing suspension of its license in California.[36]  The Wall Street


Journal reported that "[t]he continued regulatory problems and failure to reform have
undermined market con�dence in the company to the point that it is raised concerns about


whether it can continue as an independent operation."[37]  The Journal quoted an analyst at
Compass Point Research & Trading LLC who expressed concern about the "serious and far-
reaching implications" stemming from California's scrutiny of Ocwen.[38]  Zacks, an


investment research �rm, also warned, "[i]f [Ocwen's] mortgage license is revoked, the
company will suffer tremendously as California is a major source of business.  This is


apprehended to further dent its goodwill as well as pro�tability."[39]  According to an analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, "[w]ere Ocwen to lose its California license it would impact
378,132 loans that the company services in the state."[40]  "Those loans currently carry a
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


unpaid principal balance of $95 billion or roughly 23% of Ocwen's total UPB [unpaid
balance] due."[41]  California is not the only state where Ocwen faces regulatory scrutiny.  The


Florida Attorney General recently announced that "attorneys general on the National
Mortgage Settlement Monitoring Committee have been investigating . . . whether Ocwen
provided false or misleading information during the course of its compliance reporting"


related to Ocwen's servicing practices."[42]
As the Offering Memo acknowledges, Ocwen's breaches increase the risk of payment by


Ocwen of signi�cant judgments, �nes and penalties, which affect the company's overall
�nancial position and ultimately increase the risk of loss on the Notes.   (Id. at 36, 50-51.)  A
recent article, entitled "Barclays: California Situation Could Destroy Ocwen - potential


settlement could permanently cripple nonbank," notes that "analysts are questioning if this
is the beginning of the end for the troubled nonbank."[43]  The article refers to a client note


from Barclays analysts "suggest[ing] that paying out another massive settlement may be
more than Ocwen can handle �nancially" and that "a negative outcome for Ocwen in
California could be too much for the company to recover from."[44]  The article notes that


"Ocwen may also be required to pay a civil monetary �ne as part of a potential settlement."
[45]  The market's sharp reaction demonstrates the signi�cance of Ocwen's troubles with


regulatory authorities due to its servicing failures.  As noted, after the announcement of the
California action, Ocwen Financial Corporation's and Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.'s
share price fell sharply.


Ocwen's admitted failures in servicing the loans increases the risk of the occurrence of a
Servicer Termination Event under the Designated Servicing Agreements.  Such termination,


according to the Offering Memo, "may result in delays or interruptions in payments on the
Notes (including, without limitation, if the trustee for the related MBS Trust [as de�ned in the
Offering Memo] seeks to offset the Servicer's claim for reimbursement against amounts


owed by the Servicer to the related MBS Trust following termination of the Servicer)."  (Id. at
59-60.)  If that happens, the likelihood of payment of principal and interest on the Notes is


diminished.  "The yield on [the] Notes may be impacted by . . . [t]he occurrence of any
Servicer Termination Event, Target Amortization Event, Facility Early Amortization Event or
Event of Default as described herein and in the related Supplement."  (Id. at 43.)  Indeed,


trustees in many of the Designated Servicing Agreements—including Deutsche Bank
National Trust Co., the Indenture Trustee for the HSART Trust—have already declared Events


of Default (as de�ned in the Designated Servicing Agreements) in the underlying
securitization trusts and have initiated a poll of certi�cateholders to determine whether the
Servicer should be terminated.[46]  Additionally, Ocwen Financial Corporation has


acknowledged that "[i]t is possible that additional actions by credit rating agencies could

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and funding position, including materially
changing the terms on which we may be able to borrow money."  (Id.)


IV. Events of Default Under the Indenture


A. Section 8.1(d)


Pursuant to Section 8.1(d), an Event of Default occurs when "the Servicer (itself or acting through a


Subservicer)," among others, "shall materially breach or default in the due observance or
performance of any of its covenants or agreements in this Indenture or any other Transaction
Document (subject to any cure period provided therein) . . . ."  (Indenture § 8.1(d).)  The Servicer


and/or Subservicer have materially breached or defaulted in the due observance and
performance of covenants and agreements, including Sections 10.2(d) and 10.2(e) of the Indenture


and Articles 2.3, 5.1, 5.16, and 5.17 of the Master Subservicing Agreement (a Transaction
Document).


Section 10.2 of the Indenture, titled "Covenants of Administrator and Servicer," provides, among


other things:


"(d) . . . [t]he Servicer shall not fail to comply with its obligations as the servicer under each of


the Designated Servicing Agreements, which failure would have a material adverse effect on
the interests of the Noteholders under the Indenture"; and
"(e) . . . [e]ach of the Administrator and the Servicer shall comply with all of their obligations


and duties set forth in this Indenture and any other Transaction Document."[47]


The Designated Servicing Agreements[48] require, among other things, the Servicer or


Subservicer to administer the mortgage loans included in each underlying trust in accordance
with applicable state and federal law and/or normal and usual standards of practice of prudent
mortgage servicers servicing similar mortgage loans.[49]


The Master Subservicing Agreement sets forth additional covenants:
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Article 2.3 of the Master Subservicing Agreement requires Ocwen, among other things, to


service and administer each Mortgage Loan "in accordance with Applicable Law, the terms
of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and any applicable private mortgage insurance or


pool insurance, the standards, requirements, guidelines, procedures, restrictions and
provisions of the related Subject Servicing Agreement and Underlying Documents governing
the duties of Servicer thereunder and/or any subservicer thereunder, and this Agreement


and the related Subservicing Supplement. . . . Without limiting the foregoing, Ocwen
covenants and agrees that it shall perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and


each Subservicing Supplement in a manner that will not cause the termination of Servicer
as servicer under any Subject Servicing Agreement . . . ."  (Master Subservicing Agreement
§ 2.3.)[50]


Article 5.1 of the Master Subservicing Agreement further requires Ocwen to "comply with all
Applicable Laws in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement


and each Subservicing Supplement."  (Id. § 5.1.)
Article 5.16 of the Master Subservicing Agreement requires Ocwen to "maintain the servicing
�le with respect to each Mortgage Loan pursuant to Applicable Law and customary industry


practice . . . ."  (Id. § 5.16.)
Article 5.17(d) of the Master Subservicing Agreement provides that "Ocwen shall assign an


adequate number of personnel to the performance of Ocwen's obligations under this
Agreement and the Subservicing Supplements.  Ocwen shall properly educate and train all
such personnel and ensure that all such personnel are fully quali�ed to perform the services


that they are providing and shall have passed Ocwen's customary background check for
personnel in similar provisions."  (Id. § 5.17(d).)


The facts detailed above demonstrate that the Servicer and/or Subservicer have materially
breached or defaulted in the due observance and performance of each of the foregoing
covenants and agreements.  Speci�cally, Ocwen has admitted to, among other things, having


committed "numerous and signi�cant violations" of New York state laws and regulations (2014
Consent Order at 1, 2 and ¶¶ 7, 11), engaging in "repeated non-compliance" of prior regulatory


orders (id. ¶ 7), having "inadequate and ineffective information technology systems and
personnel" (id. ¶ 13), providing borrowers "incorrect or outdated information" (id. ¶ 14), sending
borrowers "backdated letters" (id.), "maintain[ing] inaccurate records" (id.), having "insuf�cient


controls" (id.), "employ[ing] fewer trained personnel than its competitors" (id. ¶ 18), and having "
[an] inadequate infrastructure and ineffective personnel [that has] resulted in Ocwen's failure to


ful�ll its legal obligations" (id. ¶ 19).

B. Section 8.1(m)(i)


Under Section 8.1(m)(i), an Event of Default occurs when there is "an event of default under any
full-recourse, term loan facility under which a Subservicer, HLSS or Home Loan Servicing
Solutions, Ltd. is borrower, including, without limitation, the loan facility evidenced by that certain


Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement."  (Indenture § 8.1(m)(i).)  Ocwen is a party to the
Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement, pursuant to which an Event of Default (as de�ned


therein) occurs when, among other things, "[a]ny representation, warranty, certi�cation or other
statement made or deemed made by any Loan Party in any Loan Document or in any statement
or certi�cate at any time given by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in writing pursuant


hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall be false in any material respect as
of the date made or deemed made."  (Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement § 8.01(b).)


When it entered into the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement on February 15, 2013,
Ocwen represented and warranted, among other things, that it was not "in violation of any
applicable laws that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a


Material Adverse Effect [as de�ned therein]," and that it was not "subject to or in default with
respect to any . . . decrees, rules or regulations of any . . . state, . . . department, commission, board,


bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect."  (Id. § 4.22.)


Further, on September 23, 2013, Ocwen entered into Amendment No. 1 to Senior Secured Term


Loan Facility Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to Pledge and Security Agreement (the
"Amendment").  In the Amendment, Ocwen again represented and warranted that on the


Effective Date of the Amendment (as de�ned therein), "each of the representations and
warranties made by [Ocwen] contained in Article IV of the [Senior Secured Term Loan Facility
Agreement] and each other Loan Document is true and correct in all material respects (except


that any representation and warranty that is quali�ed as to 'materiality' or 'Material Adverse Effect'
shall be true and correct in all respects on and as of the Effective Date (before and after giving


effect to this Amendment), as if made on and as of such date and except to the extent that such
representations and warranties speci�cally relate to an earlier date)."  (Amendment § 4(b).)


Ocwen's representations and warranties in Section 4.22 of the Senior Secured Term Loan


Agreement and Section 4(b) of the Amendment were false because, when made, Ocwen was
engaged in widespread and pervasive violations of applicable law.  Ocwen admitted in the 2014


Consent Order that it had committed "numerous and signi�cant violations" of New York state
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee of the


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


laws and regulations and had engaged in "repeated non-compliance" of prior regulatory orders.
 (2014 Consent Order at 1, 2 and ¶¶ 7, 11.)  Ocwen also admitted that a "targeted examination" of


Ocwen conducted by the NYSDFS in June 2012 "identi�ed gaps in the servicing records of certain
loans that indicated repeated non-compliance by Ocwen, including:  (a) failing to send borrowers


a 90-day notice prior to commencing a foreclosure action as required under [RPAPL] § 1304, (b)
commencing foreclosure actions on subprime loans without af�rmatively alleging in the
complaint that Ocwen had standing to bring the foreclosure action as required by RPAPL § 1302,


and (c) commencing foreclosure actions without suf�cient documentation of its standing to do
so."  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Further, "Ocwen's systems have been backdating letters for years" and "Ocwen's


processes failed to identify and remedy these errors  . . . ."  (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.)  These facts, as well as
those discussed above, clearly establish that, as of February 15, 2013, and as of the Effective Date of
the Amendment, Ocwen was engaged in continuous violations of applicable law and regulatory


orders, in material breach of Ocwen's representations and warranties under the Senior Secured
Term Loan Facility Agreement and the Amendment.  This resulted in an Event of Default under


the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement, and consequently triggered an Event of Default
under Section 8.1(m)(i) of the Indenture.


C. Section 8.1(g)


Pursuant to Section 8.1(g) of the Indenture, an Event of Default occurs upon a "failure of the
Collateral Test at the end of any Advance Collection Period or at the close of business on . . . any


date on which a Receivable becomes ineligible by virtue of an Unmatured Default . . . ; provided,
however, that if such failure results solely from Receivables no longer being Facility Eligible
Receivables because of an Unmatured Default or monetary claim, such failure shall become an


Event of Default only if it continues unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days following the
Servicer's Responsible Of�cer's receipt of such notice of or obtaining such actual knowledge." 


(Indenture § 8.1(g).)  The Collateral Test fails for two independent reasons:  (i) Ocwen's admittedly
pervasive servicing failures and violations of law result in the right of counterparties to terminate
their contractual arrangements with Ocwen as servicer or subservicer under the Designated


Servicing Agreements, giving rise to an Unmatured Default, as a consequence of which the
Receivables under such Designated Servicing Agreements are not Facility Eligible Receivables;


and (ii) Ocwen's admittedly pervasive failures and violations of law result in the exclusion of
Designated Servicing Agreements from Facility Eligible Servicing Agreements due to Ocwen's
breach of the Master Subservicing Agreement.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-advance-r


Pursuant to the Indenture, Events of Default trigger a Facility Early Amortization Event, and vice
versa.  (Indenture §§ 1.1, 8.1(s).)  The Indenture provides an express and reasoned remedy to


compensate the Noteholders for the increased risk of loss associated with the speci�ed Events of
Default:  an increased rate of return.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Facility Early
Amortization Event, the Note Interest Rate "shall equal the applicable Note Interest Rate for such


Class plus 3.00%."  (Id. § 1.1.)  The Note Interest Rate must be increased retroactively as of the date
an Event of Default had occurred, and on a going-forward basis, accordingly.


Please be advised that this notice is without prejudice to, and with express reservation of, any
additional rights and remedies (including the right to seek acceleration of the Notes pursuant to
Section 8.2 of the Indenture) that BlueMountain has under the Indenture or otherwise.  Also,


please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions relating to the above at the telephone
number or email address listed at the top of this letter.
