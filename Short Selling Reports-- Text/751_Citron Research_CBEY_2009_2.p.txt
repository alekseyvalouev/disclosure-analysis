Background


Three weeks ago, Citron introduced readers to
Cbeyond (NASDAQ:CBEY), a sales company o�ering
bundled telecommunications services specializing
in small business customers.  Citron’s inquiry
focused on indicators of stalling growth and failure
to gain traction in new markets to match the
company’s results in its �agship city markets earlier
in the decade.


IS CBEYOND (CBEY) THE
SUBJECT OF AN
UNDISCLOSED LAW
ENFORCEMENT
INVESTIGATION? CITRON
HAS THE DOCS.

Plenty of companies are facing business headwinds,
especially in the current economic turmoil, but very
few of them are sporting forward PE’s of over 100,
and trailing PE’s of over 160.  Citron stated its
opinion that there is a gross disconnect between
perception and reality in valuing this company.


It gets worse …. Much worse


In an attempt to get clarity on the seeming large
number of customer complaints about Cbeyond
posted on the web, a Freedom of Information Act
inquiry was �led with the Federal Trade
Commission.


What was returned was a 100+ page �le of
customer complaints – and a lot of them are very
serious indeed.  Many of them represent very
serious losses encountered by businesses either
contracting with Cbeyond for service, or those
trying to cancel and go elsewhere.  One recurring
pattern is Cbeyond stalling when required to turn
over a customer’s phone numbers to a new �rm. As
usual, Citron provides the link so you can read for
yourself.

“Law Enforcement Investigation”


Of even more concern is that over 100 pages of
documentation were speci�cally withheld by the
FTC because, as it cites, the documents were
obtained by the Commission “in a law enforcement
investigation”.  We doubt shareholders will be
happy to learn of this from Citron rather than from
a company 8-K �ling, as required to disclose
material events.  See paragraph 4 here:

The numbers are worse than we originally thought

in these three markets.  This shows what really
happens to CBEY when they enter new
markets….good luck in Seattle.

None have yet “turned the corner” and Citron
believes competitive challenges combined with the
recession’s harsh economic realities render these
new markets unlikely to generate cash �ow
pro�tability for the foreseeable future.


Meanwhile the company burned free cash at the
following rate:

FY
2008


Q1

Free

�ow

($4.3m) ($5.4m) ($9.3m) ($2.3m)


Conclusion


Red �ags are abounding here.  Citron will continue
to follow the story, but reiterates its opinion that
CBEY is generously overvalued at half its current
share price.
