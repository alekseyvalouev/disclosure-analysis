USA	Graphite:	Why	This	$100	Million	Company	Could	Fall	By	85%	Or
More

There	seems	to	be	a	general	consensus	lately	among	active	penny	stock	traders	that
graphite	is	the	new	stevia.


For	anyone	who	is	new	to	trading	penny	stocks,	the	Stevia	sector	was	red	hot	between	Q4
2011	-	Q1	2012	as	three	of	the	most	actively	traded	public	companies	all	operated	in	the
stevia	sector.	All	three	were	subject	to	stock	promotion	campaigns	and	two	in	particular
generated	substantial	short-term	gains	before	falling	75%	and	90%,	respectively.


Fast	forward	twelve	months	and	now	it	is	all	about	graphite	stocks	trading	on	the	OTC
Bulletin	Board.	Between	National	Graphite	Corp.	(OTCQB:NGRC),	Graphite	Corp.
(OTC:GRPH)	and	USA	Graphite	Inc.	(OTC:USGT)	there	seems	to	be	no	shortage	of
graphite	exploration	companies	entering	the	public	marketplace	with	absurd	valuations
that	are	the	subject	of	large-scale	stock	promotion	campaigns.


Although	the	team	at	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	has	followed	these	graphite	stocks
since	they	first	began	trading,	in	light	of	Graphite	Corporation's	recent	50%	decline	we
have	decided	to	publish	a	two-part	research	report	on	USA	Graphite	in	order	to	help	us
determine	whether	the	company	will	either:


Follow	in	the	footsteps	of	several	other	promoted	OTCBB	graphite	stocks	with	more
favorable	price-to-book	ratios	that	fell	as	much	as	86%;	or


Put	together	the	right	team	and	obtain	all	necessary	capital	requirements	in	order	to
execute	the	business	plan.


Part	I	of	this	research	report	will	compare	USA	Graphite	to	the	other	graphite	exploration
companies	trading	on	the	OTCBB	in	order	to	determine	any	correlation	between	the
graphite	stocks	that	are	subject	to	stock	promotion	campaigns	and	their	underlying
intrinsic	value.


We	will	also	take	a	close	look	at	the	current	stock	promotion	campaign	featuring	USA
Graphite	-	including	over	one	hundred	unsolicited	emails	that	our	team	has	received	to
date.

This	research	report	in	its	entirety	will	provide	the	material	information	necessary	for
investors	to	determine	whether	or	not	a	pre-revenue	exploration	company	with	$2,212
total	assets	is	fairly	valued	at	$100,000,000	dollars.


The	Micro	Cap	Graphite	Sector


One	recent	press	release	disseminated	by	USA	Graphite	Inc.	suggests	that	domestic
graphite	resources	are	low.	Despite	the	possibility	of	a	graphite	shortage,	it	is	the	opinion
of	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	that	the	number	of	"going	concern"	graphite	stocks	trading
with	lofty	market	caps	on	the	OTCBB	is	at	an	all-time	high.


Currently	there	are	five	graphite	stocks	listed	on	the	OTCBB	and	China	Carbon	Graphite
Corp.	(OTCPK:CHGI)	is	the	only	one	of	them	that	has	been	around	for	more	than	twelve
months.	The	remaining	four	graphite	stocks	just	recently	became	public	entities	through
an	alternative	method	of	going	public	that	circumnavigates	some	of	the	typical	red-tape
associated	with	the	conventional	IPO	process.


Here	are	the	five	companies	for	our	analysis:

Market	Performance


To	date,	the	four	most	newly-listed	OTCBB	graphite	stocks	that	just	began	trading	during
the	past	nine	months	have	lost	an	average	44%	from	their	peaks.	This	is	despite	the	fact
that	three	of	these	stocks	have	been	featured	in	large-scale	investor	awareness

campaigns.	Or	perhaps	that	is	the	reason	for	the	declines?


Performance:	USA	Graphite	Corp.


Shares	closed	on	Friday,	January	25	2012	at	$0.69,	representing	a	27%	decline	from	its
peak	on	January	8,	2013.	Despite	the	drop,	shares	have	since	rebounded	and	are	still
38%	higher	than	where	they	started	trading	when	the	stock	promotion	campaign	began
about	five	weeks	ago	on	December	5,	2012.


Performance:	Graphite	Corp.


Shares	of	GRPH	have	been	cut	in	half	since	hitting	its	peak	over	twelve	weeks	ago	on
October	26,	2012.	The	stock	is	trading	about	54%	lower	since	the	promotional	campaign
kicked-off.	It	is	interesting	to	note	that	it	only	took	two	days	for	GRPH	shares	to	peak	after
the	start	of	its	stock	promotion	campaign.

Performance:	National	Graphite	Corp.


Shares	of	National	Graphite	stock	jumped	from	$0.40	to	a	high	of	$1.24	during	the	first
two	weeks	of	October,	representing	a	210%	gain.	The	gains	were	short	lived,	however,	as
the	stock	dropped	78%	in	the	eleven	days	after	hitting	its	peak.


The	table	below	showcases	the	stock	performance	for	the	four	most	newly-listed	OTCBB
graphite	stocks.	Three	of	them	have	already	been	featured	in	stock	promotion	campaigns
and	have	fallen	by	as	much	as	86%.	To	date	there	is	only	one	stock	in	this	peer	group	that
has	not	been	part	of	a	stock	promotion	campaign	-	American	Graphite	Technologies.

TICKER: START	DATE: START	PRICE: PEAK	DATE: PEAK	PRICE: CURRENT	PRICE:


USGT 12/5/2012 $0.50 1/8/2013 $0.93 $0.69


GRPH 10/24/2012 $0.75 10/26/2012 $0.94 $0.35


NGRC 9/5/2012 $0.40 10/16/2012 $1.24 $0.18


AGIN N/A N/A N/A N/A $0.44


NGRC	was	the	first	graphite	stock	to	be	promoted	back	on	September	5,	2012	and
since	then	it	has	lost	86%	of	its	value.


GRPH	was	the	second	graphite	stock	to	be	promoted	back	on	October	24,	2012	and
since	then	it	has	lost	54%	of	its	value.


Since	the	first	promoted	graphite	stock	has	experienced	the	largest	drop	from	its	peak	and
the	latest	promoted	graphite	stock	is	still	above	its	starting	price	we	believe	that	there	is	an
inverse	correlation	between	time	and	a	promoted	stock's	performance.	This	would
conclude	that	USGT	may	experience	an	even	greater	than	86%	drop	and	ample	evidence
exists	in	the	next	two	sections	to	support	our	claim.


Red	Flags	For	Reverse	Merger	Graphite	Stocks


Have	you	noticed	that	China	Carbon	Graphite	Group	(OTCPK:CHGI)	has	not	been
mentioned	even	once	since	we	began	discussing	the	promotional	campaigns	of	the	most
newly	listed	OTCBB	graphite	stocks?	Of	course	that	is	because	it	has	never	been
promoted,	but	is	it	a	coincidence	that	the	only	OTCBB	graphite	stock	not	to	be	promoted
(besides	AGIN)	is	the	one	generating	revenues?


Paid	Stock	Promotion


Graphite	or	no	graphite	-	whenever	an	unrelated	third	party	shareholder	foots	a	big	cash
budget	to	kick-off	an	investor	awareness	campaign,	it	should	be	an	ongoing	concern	in	the
minds	of	investors.	What	are	the	motives	of	that	third	party	shareholder	and	why	are	they
paying	for	the	promotional	campaign?	Is	that	shareholder	seeking	to	liquidate	large
amounts	of	stock?	In	the	OTCBB	marketplace	we	believe	the	answer	to	that	last	question
is	almost	always	yes.

Stock	Promotion:	USA	Graphite	Inc.


USA	Graphite	Inc.	has	been	the	subject	of	an	aggressive	stock	promotion	campaign
beginning	in	early	December	2012.	According	to	the	legal	disclaimer	at	the	bottom	of	a
USGT	promotional	email,	a	third	party	identified	as	"Wimtak	Systems,	Ltd."	paid	$800,000
cash	for	a	promotion	involving	newsletters	such	as	"Wall	Street	Penny	Stock	Advisors",
"Obscure	Stocks"	and	"Stock	Castle."	We	have	also	received	over	one	hundred
unsolicited	emails	pertaining	to	USA	Graphite,	which	we	will	elaborate	on	in	the	next
section.


Below	is	an	annotated	copy	of	the	USGT	legal	disclaimer	stating:	"compensated	a	total	of
eight	hundred	thousand	dollars	to	date	from	Wintak	Systems	LTD."


Stock	Promotion:	National	Graphite	Corp.	and	Graphite	Corp.


Keep	in	mind	that	the	purpose	of	this	research	report	is	to	shed	light	on	USA	Graphite's
$100,000,000	dollar	valuation	and	to	highlight	the	correlation	(or	perhaps	more	accurately
the	reverse	correlation)	between	promoted	and	non-promoted	OTCBB	graphite	stocks	and
their	intrinsic	values.	However,	it	is	important	to	lay	the	foundation	for	the	other	promoted
OTCBB	graphite	stocks	in	order	to	ensure	that	USA	Graphite	is	not	an	outlier.


Graphite	Corp.	was	originally	incorporated	in	Nevada	on	August	3,	2007	and	became	a
publicly	traded	entity	in	June	2012	although	it	hardly	traded	a	single	share	until	late
October.	This	was	right	around	the	exact	time	when	a	promotional	landing	page	appeared

on	the	web.	Graphite	Corporation's	lack	of	substance	was	replaced	with	hyperbole	and	a
trading	advisor	that	found	Graphite	Corp.	to	be	the	single	best	opportunity	in	the	market.	It
is	not	until	you	read	the	tiny	font	at	the	end	of	the	advertisement	that	you	learn	everything
contained	in	the	issue	of	Jim	Hyerczyk's	The	Industry	Growth	Report	Newsletter	is
completely	biased.	According	to	the	legal	disclaimer,	"Greenstone	Media,	LLC,	the	third
party	advertiser,	is	managing	a	budget	of	$2,500,000"	so	it	should	come	as	no	surprise
that	Jim	Hyerczyk's	near-term	forecast	of	$2.00	was	nonsensical	and	completely
unsubstantiated.


Several	days	after	Graphite	Corporation's	share	volume	began	ramping	up,	an	entity
doing	business	as	Providence	Media	Strategies	LLC	joined	the	promotional	campaign	and
began	promoting	the	stock	through	a	number	of	their	paid	newsletters	including	Five	Star
Equities,	Bedford	Report	and	Paragon	Report.


National	Graphite	Corp.,	on	the	other	hand,	executed	what	seemed	like	two	separate,
short-lived	stock	promotion	campaigns	between	early	October	and	Early	December	2012.
At	first	NGRC	was	the	featured	stock	pick	by	OutOfTheBoxStox	(owned	by	Hennesey
Road	Media	LLC).	Shortly	thereafter	a	promotional	landing	page	featuring	Mike	Casson's
MicroCap	Marketplace	went	live	and	the	stock	hit	a	high	of	$1.24.	Then	roughly	six	weeks
later	John	Bell's	Hack	The	Stock	Market	newsletter	began	featuring	NGRC	after	it	had	just
rebounded	from	$0.35	to	nearly	$1.00.	As	of	January	25,	2013	the	stock	traded	below
$0.20.

Receipt	of	Unsolicited	Commercial	Emails	(SPAM)


As	this	research	report	unfolds	we	continue	to	learn	that	legitimate	companies	with	real
operations	like	China	Carbon	Graphite	Group	have	no	need	to	resort	to	stock	promotion
because	they	are	building	real	businesses	and	that	begs	the	question:


Is	USA	Graphite	Inc.	a	legitimate	company	with	real	operations?


Up	until	this	point	even	the	most	questionable	stock	promotion	campaigns	fell	within	the
confines	of	the	law.	However,	it	is	our	opinion	that	USA	Graphite	is	currently	in	the	midst	of
a	mass	email	campaign	that	may	be	walking	a	very	fine	line	with	the	CAN-SPAM	Act.


Seeking	Alpha	contributors	have	already	written	reports	on	this	subject	and	we,	like	those
contributors,	are	currently	receiving	a	tremendous	number	of	unsolicited	emails	that
discuss	USGT.

Due	to	a	significant	increase	in	the	number	of	unsolicited	spam	emails	hitting	the	inboxes
of	team	members	at	the	Fraud	Research	Institute,	a	decision	was	made	way	back	in	April
2012	to	retain	an	outside	consultant	that	would	be	responsible	for	identifying,	subscribing
to,	and	tracking	all	stock	market	newsletters.


His	duty	is	to	oversee	all	finance-related	computer	mediated	communications	("CMC")
with	two	primary	objectives:


1.	Continually	update	a	list	of	all	active	stock	market	newsletters	that	offer	free
subscriptions	via	email	opt-in;	and


2.	Track	emails	received	and	identify	all	possible	sources	of	unsolicited	emails.


Our	CMC	initiative	has	recently	identified	a	record	number	of	unsolicited	emails	received
from	unknown	senders	and	over	50%	of	these	unsolicited	emails	mention	USA	Graphite
Inc.


The	image	below	is	one	example	of	the	content	typically	found	in	the	unsolicited	emails
that	our	team	began	received	on	December	4,	2012.	This	particular	message	was	sent
from	an	email	address	registered	at	Outlook.com,	an	email	service	owned	by	Microsoft
Corp.	(NASDAQ:MSFT):


Conclusion


The	big	takeaway	from	Part	I	is	that	legitimate	businesses	have	no	reason	to	subject
themselves	to	stock	promotion	and,	because	unaffiliated	third	party	shareholders	of	USA
Graphite	are	subjecting	the	company	to	extremely	questionable	stock	promotion	tactics
that	may	even	lead	to	a	lawsuit,	there	is	no	way	possible	to	justify	USA	Graphite's

$100,000,000	dollar	market	cap.	So	far	we	have	identified	questionable	stock	promotions,
$2,212	total	assets	and	zero	revenues	as	indefensible	truths	that	support	our	opinion	that
USGT's	$100,000,000	dollar	market	cap	is	beyond	lofty.


In	Part	II	we	will	dig	deeper	into	USA	Graphite's	financial	statements	and	the	backgrounds
of	the	management	team	along	with	the	affiliates	of	the	company.	By	the	end	of	Part	II	our
goal	is	to	go	way	beyond	proving	that	the	company	is	not	worth	$100,000,000	dollars	(that
already	seems	fairly	obvious).	Rather,	our	objective	is	to	come	up	with	a	method	to	fairly
value	this	pre-revenue	graphite	exploration	company.
