In 2015, Toshiba Corp. (TYO: 6502) admitted to deliberately manipulating its accounting policies in 


order to overstate its profits by USD 1.2 billion (¥152 billion) from FY 2008 to 2014.  Toshiba’s stock 


declined 70%, Japanese securities regulators imposed a record fine, and Toshiba’s CEO and 8 of its 


16 board members resigned in disgrace.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange even placed Toshiba’s stock “on 


alert,” raising the possibility that the Company’s stock could be delisted if it failed to correct 


deficiencies in its corporate governance.   





In our opinion, Itochu Corporation (Tokyo: 8001) (“Itochu” or the “Company”) will likely become 


the next Japanese company to be forced to restate its financials and admit to accounting impropriety.  


In FY 2016, Itochu surpassed traditional giants Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. to claim the title 


of Japan’s most profitable trading company.  Itochu’s rise has been startling: since the appointment 


of Masahiro Okafuji (“Okafuji”) as president, Itochu’s net income has risen 87%.  





We believe that Itochu’s record profits are merely a mirage.  We have conducted a thorough review 


of the publicly available information, and we believe that Itochu overstated FY 2015 net profits by 


inappropriately reclassifying its stake in a Colombian coal mining JV to intentionally avoid taking a 


¥153 billion impairment when the value of the investment had declined significantly.   





Furthermore, we do not believe that Itochu should be permitted to consolidate profits from CITIC 


under the equity method, given that CITIC is operated and majority-owned by the Chinese 


government, meaning that it is highly unlikely that Itochu can have any significant influence over 


CITIC’s strategy, operations or policy-making.  Deconsolidating CITIC would mean that Itochu’s 


forecasted net profits would fall by 20%. 





We are also highly suspicious of the ¥60 billion (after-tax) one-time gain recognized on the 


reclassification of its minority investment in Ting Hsin, given the suspicious timing of the gain and 


the declining profitability of the investment.  We do not find it credible that Itochu magically 


discovered a ¥60 billion one-time (after-tax) gain only four weeks before the end of FY 2015, 


when Itochu was set to miss guidance by ¥60 billion. 





Toshiba was almost destroyed by a scandal for overstating earnings by ¥152 billion over seven years.  


We believe that in FY 2015 alone, Itochu may have overstated net profits by ¥153 billion by 


reclassifying its coal mining investment without recognizing an impairment to its consolidated 


accounts.  This alone would have reduced Itochu’s reported net income (¥300 billion) by 51% to ¥147 


billion.  





Based on our analysis, which we present in full in this report, we believe that Itochu will be embroiled 


in an accounting scandal as large as Toshiba.  Accordingly, we value Itochu at ¥631.00 per share, a 


downside of 50% from its current traded price. 


 
* A note of caution.  In Itochu’s English language filings, Itochu refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015, as FY 2015.  
In its Japanese language filings, the same year is referred to as FY 2014.  This is incredibly confusing.  Accordingly, in this 


report we will refer to the year ending March 31, 2015, as FY 2015, consistent with the Company’s English language filings.  
In the Japanese translation of this report, provided only for convenience, we will refer to the same year as FY 2014 to match 


the description in Itochu’s Japanese language filings.

1. Inappropriate Reclassification Wrongly Inflated Profits by ¥153 Billion in FY 2015.  In October 2011, Itochu 
acquired a 20% equity interest in Drummond International, LLC (the “Drummond JV”), which owned, operated and 


controlled the Colombian coal mining operations of American mining giant, the Drummond Company. Itochu paid USD 


1.5 billion, a deal which valued the mining operation, at the time, at USD 7.5 billion.  By FY 2015, Itochu carried its 


interest in the Drummond JV at ¥198 billion on its balance sheet.  But given the drastic underperformance of the 


investment, it is our opinion that by FY 2015, Itochu’s interest in the Drummond JV was worth no more than ¥45 billion 


and that by not recognizing an impairment, Itochu overstated its net income by at least ¥153 billion that year. 





a. A Bad Investment. Almost immediately following Itochu’s investment, the price of thermal coal declined from 
a 2011 peak of USD 132 to lows of USD 47 in 2016, a 64% fall in the commodity price.  To make matters 


worse, strikes and operational difficulties hampered production at the mines.  Coal production was 26% below 


the forecasted production levels from FY 2013 through FY 2015.  The investment was so troubled that even 


Bloomberg declared that the Drummond JV’s Colombian mining assets were worth only USD 3 billion in 2013, 


60% lower than their value at the time of Itochu’s investment, and coal prices continued to decline from 


there. 





b. Reclassification as Manipulation to Avoid Recognizing Losses.  On its Q3 FY 2015 conference call, Itochu’s 
management stated that in light of the “coal price declines and the strike history,” it “will be difficult to recover 


the investment.”  Yet rather than recognizing a loss or impairment, in FY 2015, Itochu inappropriately 


reclassified its stake in the Drummond JV from an “Investment in an Associate” to an “Other Investment,” 


which is recorded at FVTOCI (Fair Value to Other Comprehensive Income).  Furthermore, Itochu did not record 


a loss or impairment upon reclassification in its consolidated accounts. This allowed Itochu to deconsolidate 


the Drummond JV and meant that no loss or impairment of the investment would impact Itochu’s reported net 


profits or earnings. In our opinion, Itochu’s reclassification was inappropriate under prevailing accounting 


rules and motivated solely to avoid recognizing losses on its failed investment in the Drummond JV. 





c. The Significant Influence Test.  Under IFRS accounting standards, the decision whether a minority investment 
is considered an “investment in an associate,” and thus consolidated into earnings, is governed by IAS 28 and 


the “significant influence” test.  Under IAS 28, a holding of 20% or more of the voting equity of an entity 


creates a presumption of significant influence and generally requires that the investment be treated as an 


investment in an associate.   





i. Presumption Works Against Itochu’s Reclassification.  Since 2011, Itochu has owned a 20% stake 
in the Drummond JV, therefore the presumption is that its stake should be considered an investment 


in an associate.  This presumption is likely even stronger in this case because from FY 2012-2014, 


Itochu classified its stake in the Drummond JV as an investment in an associate, and its 20% equity 


interest did not change before, during or after reclassification.   





ii. Five Factor Test.  According to IAS 28, Itochu can only rebut the presumption in favor of 
consolidation if it can “clearly demonstrate” that it does not have “significant influence,” measured 


by five factors.  The presence of any one of the five factors is likely sufficient to confirm “significant 


influence” when an investor like Itochu holds a 20% interest in the Drummond JV.  As our analysis 


shows, all five factors indicate that Itochu has significant influence over the Drummond JV. 





 Factor #1: Representation on the Board.  Since signing the deal, Itochu has stationed a number of 
full time employees in Birmingham, Alabama, to “supervise” the Drummond JV’s operation of the 


Colombian mining business.  These employees are currently led by Kotaro Suzuki, the President and 


CEO of Itochu Coal America and Itochu’s highest ranking executive in America.  When an 


investigator contacted Kotaro Suzuki and asked him his title, Mr. Suzuki described himself as 


Chairman of the Board at the Drummond JV and current CEO of Itochu Coal Americas.  This 


indicates that not only does Itochu have representation on the Board of the Drummond JV, but also 


that Itochu’s executive likely serves in a leadership role.   





o President of Drummond JV.  A public record search lists Kazuo Inagaki, one of Mr. Suzuki’s 
predecessors, as the “President” of the Drummond JV.  This is more evidence that Itochu’s 


executives are in a position of oversight, control, leadership and influence over the Drummond 


JV.

ITOCHU Corporation │ Tokyo: 8001                                www.glaucusresearch.com 





 Factor #2: Participation in the Policy Making Process.  Mr. Suzuki, Itochu’s top executive at 
Itochu Coal Americas, Inc., stated that he was the chairman of the board of the Drummond JV.  In 


addition, according to an Itochu management presentation, Itochu’s “function in the Joint Venture” 


was for its Alabama-based management team to serve as a “supervisor” of the business.  By 


Itochu’s own admission, it not only participates in the policy making process, but occupies a 


leadership role.   





 Factor #3: Material Transactions Between the Investor and Investees. As part of its 
investment, Itochu obtained the exclusive rights to market coal mined by the Drummond JV in 


Japan and to cooperate with the Drummond parent company in the marketing and sale of the coal 


to utilities and other customers throughout Asia. 





 Factor #4: Interchange of Managerial personnel.  Itochu sent Mr. Suzuki and other colleagues 
to work out of the same building as the Drummond parent company in Alabama.   





 Factor #5: Provision of technical information.  Itochu stated in its presentation that one of its 
functions in the joint venture was to leverage “Itochu’s short and long term logistic know how.”  


Presumably Itochu is referring to technical expertise in the logistical operation of the mine. 





iii. Five for Five.  Itochu’s investment in the Drummond JV easily meets all the requirements to be 
considered an investment in an associate under prevailing accounting rules.  First, Itochu’s stake meets 


the 20% threshold, creating the strong presumption in favor of consolidation.  Furthermore, Itochu 


accounted for the investment as an associate from FY 2012-2014, strengthening the presumption. 


Finally, Itochu’s relationship with the Drummond JV indicates the presence of all five factors that 


would typically accompany “significant influence” led by the leadership role of Itochu’s senior 


executive on the board of the JV. 





d. Restatement of Accounts and at Least a ¥153 Billion Reduction in FY 2015 Net Profit.  By any economic 
measure, Itochu’s investment was a failure and accounting rules dictate that Itochu should have taken a write-


down or impairment to the carrying value of the Drummond JV.  It did not.  Instead, Itochu reclassified its 


investment, an accounting gimmick that we believe was clearly inappropriate under the governing accounting 


rules (IAS 28).  As of Itochu’s FY 2015 balance sheet, the carrying value of its investment in the Drummond JV 


was ¥198 billion.  Bloomberg independently valued Itochu’s share of the Drummond mines at ¥60 billion in 


July 2013.  Comparing the Drummond mine to other coal mining companies, we estimate that Itochu’s stake 


was worth only ¥45 billion in FY 2015.  As a result, we believe that instead of inappropriately reclassifying the 


investment, Itochu should have taken an impairment in FY 2015 of at least ¥153 billion.  Itochu’s reported 


net income was ¥300 billion in FY 2015, so this restatement would have reduced net profits by 51%! We believe 


that this misconduct should trigger a regulatory investigation and that Itochu should be forced to restate at least 


its FY 2015 financial statements to reduce the Company’s reported net profit by ¥153 billion. 





2. Consolidation of CITIC Inflates Projected Profits by 20%.  On January 20, 2015, Itochu agreed to invest ¥600 billion 
to buy a 10% stake of CITIC Ltd (HK: 267) (“CITIC”).  Based on our analysis, we believe that Itochu’s stake in CITIC 


should not be consolidated using the equity accounting method.  CITIC accounts for 20% of Itochu’s projected net 


income, so if Itochu is forced to reclassify this investment, Itochu will have to materially reduce forecasted profits.  





a. Does Itochu Really Have “Significant Influence” over the Chinese Communist Party?  In order to be 
deemed an investment in an associate, accounting rules dictate that Itochu must have “significant influence” 


over the investee.  CITIC is 58.13% owned by CITIC Group Corp (“CITIC Parent”)– a company wholly-owned 


by the Chinese government.  According to its website, “the national interests represent CITIC Group’s core 


interests. CITIC Group follows the excellent tradition in putting the national interests above all else.”  Given 


that CITIC is majority owned and controlled by the Chinese government, we think it is extremely unlikely that 


Itochu can have “significant influence” on CITIC’s policies and financial decisions.

b. Five Factor Test.  We believe, based on our analysis of the five factors, that Itochu has nowhere close to the 


level of “significant influence” required to treat its CITIC stake as an investment in an associate.  Indeed, CITIC 


has stated publicly that its executives meet with Itochu’s management “every six months to talk about 


cooperation,” which hardly suggests that Itochu is influencing policy making.  In addition, we are aware of no 


material transactions between Itochu and CITIC, no interchange of managerial personnel, and no provision by 


Itochu of technical information to CITIC. Itochu holds its investment through a 50:50 JV with the Charoen 


Pokphand Group (“CP”). The JV, China Tai Bright Investment Company Limited (“CT Holdings”), has the right 


to appoint two board members to CITIC. In practice, we believe this confers no real influence as neither 


appointed board member appears to have any connection to either CT Holdings or Itochu.

3. Ting Hsin: Reclassification and Unusual Gain Save Itochu’s FY 2015 Earnings.  Itochu is considered a darling of 
the Nikkei 225 because it always manages to hit its guidance forecast and, so Itochu claims, the majority of its profits are 


derived from the non-resource sector.  But our analysis of Itochu’s financial statements indicates that it only made its FY 


2015 earnings forecast because of an unusual gain from a familiar and questionable source: the reclassification of an 


investment from an “investment in an associate” to an “other investment.”   





a. Form Over Substance. We question the justification, timing and the amount of this reclassification.  Itochu had 
held a 18.7% equity stake in Ting Hsin since 2010.  Despite almost no change to its underlying ownership, in 


FY 2015, Itochu dissolved a JV with Asahi through which it held its stake in Ting Hsin and reclassified the 


investment, giving the Company a pretext to recognize a one-time, non-cash gain.   





b. Questionable One-Time Gain Magically Appeared Just before FYE.  Itochu looked set to miss earnings in 
FY 2015 by ¥60 billion.  Yet just four weeks before the end of the fiscal year, Itochu reclassified its investment 


in Ting Hsin and recognized a one-time, (after-tax) non-cash gain from the reclassification of ¥60 billion, just 


enough so that Itochu hit its target.  The fact that Itochu waited until the last minute to recognize this gain 


indicates, in our opinion, that Itochu is simply manipulating the accounting rules to serve its short term needs.  


We also question the justification for such a gain, considering Itochu’s share of Ting Hsin’s net profit has 


declined from ¥6.8 billion in FY 2010 (the year of the acquisition) to ¥3.3 billion in FY 2015.  We do not have 


enough information to value Itochu’s stake in Ting Hsin, but we find it highly suspicious that the amount of the 


after-tax gain (¥60.5 billion) was just enough to allow Itochu hit its earnings forecast and make up a ¥60 billion 


profit shortfall in the last four weeks of FY 2015.

Valuation: Toshiba Part II.  Once famous Japanese trading companies have been hit hard by declining commodity prices 
and ill-advised foreign investments.  Despite having a similar business model, and being subject to the same secular 


headwinds and commodity prices as other trading houses, Itochu has largely avoided the major impairments and write-


downs that have affected its peers.1  For the first time, in FY 2016, Itochu reported the highest net income of any of the big-


5 Japanese trading houses.  The misperception that Itochu’s net profits are driven by its non-resource segment and that it has 


not been affected by the large write downs recognized by other trading houses, has driven its stock price higher than its 


rivals.  We believe that this is entirely inappropriate.  The investors, shareholders and employees of the other Japanese 


trading houses have been punished with large write-downs because their companies have, with some exceptions, abided by 


the Prime Minister’s campaign of corporate governance and recognized impairments.  In our opinion, Itochu has not. 





As this report demonstrates, we believe that Itochu overstated FY 2015 net profits by at least ¥153 billion by reclassifying 


its stake in the Drummond JV without taking a loss, even though the value of the investment had declined significantly.  In 


our opinion, there is evidence of intent to manipulate.  Itochu first claimed, in Q3 FY 2015, that reclassification was justified 


because its stake “might fall” below 20%.  Indeed, Itochu’s CFO even stated publicly that the Company would reduce its 


stake in the Drummond JV.2  It never did.  Then, in its 2015 Annual Report, Itochu completely changed its justification for 


reclassification, stating that although it still owned a 20% stake in the Drummond JV, it did not have “significant influence.”  


In retrospect, Itochu appears so desperate to avoid a large impairment that it concocted two different, equally implausible 


reasons to reclassify its investment.  In our opinion, Itochu’s changing story shows that the Company was intent on 


inappropriately avoiding the loss, regardless of whether it was permitted to do so by the rules of accounting. 





We also do not believe that Itochu should be able to consolidate profits from CITIC under the equity method, given that 


CITIC is operated and majority-owned by the Chinese government, meaning that it is highly unlikely that Itochu can have 


any significant influence over CITIC’s strategy, operations or policy-making.  Deconsolidating CITIC would mean that 


Itochu’s forecasted net profits would fall by 20%. 





We are also highly suspicious of the ¥60 billion (after-tax) one-time gain recognized on the reclassification of Ting Hsin, 


given the declining profitability of the investment.  We simply do not find it credible that Itochu magically discovered a 


¥60 billion four weeks before the end of the fiscal year when the Company was set to miss guidance by ¥60 billion. 





Since 2011, Itochu has raised over ¥300 billion of bonds from investors that have based their investment decision on the 


accuracy and integrity of Itochu’s reported profits.  Toshiba Corp was fined by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance 


Commission because it had misled bond investors by padding results.3  We believe that Itochu could face a similar fate. 


Toshiba was almost destroyed by a scandal for overstating earnings by ¥152 billion over seven years.  We believe that in 


FY 2015 alone, Itochu overstated net profits by ¥153 billion.  Toshiba’s stock declined 70%, peak-to-trough.  In our opinion, 


Itochu faces a similar crisis of confidence in its corporate governance and accounting practices.  We believe that like Toshiba, 


any form of independent inquiry, either by regulators or an independent investigation committee, may reveal even more 


problems at Itochu than we can glean from the publicly available information.  But based on the current information available 


to investors for analysis, we value Itochu’s shares at 50% below their current traded price.

WINDS OF CHANGE 





Times are changing in Japan.   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently launched a corporate governance campaign to 


increase accountability, transparency and ethical accounting practices at Japanese public companies.  Mr. Abe’s aim 


is noble.  He is trying to kick-start the Japanese markets by bringing Japanese companies up to higher standards of 


corporate governance.   





Since the Olympus scandal, a wave of corporate governance and accounting scandals have washed over the Japanese 


markets.  According to the Financial Times, around 200 Japanese firms have become embroiled in accounting scandals 


since FY 2011.  This trend is only accelerating as a result of Prime Minister Abe’s drive to clean up Japanese markets.  


In FY 2015-2016, a record 58 Japanese-listed companies disclosed improper accounting, malfeasance or fraud. 





 
Source: Financial Times 





The problem, however, as described recently in the Financial Times, is that Japanese “investors are not getting a lot 


of help setting their minds at ease because the level of forensic analysis on the sell-side in Japan is low.”  This has 


created a vacuum of critical analysis in the Japanese financial markets and has allowed some Japanese companies to 


misrepresent their financial performance to investors.   





In our opinion, Itochu Corporation (Tokyo: 8001) (“Itochu” or the “Company”) may be next.  Itochu surpassed 


traditional giants Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. to claim the title of Japan’s most profitable trading company in 


FY 2016.  Since the appointment of Masahiro Okafuji (“Mr. Okafuji”), Itochu’s net income has risen 87% (FYs 2010 


– 2016), despite deteriorating commodities prices and a secular weakening of the Company’s core market.     





We have conducted a thorough review of the publicly available information, and we believe that Itochu has 


inappropriately inflated its net income and earnings by manipulating key accounting policies to avoid impairments 


and revaluation losses on failed acquisitions and underperforming assets.  Based on our analysis, we believe that 


Itochu will be embroiled in an accounting scandal as large as Toshiba.  Accordingly, we value Itochu at ¥631.00 per 


share, a downside of 50% from its current traded price.

PROFITS INAPPROPRIATELY INFLATED BY ¥153 BILLION IN FY 2015 





The smoking gun in Itochu’s financials is its accounting treatment of an investment in a Colombian coal mining 


operation.  We believe that Itochu has inappropriately manipulated its financial statements to avoid recognizing the 


losses from its failed investment on its consolidated accounts.  By removing the effects of such losses from its net 


income and earnings, we believe that Itochu has inappropriately inflated its reported net profits of ¥300 billion in FY 


2015 by at least ¥153 billion.  We believe that the Company will be required to restate its FY 2015 financials, reducing 


net profits by at least 51% on this basis alone.4 





In October 2011, Itochu announced the acquisition of a 20% equity interest in Drummond International, LLC (the 


“Drummond JV”), which owned, operated and controlled the Colombian coal mining operations of American mining 


giant, the Drummond Company.  At the time of the deal, the mine produced high quality thermal coal and was the 4th 


largest coal mine in the world, measured by volume of exports.5  The Drummond JV also owned a nearby port with a 


capacity of 30 MMTPA, and 41% of a rail line running from the mines to the port.   





In exchange for its 20% equity stake, Itochu invested USD 1.5 billion (¥126.5 billion).6  The deal valued the mining 


operation at USD 7.5 billion and closed in October 2011.7  In addition, Itochu also received the exclusive rights to 


market coal from the mine to customers in Japan and to cooperate with Drummond in the marketing and sale of coal 


to utilities and other customers throughout Asia.8  By FY 2015, Itochu carried its interest in the Drummond JV at ¥198 


billion on its balance sheet.9

Upon completion of the transaction, Itochu classified its investment in the Drummond JV as an investment in an 


associate under the equity method.  Accordingly, Itochu was able to book 20% of the Drummond JV’s net income 


to its own profits and losses.

impairment until FY 2016, we calculate that its interest in the Drummond mine would be worth even less.

1) A Bad Investment  
 


The timing of Itochu’s investment in the Drummond JV could not have been worse.  The Company’s investment came 


at the peak price for thermal coal in the last five years. As can be seen in the graph below, almost immediately 


following Itochu’s investment, the price of thermal coal began to drastically decline from a 2011 peak of USD 132 to 


lows of USD 47.   





 
Source: Bloomberg 





Since the date of Itochu’s investment, the price of thermal coal declined 57% peak to trough.  On this fact alone, Itochu 


should likely have taken an impairment loss on its investment in the Colombian mines in FYs 2013, 2014 and 2015.  


At the very least, any attempt to reclassify the accounting treatment of the investment should have merited an 


impairment or revaluation loss given the drastic decline in commodity prices.   








In addition to the collapse of the price of thermal coal, the Colombian mine experienced operating setbacks which 


caused actual production to fall well below levels forecasted by Itochu at the time of the acquisition.10

The table below compares Itochu’s forecast with the actual production achieved by the Colombian mine since the 


investment.  Note that Itochu’s forecast is based on the Company’s fiscal year end, so FY 2013 is for the year ended 


March 2013.  For ease of comparison, we have matched coal production for the year ended December 2012 to Itochu’s 


fiscal year 2013.11 12 13

By any economic measure, Itochu’s investment was a failure.  The price of thermal coal declined 57% since the 


acquisition, and production was 26% lower than forecast.  Indeed, the erosion of value of the mines was so obvious 


that even market watchers such as Bloomberg declared that the Drummond JV’s Colombian mining assets were worth 


only USD 3 billion in 2013, 60% lower than their value at the time of Itochu’s investment.14 Accounting rules 


dictate that Itochu should have recognized the deterioration of the coal industry by taking a write-down or impairment 


on the carrying value of its investment. 





2) Reclassification as Manipulation to Avoid Recognizing Losses 
 


From FY 2012 through 2014, Itochu classified its stake in the Drummond JV as an investment in an associate, allowing 


Itochu to book 20% of the Drummond JV’s net profits to its own profits and earnings.   





But when it appeared that the value of the acquisition had fallen so dramatically that a write down or impairment 


would be required, in FY 2015, Itochu reclassified its stake as an “other investment” which is FVTOCI (Fair 


Value to Other Comprehensive Income).  Furthermore, Itochu did not record a loss or impairment upon 


reclassification in its consolidated accounts.

The impact of this reclassification was material to Itochu’s financial outlook, because if the mine was classified as an 


“other investment,” no loss or impairment from the failed acquisition would negatively affect Itochu’s net income, its 


reported earnings or its forecast.  How did Itochu manage to justify, to its auditors and its shareholders, such a 


sweeping accounting change?  





First, on its Q3 FY 2015 conference call, Itochu claimed that it reclassified the investment in the Drummond JV 


because its ownership stake “might fall below 20%.” 





 “Under the contract, while we did not accept cash call, preferred stocks were issued to our partner. 


In case of the resulting dilution if they convert to common stocks, our share might fall below 20%, 


therefore our investment was deemed to be FVTOCI financial assets instead of associates and joint 


ventures.” 





Source: Itochu Q3 FY2015 Conference Call 





According to Reuters, Itochu’s CFO stated publicly that the Company would reduce its interest in the Drummond 


JV.15  It is critical to note that although the sell-side analysts mistakenly believed that Itochu reclassified its stake 


because its equity interest in the Drummond JV fell below 20%, this dilution never happened.16   





Three months later, in its FY 2015 Annual Report, Itochu completely changed its justification for reclassifying its 


investment: it claimed, implausibly, that it was permitted to reclassify its 20% stake in the Drummond JV 


because Itochu no longer could exercise “significant influence over the operations and financial policies” of the 


Drummond JV. 








Source: Itochu 2015 Annual Report, p. 60. 





We believe that Itochu was so desperate to avoid a large impairment that it concocted two different, equally 


implausible reasons to reclassify its interest in the Drummond JV.  The Company suggested on its Q3 FY 2015

conference call that reclassification was justified because its interest “might” fall below 20%, but when this was 


insufficient, Itochu claimed that it did not have “approval authority” over capital expenditures and budgets of its 


investment.  But as we will see, such approval authority is irrelevant when considering whether Itochu can 


deconsolidate its investment in the Drummond JV.   





More alarming for shareholders are Itochu’s statements which implied that the reclassification was motivated to avoid 


recognizing the declining value of its Drummond Investment, as if the principles of accounting can be broken or bent 


to a Company’s will in order to avoid disclosing negative results.  On its Q3 FY 2015 conference call, management 


stated:   





 “In consideration of the coal price declines and the strike history, we began to study how to control our 
exposure to Drummond, and in October 2014 we concluded a change to the joint venture agreement.” 





Curiously, Itochu mentioned the history of strikes.  However, the last strike at the Drummond mines took place in July 


2013.17  No impairment affecting the consolidated accounts was taken at that time, even though Itochu claims to have 


conducted a revaluation of the asset.  If the last strike took place in 2013, and no impairment was taken at that time, 


then why was Itochu only raising this issue now? Shouldn’t Itochu have taken an impairment back in July 2013 when 


such strikes were occurring? And not just in October 2014?  Itochu’s management continued:  





 “Although we revalued the investment at the end of September based on production forecasts, we did not 
recognize profit or loss from revaluation. Hereafter, we will measure fair value every quarter and profit 


recognition will be in dividends only. It will be difficult to recover the investment by means of dividends 


only, but we have the option of achieving recovery by exiting from the investment. However, in that event, 


profit or less related to the exit will not be recognized, as the investment is an FVTOCI financial asset. 


Although we do not expect dividends at the current price level, we anticipate receiving dividends in the 


range of USD 50 million to 100 million in 4 to 5 years, based on the assumption that prices rise and costs 


improve.” 





On a reclassification of an investment from an equity method associate to an “other investment,” a revaluation is 


performed and a gain or loss is taken. As discussed later, Itochu was happy to take a gain on the reclassification of 


Ting Hsin when they needed to boost their reported earnings.  





We find it shocking that no impairment was taken upon reclassification of the Drummond JV, considering that in the 


same statement, Itochu’s management admitted that it would be difficult to recover the investment from dividends 


alone and that forecasted dividends, expected in 4 to 5 years, were based on opaque assumptions of an increase in the 


price of thermal coal and a decrease in the operating costs of the mines!  





We believe that Itochu’s statements clearly indicate that the Company knew that the Drummond JV was significantly 


underperforming and that it feared taking an impairment or loss.  In our opinion, Itochu’s reclassification was 


inappropriate under the governing accounting rules and motivated solely to avoid recognizing losses on the 


failed investment in the Drummond JV and shield the effects of such losses and impairments from Itochu’s reported 


profits and earnings.   





3) The Significant Influence Test 
 


Under IFRS accounting standards, the decision whether a minority investment is considered an “investment in an 


associate,” and thus consolidated into earnings, is governed by IAS 28 and the “significant influence” test.  According 


to the rule: 





“Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operational policy decisions 


of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies”18

ITOCHU Corporation │ Tokyo: 8001                                www.glaucusresearch.com 





The “significant influence” test is critical because if satisfied, it allows an investor to apply the equity method of 


accounting, permitting the investor to recognize its share of the associate’s profits in its own net income, boosting 


profitability, reported earnings and its stock price.   





To determine whether an investor has “significant influence,” IFRS accounting standards instruct practitioners to 


conduct a two-part analysis.   Step 1 is to determine the amount of equity owned by the investor, which creates a 


presumption of significant influence.  Step 2 is to examine whether any one of five factors provides clear evidence 


to rebut this presumption.   





 
Source: IAS 





The rule is clear: a holding of 20% or more of the voting equity of an entity creates a presumption of significant 


influence and generally requires that the investment be treated as an investment in an associate.   





Itochu owns a 20% stake in the Drummond JV, therefore the presumption is that its stake in the Drummond JV 


should be accounted for as an investment in an associate.  This presumption is even stronger in this case because from 


FY 2012 through FY 2014, Itochu followed the rule and classified the Drummond JV as an investment in an 


associate.  





The strength of the presumption in favor of consolidation should not be underestimated.  According to IAS 28 


Itochu can only reclassify its investments if it “clearly demonstrates” that it does not have significant influence, 


measured by any one of the five factors listed in IAS 28.   





We will analyze all five of the IAS 28 factors for determining “significant influence” and show that rather than rebut 


the presumption, all five factors strongly indicate that Itochu had, and continues to have, sufficient significant 


influence over the Drummond JV such that, under any reasonable interpretation of the governing accounting rules, 


Itochu should account for the Drummond JV under the equity method, as it did from FY 2012 through FY 2014.   





 Factor #1: Representation on the Board or Equivalent Governing Body 
 


The first factor in examining whether a minority owner has “significant influence” is whether that minority owner has 


representation on the board of the subject entity.

Since signing the deal to acquire 20% of the Drummond JV, Itochu has stationed a number of full time employees in 


Birmingham, Alabama, to “supervise” the Colombian mining business.19  These employees are currently led by Kotaro 


Suzuki, the President and CEO of Itochu Coal America and Itochu’s highest ranking executive in America. 





 
Source: Itochu Filing, September 10, 2015 





In performing due diligence on Itochu’s relationship with the Drummond JV, an investigator called Kotaro Suzuki to 


ask him his title.  Mr. Suzuki described himself as Chairman of the Board at the Drummond JV and current CEO 


of Itochu Coal Americas.  





The fact that Itochu’s senior executive overseeing its investment describes himself as the Chairman of the Board of 


the Drummond JV should be conclusive evidence of “significant influence.”  But there is more.  When Itochu 


originally agreed to purchase its 20% stake, it appointed Kazuo Inagaki to the position of CEO of Itochu Coal 


Americas.

Source: Public Record Search 





The public record database indicates that the President of Itochu Coal Americas served as the President of the 


Drummond JV.  The investigator’s phone call with Kotaro Suzuki, the current President of Itochu Coal Americas, 


suggests that this role has not changed.  In other words, there is every indication that Itochu has continuing 


representation on the board of the Drummond JV in a leadership capacity. 





This is only the first factor, but it is sufficient evidence to support the presumption that Itochu should account for its 


20% investment in the Drummond JV under the equity method, as it did from FY 2012 through FY 2014.   





 Factor #2: Participation in the Policy Making Process 
 


The second factor in the IAS 28 test also undermines Itochu’s claim that it somehow lost its significant influence over 


the Drummond JV in FY 2015.   





Mr. Suzuki, the President and CEO of Itochu Coal Americas, claimed that he was Chairman of the Board of the 


Drummond JV, which strongly suggests that he is participating in the policy making process of the Drummond JV.   


In addition, Kazuo Inagaki, one of Mr. Suzuki’s predecessors, was listed as president of the JV and thus was also 


clearly a participant in the policy making process.  





There is more.  According to an Itochu presentation from February 2012, the purpose of sending Itochu’s executives 


to Alabama was to act as a “supervisor” to the Drummond JV and to leverage Itochu’s logistical know-how to assist 


in the operation of the coal mining operation:

Itochu clearly participates in the policy making process by supervising the operating business and lending their 


expertise to the operation of the mining enterprise.  As such, an analysis of Factor #2 of IAS 28 shows that Itochu has

ITOCHU Corporation │ Tokyo: 8001                                www.glaucusresearch.com 





sufficient involvement in the policy making process of the Drummond JV to maintain the presumption of “significant 


influence.”  





 Factor #3: Material Transactions Between the Investor and Investees 
 


As part of its investment, Itochu obtained the exclusive rights to market coal mined by the Drummond JV in Japan 


and to cooperate with the Drummond parent company in the marketing and sale of the coal to utilities and other 


customers throughout Asia.21  This is clearly a material transaction between Itochu and the Drummond JV.   





 Factor #4: Interchange of Managerial personnel 
 


Itochu’s relationship with Drummond also satisfies this factor, as Itochu sent Mr. Suzuki, Mr. Inagaki, and other 


colleagues to work out of the same building as Drummond Corp in Alabama. 2223 








If Itochu’s employees and executives were to have no involvement in operations or any significant influence on the 


Colombian business, then there would be no reason for Itochu to station employees and executives in the same building 


or for there to be any Itochu representation in Alabama at all. 





 Factor #5: Provision of technical information 
 


There is little discussion in the public forum of whether Itochu is providing the Drummond JV with technical 


information.  But Itochu stated in its presentation that one of its functions in the joint venture was to leverage “Itochu’s 


short and long term logistic know how.”24  Presumably Itochu is referring to technical expertise in the logistical 


operation of the mine. 





 Five For Five 
 


Based on IAS 28, Itochu’s investment in the Drummond JV easily meets all the requirements to be considered an 


investment in an associate under prevailing accounting rules.  Itochu’s investment meets the 20% threshold, creating 


the strong presumption in favor of consolidation.  Furthermore, Itochu accounted for the investment as an associate 


from FY 2012-2014s, strengthening the presumption in favor of consolidation.  





Sell side analysts seem to have assumed that Itochu reclassified its investment because, per the Company’s public 


statements, Itochu’s stake in the Drummond JV had fallen below 20% as a result of the issuance of preferred shares:

But this issuance never happened, and Itochu’s stake in the Drummond JV did not fall below 20%.  Not only should 


there have continued to be a strong presumption in favor of consolidation based on Itochu’s 20% equity investment, 


but also Itochu’s relationship with the Drummond JV indicates the presence of all five factors that would typically 


accompany “significant influence,” led by the leadership role of Itochu’s senior executive on the board of the JV. 








We believe that Itochu has clearly retained significant influence over the Drummond JV and should not have 


reclassified its investment.  Accordingly, Itochu should have recognized a loss or impairment due to the significant 


erosion in the value of the Colombian mining operations and this loss should have been reflected in Itochu’s net 


income and earnings.

4) Restatement of FY 2015 Accounts and at least ¥153 billion Reduction in FY 2015 net profit 
 


By any economic measure, Itochu’s investment was a failure and accounting rules dictate that Itochu should have 


taken a write-down or impairment to the carrying value of the Drummond JV.  Although the original cost of Itochu’s 


stake was approximately ¥127 billion, Itochu’s disclosure of assets in Colombia indicate that as of the Company’s 


FYE 2015 balance sheet, the carrying value of Itochu’s stake in the Drummond JV was ¥198 billion. 25

Sell side analyst reports confirm this carrying value at FYE 2015.26 





 
Source: Goldman Sachs Investment Research, October 28, 2015, p. 3.  





How much of this investment should Itochu have written off?  In FY 2016, after Itochu reclassified its stake, it impaired 


the value of the Drummond JV by ~46.5 billion in its non-consolidated accounts.27  In our view, this was wholly 


inadequate because such impairments should have been taken in the consolidated accounts and should have negatively 


affected earnings.  Further, we believe that this revaluation does not fully recognize the extent of the decline in the 


value of Itochu’s investment.

First, Bloomberg independently valued the Drummond mining operations in July 2013 at USD 3 billion, a decline of 


over 60% in value from the time of Itochu’s initial investment! 





 
Source: Bloomberg Article, July 2013. 





If we factor in the prevailing exchange rate, Bloomberg valued Itochu’s 20% interest in the Drummond’s Colombian 


coal mining operations at only ¥60 billion in July 2013!   








Based on Bloomberg’s valuation, Itochu should have recognized an impairment of ¥138 billion to its consolidated 


accounts.  But even this likely underestimates the amount of the required impairment because Bloomberg’s valuation 


does not reflect the decline in coal prices from USD 77/MT to USD 56/MT from 2013 to 2015.28 





To value Itochu’s investment we use an EV/Sales multiple derived from other similarly situated coal companies.  We 


believe that the following coal companies are good comparables for Colombian coal mining operations because they 


are for the most part pure play coal companies of similar size.

Using the disclosed production of the Drummond mine and the prevailing coal prices, we can simply apply the 


EV/Sales multiples from other pure play coal competitors to arrive at a relative valuation for the Drummond Mine.  





The following table presents our EV/Sales valuation model using the multiples calculated in the chart above.  Note 


that this model closely predicts Itochu’s purchase price (¥124 billion before an acquisition premium vs. ¥127 billion 


purchase price) and matches Bloomberg’s independent valuation.

Based on our valuation, Itochu’s 20% interest in the Drummond JV was worth only ¥45 billion in FY 2015 and only 


¥17 billion in FY 2016.  By our calculation, Itochu should have impaired its investment by ¥153 billion in FY 


2015, which would have reduced Itochu’s net profit by 51%. 





  
 Source: 1. Itochu FY 2015 Country Risk Exposure  


 2. Itochu FY 2016 Country Risk Exposure 


 3. Glaucus Valuation 





If Itochu had delayed the impairment until FY 2016, we calculate that the Drummond mine was worth even less, and 


the impairment should have come closer to ¥181 billion.  Our valuation model reflects the difficult conditions faced 


by coal companies in 2015 and 2016, when falling commodity prices and lagging demand forced dozens into 


bankruptcy.30  





Itochu does not disclose many details on its investment, so any valuation will have to rely on certain assumptions 


about the efficiency and profitability of the Drummond coal mine.  We also valued the Drummond mine using other 


methodologies, including an EV/EBITDA model, and reached a similar valuation for Itochu’s stake in the mine.   





Even a common sense approach to valuation would suggest a major impairment, considering Itochu bought a stake in 


a large coal mine and coal prices subsequently declined 57%, sending many pure play coal companies into bankruptcy.   





Accordingly, we believe that once Japanese regulators look into the Drummond issue, they should then force Itochu 


to restate at least their FY 2015 financial statements and to substantially reduce its reported net profits and earnings.

CONSOLIDATION OF CITIC INFLATES PROJECTED PROFITS BY 20% 


We believe that Itochu manipulated its accounting of the Drummond JV by reclassifying its 20% stake as an “other 


investment” rather than an “investment in an associate” to avoid recognizing a substantial loss in its consolidated 


accounts.   


Yet with Itochu’s stake in CITIC – the Company has done exactly the opposite.  In our opinion, Itochu has classified 


a small minority stake in a Chinese state-owned enterprise as an “investment in an associate” in order to consolidate 


CITIC’s earnings in Itochu’s profits and earnings.  In our opinion, Itochu’s stake in CITIC should not be consolidated 


using the equity accounting method because Itochu cannot claim to have “significant influence” over a company 


majority-owned and operated by the Chinese government.   


One of the main goals of Itochu’s Brand New Deal 2017 is to “[b]uild a solid earnings base to generate ¥400 billion 


in net profit by progressing growth strategy especially focused on the non-resource sector.”31  In order to achieve 


this goal, on January 20, 2015, Itochu entered an agreement to invest ¥600 billion to buy a 10% stake of CITIC Ltd 


(HK: 267), a Chinese state-owned enterprise listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (“CITIC”).32  


The transaction was deliberately structured so as that Itochu could claim its stake in CITIC as an “investment in an 


associate.” Itochu created a 50:50 JV, Chia Tai Bright Investment Company Limited (“CT Holdings”), with the 


Charoen Pokphand Group (“CP”), to hold Itochu and CP’s respective stakes. The JV, CT Holdings, holds a 20% stake 


in CITIC.  As a 50% owner of CT Holdings, Itochu classified CITIC as an equity method associate and consolidate 


its portion of CITIC’s earnings, beginning in the third quarter of FY 2016.   





Source: Itochu Presentation 


For FY 2017, Itochu is forecasting that 20% (¥70 billon) of its ¥350 billion in projected net income will come from 


CITIC.3334  


In our opinion, potential synergies with CITIC appear to be minimal and we estimate that Itochu’s cash return on its 


investment will be below 1.6%.   We strongly believe that Itochu is heavily investing cash into clever structures which 


only provide non-cash earnings.  To quote the Nikkei:

“Citic first offered a 6% stake to the Itochu-CP team. But Okafuji's ambitions were larger: He 


wanted a 20% stake. That would allow Itochu to include Citic's earnings in its own financial results, 


in line with equity method accounting, a step he believed Itochu needed to become Japan's top 


trading house.”35 


Itochu has aggressively structured the transaction to meet the minimum technical requirements necessary in order to 


consolidate net income from its stake in CITIC.  Yet, in our opinion, a rigorous analysis of the prevailing accounting 


rules shows that such consolidation is all form over substance, and that in reality, Itochu lacks the significant influence 


over CITIC necessary to justify consolidation.   


1) Does Itochu Really Have Significant Influence over the Chinese Communist Party? 





As discussed in detail above, under IFRS accounting standards, the decision whether to consolidate an investment as 


an interest in an associate is governed by IAS 28 and the “significant influence” test.   


“Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operational policy decisions 


of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.”36 


The “significant influence” test is critical because if satisfied, it allows an investor to apply the equity method of 


accounting, permitting the investor to recognize its share of the associate’s profits in its own net income, boosting 


profitability, reported earnings and its stock price.   


We ask a simple question: does anyone believe that Itochu has “significant influence” over a company owned, 


controlled and directed by the Chinese communist party? We think the answer is, obviously, no.  


a) CITIC’s Core Values and Mission is to Promote China’s National Interest 





CITIC is 58.13% owned by CITIC Group Corp. (“CITIC Parent”) – a company wholly-owned by the Chinese 


government.37  In other words, CITIC’s majority shareholder is the Chinese state.  According to its website, CITIC 


Parent’s core values and mission are to “put the national interest above all else,” and “to strive to complete 


missions conferred by the State.” 


CITIC Group’s “Core Values”: 


中信集团成立以来，积极致力于为国家改革开放和现代化建设事业作贡献，始终把国家利益放在


第一位，努力完成国家所赋予的使命，尽好国有企业的社会责任，为国家分忧，为人民谋利，为


社会造福。 


Since its establishment, CITIC Group has been committed to make contributions to the country’s reform, 


opening up and modernization. CITIC Group always put the national interests first; strive to complete 


the missions conferred by the State; fulfill the social responsibilities of a State-owned enterprise: share 


the concerns of the State, bring benefits to the citizens and bring happiness to the society. 


CITIC Group’s “Development Mission”: 


中信集团发展使命 


作为企业赖以生存的土壤，国家为中信集团的发展提供了广阔的舞台，国家利益代表了中信集团


的核心利益。中信集团具有国家利益高于一切的优良传统，坚定不移地履行国家所赋予的政治责

How can Itochu claim to have significant influence over CITIC when it is owned and operated by a parent 


company that puts the Chinese national interest above all else?  





b) CITIC Executive Salaries Determined by PRC Government 





Furthermore, the salaries of CITIC’s executive directors are determined by PRC government regulators.

In addition, CITIC’s executive director and vice president, Li Qingping, also concurrently serves as an executive 


director for CITIC Parent and as a leading member of the Chinese Communist Party.38   Even one of the two directors 


nominated by Itochu’s JV, Yang Xiaoping, serves as a member of the Twelfth National Committee of Chinese People’s 


Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory board of importance in China.39  CITIC even shares the same 


office space with CITIC Parent.40   


Indeed, accounting guidelines indicate that an entity like Itochu is typically deemed to lose its “significant influence” 


over an investee when an associate becomes subject to the “control of a government.” 


http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/docs/consolidated/ias28_en.pdf 


We think that governmental influence is even more pronounced in this case, because Itochu is a Japanese company 


and Sino-Japanese relations have been fraught with populist anger, bitterness and protest.  Indeed, it was not too long 


ago that Japanese companies shut down across China41 over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute.42  A 2014 BBC 


Survey revealed that anti-Japanese sentiment has never been higher in China, with fully 90% of the PRC population 


reporting negative views.43 


Given that CITIC is majority owned and controlled by the Chinese government, operated with the express core value 


of “putting national interests above all else,” we find it laughable to even consider that Itochu can have any influence, 


let alone significant influence, over the Chinese government and a company formed for the express purpose of 


furthering Chinese state interests.    


2) Form Over Substance: Itochu’s 10% Stake 





Itochu is all form over substance.  Itochu claims to have a 20% stake in CITIC because it owns 50% of the JV (CT 


Holdings), which in turn owns a 20% stake in CITIC.  Yet the economic and practical reality is that Itochu only 


effectively owns a 10% stake in CITIC, because it owns only half of the JV.  





Additionally, it is important to note that China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd, listed in Shanghai (601998 CH), generated over 


78% of CITIC’s 2015 earnings.  CITIC only owns 64.3% of the bank.  As such, the Itochu JV is another step away 


from having any significant influence over the main profit generator.  The JV has only an effective ownership of 13% 


of the bank and Itochu’s share would be 6.4%.   


Ultimately, we believe that the spirit of IAS 28 dictates that Itochu’s effective interest in CITIC is only 10%.

3) IAS 28: Five Factor Test Indicates No Significant Influence 





We believe, based on our analysis of IAS 28 and the five factors, that Itochu has nowhere close to the level of 


“significant influence” required to treat its CITIC stake as an investment in an associate and consolidate its share of 


CITIC’s earnings.44 


 Itochu Cannot Claim to Participate in Policy-Making Process 





At an August 2015 presentation, CITIC’s management team discussed its relationship with Itochu and admitted that 


the two companies only meet once every 6 months to “talk about cooperation:” 


“Regarding your first question, regarding the strategic investors, as of now, CP and Itochu, they are both 


conglomerates like CITIC. CP are more agricultural focused and we have already started our cooperation 


with CP in terms of agriculture. Itochu is a trading and also mining company, so we have talked about 


many cooperation projects with Itochu. Well, the top leaders of Itochu, as well as the CP's top leadership, 


are meeting the CITIC leadership every six months to talk about cooperation.”45 


If Itochu had a legitimate say in CITIC’s policy making process, Itochu’s representatives would meet with CITIC’s 


management more than twice per year.  CITIC’s management team does not even go so far as to state that it discusses 


its “policy-making” process with Itochu.  Instead, the companies “talk about cooperation” – suggesting that Itochu 


has no influence whatsoever on CITIC’s strategy, operations or financial policies.    


Although Itochu does have an opportunity to voice an opinion regarding dividends, according to CITIC’s management 


team, Itochu has the same level of influence as a director from Youngor, which only has a 5% stake in CITIC, does 


not treat its CITIC investments as an associate, and makes no claim to influence CITIC’s decisions or participate in 


the policy making process.  


“Regarding your question regarding payout dividends, we want to maintain at least 30% of payout 


ratio. We want to stabilize around 30%. As you know, on the Board, the Directors of the Board come from 


different shareholders. They represent different shareholders. In addition to myself, Mr. Wang and another 


gentleman on the management, we have shareholders from MOF, social security, Itochu, Youngor. They 


are all directors and they also have very high demand on dividend payout. So surely we'll try very best to 


maintain a payout ratio at a reasonably high level.”46 


Common sense supports this interpretation of Itochu’s minimal influence.  We believe it is highly unlikely that the 


Chinese government would allow Itochu, a Japanese conglomerate with only a 10% effective interest, to have any say 


over the policy making process of a company which is majority owned by the Chinese government and expressly 


operated to promote Chinese national interests first above all else.   


Compare this to Itochu’s investment in the Drummond JV, where an Itochu executive and employees live full-time in 


Alabama for the express purpose of supervising the operation of the Colombian mines.  Itochu claims no influence 


over the policy making of the Drummond JV, yet somehow claims that one meeting every 6 months is sufficient 


evidence of “significant influence” over an arm of the Chinese government.   








                                                           
44 CT Holdings, the JV through which Itochu holds its 10% stake in CITIC, is just an investment holding company with no 


operations and as purely a holding company, cannot confer “significant influence” over CITIC.

 No Material Transactions Between the Investor and the Investee 
 


We have found no indication that there are any material transactions between CITIC and Itochu at this time.  Itochu 


announced a signed memorandum of understand towards collaboration in oil and gas exploration and production with 


CITIC Resources Holdings Limited (HK: 1205) (“CITIC Resources”).  But investors should note that this is only an 


agreement to cooperate in the future on a joint investment with CITIC Resources, and does not constitute a material 


transaction between CITIC and Itochu.47 


Compare this to the Drummond JV, where a key component of the deal was Itochu’s exclusive right to sell coal from 


the Colombian mines in Japan.  With CITIC, Itochu has no such rights and to our knowledge, engages in no material 


transactions. 


 No Interchange of Managerial Personnel 





We have found no evidence of any interchange between managerial personnel of CITIC and Itochu.  Again, compare 


this to the relationship between Itochu and the Drummond JV, where Itochu sends executives and employees to 


Alabama to work in the same building as Drummond in order to operate the Colombian mines. 


 No Provision of Essential Technical Information 





There does not appear to be any provision of essential technical information between CITIC and Itochu at this time. 





 Board Representation 





Itochu may claim that it has representation on CITIC’s board because its JV, CT Holdings, has the right to appoint an 


independent non-executive director and a non-executive director. 48 Yet this is not the reward it appears to be, as 


neither of the directors nominated by CT Holdings and who were appointed to the board on August 3, 2015, appear 


to have any connection to either the JV or Itochu. 


Mr. Yang Xiaoping (“Mr. Yang”) was appointed by CT Holdings as a CITIC non-executive director.49 As per his 


biography set out below, Mr. Yang has no business connection with CT Holdings or Itochu but appears to be deeply 


entrenched within the Chinese communist party.50

Mr. Yang is a member of the Twelfth National Committee of Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a 


political advisory board of importance in the PRC.  We believe that Mr. Yang’s loyalties lie, exclusively, to the 


Chinese government and the communist party, and that Itochu cannot claim to have any influence over a board member 


with such deep political ties.  After all, where do Mr. Yang’s loyalties lie? To Itochu? Or to the political party and 


government which guarantees his freedom, livelihood and career? 


Nor does it appear that the JV’s other nominee has any connection whatsoever to Itochu.  Mr. Noriharu Fujita (“Mr 


Fujita”) was appointed by CT Holdings as an independent non-executive director of CITIC.52  According to his 


biography,  


“Mr. Fujita has established Fujita Noriharu Accounting Firm since July 2013. From April 1973 to May 


1978, he performed audit engagements in Japanese accounting firms. From July 1980 to December 1988, 


he worked in Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and stationed in London and Tokyo office. From January 


1989 to June 2007, Mr. Fujita was a partner of Ernst & Young, LLP Chicago and New York office. From 


July 2007 to June 2013, he was an executive partner of Ernst & Young ShinNihon, LLC and served as the 


JBS Global Services Leader. He retired in June 2013. He is a licensed Certified Public Accountant in both 


Japan and the United States. As an accounting professional, Mr. Fujita has extensive experience in 


accounting.”53 


As an independent director of CITIC, Mr. Fujita has no connection with either Itochu or CP and thus cannot be a 


conduit for “significant influence.”   


It is also worth considering whether these directors would have any significant influence on other directors such as Li 


Qingping.  She’s a CITIC vice president and executive director, but also serves as an executive director at CITIC 


Parent and is a leading member of the Communist Party.54  In fact, it appears that Ms. Li was the Communist Party’s 


representative at CITIC from 2003 through 2014.55  Is it reasonable to assume that a sole director with minimal ties to 


Itochu is able to have “significant influence” over a company led by a senior Communist Party official which is 


organized and operated with the express and primary goal of promoting the interests of the Chinese government? We 


think not.  


Ultimately, neither director nominated by CT Holdings, appears to have any connection to either the JV or Itochu.   


We find it peculiar that Itochu were not given their own director, whereas Youngor, which owns just 5% of CITIC, 


has the right to nominate its own director to CITIC’s board.   


4) Itochu is consistently inconsistent 





In order to understand the true nature of Itochu’s manipulation of equity method accounting, we believe that investors, 


regulators and accountants should compare how Itochu applies the “significant influence” test to its investments in 


CITIC and the Drummond JV.

In what we believe is Itochu’s myopic desire to boost net income and smooth earnings at any cost, they have 


inconsistently and incorrectly applied the definition of “significant influence” to provide the optimal outcome.  In FY 


2015, Itochu reclassified the Drummond JV from an associate to an “other investment” in order to avoid an impairment 


which would significantly affect Itochu’s reported net profits and earnings.  However, based on the criteria of IAS 28, 


Drummond should be considered an associate.  


Conversely, Itochu classified CITIC as an associate even though, if Itochu applied the “significant influence” test by 


the same criteria it used to reclassify its stake in the Drummond JV, it obviously lacks any significant influence 


necessary for consolidation. 


In our opinion, Itochu is simply taking advantage of IAS 28 and the prevailing accounting rules in order to 


inappropriately avoid losses from investments in entities over which it has significant influence (the Drummond JV) 


and inappropriately consolidate profits from entities over which it has none (CITIC).  We believe that any objective 


examination of Itochu’s influence over its investments would yield the opposite outcome: a deconsolidation of 


CITIC’s profits and a consolidation of the Drummond JV’s write downs, losses and impairments.   


5) CITIC’s Stock Declined.  Itochu Recognized a Gain 





Itochu recorded its investment in CITIC at historical cost and not at fair value. At the time of acquisition, Itochu paid 


HKD 13.80 per share.56  CITIC’s stock price at FYE 2016 was HKD 11.80 per share, a fall of 14% since Itochu’s 


initial investment.  Had Itochu been required to adjust this investment to fair value, it would have had to write down 


equity by an additional ¥87 billion. 


Yet instead of recording a loss or write down, which would fairly reflect the reality that CITIC’s share price has fallen 


below the price at which Itochu invested, Itochu recorded its stake in CITIC at cost (¥600 billion).57  The additional 


advantage of recording the investment as an equity method associate is that Itochu was able to book a ¥40.4 billion 


gain in FY 2016.  This paper, non-cash gain boosted Itochu’s earnings and would likely not have been available had 


Itochu accounted for CITIC as an FVTOCI investment.   


Paradoxically, Itochu is already suggesting that they are saving ¥150 billion in negative goodwill on its CITIC 


investment which could be used to smooth out earnings at a later stage.58

We believe that such accounting games are unethical and deliberately conceal the economic reality that Itochu’s stake 


in CITIC is worth less than at the time of its investment.  


6) CITIC: No Synergies and a Questionable Investment 





Finally, a recent analyst report stated that the one of the primary factors likely to drive Itochu’s share price higher will 


be the emergence of clear synergies with CITIC.59  Unfortunately for investors, any potential synergies between Itochu 


and CITIC seem highly unlikely.  


Itochu has been advertising CITIC to investors as a large conglomerate with “many industrial sectors of business, 


many of which are leading companies in the industry” in order to promote the potential synergies.60  The reality, 


however, is that the vast majority of CITIC’s businesses are in areas in which there will be no synergies with Itochu.

Itochu’s only announcement of substance, regarding a plan to cooperate on resource exploration with CITIC Resources 


(a separate public company 59.5% owned by CITIC), was only a vague pronouncement to cooperate in the future.  


Moreover, CITIC’s resources and energy sector lost USD 2.4 billion in FY 2015, and reported a negative 38% net 


income margin, so we do not believe that Itochu’s shareholders should be excited about the prospect of synergies 


with a failing business segment.  This announcement also contravenes Itochu’s claim to be expanding into the non-


resource sector.

Unusually, Itochu’s management also admitted that they are not pushing quickly ahead with any projects with CITIC 


in China because of President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive.61 China is CITIC’s stronghold, so if Itochu are not 


building synergies in China with CITIC they are not going to be building them anywhere.  





Source: Q&A Summary of Investors Meeting for the 1st Half of FY2016 Business Results 


Indeed, analysts begrudgingly admit that any proposed synergies or cooperation with CITIC have run aground.  


Nomura’s May 2016 analyst report admitted: “Collaboration with CITIC has shown some delays, but we look for 


progress here.” 


The absence of synergies is perhaps why the CITIC acquisition also raises serious questions about Itochu’s decision 


making.  Itochu’s return on investment, which flows through its net income, will likely hit 11%, yet its cash return on 


its investment will likely only be 1.6%.  





Our calculations show that Itochu spends cash in order to realize paper profits.  Even though the return on its stake in 


CITIC appears healthy on paper, the cash return on is investment will almost certainly be poor. 


Itochu could have created a JV or partnership with CITIC for a position significantly smaller than the one it took, 


nevertheless, it risked small cash return in order to achieve a big paper profit to help Itochu secure its long term net 


income target of ¥400 billion. 


Ultimately, we do not believe that Itochu is likely to develop any meaningful synergies with CITIC and its expected 


cash return raises serious questions as to whether Itochu’s investment was designed to enhance shareholder value or 


simply artificially manufacture earnings.  But we firmly believe that Itochu has no reasonable claim to “significant 


influence” over CITIC and thus should not be allowed to add CITIC’s earnings to its consolidated accounts, which 


would reduce Itochu’s earnings and forecasts by 20%.

TING HSIN: RECLASSIFICATION AND UNUSUAL GAIN SAVE ITOCHU’S FY 2015 EARNINGS 


Itochu is considered a darling of the Nikkei 225 because it almost always manages to hit its guidance forecast and, so 


Itochu claims, the majority of its profits are derived from the non-resource sector.  The non-resource profits are 


particularly attractive to investors because as trading firms go, Itochu appears much more insulated from the fall of 


commodity prices than traditional powerhouses such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi.  


Our analysis of Itochu’s FY 2015 financial statements indicates that it only made its earnings forecast because of an 


unusual gain from a familiar and questionable source: the reclassification of an investment from an “investment in an 


associate” to an “other investment.”  We believe that Itochu intentionally misleads investors by claiming record non-


resource profits while, through a lack of transparency and over-reliance on the fine print, Itochu’s actual performance 


in this sector is poorer than advertised.  


1) FY 2015: The False Narrative of Record Non-Resource Profits 





Itochu claims that its net profits are driven by its non-resource trading sector, as evidence by the Company FY 2015 


earnings presentation: 


 “At first I'd like to explain the outline of the results for fiscal-year 2015. In FY 2015, the second half of 


our medium-term management plan, the Brand-new Deal 2014, net profit attributable to ITOCHU was 


JPY300.6 billion, keeping high earnings level, over JPY300 billion. Thanks to significant increase in 


profits from four non-resource segments such as Textile, Machinery, Food, and ICT, General Products 


& Realty, despite the recognition of the impairment loss relating to a Brazilian iron ore company and a 


US oil and gas development company, we were able to achieve our net income forecast of JPY300 


billion.”62 [Emphasis Added] 


This narrative appears often throughout the Company’s annual report: that impairment losses in the resource sector 


were offset by increased earnings in the non-resource sector.  For example, in the president’s letter to shareholders, 


Itochu highlighted that despite the end of the resource and commodity boom, it was unique among Japanese trading 


houses in that it was able to hit its guidance for the fifth year in a row. 





What Itochu fails to mention, until the fine print, is that 20% of Itochu’s FY 2015 net profits came from non-cash 


gains, the majority of which were taken in the four weeks before the end of the fiscal year, because of a cosmetic 


reclassification of a prior acquisition.63  Once we remove the effects of one-time gains, non-cash items and income 


from investment in listed securities (which any shareholder could replicate), it shows a bleaker picture:

Indeed, it is in the fine print on page 63 of the annual report that the truth is revealed: Itochu only made its FY 2015 


guidance because Itochu took a huge one-time, non-cash gain on a FY 2010 acquisition.  





Source: Itochu Annual Report, FY 2015, p. 63. 


2) Form Over Substance 





In FY 2015, we believe that Itochu was unexpectedly forced to recognize impairments in its U.S. shale investment, 


Samson Resources, and in the Brazilian iron ore company, NAMISA. These impairments wiped out the earnings 


expected from the equity method associates and as a result, management searched for a gain to offset the loss.  


Incredibly, management found a gain just four weeks before year-end that gave them 20% of their net income.  This 


allowed Itochu to report net income of ¥300.6 billion and fractionally beat its forecast of ¥300 billion by just 0.2%. 


The majority of this gain came from the reclassification of its equity method investment Ting Hsin into an “other 


investment.”  By now, any investor reading this report should be aware that, in our opinion, Itochu manipulates the 


classification of investments as associates to suit its short term needs.  Just like in the Drummond JV, the 


reclassification of the Ting Hsin investment from an equity method to an “other investment” produced a paper gain, 


yet there was no change to the underlying economics of the investment or in the relationship between Itochu and Ting 


Hsin. 


 2004: Itochu Enters Chinese Beverage Market 





On December 27, 2003, Itochu (20%) and Asahi (80%) entered into a JV, named A-I China Breweries Co., Ltd 


(“AIB”). AIB then acquired a 50% stake in Tingyi-Asahi-Itochu Beverages Holding Co., Ltd. (“TAI”) for USD 385 


million from Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp, a food and beverage conglomerate listed on the Hong Kong 


Stock Exchange (HK: 322).64 


 2008: Itochu Acquires 20% Stake in Ting Hsin 





On November 20, 2008, Itochu announced the acquisition of a 20% stake of Ting Hsin (Cayman Island) Holding 


Corp. (“Ting Hsin”), for USD 710 million (¥68.9 billion).  Because Itochu purchased a 20% interest, it was deemed

to have significant influence over Ting Hsin, and as such Itochu consolidated the investment as an equity method 


associate and included its portion of Ting Hsin’s profits in its net income.65 


Three days later, in a second and seemingly separate transaction, Itochu announced that it would sell its 10% effective 


stake in TAI, through AIB, to Ting Hsin for USD 280 million.66  However, it is unclear if this was a cash transaction.67  


 2010: Itochu Reclassifies Ting Hsin as an Investment in an Associate 





On September 28, 2010, Asahi Breweries LTD (“Asahi”) announced that it would acquire a 6.54% stake in Ting Hsin 


for a non-cash purchase price of USD 520 million (¥43.8 billion).  In return, Asahi sold an 8% stake of Tingyi-Asahi 


Breweries (“TAB”), formally known as TAI, to Ting Hsin for USD 520 million (¥43.8 billion).68   


Ting Hsin then issued new shares to Asahi and as a result, Itochu’s 20% stake in Ting Hsin was diluted to 18.7%. 


Concurrent with the dilution, Itochu formed a joint holding company with Asahi (74%:26%) named China Foods 


Investment Corporation (“CFI”) to hold their respective stakes in Ting Hsin. The press release stated that the purpose 


of the JV was for mutual cooperation in developing food businesses in the markets of Greater China.  Nevertheless, 


CFI remained just a holding company. It thus appears, that the only purpose of creating CFI was to enable Itochu to 


consolidate the JV and therefore treat its stake in Ting Hsin as an equity method associate, even though it only 


effectively owned 18.7%.  This was classic form over substance, but it allowed Itochu to convince its auditors to 


account for its investment in Ting Hsin under equity method, allowing Itochu to continue to consolidate its share of 


Ting Hsin’s earnings into Itochu’s net income. 


 4 Weeks Before the End of FY 2015 





On March 3, 2015, four weeks before the end of FY 2015, Itochu sold its 74% stake in CFI for a non-cash value of 


¥161.9 billion and in return, Itochu received back its 17.8% stake in Ting Hsin.   


Itochu then reclassified its stake in Ting Hsin as an “other investment” and recorded an after-tax gain of 


approximately ¥60.5 billion on the “revaluation” of its investment. Not coincidentally, this gain was just enough to 


allow Itochu to hit its year-end forecast target.69  


This appears to be another case of Itochu reclassifying its minority investments to manufacture gains in order to meet 


guidance, even though there was no fundamental change to the underlying economic reality of its investment.  


Itochu’s effective stake in Ting Hsin was 18.7% in 2010 and remained almost unchanged (17.8%)70 in 2015, when 


Itochu reclassified its investment to recognize a ¥60 billion gain.  


We have not been able to obtain enough information to question the validity or the amount of the gain taken by Itochu 


on this reclassification, although we have our suspicions.  First, it appears as though Ting Hsin’s profitability has been 


in decline since Q1 FY 2010, when Itochu first classified its investment under the equity method.  Note that although 


Itochu first acquired its stake in FY 2009, it began to consolidate its proportion of Ting Hsin’s profits in Q1 FY 2010.71

own a minority stake.

Put simply, Ting Hsin’s annual profitability appears, based on the figures disclosed by the Company, to decline 


significantly from FY 2010 (¥8.7 billion) to FY 2015 (¥3.3 billion).   


Second, the fact that the after-tax, non-cash gain appeared just four weeks before the end of the fiscal year and that it 


was just enough to cover the expected earnings shortfall makes us question the legitimacy of this paper profit. 


3) Losses Following Reclassification 





Itochu’s reclassification of Ting Hsin could not have come soon enough.  Unsurprisingly, given Itochu’s history of 


avoiding impairments, Ting Hsin’s business has deteriorated significantly post its reclassification. 


Below, are two stock charts.  The first is for Tingyi, the Hong Kong-listed food and beverage business of Ting Hsin 


(HK: 322).  The second is for Wei Chuan Foods Corps. (“Wei Chuan”), another Ting Hsin business unit (TW: 1201).  


Together, Tingyi and Wei Chuan accounts for 80-90% of Ting Hsin’s revenue.72

There is not sufficient publicly available information regarding the assets, liabilities or financial position of Ting Hsin 


to assess whether Itochu was justified in recognizing such a gain, although we acknowledge that Itochu likely based 


at least part of its recognized gain on the appreciation of Tingyi’s stock price between the acquisition date and the 


reclassification date.  Yet this does not alleviate our suspicion that such a gain was artificially manufactured to suit 


the Company’s short term needs.  After all, Tingyi’s stock had appreciated immediately after Itochu’s initial 


investment, but the gain was only recognized years later.  In addition, Itochu’s stake in Ting Hsin remained the same 


over that time period, making it highly unlikely, in our opinion, that Itochu’s level of influence over Ting Hsin changed 


significantly over that time. 


Investors should also note that the price of Tingyi’s and Wei Chuan’s stocks began to significantly underperform 


around the time that Itochu reclassified its Ting Hsin investment.   


Ultimately, we question the legitimacy of Itochu’s one-time, non-cash gain, supposedly earned on its dubious 


reclassification of its Ting Hsin investment.  We believe that regulators should look into how Itochu magically 


conjured up a ¥60 billion paper gain (after tax) just four weeks before the end of a fiscal year when it appears that 


without such a gain, Itochu would have missed guidance by ¥60 billion.

MANUFACTURING DUBIOUS NON-CASH GAINS TO MAKE EARNINGS 


Itochu has been the darling of the Tokyo stock market for its remarkable ability to always hit its forecasted numbers.  


Indeed, other than this year, since Mr. Okafuji took over Itochu in FY 2011, it has rarely missed earnings guidance.  


Since Mr. Okafuji was hired, Itochu had the lowest standard deviation of returns of any of the top five trading 


companies.   





In our experience, such an unusually low standard deviation compared to its peers suggests that there is likely to be 


some income massaging in order to achieve consistent results.  Business, like life, is unpredictable.  We are suspicious 


of any Company which is able to so reliably predict the future.   


Itochu’s track-record is exceptional considering the struggling global economy and commodity price collapse. As can 


be seen in the table below, Itochu has been pretty close to the mark on a number of occasions and on three occasions 


Itochu made its forecast by less than 1%.  FY 2012 is the only year where they beat expectations by a wide margin.   








Perhaps unsurprisingly, Itochu’s uncanny ability to hit its forecast is actually due to a distinct increase in one-time 


gains on investments and bargain purchases, excluding impairments.  For the most part these are one-time non-cash 


gains.  83% of such gains took place in FYs 2015 and 2016. 


Even though investors may approve in the short term of companies that hit their targets, intentionally massaging or 


manipulating results is against the accounting principles and in the end, can have a devastating long term impact on 


share value.  Indeed, the evidence discussed in this report supports our opinion that the pressure to meet earnings 


guidance has led Itochu down a darker path of accounting impropriety.

ITOCHU THINKS IMPAIREMENTS OPTIONAL – THEY ARE NOT 


We believe that Itochu’s attitude towards impairments demonstrates that it is likely to have inappropriately delayed 


or altogether avoided taking required write-downs on losing investments.  Indeed, Mr. Okafuji even admits an 


extremely relaxed attitude towards taking impairments, as evidenced by his statement in a November 2015 interview 


with the Nikkei Asian Review: 








Source: Nikkei Asian Review73 


Mr. Okafuji statement that Itochu are “considering” taking an impairment suggests that Itochu believe impairments 


are optional!  Indeed, Mr. Okafuji’s sentiment seems consistent with Itochu’s accounting games, particularly with 


respect to its FY 2015 reported results and the reclassification of the Drummond JV. 


The language from IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets clearly states that taking impairments are not optional nor at a 


company’s leisure as shown in the below:74 





Itochu changed their accounting standards from US GAAP to IFRS in FY 2014.  Under US GAAP, there is a two 


step-approach, the first of which is comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted future 


cash flows.  If the carrying amount is not deemed recoverable then an impairment test is performed. IFRS requires an 


impairment test whenever an impairment indicator exists, a significantly stricter standard than US GAAP.

Under IFRS, an impairment must be considered when there is an internal or external indication that an 


impairment may need to be taken. The IAS sets out the indicators a non-exhaustive list set out below:75 





Source: IFRS Rules 


The treatment of impairments under IFRS is thus stricter than under US GAAP, and typically require companies to 


take impairments sooner.  The impairment indicators under IFRS, such as market value declines and negative changes 


in the market or economy, would include the collapse of commodity prices. 


That is why many of Itochu’s peers, other large Japanese trading companies such as Mitsui and Sumitomo have taken 


large impairments on their assets following the fall of commodity prices in 2015.  Itochu took some impairment 


charges, but we believe that they should have taken more. 


Just to reconfirm - taking impairments ARE NOT OPTIONAL under IFRS or US GAAP, intentionally avoiding 


taking impairments is tantamount to fraud as the company is misleading investors regarding actual financial 


performance.

VALUATION 


Leverage and Creditor Relationships  


Itochu is highly levered with 9.29x total debt/EBITDA and 57% debt/capital ratio. Since 2011, Itochu has raised over 


¥300 billion of bonds from investors that have based their investment decision on the accuracy and integrity of Itochu’s 


representations and reported profits. Toshiba Corp was fined by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission 


because it had misled investors by padding results.76  We believe that Itochu could face a similar fate. 


It is not just investors that seem to have been duped by Itochu.  Creditors have put a significant amount of faith in 


Itochu’s growing net profit, which creditors hope will generate more free cash flow.  However, as we have detailed in 


this report, Itochu’s quality of earnings is deteriorating and we believe that the Company should be forced to stop 


recognizing profit from CITIC.  If this occurs, then Itochu would likely face a ratings downgrade.  


Creditors should also be concerned over the concentrated risk of the CITIC investment, which amounts to 24% of 


Itochu’s consolidated capital.  We suspect that Itochu has not truly understood the inherent risks of investing in China’s 


financial market.  Itochu’s management defended the CITIC investment on the grounds that “the financial industry 


in China is stable with low volatility.”77  This dangerously underestimates the risks and volatility of the Chinese 


financial markets, as the last few months have shown.   


Aggressive Investments to Ensure Steady Supply of One Time Gains 


Creditors are also expecting Itochu to curtail new investment.  However, as its core business is deteriorating, Itochu 


may be forced to continue spending to hit its targets, given that Itochu relies on one-time gains to make up a significant 


portion of its net profits.   


For example, in FY 2016, Itochu’s trading income, the true earnings driver of a trading company, was down 17.2% 


from the prior year (¥226 billion vs. ¥273 billion).  To offset this decline, Itochu benefitted from a number of one-


time gains, including a gain of ¥20 billion on the sale of PrimeSource,78 a gain of ¥9 billion on a change of the capital 


structure of the Orient Corporation, a tax benefit of ¥34 billion from the disposal of Samson Resources and a negative 


goodwill gain on CITIC (even though CITIC’s stock price was down 14% since Itochu’s investment). These gains 


have masked the lack of growth in the core business.  Yet Itochu remains vocal and bullish on its prospects: 


“Regarding net profit attributable to Itochu, the target for FY2017 is JPY350 billion, a JPY110 billion 


increase compared with FY2016, even including a JPY20 billion buffer. This target factors in solid growth 


in the non-resource sector, a full-year contribution to profits from the CITIC investment, and an absence 


of impairment losses that were recorded in FY2016.”79 


With the company running out of gains it is hard to see how they will achieve their ¥350 billion net profit goal next 


year, let alone the ultimate goal of ¥400 billion, without taking on further debt to finance aggressive acquisitions.  Yet 


Itochu’s failure to curtail investment and its growing debt could cause a ratings downgrade.  


Unfair Advantage 


Once famous Japanese trading companies have been hit hard by declining commodity prices and ill-advised foreign 


investments.  Despite having a similar business model, and being subject to the same secular headwinds and

commodity prices as other trading houses, Itochu has thus far largely avoided such major impairments.80  Indeed, for 


the first time, in FY 2016, Itochu reported the highest net income of any of the big-5 Japanese trading houses.  


The misperception that Itochu’s net profits are driven by its non-resource segment and that it has not been affected by 


the large write downs recognized by other trading houses, has driven its stock price higher than its rivals.  


81 


We believe that this is entirely inappropriate.  Other Japanese houses that have adhered to Prime Minister Abe’s 


campaign of corporate governance and recognized impairments find themselves at an unfair disadvantage to Itochu.  


The investors, shareholders and employees of the other trading houses have been punished because their companies 


have, with some exceptions, been honest with the market regarding their impairments.  We believe that Itochu has 


not. 





Toshiba Part II? 





In 2015, a regulatory investigation and independent inquiry revealed that Toshiba had deliberately manipulated its 


accounting policies in order to overstate profits by USD 1.2 billion (¥152 billion) from FY 2008 to 2014.  Toshiba’s 


stock declined 70%, Japanese securities regulators imposed a record fine, and Toshiba’s CEO and 8 of its 16 board 


members resigned in disgrace.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange even placed Toshiba’s stock “on alert,” raising the 


possibility that the Company’s stock could be delisted if it failed to correct deficiencies in its corporate governance.   





As this report has demonstrated, we believe that Itochu overstated FY 2015 net profits by at least ¥153 billion by 


reclassifying its stake in the Drummond JV without taking a loss, even though the value of the investment had declined 


significantly.  In our opinion, there is evidence of intent to manipulate.  Itochu first claimed, in Q3 FY 2015, that 


reclassification was justified because its stake “might fall” below 20%.  It never did.  Then, in Itochu’s 2015 Annual 


Report, Itochu completely changed its justification for reclassification, stating that although it still owned a 20% stake 


in the Drummond JV, it did not have “approval authority” or “significant influence.”  In retrospect, Itochu appears so 


desperate to avoid a large impairment that it concocted two different, equally implausible reasons to reclassify its

investment.  In our opinion, Itochu’s changing story shows that the Company was intent on inappropriately avoiding 


the loss, regardless of whether it was permitted by the rules of accounting. 





We also do not believe that Itochu should be able to consolidate profits from CITIC under the equity method, given 


that CITIC is operated and majority-owned by the Chinese government, meaning that it is highly unlikely that Itochu 


can have any significant influence over CITIC’s strategy, operations or policy making.  Deconsolidating CITIC 


would mean that Itochu’s forecasted net profits would fall by 20%. 





We are also highly suspicious of the ¥60 billion (after-tax) one-time gain recognized on the reclassification of Ting 


Hsin, given the declining profitability post-investment.  We simply do not find it credible that Itochu magically 


discovered a ¥60 billion gain four weeks before the end of the fiscal year when the Company was set to miss guidance 


by ¥60 billion. 





Toshiba was almost destroyed by a scandal for overstating earnings by ¥152 billion over seven years.  By comparison, 


we believe that in FY 2015 alone, Itochu overstated net profits by ¥153 billion.   


Toshiba’s stock declined 70%, peak-to-trough.  In our opinion, Itochu faces a similar crisis of confidence in its 


corporate governance and accounting practices.  We believe that like Toshiba, any form of independent inquiry, either 


by regulators or an independent investigation committee, may reveal even more problems at Itochu than we can glean 


from the publicly available information.  But based on the current information available to investors for analysis, we 


value Itochu’s shares at ¥631.00, 50% below their current traded price.
