Additional Details on NCR’s Bad Capital Allocation Emerge (NYSE: NCR)  
 
 
Last week we profiled our short thesis on NCR Corp, a company we believe has limited strategic 
alternatives as it struggles to execute a levered acquisition transformation strategy, a history of bad 
capital allocation, aggressive accounting, and a management team with a questionable legacy at Symbol 
Technologies. In our follow-up report, we will profile a blatant example of poor judgment and capital 
allocation to support our opinion that NCR’s shareholders should demand immediate change at the 
executive level. But first, let’s review NCR’s recent quarter and further dispel any notion that value 
enhancing alternatives are imminent and that NCR had a stellar quarter where it “Beat” street estimates 
 
Executive Summary: 
 


 NCR disappointed on top line revenue this quarter, but engineered a 4c Non-GAAP EPS "beat," a 
closer look reveals questionable acct'g adjustments are the culprit 


 NCR’s reported operating cash flow appears overstated. Balance sheet changes in deferred 
revenue don’t tie to the cash flow statement 


 Investors hoping for an imminent catalyst to unlock value had their hopes dashed as the 
company suggested this would be "value destructive" 


 Questionable business relationship with Empower Software analyzed and hiring of a Global VP 
of Business Development with a checkered past are revealed 


 Shareholders should demand swift executive changes to restore confidence at NCR 
 
 
Dissecting NCR’s Lackluster Q1 2015 Results: 
 
First off, contrary to a hasty and “recycled” news story by the Wall St Journal last week that NCR was 
seeking strategic alternatives, the company sent a somber message to overly optimistic investors that 
nothing imminent is brewing. As Spruce Point suggested earlier, NCR has few (if any alternatives) and 
that the mostly like path forward will be a slow decline of its business. NCR outlined its view of the 
situation with the following quote: 
 
“There would be, if you pull the business apart significant dyssynergy for example, all of my divisions 
here of a common services delivery infrastructure around the world, I don't have a separate services 
business for retail and financial and hospitality. All of them share a common supply chain infrastructure; 
plants, distribution centers, and of course we get lots of value from that scale. And they all share a 
common G&A infrastructure and it will also – it'd be very difficult if not value destructive to rather pull it 
apart.” 
 
To support our view that NCR’s business is declining, consider that it reported $1.47 billion and $0.23c 
GAAP / $0.43c Non-GAAP for Q1. Street analysts were calling for $1.49 billion and $0.39c Non-GAAP.  So 
NCR missed revenues by ~1% but on the surface beat bottom line estimates by $0.04c. We will dissect 
this $0.04c Non-GAAP earnings beat further, but first we must point out the following.  
 



http://www.wsj.com/articles/ncr-corp-exploring-strategic-options-amid-shareholder-pressure-1429741688
Consider that all of NCR GAAP financial results produced significant YoY declines:  
1. Gross margin contracted from 27.4% to 26.4% (100bps) 
2. Segment Operating Income declined from $155m to $146m ( 5.8% decline / margin contracted 


30bps from 10.2% to 9.9%) 
3. Income from operations declined from $108m to $95m (12% decline / 70bp margin contraction) 
4. GAAP Diluted EPS declined from $0.31c to $0.23 (26%) 


 
NCR can try to blame all its problems on currency movements, but digging beneath the surface shows 
there’s much more to the story. Getting back to NCR’s magical $0.04c earnings beat, let’s take a closer 
look at its bridge between GAAP / Non-GAAP results. 
 
Consider that this quarter NCR took a $16m restructuring charge, and says that $0.07c should be added 
back to get to Non-GAAP EPS. 


 
 
Now in just the prior quarter, Q4'14 NCR took a $33m restructuring charge, and it added back $0.10c to 
get to Non-GAAP EPS
So if investors and analysts are to believe that a $33m charge is equal to a $0.10c add back in Q4’14, 
why should they believe that n Q1’15 a $16m charge (approximately 50%) should be equal to a $0.07c 
add back? The diluted share count barely budged between quarters from 171.3 to 171.6m this quarter. 
The only other variable would be the effective tax rate, which Spruce Point believe should be normalized 
and applied consistently. Therefore, we estimate the real add-back should be approximately $0.05c and 
not $0.07c. In other words, NCR appears to have picked up a $0.02c benefit from a fuzzy and opaque 
calculation.  
 
NCR Still Appears to Be Overstating Operating Cash Flows 
 
On the conference call, NCR’s CFO made the following comment:  
 
“The AR facility - that was really a better way to finance then our revolver. So we’re using our AR base to 
effectively borrow and that’s treated similar to the revolver as part of the financing cash flows. So that’s 
part of financing.” 
 
However, it is quite clear that something seems fishy at first glance of NCR’s financials. Consider that in 
2014, it reported that Payments on revolving credit facilities were ($1,050)m while “Borrowings on 
revolving credit facilities” were +$1,146m. Therefore, the net inflow from revolving credit borrowings 
was $96m
Curiously, this $96m borrowing amount is stated in the notes as having been drawn on the A/R 
securitization facility of its financials, not its revolving credit facility. NCR lists its ending revolving facility 
balance at zero for both 2013 and 2014. 


 
 
 
If investors and analysts are confused by this, they certainly aren’t alone. Either NCR has clearly made an 
error in its financial reporting, or it is attempting to obfuscate results. 
 
It’s also worth taking a closer look at NCR’s 8-K filing on the establishment of the A/R facility on 
November 21, 2014. NCR makes the following disclosure:  
 
“The Company is independently liable for its own customary representations, warranties, covenants and 
indemnities as the originator and as the servicer of the receivables, and to the extent additional originators become 
party to the A/R Facility, will be obligated to guaranty the performance of the obligations of such originators. The 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70866/000007086614000083/november20148-k.htm
Company will include NCR Receivables’ assets, liabilities and results of operations in its consolidated financial 
statements” 
 
So here we have a statement that says NCR is running the results of NCR Receivables through its results 
of operations in its consolidated financial statements. Could it be any clearer now that NCR’s operating 
cash flow is indeed benefiting from the A/R facility? 
 
Cloud Sales Growth of 20% Matched With Zero Growth in Deferred Revenue…Seriously: 
 
NCR continues to tout that is “Cloud” (formerly software-as-a-service) revenue grew from $113m to 
$134m year-over-year, or 20% on a constant currency basis. When analyzing cloud companies, it’s 
important to look at deferred revenue as a key measure for the health of the business. In this case, NCR 
reported Q1’2015 “deferred revenue and customer deposit” of $588m. Curiously, in Q1’2014 NCR 
reported “deferred revenue and customer deposit” balance sheet account was listed as $587m. In other 
words, NCR’s cloud revenue growth of 20% was match with virtually zero growth in deferred revenue. 
We challenge investors to find another SaaS/Cloud company with this sort of financial profile 
 







http://investor.ncr.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83840&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1923719
Be Careful Leverage is Rising and Intangible Amortization is Most of the Non-GAAP Adjustment: 
 
NCR’s Adjusted EBITDA declined in Q1’15, and while its debt declined, so did its excess cash. The net 
result is that NCR’s leverage ratio ticked higher QoQ from 3.1x to 3.2x. We still argue this leverage is 
understated due to its unfunded pension liability, capital leases, etc.
A majority of NCR's Non-GAAP EPS "beat" came from a $0.12c add-back due to acquisition-related 
amortization of intangibles. These are real costs related to NCR's recent acquisition spree, but have been 
capitalized on the balance. We argued before that we believe they have made terrible recent 
acquisitions. What we find unusual is that NCR splits these costs among three income statement 
categories: Cost of products, services, and SG&A. 
 
 
 


 
 
Pattern of Bad Capital Allocation and Leadership: 
 
As disciplined investors, we take every precaution to understand the executive team in charge of guiding 
the strategic decisions of the company, and make sure they are diligent, and focused on creating long-
term value. We avoid investing in companies that are excessively promotional with “Celebrity CEOs.” 
There is ample evidence to suggest that companies with Celebrity CEOS are bad for companies (here). A 
research reported entitled “Understanding and managing CEO celebrity” (here) offers both pros and 
cons, and suggested a matrix with four types of CEOs based upon degree of Fame and Reputation. In our 
initial report, we provided evidence to suggest that NCR’s CEO had among the worst reputations (here). 
NCR may not be a household brand name, and it receives a low score on Ranking The Brands (here); 



http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/playing-golf-and-other-mi_b_5536379.html

http://milesazachary.com/MGT%204380%20Sp%202012/Ketchen,%20Adams,%20&%20Shook%202008%20BH.pdf

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nine-ceos-worst-reputations-191237027.html

http://www.rankingthebrands.com/Brand-detail.aspx?brandID=2348
therefore, we believe its CEOs fame score is low. According to the matrix, and in our opinion, NCR’s CEO 
is best classified among the “Silent Killers.” 
 





 
 
 
One way in which we believe NCR’s CEO has been a Silent Killer is by engaging promotional deals and 
wasteful capital allocation decisions with his “buddies” that don’t appear to benefit NCR’s shareholders.  
 
For example, in 2011 NCR announced (with no financial details) that “NCR and Empower Software 
Solutions sign referral agreement.” Empower is described as having a Workforce Management software 
designed to provide customers, particularly in the retail industry, with a strategic resource to help them 
deploy staff more effectively.  
 
Commenting on the announcement, EVP John Bruno said “Empower’s technology can create new value 
for customers, especially when combined with our assisted- and self-service solutions, and is highly 
aligned with our hardware-enabled, software-driven business model.” 
 
Now if you’re confused as to why a workforce management product has any synergy with NCR’s retail 
point-of-sale checkout devices, you’re not alone! 
 
Commenting on the deal from Empower’s side, its CEO Seth Bernstein said “We are pleased to create a 
dynamic new sales channel for Empower while providing NCR’s customers with an opportunity to 
leverage their technology investments.” 
 
Who is Seth Bernstein and What Do People Think of Him? 
 
Seth Bernstein is currently listed as both a Director of Outerwall (Nasdaq: OUTR), a $1.3 billion market 
cap company known for its Redbox kiosks, as well as a Director of Lighting Science Group (OTCBB: LSCG), 



http://www.ncr.com/news/news-releases/retail/empower-referral-agreement
a penny stock that has burned $165m in the past three years and has an accumulated shareholder 
deficit of $487m as of its last Annual Report on March 30, 2015.  
 
There are various public biographies available for Mr. Bernstein. According to LSCG’s proxy statement 
filed August 1, 2014 Mr. Bernstein is 38 years old and: 
 
“Seth Bernstein serves as Global Vice-President for Business Development and Strategy for NCR 
Corporation, a global technology company. He is also a Senior Advisor to Craig Cogut and Pegasus 
Capital and Pegasus Capital and Mr. Bernstein have entered into a general consulting agreement 
pursuant to which Mr. Bernstein provides consulting services to Pegasus Capital. Prior to joining NCR, 
from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Bernstein was owner and chief executive officer of Empower Software Solutions, 
a leading national provider of innovative and state-of-the-art human resources solutions. Mr. Bernstein 
is also a member of the Board of Advisors of KPMG LLP, a director of Forstmann Little and Company, a 
member of the University of Central Florida’s Board and Athletic Board, and the Board of the American 
Spectator. He and his wife founded the Kids House organization where he currently serves as a board 
member. He is also the Chairman of the Compound Foundation. Mr. Bernstein is a graduate of the 
University of Connecticut. Pegasus Capital intends to elect Mr. Bernstein to serve as a director pursuant 
to certain rights set forth in the Series I Certificate of Designation and described elsewhere in this Proxy 
Statement.” 
 
According to Outerwall, Mr Bernstein was elected to its Board on December 4, 2014 (8-K Filing) and sits 
on its Compensation Committee (here). 
 
“Seth Bernstein was named as a director of Outerwall in December 2014. He has served as the president 
of Pegasus Advisory Group (a private equity firm) since October 2014. Mr. Bernstein served as global 
vice president for business development and strategy for NCR Corporation (a global technology 
company) from 2012 to 2014. Prior to joining NCR, he was owner and chief executive officer of Empower 
Software Solutions (a national provider of human resources solutions) from 2007 to 2011. Mr. Bernstein 
is also a director of Lighting Science Group Corporation (a provider of light emitting diode lighting 
technology), and serves on the board of directors of Spirit Music Group (a music publishing company), Six 
Senses Hotels Resorts Spas (a hospitality management company) and several other private companies.” 
 
There are various other public references that detail Mr. Bernstein’s past, such as the Orlando Business 
Journal where he says he attended University of Connecticut (here), an article about Stromberg where 
he was appointed CEO in Jan. 2003, and prior to that was described as “one of the pioneers” of Zurich 
Payroll. There are also internet articles (here) and (here) that suggest Mr. Bernstein is a billionaire, part-
time sports agent/advisor (here), and a fixture on the Hamptons social scene (here). 
 
However, most interesting is that Mr. Bernstein appears to be a close social friend of NCR’s CEO Bill 
Nuti. In the picture at Pinterest (here), Bernstein (second from left) can be seen with Nuti. There are 
other public photographs (here) and (here) showing Mr. Nuti and Mr. Bernstein attending various social 
events with athletes and entertainers. Mr. Bernstein appears to have a history of associating himself 
with professional athletes such as former Celtic Dee Brown, who he hired as COO of Stromberg in 2003, 
but appears to have “left the firm just a few weeks later,” according to a Bernstein quote.

Having later sold Stromberg in April 2004 to Paychex, a multibillion dollar company, it would appear to 
be a deal to lend credibility to Mr. Stromburg’s career. Paychex reported in its Annual Report, that it 
paid $13.6m for the business, while the press release indicated Stromburg had sales exceeding $20m. A 
sales multiple of just 0.7x revenues may indicate that Stromburg was struggling at the time of the sale, 
or a very low margin business. One review of Stromburg on Glassdoor.com indicates that, “The salary 
was decent and good benefits…until the house of cards crashed. Seth Bernstein pointed it towards a 
volcano and lept off before anyone was able to look out the window.”  
 
Mr. Bernstein would next get involved with a company called Empagio, the predecessor of Empower 
Software via a name change, and stay there through June 29, 2012 when a new CEO was appointed, and 
Mr. Bernstein was given the title of “Founder and Chairman Emeritus.”  During this period, it appears 
that Mr. Bernstein created a loyal following of detractors. In fact, a blog was created called “Seth 
Bernstein – Bad Capitalism.” A selection of quotes are provided below: 
 


Date and Poster Quote 


“The Shocker” – April 25, 2008 I was looking at Empagio web site again recently and noticed Seth's 
bogus claim to have been president of paychex is no longer there. 
Looks like the paychex lawyers got wise to it and forced it's removal. 
I am sure he will still claim this in person though. In addition, his 
bogus story of purchasing Stromberg and growing by a grossly 
inflated amount and selling it to paychex has also been removed. 
When will this boy realize he cant continue to spread these types of 
lies and get away with it. The past will always catch up with you. 


“Interested Observer” – May 15, 2008 Seth does watch the internet and thinks he can cover his tracks and 
keep people from finding out other people's opinions of him. And 
yes, he continues to try to "clean up his image" in written form - like 
removing his bold-face lies from his bio on the Empagio website (I 
hear he was legally forced to remove the "fabrications"). 


“Dana” – May 26, 2008 What’s even more frightening is this new company he’s took over, 
Empagio (located in downtown Orlando, FL) is related to Human 
resources outsourcing for HR executives. Seth Bernstein and Human 
Resources… uggg. Kinda makes me feel like the last guy… with spit-
up in my mouth. You should see the massive number of lies he 
wrote about himself on the Empagio, Company -> Management 
Team -> webpage. Seth Bernstein is obviously delusional… and now 
the truth comes out. Freedom of Speech rocks! I guess you forgot 
about those simple little constitutional rights, huh Seth? 


“Interested” – January 27, 2009 At the root level, I think he's the definition of psychopath: 
completely self-absorbed with no regard for others. However, they 
say 70% of psychopaths active in society are in business as 
salespeople. He lives in a world where morals are fuzzy, and he's 
been taken advantage of by lawyers and bankers as often as he's 
tried to take advantage of others. 


 
 
Our background checks on Mr. Bernstein suggest the following:  


1. His description that he was a “pioneer” of Zurich, a small payroll services company, is 
embellishment, and that his role was as a salesman, not the CEO, founder, or business strategist 
that would lead one to believe he was the pioneer  


2. The media’s characterization of him as a “billionaire” may be exaggerated. He has never 
appeared on any of the Forbes billionaire lists we can find (here). Also, does it stand to reason 
that a billionaire would need to take the job of Vice President of Business Development role for 
NCR?

http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml
3. His description as to having served as a member of the Board of Advisors of KPMG may not be 
accurate. We cannot find any indication that KPMG even has a Board on its website (here) 


4. His description as first being a Senior Advisor to Pegasus Capital and then later President of 
Pegasus Advisory Group offer conflicting descriptions of his role 


5. His description of being approximately 38 or 39 years old may not be accurate. His work history 
dates back to at least prior to 1997 when he was with Zurich, and further states that he won 
awards with ADP for two consecutive years. This suggests he would have been in the work force 
by at least 1995 at the young age of 19 or 20, an age range where most kids are completing their 
early college years. Our background check indicates Mr. Bernstein may be closer in age to 47 or 
48 years old 


6. Our attempt to verify that Mr. Bernstein graduated from the University of Connecticut came 
back with the following comment: “Applied, Never Attended” 





 
Source: UCONN degree and enrollment verification (here) and National Student Clearinghouse (here) 
 
 
 
 
Now we pose the million dollar questions to NCR’s management:  
 


1. Why was Mr. Bernstein hired as Global Vice-President for Business Development and Strategy 
for NCR Corporation – a very senior role within the organization  –  in the face of publicly 
available evidence that suggests Mr. Bernstein past business experiences were problematic 


2. Why didn’t NCR issue a press release announcing the hiring of Mr. Bernstein or the creation of a 
very senior role 


3. What role did Andrea Ledford, NCR’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, have in 
approving the hire of Mr. Bernstein? Andrea’s career has followed Mr. Nuti’s career very closely. 
According to her biography, before joining NCR in February 2006, Ms. Ledford was EMEA

Leader, Human Resources, at Symbol Technologies, Inc. from 2002 to February 2006 and held a 
variety of leadership roles at Cisco Systems, Inc. in EMEA, Asia/Pacific and Latin America 


4. Why has NCR never disclosed any tangible business resulting from the Empower Software / NCR 
“referral alliance” 


5. Mr. Bernstein recently left to become a Director at another public company called Outerwall. Is 
there a connection or coincidence with the fact the NCR has done business with Outerwall in the 
past, and sold its money-losing entertainment division to it in 2012 (here)

Spruce Point Sees 45 - 70% Downside in 
NCR Corp (NCR) For the Following Reasons:


5


NCR is Facing Secular Headwinds; Levered Transformation Likely to Fail w/Limited Strategic Alternatives: 


Insider Selling and Valuation Disconnect: 


History Lesson: Many NCR Executives Came From Symbol Technologies, a Former Accounting Fraud:


Numerous Signs of Aggressive Accounting: Adj Free Cash Flow, EBITDA, EPS Appear 30-70% Overstated:3


NCR’s Pension Transformation Folly:


• NCR is selling investors on its ability to transform from a hardware to software provider while market fundamentals move rapidly against it; 


alternative and digital payment platforms (Square, Venmo, Apple Pay, Google Wallet) are eroding demand for its core ATM hardware, while its 


“banking transformation” opportunity is a melting ice cube. Plenty of examples of failed hardware/software transformations (e.g. IBM and HP)


• NCR has paid an avg. enterprise value to sales and EBITDA of 4x and 23x, respectively, for the acquisitions of Retalix, Radiant, and Digital 


Insight. In the process, it has bloated its balance sheet with goodwill and intangibles of $3.7bn and has adjusted leverage >5x


• We will present evidence to suggest NCR has botched its acquisitions, has almost no organic growth, and has limited strategic options to 


recover value by selling assets. German Wincor-Nixdorf recently pre-warned (its stock plunged 18%), and is also exploring alternatives. The 


two companies are unlikely to create value together or buy one another. NCR has no ability to buyback stock or pay a dividend


• NCR’s CEO Bill Nuti joined Symbol in 2002 during an accounting scandal and was elevated to its CEO. His record suggests he 


overpromised and undelivered a turnaround, while not having a clear handle on unresolved accounting problems


• Nuti recruited many former Symbol employees, including his lieutenant and Symbol’s Chief Information Officer John Bruno, who Nuti hailed 


as a “visionary.” Bruno recently resigned from NCR along with at least a dozen senior NCR executives according to our research


• We observe many striking similarities between what unfolded during Nuti’s tenure at Symbol and NCR’s current predicament


• NCR’s sold investors on its ability to deal with its large unfunded US pension. It raised debt at 5% only to shift its entire US pension to fixed 


income in 2012, and miss the greatest stock market rally in history. This supports our criticism of NCR’s capital allocation follies


• NCR’s pension strategy also had the goals of 1) reducing the GAAP/Non-GAAP differential of its financial results, and 2) reducing on-going 


pension contributions. Evidence suggests that NCR has failed on both counts and has struggled with its int’l pension, which it claims is 


overfunded, yet continues to make regular contributions labelled as “discretionary” but may be covered up as “settlements”


• NCR appears to be playing multiple accounting tricks to embellish its financials, and paint a picture of improving results. Our alternative view 


suggests otherwise. The most egregious case is mgmt.’s portrayal that its “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” should be adjusted for its “Discretionary” 


pension contribution “and settlements” on a “pre-tax” basis. NCR has also made changes to its pension acct’g, distorted its EBIT with various 


non-operating gains, under-reserved for doubtful accounts, and presented securitized receivables as operating cash flows


• Our cash-based analysis suggests NCR’s Adj. EBITDA, EPS and FCF are overstated by approximately 30, 40%, and 70%, respectively


• The CEO and CFO own a pitiful 0.40% of the stock; CEO Nuti started increasing share sales in 2013. The Street thinks NCR’s shares are 


fairly valued, but have missed the accounting gimmicks, and are basing its valuation on meaningless adjusted figures. The bulls also see a 


team of activists capable of saving a sinking ship, and “alternatives” to increase its share price, but we see little value at NCR using various 


valuation methods, including a sales-based sum-of-the parts approach, we reach a price range of $9 - $16/sh (45–70% downside)

in its SEC filings


NCR’s Original Adjusted FCF Definition in 2012Spruce Point Correctly Adjusts NCR’s Free Cash Flow


NCR’s “Adjusted Free Cash Flow Presentation” is worthless as an indicator of its financial health: NCR has focused investors exclusively on its US 


pension issue, but its Int’l pension also appears plagued with problems. NCR appears to be including contributions to its overfunded international 


pension plan as discretionary and may be covering this up by changing its discretionary definition to include “settlements!” NCR asks investors to 


evaluate its cash flow excluding “discretionary” pension contribution on a pre-tax basis, when we believe it should be evaluated on an after-tax basis for an 


apples-to-apples comparison with operating cash flow. To support our case, we have identified numerous multinationals that show discretionary pensions on an 


after-tax basis (see Appendix). Yet, even these may be inappropriate ways of viewing pension payments, as we believe the distinction between “discretionary” 


and “non-discretionary” is semantics that distracts from its core problems. The credit rating agencies such as Moody’s and S&P view pension contributions as 


forms of debt repayment, and not operating cash flows (See Appendix). NCR has taken its approach to the extreme, and even changed its bonus plan to reward 


its management team for a blatantly distorted calculation, and appears to have misled investors about the change to its definition (See Appendix).

GAAP/Non-GAAP Financials Are Overstated

We view NCR’s “Net 


Pension Operating Income 


(NPOI),” “Adjusted EBITDA” 


and “Adjusted EPS” as 


unreliable indicators of the 


company’s performance


Our analysis attempts to 


adjust NCR’s results for the 


numerous accounting 


distortions plaguing its 


financials. We believe the 


two biggest issues are 


1) pension accounting and 


2) its tax expense


We believe the best way 


to evaluate NCR’s major 


accounting distortions is 


on a cash basis, not an 


accrual basis. 


Fortunately, buried deep in 


its footnotes, NCR discloses 


cash contributions to 


various pension and benefit 


programs, cash taxes paid, 


and cash interest expense. 


Our analysis suggests that 


NCR’s key financial metrics 


are significantly overstated

Tactic Description Example 1 Example 2 Our  Observations


Creative 
M&A 
Accounting


With limited/no organic growth 
NCR has structured several 
strategic and M&A deals in 


aggressive ways intended to 
bolster its financials


Announced the sale of its money losing 
Entertainment business to Redbox in 


Q1’12. Took a write down in Q4’11 only 
to book a gain in Q2’12 when the deal 
closed. Deal stipulates a ‘short-term’ 


services agreement with a minimum of 
$25m of margin over 5yrs


Paid huge premium for Digital Insight
(DI). Its current GAAP EBIT of ~29% bears 
no resemblance to DI’s previous EBIT as a 


stand alone entity, or under Intuit’s 
ownership  where it was in the 4-6% 


range


NCR appears to be running free 
margin through its income st, 


claiming it has no relation to the 
assets it sold.  DI transaction 


generated goodwill and 
intangibles of $1.8bn, which may


have enabled capitalization of 
costs on its balance sheet


Creative
Pension 
Accounting


NCR has historically had a large 
unfunded pension. Pension 


accounting is arcane and often 
overlooked by investors. NCR has 
made various aggressive moves 


to paper over the problem 


NCR changed its pension accounting in 
2013 to recognize changes in fair value 
of assets and net actuarial gains/losses 
into P+L faster than in its prior method.  
NCR changed its discount rate curve in 


2012 from Citigroup to Aon, which 
increased the rate, lowered the PBO


NCR allocates its pension expense across 
product and service costs, SG&A, and 
R&D expense lines, which blurs the
analysis of its continuing operating 


results 


NCR’s change in pension acct’g 
method is rare in practice. NCR’s 
goal was to shrink the difference 


between GAAP/Non-GAAP results 
and reduce pension costs, but the 


exact opposite has occurred


Failure to 
Accrue 
for Liabilities


Accruing for loss contingencies is 
subject to mgmt. discretion 


regarding the loss being probable 
and the ability to estimate a 


range. An accrual would result in 
a charge to earnings 


Mid 2014, NCR disclosed a potentially
material tax issue in Brazil related to 
imports that it said it would appeal; 


initially it could not quantify the 
problem, but now estimates a range of 
loss to be $0 - $66m (up to 36% of its 


2014 GAAP net income) 


--


Tax dispute has potential to be 
highly material. It coincides with 


the termination of the 
Scopus/Bradesco relationship. 


Previous errors with Brazilian tax 
accounts (see below). Symbol 


Tech. also disclosed errors in its 
Brazilian acct’g


One-time
Items
Affecting 
SG&A 


One time property gains have 
been used to reduce continuing 


operating expenses such as 
SG&A. Recurring gains on PP&E 
sales are higher than $ proceeds


2011: $4m increase to SG&A to correct 
certain tax accounts in Brazil 


determined to be unrecoverable 
(may be related to Scopus; what do tax 


accounts have to do with SG&A?)


2012 and 2013: $5m and $7m property 
gains classified as a reduction to 


SG&A expense 


We believe property and PP&E 
gains are not-continuing in nature, 


and should be in other 
income/expense. As a result EBIT 


and NPOI are overstated

Many More Accounting Gimmicks

Tactic Description Example 1 Example 2 Our  Observations


Under-Accruing
for Trade 
Receivables, 
Allowance for 
Doubtful 
Accounts


Acct’g for Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts is subject to 


mgmt. discretion and under-
reserving could indicate that 
NCR is not taking appropriate 
charges for bad debt expense


When NCR acquired Retalix, its acct’s 
receivable growth started outpacing 
sales growth; 6 months later, when 


allocating the deal price, NCR boosted 
Retalix’s accounts receivable by 45%, 


but NCR’s consolidated allowance
went up by just $4m


Digital insights carve-out financials from 
Intuit contained almost no allowance 
for doubtful accounts. When it was a 
standalone public entity, it accrued at 


~4% of gross receivables. NCR’s 
consolidated allowance account did not 


increase at all!


NCR’s allowance has declined steadily 
since 2012 to just 1.3% of gross


receivables. Each of NCR’s recent 
acquisitions accrued for allowances at a 


significantly higher rate than NCR at 
approximately  3% – 9%


Tax Valuation 
Allowance 
Reversals


Reversals in valuation 
allowances are very subjective 
decisions made by mgmt. and 


can be used to manipulate 
earnings. We believe mgmt. 


may be using aggressive tactics 
to manage its tax rate


In 2014, NCR cited a $9m reduction in 
the U.S. valuation allowance and a 


favorable mix of earnings by country, 
driven by actuarial pension losses due 
to a change in the U.S. mortality table.


In 2013, NCR took a favorable release of 
a $10m valuation allowance due to the 


implementation of a tax planning 
strategy, a $15m reduction in allowance 


related to a Japan subsidiary, and a 
favorable mix of earnings by country, 


primarily related to lower pension 
benefit


NCR’s effective tax rate has varied 
wildly: (35)% in 2014, 18% in 2013, and 
32% in 2012. Its valuation reversals are 


material. As a % of GAAP reported 
income tax expense, these reversals 


amount to 17% and 26% for 2013 and 
2014 ($0.15c and $0.05c benefit per 


share). NCR reported paying cash taxes 
of $70 and $75m in 2013 and 2014.


Misclassification 
of Operating 
and Financing 
Cash Flow 
Leading to 
Distorted Free
Cash Flow


We believe NCR’s earnings 
quality is low, and it’s important 
to focus on its free cash flow. 
We believe mgmt. is presenting 
a misleading view of both 
operating and adjusted free cash 
flow


NCR utilized $96m of its Trade A/R 
facility in Q4’14  and listed it as an 
increase in short-term debt in its 
balance sheet and footnotes, but 


reported no increase in short-term 
debt through its financing section on 
the cash flow statement. Operating 


cash flows appear to be 
overstated by $96m 
(18% of 2014 total)


NCR tries to sell to investors that its 
pension expense is ‘discretionary’ and 


should be added back to free cash flow. 
However, NCR quietly changed its 


definition to include “Settlements” and 
presents its pension expense on a pre-


tax basis, resulting in a misleading view. 
To make matters worse, NCR’s mgmt. is 


rewarding themselves with bonuses 
tied to an egregious free cash flow 


definition


NCR sold its receivables to a special 
purpose subsidiary, which then pledges 
the receivables. NCR is accounting for it 
as an operating cash flow, but we view 
it as a financing structure. We view the 


‘discretionary’ nomenclature as 
misleading, as it is largely a capital 


allocation decision by mgmt. Our pro 
forma adjusted estimates suggest that 


NCR’s free cash flow is >70% 
overstated
Warning: CEO Nuti’s NCR Tenure 
Looking More Like Symbol Days

Symbol Technologies NCR Corp


Acquisition 
Strategy


7/24/2004: Nuti’s largest acquisition was Matrics for $230m in cash;
dilutive to earnings w/substantial goodwill ($195m), a bet on RFID growth 
driver as an apparent attempt to cover slowing growth elsewhere. The 
deal would later called a disaster by an analyst


Recent acquisitions since 2011 include Radiant, Retalix and Digital Insight have bloated 
NCR’s balance sheet with goodwill and leverage. Paid substantial $600m premium for 
Digital Insight 5 months after Thoma Bravo acquired it from Intuit. Various indicators 
suggest these acquisitions are hampering growth and have been poorly executed


Aggressive 
Accounting


Though Nuti was not directly charged, while at Symbol ''This was a 
veritable playbook of corporate fraud,'' the prosecutor, Roslynn R. 
Mauskopf, said of Symbol. ''They cooked the books every which way they 
could.'‘ - channel stuffing, candy deals, tango sheets and cookie jar 
reserves to manage earnings, manipulation of inventory levels and acct’s 
receivable data to conceal effects of bad revenue recognition


Indicators of aggressive acct’g show strains in NCR’s financials include: Days Sales 
Outstanding rising rapidly, Acct’s Receivable growing much faster than sales, changes to 
pension accounting, widening rift between GAAP/Non-GAAP results, reversals of tax 
valuation allowances, crediting one-time gains towards reductions in operating 
expenses, obfuscating dependence on short-term financing with trade A/R facility


Brazil
Dealings


March 2002, sold 49% ownership in Symbol Brazil; later in Dec 2003 
admitted an accounting error where certain expenses should have been 
charged to earnings. Federal indictment cited channel stuffing linked to a 
“South American” distributor and also referenced Brazil 


July 2011, sold 49% of NCR Brazil to Scopus (owned by Banco Bradesco). In mid 2014, 
Bradesco sold Scopus; NCR has not disclosed what liability it has for the repurchase of 
Scopus’ stake, but instead has said a ‘tax dispute’ may result in a range of losses 
between 0 - $66m. In 2011, made adjustments to SG&A to correct Brazil tax accounts


Overly 
Optimistic 
Guidance


After his hire in 2012, Nuti guided investors to 15% operating margins (not 
achieved), a “massive opportunity,” and the chance to rival Cisco


6/28/2005: Slashed previous guidance issued in May 2015 from the range 
of $460 - $470m, to ~$440m 


7/14/2005: Two weeks after the previous guide down, Symbol again 
slashed revenue to a new range of $425 - $430m; CFO resigns


11/11/2013: Sets long-term FY16 sales goal of $7.3 - $7.7bn, Gross margin to grow over 
31% (Note: Nuti would later say gross margins could go to 35%), NPOI (% of sales) to 
17% vs. 11.7% in FY13 and 37% of sales to be recurring
Q1’14: Lowers revenue growth range by 2%, maintains NPOI and EPS guidance
10/20/14: Pre-announces Q3 results; blames worsening retail env’t (spending shift and 
consolidation), FX, and macro headwinds. Full sales lowered from $6.75 - $6.85bn to 
$6.575 - $6.625bn, full yr. NPOI from $900 - $920m to $810 - $840m and Non-GAAP EPS 
from $3.00 - $3.10 to $2.60-$2.70/sh


Restructuring 6/28/05: Announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs and drive profits, 
due to “economic sluggishness particularly in the global retail market.” 
Expects to take a total pre-tax, charge of $75 - $95m associated w/cost 
saving initiatives, of which 2/3rds will be cash charges and the remaining 
1/3rd will be non-cash charges. Expects to record roughly half of the total 
pre-tax charges in the Q2’2005, with the rest in the next two quarters


7/29/14: Announced a restructuring “to strategically reallocate our resources to our 
highest growth, highest margin opportunities.” Expects to incur a pre-tax charge in the 
range of ~$150 - $200m that will be included in income from operations, with ~$150m 
recorded in 2014 and the remainder in 2015. The estimate includes both severance and 
asset related charges. The cash impact of the restructuring is expected to be ~$50m in 
2014 and $50m in 2015. Annualized savings are expected to reach ~$90m by 2016.


Key Mgmt
Hires


Various Hires from Nuti’s previous employer Cisco include: 
John Bruno,  Peter Leav, Andrea Ledford, Michael Bayer


Nuti followers from Symbol: John Bruno (fmr CIO). Peter Leav (fmr Director of Sales), 
Richard Bravman (fmr CEO), Adam Mallah (fmr Financial, Planning and Analysis ), 
Andrea Ledford (fmr HR Director), Michael Bayer (fmr VP), John Gregg (CEO NCR Brazil)


Nuti Stock 
Liquidations


12/30/05:  Nuti sold 400,000 shares for $6.6m his only substantive sale 
before a large guidance miss


Starts selling shares in Dec 2012 after acquiring Retalix and claiming “Retalix is a strong, 
strategic fit for NCR and the combination of our two companies will drive significant 
value for both our shareholders and customers.” Retalix would appear to be a disaster

In 2014, NCR booked a $5m gain for something we estimate had 
nearly zero net book value, and netted it just $1m.


NCR is leaving these accounting gains in EBIT and in its definition of 
NPOI, thus representing them as a part of continuing operations

Spin off / 
Sale of Assets


Assets include Digital Insight, 
Retalix, Radiant and ATM 


Hardware/Software
Maintenance business


Each of Digital Insight, Retalix and Radiant were already 
public companies and NCR appeared to be the highest 


bidder. What value is to be unlocked by spinning out the 
assets it just bought?


Digital Insight’s growth has stalled, yet NCR paid an above 
market price for it. Retalix may be impaired due to its 


associate with the Target data breach. NCR’s hospitality 
segment (where Radiant is a big contributor) has shown 


significant margin pressure


Initiation of 
Dividend


Pay a regular or one-time 
special dividend to shareholders


Majority of NCR’s cash is trapped abroad in foreign 
jurisdictions. NCR’s credit facility places limitations on 
“Restricted Payments.” NCR has limited flexibility to 


borrow to pay a dividend, which would not be financially 
prudent given its struggles


Initiation of regular dividend won’t be viewed positively
by rating agencies and most likely cause a downgrade. If 
NCR’s financial deteriorate further, and the dividend is 


cut/reduced, substantial credibility will be lost


Repurchase of 
Stock


Authorize a share repurchase 
program to retire stock, 
provides an EPS boost


Majority of NCR’s cash is trapped abroad in foreign 
jurisdictions. NCR’s credit facility places limitation on 
“Restricted Payments.” NCR has limited flexibility to 


borrow to buy stock


We believe NCR’s share price is overvalued, and view a 
buyback as an irrational action. Won’t be viewed 


positively by rating agencies and most likely cause a 
downgrade, increasing its cost of capital, and hampering 


future financial flexibility.
Exploring “Alternatives” For Months, With No 
Outcome, Old News Is No News on NCR


15


Source Commentary


Morgan Stanley Equity Report
October 24, 2014


Will NCR pursue strategic alternatives? The Board continues to evaluate existing assets and potential
for divesting non-core businesses outside of Financial Services, Retail, and Hospitality, as well as capital
allocation and the potential for shareholder return. As it relates to potential for break-up,
management is open to considering proposals from its shareholders. While cost dissynergies could
arise upon company split, the largest complexity surrounds separation of the services component of
the business


Bill Nuti, CEO on the Conf Call
October 23, 2014 
(here)


“Well, I would say the following. First of all, top of mind for me and our Board of Directors is improving
how our performance, improving our ability to drive what we believe is an undervalued share price
back to an appropriate value. And, in doing that, what we'd normally do in current course of speed and
routinely is looking at strategic alternatives and how can we do that. And, of course, in the context of
that, capital structure becomes a discussion and there are a variety of ways in which we believe we can
return capital to shareholders. It is safe to say right now that, while we feel very comfortable with the
assets we have, M&A is off the table. So we are looking at all of the appropriate things that you would
think we would look that at to improve value, including where it makes sense, divestitures of non-core
businesses, which I won't get into details on the call today”


NCR’s 10-K Disclosure 
February 27, 2015 (here)


“Circumstances associated with divestitures could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of our businesses and products and may
decide to sell a business or product based on such an evaluation. Despite a decision to divest a
business or product, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit
strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. In addition, prospective buyers may
have difficulty obtaining financing. Divestitures could involve additional risks”


“The terms of the documents governing our indebtedness include financial and other covenants that
could restrict or limit our financial and business operations. Our senior secured credit facility and the
indentures for our senior unsecured notes include (among other things): incur additional indebtedness,
repurchase our common stock, pay dividends or make similar distributions on our capital stock

NCR’s Transformation Strategy 
Likely to Fail Miserably
Warning: German ATM Competitor 
Wincor-Nixdorf Just Guided Down Big


1717


April 10, 2015


• Wincor Nixdorf AG will not meet its guidance for net sales and 


EBITA issued for the current 2014/2015 fiscal year. After six months 


of the current fiscal year, the company's net sales are 2% short of 


the comparative prior-year figure, while EBITA is down 31% on the 


figure for the same period a year ago (based on preliminary figures). 


The year-on-year decline is attributable primarily to a contraction by 


12% in net sales from Hardware business. Growth generated by 


Software and IT Services was not sufficiently strong to offset the 


aforementioned decline


• A restructuring program is being initiated for the purpose of 


counteracting developments seen within the Hardware sector


Pre-Warning That Sales/EBITA Targets Won’t Be Met


Wincor Asks Banks to Seek Alternatives


Source: Wincor warns (here) and seeks alternatives (here)


April 8, 2015


• German ATM maker Wincor Nixdorf has asked investment banks 


to come up with ideas to secure the future of the group, including 


a potential sale to a private equity group, two people familiar with 


the matter said


• The rise of online banking and e-commerce poses a 


structural challenge to Wincor, which has been struggling with 


low capital expenditures of banks eager to keep costs in check 


while emerging from the financial crisis


• Wincor competes with the likes of U.S.-based NCR Corp or 


Japan's Oki Electric, although these groups may not be 


potential takeover targets, one of the sources said.


• "If Wincor opts for an acquisition, I would suspect they would buy 


a company in emerging markets as that's where ATM numbers 


are still on the rise," one of the sources said


We view Wincor’s recent struggles as a harbinger of NCR’s 


continued challenges. Given NCR’s limited financial flexibility, 


we view a combination between the two companies as unlikely. 


This sentiment appears to be shared by a market observer


Wincor trades at 6x 2015 EBITDA and 0.5x sales. Its closest 


competitor is NCR. Its market cap is approximately $1.3 billion and 


has ~$3.2bn of sales (~65% banking and 35% retail solutions). 


Wincor’s shareholders have a much more realistic view then NCR’s 


shareholders when it comes to the prospect for strategic alternatives

Warning: New Research Suggests That 
ATM Growth is Starting to Roll Over


18


• According to the 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study: U.S. ATM withdrawal transactions decreased at a 1.1% CAGR over the three-


year period from 2009 to 2012. However, withdrawal volume in dollars increased at a modest 1.2% pace – far below economic output


• Number of Noncash Payments in the U.S. Increased: At a compound annual rate of 4.4% from 2009 - 2012. There were more than 250 


million mobile payments made using a mobile wallet application, and at least 205 million person-to-person or money transfer payment


• ATM Headwinds Are Global in Nature: To illustrate, in the Euro area where the ECB tabulates payment statistics, it reported that ATM 


terminals actually declined 3.5% from 2011 – 2013. In Australia, the Payments Clearing Association reports ATM withdrawals declined 10.8% 


over the same 2011 – 2013 period


• ATM Pressures Reflected in Industry Survey: A recently released survey of U.S. ATM deployers revealed that that both Declining 


Transactions and ATM Saturation were the two biggest fears among industry participants

Warning: NCR’s “Branch Transformation” 
Growth Driver Rests on Faulty Assumptions


1919


Sources:  NCR promotes Branch Transformation (here)
“U.S. Banks Prune More Branches,” Wall St Journal, Jan 2014 (here)
“Banks Need to Chop, Not Prune, Branch Offices,” July 2014 (here) 
“Bank Branches Slowly Fading Away in Neighborhoods,” Nov 2014 (here)           


NCR’s executives have been touting its Branch Transformation business as 


a growth engine for its Financial Services business (see quotes on the 


right). The premise behind the business has been that retail banks need to 


adapt to changing customer needs, improve the customer experience, 


reduce costs, and generate new revenue streams


What NCR fails to acknowledge is that retail bank branches are finally 


starting to decline with recent closures accelerating due to customer 


migration to mobile, ability to make deposits with smart phone 


cameras, and greater overall online usage adoption


• Bank branch closures in the U.S hit a net 1,462 in 2014, on par with 


1,487 net branch closures in 2013 according to SNL Financial, the 


highest levels since the research firm began collecting the data in 2002


• Branch numbers have been on a steady decline since 2009, and reached 


a total of 96,339 at the middle of 2013, the lowest since 2006 according 


to data from the FDIC


• Cutting branch locations with real estate, labor and security costs has 


been a popular way for banks to boost profits amidst sluggish revenue 


and loan growth, higher compliance costs, and lower returns on capital


• Deposits from snapping pictures from smartphones and tablets is on the 


rise too


• Meanwhile some industry analysts predict that banks need to chop, not 


simply prune branches. In order to "rationalize" the banking business, the 


average U.S. midsized bank "could eliminate roughly one-third of its 


branch count," according to financial research firm Sanford C. Bernstein


• "Branch utilization is plummeting, and over the next decade, banks will 


have an opportunity to dramatically downsize their brick-and-mortar 


footprint," a senior Bernstein analyst said


“Branch transformation can ultimately be larger than the ATM business 


and we are extremely pleased with the results of current pilots underway” 


Peter Leav (Q3’12 Conf Call) – Peter Leav resigned Dec 2013


“We see branch transformation happening in a tremendous way”


John Bruno (Analyst Meeting, 2012) John Bruno resigned Aug 2014


Warning:  Andy Heyman, SVP of Financial Services, now leads Branch 


Transformation. He came to NCR through the Radiant acquisition, a 


business focused on Hospitality and not Financial Services


Source:  “The Future of U.S. Retail Banking Distribution,” McKinsey, Aug 2014 (here)


The Reality is that Customers Are Interacting Less 


Frequently with Branches Have Low ATM Interaction

Main use for 
NCR’s Airport 


Kiosks shows the 
market is almost 


saturated


• NCR has a big airport kiosk check-in business and claims it is the number one provider of self-check in kiosks in the world


• This business is part of NCR’s Hospitality segment which makes up ~10% of revenue and operating income contribution


• SITA’s 2013 Airport Information Technology Survey indicates check-in kiosks will have almost universally been adopted by airports:  


• By the end of 2016, 98% of airports surveyed will offer passengers the option


• Check-in functionality is the main use for airport kiosks, although other usages are expected to grow for baggage


• Overall, we believe this research implies little room for incremental market share gains and growth in the near future


• Replacement cycles for these commoditized kiosks products can be 5 – 10 years according to estimates


• In this time frame, how many more cheaper solutions will hit the market? 


• There are already dozens of standard and customized solutions available from a global manufacturing and supplier base

Warning: NCR Silver – Its “Cloud POS” 
Product Appears To Be A Bust


28
Source: SemRush.com


• On June 27, 2012 NCR launched Silver, its cloud-based point-of-


sale (POS) software platform that enables small business owners 


and entrepreneurs to take payments and manage their entire 


business with one POS solution, changing the way small business 


owners manage their business. The original pricing was $79/month


• There are multiple indicators that NCR Silver has failed to gain 


critical mass and may not be a material source of growth for NCR


• Competition has intensified, forcing NCR to cut its pricing to 


$39.99/month or 50% according to web-ads 


• NCR stopped disclosing its Silver customers on its quarterly 


conference call as of Q2 2014


• Coincides with dramatic decline in search results for Silver 


according to Semrush, and;


• Silver has failed to gain critical mass at the Apple App Store, 


and has not received a sufficient amount of customers reviews


SemRush Data Shows NCR Silver is Being Heavily Promoted With Limited Success

IBM NCR Admits Long-Term 


goals not achievable


• In citing the feasibility of its strategic plan, NCR compared itself with IBM: IBM’s goal is to diversify away from hardware to more 


software and services. During its 2013 Analyst Day on November 11, 2013, NCR proclaimed its strategy drives a new business model


with the goal of doubling software revenue in just eight years 


• We believe this slide highlights precisely why investors should discount NCR’s goals: Transformations among large global 


companies are incredibly hard to achieve, a lesson IBM shareholders learned in a painful way. In Oct 2014, IBM dropped a bomb on


its shareholders that its long-term EPS goal of $20/share could no longer be achieved


• Perhaps the most disturbing news was IBM’s services and software results: Two areas highlighted as high-value strategic 


business to IBM reported the following: “Pre-tax income from Global Technology Services decreased 11 percent and pre-tax margin 


decreased to 17.7%. Global Business Services pre-tax income decreased 15 percent and pre-tax margin decreased to 17.5%

Symbol Technologies Fraud: A 
History Lesson and Critical Case 
Study For NCR Shareholders
NCR’s CEO Joined From Symbol 
Technologies, an Accounting Scandal


323232


Source:  SEC vs. Symbol Technologies (here)
Symbol appoints Nuti as COO (here)
Symbol appoints Nuti as CEO (here)


• Symbol Technologies was a former Wall St. tech darling that supplied mobile information systems using bar code scanners, 


and related technologies. Symbol was tainted by a massive accounting scandal that resulted in 11 former executives being 


charged by the SEC for numerous fraudulent accounting practices and other misconduct that had a cumulative net impact of 


over $230 million on Symbol's reported revenue and over $530 million on its pre-tax earnings from at least 1998 – 2003


• The conduct alleged that the executives disregarded GAAP accounting principles and financial reporting obligations:


a) Used a "Tango sheet" process through which baseless accounting entries were made to conform the raw quarterly 


results to management's projections;


b) Fabrication and misuse of restructuring and other non-recurring charges to artificially reduce operating expenses, create 


"cookie jar" reserves and further manage earnings;


c) Channel stuffing and other revenue recognition schemes, involving both product sales and customer services; and


d) Manipulation of inventory levels and accounts receivable data to conceal the adverse side effects of the revenue 


recognition schemes


 On July 16, 2002 during this tumultuous period, Symbol announced that Bill Nuti would join as President and COO after 


having spent 10 years at Cisco Systems. By Dec 2003, Nuti would be appointed CEO just as Symbol also would file its 


delayed 10-K that contained restatements, which contained reversal of cumulative net revenue of approximately $234.2m 


and cumulative net earnings of $324.7m


 Commenting on his appointment, Nuti said, "During the past year the Symbol team has made substantial progress in cultural 


and organizational development, our balance sheet and income statement have improved considerably, productivity is up, we've 


attracted great management talent from several top companies, and our business controls have been greatly strengthened. 


Now that we are nearing the end of our long investigation into accounting improprieties by the former management of Symbol, our 


associates will be happy to have this chapter of the Company's history behind us. We believe that Symbol is extremely well 


positioned to capitalize on our accomplishments of this past year, and our clear leadership in the enterprise mobility space. As we 


continue to stay focused on business plan execution, Symbol will establish itself as an important player in the future of the


technology industry."

Nuti’s Track Record Suggests He’s Born 
to Sell, Suited to Disappoint 


333333


• It’s important to understand Nuti’s history with Symbol for insights into his management abilities. This is especially true since he 


was brought into Symbol to fix an ailing company, and later to remake NCR


• It’s important to consider that Nuti’s early background was not in operations, turnarounds, or finance, but rather sales. His first 


job as a child was selling newspapers as a paper boy. His early professional career experience and rise through Cisco was also from a 


sales background, where during his first five years, he held mostly domestic US sales management positions, and prior to that held 


management and field sales positions at IBM, Network Equipment Technologies and Netrix 


• A Forbes article during April 2004 about his opportunity at Symbol reflect Nuti’s over-confidence and hubris as a salesman:


• “If we execute correctly, we could rival Cisco,” Nuti says. “That’s not cockiness. That’s confidence.”


• “I didn’t come to Symbol just to fix it,” he says solemnly. “The opportunity here is massive.”


• Forbes reported further:  “After his 2002 hire Nuti told institutional investors and analysts he could hit 15% operating margins by 2005, 


but he now backs away from that vow. With margins at 10%, he admits Symbol is unlikely to get to 15% by next year. In September the 


company surprised investors by announcing a $218 million jury award against it in a business dispute with Delaware-based Smart 


Media in an Ohio state court. Yet Symbol had never mentioned the case in any of its prior disclosures. “It was judged not to be material,” 


a Symbol spokesman says. The company is appealing the verdict”


• This wouldn’t be the only time Nuti apparently misled investors with overly optimistic promises. He later turned to M&A with an 


expensive bet on the emerging RFID space. On July 27. 2004 Symbol acquired Matrics for $230m in cash. Pete Abell, an RFID industry 


consultant with EPC Group in Boston, commented “that deal has turned out to be nothing but a disaster,“ and Symbol inherited 


preexisting lawsuits with Intermec concerning RFID patents


• Furthermore, despite earlier promises that Symbol’s “business controls have been greatly strengthened” and that the problems inherited 


by the former management team were a closed chapter, on Nov 8. 2004 Symbol dropped another bomb on investors when it delayed its


filings and noted inventory errors and discrepancies impacting revenues


• Shortly after the fiasco on Dec 30, 2004, Nuti would go on to sell 400,000 shares and realize $6.6m of proceeds – this would prove to be 


his only substantive stock sale, before things got really bad

• As FY 2005 progressed, Symbol appeared to be on a better financial footing. On May 3, 2005 it released Q1 2005 results that 


reported revenues of $457.5m and a profit of $22.2m or $0.09 per share. Additional highlights included


• Eight sequential quarters of increased product bookings, reaching $382.5 million and representing a 9 percent year-over-year 


increase over $351.9 million in product bookings in 2004's first quarter.


• Five sequential quarters of DSOs below 30 days.


• First-quarter 2005 inventory turns of 5.8, the highest of any quarter of the last two years.


• Cash flow from operations of $72.7 million


 However, the guidance was cautionary: Symbol said it expected Q2’2015 sales would be in a range of $460 – $470m, representing 


growth of 1 – 3% sequentially and 6 – 9% year-over-year. With regard to full-year revenue guidance, Symbol believed that revenue growth 


for FY 2005 would likely be at the lower end of its previously disclosed 10 – 15% range 


 Two months later on June 28, 2005 Symbol would lower revenue guidance to ~$440m and announce a restructuring including a pre-tax


charge of $75 - $95m and the elimination of 700 positions. 


• Commenting on the restructuring, Nuti said, “Now that we are in the next phase of Symbol’s evolution, we must balance our spending 


on the activities needed to drive profitable growth, while maintaining strong financial controls and business processes.”.....”We remain 


confident in Symbol’s future prospects and position as a leader in the enterprise mobility segment”


 Just Two Weeks Later, on July 14, 2005 Symbol’s would again lower its revenue guidance to $425m - $430m and its CFO Mark Greenquist 


would resign from the company, and be replaced by Sal Iannuzzi. Contradicting Nuti’s earlier comments, Iannuzzi said, “Symbol has made 


major strides in improving our financial controls, but much work remains in areas such as forecasting.”


• With Symbol’s shares near the bottom of a 52wk range, on August 1, 2005 Nuti would resign and be appointed as CEO of NCR as Mark


Hurd’s replacement (Note: Hurd would later become CEO of Hewlett Packard, but resigned following discovery of inappropriate conduct in 


an investigation into a claim of sexual harassment made by HP exhibition contractor and former reality TV actress)

 Nuti has found a loyal group of people to follow him in his career, first from Cisco to Symbol, and then to NCR. One such person is John 


Bruno, who Nuti has often showered with praise befitting a superstar, though the record may suggest otherwise


 11/4/2002: Bruno is appointed Symbol’s SVP of Business Development and Chief Information Officer, following Nuti’s arrival in July 2002


 5/6/2004:  Bruno is promoted at Symbol to SVP, Corporate Development, Chief Information Officer and corporate marketing. The press 


release states that, “Under Bruno's leadership, Symbol established a solid technology platform by creating a fully integrated 


enterprise resource planning system”


 5/1/2005: Symbol promotes Bruno to General Manager of its RFID, "John is an industry visionary who possesses an unparalleled 


capability of seeing a business opportunity and transforming it into a reality  -- such as he did with Symbol's acquisition of 


Matrics, then the leading  electronic product code (EPC)-compliant RFID company.” An industry analyst would later describe the Matrics 


deal as “nothing but a disaster,“ and Symbol inherited preexisting lawsuits with Intermec concerning RFID patents


 2/28/2006: Bruno apparently wasn’t the visionary of RFID that Nuti touted him to be; Bruno resigned from Symbol 10 months later


 10/1/2008: NCR announced Bruno as its EVP, Industry Solutions. In its press release, NCR stated that, “At Symbol, Bruno was senior vice 


president of Corporate Strategy, Marketing and Business Development, as well as general manager of the emerging markets RFID Division”  


 NCR failed to mention that Bruno was also Symbol’s Chief Information Officer, a critical role in Symbol’s organization that failed 


to deliver accurate estimates for financial planning purposes


 According to Bruno’s public Linkedin profile, he too would like everyone to forget his roles at Symbol; he conspicuously omits it!


 Bruno’s latest employer Aon also failed to include his tenure at Symbol

Warning: CEO Nuti’s NCR Tenure 
Looking More Like Symbol Days


36


Symbol Technologies NCR Corp


Acquisition 
Strategy


7/24/2004: Nuti’s largest acquisition was Matrics for $230m in cash;
dilutive to earnings w/substantial goodwill ($195m), a bet on RFID growth 
driver as an apparent attempt to cover slowing growth elsewhere. The 
deal would later called a disaster by an analyst


Recent acquisitions since 2011 include Radiant, Retalix and Digital Insight have bloated 
NCR’s balance sheet with goodwill and leverage. Paid substantial $600m premium for 
Digital Insight 5 months after Thoma Bravo acquired it from Intuit. Various indicators 
suggest these acquisitions are hampering growth and have been poorly executed


Aggressive 
Accounting


Though Nuti was not directly charged, while at Symbol ''This was a 
veritable playbook of corporate fraud,'' the prosecutor, Roslynn R. 
Mauskopf, said of Symbol. ''They cooked the books every which way they 
could.'‘ - channel stuffing, candy deals, tango sheets and cookie jar 
reserves to manage earnings, manipulation of inventory levels and acct’s 
receivable data to conceal effects of bad revenue recognition


Indicators of aggressive acct’g show strains in NCR’s financials include: Days Sales 
Outstanding rising rapidly, Acct’s Receivable growing much faster than sales, changes to 
pension accounting, widening rift between GAAP/Non-GAAP results, reversals of tax 
valuation allowances, crediting one-time gains towards reductions in operating 
expenses, obfuscating dependence on short-term financing with trade A/R facility


Brazil
Dealings


March 2002, sold 49% ownership in Symbol Brazil; later in Dec 2003 
admitted an accounting error where certain expenses should have been 
charged to earnings. Federal indictment cited channel stuffing linked to a 
“South American” distributor and also referenced Brazil 


July 2011, sold 49% of NCR Brazil to Scopus (owned by Banco Bradesco). In mid 2014, 
Bradesco sold Scopus; NCR has not disclosed what liability it has for the repurchase of 
Scopus’ stake, but instead has said a ‘tax dispute’ may result in a range of losses 
between 0 - $66m. In 2011, made adjustments to SG&A to correct Brazil tax accounts


Overly 
Optimistic 
Guidance


After his hire in 2012, Nuti guided investors to 15% operating margins (not 
achieved), a “massive opportunity,” and the chance to rival Cisco


6/28/2005: Slashed previous guidance issued in May 2015 from the range 
of $460 - $470m, to ~$440m 
7/14/2005: Two weeks after the previous guide down, Symbol again 
slashed revenue to a new range of $425 - $430m; CFO resigns


11/11/2013: Sets long-term FY16 sales goal of $7.3 - $7.7bn, Gross margin to grow over 
31% (Note: Nuti would later say gross margins could go to 35%), NPOI (% of sales) to 
17% vs. 11.7% in FY13 and 37% of sales to be recurring
Q1’14: Lowers revenue growth range by 2%, maintains NPOI and EPS guidance
10/20/14: Pre-announces Q3 results; blames worsening retail env’t (spending shift and 
consolidation), FX, and macro headwinds. Full sales lowered from$6.75 - $6.85bn to 
$6.575 - $6.625bn, full yr NPOI from to $900 - $920m to $810 - $840m and Non-GAAP 
EPS $3.00 - $3.10 to $2.60-$2.70/sh


Restructuring 6/28/05: Announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs and drive profits, 
due to “economic sluggishness particularly in the global retail market.” 
Expects to take a total pre-tax, charge of $75 - $95m associated w/cost 
saving initiatives, of which 2/3rds will be cash charges and the remaining 
1/3rd will be non-cash charges. Expects to record roughly half of the total 
pre-tax charges in the Q2’2005, with the rest in the next two quarters


7/29/14: Announced a restructuring “to strategically reallocate our resources to our 
highest growth, highest margin opportunities.” Expects to incur a pre-tax charge in the 
range of ~$150 - $200m that will be included in income from operations, with ~$150m 
recorded in 2014 and the remainder in 2015. The estimate includes both severance and 
asset related charges. The cash impact of the restructuring is expected to be ~$50m in 
2014 and $50m in 2015. Annualized savings are expected to reach ~$90m by 2016.

John Bruno,  Peter Leav, Andrea Ledford, Michael Bayer

Richard Bravman (fmr CEO), Adam Mallah (fmr Financial, Planning and Analysis ),

Nuti Stock 
Liquidations


12/30/05:  Nuti sold 400,000 shares for $6.6m his only substantive sale 
before a large guidance miss


Starts selling shares in Dec 2012 after acquiring Retalix and claiming “Retalix is a strong, 
strategic fit for NCR and the combination of our two companies will drive significant 
value for both our shareholders and customers.” Retalix would later prove a disaster

Debt / EBITDA Leverage


NCR is Much More Levered Than it Appears; Its Bankers Have Given It Dangerously Liberal Credit Terms


• According to NCR’s credit agreement filings, its bankers have given it generous terms by not adjusting its debt for unfunded pension 


liabilities, allowing it to net its debt against a $150m of its cash, yet allowing it to adjust for recent mark-to-market changes


• This appears problematic given that NCR’s states that $458m (approx. 90%) of its cash is held at foreign subsidiaries, and subject to 


additional U.S. and foreign tax withholdings, which could be significant. Also how can its bankers allow for pension adjustments to 


EBITDA without acknowledging its unfunded pension debt? 


• Moody’s, a leading credit agency, calculates that NCR’s actual leverage is closer to 5.3x at 9/30/14 and accurately adjusts the 


leverage for the unfunded pension obligations and NCR’s other contractually committed obligations   


Note: Bank Credit gives NCR a debt reduction for $150m in cash

Moody’s Ba2 / Negative Outlook S&P BB+ / Stable  


“The negative outlook reflects our concerns about NCR’s 


increased debt to fund acquisitions and to manage its 


pension liabilities, and the company’s ability to rapidly 


delever to levels commensurate with the Ba2 rating. In 


addition to increased financial risk, the company is 


continuing to integrate companies it bought over the past 


two years. Part of the integration challenge is to attain 


revenue gains to generate the incremental profits and 


cash flow, rather than the more directly controllable cost 


reductions” 


“We view NCR’s financial risk profile as “significant, 


reflecting its increased leverage following the series of 


debt-financed acquisitions. Following the Digital Insights 


merger, leverage rose to 4.6x as of March 31, 2014 


from the year-end 2013 level of 4.1x” 


As a junk credit, NCR has limited financial flexibility and the rating agencies would take a harsh view of a 


dividend initiation or a share repurchase. Their expectation is that NCR will apply excess operating cash to 


delever the balance sheet. Moody's, which accurately reflects for pensions, capital leases and other 


obligations sees NCR's Debt / EBITDA in excess of 5x while S&P sees it closer to 4x. However, Moody's 


has a negative outlook, which means it is at higher risk of downgrading NCR. This would increase its cost 


of capital and likelihood of default

Globes Israel Reports on Retalix....


NCR unit Retalix firing 100-150 in Ra'anana


July 23, 2014


The layoffs are reportedly due to the cancellation of the deal with 


Target.  Retail software service provider Retalix Ltd. has begun 


mass layoffs with 100-150 employees expected to be fired at its 


Ra’anana office. NCR unit Retalix employs 1,000 workers. The 


layoffs are probably due to the cancellation of the Retalix deal 


with US retailer Target, which was not satisfied with the 


company’s product, which it had installed in its Canadian office.


Retalix CEO Shuky Sheffer steps down


October 1, 2013


Sheffer will be succeeded by Eli Rosner, who has worked for 


NCR for several years.  NCR Corporation (NYSE: NCR) 


completed its acquisition of retail software solutions developer 


Retalix for $800 million seven months ago. Sources inform 


''Globes'' that Retalix CEO Shuki Shefer and CFO Sarit Sagiv 


left the company on Sunday. Sheffer will be succeeded by Eli 


Rosner, who has worked for NCR for several years.

Warning: NCR Stands Little Chance Against 
Oracle + MICROS in the Hospitality Space


4545


• In June 2014, Oracle announced it would acquire MICROS Systems (Nasdaq: MCRS), an integrated software and hardware solutions 


provider in the hospitality and retail industries for $68.00/share in cash, valuing MICROS at $4.6 billion, net of cash. MICROS reported 


$1.4 billion of sales and $182 million of net income for the fiscal year ended June 2014


• The combination is expected to allow MICROS clients to access the strength of Oracle’s business applications, technologies and cloud 


portfolio to respond to rapidly evolving customer expectations, increase sales, and drive operational improvements with complete open 


and integrated 


• The Oracle / MICROS Deal is a Negative for NCR’s Radiant:  Simply put, Oracle provides MICROS additional technological, 


managerial and operational scale to pose a greater competitive threat to NCR’s Radiant. Oracle has a surplus of $11.5 billion of cash on 


its balance sheet and generates $15 billion of operating cash flow a year (On a standalone basis, MICROS had $0.6bn of cash and 


$195m of operating cash flow). NCR is now in a David v. Goliath scenario with a competitor that can subsidize lower pricing to acquire 


NCR’s market share. We suspect Radiant is already being impacted, and note that Kim Eaton, NCR’s SVP and General Manager of 


Hospitality resigned. Radiant’s former CEO, Andy Heyman, was reassigned to head up Financial Services

Warning: NCR’s Backlog Becoming 
More and More Meaningless!


51
Source: NCR conference calls


Quarter 
Ended


Backlog 
Comments


Analyst 
Question


NCR
Answer


Q1`’14 Backlog is up significantly, however, and rollout of large 
orders pushing revenue to the end of the year and into 2015.


Financial: Backlog continues to grow based on strong orders in 


Q1, especially in North America and branch transformation. And 


backlog is up 9% in overall financial entering Q2. In general, 


revenue will ramp higher in the back half of the year as we grow 


orders in Q2 and build backlog


So, Bill, you said last quarter as 1Q goes, my year 


goes. And I'm just thinking now that you have three 


more months of data and you've seen what's 


happening in Retail, do you feel that the guidance is 


now appropriately conservative going forward for the 


rest of the year


“Our backlog is up in both – by the way, the 


Retail backlog's up 16% or 17% year-on-year 


as well going into Q2.  But a number of those 


projects are going to roll out in Q4 and Q1 of 


2015. They've been pushed a bit by this 


refocus on data privacy a bit more than they 


have on some of the Hardware offerings that 


we have. But we feel good about that”


Q2’14 Backlog was up 17% entering Q3, due to significant growth in 
professional services and software solutions. Retail:  Orders 


were up 11% in the Q2, driven by both Europe and EMEA, and 


offset in part by challenges we're seeing in North America. Our 


backlog continues to be strong, up 32% (the rollout of large 


orders continues to push revenues to the end of the year and 


into 2015). Financial: We continue to see orders and backlog 


grow in Financial, especially in North America and branch 


transformation


“What visibility do you have into a very strong fourth 


quarter, from an NPOI perspective? I looked over the 


few years, it's not unprecedented to have 25%, 30% 


sequential growth, but it's still a pretty dramatic ramp. 


And how much of the risk is there in the Retail 


segment in particular, given that there's been some 


push-outs there, and I imagine another quarter could 


be pushed out quite easily”


“Our quarterly guidance now for Q3, Q4 has 


been analyzed in terms of what we


believe we'll convert from what is a record 


backlog. The backlog we have today is the 


biggest we've ever had in dollars, and one of 


the biggest in terms of year on year growth. 


The NCR total backlog is up 19% year on 


year, and that's a fairly sizable backlog. A 


good portion of that is Financial, up 17% yoy, 


the rest is Retail”


Q3’14 Financial: Healthy legacy backlog entering Q4. Retail: Backlog 
was up 9% but further delays in solution rollouts are causing 


longer revenue conversion times. Commenting on guidance 


issues: Order decline was higher than expected and the 


backlog flowed out more slowly. CFO Comment: It was also a 


good quarter for order and backlog growth which is a good 


indicator for our future growth


“Bill, first on your pipeline for 2015. Typically by this 


time of the year what visibility do you have in the 


pipeline for 2015? And has that been impacted 


because of the shift of the Retail segment?” 


“The pipeline right now for 2015 and it's 


really what we call the front log. The front


log is what's in your funnel, what's in your 


backlog, and what does your order outlook 


look like for Q4”


Q4’14 Excluding Digital Insight, orders were down 11%, and 
backlog was up 1% as a result of foreign currency fluctuations 


and challenges in certain countries like Russia and China. As 


the business continues to transform to more software and 


services, orders and backlog does not capture all of our revenue 


streams and therefore, are not the best predictor of future 


revenue.


You made an interesting point about the guidance in 


Retail in particular and that sell and bill, you're using 


a new formula. I know when the guidance was cut on 


the third quarter call, part of that was you felt the 


pipeline was -- the dynamics of the pipeline were 


changing. So are you using the same methodology 


for 2015 that you had used back in 3Q when you 


made the guidance reduction in Retail


“One of the most important metric today 


for us is really no longer backlog per se or 


orders per se. The reason that is, is 


because orders and backlog, the way 


we've described it to you in the past, does 


not include key portions of the business”

Pension Folly
NCR Doesn’t Want To Be Held Accountable 
for its Pension Strategy Decisions


5353


• NCR has been public about wanting to address its legacy pension issues. In April 2010, NCR announced the 1st phase of its 


strategy to substantially reduce future volatility in its US pension plan through a rebalancing of its asset allocation to a portfolio 


of entirely fixed income assets by the end of 2012. In July 2012, NCR announced its 2nd phase to materially reduce the size of 


its pension liability by contributing at least $500m to the US plan


• NCR terms its pension contributions as “discretionary” and wants Wall St, to evaluate its performance as if the 


pension issue is non-recurring


• We believe it is essential to evaluate management’s performance on the pension strategy since it is a 


fundamental and critical capital allocation decision

these objectives 


were achieved

Warning: Pension Accounting Change


5454


Significant Transactions


“Effective in the first quarter of 2013, we elected to change our accounting methodology for recognizing costs for all 


of our company-sponsored U.S. and international pension benefit plans. Under our new accounting methods, we will 


recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses upon remeasurement, which is 


at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year. These new accounting methods will result in changes in the 


fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses being recognized in expense faster than under 


our previous amortization method. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily net service cost, 


interest cost, and the expected return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension 


expense. While our previous policy of recognizing pension expense was acceptable, we believe that these new 


policies are preferable as they accelerate the recognition in our operating results of changes in the fair 


value of plan assets and actuarial gains and losses.”


Source: NCR 2013 10-K (here)


Why would NCR elect to make this change when it is 


relatively uncommon? We will illustrate that a majority of 


companies amortize actuarial gains and losses


NCR stated its objective was to reduce the difference 


between GAAP and Non-GAAP results. We will illustrate 


this accounting change has had the exact opposite effect

Phase I: NCR’s Strategy to Allocate 
100% to Fixed Income a Total Disaster


5555


• NCR Raised $600m of Senior Notes to fund its U.S. pension plan: in two tranches (Sept and Dec) at 5.0% in 2012 for 


what it calls a “discretionary” investment


• NCR Times the Worst Investment Trade Ever:  While NCR was completing its shift to fixed income, the stock market 


accelerated its gains post-QE2, leaving NCR’s US pension plan in the dust. The bottom right chart shows that the total stock 


market ETF has returned 51% (inclusive of dividends) while the total bond market has returned approximately 5%


• NCR Employees / Shareholders No Better Off:  NCR shareholders are stuck with $30m/yr in debt service (~$20m after-tax),  


while its US pension beneficiaries sacrificed substantial pension security and are still holders of an underfunded pension plan

Capital Allocation Strategy

• Tower Watson Research Supports View of NCR’s Pension Folly:  A recent global pension asset allocation study 


indicates that a majority of global plans have between 30 – 50% equity exposure, with U.S. corporates on the higher end of 


the scale near 44% 


• NCR’s Pension Expected Returns Have Fallen Dramatically: While research indicates that the average expected return 


on pension plan assets among 1000 US companies is holding steady in the 7% range, NCR’s expected returns have fallen 


significantly from 2010 – 2013; its U.S. plan’s expected returns have fallen from 7.5% to 3.8% or 370bps!

Phase II: NCR Will Eliminate Pension 
Contributions Obligations...Well Not Exactly!


5757


• As outlined in its Phase II investment strategy, one of NCR’s objectives was to eliminate its cash funding obligation after 2012


when it raised $600m of Senior Notes to reduce its pension liability


• However, as can be seen from the pension footnotes to its 10-K (Bottom right chart), NCR reported that its actual return on 


plan assets was a loss of $116 million in 2013 – in a year where just buying the S&P 500 returned 30%! 


• NCR claims in its press releases and quarterly presentations that its “discretionary” contributions were $600m, $204m, and 


$48m in 2012 - 2014, respectively. NCR does not discuss is how this breaks down between its US and Int’l pension plans


• We view the nomenclature of a “discretionary” pension payment as potentially misleading, and obfuscating its problems. NCR is


still contributing to its “overfunded” international pension plan, and seems to be labeling some as non-discretionary


• NCR would have a motivation for overstating its “discretionary” contribution to make its free cash flow appear higher!

Warning: NCR’s Has Horribly Misguided its 
Expected Pension Contributions


• Recall that NCR’s objectives was to eliminate its cash funding obligation after 2012: In reality NCR, has continued to 


contribute fresh capital to the pension every single year! 


• Evidence suggests that NCR has horrible forecasting ability: Each year in its Annual Report, NCR estimates its annual cash 


contributions for the coming year to its pension and other postretirement and post employment plans. Since 2012, NCR has 


cumulatively underestimated its contributions to its US and International pension plans by a staggering $722m


• Pay close attention to NCR’s international pension plan: In 2013 and 2014, NCR reported to investors that is international 


pension plans were overfunded by $159m and $219m, respectively. However, NCR still made a $69m pension contribution in 


2014! We have identified additional concerns with the int’l plans reported return on assets that will highlighted in the coming slides

E&Y Accounting Guidance (here)
PWC Accounting Guidance (here)


Towers Watson Survey (here)


• There is significant management judgment in actuarial assumptions: Actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and 


are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to NCR’s pension plans. These factors include assumptions about interest rates, 


expected investment return on plan assets, rate of increase in healthcare costs, total and involuntary turnover rates, and rates of future 


compensation increases. 


• Changes in assumptions and actual vs. expected differences cause actuarial gains/losses: According to E&Y, 


“US GAAP currently permits either immediate or deferred recognition of actuarial gains and losses in net income using a systematic 


approach that is consistently applied. Most US companies defer recognition, although a few companies have recently elected to accelerate 


recognition of actuarial gains and losses.” PWC also agrees that either method is permissible, but doesn’t opine on which method is more 


prevalent


• Foreign survey research indicates how rare NCR’s choice is: A 2013 study by Towers Watson of 90 Hong Kong companies with 


pension schemes shows that just 1% immediately recognize actuarial gains/losses through the P&L


Includes a special $15m special termination benefit,

NCR’s Actuarial Gain/Loss Recognition At 
Odds w/ Best Practices


6161


Company Method Recent Annual Report Disclosure


Chevron Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2014, for the company’s 
U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 


12 and 15 years, respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of 
employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 


percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets


Disney Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, 
a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net 


actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 10 years


Intel Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


We use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in 
excess of ten percent of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on 


a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are 
expected to receive benefits under the plans.


Exxon Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension 
expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and 


losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.


General 
Electric


Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


Operating earnings exclude non-operating pension costs/income such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets 
and non-cash amortization of actuarial gains and losses. 


United
Technologies


Record in AOCI and 
Amortize


Actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have 
not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of 


tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost


Source: SEC 10-K filings


We reviewed major non-financial companies in the DOW Industrial index, and found that each accounts for actuarial gains/losses in 


Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) – a balance sheet equity account, where over time gains and losses are amortized to 


the income statement. This research is consistent with the Towers Watson study and E&Y that a majority of corporates do not 


recognize actuarial gains/losses immediately to the income statement
Pension Settlement and Terminations 
Are Non-Operating Expenses 


6262Source: Bristol-Meyers 10-K (here)


• As we’ve pointed out, NCR is running termination costs and benefits through operating income, when we believe they 


should be accounted for as non-operating items


• We believe a good illustration of proper accounting is Bristol Meyers, which clearly includes pension curtailments, 


settlements and special termination benefits as other (income) expense

its pension obligation. As the table below illustrates, the Aon curve is 20-40bps higher than the Citigroup curve.

Phase III: NCR’s Pension Plan to Become 
More Opaque, Follow the Int’l Pension Plan


6565


• In Nov 2013, NCR announced its “Next Phase of Pension Transformation” and that it had entered into an agreement with the trustees of 


the NCR Pension Plan in the UK regarding entry into a pension insurance buy-out transaction for the UK plan


• The agreement was articulated to be part of NCR’s on-going pension transformation strategy to reduce its global liability and increase 


recurring free cash flow, and was entered in conjunction with a separate agreement between the UK pension plan trustees and Pension 


Insurance Corporation (PIC)


• The transaction aimed to secure over $1bn of benefits, through insurance contracts provided by PIC, for the ~5,400 members of the UK 


pension plan who are former or current employees of certain subsidiaries of NCR in the UK


• According to NCR, “As of December 31, 2014, the U.K. London pension plan was overfunded by approximately $420 million. The plan is 


expected to fully transfer to an insurer in 2015 or early 2016 resulting in approximately $420 million of pension expense in the period of 


settlement.”


• In Dec 2014, NCR announced further plans to implement an insurance annuity buy-out structure with Principal Life Insurance. The U.S. 


Plan purchased a single premium group annuity contract in order to secure ~$160 million of benefits for ~4,500 former employees or 


their related beneficiaries who commenced monthly pension benefits under the Plan before January 1, 1994


• This group annuity contract purchase is not expected to have a material impact on NCR’s financial results. Any impact of this purchase 


will be included in the year-end 2014 mark-to-market adjustment. NCR anticipates that the single premium group annuity contract will be 


issued by The Principal in 2015


Our Take on These Transactions


• Opaque and complex: As we will illustrate on the next slide, NCR has classified the entire insurance transfer as a Level 3 asset, 


enabling significant management subjectivity towards its valuation


• Expensive to implement:  According to Rob Haines, a CreditSights analyst, in a typical pension risk transfer, known as a buyout, a 


pension plan sponsor will pay an upfront premium to an insurer in exchange for a group annuity contract that covers an agreed upon 


portion of the sponsor's defined benefit plan payments to retirees. All associated assets and liabilities are transferred to the insurer. 


Sponsors typically pay a premium of 5% to 15% over the total liability. How will NCR account for this ~$220 - $440m fee, and what 


was the cost/benefit analysis used when evaluating this transaction?

• NCR regularly reports the composition of its pension plan assets in the footnotes of its 10-K, along with the “Actual return on plan assets.”  


• In the table below, we have listed the change in plan assets from 2013 to 2014, and have made aggressive return assumptions on 


average plan assets to attempt to reconcile its $433m of return on plan assets in 2014


• Insurance products account for >50% of total plan assets: Therefore, the return on the insurance annuity should be the driving force 


in determining NCR international pension’s return on plan assets


• We estimate the insurance annuity would have to return approximately 25% to produce a plan return of $433m: a return figure 


that defies our belief and ability to explain how

appears that NCR has been under-reserving for doubtful accounts. The Allowance / Gross 


Receivables ratio has steadily declined since 2011. On the next slide, we will illustrate that this defies 


belief because recent acquisitions have been accruing allowances between  4 – 9%.

NCR 2014 10-K Filing (here)


NCR appears to be inflating its operating cash flow by at least $96m, by not classifying its A/R securitization as a 


financing cash flow 


• NCR quietly issued an 8-K in Nov 2014 to establish a revolving U.S. trade receivables securitization facility that provides for 


up to $200 million in funding based on the availability of eligible receivables


• On Feb 20, 2015, NCR issued a press release announcing its 2014 results. NCR showed just $91m in short-term borrowings, 


up from just $85m at the end of Q3’14, suggesting that it was not dependent on increased short-term borrowing 


• NCR filed its 10-K on February 27, 2014 a week after announcing its results. The 10-K revealed that NCR revised its short-


term debt figure to $187m


• Note 6 (table below) reveals that its Trade A/R facility was drawn by $96m but that no short-term borrowings were recorded in 


the Statement of Cash Flows. This suggests that NCR is accounting for its A/R securitization as an operating cash flow

While NCR and other companies classify receivables financing programs as operating cash flows, the accurate way to view 


these items from a financial analysis perspective is to deduct it from operating cash flow


• IBM does an excellent job of clarifying for its investors the impact of its receivables financing programs on its operating cash flows


• This supports our view that NCR’s operating cash flows are overstated by at least $96m

Aggressive Accounting, Gain on Property Sale 
Benefiting SG&A...Are You Kidding Me?


76


NCR has repeatedly tried to pull a fast one on its shareholders by sneaking into its filings property 


gains as a reduction to SG&A. We believe this is highly aggressive and distorts the true picture of its 


continuing financial results. 


We believe it would be more 


appropriate to include this non-


operating gain through either of 


these two lines items and not as a 


reduction to SG&A expense
Source: NCR financials


NCR’s Discussion of SG&A Expenses, 2013 10-K (p. 30)


"After considering these items, selling, general and 
administrative expenses remained consistent as a 


percentage of revenue at 13.3%, primarily due to a $7 


million gain on the sale of an office property in 2013 


offset by investment in sales resources during 2013.”


2012 10-Q (p. 32)


“Selling, general and administrative expenses in the 


second quarter of 2012 also included $4 million of 


acquisition related integration costs, $5 million of 


acquisition related amortization of intangibles and a 


$5 million gain on the sale of a facility in Scotland.
Warning: Aggressive Management of 
Income Tax Valuation Allowance


77


One gimmick NCR management may be playing is to release its tax valuation allowance, which 


reduces its effective tax rate, and increases its GAAP earnings. Ironically, NCR cited changes to the 


pension plan for releasing the valuation allowance. 


These reversals are 17% and 26% of GAAP reported income tax expense; on a per share basis a $0.15c and $0.05c 


benefit; a highly material amount in our opinion. These reversals involve subjective decisions by management, and we 


believe are indicative of low quality earnings. At the bottom of its cash flow statement, NCR discloses it paid $32m, $70m 


and $75 cash taxes from 2012 – 2014. This amplifies our concerns that its effective tax rates may be materially understated

• On February 3, 2012, NCR entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Redbox pursuant to which NCR agreed to sell 


certain assets of its Entertainment Business, including, but not limited to, substantially all of NCR's DVD kiosks, certain 


retailer contracts, select DVD inventory and certain intellectual property for cash consideration of$100 million. The deal was 


completed in June 2012 and included total assets of $67m ($51 million of PP&E, $15m of inventory, and $1 million of 


intangible assets)


• NCR agreed to provide Redbox with certain short-term support services following the closing under a transition services 


agreement. The Agreement also contemplates that, for a period of 5 yrs following the closing, Redbox may procure certain 


hardware, software and services from NCR under a manufacturing and services agreement. If, at the end of the 5 yr period, 


Redbox and its affiliates have not procured hardware, software and services that have yielded $25 million in margin to NCR, 


Redbox will pay the difference to NCR.


• In relation to the accounting for the transaction, according to NCR:


“We determined that the cash inflows under the transition services agreement and the manufacturing and services 


agreement will not constitute significant continuing involvement with the operations of the Entertainment business after 


the sale. In addition, the ongoing cash inflows related to the Entertainment business under the manufacturing and 


services agreement are substantially unrelated to the business sold. Therefore, we have reclassified the operating 


results of the Entertainment business, for all historical periods, to income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 


in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.”

Outerwall CEO Scott Do Valerio resigns (here) 


NCR’s accounting explanation sounds absurd. First, they describe a 5-year agreement as “short-term.” 


Secondly, if the cash flows are unrelated to the asset sale, then what are they related to? Neither individual 


who executed the agreement - John Bruno (NCR) or Scott Di Valerio (Redbox/Outerwall) are employed at 


their respective companies. Scott Di Valerio resigned from Outerwall in Jan 2015 and its stock plummeted.

sale of the business to Redbox on February 6, 2012. NCR listed the resulting book value as $67m 


• It is reasonable to assume that in Q4 2011, NCR was already in discussions with Redbox about the selling price, prior to 


announcing the deal a month later 


• The quarterly results of the Entertainment Business indicate that the business was deteriorating, with revenues declining 


sequentially and operating losses increasing


• NCR would later report a gain on the sale of the business for $33m in Q2 2012 upon closing the deal on June 25, 2012. The

“In 2011, we sold a 49% voting equity interest in 


NCR Brasil - Indústria de Equipamentos para 


Automação S.A., a subsidiary of the Company 


(NCR Manaus) to Scopus Tecnologia Ltda. 


(Scopus) for a subscription price of 


approximately $43 million. In the event NCR 


Manaus does not meet a defined financial

NCR and Scopus form strategic alliance to invest in ATM manufacturing; Banco 


Bradesco signs agreement with a target for 30,000 ATMs – making NCR its preferred 


provider over the next five years and redefining the competitive landscape in Brazil


DULUTH, Ga. 


NCR Corp (NYSE: NCR) and Scopus Tecnologia Ltda, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco 


Bradesco SA, announced today the formation of a strategic alliance for the manufacturing and 


development of ATMs in Brazil that will see Scopus acquire a 49 percent equity stake in NCR 


Manaus, NCR’s Brazilian manufacturing and engineering operations. Concurrently, Banco 


Bradesco signed an agreement with a target for 30,000 ATMs over the next five years, making 


NCR its preferred ATM provider with an initial order for more than 6,000 ATMs from NCR 


Manaus. The agreement is subject to regulatory approval. Terms of the deal were not 


disclosed.


NCR’s sales, services and other employees will remain in a separate company and 


continue to deliver sales and services support to NCR’s broader customer base in 


Brazil. The agreements will enable NCR to leverage Scopus’ deep technology knowledge and 


geographical presence, improve manufacturing productivity and deliver innovative products 


more quickly to financial institutions across Brazil, the world’s fourth largest ATM market. 


According to Retail Banking Research, the ATM market in Brazil is expected to increase by 27 


percent by 2015.(1) The agreement from Banco Bradesco will accelerate NCR’s growth in 


Brazil and enhance the company’s position in the market.


“This is a bold, strategic, and transformative alliance that is perfectly aligned with our 


corporate strategy as it expands and strengthens our geographic presence and sales 


coverage,” said NCR Chairman and CEO Bill Nuti. “It underscores why we ultimately 


decided to open our manufacturing facility in Manaus back in 2009 – namely to respond to 


customer demand for local sourcing and be closer to a dynamic growing market. The alliance 


will enable NCR to leverage Scopus’ local market presence and deep customer expertise, 


while helping us improve our manufacturing productivity and time to market.

NCR Disclosures a “Tax” Issue in Brazil 


Concurrent with its Loss of Bradesco


• NCR has not fully disclosed to its investors in its SEC filings that 


Scopus has been replaced by IBM Brasil by Banco Bradesco


• NCR says, “We recognized $87 million, $124 million and $145 


million in revenue related to Bradesco for the years ended 


December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.” The 30% decline in 


revenues in 2014 may partially be explained by a 15% decline in 


the Brazilian Real, but not entirely by the FX move


• Is NCR making up a story about a tax assessment as a 


divergence for its problems with NCR Manus?


• Unless the partnership has come to conclusion, it is reasonable 


to assume that NCR Manus will not meet its financial 


performance goal during the five year period ending in 2016 


• Given that Scopus may elect to put its noncontrolling interest to 


NCR at current fair value, why has NCR not alerted investors that 


it may face an additional liability and cash requirement?

Numerous Potential Issues Arise


In June 2014, one of the Company’s Brazilian subsidiaries, NCR 


Manaus, was notified of a Brazilian federal tax assessment of R$168 


million, or approximately $63 million as of December 31, 2014, 


including penalties and interest regarding certain federal indirect taxes 


for 2010 through 2012. The assessment alleges improper importation 


of certain components into Brazil's free trade zone that would nullify 


related indirect tax incentives. We have not recorded an accrual for 


the assessment, as the Company believes it has a valid position 


regarding indirect taxes in Brazil and, as such, has filed an 


appeal. However, it is possible that the Company could be required to 


pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter, which could be 


material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The 


Company estimated the aggregate risk related to this matter to be 


zero to approximately $66 million as of December 31, 2014

As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included 


elsewhere herein, during the second quarter of 2002, we entered into an 


agreement with the owners of a Brazilian corporation that was a distributor 


of our products, whereby we created a majority-owned subsidiary of 


Symbol. In our previously reported financial statements, we recorded 


payments to two individuals aggregating approximately $5.3m as part 


of the purchase price. As a result of our investigation, we determined 


that we should have treated these payments as operating expenses.

12/30/03: Symbol Acknowledges Accounting Problems


During the Q2’2002, Symbol entered into an agreement with the owners of 


Seal Sistemas e Technologia Da Informacao Ltda. ("Seal"), a Brazilian corp 


which had operated as a distributor and integrator of Symbol’s products 


since 1987.  The agreement resulted in the termination of distribution rights 


for Seal and the creation of a majority owned subsidiary of Symbol that 


would serve as the Brazilian distributor and customer service entity 


("Symbol Brazil").  In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the 


owners of Seal acquired a 49% ownership interest in Symbol Brazil.


Terms of the agreement included payments to the minority shareholders that 


range from $9.55m to a total of $14.8m contingent upon the attainment of 


certain annual net revenue levels of Symbol Brazil. In the event that none of 


the specified revenue levels are attained, the minimum earnout payment is 


payable no later than March 31, 2009. With each earnout payment, we will 


obtain a portion of Symbol Brazil's shares owned by the minority 


shareholders such that we will ultimately own 100 percent of Symbol Brazil 


no later than 3/31/09. In order to consummate this business 


combination, the Company was also required to make payments 


aggregating $5.3m to two shareholders of Seal.  These amounts were 


also included in the purchase price of Symbol Brazil, resulting in a total 


purchase price (including the present value of the minimum future earnout 


payments) of $12.3m

workforce totaling over 70 associates in the Brazil subsidiary by the end of 2002.


"Establishing a subsidiary in Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, extends our 


regional capabilities, which is ideal for business partner growth in such a burgeoning IT 


market, and reinforces our commitment to global customer service and support," said 


Richard Bravman, president and chief operating officer, Symbol Technologies. 


"This subsidiary will bring a new level of operational efficiencies to our business 


partners and customers that only Symbol can provide as a global, ISO-certified 


organization."


"Brazil represents a significant opportunity for the Symbol brand and is key to our 


ongoing sales, marketing and customer service commitment in Latin America," said 


Hans Witt, vice president of Symbol's Latin American operations. "This move allows us 


to focus on achieving integrated and comprehensive sales coverage in the territory. 


Our infrastructure and experienced workforce provides operational efficiencies in

Warning:  Federal Case Against Symbol

83Source:  Symbol Technologies Federal Indictment (here)


References to Channel Stuffing in Brazil 


On or about March 23, 2001, 
the defendant FRANK 
BORGHESE was copied on an 
e-mail sent by a Symbol 
employee to Distributor #1 
which requested an order 
needed by Symbol “to get to 
the Latin America ONLY 
numbers for Brazil.” 


At the end of the first, second and third fiscal quarters of 2000, 
and at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2001, Symbol 
solicited and entered into channel stuffing transactions with a 
distributor located in South America (“Distributor #1"), in which 
Distributor #1 placed multi-million dollar orders for products 
that Symbol had in its inventory, even though Distributor #1 had 
no need for the products. Indeed, Symbol personnel instructed 
Distributor #1 as to which products Distributor #1 was to order. 
Moreover, instead of shipping the products to Distributor #1 in 
South America, Symbol merely stored the products in 
warehouses in New York (the “Warehoused Products”). Symbol 
and Distributor #1 agreed that Distributor #1 (i) had no 
obligation to pay for the Warehoused Products, and (ii) could 
“exchange” the Warehoused Products at no cost when it placed 
new orders for products it actually needed. Despite these terms, 
which were hidden from Symbol’s outside auditors, Symbol 
fraudulently recognized and reported over $16 million in 
revenue from these transactions which were represented to be 
legitimate purchases of Symbol products by Distributor #1.

NCR is currently trading at a 5% premium to the average Wall St. price target. This indicates the stock is fully

Analyst Investment Opinions of NCR 
Reflect a False Sense of Optimism


88


“NCR is a leading manufacturer of ATMs, self-service kiosks, 


POS devices, and business consumables to the financial, retail, 


travel, and gaming industries; it also operates a best-in-class 


service organization.”


“NCR continues to improve profitability on the back of mix shift 


to software, enabled by Radiant, Retalix, and Digital Insight 


acquisitions and organic investments to re-position the product 


portfolio.”


“We believe NCR can achieve low-single-digit organic revenue 


growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth going forward. 


However, we continue to believe that FCF  provides a more 


realistic view of profitability.”


“Branch transformation coupled with emerging markets growth 


should drive NCR’s financial services segment in FY15 /  FY16”


“We remain Neutral rated on NCR. While the stock has 


underperformed and expectations have normalized, we would 


wait for improvement in operational execution to be 


incrementally positive on the stock”


It appears that all of these devices are in secular decline and 


commoditized products. Even NCR’s would disagree that its 


service organization is best-in-class; management’s bonus 


payout linked to overall customer satisfaction has fallen below 


expectations in recent years


NCR’s improvement in profitability is greatly exaggerated by 


various accounting shenanigans that distort its true situation. 


Digging beneath the surface, its recent spree of acquisitions 


have given the temporary illusion of growth. We believe these 


acquisitions are showing signs of failure, and growth is 


beginning to stall


Neutral is generous, that’s analyst speak for Sell! With at 


least six senior executive departures across various 


business verticals, NCR’s business appears to be unraveling 


Analysts’ Investment Opinions on NCR Spruce Point’s Rebuttal


Low single digit organic growth is overly optimistic given 


secular declines in most of its end markets, and new 


competitive entrants gaining traction. We believe continued 


earnings declines, which started in 2014 are more realistic. We 


agree that FCF is critical to evaluating NCR, its DSO are 


soaring and its FCF has been overstated by not removing 


factored receivables and repeated pension contributions 


Branch transformation has taken longer than anticipated and 


is an opportunity based on a faulty premise since banks are 


shrinking branches. FX headwinds and emerging market 


sluggishness is denting the perceived opportunity

Spinning a Potentially Misleading Story About 
its Change in Free Cash Flow Definition


96Source:  Q4’2013 Earrings Transcript (here)


William Nuti, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, 


President and Chairman of Executive Committee


“And let me just say this to everyone on the line as 


well. It's important to make this point on cash flow. 


Both Bob and I are laser-focused on improving 


cash flow conversion as a percent of NPOI. And 


trust me, there's a lot of going on that will yield to 


great results over the next several years. Linearity 


of that cash flow, and oh, by the way, I just 


changed the bonus plan for every employee on 


a bonus plan at NCR this year. We have about 


5,000 people on a bonus plan at NCR. Everyone 


of them now gets paid on 2 components: NPOI 


and free cash flow. It's the first time we've done it, 


and it should yield better results, more education 


and greater focus in the long term.”


Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Research Division


“And then Bob, I'm just -- I'm still trying to figure out cash flow. And 


Bill, I think it's probably an excellent move to put people on a comp 


plan that relates to that and I'm big advocate of that. But Bob, I'm 


looking at how you've defined free cash flow in the past. In the 


third quarter, you looked at it as operating cash flow less PP&E, 


capitalized software. In this press release, you're now 


subtracting discretionary pension contributions and settlement. 


So I guess, I'm trying to figure out if you actually hit your cash 


flow forecast or not.”


Robert Fishman - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer 


and Senior Vice President of NCR


“Yes. No change, Matt. No change. We've always had the same 


definition. What we've done is we've always taken our free cash 


flow, the operating cash. We've excluded the -- I should say, we've 


taken the operating cash adjusted for CapEx and discontinued 


operations. We think that's very transparent and then when there's 


onetime pension contributions, we've normalized free cash flow that 


way. So that's consistent with how we've been doing it. The normal 


pension contributions are as outlined on Page 16. So $79 million in 


2013, $70 million in 2014, but that does exclude any onetime 


contributions that were made in '13.”

NCR Management’s Bonus Tied To A 
Flawed, Unjust Financial Metric

NCR’s “Core Financial Objective” Tied to “Adjusted Free Cash Flow”


NCR’s management has sold its shareholders that it should be rewarded bonuses under its Management Incentive Plan 


(MIP) on the flawed financial metric of “Adjusted Free Cash Flow,” which accounts for 40% of the bonus calculation. 


Fortunately, NCR’s dismal performance did not even meet the threshold level of $380m

Credit Rating Agency View of 
Discretionary Pension Contributions

Cash Flow


We try to identify catch-up contributions made to reduce unfunded 


obligations, which would artificially depress reported operating cash 


flows. We view these contributions as akin to debt amortization, 


which represents a financing, rather than an operating cash flow. 


Specifically, cash paid (plan contributions plus benefits paid directly to 


beneficiaries) exceeding the sum of current-period service and net 


interest costs (that is, interest cost net of actual or expected returns on 


plan assets) is added back to FFO on a tax-effected basis. We look at 


actual investment returns for the period and returns normalized for 


potentially nonrecurring, unusually high or low performance. 


Conversely, if the company is funding postretirement obligations at a 


level substantially below its net expense (service cost and net interest 


cost), we interpret this as a form of borrowing that artificially bolsters 


reported cash flow from operations. 


Moody’s Standard & Poor’s


Both of the major corporate credit ratings agencies agree that an excess pension contribution (aka “discretionary”) 


should be viewed as a financing cash flow and not as an operating cash flow
