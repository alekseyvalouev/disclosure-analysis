ImageWare Systems: -86% Downside, Strong Sell, Smart Money Eager
To Sell At $1.05
Sep. 9, 2014 3:18 PM ET57 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


IWSY “smart money” tried to sell their stock at $1.05 recently, but couldn’t find
buyers. IWSY now trades at ~2.5x this level and faces an enormous share supply
overhang.


IWSY’s related party debt is "curious," while IWSY Auditor cited for “audit
deficiencies” with even more worrying issues explained below.


It seems IWSY’s much touted partnerships, including Fujitisu, are apparently “non-
exclusive” arrangements.


IWSY management seems to have an interesting "pattern" of repeated failure and
egregious cash burn funded by 25%+ dilution annually, while personally collecting
millions of dollars in personal compensation.


IWSY shares are severely overvalued under even the most wildly optimistic
assumptions value IWSY at ~$0.32 per share. Near term -86% downside as long-
term bankruptcy seems likely.


I believe ImageWare Systems (OTCQB:IWSY) is one of the most impossible penny stock
stories I have ever seen. Despite over two decades of losses, cash burn, changing
company "stories" and management diluting shareholders at 25%+ per year (!), insiders
have collected millions and millions of dollars personally in compensation.


Despite a miniscule $5m of revenue in 2013 and nearly 20 years of cash burn, the hype
around IWSY has recently allowed the stock to rise to the historically unprecedented
valuation of $215m at $2.30 per share. Big press releases about "multi-modal biometrics"
and claimed contracts with big name partnerships have rocketed this previous OTC penny
stock to valuations essentially never seen before in 15+ years.

Now, with IWSY's auditor cited for multiple "audit deficiencies" and insiders having
scrambled (unsuccessfully) to sell their IWSY stock at $1.05, I believe the end for this
absurd story stock is near. Furthermore, short term traders should be very careful as I see
a high probability of a surprise secondary offering of 23%+ of stock outstanding being
announced, which could cause instant stock price declines and an overnight gap down.
This may be why IWSY stock price has already broken key technical levels and is
declining so heavily.


I believe the technology is clearly "second tier" with multiple large partners fizzling out
while many larger competitors offer seemingly superior technology. Explained below with
cited examples.


As reality sets in I expect IWSY to revert to its past valuation levels which, along with
multiple other metrics, value IWSY stock at $0.33 per share for -86% downside.
Eventually I expect IWSY will go bankrupt as shareholders throw in the towel with "enough
is enough" for management who offer brutal shareholder dilution while receiving millions in
compensation for commercial failure and decades of losses.


The Interesting 10+ Year "Pattern" of IWSY


If there is one thing I find disappointing in small cap stocks, it is management teams that
have the questionable "pattern" of repeated promises to shareholders that never seem to
quite come through. The second part of this "pattern" is when management teams issue
huge amounts of stock, inflicting painful dilution on trusting shareholders, while
management consistently collects large compensation packages.


I fear IWSY's current shareholders may not have gone back and examined the track
record of the people in charge over an extended period of time so I have attempted to do
this for you. IWSY CEO Jim Miller appears to me to have what may be the single worst
example of this "pattern" I have ever seen and I encourage you to read the chart below
and be cautious.


This is not exhaustive by any means but my chart demonstrates over 25 striking examples
of what I view as clearly "over promise, under deliver" from IWSY while management has
been highly paid. Do you think this pattern is a coincidence? What does this pattern say
about management to you?

But IWSY's Top 3 Executives Have Collected Nearly $13m?


While IWSY shareholders get a -$132m retained earnings balance, let's take a look at
IWSY management's compensation:

The numbers speak for themselves. Despite repeated failure, the top 3 insiders at IWSY
alone have collected nearly $13 million in direct, total compensation over a period when
IWSY built a retained earnings deficit of -$132 million. I recommend you read that last
sentence again.


So how has IWSY funded this egregious management compensation and over a decade
of cash burn?


IWSY: "Brace Yourselves. Dilution is Coming"


Since going public in 1999, IWSY has turned its initial share count of 1.8 million shares
into a whopping 93.2 million shares (not a typo), a staggering 52x increase. According to
CapIQ data, IWSY's 5-year fully diluted share count compound annual growth rate of
shares outstanding (i.e.: dilution) is 32% (that's per year) and its 10-year CAGR is 25%. To
put this in perspective, I estimate anyone who bought into the IPO when there were 1.8
million shares would now own just 1.9% of their original undiluted investment. Ouch.


I challenge you to find any company with a similar market cap that has diluted its original
shareholders this aggressively and for so long.


IWSY's Dilution Addiction

What has IWSY done with the proceeds from all of this dilution? Not much from what I can
tell. Over the last decade, I estimate IWSY has produced $75 million of revenue but over
$80 million of net losses. Over its lifetime, IWSY has a retained earnings balance of
negative $132 million.


The dilution accelerated dramatically in 2011 when, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy,
IWSY executed a horrendously dilutive PIPE - IWSY's share count increased an estimated
23.8 million shares in 2010 to 68.0 million shares in 2011, a staggering 185% increase in
just one year.


(chart built by me with SEC filings)


How did that happen?


With revenue declining and losses mounting during the financial crisis in 2008, IWSY
seems to have found itself in a cash crunch, ending the year with an estimated $171,000
(that's thousands, not millions) of dollars on its balance sheet. Management took the
company "down to the nub," and IWSY exited 2008 with a $3.1 million market cap and a
$3 million EV. Importantly, note that not a single strategic acquirer we know of made a
public bid for IWSY during this time.


Quoting the transaction detail from CapIQ:


"On December 20, 2011, ImageWare Systems Inc. closed the transaction. The
company has raised $10,000,000 by issuing 20,000,000 common shares to a group
of institutional and qualified individual investors. In total, the company issued
warrants to the purchasers and the placement agent to acquire up to 11,555,000
shares in the aggregate. The company paid $652,500 as commission and $15,662
in expenses to MDB Capital Group, LLC. The transaction also saw participation
from Revelation Special Situations Fund Ltd, a fund managed by Revelation
Capital Management Ltd and existing investor Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. a fund
managed by Iroquois Capital Management L.L.C."

Yowza! that's 31,555,000 shares created on a prior base of ~23,800,000 shares - more
than 100% dilution. Apparently, the only way the PIPE investors were interested in
investing in IWSY was on loan shark terms. It's also worth pointing out that MDB Capital
also supported another IP story stock, Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL), before that
company's SEC investigation and stock price implosion.


IWSY "Smart Money" Try (fail) to Sell Their Stock at $1.05, Creating Enormous
Stock Overhang


If some of the largest and well informed IWSY shareholders (the "Smart Money") attempt,
and fail, to sell their stock at $1.05 what does that say if the current stock price valuation is
$2.30?


Even if you think IWSY's management are impressive and IWSY's technology is the best
in the world, there is huge stock price risk here from smart money investors who have
communicated they want out of this stock, and at prices more than 50% below where the
stock is today.


In what can only be described as a comedy of errors, on February 10th, 2012, IWSY filed
an S-1 outlining a plan by selling stockholders to liquidate a stunning 59 million shares,
approximately 86% of the total share count at the time, per CapIQ data. From what I can
tell, the money from these sales was to go to current shareholders looking to sell (not to
the company) amounting to a virtual cashing out of almost the entire shareholder base.
This filing was also seemingly intended to allow large shareholders to exercise the
warrants they received as part of the 2011 PIPE deal and sell those to any buyer they
could find.


Notable sellers were several of the PIPE participants and largest shareholders including
Bruce Toll (of Toll Brothers), Goldman Capital Management (Neal Goldman, not Goldman
Sachs), Gruber & McBaine International, Iroquois Master Fund, and MDB Capital Group,
IWSY's PIPE underwriter, among others.


Unfortunately for IWSY, and despite the stock price much lower than today's price, the
offering fell flat on its face. To start with, the SEC objected to the size of the offering in
April 2012, stating:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2482345-imageware-systems-minus-86-percent-downside-strong-sell-smart-money-eager-to-sell-at-1_05 8/36


"Given the size of the secondary offering relative to the number of shares presently
outstanding as well as the nature of the offering and identity of the selling
shareholders, it is unclear whether the transaction should be viewed as a secondary
offering eligible to be made on a shelf basis under Rule 415(a)(1)(NYSE:I) or a
primary, at-the-market offering being made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(4) with the
selling shareholders acting as a conduit in a distribution to the public. Given the
relationship of the selling shareholders to the company, tell us why the offering
should not be viewed as an indirect, primary transaction and why the selling
shareholders should not be viewed as underwriters."


My plain English interpretation of the SEC's response:


"Hold up dudes, you are trying to sell so much stock here that this isn't a secondary, you
are basically re-IPOing almost the entire company. That's like, so not cool, man…"


(graphic credit to Academy Award Winning "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure")


IWSY and the investors apparently responded by reducing the size of the offering by 25%
to a "mere" 44.1m shares to try and register the stock sale as a secondary.

"In response to the Staff's comment, we have reduced the total number of shares of
common stock proposed to be registered from 58,985,584 shares to 44,140,614
shares, a reduction of over 25%. We believe that the proposed offering by the
remaining Selling Stockholders, as reduced, should be properly regarded as a
secondary offering notwithstanding the total number of shares being offered, and
that the Selling Stockholders are not, nor should they be deemed to be, statutory
underwriters selling on behalf of the Company in respect of such offering."


In other words, shareholders who wanted to sell could now only sell 64% of the shares
outstanding, not 86% -- and many of the shareholders listed above filed to sell substantial
portions, and in some cases, their entire holdings, into the offering. This was hardly a vote
of confidence in the future prospects of IWSY by well informed shareholders.
Unfortunately, though, it gets much worse…


The SEC further objected to IWSY's vague language around "selling at prevailing market
prices," thereby forcing IWSY to amend its S-1 to include a specific offering price. IWSY
made this revision and indicated shareholders were willing to sell a large portion of the
company for $1.05. This disclosure was unleashed on the market in mid-2012 and
immediately caused shares of IWSY to tank below $1.05, down from a recent high of
$1.30. Shares ultimately bottomed at $0.77 as the market apparently said, "No, thank you"
to the enormous offering.


With the market rejecting this huge glut of shares, the selling shareholders now seem to
be effectively trapped in an illiquid, money losing business with apparently dim prospects
(I can only assume that given the wide breadth of attempted selling and past history of
failure, which I outline). This created a busted PIPE scenario in which PIPE investors were
unable to flip the stock - it simply wasn't liquid enough to support the desired liquidation by
insiders and, judging by the failed secondary, it seems no buyers for their stock could be
found at $1.05. This is what is commonly known as an "epic fail."


Still, despite IWSY's low liquidity, several of the PIPE investors have done their best to get
out anyway. Iroquois Capital, which had one of the smallest ownership positions, sold its
shares in the March 2013 quarter, per CapIQ data. Gruber & McBaine, a long time
investor in the PIPE market, may have also completely exited their position as the firm
was not listed in IWSY's most recent proxy. As recently as late 2012, Gruber & McBaine
owned 10.2 million shares, per CapIQ data. Bruce Toll recently cut his position by ~60%
from his March 2014 ownership of 7.8 million shares. Do you really want to bet against
this guy?

In fact, it looks like these investors have been trying to get out for some time:


MDB Capital (IWSY's underwriter and holder of IWSY warrants) "coincidentally" issued
a wildly bullish initiation report on June 2012 (MDB was listed as hoping to exercise all
of its warrants and sell its IWSY stock in the offering just prior to this report).
Revelation Capital, which was recently engaged by the SEC for alleged PIPE-related
market manipulation, was one of the registrants to sell via secondary. Revelation
seemingly wanted to sell its entire stake. According to CapIQ data, Revelation has
since sold approximately half the 5.2 million shares it listed in the offering, now holding
roughly 2.6 million.


Risk of IWSY Secondary Announced Any Moment: What Happens If 20m+ Shares
Hit an Illiquid Stock?


Recent actions by what I view as low quality brokers indicate to me there could be an
IWSY secondary announced any moment. Given the last secondary failed at $1.05 I
would expect any secondary announced to be done at a steep discount to the current
stock price of $2.40.


Craig Hallum analyst Mike Malouf picked up coverage in August, 2013. Malouf is the
same analyst that covers Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON), and Craig Hallum was the equity
underwriter on a NEON deal where insiders sold via a secondary - the stock is now down
60% from that offering roughly a year ago. According to CapIQ data, Craig Hallum earned
almost a million dollars of fees on the deal. IWSY's registration statement seems to me to
be still live with a post-effective amendment, this time trying to sell ~27 million shares.


Interestingly, according to CapIQ data, Craig Hallum recently reduced their out year
revenue estimates for IWSY by 19% - even the company's cheer leader is apparently not
as bullish as it was.


Lake Street also recently initiated coverage on IWSY with wildly bullish assumptions. I
interpret these brokers' coverage as an indication that an offering could be in the works
imminently and I warn even short term traders to be very careful here. If or when this
secondary gets announced I would expect an enormous, and unavoidable, overnight gap
down in IWSY stock that is typical of what happens to illiquid stocks when large secondary
offerings are announced.

IWSY and the PIPE Investor's Conundrum


IWSY ended the June quarter with just $1.4 million of net cash on its balance sheet,
barely enough to fund even one quarter of historic cash burn (IWSY burned ~$2 million
per quarter in each of the prior 3 quarters).


IWSY needs cash and I believe it needs it now. Unfortunately, it's now not so easy as
doing another PIPE or a secondary to raise capital for the company. Several of the 2011
PIPE investors remain trapped in the stock and will not take kindly to the type of obscene
dilution IWSY has executed in the past. Many of these shareholders attempted to sell at
$1.05 and would likely be thrilled to sell at $2.50. However, any cash going to the PIPE
shareholders won't go to IWSY, and therein lies the conflict.


Meanwhile, it's essentially impossible for the PIPE shareholders to sell in the market - the
amount of IWSY stock supply could create an avalanche that would wipe IWSY's stock
price out, possibly creating a "death spiral" making any capital IWSY would try to raise
increasingly dilutive and painful.


Can you really afford to be on the other side of very smart money looking to sell? Some of
these sellers have been in the stock for years and presumably collaborated closely with
management in the 2011 capital raise - and even with that knowledge and experience,
some were willing to sell in their stock size at $1.05.


IWSY's Curious Related Party, Convertible Debt = More Dilution


IWSY has recently been burning cash and appears to be planning on relying on a dilutive
convertible debt note executed with a related party that I find very curious. If IWSY had
access to the capital markets why use this very expensive convertible note that costs 8%
interest and has the ability to convert into IWSY stock at barely 40% of the current trading
price?
5/22/2018 ImageWare Systems: -86% Downside, Strong Sell, Smart Money Eager To Sell At $1.05 - ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCMKTS:IWSY) |…

From Q2 2014 IWSY conference call:


"Based upon both current and projected cash levels, our anticipated new contracts
as well as the line of credit, we do not expect to require any incremental equity
capital to fund our current operations at this time"


I fear, given the language IWSY has used, that perhaps IWSY shareholders are
interpreting this to mean that they no longer need to fear IWSY's historically punishing
dilution. Nothing could be further from the truth as this convertible note, done with a
related party, appears to offer generous terms that are also quite dilutive to shareholders
while potentially adding a supply of stock that could be sold into the market and drive
IWSY stock price down.


Specifically, from the 10-K:


"In March 2013, the Company entered into a new unsecured line of credit agreement
with initial available borrowing of up to $2.5 million. The credit line was extended by
an existing shareholder and member of our Board of Directors. Borrowings under the
credit facility bear interest of 8% per annum and are due in March 2015. Before
entering into the Amendment (defined below), at any time prior to the Maturity Date,
the holder had the right to convert the outstanding balance owed into shares of the
Company's common stock by dividing the outstanding balance by $0.95."


"In March 2014, the holder of the line of credit agreed to increase the borrowing
facility to an aggregate total of $3,500,000 (the "Amendment"). Borrowings under the
increased credit facility will bear interest at the same rate and are also due in March
2015. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amendment, the Holder has the
right to convert up to $2.5 million of the outstanding balance into shares of the
Company's common stock for $0.95 per share. Any remaining outstanding balance
will be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock for $2.25 per share.
As consideration for the increase to the line of credit borrowing facility, the
Company issued to the holder a warrant exercisable for 177,778 shares of the
Company's common stock. The warrant expires on March 27, 2015 and has an
exercise price of $2.25 per share."


That's a fancy way of saying that the pre-amendment note could be converted into shares
with a cost basis of $0.95. At the time of issuance, the stock was selling for ~$2.00 per
share, effectively doubling the value of the line of credit upon conversion, and resulting in

more dilution - in fact, IWSY's share count has increased every quarter for at least the last
16 quarters in a row, per CapIQ data.


It's telling that IWSY did this note with one of its largest shareholders (the related party
here, Neal Goldman of Goldman Capital, which owns roughly 1/3rd of the stock) - the
company has never generated significant earnings or free cash flow, and it hasn't been
able to successfully execute a secondary. Based on the failed secondary mentioned
above, Goldman Capital is trapped in the stock. I expect IWSY to continue to skate by for
a while on dilutive related party transactions, but this is small comfort for shareholders as
they get stuck with the bill and additional wealth is transferred to related parties at the
expense of other shareholders.


What I would like to note about this convertible debt is that not only does it pay 8% interest
but also converts into IWSY stock at $0.95 per share, extremely generous terms.

IWSY's Auditor: "Audit Deficiencies" and Even More Worrying Issues


Despite claims to be a "leadership" company (whatever that means) IWSY's choice of
auditor seems curious to me as their auditor's history is littered with ties to alleged
fraudulent situations and "audit deficiencies."
5/22/2018 ImageWare Systems: -86% Downside, Strong Sell, Smart Money Eager To Sell At $1.05 - ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCMKTS:IWSY) |…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2482345-imageware-systems-minus-86-percent-downside-strong-sell-smart-money-eager-to-sell-at-1_05 14/36


IWSY's current auditor is Mayer Hoffman McCann who was recently fined $300k plus
$50k in investigation costs with 2 years of probation for auditing CA city of Bell where
officials have been accused of fraud and public corruption. It also looks like Mayer
Hoffman McCann audited the remarkable city of Compton, California. Mayer Hoffman
apparently resigned from that account after allegations involving fraud arose.


As if that isn't bad enough, when inspected by the PCAOB (the organization responsible
for governing audit firms) in 2011, the PCAOB found what appear to be multiple "audit
deficiencies" at Mayer Hoffman relating to GAAP accounting.


"The inspection team identified what it considered to be audit deficiencies. Those
deficiencies included failures by the Firm to identify or appropriately address errors
in the issuer's application of GAAP, including, in some cases, errors that appeared
likely to be material to the issuer's financial statements. In addition, the deficiencies
included failures by the Firm to perform, or to perform sufficiently, certain necessary
audit procedures."


Perhaps not surprisingly, this 2011 investigation appears to have followed a 2008
inspection that ALSO found "audit deficiencies."


Ironically, it appears in 2013 that Mayer Hoffman filed a letter with PCAOB disagreeing
with new rules providing investors with increased transparency related to auditors.


If IWSY wants to portray itself as a credible company why have they chosen to use this
audit firm with such a questionable background? What does this say about IWSY? If this is
the firm shareholders are relying on for protection and reliable financial statements I would
encourage caution.


Biometrics and Security Industry Appears to Have Grown Over The Past 5 Years

If you believe IWSY has the best technology available why do you believe the company's
revenue has shrunk so dramatically during a time the industry presumably has grown
rapidly?


Furthermore, it's common sense that no major customer is going to sign a material
agreement with a company apparently teetering on the edge of bankruptcy - IWSY is out
of cash and the whole world can see that in a few clicks to the SEC website for a look at
IWSY's recent 10-Q. In my view, this could be one of the major reasons the proposed
retail agreement was press released as an agreement "in principle" - what does that even
mean?


IWSY Famed "Relationships" With IBM, Fujitsu and T-systems: We've Been Down
This Road Before…


IWSY stated they had relationships with IBM (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ)
and Unisys (NYSE:UIS) as far back as 2005 in executive interviews[2]. This does not
seem to have done IWSY shareholders much good with IWSY stock now down -48% from
the 2004 high and revenue also declining -43% from 2005.


(chart from CapIQ)


In 2006, IWSY claimed partnerships with IBM, GE and Unisys. In fact GE announced in
11/2006 that it will use the IWSY engine and software suite. However, GE is apparently no
longer promoted as a partner and are not mentioned in IWSY's 10-K while large revenue
from this announced partnership appears to have never become material. Did GE drop
IWSY as a partner? If so, why?


In 7/2006 Unisys also jointly landed a $1.3m contract with IWSY and yet that partnership
also appears to have not lived up to IWSY investor expectations given the stock price.


In 3/2006 Raytheon also paid IWSY a tiny fee to license their technology, presumably to
analyze it to see if it was valuable. But now today, this relationship also seems to have
fizzled with Raytheon also not listed as an IWSY partner in their 10-K. If IWSY supposedly
has amazing technology, why did Raytheon apparently not pursue this further?

Why does IWSY have a history of announcing partners that ultimately seem to drop the
company or not generate material revenue?


IWSY Partnerships, Including Fujitsu, Apparently "Non Exclusive"?


"We are big believers in partnerships. Fujitsu was our first partner, these are non
exclusive arrangements…..T-systems which is a wholly owned sub of deutsche
telecom, followed most recently by IBM…"


-Jim Miller, CEO and Chairman IWSY recent discussion at ~14:00


I saw this quote from the latest IWSY management presentation and found it very curious
and concerning. I am not clear exactly what this means and I could not get anyone from
IWSY on the phone to answer my questions but if this means that Fujitsu, IBM, Unisys
and IWSY's other claimed "partners" are free to sell or resell products from companies
that compete with IWSY then I would view this as extremely negative for IWSY stock.


I believe IWSY needs to clarify in detail the exact extent and details of these relationships
or risk losing credibility with investors.


Many Security Companies Have Had "multi modal" Biometrics Capability for Nearly
10 Years Already


I fear some IWSY shareholders may believe that IWSY is one of the only companies in the
security space that has what IWSY likes to call "multi model" biometric offerings.


I can confidently tell you that there are many companies in the security industry that seem
to have multi model biometric capability. These companies have actually had this
capability as far back as 2005, which I believe actually puts them far ahead of any
capability IWSY claims.


Motorola, as far back as 2005, partnered with the CIA in a company called A4Vision that
offered world-class face recognition technology and MOT apparently planned to add that
to its own biometric and ID technology. A4Vision had also been shipping 3D biometric

products since 2003.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2482345-imageware-systems-minus-86-percent-downside-strong-sell-smart-money-eager-to-sell-at-1_05 18/36


MOT also licensed some of the best 3D fingerprint imaging technology in the world from a
private firm called LumenIQ. Even ignoring all the other products MOT has in this space,
they clearly had the capability to combine some of the best 3D finger print and palm print
technology along with 3D facial recognition as far back as 2005 with companies that had
been in the biometrics space for years prior.


The whole idea behind these investments was so that if customers desired, MOT could
offer in-house multi modal biometric capabilities. I can't find anything new or unique at all
about IWSY's products.


Furthermore, security industry analysts[3] stated that at the time MOT was not the only
company doing this multi modal biometrics as Idenix apparently also offered inhouse
multiple biometric capabilities.


Then in 4/11/2005 Precise Biometrics also announced a partnership incorporating security
Cognitec's face recognition software into their multi-biometric solutions designed for both
the government and commercial solutions.


My point is that there are global companies in this space offering multi modal biometrics
solutions as far back as 2005 and anyone claiming IWSY is truly unique in this regard is
confused or hasn't done their homework. I find any claims that IWSY invented multi modal
biometrics to be a stretch at best.


IWSY faces Competition from Both Established Global Companies and Innovative
Start-Ups


Unfortunately, for IWSY, who spends very little on R&D, risk comes not just from more
credible companies with more capital and deeper customer relationships but also from
innovative startups backed by some of the biggest companies in the world.


Large companies such as Sprint, Wells Fargo and Intel are backing startup
competitors, something I don't believe they would do if IWSY had a compelling offering
already on the market.
Large companies such as Barclays seem to me to prefer to tie up with large suppliers
such as Hitachi instead of IWSY.
IWSY is seemingly absent from an upcoming large biometrics conference, while major
competitors such as 3M will be in attendance (that's the same 3M that didn't buy IWSY
at $0.30 in 2010 and instead bought Cogent - more on that below).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2482345-imageware-systems-minus-86-percent-downside-strong-sell-smart-money-eager-to-sell-at-1_05 19/36


Even in the best case scenario, shares of IWSY are wildly overvalued. Let's quote Lou to
see just how overvalued IWSY is:


Best case, if the deal is with Wal-Mart, we're talking about an agreement worth up to $4.6
million in recurring revenue each year.


So IWSY trades for ~42x EV/t12msales or 24x ev/2015sales, if this deal even happens.
This is one of the highest valuations out of any technology company in the stock market.
The rest of IWSY's paltry revenue is of little concern and has actually been declining,
down 8% year-over-year in the most recent quarter according to CapIQ data.


We also know from numerous examples that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is notorious for
squeezing its partners and suppliers for every penny they're worth - and that this squeeze
is even worse for small companies. It is entirely possible that IWSY will actually continue
to lose money even if the company wins a revenue producing contract with Wal-Mart
because the margins from WMT are likely to be extremely low. As a reminder, IWSY
incurred an operating loss of $5.9 million over the last 4 quarters, an amount in excess of
the alleged WMT best case scenario revenue.


If we assume that IWSY actually wins the contract, and that the WMT contract will occur at
75% gross margins to IWSY (challenge for those of you playing at home: name even one
company that has a 75% gross margin selling into Wal-Mart), the company will still lose
money: 75% of $4.6 million is $3.6 million. If we're generous and assume no additional
operating expenses will be required to serve this contract, and that the entire $3.6 million
falls to the operating line, IWSY will still lose ~$2.3 million a year on an operating basis
(5.9-3.6). This is hardly an attractive dynamic for IWSY, and this is the "best case"
scenario.


It's telling that IWSY presented at the Gateway conference on Thursday and the stock got
crushed despite management's attempts to tell the story. I wasn't there, but I heard from
people in attendance that IWSY was unable to point to any reassuring details about the
supposed WMT contract and that the presentation was a flop overall. No wonder the stock
has gotten crushed.


IWSY Valuation: All Signs Point to -86% Or More Downside, Long-Term Bankruptcy
Likely


No matter how I look at IWSY, even making a serious effort to be impartial, I sincerely see
no scenario in which this ends well given where the stock is trading at today. Even the
most casual glance at IWSY's financials indicate that paying $240m+ for this "business" is

not a wise decision.


(chart built by me with SEC filings)


I spent a lot of time trying many different methods to arrive at an accurate valuation of
IWSY and using virtually any valuation metric indicates to me that IWSY is so absurdly
over valued and that the current valuation seems impossible to sustain.


Valuing IWSY Attempt #1: Historic Valuation Implies IWSY Stock Price of $0.307 Per
Share


Since 1998, even including the current incredible levels, IWSY has been valued at 5.72x
sales with most of that timeframe in a range of 1-3x sales. If I exclude the recent meteoric
rise in IWSY valuation, the 15 year average valuation has been 4x sales.


With the latest hype and stream of promotional press releases and questionable articles,
IWSY has become completely detached from reality and now trades for a "bubble-icious"
42x EV/sales! Even TSLA, founded and run by a modern genius with world changing
technology growing at an unbelievable rate, trades at "only" 17x EV/sales.

Taking IWSY's $5m in t12m revenue and applying a 5.72 valuation implies a fair value of
$0.307 per share.


Valuing IWSY Attempt #2: Comparison to Peer Companies Values IWSY Stock at
$0.0387 Per Share


Aware, Inc. (NASDAQ:AWRE) seems to me to be a better company in every single
category - it has over 4x as much revenue, is profitable on an operating basis, does not
have overpaid executives, has a well-capitalized balance sheet, and a valuation that is
downright cheap when compared to IWSY. Interestingly, AWRE's share count has actually
declined over time while IWSY's has skyrocketed. Despite this different, IWSY sells at
multiples of public competitor AWRE


Let's look at a comparable table of IWSY vs. AWRE


Source: CapIQ Data


If you insist on speculating on micro cap OTC biometrics stocks it seems to me that
AWRE is clearly the preferable stock to buy. Applying AWRE's 0.70x ev/sales valuation
multiple to IWSY's $5m in revenue implies IWSY stock price of $0.0387 per share.


IWSY Valuation Attempt #3: Recent Transaction Comparables Acquired By
Strategics implies $0.30-0.35 per share IWSY Stock Price


According to CapIQ transaction data, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bought Authentec for 5.0x
EV/LTM Sales. IWSY currently sells at 42x EV/Sales. If a strategic acquirer were to pay
the same price for IWSY as Apple paid for Authentec, the value per share for IWSY would

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2482345-imageware-systems-minus-86-percent-downside-strong-sell-smart-money-eager-to-sell-at-1_05 22/36


be approximately $0.30 per share. This number is based on $5.4 million of LTM sales x
5.0x EV/Sales = $27m EV + $1.4m net cash = $28.4m market cap. Dividing this by
IWSY's 93.2 million shares out (quick, better calculate it before more dilution happens!)
results in a buyout value of $0.30 per share.


Let's take a more generous example for the sake of discussion. According to CapIQ
transaction data, 3M (NYSE:MMM) purchased Cogent in 2010 for 5.7x EV/LTM Sales.
This translates to an IWSY buyout price of $0.35 - so even under the most optimistic of
scenarios, shares of IWSY are ~7x overvalued ($2.46/0.35). It seems very curious that
IWSY shares sold for a low of $0.30 per share in 2010 and yet 3M didn't purchase the
company, instead buying Cogent.


Even with generous assumptions about the buyout multiple and the alleged Wal-Mart
contract, you're looking at a buyout price at a tiny fraction of the current market price. Go
ahead and double or even triple the current level of revenue - IWSY stock is severely
overvalued any way you cut it. If you triple the level of revenue and apply the 5.7x
EV/Sales valuation that Cogent got, the stock is worth about $1.00 - which happens to be
just about exactly where insiders were trying to sell en masse in 2012.


Side Note: No strategic acquirer made any public offer to buy IWSY at much lower
prices so it seems clear to me that No buyout is coming


Speaking of which, Apple announced its purchase of Authentec on July 27, 2012 - around
the same time IWSY insiders were trying to sell and IWSY shares could have been
purchased for $0.84. It's nearly certain that Apple would have looked at IWSY as a
potential target -- after all, Apple is a huge company with a top flight M&A team and IWSY
is public, making the data readily available to anyone with an internet connection (Apple
has that). Authentec was also public, so Apple probably looked at both, and likely AWRE
as well. That's really all you need to know: Apple almost certainly looked at IWSY and
passed at 1/3rd the current stock price. If a deal had been offered, it's almost certain that
the 64% of shareholders trying to unload their stake would have accepted Apple's bid
(after all, 64% is a majority and they were trying to sell anyway). In fact, one wonders if
some of the large shareholders trying to sell may have even called Apple or other
strategics in an attempt to broker a deal after the secondary failed?


IWSY Valuation #4: "Smart Money" Tried to Sell at $1.05 Per Share


I think it is obvious that IWSY investors would likely not have wanted to sell their IWSY
stock at $1.05 if IWSY stock was undervalued at that price. Therefore it seems logical to
me that $1.05 is probably above fair value for IWSY stock. Even if we assume $1.05 is a

fair value, implying -56% downside.


Management Response:


I made a strong attempt to get in touch with the company before sharing my research but
was unable to get anyone to answer my questions. I called IWSY's IR firm more than 5
times and despite leaving contact info and speaking with multiple people expressing my
strong interest to speak with anyone there able to talk about IWSY, I was unable to get
any timely response. I also called the company directly but their IR extension goes directly
to a voicemail and I was unable to get through to anyone that way either. I look forward to
management answering the many questions raised here as well as providing investors
with direct, quantified, benefits of their product claims versus other competing products so
investors can evaluate management claims.

Comments (57)


With a solid understanding of what IWSY is, what their executives do, and what IWSY
stock is worth under a very generous scenario, my research indicates near term fair value
of ~$0.30 per share for -86% downside. Given over 10+ years of cash burn and rapidly
evolving biometrics market with IWSY's minimal R&D spending, longer term I expect
IWSY shareholders will eventually refuse to fund egregious executive compensation and
IWSY will go bankrupt.


We've seen a lot of recent articles discussing the Fed's impact on the market and how
investors are being "forced" into risk assets. IWSY is just about the riskiest investment I
can think of - in my view, IWSY is a FED bubble stock that is likely to do badly in any
future market environment.


This is a warning to all current and potential IWSY bag holders - hold this stock at your
own risk. I believe shares of IWSY are likely to ultimately end up worthless, but even in a
very generous best case scenario, I believe the research clearly shows this stock is worth
no more than $0.35 per share. Under virtually any outcome I expect IWSY stock to trade
down sharply over time but if the broad market should pull back then I believe stocks like
IWSY will get hit twice as hard. Invest carefully.

And if anyone is wondering why Lake Street picked up coverage with such a bullish view and insanely high pipe-

"Lake Street Capital Markets, or its affiliates, intends to seek or expects to receive compensation for INVESTMENT

Buying ahead of a deal is not recommended. If they can even get the deal done (Craig Hallum couldn't), it will be
priced at a massive discount with warrant coverage.

was a return of their capital because they bought most of there shares in a underhanded way. The AWRE BOD
stepped away from their poison pill and allowed the Stafford family, Ronin Capital and Kimborama LLC ( J YANG-

or projections for income each year and is the most closed public company I have ever seen in my life to be a public
company is a better value?  
You must be one of those who wonder why IWSY has gotten More Biometrics Press then AWRE in 2014 and has
absolutely something they can show "investors" for their efforts.. 
What has Awre shows you in Biometrics in 2014? What have they announced?  
All they say is we have defense contracts with FBI NIST from some standard in fingerprints from the 2001 Iraq war
extended into Afghanistan with some handheld device that may or may not be use by the State Dept and other
agencies overseas.. but they have Declining revenues at AWRE not increasing ones and with no conference calls
scheduled and returning capital to investors.. AWRE looks like a company with Majority holders may go Private. Not
Public

"ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: IWSY) (ImageWare), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric
identity management solutions, has signed a three-year agreement with a major international retailer to provide its
cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management product suite running on the Fujitsu Trusted S5 Cloud
platform.


Under the agreement, ImageWare's IWS CloudID® product suite will use face, finger, iris and voice authentication;
and run on top of the Fujitsu Trusted Cloud S5 platform, a fully configured, on-demand IT infrastructure, over the
internet. The initial implementation will begin in the retailer's Mexico City locations in September, led by ImageWare's
local subsidiary, ImageWare Systems de Mexico.


The biometric products will be licensed on a service-fee model, generating revenue from an initial license fee per
person and a recurring monthly license fee thereafter. The company expects to begin generating revenues in the third
quarter of 2014.


"Organizations face heavy burdens related to the creation and maintenance of digital identities, data accuracy and
lack of integration across credentialing, human resources, and physical and logical access control," said Jim Miller,
ImageWare's Chairman and CEO. "The IWS CloudID product -- which runs on top of the Fujitsu Trusted Cloud S5
platform and is delivered via Fujitsu's global network of secure data centers -- offers a cloud-based approach to all of
these identity management concerns on a pay-as-you-go basis. We believe this agreement validates the steps we
have taken to advance our cloud, SaaS and mobile offerings in the commercial and consumer marketplace."


Lots of companies turn around...I get it you lost on this company in the past..many people have lost on IPOs, in the
middle and at the end of stocks. Take CLWR for example...many people bought this stock at $27 a share on IPO.
Years later i paid under $2 a share. I told everyone on these forums that it was worth at least $8 not many listened
and people dicarding my analysis like the two above. I sold 24,000 shares at $3.30 and then more at $5.20 or so. My

Please read the direct copy and paste from MSN article.


"ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: IWSY) (ImageWare), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric

These are real deals not fictituous ones. IWSY has signed contracts with 3 companies in the last few weeks. I
understand that you TPS may have lost money in this stock or a similar one (I hardly doubt it) in the past, many
people do. Plenty of people loose money in IPOs, during the time when holding a stock, and even at the end when it
dissolves or gets bought out. Remember CLWR, people who bought in that IPO paid $27 a share, I bought it 4 years
later for under $2 a share. I kept telling people that CLWR was worth $8 a share, but no one listened in any of the
forums. I sold 24,000 shares of CLWR for $3.30 and $5.20.


Conclusion: My point is that many companies turn themselves around. This company seems to be getting it stuff
together finally. So whether it was a horrible ran company 1 year ago really has no bearing on what its potential is
today. TPS can quote all he wants from the past and he can also short IWSY like he is doing now....that is his choice,
I am just saying make yours based off your own due diligence not someone called The Pump Stopper. Unless you
think the pump stopper is smarter than the three multi-million dollar companies that just paid IWSY for their product

Yes, IWS has used offerings to continue to keep the lights on, and it has diluted those long term holders. The
last PIPE was down to take out all debt and put them in a position to have a better position when they
negotiated with potential customers (and my speculation convince Fujitsu and T Systems they could keep the
lights into 9 plus months if they partnered).


Goldman who owns 1/3 of the stock is less likely to allow dilution unless it is to allow the company to trade on
a major exchange which mgmt has said they are looking to do within next 6 months. That allows Goldman to

They've been burning $2M per quarter for the past few quarters, or about $660K per month. They had $1.4M as at
June 30 so they should be at about cash zero now (give or take). So either dip into the expensive financing line at a
50% discount to market pricing or a financing is imminent.


In the past 18 years I've seen a ton of biometrics companies come and go. It's always the next "big thing".


IMHO 35x revenue is a huge valuation for this thing.

They exercise the unsecured loan for $3.5M (which was made at a warrant strike price that was close to the market
trading stock value btw at the time) Goldman and the other board member have offered and this gets them into early
next year. They should be recognizing the LAX airport deal for $1M and have additional revenue from maintenance
coming in this coming qtr. It's not a lot but it may be enough time to get the other contract Fujitsu and T System's have
coming online next qtr.

If IWSY moves to a major exchange as speculated above it will signal that the business they are announcing is about
to produce thoughtful revenue (biometrics is no longer on the come, it's now being adopted) by global enterprises.
Quarterly announcements will be a lot different likely beginning on the reporting of Q4 earnings, definitely on Q1
earnings. Institutional and fund traders will start to buy the name on more liquidity and growth. If so and this stock has
an opportunity to go much much higher and when it does, Goldman and other will not sell. Goldman is a board
member, he knows what he knows. Few would sell at $4, If they could sell at $10, or $12 Bad news for Pumpstopper
and short interest players. If the company announces additional strong large wins with household brand names
before, or on the next earnings update the squeeze will be on. You might want to find another stock to short, you will
get burned soon enough. Actually I hope you stay short so we know your are getting squeezed.

16 Sep 2014, 11:26 AM


Small Cap Machine, Contributor
does IWSY have a real product? yes. 
could IWSY win a few contracts? sure. 
Will they grow into their current valuation at $205m? It would take a miracle - let's assume their recurring rev business
is valued at 5x sales. Assuming $0.75/user, they'd need an install base of 55 MILLION users. WMT (or another global
retailer) is a start, but gets them only 3.6% of the way there, and that assumes FULL rollout (which would take
YEARS) to the ENTIRE WMT enterprise. The 400k they're currently contracted to rollout gets them a whopping 0.7%
of the way to the user base needed to justify the current $2 share price. Without several dozen major transactional
based customers (they have ZERO), this story is nothing but a pipe dream.


16 Sep 2014, 11:38 AM


longtermnotshorterm
Small Cap Machine,  
You are betting that there isn't a cascade effect from large wins from IWS.  
Say if the retailer is Walmart and the German Healthcare System embraces IWS, what then. Its a track record
they have lacked but with Fujitsu and T Systems that have aligned interest with IWS the probability of them
winning multiple large contracts is there. Granted wouldn't bet the house on it but valuations on tech
companies / new technologies-disruptive as Lous B pointed out are rarely based on tangible financial metrics.
As hackers beat lone biometrics (which they have and will continue to) and processing speeds for multiple bio
metrics increase (say taking a photo while reading a statement on your phone -2 seconds) the need for multi
modal biometric solutions will be nothing but essential.


I have never been impressed with the leadership of this company but have instead been swayed by the
technology (patents which they have enforced), offerings -first to market and in some cases unchallenged,
and their SIs (some of the largest in the world).


Time will tell as it always does. I predict a clear sign of success or failure will be clear by Feb 15.

SmallCap Machine talks like a person that knows nothing about the IT industry and how large companies deploy
solutions they need to effect their business and bottom line. As for several large transaction based customers!! Stay

won the German Healthcare system and that system has 81 million users. Small Cap, how many tech companies
have you worked for? 0?

I can't wait to short more on any deal announcement. I'm looking forward to their upcoming qtr of near $0
revenues and dwindling cash position (prepare for dilution!). They'll keep their streak alive of consistently
announcing multiple "promising deals" that will *shockingly* translate to meaningless future revenues.


16 Nov 2014, 03:36 PM

We should see initial revenues from announced deals in the Q4 conference call In January, or early February, that
should be enough time for Walmart, TSyetems to have come on line. Huge companies roll out services on thier
schedule, not yours. I suspect investors might see TransUmion revenues reported in Q2 timeframe. If IWSY
DELIVERS HERE THE STOCK WILL BE IN A DIFFERENT PRICE RANGE AND SHORTS LONG GONE. I also
suspect we could see the stock on the NASDAQ too. Time will tell, meantime wins are much better then no wins
unless you are a short player running out of gas.

I wouldn't be surprised if Craig Hallum cuts their 2015 revenue estimates by 50%. IWSY will be luck to generate $10m
of revs next yr. The stock is only trading at 20x next year's revenues!! What a bargain! I love how they drew down on
their Goldman line of credit and didn't even note it in their press release. That's the definition of shady. They have
about 1.5 months of cash left. Big Jim never ceases to disappoint (ooops, i mean "amaze")

My favorite quotes from just released 10Q:


"We have a history of recurring losses, and as of September 30, 2014, we have incurred a cumulative net loss of
approximately $134,320,000. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern."


"We do not anticipate that we can generate sufficient cash from operations to repay the amount due under the Lines
of Credit before expiration on March 27, 2015. We will therefore need to either extend the maturity date of the Lines of
Credit, or raise substantial additional capital through debt or equity financing to continue to execute our business plan.
No assurances can be given that any such 
financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.


"The inability to obtain debt or equity financing in a timely manner and in 
amounts sufficient to fund our operations, or the inability to extend the maturity date of the Lines of Credit would have
an immediate and substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It also
may require us to significantly modify our plan of operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level"

Just revealed on the call, the line of credit has been increased and extended. Will have to read the transcript to
confirm. Regardless, I still agree with you that a capital raise is coming.


17 Nov 2014, 05:42 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  the call was a total joke in my opinion, revenue DECLINED to <$1m and with $488k in cash,
yet another capital raise seems imminent. Keep in mind IWSY still has a market cap of $214m.... this seems
like "dot com" mania valuation right here. today. right now. amazing.


 
Distinguishing between the current line and a future equity raise is a bit of semantics anyway since it seems
to me that no way IWSY could every pay back the line so of course it will result in more dilution anyway.


But burning $2m+ per quarter, with guidance of increased head count (read more cash burn) next year, and
only $488k in cash and revenue pushed out and delayed YET AGAIN. Will be interesting to see if they try to
do the capital raise before the future "revenue" is supposed to ramp...

from $35m to $11m. And they now have the company losing over $6m next year.

Good article from Germany on Fujitsu's adoption of ImageWare technology.

None of the posters here I think?, have ever worked in a global enterprise, or carrier environment. It takes thoughtful
time to ramp up networks, users, and infrastructure, but when deployments scale up the rewards are most always
substantial to huge. Walmart, TransUnion (who moved very fast) TSystems, IBM, are such companies. In time we will
see revenue results, it requires patience and loyalty. I think that those that stay in this stock on the long side will be
very happy. From a trading perspective, traders should love this stock, there have been many 20% to 45% moves this
year, but some short players, or some posters here appear to be holding a grudge with Miller. That makes no sense If

you trade logically to capitalize on investment opportunities. I wonder why the publisher of this blog tolerates poor
behavior.

Author’s reply »  not sure if anyone still following this pos stock but revenue actually DECLINED while cash burn
increased AND margins also decreased. Seems like everything going wrong while nothing but more broken promises
and dilution for confused shareholders. Can't say the longs weren't warned here!

Author’s reply »  totally disagree, it seems to me that shorting IWSY based on their vague partnerships in the
past has been enormously profitable.
