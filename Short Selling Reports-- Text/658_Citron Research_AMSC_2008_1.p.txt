5/18/2018 American Superconductor (AMSC): Someone has a lot of explaining to do! – Citron Research

This past week, Wall Street whooped up the higher
top-line revenue number from American
Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC), and rewarded it
with an immediate 25%, plumping its market cap to
well over a billion dollars.  All this for a company
that has done nothing but over promise and under
deliver for years.


Citron seeks to answer a key question:  Was this
increase in revenue gained through legitimate
arms-length transactions, or was there another
explanation – some undisclosed related party
transactions? …  You be the judge.  If we look to the
insiders for guidance, they have already rendered
their verdict, in the form of insider selling at a
furious pace.  Read on and enjoy a true tale of Wall
St.


While alternative energy stocks have become Wall
Street darlings, it is important to di�erentiate those
who are players in the space to those who play like
they are in the space. General Electric and Siemens
are legitimate industry players in wind power and
then you have AMSC, who through a series of press
releases and a funky acquisition wants Wall Street


AMERICAN
SUPERCONDUCTOR
(AMSC): SOMEONE HAS A
LOT OF EXPLAINING TO
DO!

to forget that their superconductor business has
fallen o� a cli� (down 30%) last year and to forget
about the $400 million already pumped down the
drain at the end of that dream.


A Little Background


For those of you who are not familiar with American
Superconductor, they have been one of those
perennial money losing “dream technology”
companies who promise everything and deliver
nothing.  Here are a few snippets from their 10-K’s
of years gone by.


2000-“We believe that our existing
capital resources, including the
proceeds of our March o�ering, will
be su�cient to fund our operations
until we reach pro�tability and have
positive cash �ow”
2002 “We believe that our existing
capital resources will be su�cient to
fund our operations until the end of
�scal 2005, at which time we expect
to reach corporate-wide pro�tability”
2005 – “We expect to continue to
incur operating losses until at least
the end of �scal 2007”
2006- “We expect to continue to incur
operating losses until at least the end
of �scal 2009 and there can be no
assurance that we will ever achieve
pro�tability.”


In fact, this company has delivered a string of
unblemished losses stretching back 14 consecutive
years – without ever turning a single pro�t.  Not just
marginal losses, either – $400 million in total … and
none of this developing wind power, rather
Superconductors.

2007:  Into the Wind


Coming into 2007, American Superconductor
needed a new story to boost their stagnant stock
price.  In the �rst month of the year AMSC acquired
Windtec in order to enter the highly competitive
wind power market.  The cost of the acquisition was
$0 cash and $13 million in stock.  It is 15 months
later and the company is claiming that Windtec has
become the primary revenue engine for the entire
company, with one of Windtec’s customers
accounting for 52% of AMSC’s $74 million total
revenue, or about $37 million for the 9 months
ending Dec 31.


“Revenue growth in the nine months ended
December 31, 2007 is being driven largely by
our acquisitions, particularly Windtec. AMSC
Windtec’s largest customer is Sinovel Wind, in
China. For the nine months ended
December 31, 2007, Sinovel accounted for
approximately 52% of our total revenues. If
Sinovel cancelled contracts, or discontinued
future purchases from us, we might be
unable to replace the related revenues.”


Then they trumped that with a 4th quarter 8-K,
announcing record $38.1m revenues, and massive
backlog growth to nearly $200m, a 167% increase
since March 2007.  The concentration of orders
from Sinovel is undisclosed, but among other
things, we can’t wait to see what they come up with
for that data point in their upcoming 10-K.


R&D AWOL


It seems the acquisition of Windtec was so good
that AMSC gets a free entry into the wind systems
business without even doing any R&D.  AMSC’s R&D
expense companywide was a paltry $3.7 million last
quarter companywide.  This is down year over year
and most of that still goes into the money losing
superconductor business.


So who is Windtec?


Well, if Windtec can justify the majority of revenues
for a billion dollar company they must have been a

real solid company pre-acquisition … NOT!  Windtec
had been a small customer of AMSC since 2005. 
Admittedly, Windtec was an engineering design
�rm, not a manufacturer of wind systems.


On the 8-K �led 3/27/2007, we get a glimpse into
the real Windtec.  Founded in 1995, this is what the
company looked like after 11 years in operation (all
numbers in Euros)… NOT thousands either.


All �gures in Euros 
Cash: 345,000 
Inventory: 196,000 
Machinery and Equipment: 1,100,000 
Accounts Receivables: 2,000,000 
Accounts Payable:  1,700,000 
Short Term Borrowings: 335,000 
12-month R&D: 1,500,000 
Amount due to AMSC: 292,000


So basically, AMSC took a customer who owed
them almost 80% of all their cash and saved
them by acquisition…..
Let the Games Begin


In no time, Windtec became the darling of the
company as multi-million dollar orders came rolling
in from China.  Namely one customer – Sinovel. 
This one customer gave a series of orders to
Windtec in 2007 that totaled over $100 million.  Not
bad for Windtec, a company who just months
beforehand had only $196,000 in inventory.


As quoted above, Sinovel currently accounts for
more than 50% of all AMSC revenues and the
majority of their backlog. What makes this even
shadier is how this longstanding customer could
start giving Windtec these multimillion dollar orders
only months after Windtec was acquired for
peanuts.


Sinovel has become so crucial to the existence of
the company that they even disclose, “If Sinovel
cancelled contracts, or discontinued future
purchases from us, we might be unable to replace
the related revenues. This would have a serious
negative impact on our operating results and
�nancial position.”

It is the opinion of Citron that Sinovel is a related
party and American Superconductor has not
disclosed the true nature of the relationship.  This
spells big problems for AMSC


Let us start here – at the Sinovel homepage.


www.Sinovel.cn [http://www.sinovel.cn/]


Here we see the name of the company is not
Sinovel Wind, but rather Sinovel Windtec. 
Furthermore, we see numerous mentions online to
a joint company called “Sinovel Windtec”.  The
notion of an undisclosed relationship between the
two companies is even more compelling after we
see that a company called Sinovel Windtec existed
and was marketing products in 2006 (pre-
acquisition).

This as yet de�ned relationship between Sinovel
and Windtec not only exaggerates gross margins
for the company but more importantly it is the only
way to explain how a sleepy design engineering
�rm with the balance sheet of a pizza store can
become more than 50% of the revenues and the
driving force behind a $1.3 billion company.


Companies making related party transactions have
the burden of extra disclosure so investors can
make informed valuation decisions.  The SEC is very
clear about recording revenue from related party
transactions with Regulation SX and FASB
statement #57.  Management must explain to
shareholders the true nature of these
relationships.� 
Why?  Related party transactions can be loaded in
all di�erent ways, distorting their true economic
value and rendering them invalid in an apples-to-
apples comparison with arms-length transactions. 


AMSC discloses relying on “percentage completion”
accounting for “certain contracts”, there are even
more uncertainties regarding this one huge
customer, its burgeoning receivable, and the true

nature of its business relationship to AMSC. 
Or have they explained it through their insider
selling?


From the date of the �rst Sinovel/Windtec (only a
year ago) announcement to the present, CEO Greg
Yurek has sold over $8 million worth of stock.   That
�gure dwarfs his stake in the company – basically
he immediately runs his options to market as soon
as they vest – next to the losses, it’s the most
predictable transaction in AMSC’s �lings.   The
selling has come as recent as $140K worth of stock
last week.  This is the most rampant selling we have
seen by the CEO in his tenure.


Conclusion


You’d think Wall Street would have learned a lesson
from the catastrophic valuation destruction in�icted
on investors in the bubble collapse of 2000 and
2001.  Yet some of the same perpetrators get
resurrected and re�nanced every time Wall Street
has a new story to sell.  We now have a company
who out of the clear blue is generating revenue
from another company who seems to have
common ownership.  SOME ONE HAS A LOT OF
EXPLAINING TO DO.


Citron says don’t get burned.


Cautious investing to all.
