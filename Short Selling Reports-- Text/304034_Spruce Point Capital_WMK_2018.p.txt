About Spruce Point Capital Management


Spruce Point believes Weis Markets, Inc. (NYSE: WMK), a struggling supermarket, is obfuscating its financial 


pressures with aggressive accounting changes, and vastly reduced disclosures. Spruce Point has a history of 


research activist success in the food industry including Tootsie Roll and Boulder Brands. 


Boulder Brands Tootsie Roll


Report Date* 2/26/13 and 3/5/13 10/18/17


Enterprise Value $1.0 billion $2.3 billion


Spruce Point 
Criticism


Boulder Brands was facing a patent cliff on its Smart 
Balance butter and embarked on an expensive and levered 


acquisition spree to diversify into the faddish gluten free 
market. Segment realignments and questionable 


accounting were being used to mask fundamental strains. 
CEO Hughes was highly promotional and had a questionable 


history of value creation 


Tootsie Roll products face declining sales and earnings contraction. 
Management uses opaque financial disclosures, misclassification of 
expenses to overstate gross margins and cookie jar accounting to 
inflate operating cash flows. The Company also suffers from poor 


governance and capital allocation policies, including a lack of investor 
communication programs, and a Board stacked in favor of the 


controlling owner. We estimate 25%-50% downside risk


Successful 
Outcome


Boulder Brands took a significant goodwill impairment 
charge in Q3’2014 and guided results significantly below 
estimates by finally admitting headwinds in its spreads 
business and margin pressures. In June 2015, the CEO 


abruptly resigned. Boulder was forced out of the public 
markets and acquired by Pinnacle Brands for $11/sh, well 


below the initial short sell recommendation price


Shares tumbled 25% to a 52wk low in May 2018 after Q1’18 earnings
results showed margin pressure, declining sales, and reduce free cash 


flow. In June 2018, Tootsie Roll abruptly dismissed its auditor

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Believes Weis Markets (NYSE: WMK) 
Is A “Strong Sell” With 45% - 65% Downside Risk


A Poorly Positioned Supermarket In An Increasingly Competitive Space:


Not Aligned With Mega-Trends Affecting Supermarkets: We analyze key supermarket mega-trends and find Weis to be poorly positioned.


Cannot Compete On Price According To Our Proprietary Price Checks: We conducted price comparisons on a basket of staple food products. Weis’ prices 
were at a +19.7% premium to peers in 2017 vs. +15.6% premium in 2018. Weis is cutting prices and experiencing margin pressure. Convenience, 
followed by price, are the two main factors drawing shoppers to the local supermarket according to a recent NGA poll. Weis fares poorly on both. 


Numerous Sanitary, Pest Control Problems and Labeling Issues: An FDA FOIA shows issues with dead mice at Weis’ main distribution warehouse, and 
over 200 state inspection violations YTD in Pennsylvania. Multiple product recalls logged at the FDA suggest labelling and product control problems.


Evidence of Financial Strain Uncovered By Spruce Point Forensic Analysis: 


Evidence of Negative Organic Revenue Growth Being Obfuscated By Management: In 2016, Weis turned to growth by acquisitions, acquiring 5 Mars 
Super Markets, 38 Lions Food, and Nell’s Family Market. In the same period, Weis systematically stopped providing disclosures about same-store sales 
metrics across product categories. Weis says growth in 2017 was “primarily” by acquisitions. However, our analysis disproves this statement. Absent 
acquisitions, revenues decline by -0.5%. By further excluding fuel sales, core grocery and pharmacy sales declined by -1.1%. 


Big Data Insights Validate Concerns: Spruce Point gleaned insights from Earnest Research on credit card panel data to investigate further. Recent 
quarterly data show a concerning trend of declines in unique shoppers, total transactions, and average transaction per shopper. Weis has been able to 
partially offset these declines with growth in average transaction size per customer, but recent data shows this metric slowing too. We also provide 
compelling evidence to show Weis has poor customer retention relative to grocery peers, and is likely losing customers to low cost leaders such as Aldi


Gross And Operating Profit Under Pressure, Now Accounting Changes Made: Gross and operating margins are key performance metrics for supermarkets. 
In 2017, gross and operating margins tumbled to near an all-time low of 26.7% and 4.6%, respectively. Management blamed it on the weather, but we 
believe structural and competitive issues are the true underlying cause. Weis has also dramatically reduced operating costs disclosures, despite an SEC 
comment letter asking for greater cost detail. Spruce Point often finds companies under pressure make accounting changes to mask results. Not 
surprisingly, in Q1’18 Weis disclosed that it changed its accounting policy for cooperative advertising costs. As a result, it reclassified costs from 
operating, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales to lower gross margins. This allows Weis to deflect core margin declines.


Aggressive Accounting Change Artificially And Temporarily Inflates Operating Cash Flow: On the surface, Weis’ Q1’18 cash from operations looks 
impressive with 550% YoY growth. However, we find it moved accounts receivables to cash claiming that funds in transit under 7 days are cash 
equivalents. Based on our industry research, we disagree and believe its interpretation is very aggressive. Our pro forma analysis suggests that operating 
cash flow grew 74% YoY, substantially less than 550%. While on the surface impressive, the growth was further aided by depressed results in early 2017 
from its acquisitions. We expect future cash flow comparisons to become significantly more difficult. In Q2’18, cash flow declined 40% YoY


Weis Markets, Inc. (NYSE: WMK or “the Company”) is a regional supermarket that is poorly positioned amidst an intensifying competitive 


environment. With shares hitting both a 52 week high and low in the last year, we conducted a forensic and fundamental review. 


We conclude that Weis is covering up financial strains that will create meaningful headwinds in the coming quarters.

Spruce Point Believes Weis Markets (NYSE: WMK) 
Is A “Strong Sell” With 45% - 65% Downside Risk


Shareholder Unfriendly Policies And Governance Concerns:


Insider Buying Ahead of Accounting Change: Our worries about financial accounting gamesmanship are heightened by the fact that that the 
CEO/Chairman purchased stock for the first time ever in Nov 2017 ahead of making the questionable accounting changes in Dec 2017.


Auditor Turnover: As a cautionary sign, Weis is on its third auditor in just 4 years. E&Y has served as the auditor twice. In its last stint, E&Y was dismissed 
in 2016 after just 2 years (same year product level SSS metrics were suspended). E&Y’s first time as auditor it chose not to be reappointed.


No Conference Calls: Weis provides little descriptive details of its earnings in press releases and doesn’t hold conference calls. Furthermore, in our 
opinion, quarterly Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) in SEC filings are insufficient to fully understand Weis’ financial performance.


Run For The Benefit of Insiders: The Weis family controls the Company and uses NYSE governance exemptions to create a weak Board of just 5 members 
(3 are “independent”) that can rubber stamp the Chairman and CEOs directives. For example, despite 2017 being the worst year in recent history, the 
compensation committee claimed 2017 was a “success” and approved a 10% and 15% salary raise to the CEO and CFO, respectively. Executives also use a 
corporate jet despite the fact that most supermarkets are within a few hours drive of company headquarters.


A Deliberate Non-Equity Culture: Weis states bluntly that “The Compensation Committee does not believe that equity-based incentives are a valuable 
incentive for employees of the Company“. As a result, the entire executive team and Board (ex: Chairman/CEO Weis) own a laughable 17,604 shares 
(approx. $1m). Furthermore, there are no equity or option programs for rank and file employees to incentivize value creation.


The Most Expensive Supermarket In America Relative To Declining Growth And Poor Positioning, We See 45%-65% Downside Risk:


Benchmark Analysis Illustrates A Suboptimal Company: We compare key financial metrics relative to other regional chains and find below avg results.


Recent Financial Performance Unsustainable: The entire “earnings upside” in 2017 came from a one-time tax benefit and recent gimmicks used to 
optically improve operating cash flow – neither of which are sustainable and will create difficult year-over-year comparisons.


New Capital “Growth” Plan Appears Deceptive, Won’t Move The Needle: In April 2018, Weis announced a plan to invest $101m in growth, including two 
new store openings. However, it failed to disclose it is closing three stores! The majority of the $ is for store remodels, supply chain improvements + IT 
upgrades - sorely needed to remain competitive. In other words, capital is directed toward maintenance and not store growth.


Trading At Irrational Premium To Recent Takeover Multiples: Our analysis of recent regional supermarket takeout premiums suggest Weis would be fully 
valued at 0.3x, 6.4x and 19.0x estimated sales, EBITDA and P/E. Weis trades at 0.3x, 7.6x and 32.0x for a subpar industry player with below average 
margins. Weis reminds us of Tootsie Roll which was also trading at an irrational premium to its takeover value. Tootsie subsequently declined ~25%.


Lack of Research Coverage To Say “Sell”: Weis has no analysts that cover its story, but we’ve followed it carefully and believe there’s nothing but 
downside. We expect margins to continue to contract as Weis is faced with reality that it must be more price competitive to survive. Valuing Weis at a 
discount to peers to reflect its weak disclosures and financial profile, poor market position and governance, we estimate 45%-65% downside risk.

Weis’ Capital Structure And Valuation

1) Based on our forensic analysis


$ in millions, except per share figures


In our opinion, Weis Markets is a regional supermarket with limited differentiation from peers and struggling to 


adopt to the changing environment. The Company holds no conference calls, has questionable financial statements, 


and unsustainable financial performance given aggressive and recent accounting changes made at year end 2017. 


Weis has the highest valuation in the supermarket sector despite declining organic growth and margins, poor return 


on capital, and is trading well above recent takeover premiums in the supermarket sector.

Weis Markets Rapid Share Price 
Increase Merits Intense Scrutiny


Source: Bloomberg


With supermarkets under pressure from disruptive new threats (Amazon entering the supermarket and pharmacy space / 


home delivery services), as well as big box supercenters like WalMart gaining traction in the grocery space, we found it 


unusual that Weis’ share price went from a 52 week low to a 52 week high in a few months. We believe Weis’ share price 


increase is a result of investors’ buying into Weis’ recent financials at face value, and extrapolating that recent performance is 


indicative of future results. Our forensic analysis reveals numerous one-time factors and aggressive accounting changes that 


are flattering recent results. As a result, we believe that Weis will be unable to sustain future earnings and cash flow increases, 


resulting in plummeting growth rates and a stiff reversal of its share price.

Evidence of a Structurally Non-
Competitive Regional Supermarket

Weis Markets Not Aligned With 
Supermarket Mega Trends


Supermarket / Food Industry Trend Challenge / Opportunity
Spruce Point Assessment of 


Weis Positioning


Mass market retailers selling basic 
grocery products and succeeding


Consumers value convenience and price. One-stop shopping 
for basic groceries at places like WalMart, Target and Costco


combine both


Poorly Positioned
Weis cannot compete on price for basic food products 


with the supercenter retailers


Sourcing and offering hyper-local food
Consumers increasingly want a connection to their food, and 


know where it was made


Above Average
With roots in Pennsylvania, Weis does have local 


products. It is also known for making its own ice cream, 
processes its meats and milk


Ability To Connect With Millennials 


Millennials will dominate the future of food buying and have 
grown up in the connected smart phone era. A new research 
study shows they devote less of their food budget to grocery 


stores purchases and make fewer trips to the store


Poorly Positioned
Limited Twitter (8k), Instagram (3k) presences where 


most millennials spend time on Social Media


Pre-Packaged Meals


Amazon now delivers groceries and moved into the physical 
market with the acquisition of Whole Foods. Pre-packed meal 


kits (think Plated/Blue Apron) represent a small but fast 
growing (25%+ p.a.)  segment of the food industry


Poorly positioned
Competitors like Giant Foods partnering with 


HelloFresh for instore pick-up. 
Blue Apron appears at Costco. Weis meal delivery 


partner Chef’d shuts down


Instore Drinking and Dining
As a way to keep stores relevant as more shopping goes 


online, some supermarkets are carving out 
space for indoor dining


To Be Determined
Main competitor Wegman’s has a cafe and offers a 


variety of gourmet options just like Whole Foods. Weis 
has a deli with limited sandwich options and just 
started testing beer-wine cafés in select stores


Online Ordering Options  / 
Home Delivery


Food shopping has become all about convenience. Consumers 
expect the ability to use a smart phone to pre-arrange their


orders for pick-up at the supermarket location or home 
delivery 


Poorly Positioned
Weis offers limited products for purchase online that 


can be picked up at the store. Its Apple mobile app has 
a terrible 1.5 stars. It has a limited home delivery 


partnership with Shipt 


Payment Technologies / Checkout


Industry experts see new payment methods like Apple Pay 
and Google Wallet to be adopted in supermarkets. Also, some 


are experimenting with scanning items via mobile phone or 
hand-held devices


Poorly Positioned
Competitors like Amazon and Kroger’s are already 


rolling out self-scanning technologies. Giant Eagle using 
Scan Pay & Go

Repeated Food Recalls Show Food 
Labelling And Control Issues


Date Weis Product Recall Problem


March 21, 2018


Issued a recall for its store-made Weis Quality Cole Slaw (one pound container) for failing to list egg as an allergen on its label. 
This item was made in the seafood department.  Food allergies are an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a 
food containing an allergen. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive 
problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening 
reaction known as anaphylaxis. This product was sold in eight Weis Markets' stores in the Binghamton NY area. This recall is 
being issued as a precaution. The sell by dates being recalled are March 21, 18 through March 24, 18. The issue was discovered 
during a routine New York state inspection. Customers may return the product for a full refund.


Feb 9, 2018


Issued a recall for its pre-made Penne Pasta with Asiago Sauce and Grilled Chicken single serving meal for failing to list a milk 
allergen on its label.  People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious life-threatening allergic 
reaction if they consume these products. The product is safe for consumption by those who do not have an allergy or severe 
sensitivity to milk. The product was sold in all Weis Markets’ stores


Feb 6, 2018


Issued a recall for its store-made Weis Quality Dried Beef Party Rye dip for failing to list egg and milk allergens on its label. This 
product was sold in eleven Weis Markets’ stores including most of its Binghamton NY area stores excluding its Vestal location. 
The dip was also sold in its two Williamsport PA stores located on River Avenue and Lycoming Creek Road and its Hazleton PA 
store. This recall is being issued as a precaution. Customers may return the product for a full refund


Oct 17, 2017


Issued a recall for its store made bacon, lettuce and tomato (BLT) sandwiches since the product’s ingredient label does not list
an egg allergen contained in the sandwich’s mayonnaise.  People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to eggs run the risk 
of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product. One customer reported an egg allergy reaction after 
eating the recalled BLT sandwich. The customer received an EpiPen injection. No hospitalization was required. This product, 
which has been removed from sale, was sold in Weis Markets’ delis in the company’s 204 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
Virginia, New Jersey, New York, Delaware and West Virginia.

According to a recent survey by Nielsen on behalf of the National Grocers Association, convenience, followed by 


price, are the two biggest factors drawing shoppers into the local grocery. (1) We conducted a non-scientific study of 


Weis’ prices relative to peers. We find that its prices are on average 15%-20% higher. Weis’ prices decreased 8% 


relative to peers between mid-year 2017 and 2018.  As a result, we expect Weis’ gross margins to be pressured in 2018.

retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the years presented, management cannot accurately measure the full impact 


of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying 


patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors.” (10-Q, p. 12, May 10, 2018)

Big Data Insights Validate Weis’ Struggles


Spruce Point sourced big data insights from Earnest Research, a data platform that creates consumer insight products for 


institutional investors derived from credit- and debit-card transaction data across 6 million anonymous, US-based 


consumers. Earnest’s data on ~42,000 Weis Markets customers shows that over the past three quarters, unique shoppers, 


average transactions per shopper and total transactions have declined YoY. Weis has mitigated these negative trends with 


an increase in average ticket price per shopper. However, in 2Q18 it posted the lowest YoY growth in recent quarters (3.5%).


Three quarters in a row of negative YoY trends in unique shoppers, average 


number of transactions per shopper and total transactions

Low Cost Competitors Such As Aldi And 
Lidl Are Penetrating Weis’ Customer Base


Aldi and Lidl continue to gain Weis customers. Earnest Research data shows 36.2% of Weis customers transacted at an 


Aldi in the 12 months prior to July 2018, up from 30.4% in July 2017 and 8.0% vs 0.8% at Lidl over the same period (n = 


~42,000 Weis customers observed since July 2016).


Note: Lidl began opening stores in Weis markets in the summer of 2017

Weis’ Consumer Retention Trails Peers


Aldi drives superior retention of its customers. Below, an Earnest Research cohort analysis of new Weis and Aldi 


shoppers in July 2017 shows 15.9% of Aldi customers continued to shop at Aldi after 12 months versus 10.7% at Weis. 


Additionally, new Aldi customers are more valuable than new Weis customers. Within this cohort, on average, Aldi 


customers spent $75 more than Weis customers over 12 months ($248.20 at Aldi vs $173.20 at Weis).

Weis New Store Cannot Escape 
Low Cost Competition Nearby


Weis is only opening two new stores in 2018 (and closing three that have been undisclosed). It chose to open in Randolph, NJ on 


July 19, 2018 at the site of a former failed A&P supermarket location. (1,2) We believe Weis will be challenged to succeed here 


given its close proximity to lower cost competitors 10-15 minutes away. Per the latest shopper review on Google, consumers 


already seem to be catching on to Weis’ off-market prices.

Weis gives a misleading view of its underlying sales performance in 2017. The Company says it attributes it sales 


growth “primarily” to acquisitions, but based on our analysis, all of its sales growth (and more) was attributable to

More Evidence of SSS Pressure Arises In Q2’18?


More Excuses Than Ever For A Q2 Sales Comparison:


“The Company’s second quarter sales were adversely affected by holiday shifts on Easter and Fourth of July.  The 2018 
Easter sales week fell on the last week of the first quarter and the slow selling week afterwards fell in the second quarter this 
year.  While comparatively last year, both holiday selling weeks fell in the second quarter.  Additionally, the Fourth of July 
fell later in the week after the second quarter ended.  Management estimates the incremental holiday sales impact was 
approximately $12.5 million and included it in the second quarter 2018 comparable store sales. ”   Source: 2017 10-Q, p.9


Weis’ negative SSS print in Q2’18 caught our attention because it blamed the results partly on Easter and the Fourth 


of July. We investigated the Company’s historical reliance on these holidays. While frequently citing Easter as 


impacting Q1/Q2 results, we found that that the last time Weis even mentioned the Fourth of July as material to 


results was 17 years ago in 2001. Looking carefully, we find that management inflated its comps in Q2 by acting as if 


$12.5m of lost July 4th sales occurred in Q2’18.


The Last Time Weis Even Mentioned 4th of July In An SEC Filing 17 Years Ago:


“The decrease in inventories in this year is attributable to how the Fourth of July holiday shipping period fell
this fiscal year compared to last year.”   Source: Aug 2001 10-Q, p.7

Weis is also dodgy when giving disclosures about its operating costs drivers. In Oct 2015, after questioning 


by the SEC, it agreed to provide more cost disclosures. (1) Fast forward two years later, and Weis is back to 


its practice of giving minimal cost disclosure.

Warning Accounting Change Ahead of Insider 
Buying: Historical Gross Margin Inflation


Spruce Point has consistently warned to pay close attention to gross margins when evaluating a company’s financial 


health. It is a particularly important metric for analyzing supermarkets. Weis recently disclosed an accounting change 


at year end 2017 related to advertising credits that historically inflated gross margins. We pro forma adjust its results 


to better reflect reality. Oddly enough, the only purchase ever made by Chairman/CEO Weis was in Nov 2017 ahead of 


the revision. (1) On the next slide, we will illustrate another change made that flatters a more critical performance 


metric: operating cash flow.


Per the 2017 10-K: “Vendor allowances recorded as credits in cost of sales totaled $114.1 million in 2017, $123.9 million 
in 2016 and $97.0 million in 2015. Vendor paid cooperative advertising credits totaled $19.2 million in 2017, $19.1 million 
in 2016 and $17.1 million in 2015. These credits were netted against advertising costs within “Operating, general and administrative expenses.”


Per the 10-Q: “As of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its policy for advertising costs to expense advertising costs as incurred, net of 
vendor paid cooperative advertising credits, in Cost of sales… Management deems the policy change to record net advertising costs in Cost of 
sales instead of Operating, general and administrative expenses better represents Cost of sales inclusive of direct product costs (net of discounts 
and allowances), distribution center and transportation costs, manufacturing facility operations and advertising costs that are primarily funded 
by vendor cooperative advertising credits and occur in the same period the product is sold.”

Unusual Accounting Change Gives 
Misleading View of Cash Conversion


Weis made a recent accounting change to consider funds-in-process under a week as cash equivalents. 


By making this change, it will reduce its accounts receivable outstanding, artificially enhance its operating cash 


flow, and make its cash conversion cycle appear better. Weis’ MD&A discussion appears misleading as it does not 


call out the accounting change was a factor contributing to the $43m increase.


Source: Q1’2018 10-QSource: Q1’2017 10-Q


Misleading MD&A Discussion: “Cash flows from operating activities increased $43.0 million in the first 13 weeks of 2018 compared to the first 13 
weeks of 2017.  Higher profits, lower inventories and lower management incentive payouts accounted for the increase in cash provided.”


Buried In The Footnotes An Unusual Change: “As of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its policy for cash and cash equivalents to include 
all credit card, debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days in the amount of $31.4 million and $26.6 
million as of March 31, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Management deems the classification of the amounts due from third-party financial 
institutions to be more appropriately reported in cash and cash equivalents due to certainty and timely settlement in less than seven days. The amounts 
have been reclassified from accounts receivable to cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017 in the amount of $26.6 million to conform to the 
presentation of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018.”

Evidence of Aggressive Accounting Policy


Company Disclosure About Funds In Transit


Weis Markets
Company changed its policy for cash and cash equivalents to include all credit card, debit card and 
electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days 


Whole Foods
Accounts receivable are shown net of related allowances and consist primarily of credit card 
receivables, vendor receivables, customer purchases, and occupancy-related receivables


Kroger’s


Deposits in-transit generally represent funds deposited to the Company’s bank accounts at the end 
of the year related to sales, a majority of which were paid for with debit cards, credit cards and 
checks, to which the Company does not have immediate access but settle within a few days of the 
sales transaction.


Sprout’s Farmers Market
Deposits in transit includes sales through the end of the period, the majority of which were paid 


with credit and debit cards and settle within a few days of the sales transactions


Village Super Markets
Included in cash and cash equivalents are proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions, 


which typically settle within five business days


Based on a review of other public company disclosures in the supermarket industry, it is apparent that Weis 


uses the most aggressive interpretation by allowing itself to include funds in transit up to week. 


Industry practice would suggest funds in transit for at best a few days is more appropriate.

Pro Forma Adjusted Cash From Operations $26.40 -- $46.19 +74.7% YoY growth


Spruce Point believes part of what has driven Weis’ share price is the belief that its operating cash flow grew 550% 


YoY in Q1’18. However, by pro forma adjusting results for its aggressive accounting change to accelerate accounts 


receivables as cash, and a one-time incentive payment (cash flow drag) from Q1’17, we estimate the growth rate was 


74%. Furthermore, we believe the Q1’17 cash flow was artificially depressed by three acquisitions made in Q3/Q4 2016. 


We expect the cash flow comparisons going forward will be increasingly difficult to show growth.

Significant Auditor Turnover


Auditor Appointed Dismissed Note

Ernst and Young Feb 2014 July 2016
Second stint with Ernst and Young as auditor 


ended in just 2yrs


Grant Thornton Sept 2004 Feb 2014


Ernst and Young Jan 1996 Sept 2004


E&Y notified the Company that they did not 
wish to submit a proposal for the 2005 audit 
engagement and had also decided to resign 


as auditors for fiscal year 2004 effective 
immediately.


Investors should be cautioned that Weis is on its third auditor in the last four years. It also appears unusual to us 


that E&Y has served as its auditor twice, with the first time declining to be reappointed.

Shareholder Unfriendly Policies And 
Governance Concerns
36


Weis Markets Run For Insiders, 
Not For Shareholders


The Weis family controls 65% of the stock and uses NYSE governance exemptions to create a weak Board of just 5 


members (3 are independent) that can rubber stamp the Chairman and CEOs directives. For example, even when 


financial performance was at a multi-year low in 2017, executives did just great at the expense of shareholders.


Source: Weis Proxy Statement, pp. 10, 14, 20


Weis’ Compensation Committee Must Live In The Twilight Zone Where Decade Low Performance = Success


• “Based on consideration of the criteria discussed above and the overall financial and operational success of the Company in 
2017, the Compensation Committee made the decision to provide a salary merit increase, ranging from 4% to 14.9%, to the 
Named Executive Officers” 


• “The Compensation Committee approved a 10.4% increase in base salary for the Chairman, President and Chief Executive 
Officer, Mr. Jonathan H. Weis in fiscal 2017”


• “The Compensation Committee approved a 14.9%,  5.9.% and 4% increase in base salary for the Senior Vice President, Chief 
Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mr. Scott F. Frost, the Senior Vice President of Operations, Mr. David W. Gose II, and the Senior 
Vice President of Real Estate and Development, Mr. Harold G. Graber, respectively,  in fiscal 2017”


Ridiculous Perks For A Company Where All Its Assets Are Within A Few Hours Drive of Its Headquarters


• “For security purposes, Named Officers may use the Company aircraft for business and for limited personal travel.” 


• Spruce Point requests that Weis tell its shareholders the last security threat received by a Weis supermarket executive, and 
if shareholders were reimbursed for personal travel 


And of Course, When Times Get Tough, Ramp-Up Related-Party Dealing With The Chairman/CEO


• “On January 16, 2018, the Company purchased a parcel of land from Central Properties, Inc., a company in which Jonathan H. 
Weis and his immediate family members have a material beneficial ownership.  The purchase price of $1.1 million was 
approved by the Company’s Executive Committee in accordance with Company policy and regulatory guidelines, and reviewed 
and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Code of 
Ethics for CEO and CFO, the Audit Committee Charter and the Company’s Related Party Transaction policy.”

Worst “Modified” Return On Capital 
In The Supermarket Industry


Weis’ executives have a cash incentive plan linked to “Modified Return on Invested Capital” (MROIC)”. 


It uses a non-standard definition that applies a 20x multiple to rental expense to calculate invested capital. (1) 


Nevertheless, if we take Weis MROIC definition at face value, and compare it with national and regional 


supermarket peers, we find it has among the worst MROIC in the industry.


Weis horribly missed its target MROIC in 2017 by 2%


• The threshold, target and maximum hurdles for MROIC in fiscal 2017 were equal to a result of 9.29%, 9.48% and 9.96%, 
respectively. Yet, recall the compensation committee gave executives a base salary pay raise saying performance was great


• Weis terrible performance was matched only by Supervalu, which faced a proxy battle by frustrated investors (2)

Weis Cares Nothing About Motivating 
Employees Or Shareholder Value Creation


Why would any shareholder ever want to own stock in a company where the culture has a complete 


disregard for shareholder value creation, and no one is incentivized to perform? Weis neither rewards 


investors with favorable return of capital policies, nor its employees for their dedicated service.


A Terrible Non-Equity Culture  


• Weis states bluntly the following:  “The Compensation Committee does not believe that equity-based incentives 
are a valuable incentive for employees of the Company“ (1)


• As a result, the entire executive team and Board (ex: Chairman/CEO Weis) own a laughable 17,604 shares 
(approximately $1m). Furthermore, there are no equity or option incentive programs for any of Weis’ 23,000 full 
and part-time employees to incentivize value creation


Executive and Board Member Share Ownership Options


Kurt Schertle / COO 1,000 0


Scott Frost / CFO 2,568 0


David Gose II / VP Real Estate -- 0


Harold Graber / SVP Real Estate 2,036 0


Dennis Hatchell / Director 5,000 0


Ed Lauth III / Director 2,000 0


Gerald Silverman / Director 5,000 0


Total Executive and Board Ownership 17,604 0


Terrible Capital Allocation


• Weis has a flexible capital structure with $93m of net cash, an underutilized revolver, and free cash flow. Yet it pays 
just a modest 2% dividend, and last raised the dividend 1c per quarter 7 years ago


• The Company hasn’t repurchased stock of any materiality in almost 18yrs, even during periods when its stock 
remained depressed

Weis’ valuation premium to peers is not warranted given its declining organic revenue and earnings growth, poor 


governance and disclosures practices.


We use our organic sales growth 


calculation as proxy for true SSS. 


Given Weis opened only 1 net store in 


2017, we believe it is an accurate 


reflection. Weis ranks the second 


worst in the industry next to Supervalu

The acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon (and entry into the Pharmacy market) has sent shockwaves in the supermarket 


industry. While not a representative valuation comparison for Weis, we analyzed recent regional acquisitions and find the 


average Sales, EBITDA and P/E multiple to be 0.3x, 6.4x, and 19.0x, respectively. However, Weis’ 4.8% EBITDA margin is 


below the deal peer average of 5.2% and we also believe organic sales are declining low single digits. Given suboptimal 


financial performance, poor disclosures and governance, Weis should trade at a discount to M&A valuation benchmarks.

On the high end, Sprout’s trades near 18x and

There is no way to justify Weis’ current valuation in the context of its struggling financial performance, aggressive 


accounting changes inflating recent performance, declining disclosures, and terrible governance practices. Using a 


combination of current public valuations for supermarkets and historical acquisition multiples in the sector, it is easy 


to justify approximately 45% to 65% downside risk.

Summary of Bear Case on Weis Markets


Poorly positioned regional supermarket in the hypercompetitive Northeast region that is a step behind in the 
megatrends pressuring the supermarket industry. Despite cutting prices, Weis is still not competitive across a 
basket of staple food products at price points 15% to 20% higher than peers 


Recent financial results and stock performance being driven by aggressive accounting changes to cash flow, 
and a few one-time issues that made comparisons look easy in early 2018. These will become material 
headwinds in the coming quarters


Unreliable comparable store sales metrics as a result of vastly reduced disclosures, followed by frequent 
auditor changes. Recent Q2’18 metrics being qualified and bolstered by inclusion of estimated sales from 
July 4th. Underlying organic growth conservatively estimated to be down 2%


Negative unit store growth in 2018, including three undisclosed store closures. $101m capital spending plan 
announced in April 2018 necessary to drive maintenance and refurbishment to forestall market share loss 
and remain competitive 


Poor governance and investor communications include no conference calls, deficient SEC disclosures in our 
opinion, no alignment of employees with shareholders, and beholden to the Weis family to act for the public 
shareholders’ best interest 


Inflated valuation making Weis the most expensive supermarket in the United States for no obvious 
reason. Declining organic growth, gross margins, and poor returns on capital make Weis an unattractive 
target. It currently trades beyond any reasonable valuation multiple an acquirer would pay for the stock


Numerous violations by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Food Safety and the FDA for sanitary problems, including 
food contamination and pest control concerns
