ServiceNow: Decelerating Growth, Limited Market Size Point To Large
Downside
Nov. 15, 2012 8:00 AM ET29 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the "Company") is highly overvalued. The
Company was taken public earlier this year at $18/share and has since ridden the cloud
computing wave to a price of $30/share, implying an eye-popping 18.3x 2012E revenue
multiple. Even if ServiceNow becomes the market leader and grows its share of the $1.5
billion IT Help Desk market from the current 10%-15% to 30%, we believe the stock is still
worth less than half of its current trading price.


Our full report is available here.


We have spoken to numerous industry professionals about ServiceNow and the IT
Service Management ("ITSM") sector, and our research indicates that ServiceNow does
not have a sustainable competitive advantage over its numerous public and private peers.
The Company has become a victim of its own success by helping to galvanize a
previously dormant industry to rapid innovation. NOW does not offer a unique technology;
rather, it merely introduced the SaaS business model to a sector where slow-moving
incumbents had frustrated certain segments of their customer base through cumbersome
upgrades and lumpy up-front costs. Its adoption of a SaaS solution, combined with an
aggressive salesforce, helped NOW gain market share at the expense of larger players.


Today, however, the competitive landscape has changed, with both incumbents and a
slew of new upstarts featuring SaaS offerings similar to NOW's products, and many at
lower price points. The result has been predictable: NOW's once enviable growth is rapidly
decelerating. The first signs of this became apparent when the company reported its third
quarter earnings, when NOW declined 12% after reporting slowing growth in the third
quarter and projecting further decelerating growth in the upcoming quarter.


Given ServiceNow's absurd $4.7 billion market capitalization, when compared to $239m of
projected 2012 revenue, we think NOW's share price is positioned to collapse. The market
is gradually digesting the company's decelerating growth trends, and as NOW's December
lockup expiration approaches, we believe the market will send the stock materially lower.


Below are key reasons why NOW's share price should plummet:

NOW's decelerating growth rates in Q3 and Q4E are only the beginning. NOW's
market share gains have not been driven by technology, patents or enhanced R&D;
rather, they are the function of ServiceNow offering a SaaS ITSM help desk solution
for customers who were disenchanted with the incumbents' on-premise offerings due
to cumbersome upgrades, unpredictable costs, and a lack of customization flexibility.
While that helped NOW gain initial momentum, the marketplace is meaningfully
changing, with virtually all players introducing SaaS offerings. BMC Software
(NASDAQ:BMC) is quickly expanding its RemedyForce segment and has introduced
the user-friendly MyIT offering. HP (NYSE:HPQ) has reworked its help desk product
with the release of Service Anywhere, a SaaS-based ITSM upgrade designed for what
it calls "codeless configuration." Smaller players like Cherwell Software, EasyVista,
and Hornbill are offering competitive SaaS solutions that are winning business and
gaining share. The increased competition should pressure NOW's overall growth rate
as well as reduce market pricing, rendering ServiceNow's historical growth rates
unsustainable. Finally, the low-hanging fruit in terms of customer wins is rapidly drying
up. NOW's prior client wins have been fueled by frustrated customers who had no
qualms about switching from on-premise to SaaS; future wins will have to come from
customers who may not be as aggravated with BMC's or HP's on-premise offerings or,
for small- and mid-sized businesses, may prefer a simpler out-of-the-box solution from
Cherwell, Hornbill, EasyVista, or other private competitors.


The overall ITSM market size is only $1.5 billion, less than one-third of NOW's
$4.7 billion market capitalization. Leading technology research firm Gartner
estimates that the IT Service Management market opportunity is $1.5 billion, and is
growing at a modest 7% per year. Furthermore, Gartner's research predicts that only
50% of IT organizations will move to SaaS by 2015, implying that the total market
opportunity for NOW's ITSM business is less than $1 billion. Given emerging
competition from other SaaS ITSM service providers, we believe that the company will
have a difficult time exceeding 30% market share. At $207m of LTM revenue, NOW
appears to already control 10% to 15% of the market. So even if NOW's market share
rises to 30%, which we don't see happening until 2014 at the earliest, NOW's ITSM
business should be generating less than $600m in revenue with limited additional
growth opportunities. The result of the limited market size and increasing competition
will be flattening growth over the next few years.


We see limited evidence that NOW is generating meaningful business outside of
its core ITSM help desk offering. In order to inflate its addressable market size,
NOW management claims to have created revenue opportunities beyond the IT Help

Desk with its Discovery and Runbook Automation products. These modules contain
additive functionality designed for the Configuration Management and Workload
Automation software markets used by IT departments. But analysis from Gartner,
Citigroup, and our research, all indicate that ServiceNow's simplistic products have yet
to capture more than a negligible share of either market opportunity. ServiceNow has
yet to even make it into the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation or its
categorization of Configuration Management providers, which summarize the leading
vendors in each discipline.
ServiceNow's PaaS is unproven and outmatched. NOW's PaaS offering faces
daunting challenges. The product's closed platform and lack of off-the-shelf third-party
applications strikes us as too flawed to succeed against entrenched platforms from the
likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT). ServiceNow's PaaS uses a largely closed, "single-tenant" system
that does not easily integrate with outside software applications, limiting its ability to
integrate best-of-breed tools that come from outside the ServiceNow ecosystem. For
these reasons, we don't believe that PaaS can grow into the type of revenue driver that
could justify NOW's lofty valuation. In fact, the closed nature of NOW's PaaS offering
could be a long-term shortcoming of NOW's Help Desk product versus more open
solutions like Remedyforce, which integrates with the Force.com platform.
ServiceNow's Help Desk product has many of the same flaws as its legacy
competitors', including long implementation times, complexity during software
upgrade cycles, and daunting upfront coding costs. After numerous calls with
customers and Help Desk experts, we believe that NOW falls well short of fully
addressing the industry's pervasive problems. Should a customer require customized
functionality, as many do, it can take 6-8 months (page 38 of the initial S-1) and tens of
thousands of dollars in implementation costs to get NOW's system up and running.
Furthermore, a 'pure' SaaS offering should have a multi-tenant design, meaning that
the underlying code is shared by all users in the cloud. This makes regular software
updates simpler and vastly reduces the time and costs required for upfront
implementation. And if an enterprise-class customer needs a high degree of
customization, then a non-SaaS, hosted system like BMC Remedy may be
comparable. For these reasons, we think it's a mistake to assume that the Company's
growth can remain head and shoulders above its rapidly evolving competition over the
next 1-2 years.


Given ServiceNow's limited market size, competitive pressures within the SaaS
ITSM sector, unproven PaaS product, and uninspiring technology when one
looks past its more commoditized ITSM offering, the math behind NOW's

valuation simply does not add up. ServiceNow reported 13% sequential revenue
growth in Q3 and has projected about 10% sequential revenue growth in Q4. Even if it
beats guidance in Q4, sequential quarter-over-quarter growth will likely decline below
10% in 2013 and probably below 5% by 2014, which implies annual revenue growth of
20% to 30%. The current 18x 2012E revenue is a preposterous multiple given the
slowing growth and numerous business challenges NOW will face.


From a technical standpoint, only 11% of NOW's float is publicly traded (13.4m
of its 123m shares), but that should soon increase as lockups expire and as its
highly dilutive option pool (37m; $4.48 strike) is exercised. Following an initial IPO
price range of only $15-$17, NOW shares have since traded up to $30 on very little
news (shares moved up 5% after a Q1 2012 revenue beat). We believe this run has
been partly caused by NOW's 'thin float' or a 'sliver sale' initial public offering, a
practice that even Jim Cramer eviscerates as reckless. ServiceNow sold 13.4m of its
123m common shares in the June 2012 IPO. By creating a mismatch between supply
and demand, these thin floats can artificially drive up demand for shares, thereby
inflating the share prices in the hopes that it remains at elevated levels through the
lock-up period. ServiceNow's remaining shares were supposed to be locked-up until
the day after Christmas, but according to a newly filed secondary S-1 (the "Amended
S-1"), the Company has modified this lock-up and plans to sell 13.4m new shares at
an earlier date. This will approximately double the public float. Should the underwriters
exercise their greenshoe, as is typical, NOW will also dilute its existing shareholders
with 1.9m new shares. The remaining 10.0m shares (or 11.5m shares if the greenshoe
is exercised) are being sold by NOW's venture capital investors. NOW also has an
enormously dilutive option pool consisting of 37m options struck at an average price of
$4.48, creating a dilutive effect of 32m shares at the current share price. Certain
financial databases, industry press, and even Wall Street analysts completely overlook
this option number in their valuation calculations.


In this article, we will address the above concerns in detail and their implications to value.


I. Company Overview


ServiceNow is a niche business software developer that markets IT Service Management
products under a software-as-a-service ("SaaS") subscription model. The Company's lead
product is an IT Help Desk program that has been the most heavily marketed SaaS
product to emerge in a space largely dominated by hosted software. With any IT Help
Desk software, instead of picking a phone to call the help desk, an employee can log into
an online system to report their IT issue and receive rapid feedback. The IT manager on

the other end receives the query, makes the required changes and solves the issue as
part of his or her workflow queue. The Company calls this an "incident, problem, and
change" process (NOW Q2 Call). Our more than dozen calls with experts have indicated
that the Help Desk software space is largely commoditized with a litany of vendors offering
similar products. However, incumbents were initially slow to move to a SaaS model, which
has several advantages over hosted software. This created an opportunity for the
completely SaaS-based NOW. The advantages of SaaS include automated software
updates, remote access through the cloud and off-premise database redundancies,
amongst others. With that said, hosted software remains the most sensible choice versus
SaaS for the many enterprise-scale businesses that require the greatest functionality and
wish to maintain their software systems on more secure, in-house networks. In the case of
ServiceNow, customization comes with a price since customers must retain JavaScript
programmers on their staff or hire outside consultants to maintain the NOW code
database. More recently introduced competitive SaaS offerings have migrated from
complex coding requirements to out-of-the-box, multi-tenant SaaS solutions that offer
simpler upfront implementation.


For an overview of the ServiceNow software, we suggest that investors view the
Company's demo site and decide for themselves whether this really looks like a ~$4.5
billion piece of software. The screenshot below is the employee login dashboard from the
Company's demo site.


The leader in the IT service management software business is currently BMC Software, a
profitable company with a 20+ year track record and a client base of over 50,000. While
BMC's Remedy software has historically been sold as hosted software under a license,
BMC has aggressively invested in its SaaS solutions and now has about 475 SaaS
customers. In the third quarter, BMC added 90 SaaS customers, giving it 23% sequential

quarter-on-quarter growth and demonstrating the customer buy-in of its SaaS solutions.
This growth rate was almost twice that of ServiceNow's customer growth over the same
period (126%). On its most recent earnings call, BMC discussed that when it bids for "a
competitive deal with one of our biggest SaaS competitor[s]," likely a reference to
ServiceNow, that "this last quarter we were at about a 60% win rate" (BMC Q2 F2013
Call).


In order to gain market share in the extremely competitive IT Help Desk market, NOW has
aggressively expanded its headcount and hired expensive sales staff. Compare NOW's
R&D investments with its sales and marketing annual spend. In the last three fiscal years
(year-end June 30th), ServiceNow reported $2.4m, $7.2m and $7.0m in research and
development costs (the product was first created in 2005). Compare this to $8.5m, $19.3m
and $34.1m of sales and marketing expense over the same periods. It's apparent that
ServiceNow has become a sales company, not a high-tech research business with a deep
technological advantage.


Contrary to what glowing analyst reports might lead investors to believe, ServiceNow's
software is not beyond critique. The Company's online service forum is full of complaints.
Even the trusted research group Gartner states that ServiceNow's "reporting, analytics,
and dashboarding capabilities are average" and that "the vendor struggles to balance
messaging of IT service management offerings versus platform-as-a-service capabilities."
As ServiceNow aggressively expands its headcount, it is also beginning to lose creative
employees. In August 2012, Chris Dancy decided to quit ServiceNow to join BMC as the
Director in the Office of the CTO. Mr. Dancy runs a heavily followed twitter account
(@ServiceSphere) and is widely considered to be at the forefront of social media in the IT
Help Desk space. Mr. Dancy joined BMC after seeing Remedy's MyIT product for the first
time.


II. An Absurd Valuation at 20x Revenue


Momentum shifts are not baked into ServiceNow's current valuation, as the Company is
effectively priced for perfection and the stock should waver at the slightest hiccup. Even
with a hoard of well-capitalized competitors, very serious product risks and material
growth hurdles, NOW trades at 21x LTM revenue. This multiple is higher than even
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at its IPO price. But more importantly, the Company is EBITDA
negative yet trades at offensively high 2013E and 2014 EBITDA multiples of 196x and
74x, respectively. At the current price, we believe that investors are accepting inordinate
amounts of risk for a mere 1.4% 2014 EBITDA yield (if NOW meets consensus estimates).

By comparison, BMC trades at 2.4x 2012E revenue and 6.6x 2012E EBITDA. BMC is
actually growing its SaaS customer base more quickly than ServiceNow.

customers... [we] currently have approximately 475 SaaS customers" 
Source: Company filings and earnings calls.


ServiceNow's recent third quarter earnings report proves that NOW is actually a slowing
business.


In the SaaS software sector, many analysts believe that billings is a better indicator of
growth than revenue. Billings, as reported by NOW and others, more accurately reflects
total upfront sales by including the deferred revenue of a subscription contract over its life.
ServiceNow's billings have slowed sharply from 23% sequential growth in the second

quarter to 13% in the third. The Company has not given billings guidance for the fourth
quarter, but has guided to revenue growth of ~10%. Even if NOW modestly beats its fourth
quarter estimates, any growth in billings lower than 13% would indicate that NOW's
revenue growth should soon drop below 10% sequentially, which is simply too low for a
20x+ LTM revenue multiple.


The IT Help Desk sector is one of the most competitive sub-segments of the IT Service
Management business. ServiceNow competes in a market still largely dominated by
industry stalwarts like BMC, HP, CA, and IBM. These market giants offer bundled product
offerings across all ITSM and ITOM product verticals, giving them a strong edge on
smaller peers, including NOW, who have more limited product offerings. The market is
also populated by smaller, private SaaS competitors such as Cherwell Software,
EasyVista, and Hornbill. According to a report from Gartner/Citigroup, IT Help Desk has a
market size of $1.5 billion and is only growing at 7%, a figure that is hardly enough to
justify NOW's 21x LTM revenue multiple. Wall Street estimates predict that NOW can grow
its market share from about 10% to 15% in 2011 to 35% in 2014 to reach a revenue
estimate of $530 million. Hitting these growth expectations will be extremely challenging
since switching costs are high and Help Desk functionality is largely commoditized across
competitive platforms.


NOW must grow market share by about 7%/year to reach the Street's 2013 revenue
estimates. As a data point, Salesforce.com has only been able to increase its market
share of the Customer Relationship Management software market by about 2-3% per
year, according to data from Gartner:


Aside from IT Help Desk, analysts cite adjacent opportunities in areas such as
Configuration Management, Workload Automation, and Asset Management to justify sky-
high NOW price targets. Configuration Management ensures that the components of an IT
ecosystem (user/software/network/server) are compatible with one another; Workload
Automation assigns the order in which 'jobs' or batch processes run through the

mainframe servers; and Asset Management is a financial tracking tool that itemizes all of
an organization's IT 'assets' (e.g. smartphones, laptops, servers, etc.). Our research
indicates that ServiceNow's existing suite of adjacent products (Discovery and Runbook
Automation) are inferior compared to offerings from the large incumbents (IBM, BMC, and
others) and that neither product presents significant near-term revenue opportunities.
Many of these adjacent software verticals are more technically complex than Help Desk
and require a greater depth of product capabilities within a wider IT framework. For that
reason, certain vendors can distinguish themselves by providing a full suite of integrated
software tools. This gives an advantage to software titans like BMC, HP, IBM, Microsoft,
and CA who have all established much larger beachheads throughout the IT suite.


Below is a helpful chart examining market share within the IT Operations Management
("ITOM") sector from Citigroup:

Platform-as-a-Service


NOW's promoters argue that NOW can distinguish itself from other SaaS competitors
through its single-code platform architecture. ServiceNow's CEO views the platform as a
"Trojan horse" (Q3 2012 Call) that is initially adopted for its IT Help Desk application and
then entices customers to purchase other NOW applications or utilize NOW's professional
services to add new functionality. We believe that this closed architecture could turn out to
be a fatal flaw as it complicates the addition of third-party applications. Indeed, we believe
that customers who want to develop customized applications via a PaaS offering would

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1006341-servicenow-decelerating-growth-limited-market-size-point-to-large-downside 10/28


prefer more widely-used platforms like Force.com and Google App Engine. Below is a
summary of certain PaaS solutions currently in market. We believe that NOW's platform is
heavily outmatched.


Thin Float IPO has Artificially Increased Share Demand


Underwriters of NOW's IPO initially anticipated an opening price range of $15- $17 and
the bookrunners ended up pricing the IPO at $18. NOW shares then traded up to $25 by
the end of a frenzied trading day, giving IPO investors an enviable 40% one-day return.


We suspect that the IPO was helped by its "thin float" nature. In the IPO, ServiceNow only
sold 13.4 million of its 123 million common shares, representing 10% of the float. This
figure is even smaller if one includes the 37 million stock options with a weighted average
strike price of $4.48. Taking into account these highly dilutive options and 1 million
restricted stock units, the fully diluted share count jumps to 158 million. We believe that
NOW's thin float may have contributed to the stock's inflated share price run.


Both Facebook and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) utilized similar thin float IPOs and investors
have only recently woken up to the risk inherent in these stocks during their pre lock-up
periods. In gifting institutional clients with one-day IPO stock pops, underwriters have
scattered landmines all over the technology sector.


Much of the Press, Analysts, and Financial Databases Overlook NOW's Highly
Dilutive Option Pool


One of the most appalling valuation mistakes that we've noticed with NOW is the
exclusion of the 37 million share pool ($4.48 strike price) of highly dilutive options from
market capitalization calculations. Some Wall Street analysts, as well as reputable press
sources, have excluded this option pool from their calculations of market capitalization,
thereby underestimating revenue multiples, amongst other valuation metrics. To us, this
seems like an embarrassing mistake; by excluding the dilutive effect of options, investors
would be overstating their valuation metrics by an incredible 27%.

We encourage investors to check their valuation sources thoroughly - frequently used
research tools like Bloomberg, CapitalIQ, and Yahoo Finance are all misrepresenting
NOW's market capitalization and price/revenue multiples.


III. NOW Faces Competitive and Structural Headwinds


SaaS Help Desk Competition has Intensified


The Market Leader: BMC Software


There's little doubt that BMC was too slow to embrace SaaS for the ITSM sector, and its
complacency allowed NOW to enter the market and steal market share. That said, BMC's
technological depth in ITSM is extensive, and we believe it has taken steps to stop the
bleeding. The company now offers a rapidly growing SaaS solution as well as an
OnDemand version of its market leading Remedy software. The pure SaaS product,
RemedyForce, operates within the Force.com cloud platform, making it convenient for
customers that already use productivity applications on Force.com. BMC has grown its

BMC's CEO, "RemedyForce is an area we're really going to be putting some more dollars
into and more focus on." (BMC Q3 2012 Earnings Call) For larger enterprise customers
who require greater customization, Remedy OnDemand is BMC's flagship product offered
over the cloud. This gives customers a choice between a secure, fully-customizable
hosted system and a simpler, configurable SaaS.


On Tuesday, October 30th, BMC launched MyIT, the newest addition to its Remedy suite
of products. MyIT is a social and self-service tool that integrates with Remedy to increase
productivity. Amongst other features, MyIT allows users to self-diagnose IT problems,
request the corresponding requests, and personalize their IT Help Desk application with
their favorite tools. MyIT also integrates seamlessly with mobile hardware, such as phones
or tablets, allowing the end-user to do things like request a conference room, access an
application, or request a webinar remotely. MyIT has received favorable reviews by
Stephen Mann from Forrester Research. Mr. Mann stated that, "[MyIT is] a great move by
BMC that pushes the proverbial envelope for ITSM tools." Chris Dancy, the widely-
followed ITSM executive who decided to quit ServiceNow to join BMC, says that MyIT was
"the real reason I joined BMC." Mr. Dancy is the #2 most-followed ITSM pundit in the
entire industry on Twitter (Mr. Mann is #1).

Finally, one of BMC's biggest advantages versus NOW remains its deep suite of ITSM
products. Many times, enterprise customers prefer a single vendor that offers solutions
across the IT service and operations management landscapes. ServiceNow may have a
strong IT Help Desk product, but it's still technologically immature in Configuration
Management, Workload Automation and its other ancillary product verticals. This gives
horizontally integrated companies such as BMC, HP and IBM a significant advantage over
upstarts like ServiceNow.


The Three Incumbents: HP, CA, IBM


BMC isn't the only incumbent making efforts to protect its existing customer base with new
SaaS offerings. Last week, HP announced the release of HP Service Anywhere, which
provides many of the same capabilities as HP's traditional ITSM offerings only under a
SaaS framework. HP has designed this product for "codeless configuration," which would
allow users to add functionality without having to know a programming language. This
could potentially give HP's product an edge over NOW for customers that want to lower
their implementation and coding costs. HP Service Anywhere also introduced a significant
social media component to its Help Desk suite. HP's Service Anywhere should make it
more difficult for NOW to poach existing HP users as it has in the past.


CA has also reacted to the ServiceNow threat with its CA Nimsoft Service Desk, a multi-
tenant SaaS solution that allows configuration while limiting in-suite coding. Should a large
enterprise customer require complex functionality, CA still offers its software in a
customizable, hosted instance. This multi-tiered product approach, as used by BMC and
HP, allows customers to choose between a more secure hosted offering or a SaaS-based
approach.


IBM remains a common brand of choice for large, complex enterprises that require a full
suite of IT functionality. IBM integrates IT Help Desk, Configuration Management, Asset
Management and Workload Automation through a single interface under its SmartCloud
network. The SmartCloud is available for a single price and easily integrates with 10
incremental "ITIL" (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) products, such as IBM
Rational and IBM Tivoli. IBM holds a leading 20 - 30% market share in many of these
more complex computing areas such as Network Management and Application
Development. ServiceNow does not have functionality in either segment, giving it a
material disadvantage for complex Fortune 500 clients.

Emerging Competitors: Private ITSM Companies


Moving beyond the large incumbents, several other private companies have recently
emerged as competitors to ServiceNow. Each of these companies has a core SaaS Help
Desk product supported by a few adjacent tools, putting their product depth in-line with
ServiceNow. Cherwell Software, founded by former executives of FrontRange, is another
strong SaaS competitor that is frequently overlooked by Street analysts, but often cited by
industry experts. Unlike ServiceNow, Cherwell offers an all-inclusive, concurrent license
rather than a piecemeal offering. This is a major selling point for some customers, who
feel cheated when ServiceNow attempts to upsell them additional modules such as
Discovery and Runbook Automation. Cherwell also owns its own data centers whereas
NOW is still in the process of transitioning to wholly-owned centers. Cherwell has done
well internationally; half of its sales are outside the United States. Cherwell can also
engineer its product as a PaaS, pitting it head-to-head with NOW at nearly every sales
pitch.


There are other competitors that could emerge to chip away at NOW's edge as the leading
SaaS provider of ITSM. One company we've heard great things about from independent
experts is the Europe-based EasyVista. EasyVista is the successor to Staff & Line, which
was founded in 1988 and has a deep heritage in the ITSM space. EasyVista has created a
well-designed, highly functional product that some believe shows innovation much like
ServiceNow did five years ago. EasyVista features a codeless SaaS architecture that
makes it relatively simple to configure. According to the company's website, non-technical
IT users can be trained to configure the product in under a day. EasyVista 2012 has been
updated for full integration between the help desk solution and configuration/asset

management, workflow automation, and other ancillary product capabilities. While
EasyVista is still expanding its sales presence in the U.S., our research indicates that it is
increasingly showing up in the final rounds of RFP meetings and could be primed to
disrupt NOW's growth trajectory. EasyVista currently boasts a customer roster with the
likes of L'Oreal, Mercedes Benz, HSBC, and Quicksilver.


Hornbill is a third name that repeatedly came up during our discussions with industry
professionals. Like BMC, Hornbill provides both hosted and SaaS ITSM software,
providing customers a choice between on-premise and SaaS. Going further with its
customer-centric approach, Hornbill's SaaS product is priced in three separate tiers
(standard, pro, and expert). The 'standard' solution allows those who prefer fast
implementation periods over complex customization to get their ITSM processes up and
running as soon as possible.


ServiceNow also faces opposition from the likes of Axios, LANDesk, SAManage,
FrontRange, Serena Software, SunView Software, and dozens of other ITSM companies.
Accordingly, we do not believe that ServiceNow has anything close to a monopoly in the
SaaS market, as many believe, but instead competes with numerous offerings.


We would also expect that investment bankers are currently banging down the doors of
the fastest-growing private ITSM companies given NOW's valuation. New IPO funding
could help companies like Cherwell become even more viable alternatives to NOW,
especially among enterprise customers. This would slow down NOW's market share
growth as well as pressure them on pricing.


ServiceNow's Ancillary Offerings Provide Very Little Revenue


NOW markets two ancillary products that it attempts to upsell alongside its IT Help Desk
software. While Wall Street believes that these secondary products can quickly gain
market share over entrenched competitors, these products continue to make limited
headway even after several years in existence. Discovery, the Configuration Management
tool that helps map server loads and computing operations, was launched in late 2007 yet
still only has 0.2% market share, according to a Citigroup July 24th report. We also believe
that this very low market share is not necessarily due to a lack of customers to cross-sell
to, but rather because of the software's lack of functionality.


A report on the Configuration Management market last year from Gartner doesn't even list
ServiceNow as a player in this market. We believe that the chart below is particularly
relevant since the $4 billion Configuration Management market size figure was put

together by Gartner itself, and they would therefore be best placed to define the
competitors for that revenue pie.

ServiceNow is nowhere to be found in the above diagram.


ServiceNow's other tool, aside from Help Desk, is Runbook Automation, a tool that
addresses part of the complex Workload Automation market (coordination of batch
submissions and other computing-intensive data processes). Runbook Automation also
has a meager 0.2% market share (Gartner/Citigroup figures) even though Runbook was
launched in late 2010. Frank Slootman, NOW's CEO, commented that for Runbook
Automation, "the penetration is less than 10%" (NOW Q2 2012 Earnings Call) of its
existing customer base. Slootman went on to say on the Q3 2012 earnings call, that "in
terms of the model, our principal source of upsell revenue comes from incremental users,
right, as opposed to incremental applications."


Below is the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation. Gartner lists twelve
competitors. ServiceNow is nowhere to be found. The world's leading technology research
firm does not consider ServiceNow to be a meaningful vendor in Workload Automation.

Much like Help Desk, these adjacent fields are highly competitive and heavily populated
by large enterprises as well as well-funded private companies. Data from Gartner supports
our skeptical analysis of the revenue opportunity for Discovery and Runbook Automation.


NOW's Platform-as-a-Service Offering Has Several Mortal Flaws


Broadly speaking, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products allow customers to integrate
numerous disparate software products (including SaaS) under a single dashboard. This
dashboard then manages each piece of software as an individual application. One can
think of a PaaS dashboard as being akin to the home screen on an iPhone. Much like the
App Store, the more applications that one adds into an ecosystem, the more valuable the
platform becomes. Market leaders such as Force.com have 220,000 different applications
made by leading software vendors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, Microsoft, Facebook,
and other developers who've become comfortable with the Force.com system.

As shown in the PaaS overview chart above, Force.com, Microsoft Azure, and LongJump
are all examples of open platforms. ServiceNow, on the other hand, uses a largely closed,
single-tenant system that does not easily integrate with outside software applications.
While this might allow additional customization in some instances, it limits the ability to
integrate best-of-breed tools that come from outside the ServiceNow ecosystem.


Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's CEO, has essentially conceded that NOW does not
compete head-to-head with more widely used platforms.


"The platform market itself is very difficult. I am not looking for out-and-out
confrontations with other platform vendors when I can roll the platform in the door
right behind our ITSM application portfolio. That is our strategy and that's the one
that's working for us, and that's the one that we're going to continue to follow."  
̶ NOW Q3, 2012 Earnings Call


We're skeptical that NOW's Platform-as-a-Service strategy will succeed. Competition in
PaaS is fierce. It's one thing to disrupt dithering incumbents like BMC and HP in the ITSM
sector; it's another to compete head-to-head with visionary, aggressive and well-funded
companies like Salesforce.com and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).


Single-Tenant vs. Multi-Tenant

The differences between single and multi-tenant SaaS are subtle but matter when
forecasting the future direction of the industry. Single-tenancy SaaS generally refers to
fully-customizable software that can vary between each customer (including a separate
database instance for each application); ServiceNow's customizable code firmly places
them in this category. Some of the independent experts that we've spoken with believe
that a multi-tenant architecture, or one where the underlying software is identical across
customers, is a better way forward for the SaaS industry. Without variation in the
underlying code, multi-tenant SaaS makes regular software updates much simpler for all
end-users. This issue is significant since many of NOW's customer wins have come from
clients who have been frustrated with the incumbents' cumbersome upgrades, and are
looking for predictable, straightforward software updates. Yet a single-tenant system would
typically involve complex upgrades given that different clients have customized their NOW
platforms with functionality specific to their operations. Additionally, single tenancy usually
involves substantial upfront coding costs and longer implementation times. For these
reasons, NOW may lose certain customers over time to SaaS providers who offer more
attractive multi-tenant solutions.


Conclusion


We congratulate ServiceNow for creating a niche IT service management product with
only $40m of R&D during the four-year period between June 2008 and June 2012. We
also commend JMI Equity for its 105x return and Sequoia on its 1300% return, at least on
paper. But recent moves by BMC, HP, and others to defend their turf in the SaaS space
will make it much more difficult for NOW to win customers at its current rate, expediting
the Company's growth deceleration. Several recently introduced products prove that in a
rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, ServiceNow does not have a
technological moat, nor should it be assumed that the Company can continue to grow
market share indefinitely. Somehow NOW has achieved a $4.7 billion market
capitalization, which is roughly the entire IT Help Desk ($1.4 billion) and Configuration
Management ($4 billion) sectors combined. Since NOW only has about 15% share in the
former and minimal penetration into the latter, we believe that investors have relied on pie-
in-the-sky investor presentations instead of grounded financial analysis.


We also do not believe that ServiceNow's Help Desk product is as ground-breaking as
many believe. The Company's single-tenant SaaS model is susceptible to many of the
same problems that have plagued hosted software, namely extended upfront
implementation periods, ongoing professional services fees to maintain the code
database, and high total costs of ownership over the cycle. While Fortune 500 customers

may expect to incur these problems to achieve their desired level of customization, we
believe that customers further down-market are becoming more sensitive to these issues.
Some of the more nimble multi-tenant SaaS can actually offer long-term cost savings and
rapid implementation cycles thanks to a simplified software platform. As ServiceNow
begins to expand its customer base beyond the low-hanging fruit (i.e. dissatisfied
customers seeking an alternative to hosted), these issues should increasingly come to
light.


These substantial growth headwinds combined with the Company's untenable valuation
should increasingly come into focus as NOW's venture capital investors seek to unload
their shares onto the public markets. In our opinion, the November 9th Amended S-1 is a
clear showing of bad faith by the initial VC investors as it pushes forward share sales that
were intended to be locked-up until December 26th, 2012 (according to the original
prospectus). The Amended S-1 contemplates the sale of 11.5m by insiders and the
issuance of 1.9m new shares by NOW itself, assuming that the full greenshoe is
exercised, the combination of which will double the Company's 13.4m float. With 158m
diluted shares outstanding, this offering only scratches the surface of the secondary sales
that will soon come to market. Should NOW's growth continue to retreat to more
sustainable levels, as is every indication, we believe that this selling pressure will only
exacerbate the sharp fall that we expect in NOW's share price.

Good report. It's hard to believe that in these uncertain times when many tech companies are trading at all time lows
in valuation NOW built a $4.5B market capitalization on the back of a mere $10M in R&D investment in 2011. This is a
software product, it's not like they are doing anything that BMC, HP or any of the other competitors can't match. It's
like something out of the dot com bubble.


The float essentially doubled today.

Well, for one you won't see those other tech companies double their revenue on an annual basis like
Servicenow has. Look at the latest filing and you will also see that R&D ramped up significantly. These guys
have literally taken over the ITSM space and business is NOT decelerating. A more telling number would be
looking at subscription revenue for the last 4 quarters. There are no signs of slowing down unless you count
backwards:


Q4 = 14% 
Q1 = 14% 
Q2 = 18% 
Q3 = 18% 
Q4 = TBD

Sour grapes and short sellers. Intrenched customers of BMC are leaving in droves for ServiceNow. The article states
that there are 50,000 customers in the space yet it's only a $1B market? Conservative revenue growth would put
NOW at $1B in three years. Well run software companies make 30% net. 123.4M shares x $28/share = 3.5B market
cap / $300M net = Forward P/E of 11.67.

Author’s reply »  Let's look at your $1bn revenue by 2015 projection.


Here are sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rates over the past few quarters: 
3-31-12: 21.1% q-o-q revenue growth 
6-30-12: 19.7% 
9-30-12: 13.3% 
12-31-12E: 10.3%


As we can see, growth has been decelerating sharply, for all the reasons we discuss in our report. The most
dissatisfied BMC, HP and CA customers have already switched to NOW. Some of NOW's current customers /
partners are realizing that the sales pitch they'd heard initially doesn't fully match their experience:
implementation takes longer than they'd expected, javascript programmers are costing them too much money,
upgrading requires more programming support due to the single-tenant nature of NOW and the customized
features they've added.


As a result, growth should continue to decelerate. Given that QoQ growth was 13% in Q3 and projected to be
10% in Q4, it's reasonable to assume it decelerates to 8% by end of 2013 and 6% by end of 2014 onwards.
And this is a best-case upside scenario.


If you assume these growth rates, you get to $600m to $650m revenue by 2015. Let's take your 30% net, and
we get $200m. The current market cap isn't $3.5bn, it's $4.9bn. There are 37m of options with an avg strike
price of $4.48. At a NOW share price of $30m that's an extra 32m of shares, which equates to $950m of
market cap.


So at $4.9bn market cap and $200m of net income, we're looking at a valuation of 25x 2015 P/E. Not 2012
P/E, but 2015 P/E. And at that point, NOW's growth opportunity will be much lower than today. Even CRM

has never traded more than 10x revenue, and it's typically between 6x-8x, and it addresses much larger
markets in the client relationship management and PaaS space. NOW services a much smaller market. It
shouldn't have a market cap that's 25% of CRM's.

Every year revenue has pretty much been doubling, just look at the history; your future projection
assumptions are askew. There is no denying revenue growth has been explosive which is projected to
continue. Their average revenue per customer has continued to trend upward quarter over quarter as well.
They achieved all of this with a tiny sales force, and they have been making significant additions to their sales
team to match demand. You painted this as a weakness in your article that they are morphing to a sales
driven company - the reality is that sales drives growth! All of the 11 major analysts covering NOW have 1
year target estimates rated from $27 to $40 with a consensus mean target of $34.11 and growth estimate of
105% for next year. Even if you take the low target of $27 we're pretty much there at these levels - the big
money to be made in shorting has already happened from when the stock was trading in the $40+ levels.
Who's right - you or the 11 analysts who do this for a living? At the very least NOW is a hold from here.

Whether you're correct or not, comparing Kerrisdale to sell side analysts is a bad comparison. Look at all the
analysts defending stocks like QCOR, TPX, DMND, ZNGA, SKUL...the list goes on and on. With very few
exceptions, sell side analysts are incredibly over-optimistic on stocks. The way analysts look at stocks, is they
think of the best possible scenario for a company, do a discounted cash flow analysis, and make that their
price target. You always hear of analysts saying things like: "buy this stock on weakness" and "selloff is
overdone", but I'll bet you've never heard an analyst say: "short on strength" and "this stock is overbought."


I can think of three reasons why sellside analysts behave this way:


1. An analyst will get more exposure with a positive rating on a company than a negative one. The company
and shareholders are more likely to spread the word about a positive review about them, because they want
to attract more investors to push the stock price up. The analyst with a negative review will be ignored.


2. If an analyst badmouths a company, that company is unlikely to go to that analyst's firm for help with a
share offering or merger/acquisition deal.


3. A sellside firm's clients are usually long-only, so they don't want to talk bad about a stock just in case a
client has a position in it, and they want to give their clients plenty of investment ideas.

ServiceNow's service desk product does indeed have multi-tenant design despite the claim in this article. I've seen it
in production with my own eyes. The "6-8 month" implementation is for organizations that are inept. IF an organization
has well defined business processes, it can customize ServiceNow's service desk cloud-app to fit in only 2 or 3
months. Again, I've seen this with my own eyes. Now I am wondering how much other false information is in this
report.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks Sen. Service-now themselves has classified their product as single-tenant, as
shown on slide 13 of the linked presentation. http://slidesha.re/XdHjKB


While you are certainly right that implementation time can vary for each customer, the 6-8 month time range is
ServiceNow's figure, not ours. Please see the bottom of page 38 of NOW's March 2012 S-1: 
"Most of our professional services engagements span six to eight months." 
http://1.usa.gov/W9TSjS


Separately, in our discussions with industry consultants who advise customers choosing between vendors
and help them on the implementation side, we've also heard of plenty of customers experiencing 6-month
implementation.


That said, we certainly expect that some customers are able to conduct an implementation at 2 or 3 months.
We wrote that "Should a customer require customized functionality, as many do, it can take 6-8 months (page
38 of the initial S-1) and tens of thousands of dollars in implementation costs to get NOW's system up and
running."


Although some customers can take 2-3 months, that doesn't change the fact that NOW is wildly overvalued at
20x 2012E revenue.

I agree, by reading this article looks to me that this person is not a professional. A lot of this information looks
like he is trying to confused customers from using this great ServiceNow application.

Did you also analyze Salesforce.com (CRM) as an overvalued stock ?


All these 'cloud' seems to be highly valued...

Clever article but misleading and factually incorrect in many places. For example you compare RemedyForce growth
in terms of customer numbers but in practise BMC is winning mainly small customers with this platform and is giving

Salesforce a slice of every sale as they dont own the platform. Revenue or no of seats would be much more telling.

Author’s reply »  BMC's RemedyForce customers are indeed smaller when compared to NOW's average
customer, from what we've heard from the industry professionals we've spoken with. But RemedyForce is
another example of increasing competition that's going to contribute to NOW's growth deceleration. We're not
arguing that NOW doesn't have a commendable product, but that the current $5bn valuation is preposterous.
Frankly, NOW's growth has already decelerated enough to demonstrate that it's not worth anywhere close to
$30/share, and we think that the QoQ growth deceleration is only going to continue further in future quarters.

There are some good points in this article - I think it highlights some risk areas for ServiceNow and everyone in the
ServiceNow ecosystem would be wise to heed them -- including myself.


However, I think the article completely underestimates ServiceNow's platform play. What ServiceNow offers is unlike
anything from Google or Amazon or Microsoft -- it is more like Force.com but still quite distinct and I would argue
superior.


The article claims single-tenancy to be a weakness -- and perhaps to a small or medium-sized customer it is. But to a
Fortune 500 customer, having an isolated environment should be seen as an advantage, from a stability and security
standpoint.


The knock on ServiceNow's "openess" and lack of integrations ability is completely baseless. The range and flexibility
of integration capabilities in ServiceNow is unmatched, from my experience.


So, if you consider their platform and integration technology assets, I think betting on continued major growth is a
reasonable bet. Certainly warrants at LEAST a HOLD if not a BUY.

Your report was looking credible up until the point you went into the details of the of the software and it's underlying
platform. Having sold in this space (ITSM) for more than 11 years including with all of the legacy players, I can tell you
first hand there are a number of fallacies in your report...and no, I do not work for Servicenow - I just did a ton of
homework on my competition. Have you looked at their CMDB? That's the heart and sole of ITSM and the golden
source of data for the help desk. Their competition doesn't hold a candle to what Servicenow offers. As a former
competitor, I've had my hat handed to me more than a few times on that feature alone and the flood of references
they have never helped. Also, upgrades do not get any easier than with servicenow, regardless of the amount of
customization users make since all customizations are preserved through the upgrade process - it's right there on
their website complete with tons of testimonials. Have you seen their wiki and online forums and user community? It's
all in the open for the world to see and it's evident their clients love the technology when you read through it. Are you
aware of their high (95%+) client retention rates on renewals? Their success was not only driven by a solid product

but also how they embrace their clients and work with them on continually evolving the product for the betterment of
the community - this also ensures customers are successful with their products. No other company does that like they
do. They even provide a full working base release on their website that any prospect can access - the product speaks
for itself...


You also called out the fact that they do not even appear on Gartner's Magic quadrant for Workload Automation. Just
a few short years ago they weren't on the quadrant for ITSM either, and in that time they've turned the industry on it's
head. They forced their competitors to try similar SaaS delivery methods but they don't even compare at this point.
You've got the analysis of their Platform all wrong too regarding integration with other technologies. More than half of
their customers have leveraged its extensible nature to develop their own applications and integrate with existing
systems (it's right there on their website, testimonials and forums). Their velocity does not appear to be slowing either,
if anything it's picking up. I sell in a different tech space these days but I can tell you their buzz is increasing all the
way to the CIO and CFO level. Nothing comes even close the level of functionality offered for the price.


I'm just scratching the surface here on why your "article" paints a distorted picture of the company and technology. It
seems pretty pervasive these days for anyone to start their own little smear campaign with the hope of reaping profits.
In the tech industry we commonly called it FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to steer customers away from our
competitors. I guess in the world of the stock market it's the opposite of pump and dump, which is short and distort.
From the Motley Fool Wiki: The "Short and Distort" stock manipulation scheme is a lesser known, and less common,
variant of the Pump and dump stock manipulation scheme. 
In this strategy, the scammer sells short a stock, and then ether produces or hires someone to publish negative
material about the company. The scammer then sends this information to random individuals, usually in the form of
paid mailers, spam stock touts or fax blasts. Once enough investors fall for the con and sell their stock, the scammer
covers at a profit.

Shorting and distorting only works in a case of possible fraud in a company. It doesn't work when questioning
the growth of a multi billion dollar company, the market is too smart for that. You'll have to wait until real
information like the next earnings report to see if Kerrisdale is right or not. But given the consistent sequential
qoq growth rate declines so far, I'd be pretty nervous if I was long.

Author’s reply »  We appreciate your contribution to the discussion. Those that we have spoken to in the
industry seem to have a more mixed opinion on the upgrade cycle. Some experts have publicly questioned
the long-term feasibility of the update sets:

The intention of our article was not to unilaterally criticize ServiceNow's product. Instead, we wanted to point
out that this is not a "one-size fits all" industry. Just like its competitors, ServiceNow has its strengths and
weaknesses.

But most importantly to our investment thesis, a strong product does not always equal a smart stock
investment, especially at these prices.

Not that subtle how you laced in BMC endorsement. Basically, this is BMC propaganda and not technically, or
financially accurate.

just short NOW.

like Oracle and SAP?

Great article. I think the best short sale candidate list would be every cloud vendor who did a thin float IPO. Like
shooting fish in a barrel I would think.

I went through your article and I could detect a few fallacies in your article. To begin with you have only looked at
ITSM Help desk which is just the call center piece for an IT department. There is also the Non Call center piece.
Together all these constitute the IT Management Market. That market alone is over $10 B, last time when I checked
which was a couple of years ago it was $ 18B as I did my own research on the same. The 3 parts that constitute are
IT Service Desk , IT Asset Management and IT Project and Portfolio. Dont forget that they constitute Application
lifecycle Mgmt which is the very basis of IT Mgmt. I have been in this space long enough where I have seen the
capabilities of ServiceNow and they are really good....

Unabashed short seller, looking for negative in search of personal gain. Swimming against the tide of the cloud or
dismissing the benefits is like selling short on innovation...RIM vs iPhone/Apple, AOL vs. Google, Siebel vs.
Salesforce.com, Myspace vs. Facebook.... 
Better tell CISCO they paid too much for Meraki.
