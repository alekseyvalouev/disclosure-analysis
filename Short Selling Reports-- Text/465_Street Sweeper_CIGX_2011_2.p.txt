Star Scientific: Blowing Smoke While Investors Choke?

The article below is the second in a two-part series. Click here to read the previous story.


Give Jonnie Williams, the CEO of recent highflier Star Scientific (Nasdaq: CIGX), some
credit. By now, records indicate, Williams has proven that he can literally sell anything –
cars, houses, contact lenses and, above all, risky medical stocks – even if his customers,
particularly investors, often wind up on the losing end of those business deals.


Over the years, Williams has clearly polished his act. Early on, records show, he found
himself sanctioned by securities regulators for allegedly paying a stock promoter to issue
bullish reports on a doomed biotech company while he was secretly dumping a big chunk
of his own shares. Since then, however, he has learned to distance himself from
AGGRESSIVE stock promotions that seem to magically erupt (along with his current
company’s shares) without any obvious involvement on his part.


Take Star, for example, a combination tobacco-biotech play that boasts a market value of
$600 million – more than 700 times its prior-year sales – even though the company has
spent almost a decade operating in the red. Star has more than doubled since the
beginning of the year, rocketing from $2 to $5 this spring alone and overcoming a recent
slide (which took it back below $3) to climb back toward the $5 mark once again.


The stock peaked at $5.35 on May 31, when it closed above $5 for the first time in years
and paved the way for Williams to exercise millions of newly issued options – priced below
$3 a share – in the process. Williams and his family already owned more than 20 million
shares in the company (including stock options and warrants) even before that, records
show, a massive stake worth almost $100 million based on current market prices. He
recently signaled plans to sell about 1 million of those shares in official corporate filings
that registered more than 12 million shares sold earlier this year, for $2 or less, through
the latest in a series of dilutive private placement deals.


Meanwhile, as the top executive of Star – a former cigarette company now pursuing
miraculous breakthroughs in the healthcare arena -- Williams has spent more than a
decade refining and perfecting one of his most powerful sales pitches of all. In the original
script, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported long ago, Williams somehow outsmarts Big
Tobacco – with its gigantic research budgets and its fancy Ph.D. scientists – by developing
a safer tobacco-curing process after experimenting with his microwave oven. He then

sues industry powerhouse R.J. Reynolds (NYSE: RAI) for utilizing a similar system, the
Associated Press has since explained, seeking massive damages from the tobacco giant
for allegedly infringing on the patents for his remarkable invention.


For almost a decade, the Times-Dispatch later noted, that story has served as the primary
driver behind Star shares – alternately sending them above $5 and below $1 – as the
dramatic, yet inherently unpredictable, courtroom fight continues to unfold.


A few years ago, faced with a string of nasty legal setbacks that threatened its very
survival, Star essentially swapped that worn-out script for a more compelling story. In this
version, LOUDLY trumpeted by speculative bulls, Williams has managed to outsmart Big
Pharma – once again besting a deep-pocketed industry with massive research budgets
and stables of well-trained scientists – by uncovering a tobacco-based substance that
promises an effective new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.


That story, bolstered by strong endorsements from even an established stock picker, gets
even better. By focusing on a so-called “nutraceutical” (the glorified term for a nutritional
supplement) rather than seeking regulatory approval of an actual drug – a real challenge
for a tiny company that spends a pittance on research and development – Star could not
only beat giant pharmaceutical companies to the market with a promising Alzheimer’s
treatment, BREATHLESS fans proclaim, but the company could also realize that dream
within a matter of months and see its market value instantly skyrocket into billion-dollar
territory as a result.


Based on an outstanding share count of 134 million -- a number that keeps exploding
because of Williams’ incredible marketing skills (and excludes warrants and options for
another 40 million shares) -- Star would command at least $7.45 a share under that
scenario. Once Star broke past the magical $5 mark this spring, however, skeptics began
to see possible signs of yet another temporary spike that could backfire on hopeful
investors once again.


“Some of its most bullish backers think shares have room to run much higher, so it’s
certainly worth further research,” David Sterman of StreetAuthority.com, a well-read
financial website, wrote a few months ago. “But you should also know that this stock
surged in 2000, 2005 and 2009 to $5 – only to give back those gains every time.”


In the end, he concluded, “will this time be different?”


Star failed to respond to a long list of detailed questions submitted by TheStreetSweeper
ahead of this two-part investigative report.

Smoke and Mirrors


Until last year, when Star suddenly enjoyed newfound status as a biotech play, the
company relied on its long-running legal war against tobacco giant RJR – with damage
estimates rising into the billions over time – as the primary magnet drawing speculative
investors to its highly volatile shares. That story, including a colorful prologue compiled by
The Boston Globe years ago, dates back more than three decades and goes something
like this.


Long before Williams ever launched Star, the Globe revealed back in 1988, he established
himself as “one of the best salesmen ever to hit his hometown” in Virginia by shattering
records at a local car dealership and a nearby real estate office. With the help of an
entrepreneurial ophthalmologist named Frank O’Donnell Jr., the newspaper reported,
Williams then started his first business – Colonial Opticians – where he wound up fined for
fitting contact lenses without a license before eventually abandoning the optical shop and
its pile of unpaid bills.


After that, the Globe said, the pair teamed up to start several health-related companies
that actually went public and then ultimately went bust. They started with an outfit called
CME-SAT back in the early 1980s, the newspaper reported, capitalizing on their
connections at Johns Hopkins University (where Williams sought, but never received, a
graduate degree) by selling stock to college professors who starred in educational films
produced by CME-SAT before the young company failed.


“Their repeated stock purchases kept the company afloat despite almost continuous
losses,” the Globe later explained. “Those purchases also paid O’Donnell and Williams
substantial salaries for the few years they remained with the firm.”


The pair began dumping their stock in the company two years after it went public, the
newspaper reported, and then promptly resigned to start two new companies – including
one that would later morph into Star itself – in the months that followed. The first company,
Spectra Pharmaceutical Services, went bankrupt five years later. The second, originally
known as Eye Technology, languished as an obscure penny stock until executing a
reverse merger with Star Tobacco and Pharmaceuticals (since renamed Star Scientific) in
early 1998, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported at the time, when it exploded onto the
market as a $6 cigarette stock.


Together with his sidekick O’Donnell, the Globe further revealed, Williams launched a
couple of other public companies during the 1980s as well. (One of those, identified as
C.A. Blockers, hatched a futile plan to commercialize a safer cigarette before Star later

adopted that same business strategy.) They took yet another company public in 1991, this
one catching the attention of Barron’s in a separate investigative report, with regulators
ultimately cracking down on Williams – along with a Florida brokerage firm that helped
with some of those stock offerings -- a couple of years later.


By then, the Globe indicated, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had grown
suspicious of almost every public company started – and often later abandoned -- by the
two serial entrepreneurs.


“Neither O’Donnell nor Williams has stayed anywhere long,” the Globe observed in the
meantime. “And almost everywhere they have gone, trouble has followed.”


The latter finally paid a price in 1993, the newspaper later reported, when both federal and
state regulators sanctioned Williams – identified in government records as a “Florida stock
promoter” -- for allegedly financing a publicity campaign that allowed him to sell
discounted shares in one of his doomed companies (bankrupt Spectra) at artificially
inflated prices. Years later, a 1998 news report shows, his attorney Paul Perito – now the
longtime chairman of Star – would portray Williams as a naïve kid, suffering from dyslexia,
who wound up duped by medical researchers connected to the company.


“Jonnie was 32 at the time,” Perito declared in that story. “He was a child.”


Either way, Williams apparently learned his lesson. After that, records show, he displayed
newfound discipline by largely sticking with one company – overseeing Star through more
than a decade of turbulence – and carefully keeping his distance from those who
AGGRESSIVELY PROMOTE its stock.


O’Donnell gradually faded from the scene in the meantime, records show, scoring millions
by selling his family’s big stake in Star along the way. He has spent the interim years
leading his own risky biotech outfits, records show, overseeing Accentia
Biopharmaceuticals (ABPI.PK) and its subsidiary Biovest International (BVTI.PK) – two
penny-stock companies that trade on the lowly Pink Sheets for about 50 cents apiece –
through bankruptcy, the local Tampa Bay Business Journal revealed, and losses that
continued to escalate even after that reorganization effort. O’Donnell still held lingering
connections to Star during that period, corporate filings show, sharing ownership with
Williams in an airplane leased to the bleeding company for business trips and rights to the
patented technology that sparked the high-stakes legal battle with Big Tobacco that
continues to this day.

Since Williams and his partner usually focused on health-related companies, a past story
by the Richmond-Times Dispatch indicates, they wound up in the deadly tobacco business
almost by accident.


About two decades ago, the newspaper reported, the pair assumed control of a small
cigarette maker that owed them some money and then later took the company public with
bold promises to revolutionize the tobacco industry. Just weeks before merging into Eye
Technology (a thinly traded Pink Sheet company) and debuting as the newly public Star
Tobacco and Pharmaceuticals (now Star Scientific), corporate filings show, the company
had secured exclusive rights to use a patent-pending “StarCured” process for the creation
of less harmful tobacco products. Williams himself had invented that process years earlier
when experimenting with his microwave oven, the Richmond Times-Dispatch later
reported, and had just patented the technology with plans to charge big tobacco
companies – pursuing safer cigarettes of their own – handsome licensing fees for access
to his breakthrough.


“America’s major cigarette companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars --
perhaps billions -- researching the same problem,” the Times-Dispatch stated years ago.
“The jury’s still out, but some experts think Williams has outsmarted the big boys.”


When Star actually took its case to court, however, a federal judge – followed by a real-life
jury – reached the opposite view. The first big blow came in 2007, American Lawyer
reported that year, when a judge declared Star’s patents unenforceable because evidence
(including a damaging letter from one of the company’s own consultants) indicated that
the technology was not new. The judge also found “clear and convincing proof of an intent
to deceive” by the company, American Lawyer added, while expressing “substantial doubt
as to the professional independence” of a law firm that received “a substantial amount” of
stock options for securing the disputed patents in the first place.


When the judge issued a preliminary judgment in favor of RJR earlier that year, records
show, Star lost almost three-quarters of its market value – with its stock plummeting from
$4.17 to $1.16 a share – over the course of a single day. Star closed below $1 for the first
time ever less than two weeks later, records show, and ended that brutal year with its
stock hammered all the way to just 80 cents a share.


Star responded to that legal setback by establishing a new business focused on tobacco-
based breakthroughs in the medical arena, records show, giving the company a back-up
plan in case its appeal of the devastating verdict ultimately failed. That same year,
corporate filings show, Star further scaled back its presence in the tobacco market by

abandoning its once-profitable discount cigarette business – which had generated more
than $175 million in annual revenue at its peak – and selling its primary hard asset, almost
1,000 special tobacco-curing barns, to local farmers as well. (Star borrowed $29 million to
finance those barns more than a decade ago, records show, and still owed almost a
quarter of that sum – with all of the barns now gone – at the end of last year.)


Star staged a surprising legal comeback the year after exiting the cigarette business,
records show, when it successfully overturned the judge’s ruling and arranged for a jury to
decide the case instead. By the spring of 2009, the Richmond Times-Dispatch observed,
the stock – fueled by confident forecasts of a big legal victory – had fully recovered from
its 2007 hit and was fast approaching $5 once again.


Thanks to that powerful rally, records show, Star’s longtime chairman managed to score
almost $3 million in gains by cashing in 1 million cheap stock options – and immediately
selling the underlying stock -- just days before those options were set to expire.
Meanwhile, during a three-month period punctuated by that well-timed sale, one
particularly bullish analyst issued at least five different research reports indicating that
investors should buy and hold the rising shares instead.


Otis Bradley of Gilford Securities began recommending Star at $2.67 in early March of
2009, records show, and kept recommending the stock every few weeks – his enthusiasm
mounting – as it marched straight toward (and ultimately beyond) the long-elusive $5
mark. By the time he issued the last of those upbeat reports, published while a jury
deliberated on a verdict in the high-stakes legal case, Bradley was already calculating
damage awards of at least $2.2 billion for the company and proclaiming that “high-risk,
highly speculative accounts should double up (on the stock) at current levels.”


Star peaked near $6 that same day, records show, but soon fell back below $5 a share.
Less than three weeks after Bradley urged speculative investors to double-down on the
stock ahead of a likely multibillion-dollar damage award, records show, the stock went on
to suffer a devastating blow – plunging almost 75% to barely $1 a share in a single day
(with more than half of its shares changing hands) – when the jury sided with RJR by
declaring Star’s patents invalid instead.


Stripped of its powerful litigation story, the sizzling hype fast cooling to lukewarm, Star
soon looked like nothing more than a fading niche player in the tobacco arena – forced to
scale back marketing of its once-celebrated tobacco-based lozenges due to “slower-than-
expected sales” – with little to attract the speculative investors who once embraced its

5/23/2018 Star Scientific: Blowing Smoke While Investors Choke? - Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RCPI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/278092-star-scientific-blowing-smoke-while-investors-choke 7/16


stock. Star fielded a delisting warning from Nasdaq in the months that followed, its stock
soon sinking to an all-time low of barely 50 cents a share, and seemed to finish the year
with at least one foot (if not both) firmly planted in the grave.


New and Improved


Instead, records show, Star took bolder steps into the biotech arena and – injected with a
fresh dose of hype – pulled off a miraculous resurrection that pumped new life into the
gasping company.


After raising millions through yet another dilutive private placement in the spring of 2010,
Star proudly announced that it had signed a “research and royalty agreement” with the
Roskamp Institute to formally test its tobacco-based agent as a revolutionary new
treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. By then, records show, Star had already flown back to
$3 a share after stock promoter John Faessel – now the company’s MOST RELIABLE
AND VISIBLE BULL – declared it his “New Best Idea for 2010.” Faessel actually began
trumpeting Star’s agreement with Roskamp before the company itself released that news,
records indicate, while pointing to the venture as the likely driver behind a recent surge in
both the trading price and volume of the company’s rejuvenated stock.


Star then scored an even stronger endorsement when it officially announced that deal,
with an influential stock picker rushing out a bullish column – boldly entitled “Did Star
Scientific Just Find a Cure for Alzheimer’s Disease?” – that predicted a near-term
breakthrough for the company and a corresponding breakout for its stock price.


“This product can be in the market in two to three months,” declared James Altucher, a
New York portfolio manager who built up a strong following during his years as a regular
contributor to TheStreet.com. And “I think this news could ultimately drive the stock to the
$15 to $20 range.”


Although Star instead sank back toward $1 the very next month, the stock responded
much better when Altucher followed up this March (almost a full year later) by publishing
another bullish column with an even more sensational headline – “Star Scientific Just
Announced They Cured Alzheimer’s Disease and Nobody Cares” – indicating that the
company may have, in fact, achieved its lofty goal.


“I’m encouraged by the (Alzheimer’s) results, even if I am discouraged with the totally non-
promotional way they are disseminating the news,” Altucher wrote in his new update. “This
is the opposite of a pump and dump. Heck, I wish they would be a bit more promotional.”

5/23/2018 Star Scientific: Blowing Smoke While Investors Choke? - Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RCPI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/278092-star-scientific-blowing-smoke-while-investors-choke 8/16


Star officially stuck to its conservative script, however, while a growing crowd of vocal bulls
worked magic on its shares.


The company won particularly frequent and favorable reviews from Faessel, RECORDS
SHOW, a former dentist (reportedly sued by a prominent client years ago over eight-figure
stock-market losses) who regularly supplies bullish research to a promotional website
known as SmallCapInsights that makes money by publicizing risky penny-stock names.
Less than two years earlier, for example, Fassel touted NXT Nutritionals (NXTH.OB) –
later exposed by TheStreetSweeper as an overhyped penny stock – in two glowing
reports published by SmallCapInsights after it received 450,000 shares of restricted stock
(supplemented by cash payments) from the company. NXTH skyrocketed from barely $1
to more than $3 a share over the course of the next few months, records show, but soon
plummeted – losing more than half its value in a single day – and now languishes below
10 cents a share.


Faessel introduced Star as his new favorite after NXTH plunged below $1 for good,
records show, with other speculative stock players eventually joining him with fawning
reviews of their own. Patrick Cox, the author of a popular biotech newsletter, added his
voice to that swelling chorus this spring, records show, after his self-described “good
friend” John Mauldin – a past target of securities regulators (who has partnered with a
penny-stock outfit to pitch a miracle cure for wrinkles) – reportedly passed along some
exciting research about the company that ultimately led to a personal meeting with its
colorful CEO.


“Williams has absolutely no doubt about the nutraceutical he has discovered,” Cox wrote
after that meeting. “If you’re accustomed to speaking with extremely careful scientists, as I
am, he’s nothing like that. Nothing.”


But Williams delivered such a powerful story, followed by an impressive tour of the
Roskamp Institute and discussions with its research scientists, that Cox reportedly
overcame his early skepticism and became a true believer instead. He spent a dozen
pages gushing about Star in the next issue of his influential newsletter, records show,
expressing solid faith in the company’s proposed treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (even
spinning it as a possible weapon against deadly cancer as well) while portraying the firm’s
leader as an accomplished entrepreneur with a proven record of success.


“I remember when Jonnie Williams invented the tobacco-curing technology that
dramatically reduces carcinogen toxins,” Cox proclaimed. “He financed that research, by
the way, with a small part of the fortune he had made as a major investor or co-founder in

several successful biotechs.”


As detailed above, however, Williams has spent a decade trying to prove that he actually
created that curing process and has recorded more telling defeats than victories in that
legal war so far. He also launched more biotech failures than successes, records indicate,
even if he managed to personally strike it rich – while ordinary investors lost – along the
way.


Star itself has so far managed to escape that dismal fate and keep resurrecting its volatile
stock, regularly lifted by the hype of BULLISH promoters with the power to ignite its
shares. (Two years ago, records show, Star actually appeared on a list of stocks allegedly
manipulated by a now-defunct brokerage firm indicted on fraud charges.) With the help of
its charismatic leader, Star keeps staging fresh comebacks – and raising fresh cash – by
selling big dreams that, for more than a decade now, have yet to come true.


“Jonnie Williams could sell a snowball to an Eskimo,” one of his former employees stated
in a local news story cited by The Boston Globe years ago. “But when it comes to backing
up what he was selling, now that was another story.”


Disclosure: Through its members, TheStreetSweeper began establishing a financial
position in CIGX on June 22 and will profit on future declines in the share price. It currently
holds the following positions in the stock: 800 contracts for the July $5.50 puts purchased
at an average price of $1.18 apiece; 350 contracts for the July $6 puts purchased at an
average price of $1.54 apiece; and a total of 49,300 shares of CIGX stock sold short at an
average price of $4.79 a share. TheStreetSweeper will sell the CIGX puts it acquired and
cover its short position in the stock at a future date. It will update this disclosure when
those transactions occur. As a matter of policy, Melissa Davis – the editor of this website

* Update: TheStreetSweeper closed out its short position in CIGX on July 5 through the
following transactions: selling its 800 contracts for the July $5.50 puts at an average price
of $1.21 apiece; selling its 350 contracts for the July $6 puts at an average price of $1.62
apiece; and covering its short position in CIGX common stock by purchasing 49,300
shares at an average price of $4.52 a share. TheStreetSweeper will be looking to
establish a new short position in CIGX if the stock moves higher, and will further update
this disclosure with the details of any future trades as they occur.

More biased hyberbole from the most irrelevant woman on wall street. There is simply no mention of the major
elements of this business that longs are invested in. I think I'll stay invested in the guy who can sell ice to an eskimo.


Star's YTD return is roughly 150% because investors chose to view the whole story. This woman has been attacking
this stock for a week now and had zero effect. Her opinion has proven to be irrelevant.

great points in this story. nice conversational style.


institutional buyers profit from pump and dump. they trigger the glissade (ha!). can't rely on them, sell button at the
ready when the hysteria really starts stinkin up the room.


if it gets pushed below $4, perhaps it all unwinds for those who got in at sub $2, only to be picked up again when it is
sub $2, for the next ride.

Not a single mention of these shorts buying Cigrx and testing it on people with inflammation issues or to help people
quit dipping or smoking. This will really come back to haunt them. Hedge funds continue to test Cigrx and get
miraculous results. this is why the stock goes to $20. Non of the babble above matters. Everyone already knows this
stuff. CIGX is probably severely under valued bc of this old info.


06 Jul 2011, 10:04 AM

Shane,


I see this as a hit or miss stock based upon the RCP-006 compound. The results should be out soon since it
has been tested since last October. Ten months is a long time. The law suit would be nice if they can win it,
but any monetary reward, like a lot of other things, is already built into the stock price.


The Cig-Rx product was a flop when rolled out in their home market, wasn't it? What makes you think it will be
a big winner? What hedge funds are testing it? I did a GOOGLE search and couldn't find a single hedge fund
testing the product. Perhaps you can give me a newsletter where such information is published?


06 Jul 2011, 02:27 PM


Shane Farley, Contributor
Cigrx wasnt a flop at all. They are seeing encouraging results in their test market and they are now rolling it
out nationwide. I think it will be much bigger than Chantix. The slow launch is likely bc CIGX is making sure
everything is safe and to get feedback from roskamp, Johns Hopkins, dr's giving the stuff out, etc. The
nationwide rollout tells me that they haven't seen any issues from the 100k people who have tried the stuff.


I'm not going to name names but I know people who manage money who have seen very impressive results
when testing Cigrx. To start with, I had a big operation on my foot several years ago. So, I decided to test
Cigrx on the inflammation issues with my foot that plague me daily. I was amazed. taking 4-5 pills maybe 4
times a day reduced the inflammation in dramatic ways. I promise you....I was as skeptical as anyone. But
now I'm convinced the stuff works great on inflammation. I then gave some CIGrx to my brother and cousin
who have both been dipping for over 10 years.....miraculously they were both able to quit dipping and the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/278092-star-scientific-blowing-smoke-while-investors-choke 12/16


praise they gave CIGrx was amazing. I literally said to them "How often do you come across a product that
actually works like this in such a big and important way?" From there I talked to a friend who manages money
who gave it to his biz partners mom who was suffering from a fatal form of arthritis and guess what.....she is
basically cured. The results were amazing. On top of this J. Williams thinks that Cigrx cured his wife of thyroid
disease. Roskamp purchased the stock bc of rcp-006's ability to regulate inflammation - not just for the
treatment of alzheimers. RCP-006 could be bigger than celebrex. Spend a few minutes researching all the
diseases linked to inflammation issues and you will likely want to cover your shorts. RCP-OO6 could be a
blockbuster anti-inflammatory.


At the end of the day, what happened with Cigrx is that when people started trying it many reported great side
effects. People talked, gave feedback to CIGX, and they took it to Roskamp. The story is unique bc investors
can just buy Cigrx themselves and test it themselves. Its funny that you and your short buddies never once
even mentioned even trying Cigrx. If you want to know some of the funds who have tested Cigrx just call the
guys managing the funds who have big stakes. You will probably be surprised.


Test is yourself. Buy some and give it to 5 people with arthritis and 5 people who really want to quit smoking.
Not only will you close your short position, you will buy cigx stock.


BTW, CIGX IR hates me. I've complained and raised a lot of questions and issues, many which you touched
upon. They wont call of email me back. It doesnt matter though, I tested the stuff myself and was amazed.


06 Jul 2011, 06:57 PM


Harry Beck, Contributor
Shane,


Got it. I will order some today and try it.


Meanwhile, you didn't name a single hedge fund that you claimed has been testing it. You claim to "know
people who manage money" but can't list a name. You claim the rollout was a success, yet the revenue
reported is dismal. You claim the nationwide rollout is "encouraging" with no information to back it up (If you
had such information it could mean you obtained material non-public information ahead of the rest of us). Do
you see why I don't take these claims seriously?


What the heck, I'll add to CIG-Rx revenues and order some of it. We shall know soon enough if it is selling
well.


06 Jul 2011, 07:07 PM


Shane Farley, Contributor
Harry, CIGX and Roskamp already told you that RCP-006 works as an anti-inflammatory. Read the patent
application for everything they think it can work for. You just convinced yourself it must be bogus bc of all the
other crap associated with Star. I totally thought the same thing until I did some small testing myself. Any fund
manager with half a brain would buy cigrx and test it themselves. this is what makes the story interesting.
Didnt you notice how altucher talked about taking cigrx himself? its only a guess, a total guess, but i bet
dozens of fund managers are buying this stuff and trying it.

I bet you were surprised seeing the stock go up after such amazing hit-pieces from thestreetsweeper.com. i

this is totally a guess but I wouldnt be surprised if the roskamp institute or their archer pharma spin-off could
be the big buyer of shares. robert roskamp buying shares could have just been his small personal side bet.
Again - this is just a total guess!!!


try it yourself! you will see........

GLEN ALLEN, Va., Feb. 9, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ –


Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Star Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: CIGX) announced that on
February 4 a provisional patent application was filed with the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) for
administering a pure form of a single isomer of anatabine, “S-(-)anatabine”. This isomer can be administered
in a composition containing a therapeutically effective dose of anatabine to treat chronic low-level
inflammation. Low-level chronic inflammation has become an increasingly significant area of scientific
research during the past decade. Time magazine, in a February, 2004 cover story entitled “The Secret Killer –
The Surprising Link Between Inflammation and Heart Attacks, Cancer, Alzheimer’s and Other Diseases”,
described chronic inflammation as the “engine that drives many of the most feared illnesses of middle and old
age.”


The provisional patent application discloses that S-(-)-anatabine is useful in reducing the inflammatory activity
that results in elevated blood levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive Protein (“CRP”).
Inflammatory markers like CRP can be used by physicians to aid in deciding a course of treatment for an
individual at risk for an inflammatory disorder or disease, as well as in determining doses of anatabine to be
administered and in monitoring treatment of various inflammatory diseases. S-(-)-anatabine has the potential
to be particularly useful for treating disorders involving inflammation that is associated with Nuclear Factor-
KappaB (NF-kB) mediated transcription. NF-kB is a transcription factor that operates in cells and participates
in the immune response. NF-kB mediated transcription is associated with numerous disorders, including
those with inflammatory components, aberrant immune response and/or inappropriate cell proliferation. The
provisional application indicates that the disorders which may be treated with this discovery include
inflammation occurring in brain swelling or neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple
sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.


Recent work at the Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida, has shown that S-(-)anatabine differs in potency
from the racemate and is supportive of further development of S-(-)anatabine. Curtis Wright, IV, MD/MPH,
Chief Medical Officer of Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, stated, “We believe that this intriguing development
holds within it the seeds of a new drug, and that this preparation of the an active isomer in a commercially
viable form is a positive outcome toward that goal.”


Star Scientific also is working with McColl Partners LLC on structuring a controlled auction for bidding by
pharmaceutical companies for licensing and/or co-venturing relationships. McColl previously has advised the
company on a range of corporate finance matters, including the assessment of strategic initiatives involving

Shane,


Thank you for all the posts. Please remember that I am not the author of the two articles and only an
individual investor.


I gather you do not have the names of the hedge funds you previously said were testing Star’s products. I do
realize that the RCP-006 agent does have beneficial properties that reduce inflammation to some degree, and
that this agent holds promise. I also know too well that testing is done on many agents and drugs that hold
great promise, yet few find their way to the market. I guess you believe RCP-006 is the one that hits and I
remain much more skeptical. As far as CIG-Rx goes, we also disagree. The next 10-Q will see who is right.


I disagree about big institutional buying coming into the stock today. There is no evidence of that, nor is there
evidence of any big selling. The stock hasn’t moved much in the last few days and is slightly above where it
was three months ago. I see a better than average potential for a short squeeze, and that has me on the
sidelines (I still think the stock is way overvalued). I feel far more comfortable shorting a stock like LPS than a
microcap with a feverish following when attempting to hit my targeted 120/40 portfolio mix.


What continues to interest me the most about this stock is similarities (call it a "flash" moment) to a couple of
other shorts I have had in the past. The blatant bashing, name calling, harassment (posting of anonymous
identities on message boards), etc. reminds me stocks that eventually soured. A perfect example is a post
below (not the one from you). This kind of stuff just isn't found in most threads. Anyhow, we will both know
more after the next 10-K. I'll post again then.

I have no proof of this but I bet you anything that Tradewinds Fund, Goldman Capital, etc have all purchased
Cigrx and tried it themselves. I told you i tried it. Altucher told you he was taking it. That faessell guy told you
he was taking it. Richard sharp who has a fund just became a director. That is what makes the story
interesting, rcp-006 is already being sold in cigrx that people can freely try themselves. Of course fund
managers are trying it.


I'm on your side regarding the blatant bashing, message board stuff, etc. It's almost like Star wants to look like
a scam......I've tried to question and criticize Star IR but they won't call me back. I hate so many things about
this stock including the lawsuit. I wish this was a $2.50 stock without any lawsuit stuff going on. I'd be buying
more shares. The threat of losing the case is the only thing preventing me from buying a big stake in Cigx.
Instead I just have a small position.


When the stock moved from $1.50 to $4 on huge volume someone was buying shares like crazy. The name
of the bih buyer(s) hasn't emerged.


Last thing I want to say is that people should just buy cigrx and try it themselves. The magic controversial
compound is already being sold so it can be tested by anyone. Any good investor or short would do this
before buying shares.

I just want to get this straight -


It's NOT OK to talk about the successes a company has had, particularly if that discussion could lead to the share
price going up. That would be known as PUMPING and is a BAD THING.


However, it IS OK to take multiple positions whose success hinges on the price of the stock dropping, then writing a
very long story with a very unhappy ending about the stock for the sole purpose of providing yourself and whatever
friends you may have with your own happy ending. This would be known as DUMPING, and is a GOOD THING?


Why don't you go out and buy some more Puts? Maybe I'll be the one selling them to you. That would be MY HAPPY
ENDING.

How in the world can this pseudo journalist write this crap. I have never seen a more bs article anywhere. Why does
John Hopkins have favorable views? How can Roskamp have such favorable views? Because the compund works.
Period. No amount of lies and distortions from this BS org strreetsweeper will change the facts that cigx works. This
(b)witch can lie all she wants and attempt character attacks and assination to try to push for profits from their short.
This (b)witch has no credibility and this organization she wroites for has klost all cred as well. Why waste space
publishing her when she is such a comsumate liar

This story is very interesting, from all sides. I'd love to know how well CigRx is selling, once you subtract out all the
sales to investors on SA wanting to know if this could be a ten-bagger! I also would like to know if/when Roskamp will
publish a formal study of the effects of anatabine. The story was interesting enough to me to buy at $4 and sell at
about $4.50. I've tried CigRx myself, and felt it gave me minor relief of my constant lower back pain, but no better than
ibuprofen. My wife believes it has helped her arthritic knees. But a few anecdotes are not worth anything compared to
a carefully controlled study, so I await Roskamp's report with more than casual interest. I exited my position for all the
reasons given in this article - to summarize, that there are serious questions regarding the CEO's integrity. Perhaps
even a scam artist can get lucky and make money the honest way, and I hope it turns out so in this case. But for now I
will watch this show from the sidelines. Good luck to those who are long this stock.
