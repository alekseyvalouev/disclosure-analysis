BioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI) - Money Losing Opioid 


Company Founded By The Bankruptcy Experts 


Introduction: 


We are short BioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI), a money losing opioid manufacturer that is 


connected to Dr. Frank O’Donnell, Jonnie Williams’ long-time business partner.  Frank and Jonnie are 


two individuals whose companies have a 30-year history of stock wipeouts (Source), SEC investigations 


(Source), shareholder lawsuits (Source), and even bribery of a governor (Source).  Frank O’Donnell has 


been prominently involved in BDSI, initially as one of the co-founders and CEO and recently as the 


Chairman of the Board.  Through our work, we discovered that Jonnie Williams is also involved in BDSI 


and has been a significant shareholder throughout the years.   


BDSI borrows business practices from the Insys & Purdue Pharma playbooks (two notorious opioid 


manufacturers) that resulted in DOJ convictions of doctors and company representatives.  BDSI’s 


questionable business practices involve both the paying of questionable doctors and providing of co-pay 


cards allowing consumers to get access to free opioids.  However, BDSI has an important difference, 


which is that they lose money hand over fist.  They currently burnt through $6.5 million of FCF from 


operations in the last quarter Q3-2018, $30 million over the last 12 months, and have a $344 million 


accumulated shareholder deficit (Q3-18 pg 1 & 4). 


The background of the highest paid doctors from BDSI are questionable (ProPublica – Doc Dollars; CMS 


OpenPayments Database).  Their top-paid docs include doctors who: 


 Have had their home & business raided by the DEA and had previously lost their medical license 


for substance abuse (cocaine, opiates, and alcohol). 


 Received high amounts of Insys kickbacks and were prescribing high levels of Insys’ Subsys 


drug and were named in Senate documents for doing so. 


 Committed medical malpractice (Source). 


 Used false credentials (Pergolizzi – LA Times Story) 


 And have Caribbean Medical Degrees. (Source) 


We have also found legal language in BDSI’s 10-k that suggests that if Belbuca is ever successful then 


Teva will be able to sell a generic version much sooner than management has indicated.  Belbuca, a class 


III opioid, is BDSI’s only hope for a successful drug and was recently sold back to BDSI from Endo 


Pharmaceuticals for a mere $7.5 million. 


Another major red flag is that Cherry Bekaert (of MiMedx fame) is BDSI’s long-time auditor.  MDXG is 


currently attempting to restate their last 5 years of financials for which Cherry Bekaert had given 


unqualified financial opinions and approved.  Additionally concerning as it relates to oversight is the fact 


that the “independent director” that is the head of BDSI’s audit committee is on the board of another 


Frank O’Donnell OTC company, HedgePath Pharmaceuticals (HPPI:OTC). 


Insiders are voting with their wallets.  They don’t appear to believe the company’s story, as they have 


either been selling or have filed to sell their stock.  Importantly, Frank O’Donnell has consistently been 


selling shares, which based on his 30-year track record of shareholder wipeouts, is a good indication that 


it is time to sell.  Broadfin Capital, a 17% owner of BDSI that was in charge of the recent overhaul of the 


Board of Directors has also filed to sell 100% of their shares at prices below today’s market price.  We 


think that the Broadfin sale will occur shortly after Q4 results are released.

We are short BDSI because (1) Frank O’Donnell and Jonnie Williams are involved; (2) it is a money 


losing business at the center of the opioid crisis; (3) management engages in questionable business 


practices such as paying doctors with bad reputations and providing reimbursement cards for the co-pays 


on opioids; and (4) insiders are selling their stock.   





Dr. Frank O’Donnell - The Key Figure at BDSI Involved in 30 year 


History of Shareholder Wipeouts & SEC Investigations. 


Frank O’Donnell and his business partner Jonnie Williams have a 30-year plus investment history of 


public company wipe-outs.  However, the deals have been profitable for Frank and Jonnie because they 


have historically been able to sell out before the stocks collapse and pay themselves exorbitant salaries 


along the way.  Frank is best described as the puppet-master behind the scenes.   


Frank O’Donnell is one of the founders of BDSI and is currently a director of the company.  He served as 


the CEO (until 2005), on the Board of Directors (2002-present), and was Chairman of the company 


(2002-May 2018).  Importantly, Frank O’Donnell has been selling a lot of shares.   


BDSI has paid Frank $9.95 million over the last 5 years ($1.77 million in cash and awarded $8.2 million 


in stock & options) (Source 2013-2017 proxies). The average compensation for other directors during this 


time period was $58k cash and $201k all-in per year.  Frank has been paid ~990% more than the average 


director for his board service at BDSI as he oversaw $179 million of FCF burn during that time.  


Frank O’Donnell is Jonnie Williams’ Long-Time Business Partner: 


Companies that Frank and Jonnie have been involved in together have a colorful history.  Two of their 


enterprises ended with SEC investigations: (1) Spectra Pharmaceuticals was charged for a pump & dump 


– profits were disgorged without admitting wrongdoing (1994) and (2) While Frank was Chairman, 


Lasersight’s CEO was charged with fraud by the SEC (Frank had previously been the CEO).  Another 


company, Star Scientific, ended with the Virginia Governor being found guilty of corruption after Jonnie 


admitted to paying the governor bribes to promote their product (2013).  Additionally, they were involved 


in 10+ complete shareholder wipeouts.

Even Frank’s own ex-wife, Katie O’Donnell, accused him of marital FRAUD and the courts agreed with 


her (Source – Line 8).  Frank was found to have transferred assets in order to hide them from his wife and 


remove them from their estate.  


Newsweek described Frank and Jonnie’s investment strategy in the following words (Source): 


“They would take over a medical-related product or service company, proclaim it had developed 


a medical breakthrough without providing reliable data to prove it, pump up the stock price with those 


false claims, pay themselves generous salaries and options out of proceeds from stock offerings, then sell 


their shares before leaving behind a company that collapsed in financial ruin.” 


~Newsweek – January 23, 2014 


This is nothing new.  Frank & Jonnie have been up to this for a long-time.  While Frank O’Donnell is less 


well known than his long-time and notorious business partner Jonnie Williams, The Boston Globe did an 


exposé on the two of them back in 1988 (link).  





Jonnie Williams and Frank O’Donnell have been involved in almost all of each other’s deals since the 


early 1980s.  Jonnie does not officially have a role at BDSI but has shown up as a significant investor in 


past filings.

Old proxies show that Jonnie Williams has been involved in BDSI! 


We found Jonnie Williams hiding within the BDSI capital structure within a shell investment company, 


Hopkins Capital Group II.  Hopkins Capital Group has mysteriously been able to stop reporting their 


interest levels in BDSI too.  In 2004 Jonnie showed up as a 16.5% owner of BDSI via owning 1/3 of 


Hopkins Capital Group II, LLC, which owned 44% of BDSI when it went public (2004 Proxy Pg 3 & 4 


note 2 – see below). In 2007, BDSI stopped disclosing who beneficially owned Hopkins Capital Group II, 


LLC only stating that Frank O’Donnell controls the stake and was partial owner, allowing Jonnie 


Williams to hide from public eye within the capital structure. 


Hopkins Capital Group fully disappeared from the public eye in November 2016.  Hopkins Capital Group 


stopped disclosing stock sales because Frank O’Donnell removed his name as “Manager” from the 


investment company and disclaimed his interest in his shares.  This move apparently resulting in Hopkins 


Capital Group no longer being required to report share sales to the SEC and investors (2017 Proxy pg 8).  


At that time, Hopkins Capital still owned 1.28 million shares of BDSI (Form 4).   Additionally, Jonnie 


Williams’ family trust shows up in the 2011 filings as owning shares directly in BDSI, which was 


reported because Frank O’Donnell was the trustee of the “Jonnie R. Williams Trust” (2011 Proxy pg 86 


Footnote 3). 


The Bankruptcy Experts - A Brief History of All of Frank 


O’Donnell’s and Jonnie Williams Past Companies: 


CME-SAT (1983) – Training videos for medical specialists. 


Shareholder results: -100% (Bankruptcy) 


Frank’s Position: Chairman of Board & Medical Director 


Lawsuits/Regulatory Involvement:  Court records show universities & teaching hospitals threatened to sue 


and withdrew support of CME-SAT when the universities realized they had been deceived by Frank and 


Jonnie in multiple ways (see Globe article). 


Frank and Jonnie results: They made more than $1.2 million through stock sales; reportedly also paid 


themselves high salaries.

wrinkles and dry eyes. 


Shareholder results: -100% (Bankruptcy) 


Frank’s Position: Co-Founder and 10% owner (Boston Globe Article) 


Lawsuits/Regulatory Involvement: The SEC and Massachusetts Securities Division separately charged 


Jonnie Williams with fraud for doing a pump & dump with Spectra (Source).   SEC also alleged that 


Spectra distorted the truth about the benefits of their eye solution.  Jonnie agreed to a disgorgement of 


$294,844 of profits with SEC and a $100,000 penalty with Massachusetts Securities Division. (SEC vs 


Jonnie Williams et al – 93-12789JLT, D Mass).  


Frank and Jonnie results:  Frank and Jonnie made more than $1 million.  According to the SEC 


complaint, Frank sold 696,000 shares while paying for “seemingly independent” research reports touting 


Spectra stock that were mailed out by Frank and Jonnie.

Lawsuits/Regulatory Involvement:  SEC charged Lasersight’s CEO after Frank, KC Wong, with 


embezzling from the company using fake consulting transactions; he also used sham transactions to 


circumvent Reg S requirements.  Wong consented to an SEC order without admitting wrongdoing.  (SEC 


Settlement Order) 


Star Scientific (1998-2016) (STSI) (AKA Star Tobacco, AKA Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals – 


RCPIQ) – Star Tobacco was started with defunct C.A. Blockers manufacturing facilities.  It originally 


sold discount cigarettes and claimed to have less toxic tobacco (this was never proven) (Source).  The 


FDA and Independent researchers found the claims to be bogus (Source), so the company pivoted from 


tobacco to dietary supplements.  It later focused on a “miracle drug” dietary supplement called Antabloc, 


which supposedly alleviated ailments of Alzheimers and multiple sclerosis but no test data/clinical studies 


proving these claims were ever released.  (Source) 


Shareholder results: -100% (Bankruptcy) Rock Creek (aka Star Scientific) finally filed for bankruptcy in 


2016.  (Source) 


Frank’s Position:  Frank was a board member of Star Scientific and Frank and Jonnie owned 60% of the 


stock in 2000 (Source). 


Lawsuits/Regulatory Involvement:  Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was found guilty of 


corruption as a result of Star Scientific’s Jonnie Williams bribing the governor in exchange for 


government favors for Star Scientific (Source – The Atlantic).  Jonnie used the governor to help market 


the “miracle drug” and create a sense of credibility for the unproven product.  Jonnie received immunity 


to secure his testimony against the governor. 


Other Notes:  Frank had Star Scientific lease a private jet from him and Jonnie Williams from 2005 to 


2009.

Insiders are Cashing out! 


If history tells us anything about a Frank O’Donnell company is that you should be selling when Frank 


does!  Frank has been selling shares hand over fist.  He has sold an estimated $842,000 of shares within 


the last year at prices as low as $2.14. (Source) 


During the last run-up in BDSI’s stock price in 2013-2015, Frank successfully used the opportunity to sell 


a large amount of his & Hopkins Capital’s shares.   


Additionally, after the close on the Friday evening of MLK weekend, Broadfin Capital, the other major 


insider, filed to sell $50 million of common stock (Source).  That is 17.26% of the company and all of 


Broadfin’s stock!  We think Broadfin can start selling as soon as Q4 results are released. 


This is especially important because Broadfin Capital invested in the preferred Series B shares in May 


2018 and have been a major part of the turnaround story that Wall Street is pitching.  Instead, this shows 


that they want to completely sell out.  Broadfin’s filing to sell all their shares does not give investors 


much confidence that Belbuca, the company’s only current growing drug, can take over the opioid 


market.

Other insiders are selling too: 


Broadfin Capital’s sales are especially important because sell-side analysts credit Broadfin for being a 


positive catalyst in the middle of 2018 and getting new management and board members involved.  


However, apparently Broadfin is ready to sell just 7 months after joining the board.  We place less 


credence in the Broadfin-led turnaround since the company has been a >5% shareholder of BDSI since 


2013.  This is a time period during which Frank began his cash and stock pillage of BDSI. 


Head of Audit Committee is involved in another of Frank’s 


Companies: 


Another board member, W. Mark Watson, is also on the Board of HPPI, the microcap company 


controlled by Frank O’Donnell (Mark Bio).  He has remained a board member at BDSI (BDSI Board) 


after the Broadfin shakeup and is also the Chairman of the Audit Committee (2017 Proxy pg 14).

Auditor Red Flag – Cherry Bekaert’s of MDXG Fame 


In 2017 BDSI utilized some accounting magic and despite this were only barely able to record a net 


profit.  BDSI reported an interesting $27.3 million bargain purchase gain on the $7.5 million deferred 


cash purchase of Belbuca from Endo.  This was at a time when the company desperately need to raise 


capital and with this write-up they could only manage to report $5 million of net profit. 





So who was the auditor responsible for allowing this large accounting write-up on a non-cash purchase?  


None other than Cherry Bekaert, which has served as their auditor since 2003 (FY-2017 pg F-3).  You 


may be familiar with Cherry Bekaert as the auditors that were made infamous by MiMedx (MDXG), a 


company embroiled in DOJ, VA, and SEC investigations.  MDXG also currently does not have an 


accounting firm to audit their financials.  Cherry Bekaert was the last auditor to provide MDXG with an 


unqualified GAAP audit opinion in 2016 (FY2016 pg 49), which means they approved their GAAP 


accounting and had done so since 2008 (FY2008 pg 41).  This is interesting and relevant because MDXG 


is currently in the midst of material financial restatements for FY 2012 through 2016 and their quarterlies 


from 2017, as they have been accused of channel stuffing, paying kickbacks, etc.  MDXG’s most recent 


auditor, Ernst & Young, even quit, citing deficiencies in internal controls and that they could not trust 


management statements (MDXG 8-k).   


If you haven’t followed the MDXG saga, then all you need to know is Cherry Bekaert’s recently received 


a scathing inspection by the PCAOB that identified a multitude of failures in their audit procedures 


(Source – Pg 5 & 6) and that Cherry Bekaert’s median market cap for their clientele is $22 million (list of 


clients here). 


We have noticed that besides the large asset write-up that BDSI has some other questionable accounting 


practices.  Interestingly, BDSI recently changed their revenue recognition accounting practices in January 


2017 to recognize revenue on a sell-in basis rather than sell-through.

BDSI CFO Turnover   


BDSI just replaced their long-term CFO, Ernest DePaolantonio, whose CPA license expired in 1994 


(CPAverfiy.com) with Terry Coelho, a CFO who only at her previous job at Balchem Corp for less than a 


year on the job. (Source). 





BDSI’s Top Paid Doctors – DEA Raids, Former INSY docs, 


Malpractice, and Fake Credentials: 


Basic Google searches and state medical board reviews of the top-paid BDSI doctors reveal shocking 


details!  The doctors who are received the highest cash payments from BDSI have recently been raided by 


the DEA, have appeared in Senate reports regarding Insys’s kick-back payment scheme, have committed 


malpractice, have abused significant others, have falsified their own credentials, and one has a degree 


more fitting for a cruise ship doctor’s than BDSI’s top rep.   


The company currently pays doctors to promote their products, Belbuca & Bunavail.  This practice is 


legal but the creation of the government’s Open Payments database (here) and ProPublica’s Dollars for 


Docs website allows investors to dig into who the company is paying honoraria (cash) to in order to 


promote their products.  In BDSI’s case, the results are shocking, as they are either purposefully choosing 


shady doctors or just haven’t bothered to research whom they are paying.   


Raided by DEA + Substance Abuse Problems - Dr. Ralph Thomas Reach who is a top 5 payee by 


BDSI had his home & medical facilities raided by the DEA on May 2, 2018 (Source, Knox News).  He 


also had previously lost his medical license in Virginia due to cocaine, alcohol, and opiate abuse (VA 


Board of Medicine Report).  Despite his history of drug abuse BDSI decided he’d be a great 


representative of their product and had paid him >$106,000 in order to promote their own opioid 


products.

Received large Insys kickbacks & appeared in Senate Report – A top 5 paid doc by BDSI in 2017 is 


none other than Dr. Anthony Guarino.  He became known as having been paid exorbitant sums by Insys 


Therapeutics in their kickback scheme ($106,000 from 2013-2015 and >$250,000 in 18 months in 


2009/2010 – Insys Senate Report pg 19).  According to the US Senate staff report on Insys (pg 22-27) this 


correlated with Dr. Guarino’s writing of a significant number of prescriptions for their Subsys fentanyl 


spray.   


Negligent medical practice + allegedly physically abused girlfriend - Dr. Richard Soper, another top 5 


payee by BDSI from 2013-2017, was previously found to have engaged in grossly negligent medical 


practice and to have falsified his credentials and malpractice history to hospitals.  (Tennessee Medical 


Board Docket No. 17.18-34-1337A).  If that isn’t disturbing enough we also found out that he allegedly 


assaulted his girlfriend who was an employee.  Although the charges were dropped due to apparent 


connections with a local DA and judge, Dr. Soper admitted via text message to his friends and family to 


having assaulted her (Story here).  


Mislead about credentials in presentations - The top payee in 2017 was Joseph Pergolizzi, who was 


exposed in an LA Times OxyContin Story in 2016 for using false credentials when travelling the globe to 


try to convince foreign doctors to prescribe more opioids.  They found that Dr. Pergolizzi had been 


claiming to be a faculty member at Johns Hopkins, Temple, and Georgetown Medical Schools.  In reality, 


he hadn’t been affiliated with Georgetown since 2010, Temple since 2014, and is an adjunct professor at 


Johns Hopkins.  A Temple spokesman said the university had “no reason to believe he will have any 


future relationship” with the school, and a Georgetown spokeswoman said, “We are not in discussions 


with that gentleman.” 


More Insys Connections - Another top 5 payee in 2017, Dr. Richard L Rauck was also previously 


connected with Insys, as he was the head author and researcher of multiple of the Subsys studies that were 


funded by Insys.  (2014 Fentanyl Sublingual Spray Study, 2010 Subsys Trial Results). 


Caribbean Medical Degree - Dr. Michael Frost has been the highest paid BDSI doc from 2013-2017 


receiving >$250k.  The main red flag we found is that Dr. Frost lacks a medical degree from a US 


institution.  He received a MD on the Caribbean island of St Martin at the American University of 


Caribbean School of Medicine.  (Source) Looks like a fun place to study (Cool!). 


Due to the fact that Belbuca was sold back to BDSI and relaunched in Jan 2017 we do not have the data to 


crosscheck recent doctor payments against the Medicare prescription database to figure out if the highest 


paid doctors are writing more prescriptions.  (Medicare data is currently only available until 2016).  


However, this choice of doctors to represent BDSI shows some very questionable judgement at the very 


least.

BDSI’s Chief Medical Officer – Dr. Thomas B Smith’s History of 


Failed Companies + an Arrest 


Before joining BDSI Thomas B Smith MD has his own checkered past of companies: 


 Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals - Chief Medical Officer at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals from May 


2012-Sept 2014.  He was the CMO when Questcor was acquired in April 2014.  If you are 


unfamiliar with the Questcor/Mallinckrodt story we suggest you revist Citron Research’s archives 


(Citron MNK Write-ups) 


 Ameritox – Chief Medical Officer - Oct 2014-Jan 2017 – Company ended up with an “asset sale 


and closure of all company operations and facilities” (Source) 


 Charleston Laboratories – Chief Medical Officer - Jan 2017 to July 2018 – FDA rejected their 


major opioid pain drug application in August 2017 and Daiichi Sankyo gave back all rights to it 


back to Charleston Laboratories. (Source, Charleston Lab Press Release) 


Although we aren’t surprised that Thomas B Smith MD has had such a shaky history since his medical 


career seems to have started off with a run in with the law.  While he was doing his medical internship in 


Indiana we found that he (or someone with his same name, approximate age, and in the same city) was 


arrested on an outstanding warrant.  According to Dr. Thomas B Smith’s LinkedIn he received his 


Medical Degree at Indiana University in 1986 and did his internship in Indianapolis from 1986-1989. 


Welcome to BDSI Dr. Smith, you will fit right in! (Dr. Smith joined July 30, 2018)

BDSI – Dispelling the Bull Story: 


All of Frank O’Donnell and Jonnie Williams’ companies have good “promotional stories” around them.   


The BDSI narrative used to be about using their BEMA solution (drug delivery film patch placed on inner 


cheek) to deliver Fentanyl in their drug Onsolis.  Eventually the government pulled Onsolis from the 


market due to quality issues (source) and the FAERS database also showed lots of Onsolis patients were 


dying.  Now Belbuca is the main story.  Management have tried to pivot from being a cause of the opioid 


crises to saying that “Belbuca is the solution to the opioid crises.”  


Belbuca Overview – The market is currently valuing BDSI as though Belbuca is worth $350m, even 


though BDSI bought back the Belbuca license from Endo for $7.5 million.  Our analysis will show the 


drug is likely worth closer to the price at which Endo sold it. 





Belbuca is a class III opioid narcotic.  Investors can learn more about Belbuca here.  The delivery system 


is reliant on the patented BEMA delivery system whose major patent expired in 2016.  The FDA has also 


given the drug a fairly small window of use by suggesting it should only be used when other immediate 


release opioids don’t work or can’t be tolerated.   





The actual labeling says that it is only meant to be used for patients that not only have “pain severe 


enough to require daily around-the-clock, long-term treatment with an opioid” but also when “other 


pain treatments such as non-opioid pain medicines or immediate-release opioid medicines do not 


treat your pain well enough or you cannot tolerate them.” (Link to FDA Label) 





Although Belbuca is still unprofitable after including marketing expenses prescriptions have grown 


significantly, allowing management to spin the tale that this could potentially be a $200-million-a-year 


sales drug.  This impressive prescription growth has been due to a salesforce ramp-up, and we will show 


multiple reasons why if this drug is ever profitable that, it’s growth will collapse. 





Reason 1 - Competition from Teva coming due to “Certain Circumstances” – Investors and analysts 


in BDSI should dig into the “certain circumstances” that allow Teva to get access to create generic 


Belbuca sooner than management has indicated to investors. 


After extensive litigation with Teva, which was planning to apply for an ANDA to create a generic 


Belbuca, BDSI and Teva settled in early 2018.  BDSI’s declared the settlement as a huge win and their 


press release highlights that Teva receives rights to produce generic Belbuca in 2027 (Feb 6, 2018 Press 


Release).  However, in the 10-k (pg 51), BDSI lawyers qualify that Teva can also produce generic 


Belbuca under “certain circumstances.”  One of those certain circumstances is:   


(iii) the occurrence of certain conditions regarding BELBUCA® market share 


We interpret this to mean that if BDSI successfully grows Belbuca market share above a certain 


percentage, then Teva will automatically be granted the license to create a generic.  BDSI claims that 


Belbuca has a 31.1% market share of the buprenorphine patch market in Dec of 2018 (Slide 14 – Jan 2019 


presentation).  For example, we suppose that getting above specific market share number like 50% (just 


when BDSI finally might be profitable) it would kick in the Teva clause that allows them to produce a 


generic.  We have asked management to clarify, but they have not responded.  All we know for certain is 


that Teva will be able to produce a Belbuca generic much sooner than expected if Belbuca ends up 


gaining significant success.

Reason 2 – Other Competition - Defending the Patents - The main patent on the delivery system for 


Belbuca is BEMA (US Patent 6,159,498) and it expired in Oct 2016.  The company received extensions 


of the BEMA patent for Onsolis (7,579,019), but that expires January 2020 and they received a further 


extension for Belbuca, which is on-patent (Source).  We think that expiration of the BEMA patents 


already provides solid ground for generic companies to challenge the validity of BDSI’s Belbuca 


extension patent.  The generic companies seem to think the patent portfolio is at risk, too.  In addition to 


Teva mounting a challenge earlier in 2018, Alvogen has also filed an ANDA to produce generic Belbuca 


in Sept 2018 (Source) and Chemo Research did in March 2019 (Source).   


Other competition in the buprenorphine space is coming from Purdue Pharma.  Purdue Pharma is 


supposed to be the Belbuca partner in Canada.  Instead they have recently patented their own fast acting 


form of buprenorphine.  (Source) 


The other major product that BDSI sells is Bunavail, which has seen this exact fate occur: its own Rx’s 


and sales numbers declined after Suboxone ANDA applications were approved.  (Source)  


Reason 3 – Patients Rate Belbuca Poorly 


According to WebMD Reviews Belbuca receives extremely poor ratings from patients. It gets 2.5 stars 


for effectiveness, 2.5 for ease of use and 2.3 for satisfaction.  


Reading the reviews you will find patients complaining of: 


 The drug being ineffective on their pain. 


 Lasting for only 2-3 hours (significantly less than the 12 hours claimed). 


 Taking a long time to dissolve in their mouth (some complained of up to 1.5 hours). 


 Difficulty with delivery (does not stick to cheek). 





These are very bad reviews compared to other opioids: 


Buprenorphine-Naloxone (Suboxone) – 4.3 starts effectiveness, 4.3 ease of use, 4.0 satisfaction 


Butrans Transdermal Patch – 3.5 stars effectiveness, 4 ease of use, and 3.3 satisfaction

Growth Strategy Flawed – Purdue Pharma Being Sued by Massachusetts AG for Same Strategy 


BDSI management is trying to convince investors that their growth strategy will win since they believe 


their salesforce can convince doctors that Belbuca is a safer opioid, which will get doctors to increase the 


patient dosage and thus increase price per existing prescription.  If this strategy sounds eerily familiar, 


that is because this is the exact strategy the Massachusetts Attorney General accused Purdue Pharma of 


perpetrating in their lawsuit against the company (Source).  One large difference between Purdue Pharma 


and BDSI though is that Purdue Pharma was wildly profitable while BDSI has an accumulated deficit of 


$344 million.   


Growth in Belbuca Prescriptions thus far – Belbuca Rx’s have seen a solid bump due to a large 


increase in sales force.  BDSI has increased their salesforce from 65 sales people in 2016 to 128 at the end 


of Q3 2018 and according to LinkedIn profiles, they have added at least 11 more in Q4.  This growth led 


to 25% QoQ growth in scripts in Q3-2018 and an estimated 15% QoQ growth in Q4-2018.

BDSI has a Free Opioids Program! 


However, we think the growth isn’t just coming from an increased salesforce.  It also comes from BDSI’s 


decision to give away opioids for free.  BDSI has a $0 copay card which is very controversial considering 


a) risk of addiction and b) current government scrutiny of opioid manufacturers.   





It shouldn’t be surprising that BDSI has been able to increase growth of Belbuca when they are willing to 


give the product away for free.  Many drug companies have reimbursement programs, but we find this 


particular program very surprising, given the addiction and abuse warning that Belbuca carries (listed 


below) and also due to the crack down on opioids that includes Trump signing the recent Opioid Bill.

Unhappy & Underpaid Sales Reps = Future Growth will Slow: 


Reading the CafePharma.com’s BDSI Sales rep board one realizes that the growth will likely stop as 


numerous of their sales reps are unhappy about their current compensation and the company’s product 


positioning.  Reps mention other employees stealing targets out of their territories by “promising 


kickbacks” and still others refer to BDSI as a “Second rate company” that pays below industry standard.  


Not only are they underpaid, overworked, and unhappy with benefits like car reimbursement, as some of 


the below quotes show, but many of them have resorted to taking on second jobs in order to pay their 


bills.  Via extensive LinkedIn search, we have found multiple BDSI reps that presently list other jobs, but 


by far the saddest situation is the BDSI rep that has apparently resorted to prostitution in order to afford 


his/her lifestyle.

BDSI’s Other Drugs: 


Bunavail – Bunavail is a buprenorphine/naloxone buccal film that is prescribed for treatment of opioid 


dependence.  It also uses the BEMA technology (polymer film that sticks to your check) as its delivery 


mechanism.  BDSI has said publicly in their conference calls that they no longer direct their salesforces 


efforts towards Bunavail Rx’s.  The reason why is that Suboxone has always had a more significant 


market share and earlier in 2018 the FDA approved multiple Suboxone generics (Link) from both Dr. 


Reddy and Mylan.  This will make it virtually impossible for Bunavail to effectively compete in the 


category and has already led to a drop-off in sales.   


Bunavail still does a small but decent business, though, with $6 million in LTM revenue that has been 


declining at 25% YoY (avg rate for LTM) and estimated 40% margins (based on 2016 gross margins).  A 


DCF on the future of Bunavail assuming that it continues declining at 25% YoY, has 40% gross margin, 


and no marketing expenditure results a net present value of $5.5 million for the drug. 


Onsolis – We believe that Onsolis, BDSI’s 3rd approved drug, is currently worthless.  Onsolis is a 


fentanyl product using the same BEMA delivery method that has a very limited use case.  Its use case is 


basically the same as Insys’s Subsys, as it is only approved for breakthrough pain in cancer patients that 


are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their cancer pain (FDA label).    


BDSI’s recent drug partner Collegium terminated their license agreement in Dec 2017, which they signed 


in May 2016.  No new player has since agreed to distribute it nor has BDSI attempted to sell it.  The drug 


was pulled from the market in 2012 due to quality issues (Source) and even before the drug was pulled 


the FAERS system shows that a multitude of patient deaths—50—were connected to using Onsolis.  For 


these reasons, we believe that the proper market valuation for Onsolis is currently 0, as it is unlikely that 


this drug will ever come back to market.

No R&D + High Debt = No Hope: 


Lack of Research and Development - BDSI does not have any other major drugs in the pipeline so we 


value their future pipeline at $0.  Their R&D spend has declined massively in 2018 showing that they are 


not hopeful for their pipeline either.  For Q3-2018, it was a mere $699,000, and it amounted to only $4 


million for the first 9 months of 2018 (10-Q3-2018 pg 2).  This represents a large drop from 2017’s $13 


million and 2016’s spend of $18.8 million. (2017 10-K pg F-5).   


High Cost Debt – 12.5% – BDSI had $50.5 million of debt outstanding as of Q3-2018 at the absurdly 


high interest rate of 12.5% (10Q-2018 pg 12).  The current cash burn of $6m per quarter doesn’t even 


include all the interest costs as BDSI is able to use their debts PIK feature to defer 3.5% of interest costs.  


Thus, the debt load continues to grow as their cash balance depletes.  On top of the appropriately priced 


but usurious 12.5% annual interest rate BDSI has also agreed to pay a 9% final payment fee on the 


original loan amount.   


While this expanding debt is not a near-term death sentence for BDSI it begins coming due in Sept 2021.  


It’s no wonder that the company is currently seeking to raise a large amount of equity ASAP before 


Belbuca’s growth come to a halt. 


Conclusion: 


BDSI is a cash burning opioid company that is connected to serial failed entrepreneurs who have a long 


history of SEC Investigations, shareholder lawsuits, and even bribery of a Governor (resulting in the 


official being sentenced prison time).  BDSI’s opioids are bad for your financial health 


Belbuca has enjoyed a brief moment of growth (also still unprofitable) by paying “consulting fees” to 


multiple suspect doctors, giving away their opioids for free, and by doubling their salesforce.  


Unfortunately, we don’t think that growth will last due to future pressure from generics, potential capped 


growth on Belbuca due to a “market share clause,” and an unhappy salesforce.   


When company insiders like Frank O’Donnell and Broadfin Capital (17.4% owner) want to sell their 


shares, you should too!  We are short BDSI.

Appendix A – Bonus - Questionable Bankers & Investor Relation Firm:  


Bankers: By this point you should not be surprised that BDSI was originally IPO’ed by bankers that have 


had some regulatory challenges.  The IPO was led by Ferris Baker & Watts, GunnAllen Financial and 


Maxim. 


Ferris, Baker Watts Inc – an entity that had 32 regulatory events (source) including manipulating the 


market for thinly traded Nasdaq stocks.  Finra said Ferris’s fraud began as early as August 2002 and 


continued through 2005 (pg 32 of FINRA Detailed Report or SEC charges).  Ferris Baker & Watts is now 


part of RBC. 


GunnAllen Financial, Inc has 17 regulatory events (source) including a fraudulent trade allocation scheme 


and the firm not restricting stocks when they were doing investment banking business with them.  


GunnAllen reps were also charged by the SEC for improperly transferring customer records to another 


firm (source). 


Maxim Group LLC – who we will not bother writing about but instead we just suggest that you call your 


local Maxim broker and ask for their top investment picks and then make your own judgement if they 


belong in the same class as GunnAllen & Ferris, Baker & Watts.   


Investor Relations Firm – BDSI uses LifeSci Advisors as their investor relations firm.  We think this 


again shows bad judgment as LifeSci Advisors is best known for having thrown tasteless parties where 


they invited “70 scantily-clad female models” to mingle with biotech executives. (Source)
