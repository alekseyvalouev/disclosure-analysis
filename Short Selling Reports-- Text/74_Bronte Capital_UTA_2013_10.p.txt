The sometimes eccentric views of John Hempton

The end game for Universal Travel: Ms. Yan, 47, has had
many years of experience in financial engineering
Universal Travel was the first Chinese reverse merger company I mentioned on this blog. Here is the
original post (Travelling Through China)... 
 
The company has since collapsed. It traded up after my original post - something that seems amazing
until you work out that an elderly and formerly rich retired car dealer in the Central Valley of California
(a man since deceased) spent almost $10 million dollars buying shares. 
 
Those shares are down 98% and the charities that man left his money to wound up nearly empty
handed. 
 
Universal Travel's dynamic CEO Jenny Jiang has since resigned. You can see her dynamism in this
now classic film of her ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange: 
 
 


 
 
The 8-K announcing Ms Jiang's resignation also announced her (temporary) successor - a Ms Yan -
who used to be the Finance Officer and also the Chief Operating Officer. 
 
Here is what they say about her: 
 


Ms. Yan, 47, has had many years of experience in financial engineering...


 
So now they tell us...

If something on this blog makes you

Interesting ... I didn't know that George Valente died. I talk to Jerry Dye quite often and
he's still gung-ho on UTRA. He went over to China again recently to check out one of
UTRA's new facilities and nothing but positives to speak upon his return. I know he was
buying stock when trading resumed. Jerry was George's partner and the guy in charge of
the money.
