New Data Show Omontys At Least 4x Worse Than Reported: Now 22
Suspected Deaths
Oct. 14, 2013 8:13 PM ET54 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


At the time of the Omontys recall in February, "five patients were reported to have died
after receiving Omontys, according to the figures provided by Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY),"
with "three cases of serious anaphylactic reactions associated with fatal outcomes…two
deaths reported prior to February were deemed to be cardiovascular in nature." Since
then, there have been no updates from Affymax, Takeda, or the FDA regarding deaths
associated with Omontys. Has Takeda uncovered something so awful about Omontys that
they want to sweep the drug and all of its potential liabilities under the rug rather than
bring attention to it? Curiously, Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Takeda on 10/09/2013
and there was not a single mention of Omontys anywhere in the entire 49 page report.


In our effort to get to the bottom of the Omontys saga, we asked the FDA to send us the
Adverse Event report for Omontys, which can be found in its entirety here (107 pages
long). The data shows there have been 22 deaths in which Omontys was reported to
be the most likely cause of death! Furthermore, the report shows there has been at
least one death (multiple additional cases of adverse events) reported as a result of
subcutaneous administration of Omontys. Ex-CEO, John Orwin previously said "there
have been no reports of such reactions …in patients receiving the drugs subcutaneously-
although the subcutaneous patient numbers are limited". A key underpinning of the AFFY
bull case was that the drug could be reintroduced under a limited subcutaneous-only label.
That optimism appears misplaced now given a subcutaneous death. The FDA data
presented here renders Orwin's statement patently false. We believe it is extremely
unlikely that the FDA approves an interim reintroduction of Omontys under a
subcutaneous label. Below is a summary of cases with reported deaths.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1744832-new-data-show-omontys-at-least-4x-worse-than-reported-now-22-suspected-deaths 2/14


The summary above excludes other serious, life-threatening outcomes, including
anaphylactic reactions and non-fatal respiratory arrest, which were reported in at least 10
other cases. We were surprised at the sheer volume of serious adverse events reported in
relation to Omontys, and were reminded of something Dr. Steven Nissen said about the
risks vs. benefits of Omontys at a 2011 FDA ODAC meeting: "So what I'm fearful will
happen is that…you're going to be back here in front of this committee in the future, as
you have been in the past, with this drug [Omontys], as you have with other drugs, with
some surprises down the road."


We have written about Affymax (here, here and here) and continue to believe that Affymax
is likely worthless. Given the choice between taking Epo 3x/week during regularly
scheduled dialysis center visits along with other drugs such as Venofer, compared to
taking Omontys once a month at a significantly higher risk of rapid onset death via
anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest, we believe the choice for not only patients and
doctors, but also the FDA is clear. Don't forget that it appears insiders (who had access to
this FDA data) share this view as well given they have been on a selling streak, even near
current levels (John Walker at $1.92, John Orwin at $1.02).


We remain short AFFY with a price target of $0.44 per share, but the most likely outcome
is that the stock is worthless. Our target price is based on a probability weighted basis
whereby we assign a 90% probability to Omontys being worthless, and a 10% probability
to the upside case of $4.38 per share, implying a $0.44 expected value (assumptions
discussed in greater detail here). However, we believe that the data overwhelmingly
shows Omontys is unsafe, too many bridges have been burned (FDA, dialysis centers,
nephrologists, patients who suffered adverse reactions), and the hurdles for reintroduction
are far too high. Therefore the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back and
the Company is worthless.

mershaw2001
I've got to ask: your last article focused on how the webpage Omontys.com being down meant that Affymax was
dead. Now that Takeda recently began running the Omontys website and the website is now live, would you say the
entire article you wrote before in invalid?


14 Oct 2013, 08:21 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Actually, the article focused on two prior drugs that had returned to market after having been
recalled and concluded that AFFY was not likely to return based on the precedent examples. The fact that the
website was down was a secondary consideration. The new website is hardly evidence that Omontys will
return to market. I think this article gives very strong evidence that Omontys is a lot more dangerous than
initially reported and that the drug is highly unlikely to return.

godwinpeak
The Omontys website only says that the domain name is reserved by Takeda. One could surmise that either
Takeda, under advice of counsel, elected not to entirely neglect the website due to anticipated product liability
claims. Another supposition could be that the domain host itself elected to update the site to prevent others
from purchasing the omontys.com web domain name. In all events, the benign content of the omontys
website with just the Takeda name does not seem to portend any great Takeda support for Omontys.

Author’s reply »  This is the date that the FDA received the adverse event report and not the date of the
adverse event itself. I've requested detailed case files from the FDA but have not yet received them, most
likely due to the govt shutdown. I may choose to write another article when I get them.


14 Oct 2013, 11:16 PM


Caffeinsomniac
I'm no medical expert, but I read through the full report, and it appears that many of the latter cases you are
referring to had patients who were exposed to numerous drugs (Omontys only being one of them). Including
the crux of your article (the patient who had sub-cutaneous). Because they were also exposed to Omontys, it
makes sense that these patients are included on the full case list, but how do you attribute the deaths
specifically to Omontys and not to the other drugs they were using at the time of death? Seems like quite a
speculative leap, but I await your response.

Author’s reply »  Adverse event reports are voluntarily filed by patients and doctors and when given to
pharma companies, it is mandatory that the pharma company report in the system. While there is no causal
relationship established in the reporting, in my experience reports tend to be submitted when it is believed
that there is such a relationship. If you wish to believe that the other drugs were the cause of the adverse
events, that is your prerogative.

Hey Exposure - If you think the stock is worthless, why you have to wait until .44 and cover? Why don't you cover
when the stock is zero? What kind investment is that? Your article is BS man with no evidence. Go back to your mom
and cry when stock shoot up to $10 per share.


14 Oct 2013, 09:41 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I believe that an FDA generated FARES report counts as "evidence." My $0.44 price target
is based on a probability weighted outcome analysis between bankruptcy $0 (90% chance) and going
concern $4.38 (10% chance).


14 Oct 2013, 09:58 PM


SeattleGoldMiner
He is not saying he will wait to $.44 to cover; he is merely providing an "expected value" (probabilities times
values of outcomes summed). In fact, if the stock is ever cancelled he will not have to "cover" EVER. When a
stock is cancelled all one needs to do is provide evidence that this has happened and the brokerage will
release any collateral and you can then file your tax returns showing the full gain (which is ordinary income.)
Sometimes, even when it is 99.99% sure the stock will be cancelled (Kmart e.g.) and it goes down to $.05
some of the people with shorts will cover because it may still take months for the company to "emerge" from
Chapter 11 or be totally liquidated in Chapter 7 and thus the extra $.05 is not worth keeping the collateral tied
up for. Also, in Chapter 7 they sometimes sell the "shell" so that the stock stays alive (even though it is empty
for a while) and the stock may sell for a penny or less...but one cannot then close out the short without
covering.


Best outcome for a short is a Chapter 11 with the original stock cancelled and worthless.

Geez, you must be omniscient.


"The data shows there have been 22 deaths in which Omontys was reported to be the most likely cause of death!
Furthermore, the report shows there has been at least one death (multiple additional cases of adverse events)
reported as a result of subcutaneous administration of Omontys."


Yet the disclaimer at the head of the report says "the information in these reports has not been scientifically or
otherwise verified as to a cause and effect relationship and cannot be used to estimate the incidence of these
events." Yet you jumped right to omontys being "the likely cause of death." Not old age, not kidney failure for these
sick people, not anything else but omontys.


A good lawyer would know the answers to the following questions. I don't, but since you're such a clown i'm gonna
give you a chance to really score some points.


Stepstocks noted 13 deaths of your added 19 deaths occurred well after omontys' recall. Did amgen kill these
people? It seems likely to me some other drug had to be used in place of omontys. The other 6 deaths of the
additional 19, did they also occur after discontinuance of omontys? The subcutaneous death, occurred before or after
omontys was pulled? Anaphylaxis the cause?


Given that report disclaimer i noted, you sure you don't want to pull your claim which states "... The data shows there
have been 22 deaths in which Omontys was reported to be the most likely cause of death!" The way it reads you
seem to be claiming the fda claims omontys was the likely cause. That might cause you some difficulty with the fda if
it gets reported to them. You sure you don't want to re-word?


14 Oct 2013, 10:09 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  See the reply above re: event timing. The report generated is supposed to cover adverse
events, including death, related to Omontys. If, as a result of the biolerplate disclaimer on the report, you think
these deaths were due to something else, go ahead and buy the stock. We will know soon enough whether
Omontys will ever come back. My money is squarely on it not returning.


14 Oct 2013, 11:19 PM


joel menkes
"The report generated is supposed to cover adverse events, including death, related to Omontys."


Absolutely not. It is supposed to cover events which include omontys administration, and nothing else.
Whether the event is related to omontys or not is for further investigation to determine. What drugs were
administered after omontys administration was stopped but before the death of the patients? Perhaps you
should shift your focus for cause of death to those drugs. Yes, thank you for noting we will know soon enough,
rather than later. I've already bought the stock within the past several months, and added to my holdings
recently. So, my money is squarely on it coming back. As you noted, sooner rather than later.

@joel, surprised that you'd add to a position at this point. I was an AFFY bull from ~$4 back in the day. It was
dear to my heart due to my dad's leukemia and EPO use. But even in the best case scenario, we knew there
was a small window for Omontys to make its mark before Amgen fought back with deals and Mircera came to
market. Now Mircera is close to market with the same dosing advantages more or less, and numerous deaths
have been linked to O. There just will not be an interest in O large enough to overcome these other hurdles,
IMO, let alone if it will ever be reintroduced, and considering the rights signed away to Takeda. Time to face
reality.

"FAERS data do have limitations. First, there is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication
error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event
be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event. Further, FDA does not
receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence
whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event.
Therefore, FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S.
population."


So, AE, are you really so desperate to make false claim:"New Data Show Omontys At Least 4x Worse Than
Reported: Now 22 Suspected Deaths"?

Just because of you, AE, I am willing to part with $1,200 that will get me 1000 shares. Hey, maybe cheaper after tons
of people read your article and sell which should drive down the price.


What's the worst thing can can happen? Lose my irrelevant $1,200 or wake up one of these days to find that Omontys
survived the recall. By which point, your credibility would forever be dead. And even if you are somehow proved right
and Omontys never returns, your negative perspective shows that you are one of those who celebrate failure, which,
at least to me, still puts you character in the gutter.


Just one last note; I question the intelligence behind shorting stocks that are already in the gutter strictly based on
risk/reward. Why waste time on a stock that is already dead when you can be investing in your time and money in
something that may quadruple your investment? If I short at $1.20, the maximum return would be no more than 100%.
But the likely reward is always far more than risk of Chapter 11. That's my opinion, at least.

The FDA report you placed in the article doesn't reference "any" drug what so ever.


With that being said, I believe the report you included could be for "any" drug on the market.


Not to mention.... I have my doubts that the FDA would have approved Omontys for marketing with such a report or
would have allowed it to stay on the market....


In essence I believe the FDA would have done the recall....


IMHO you have offered unsubstantiated evidence for your own personal gain.... Short position.

Of those 22 deaths, NINE of them were also on Epogen, including the one subcutaneous administration. In addition,
five had infections including Clostridium difficile colitis with megacolon and septic shock, pneumonia and sepsis. Also
listed were "lung neoplasm malignant", intracranial hemorrhage/CVA, aneurysm with sudden death, congestive heart
failure, convulsion and cardiac arrest.


Of all of the deaths, only TWO listed anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions which is what the concern is to begin
with. All of these other deaths may or may not be related to Omontys at all.

Let's compare apples to apples. Epogen was the primary suspect in 1885 adverse event reports from
11/01/1997 to 12/31/2012. There were 246 outcomes reported as "death". Omontys was the primary suspect
in 151 adverse event reports from your list. There were 22 outcomes reported as "death". 246/1885 = 0.1305
= 13.05%. 22/151 = 0.1456 = 14.56%.

You reported number of deaths based on adverse reaction reports. I put it into perspective to show that
Omontys and Epogen are comparable using adverse reaction data. I think adverse reaction data are pretty
meaningless for the most part except they can show a trend. I looked through those records. Did several of
these people go into cardiac and/or respiratory arrest immediately upon administration of Omontys? I'm
assuming that if they listed Omontys as the most likely suspect that the event happened in close proximity to
the injection. Out of eleven patient deaths (listed as the outcome) that looked to require some form of cardio-
respiratory resuscitation there was one sudden death and the rest were listed as cardiac arrest, pulse absent,
cardio-respiratory arrest, resuscitation, respiratory arrest, unresponsive to stimuli, PEA, agonal rhythm,
ventricular fibrillation or some combination of the above. Only one of the 22 deaths listed anaphylactic
reaction as the primary adverse event. Are you suggesting that Omontys is causing heart attacks, strokes and
other cardiovascular events in close proximity to the injection? They sure don't look to be anaphylactic in
nature. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular events with all ESA's but this is related to the increased
hemoglobin levels, not to the medication itself.

Author’s reply »  Some people think I am right and others think I am wrong. The FARES report clearly shows a large
number of adverse events linked to Omontys. If you want to believe that there isn't a causal relationship, that's your
option. I continue to believe that Omontys will not return to market. We will know soon enough and then one side is
going to need to admit defeat. My bet is that the long holders lose.

AE, please double-check the fact. Most of commentaries about your analyses are negative. Moreover, please
check how many "like"s in comments against your analyses. Only GODwp, maybe a few other, are in your
side. Again, you got fact spinning to your side.

"...number of adverse events linked to Omontys."


Only because omontys was administered to them sometime in their past, so it was included. They also ate
rice chex, brushed their teeth with colgate, drank a coke, oh, and took on "safe" epogen after omontys was
discontinued. And if not epogen then one of the others. So the adverse advents are linked to those products
as well, and the drug most recently used by them probably was not omontys due to its being discontinued. As
for the chart you noted, i imagine you came up with it while sitting on the toilet, just to while away the time.
Then you decided to publish it rather than use it to wipe. You've been ripped apart, accurately, over your
safety comparisons all through the articles of yours i've read. Going by what i've read by you I don't have to
see old garbage to know what it is.

Obviously this guy has a personal axe to grind with this company regardless of what his claimed motives may be.
Time will bear out who is right and who is wrong.

mfm, I don't think it is as much as an axe to grind as it is to try and manipulate the stock movement. There
really are no articles coming out on AFFY currently, and in the past if you were to chart the movement of
AFFY, you could strongly argue that Alpha's articles successfully persuaded people to sell. His articles are

definitely biased, as he "believes" , IE wants the stock to move down as he has shorted it. If he wasn't
personally invested, his article would carry much more weight, but I believe he wouldn't be spending the time
to argue his point, and subsequently ducking pointed questions, or responding with another question. He is
clever to the untrained eye.

@pharmdca
Not going to comment on author's goal here in providing his rationale to keep writing an article on affy's drug.  
Only thing I will point out is that the drug will make comeback with a label change, stock will go above $5 after that
news. 
Don't tell a pharmacist or a doc that 3 people dies of anaphylaxis rx with affy's drug and fda will not allow it to come to
the market. In my practice, seen so many times pt. got anaphylaxis rx to a drug but that drug is still on the market.  
One example: During my ID rotations at a hospital, pt died due to anaphylaxis rx. on vancomycin (pt. was admitted in
ICU for sepsis tx). Vancomycin still on the market. 
Aminoglycosides had caused serious adverse rx's from ototoxicity to nephrotoxity to renal failure, still on the market. 
Pick any one chemotherapy agent: Ton's of serious adverse rx's reported in pt.s (i mean pt. actually taking chemos,
affy's death could be due to other factors as well not just affy's drug), chemo's still given to pt.s even though some of
them only extend life by <1 yr.  
Affy is my biggest portfolio equity along with amrn, qcor, npsp, acad and gild. 
Do you dd, ur research and avoid listening to the the noise.

AE, I give you credit for letting us now you are short. That is more than a lot of other authors do.


With regard to depressing the stock, I'm not sure whether to attribute the 4% drop today to your article or the
government budget "negotiations". I don't want to completely derail this thread by bringing that up, but it is quite
plausible that we will roll right past 17 Oct with no deal and the entire market will take a beating (ie, the game of
chicken may not end well). BTW, I don't think we would technically "default", but it won't matter. Ironically, I started
trading in Biotech because it was relatively decoupled from the general market. The last week's bruising has me re-
thinking that hypothesis! Regardless, I will continue to maintain my small position in AFFY.

"107 page" report is nothing more than report cards. Easy and quick read. I believe the author doesn't want the reader
to actually look at the link provided so instead provides a handy chart showing the deaths occurred of patients who
have taken Omontys, but paraphrases. Anyone who is reading original article and takes an ounce of truth to it owes
themselves a look at the reports and get all the facts. It takes all of 4-5 mins to see that the title Now :22 deaths
suspected is misleading (IMHO).There are multiple people who died who clearly have very little association of the
cause of death with Omontys. Please look for yourself. Word code on report "DE=Death" under outcome.

I believe that the equivalent of reading the reports and posting the article that the deaths were caused IE suspected of
causing all the deaths is parallel with the following statement.... If someone dies from a heart attack and has a drink in
the last month, it must be the cause. It's drawing a loose link. I wrote a much more detailed comment, but a moderator
at SA didn't feel it was appropriate to post. I think I used a word they didn't like (not vulgar, but something that most of
us realize what the author is doing). I don't know what to call it when someone spins facts. Telling half truths is a lie to
me. Or saying things like "107 page report" when you don't want people to read it. The author's answer to why he
posted the page number of the report, would probably be something along the line of .... "I just wanted to let the
readers know how long it is". Read between the lines people. If you go back to his other articles where he sites long
reports, there is never any mention to the amount of pages to the articles. My assumption is the author wants you to
read the articles that works in his favor, and read his cliff note versions that omit many of the facts to the articles he
doesn't want you to read.

We don't need your "interpretation" of the Report which says no such things.

Time to move on from AFFY.


Suggest we all move to ARIA.


$350M cash cushion. Temporary setback with Ponatinib, but the drug is life saving drug, the company hasn't given up
and an inflection point test result event in Dec for the drug.


Another promising lung cancer drug (113) in the pipeline.


JPM just upgraded the stock...

Bad news on ARIA.


No more biotech's for me, period.

CM, don't give up on biotech, just stay away from cancer drugs. That's where I've lost the most money (CLSN for
instance). There are a lot less challenging problems to solve than trying to cure cancer. You might consider KERX,
RMTI, or DVA (Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD), Dialysis, ESRD) along with AFFY, of course. Pain management and
Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs are interesting areas (ACRX, lots of others). Drug delivery (ATRS, UNIS)
comes at the market from a different direction. But if you can't handle the drama, you probably should trade in
different sector.
