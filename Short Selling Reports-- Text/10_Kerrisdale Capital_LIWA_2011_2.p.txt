Lihua International: We Do Not View China 360 As A Disinterested
Third Party
Aug. 15, 2011 7:43 AM ET13 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Last week, a firm called China 360 Solutions announced that it had completed an
investigative review of Lihua International (LIWA or the "company"). The firm's report was
made public and addressed a variety of topics such as "Operational Overview," "Licenses
and Certificates," "Tax Reconciliation," "Cash Verification," etc.


The report did not have an overall conclusion as to whether it believed that the company
was accurately representing itself in its SEC financial statements; instead, it had
conclusions for certain subsections. While we certainly have our own thoughts as to the
conclusions made by China 360 (we are of the firm opinion that Lihua International is
misrepresenting itself in its SEC financial statements), the point of this article is not to
discuss the contents of the China 360 report.


Rather, we want to address the lack of an up-front disclaimer regarding whether China
360 has an indirect "financial interest" with respect to the findings of its report. When we
write reports, as we have with China Education Alliance (CEU) or Advanced Battery
Technologies (OTCPK:ABAT), we state clearly that we are biased third parties. In both
reports, we state in bold, on the front page, that we have a financial interest in the stock
and benefit if it declines. Therefore, readers know that they should view us as a subjective
party.


The China 360 report had no such disclaimer. Rather, in its press release, the firm wrote
"China 360Â° Solutions does not have a position, long or short, in Lihua International,"
which, in our opinion, made readers consider that China 360 could be an objective
observer of Lihua, rather than an interested party.


We think that such a view of China 360 is inaccurate. More to the point, we do not view
China 360 Solutions as a disinterested third party with respect to their report last week on
Lihua International.


Who is China 360 Solutions?


As can be seen from this link, China 360 was formed in June 2011. The newly founded
firm "provides an array of world class financial, forensic accounting, compliance, due-
diligence, risk management, strategic communications and financial advisory and other

services for U.S. listed Chinese companies, their boards, investment banks, funds or
investors." The firm is a co-venture of "Thornhill Capital, Inc., Grandview Capital Advisors,
Inc. and Trilogy Capital Partners, Inc." We discuss the backgrounds of these firms later in
this article.


China 360 Solutions "Approved" by Global Hunter


In the image below, we've pasted an "Investor Education Conference Call" notice
circulated electronically by Global Hunter Securities in mid-July to Global Hunter clients.
This notice was made public last week via this link that was posted on internet message
boards.


(Click to enlarge)


Based on the notice, we can see China 360 is a "GHS-approved third party diligence
provider." Global Hunter scheduled a call to "introduce" China 360 Solutions to its clients,
providing evidence that Global Hunter and China 360 have a relationship. Discussions
with Global Hunter clients have further confirmed that China 360 Solutions has a
relationship with Global Hunter.


Most followers of Chinese Reverse Take-Overs ("RTOs") are familiar with Global Hunter.
Global Hunter is a leading underwriter of equity offerings for U.S.-listed Chinese
companies that have gone public via reverse mergers. The firm has underwritten or acted
as placement agent for offerings for numerous Chinese RTOs, including Shengdatech

(OTC:SDTH), China Marine Food, Wonder Auto (OTCPK:WATG), China Sky One Medical
and Yuhe International (OTCPK:YUII), to name a few. Of those companies mentioned,
several (YUII, SDTH, WATG) are halted or have been de-listed and we have serious
concerns about the others.


Global Hunter's research team has also historically had a high proportion of buy
recommendations among the Chinese RTO stocks they cover. For instance, in this
Zerohedge article, Zerohedge shows a snapshot of Global Hunter's China Coverage
Universe from earlier this year:


(Click to enlarge)


More than 90% of the Chinese stocks shown that are not suspended were rated as Buys
by Global Hunter (four of these buys would later be halted in the coming months).


Generally speaking, underwriters and placement agents of Chinese reverse mergers have
an indirect financial interest in witnessing a lower proportion of Chinese RTOs turn out to
be frauds: fewer frauds mean greater investor acceptance of the asset class and higher
underwriting/placement fees for Chinese RTO equity offerings. As well, research divisions
have an indirect financial interest in seeing a lower proportion of their Buy
recommendations turn out to be frauds: fewer frauds mean that clients place greater faith
in the research division's recommendations and therefore devote more commission dollars
to trades with the sales and trading arm of the investment bank.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287331-lihua-international-we-do-not-view-china-360-as-a-disinterested-third-party 4/8


As such, Global Hunter has a financial interest in seeing a lower proportion of frauds
within Chinese RTOs and stocks for which it has Buy recommendations, such as LIWA.


Again, the point of this article is that China 360 Solutions is not a disinterested third party.
China 360's relationship with Global Hunter Securities, a longtime underwriter of Chinese
RTO stocks and a firm with a historically high proportion of Buy recommendations in the
Chinese RTO space, indicates that China 360 may not be an appropriate third party
arbiter of whether certain U.S.-listed Chinese RTOs are misrepresenting themselves in
their SEC financial statements.


Backgrounds of Grandview, Thornhill and Trilogy


China 360 Solutions is a co-venture of three firms: Thornhill Capital, Inc., Grandview
Capital Advisors, Inc. and Trilogy Capital Partners, Inc. In terms of analyzing whether
China 360 Solutions is a disinterested third-party with respect to its diligence reports on
Chinese RTOs, it makes sense to examine the backgrounds and relationships of these
firms.


First, we will mention that Thornhill, Grandview and Trilogy have all previously been
placement agents, consultants or IR representatives for U.S.-listed Chinese RTOs. In the
below paragraph, we mention several of each firm's former clients, with a link to the
referenced company's SEC filing.


Thornhill's client list includes Anhui Taiyang Poultry Co., Inc and Sino-Green Land Corp.
(OTCPK:SGLA) and their assignments have been in consulting / CFO capacities. Chinese
RTOs that have hired Grandview at some point in the past include Oriental Dragon Corp.
(placement agent), China Renewable Energy Holdings, Inc. (consulting / investment
banking services) and Green Solutions China, Inc. (placement agent). Trilogy's client
history includes Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTC:TBET) (IR firm), Bohai Pharmaceuticals
(IR firm) and China Organic Agriculture (OTC:CNOA) (IR firm).


We can see that Thornhill, Grandview and Trilogy are not outsiders to the U.S.-listed
Chinese RTO universe; rather, they have previously generated revenue from U.S.-listed
RTO companies.


In the case of Thornhill, we can see that the firm has strategic partnerships with other
service providers in the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO universe. On its website, Thornhill lists
its "Partners," with the following introduction:

"In addition to the network of professionals that make up our own team,
Thornhill Capital has strategic partnerships and relationships with other elite
organizations:"


These organizations include Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, Sichenzia Ross Friedman
Ference LLP, Anslow + Jaclin, Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP and Larry Isen's Emerging
China Stocks newsletter, among others. The firms just mentioned all have generated
substantial revenue from the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO sector, as well as the general RTO
sector as a whole. Their list of Chinese RTO clients are too long to mention, but Anslow +
Jaclin's extensive experience with Chinese RTOs can be seen by examining historical
transactions here and Sichenzia Ross's extensive experience with Chinese RTOs can be
seen by examining historical transactions here. Schwartz Levitsky's audit clients have
included CAAS, HQS, SCEI, CBAK, etc. Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk and its predecessor
firms have extensive history with Chinese RTO clients and our quick initial count found at
least a dozen Chinese RTO audit clients. As for Larry Isen's Emerging China Stocks
newsletter service, we will let the name speak for itself.


Grandview and Trilogy do not list their strategic partnerships, although Trilogy includes
counsel at Sichenzia Ross on its "Associated Professionals" page.


In this section, we provide evidence that Thornhill, Grandview and Trilogy have previously
generated revenue from the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO sector. As well, Thornhill, as implied
by its strategic partnerships, has considerable relationships with other service providers
that have strongly benefited from the emergence of the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO sector.


Naturally, we presume that all of the firms discussed herein are of the highest quality.
Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that Thornhill, Grandview and Trilogy are not
disinterested third parties when it comes to conducting investigations into whether U.S.-
listed Chinese RTOs are committing fraud.


Conclusion


We do not think that China 360 Solutions should be viewed as a disinterested third party
with respect to the report on Lihua International that was issued last week. We're certain
that a due diligence investigative firm backed by Citron Research, Muddy Waters and
Glaucus Research would not be viewed as an independent third party if it were to write a
negative report alleging fraud about a Chinese company, even if those firms did not have
short positions in the target stock. Similarly, China 360 Solutions, given its relationship
with Global Hunter and its three backers' histories generating revenue from Chinese

A lot of negative generalisms about global hunters' view to back up your general view( "short"), supporting your own
bets. Your generalistic self dealing conclusions may or may not, generally, be applied to any specific status of any of
the specific companies discussed.

That's it? Really? Couldn't you have saved us reading time and said: 
"Because I am short, I won't discuss the thorough, forensic audit China 360 did because it makes my short position
look stupid. Therefore, I will try to discredit the testimony of 360." Sounds like a lawyer... a desperate one at that.
Kerrisdale, there is a reason the short ratio is declining. And why do you hide behind "Kerrisdale" instead of putting
your real name on your work?

China Expert
Disinterested or not. 360 is attempting to start a new business of ensuring some integrity in Chinese companies
through thorough due diligence. It is a great idea for a sector that needs a major overhaul to gain market confidence.
It would be simply insane and a waste of time and effort for such a group of individuals to form an entity to gain an
industry reputation and future business if there were any question as to their report's integrity.

I like the part where the the commenters don't dispute the main facts of your post.


Traveller-- how do you know how thorough the "forensic" audit was? The point is that you don't know, and the fact that
China 360 is NOT a disinterested 3rd party means that you should probably not take their work at face value.


If you insist on taking obviously conflicted reports at face value with no verifiable evidence, then my friend Ping Luo
would like to sell you some CCME.

If one made a mistake, admit it and start over. Trying to justify a mistake will keep him there. I can not afford

mcmaaaaath - "with no verifiable evidence". They gave you the names and places of the people they talked to for
God's sake! Go verify it! In this super-suspicious of China environment, do you really think China 360 is trying to pull a
fast one? It is those like Chapski/Waldo Mushman that produce a 3 page report with no water mark and claim it is the
original 24 page tax report that YOU should not take at face value. Innuendo really is lying you know. Where are the
shorts specifics? The vague "we believe" stuff is not credible any more. Each time a hit piece on LIWA gives specifics,
LIWA completely explains, provides proof and exonerates themselves --- sooooo shorts have stopped providing
specifics. Please note that shorts are exiting the credible Chinese stocks fairly quickly. check the ratios. Good luck.

I wouldn't buy LIWA right here, but I sure as heck wouldn't short it either. I'm surprised you haven't covered yet.

You guys are value-investors? I'm more in-line with JoeNatural line of reasoning. Furthermore, I wouldn't even
consider this special situation value investing. You are speculating on fraud. With this blog-piece, You are neither
value investors, nor special-situations ( for investment ) . You are short-speculating. You should add the fact, that you
are speculators as well on your website. Or to put it bluntly, I question your own representation of youself.


However, there are questions about China360, but unless proven, it sounds more like a conspiracy theory than
anything. I just wouldn't touch the stock if I were you. On another note, if I was your investor, after reading this blog-
post, I would pull my money.

Urbane Gorilla!
All the article says is China 360 is "not a disinterested 3rd party". Why anyone would beat up the authors over that
bland a statement is beyond me.


I tracked Chinese Reverse Mergers for awhile and have to say that I appreciate knowing that China 360 and Global
Hunter have an arrangement. You cannot be too cautious when dealing with Reverse Mergers. As of today, LIWA is
hitting new lows and the short ratio is 25%...(TWENTY FIVE PERCENT!!!) I'm looking at it as a possible bounce back
to 4.00 based on proposed Chinese Infrastructure stimulus and appreciate finding out everything I can about the
accounting firm (I guess) that tells me LIWA is OK.
