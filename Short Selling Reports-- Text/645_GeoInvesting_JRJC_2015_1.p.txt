China Finance Online CEO Resigns From Key Posts In China Amid
Anti-Corruption Probe

Summary


The most current SAIC records show Chairman and CEO Zhiwei Zhao suddenly
resigned from his positions at three key Chinese VIE subsidiaries of JRJC over the
past few months.


This development has yet to be disclosed by management. Additionally, Zhao was
also mysteriously absent from JRJC’s March 23, 2015 fourth quarter earnings
conference call.


Chinese media reports exposing the detention of JRJC independent director
Rongquan Leng prompted JRJC to announce his resignation, without addressing his
alleged detention.


Chinese media reports also indicate serious legal troubles for associates of Zhao,
who himself is reportedly not allowed to leave China.


Ling Wang, a former long-time JRJC director and associate of Zhao, fled China in
2014, leaving his company indebted to JRJC for $25 million.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Serious Legal Troubles Emerge, Undisclosed by JRJC


The first hints of legal trouble at China Finance Online (NASDAQ:JRJC) appeared in a
December 15, 2014 China's Tencent Prism magazine special report on the business
dealings of the brother of a detained high-level government official. With respect to JRJC,
Tencent Prism reported that Ling Wang, a former director of JRJC and close associate of
CEO Zhiwei Zhao, fled China in 2014 to escape a corruption investigation. Zhao
apparently wasn't so lucky, as he was reportedly restricted from leaving China at the end
of 2014.


In the two trading days following the Tencent Prism report, JRJC shares fell 25% from
$7.62 to $5.70. Disturbingly, JRJC management did not respond to the report, despite the
very serious allegations and a large decline in the share price.

On March 23, 2015, JRJC reported dismal earnings and its stock fell by 26% from $6.19
to $4.58. Chairman Zhao was mysteriously absent from this important earnings
conference call, the first he had missed since July 2013. JRJC provided no explanation for
Zhao's absence, but did provide a quote from Zhao in the earnings release as well as a
prepared remark purportedly from Zhao that was read during the conference call.


Matters took another turn for the worse on April 17, 2015, when Caixin Magazine reported
the official detention of JRJC independent director Rongquan Leng during a corruption
investigation. The article pointed out that Leng's "…fall might be related to a U.S. listed
company." Also, the article cited a source who claimed that Leng and the brother of the
detained high-level government official "participated in the control of the shares of a U.S.
listed company from behind the scenes."


In response the Caixin report, JRJC issued a hastily prepared press release later that day
announcing the resignation of Mr. Leng "for personal reason." Incredibly, JRJC did not
comment on any of the issues raised in Caixin's report. JRJC thus appears to be
determined to keep U.S. investors in the dark regarding the company's numerous legal
issues in China.


CEO Zhao Suddenly Resigned from the Management of Three of JRJC's Key
Chinese VIE Subsidiaries


For U.S. investors, JRJC's legal issues are compounded by the risky VIE structure of its
Chinese operations. As many authors have previously noted, VIE structures often entail
significant risks, especially when a company's main Chinese operating subsidiaries are
VIEs controlled by a person who is in legal trouble. JRJC historically did a poor job
disclosing its VIE structure, which was recently questioned by the SEC, resulting in JRJC
filing an amended 2013 20-F on April 21, 2015 that added more detailed disclosures and
related risks. Despite the additional disclosure, JRJC failed to disclose the resignation of
CEO Zhao from key VIE management posts made in the weeks prior to the April 27, 2015
filing of its 2014 20-F.


We obtained and reviewed the SAIC records of JRJC's Chinese VIE and directly owned
operating subsidiaries. To our surprise, updated SAIC records show that CEO Zhao
suddenly resigned as director, legal representative, and general manager of three
key Chinese VIE subsidiaries over the course of the last few months. JRJC has
failed to disclose Zhao's resignations to investors.


The following are the three key VIE subsidiaries that reported the resignation of Zhao in
updated SAIC filings:

One additional subsidiary also reported the resignation of Zhao in updated SAIC filings:


Fortune Software (Beijing) Co., Ltd. Fortune Software has registered capital of $12 million
and is 100% owned by JRJC. Chairman Zhao resigned as legal representative, director

After fleeing China in 2014, Ling Wang's company still owed JRJC $25 million


Ling Wang was a former long-time JRJC director and associate of Zhao, who fled China in
2014. Wang resigned from the board of JRJC in 2012. Following Wang's resignation,
JRJC made a questionable real estate investment with Wang's company, Langfang
Shengshi Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., as follows:


"In order to enhance our return on cash during the strategic transition period, in
March 2013, we invested an aggregate $22.1 million in a real estate project in
Langfang City, Hebei Province, developed by Langfang Shengshi Real Estate
Development Co., Ltd. (the "Langfang Developer")." (page 18 of the 2014 20-F)


As of December 26, 2013, Langfang Developer was 75% owned by Beijing Qingshi
Investment Management Co., Ltd, which was 100% owned by Ling Wang, according to
SAIC records shown below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3232916-china-finance-online-ceo-resigns-from-key-posts-in-china-amid-anti-corruption-probe 7/12


At the time of this suspicious investment (March 2013), JRJC CEO Zhao also failed to
disclose that he had an indirect equity interest in Wang's Langfang Developer, which
according to the SAIC record (above) Zhao transferred to Ling Wang on July 23, 2013.


As of December 31, 2014, Wang's Langfang Developer owed JRJC $25 million, according
to the 20-F, which warns of the risk of failure to collect this outstanding amount (see page
18) but, of course, never discloses Wang's predicament with the Chinese authorities.
JRJC reported that it received $2.1 million from the Langfang Developer on March 10,
2015 (see page 76 of 20-F).

Comments (14)


It seems that the Chinese anti-corruption investigation is clearly targeting associates of
Zhao (Leng and Wang) and appears to have caused JRJC enough concern that may have
led Zhao to take the extreme step of resigning from his management positions in three key
VIE subsidiaries.


JRJC repeatedly failed to disclose these highly material events, which in our opinion was
part of a plan to intentionally mislead investors by concealing the extent of the Chinese
government anti-corruption investigation. Even after being questioned by the SEC
regarding the adequacy of its VIE disclosures, JRJC did not disclose the resignation of
Zhao in its recently filed 2014 20-F filing, nor did JRJC file any amended legal updates of
its VIE structure with the SEC.


We believe it's fair to assume that the anti-corruption investigation and the removal of
Chairman Zhao from the Chinese management will have a material negative impact on
JRJC's business.


Investors may recall that NQ Mobile (NQ) Chairman and Co-CEO Henry Yu Lin was
similarly reported to be in legal trouble in China in December 2014. On December 10,
2014, NQ announced Lin had resigned "due to personal reasons unrelated to the
Company." Shares of NQ fell from $6.03 the day before Lin's resignation to $3.91 at year
end.


We believe that JRJC may perform even worse than NQ without its Chairman and CEO,
as the company hasn't turned a profit in the last three years.

The Pump Stopper, Contributor
outstanding research as always GEO, this thing is obviously worthless and It always blows my mind that
anyone would buy anything like this considering there are 10k+ possible stocks anyone could own. Why in the
Pho-k would anyone buy this worthless piece?! I'll never understand...

This article includes multiple reasons why JRJC should be delisted and banned from ever trading in the U.S. again. I
imagine JRJC insiders are secretly dumping as much stock as they can and using the proceeds to buy safe houses in
Cali they can abscond to.

I don't understand how you can be CEO and at the same time director in many subsidiaries, therefore the fact that in
these, dedicated responsible director are identified instead of the CEO does make sense to me. You are clearly short
on the stock like all the other SA authors who wrote bad article on JRJC, if you don't like the company just stay
outside and put the money somewhere else instead of reaping off dollars from those investors who think the business
is doing fine. JRJC is growing as a company.

China Stock Research, Contributor
Please do more research the VIE structure. You don't seem to understand how the operating companies in
China link to the listed entity.

Can you post links to the SAIC documents or shed light on how you went about obtaining the information ? Thanks

Your links do not say anything about Rongquan Leng being detained. They pertain to a completely different person
who happens to be named "Leng". Nice try though. Here are the direct Google translations of the two Caixin articles:


http://bit.ly/1Gkz9GX


http://bit.ly/1Gkz8CM


As for Zhiwei Zhao, this is a non-story, and using weasel words like "suddenly" or "mysteriously" won't change that.
He is still at JRJC, he just resigned from the subsidiaries, probably to focus more on the core business and to
integrate their newer stock platforms rather than just focusing on StockStar. They have no obligation to disclose this
type of event to the SEC. Again, a non-story.

As for Ling Wang, he never "fled" China, which is probably why you did not include any links to support this slander.
He is the chairman and CEO of GCTech Company, based in Los Angeles. If he did move to the US from China, that is
probably why. He was worked at GCTech for decades. It is quite a bizarre stretch to try to implicate a former JRJC
director from 2012, without any support. More on Mr Wang here:

Looks like Geo is right on this one..read last years 20-f bio of Leng. The bio matches up to description in
Chinese article.


"Rongquan Leng has served as our director since April 2012. Mr. Leng is the Vice Chairman of China Institute
of Communications. Mr. Leng served as Executive Director, President and Chief Operating Officer of China
Telecom Corporation Limited ("China Telecom")( NYSE:CHA HKEx:728), Deputy General Manager and Chief
Engineer of China Telecommunications Corporation, Deputy General Manager of China Network
Communications Group Corporation, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications ("DGT") of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications ("MPT"), Chief Engineer of the
Beijing Long-Distance Telephone Office, Vice Chairman of the Internet Society of China and Deputy Director
of Post and Telecommunications Technology Committee of Ministry of Information Industry. Mr. Leng is a
professor-level senior engineer. He graduated from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications with
a Master's Degree in engineering science. Mr. Leng has more than 30 years of operational management
experience in the telecommunications industry in China."

I think you're right. Here's another source:


http://reut.rs/1GkI1fz


Anyway, the author criticizes JRJC for not responding to this issue, but there isn't much to respond to, since
no details of the investigation have been released.


The article makes clear that he is being investigated for actions related to his position at the SOE China
Telecom, and it has nothing at all to do with JRJC.


No charges have been filed, and he has not been "detained" as the author claimed.

I have also questioned this Lang Fang property loan in the past. Even without the related party shenanigans alleged
by Geo, the loan repayment was already overdue relative to its original repayment date and was high risk. JRJC
should have stuck to using boring term investments offered by banks for its spare cash, which give much lower
interest rates but at least the company can get its money back. The only minor reprieve the company gets is already
disclosing it made this loan, however not mentioning the related party involvement more than offsets this. The poor
corporate governance and questionable commerciality on this alone indicates investors should steer away, and
definitely avoid when considering everything else that GEO mentions.


I am very interested to know what are the actual details of apparent corruption charges, if they are in anyway linked to
the company's core business, and consequential risks to the company's business licenses being suspended or
revoked.


I also wonder if the CEO's resignation from the VIEs affects in any way the contractual terms or legal enforceability.

the bull case which got me involved originally the CEO has purchased close to 15-20million in USA money from funds
that were imploding. However, as bullish as that is their are many red flags especially the Real estate deal which
again made zero sense. I would just stay away from it.

The Company believes that Geoinvesting report contains numerous errors of facts, misleading speculations and
malicious interpretations of events. The Company's board of directors has been informed of the allegations made by
Geoinvesting and will consider and decide on the necessary and appropriate course of action in response to the
allegations. The Company may release additional information concerning the allegations in due course and is
committed to providing full and accurate disclosure to investors and to rebutting any false claims that attempt to
undermine confidence in the Company's business, management, operations and corporate structure.


1. Mr. Ling Wang resigned from the board of directors of the Company in May 2012 and the Company made due
announcement in respect thereof. The Company should not be responsible for Mr. Wang's personal matters,
especially those occurred after his departure.


2. On the next day after Tencent Prism's report was released, Mr. Zhiwei Zhao had an interview with a Chinese
reporter and rebutted the speculations which were groundless. Stock price of the Company recovered substantially
thereafter.


3. Mr. Zhiwei Zhao did not attend the earnings conference call of the Company in July 2013 due to health reasons. He
was absent from the call in March 2015 for the same reason. Accusations from Geoinvesting based on such

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3232916-china-finance-online-ceo-resigns-from-key-posts-in-china-amid-anti-corruption-probe 12/12


circumstantial evidence are simply innuendo and groundless.


4. Mr. Rongquan Leng's resignation was unexpected and the Company made immediate announcement upon his
resignation. The Company should not be responsible for Mr. Leng's business affairs unrelated to the Company. Prior
to his resignation, Mr. Leng's role in the Company had always been kept independent and the Company has never
been associated with Mr. Leng's other business connections. Other than standard compensation including stock
options as a board member, Mr. Leng has not acquired shares in the Company from open market or private
transactions. Geoinvesting purposefully used Mr. Leng's personal crisis to taint the Company's reputation.


5. Mr. Zhiwei Zhao has never been subject to restrictions on travels. Mr. Zhiwei Zhao remains the CEO and Chairman
of the Company. The changes of legal representatives and management positions in affiliate companies are a normal
course of action. This happens in many companies. Geoinvesting's reading and analysis aimed to feed into their
speculation that Mr. Zhao is in legal trouble. 
6. The investment in real estate project was fully disclosed. Langfang project was owned by 4 individuals when China
Finance Online invested. Later, by the time that Qingshi started investing in Langfang project, Mr. Zhiwei Zhao was
already no longer the shareholder of Qingshi. There was no related party transaction. There had been two partial
repayments. The Company will pursue legal action if the full repayment is not completed.


7. Mr. Zhao personally bought the stock for $7 per share when the stock price was below $3. Regarding the sell-off
triggered by Geoinvesting's misleading allegation, the Company is now contemplating a share buyback program.


Given the Company's current status in US market and its competitors' performance in Shenzhen Stock Exchange,
China Finance Online is reviewing options to enhance shareholder value. China Finance Online's competitors in
China include Eastmoney, Great Wisdom and Royal Flush.

I am out from JRJC, I sold at 5.5 yesterday, I hope they are right and will start a legal action if they can prove the
"misleading speculations and malicious interpretations of events". In any case I don't think this way of writing is
professional regardless the facts are true or not.
