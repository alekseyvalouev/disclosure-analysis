Do Mako Investors Realize Their Tenuous Security Position In
Oceanica?

Summary


Mako Resources investors appear to have few rights to Oceanica assets due to
senior OMEX payable security. Mako investors need to ask serious questions.


Did Josh Adam of Mako negotiate this transaction at arm's length with OMEX in line
with his fiduciary duty?


Josh Adam, SVP Finance, used Highly Questionable brokers to raise capital for
Neptune (OMEX's other mining venture), according to recent disclosures.


Is the vague J.P. Morgan Oceanica connection merely through a local Chase Private
Client Florida branch attempting to sell unregistered securities to HNW investors?


There were two new disclosures on the most recent Odyssey Marine (NASDAQ:OMEX)
conference call held in March 2014:


1) Oceanica (OMEX's 54% controlled Bahamas>Panama>Mexican mining venture) has
less than $400k in the bank.


2) Oceanica has a payable of $10mm to OMEX for services performed.


These likely indicate Mako has a very compromised status with respect to their rights as
investors, and potentially indicate that Mako investors did not conduct their proper Due
Diligence or may have been misled. Is this why they chose not to exercise their options
December 31, when they were due to expire?


OMEX raising cash via Mako appears to us to be a "backdoor" capital raise that
circumvents the SEC securities registration rules required for public companies. Let's
understand why OMEX's Oceanica Capital Raise was very different than a typical venture
capital round, and not something we have ever seen before, because of the unnecessary
weakness and danger for investors:

Why would Mako investors agree to such an unfavorable investment structure? With
OMEX as both the controlling shareholder AND senior security holder, they could
potentially demand payment on their $10mm payable and wipe out the by definition
insolvent equity position (as Oceanica appears never to have directly raised equity itself).
Given the enormous capital requirements to test and prove a mine (still waiting for the
NI43-101 report…?), why would Mako be OK with their $27.5mm instead of being directly
injected into Oceanica, going to OMEX to pay for compensation and other unrelated
expenses? Didn't Neptune/Dorado's original investors get impaired in 2012 exactly
because of this structure?


"Odyssey has provided approximately $10 million of services to the Oceanica
subsidiary… if Oceanica were to raise funds itself, then they would pay $10 million of
cash to Odyssey in the future" - Philip Devine, CFO, March 17, 2014 OMEX
conference call


Now, if Oceanica tries to raise capital directly, guess where that cash is going? It is going
to cost a LOT more to prove and build a mine, and $10mm is going to go directly back to
the OMEX parent to… pay compensation and expenses unrelated to Oceanica? Mako

doesn't earn a dime if OMEX is successful at their other projects (though this has
historically not been a potential outcome). Why are they OK with being "behind the
elephant" in their lower seniority position as investors?


What is Mako Resources exactly?


Mako Resources is managed by Josh Adam out of a one-bedroom apartment next to
NYU, according to the SEC form D. Josh Adam represents himself to be a CFA
charterholder, and as manager of Mako, has a legal fiduciary duty to those investors who
have apparently given him $27.5mm. Given Josh's other connections to OMEX via
Neptune Minerals, we have questioned whether these are truly arm's-length transactions,
and these new disclosures deepen our concerns.


Still unanswered: Why does Oceanica need to be structured through multiple layers of
offshore subsidiaries in the Bahamas and Panama? We discussed in depth their
Panamanian partner, DNA Ltd. Inc.'s director's multiple connections to alleged criminal
activity in our original report at omextruth.com on Oct 31, 2013, which has still not been
credibly addressed by OMEX management.


What other capital raises has Josh Adam been involved with?


Neptune Minerals, OMEX's other undersea mining venture, where it owns 30%. While
apparently deeply insolvent, Neptune has been trying to raise capital at a valuation far
lower than OMEX's most recent representations to public investors. See our last Neptune
smoking-gun report for more details.


More interestingly, though, is a recent SEC disclosure, where Neptune (where Josh Adam
is senior VP of Finance) finally discloses what brokers has helped them raise capital. We
understand from our friends in Tampa that Josh boasts of bringing in the CRGs ("Certified
Rich Guys") from his NY connections. Who helps him (for fees of $388k at Neptune) bring
in the capital?

We'll start with National Securities Corporation, a firm that has 57 regulatory events on
file with FINRA. The list is long, but we will cover only some of the highlights here. The full
list is available on the FINRA website.


National Securities Corporation


In 2011, National Securities Corporation was censured and ordered to pay a fine of
$175,000 in restitution to investors for failing to have reasonable grounds for selling
private placements (is this similar to the Neptune deal currently being attempted?) to
customers of the firm, and for failing to conduct due diligence into the offering. The
findings also stated that Mathew Portes (a broker with the firm) and the firm became
aware of multiple red flags regarding an offering, including liquidity concerns, missed
interest payments and defaults, that should have put them on notice of possible problems,
but the firm continued to sell the offering to customers.  Given Odyssey just wrote off the
money loaned to Neptune last quarter (implying the junior equity security is worthless -
watch that $10mm payable carefully Mako!), we find this similarity striking.


FINRA found that Portes reviewed the PPMs of these offerings and diligence reports
others prepared, but the review was cursory. FINRA also found that the due diligence
reports noted significant risks, and specifically provided that its conclusions were
conditioned upon recommendations regarding guidelines, changes in the PPMs and
heightened financial disclosure of affiliated party practices, but the firm did not investigate,
follow up on or discuss any of these potential conflicts or risks with either the issuer or any
third-party. In addition, FINRA determined that the firm, acting through Mathew Portes,
failed to enforce reasonable supervisory procedures to detect or address potential "red
flags" as related to these offerings; and the firm, acting through Mathew Portes, failed to
maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws and regulations.


What kind of due diligence has National Securities Corporation done on Neptune? Are
they aware that Neptune appears to be currently insolvent, according to Odyssey public
filings?


Further, why would the management of Neptune/Odyssey choose to work with a firm with
such a consistently questionable track record unless they were absolutely desperate?


It doesn't end there, here are just a few more of the recent multiple fines National
Securities Corporation has paid due to publicly known problems:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2144913-do-mako-investors-realize-their-tenuous-security-position-in-oceanica 6/21


In December of 2012, to resolve allegations that the firm ignored red flags involving
instances of potentially suspicious securities transactions and failed to report those
activities as required by the bank secrecy act, they paid FINRA a fine of $65,000.


In May 2011, to resolve allegations that their sales and supervision of Reg D/private
placement offerings was deficient, National Securities was censured and required to pay
restitution of $175,000 to affected customers.


In one case, National Securities Corporation has even been named a defendant in a RICO
suit.


And these are just the recent cases, it actually gets worse and goes back for over three
decades. In fact, National Securities Corporation is so bad that it's had fifty-seven
different FINRA regulatory events against the company going back to the early 1980s -
these are not one-off incidents. Meson has already uncovered shady ties between
Odyssey and unnecessary offshore Panamanian and Bahamian subsidiaries - which
Odyssey has still never explained. The question is, why would you trust these people with
your money when they're intentionally tying up with these multiple, very questionable
business partners?


International Assets Advisory


International Assets Advisory, the other broker touting Neptune stock, isn't much better.
Although IAA "only" has six regulatory events on record with FINRA, the firm and its
brokers have been tied to some legendary blow-ups.


In one case, Jeffrey Rubin, a broker at International Assets Advisory at the time, was
behind an investment scheme that lost a staggering $40,000,000 for 31 NFL players.  It's
unclear what role, if any, IAA played in this melt-down, and the investigation is ongoing.
Mr. Rubin has since been barred from the industry by FINRA.


In our opinion, it's clear both of these firms represent the bottom of the barrel among
capital raising opportunities, so it's unclear why Neptune would even consider working
with these groups unless they were desperate - but what we do know is the following:


1. Neptune paid these firms ~$388,000 in commissions in conjunction with their last equity
offering.


2. Neptune has continued to flounder, and is now back in the market for equity, capital that
we believe will be squandered needlessly like all the previous capital Neptune has raised.

3. As we highlighted in our last report, Odyssey is no longer claiming Neptune is an off-
balance sheet source of wealth creation (they removed the slide in their most recent
presentation, validating our concerns).


We continue to believe the Odyssey is in the business of selling the dream of a lottery
ticket stock - a ticket that has been proven worthless over 16 years, costing shareholders
over $180m in cumulative losses, while insiders have earned over $20mm cash.


Conclusion: Mako investors need to ask questions


Mako and Neptune investors need to start asking tough questions of the people that owe
them a legal fiduciary duty.


1) Why was Mako's $27.5mm in capital not injected directly into Oceanica, where it could
be used to build the business?


2) How much of Mako's $27.5mm has gone to paying OMEX's corporate salaries and
perks?


3) How much of the $27.5mm is still in OMEX's US bank accounts and could be sent
back, avoiding likely total loss?


4) How did OMEX determine that $10mm was a fair price to charge their controlled
subsidiary, Oceanica, for services?


5) How is Oceanica supposed to do anything with only <$400k in the bank, when it takes
millions to develop any mine? (Nautilus Minerals Inc. has spent >$300mm, and still has
negative cash flow.)


6) How is J.P. Morgan actually involved? Is it merely a local Florida Chase Private Client
branch trying to sell unregistered Oceanica securities to HNW investors?

God bless the selfless individuals over at Meson. They are saints, working tirelessly to save us from the evils of
investing in OMEX. If I was cynical I would think they were short OMEX and trying to drive the price down for their
own profit... Oh wait! They are.

Which charity? How much has been donated thus far? Based on your current holdings, how much will be
donated if/when OMEX goes to zero?

I'm confused. It appears that OMEX is being characterized as a nefarious organization by Ryan Morris of Meson
Capital Partners. But yet, how does one explain that OMEX was awarded a contract last month by a court appointed
receiver to recover the remaining gold from the remains of the SS Central America? And since OMEX was in
competition with several other salvage companies for this contract, one must assume that the court-appointed
receiver used a selection process before the contract was awarded. It seems that the court-appointed receiver would
have used due diligence in the selection process and would be accountable to the legal system for the viability of the
selection process if it were to become an issue.

I just want to add my 2 cents to the mix here. I find the diatribes by Meson Capital about OMEX to be quite
entertaining. I have to admit that they spin a good yarn, and a complicated one too, just like Robert Ludlum and other
authors of fiction. The only difference is that Ludlum and his contemporaries never tried to convince us that their
fictional stories were factual.


But, I don't want to bash Meson. It's not productive. Let's cut to the investing chase. Regardless if meson capital is
right or wrong, it makes it very difficult for an investor to invest in a company that is being relentlessly pursued by a
shorting bloodhound, regardless even if he wants to be so altruistic as to give all his proceeds to charity. It still
depresses the stock price and is contrary to my own investment thesis. The only way to stop the spiral is if and when

the shorted company shows the allegations of the shorter to be wrong by "showing us the money".  
In investing with your own hard earned money, you have to abide by lessons learned and what happens to other
stocks under similar circumstances......just look at the NQ Mobile story and how it's been playing out over the last 6
months.


As much as I like OMEX and the important historical work that they do (and I have profited from their stock in the past
as well through long investing), the only unbiased reason for investment in OMEX today under the present and
continuing short attack is if you believe that OMEX will monetize assets, make a recovery of significance such as
maybe the SS Central America, or otherwise bring in substantial revenue soon.


I'm still trying to determine by research in a number of areas, if OMEX may show us the money soon. Due diligence is
the key. Meson is doing their due diligence in their own way as a short seller, and is drawing their conclusion and
sharing it with the world, which is how the new breed of short sellers makes quick money. There is nothing wrong with
that, it's the way the market works, but we do not have to blindly accept that conclusion either.


The pivotal event right now is the SS Central America Recovery (which Meson has already picked apart in another
recent piece......which I don't want to swell their heads too much, but alot of what they researched and concluded
about the potential for that to be an uneconomic recovery does have merit based on the research that I have already
done). Of course, they don't know for sure, but neither do we. For certain, this is "THE" short term catalyst that will
move the stock significantly up or down. It really is a crap shoot, so I am going to take my own investing advice and
treat it as such. I will only invest an amount of money in OMEX at this time that I am absolutely comfortable with
losing my entire investment, unless I uncover more information that leads me to strongly believe that the Central
America has a high probabililty of being a profitable recovery, at which time I will invest more. However, I will not
share that information if I find it, because meson capital must understand that they are taking an equal risk being short
based on their beliefs, as we are being long, and nothing would be more satisfying than to see the shorts get burned.
One way or another, we do not have long to wait.........

I'm holding a fair amount of OMEX right now, but I am in full agreement it will take cold cash and a quite a bit
of it to explode the short thesis.


In a later post, Bill said


"Let's be conservative and say each coin found today can be sold for $10,000. That means ten coins will pay
the expenses of the ship for one day, "


$100,000 a day was true of seabed worker lease rates, Bill, but they are using the explorer so daily expenses
should be less than half of that on this recovery.

"Forget undersea mining and Oceanica. Their prospects are only slightly better than imaginary."


For this particular deposit I heartily disagree, but as best I understand it Odyssey has said they have been
advised to wait for environmental impact statement and mining approval, so the time lag could rival the
"Victory approval" chasm.


So personally I no longer expect near term cash from Oceanica either.....but still consider the stock to be
cheap . Holding here. May grab a little more if shorts successfully push it below 2 again.


As an aside, some of National Securities clients in the last couple years include HTGC,NIQ,PCI,ORC,LAND,
ARR,JMI, MITT and MHR

More to the point, Nuveen and Pimco...just to name a couple....are hardly fly by night operators and obviously
do not consider National Securities "shady".


The intent with Oceanica for both Odyssey and Mako is clearly to eventually sell the rights. So the extensive
collection of core samples and environmental impact report is the proper initial line of "development" and it
does cost Odyssey money to do that work....


You know that thousands of corporations have foreign subsidiaries, and that the primary reason is usually
mitigation of potential future taxes and establishment of expanded territorial business relationships.


You smear so often and with such a broad brush, it leaves most speechless....


In my opinion, your best hope remains potential albeit very slow float bloat progression. Your biggest risk and
that of all shorts is membership in such a very large short club.... if and when very good news arrives that can
backfire in a big way.

Meson Capital, 
A third of the above securities are closed end bond funds, so ...yes, they will have underperformed the equity
market. Most of the others are mortgage REITS which have 15+% yields -from your list. Pretend, for a minute
that you've been in these markets for longer than 3 minutes and stop comparing these to the S&P500.
Compare them to bond funds and the mortgage REIT index. And as Papa below states, PIMCO and
NUVEEN are not penny brokers. Your attempt at grabbing for straws is pathetic.

Another irrelvant article from Ryan who admits he is a short seller of OMEX stock. This one is timed to counter rising
stock prices which should accompany the start of salvage activities of the SS Central America this month, off the
coast of South Carolina.


The total short position in OMEX is now about 20 million shares, or 1/4 of total stock outstanding, a huge percentage.
The successful recovery of a substantial quantity of gold coins from Central America should boost the stock, and at
some point the short sellers must cover.


In 2004, over 4000 gold coins were recovered from SS Republic, US Double Eagles and Eagles, which OMEX sold
for an average $6700 each. Gold was then $400 per ounce. The US Mint sold almost 900,000 gold coins that year. In
2013, they sold 1.46 million, indicating increased public interest at present.


The court-appointed receiver, Kane, estimates more than 38,000 coins remain to be salvaged ($760,000/$20). Let's
be conservative and say each coin found today can be sold for $10,000. That means ten coins will pay the expenses
of the ship for one day, and 100 coins are worth $1 million. In the unlikely event all coins were recovered, the haul
tops out at about $380 million.


Forget undersea mining and Oceanica. Their prospects are only slightly better than imaginary. Deep sea slavage is
what this company does, they do it well, and they are starting on this season's project in a few weeks.


You have to feel sorry for the short sellers.

I am a lover of OMEX and I read all the pro's and con's with an open mind. My crystal ball died so I can not predict
what will or will not happen in the future. I do question the paychecks and perks of the big guns who run this company.
I am a dummy but it seems to me that they don't make enough money right now to support these voluminous
payments. Long ago it was found that 'bloodletting' a sick person usually killed them. As a stockholder I am a little
miffed over that.

I would like every executive to work for minimum wage unless they produce, but that ain't (sic) happening
anytime soon..ANYWHERE. Also, 
Lucas Energy, the author's largest holding, paid their CFO almost $300K, and he only worked for less than
half the year. Ryan Morris was chairman of the board at the time. Lucas Energy is a $20MM company on the
brink of bankruptcy and NYSE delisting, fwiw.

SS Central America Reality check......


One thing you guys don't know about me, is that I was a coin dealer in the 1980's and early 1990's, which is exactly
when the SS Central America Treasure was recovered and dispersed. I am still avid in the hobby and have a good
idea of what we can expect OMEX to bring up from the CA. I also have access to current pricing of the coins that are
likely down there.


We pretty much know that the majority of coins which will be recovered are $20 dollar gold pieces mostly dated 1855-
S, 1856-S and 1857-S, with a heavier concentration of 1857-S. The comment that Bill made about figuring these
coins will conservatively bring $10K apiece is inflated (unfortunately) and here's why.


Grading is all important in terms of a coins value. We know that since the CA went down in 1857, these coins are
going to be either Almost Uncirculated (AU), or uncirculated mint state grades between MS-60 and MS-65. These
effectively trade as defined price commodities on the coin trading market. For the 3 dates mentioned, MS60 goes for
about $3400, MS62 goes for about $4000, MS63 which is the mid grade and assume most UNC's will be around a
grade of MS63 go for about $5400, MS64 goes for about $7000 and MS65 goes for about $8500. On the off chance
that there might be an MS66 or two, they go for $11,000 each. So even if there is a successful recovery of something
approaching 38000 coins, you are looking at $190 million dollars, of which most of that value will be split about evenly
between OMEX and the CA Receiver.


The reality check here is that the first excavation and recovery of the CA was the easy one. All the coins were on the
surface for easy picking. OMEX is basically going in to extract the hard stuff. Even if there are really 38000 coins
down there, is it realistic to believe that they will be able to locate and extract all of them? That's a tough nut to
swallow. And think about the SS Republic recovery. OMEX said all along that there was $100,000 dollars in specie
down there. They found the easy $25000 dollars worth on the surface and recovered that......but they never found the
other $75000 in specie that is presumably still down there under the surface sand, silt, and remaining deteriorated
ship elements. Odyssey vehemently defended their position that they firmly believed the other 75K of specie is on the
Republic site or in the debris field, but they never found it and never went back again for another try, probably
because it was not economical to do so.


Also remember that the market was flooded with these $20 gold coins in the 1990's from the first excavation of the CA
and today, they are the lowest price of $20 Dollar gold pieces of that era because of the massive numbers that are
now available. If you throw more of these dates into the market, the price is going down probably another 20%. Now,
will there be any more Kellog and Humbert Assay gold Bars? We don't know and that could change the equation,
because depending on the size, weight and rarity (They are still extremely rare), these can bring big $$$ millions of
dollars each. But again, it still more likely that most of those assay bars were found in the first recovery......they
brought up 532 of them, the the heaviest one weighed 80 pounds (pounds, not oz's) and it sold for $8 million dollars,
which at the time was about 25X the spot price of gold. So even a few bars recovered by OMEX could be worth bags
of $20 gold pieces.


So, this is why in my early comments, I alluded that Meson's evaluation that this next recovery may be uneconomical,
does have merit. Make no mistake. Odyssey is in a tough and technically challenging business, and sometimes you

If you didn't read the rest of my comment it also stated that I hadn't researched his background. With that in
mind these numbers, while they seem large still don't approach SEC 13 filings nor is 'Josh' the principal
holder of these securities. Just since someone is an analyst and can pass tests doesn't necessarily mean
they have knowledge of the operations of a company, even if they 'research' the industry for over a decade.
I'm sure there are a lot of unemployed analysts out there that can give a strong counter opinion. I could run off
a litany of my accomplishments and it'll still hold the same as his, a bag of hot air. So with that I'll
acknowledge that shipbuilder and Bill's comments are much more productive than yours Sir.

Hey Papa, I'm long omex and try to stay positive. I read the book Ship of gold, and I don't understand if there was a
lot of gold still on the Central America, why did T.T. stop salvaging the ship? They apparently did hundreds of dives
and spent a lot of time on the wreck, but they say they only salvaged 5% of the site? I know the people at Omex have
a lot more info than we have access to. I don't think they would go to the expense and time to go there if they didn't
think it was worth while. Your thoughts.

Bob Evans thinks a great deal of gold is still onboard. His hypothesis is counting on passengers keeping a
very large number of double eagles in their own quarters and leaving them behind. So scattered but
potentially very valuable coins...as best I understand it anyway... would be the main play in his view.


Ship's research and deductions below are well worth reading and it is important to know, as he stated, that
Odyssey may decide not to proceed if they view it as an uneconomical. I assume they would then proceed
with a commodity salvage job...actually they have said they plan to do one this year whether they proceed or
not.


Seems to me it is indeed true that nobody knows yet exactly what is still on and around wreck...


Odyssey is indeed a very interesting stock, but I gotta admit...unlike so many others who follow it....even in
the instances when I have made money from trading it (lost some too...fortunately less) I do not exactly find it
"fun" at all.....lol...not so far anyway ; - )

Zeus,


Based on what was found laying on top of the ocean floor by Tommy Thompson, even though it represented only 5%
of the site, he probably recovered the lions share of the gold. When a ship goes down with treasure that is enclosed in
some sort of box, it tends to stay concentrated in one place. Odyssey found this to be the case in their recovery of the
SS Republic as well. In the case of the Central America, Tommy Thompson brought up all the easy gold that was
stored in the ships secure lock box that was laying on the surface of the ocean floor. The thinking behind the
remaining treasure is that not all passengers would have given their gold to the ships purser for storage in the secure
lock box. Many would have simply kept it with them for their own safe keeping. I've looked at the SF mint records
which show how many people and their names had submitted raw gold for assaying to the mint, and were
subsequently paid in formal gold coin minted by the SF mint, and who were also listed passengers on the CA. Many
of them might have kept their money in their own possession. So, everyone agrees there is certainly more gold and
silver specie on the wreck site, but the 64,000 dollar question is, how much is really still down there, and how easy (or
difficult) will it be to find and recover. Then, of course, there is the speculation about the US Government gold
shipment that may or may not be on the site. There is intense debate and disagreement if the US Government gold
was actually ever on the CA. No one knows for sure, but Of course, even if it is, I have no clue how ownership of that
US government property will play out. Usually, the US government never gives up it's rights to anything that is
government owned. So even if it is found and recovered, you can't count it being of any value to Odyssey or the CA
receiver, unless a court decides in OMEX's favor.....not likely, but even if so would take years to resolve in court.


For the record, based on the research I have done so far, I believe that the receiver's expert's estimate on how much
gold is still on the wrecksite, is overly optimistic. He says there may be about $760,000 dollars of face value specie
still on the site. To date, from mint records, I have only been able to confirm about $90,000 of face value specie that
was paid to passengers who boarded the CA and would have had that money with them. But, understand that I don't
have all the documentation available to me that the court's expert may have, and they probably spent more time in
trying to figure out how much is still down there, than I have. Ultimately, as Green River has pointed out, no one will
know until Odyssey explores the site and starts recovery ops.


But here is what you want to watch for. Odyssey is going to the site soon or are already there and will do a pre-
disturbance study and evaluation, which will be the basis for the 1st decision that they have to make. That decision is
"can we find enough evidence to justify excavating and recovering the site?". If they find there is not much there
making for an un-economical recovery, and decide to report that to the court, then you will see a press release that
states as such and OMEX stock will immediately tank.


If they find evidence to continue, there will probably be alot of dead air (silence and no news one way or another) until
their next earnings report where they always give investors a status on all their active projects. Investors would
probably view that as good news and you will probably see the stock begin to go up, until OMEX begins making
recoveries and the exact amounts of those recoveries are made public in press releases. Depending on how much (or
how little) they report as actual recoveries, the stock will act accordingly.


In this case, this is like playing a single round of craps at the casino. I've put my money on the pass line. If Odyssey
reports good news in the next few months, I win. If not, I lose a substantial amount of my money. Remember, this is
nothing more than a bet. Not me, not the receivers experts, not anybody knows how much is left on the site and

whether it is easy enough to recover in a reasonable amount of time to make the endeavor economical. Whatever I
have on the table in OMEX is money that I'm not worried about losing. OMEX has always been a challenging stock to
profit from.......but it is one of the more "FUN" stocks to play around in. That's why I still follow it and dabble
accordingly. Good luck.

Hey Ship Thanks for the reply. You clearly know more about this than I do , so I really appreciate your input. I do
agree with you on omex being a fun stock to follow, it's exciting. In spite of some mistakes (learning curve) I think
Odyssey is run by some pretty smart people, so they must think the Central America is worth a look. Thanks, Zeus5

Zeus,


You are correct about about OMEX management. They also have extensive historical documentation resources, on
the order of a library, including a seasoned research team. They also will have a much better idea of what is down
there than the general public. But there is one caveat for this recovery. On all of OMEX's past targets and recoveries,
they have been 100% sure that the sites had never been located by anyone else and never been salvaged. So they
could rely on the resource records they researched and be confident of what treasure was likely to be found on the
site. This is not the case with the Central America. They know and everyone knows that this site has been recovered
substantially already. And that is what is making it very difficult to assess what treasure is really left. Not just for them
as the new contract salvors, but for all of us as investors as well. Had the Central America not been found and
recovered in the 1990's and OMEX had just discovered it, OMEX's stock would be sitting at $10 bucks or more right
now even in pre-recovery. Unfortunately, it didn't happen that way and the stock price is depressed because of all the
uncertainty of what dreggs are left, plus all the shorting shenanigans. Odyssey is in uncharted waters here because
they have never been faced with this situation before and most investors have probably not thought about the fact that
OMEX will have to make a decision about economical recovery once they have evaluated the site, and the possibility
that they may have to bow out of the job because they can't make any money. They have never been faced with that
decision before, because even if the treasure they believed was on the ship could not be seen or verified, they always
knew on past projects that it HAD TO BE THERE, because no one else had ever recovered the site. So the
excavation and recovery decision was already pre-decided. They would excavate and try to find what they knew had
to be there. Obviously as stated, that's not the case with the second recovery of the CA.


But, on the flip side, the CA is not the only project that they have in the pipeline, so even if CA bombs out, the stock
won't go to zero. They have other commodity recovery projects. But still I'm not willing to go in more than $10k small
stake. Good Luck!

Meson......Ok. Yes, I recall that now, but they did drop the project based on that information. My point was that the CA
is a project where they will have to make a decision based on what they see on the site, knowing that it has already
been salvaged once. Thanks for the correction.

OMEX RECOVERS ALMOST 1000 OUNCES OF GOLD IN 2 HOUR RECON DIVE ON CENTRAL AMERICA. MORE
GOLD INGOTS VISIBLE ON SURFACE. SITE NOT DISTURBED SINCE 1991


Gold Recovered During First Reconnaissance Dive Indicates SS Central America Has Not Been Disturbed Since
1991 
9:42a ET May 5, 2014 (GlobeNewswire)  
Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (Nasdaq:OMEX), a pioneer in the field of deep-ocean exploration, recovered nearly
1,000 ounces of gold during the first reconnaissance dive to the SS Central America shipwreck site on April 15,2014.


Recovered gold included five gold ingots and two $20 Double Eagle coins (one 1857 minted in San Francisco and
one 1850 minted in Philadelphia). The gold ingots were stamped with assayer's marks and weights that range from
96.5 to 313.5 troy ounces.


The two-hour reconnaissance dive was conducted during the transit of Odyssey's research vessel, the Odyssey
Explorer, from the United Kingdom to Charleston, South Carolina, to mobilize for the project, which is being conducted
under contract with the receiver of Recovery Limited Partnership (RLP). RLP director of operations Craig Mullen and

RLP chief scientist/historian Bob Evans accompanied the Odyssey team for the dive operation. Mr. Evans previously
served as chief scientist, historian and later as curator for the initial Central America recovery operations conducted
between 1988 and 1991.


During the dive, Odyssey's ROV ZEUS flew over the shipwreck to assess the current condition of the site. Gold ingots
and other artifacts were clearly visible on the surface of the site during the dive and no excavation was required for
their removal. Given the reconnaissance purpose of the dive, only five gold ingots, two gold coins, a bottle, a piece of
pottery, a sample of the shipwreck's wooden structure, and an element of a scientific experiment that was left at the
site more than 20 years ago were recovered. The positions of the recovered artifacts were documented for
archaeological purposes and will be noted in the detailed site plan that is being created. The archaeological
excavation of the site will be undertaken once the pre-disturbance survey provides detailed documentation of the site.


"This dive confirms for me that the site has not been disturbed since 1991, when I was last there," said Bob Evans
chief scientist/historian for RLP.


RLP director of operations Craig Mullen added, "The skill exhibited and results achieved during the initial
reconnaissance dive reinforces our belief that the Odyssey team was the absolute best choice for this project. In
addition to the cargo recovery operation, we plan to collect deep-ocean biological samples for Dr. Timothy Shank, a
deep-ocean biologist and head of the Molecular Ecology and Evolution Laboratory at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. Our objective is to document and provide Dr. Shank with samples of species that have returned to the site
since previous operations ended. Odyssey's documentation capabilities will contribute significantly to scientific
understanding of deep-ocean biological processes. This continues a history of supporting scientific research at the
site."


Odyssey was selected for the project by Ira Owen Kane, the court-appointed receiver who represents Recovery
Limited Partnership (RLP) and Columbus Exploration LLC (CE). The contract has been approved by the Common
Pleas Court of Franklin County, Ohio, which has given Mr. Kane responsibility with overseeing the recovery project.


The archaeological excavation, valuable cargo recovery and ship-board conservation will be conducted and
underwritten by Odyssey on behalf of RLP. In return, Odyssey will receive 80% of recovery proceeds until a fixed
mobilization fee and a negotiated day rate are paid. Thereafter, Odyssey will receive 45% of the recovery proceeds.

Guys,


I submitted an article to SA on the recent recon dive 5 bars brought up by OMEX last week and 2 gold coins. They
liked it but want me to add links to my sources, which I'm trying to do, but I'm a little computer challenged, so I'm not
sure if I will be able to complete the article to their satisfaction. But here's the jist and it's important.


I researched recent auction results for private mint assay gold bars (Kellog and Humbert, Justh, and a few others)
which it is probable that the gold bars are that type since all the bars brought up in the Tommy Thompson recovery
were that type. All the news outlets are valuing the 1000 ounces of gold at spot price of $1300 per ounce and
assigning the value at $1.3M dollars. They are dead wrong on the valuations. I wish I could buy those bars at spot,
because I would make a handsome profit. Recent auction records show these types of bars in the common sizes
between 20oz and 100oz are selling at coin auctions for about 4 times spot gold value. Larger ones like the 313 oz

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2144913-do-mako-investors-realize-their-tenuous-security-position-in-oceanica 20/21


bar that was brought up would command an even higher multiple. I also sited in the article that the largest bar brought
up in 1990 was 80 pounds and it sold for $8M dollars with spot gold at that time being $400/ounce.....it commanded
21 times spot gold. Bottom line is that the bars and two doubles eagles that OMEX just brought up have a real value
of about $5.2M dollars, and maybe more. This is really significant since their press release which Donindm provided
above says that they could see more bars just laying on the floor surface. Between coins and bars, in my opinion, the
remaining gold numismatically could be worth over $100M. And selling at those prices is done every day in the coin
market and at auctions. I still buy and sell alot of coins. There are clearly more bars just laying around for the picking
down there. So theoretically, if every 5 bars they recover equal about 1000 ounces of gold in varying weights per bar,
then every 5 bars brought up will be worth about $5M dollars. So if they ONLY bring up 50 bars, that equates to $50M
dollars. Throw the numismatically significant gold coins in which they should find many thousands, I already checked
values which are between $5K-$10K each depending on condition......I think $100M dollar recovery is easily within the
the realm of possibility, now that we have OMEX first sight-seen report on what they can see on the site. Just for the
record, as the price of OMEX stock has declined (because most uninformed investors think OMEX brought up only a
paltry $1.3M in gold), I've been buying more OMEX. At between 2.00-2.10 per share, the price is not reflecting the
true value of what is now much better understood in terms of remaining gold and it's value which OMEX will recover
and report on in just a few months. That's a very short time to wait. I can feel the ZOOM!! As always, these are just
my opinions, but I have done my research and I am familiar with what coin dealers and collectors pay for numismatic
collectibles and coins.

search away. Same for gold coin prices on the PCGS website. Now that many of the uncertainties about the CA site
have been put to rest, it's really only a matter of a few months to wait before recovery information and value estimates
start coming out over the news wires. I think the shorts are going to continue to try and depress the stock price
through May and early June, but when real gold quantities start coming up from the CA site, they will start running for
cover.
