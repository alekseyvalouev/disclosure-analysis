Longtop makes an announcement
Longtop Financial Technologies - the subject of several posts on this blog - has made a statement. 
 
Here is the release: 


HONG KONG, May 23, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Longtop Financial Technologies
Limited ("Longtop" or the "Company") (NYSE:LFT - News) announced today that the
Company's registered independent accounting firm, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd.
("DTT"), has resigned as auditor of the Company by letter dated May 22, 2011.  The
Company also announced that Derek Palaschuk, the Company's Chief Financial Officer,
tendered his resignation by letter, dated May 19, 2011, and the Board has taken his
resignation under advisement.   


In its letter, DTT stated that it was resigning as the result of, among other things (1) the
recently identified falsity of the Company's financial records in relation to cash at bank
and loan balances (and possibly in sales revenue); (2) the deliberate interference by
certain members of Longtop management in DTT's audit process; and (3) the unlawful
detention of DTT's audit files.  DTT further stated that DTT was no longer able to rely on
management's representations in relation to prior period financial reports, that
continued reliance should no longer be placed on DTT's audit reports on the previous
financial statements, and DTT declined to be associated with any of the Company's
financial communications in 2010 and 2011. 


Longtop's Audit Committee has retained US legal counsel and authorized the retention
of forensic accountants to conduct an independent investigation into the matters raised
by DTT's resignation letter.  The Audit Committee has also initiated a search for a new
auditor.  Further, Longtop was advised by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that the SEC was conducting an inquiry regarding related matters.
 Longtop intends to cooperate fully with the SEC's inquiry. 


Longtop is unable to determine the full effect of these matters, including whether any
restatement of its historical financial statements will be required, until the Audit
Committee completes its review.  Longtop cannot predict when it will announce its
financial results for Q4 2011, or when it will file its Form 20F for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2011.


 
Enough said.

Massive pats on the back to you and Citron. You guys absolutely nailed it. Great job, and
it was a pleasure to hop along for the ride. Thank you. Should you find yourself in
Brooklyn, drinks are on me.

You just have to exercise the puts. The question is will the company fight or not fight
delisting. Not fight - trade quickly. 
 
Fight - 2 months. 
 
Exercise your puts.

My understanding was, you can't exercise if your broker can't find a borrow.


May 24, 2011 at 12:48 AM


John Hempton said...


I had no trouble finding a borrow. But if others did that is very bad news. 
 
I think they should bring back naked short selling - cover when the stock relists. 
 
My views on naked short selling are however well known.

John, do the company officers pay a price in term so criminal punishment when one of
these Chinese frauds blow apart? Do they sit back in China and enjoy their ill gotten
gains, or do they ever get extradited? Does the Chinese government care about this stuff
(do they acutually do anything about it)?

So far no the Chinese management of these companies pay no price. Indeed I think it is
sport to rip of wide-eyes. 
 
Derek - the (now former) CFO of Longtop is however a Canadian. 
 
Could be interesting for him.

I don't think all the Chinese companies set out to defraud investors. It's more like early
20th century capitalism meeting 21st century security markets. Private companies in
China are starved of capital so they came to where it is easier to access that capital. US
play the role of intermediating Chinese savings back into Chinese investments. This is
what the US financial service sector is paid for. So don't blame all the Chinese
entrepreneurs, many of which have little understanding of what US securities laws
require. The auditors/underwriters/brokers are the ones that really failed the investors. 
Many of the RTO companies were issuing equities at below 10x P/E while promising
above 20% growth. It is like buying CCC rated paper yielding over 20%. You can't expect
all the cheap CCC bonds to pay good, can you? Investors knew what they were getting
into.

@ Anonymous, your analogy to CCC rated debt is completely inappropriate. 
 
Longtop, Universal Travel, Media Express and Agritech are NOT hard working groups of
people who had a good product and just lost money because they were in the wrong
business or because they made an understandable mistake. They were frauds. 
 
If you buy CCC rated debt you know there is a good chance you will get restructured. But
you are entitled to expect that the numbers you are presented have been audited and not
"stir-fried" with the help of corrupt bank officers. Unfortunately that condition didn't obtain
in the case of the stocks mentioned above. 
 
Try another analogy. I'd start with Bernie Madoff.

John, 
 
w.r.t. CCC bonds: Sure there are outright frauds like you said. Are there no frauds among
CCC bond issuers? 
w.r.t. auditors failing I completely agree. Actually in the cases I came by I have not seen
many company founders profitting (okay other than that the companies got capital) from
dumping stocks. The promoters (private placement participants prior to the RTOs) made
out really well through low priced warrants and convertible preferreds. Founders typically
have pretty stringent lock-up requirements. If you follow the money I'd say promoters are
the ones that should be punished. So should the auditors. At least US law enforcement
can reach these people. So I disagree -- the Chinese weren't the Madoffs. They couldn't
even find their way around the Wall Street. 
LFT was an IPO right? In that case the underwriters should be on the hook if there was
fraud. I believe the legal liability is pretty cut and dry in IPOs. The RTO cases are murkier.

I'd not heard that 'Chinaman' was offensive. Since when - and who decides ? 
 
"Indeed I think it is sport to rip off wide-eyes" 
 
Isn't that racial stereotyping ? 
 
On a more general note, I'd thought that Chinese businessmen, especially outside China,
were generally renowned for hard but straight dealing, their word is their bond etc - which
was part of what made them such successful 'market-dominant minorities', to use
Thomas Sowell's phrase. 
 
Is this no longer the case ?

branches that had previously verified that Longtop’s cash really was on deposit. And that

Laban, 
I didn't realize this is an Australian board. In the US it is well-known that the word is
offensive, for historical reasons. To those who say it is just like Englishman or Irishman,
no actually it isn't. The corresponding grammatical construction would be Chineseman.
Chinaman was a purposefully non-grammatical construction, hence its offensiveness. At
least that is my understanding. 
To your other question, most of the RTO companies are the ones that could not access
capital market inside China because they could not meet Chinese listing standards. That
is not to say that there aren't a whole lot of accounting frauds inside China. Corruption is
an endemic problem in China so you will be hard pressed to find any company that is
squeaky clean.
