Is Morgan Stanley's Veeva Upgrade A Belated April Fools Prank?

Summary


Morgan Stanley now believes Veeva is a TAM expansion story.


This is comical because in 5 months they have failed to prove how the current TAM
is anywhere close to $5 billion.


"Rigged" is the appropriate word to describe the game being played by underwriters
and sell-side analysts in Tech IPOs these days.


At some point one starts to wonder whether the analysts covering Veeva (NYSE:VEEV)
need to seek financial therapy for their TAM Denial Syndrome.


A few months ago, we pointed out how the sell-side work on Veeva was exhibiting
elements of 'backfire'. We can now safely say these analysts have become hopelessly
entrenched.


As a quick refresher, the basic premise of 'backfire' is that when confronted with facts that
prove them wrong, opinionated individuals in highly specialized professions react very
differently from the uninformed. Basically, instead of changing their minds and
acknowledging the correct facts, they entrench themselves even deeper into their existing
view.


Today, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded Veeva to overweight based on a "TAM
expansion" thesis.


YES, A TAM EXPANSION THESIS!


Here is how it reads:


"Veeva is a TAM expansion story, in our view, and the company is executing on that
front with early success in both Vault and Network. However, the scope of the
investment debate has narrowed to Veeva's seat growth potential in Sales Force
Automation (SFA), which in turn has driven a 40% pullback in the stock from the
highs." MS Veeva, April 2, 2014

Is this a joke?


It's been nearly five months since we exposed this mess, and not a single report has
bothered to address the current market size. Now, Morgan Stanley wants you to focus on
how that TAM is going to grow from here.


Do these guys think they are going to pull off a Kansas City Shuffle?


As for the fact that $5 billion is nowhere remotely close to what the market size is today,
well, we got precisely one sentence on that in the report.


"There has been significant debate regarding the potential size of Veeva's market
opportunity, and while we view the $5b current market opportunity presented at the
IPO as fair, we think the bigger story is the $44b IDC estimates Life Sciences
companies spend on IT each year, and how much of that Veeva can capture over
time"- MS Veeva, April 2, 2014


Fair?


It's off by a multiple of 5X!

Yes, we have painstakingly researched the top 50 and modeled out the seat penetration
problem. But to be frank, that issue pales in comparison to the ASP problem in core CRM.
We have identified data points for pricing at top ten pharma in emerging market
deployments that if the whole market converged to such a level would imply a sub $200
million TAM for LS CRM today. While we do not expect this to happen, we cannot take any
research seriously that simply has no interest in addressing such a material element.
Furthermore, we can assure you that Veeva's ASPs will come under pressure because of
their high market share in the United States. Incremental seat additions will be coming
from much lower ASP markets, and renewals in the USA are likely going to exhibit pricing
pressure. There are smaller competitors that could price at $50 a seat for a large seat
deal, and still make money. And we are aware of pricing from larger competitors for
smaller seat deals that are as low as $70 a month. Run those numbers against the 400k
reps in the top 50 and tell us with a straight face that the current TAM presented at the
IPO is "fair." Yet, in this entire 24-page report the word ASP doesn't come up even once!

Furthermore, how can you call Vault a $2 billion TAM? Or model $870 million in revenue
for it by 2028?


All of EMC IIG did $647 million in revenue last year. This is across all verticals, and not
just Life Sciences. And if you understand this space you will realize that the price point
replacement proposition here is nowhere near the same as it was with Siebel in CRM. And
with most of these pharmas having enterprise wide agreements in place; Veeva will more
often than be fighting nothing but the annual maintenance contract.


We have done extensive research, which shows MDM customer master is $200 million
max and a highly commoditized space.


Furthermore, if you have gone through implementation after implementation you will get
familiar with things like Informatica cloud as well as Onekey integrations, which will give
you some serious insight into just how strong the competition is here.


Suffice to say when we go through this math, we can't help but wonder whether this model
was constructed in Neverland.


And what is this nonsense about the SFDC contract renewal:


"Veeva also signed an early renewal of their contract with Salesforce.com
(NYSE:CRM) on favorable terms, extending it by ten years through 2025, and
thereby removing a key risk"- MS Veeva , April 2, 2014


Favorable? To whom? Salesforce.com obviously!


Veeva's 10-K risk disclosures regarding this contract's 'true-up' provision look like they
were cut and pasted from our last report. And the key risk from SFDC has always been its
PAAS nature and the ability of customers to leverage the existing development ecosystem
to build their own solution, and not of SFDC promoting their own competing life sciences
specific solution. The terms of this renewed contract make that risk even more clear.


The sad thing here is that these analysts don't realize that when you expose something
that stinks as bad as this TAM story does, people tend to come forward. The discrepancy
is just so huge that they can't resist chiming in. So, this is not a debate between Bulls and
Bears. This is a debate between those seeking the truth, and a group obfuscating it; who
seem willing to go to just about any length to help bury it.

We're sure none of you will be surprised but in our view the real market that is "rigged" is
the sell-side coverage and investment banking practices of these institutions bringing
these tech companies public. Maybe Mr. Lewis will be doing his next book on the "SAAS
TAM Boys" and our crusade for the truth.

Recently a lot of these Seeking Alpha articles are starting to remind me of watching the prime time cable news shows:
a lot of overheated rhetoric and shouting, aimed at getting viewers and making a name for the author (and more
realistically, juicing their short positions). Some of them are legitimately good and make you re-think your opinion of a
name, but I think a lot of these negative articles are just the result of traders aping the success of Citron, Muddy
Waters, etc.


I think it's time to let go of your short.


VEEV strikes me as the type of name that waits for people to stop watching it before it makes its move.


The valuation for VEEV is now compelling. It's a good growth story. It's time to buy VEEV

They just placed a large secondary offering. I don't want to say that they feel obliged to boost the stock now for a
while, but it seems to be the norm that stocks find support for several weeks following a secondary offering. Years ago

a broker once told me, while pawning a secondary offering, that I could expect a 15-20% gain in the next two months
or so. That was exactly what happened, after which the stock sagged to 20% below the price of the secondary
offering. I've seen the same happen with many other stocks. I covered my short calls yesterday, before an investor
conference today and earnings in a few days, and expect to short again.

conclusion to short the stock. You don't have any facts to dispute his research so why do you bother pointing
out the obvious? Given that it seems like there are still those in denial about the facts including Morgan

Slim Shady: appropriate name. Many, many articles written on SA are written by people without a position in
the stock they are writing about. I venture to say "the majority" (without researching it), that is why I bothered
to point it out and I wanted to make sure all were aware, had they not noticed. I would guess you are short
also. Certainly, to follow your logic: Why would you "waste your time writing" a response to my statement if
you "did not have a position"? So, according to your logic, you are talking your book, Shady.


03 Apr 2014, 07:01 PM


Slim Shady, Contributor
Yes, Colonel, you are so perceptive to think that I also have a short position, just as there is a high probability
you are long the stock given that you a) read the article and b) made a "cautionary" disclosure for those
people who didn't read the disclosure at the top of the article.


Prior to Suhail publishing his initial article, I knew nothing about VEEV. Because I have been in the investment
business for 25 years and ran my own hedge fund for over 10 years before retiring, I have the ability to
understand the difference between great work and the "majority" you speak of who simply blow smoke out
their ass. If you have read any of his previous articles, you would understand the depth of the research to
support his short thesis which was derived from the facts he painstakingly discovered. If you can't tell the
difference between his work and the majority, you should not be investing on your own behalf.


Thank you for pointing out the appropriateness of my screen name Slim Shady. In the words of the real Slim
Shady, I just don't give a f*ck. When you try to put me down for my screen name and not for the content of
what I say, you are like every other imbecile I had to deal with when I was in the investment business who
know nothing and don't even realize it.

User 63931
First, Slim, I am not long this stock. Second, I have read many fine contributions by individuals who had no
position in the stock they were writing about (the majority who you state “simply blow smoke out their ass”).


Next, I simply wrote: “Slim Shady: appropriate name.” Seems that your imagination has conjured up some
putdown. I do not see very much derogatory with either the word “appropriate” or “name”, and neither with the
combination. Quite the imagination, Slim. However, I am concerned that you admonished me with: “When you
try to put me down for my screen name and not for the content of what I say”, and you state “the majority you
speak of who simply blow smoke out their ass” and later you assert that I am “like every other imbecile”.
Seems you want the rest of us judge “the content of what” is stated, yet you violate your own rule.

Lastly, my portfolio increased more than the S&P500 did last year by over 10%, so I’m fine with “investing on”

What does that indicate? History will tell you absolutely nothing. Real investors measure themselves by
process and not outcome. If you were long plug in , you'd have outperformed by a mile. Yet, if we saw that
name in a managers portfolio we'd be running from you.


04 Apr 2014, 03:32 AM

“History will tell you absolutely nothing.” My, let’s take a look at your article above. Here are the beginnings of
several of your paragraphs: 
“A few months ago” 
“As a quick refresher” 
“It's been nearly five months” 
“Yes, we have painstakingly researched” 
“We have done extensive research”


It seems to me that your article is about the recent “history” of this company. How can you say that “History
will tell you absolutely nothing”? What does that say about your article? I find your statement concerning
“History” ridiculous.


Then you wrote: “Real investors measure themselves by process and not outcome”. Show me a source that
supports this. Investing is about making money. How can this NOT be about the outcome? Sure there is a
process, but I was addressing Slim Shady’s assertion that I should not be investing on my own behalf. And
somehow, you think I should address this by describing a process and not an outcome??? Are you serious?
Moreover, the discussion was between me and Slim Shady. You have added nothing to that discussion and
you have wasted my time.


Lastly, I have no idea what the following sentence you wrote means: “If you were long plug in , you'd have
outperformed by a mile.” Maybe you should proof your work before you post. No need for you to reply. I'd hate
to see you embarrass yourself so badly once more.

User6xxxx- This work is the best you can find on SA. It is well proved and the outcome is positive, we are
making a LOT of money. The concept is that making money is a process that sometimes can require more
time, depending on market conditions and several factors.

This is an interesting comment . . . ""There has been significant debate . . . "


I haven't seen significant debate of your total addressable market analysis, so I assume he is referring to phone
conversations he has been having with brokerage clients in response to your articles.


I haven't seen the MS report. Does he address the TAM?


I think the question remains how will VEEV grow into its valuation if the TAM is a fraction of that which mgnt and
broker analysts are promising?


Make sense?

Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The note was perplexing to say the least. Unlike the other brokers, MS did not have a buy
on the stock. You'd think with the sell-off in SAAS the analyst would have thanked her lucky stars as the
market gave her an out to significantly bring down her price target without having to say anything re her
thesis. Instead, she decides to try to completely rechannel the debate towards a growing TAM without even
bothering to address the issues regarding the current TAM. This by the way seems to be an agreed upon
strategy as well fargo steered the convo in this direction yesterday, and veeva's ceo is now tossing around the
total pie idc number a lot more than he was before. Attempted misdirection to say the least.


The sad thing is what these analysts don't get is that we were content to leave them alone at this point. Now,
its very hard to walk away from this kind of behaviour without calling it out. And they clearly have no grasp on
what investors are focusing on. You think the price action yesterday was a coincidence? We can only imagine
that a lot of sophisticated investors who read that report saw it for was it was in two seconds (total
desperation), and piled onto an opportunity to short the stock into that.


And what about the salesforce news last night?


Explains a lot about the rush to renew their reseller agreement on onerous terms.

Flash Boys is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for

@suhail - you mixed few things together. 1) Informatica Cloud - is a data integration and migration tool, it is used in
case of Veeva as way to get information from data source (e.g. Legacy Siebel application of SAP) to Veeeva (target
system). Because Veeva is built on top of salesforce platform you use Informatica cloud connector to salesforce and
all you do is to setup connection to Veeva VOD objects that differentiate salesforce from Veeva. So there is no
difference how you use Informatica cloud with any other salesforce instance.


2) Cegedim OneKey - is a data provider that gives you information about hospitals, doctors, specialities, all assigned
to Pharma specific hierarchies using Bricks and Zip. Cegedim is market leader in providing data that's true for Europe.
I cannot comment on us as I've not done any Veeva project on us soil.


Conclusion


1) Informatica cloud - is a middle ware that allow you to connect cloud applications with legacy and other cloud. There
is no competition between Veeva and Informatica because these are totally different products by purpose. There even
big synergy between these two because one of the reason why Veeva could replace Siebel and other legacy app is
that both Informatica cloud and Veeva are seen by FDA as something you can use and not break compliance. Not
many other middle ware out there has same status as Informatica (this is also public company traded as Informatica
Corprafion under symbol INFA)


2) Cegedim OneKey - is a data source that can feed any application and is in Pharma used as a trusted data source
for mater data system. Typical way how you can leverage OneKey is following


- you have master database that is used as customer master 
- instead you maintain data about all hospitals, doctors, specialities and territories you create data feed 
- this data feed is connection between (source: Cegedim OneKey database) and (target: your system for example
Oracle database that work as customer master) 
- then you take Informatica cloud and connect Oracle mater (that has been previously connected with Cegedim
OneKey) and you create data sync task that will take data from Oracle and push it to Veeva  
- because you are technically connecting Oracle database and Salesforce (Veeva is build on top of salesforce) you
will create sync task between Oracle and Salesforce


-----


Sounds easy! But technically it is more complicated as you have to map data from one system to another and that is
not as easy as done if you try to migrate millions of records. Therefore once you do this integration and it works you
will very unlikely will be willing to ditch Veeva for something else.


Technologies are not changing just because stocks as moving up or high.

Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Where did we say that informatica cloud or one key integration increase the liklihood of
ditching veeva in crm?


The point of mentioning all the implementations we came across using these companies solutions speaks to
Veeva's aspirations to obliterate those competitors in MDM. Yes, onekey is quite embedded as a customer
master and pharma specific. And informatica vis a vis siperian is not rolling over and dying because someone
is throwing around buzz words and giant IT spend numbers to promote their stock. Same story for EMC in LS
ECM for which you btw just indirectly outlined a pretty compelling reason for why that will be a slog and then
some.

Informatica Cloud makes it easier to switch to anything but it could be said about any vendor agnostic middle
ware. (there are many on the market Informatica is just one of the most used out there)


07 Apr 2014, 03:52 AM


jiri75
@suhail not exactly, problem with Veeva is that it is architecture is very complicated and demands many
setup that will be costly if you try to replicate it with Salesforce or other solution. Yes, it is possible like you can
write any program with Java or .NET in theory - but from technology investment rational not. Reason is simple
if you have Veeva this means you've invested in this platform and its implementation. It took many months
and you are now in the process when you need business use it - and thus unlock business value. If you ditch
Veeva or other solution there must be business reason (not cost of license). Business reason would be that,
1) user adoption is low - which is not case of veeva, 2) technology would create loophole in your security -
again something that veeva prevents by building on top of Salesforce platform, 3) productivity of users would
drop - this is again very unlikely event because veeva is an expert in enabling users, 4) lagre GSI (such as
Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini...etc.) would stop servicing it - it is also very unlikely as long Veeva is
generated revenue for them and there is demand from side of customers (that is driving Veeva adoption) this
is very unlikely to happen (especially if many of large GSIs generate quite significant revenue out of Veeva
projects).


Conslusion


If you are short on Veeva it is understandable because market is in panic mode and share price dropping
even to Salesforce and others. However share price has nothing to do with success of Veeva in adoption of
their solution. As long Veeva will, a) keep their solutions compliant with FDA and other regulations, b) user
adoption will grow, c) continue to innovate and users will see it valuable - they will retain their core customer
base.


Key answer here is not what happening in stock exchange market but if veeva will be to retain customers and
keep satisfaction high.

, “Strong quarter and guidance above expectations. Veeva delivered a strong FY1Q15 quarter that may further
undermine the bear case on the stock (down ~40% in last 3 months). Highlights include subscription billings growth of
68%, total billings growth of 54% and subscription revenue growth of 74%, all while delivering 24% non-GAAP
operating margins. Veeva also raised FY15 guidance by $7m on both top-line and operating income, indicating solid
momentum.


"We like the solid progress in North America (the majority of core CRM business) and momentum with new products,
and view the 2H guidance as likely conservative. Reiterate Buy.”
