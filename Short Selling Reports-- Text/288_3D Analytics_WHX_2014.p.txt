Whiting USA Trust Is Likely To Lose Half Its Value In The Coming Days

(Editors' Note: This article covers micro-cap stocks. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


Introduction:


It is easy to estimate the value of Whiting USA Trust I (NYSE:WHX), and we strongly
believe it currently should be trading at around $2.30. Investors shouldn't pay much
attention to current yield, because WHX will trend towards zero until the trust terminates
on or around March 31, 2015. Consequently, we assign a sell rating on the stock with a
$2.30 price target.


Overview:


1. We exposed Gyrodyne Co. of America Inc. (NASDAQ:GYRO) as grossly overvalued,
and GYRO has lost almost half its value in the past month.


2. Citron Research called attention to WHX and Great Northern Iron Ore Properties
(NYSE:GNI), both of which are trusts that will liquidate in mid-2015. GNI has fallen
about 68 percent this year, and we expect WHX to do the same.


3. We are 100-percent certain WHX will trend toward zero until the trust terminates on or
around March 31, 2015. We expect the remaining dividends to add up to $2.30.


4. We strongly believe WHX is worth $2.30 (conservatively) and is likely to lose half its
value in the coming days.

GYRO has fallen almost 50 percent in less than a month:


On Jan. 6, 2014, we wrote an article for Seeking Alpha on Gyrodyne Co. of America Inc.
and initiated a sell rating on the stock with a $5.70 price target. Prior to that article's
release, the stock closed on Jan. 3, 2014 at $10.79. Immediately following the article's
release, the stock plummeted to $6 in less than a month. WHX is similar to GYRO in that
both securities are within a trust and both are liquidating. Just as we were highly confident
in our prediction that GYRO would lose half its value, we believe WHX will do the same
when investors realize the degree to which it is overvalued.


GNI has fallen around 68 percent in 2014:


Citron Research is a company noted for identifying and exposing greatly overvalued
stocks. Citron published an article on its web site on Jan. 24, 2011 calling attention to the
gross overvaluation of WHX. The article blames the overvaluation on investors relying too
heavily on computer dividend screens and trading based on the high yield while forgetting,
ignoring or failing to understand the fact the trust has a finite lifespan. The article
concludes that WHX should be priced at a value more in line with the remaining
distributions of the trust.


On Dec. 28, 2010, Citron also published an article calling attention to the gross
overvaluation of GNI, a trust structurally similar to WHX that pays a high dividend with a
finite lifespan. GNI is set to terminate in April 2015 and, like WHX, was trading at a gross
overvaluation to the value of remaining distributions. In 2014, Great Northern Iron has
fallen about 68 percent, putting it much closer to the fair value of its remaining
distributions.

WHX and GNI will terminate around the same time. GNI recently plummeted to a level
much closer to fair value, and we feel WHX will be next.


About the trust:


WHX is a statutory trust created in October 2007. Immediately before the closing of the
IPO, Whiting will acquire interests in certain oil- and natural gas-producing properties
located primarily in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Permian Basin and Gulf Coast
regions of the U.S. The net-profits interest will entitle the trust to receive 90 percent of the
net proceeds from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural-gas liquids
attributable to the underlying properties until the time when 9.11 MMBOE have been
produced from the underlying properties and sold. This amount is the equivalent of 8.20
MMBOE with respect to the trust's right to receive 90 percent of the net proceeds from
such reserves pursuant to the net-profits interest. WHX will pay a quarterly dividend
consisting of quarterly cash receipts of net proceeds minus fees and administrative costs.
This dividend will be paid until said 9.11 MMBOE has been produced, then will wind up its
affairs and terminate with zero remaining assets.

Worth zero when trust terminates:


With 100-percent certainty, WHX will head toward a zero! According to its own press
release dated Feb. 7, 2014, WHX estimates the trust will terminate on March 31, 2015. It
has no other assets and minimal cash. Therefore, WHX's value should be based solely on
the remaining cash distributions, which are estimated in the next paragraph.


Estimated value of the trust:


On Nov. 7, 2013, WHX announced 6.86 MMBOE (84 percent) of the trust's total 8.20
MMBOE had been produced and sold. On Feb. 7, 2014, WHX announced 7.12 (87
percent) of the trust's total 8.20 MMBOE had been produced and sold by the end the
fourth quarterly payment period of 2013. Unit holders of record as of Feb. 19, 2014 will
receive a distribution of $.55712 per unit. That will leave only 1.18 MMBOE still to be
produced, and WHX expects that production to be met by March 31, 2015. Shortly
thereafter, the trust would terminate. Using the most recent volumes, average sales prices
and net profits, for every .01 MMBOE produced, unit holders will receive $.021428 in
dividends. WHX expects a decline rate of approximately 12.6 percent from 2014 through
March 31, 2015, during which time cash distributions to unit holders may decline at a rate

faster than that of production because of fixed and semi-variable costs attributable to the
underlying properties. Therefore, it is likely unit holders will receive less than $.021428 in
dividends for every .01 MMBOE produced. However, to make it simple, we will use
$.021428 to calculate the value of WHX. If we ignore the TVM (time value of money) in
our calculation, unit holders will receive approximately $2.31 in cash distributions until the
trust terminates at zero. Therefore, WHX should be trading around $2.30 per share.


Conclusion:


We believe WHX is overvalued because naive investors are purchasing shares for the
high yield. What these investors don't understand is that WHX is a trust that will trend
toward zero until the trust terminates on or around March 31, 2015. Therefore, WHX's
value should be based solely on the remaining dividends. Consequently, we assign a sell
rating on the stock with a $2.30 price target.


Disclosure: I am short WHX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Nicely written article. I agree with you on all fronts, except for the title. What is the catalyst that will cause WHX to
'Lose Half Its Value In The Coming Days'? It has remained crazy overvalued for almost a year now. It has somehow
found an equilibrium, teetering on a valuation that makes no sense whatsoever.


Why will it fall 'in the coming days'? Why didn't it fall 1-6 months ago? Will it be in 3 months, 6 months, 12 months?
The only guarantee I can make (and that you make above), is that it WILL go to zero at termination, a little over a year
from now regardless of the price investors are willing to buy or hold it (because it will be de-listed then). That will be
an ugly surprise for anyone who waits that long at this price.


I personally hope you are right. But I have hoped for 9 months now, which is not much of an investment strategy. Can
you name the catalyst and the timing of the correction?

Author’s reply »  GNI which liquidates around the same time as WHX recently tanked around fair value and I
think GNI will be next as hedge funds look for the next GNI.

Blizz_The_Wiz
I think it may very well be your article, 3d Analytics, that causes the catalyst for the slide.


As much as SA isn't the most viewed platform on the web, many SA articles get posted on Google Finance,
Yahoo Finance, etc., and this may stem more mass-understanding of the basis for this investment (and how
short lived it is).


As soon as we hit March we are exactly 1 year from the termination date, which makes it much easier for
people to start to model using very simple present value analysis (based on quite predictable future cash flow
- as you have stated). Once Mr. Market catches onto this the flood of retail investors will follow. This may be
the catalyst....


Is this stock even available on loan for shorting? My broker couldn't find any... 
I bought some puts but as you would expect, voliatility premium is quite high.

Michael, like you I have tried to understand why WHX maintains its price when it will be worth $0. My
calculations for production will I believe end the trust before the stated maturity date. If indeed naive investors
are buying for yield, they are going to be sorely and financially disappointed. I will be surprised if the
production requirement is not met by the end of 2014, but feel certain it will end by the 1st qtr of 2015. The
dividends will almost certainly be drastically reduced. My conclusion is that short sellers and or option traders
are causing the price to remain. In the end, someone is going to get burned badly.

I agree with WHX being overvalued. I had been in and out of this trust, understanding what and when the final
outcome would be. I was surprised when the share price kept climbing. I believe that naive investors have been
pumping the price up based purely on the payout. I currently no longer hold any shares of WHX. I will be watching the
slide when it starts.

Rhianni32
Agree with Michael Cutler. WHX is overpriced and will fall someday but I don't see anything to make me think in the
coming days.

Does'nt anyone read the prospectus anymore? I still feel that a month after the trust terminates WHX will still be
trading.


18 Feb 2014, 11:15 AM


Mike Cutler, Contributor
Will you provide a link (or what to Google) to find this 'prospectus'? Everything out there published by Whiting
on WHX says clearly that it will expire. I don't want to discredit or defame you, but I can only assume you are
joking. The jokes on me if you can provide a link or what to search for to read this prospectus that keeps
WHX live past termination after all distributions have been paid out around March 2015 (or the distribution
after that).


18 Feb 2014, 02:20 PM


RIK K
My apology for my run on thought. I was making a sarcastic comment about the inability of some investors to
do the proper DD. And the comment about the stock still selling after termination I was thinking about how the
old GM kept trading for months after shutting down.


19 Feb 2014, 09:32 AM


Mike Cutler, Contributor
No worries. I had a feeling it was a joke/sarcasm, but hard to tell in writing.


It is really sad how many investors are devoid of basic investing 101 skills. Anyone thinking of investing
should read a few books, take a course, or do something to get educated first, and then do their homework on
each investment.


I've had a few of the 'uninformed' communicate with me via SA email about WHX (they didn't want to put their
comments to the public due to lack of understanding). In each case they were in no financial position to be
betting long WHX, and they had no idea what they were getting into.


19 Feb 2014, 11:29 AM


jphudgins
Even Whiting has stated the trust will be worth $0 upon conclusion. Since Whiting owns a huge share of
WHX, it appears the trust will end. To my way of thinking, this doesn't mean production will end, only the trust
will terminate and those holding shares will have $0.


26 Feb 2014, 01:05 AM


Trail Runs
I agree with the author completely about WHX valuation, but in response to the question of "why over the next few
days?" he probably could have added - "because we have a boat load of puts that expire Feb 22 and we got nervous
over the weekend about the price action on Friday"

Mike Cutler, Contributor
So you are paying short borrow costs of 70%/year or so (of the rounded up whole dollar price)... It needs to
fall in a few days or borrow costs start to eat up any downside gains. Today's $0.65 loss will be eaten up by
short borrow costs in less than 3 months. It needs to fall in a matter of days and remain there to make money.
I do hope it does!


I credit the author with sending it down 10% today - woke some people up apparently, or at least scared some
of those in the know to get out. If history repeats itself it will fall more until the next distribution gets close and
then go back up...

There is no doubt that WHX will go to zero and will see a massive sudden sell off like GNI at some point. But I've
concluded that the timing of "some point" and the price action in the meantime is an interesting poker game between
A) short sellers and put buyers, B) knowledgeable longs in it for the distributions and the the short borrow fees, and C)
the option market maker who made a lot of money last expiration and could make a lot this expiration as well (Feb
22). (and of course the last gentleman at the table, the unsophisticated long referred to in the article, player D)


The game is played with articles posted here and elsewhere just before expiration by player A), purchases by player
C), who also happens to be player B), especially as we approach options expiration date, and player D) sleeping
away at the table. The game has a payoff every option expiration date and will come to a screeching halt when player
D) wakes up, realizes he has been the dupe at the table, and storms away with what's left of his money. When that
happens player D) will identify himself by posting here in the comment section using words like "manipulation",
"greedy shorts", etc. Of course some of player D) (there are many) are just pretending to be asleep, hoping they can
take their cut and run from the table before the other D)'s wake up. No greed there of course, just fair game you see.


My guess is that player B)/C) wins this hand, we close Feb 22 around $5 to the consternation of player A) and the
relief of player D), (the one with one eye open).


All of this in my humble opinion, of course;)


18 Feb 2014, 12:56 PM


Trail Runs
Since the author is short the common he is a subset of A) (let's call him smart A), who should eventually win the game
when D storms away. But the parking meter outside owned by B) and C)? is very expensive.

I'm not actually picking on the author, he is right about the valuation, he's telling anyone who's willing to wake up and
read what the outcome will be, and now he's stating clearly his hand - common not puts.


In fact I could be A), but chose not to because the options (player C)) make this game more expensive and uncertain
than GNI.


Again, IMHO.

I have made a lot of money on WHX over the last two years but sold out just before the last dividend. The stock is
great if you buy about six weeks before the dividend kicks in and then get out 3 days before the dividend. I agree with
the author that this is not one to keep forever in your portfolio. Get in and get out at the right time and it can be
profitable. I think somewhere in the sub $3 area would be a good entry point and get out around $5 a few weeks later.
Just my opinion based on previous experience.


18 Feb 2014, 03:12 PM


skardem
"I agree with the author that this is not one to keep forever in your portfolio." 
Will you try it again next quarter?


18 Feb 2014, 03:37 PM


Aquadok
I plan on it for this quarter. I don't know about the next one though. As you get closer to the end of the trail for
this stock, I think people are going to get more educated about the short life and get too nervous to bid it up.
But I think it is good for at least one more try at profit taking. I got in the last quarter at just over $5 and got out
at a bit over $6 about 4 - 5 weeks later. I wish I had gotten in a little earlier - around $4.25 but nobody is
perfect. A 20% profit in a little over a month is still good for me.


Looking back over my first post I think I was too optimistic. I should still be able to get in around $3 but I will
probably plan on selling around $4. Still a good profit for a short turnaround. The real trick is to sell about 3
days before it goes ex dividend. Look at the charts and you can see it.

I agree that sibling WHZ is fairly valued. The expenses of production are about twice as high as when they
IPO'd. I think that level of expense is here to stay. The level of the original distributions will never be revisited.

With substantial distributions to pay, I'm surprised that being short is a good strategy. What am I missing? Short
covering can cause surprising delays and unexpected rallies in the expected fall of an overvalued stock. Go away
shorts.


Imagine that price hits $4 in the next month and there is the potential for another juicy distribution in May. Won't there
be another risen-from-the-dead zombie rally? What fun!

happened after the shares adjusted down. That was in November. WHX went down to 4.33 a share overall and within

says it will lose half its value. So far he has said the same thing the last 2 distributions that I know of. Playing the

I think the authors take on the stock is valid but only if you plan on keeping the stock until it goes to zero. For those of
us who trade the stock it is probably less of a factor. Personally, I am surprised that the stock has gone up in the last
few days but it has. Good for some traders - bad for others. I still think that it will have a major correction down to
about $4 or so in the next month to six weeks but who really knows. Lets see how it plays out over time and just get in

Well guys, here it is March 6 and WHX is one here near $2.xx per share, sold mine higher than the price pd approx
2yrs ago...with over 2000 shares made several thousands in dividends, plus sold it above the price I pd by over $1.20
a share ( another $2000.) profit. Fees of $7.95 for buying and $7.95 for selling the 2005 shares....No margins, no
other nonsensical fees.....No taxes since in my Roth! I am very happy with all my profits!

Dear All,


I always wrote that Whiting USA Trust (NYSE:WHX) is like a long option an insurance policy against rising oil and gas
prices!


Some may remember!


Feel free to read with all your attention this article, read it again and again and try to find the sense of it, it's important
to understand the future of oil and gas prices!


White House plays down role of natural gas policy in Ukraine crisis - Reuters dlvr.it/55PWmY


What if Russia militarily invades Urkaine?


Well, it already started doing so!


What if Russian air force starts to bomb Ukrainian's infrastructure because war escalates and what if some of 16
Ukrainian nuclear power plant reactors are hit "by accident" and start to emit lethal nuclear radiation?


Avoid to tell me that this is all fiction and will never happen, it's actually going in exactly this direction!


What will happen if the Western world would boycott Russian gas and oil?


I think that everybody is mature enough to imagine that oil and gas prices in this case would sky rocket!


What would then be the intrinsic value of Whiting USA Trust (NYSE:WHX)?

Think and grow rich!


Never, never write about taking into account all actually known and unknown risks and never believe that Russians
will make concessions, they won't!


Have fun and take care!


Best,
