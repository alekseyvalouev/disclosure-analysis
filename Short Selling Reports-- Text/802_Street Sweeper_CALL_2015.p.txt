MagicJack VocalTec: The Disappearing Business Trick
Nov. 25, 2015 10:50 AM ET10 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


CALL suffers from perilous declines in users, activations and app users.


Core consumer market is disrupted by free alternatives, unlimited talk phone plans.


CALL endures a disconnect between consensus, compared against declining
Google Trend searches and revenue trend.


Latest “enterprise initiative” features inexperienced businessman, limited overall
potential.


Terrible consumer reviews persist, focusing on poor customer service.


Any smidgen of magic left in magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is vanishing quicker
than street magician David Blaine can make a new quarter disappear.


Now the former star of annoying, late-night TV commercials only wishes it could make its
melting core business model reappear.


MagicJack offers a device that is plugged into the computer to allow consumers to make
local or international phone calls for about $40 per year. Its secondary offering is VoIP or
voice over Internet protocol for small or medium enterprises, an area dominated by the
AT&Ts and Verizons of the world.


Though magicJack enjoyed an early out advantage in 2007, the benefits have fallen apart
like a busted magic trick.


After an early, reasonably-upbeat article, PC Magazine revisited magicJack in 2011 and
rated it "fair," adding: "(NYSE:W)hen magicJack debuted, nothing else like it existed. That
isn't the case anymore. In the face of competition, magicJack's poor interface, pushy
attempts to up-sell you, on-screen advertisements for its own product, and general lack of
support make it hard to recommend now."


MagicJack faces numerous issues that make the stock impossible to recommend now,
including:


*Perilous declines in users, activations and app users

Consumers are not enamored with magicJack, as shown by numerous reviews, including
very recent ones:

*Perilous Declines: Users, Activations


Indeed, magicJack's fraying business model is generating a determined, unrelenting
downturn in active device users and activations. Our charts below uncloak the trend:

Active device users have plummeted 23% in two years, as shown above.

Meanwhile, as shown above, device activations bent in half and then some over two
years.


Let's look at why magicJack's core product is declining so drastically…


*Crowded Consumer Market Gets Disrupted By Free Alternatives, Unlimited Talk
Phone Plans
5/22/2018 MagicJack VocalTec: The Disappearing Business Trick - magicJack VocalTec Communications Ltd. (NASDAQ:CALL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3713526-magicjack-vocaltec-disappearing-business-trick 4/12


In the consumer market, magicJack competes with rivals such as Ooma (NYSE:OOMA)
(seven times magicJack's revenue) and Vonage (NYSE:VG) (lower cost, lower churn).


There's an elephant in the room - and it's one big beast: The consumer space is dead.
There is virtually no money to be made there.


Consumers don't want to plunk down a big wad of cash for phone service. They've got
free alternatives, such as:


*WhatsApp


*Facebook


*Viber


*Google Voice


*Skype


So why pay for VoIP when you can get free phone service?


As if that's not enough, monster companies such as AT&T and Verizon have changed their
phone plans. Rather than consumers buying so many minutes, they now get unlimited talk
and text. There's no need to pay magicJack or Ooma.


*Small Businesses, Big Targets, Tiny R&D


So now, all the companies like magicJack are talking up their enterprise initiatives.


But it's hard for magicJack to woo small and medium sized businesses because it just
doesn't have much of a research and development budget. Look how small it is, compared
to three rivals.

*HoteliJack: Limited Prospects


Indeed, in the recent earnings call, company leaders talk up their enterprise initiative
called "HoteliJack."


MagicJack partnered with a hotel-related group in an attempt to encourage low cost hotels
to switch phone systems to magicJack-type systems.


"Let me turn to the enterprise initiative we discussed on our last call," said CEO Gerald
Vento during the last earnings call. "In September, we signed a 10-year exclusive
agreement with Hoteligent and the Patel family."


But the online presence of HoteliJack is modest:

(Source: hotelijack.com)


And the site seems to focus on promoting the young entrepreneur who may be just cutting
his teeth and hoping for a halo effect from magicJack, according to an audio interview:


Host: "I want to know a defining moment of your career …"


Kunal Patel: "It's been a relatively new career… Thus far it's got to be this partnership with
magicJack. They have 2.7 million consumers on their side and they are a publicly traded
company. Just to get a deal done with magicJack that both is solvent for us, the hotels and
magicJack is an extraordinary time for us."


*More Declines: Key App Users Fall


Surprisingly, along with core deterioration, harsh reviews, declining active device users
and apparently limited prospects of HoteliJack (who wants to use a hotel room phone,
anyway?), the company is also experiencing problems with what should be a promising
category: Unique mobile app users.


And nobody wants to talk about it.


Referring to the unique app users number noted by an analyst during the second quarter
conference call, CFO Jose Gordo said, "I think going forward we'll probably continue to
disclose it, but we see it as less relevant."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3713526-magicjack-vocaltec-disappearing-business-trick 7/12


But magicJack apparently then decided to take the head-in-the-sand approach. In the third
quarter conference call, the CFO had this to say when an analyst asked about the app
user numbers:


"We made the point a while ago that the growth initiatives as far as the app goes, or even
enterprise or international, were not going to be material in 2015. We think it's too early to
disclose metrics."


Investors may take a look at the user numbers, shown below.


(Sources: SEC filings, earnings calls)


So the chart reveals why company leaders don't want to discuss unique app users.


*Declining Revenue Mirrors "Google Trend" Search Decline


Finally, the chart below shows the disconnect between Google Trend lines, year-over-year
quarterly revenue declines and analysts' unrealistic consensus (shown by the bars) for
magicJack revenue. For comparison, Ooma is shown in brown.

*Conclusion:


It would take the combined magic of David Blaine, Criss Angel and Harry Houdini to
breathe life back into this dead-end business. Absent that kind of magic, we think a
generous valuation for magicJack stock would be $5 per share.


Disclosure: I am/we are short CALL.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.

Just curious how you are deriving your $5.00 target. They have ~$4.50/share in net cash and this year are going to
generate about $23 million in FCF ($1.50/share).

I'd like to know how the price target was derived, as well.


How did you arrive at this "generous valuation"?

I use magic Jack apps when I am traveling abroad... calling any number in the US and friends around the world who
have MJ. It has been worth many times over the 20/year fee.

Been using MJ for both my US and Canadian home. Both phone numbers work with one or the other as a call forward
to the other. At $20 a year, I estimate that I saved over $2,000 (after tax money!) over the last 5 years even compared
to the leading VOIP service of Comwave http://www.comwave.net... never mind the great voice mail service which
can be picked up in any wi-fi environment. If MJ wanted to expand further in Canada, it would be a real slam dunk.

speng99
I am not willing to pay $40+ a year since there are so many free app to use but I am willing to pay double or even
triple for it if I know the major difference between MJ and other free app. Why MJ does not make this selling point
clear to the public? With MJ, you can call ANY number but with other free app, you can only call members within the
same group. Can MJ add this selling point to their packaging box and all Ads? Peoples need to be educated. Go, Go,
MJ!

For less than $3 a month magicjack phone service now gives you: 
-Home Phone Service with magicJack GO 
-Unlimited Mobile Talk/Text over WiFi on Your Smartphone and Tablet with magicApp 
-magicApp also works on Your existing 4G/3G data connection 
-Unlimited magicJack to magicJack calls worldwide 
-No monthly bills ($35/year) 
-Buy a magicJack GO and get your first year of service FREE 
OR 
For less than $2 a month magicApp mobile phone service gives you: 
-Unlimited Mobile Talk/Text over WiFi on Your Smartphone.Tablet or iPod Touch  
-magicApp also works on Your existing 4G/3G data connection 
-Unlimited magicJack to magicJack calls worldwide 
-No monthly bills ($15/year)


-magicApp connects with landlines and mobile numbers(not just people who have the same app)using a real U.S.
phone number


I think this is clearly the best value in phone service.However, there must be a focus on clearly communicating the full
value proposition to the public to make magicjack grow again.I hope to see magicjack get a product placed in the
mobile phone sections of retail stores.Also hope to see these selling points made clear on the front of the device
packaging as well as on their website, facebook and twitter pages and in some ads.I think the above selling points
should be made constantly in magicjack facebook posts in the hope that people will share them with others.Your
customers are your best sales people and ultra low cost service like magicjack is the kind of thing people will share
because they like to help friends and family save money.Who knows why the company won't do this????


As of now, the full value proposition is still not being shown to the public.For example,if one were to glance at the front
of the magicjack GO packaging in a retail store,they would have no idea that magicApp unlimited mobile talk/text is
included with the home phone service.


Another example would be that magicApp is not listed in the featured "communication" and "social" categories on
google play where all the competing calling and texting apps are listed.Many people searching for a calling/texting
app would look in these categories but would not see magicApp listed there.magicApp is still doing well being ranked
#477 top grossing android app even though it is hidden from the view of many people searching for a calling/texting
app.


-Some may find that $3/month($35/year) for magicjack home phone service and included magicApp with unlimited
mobile talk/text over WiFi on smartphones and tablets is all the phone service they need.


-You can use a combo of magicjack and tracfone to get home phone and mobile phone service for $11/month with no
monthly bills for either service.($35/year for magicjack and $100/year for tracfone)The two services perfectly
complement each other when you use a tracfone android phone with magicApp.If you use cable internet for home
internet service,this also complements both services as most of them include lots of WiFi hotspots that you can use to
make free calls/texts with magicApp and save up your tracfone cellular talk/text/data that carries over.


-Some mobile phone-only users will now just use magicApp for unlimited talk/text over WiFi on an unactivated
smartphone and only pay $15/year ($1.25/month) for phone service.Many people have WiFi at home,work and many

mobile WiFi hotspots and this will be all the phone service they need.This will also be a good plan for kids who have
tablets/ipod touch or for people who simply don't want to pay for more expensive cellular plans.


-magicApp is also a good way to simply add a second line to an existing cellular plan so you have 2 separate phone
numbers to use on your smartphone.


Why not just pay a $1/yearly or .25/quarterly dividend? 
The elephant in the room.I think this would get the stock price to at least $15(and keep it there or higher) and would
make most shareholders happy and be a good way to rally the troops.This would instill lost goodwill with
investors/customers.I think CALL investors have endured enough hardship and it is time to shake things up.


IMO,customers are your best salesmen(and free salesmen)and this could also inspire customer/investors to put more
effort into sharing the great value proposition magicjack offers with others.Money talks,and a dividend is guaranteed
cash.I have gotten a great response from the many people I recommended magicjack to.Would be a win/win situation.


I have heard the arguments against a dividend and they sound just like more excuses and kicking the can down the
road.Actually,the arguments I have heard against a dividend sound diversionary and dishonest at best.


And I find it difficult to buy into the false longs vs shorts paradigm,by that I mean the notion that the price action is a
battle between unhedged shorts and unhedged longs.(It reminds me of the false left/right paradigm that
politicians/actors use to fool voters from seeing both parties have the same interests,which is the interests of
themselves and their cronies, not the well being of the average person!lol.)I wonder if the majority of the short interest
are also long the stock or if its simply institutions just buying and selling to each other back and forth in order to
control the price and profit from daytrading and selling options.This seems more likely in the ping pong game named
CALL.


The anonymous short boogeymen cannot stop CALL from paying a dividend,only CALL management and board of
directors can.


Anyone can see they have the cash on hand and cash flow to easily do this,and outstanding shares have now been
lowered to 15.7 million.Anyone can see the stock never holds its gains and its highly suspicious trading history(like
today) and this is an obvious solution. If they paid a yearly $1 a share dividend (or.25 cents quarterly),a stock price of
$15 a share would yield 7.5% annually.A share price of $20 would yield a 5% return annually.Many more investors
would be interested as a result of the guaranteed cash.It makes too much sense to ignore it.


Happy Thanksgiving

"Now then, WHY would anyone pay monthly/yearly recurring charges to MagicJack?"


"It is probably because most people are not tech savvy and naive."


And there y'go!


" This is the business plan for MagicJack and it is a very flawed one indeed! "


Oh yeah?

I have no idea what you were talking about with all that tech mumbo jumbo , but I've had a mj for many years now and
have paid a total of between 20 bucks a year - that'd be about $1.70 a month , or one medium cup of coffee at Dunkin
Donuts for a month of free unlimited local and foreign phone service - and more recently 30 bucks a month , or an
increase to a whopping $2.50 a month , upping the ante to one large DD coffee a month .


It's not $35 because if you wait to renew they always offer you a 5 buck discount at the last minute -


And I'm a skeptical guy who doesn't sign up for their 5 year 100 buck special deal!


Believe it or not , there are still millions of people who are poor , technically unsopphisticated , lazy , etc. who love the
idea of unlimited phone service for 2 freakin' dollars a month!


That is , essentially , free and this is a small company so it isn't dependant on "cornering 30% of the phone market" or
whatever , I just shelled out my 30 bucks for another year of unlimited phone service and guess what? If they go out
of business I'm willing to take the prorated loss of my payment!


But that's because I'm a big spender , others may not be so blas-e' about losing part of their 30 bucks -


And you dont have to "plug the thing into your computer" - you now can plug it right into your modem or that other
thing (see how untech I am?) - oh yeah - your router , so even if your computer breaks or you dont have one , you can
use your mj . And you can take it with you wherever you go and use it on any internet signal .


I dont know what they're worth , but I pay 15 bucks a month to TW for minimal internet which adequataly powers my
laptop and mj , and 2.50 a month for my mj , for a grand total of 17.50 a month for computer and telephone for many
years now .


So how much have I saved? There was no such word as "app" when I bought my mj , and I dont like that word - how
many millions are there like me?


And if they raise their price to 3 or 4 bucks a month - an almost 50% icrease - how many L/T customers do you think
they'll lose? Likely almost none , it's like using silver -


With silver , even when it's price rises , they still use it because a $500 washing machine only uses a few cents worth
.


With mj , rising prices only translates into what size Dunkin Donuts coffee you can buy once a month to equal your
monthly phone bill - without "apps and Google and "SMS" and whatever .


Oh , and as Columbo would say , "just one more thing" -


I've experienced the poor chat service noted , but they stay withyou and eventually solve the problem , as as a point
of comparison , I had experienced muuuuch longer and more frequent service outages and customer service
problems with Verizon when I was paying 15 times as much for less service!
