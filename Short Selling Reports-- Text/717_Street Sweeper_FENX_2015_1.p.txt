Fenix Parts: This Automobile Parts Seller Could Be Headed To The
Junkyard

Summary


Fenix is running in the red and running out of cash.


Conceived as a roll-up, Fenix has acquired a dozen entities in four months. Such
rapid acquisitions distract management and gobble cash for buying, integrating &
running very different businesses.


The CEO is apparently inexperienced in the auto parts business and has installed
equally inexperienced former co-workers as directors. Those two directors recently
departed under rather odd circumstances.


Messy financials, inability to file timely financial reports, and a Nasdaq deficiency
notice all will likely serve to suppress or kill investor interest in the stock.


Fenix may sell stock soon, posing dilution of current shareholders’ stock. And, on
Nov. 10, insiders will be able to sell shares locked up since the IPO.


Fenix Parts (Nasdaq: OTC:FENX) resembles the Johnny Cash hit describing the Cadillac
put together "One Piece at a Time," from parts he and an auto-worker buddy gradually
steal from the assembly line and eventually cobble into a "Psycho-Billy" heap.


It took the determined workers about 24 years to create a weird Caddy at a cost estimated
to exceed the price of a showroom model. But Fenix took only four months to roll-up a
dozen companies into a money-losing jalopy arguably worth a fraction of its ~$190-million
market valuation.


Westchester, Illinois-based Fenix buys broken-down heaps from automobile auctions,
pulls them apart and then sells the parts and scrap metal. It operates more like a junkyard
at several locations, where the company buys junkers from individuals. Customers range
from body shops and car repair shops to "shade tree mechanics" and hobbyists.


Fenix has not responded to our request for comment, but investors may read various
viewpoints HERE. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the executive summary
highlighting Fenix investment risks:

1. Losing Money - Fenix is running in the red. It's almost out of cash.


2. Risky Rollup - The company IPO'd four months ago as a rollup and has already
acquired a dozen companies. These rapid acquisitions result in distracted management
and accelerated costs associated with buying, integrating and running very different
businesses.


3. Directors Flee; Management Overwhelmed - The chief executive apparently lacks
experience in the auto parts business and has installed equally inexperienced former co-
workers as directors. Those two directors recently departed under rather odd
circumstances.


4. Messy Financials - Fenix is also challenged by messy financials, apparent inability to
file financial reports on time and a Nasdaq deficiency notice. Any or all of which may well
suppress or kill investor interest in the stock.


5. Dilution Looming - Fenix will likely soon sell stock - ultimately diluting current
shareholders' stock. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission has already
approved the paperwork to sell more stock at any time.


6. Pending Insider Selling - Insiders will be able to sell locked up stock beginning Nov.
10.


*Risky Rollup - Running In The Red; Running Out Of Cash


A risky rollup, Fenix acquired its first 11 corporate entities for ~$93 million cash plus about
3 million shares of stock just days after the company's initial public offering in May 2015.


Fenix had to lower its hoped-for $10 offer price to $8 per share and increase the share
count to 12 million shares. Fenix was forced to borrow millions to pay the full $93 million
acquisitions expense plus a little left over for operating costs.


Fenix soon rapped its own fingers with a rusty wrench once again. It seems the acquired
companies began reporting unexpectedly lower revenues - dinged and dented by lower
scrap prices.


Fenix Parts' most current financials for the first quarter are shown below:

So Fenix finds itself operating ~$2.6 million in the red.


And in just the first quarter 2015, the company burned through $2.1 million.


Now, Fenix needs at least $2 million per quarter to pay employees and cover other routine
expenses.


But look at its cash position:


Yes, Fenix's cash has dwindled to ~$148,500.


Alarmingly, that pinch of cash was reported before the company made yet another
acquisition. Fenix inked a deal on Aug. 14 to buy Ocean County Auto Wreckers for $2.6
million cash plus ~half-a-million-dollars-worth of stock.


As if there's not already enough financial pressure on Fenix, the CEO said he plans to
close one to three acquisitions per quarter.


*Frequently Delayed Financial Report Raises Issues, Accelerates NASDAQ Risk


Cash-poor publicly traded companies are expected to file their financials on time just like
all the established companies. The second quarter financials were due Aug. 14.


Fenix didn't make it. So Nasdaq notified the company of its late report on Aug. 20. Four
business days later, Fenix notified investors about the Nasdaq deficiency notice, stating it
would file its financials on Sept. 2.


But in a filing dated Sept. 2, Fenix states:

"On September 2, 2015, the Company issued a press release reporting its second quarter
2015 pro forma consolidated revenues and providing an update on its second quarter
Form 10-Q filing, which is now expected within the next two business days."


What happened two days later, on Sept. 4? Nothing.


Fenix did hold a Sept. 3 "investor update" in which CEO Kent Robertson said, "…we are
close to completing our second-quarter 10-Q filing. This filing is complex …"


This filing issue is yet another chapter in Fenix's history of complex, incomplete financial
details that managers must repeatedly apologize for in conference calls.


However, the company did recently tell investors to expect a loss for the second quarter.
But how bad? Just what will be in that long-delayed report?


The clock is ticking. Investors are wondering.


*Directors Flee The Company


It's always unsettling to see managers leave a company.


Though Fenix has existed less than two years, two of six directors have already fled under
curious circumstances.


Directors Richard Kogler and Frank ten Brink were on the board's compensation
committee and audit committee. Mr. ten Brink was even considered the "audit committee
financial expert."


As the sole director at the time, CEO and founder Kent Robertson installed both men as
directors well before the initial public offering. The three had all worked for Stericycle - not
in the world of recycled auto parts - but instead, in the world of medical waste disposal.


Interestingly, almost the minute Fenix reached the point that it couldn't submit its financials
on time, the company announced both had resigned from the board.


Fenix issued an odd press release stating: "While Fenix eagerly anticipates the addition of
these executives (to the Fenix management team)… Because of an internal Stericycle
policy, Messrs. Kogler and ten Brink were required to resign from the Fenix Board,
effective immediately."


Other than the vague reference to the internal policy, the press release doesn't explain
exactly what caused Mr. Kogler and Mr. ten Brink to leave Fenix. Additionally, investors
are left wondering why Stericycle would suddenly raise conflict of interest concerns now

… nearly a year after the men were named Fenix directors.


Despite being groomed for management, they certainly aren't in the executive lineup,
here.


One theory is that all those rapid acquisitions have managers running in circles with their
hair on fire. There's no time to thoroughly manage things. No time to finish that pesky
second quarter filing.


*Out-Of-Whack Valuation: Competition Rips Fenix


Finally, Fenix stock looks to be a much, much worse value than competitors KAR, LKQ,
and CPRT. The numbers in bold below indicate the group's worst numbers… which
belong to Fenix.


Stock Revenue ttm Cash PEG Earnings/Share ttm


KAR $2 B $205 m 2.13 +$1.47


LKQ $7 B $142 m .86 +$1.30


CPRT $1 B $678 m 1.52 +$1.62


FENX $108m $149 K 5.88 $-39.19


(Source: Yahoo Finance (most numbers rounded); FENX revenue is FY 2014 pro forma
per SEC filings)


(Note: PEG ratio is price/earnings to growth ratio, indicating the trade-off between the
stock price, the earnings generated per share and the company's expected growth. A PEG
ratio of "1" is good.)


Compared with rivals, then, the chart clearly shows:


a. Fenix has 100 times less cash.


b. Fenix makes between ~10 and ~65 times less revenue.


c. Fenix is the only stock offering negative earnings per share.


d. Fenix is at least ~5 times overvalued, considering its expected growth.

*Conclusion


Amid the over-valuation, Nasdaq pressure, messy financials, fierce competition, odd
departures and overwhelmed management sitting atop a risky roll-up business plan, Fenix
is about to toss yet another roadblock in front of investors.


Cash-poor Fenix may now sell stock at any moment to buy more companies and just keep
the doors open. With $100 million worth of stock registered to be sold at any time, Fenix's
current shareholders could obviously face tremendous dilution.


And a second dose of dilution waits just around the corner. Insiders' shares locked up
since the IPO will be unlocked Nov. 10, potentially shooting more shares onto the market.


Ah, this cobbled together jalopy of a company would have been enough to make poor
Johnny Cash cry in his whiskey.


It's also enough to push Fenix into the junkyard and cut its valuation down to about $3.50
to $4 per share. And that is generous.

unless of course LKQ comes in and buys them out. In the same biz and LKQ is the big industry consolidator.

That's probably the management's exit strategy but its a bit difficult to imagine LKQ buying this when DD is
not possible due to the filing issues. They have no reason to rush.

Fidelity has shares to short, however it is a hard to borrow stock and will require an interest payment of 1% a year.
