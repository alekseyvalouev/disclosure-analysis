Universal Display gives lower guidance for
fourth quarter citing “obvious” competition.


Posted on November 8, 2013 by asensio.com


Friday, November 8, 2013.     Universal Display Corporation (“UDC,”


NASDAQ: OLED) reported revenues as expected that were strictly in


line with the OLED industry’s previously reported unit sales for the


third quarter for OLED displays for mobile devices. However, its


margins and red emitter sales continued their rapid declines, and it


actually reversed its income tax accounting from an expense of $6.5


million in the second quarter to an INCOME item of $1.1 million in


the third quarter.


Importantly, any informed observer can see that UDC actually


guided revenues down not up. UDC has reported revenues of $97.2


million for the year. It is filling in losses in higher margin emitter


sales with lower margin commodity chemical sales. This increased


its reported revenues. Sales of OLED displays for mobile devices are


growing. Even assuming unit sales for the fourth quarter for OLED


displays for mobile devices remain at current rates, UDC must


report at least $150 million in revenues. Yet UDC gave revenue


guidance of $142 to $144 million and no guidance for earnings per


share much less pricing and product mix guidance, simply and


repeatedly stating the it “really can’t comment,” or “we don’t know”


or “we really can’t talk.”


Most importantly, UDC confessed that “obviously there’s


competition.” UDC has spent decades claiming it “owns” the


business.
