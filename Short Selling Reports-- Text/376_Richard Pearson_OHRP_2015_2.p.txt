Summary

Lack of institutional ownership is a strong predictor of failure.


Share price is a poor predictor of ultimate success.


Five lessons from Ohr Pharma


- Today shares of Ohr Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:OHRP) fell by more than 65% intraday
following the announcement that its OHR-102 (Squalamine) eye drug failed to meet its
primary goal.


For those who lost money on Ohr, I take the view that it was a loss that was entirely
unnecessary.


There are a number of key reasons why any objective observer should have downright
expected these results.


Back in July, I wrote an article entitled "The Ugly Truth Behind Ohr Pharma". The
conclusion I reached was as follows:


Squalamine was purchased for a negligible cost from a bankrupt pharma because it
had already failed and was clearly worthless. Dozens of other buyers had the
opportunity to bid on squalamine and no one was willing to pay a material price. Ohr
acquired the cheapest compounds that it could and then appointed the cheapest
management that it could. There was never any real chance of these compounds
succeeding. Instead, Ohr has used misleading press releases and stealthy paid
"research reports" to boost its stock price and raise money via stock sales. Ohr
Pharma is little more than a fool's game for retail investors which has been
engineered by clever financiers.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3034116-five-lessons-from-ohr-pharma 2/16


That article along with the current result from Ohr demonstrate several key lessons that
can be applied to many other small cap biotechs.


Lesson #1: Companies who pay for stock promotion should be avoided. Period.


I have written repeatedly about companies who pay to have their stocks promoted and I
have always taken the view that these companies are great shorts.


Yet there is no shortage of investors who take the view that "I don't care if the company
paid for promotion, I believe in the prospects for the drug".


There are two points that such investors are missing. First, if the drug had such strong
prospects, management would not feel the need to jeopardize their company with risky
promotions. And we shouldn't forget that management are the ones with the best view on
the real prospects for their drugs.


Second, many investors fail to realize that their bullish views on the drug's prospects will
have often been shaped by the paid promotions. The whole point of these promotions is to
generate positive sentiment. As a result, investors should apply extra scrutiny to any
information when there is evidence of paid promotion. Because what you think you may
"know" about these companies may in fact ultimately stem from paid hype designed to
boost the stock.


When I wrote about Cytrx (NASDAQ:CYTR) and Galena (GALE) last year, I expressed my
concerns about their use of The Dream Team Group to run paid promotions on their
stocks. The biggest criticism I received was that I failed to understand the massive
potential for their drugs. Both stocks have fallen by 50-70% since that time as their stories
have come unraveled.


Lesson #2: Sell side research is woefully deficient and predictably biased


The details in my article were easy to find for anyone who chose to do some simple
digging. The only conclusion that any objective researcher could come to was that this
stock was grossly overvalued even at prices of $6.00.


Yet the 4 investment banks who covered the stock all had buy ratings on it with targets
ranging from $20 to $34.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3034116-five-lessons-from-ohr-pharma 3/16


Investors should make no mistake when looking at the relationship between small cap
biotech stocks and the investment banks who finance them. These banks have a dual
incentive to put out uber bullish stock targets and boost the share prices of their clients.


The first incentive is obvious. These banks want to increase liquidity and price to allow the
company to raise money. Putting out lofty share price targets helps to curry favor with
management so that when the time comes to appoint an investment bank they are more
likely to be selected.


The second incentive is less obvious. But it should be kept in mind that the other clients of
the investment banks are the investors who actually buy into these deals. After the
investment bank delivers the new stock to these institutions, the institutions want to make
money not lose it. The banks therefore are incentivized to support the price even after the
money is raised. They again have more than ample reason to ignore any inconvenient
truths about their corporate clients.


Yes, yes, yes. I know. Following the implosion of the internet bubble in 2000, Wall Street
investment banks fully separated research from investment banking. The compensation of
analysts is now typically determined by "the overall profitability of the firm". But clearly no
banks generate revenues from their research. Research is fully a cost center. Even sales
and trading revenues have dwindled dramatically, especially in comparison to investment
banking revenues. Any analyst with a shred of common sense knows exactly where his
bonus is coming from at the end of the year. The connection between research and
investment banking used to be explicit. Now it has simply become "wink wink nod nod".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3034116-five-lessons-from-ohr-pharma 4/16


The lesson to be learned is that sell side research targets have consistently proven to be
nonsense. Anyone who loses money because they put faith in a sell side target has no
one to blame but themselves.


Lesson #3: With technology, you get what you pay for


In my previous article, I made the point that Ohr had paid just $100,000 for Squalamine
and that it had been purchased from a bankrupt seller who had already had the compound
in clinical trials but had chosen to discontinue it.


With this knowledge in hand, it is shocking that anyone would have placed anything more
than tangential faith in the prospects for the drug.


Yet we see this pattern over and over again. A micro cap reverse merger acquires some
token technology for next to nothing. The company then churns out press releases
(usually hyping the size of the overall market). Investment banks are incentivized with fee
revenues. The stock soars (for a time).


More so than any other factor, the existence of low priced and dated technology is
typically the best predictor of ultimate failure for these microcaps.


I have written about similar situations and have been consistently proven correct. When I
wrote about Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), I noted that it had acquired dated technology
for a six figure sum which quickly translated into a 10 figure market cap following a string
of press releases and hyper promotional articles on the stock. In the time since my last
article, the stock has fallen from over $13 to the $3's, a decline of more than 70%. Not
surprisingly, the company has yet to generate meaningful revenue from its technology.


Unipixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) was another similar case. As I noted in my article, press
releases and hype from retail investors sent the stock soaring despite the fact that its
underlying technology was dated and marginal. The stock has now cratered to just over
cash value per share.


In all of these cases, the hype always focuses on the massive potential of the multi billion
dollar market, while ignoring the fact that the company's technology is likely worthless.


Lesson #4: Lack of institutional ownership is a strong predictor of failure


Sell side analysts were busy telling the world that Ohr was a 3-5 bagger over the next 12
months. And yet the company had a paltry institutional ownership of just 24%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3034116-five-lessons-from-ohr-pharma 5/16


Institutions are far more motivated and capable than individual investors when it comes to
evaluating opportunities and making money on stocks. They have full time employees with
deeper expertise and they have the deep pockets to pay for real research to be done.


Yet we see time and time again that retail investors think that they have outsmarted Wall
Street and found an undiscovered bargain in some micro cap stock. While the institutions
sit on the sidelines, retail bids up the stock by hundreds of percent.


When we see a massive run up in a stock coupled with a striking lack of institutional
participation, it should at the very least serve as a clue that something is missing. This is
often the first clue that a stock will end up being a far better short than a long.


Lesson #5: Share price is a poor predictor of ultimate success


Many readers are very unforgiving of short sellers. When the share price goes up
following a negative exposé, these readers are quick to point fingers and suggest that the
conclusions must have been false.


With each of the stocks mentioned above, we have seen significant spikes in their share
prices before they cratered due to their ultimate failure. Ohr has been no exception to this
pattern.


When I wrote about Ohr, the stock price was sitting at around $9. It eventually fell back to
around $6.


In the few weeks before the failure of Squalamine, the stock spiked from $7 to nearly $12
based on enthusiasm for its near term prospects. With the stock now sitting at $3, we can
see clearly that stock price is a very weak predictor of ultimate outcomes. This is
especially true when looking at retail heavy microcaps.

Same old same old negative publicity. Short, short, & more shorting. Nothing more.

EminenceGrise
The difference is who is right in the long term. The vast majority of the companies Pearson criticizes turn out
to be failures eventually. The vast majority of companies who pay for promotion turn out to be failures
eventually. This is all patently obvious if you look back at his track record. However, if you prefer to ignore it
and continue to invest in companies that self-promote, the rest of us will be happy to pad our gains with your
losses.

I understand. At times the bear raider guys are right, & I don't know anything of this OHR co., but I do know of
UNXL, NEON, PLUG, etc. that are continually getting on bash AGENDAS. Reminds me of the YONG stock
hitting. Now Lumber Liquidators was the recent toy by many. Whose next?


Sorry, I was a bit hard that night, & not in a good mood after watching what the shorts have done to many
other hard-working companies with the American spirit that have developed great new products while the
world crucifies them. I am so tired of the shorts/"research companies" bashing a stock or other legit
companies using the media tools for gains(losses if short). Likewise for the Pump & Dump jobs. No stock
goes without orchestrated game playing in this market & it's getting out of control more each day. Think I'll
invest in real estate from now on.

Great article. Hopefully one or two longs will read this and accept the conclusions. Hopefully they will wise up and not
be conned again in the future.


If one just avoids ALL reverse mergers, and ALL stock promotion the chances of being scammed go down
considerably.


Another lesson from OHRP should be that history matters. OHRP is essentially the son of a famous 80/90s scam
called Advanced Viral Research (ADVR) combined with the crap assets of another junker, Magainin Pharma.


FYI - Another rotten fruit that has fallen from the ADVR tree is LBIO....

I have been following your articles for some time. You impress me as someone who has a dark side. Your disclosure
is consistent with a pump and dump operation. Let me ask you this? Have you ever taken a postion in a stock before
you wrote your article and then sold it within 72 hours? If this is the case, which stocks were they?


Just how do you make a living? Is it just from shorting stocks? This would be an important disclosure?


Finally, I understand that you worked with Adam Feurstein at the Street and you seem to be very close. You also
seem to be close with Buyers Strike who I have to say is one of the ugliest and meanest participants on social media,
always on the short side. Are the relationships with Feuerstein and Buyers Strike what you are referring to in your
disclosure?

Richard, always appreciative of your work. Unipixel (UNXL) has new management and appears to be ready to
commercialize their technology with the help of Kodak (ok). Are you still bearish on that company, or have you given it
a look lately?


27 Mar 2015, 02:41 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
platonicbomb: UniPixel's management is not "new" and the company is as far from commercialization as it
was in early 2013, based on the recent yield charts disclosed by management and the testimony of a former
employee. Kodak is not helping at all - Kodak's management is absolutely ignorant about the touchsensor
market, and Kodak has made no progress in manufacturing the damned things since August 2013, when
commercial production was supposed to start in Rochester, NY.


27 Mar 2015, 03:15 PM


goodybob
Untrue twists as "Mr. Roe" is famous for. His other bash party de jour = NEON.


When was this former KODK employee questioned? 2012 or 2013? See UNXL today...get out of the past to
use old info to short today still. KODK knows what they are doing in UNXL & it will be great.


Never stop do you?


27 Mar 2015, 10:33 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
goodybob: The former UniPixel employee testified as to UniPixel's status as of early 2013. The current
UniPixel status can be seen in the contradictory yield charts presented at the Analyst Day and the Needham
conference (and the yield chart in the March 2015 presentation is fake). Kodak knows absolutely nothing
about the touchscreen market - Kodak's CEO thinks that 1) the touch sensor market is $30 billion (it is less
than $5 billion, and the addressable market is probably $50 million, at best), 2) indium is a rare metal (it is no
more rare than silver or cobalt), and 3) touch sensors are expensive because of indium (incell/oncell touch

sensors are actually now essentially free, and the cost of indium content in an ITO touch sensor amounts to
less than a cent). As of today, Kodak and its partners Kingsbury and UniPixel have been unable to
manufacture even one commercially viable sensor, as proven by zero product sales, despite trying hard since
2012.

Thanks Richard for your restraint in this article. You could have gloated, but didn't. You may have helped many people
save 1000s of their hard earned cash in the future. That's good karma.


Another wisdom is position sizing. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 
anyways, thanks for tipping me off to ohr those many months ago. It's proved a nice hedge against biotechnology
downside risk, actually being profitable just like my longs.


Here's a question for you: what do you think about nwbo? 3% of my trading portfolio is in their call options, though I
must spend 50% of my research time on the field. The story is just too good. What do you think?

bidness people aren't patients with macular degeneration and aren't eye surgeons. 
Guess what--as an eye surgeon, I can tell you that if squalamine ever gets to market whatever way, it will be used by
EVERY ophthalmologist and EVERY patient with macular degeneration--lines of improved vision vs control group is a
terrific outcome even tho the phase II trial didn't set this as a separate goal. 
Big deal. 
feel free to bail while I pile on more--the potential patient population is in the tens of millions for an EYEDROP--not a
complex delivery system at all ....and some very accomplished researchers and clinicians are literally on board for this
drug

Great article.


Some questions:


1. There are many companies in the market paying for stock promotion. How do you know the ones are considered to
be normal and others to be abnormal?


2. Ohr has institutional ownership of 24%. At what level you think it is considered to be a healthy institutional
ownership level for a potential buy?

Richard --


This looks like excellent advice. I appreciate the quality of the analysis as well as the obvious effort you make to
explain signs to look for.


From what I can tell, you take a lot of comment flack, mainly from folks who have biases that cause them to err in
weighting and evaluating available information. My bet is that as time goes on that will dwindle and more folks will
come to genuinely appreciate the techniques for evaluation that you have shared.


I have no tolerance for the paid promotion. I can't believe the SEC does. It just reeks of preying on the incapable and
ignorant. I think a rule requiring immediate reporting in an 8-K of any contract, arrangement, fee, etc. in relation to
stock promotion, publicity, names of persons acting for or on behalf of the company or the promotion company, etc.,
as well as 10-K and 10-Q reporting of that same information might help reduce the population of these benthic
organisms.


I know there are several articles that identify certain persons/identities involved in paid promotion. I am, however, not
sure I have ever seen anything comprehensive or consolidated. How do you recommend identifying paid promotion,
aside from when they can be found in disclosures? I am fairly certain that there is a substantial amount of this
occurring that is not disclosed based on seeing articles without disclosures from people who were later identified as at
least potentially being paid.


Does anyone maintain a "Wall of Slime?"


27 Mar 2015, 03:25 PM

It is good to see people who cannot read a scientific study giving bad advice on successful clinical trials. It does give
us medical people a leg up. I think that the author of this article does as much damage to shareholders as the pump
and dump outfits that he complains about.


Listen up people, as another ophthalmologist in the crowd, I can tell you that the AMD sub-group that squalamine
lactate eyedrops are very successful in, predominantly classical CNV, is the usual subgroup that is most successful
for any type of therapy for AMD. You have to do an extra test, a fluorescein angiogram (FA), to tell if it is there. It will
be in about 25 to 40% of patients presenting with wet AMD. So after wet amd presents, a patient will get an OCT, then
an anti-VEGF injection and be scheduled for an FA. Since it is an eyedrop,as the new SOC, it will probably be started
on all CNV patients and then stopped based on the FA results.


I am going long, based on these results. I think that the phase 3 trials are going to start soon and only last 9 months.
People, 3 lines of vision or better when compared to Lucentis is a wonderful result. Wouldn't you like this for yourself if
you had wet AMD?

Your research on OHRP since last year is to be commended, Mr. Pearson. Many here might be upset with your
emphasis on the negative--because they are in the stock. But these results are not to be denied. And the history of
the insiders of OHRP should not be ignored.


Your article on OHRP from last year noting Dr. Shalom Hirschman and Advanced Viral Research (ADVR) and how
OHRP "built" a portfolio of drugs candidates from other failed biotechs makes for compelling reading--

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3034116-five-lessons-from-ohr-pharma 13/16


There are many in the investment world that the pursuit of wealth has no limits--the ends justifies the means. As you
noted, Dr. Hirschman of ADVR "fame" ran the company into the ground and then had the audacity (some would call it
"shrewd") to buy the rights to a promising drug that ADVR from Hirschman's toxic financier of choice--the infamous
Cornell Capital--and take the drug to his son's (Oren Hirschman) company--OHRP.


The drug, Reticulose, never completed a properly designed clinical trial, but the well documented anecdotal evidence
of its effectiveness attracted investors and speculators and provided the liquidity necessary for an under capitalized
company to raise capital through dilutive financings.


Your research delineating other similar situations that ORHP was involved in further suggests that this "business
model" of hype and raising money for management's paychecks and bonuses continues to this day.

Discl: do not own Ohr stock. 
Funny how writers who have no scientific background or understanding go at lengths and put in time and effort to
write an article wanting to show their scientific and data analysis skills but all that comes out of it is a FOOL. You
cannot learn science just by reading press releases. I don't know how much you know about drug development but
Phase 2 trials are are for learning about the efficacy of the drug and using the stats to power the Phase 3 studies.
Phase 2 studies are "exploratory" studies. Do you think changing the management would change the science behind
the drug???Lesson for you after writing this article is to take a few courses in school. Here is what I recommend-
human anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, reading, writing and data analysis. You are welcome!!!

No, that's his point -- you could put Warren Buffett in to manage the drug and it would sill be an unviable drug
that is worthless.


28 Mar 2015, 11:42 PM

Nowhere in this article does the author give importance to the FDA and their response in the EOPII
meetings? Phase 3 trials will be designed based on guidance provided by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) at a recent "end of Phase II" meeting. The FDA has agreed with Ohr on a 9 month
primary efficacy endpoint based on the proportion of patients achieving a ≥3 line gain in visual
acuity.http://bit.ly/1BIH8oD  
There were 42% responders in 3 line gainers (28% in placebo+Lucentis). Fauxvista had similar results.
Restasis for dry eye was approved with a difference of 7% between drug and placebo (15% vs 7%). It was a
data mining exercise that resulted in the approval (look at the SBA for Restasis approval). The data obtained
from this study does not make Ohr-102 a failed drug, it just gives Ohr another opportunity to prove seeking
alpha writers and Adam Feurstein and his friends WRONG! 
Good day!

I appreciate the accurate exposition of the squalamine story, which indeed saved me some money, but I don't quite
understand the swipe at CYTR. Yes, the stock experienced a pump-and-dump ride in price action, due to promotion,
but how has their "story unraveled"? As far as I can tell aldoxorubicin is still a promising candidate. If you think
otherwise, please tell us why. The price of the stock has returned to earth, but the pipeline still looks OK from here.

Another interesting article but there's a huge thing you continue to fail to make clear - you took a short position in
CYTR - before -you wrote the article about CYTR. Above you state you do not currently have positions in CYTR, so
you must have covered your short position. I was curious what you think about the CytRx's drug aldoxorubicin? The
drug has 8 clinical trials listed on clinical trial dot gov web site. Two of the clinical trials are listed with drugs made by
Bristol Myers Squibb and also Eli Lilly, so it appears the drug aldoxorubicin is currently evaluating combination
therapies with existing drugs on the market. 
I ran across an interesting statement you made about the aldoxorubicin drug itself, and will share it here - in quotes,
you wrote: ""CytRx's approach to oncology is noteworthy to CytRx bulls because it potentially could entail lower risk.
Not only is CytRx's aldoxorubicin essentially just an improved delivery mechanism for an existing chemotherapy drug,
but this delivery mechanism itself has been proven by Abraxane, which also combined an existing chemotherapy drug
with an albumin binding molecule. The drug is currently in a phase III trial for second line treatment of soft tissue
sarcoma and a phase IIB trial as a second line treatment for glioblastoma multiforme."  
So I am curious what your opinion on the drug itself is, because as you mentioned above aldoxorubicin "is essentially
just an improved delivery mechanism itself that has been proven by Abraxane. Abraxis Bioscience developed
Abraxane and was later bought by Celgene for $2.9 billion dollars. The science works, so if CytRx is using the
albumin binding strategy it could possibly work as well. The FDA might seem to think so because aldoxorubicin is
currently in 8 clinical trials and has received extended dosing in one of the trials since January 2014. The extended
dosing is critical because the FDA has also given aldoxorubicin Special Protocol Assessment - and we know this
allows the FDA to approve the drug based on only one phase III clinical trial. The longer the dosing extension exists
with aldoxorubicin, one could argue, the greater the statistical benefit to cancer patients. This is pretty interesting stuff.
Aldoxorubicin has also received, not one, but multiple Orphan Drug Status designations for the other aldoxorubicin
treatment modalities. The FDA Orphan Drug status allows aldoxorubicin 7 years exclusivity for each designation.

Now, this becomes important because doxorubicin no longer has protection, and according to the clinical trial
extension (FDA) - aldoxorubicin is being dosed at much higher levels with much less cardiovascular toxicity than the
lead chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin). When we start to understand that doxorubicin was listed on the FDA drug
shortage list, we can see the demand for that specific drug is extremely high, and the possibility that demand for the
prodrug in CytRx clinical trials - aldoxorubicin "might" be much higher because it is "safer" to cardiac tissue.
(doxorubicin is known as red death because of the effects it has on vascular tissue). The major pharmaceutical
companies involved in this business add interest to the drug long term. Johnson and Johnson owns Janssen. The
connections become increasingly important. CytRx owns worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin - the drug which you wrote
is an "improvement" to doxorubicin, and based on the FDA actions - Special Protocol Assessment, Mutliple Orphan
Drug status, FDA extends dosing (which continues since January 2014) - the drug itself becomes of interest to
science and medicine. 
Unfortunately financial forces get involved in science and medicine. For example, you took a short position in CytRx
while writing articles for the "Dream Team" group during your investigation - but your own writings were edited
because they were too "hyped". 
There is always more than one side to the truth, but you had a short position and financial motive to "twist" that truth
in your favor for financial gain, and you have a pattern of leaving out pertinent information. But you were clear about
your short position. 
Money is money and it's fun to have it and to make it trading stocks. The way the system is set up allows both truth
and lie to exist and to make money from it. 
According to recent SEC filings under CytRx there has been some interested buyers in CytRx stock and recently
CytRx has hired a person to help them with commercializing their lead drug aldoxorubicin. CytRx currently has 42%
Institutional Ownership but these numbers might be higher because of the recent buying by 2 different medical
doctors. 
Lastly, was it ever discovered truthfully that the rise in CytRx stock was attributed to Phase IIB results or was that
attributed to stock promotion?

Richard, I generally agree with your 5 points,(especially the point about sell side research) ( & I admittedly have
learned my lesson the hard way over the years ) which every investor should follow every time they consider making
a purchase. The one facet you omitted is to consider the DIRECT ownership of company insiders and, more
importantly, the history of their purchase and sales, price paid, and % ownership as a total of outstanding float. There
are instances institutions simply do not get involved in micro-cap biotechs (besides minimum price thresholds) is
because they can not purchase enough shares simply because float is just not available, and is closely held by
insiders. 
Just my humble opinion. Thank you for publishing this article as a reminder of general guidelines every investor
should be aware of.

"Insert Company Name" unerwritten by MAXIM group and know that you are being sold a product they financed and
will dump as soon as the numbers match their profit targets. Their analysts will publish articles including the names of
the companies they financed.


It is disgusting.


I find ROTH, MAXIM, & NEEDHAM to be three of the greatest offenders of this "should be illegal" practice. They
throw $11 and $9 price targets on biotechs without the capital to fund research, who are about to dilute shares
through secondary offerings - often within days of that offering - and they are the underwriters! Look at some of their
pigs, available at their website. On March 6th, Roth reiterated an $8 PT with a very bullish note about $GALE, while
Needham & Co called for a more than doubling with a PT of $4. SIX (6) days later, they both participated in a $24
Million secondary offering at $1.56.


There should be no "Research Arm" of an underwriter - or - All underwriters should be strictly excluded from
commenting in any way about issues they are underwriting. It really only matters in this micro-cap world, as the rules
are different, but they shouldn't be.
