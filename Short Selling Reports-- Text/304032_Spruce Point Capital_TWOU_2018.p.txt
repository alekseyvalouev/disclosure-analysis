Executive Summary

Spruce Point Is Short 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU), 
Sees 30% To 50% Downside Risk ($47-$65/sh)


Significant Number of Programs Are Underperforming:  The Street is neglecting to understand the range of outcomes for both existing and future 
graduate programs.  We have assembled a proprietary historical revenue model that estimates revenues for each individual graduate program using a 
combination of FOIA requests, conversations with industry participants, company filings, transcripts, publicly available enrollment data, and tuition costs (Our 
methodology can be found here).  This proprietary model reveals a wide range of outcomes between programs that are successful and those that we would 
classify as failures.  Most importantly, we have found that eight of the 14 programs launched between 2013 and 2015 are underperforming 2U’s steady state 
program expectations. Further, based on our findings, we believe that four of the top seven programs have peaked and/or seen enrollment declines.  Our 
FOIA request for new student enrollments for MBA@UNC reveals that the 2U enabled MBA@UNC is now in decline as the last four starts have all seen YoY 
declines.  We believe the Street is dangerously extrapolating 2U’s guided steady state program performance to model 2U’s new and future programs. 


The Fallacy of 2U’s Steady State Program Revenues Assumes Stable Take-Rates (i.e. Revenue Share %) And Online Course Tuition Costs
• Steady State Revenues For Future Programs Will Be Lower Than Predecessor Programs Due To Lower Tuition Take-Rates:  Competitive pressures along 


with greater university acceptance of distance learning is already leading to lower tuition take-rates from service providers.  We obtained a recent contract 
from a competitor where the tuition take-rate is disclosed at 40%. This is significantly lower than the “Low to Mid 60%” take-rates that 2U currently 
claims it continues to achieve.  This contract is evidence of the margin pressures and disruption occurring in the Online Program Manager (OPM) 
competitive landscape.  We have talked with many industry participants, and we layout the competitive value proposition being delivered by Noodle 
Partners (founded by 2U’s former Chairman and CEO, John Katzman).  We find that Noodle, along with other disruptive competitors, can deliver a 
comparable model at half the cost to the university.  Further, the stigma attached to online (aka distance learning) graduate programs has decreased 
significantly over the past decade.  The legacy OPM model was more attractive a decade ago when universities were unsure if distance learning would gain 
acceptance at the graduate level.  OPM’s historically offered a compelling value proposition, which included providing the upfront capital (up to $10m), to 
set-up the program in return for +65% of student tuition over the course of a 10 - 15 yr contract.  Today, the stigma associated with distance learning 
(especially at the graduate level) has dissipated.  Therefore, universities are coming to the appropriate conclusion that they can invest their own upfront 
capital without 2U to retain more of their own tuition economics.  Investors are neglecting how this industry is both maturing and changing.  


• Steady State Revenues For Future Programs Will Be Lower Than Their Predecessors As New Programs Have Lower Tuition Rates:  Steady state 
performance for mature programs need to be reduced from the $16m of revenues that 2U guides investors to.  Some of the verticals are becoming 
commoditized.  For instance, our work reveals that the three most recent MBA program launches (Simmons Enterprise ‘16, University of Dayton ‘17, 
University of Denver ’18) charge tuition that is on average 40% less than the first three MBA program launches (UNC ‘11, Syracuse ‘15, American ‘15). The 
Internet has disrupted many industries and driven price deflation across numerous categories; online MBA tuition rates are no exception.  For instance, 
there are now reputable MBA programs (e.g. University of Illinois iMBA) that now cost ~$22,000.   It is going to be increasingly difficult for prospective 
online MBA students to pay $80K to $120K (i.e. American, Syracuse, and UNC) when a comparable curriculum can be offered at ~20% of the cost.  


2U, Inc. is a money-losing education technology provider that partners with universities to market and manage online graduate 


degree and short course programs. Its one size fits all model is being disrupted by fee-for-service players with lower take-rates. Our 


Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) documents offer compelling evidence that 2U’s long term guidance will disappoint investors.

Wall Street’s Hockey Stick Projections For 2U 
Will Severely Disappoint Investors


2U’s Most Successful Programs Will Be Very Difficult To Replicate:  We provide an illustrative case study for Simmons College, 2U’s 2nd largest 
customer (17% of FY17 Revenues, ~$49m).  Currently, Simmons’ College Masters in Nursing and Masters in Social Work represent the #2 and #3 
ranked programs for all of 2U in new student enrollment.  We obtained Simmons College annual financials. Its income statement provides detail on its 
online programs.  Additionally, on 2U’s last earning call, it disclosed Simmons’ EBITDA (i.e. surplus) from its 2U enabled programs for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 2017.  Taken all together, we believe that 2U’s EBITDA attributable to Simmons was 70% higher than the cash flow to the university.  
This contradicts what 2U tells investors and administrators – that a program partnership will net more cash flow to the university then 2U.  Simmons 
was the 2nd program in each of these verticals following the success of Georgetown’s Nursing and USC Social Work programs.  2U likely knew that 
they had spillover demand from the original two programs in these verticals.  Simmons took the bait with an initial take-rate of ~70%.  Based on the 
aforementioned information, we believe that 2U’s success (notably its take-rate) with Simmons should not be extrapolated to future programs.


Margin Pressure Will Also Reveal Itself In Higher Marketing And Student Acquisition Costs:  As part of 2U’s value proposition to universities, it 
offers marketing programs to attract students. In 2017, 52% of revenues were spent on marketing and sales. 2U specifically warns as a risk factor that 
it makes substantial use of search engine optimization and paid search for its efforts. Not surprisingly, given the rapid proliferation of online 
educational programs, the competition for keyword and digital marketing programs has increased. We conducted a keyword analysis using SEM Rush
and find that CPC (Costs per Clicks) in 2U’s three main verticals have risen 12% to 27% year over year.  We also find evidence that in 2017, 2U 
experienced the first signs of deleveraging in its direct marking costs. We expect this trend to intensify going forward.


2U And Analyst Comparisons To SaaS Companies Are Unjustified: There is nothing sticky or recurring about 2U’s business model at all. As SaaS 
companies become larger, margins expand and ARR (annual recurring revenues) increase.  Investors need to be aware that 2Us margins will compress 
in the future. Additionally, 2U needs to refresh its student enrollments annually as ~50% of its currently enrolled students graduate and no longer 
contribute to financial performance.


2U Is Becoming Less Transparent With Its Disclosures As Management Turnover In The C-Suite Accelerates:  In our view, 2U is deliberately 
becoming less transparent because a continuation of some of its historical disclosure practices about cohort performance would lead investors to our 
conclusions.  Most importantly, 2U’s past disclosure would have alerted investors to the existence of at least eight underperforming programs. 
Investors should be concerned that, not only did one of 2U’s original founders (John Katzman who started a competitor, Noodle Partners) leave prior 
to the IPO, but four C-suite executives have left executive posts since 2015: Susan Cates (Former COO, last 17 months), James H. Shelton (former Chief 
Impact Officer), Jeff C. Rinehart (former Chief Marketing Officer), and Robert L. Cohen (Former COO).   Perhaps, these departures are what led to the 
hire of a Chief People Officer. On May 21, 2018, 2U announced a new COO, Mark Chernis.  Mark was one of the founding Board members of 2U, and 
also previously worked for Pearson, one of 2U’s main OPM competitors.  In our opinion, his inclusion in the Board and subsequent hire may represent 
a conflict of interest on multiple accounts. Furthermore, in our experience, when a Board member needs to step into an operations role, it is usually a 
bad signal that problems are present.

Spruce Point Sees 30% To 50% Downside Risk 
($47-$65/sh):


GetSmarter Acquisition Likely A Diversion For Slowing U.S. Growth: At Spruce Point, we’ve successfully shorted numerous companies where we 
spotted early underlying business challenges being deflected by acquisitions.  In the case of 2U, we find that it made its first acquisition of GetSmarter
in May 2017, allowing it also to diversify internationally. We believe this validates our view that domestic growth is slowing. GetSmarter also exposes 
2U to short courses, which is a lower quality business, with shorter duration revenue visibility, and fewer barriers to entry.


Recent Equity Raise of +$330m Raises Questions:   Alongside the COO appointment, 2U did a secondary stock issuance and raised $330m at 
$90/share (a 5.8% discount to the closing price of $95.53). The language in its capital raise differs from its capital raise just eight months prior 
(September 2017).  The use of proceeds has now been expanded to include acquisitions, despite it having recently acquired GetSmarter, and not 
proven its ability to make good on its deal promises. Previous to this recent capital raise, 2U had $182m of cash on its balance sheet and has been 
talking to investors about its ability to become cash flow positive. Spruce Point believes 2U’s most likely motivation for issuing stock was to grab the 
money while investors aren’t attuned to its growing program failures and rising competitive threats. Otherwise, it is likely 2U is signaling a deferral of 
its time line to reach positive free cash flow.


Current Consensus Revenue Estimates Assume “More Than” Perfection:   We created a consensus revenue model to better understand what are 
the implicit assumptions in consensus revenue estimates over the next four years (i.e. till 2021).  Current revenue estimates reflect perfect execution 
of 84 programs between 2016 and 2021.  Perhaps, more importantly, these estimates also rely on 2U’s guidance for steady state program revenues, 
which we illustrate rest upon faulty assumptions.   


Valuation Currently Implies Well In Excess of 276 Future Programs At 2U’s Current Steady State Program Expectations:  We have assembled a 
sum-of-parts analysis where we separately value the mature cohort vintages (inception to 2015), new cohorts (2016 – 2017), 2U’s recent Short Course 
segment acquisition (GetSmarter), and its federal NOL.  This remaining value embedded in 2U’s current valuation implies that the Street is currently 
valuing all future programs (2018 and Beyond) at +$3 billion.  Our math conservatively estimates that this implies well in excess of 276 future 
programs – a wildly unrealistic outcome. 


A Terrible Risk/Reward Owning 2U With Analysts Seeing Just 6% Upside, We See 30% - 50% Downside Risk:  Insiders have made out like 
bandits, selling $148m of stock, despite 2U burning $225m of negative free cash flow since 2011. Approximately 25% of sales have been the CEO, who 
just adopted a new 10b5-1 program in March 2018 ahead of its recent capital raise, and can start selling again next week post lock-up. Analysts have 
relentlessly said “Buy” but at the current time analysts have an average price target of $99/sh, which represents just 7% upside, a poor risk/reward. 
Analysts fail to appreciate the change in competitive dynamics, and extrapolate 2U’s current performance into the future without having done the 
exhaustive FOIA and program analysis we’ve undertaken.  Once reality sets in that 2U’s best days are behind it, and it begins disappointing unrealistic 
Street expectations, we expect significant valuation compression risk given its shares trade at 9.5x and 180x 2019E sales and Adj EBITDA, respectively.

2U Looks Like A Vehicle To Enrich Insiders, 
While Destroying Value For Shareholders


2U was founded in 2008. In over a decade since its founding, there is no evidence it has built a business of any value. 


Cumulative free cash flow since reporting in 2011 amounts to a loss of $225m. 


Over the same time periods, insiders have stashed in their piggy banks $148m from stock sales. Who is laughing to the bank?


Now ask yourself, does 2U look like a vehicle to enrich insiders or investors?

Industry Participants Point To A Lot of 
Challenges For OPMs And 2U Specifically


Why 2U And The OPM Industry Does Not Have SaaS-Like Characteristics: 
“The cost of launching online programs is going up as student acquisition costs increase.” --insidehighered.com
“Everybody is wondering how to scale.” --insidehighered.com


New Model of “Fee-for-Service” disrupting “Revenue Share”:
“The notion that a decade from now, universities are going to be paying half or two-thirds of their revenue for some marketing and tech services is ridiculous.”
-- John Katzman, founder of Noodle Partners and 2U
“Only a finite number of institutions that will continue to seek out the revenue-share model.” – Paxton Riter, founder of iDesign
“A fee-for-service agreement allowed us to bolster the areas where we needed additional support while carefully stewarding our resources . . .Further, the fee-for-service 
agreement had a shorter duration, which gave us time to build our internal capacity and did not lock us into a long-term contract.” -- insidehighered.com
“Our fees and those of our providers will end up totaling about 30% of tuition.” – Noodle Partners
“The revenue share is outrageous,” comments NYU Steinhardt’s Brewer, who partnered with 2U and HotChalk to launch several degrees. “But, of course, we couldn’t have 
done it ourselves.” --insidehighered.com


2U’s Technology Is Often A Complaint
“It amazes me that higher education leaders would chose to partner with an OPM like 2U. 2U demands that their university partners use the 2U LMS [Learning 
Management System] platform and this is NOT an advantage. The 2U LMS is clunky and outdated and doesn’t compare to the leading LMS platforms the university 
already has in place. This just causes confusion – faculty in the 2U programs must use two very different platforms to teach non-2U courses. 2U courses are cookie cutter 
and require weekly synchronous meetings which is counter to one of the major benefits of online learning - ANYWHERE and ANYTIME! And don’t get me started about the 
10 year contract. But don’t worry, technology probably won’t change too much in 10 years. In my opinion, fee-for-service OPMs are the only way to go when an institution 
needs external support to launch a new online program.“-- A Tipping Point for OPM?, Insidehighered.com


Profit Motives Intertwined With Non-Profit Education Poses Risks
“These outside contractors may be supporting and supplying online programming effectively, but the involvement of a third-party—particularly a profit-seeking entity—in 
providing services so intertwined with the actual teaching and learning also presents potential risks to quality and value in the education. Specifically, the growing use of 
for-profit intermediaries to provide online programming at public institutions raises important questions concerning whether these agreements appropriately shield 
students from the profit-seeking motives of these companies, inform students about exactly who is responsible for the education they are receiving, and provide quality 
education that is up to the standards of institutions backed by the full faith and credit of states.” -- tcf.org


The Cons of Outsourcing Online Program Management:  
• “High Opportunity Cost with take-rates over 50%”
• “Unpredictable and Non-Transparent Marketing Efforts”
• “Loss of Control over Brand”
• “Program Infrastructure is Not Owned” -- Vontweb.com

The Fallacy of Steady State Revenues:  
Lower Take-Rates Have Arrived!


2U claims it gets 60% revenue shares with universities known in the industry as its “take-rate”. Competitors are 


significantly pressuring the historical industry take-rate. We obtained the University of Illinois MBA Contract with 


Coursera (a 2U Competitor) that was signed in March of 2017.  Coursera’s take-rate is 40%. This illustrates the fallacy of 


assuming that 2U’s historical performance will continue going forward in a period of margin compression.

Historical Estimates of Program Performance 
Shows Significant Underperformance


The original four programs (pre-2013 cohort) have been a success.   In the following three years (2013 – 2015), 2U launched 14 


more programs.   Eight of the 14 programs (57%) launched are underperforming 2U’s “steady state program guidance”.  The Street 


isn’t appreciating the bifurcation of successful and underperforming launches within each cohort.  Rather, we believe the Street is 


dangerously using program averages and 2U’s “steady state program” guidance, and is likely assuming that ~84 program 


launches from 2016 to 2021 will all be successful.

The Platform Revenue Retention 
Rate should have included 13 


programs (not 12). 


Was the omission an 
underperforming program?   


Was 2U cherry picking programs 
to include in this ratio?  


As we will show on this and following pages, 2U’s disclosure began to change after 2015.   We believe the disclosure changes were a deceptive 
move by management to avoid the recognition of underperforming programs.    2U’s MD&A up until 2015 attributed the aggregate increase in 
revenues between each of the cohorts (pre-2013, 2013, 2014 and 2015).  2U continued to disclose Platform Revenue Retention Rate (a 
comparative revenue measure for programs operating at least 2 full years).   


In the 3Q17 10Q, 2U disclosed that they would stop reporting Platform Revenue Retention: 
"Platform Revenue Retention Rate” 
Beginning with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have ceased using platform revenue retention rate to evaluate the success of our growth 
strategy. In our Graduate Program Segment, we operate under long-term contracts, and since inception, have not lost a contract for an operating 
program or had material period over period revenue declines in the programs we operate under these contracts. We have also extended seven of our 
first 11 contracts prior to expiration and have no contracts that are scheduled to expire prior to 2021. Given these facts, we have determined that 
platform revenue retention rate currently provides little to no value in evaluating our business and is not expected to provide value in the future.”


This implies that some 
programs have had declines 


year-over-year, but the 
“materiality threshold” is 


based on aggregate revenues


What investor would not find 
value in continuing to 


monitor this metric.  We liken 
this to a retail store no longer 


reporting SSS because the 
metric was swayed too much 


by mature stores

Recent Capital Raise Likely Indicates That Growth 
Profile of The Core Business Is Weakening


2U’s recent equity raise at the end of May 2018 may indicate that organic growth is set to slow, and it needs more 


acquisitions to plug the hole.  Look at the change in the “Use of Proceeds” between the equity raise in Sep ’17 vs. 


May ‘18. Management wants more capital for deals, yet it has not demonstrated its acquisition of GetSmarter can 


deliver value for shareholders, and that it can turn its business cash flow positive.

2U acquired GetSmarter, a online short course provider, on July 3, 2017.  We find that the Street all too often does not 


disaggregate “tuck-in” acquisitions and ascribes the same valuation multiples from the previously existing business.  


The Short Course segment offers significantly less revenue visibility in a more competitive marketplace where brand is often 


less significant than the content of the course.   


A Full Course student represents 10 –
20 FCEs  vs. a short course student 


that represents 1 FCE.   


The revenue visibility in the short 
course segment is significantly less 
given a course length of 10 weeks, 


and initial contact to conversion of 1 
month versus the full course segment 
comparable of 2 years of study and 7 


months from initial contact to 
conversion.    


Revenue recognition differs in these 
two segments.  The short course 
segment recognizes 100% of the 
course cost and then expenses 


“curriculum and teaching”.  The full 
course segment only recognizes 2U’s 


“tuition take-rate”.  In both 
segments, 2U is partnering with 


universities.   Why are they 
recognizing gross course revenues in 


one case and just its portion in the 
latter?

The Fallacy of Steady State Revenues
20


The Fallacy of Steady State Revenues: The OPM 
Market And Why The Model Is Being Disrupted


The OPM Market worked ten years ago when the stigma of online education had a perception of risk.  This is no longer the case.


Why The OPM Market Used To Make Sense
The OPM industry (Full Service Revenue Share) gained initial traction with universities that wanted to offer an online degree commensurate with the 
campus degree.   Initially, this dual offering (online and campus) gained more acceptance with graduate programs versus their undergraduate 
equivalents.   As universities became more open to offering their graduate programs online, there was a need for the entire end-to-end solution which 
included assistance with marketing, enrollment and all of the technology (e.g. LMS -- Learning Management System).  In its infancy, many universities 
were skeptical of the success and acceptance of online degrees.  Therefore, OPMs alleviated a lot of the financial stress to deliver these programs as they 
would invest all of the upfront capital (sometimes upwards of $10m) in order to deliver students and create the degree online.  In return for their capital 
commitment, the OPMs would typically take 60%-70% of the tuition (i.e. tuition take-rate) and require contract lengths that ranged from 10 to 15 years. 


Why The OPM Market is Becoming Obsolete In Many Ways
Today, the stigma of obtaining a degree online, especially at the graduate level, has dissipated significantly.  Therefore, the “upfront capital risk” of a 
university starting an online graduate degree equivalent is now considered “lower risk.”   Further, universities don’t want to give up 60% to 70% of their 
tuition, be tied to contracts that last 10 to 15 years, nor want to give up ownership of their intellectual property.  


Therefore as the industry has matured, new entrants have begun to enter the marketplace. The OPM landscape has been separated into two distinct 
models: Full Service Revenue Share (traditional OPMs) and fee-for-service (new disruptors).   The fee-for-service (aka “unbundling of services” can offer 
universities the distinct modules and/or products specific to their individual needs.   Each “fee-for-service” company concentrates on their unique core 
competency (i.e. enrollment services, marketing and/or technology) and some will additionally act as a general contractor helping the university 
assemble an end-to-end online degree offering more customization with lower total costs and less onerous contracts.  


“Smart Provosts and CFOs are already rejecting OPM contracts as inconsistent with the long-term goals of the university. . . We are fast approaching the 
moment at which the permanent revenue share model will disappear. And so some of the traditional OPMs now offer schools as much as $2 million as a 
signing bonus. They’re not doing it out of a humanitarian impulse; they’re doing it to prop themselves up, knowing that their profit on your students will be 
ten or twenty times that.” – Noodle Partners

The Fallacy of 2U’s Steady State 
Program Revenues


The Fallacy of 2U’s Steady State Program Revenues:   


• Steady State Revenues For Future Programs Will Be Lower Than Predecessors Mainly Due To Lower Tuition Take-Rates.  Competitive pressures 
along with greater university acceptance of distance learning is already leading to lower tuition take-rates from service providers.  We 
obtained a recent contract from a competitor where the tuition take-rate is disclosed at 40%. This is significantly lower than the 60%-65% 
take-rates that 2U claims it continues to achieve.   This contract is evidence of the disruption occurring in the Online Program Manager 
(OPM) competitive landscape.  We have talked with many industry participants and we layout the competitive value proposition being 
delivered by Noodle Partners (founded by 2U’s former Chairman and CEO, John Katzman).  We find that Noodle, along with other 
disruptive competitors, can deliver a comparable model at half the cost to the university.  Further, the stigma attached to online (aka 
distance learning) graduate programs has decreased significantly over the past decade.  The legacy OPM model was more attractive a 
decade ago when universities were unsure if distance learning would gain acceptance at the graduate level.  OPM’s historically offered a 
very compelling value proposition, as the OPM would take on the upfront capital risk (up to $10m) to set up the program in return for 
+65% of student tuition over the course of a 10 to 15 year contract.   Today, the stigma associated with distance learning (especially at the 
graduate level) has dissipated significantly.  Therefore, universities are coming to the appropriate conclusion that they can invest the 
substantial upfront capital in order to retain more of their own tuition. The Street is neglecting how this industry is both maturing and 
changing.  


• Steady State Revenues For Future Programs Will Be Lower Than Predecessors As Newer Programs In The Same Verticals Have Lower Tuition 
Rates:  Steady state performance for mature programs need to be reduced from the $16m that 2U guides investors to.  Some of the 
verticals are becoming commoditized.  For instance, our work reveals that the three most recent MBA program launches (Simmons
Enterprise ‘16, University of Dayton ‘17, University of Denver ’18) charge tuition that is on average 40% less then the first three MBA 
program launches (UNC ‘11, Syracuse ‘15, American ‘15).  As the internet has disrupted many other industries, we see the broad 
acceptance of distance learning being another catalyst that allows the Internet to significantly reduce graduate tuition costs. For instance, 
there are now reputable MBA’s (e.g. University of Illinois iMBA) that now cost ~$22,000.   It is going to be increasingly difficult for 
prospective online MBA students to pay $80K to $120K (i.e. American, Syracuse, and UNC) when a comparable curriculum can be offered 
at ~20% of the cost.

assuming it reaches 2U’s steady state revenues and margin profile.

2017 Investor Day – 10/05/17
“It takes five years to six years for a 
first program in a vertical to steady 
state, to get to that sort of natural 
peak of annual enrollment. It takes 
four-ish years for those programs to 
breakeven. But as they steady state, 
it is our expectation that an average 
2U program will generate $16 million 
in top line revenue and generate mid-
30s adjusted EBITDA margins.”


Oppenheimer Conference 8/10/15
“So for our first program, our 
cumulative net negative cash 
investment is typically in the range of 
$10 million before we get to adjusted 
EBITDA and cash flow breakeven. . 
.launching a second, third or fourth 
program in the vertical however, our 
cumulative net negative cash 
investment usually falls by about half, 
more in the range of $5 million. . .  
the roughly $5 million to $10 million
in cumulative net negative cash flow 
we refer to, is not an upfront 
investment with additional negative 
cash flows expected. It is the total 
cash investment we expect to make to 
get a program to breakeven.”


To arrive at our NPV per future program, we assume the midpoint of $7.5M 
($5M to $10M) of negative cash outflow prior to a program starting and up 
until completion of its second year

Sensitivity Analysis: Lower Take-Rates And 
Lower Tuitions = Margin Compression


Source:  Company Filings and Spruce Point Estimates
Note: To hit 2U’s EBITDA range requires 480 students, not the 300 depicted by management


Disruption and innovation in the distance learning market will lead to lower take-rates.   


Further, the commoditization of program verticals that have larger markets are now causing lower tuition rates.  


Disruptors are making progress in the 
market and this will lead to lower 
industry take-rates


Commoditization of 
program verticals that 


have larger markets will 
lead to lower tuition 


rates.  We are already 
seeing plenty of 


evidence of tuition 
compression in the MBA 


Vertical, which is the 
most important vertical

MBA programs launching 


in 2018 and 2019

We obtained the University of Illinois MBA Contract with Coursera (a rising 2U Competitor) that was signed in 2017. 


Coursera’s take-rate is 40%.  This illustrates a successful competitor disrupting 2U in its traditional MBA space.

Total enrollments for a 
competitive MBA degree by 


Coursera grew by 274% y/y for 
their Fall ‘17 Cohort.  This 


implies an even more 
impressive “new start” growth 
if you consider that 50% of the 


264 students enrolled in Fall 
‘16 graduated.


This is demonstrating that a 
lower cost (not lower quality) 
MBA is gaining market share 


and that 2U’s competition can 
ramp a program very quickly 


even when they are garnering 
lower tuition take-rates


Coursera recently raised capital 
at an $800M valuation and has 


a deep bench of advisors 
including Yale University’s

The Fallacy of Steady State Revenues:  
Disruptors Are Making Significant Progress


As the OPM model (% of Tuition) has garnered success over the last decade, a new paradigm of competition (fee-for-service) is in


the beginning stages of disrupting the traditional OPM landscape.  We estimate that a “fee-for-service” model can replicate 2U’s


offering and increase the surplus from ~21% of tuition revenues to as high as 48% as shown below.

(2)  Each of the line items in Noodle's service offering represent fees passed through from individual vendors


The “fee-for-service” delivers a 
customized offering to a 
university for their online 


program at significant 
reduction in cost.  In our 
illustration, the university 


keeps an additional 26% of 
their tuition.

Two of three executive hires made at the end of 2017 were 
direct hires from 2U.  As former 2U employees leave to go 


to the disruptors, we think the street should take note

(1)  Simmons College Financials as disclosed in their annual report for the period ending June 30, 2017
(2)  We estimate steady state economics for all of Simmons revenues as ~93% of revenues related to Simmons were generated by Nursing and Social Work, #2 and #3 in new student enrollment for 2017, respectively
(3)  Estimated EBITDA margin for programs operating at or above steady state
(4)  2U programs at Simmons generated over $9M of Surplus (1Q18 CC on 5/3/18)


Spruce Point Uncovering Reality


2U states that economics for a steady state program yield more cash flow to 
the university than to 2U


2U tells investors and faculty administrators that a program partnership will net more cash flow to the university 


than to 2U.  Our research suggests the opposite is true.


Slide 9 -- November 2017 Investor Presentation


Our estimates illustrate the opposite -- 2U is likely earning 70% more than 
Simmons (currently 2Us second largest client)

2Us Most Successful Programs Will Be Difficult to 
Replicate: Case Study – Simmons College


Source: Simmons Financials (Simmons FY15, Simmons FY16, Simmons FY17)


Simmons College has multiple program partnerships with 2U.   Currently, new student enrollment for Simmons College Masters in Nursing and 


Masters in Social Work represent the #2 and #3 ranked “new enrollment” programs for 2017 for all of 2U.  Simmons was the 2nd program in 


each of these verticals following the success of Georgetown’s Nursing and USC’s Social Work programs.  2U likely knew that they had spillover 


demand from these two programs and needed to find a partner where they could place these students and also charge an initial tuition take-rate 


of ~70%.  Simmons took the bait.  Programs with Simmons represented 17% (~$49M) of 2U’s 2017 revenues.  Based on the aforementioned 


information, we believe that 2U’s success with Simmons should not be extrapolated to future programs.   


We believe that  2U’s take-rate which has averaged 68% since 
inception with Simmons is amongst the highest for all of 2Us 
Partners.   


As shown to the left, the USC Masters in Social Work has been 
an extraordinary success for 2U.  Further, Georgetown Nursing 
is one of the best nursing programs in the nation.  


2U had very good data from these initial programs in regards to 
total students enrolled, rejected students from these programs, 
as well as regional data on the prospective student population.  
2U needed a university partner that would quickly understand 
that 2U could deliver excess demand quickly, but it would come 
at a steep price. Given 2Us negotiating leverage at that point, 
2U could command an extraordinarily high tuition take-rate 
percentage.  


This was a great partnership, but we don’t believe it represents 
a proxy for future programs.   The second school in the Social 
Work and Nursing verticals were almost a guaranteed success 
given 2U’s data.   Further, the extraordinarily high tuition take-
rate percentage is not representative of future programs.

While Marketing & Student Recruitment Costs 
(A Major Risk Factor) Is Showing Signs of Materializing


A risk factor in the most recent 2U 10-K highlights how dependent online market efforts are to its business. Based on 


our analysis and third party data, we believe costs for critical keywords related to online education are rising 


significantly. It looks like this risk factor is coming to fruition.

rising as competitive intensity to recruit students rises.  We are now seeing signs of deleveraging in 2U’s results. To 


illustrate, 2017 was the first year where costs per FCE rose after a multi-year period of decline.

Sum of Parts Valuation – Understanding How 
Much Investors Are Paying for Growth


We have assembled a sum-of-parts analysis where we separately value the mature vintages (inception to 2015), new vintages (2016 – 2017), 2U’s 


recent Short Course Segment Acquisition (GetSmarter), and the federal NOL.  This implies that the Street is currently valuing all future programs 


(2018 and Beyond) at ~$3.5B – which further implies ~276 future successful programs.   Not all programs announced will be successful and given 


our future assumptions regarding lower tuition take-rates, commoditizing tuition costs and higher expenses, 2U likely needs to announce well in 


excess of 400 future programs to validate its current stock price.

(1) Revenue for each cohort are Spruce Point Estimates
(2) EBITDA Margins for each cohort were disclosed in the 4Q17 presentation on 2/26/18 and are applied to our Cohort Revenue Estimates
(3) NPV / Program is illustrated here
(4) GetSmarter 2017 revenues were imputed from the pro forma disclosure in the FY17 10K


2U’s current valuation implies that 
investors are paying +$3.5B for 


their future prospects.  We believe 
the NPV value of their future 


prospects could be less than $1B

Precedent Transactions Point To A Much 
Lower Multiple Business


2U currently trades at 12.6x 2018E Revenues. Embanet and Deltak.edu, two of 2U’s most direct OPM competitors, were 


acquired in 2012 at 5.0x and 4.1x revenues, respectively, when we believe the industry was in a more nascent stage and 


growing faster. Given our documented concerns about intensifying competition, we believe any investor owning 2U 


shares at these elevated valuation carries multiple contraction risk.

Peer Group Comparison


2U is the highest valued “Cloud based SaaS” company.   2U is currently priced for perfection and we believe the stock 


will re-rate as downward estimate revisions come to fruition as well as the realization that the EBITDA margin profile 


will never mature similar to its SaaS peer group.

2U is one of the highest valued “Cloud based SaaS” companies.   As Investors conclude that the competitive 


landscape is going to make future programs wins more difficult in addition to not being as profitable to 2U, we believe 


the stock could re-rate to ~$47 representing up to 50% downside from current levels.

Increasing (i.e. marketing cost) 


and a realization amongst

Estimates By Program -- Methodology


Source: Company Filings and Spruce Point Estimates
(1)  The change in revenues from changes in the rebate liability were applied to the Pre-2013 Cohort
(2)  The platform revenue retention rate reported for 2016 of 123% implied $33M of increased revenues applied to the Pre-2013, 2013, and 2014 Cohort
(3)  For the 9M15, Georgetown revenues were 10% of revenues.  Therefore we assume that total Georgetown for FY15 were 9.7% of total FY15 revenues
(4)  For the 9M17, Syracuse revenues were $20.3M (10% of revs).  Therefore we assume that total Syracuse revenues were 9.7% of total FY17 revenues


Before estimating revenues at the program 
level, we first created a historical revenue 
model from 2011 to 2015 using 2U’s MD&A 
disclosure in the 2015 10K.   We therefore, 
were able to impute the revenues for each 
cohort from 2U’s inception to 2015.   For 2016, 
we used the platform retention rate of 123% 
which implied ~$33M of increased y/y 
revenues applied to the Pre-2013, 2013, and 
2014 Cohort.   The rest of the cohort data was 
assembled by year using data and estimates on 
the following pages.   Anything in red in the 
exhibit on the right is an estimate based on 
our work and diligence.   Anything in black is 
not an estimate and was either a reported 
number or derived from a reported number.
