BofI Holding: A Bank Model Fraught With Peril, 65% Downside Based
On 1.6 X Book Value
Mar. 19, 2014 10:12 AM ET40 comments
by: Greenwich Research Group


Summary


Extremely overvalued at 5 x Book Value.


Flawed business model with waning profits.


Potential capital raise at $80 per share or lower.


Aggressive reserving.


Enormous interest rate risk.


A favorite of the retail momentum investors, Bank of the Internet (BOFI) has been on a
tear over the past couple of years, rising from $16 in early 2012 to over $100 today. But at
almost 5x book value, we find the valuation excessive, and believe that the stock is due
for a large correction. We don't think that the average investor understands the risks here.
We find the business model flawed, and that a large generator of recent earnings growth
is vanishing. We think the bank is taking an enormous amount of interest rate risk, much
more so than a well-run bank would take on in our opinion. We question the quality of
earnings given the recent reductions in reserves for non-performing assets (NPAs). We
further believe that one of the reasons for the recent acceleration in the stock price, the
potential for the acquiring the H&R Block stored value card deposits, would require a
capital raise on the order of $200 million, which would mandate pricing at a 20% discount
to the current stock price.


It's interesting, when we ask bank fund managers what stocks they are short. BOFI is
often the first name they mention. From a valuation and risk perspective it's an obvious
candidate. Trading at 5 times its book value and over 32 times the 2013 EPS, it's more
than a bit rich for a mortgage driving California thrift. Here is how BOFI compares to some
of its competitors and how we derive our $35 target:

Pacific Premier (NASDAQ:PPBI) 1.6 12


Banner (NASDAQ:BANR) 1.5 17


Wintrust (NASDAQ:WTFC) 1.2 18


Umpqua (NASDAQ:UMPQ) 1.2 22


Provident (NASDAQ:PROV) 1.0 13


Everbank (EVER) 1.6 19


However, it's even more amazing that BOFI's numbers are driven by a depreciating -
wasting away - non-agency mortgage asset. Basically the company made a timely
decision and bought various duration mortgage assets at the bottom of the credit cycle at
deep discounts to par. The earnings from these assets are waning. As these assets run-
off, we expect net interest margin (NIM) to drop by 30bp next year. Without other lending
opportunities, this may reduce EPS by $.10 this coming quarter and by $.40 over the
course of calendar year 2014.


One of the reasons for the recent exponential shift in BOFI's price is the stored value card
business. The street thinks that BOFI will be buying the H&R Block stored value portfolio
that has been for sale for more than two years. Every bank that has looked at it has
realized that they cannot make 12+% earnings multiple on the business. Management has
hinted at this transaction forever, but what isn't mentioned is that if they get the transaction
they would need to raise $200 million in capital to support this $6 billion block! In our
opinion, this cannot get done at anything close to current share prices - no big bank funds
would participate at 5x book value. The transaction would not be accretive for at least 2
years. We estimate it gets done at a maximum of $80 per share to attract the amount of
funding needed to support the H&R Block business. To the best of our knowledge, none of
the big bank funds own BOFI now, so why would they buy in at current prices?


So, who owns Bank of The Internet now? In our opinion, long-term holders who don't want
to take the gain, retail traders, and momentum funds who know not what they own, but
just that it goes up. Typically stocks of this nature have dramatic moves at the slightest

earnings miss, regulatory order, or negative mention in the press. As an example, this
chart shows what happened right before last quarter's earnings announcement. A
relatively benign Seeking Alpha article called into question the earnings fundamentals of
the bank - and boom, the price dropped over 10% in one day.


This article just scratched the surface of what is wrong with this bank. Let me start with the
most egregious issues. First, it's blatantly obvious to anyone who reads the 10-Q that the
bank is betting your investment dollars on "Red". Red, being that interest rates stay down.
Does the term Negative Gap Ratio mean anything to you? Well, go into your local bank
and ask the CFO if they would run a triple digit negative gap ratio. Most banks keep this
ratio as close to zero as possible. It's a measure of interest rate sensitivity. If a bank
expects interest rates to stay low they may have a negative gap ratio of minus 5-10%. If a
bank wants to be asset sensitive (expects rates to rise) they may keep a slightly positive
gap ratio. For example, Banner lists a +13% cumulative gap ratio in its latest 10-Q.
Umpqua lists the gap ratio at (-10%) in its 10-Q. But from BOFI's 10-Q, their cumulative
gap is (-138%)!

So, for BOFI, a steep rise in interest rates will obliterate the earnings per share. Banks
cannot adjust this overnight. It takes time to right size the balance sheet. BOFI responds
to this risk by claiming that they will just keep interest rates low on their depositors for a
longer period than other banks. This makes absolutely no sense. BOFI will need to raise
rates the same or even more so than other banks. As an internet bank, it doesn't have
loyal depositors. The bank has to pay .71% on checking accounts. In our opinion,
depositors will move money at the drop of a hat to get a better rate at a competitor.


In the past, BOFI has offered one of the highest interest rates on money market and CD
deposits in the country. This is how it has been getting customers. Up until recently, if you
wanted a high rate of return on your risk free assets, deposit your money at BOFI, (just
don't go over the FDIC $250,000 limit if you want it to be risk free). For example, if you
went to bankrate.com a couple of months ago and clicked on "Best CD rates" in the
country, BOFI may have come out on top, sporting some of the best rates for a given CD
or checking account. But if you go there now, BOFI doesn't even show up in the Top 10,
and oftentimes not in the Top 20. BOFI has clearly backed off the market and this may
affect deposit growth dramatically. For example, for a 5 Year CD, the current best rate in
the country is 2.2% offered by GE Capital. If you scroll down the list, BOFI comes in 22nd
place with 1.35%. BOFI Is clearly cutting back, probably because it realizes it has too
much interest rate risk. If BOFI continues this strategy, then the high growth rates are a
thing of the past, and BOFI's price multiple should come way down to reflect this. I really
don't see how this strategy will work given the dynamics of an internet bank. Here is a
recent article discussing these dynamics when BOFI had market-leading rates:

Banks generally benefit from rising rates because they can charge more for loans
while adding very little to how much they pay for deposits. Over time, a rising-rate
environment leads to larger net interest margin -- the difference between interest
paid and interest received. Some banks are better positioned than others to benefit
from rising rates. Let's see how the industry stacks up.


Online Bankers Miss 
Competing on price -- interest rates, in this case -- can be a banker's downfall in a
rising rate environment. BofI Holding (NASDAQ: BOFI) and Everbank (NYSE:
EVER) do just that: They steal deposits from other banks by offering above-average
rates on deposits. Because online banks compete on price, their deposits tend to be
less "sticky." Customers choose an online bank based on returns, not features or
advantages like branch networks. As of its last presentation, BofI Holding, which
owns Bank of Internet USA, was primarily funded with higher-cost certificates of
deposit. CDs made up 49.8% of its deposit mix, substantially more than other online
and offline banks. Everbank, by contrast, sourced 23% of its deposits from CDs and
other time deposits.


Offline banks have much cheaper funding sources. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC)
funds its balance sheet with very low-cost savings and checking account balances,
which make up nearly $800 billion of its $1 trillion in deposits. It's "core deposits," or
funding that it doesn't expect to vary greatly over time, makes up 94% of deposits,
costing the bank 0.14% per year in the most recent quarter. Bank of America
(NYSE: BAC) pays only 0.17% for its American deposit mix.

Not surprisingly, high-interest internet banks rely more heavily on time deposits and
CDs, which increase their funding costs.


The online banks have a tremendous advantage in a low-rate environment, when
the difference between rates is a huge selling point for low-cost operators. Bank of
Internet's 0.71% APY high-interest checking accounts look like an exceptional deal
when rates are low. But will the promise of 0.71% on checking accounts be just as
attractive if short-term rates run to 1%?


Think about it this way: Wells Fargo pays up to .01% on checking account balances.
Bank of Internet offers 0.71%. If rates rise by 1%, Wells Fargo will offer as much as
1.1% on deposits, whereas Bank of Internet might offer 1.71%. Some 61 basis
points isn't as compelling when the baseline is 1.1% interest on checking accounts.


But even that scenario may be too friendly to online banks. The fact of the matter is,
traditional bank customers aren't fleeing from large operators like Wells Fargo. If
rates go up, they have no real need to push rates higher -- their customers don't use
Wells Fargo because it offers the best rates.


For BofI Holding and Everbank, rising rates will undoubtedly require that they
step up their interest rates in line with increases in short- and long-term rates.
[emphasis added] That could pressure their net interest margin while big, national
operators like Wells Fargo and Bank of America use their trillions of dollars in low-
cost deposits to make much more profitable loans.


BOFI's issues aren't just limited to its liabilities. BOFI's assets, and its reserves, raise
some questions as well. The Bank makes non-conforming jumbo loans across the country.
These loans are typically made to investors based on 1099 income or K1 income (AKA
the Alt-A non-conforming investor that World Savings made negative amortization loans to
for 30 years) While there is an after-market for these loans, it's not traditional. When the
stock market sells off, these loans based not on investors' salaries but instead on stock
market gains and illiquid assets may become delinquent. There is the potential that in the
future these Non-QM Mortgages (Non-Qualifying Mortgages) will be put back to the bank.
Other banks we have interviewed have told us they stopped making these loans as of the
end of 2013.


The NPAs:

Over the past several quarters, BOFI has reduced its reserves for Non-Performing Loans
(NPAs) to 58 bp! In our opinion, this is extremely low. We wonder why they are so
aggressive. Could it be that they wanted to juice earnings so as to beat the expectations in
each quarter? Why do most brick-and-mortar banks, who arguably have better knowledge
of their credits and therefore better underwriting, reserve for NPAs at roughly 180bp when
BOFI has only 58bp? In the future, BOFI's earnings can't be "improved" much further from
reductions in NPAs as they have in the past. Further, if even a small number of their
credits go south, BOFI doesn't have the reserve to cover them, so earnings will get hit and
BOFI will need to build the reserve up for expected future claims. At 58bp there is very
little margin for error.


When you look at the large owners of BOFI, you will find very few bank funds. I am not
surprised at all, but this should be a clear red flag to any retail investor who is long the
stock. Here are the large owners from Yahoo Finance:

Imperial was also a Southern California bank that made non-relationship loans that filed
for bankruptcy several years back. Andrew J. Micheletti is currently the Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of BOFI. He was formerly the Controller for Imperial
Savings. These holders are not bank funds. These are quant shops, index funds, and
momentum firms. There is no Wellington, Harvest, Stilwell, Jacobs Asset, EFJ Alternative
Asset. The large intelligent value driven financial services managers have sold a long time
ago. We asked one bank fund manager whose fund manages over $400M what he
thought of BOFI (He has requested to remain anonymous).

It's like Imperial Savings Industries all over again. They don't make relationship
loans instead their loans are made on an internal algorithm that the guys from Long
Term Capital may understand, but no one else gets.


The financial services fund manager went on to say that:


As a banker, you need to know who your loans are being made to. This bank (Bank
of the Internet), when the credit cycle turns may never see these assets paid back.
There will be a catalyst, either a regulatory order, a turn in interest rates or a change
in credit. Something or someone will tell us that the emperor wears no clothes


There are numerous complaints on Bank of the Internet. I guess running an internet bank
the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. We found it interesting that the CEO of the
bank chose to respond to the online complaints. Here are a few of the more colorful
examples.


Awful bank making too many serious mistakes and underpaying the interests


I wonder if the other customers have gotten similar experience with the SAF Branch.
They make far too many serious mistakes, and are very slow in correcting them (if
they eventually decide to do so). You should double check and calculate your
interest payment to make sure they are not underpaid. Mine has been underpaid for
about half. They also haven't been keeping their promise.


Incompetent employees


Definitely not a place if you are looking for real advise on financial matters.
Representative do not have the knowledge beyond the basics. Experience,
knowledge, and customer service does not seem to be high on the list when hiring
candidates. It seems that personality is the only trait HR looks for when hiring
individuals. However, pure personality does not take you far enough. Definitely do
not recommend BOI.


Purely Awful

Attempted to open a rewards checking account. Went through the standard online
application and was told I would receive back confirmation in 4-5 hours. After no
word back in two days I called and was told I needed to mail my drivers license (note
not a copy of my license) to an address in San Diego. After some very unhelpful
back and forth with an offshore customer service rep I gave up. Total let down,
avoid!


The Worst Customer Service and Sketchy Technology


While the interest rates may be marginally higher & fees and charges marginally
lower, the stellar customer service I had 10 years ago is gone. Now, every complaint
submitted automatically gets a "resolved" & I have to resubmit multiple times -- some
have still not been addressed. My issues include:


- my account was accessed by someone from Intuit as I received an email with
Intuit.com. I did not authorize any non-bank personnel to do anything to my account
at the time. When I reported it, I was told they were "fixing the issue with text
messages" (see below) but the issue isn't fixed


- they've brought in more 3rd parties that receive my data (e.g. the service that
prepares the statements for them) - clearly they don't care about my privacy


- I snapped a clear deposit photo 4x today with my Galaxy 3, following their advice,
but it wasn't accepted


Terrible Customer Service and Lack of Basic Finance Knowledge Beyond the Most Basic


So far they have duplicated a deposit, not allowed pop money, and not delivered my
check to a payee but offered to charge $35 to stop payment and send it again. My
suggestion is to find a different online bank. Now they have rejected mobile deposits
because they do not understand the word beneficiary. A supervisor finally overruled
after multiple notes and phone calls and allowed the deposits, but they forgot to do
one. They are the worst banking customer service group I have ever worked with.
Also, if you do a mobile deposit, make sure you check that it goes in because they
rejected mine with no email notification whatsoever. They claimed the system was
broken but only after I asked.

The company's stock price has had a perfect momentum manager's chart for the last
three years, but over the last three months it has been parabolic. Let's delve into why that
is. Over the last 3 months there have been over 10 positive articles written on the name.
The Motley Fool, Authors on Seeking Alpha, IBD have more than foamed at the mouth.
We believe that the Motley Fool did a six article piece on the company (does it really take
6 articles to pump a simple bank stock). One, maybe two, but not six. Obviously, it was
someone's intention to drive the stock price up! Here is a sampling:

The Critical Thing You are Overlooking at these Banks


However, some of the comments from these articles called into question the bullish thesis.
HERE IS ONE that hits home:


I think you guys are really missing the regulatory point here. Other banks are not
doing this because they are not allowed to do it. From a theoretical standpoint,
funding oneself with brokered deposits and CDs that pay higher than market interest
rates, and then growing at a breakneck pace is not good for the overall risk of the
market. Can you imagine what would happen if every other bank tried to do this?
Credit quality would go into the toilet overnight. Technologically and feasibly, every
other bank could run this business model overnight. BOFI is operating in a
regulatory loophole essentially, and while that can continue as long as things go
well, it is unrealistic to think that the government will let them grow to be a
systemically important bank (which a $20b bank would be) with only one branch.


What's more amazing is that this company started from nothing. This was a small bank
lender making a bunch of RV loans, with other hairball assets. The company made an
amazing bet on non-agency assets at the bottom of the credit cycle, offered very high

5/20/2018 BofI Holding: A Bank Model Fraught With Peril, 65% Downside Based On 1.6 X Book Value - BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOFI) | Seekin…

interest rates and gave out Non Qualifying mortgages (in our opinion) like crack to addicts
on street corners.


In fiscal 2013, which ended June 30, the company pocketed $22.9 million in mortgage
banking fees, a nearly 500% increase since 2011. This goosed EPS growth, which
increased by a more modest but still impressive 55% during the same period. Put another
way, as mortgage banking income increased by $18.2 million in the last two years, income
before taxes increased by $34 million. Clearly, mortgage banking has been an important
part of the company's recent growth story. A 35% decline in total originations across the
industry versus the first half of the year along with continued headwinds in 2014 will make
it difficult for the company to repeat this performance.


Other issues consist of regulatory risk as they reach into the structured settlements
business which they mostly keep on balance sheet. We believe that their regulator (the
OCC) may at some point have issues with life settlements business. There is a reason
most conservative banks don't touch loans in this sector.


While the earnings growth numbers may have been jacked up by high deposit rates and
non-traditional lending models have been high, it seems the building blocks of this
institution might not be solid. There is a reason why successful banks grow slowly. Each
loan is looked at as a long-term relationship. A customer is not an algorithm and while it is
easy to rapidly increase assets through this model, the non-performing loans always tick
up when credit turns. However, in this case there is the potential of a double whammy. If
credit turns, the bank has problems; if interest rates go up, the bank has big problems; if
regulators have an issue with the aggressive growth, the bank has huge problems. I think
that at 5 times book and 32 times earnings, an investment in Bank of The Internet does
not justify the risk.

SapientInvestor
Have you considered the fact that most of the portfolio loans are adjustable rate? I think you may be underestimating
the stickiness of depositors. Yes they made the initial decision to move accounts because of pricing which was large
enough spread to warrant the effort but once there they will require a somewhat equally large incentive to move
again. Average LTV of mortgage assets is abnormally conservative and should have probably been mentioned in your
analysis. Also, taking samples of comments made online regarding customer service in my opinion would not be very
scientific. How many people are going to take time out of their day to write a positive review of their bank if everything
is up to their standards. I agree that the valuation is rich and there are always risks but hardly a reason to short a
stock in my opinion. Best of luck though and I enjoyed the analysis even if I felt it was a bit one sided.

I wonder how many of the 55 followers lose on this one (will you gain any???).


This is a poor, speculative, biased writing, I must say. You make big statements without really supporting your
statements and giving references. Your intention is clearly to move the price down (=dishonest gain), and not to
present a well-rounded analysis with pro-cons, based on FACTS to the readership.


Your statements are more than one-sided and opinionated: „overvalued at 5 x Book Value”, “Flawed business model”,
“Enormous interest rate risk”, “we ask bank fund managers what stocks they are short. BOFI is often the first name
they mention”, “So, who owns Bank of The Internet now? In our opinion..” (…). You do not provide the reader with
ANY serious backing to your assumptions. We are not interested in your OPINION, but FACTS and solid
assumptions, conclusions, which you fail to make.


BOFI is a revolutionary game, a growth (...!) stock. It operates much cheaper than most banks. You cannot compare
BOFI with large banks, much as you cannot compare TSLA and Ford, AMZN and Kmart. Hence looking at only P/ BV,
trailing P/E are flawed! Why do you not look at PEG??? Why not try and extrapolate future earnings and discount
them? Future potentials of a GROWTH play? What about the FACTS? A well-round analysis? You refer to an SA
author’s article (Michael Nau), which drove the price of BOFI down in fall of 2013, but then the same author in a later
article went back on his words, accepting he was not right about many of the statements in his article? Will you do
something to defend your credibility?


At least you admit you are trying to press the price of BOFI down, being a short.

Nice try but your reasoning is flawed. They sailed through last quarter with 35% growth in a declining mortgage
market. Mortgage transactions are down. There are NO insider sales in 2014. The management and the directors,
one of which has $50MM in the stock, have not sold a share. It does not need capital so they will not have an offering.
The ROE and ROA are the envy of every branch bank. Their market share is less than 1% and the growth will
continue for many years. The stock is selling at less than its growth rate and the high ROE is just a testament to how

successful they have become. They have the highest ROE of any U.S. Bank with moderate leverage. They have been
in the current business for 15 years and have perfected the model. There infrastructure is sufficient to grow the bank
100% with no branches. My account works flawlessly for deposits and other banking activity. If you really did try 4
times to deposit a check you are slightly retarded.


Your obvious bear raid uses weak reasoning and little knowledge of the company. You have entered the panic zone of
shorts as the stock has gone against you big time and you have huge losses. Your only out is to publish misleading
data to flush out weak holders. I assume your hedge fund is being redeemed out as we speak do to your poor
performance. I am also sure you are covering on this article.

The thesis of offering higher rates to depositors is the strategy. You miss the point that since they are the low cost
provider with respect to direct banking costs, they can offer higher rates and still maintain a high ROA. That leverage
is driving brick and mortar banks crazy as they try to compete. Wells announced layoffs at branch banks to try and
lower costs but that will not work. They still have the bank building, the safe deposit boxes, and the staff. Wells and
others are ceding the deposit business to BOFI in exchange for gathering investment assets. Their high end offices
are converting to asset mgt. offices and in some cases the branch will close and Wells Asset Mgt will have new
quarters. This has already happened to Southern CA.


The analyst at Gilder Gagnon is one of the best and has been in the stock for some time owning 3.2%. We
understand you have large losses, have been wrong, and are in danger of losing your job.

Do I sell? No, thank you.


Fundamentally, BOFI has advantage over offline similar sized banks that it can run on much lower overheads. It does
not mean that it will wipe out all other banks ... it just means it has better prospects than other similar sized banks.


It is not in the same league as WFC & JPM & BofA of the world .......... but so are thousands of other banks and they
are doing just fine.

I am glad that you pointed out that it is selling for 5xBV. Since it does not have to have a mortar & brick building, its
(my) assets are not stuck in building but is rather utilized in generating income.


Since it is now obvious to me that this article is just fear-mongering, I can relax and ignore all other points raised in
the article.


It is plain vanilla short seller modus operandi article ........ stock will be down for few days and then we will be ready to
move up. I have no desire to sell my 400% profit stock and pay taxes. Fundamentally, story is good ...... until we get
hundreds of other online only banks.


Thanks for giving an excuse for correction. Stock needed to badly shake off the weaker holders.

I've seen others state that the big banks could easily duplicate the BofI business model. But explain to me how they'd
dump their branches to do so? Even Everbank won't make full commitment.


As a former NetBank and Telebank/E*Trade bank customer and investor, I believe the converse to be true. A
branchless/online bank can ruin their business model by opening branches (and taking on risky loan assets). BofI has
done neither, offer unique tools and services, and are perfecting their ability to interact with customers online. I believe
we'll see clones, but BofI enjoys first mover advantage and the market demographics are shifting in their favor. I'll pull
out if I see tangible evidence that they are taking on risky loans and start opening branches.


I do my business banking at BofA. There is reason for that and they are a good bank. But hands down, I prefer BofI
over BofA customer support to resolve issues. BofI customer support is responsive and knowledgeable. In fact, I've
had service representatives bend over backwards to help me and then personally follow-up to make sure I was happy
with the resolution. No offshore stuff, no multiple call transfers, and easy to talk with a real person in English that's
easily understood.

The Sociology of Finance, Contributor
Excellent article, in the last year I've gone from an unabashed bull to a convinced bear on BOFI.


My first concern was valuation risk (sold my last shares at about $70), but I've also wondered about their reserving
policies. I also don't like how management is so promotional, and how the structured settlement business seems like
piggy bank they use to goose short-term earnings. Haven't thought much about interest rate risk, I guess I'm
convinced rates will stay low for a while, but that is also a good point.


Also, thanks for linking to my article, looks like yours produced a similar drop. Such short-termism alone should give
longs pause. Congrats on your call (I don't short momentum stocks myself). Probably won't win you any friends.

Disclosure; I bought in about a year ago and had a sell order when it hit $100. I no longer have a position in
BOFI. I worked in banking in the late 1990's for I understand how the BOFI business model is designed as
well as some of the issues that BOFI is now facing.


I tend to agree with your analysis, I have read every SEC filing and have read or listened to every presentaion
since June of 2012. Based upon the current price of BOFI, I would not recommend a buy at this level. I am
concerned about the reduced margins and additional regulations that BOFI is facing. My feeling is that BOFI
has reached a point of diminishing returns and there are better financing organizations to invest in.

Despite the overall tone of this article being godawful and bordering on that of an unprofessional, scorned lover, the
content is pretty decent. As a checking account holder and former stock holder, I agree it is overvalued and they do
make mistakes. As a share holder, that bothered me. As a checking account holder, their customer service is great,
imo, and I prefer banking with them instead of a brick-and-mortar bank across the street from my office. Why?
Because, as noted, it's financially beneficial and it's easier. I don't understand why everyone doesn't bank at Bank of
Internet. Seriously, it makes no sense to pay more to get less at bigger banks.


Anyway, back to the larger point of the article, I'd agree the stock is overvalued.

fcianciola
Very weak assumptions. Book value has little or nothing to do with this bank's value. The stock may be ahead of itself
somewhat at 32x earnings but that depends on the rate of growth in assets and earnings based more on a continued
strong operating efficiency ratio. They have the model to collect deposits very efficiently and pay up slightly to assure
"inventory" to lend out. Because of the extremely low overhead (no branches, few people etc.) they can absorb more
cost due to asset quality issues if necessary. I will acknowledge that strict underwriting is a key as is the reasonable
hedge of interest rate risk but I doubt your assumptions in this regard. If they continue to find and grow quality assets
through good underwriting standards they will blow away banks with bricks and mortar and heavy personnel costs.
The industry is changing rapidly but if management can continue to run the bank at a 39% operating efficiency ratio
they can afford to have some charge offs. You may frighten some shareholders into selling but this analysis is very
one sided. Investors need to dig deeper into this unique model. This bank can not be compared to other bank models
without an understanding of their unique advantages. We will see who is right over the long run. I suspect
management is addressing issues appropriately and regulators are watching closely the risk assumed from a credit or
interest rate prospective. Regulators don't ignore fast growth banks on either of these issues. I bought this stock last
summer and I am quite comfortable with my position.

I just bought shares in BOFI recently because of their business model and their efficiency ratio. Do you think that this
article is driving the price down today or is there a more fundamental reason?


19 Mar 2014, 03:33 PM


fcianciola
The article is the cause I would think given how few shares trade daily. It is not too difficult to spook retail
investors. Asset quality is highly regulated and watched by National Bank Examiners. In that the FDIC
guarantees deposits, regulators protect their interest by assuring that no extraordinary risks are being taken
such that the FDIC fund would come into play. This is not the old pre-2008 days. Regulation is extremely tight.
My guess is that asset quality is reasonable. Were it not for regulators, there would be more concern on my
part. Interest rate risk can be hedged at a cost but not an exorbitant cost and given otherwise low overhead
easily absorbed by the company. Having said all of that, things are never as good or as bad as they seem,
and a slight correction to the PE ratio is not too disturbing. In it for the long run or don't take the risk. It is hard
to make anything without a long term approach. The stock is volatile but the upside seems worth some
volatility and short term uncertainty.

Been waiting for opportunity (after Mr. Market got in, out and did a great outline of the business model).


You failed to mention as well big DIPS and their many reason - no up tick rule, computer model. And when it's trading
at an all time high - ok, got to consolidate eventually - so traders get out. And when the "news" in this case a
"negative" article - hits then they are out. (or new buys listing to anal ist then panicking out). I have been in stellar
companies with low float that dip up to 30 points in a day, or more. (Uhal for one) thinly traded.


As far as posting customer comments - you must be kidding!!!

19 Mar 2014, 07:48 PM

I've been working in retail banking for over 13 years, specifically one of the banks mentioned in this article, Wells
Fargo (legacy Wachovia). Some of the assumptions around what rate threshold will trigger customers to move their
liquid assets in search of a better interest rate are incorrect. While it may be true that customers of banks with large
branch networks value the relationship of knowledgeable bankers and advisors as well as the in-person customer
service provided by these banks, many retail clients (consumers and small business customers) will and do move
their non-transactional cash assets for sometimes as low 25 basis points. Typically these customers are mass affluent
clients who have greater than $250,000 in investible assets and many times a large portion of it is sitting in cash and
they will move that money in a heartbeat - the very second that we will not renew an expired promotional rate. For
example in the current rate environment board rates for $100,000 may be 0.35%. However for new deposits the bank
may offer a promotional rate of 1.00% on demand deposits in excess of $100,000 and typically that promotion lasts
for 90 days. Upon expiration loyal customers can request an extension but often receive a stepped-down version of
this promotion, usually 25 basis points lower, i.e., 0.75% which is still higher than the board rate of 0.35%. The Wells
Fargo's and BofA's of the world typically have a take-it-or leave it stance at this point calling the customer's bluff and
many customers write a check right then and there, or reluctantly accept the rate extension, and a week later when
the "significant balance change" report comes out, we check the customers account and it is gone. While many of
these customer's will not close their core checking and other transactional accounts, and will keep a baseline amount
on deposit, those larger deposits are moved around frequently. Those funds are usually transferred to whatever brick-
and-mortar, internet or online bank that is offering a better rate of return. Large banks such as Wells have these
reports issued daily and it is banker's responsibility to win those deposits back. On $250,000 you'd be surprised how
many depositors will move their cash for the extra $1500/year that the 61 basis points difference provides.

There's a difference between the market overvaluing this business from a current price perspective and the actual
company being a "flawed business model". I can agree it's lofty price may not be warranted but I have a problem with
the claim that the business is destined to collapse. I have a small position at an average cost basis of $64. I think I'll
ride this out.

This article fails to realized that BOFI's mortgage loan book is 55% LTV for both multi-family and residential (i.e.
property values would need to fall 45% before their loans would be at risk). Unlike other big banks with tons of toxic
mortgages from giving out 90% LTV loans in 2007, BOFI avoided all of this and has a solid loan portfolio.


They do a lot of non-QM loans because they can still charge high interest rates and the big banks will not touch them.
Two loans that they routinely get referred are (1) loans to foreign nationals (e.g. someone from China wants to buy a
home in San Diego. BofA, Wells will not provide a loan but BofI will if he puts 45% down and has other
assets/income), and (2) loans to complex borrowers (e.g. retired people with large amounts of wealth, or a small
business owner, both do not have consistent W-2 paychecks) Similarly if they put 45% down, BofI will make the loan
when other banks will not.


Also regarding interest rates, this author has failed to note that BofI does not offer the highest interest rates on
BankRate.com, and has not for years. They have still been able to grow their deposit base, especially business
checking, without offering the best rates. Their cost structure is great, and big banks will continue to struggle to
compete when they cannot offer higher interest rates to their customers, nor will they be able to offer lower mortgage

rates. BofI will be the victor, and the CEO has $17MM of stock to boot and he has not sold shares in the stock's
meteoric rise over the past year.

> BofI Holding (NASDAQ: BOFI) and Everbank (NYSE: EVER) do just that: They steal deposits from other banks by
offering above-average rates on deposits.


typical hedge fund bullsh*t (i don't own any bank stocks right now, but like all major credit card companies for quite
some time, only buy u.s. stocks if fidelity and black rock own shares of an interesting stock, because usually they
research quite well for a long term investor)

According to the IBES consensus estimates provided by Thomson Financial the EPS for 2015 is $4.47. Meaning that
the trailing P/E is 17.6!


In the table presented in this article the trailing P/E is set to 32.


I don't understand! 
From where did the author get the number 32? 
Please, clarify!


Thanks!

P/E of 32 belongs to year 2013. 
Year 2013 belongs to the past and most of us are looking forward when evaluating stocks!


For the moment BOFI is a bargain!

"According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 4 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the
quarter is $0.98. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.73." That is a 34.25% increase. Nasdaq
estimates that they will report May 14.


Blue Horseshoe loves BOFI !!!

It's a game-changer. It's going to be controversial. It's going to attract naysayers. 2/3 of brick and mortar branches
lose money and have become very much a sucking chest wound to the old banking model. That's why BOFI can pay
higher rates...much less overhead. The "old" banking industry is way too resistant to change and deserves to be
taken down by the likes of BOFI and INBK, as well as hybrids jumping in like DFS and SCHW. I'm an INBK holder and
just put a limit order in for some BOFI today (4/4/2014)
