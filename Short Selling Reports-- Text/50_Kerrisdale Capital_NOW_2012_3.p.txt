ServiceNow: Insiders Dumping Shares Indicates Overvaluation
Dec. 4, 2012 8:00 AM ET13 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


As detailed in our previous article and full report, we believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW
or the "Company") is grossly overvalued. Our research indicates that growth will become
incrementally more challenging, as much of the 'low-hanging fruit' (i.e. BMC's dissatisfied
customers) has already been captured, the limited ITSM market size places a ceiling on
the Company's revenue potential, and SaaS alternatives to NOW emerge in the ever-
changing ITSM sector. Should revenue growth continue to slow, we think that investors
will begin to recommit themselves to a more sober valuation, given ServiceNow's current
$5bn market capitalization versus $239m of 2012E revenue.


Our concern with NOW's stock price appears shared. Two weeks ago, ServiceNow's early
investors began selling NOW shares well ahead of their original lock-up schedule.
ServiceNow's June 2012 IPO Prospectus disclosed a lock-up agreement that prevented
insider sales until December 26th. But on November 9th, six weeks ahead of the original
lock-up expiration, ServiceNow waived these lock-up commitments and allowed insiders
(primarily JMI Equity, a 50% shareholder) to sell 14.2m shares at $28.00 (Nov 15th
Prospectus, Nov 20th Press Release). That equates to approximately $400 million worth
of NOW shares that were dumped on the public markets by insiders.


In addition to the large insider share sale, ServiceNow itself diluted existing shareholders
with the issuance of 1.9m new shares (Nov 20th Press Release). We question the
intentions of this dilutive offering since the Company already had $256.5m of cash as of

Q3 (10-Q), seemingly more than enough to fund organic growth. We think the capital raise
was a sign that management itself believed the stock was overvalued, and wanted to raise
capital at inflated prices before the stock price declined to more rational levels.


This combination of insider sales and fresh equity fundraising activity could encourage
investors to shift their attention towards grounded fundamental analysis rather than the
amorphous hype that currently envelops the stock.


Growth has Slowed since NOW was Priced at $10.20 in February 2012


Just nine months ago (February 21st), NOW sold 2.45m shares at $10.20/share to
Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm (page 70 of Nov 15th Prospectus). Greylock's
investment has appreciated from $10.20/share in February to $32/share today for an
annualized return of over 200%. Yet, between February 2012 and today, NOW's revenue
growth has declined materially. The Company was growing revenue at 21% sequentially
when the $10.20/share investment was first made. Today, NOW is only growing revenue
at 9% sequentially, based on guidance in the Q3 earnings report, yet the stock has
appreciated to over $30/share.


Sources: NOW's IPO Prospectus, Nov 15th Prospectus, Reuters, and Q3 earnings report.


This trend is not sustainable. In fact, NOW shares fell 12% after its Q3 earnings report
when it announced sequential Q3 growth slowed to 13%. Should the Company continue to
decelerate in 2013, we expect NOW's valuation to quickly revert to a valuation multiple
more in line with its peers.


Precedent Transactions Show that a Buyout is Unrealistic at this Price Level

Some investors may disregard ServiceNow's nosebleed valuation multiples, arguing that
the Company might one day be a takeover target. This thesis, while highly speculative, is
probably the result of a few widely publicized SaaS deals such as SAP's $3.5bn
acquisition of SuccessFactors, an HR management firm. Yet, SuccessFactors had LTM
revenue of $292 million in the quarter prior to its buyout (see 10-K and 10-Q here), which
infers an EV/LTM revenue multiple of 12x. This itself is extraordinarily rich acquisition
price, and numerous analysts including S&P criticized SAP for overpaying, but that
multiple is still nearly half of NOW's current 22x EV/LTM revenue valuation multiple. Prior
to the acquisition, SuccessFactors had grown revenue by 55% over the last twelve
months. Since the multiple paid should be related to growth, let's apply this relationship to
NOW's growth to compute a theoretical buyout price. In the chart below, we provide
valuation multiples of selected precedent transactions in the SaaS space. Other deals
used in our analysis include Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) $1.9bn acquisition of Taleo, IBM's
$440m acquisition of DemandTec, and Oracle's $1.6bn acquisition of RightNow.


Sources: 10-K/10-Q filings (Taleo, DemandTec, SuccessFactors, RightNow) and
Bloomberg consensus estimates.


In the final column above, we've compared LTM revenue multiples vs. growth rates over
the same period. Using the average of the two highest-growth deals (these are most
comparable to NOW's growth), the figure of 4.98x tells us that for every 5% of growth, a
SaaS buyout can be awarded one turn of revenue. Using this logic, then a growth rate of
30% would be worth a 6x LTM revenue multiple, 40% would translate to 8x, and so on.


We can use the 5% rule-of-thumb to approximate ServiceNow's 'M&A' value under various
growth scenarios. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has guided to a revenue
range of $69 - $71m. If we use the mid-point of that range ($70m), ServiceNow will grow
by about 8.8% QoQ or 45% on an annualized basis. If we charitably assume that NOW
beats this guidance and grows at 50% through 2013, this translates to an LTM revenue
multiple of 10x. As shown below, this equates to a NOW 'M&A' price of only $17.50/share.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1042731-servicenow-insiders-dumping-shares-indicates-overvaluation 4/10


In our opinion, the M&A upside scenario does not exist for ServiceNow at its current price
level.


As a final point, we do not believe that ServiceNow is an attractive acquisition target at its
current share price due to the limited market size of the ITSM sector. Whereas
SuccessFactors, Taleo and RightNow addressed large market opportunities, NOW's end
market is more restricted in comparison.


NOW Insiders Sold Shares Ahead of Original Lock-up Expiration


Beyond our very genuine valuation concerns, we think that the hasty sale of 14.2m shares
by insiders ahead of an originally disclosed lock-up date betrays a lack of confidence in
the stock. According to ServiceNow's IPO prospectus, the vast majority of its shareholders
were originally subject to a 180-day lock-up. As a group, these holders represented 106.2
million common shares, or roughly 87% of the outstanding common stock as of the IPO. A
remaining 2.5m shares were subject to a lock-up until February 21, 2013. But just as
investors were leaving their desks for the weekend on November 9th, ServiceNow filed an
amended S-1 to push forward their first share sale by over a month.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1042731-servicenow-insiders-dumping-shares-indicates-overvaluation 5/10


This sudden modification of the lock-up structure does not inspire investor confidence.
Investors should ask themselves: why were insiders so eager to sell $400 million of NOW
shares that they could not wait another month for their lockup to expire. After all, JMI first
invested in ServiceNow in 2005 - after 7 years of backing NOW, what's the big deal about
waiting another 40 days? Our interpretation is that JMI and other insiders know full well
that NOW is wildly overvalued and its shares are unlikely to remain at current prices much
longer. As such, we believe these insiders were so eager to cash out that they could not
even wait until December 26th to sell down their stakes.


NOW Continues to Dilute its Existing Shareholders


While the secondary offering that closed on November 20th was predominantly used as a
conduit to allow insiders to sell their shares before the lockup expiration, the equity
offering also raised new capital for ServiceNow. Specifically, NOW sold 1.9m newly issued
stock at $28/share, or more precisely, $26.88 after the underwriting discount, which
equates to about $49.9m in proceeds (pg 30 of Nov 15th prospectus).


We believe that this freshly dilutive equity issuance is yet more evidence that ServiceNow
is highly overvalued. ServiceNow hardly needs the newly raised capital. As of its Q3
quarter-end, the Company had $256.5m of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.
Over the last nine months, the Company's cash flow from operations minus capital
expenditures has been roughly breakeven (10-Q Q3 2012). Given the large cash balance
and the fact that NOW is not burning cash at a material level, it seems that the cash was
not raised for any near-term business purpose. Rather, we believe that management
viewed NOW's stock as overvalued and wished to raise capital at an inflated valuation
before the share price declined to a more realistic level. The offering suggests that
management believes that NOW stock is rich even at $26.88.


A Final Way to Examine Valuation


When we compare NOW's valuation multiple to other disruptive SaaS providers, many of
which we believe are highly overvalued themselves, it sticks out as an outlier. For
instance, NOW's CY12E and CY13E revenue multiples are double those of RP, ET or
CRM.


Yet, long holders may argue that NOW has brighter growth prospects, so as a final
analysis, let's examine NOW's expected growth from now to 2015, and consider the
company's valuation multiple based on those 2015 figures.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1042731-servicenow-insiders-dumping-shares-indicates-overvaluation 6/10


Analysts currently estimate 2014E and 2015E revenue for NOW to be $525m and $662m.
We find this hard to believe given the recent revenue growth deceleration trends. In Q4
2012, the company forecasts sequential revenue growth to be 9%. If we assume 9%
sequential revenue growth in 2013, 7.5% sequential growth in 2014 and 6% sequential
growth in 2015, which equate to 47%, 36% and 29% overall annual sales growth rates in
2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, we only get to $615m of 2015 revenue, not $660m.


Of course, this assumes that NOW executes on its growth targets. We believe this is a tall
order, given the material revenue growth deceleration experienced in the past few
quarters. Given its limited market opportunity, the high switching costs between product
offerings, and the regular entry of competing products, we believe that ServiceNow's 7% -
10% sequential quarterly growth is unsustainable. Also, as we discussed in our previous
report, we believe that NOW's addressable IT Help Desk market is only $1.5bn - $2bn.
Going further, Gartner predicts that only 50% of IT companies will move to a SaaS model
by 2015. This cuts NOW's addressable market in half. Should we accept the consensus
scenario that NOW captures over half of this $1bn addressable SaaS IT Help Desk market
in just two years, we believe that at that point, NOW would have significantly limited
additional growth opportunities.


Yet even if NOW does achieve analyst targets, the stock still trades at 7.5x 2015E
revenue. In comparison, salesforce.com is projected to grow 34% in the twelve months
ending January 31, 2013, and yet it only trades at 7.5x revenue today. So if we assume
NOW should trade at 7.5x revenue in 2015, which equates to the current ~$32 stock price,
and discount that back by a 15% discount rate to today, we get to a stock price of only
$21.


Conclusion


No matter how much one believes in ServiceNow's product and management's ability to
execute, the stock itself appears highly overvalued by almost any metric. Revenue growth
has slowed sequentially in each of the first three quarters in 2012, yet NOW's stock price
has risen from $10.20 in February (Greylock transaction) to $32.63 today. This inversely
proportionate relationship between growth and value is simply unsustainable. Once
investors come to terms with NOW's limited growth prospects, NOW shares could quickly
fall from their stratospheric 20x 2012E revenue multiple to one more in-line with their ITSM
and SaaS peers. Investors seeking a buyout similar to SuccessFactors or Taleo will also
most likely be disappointed. The revenue multiples of these deals suggest that NOW
would be lucky to earn a 10x LTM revenue price, implying a ~50% drop from the current
share price.

This value discrepancy hasn't escaped the attention of insiders. These shareholders
appear to have circumvented NOW's original December 26th lock-up date by six weeks to
unload 14.2m shares at a post-fee price of $26.88/share (Nov 15th prospectus). We
wouldn't be surprised to see even more discounted share offerings hit the market in the
coming months.

This is old news - they changed the schedule spread out the lockup dates and avoid a single date with many eligible
shares. This makes way more sense. It does not mean everyone will sell either. This company is growing like mad.
For the past 4 quarters, subscription revenue is increasing on a quarterly basis, not declining.

So you make money when the stock price goes down, then you write a story with the sole purpose of driving down the
stock value. Why would anyone take you seriously?


From reading this article, you clearly don't understand the market ServiceNow is addressing. The revenue to market
cap is large, but the upside is enormous for this company.

This is the author's second article within a month on Servicenow. If at first you don't succeed...hmmm.


They had plenty of demand for the shares on the secondary. Also, the insiders did not even come close to "dumping"
their shares as indicated. Of the few people that sold, they still hold the majority of their positions. If they liquidated
their entire positions that might cause for alarm, but that was clearly not the case. There is nothing wrong with taking
some money off the table. You can't expect them to hold every single share indefinitely...serious...


Servicenow has won numerous industry awards and continues to do so. The pace at which they add customers and
grow subscription revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is astounding. Business is seriously booming for these
guys. Not too many companies see their revenues nearly double on an annual basis since their inception. This is not
some ailing company by any stretch as painted in the author's reports. These guys are just getting started now that
they are public. I'm not sure if he has something personal against the success of these guys but it sure seems that
way, because there are WAY better candidates to short out there.

(Full disclosure: my fund is also short ServiceNOW.)


Groupon was also the fastest growing company a year ago. I don't think investors should base their assessments on
growth, but on the value of that growth. And the price is definitely at least 2x overvalued right now.


I'm sure ServiceNOW continues to build value for society everyday, and thus is continuously increasing the intrinsic
value of the company. That's great for everybody -- both society and ServiceNOW. I hope they keep growing their
business and grow their delivery of that value to society.


But 50% of the current stock price more than accounts for that excellent value -- the other 50% of the price is just
over-charging new investors in the stock market. Even with the amazing growth, its stock price has far outpaced the
intrinsic value of both present value and future growth. From a "fairness" point of view, investors/mutual funds who are
blindly "indexing" into the market are getting ripped off at its current price.

I think the problem for many cloud companies now is that frankly, the cloud is no longer new.


Up until this year, many established players were simply sitting on thier haunches when companies like CRM, NOW,
DWRE, N, etc raced past them, with new cloud SaaS type offerings.


The real problem now is that the existing players are HUGE companies and they are all responding with similar
offerings now.

These offerings can be argued to be better or worse than any particular example, but the space is getting far, far more
crowded than it has been in the past two years.


Worse the established players have the financial werewithal to catch up to and copy any smaller players offerings.
This has largely either happened or is in the process of happening.


Personally, I do not see how the past two years growth rates in really any small cloud company will be repeatable due
to crowding in the entire Saas ecosystem and the total lack of a barrier to entry.


Given that most of these companies valuations are predicated on multiples of revenues (I will dispense with
discussions of something as old school as basic profitability) in periods several years forward, and they are all priced
for that multi year ramp to go not well but perfectly, I see why shorts are attacking NOW and others.


Now priced at 10$ would offer enough of a buffer to the future and doubts about competitiors or market size, to make
it a rather attractive long IMO. At 15$, I would think it rather fairly priced given its impressive track record, despite the
doubts. But at 29$ I cannot really understand the outlook here....

In my experience, most shorts always have these super unrealistic price predictions. "It's going to get cut in half", "it's
2X overvalued"...scare tactics or wishful thinking, you decide. The stock is worth what the majority of investors feel it's
worth. They have only gained more recognition & credibility, added more sales people, added more customers, and
are continuously make improvements to their offerings. The case for short is weak here.


Show me other public companies that have seen the same annual revenue growth. The only ones that come close
are mostly SaaS players, and even most of them do not have the same growth trajectory as Servicenow. This is why
they command a premium. Different types of companies command different valuations. Once all of the new sales
folks establish their pipelines and become productive in 2013, the growth rate will further increase. It's a natural cycle.


Servicenow Q3 YoY growth = 87%


Now let's look at Servicenow's closest competitor BMC: 
Q3 YoY for License revenue for Enterprise Service Management (ESM) was -11%! You read that right, minus 11
percent.


HP is in shambles, software revenue was actually up 18% YoY but that increase was solely due to their Autonomy
acquisition. Without that buffer, they'd be DEEP in the negative. Most CIO's have an exit strategy to move away from
HP, or their job is likely at stake.


Computer Associates (CA): Last quarter revenues were -4%! Another one in the negative.


IBM saw an increase of 1.4% YoY in software.


So there you have it, after a looking at Servicenow's main competition, you can see why investors are willing to pay a
premium here. No one else even really comes close.

Hm, interesting. Just 4 comments so far on SA by "Aleksander" - and all are extremely bullish on NOW.
Anyway. 
You sound that you know that industry way better than I will ever know it. So from that angle I can't argue with
your assessment. BUT: I do know pretty much about valuations - of growth stocks, value stocks turnarounds
etc. And the thing is, even if NOW were to exceed analysts' bullish expectations, the stock remains way
overpriced. You can always justify any stock price with seemingly unlimited and everlasting growth. Trouble is,
it never really happens. The moment revenue growth slows down considerably for all to see is the moment
when profits and free cash flows start to matter. And by those metrics, stocks like NOW, CRM or WDAY, heck,
even AMZN, will look extremely expensive a few years out, even if they were to achieve all of their revenue
growth targets.  
The way they rearranged the lock-up schedule speaks volumes and is a very big red flag. No, this is not
about taking "some chips off the table" This is about cashing out big time as fast as possible. And , it's not
investors, who buy the stock at these prices. It's all speculators, retail and institutional. For the difference to
investors, see the definitions put forward by Benjamin Graham. they are as valid as they have ever been. 
I have seen this movie before (1997-2000) when all these fancy dot.com and TMT-stocks were the darlings of
speculators small and large. And boy, did they laugh at me back then when I pointed out the absurd
valuations of yhoo, aol, jnpr and the likes. Nobody of them laughed anymore come 2003. Today we have the
exact same playbook with SaaS and cloud-computing. Reasonable growth expectations (of subscribers, that
is), but silly dreams of revenues and profits 5 or 10 years from now. Maybe the cloud-bubble lasts a year
longer from now, or even two. But it will implode as all bubbles ultimately do.

closed at 30.19. It's now doubled to 60.72.
