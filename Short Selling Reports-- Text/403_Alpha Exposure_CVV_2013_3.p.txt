CVD Equipment - Exposing The Truth On The Graphene Hype
Sep. 10, 2013 2:13 AM ET111 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


As we stated in our first article (here), we don't believe that CVD Equipment
(NASDAQ:CVV) has unique capabilities in graphene. Instead, investors should look past
the graphene hype and focus instead on CVD's rapidly declining backlog, revenues, and
profitability in order to value the company. Interestingly, CVD Equipment came out and
essentially corroborated our claims in a press release (here), and that is just one of the
many reasons we believe CVD is a compelling short and have a price target of $5.


Nevertheless, we wanted to share our extensive due diligence on CVV's graphene
capabilities, which made us conclude emphatically that CVV has no unique capabilities in
graphene and should be shorted aggressively.


Joint IP Development Agreement with Pre-Development, Lab Stage Start Up


CVV recently signed and touted a "Joint Intellectual Property Development Agreement"
with Graphene Batteries AS. While the press release (here) is positive and sounds
exciting, it contains very little information about Graphene Batteries. Our due diligence
unveiled that Graphene Batteries is a newly formed startup that is less than one and a half
years old, comprised of only 3 people, and, so far, Graphene Batteries' only source of
funding is a $1 million grant from the Norwegian government, which may have run out
already.


To see how undeveloped Graphene Batteries is, one only needs to visit the website
(here), which only has 7 total pages and contains little substance, such a research papers,
information about R&D accomplishments, and an overview of its product development
milestones.


Moreover, Graphene Batteries only has 3 development stage products, none of which
have progressed beyond lab scale. This means they are years away and face significant
challenges to ever see the light of day.


CVD's Graphene Equipment Can Be Purchased From Dozens Of Others


As part of our due diligence, we also consulted with a leader in the graphene space. The
consultant was emphatic that CVD Equipment has no proprietary graphene know-how.
First, the acronym "CVD" stands for "chemical vapor deposition." Put simply, CVD

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1683122-cvd-equipment-exposing-the-truth-on-the-graphene-hype 2/37


Equipment sells chemical vapor deposition equipment, which we found can be purchased
from at least 42 other manufacturers, as seen here.


Specifically, what CVD Equipment sells for graphene is a tube-shaped furnace that
deposits a layer of graphene onto a surface using heat. The same exact product is also
sold by much larger and better competitively advantaged public companies such as
Aixtron (OTCPK:AIXXF) and Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), as well as leading private
players such as Moorfield (here) and MTI Corporation (here).


CVD's furnace is a commoditized product that one can purchase from dozens of
manufacturers. This further explains why CVD has such low commodity-like margins.


Insignificant Patent Portfolio and Less Than 5 PhD's


In our first article, we also touched upon CVD's insignificant patent and IP portfolio, which
CVD carried on their balance sheet at a cost of $18,287 and $23,327.


We searched for CVD's patent portfolio on the United States Patent and Trademark Office
website and found only 3 patents. One can find CVD's patents by searching for "CVD
Equipment" under Assignee Name. The results can be found here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1683122-cvd-equipment-exposing-the-truth-on-the-graphene-hype 3/37


Two of the patents are from 1985 and 2003, which is well before graphene entered the
mainstream in 2010, and are about an automatic valve shut-off system (unrelated to
graphene!) and a compartmentalized oven (again, unrelated to graphene!). The 3rd patent
concerns a high-throughput chemical vapor deposition system, which, as we showed
above, is manufactured by dozens of other companies and has little to do with graphene
in particular.


Why does CVD have no patents? The obvious answer is because CVD has no intellectual
property, as explained in our first write up (here) where we highlight CVD's miniscule R&D
spending. But why does CVD spend so little on R&D? Based on our diligence, as of June
30th, we believe CVD does not have more than 5 employees with PhDs on their payroll
currently and may have as few as 2. While our due diligence has been exhaustive, we
may be wrong on this figure. If CVD wishes, the Company can clarify the number of
employees it has with PhD's. Nevertheless, this is not indicative of deep know-how about
an emerging technology such as graphene.


Conclusion - CVD's Graphene Hype is All Smoke and Mirrors


We have done extensive due diligence on CVD and believe investors should be wary
about the Company's promises on graphene development. It is all hype. Instead, investors
should be alarmed by CVD's rapidly declining backlog, revenues, and negative cash flows.

CVD is a compelling short, and we have set a price target of $5 based on its historic
earnings, which is a generous valuation for a company that has since turned unprofitable
and is now shrinking.


Disclosure: I am short CVV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company

Battery and ultracapacitor electrodes are traditionally made with at least one polymeric binder material that
mechanically holds the various, powder like, raw materials together. In addition to increasing the electrode resistance,
the binder is assumed to be at least partially responsible for the performance degradation over time for rechargeable
Lithium batteries.


We present here for the first time, by example of a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based cathode, a novel lithium battery
electrode design manufactured with CVD Equipment Corporation’s proprietary NanoToMacro™ platform technology
that facilitates a binder-free approach. Preliminary tests, done by Graphene Batteries AS, show that between 0.2 and
5C rates this binder less cathode has a similar specific capacity versus charge/discharge rate performance as the
standard cathodes. Results of still ongoing more detailed studies will show if such a novel battery electrode
manufacturing design can actually be used to delay the degradation of lithium batteries charging performance over
increased numbers of charge/discharge cycles. In addition, we will present test results for 2-4 times thicker than
normal (60 µm) thick cathode electrodes, which we expect will allow to significantly increase the volume and/or weight
based energy density of lithium battery design.

I guess all these multi million dollar contracts from some of the largest companies in the world are all smoke in
mirrors?


What you fail to realize is that you cant patent this equipment, but its does require customization for each use, which
is CVVs specialty. You cant buy this expensive equipment off the shelf and the majority of other companies that you
listed do not sell the exact same things. There are variations for different materials, uses, sizes, etc. CVV (through its
subsidiaries) has a long standing NAME in the Nano industry and its just beginning to grow.


Also, CVV makes a LOT more than the few products that you mentioned. They have hundreds, if not thousand of
products and what about the growth of the raw materials side of the business that have recently prepared for?
Graphene demand will strip what all of these small suppliers can handle in the near future in my opinion.


What about the Graphene systems they just sold, along with the other contract signed and expected to be signed in
the near future?


Read close and you will see why the shorts have been acting so desperate lately, contracts are coming. From the
8/14 release.

“Issues associated with moving into our expanded facility are now behind us. As painful as it has been for everyone
involved, this was a required step to enable future growth opportunities. Our employees as well as the customers,
suppliers, and shareholders that have visited our new facility see our potential. We are convinced that our new 2X
larger facility is a turning point for the Company that will enable us to generate higher sustainable growth rates.


“I will now try to give some insight into our potential future and thoughts behind the relocation.


“In our September 7, 2010 press release we announced receiving an order in excess of $2.5 million from a large
aviation component supplier for CVD coating systems. In our May 7, 2012 press release we announced receiving a
multi-million dollar design only order from a major aviation components manufacturer to design a custom CVD system
solution for their next generation of composite products. I am happy to announce we just received an initial $1 million
follow-on order to commence manufacturing on some portions of a much larger system and we anticipate that
additional multi-million dollar portions will be awarded in the near term.


“Earlier this year, we delivered a next generation production CVD system to a major medical manufacturer for
coatings on implants. The unit is operational and meeting the enhanced system production requirements. We
anticipate follow on multiple production system orders later this year.


“In addition we also received orders for two large Graphene systems – one for a square 300mm substrate and the
other for a round 200mm substrate. Our application laboratory is playing an important part in our ability to deliver next
generation equipment that meets the evolving needs of this growing material area. Our expanded application
laboratory now enables us to work with an increasing selected customer base in the fields of Nanotubes, Nanowires,
Graphene, TCO coatings and other deposition requirements. If you have not looked recently at our Website where our
conference presentations are published, I urge you to do so. You will be able to see some of the directions we are
headed into with the intent of advancing these nano materials into large volume, value added products.


“Our First Nano research equipment and CVD custom production solution products will now benefit from our ability to
meet volume requirements, provide custom CVD solutions with faster deliveries and do this for a larger customer
base.


“Our quotation level continues to grow each year and we anticipate that 2013 will demonstrate we have a very bright
future. Our ability to work with more customers to solve their process issues by defining, designing and manufacturing
equipment and material needed to meet their production needs adds sustainable low risk growth.”

How many semi equipment suppliers are there that make billions from unpatented custom equipment?


How many oil/gas service companies are there that build and sell unpatented custom equipment? There are
THOUSANDS of companies, all making a lot of money


CVV is preparing themselves to capture a large share of the mega future carbon industry. They dont need to be the
only company selling equipment to see massive growth, they just need to be ready to meet demand, as they have
recently prepared for.


And the fact that they are super protective of the share structure is a strong indication as to how they run the

This is a strong short squeeze play. They are trapped, there is no way they can cover with such low sell side volume,
hence this opinion piece trying to scare people out. A tight float with contract news coming (per the CEO in the 8/14

As i relayed in the comment section of the other two CVV short articles you wrote in the past week, the majority of
their IP/patents are licensed through universities, small business startups, technology transfers and more. From their

All IP related transactions of a publicly traded company such as licenses MUST be publicly announced. CVD

And as they claim on the 10-K, value of their IP is close to zero. Hope they did not lie to IRS :-)

About Stainless Design Concepts (SDC)


Download Corporate Profile Brochure pdf


In December of 1998 CVD Equipment Corporation, AMEX (CVV) purchased all assets of Stainless Design
Corp., both tangible and intangible, including all of the intellectual property. This new company, STAINLESS
DESIGN CONCEPTS (SDC), now operates as a division of CVD Equipment Corporation. While CVD is a
manufacturer of chemical vapor deposition and other custom/research equipment for the semiconductor
industry, SDC made its’ mark as a technology driven manufacturer of Ultra High Purity (UHP ) gas and
chemical delivery systems for state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication processes. SDC operates out of a
25,000 ft2 facility fitted with over 4,000 ft2 of Class 10 and Class 100 clean room manufacturing and
laboratory space. These areas are tooled with over $1 Million in support and analytical equipment. With a
clear understanding of how instrumental process support equipment has become to next generation
microchip production, SDC offers complete gas and chemical delivery product lines ranging “From the Fab to
the Lab”. SDC is uniquely positioned for growth through global sales to major semiconductor, optoelectronic,
optical fiber, OEM as well as research, laboratory and University.


SDC is headquartered in Saugerties, New York, about two hours north of New York City. SDC has a
reputation for utilizing innovation and technology to produce a complete line of gas and chemical
management systems delivering QUALITY directly to the semiconductor wafer. Spawned from a small field
construction office, SDC has burgeoned into an influential equipment manufacturer with sales in excess of
$160 Million since its’ inception. This one time “field construction office” has evolved into the company’s Field
Operations Department, holding a pulse on technology, trends and opportunities while providing a TURNKEY
capability enjoyed by few in our niche. Customers now recognize SDC’s gas management systems and
application specific chemical systems among the most advanced available. What differentiates SDC from the
competition is its’ intimate understanding of the point-of-use process applications, having designed and built
complex process gas systems for the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturers and End
Users such as: Texas Instruments, Lucent/Agere, Applied Materials, Motorola, Intel, IBM, Lam Research,
Novellus, SVG, Tokyo Electron, Di-Nippon Screen, The Chinese Ministry of Electronics, Semitool, Emcore,
and many more.

"MULTI" = 1 or 2 million dollars. Average revenue of First Nano is about 1-2.5 Million dollar per year. Read 10-

It was smart to buy a company at low price. On the other hand no valuable IP have been transferred. $2M per

Now that the relocation is complete they will start to grow dramatically in multiple divisions in my opinion.


Ive done my DD and so did the analyst that upgraded them this AM. Time will tell, but short term i think the
shorts get squeezed for a significant gain. Buyers just keep snatching up shares, unlike i have seen in a long
time with CVV.


Are you going to jump in and make some money on the squeeze, or just continue to watch us make money?

I am an intuitive investor with much success and along with the fundamentals I invest partially on gut feeling. So far
this has worked very well for me. But with these articles (maybe written in good faith?) I have a strong feeling there's
a touch of dissembling prose here. Motivation for dissemblance is usually pro-short. My gut feeling for this company is
an extremely good, strong future with much growth potential. Buy long.

10 Sep 2013, 09:53 AM


InvestorWisdom
Lets be clear, your prediction was a long term collapse of the company, not just weak Q3 numbers.


Your very first line in Article #1 read:


"We believe CVD Equipment Corporation (CVV) is a compelling short and faces an imminent and substantial
collapse."


You also insinuated that they compete with Apple, etc, which is just hilarious. When did Apple start making
Nano production equipments and why is Apples main manufacturer (Foxconn) listed on CVVs site as a
customer? lol: http://bit.ly/17xeuvp


I still haven't seen a retraction/correction to this blatantly misleading insinuation:


"In addition, a recent WSJ article (here) states that large multi-billion dollar companies like Apple
(http://bit.ly/pFSoX2), Lockheed Martin (http://bit.ly/ps1Fod), and BASF (http://bit.ly/1b1XLna) are investing
heavy resources into developing graphene applications and filing thousands of patents all related to
graphene. The notion that CVD can compete with companies like these is preposterous."


Those product patents will become future sales for CVV (and other companies) as they try to bring them to
market. This is opportunity, not competition. Still stand behind your claim?

Apple makes consumer products, not production equipment for building their products. None of their patents

Apple patents point to slimmer battery tech


By Marko Spasenovic on June 4, 2013


Graphene, the wonder material whose glittering array of electrical and thermal properties won its discoverers
a Nobel prize in 2010, could soon be helping Apple’s iPhones and iPads pack more power.


The company has filed a US patent application (2013/0136966) on a graphene-based heat sink for the lithium
batteries and circuit boards in its tablets and smartphones.


Graphene is a form of carbon that comes in sheets one-atom thick, with its atoms arranged in a honeycomb
lattice. It is 10 times better at conducting heat than graphite, which is often used as a heat sink in mobile
gadgets.


But in order to adequately cool a battery, a graphite coating is typically 30 micrometres thick. That eats up
space within the gadget enclosure that could be used for a bigger battery, explains inventor Ramesh
Bhardwaj of Fremont, California, in Apple’s patent application.


By coating a polypropylene battery casing with graphene, he says, the heat sink can occupy a fraction of the
space of the graphite version for the same heat dissipation – allowing for a bigger, longer-lasting battery to be
installed.

Author’s reply »  CVV makes low-value furnaces. One of the things that can come out of one of these
furnaces is graphene. It's a commodity - low value add - and CVV is therefore unlikely to be a long-term
beneficiary of graphene except they might sell a few extra furnaces. Whop dee doo. Tech companies like
Apple and IBM are doing the basic research with graphene that will lead to big future profits. So CVV doesn't
compete with them - it can't - and that's why CVV is unlikely to prosper from Graphene. In fact, CVV's
shareholders can only wish that the company had the ability to compete with Apple and IBM in the basic
research. Then CVV might have a hope of prospering from graphene. Do you understand now?

Really, this is your reply? lol You still dont fully grasp what this company does.


Yes, CVV has systems that create Graphene and OTHER nano materials, but you are just scratching the
surface. Regardless of how the commodity is created initially, you still need equipment to work with and apply
it. Is Apple, IBM, etc going to become an equipment manufacturer and develop/manufacture their own
application equipment, or is it more likely that they will do what they always do and purchase from suppliers
that are more focused and skilled in Nano materials? Apple and IBM might be very talented companies, but
they dont develop and build their own manufacturing equipment, sorry. They have a hard enough time trying
to keep up with the development and incorporation of new consumer technology.


You provided no PROOF in your reply. Its just a slick way to get around admitting that you are wrong and they
do not compete with each other.


Remember, the people that made the shovels and picks are the ones that did the best during the early gold
rush days, not the miners. CVV makes the shovels and picks needed to work with Graphene and with
thousands of manufacturers, tech companies, contractors, engineers, etc in nearly ever sector, out there
looking for ways to incorporate graphene into their products, most all of them have no clue where to begin,
but thanks to CVV they have a place to turn for CUSTOM start to finish "turnkey" Engineered solutions, for
their specific Nano needs.


CVV is quite possibly the only company in the Nano materials sector that can fulfill this need, currently. They
claim that they are and i have yet to find another company that proves them wrong.

InvestorWisdom
" In fact, CVV's shareholders can only wish that the company had the ability to compete with Apple and IBM in

No, i wish for Apple and IBM to continue integrating Nano materials into their products, because it creates a
larger demand for what CVV provides.

@Alpha Exposure.


You made your point in your first article. Since you're short this stock, it's just rediculous to write another 'story' in such
short notice after the first one. This looks like you wrote this (again?) in order to create negative bias on this stock to
profit yourself.


----


I'm long and will stay long. CVD is about a lot more than graphene, and besides that, cashflow analysis alone on a
company that is trying to establish itself in a possible future game changing market (nano, graphene, power supply,
research, etc.) is not sufficient enough. There are deffinitely risks, but the returns on a 10 year horizon can be huge.
Cashflow analysis do not reflect the potentials in companies like this for the far future. As I've stated before, this is not
Apple or MacDonalds for that matter...


I beleive in nano and graphene for the power industry and chip and transhumanism trends that are developing as we
speak. The new UAV technology for the chip industry will be added with elements of graphene within the next 5 years
I think.


You believe in a future potential or not, but to base it on classic fundamentals alone seems a bit to narrow for me.


I'll keep my longs and will add when backlog improves and add more if there is trending improvement.


The future can bring us a graphene nanotubes based pillar right beyond our atmosphere and will be able to lift a
rocket/spaceshuttle into space so there is no resistance when they start their rockets. That way we will use
substantially less fuel and can explore space more deeply...


Think about that. This is technology you believe in or not, but you cannot value something like that with traditional
valuation models.


Nanobots in your blood circulation that will track down bad cells and destroy them before they grow as a cancer...


Humans will engage in anything that they possibly can. Justout of curiousity alone :-) Whatever we discover, we will
deploy. Simple human nature...

million lost, they cant afford it moving any higher


Notice how he always states "we" believe in blah blah blah. Their hedge fund is trapped and doing whatever
they can to get out before the market realizes CVV is coming out of the down cycle. The numbers (during the
relocation) are the most advantageous for the shorts to use. Looking at the potential future growth, is not in
their best financial interest

He has a point with the back log, but as I've stated before: you cannot invest in companies like this that are
trying to enter high tech - high risk - high potential markets with possible insane future growth by using
traditional financials measures alone. The risk is always there that companies like these will not survive, but
the ones that WILL survive could have incredible growth potential. This could be one of them... (or not)

You may well be right, but you are far too early to the short party, which suggests you are an amateur.
Professional shorts initiate positions when the stock goes parabolic with accompanying high volume. You
must have initiated your short in the $10 range. Not a smart move. Look at what a positive announcement did
to FSLR, TSLA, and NFLX. They are up 500% in a matter of months. CVV has far fewer shares in the float.
With a First Solar deal, this stock could spike to 50 in short order (excuse the pun). You wouldn't want to be
left holding the bag.


Face it, your desperate short attempt to rattle the cages has failed. The stock closed strong today. That
signals longs aren't buying the short story. It's time for you to cover and go long. Then if you want to short
after it goes parabolic, that's your call.

CVVs sales have mostly been to small scale R/D type research, but this is changing as Nano materials leave the lab
and enter the mass production market. THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW SECTOR and CVV is positioned to grow with it,
due to being one of the few (if not the only one) that actually makes COMPLETE "turn key" Nano production systems
(customized for the specific use) all under one roof, for most any Nano material. Or, they can just sell you the raw
materials and you can use whatever production method you like.


There is no company large enough to meet all of the future demand imo, this is why CVV relocated right after finishing
most of the backlog. Capacity was maxed, due to almost 100% year over year growth. The quarterly numbers were at
record levels. Do your research, CVV only needs a small slice of this market to see tremendous growth.

@ Seeking Alpha


You're talking about your due dilligence and talking about the meaning of CVD and that there are a lot more
companies that can provide CVD equipment. And that they (CVD Eq. Corp.) are not about graphene AT ALL.

Keep your shorts. If you're right on the short term you'll win money and I'll be stacking up if back logs improve in the
future quarters. If not, I lose money I've already written off (as one should when investing). My game has a long term
horizon with these kind of companies.


You're second 'story' has a poor underlying statement and to talk about your 'due dilligence' seems a bit odd to me, to

Investors who believe back logs will improve 'dramatically' within just one quarter could be wrong. This will take 3 to 4

We just need to see some growth momentum to get the markets excited again. Speculation goes a long way
in a bull market and this low float cant take much buying at these levels. The shorts are the ones creating the
supply, which is super risky. The company is already positioned for major growth without having to dilute the
float.


Its much safer to short when a company is diluting and exhausting buyers, thus influencing a downtrend. Not
when the float is growing tighter and the company is relatively well financed/clean.

CVV has higher volume now and the shorts are losing control, if i can counter with some honest DD and help
the longs win, i will.


Ignore me.

InvestorWisdom. Might I suggest you right your own detailed and well-researched and heavily diligence article
on CVV? You might find it more productive than clogging the comment section of these articles? Heck you
can even pocket a penny per page view.


I wouldn't lead off with "there are worse companies trading at more than $70 million" as an investment thesis
though. Just a suggestion.


I may short CVV. I think the author has raised very real issues and has backed up his comments. It's hard to
participate in hot new bleeding-edge research areas without actually doing any research or securing any IP.


I also find it comical that the company killed it's revenue on purpose because of a facilities move (while
aggressively hiring sales people to do what, not get deals?).


Red flags galore. Caveat emptor.


10 Sep 2013, 01:17 PM


InvestorWisdom
Heres my reply from the other article when you made the same claims about hiring sales people 
------------ 
Again, they make MANY products, in MANY different categories. They could not sell EVERYTHING (during
the move), but were still able to sell $22,000,000 worth of product over that period, which is their 2nd best
year in their history.


Their growth BEFORE the move had maxed their capacity for larger scale stuff, but they are still able to sell
smaller add on equipment, services, materials, parts, etc to new and existing customers, which requires sales
people, right? They did not COMPLETELY shut down, the larger sales force was probably a big step towards
being able to maintain decent sales during the period.


You are narrowly focusing on single pieces of info without taking everything into account. 
----------------------...


For made-to-order specialty manufacturing companies like this, the Engineers are the ones who quote on the
large custom contracts, not sales people, especially ones that were just hired. You need someone with the
ability to read blueprint, calculate raw material prices, time, etc.


Im sure the company Engineers have to work with their customers Engineers constantly and have a complete
understanding of the complexity and requirements involve with each contract. One bid thats too low can cost
the company a ton of money. They cant rely on salespeople for this.

Sales people handle routine phone calls and orders, like replacement parts, materials sales, etc which can be
done by anyone, even during a move. They dont have the skill to quote complex engineering projects that
require custom modifications. They are just a middle man in the process.

Besides that:


If Q3 back log doesn't improve impressively, he (Alpha Exposure) could be right in his 'short call' for the short term as
investors will recognize his analysis.


That's when I buy a bit more with a longer term horizon. It's all about your horizon...


As I've stated: Back Log improvement will take a lot longer than just one quarter... 3 to 4 at least...


I Hope you can bare that (possible) 'heat' InvestorWisdom... :-)


10 Sep 2013, 01:05 PM


InvestorWisdom
He might be right about Q3, im not debating that. Im debating the future of this company. The grand scheme


Its his prediction of $5.00 ($30,000,000 market cap) which is way off base in my opinion. Penny stocks with
just a shred of hope trade at those levels, not a clean/responsible, well positioned big board stock like this.


I feel the negatives are factored in at this valuation and very little of the potential is. Am i wrong for thinking
this way?


10 Sep 2013, 01:24 PM


Willem - Netherlands
The future of the stock price will tell who is right or wrong. Our investment horizon is different I think.


If Q3 isn't seeing improvement, he could be right short term is all I say. Can you handle the (possible) heat?
You're so cought up in your own 'right'...


10 Sep 2013, 01:35 PM


InvestorWisdom
I have never claimed that Q3 would be a strong quarter. I said i expect contracts being announced soon (per
the 8/14 news release). I feel this would be bullish for the long term outlook, BEYOND the next report. The
market looks ahead, if given a good reason too.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1683122-cvd-equipment-exposing-the-truth-on-the-graphene-hype 26/37


Look at the daily volume compared to the past, its not trading like it use to. You better hope these buyers are not
locking up the supply in this range before they squeeze the shorts. Could be painful. Its not going to be easy to cover
that much of the float while buyers keep coming in on each dip and the company isn't diluting.


Being in a bull market makes this short trade even more dangerous. Any stock can spike for big gains, at any time,
regardless of the companies health. The word "graphene" in their literature could make this run again at any time, due
to a news release, etc. Not many public companies pop up under a graphene Google search, but CVV sure does.


There are far safer stocks to short, but thats just my experienced opinion.

Not a big investor........I like to look at new technologies and create a theoretical framwork as to how to apply these
new technologies to both preexisting and current technologies .For example ( taking a new battery with a nano
technology and intergrating it into a pacemaker so that it can last for more years) Not a great example, because
pacemakers can also be made better themselves.......But you get the idea,,,,,,,, The main theme is to intergrate and
apply new products to old products!

@alpha exposures - The company Graphene Batteries which has partnered with CVV was awarded twice what you
stated in your article. Their website says, "Graphene Batteries was awarded a competitive grant from Research
Council of Norway as part of the ENERGIX program. The $2M project in collaboration with Institute for Energy
Technology will support development of Silicon/graphene composite materials for high energy lithium-ion batteries."


Graphene Batteries also won the first prize at the IESE Cleantech Venture Forum 2013 in Barcelona.

Binder-Free battery electrodes


Download Binder-Free battery elecrodes abstract for the 2013 MRS Fall Meeting pdf


Karlheinz Strobl¹, Rune Wendelbo², Rahul Fotedar², Riju Shinghal¹, and Mathieu Monville¹ 
¹CVD Equipment Corporation, 355 S. Technology Drive, Central Islip, New York 11722, USA 
²Graphene Batteries AS, Forskningsveien 1, 0314 Oslo, Norway


Battery and ultracapacitor electrodes are traditionally made with at least one polymeric binder material that
mechanically holds the various, powder like, raw materials together. In addition to increasing the electrode
resistance, the binder is assumed to be at least partially responsible for the performance degradation over
time for rechargeable Lithium batteries.


We present here for the first time, by example of a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based cathode, a novel
lithium battery electrode design manufactured with CVD Equipment Corporation’s proprietary NanoToMacro™
platform technology that facilitates a binder-free approach. Preliminary tests, done by Graphene Batteries AS,
show that between 0.2 and 5C rates this binder less cathode has a similar specific capacity versus
charge/discharge rate performance as the standard cathodes. Results of still ongoing more detailed studies
will show if such a novel battery electrode manufacturing design can actually be used to delay the
degradation of lithium batteries charging performance over increased numbers of charge/discharge cycles. In
addition, we will present test results for 2-4 times thicker than normal (60 µm) thick cathode electrodes, which
we expect will allow to significantly increase the volume and/or weight based energy density of lithium battery
design.

CVV was upgraded this morning. All of these articles are starting to have a reverse effect and I believe will lead to a
massive short squeeze starting today. Here is the upgrade :

Some are taking notice and preparing to squeeze the shorts here. How much can this super low float take? $16 will
look cheap when this starts moving with momentum. The shorts have played their card, now its time for the bulls


Time for some REAL analysts to take over.

(Updated - September 11, 2013 8:17 AM EDT)


Northland Capital Markets initiates coverage on CVD Equipment (NASDAQ: http://bit.ly/1e0Z0CJ) with an Outperform.
PT $16.00.


Analyst Colin Rusch comments, "We view CVD Equipment Corporation (http://bit.ly/1e0Z0CJ) as the global leader in
custom CVD and a play on increased adoption of CVD for expanding industrial applications. We believe the company
is leveraging its wide-spread relationships across the global research community and extensive experience into
opportunities significantly larger than it has previously experienced."

TEWeber
I agree with others that this article comes across as somewhat desperate to support a short. Let's look at each of your
claims.


"Joint IP Development Agreement with Pre-Development, Lab Stage Start Up"


Yes, we all know that Graphene is in early days and any companies or ventures that purely play on graphene are
risky and small. Thank you for highlighting this fact in a demeaning way.


"CVD's Graphene Equipment Can Be Purchased From Dozens Of Others"


Yes, very true. This is the reason I also own shares of AIXG who plays in the CVD for graphene research space.
Percentage-wise CVD is much more of a pure play on graphene than any of their competitors. If you want to bet on
CVD for graphene, then this is the best spot to do so, though we can clearly argue or disagree about whether the
price is right.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1683122-cvd-equipment-exposing-the-truth-on-the-graphene-hype 29/37


Their IP is limited, but that's a strategic choice made because CVD stands to benefit from partnering with others, not
competing with them. They have access to specialist knowledge and the IP of others which they manage by non-
disclosure agreements. They actually spell this strategy out in their 10-K very near where you got your IP figures from.
It's interesting you left that out because I'm surprised if you missed it and it was brought up in the comments of your
last post.


I agree that they won't be able to compete with the likes of IBM and Apple on the application side, but they're focused
on the production side and focused on partnering, not competing. If CVD graphene is the future (which by all accounts
it is likely to be for only limited applications at the moment) then this is the most obvious company that would stand to
benefit as they have positioned themselves as CVD graphene and CVD nano experts.


You don't need a PHD to weld and wire things, so I don't think more than 10-15% of the company needs to be PHDs,
which is 3-5 if I remember their employee count of c30 correctly. They definitely need engineers, welders, machinists,
and wirers as well as PHDs to deliver their products.


"Conclusion - CVD's Graphene Hype is All Smoke and Mirrors"


The main fact here is declining sales, backlog, and cashflow which are definitely causes for concern and come
directly from not getting new orders. When they had high sales they had positive cashflow and earnings depite being
constrained by two smaller-than-needed locations. If sales get back to that same peak level, they'll be quite profitable
due to their new efficiency, and I think you'd see the stock price climb c50% as some of that growth is already priced
in. The stock is down over the last 18 months because sales have been weaker than expected, but there was some
expected cyclical weakness already considered.


This is a very cyclical industry, and like any cyclical business it's foolish to look at the last 18 months to predict the
next 18 months.


The real conclusion - The current trading price builds in expected sales recovery as well as potential for CVD to profit
directly from being an early-mover and pure-play in the CVD graphene space. Your valuation considers both of these
prospects as worthless or unlikely.

Stating that they both deal with Graphene and since Apple is bigger they will crush CVV, is extremely poor
research. You are comparing two entirely different sectors/applications and cant even defend it with sound
research when challenged.


Or how about your claim that CVV doesn't sell production equipment, only lab equipment, even though i have
proven your claim false without a doubt, using company literature?


Did you see the upgrade today? Why no comments? Could those analysts be doing better research than
you? lol Is it time to write a new article (#4) rehashing the same claims?

His point was that companies pouring millions and millions of dollars into R&D and creating intellectual

Once again im calling BS. Apples patent doesn't come close to what CVD does. Apple builds consumer products, not
production equipment. Just because someone uses aluminum in their product and has a patent on its design, does
not mean they compete with the companies that sell the aluminum, lathes, punch presses, etc used to create the end
product. Think!


Nice try, but you answered nothing. Read about Apples Heat Sink Graphene patent (posted above) and explain to me
how it will "crush" CVV whom supplies the tools/equipment used to build that product?


CVVs customers invest the millions in R/D (sometimes in CVVs Application Lab: http://bit.ly/15QdFQA ) and when
they want to turn that research into an end product, they contract an EXPERIENCED pioneer like CVV to help them
get it done. CVV provides a CUSTOM "turnkey" solution for all their Nano production needs. Not many companies
posses the internal knowledge needed to work with Nano materials, its a relatively new sector.

CVV is the best public company for multiple areas of exposure to Graphene, at this time. Alpha exposures
and the rest of the shorts are in serious trouble. They were wrong about the last Q numbers and the next Q is
expected to show a massive increase in revs, per the CEO. The shorts will be fueling a major move to new all
time highs soon.


Check out the breakout on the charts

That monthly chart indicates that 2014 will be very bullish for this stock. Notice the last time the Monthly
MACD crossed like this, it climbed hundreds of percent over the following 12 months.


CVV has consolidated that major move and now its ready for the next major leg.

You would short this in the face of explosive growth? Not wise. Most of the shorts are still in this and they are
trapped at a loss: http://bit.ly/1gdxYIW


Going long is the wise trade, before the masses figure out whats coming. Read close:


Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated:


“With building issues now behind us we have turned our attention toward increasing backlog, revenue and
profitability. Except for the write down with the solar customer above I am pleased with the Company’s
performance in the 3rd quarter.


“Our order levels for the first six weeks of the 4th quarter are only a small indication of what we expect in the
near term. Although typically we do not give out guidance other than advising on our quotation levels, I
believe that to so restrict my comments at this time would not be in the best interests of our shareholders.
Therefore, I am at this time announcing our forecast that order levels for the 4th quarter 2013 are expected to
exceed $12M.


“The Company is also well positioned in a number of major areas that we believe will prove beneficial for the
long term growth: 1) Our sales of research systems to universities, research laboratories and start-up
companies are increasing; 2) Our sales of Chemical Vapor Deposition systems to industrial customers for
current limited production needs are increasing. We anticipate that some of these sales will lead to future
sales of to meet the larger scale production requirements of these customers; 3) Advanced Industrial
Manufacturing systems sold to industrial customers for large scale production is increasing, 4) We anticipate
in 2014 a significant increase in sales thru our wholly owned subsidiary, CVD Materials Corporation, which
provides material coating services for industrial applications; and 5) Our Application Laboratory, where we

Im glad you did not take the authors advice and did the DD. The shorts are stuck at a major loss and there is
still not much selling. CVV should climb in 2014 and beyond. The major growth is just beginning and the
squeeze has not even begun.  
--- 
They've inked $21+ million in orders over the past 4 months, which is the most they have ever done over a 4
month period. This puts them on pace to double+ their best year.  
------ 
What a horrible prediction: "Yes - it's not a meaningful order - I still expect that the company will see a decline
in orders and backlog for the foreseeable future. My price target remains $5 per share. I will post an update or
new article after earnings. "

Anyone still out there on CVV? When this article was written, the stock was about $11. Now it's $11.14. Are they into
anything "big" these days? Any breakthroughs on the horizon?


Are they selling to semiconductor manufacturers? Memory is getting huge. Does anyone know if they are selling to
Micron, Samsung, etc in any significant way?
