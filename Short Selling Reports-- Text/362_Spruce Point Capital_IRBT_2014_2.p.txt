iRobot Corp.: Competitive Pressures And Recent China Channel
Checks Reinforce Downside Risk

Executive Summary


In May 2014 we published a report on iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) entitled “iRobot: About to
Short-Circuit,” in which we warned investors that the company is being hyped and
promoted as a must own stock to play a ‘robotics revolution,’ when in fact it appears to just
be a maturing consumer product company under significant competitive pressures. We
also warned investors that iRobot appears to be using aggressive accounting gimmicks to
mask its deteriorating financial condition, and deflecting investor attention to its “valuable
intellectual property” and “growth opportunities in China,” while insiders relentlessly sell
stock at each opportunity. Since the publication of our initial report, there have been
material developments that strengthen our conviction in the short case. In our opinion,
iRobot’s Q2’14 earnings released on July 22  show further indications of financial strain,
and place the company at an escalated risk of missing its full year financial targets,
despite the company reaffirming its full year guidance. We believe iRobot is pinning its
future, and investors’ hopes, on its ability to grow home robot sales in China. However, our
recent visit and channel checks in China left us with significant doubts of its ability to
succeed in a rapidly saturating Chinese marketplace.

Proclaiming that it was pleased with its Q2 results that ‘met expectations’ and that home
robot sales grew by double digit percentages, iRobot seemingly had a good quarter.
iRobot went further on to raise modestly the low end of its full year revenue guidance,
“driven by home robot growth of 18-20%.” However, upon closer inspection of the quarter,
we found significant concerns about its earnings quality, and question its ability to hit its
full year revenue and EPS guidance of $555–$566m and $1.10-$1.20, respectively.
iRobot’s headline quarterly EPS of $0.28c met Wall Street estimates. However, after
reviewing its 10Q SEC filing released 10 days after its glowing press release, it appears its
financials were again aided by two more “one-time” adjustments. We warned investors
previously about the company’s repeated and surreptitious use of non-recurring gains to
bolster financial results. According to page 18 of the 10Q:


“During the three month period ended June 28, 2014, we recorded a net benefit to
revenue and income before income taxes of $1.2 million and $2.6 million,
respectively, related to adjustments to our product returns reserves, compared to a
net benefit to revenue and income before income taxes of $3.5 million related to
adjustments to our product returns reserves during the three month period ended
June 29, 2013. The adjustments recorded in both periods resulted from lower
product returns experience.


Additionally, we released $2.1 million of valuation allowance related to certain tax
attributes of Evolution Robotics, Inc. during the three month period ended June 28,
2014, compared to the release of $2.7 million of certain income tax reserves due to
favorable conclusions of the IRS examination of our income tax returns for the years
2008, 2009 and 2010 during the three month period ended June 29, 2013.”


We estimate these adjustments added approximately $0.09c of earnings benefit year-to-
date. Accordingly, we estimate iRobot’s adjusted sales and EPS year-to-date to be
$252.8m and $0.37c, respectively. The company provided its Q3’14 outlook, which calls
for a deceleration of quarterly revenue and earnings – a big disappointment to Wall Street.
We note that iRobot did not cut its full year outlook. This implies that iRobot will
have to show explosive Q4 sales and earnings growth of approximately 30% just to
hit its full year guidance. We estimate iRobot will have to a produce a clean $173m and
$0.44c in Q4’14 (at the midpoint) to hit full year numbers.

What on earth can the company do to hit these targets? It seems unlikely that its new
Roomba 880 will bridge the revenue gap. The new 880 model is still competing with
excess inventory of older models. For example, iRobot recently promoted on its website a
“Labor Day Sale,” and offered incentives to purchase Roomba 650 and 770 models! Also,
a recent visit to a local Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) revealed the Roomba 770 and 650 being
promoted right next to another struggling consumer product company – SodaStream
(NASDAQ:SODA)! Furthermore, investors shouldn’t bet on iRobot’s other products such
as the Braava and Scooba to pick up the sales slack. On its last earnings call, the
company admitted that they “still have some work to do as far as clarifying some of the
message and differentiation in the marketplace on Scooba and Braava.” Our interpretation
of this statement is, “Scooba and Braava aren’t selling!” Perhaps a 10,000 foot view of the
dire situation can be seen from iRobot’s days in inventory, and days sales outstanding,
both of which remain elevated near all-time highs, and provide evidence of significant
unsold inventory in the channel.

Overall, we believe the company will be significantly challenged to hit its financial targets
in the face of both declining home robot margins and increasing competition. In the charts
below, we show that home robot gross margins plunged in Q2’14 to a yearly low of 48.8%.
Along with declining defense margins, total company gross margins have also sagged to a
low of 44.4%.


We also have warned investors about the material difference between iRobot’s GAAP net
income and its cash flow from operations (“CFO”). We believe large departures between
these financials are a strong indicator of low earnings quality, and may be an early
warning signal that investors should heed carefully. We have compared iRobot’s two
most recent cash flow statements to isolate the change in the recent Q2 quarter. In the
table below, we observe that iRobot reported $8.5m of net income, but consumed $0.2m
of cash flow, for a difference of $8.7m. Year-to-date, the departure is even more stunning;
iRobot has reported $13.8m of net income, but consumed almost $8m of cash, for a
difference of $21.8m! While the bulls might be content trumpeting iRobot’s great sales and
earnings, we’ll quickly point out that its cash balance has fallen by $17.7m year-to-date.
It’s also worth noting that despite announcing a $50m share repurchase program on April
2 , the company has still not repurchased a single share!nd

Do Not Bet on the China Growth Story


“Home Robots growth will be driven by further penetration of long time overseas
markets, coupled with expansion in China and wider distribution of the Roomba 800,
Scooba 450 and Braava. Overall we expect home robots to grow 17% to 20% in
2014.” - iRobot Earnings Call


With having openly acknowledged challenges in its military robot business, iRobot’s back
seems to be up against a wall, and it has been left with only one real alternative –
transform itself into a consumer marketing machine to sell vacuum cleaners. Our
conclusion is supported by the company’s recent announcement to recruit a new board
member with a background in consumer marketing, as well as its own financial decisions,
which show a large surge in sales and marketing expense. In the most recent quarter, the
company’s sales and marketing margin surged to a multiyear high of 16.8%, while its
research and development expense margin dropped to 11.8% over the same period.
Underinvestment in R&D is a worrisome development for a technology company that
could hinder future growth through new product development.

While consumer sales in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe have been
struggling, iRobot has pinned its hopes on Asia, and China in particular, as a fertile ground
to increase market share and penetration. Commenting on the China opportunity and why
it is bullish during a recent earnings conference call:


“China is the only region in the world where iRobot was not first to market and that is
exciting because it means we don’t have to go and build the market all ourselves.
We saw significant growth in 2013 where we have entered and started taking
substantial market share from the players that were in China prior to our rolling out
and expansion of our product line in China and we see every indication of that
continuing to be the case. So we’re still enjoying high growth percentages because
of a relatively small base but there is a general appreciation for robot vacuuming in
china already and we’re able to leverage that.”


To investigate iRobot’s opportunity firsthand, we recently visited China and spoke with
sales people at Suning, Gome and Sundan - three of the country’s largest electronics
retailers. We walked away with the firm belief that iRobot may not have to build the market
in China as it claims, but it certainly has to explain to the Chinese consumer why it should
pay a substantial premium for its products in an already extremely competitive and
cluttered Chinese marketplace! The overwhelming feeling we received was that
iRobot’s products are a tough sell to the consumer because of the extremely high
product price point. To illustrate, we’ve shown the most current Roomba model 780
available at Suning and Gome, each being offered at RMB 8,490 (US$ 1,380) and RMB
8,890 (US$ 1,445), respectively. To put these prices in perspective, the monthly minimum
wage in China is approximately RMB 1,820 (US$ 290) and the average annual private

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2469345-irobot-corp-competitive-pressures-and-recent-china-channel-checks-reinforce-downside-risk 7/50


sector wage was RMB 28,752 (US$ 4,755) according to a recent study. In other words,
to make the highly discretionary decision to purchase the latest Roomba would
require approximately 3 months of wages (25% of annual income!) for your average
Chinese consumer…not exactly a trivial decision to splurge on a Roomba!


Chinese consumers aren’t exactly stupid either, and assuming they do want to purchase a
home vacuum robot, can easily shop around for a better deal! We found plenty of
competitive products sitting on the shelves next to iRobot at each of these three retailers
such as Phillips, Midea, Ecovacs, FMart, Samsung, Lexy-iSmart, Mazuba and Whirlpool.
On the low end, the Whirlpool and Mazuba models retail for RMB 1,600 (US$ 260), while
the Ecovacs 600 series ranged from RMB 1,860–3,980 (US$ 300–650). On the high end,
the Samsung Navibot was offered at Sundan for RMB 7490 (US$ 1,218). If iRobot is trying
to position itself as the Lamborghini of robotic vacuums, then Samsung’s model is equally
a Ferrari and gives iRobot some competition at the super high end.


Regardless, Chinese consumers are savvy and can do better than going into a store and
paying the retail offer price. Internet shopping is a global phenomenon and provides even
more alternatives and substantially lower prices! For example, a quick search of Alibaba
reveals that China has 79,343 suppliers of robotic vacuums at prices well under $100!
There is also a popular website called Taobao.com where middlemen can facilitate the
purchase of iRobot products at significant discounts to the retail prices. For example, we
found a Roomba 780 offered at RMB 6,383 (B$1,038). Below are current offerings at both
Alibaba and Gome.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2469345-irobot-corp-competitive-pressures-and-recent-china-channel-checks-reinforce-downside-risk 8/50


Another big macro factor working against iRobot is that average home sizes in Hong Kong
and China are among the smallest in the world according to a recent study. With on
average 3 people living in a home size of 161 – 215 sqft, the value proposition of investing
$500-$1,500 for an iRobot branded vacuum is an extremely difficult sell!


Despite our realistic and sober view that China will be a tough market for iRobot to
succeed, the company sees reason for unbridled optimism, and claims the market is still
young and fertile! According to a recent earnings conference call,


“…again we’re early days in China. We see a long and very positive growth runway
ahead of us. There is plenty of comparable premium consumer electronic goods
stories which show very, very substantial success where China has become one of
the top global markets for those premium consumer products. So again that gives
me more confidence that we are in fact early days and we do have a very positive
runway for many years in front of us and should anticipate China growing into one of
our major marketplaces.”

There is currently speculation in the marketplace that Dyson intends to announce a new
robotic vacuum cleaner on September 4 . Dyson recently released a video (viewable
here), which previews its new product release. We warned investors in our first report that
Dyson has been tinkering with robotic vacuums, and that increasing competition would not
bode well for iRobot. Dyson reportedly has revenues of $2 billion and extraordinary profits
of $600 million, easily dwarfing iRobot’s size and profitability. The bulls seem to believe
that Dyson’s entry validates the robotic vacuum market, but we believe this is just a
cognitive bias putting wishful thinking on a clearly negative outcome.


We believe it’s always best to see what insiders are doing to glean their views on the
share price. In our first report, we pointed out that insiders now own less than 5% of the
company, down from almost 60% in 2005. Since May 2014, insiders have continued to
unload shares at levels higher than the current share price. For certain bulls that believe
iRobot is a “takeover target,” we question why management would persistently sell stock.


Don’t Be a Fool and Outsmart the Street: Avoid iRobot’s Stock


Despite overwhelming evidence of low quality earnings, underinvestment in R&D, an uphill
battle to grow in China, and mounting competition, there is still a cadre of bulls that make
claims (often supported with no hard evidence) that iRobot is leading a ‘robotics
revolution’ and a must buy stock. Articles on sites such as Motley Fool tell investors “Don’t
Fret Over iRobot’s Mixed Results” while The Street says “iRobot’s Selloff is an Opportunity
to Buy Shares on the Cheap.” We believe iRobot’s shares are richly valued on unrealistic
growth expectations that are at high risk of disappointing investors. Furthermore, for
investors buying into the hope that iRobot has substantial hidden value in its IP portfolio,
we are still waiting for the company to show evidence or a plan for a monetization
strategy. We believe iRobot is a sub $20 stock, and should be viewed as mature

Ben, I like most things you said. However, the timing that you publish your article is always tricky. Always when IRBT
is around $31. Shall we speculate you will cover again at this price?


We all know what happened when you published your first article. The stock went right up from $30 to $40 in a little
more than a month. I actually appreciate your last article. I sold my IRBT at $38 and shorted it above $40 and covered
at $32.


Overall, I wish you change your timing a little bit, so your article will be more like a leading indicator rather than a
lagging indicator. The readers will appreciate you more as well.

Based on a couple of online reviews from an amazon equivalent website? It appears Ben actually went to
China and talked to retailers, rather than spending a few minutes reading online reviews.

No based on my talks to employees at both shops. Saturn and MediaMarkt have also physical stores. Saturn
and MediaMarkt are the biggest electronics outlets in Europe. You can (almost) find everything there.

The best way to valuate I-Robot is on it's book value ! Because I-Robot has very little goodwill it's balance sheet is
very clean and tangible asset heavy. At a price to book valuation of 2.6 I-Robot is very cheap especially considering I-
Robot's book value has more than quadrupled in ten years. The trend is for I-Robot's book value to increase by leaps
and bounds every year.


A short's only hope is to make a 100% gain on a bankruptcy but the upside to I-Robot is virtually limitless. I-Robot is
going to be a disaster for short traders who have to rely on fear tactics and not reality.

The problem here is Dyson doesn't need to "Kill the Roomba." It only needs to take enough incremental share
to slow down IRBT's growth rate. I disagree with Jimmy - tech companies aren't valued on book, they are
valued on growth. Piecing together bits from the latest quarter shows non-880 units actually had contracting
sales - so all of the incremental growth came from the 880, which is now going to compete against a product
with real brand cache. That doesn't mean IRBT is a zero, but it makes justifying paying 38x TTM EPS tough.

I have a regular Dyson vacuum and it doesn't suck and I mean that literally. I don't know what they have in
their demonstrator models but the vacuum sent doesn't have it. The advertisement for their plant and
production line in a color brochure of eight pages, while the instructions for the vacuum was a fold out with
cartoon characters. Got my Hoover back that I had loaned to a friend. 
Don't trust the company that can be such scam artists.

Yes, judge the company by a single sample and ignore the last 15-years of data which shows Dyson has
dominant share in the high-end vacuum market.

Tales From The Future, Contributor
Thank you, interesting article.


I have a question to the author or other readers: How do you see the IRBT outlook in other sectors (defense,
commercial...) since this article focuses on the home consumer.


I see that defense is only around 10% of total revenues at the moment and the home robot business makes up for the
bulk of IRBT sales.


Do you maybe see the company shifting again towards commercial/military robots in the future (for example, if the
expansion into Asia doesn't work as planned or price pressures in established Western markets increase)?


04 Sep 2014, 11:22 AM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
IRBT has been a failure in sectors other than home. It keeps teasing us with remote presence, but its current
products/pricing are not attractive at all for sizable demands.


Its defense sector is losing market share quickly. The decline there is way beyond the impact from US
defense budget cut.


These are the principle reasons why I am not a buyer anymore.

Tales From The Future, Contributor
Thanks, it's really hard to find interesting pure-play robotic companies that are publicly listed.


PS: It will be interesting to see the sales of Softbank's robot in 2015 ( Pepper: http://bit.ly/1qhf9LL ). I still see
it more like a novelty that could fade quickly after a few years like the closed Sony AIBO line. 
But in any case, Softbank is big and diversified that Pepper won't add to Softbank's bottom line.

Tales, why do you have to find a pure play robotic company? There are so many good companies out there.
IRBT's valuation is actually helped by a lot of investors like you pursing pure play robotic companies.


Another pure-play is ADEP. But it is a good stock for short rather than long this year.


04 Sep 2014, 02:42 PM


Tales From The Future, Contributor
Don't worry:) I'm not long IRBT or any other robot company at the moment because I couldn't find interesting
names yet.


I think the sector has potential in the long-run...but it could take until 2020 or later to really take off (outside of
industrial robots and a few niches in the home). Patience is needed.


PS: I was long FANUC (TYO:6954) in the past.


04 Sep 2014, 02:45 PM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
You are absolutely right. It will be a booming industry. We just have to find the company with the right
management. Companies in booming industries need capable leaders like Elon Musk. IRBT, unfortunately,
does not have very good management.

Jimmy, this is a reply to your comment, which seems to be deleted now.


I think Ben is very smart and honest with his disclosure. He said he was short as of he wrote the article, but he never
said he would not close his short position in the next 72 hours as many other short sellers typically do. His articles
create higher liquidity, which make short covering much easier. Without the article, to cover short positions, IRBT may
go up 10% instead of 4%.


Anyway, he never said you should short IRBT even at $30. Sophisticated short sellers will not short at this price level,
but naive ones may short the shares at the open and get burned now.

not to be greedy.

Unfortunately, as the price on I-Robot goes up the less we hear from Ben ! You know this is true and I fully suspect
this post to get deleted as well. It's a shame we can't challenge the authors here. But I thank Stan for pointing out the
Author's flaws and getting away with it :)

Aricool
Hey Ben and other shorts, please don't cover your shorts on IRBT. I want to buy tomorrow after I see the Dyson as a
"Roomba kill" is a complete joke! Please short more it tomorrow...


BTW, looks like my assessments re the Dyson being a non-issue were all correct. This article below confirms them all.
Even my point re its too tall. Also, confirms price will be at my upper range $1K, so so threat to Roomba at all, which
is why the shorts covered today. Also confirms what I said about US penetration being very low, so IRBT has much
more to grow there. Actually, the sexy Dyson may well validate vacuum robots to the mainstream, and end up
boosting IRBT sales to those who get turned onto the idea, but want it affordably. So, Dyson marketing may well
benefit IRBT if I'm right! I'll buy IRBT tomorrow. Hope your short buddies don't cover too fast!


See: 
http://bit.ly/1xiiU8q  
It will also carry a price tag that reportedly is at least 40% higher than the most expensive Roomba. And questions
about whether the vision technology in the 360 Eye is superior to the navigation technology in the current generation
Roomba may be a moot point, particularly as IRBT plows R&D into its next-generation navigation technology


"Dyson's entry to the market should lay to rest the view held by some that home robotic vacuums are novelty
products, a notion we've always found puzzling considering that IRBT has shipped over 10M units into the market,
with the latest 880 models selling for $700. With the home robotic vacuum market less than 20% penetrated, we
believe the market can support competition, particularly one that validates the space like a Dyson can. While it is
unrealistic to assume that IRBT is going to retain 65%-plus market share in the category longer term, we believe IRBT
can maintain a leadership position."

talk about overkill, that dumb Dyson robot vac is way too strong at picking up dirt. Only the filthy rich (clean freak
mental cases) are going to pay up to such up all those pesky 3 micron particles that keep them from sleeping at night.


see: 
http://bit.ly/1xilQSA 
The machine additionally includes proprietary technology, called Radial Root Cyclone, that allows the vacuum to pick-
up particles that are 600 times smaller than an 11-point period on your average word processing document.

Btw I think Ben made some good points and respect his view on iRobot and the robotics field. With every stock there
are bull and bear scenarios. Right now I am cash strapped, but when I have some money I will allocate some funds to
iRobot. Price levels around $30 are fair for the long term.


The company has proven that they can grow their business, but only the future is the one that counts. So looking at
what management did wrong in the past is in my opinion not a good way of investing. The question investors have to
ask themselves:


What's management going to do to run and grow iRobot's business going forward?

thanks for the analysis. it's a great point that the China's growth story is still a question mark. to my knowledge, most
of my friends in China chose to buy equivalent robot cleaners with much more reasonable price levels, even though
they make much more than the average

Author’s reply »  You are welcome. It's nice to get people thanking me for the free research I provide, instead of
criticizing


05 Sep 2014, 10:47 AM


leviek
Ben...Free research? That's a tremendous fallacy!! You obviously are oblivious to the robotic industry and iRobot in
particular. If you weren't, you would understand that the industry is morphing and will someday challenge the internet
in size.


With all due respect, Ben, what truly bothers me when I read research done by amateurs, there is very often a lot to
be desired, and many important facts and figures left out, as well as reality.


The robotics industry is branching out and evolving. What you would do is take a small sliver, dissect it, and do your
best to dissuade investors from the largest, and one of the few, pure plays in the industry.


Remote presence or mobile robotics is it's infant stage. a revolution is about to take hold. Adept Tech (ADEP) recently
announced $8 million in revenue last year from mobile robotics. IRobot is the leader, and the largest pure play robotic
company in the world. Of course they will continue to produce the Roomba, but also additional chore saving robots in
the future. They will continue to grow their defense robotics and remain a major player, but to not mention mobile
robotics only tells me your distinct lack of understanding about the field in general and iRobot in particular. I'm trying
not to be mean but, with all due respect, you are far from an analyst, and this is misleading research.


05 Sep 2014, 03:51 PM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
Leviek, for all due respect, your argument is far less convincing than Ben's. I have been both long and short
on IRBT in the past and followed it for a long time.


Nobody argues robotic industry is not going to a gigantic industry in the far future, but it doesn't mean IRBT
will enjoy the booming industry as much. No one knows what will happen to IRBT in the next few years for
sure, but we have the current information to project the future. Basically, as Ben presented, IRBT has a
mediocre management, which has no success on products other than home robot.


You said "They will continue to grow their defense robotics and remain a major player". I think you are very
confused here. They have not grown their defense robotics for years. The decline is way dramatic than the
US defense budget cut. They also show little progress on remote presence. Given this information, how can

In other words, because its a huge opportunity, we shouldn't look at the details or vehicles by which we get
there. Got it.  
ADEP did $8mm in robotics revenue last year, you say? Yes, clearly we are well on our way to "challenging

I still want to buy up cheap shares...


http://bit.ly/YiKRO6 
The Guardian newspaper says the Dyson robot will cost about 700 pounds ($1,153). It is launching first in Japan, the
world's biggest market for robotic vacuum cleaners, and will be available in the U.K. in summer 2015, the Guardian
said.


05 Sep 2014, 05:45 PM


leviek
I think many individuals reading this ridiculous synopsis of iRobot will be guided by the inherent nature of individuals
to not see the forest for the trees.


The analysis here is short-sighted and is obviously written by an individual who needs to study the art of buying
emerging growth companies, something I've done since 1964. Sorry Ben, but your analysis leaves a lot to be desired,
and it's not very refreshing to know that you will affect peoples thinking about a leading company in an emerging
growth industry that will someday dwarf the internet.


In the not-too-distant future, we will be seeing robots walking the halls of office buildings, transferring materials and
important papers through the factory floor, and walking (rolling) through hospital corridors allowing doctors to talk to
their patients remotely. These robots will go into elevators and open doors. The amount of dollars saved and workload
reduced will be exponential.


iRobot is THE PURE PLAY leader in robotics. Their patent estate dwarfs that of any company that comes in second.
Did you even begin to contemplate that?

By the way, the interviewer was so immature as to call the Roomba not by it's real name and then to say, "whatever
they call it"! What a sham and an embarrassment!! This was one of the most amateur interviews I have ever seen
and, to think, there are those on this comment board that fell for it.


Today, the only way to invest in robotics is to own iRobot, or even Adept (ADEP), especially after the two have
declined. My position as a market technician prevents me from saying these stocks should be bought right now, but
I'm talking about the long-term.  
I believe, based upon significant sentiment extremes that almost all stocks should be avoided at this time, with a likely
substantial correction into the October time frame looming. The odds of a decline in the DOW to at least 14,021-
14,198 is great, with a strong possibility of the low 13,000's being reached.


This interview and article really ticks me off, not because Ben may be proven right in the near-term, but because of it's
fallacious conclusions. In the next 3-5 years the robotics industry will become huge, if one can see the forest and
avoid amateur interviews.


05 Sep 2014, 08:36 PM


Aricool
@lev, much of what you say sounds OK, but this part is not substantiated: 
"iRobot is THE PURE PLAY leader in robotics. Their patent estate dwarfs that of any company that comes in
second. Did you even begin to contemplate that?"


I don't think their patents have helped them stop the likes of Neato as competition; however, it is possible that
their new navigation system may have IP value if it is lower cost and more effective than the Neato laser
approach. Otherwise, please explain to us with some facts about how great and valuable their patents are.


05 Sep 2014, 09:29 PM


leviek
OK, Aricool...This is an exercise in futility but as a first mover in robotics, iRobot has patents on every facet of it's
robotic platform. This is only a start:


http://bit.ly/1tedB3t


http://bit.ly/1tedB3v


While their Mobile robotic platform is protected, iRobot is always looking for developers that may use their patent
estate as a means to develop new robotic platforms. Their defense robotics platform is also very well protected, and,
Stan Ackman, just because there is a lull in defense business, the future of robotics in practically every defense
measure is extraordinary. Diversification is the key. the areas that are slowing may well be the areas that will be part
of their next growth phase.


Crazylikebudfox...your statement, with all due respect is absurd! An $8 million, first year performance for mobile
robots for Adept is huge. Your equating it to the robotic industry is somewhat naive.


Investing in emerging growth industries involves looking at the big picture. Those that have the foresight to ignore the
simple, short-term gyrations will reap the rewards. I am generally a very positive person; however, in the market, one
needs to make decisions, not based upon conjecture, not based upon hype, but based upon proven concepts.

The idea that I am very negative about the market's prospects in the next couple of months doesn't make me a
negative person, it does make the positive aspects of being there at the right time, an exciting prospect. My clients
have had a spectacular bull market run and are now protected.


Do I believe iRobot will be an outstanding stock to purchase for the next up-cycle, it doesn't need to be said. We are
likely in a 15-20 year secular bull market trend; notwithstanding the substantial potential for a decline in the next
couple of months. Protection is in order!


06 Sep 2014, 03:54 PM


Aricool
"While their Mobile robotic platform is protected" 
LOL! thanks for the links though, however, I think they make my case better than yours. If you see their patent
list per platform series, you'll notice that the the same (old) patents cover 500 series as covers the 800 series,
so not much new that is patentable. Moreover, you're just showing them suing a few players in EU, but what
about in the US? Why is Neato not being sued??? they are an identical knock off, and just added laser
navigation... I'll tell you why, b/c their base platform is not patentable, just generic. they keep their algo's as
trade secrets, so easy to knock them off, like Neato, Samsung, et. al. I call that a worthless patent portfolio for
70+% of their products...

Irobot did too bad on China market, people in China have to purchase through US channel for Irobot product with
warranty risk. I am in China, the official Irobot sales channel in China sells a three years old model with price equal to
latest model in US market. It seems to me that head of Irobot did not care about China market at all, otherwise they
should fire the head of China sales.

leviek
Aricool....I think we may be coming from different directions but will arrive at the same place.


If I thought IRBT was forever a vacuum cleaner company, I would not own it.


IRobot was founded with the idea of expansion of it's robotic platform, an expansion that will take it into a new realm
of disruptive technologies. Their goal is not to simply be a vacuum cleaner company. Give me a break!


Taking the workload of household and factory floor drudgery is just a start. New products will be produced that have
the potential to turn the company into a juggernaut in worldwide revenue for just about any robotic application. Again,
I'm talking about the forest for the trees.


Irobot today has robotic vacuum cleaners (the leader), but please look at it's future. They will dwarf the Roomba (or
whatever they call it).


Check out their website and see if iRobot can be considered a vacuum cleaning company: http://bit.ly/1CGDsaT


Anyone who thinks iRobot is a vacuum cleaning company should not be in it. The future is robotics and IRBT is part of
that future.


07 Sep 2014, 06:27 PM


Aricool
re "Anyone who thinks iRobot is a vacuum cleaning company should not be in it. " 
actually, w/ only a 20% US penetration, and virgin Yuppi markets globally, and a 60% market share, I expect
sub $500 vacuum bots can be a great biz for IRBT, for many years to come..


I expect the next big area will be in medical/hospital patient services and cleaning. Japan is a prime target
along w/ US. ADEP is targeting this one, and I expect there are MANY low hanging fruit (and learning)
opportunities for those first to market.


09 Sep 2014, 01:52 AM


leviek
BTW....iRobots merging AVA with Cisco's telepresence platform insures a huge future in the office meeting
environment. That Cisco chose iRobot's platform was not a coincidence.


I once owned a company called Webex, the leader in office collaboration, including conference meetings and remote
access to presentations and conferences. Cisco acquired Webex and is now a leader in the whole spectrum of
business collaboration and conferences. Ava will be the method of putting people in conferences remotely. The Ava
platform will also provide doctors a method of making their rounds daily with their patients remotely. The amount of
factory and office floor robots, in the future, may very well become commonplace. The two leaders in that field may
also be IRBT and ADEP.


If not iRobot or Adept, then who? Investing in emerging growth areas involves finding the leaders and growing with
them. The positive cash flows generated by iRobot and their finances will allow them to expand in those areas that will
bring them the most growth. Their leadership position, and YES, Aricool, their patent position will allow them to remain
a leader in the future booming robotics industry.

I have one question for Aricool:


Which company, or companies, would you buy if you wanted to have a stake in mobile robotics?


Maybe Google, but Google is not, and will never be, a pure play robotics company. I also doubt very much that
Google will have an interest in mobile robotics. If so, they will likely acquire either IRBT or ADEP. So, take your pick!!


07 Sep 2014, 07:34 PM


Aricool
Leviek, LOL! I was just giving you a hard time.. I've been planing to buy both for a few weeks and just bought
half positions both today, after seeing the shorts give up.


I tend to agree with all your points except I don't expect their patents to be of much value. Trust me, I know
robotics in and out, and a robo company's real competitive edge is in the tradesecret algos and know-how to
design/fab/execute robust systems which use minimum tech and most off-the-shelf. all tech solutions can be
worked around. See how Neato blundered their bot by messing up on my above list of key competencies
(which IRBT strongly demonstrates). Dyson blew it too (cost and too much tech).


BTW, I'm looking at ABB as an automation supplier, in all its forms. FMC I ignore b/c has a monotonic rise
over past 5 years, and growth rate was cut from 15% to 11%.


cheers!

So Stan Ackman....Do you really believe iRobot's defense business is dead in the water? I think someone forgot to tell
The Canadian Department of National Defence:


http://yhoo.it/1wev51H


IRobot is the cream-of-the-crop robotics company in the world today. The diversity of their product line, their pipeline
of new products, their patents and their finances bode well for a great future. Let's see where this company will be in
5-10 years!

There is no doubt in my mind that I-Robot has the makings of the next Apple. I actually think Colin Angle is probably
smarter than Steve Jobs without all the pesky personality flaws. Colin has also proven to be a shrewd businessmen.
The only complaints I hear about Colin is he is too conservative. I believe Colin's smart and methodical approach will
pay off in the long run.


But back to the article. If I-robot drops to 20 dollars or less as the author proposes I will eat my shorts. Thank you !

Ben, 
Thanks for sharing. I am actually a buyer at $30 to $33. I couldn't valuate it down to sub $20 as you projected. With
regards to China, I believe it would do injustice to analyze it based on average private sector salary. The target market
is not the average, but the above average. Of the 1 Billion plus Chinese populace, I believe more than 15% of which
earns over $15K per year. This should be the representative market. If the goal is to saturate at 5%, that's more than
50 million robotic units.


However, this is not only the growth I expect. I really am still quite optimistic about the medical market venture iRBT is
undergoing. Cisco would not have partnered with them if John Chambers saw it as no potential. Colin Angle also
mentioned about going into window cleaners, lawn mowers in the future as they expand home robotics. He also
hinted in one of the PBS video interview about barriers to entry for competitors and that large companies going into
this market may have to think about M&As rather than starting from scratch. I saw your previous articles about
discrepancies in number of patents. But have you looked into the quality of the patents? These are the growth drivers
and the kind of patents that are acquisition targets of a lot bigger companies (e.g., Google, Lockheed Martin, etc.). I
can see a defense company buying iRobot and sell the home robotics to Samsung and keeping military projects.


Good luck to both bulls and bears on this company. Hard to really predict the future of this company, but recent trends
2009 to 2014 seem to suggest iRobot is still growing and far from saturation.

pjlim3....that was a very thoughtful comment. That's the thinking of an emerging growth stock investor. We are in the
infant stage of an industry that has literally unlimited potential. IRobot has the products, the finances, the patents, and
the will to expand into new niches when they are available.


In a few years, revenues may be in the billions. Mobile robots alone may be a billion dollar industry in the next 5
years.


Good, comments, pjlim3 !!

Author’s reply »  Cisco is a $125bn company that has many partnerships, many of which routinely fail. Hinting at
other markets without a tangible road map should not add any value for shareholders. If the quality of the IP is so
good, why has the company still not presented a roadmap to monetization. Why do former iRobot employees leave to
start other robotics companies w/out having to license the technology? Your arguments hold little weight, but are big
on optimism. Good luck.

re " If the quality of the IP is so good, why has the company still not presented a roadmap to monetization.
Why do former iRobot employees leave to start other robotics companies w/out having to license the
technology?" 
are any of them copying Roomba's physical design and/or algorithms? I suspect not. Maybe you are not
aware, but patents are to protect others from copying your product and approach, not to block all other
possible ways of doing things. Did Cisco's patents block its own employees from forming JNPR and becoming
a major router competition to them? Obviously not. So, by your narrow logic, then Cisco's patents are not
"monetized" and are worthless. Well, like Cisco, IRBT's patents and trade secrets keep all competitors at a
small % of market share. That is the definition of a successful IP strategy and protection. Note that even
Neato and Dyson are non-issues for IRBT


re your article saying "While consumer sales in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe have been
struggling, iRobot has pinned its hopes on Asia, and China in particular, as a fertile ground to increase market
share and penetration." 
I don't understand your logic. That is, b/c US penetration is very low, IRBT has MUCH more to grow there.
And the sexy Dyson will most likely validate vacuum robots to the mainstream market, and end up boosting
IRBT sales to those who get turned onto the idea, but want it affordably. So, all Dyson's expensive marketing
may well benefit IRBT if I'm right.


I've taken a 50% position in IRBT near 33. I still hope the shorts have the balls and the money to drive IRBT
towards $20. That would be easy money b/c vacuum robots are going to become as ubiquitous as microwave
ovens for all those who want to keep floors always clean, yet don't want to work at $10/hr vacuuming their

If shorting comments was made when it was high $40s, I'll say good call. But shorting it from low $30s and
saying iRobot rightfully should be in the sub $20s to the teens is what I call 'big on pessimism'.


Since you said my arguments are weak (that's why I am not an SA contributor), let's review the arguments of
a hedge fund manager who's is contributing to SA: 
1. Weird accounting - just because you dislike the accounting does not mean they deserve to be shorted. 
2. Anomalous number of patents - I have said it before - have you looked at the quality of patents. You
countered on how they are monetizing this - they are selling products aren't they? and continue to improve
the product pipeline... 
3. Average Chinese can't afford - You went to China only to find this conclusion? You are looking at the wrong
Asian market segment. 
4. Dyson - which cannot crawl under beds and couches will price above $1000 (according to CNET) - really
now the high end of the high-end market 
5. Medical Market entry will fail - they just begun, why so pessimistic already 
6. Just to prove you're running out of bullets - an executive sold a few shares (less then $50K proceeds).
Really? You have to mention this too to solidify your arguments?


I review these views again and say - "big on pessimism" based on a shallow thesis. Hence, likewise - good
luck!

Ben.....your arguments hold no water. In an emerging growth industry, employees leave all the time to try and become
entrepreneurs or developers. IRobot encourages developers who use their platform to design robots. It is a plus for
everyone involved.


The future goes to those who try and iRobot will be a magnet for breakthroughs. Ben, can you only imagine what a
$125 billion company like Cisco can do to move the needle for a, yet small, but leading iRobot. Do you actually think
the size of Cisco is a detriment to their relationship?

It is the large cap, old line, technology companies that need young, fast growing companies like IRBT to help them get
a little better growth, as these are mature companies who's fast growing days are over. It was a great move to partner
with Cisco for all concerned.


You talk about roadmap, but fail to mention that iRobot has gone from a $50 million revenue company to $500 million
in short order. Do you actually think they are going to stop growing?

Just saw the video today. Still unappreciative about the argument about Chinese average income to be used to
analyze why iRobot will fail in Chinese market. How was Apple selling MacBook and iPhones in China when they
entered that market? Are there not cheaper iPhone, MacBooks alternatives and competitors out there also? Didn't the
revenues grow? Would you use the same argument? In Marketing 101, there are different market segments.
Certainly, the average Chinese is not the target - and to use this for your analysis to null iRobot's strategy is
inaccurate and unintelligent.


Nevertheless, I like Ben's efforts on driving others to agree with his short position. Great efforts in behalf of your
hedge fund stakeholders!

Ben stated, over and over again, how many channel checks he's made, including a China visit, and concluded that
iRobot will have a difficult time reaching their guidance. Also, to talk about iRobot and completely forget about the

crazylikebudfox
I've been negative on my comments on IRBT, so I'll throw myself to the wolves (in this case, lathered-up bulls).


A 14% price increase and a big top/bottom line beat is reason for celebration, I concede. I, like Ben, thought FY'14 2H
targets were tough and, given the stock's high multiple, saw more downside than upside.


While there was upside this quarter, there wasn't actually overall upside to the whole picture. Full-year revenue
guidance is unchanged. EBITDA and EPS is higher, but this is low quality. The company booked $1.5mm in return
reversals and is using a lower tax rate (30% vs 33% prior). Those two combined account for most of the EBITDA and
EPS upside. Not all, but most. These are non-recurring, low quality benefits.


On the revenue piece, 36% of sales were for the new 880. IRBT recognized revenue on a sell-in basis. As they fill the
channel with a higher priced model, they get a big sales lift. This explains why revenue growth is 2x unit growth. What
happens when the channel fill ends? Well, then you depend on organic unit growth. On that front, I note non-880 units
saw sales decline over 25%. That's not a great signal for future organic demand. Finally, receivables and inventories
days were higher - a peculiar development given the upside from pull-forward demand.


So, net-net, a great quarter for the bulls. Did the quarter's quality and guidance justify today's stock explosion? Not in
my opinion, but today I'm clearly in the minority.


22 Oct 2014, 06:35 PM


pjlim3
There's always reasons to doubt. I have read the entire transcript. CEO even spent time to talk about Dyson (20 to 30
minutes battery time - hahahaha). But knowing iRBT executive team, There may be a revenue beat and positive
surprise for 4th quarter. iRBTs excuse to analysts questions is saying 4Q numbers just got to the 3Q numbers due to
some productivity. Also there is a bottom line improvement on efficiencies. But what are their worker's going to do
4Q? They will continue to produce and beat the numbers.


So my optimism about the remote presence that Ben criticized has been even alleviated. More attention to this
segment. Defense segment also improving in terms of back logs and orders. 20% robotics for the home vacuums will
only improve when Dyson arrives in 2015. Shorts better cover now.

Please stop quoting remote presence sales. That is trivializing the enormous future for these robots. I'm talking
hundreds of millions (dollars) in a few short years. In Adept's first full year I believe they're running at $8-$12 million
annualized.


Irobot will likely take over leadership, simply based on size, but I would be a holder of both.

Author’s reply »  So let me see: iRobot's quarter was as follows: no operating cash flow after 9 months, the ability to
reverse warranties and take gains seems to have gone dry, so now they pick up one-time benefits from return
reversals. They benefited in the qtr from a pull fwd of orders. Days of Inventory and Receivables hit new highs. A
fantastic qtr all around! I encourage you all to read my report on Boulder Brands (BDBD) and observed what
happened to the stock this week when the company reported that its largest customers 'normalized inventory' - Best
of luck to you all and see you next quarter.


24 Oct 2014, 11:08 AM


leviek
I think, Ben, that it's the perspective that I have a problem with. In the last fifty years of investing in emerging growth
stocks, and my clients will attest, looking at these type of companies with a magnifying glass, and you will miss the big
picture.


Irobot is a company focusing on robotics, an industry where development of products depends upon finding those
initially that pave the way, products that can give the company a base while branching into other areas of growth. It
takes a special type of investor that can see this big picture (the forest), without cutting down the trees.


It's fairly obvious to me that you have inexperience as an emerging growth stock investor because your focus is
constantly on accounting facts. The greatest gains in the stock market are made by investors looking at the big
picture. Irobot may continue to develop new markets, such as remote presence, that likely will dwarf the Roomba, but
you will never be able to see it, because your focus is in the wrong place.


You talk about taking revenue from one quarter as a one time benefit. I'm sorry Ben, but you and I seem to be at the
far ends of the spectrum. I wish you well in your analysis, but with all respect, this is not the way to research emerging
growth companies. Unless you have the ability to look at the big picture, your type of analysis will fail if you insist on
putting emerging growth companies under a microscope.


Billionaires have been made by investors having that ability to find disruptive technologies and grow with them.

"Unless you have the ability to look at the big picture, your type of analysis will fail if you insist on putting
emerging growth companies under a microscope."


See Ben, you'll never get it like Leviek, the big picture guy, by looking at the details. For instance, here's his
"big picture" analysis on 3D Systems from Feb. when the stock was at $67.


"OK.... my assumption is approximately $7.20 EPS, on a non-gap basis when revenue hits $4.5 billion, by
2023, or: 
$12 EPS, non-gap on revenue of $7.4 billion. 
With an ongoing 15% growth rate at that time, I would expect DDD to sell for about 25 times earnings, or
somewhere between $180 and $300. 
Good luck trying to refute this!" 
http://seekingalpha.co...


DDD is "only" down 44% since he put out his "irrefutable" $180-300 PT. Those criticizing DDD's earnings
quality and lack of cash flow at the time (oh, wait, that was me in numerous SA DDD articles) are fools, even
if we've been right for the last 60 points.


24 Oct 2014, 12:23 PM


leviek
Wow! Crazylikebud............I forgot I wrote that. Thanks for reminding me.


Not that I have to defend myself, with 50 years of market experience, but you opened up a can of worms, and I'll just
have to respectfully answer your interesting comparison.


First of all, I totally stand by that statement on DDD, expecting minimum revenues of $4.5 billion in 2023, a 15%
annualized growth rate, but also including acquisitions. Next years revenue may exceed $1 billion. I purchased DDD,
as a core holding at $14.98, prior to a 3/2 split, which makes my average cost around $10. You obviously haven't had
experience as an emerging growth stock investor if you think a 44% decline in value, which still leaves me with a
350% gain, will change my opinion on DDD, or the industry. SSYS, of which I do have an investment, has been falling
behind DDD recently in DDD's relentless drive for vertical integration, as they are greatly expanding into metal printing
and have decided to become a leader in not only printers, but in materials, software, and in end user products. I will
also increase my position in XONE and have a position in ONVO, and a major position in Autodesk (ADSK), the
undisputed leader in design software. I plan on increasing my positions in the additive manufacturing (3D printing)
industry after a significant correction in the market (to 14,021-14,198, DOW) I am still expecting (that's another story).


With all due respect, my statement on DDD, first of all, has nothing to do with everything I've said here about iRobot,
but also has given me the opportunity to understand that not all investors have the stomach for investing, emerging
growth, or other types. It takes a certain foresight "crazylike" and you maybe are not that type of investor.


In 1974, I acquired a position in Wang Labs at $5.625 because they were indisputably the leader in word processors.
By 1981, Wang was selling for $860, after accounting for a large number of splits, but by then IBM decided to include
word processors in their PC's and Wang's market faded. I was lucky enough to see the changes in that industry
because it's not always easy.

In 2004, I acquired a substantial position in Intuitive Surgical at around $15, even though the company was losing
money. I saw the future in robotic surgery and believed, at the time, the market's decline that year into August, and
ISRG's drop from about twice it's price, was an outstanding chance to get in. In the next couple of quarters, Intuitive
became profitable and never looked back. (ISRG, $478).


I stand by my statements on IRBT, and their huge prospects. I am also ready to greatly increase my positions in 3D
printing. My portfolio, as well as my client's, are well hedged for a declining market environment, so drops in my
stocks are welcomed as I will have the ability to greatly increase those positions.


Thanks for bringing up a comment I made almost a year ago, and I certainly stand by it.

@lev, why do you like XONE? analyst expect it to loose $ next year, and only a 10% 5yr growth rate. At least
DDD is expected to be profitable, and w/ 20% 5yr rate. However, even DDD is super expensive w/ P/S of 6

By the way, these are but a small smattering of positions in my emerging growth stock portfolios. Don't even get me
started on biotech or alternative energy. I absolutely welcome any continuing debate on these subjects.


I will say, however, protection is in order as a significant continuing correction is highly likely. The potential is DOW
14,021-14,198, and Russell 2000, 860-880. The watchword is protection and keeping some dry powder.

I rarely need to defend myself "crazylikebud", because I understand that doing so is considered an insecurity, but I
feel you have no idea where I'm coming from, so I thought I'd give you a chance to understand.


I am basically an emerging growth stock investor, since the mid-'60s, but have spent a lifetime in developing
sentiment and technical tools, also involving chart patterns on the market. I give seminars to a substantial number of
financial advisors monthly, even though I am a financial advisor. These tools I use in order to maximize the potential in
emerging growth stocks, while also having the ability to offset market declines. An article was written in the Wall
Street Journal about some of my technical knowledge of the markets in 2005.


Do you think I need to defend myself?

Aricool...I like ExOne (XONE) because they are involved in one of the faster areas of 3D growth, metal printers. This
may be one of the most likely sought after companies by the bigger players, Hewlett Packard, or even DDD, and
SSYS. DDD just increased their cash available by an additional $150 million even though they had a robust
$500-$600 million stash. I wouldn't be too surprise, especially after the decline in XONE stock, an offer to acquire
XONE may take place. One of the fastest growth areas of 3D printing will be in metals, the true industrial revolution.
DDD knows what they are doing, and analyst's are sometimes clueless, as I've had a lot of experience with that, over
the years. I'm not putting down anything Stratasys is doing because they did get a big jump into the consumer and
business markets with Makerbot, I was surprised DDD allowed that one to go to them. I do have investments in
SSYS, also. I bought Autodesk a long time ago, even well before they were considered a top 3D software company,
just lucky, I guess.


Also, don't underestimate the future of robotics, as I believe robots in the future will be printed on 3D printing
platforms. The future of robotics and 3D printing will dwarf the internet. Someday, many of the mundane things
humans just don't want to do, time consuming and wasteful, will go to robots.  One of the most exciting areas, near-
term, will be in the remote presence mobile robot platform. Owning IRBT and ADEP is essential if one wants to be
involved in that exciting area.

Stan Ackman, Contributor
leviek, I agree with you that emerging companies should not be examined with a magnifying glasses. I also agree with
you look at them at big picture level. However, the history tells us emerging industries do not necessarily reward early
starters. The key of success is a outstanding management.


While I agree you that Ben paid too much attention to details in IRBT, a few details do show that IRBT's management
is not as capable as many think. As we all know, emerging industries are highly dynamic. Companies need to
frequently make vital decisions. If IRBT has a more creditable management, I would keep my IRBT shares, which I
sold around $40.


I also disagree with your argument that. Investing in pure plays of emerging industries is necessarily the good way to
invest. Again, the winners of emerging industries are not necessarily the early pure public companies.


31 Oct 2014, 09:42 AM


leviek
Stan...I definitely understand the perils of investing in emerging growth: however, there are moments in a corporations
early life when you can tell the chances of being the, or even a, leader, is easier to figure. There aren't any
guarantees, obviously, but iRobot has already reached the size, the scale, the technology, and the patents to allow
theselves a currently leading position as a pure play robotics company. The competition will likely come from some
big guys, like Google, but no one company will dominate robotics, so the growth potential is outstanding.

leviek, I agree. IRBT does have the size, scale, and the patents. We just have to wonder why it could not
grow faster. After more than a year ownership on the stock, I figure the reason is the management is just
mediocre. Colin Angle has the first mover advantage, but he never fully capitalize on that potential. He and
his team failed to put things together, reflecting the internal inefficiency.


For now, the company can go either way. If it is lucky, Colin Angle can sell the company at a good price for an
early retirement. If it is unlucky, we have him hanging around for years to quietly let competitors catch up.


So, I have a rather neutral opinion on IRBT now. That's how I traded it. After I sold my shares above $40, I
shorted around $40 and covered at $32. I think at around $30, the risk/reward is so bad for short sellers while
at above $40, it is the other way.

Yes, Stan, but iRobot has had to deal with it's initial thrust, selling vacuum cleaners. I'm not  saying they didn't do the
right thing because getting the industry off the ground involves finding those avenues of strength and going with it.


Expansion into more exciting areas, once you're a leader, becomes easier. They now have the knowledge, the assets,
the patents, and the cash flow to start branching out into more exciting and dynamic areas, such as the remote
presence mobile platform.


If I thought iRobot was forever a vacuum cleaning company, I would have dumped it years ago. They are a robotic
company and will expand into areas substantially more growth oriented. I'm not talking about short-term gyrations, not
interested. Growth may begin to accelerate once they discover the rapid growth areas of robotics and attack those
areas.

I think Ben forgets to look at the larger picture. Revenue for I-Robot has gone from 94 million to 600 million in ten
years. Book value has also increased 500 percent in the same time period. We also need to acknowledge that IRobot
has no debt and a future that is brighter than it's past. Will it be the next Apple ? maybe ….

Ben....you can't possibly be an emerging growth stock investor. It takes a lot of foresight. Buy IRBT and ADEP on dips
in this likely declining market year and you will reap the rewards as the industry expands, and eventually explodes. As
I've said before, we are only skimming the surface. Any analyst that jumps on a bandwagon because of a couple of
earning's reports always (always) misses the big picture.  
Ben, "from here on out" is a long lonely time. I would hope that someday you will see the light.


05 Feb 2015, 10:29 PM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
I am still with Ben's general idea. The timing is still wrong if a short is initiated at low $30.


Leviek, BEN may not be an emerging growth stock investor, but I am. My experience told me both IRBT and DDD,
both of which you like, are just OK companies. They should always have their own place in these emerging industries.
But the mediocrity of their management prevents them from big runs.

I agree with you Ben. Colin Angel lacks the sharp vision needed for a successful emerging company. His
strategies are all over the map but lack the depth. Also, as you pointed out, the internal management of the
company is also not ideal for the company to grow quickly.

Investing in the market is a moving target. Based upon my opinion of the current technical aspects, I'm expecting a
move in the DOW to the 14,021-14,198 level this year. The four pillars of the market, sentiment, liquidity, breadth, and
value are all in the crapper, so to speak.


That doesn't take away from this discussion because there are ways to hedge portfolios and continue to hold
companies for the long-term. I'm not  saying iRobot will not go down with the market. I'm saying IRBT deserves a
place in most emerging growth portfolios based upon many factors. To look at an earning's report and suddenly
declare:


"Update: Incredibly bad guidance to start 2015, i don't see things getting any better from here on out."


Well. I wish we could be talking about IRBT three years from now. I would include ADEP even though it's a pretty
small cap position. As I said, and will repeat many times over, "it takes investment foresight, based on logic, and
ability to see changing industry trends, to be an emerging growth investor. I hate to pull rank on you Stan, but 10
years in the market is a really short time. I have specialized in growth stock investing for my entire investment lifetime,
since Dec. 1964, when I was 19. It takes a lot of water under the bridge and to be logically minded, so as to look at
the big picture, whether it involves emerging growth investing or even understanding the technical aspects of the
markets.


In an emerging growth portfolio, IRBT is an integral part. This is based upon the simple fact that they were, and still
are, a first striker in an industry that may dwarf the internet in the next few years. From "here on out" is an expression
one can use but it risks that people with an elephant memory will remember. I would pick up more shares of iRobot on
major dips in, what I believe to be, a market declining year. I expect it will remain among my, and my client's ten
largest investments. 
And Ben, please get out of your short position. It may end up haunting you.


06 Feb 2015, 11:51 AM


crazylikebudfox
Ben - I've learned not to question leviek about investing in emerging growth names, especially when it comes to robot
vacuums and 3d printers. He's been covering the space since before there were vacuums or printers, or space for
that matter. Even if you are right, and IRBT blows up this year or the next, you will still be wrong because leviek will
still be buying on the dip, until the day there are no vacuums, or printers, or space.


06 Feb 2015, 05:56 PM


leviek
Yes crazy....I'll be buying on dips "from here on out"! Actually, I will mostly unhedge my portfolio near DOW 14,000
and then buy "from there on out"!


Also, good point, I am invested in 3D printing + maybe 20 other emerging growth industries (leading companies). I
bought DDD years ago at $15 before the 3/2 split, so $10. I will be adding to DDD, XONE, ADSK, and maybe a little
more ONVO near the DOW lows near the low 14,000's. I will also initiate a new position in SSYS at that time. 
I am also currently 143% hedged on my portfolio so am not too concerned about those positions declining in value. I
expect it!!

leviek
Ben...Please see my comment on the recent IRBT article. We'll be talking about iRobot in 3-4 years and how the
robotic industry has blossomed into various avenues of growth.


While I expect a significant market drop this year to 14,021-14,198 in the DOW, and IRBT will likely drop with the
market, you should be thinking more about catching the next wave of emerging growth, whether it be technology,
medical areas, or even alternative energy. Sticking to a story like shorting IRBT is really not the way to invest. How
totally boring!!


26 Mar 2015, 12:35 PM


crazylikebudfox
Ben, short calls are boring. Want real insight? How Leviek's call about a big Dow correction this year - that's
where the action is. It's not too dissimilar to his Dow call back in Sept'14, here (taking from comments above):


"I believe, based upon significant sentiment extremes that almost all stocks should be avoided at this time,
with a likely substantial correction into the October time frame looming. The odds of a decline in the DOW to
at least 14,021-14,198 is great, with a strong possibility of the low 13,000's being reached."


After a brief mid-Oct dip to 16,000, the Dow ripped higher, ended Oct over 17,000. But see, Leviek kicks the
can down the road on his correction (he's 400 years old, so he's been around the block and knows when you
are wrong with timing, you just move the goalpost).


See, Leviek is a market genius with real insight (even when he's wrong). Your research, by comparison, is
futile, non-factual and "boring."

I'm sorry crazy fox that you seem to be unfamiliar with bull and bear market transitions. I can sit here and try and
explain to you what it takes to understand the market technically but it would simply be a waste my time.


It would be an extremely long and arduous undertaking to try and help you get just an inkling of a certain type of
technical market knowledge, sufficient to understanding cycles, based on sentiment, market breadth, liquidity, and
valuation. This wouldn't even begin to skim the surface on bull and bear markets, their support and resistance levels,
and potentially being 100% invested when the time is right and protected at major inflection points.

It's really silly for me to get into this but just the fact that you are quoting my comments on the market last year shows
me that you, with all do respect, seem to be amateurish in your understanding of market trends. The market is a
moving target and delayed market trends are the norm. You choose to quote me thinking that making me look bad will
boost your ego when all you are doing is showing the world your lack of understanding.


I do presentations on the market with substantial numbers of financial advisors and I have never, EVER, told anyone
that I can only be correct in My ASSUMPTIONS. There's no guarantee that I am, or will always be correct. Where did
you see that? What made you think that? Why do you assume to speak for me? My opinions are based on a lifetime
of research and yet, there's no pretense here. You have decided to take a statement, or statements I have made,
which are my opinions and repeat them, but for what purpose? Do you scroll through SA looking for things people
say, repeat them, and think you've made a point?


I have not diverged from MY OPINION, based on a lifetime of research, due to market technicals, including off the
wall sentiment (too many extremes to mention), liquidity issues (margin debt), a continuing poor RSI (market breadth),
that the most likely target on the DOW this year is 14,021-14,198, the highs of 2007. This equates with a Russell 2000
move down to the 860-880 area, the highs reached in 2007, 2011, and 2012.


Crazy...Take this for what it's worth, and I know you are the type of individual that would never let something like this
sit. Don't ever pretend to speak for me! What gave you that right??


28 Mar 2015, 02:51 PM


crazylikebudfox
You have the right to question Ben's assumptions and argument flaws, but when someone points out your
own...how dare they question the great Leviek!


28 Mar 2015, 03:02 PM


leviek
crazy.....Can you understand the distinction between not agreeing with things people write and telling them they are
wrong, making fun of their statements, and therefore, cannot possibly adhere to your own personal opinions? What
do you have against confident people? Are you personally hurt or damaged by my statements? I haven't degraded
anyone here, just disagreeing with their philosophy. Why does that bother you? Very often, people are put off by
individuals because they feel that individual has an ego problem. Most often than not, it is the person that is put off
that has that problem, but cannot look themself in the mirror.


I totally disagree with Ben's iRobot assumptions, especially if looked at in the framework of a long-term emerging
growth stock scenario. To short a leading edge emerging growth company with the type of potential IRBT has seems
like a waste of time and effort. These are MY OPINIONS!! If I go on record as disagreeing, does that give you the
right to presumably show the world that I cannot possibly be correct in my assumptions because, just look at what I
once said?


Investing in the market is, and never will be, an exact science. If you don't agree with what I say, go ahead and
challenge it. I'm open to that. By trying to present statements I made as an indication that I can only be wrong shows,
and I hate to put it again in these terms, amateurish ideas and intentions.

If, as it seems, you have a problem with my seemingly eccentric manner, maybe a problem with people who are
confident in their assumptions, then tell me. Don't try and put me down for expressing my ideas, ideas you don't agree
with.


I tell my clients I feel confident in my market opinions, but this is based upon a lifetime of research, through trial and
error. Yes! I said error!!. One cannot possibly be successful in the market without facing failure. NO ONE!


And finally, yes, I believe very strongly we will have a major correction/bear market in the period ahead. My personal
account, while fully invested, is short 135% of my total portfolio in Russell 2000 futures. This is about as fully hedged
as I would get, which may again tell anyone how certain I am of my convictions of the current market environment.
I've been through this many times in the past, most often early, but almost always right. I could be wrong, but I
wouldn't bet against it.


As I've said, I am a student of the markets since I was 19. I've studied bull and bear markets going back to the 1800's
but have been personally involved in 12-14 major correction/bear markets (over 20% DOW declines) since 1965. I
can recite every correction, and the years, going back to 1929 simply because I would research market charts since I
was in college. I've spent nearly 50 years in developing my own proprietary sentiment indicators on the market, and
this is through trial and error.


I'm usually early when I think a transition is about to take place, but again, usually right. I believe in being 100%
invested, and riding the up trends in bull cycles but very protective when I believe extremes in sentiment have been
reached. I do not enjoy making substantial profits in bull markets only to see them whither away when the cycle
changes.


An article was once written in The Wall Street Journal about how I manage one technical tool that I helped develop at
the International Securities Exchange (the largest electronic options exchange in the U.S.) Even this sentiment
indicator must be watched closely as most indicators are subject to change. For example, while put/call (call/put)
ratios today seem benign in terms of extremes in sentiment, this is misleading because it doesn't take into account
dirivative strategies. In actuality, those strategies that involve bullish option assumptions, such as call buying and put
selling, have been going through the roof, even as put/call ratios, in itself are not at an extreme.


I feel 90% certain a significant correction will occur between April and October and I have prepared myself and my
clients for such an outcome. Of course I can be wrong, but then again, investing in the market is not an exact
science.

At any given time a stock is either expensive or inexpensive. History has shown that investors that pick the
inexpensive stock of great companies and hold for indefinite periods have done better than any other type of
investment strategy. I-Robot is a great company and it's stock is inexpensive at the moment. Thanks for listening.

Ben, there are 11 analyst that together expect IRBT to earn $1.6 w/ a 16% growth rate for next 5 years. If we
put a P/E of 15 on that, we get $24/sh, then you have to add at least a solid $10 of discounted tangible book
value ($7.4 cash and 50% of non cash book value), which gives us $34/sh as fair value. IRBT has
consistently beet street estimates for at least the past year, so IRBT is more likely to beat the above estimates
too. discounting (per above) their price to sales is ~1.2, forward P/E is ~14, so that is a PEG < 1, which is very
cheap for very profitable, solid cash flow, disruptive emerging technology company. So long as IRBT keeps
beating estimates and growing revenues/EPS at the expected rate, then sooner than later (e.g., when robots
get back into hype) the street will have to give them a more appropriate P/E of at least 20 which would put
IRBT at $42 if w/in 1 year, which would be a 30% gain matching (unsustainable, Fed juiced) NASDQ growth
of 15%/yr. when the Fed starts tightening, NASDQ will at least go flat YoY but more likely will drop, while IRBT
could keep growing so long as we don't go into a recession.


so, this exercise tells me I should keep holding my IRBT (@$33) for another year. Please point out where my
analysis supporting this 'hold' conclusion is flawed.


I should also point out that these kind of emerging tech companies/markets tend to have binary outcomes,
and given that IRBT is clearly not a failed technology or failed biz model, then (as AMZN bears have painfully
learned) the risk is much more to the upside.


would you say IRBT is a good short now??? if it is not a good short, then it is at least a good hold, per my
above logic.

so, out of all the points/facts I made, that was the only hope at something you could pick? that makes my
case nicely b/c of everything I was saying, this "beating street estimates" point was the least important to
support my HOLD rating on the stock.


"If it consistently beet (beat) estimates don't you think the stock would be rising, and not stuck doing nothing?" 
you missed my point that the whole Robotics and automation sector is currently disfavored, so P/E's will be at
the low end of the range, and future growth stories ignored. So, a flat stock for past year just reflects that
IRBT under promised and over delivered making YoY EPS growth about flat, like the price. that can change at
any time,and when it does, at least a 20-30% gain could be seen across the board just on that sentiment
change.


re "The accurate statement is that IRBT has now twice issued weak guidance. " 
not true. the accurate statement is the IRBT had issued weak guidance for over 1 year, but consistently beat
that guidance expectations by 30-60% (except Dec when it met expectations). 
http://yhoo.it/1d9wBOq


"The market is fwd looking, not backward." 
I see logic is not your strong suit. yes, and you are again making my point given the track record of under
promising and over delivering, the current forward estimates for 2016 are for $1.6/shr EPS which is a 25%
gain, but because these estimates are again based on weak guidance, we can again expect they'll continue
to beat that weak guidance by at least 30% (as they did on average the past year), so that would be a 60+%
EPS gain YoY, and stock price would follow.


BTW, the fact you ignored me asking you "would you say IRBT is a good short now?" shows us that you are
afraid to short IRBT, b/c you know very well that IRBT is fairly valued here, and the risk is far more to the
upside, than any downside.


so, before you try to (wrongfully) pat yourself on the back, you may want to recall that your article was saying
there was major "Downside Risk" to IRBT stock price, which was a call to either short it or sell it, but certainly
NOT hold it. When your article published IRBT was ~$32, and since then it actually went up 10%, never went
below $30, and is now almost exactly flat from your 'sell/short" call. So, by you gloating IRBT has been "Dead
money" compared to NASDQ, you are actually admitting that your original call failed, and you were (so far)
wrong about most everything, and you are still afraid to short IRBT, so you have no conviction today in your
original thesis last year. IMO, this is a pretty pathetic (failed) analyst call to be gloating about today. If you are
really a Hedge fund manager, you need to learn how to better manage your public statements and analyst
calls if you want to establish a reputation of credibility, and not come across as just talking your book (shorting
IRBT) ...

Ben, sorry to see you are getting so desperate in trying to not lose big on your short. on this particular one
you've really outdone yourself in ridiculousness, though. IRBT is a consumer robot company, and
shareholders are quite happy that they are not wasting limited R&D budget on trying to create a biped
Terminator robot. As the article points out, even the basic kind of military robot projects are a money loser for
IRBT and should be dropped. So, it is rather ignoramus for you to suggest IRBT is a failure for not going all
out on DARPA biped soldier projects. Or maybe you wish IRBT did wast money on that to give you hope on
your short thesis coming true...


LOL!!!

Ben.....Once again, let me just say, technical knowledge of markets, not just fundamentals of stocks is imperative if
you really want to send out derogatory statements on individual companies. Most emerging growth stocks, in the
universe of small to mid-cap, topped out around February and March last year.


One can see, if experienced enough, that not only the RSI, but also the MACD have been issuing sell signals on the
market since then. My clients and I have many emerging growth stock positions and are now well protected for a
significant decline I believe will occur between now and the fall. To talk about dead money by mentioning one mid-cap
emerging growth company is ignoring the simple fact that market momentum has switched for over a year now.


You are beating (beeting?) a dead horse with your statements on iRobot. Why insist on shorting such a company
when you can simply short IWM. Are you at all familiar with the technical aspects of the market? Your statements
show an immaturity in understanding.

Ben....Why do you insist on finding bad news to prove your point? Wasn't your point made a long time ago? The only
thing that will allow you to save face is that the market will likely drop significantly into the late fall. I expect the DOW
to hit 14,021-14,198 and the Ruseell 2000 Index to hit 860-880.


I will be looking to add to my IRBT position, probably around October. At least I have a plan Ben, what do you have?
Maybe a need to show everyone that you can pick a stock that can go down? In the next cycle iRobot may be a
leader among growth companies. Ben, if I were you, I would cover your shorts at the October lows in the market and
get yourself a good long position for the future.

@lev.., Ben always ignores answering to opposing evidence. I posted this in reply to his same comment on
his other article, but still no answering:


******** 
If the CTO left b/c of his own personal/career reasons, then why do you figure IRBT would give him
severance benefits to "resign"? I mean, he just signed it days ago, so that makes me think IRBT wanted to
get rid of him to get fresh CTO blood w/o looking bad and firing him for poor performance, and causing bad
PR/blood.

I actually used the Roomba 550 for a few years. And I recently got the Roomba 780 for $369, in an amazon sale. The
prices for newer 880 ($700) and 980 ($900) was too much to rationalize spending those amounts. From my
perspective, Irobot doesn't have any great technology advantage, but they do many small things well. For example,
roomba can get over cables, ect where other manufacturers get hung up. If you look at reviews from long term users
on the internet, the other robot vacuum manufacturers always have usability issues, that it is a pain to work around.
perhaps the other manufacturers will figure these issues out with time, but I do think IRobot has an advantage right
now.


30 Dec 2015, 02:04 PM


Aricool
I tend to agree with that take. I use the 550 for almost 2 years now, and it paid off for me w/in 2 weeks b/c my
hourly time is worth quite allot. My wife is always thrilled how clean I keep the carpets weekly w/ the 550,
whereas I was always too busy and carpets would be horribly dirty for almost a month before I got time to
vacuum. the interesting thing is that the competition can't even beat IRBT on price or reliability, so IRBT
should keep market share for a long time to come...


30 Dec 2015, 07:04 PM

In the next market cycle, IRBT will be a leader. Problem is we will likely decline into the 14,021-14,198 area of the
DOW first.

Ben, if you are joking here then that wall climbing bot is a big laugh wrt IRBT, and it is very entertaining to
even pretend it matters. However, if you are seriously thinking this has any relevance to IRBT's
products/revenues then I have real concerns that you don't know anything at all about what you are talking
about wrt IRBT's competition or robots. which is it? I'm hoping you wanted to give us a good laugh...

leviek
Ben....When someone is obsessed it's important to take what they say about that obsession with a grain of salt. You
locked onto iRobot as a good short awhile back and simply won't let go.


Truth be told you will have time to gloat for awhile as the market is likely to drop to around 14,021-14,198 in the DOW
sooner or later. So many companies have hit the dust in the last couple of years during your IRBT tirade, and you
could have shorted many, stocks like GoPro, FireEye, just about any emerging growth stock. You locked onto iRobot
and won't let go.


Sure, it will go down with the market but your obsession will keep you in your short position because you are just NOT
a market technician. IRobot is one of the pure play leaders in robotics, with strong finances, and a strategy to grow in
one of the first robotic platforms in an industry that will someday dwarf the internet. Being so one directional is such a
waste of effort, time, and money. Aren't there any better things you can think of?


Wall climbing robots. How do they compete? THEY DON'T!!!!


10 Jan 2016, 01:21 PM


leviek
By the way, Ben. You wrote this article on September 4th 2014.


IRobot closed that day at $32.28. Friday, after a 14 month period has passed, iRobot closed at $31.94. During that 14
month period many, and I mean MANY, stocks have collapsed. You could have shorted the Russell 2000 Index and
made a great deal of money. That's the main index I use to hedge my clients portfolios when I believe we are in a
declining market.


So you made $.34 on your short position at a time you could have been a champ. Your obsession with iRobot is a
joke and I would think very hard about it. Problem is $.34 won't even buy you a stamp so you can mail me a rebuttal.

yes Ben, but was that your original bear call? This only happened after the China crash and recession fears

C'mon Ben! Not again. iRobot is affected by everything technology companies are affected by. I was looking to add to
my position as I have believed, and still do, a decline to the 14,021-14,198 area of the DOW is likely at a market low. I
was almost giving up on adding because the stock has held so well as others have collapsed. I now am looking to add
at the lows and believe the stock will go down with the market (as almost all stocks do).


You have been dead wrong!!!! You are wrong to even look your readers in the eye and talk about a short-term
guidance check brought about by the macro environment. My sentiment indicators and chart patterns suggest a low is
still coming. The Russell 2000 Index is likely to reach 850-870 while the Dow is hitting the low 14,000's, so stocks like
IRBT will also decline. Your research has been wrong and to grasp at lower guidance to prove your point is ridiculous.
Also, it must be kept in mind that IRBT has a tendency to be ultra-conservative in the beginning of years.


Get a grip Ben and forget about trying to prove a point. You are grasping at straws.

Yes Ben,,,,It was just a ridiculous strategy to be obsessed with. IRBT is outperforming just about any emerging growth

Also, I'm sure their new products, floor washing + remote presence are entering a new growth phase for the company.

I thought lawn mowing was going to be the next big deal. I sold today w/ an OK profit (from 33) b/c while they
keep market share profitability will likely be capped by knockoffs. re floor washing, I have a hard time seeing
how residential consumer will spend for a 2nd bot to do an even more rare cleaning task. also con call said
the plan to profit only on the consumables, so seems like a low margin printer business model. so, I'm not
expecting huge adoption rates- seems high risk. why are they not targeting commercial floor washing
markets?

But really Ben....Is this the best short you could find?


I expect this bear market to continue shortly, looking for 14,021-14,198 low on the DOW. Why not just short IWM? The
Russell 2000 may hit major support at the 850-870 area. That would equate to around 23% from here. You can also
buy SRTY (triple Russell Short) or UVXY (triple VIX short) but it's pretty risky.


Of course IRBT can drop more than 23% in that kind of a correction but is it truly a great short play?

commodity. However, it is also not a great environment for pricing power or high profits, but that is by far not a
short thesis. So, I agree with leviek, IRBT was/is not a smart short.


10 May 2016, 05:24 PM


leviek
The technology quotient for current and future iRobot products is based upon strong research over many years. It is
"the foundation" of future development and growth. To say their products are commodities is actually the reason you
have made the mistake of being in a position that is a waste of time. There are so many stocks that have declined
since early 2014, when the market momentum peaked, that to even consider your position in IRBT viable is really
stretching it.


I mean, aren't there other fields to conquer? Why become emotionally involved with a strategy on a company that
may be considered today as the leader in robotic technology and has a platform that can increase over time, as well
as a strong financial foundation? Isn't it somewhat embarrassing to sit on this short position for so long while so many
other emerging growth companies have peaked in value since early 2014 and have had substantial declines?


I'm a registered investment advisor (also financial advisor) for close to 40 years. I have specialized in two areas, the
technical aspects of the market and emerging growth stocks. I have an article that was written about some of my
technical experience in the Wall Street Journal in 2005, Moving The Market-Tracking The Numbers, November, 2005.
I'm not bragging by saying this. I'm trying to show you you're barking up the wrong tree with your stance. I'm sure you
have knowledge and expertise in your field but have been surprised at your obsession with this one short position, as
it seems like you just don't want to admit it was a waste of time because you wrote the initial article and made the
video.


I would just drop this and move on but it doesn't seem that you are the kind of person that can admit defeat. Everyone
makes mistakes in the market, it won't be the first, or last time.


11 May 2016, 12:53 PM


Aricool
I seriously doubt he ever kept a short on IRBT for any significant length of time. He's much more likely
committed to keeping his SA image looking good. So, in taking him seriously, you might be "barking up the
wrong tree"... ;-)

I don't mean to harp on this but I still can't understand how anyone can concentrate so much on shorting iRobot. They
only happen to be the free world's leader in working robots and can expand into different areas of internet connected
robots for the home and factory. Also, their finances are strong, with good cash flow and solid growth rates for years
to come.


Sorry Ben, but shorting the stock was really not a logical choice. With all due respect, I wish you well.
