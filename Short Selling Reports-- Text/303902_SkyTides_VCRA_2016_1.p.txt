Vocera & Robert Zollars – Purveyors of Fraud & Obsolete, Defective Products


Highlights


VCRA Chairman Zollars was CEO or Chairman of 3 companies previously accused of fraud, 2 of which
settled for a total of $709.8 million, the 3rd fraud is a possible $9 million VCRA securities fraud


We allege in this report that Zollars led his 4th fraud while at VCRA: 4 witnesses support our allegation
“we continually missed our forecasts quarter after quarter…and proactively chose to use the backlog to
“smooth” Vocera’s quarterly numbers”


Insiders, including Silicon Valley venture capitalists and strategic partners, have sold more than $200
million of VCRA stock since IPO


Motorola was initially an investor, but sold its VCRA shares and is now a notable and better capitalized
competitor than VCRA


VCRA has one product. Last major product launch in 2011, despite fact that 9 of 10 competitors we
pro�led (most of which are better capitalized) had major product launches in last 11 months


VCRA’s product appears to be inferior, as made clear by nearly every measure considered (i.e. no
touchscreen), yet it appears to be the most expensive product and has the highest apparent installation
costs of any product we pro�led


We found a plethora of users suggesting the VCRA device is terrible and that they are unsatis�ed with
its performance


Customer churn, which VCRA does not disclose regularly, appears to be approximately 18%, or about 1
in 5 customers, calculated in the aggregate since VCRA’s inception


VCRA uses sales to uninformed customers to pump VCRA’s stock, we spoke with Franciscan Alliance –
VCRA’s top new customer


VCRA CTO has admitted 15 defects in VCRA’s sole product


VCRA aggregate losses total $109.8 million, -5.07% CAGR 2012-2015


VCRA has reported pro�ts in 3 quarterly periods out of 16 total quarterly periods – however we allege
an accounting fraud was underway during those 3 quarters


Market’s movement towards app-based solutions could force VCRA to �nance customer installations or
o�er steep discounts in order to compete


Price target: $4.50 (short term cash, 64% downside), long term target: $0

7/5/2019 Skytides - Vocera & Robert Zollars – Purveyors of Fraud & Obsolete, Defective Products


skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 2/42


 
Vocera Overview
 
In our view long term investors will generally become excited by a company’s prospects based on (1) the
management team’s prowess, (2) technology that is innovative or provides some form of signi�cant
competitive advantage that bene�ts the company, or (3) an enormous market opportunity that the company
has some particular advantage in as compared against its competitors.
 
In this report we will explain the following:
 


1. Mr. Zollars, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Vocera, Inc. (VCRA) is directly associated with
previous settled frauds, for alleged accounting and securities laws violations, totaling $709.8 million (i.e.
Neoforma $586M, Diamond Foods $123.8M). Mr. Zollars and VCRA’s current CEO, Mr. Brent Lang – both
of whom were accused of fraud, appear ready to settle another securities fraud for an additional $9
million – which would bring the total “settled fraud bill” for companies a�liated with them to
approximately $720 million. As if this was not enough we have calculated that of the 2 public
companies Mr. Zollars has been CEO of, namely Neoforma and VCRA, those two companies have lost a
combined $900 million for their shareholders as of today – this �gure does not include the $709.8
million in fraud settlements which may have been paid by insurers. If a long term investor can �nd a
reason to support someone with Mr. Zollars’ track record we welcome the argument.


2. VCRA management routinely touts their technology. However, VCRA's:


► technology is approximately 5 years old
► hardware and software can not compete with 9 other competitors who have technology that was
signi�cantly updated in the last 11 months
► device does not have a touch screen
► device is incapable of keeping a “call history” for its users
► device drops voice calls routinely
► device appears to have a large base of users who despise it
► device is the costliest device of 6 devices we pro�led
► installation costs for a new client is apparently the costliest install fee of the 10 systems we pro�led
 


3. The market opportunity for VCRA is much more limited than VCRA’s management will have you believe.
VCRA suggests there are 6,000 hospitals in the U.S. that could use their system. VCRA does not consider
that of those hospitals only about 2,000 hospitals can a�ord VCRA’s installation costs – according to a
former VCRA executive, whom an a�liate of ours interviewed in March 2016. Further, VCRA seems to
completely ignore the fact that their competitors exist and generally have long term contracts with their
customers – the same hospitals VCRA suggests are readily available for VCRA to sign up. Ultimately, the
market opportunity for VCRA is at best in the “hundreds of hospitals” at any given time in our opinion,
rather than 6,000. This misrepresentation of VCRA’s market opportunity should be quite alarming to a
VCRA long term investor. Furthermore, the current environment in which hospitals operate in is hardly
rosy. Hospitals are under severe pressure nowadays to cut costs. This trend is not expected to reverse
any time soon. The hospital market opportunity is not "large, desirable, or even expanding." It is
contracting. VCRA suggests that its products can improve operating e�ciency and save costs. Based on
what we know of VCRA's product, we �nd this claim highly questionable. Additionally, we have
identi�ed 9 of VCRA's competitors that we believe o�er a better solution for hospitals than VCRA.


I.    Robert Zollars’ Associations with Fraud
 
Robert Zollars is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of VCRA and was formerly VCRA’s CEO.

Figure 1
 
According to his biography, Mr. Zollars has been associated with the companies outlined in the chart below -
all of which have been accused of fraud, have settled a claim of fraud, and/or have a fraud claim settlement
pending, including VCRA.
 
We are unaware of any other report which brings to light a possible accounting fraud at VCRA. We are also
unaware of any other documents or reports which tie the alleged accounting fraud at VCRA to Zollars’ prior
business ventures.
 
Below is a summary of Mr. Zollars’s association with alleged frauds.

II.    Zollars In�uence Felt at VCRA, We Allege VCRA Accounting Fraud
 
Two class action lawsuits were �led against VCRA in 2013. The class actions were subsequently joined into
one lawsuit (the “Class Action”). Mr. Zollars and Mr. Brent Lang, VCRA’s current CEO, were also accused in
connection with the Class Action. Class action lawsuits are not unusual with public companies, however, the
Class Action is unusual for two reasons.
 


1. The Class Action, which alleged false and misleading statements made by VCRA’s management appears
as though it will be settled for $9 million. We have reviewed the court documents associated with the
Class Action in detail. The allegations of wrongdoing by management, namely Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang,
appear to have merit, as outlined in detail in the complaint and supporting documents provided by the
plainti�’s counsel, the reputable law �rm of Labaton Sucharow LLP.


2. The Class Action investigation uncovered additional instances of wrongdoing by management, many of
which can be described as accounting fraud. We have reviewed the court documents associated with
the Class Action and obtained copies of statements made by four (4) key witnesses that depict an
apparent organized and aggressive accounting fraud at VCRA. We do not believe the speci�c
information presented in this report about accounting fraud at VCRA has previously been made
publicly available in one document.


The allegations and evidence outlined within the Class Action provided an overview of daily operations at
VCRA. We have provided actual excerpts of the Class Action documents in Appendix B and F to this report.
 
Upon our review of the court documents and other evidence we obtained about Mr. Zollars’ past, we are left
with the following questions:
 
► In light of VCRA’s history of fraud allegations, and Mr. Zollars’ association with alleged and settled securities
and accounting frauds, should current optimistic statements and projections made by VCRA be given any
credence?
► If Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang successfully executed not only securities fraud but also accounting fraud, and
they have pro�ted from such actions, what reason would Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang have to end their apparent
fraudulent activity at VCRA
 
Below is the key evidence we have obtained about the potential VCRA accounting fraud.
 


1. Corroborated Evidential Statements by Four (4) Witnesses Support Claim of VCRA Accounting Fraud


A �rst-hand depiction of apparent accounting fraud at VCRA was provided by four (4) con�dential witnesses
(the “CWs”), one of whom was previously VCRA’s Senior Director of Internal Audit and Compliance. These
individuals outlined actions taken by Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang, among others, in and open and aggressive
manner, on a daily basis, in management meetings attended by a group of approximately 5-6 high ranking
individuals in VCRA’s conference room, to apparently fraudulently misrepresent VCRA’s top and bottom line
results to the public. The CWs corroborated each other’s statements. Unless these four individuals (who do
not stand to gain �nancially by their statements) have coordinated their stories and lied to the court, these
court documents lead us inexorably to conclude that the depictions of accounting fraud by the CWs actually
happened and current management, including Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang led the accounting fraud e�ort.
 
The following quotes from the Class Action were of interest to us:
 
•    Pre-meditated e�ort to misrepresent:

skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 5/42


“CW2 stated that prior to 1Q13, Vocera missed its forecasts in each quarters in 2012 by 20%.
Consistent with CW1’s account, CW2 stated ‘We continually missed our forecasts quarter after quarter
[but] Bill (Zerella) was insistent on growth and took from backlog to make up the shortfalls.’
 
Note: CW2 is referenced within the court documents as VCRA’s former Senior Director of Internal Audit &
Compliance
 
•    Massaging revenues:
 
“CW1 further advised that about 20% of the Company’s quarterly revenue during the Class Period
came from Vocera’s pulling of revenue out of backlog, into an earlier quarter.”
 
•    Further toying with sales:
 
“In order to make quarterly guidance and continue the façade that Vocera remained a ‘growth story,’
Defendants scoured Vocera’s backlog and pushed hospitals to accelerate the acceptance of shipments
of Vocera products to an earlier quarter, allowing Vocera to recognize revenue sooner and meet
guidance.”
 
•    Lack of disclosure:
 
“Defendants were essentially robbing revenue from future quarters to allow the Company to meet
guidance in the current quarter – all without telling the market that new bookings were declining and
backlog was dropping.”
 
•    Pursuing the wrong goals:
 
“This smoothing of revenue also created the appearance that Defendants were able to deliver
consistent, on-target guidance and results.”
 
•    Deliberate actions:
 
“CW1 recalled sitting in the revenue meetings [which were attended by the Individual Defendants]
and listening to the executives discuss how they were going to need to utilize the backlog to achieve
revenue targets.”
 
•    Obsessive attention to fraud:
 
“According to CW1, Mike Hutchinson, VP of Finance, spent the majority of his time trying to �gure out
how to utilize the backlog to generate current revenue by accelerating shipments, or pulling backlog
forward, to compensate for the Company’s shortfall in sales each quarter.”
 
“According to CW1, at the end of the quarter, Defendents decided what to ship and book as revenue.
CW1 stated” ‘Zerella and every high-ranking executive was at these meetings…as I was – I never saw a
group that was so intent to know every number and involved in all of those decisions.”

2. Actual Financial Results Reported by VCRA Support Claim of VCRA Accounting Fraud


We believe the claim of accounting fraud at VCRA is supported by actual results reported by VCRA. As seen in
our review of the �nancials below, during the time period outlined by the CWs, i.e. Q2-Q4 2012, VCRA
reported pro�ts of $1.2 million, $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Aside from those three quarterly

skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 6/42


reporting periods identi�ed below where we have a detailed �rst-hand outline of potential accounting fraud,
VCRA’s SEC �lings have never shown a pro�t.
 


 
Figure 3
 
Source: Various public �lings by VCRA at www.sec.gov
 
We are unable to conclude that accounting fraud is no longer occurring at VCRA. Further, we believe it is
important to note that although the depiction of accounting fraud was corroborated by the CWs and the
overall evidence of accounting fraud is substantial in our opinion, we don’t believe the purpose of the Class
Action was to make the claim of accounting fraud. The Class Action was meant to substantiate securities fraud
only, as can be viewed in the court �lings. Since the securities fraud appears likely to be settled shortly, it is
possible that litigation involving the potential accounting fraud could be �led shortly after the securities fraud
is settled (although this cannot be known for sure).
 
We also noted that VCRA did not restate its �nancials for the quarterly reporting periods in which the
accounting fraud claim exists. We believe VCRA’s auditors, the reputable Deloitte & Touche LLP, were
previously unaware of the accounting fraud claim. We believe this because of our direct experience working
for and with “Big 4” and other smaller auditing �rms over the past decade or so. The review of court
documents associated with active, settled or terminated litigations are not reviewed by auditors as a standard
audit practice - in our experience. On or around the date of this report, the San Jose, California and national
(i.e. New York) o�ces of Deloitte & Touche LLP have been informed of this report.
 
III.    Insiders Appear to Have Sold Over $200,000,000 Worth of VCRA Stock Since IPO
 


1. Silicon Valley investors and strategic partners have sold out of most of their VCRA shares.


We calculated sales of approximately 10.5M shares by Silicon Valley venture capitalists and former VCRA
strategic investors. We estimate these shares were sold for an average of approximately $20.00 per share,
resulting in estimated proceeds for these investors of $210M.

Figure 4
 
Source: This analysis assumes investors who did not report holding any shares as of December 31, 2015 did
not own any shares of VCRA. We reviewed all Form 13 and Form 4 �lings for these individuals at www.sec.gov
for the period from March 31, 2015 through March 10, 2016 and
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1129260/000119312512137594/d2067....
 
Additional related notes:
 
1.)    We noted Motorola Solutions, Inc. was previously a signi�cant shareholder and strategic partner of VCRA
but is now a competitor – and appears to have sold out all of their VCRA shares.
 
2.)    We noted that several investors, including Venrock and GGV were represented on VCRA’s Board of
Directors, and were personally sued in connection with the Class Action. Venrock and GGV have been
aggressive sellers of VCRA stock in the past few years. We presume that these investors had insider
information about the Class Action claims, and potential accounting fraud. VCRA did not make the public
aware of the accounting fraud claim. We have not seen it discussed in any SEC �ling by VCRA. We are left to
surmise, therefore, that Venrock and GGV traded on the basis of their insider, non-public information.
 


2. Insider sales over last 12 months show aggressive consistent selling


We reviewed all insider transactions in the shares of VCRA from March 31, 2015 through April 1, 2016. There
has not been one open market purchase of any shares of VCRA by an insider during that time period.
However, during that time period the insiders listed below sold 26% of their holdings in VCRA. The Chief
Medical O�cer is selling the most aggressively. In a vacuum, without even considering any other facts
presented in this report, this constant and signi�cant sale of VCRA shares by insiders should give all VCRA
investors concern. We calculated sales of 685,131 shares were sold by insiders in this time period – at the
same time, quarter after quarter, Mr. Lang presents optimistic growth for the foreseeable future. We estimate
these shares were sold for an average of approximately $12.00 per share, resulting in estimated proceeds for
these investors of $8.2M.

3. Majority shareholder is Silicon Valley and advanced technology outsider


In our opinion, it is a matter of substantial concern for the future of a company where that company bills
itself as having world-class technology but is majority-owned by an investor with limited if any expertise in
high technology. We noted this in our last report on Conformis.  VCRA’s majority shareholder is a Baltimore-
based money manager that appears to be a �ne institution.  However, Brown Capital does not appear to have
even one employee who has any experience in high technology in or outside Silicon Valley, to the best of what
we can discern. Everything else in this report considered, we would be hesitant to take Brown Capital’s lead in
investing in VCRA. One wonders if Brown Capital knows something we don’t know – or for that matter
Motorola, Cisco, Venrock, GGV, Vanguard Ventures, RRE Ventures, or Thomas Weisel don’t know?

IV.    VCRA Product Doesn’t Stack up Against Competition
 
All discussions about Vocera’s sole product have been developed from direct conversations with an expert in
the telecommunications and wireless space (the “Telecom Expert”). The Telecom Expert’s biography is
provided in Appendix C to this report.

VCRA was founded in 2000. VCRA o�ers its customers, primarily hospitals, with a communication platform
that relies on a network of VCRA-installed wireless hotspots (“WiFi”) within each hospital. The communication
challenges within each hospital are individual and particular to each institution, due to the di�erences in the
structural layout of each hospital and inherent limitations of WiFi-based communications. The B3000 device
(the “B3000”), as shown below, was launched in 2011 and is provided by VCRA, along with a network
management software solution to purportedly provide communication between nurses, physicians and
others within a hospital.
 


Figure 7

Summary:
 
► VCRA’s sole product is the oldest wireless device (i.e. 2011) being o�ered by the top 10 competitors (“Top
10”) we pro�led in this report. 
► VCRA device is the only device out of 6 we pro�led that does not have a touch screen 
► VCRA’s device is the most expensive device o�ered by the Top 10 (i.e. $1,100) 
► VCRA’s platform is apparently the most expensive to install of the Top 10 (i.e. $300,000+ on average) 
► 3 of 6 competitors pro�led have devices with unlimited range due to their ability to operate on LTE cellular,
WiFi and perhaps other communication platforms, VCRA’s sole product has the shortest range (i.e. 300 ft) 
► VCRA’s device has the smallest screen size, closest competitor’s screen is approx. 2.8X, yet VCRA’s device is
the costliest device by 3.7X
 
Despite the fast pace of technology and cellular device product rollouts, VCRA has not had a major product
launch since 2011. VCRA is already in last place in the Telecom Expert’s view. The various charts below were
developed to visualize the current competitive landscape.

place in nearly every category.

The Telecom Expert stated:
 
VCRA has the most expensive device on the market yet VCRA’s device is the least sophisticated
product.  Among all of its other limitations, perhaps most alarming is that VCRA has the only device of
the six devices we pro�led that does not o�er a touch screen. The phrase, “we now live in a touch
world” was once novel, but now it’s just common sense. VCRA is obsolete by every measure we
considered.

In 2010, prior to the entrance of all of 6 of the competitors we pro�led in this report, the market depended on
Motorola, Spectralink, Ascom and Vocera for device software, device hardware, network software and
network hardware. Now, much like the PC industry, the cellphone industry and many others, this industry has
undergone (just recently, i.e. in December 2015 and January 2016) a defragmentation where strong
competition is arising to focus on a speci�c section of the value chain, i.e. apps, device software, device
hardware, network software, or network hardware. VCRA appears to be moving slowly to determine what
section of the value chain they want to participate in. It is quite clear to us that they will not win if they
continue to try to be “all things wireless communications in healthcare.” However, we don’t see an area of the
value chain where they are a leader or could be a leader. This is one of the primary reasons we see VCRA as a
zero. We don’t envision VCRA succeeding in any one section of the value chain outlined below.

V.    VCRA Product Issues - User Complaints are Plentiful
 
The Telecom Expert spoke with the Former Executive, who was previously involved with over a dozen
installations on behalf of VCRA. When asked of the nurses and doctors perception of VCRA, the Executive was
quite blunt.
 
“Doctors hate these things.”
 
VCRA appears to be operating in an environment where the men and women who lead the daily operations
of each of VCRA’s potential customers are harboring a growing antipathy towards VCRA’s sole product. A
study by Charlotte Tang and Sheelagh Carpendale, both of whom are professors at the University of Calgary,
further highlighted the negative and sometimes hostile view users have of VCRA’s B3000.

We will not discuss the voice recognition software and hands free capabilities o�ered by VCRA in this report
other than to say the following:
 
1.    We believe it is clear VCRA is not a leader in voice recognition software or wearable device design. We
believe the 15 known defects also spell out just how un-workable the voice recognition system appears to be.
 
2.    As Professor Tang outlines in her analysis – we don’t see hands free communications as being entirely
appropriate in a hospital setting due to privacy concerns.
 
When considering the apparent technical immaturity of VCRA’s devices and the pervasive issue of patient
privacy in the hospitals VCRA serves, we can’t begin to fathom how users will ever feel comfortable using
VCRA’s B3000 device.
 
Nurses have �led numerous complaints about VCRA’s product. A few examples of these complaints are
provided below.

VI.    VCRA Does Not Regularly Discuss Customer Churn - or any Other Negative Issues
 
Mr. Zollars and Mr. Lang, as recently as February 2016, have routinely used “non-numerical statements” to
describe the business prospects of VCRA. Given the allegations of securities fraud and detailed descriptions of
accounting fraud that have been corroborated by several former employees, we don’t believe any “non-
numerical” statements made by Mr. Zollars or Mr. Lang should be considered credible. If the statements are
not backed up by �gures or other forms of analysis then it appears likely the statements are being made with
a deceptive or promotional motive in mind.
 
The Class Action spelled out this issue. VCRA has a history of using “non-numerical statements” to support its
story.

VCRA commentary to investors seems as though it is always 100% positive, whereas the negative aspects of
the business seem to always be hidden from the public. When considering that and Mr. Zollars or Mr. Lang’s
history, we don’t see how a long term investor can become comfortable with VCRA.
 
The best example of this is below. As far as we have seen, VCRA has never fully explained its “customer
churn”, i.e., the number of customers that VCRA adds and loses each reporting period. This is a sign that there
is some negativity in this respect, otherwise we believe VCRA would discuss this topic openly.

VCRA explains that its product had been selected by more than 1,400 facilities. We presume this means that
in the aggregate, since its inception, VCRA has had a total of 1,400 customers. VCRA also touted that it had
over 1,150 customers as of December 31, 2015.
 
Simple math suggests that approximately 250 customers or 18% (i.e. 250/1400) have spent the considerable
capital needed to install VCRA’s sole product only to then dispose of it once they began using it.
 
If the average installation cost for these 250 customers is $300,000, which is on the low end of the average
installation range (further below we note evidence that it was $360,000 in 2011 and $300,000-$350,000 in
2016) then that means that VCRA’s former customers have decided they do not want to continue using VCRA’s
product but they also “threw away” approximately $75,000,000, collectively, when they switched to
competitors’ products. That is quite telling in our opinion. In other words, if medical facilities are willing to
part, collectively, with $75,000,000 for the pleasure of not having to use VCRA’s dinosaur product, this says
more about the product itself than any ink we could possibly spill. Given the enormous costs to switch
providers, we can only surmise as to the number of hospital customers who have not switched from VCRA
but who would given a chance at a do-over. Certainly many of the individuals responsible for selecting VCRA
are essentially forced to support the continued use of VCRA in their hospital for fear of being held responsible
for possibly being one of VCRA’s customers who has wasted $300,000 on an inferior, outdated product. If this
is accurate, perhaps the true portion of the 1,400 customers VCRA has worked with that do not wish to
continue using VCRA’s product is signi�cantly higher than 18%.
 
VII.    VCRA Sells to Uninformed Customers, Franciscan Alliance Provides False Sense of Hope
 
On January 6, 2016, VCRA issued a press release announcing a new sale. The sale was to a new customer, the
Franciscan Alliance. Mr. Dick Roskam, M.D., Chief Medical Information O�cer of Franciscan Alliance, was
quoted in the press release.

7/5/2019 Skytides - Vocera & Robert Zollars – Purveyors of Fraud & Obsolete, Defective Products


skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 23/42


 
On March 18, 2016, an a�liate of SkyTides spoke with Mr. Roskam.
 
Mr. Roskam made the following statement:
 
“We looked around… they obviously have a patent on voice technology…texting has unfortunately
become quite common in healthcare and a lot of it is done through apps that are not secure…the big
players are Voalte and Vocera”
 
Mr. Roskam made the following statement in response to a question asking if he spoke with Mototorola or
Ascom – whom we have previously identi�ed as leading incumbents in VCRA’s sector.
 
“No we didn’t talk to them.”
 
Analysis:
 
First, Mr. Roskam con�rmed that he did not speak with Motorola and Ascom – two of the leaders in this
industry. Second, he suggested VCRA has a patent on voice technology – they do not. VCRA licenses the voice
technology from Nuance Communications, along with anyone else willing to pay Nuance a royalty fee. Third,
Mr. Roskam seems to believe VCRA is the only company capable of secure text messaging. On March 30,
2016, we checked Apple’s iTunes store and found 32 apps that provide secure text messaging. Further, we
searched for “best apps for secure text messaging” at www.google.com and came across a list of the top 5
secure mobile messaging apps. Not surprisingly, VCRA is not listed here. It is no secret that secure text
messaging is a key attribute of any wireless device or platform provided to users in a hospital setting. VCRA is
not alone in o�ering secure texting and in our view is clearly not a leader in this speci�c space.
 
In summary, it appears to us that Mr. Roskam was grossly misinformed as to the strengths and limitations of
VCRA’s product.  Perhaps kudos are due to VCRA’s marketing and sales sta�, or perhaps the Franciscan
Alliance is the latest in a string of customers sold an objectively and calculably inferior product.
 
Perhaps VCRA bene�ts from being able to sell to the creamy market of physicians and nurses who are,
demographically, inexperienced in the competitive telecom marketplace. We question if VCRA has ever sold
its sole product to a knowledgeable IT manager who was aware of the 9 other competitors we have pro�led
in this report, and actually considered how VCRA’s product compares.
 
During a conversation with the Telecom Expert, the Former Executive con�rmed that most of VCRA’s sales
were to nurses who we presume have severely limited experience in IT matters.
 
VIII.    VCRA’s International Opportunity is all Hype
 
Since 2012, VCRA has been promoting its opportunity for international expansion. However, VCRA’s
international sales have actually been declining each year.

skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 24/42


 
However, since 2012, and as recently as February 2016, VCRA management have repeatedly promoted the
theme that international growth would drive VCRA’s business in the future. The following are excerpts from
the Class Action court documents and a recent earnings call on February 11, 2016 (the “Earnings Call”),
respectively.
 
January 7, 2013, Mr. Zollars:

Figure 18
 
Source: http://�nance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-vcra-earnings-conference...
 
Lastly, we thought possibly some historical or trend-identifying �nancial ratios would support Mr. Lang’s
ongoing, repetitive, and yet un-ful�lled claim that international growth is going to be a big factor for VCRA. We
considered the following �nancial analysis:
 


 
Figure 19
 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1129260/000112926016000024/vcra-...
 
We found two interesting outcomes from our analysis of the �nancials included in VCRA’s 2015 annual report.
 
1.    Mr. Lang, in promoting the opportunity for growth in international markets, apparently dismisses the fact
that international sales have been declining since VCRA �rst suggested (4 years ago) that international growth
would be a key opportunity for VCRA.
 
2.    Revenues per customer for the international customer base are less than U.S. revenues per customer by
a wide margin (U.S. is $97,000 which is 177.8%, almost twice as pro�table, of international revenues per
customer of $54,000)
 
Mr. Lang should explain to the public why he continues to believe international growth is a major opportunity
and why he expects international growth “at a faster rate than our domestic business.”  Hopefully he
considers an argument that does not involve just non-numerical useless commentary.
 
The Research Notes included comments that relate to this topic as seen below. The Telecom Expert provided
his view thereafter.
 



http://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-vcra-earnings-conference-213650145.html

skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 26/42


 
The product does not work in Europe and Asia.
 
We are wondering how VCRA plans to compete in the international markets when the Product does not work
in Europe and Asia? Those are two very large markets – especially for wireless technology.
 
IX.    Mr. Zollars In�uence Looms Large, Mr. Lang’s Questionable Claim of Increased Deal Size
 
Mr. Lang, as recently as February 11, 2016, during the VCRA earnings call stated:
 
“The average deal size is de�nitely going up.”
 
We thought we would check and see if this statement was true. The Class Action stated that the average deal
size was $360,000 back in 2011, as seen below.
 
 
Figure 21
 
Source: Brado v. Vocera Communications Inc. et al, 3_13-cv-03567, No. 104 
     
However, according to an analyst report from Craig Hallum dated March 3, 2016, the average deal size “a
couple years back” was $250,000. We presume Craig Hallum obtained their data from VCRA.
 


 
Figure 22 
 
Source: Craig Hallum March 3, 2016 Analyst Report
 
So someone appears wrong here. Either the numerous learned attorneys who brought the Class Action are
wrong or Mr. Lang is wrong. It should su�ce to say that, to our knowledge, none of those attorneys have
given us any cause to doubt their veracity. Mr. Lang on the other hand – well we’re not sure what truth means
to him.
 
X.    VCRA Product Issues – CTO Outlines 15 Known Defects
 
On December 17, 2015 Vocera published release notes for its Product (the “Release Notes”). According to the
Telecom Expert,
 
As the reader is possibly aware, “release notes” are common within the tech industry and generally
provide the latest information about defects the company has discovered, addressed and �xed, either
through internal sources or user comments.

skytides.com/article/vocera-robert-zollars-–-purveyors-fraud-obsolete-defective-products 27/42


 
However, VCRA is di�erent from almost all other similarly situated tech companies. The Telecom Expert
reviewed the Release Notes and focused on the “known issues” and “known limitations” sections of the
Release Notes. The following is the table of contents for VCRA’s release notes. 
 


 
Figure 23
 
Source: http://www.vocera.com/ts/updates/rnotes/ReleaseNotes_vs_4.4.2.html
 
The Telecom Expert’s summary of the “known issues” and “known limitations” content is as follows:
 
These release notes constitute a sharp departure from the industry standard. VCRA has acknowledged
in the Release Notes that the Product has numerous signi�cant defects and that VCRA has not �xed
these defects. These do not appear to be new defects. Many of the defects we noted appear to have
existed for quite some time – at least since 2008. VCRA’s product should not have been available in the
marketplace.
 
The Telecom Expert has reviewed the Release Notes and has labeled these 5 items outlined below as
“defects” rather than “known limitations” and “known issues.” His complete detailed analysis of each of the 15
defects is provided in Appendix E to this report. Each of the defects is provided in a separate screenshot from
Vocera's website. The Telecom Expert’s comments are bolded and underlined and presented below the
screenshot for each defect.
 
Product defect #1
 


 
Product defect. This is a technically sophisticated way of saying that the Vocera system does not allow
devices being used on the system to “roam” from one WiFi hotspot to another without dropping its
connection to the system.  You cannot have a commercially viable wireless product that does not
allow you to go wherever you need to go throughout a hospital without dropping calls etc. This is a
mobile product that restricts mobility. The point of wireless is mobility.

Product defect #2
 


 
Product defect. This is similar to a frozen screen on a laptop. However this is a lot more dangerous. In
this instance, the device is used to help professionals provide urgent care in life and death situations.
 
Product defect #3
 


 
Product defect. The product simply doesn’t work seamlessly when you walk from one building to
another. By the company’s own description, the performance drops while the device searches for an
open channel. In the normal course of using a modern wireless device no manual intervention should
be necessary to create a connection. Software should scan for open channels automatically.
 
Product defect #4
 


 
Product defect. Device and network fail to accurately capture and identify the voice of the subscriber.
There isn’t a fail-safe way to verify that someone is who they say they are. This opens up a long list of
questions related to patient privacy compliance laws, especially HIPAA. There are no safeguards
against misidenti�cation of the proper user. The VCRA voiceprint technology is inconsistent in an
environment where privacy is a regulatory requirement.
 
Product defect #5
 


 
Product defect. Call history has been around for 20 years. It is incomprehensible why call history is not
supported by VCRA.

XI.    -5.07% Combined Annual Growth Rate 2012-2015
 
VCRA is the epitome of a stalled, stagnant business that is ripe for a challenge by well capitalized competitors.
In our opinion, VCRA insiders know what is truly happening at VCRA – and they are not buying shares in the
open market. To the contrary, they are selling, and in our opinion - some of them are selling as fast as they
can.

Below are high level �nancials for each quarterly reporting period from January 1, 2012 through December
31, 2015.
 


 
Figure 25
 
Source: Various Form 10-Q and Form 10-K �lings at www.sec.gov
 
We noted that the only pro�table quarters reported by VCRA were in 2012. This time period happens to
coincide with the potential accounting fraud depicted by several former VCRA employees, including the
former Senior Director of Internal Audit and Compliance.
 
XII.    Summary and Valuation Discussion
 
VCRA has one product and one supplier for that one product. In the event market conditions change – and
they are obviously changing right now in our opinion – VCRA may not be able to adapt to the market’s
demands e�ciently and quickly. Competitors with robust product portfolios and diversi�ed supply chains
have a signi�cant advantage over VCRA right now. If VCRA encounters declining sales of its sole product, for
whatever the reason or reasons may be, VCRA will have no other revenue stream to support the decline in
sales for its current product.
 
Despite in-depth review and due diligence, we see no value in VCRA's technology, product portfolio, or other
assets, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents, for the reasons outlined in this report. On February
22, 2015 VCRA announced its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 totaled $116.8 million. As of
March 11, 2016 VCRA had 26,435,787 shares of common stock outstanding. We believe VCRA's common stock
is currently worth $4.50 per share (i.e. $116.8/26.4, rounded to the nearest half dollar).  Long term, and
possibly within 2016, we expect one of two outcomes for VCRA:
 
1.    VCRA will encounter an unrecoverable sharp decline in business for the various reasons outlined in this
report. We believe the most signi�cant impact in 2016 will be from the proliferation of new competitors who
are attempting to replace VCRA in hospitals by o�ering well-tailored apps on smartphones. If these apps
begin to take more marketshare - we note in our competitive review that they already have signed several
high quality customers - then current customers and potential new customers could either just select these
other competitors rather than VCRA or perhaps even worse, new customers may demand VCRA provide the
installation of its system for free or at a discount. Considering that there is potentially no or minimal install
cost for app competitors who make use of cellular connections or existing WiFi connections, VCRA may have
no choice but to o�er installations at heavy discounts or even for free. That would be a very costly
development – and VCRA may not have a choice but to accept the fact that is has to o�er a free or heavily
discounted installation. Negative cash�ow will begin to threaten VCRA’s continued existence if this begins to
occur.
 
2.    VCRA will attempt a sizable capital raise, diluting shareholders by at least 50% in our view, in order to
execute an aggressive turnaround plan that will include (1) a segregation and gradual disposal of its current

16-year old “patch-worked” WiFi-only platform, and (2) the design and commercialization of a modern
LTE/WiFi (system agnostic) platform to replace VCRA’s current platform.
 
VCRA’s cash burn increase due to reasons mentioned in this report include but are not limited to competitive
pressures. In the event of either of the two outcomes listed above actually occurring, VCRA investors could
su�er signi�cant loses, either as a result of the stock price declining upon disappointing �nancial results or
through dilution.

Appendix C – Telecom Expert
 
The Telecom Expert is a mobile telecom systems expert who has developed and con�gured every generation
mobile technology networks from the most recent 5G developments, going back to the earliest digital
switching systems in the early 1980s. He is currently consulting to companies on potential 5G multi-Gbps
applications for �xed and mobile communication networks in the 3400-3600 MHz, 3700-4200 MHz, 14500-
15350 MHz and 27500-28500 MHz. These networks are expected to eliminate distinctions between what we
now know as cellular, dispatch, WiFi, and cordless phones for businesses and consumers. He was part of the
AT&T Network Systems division, which became Lucent and is now Alcatel. He developed Class 4/5 switching
applications for the 5ESS-2000 version that power half of all voice calls in North America. He also installed the
�rst Nortel DMS-100 switches which supported the early Intelligent Network functions (AIN, CS1-R, ETSI INAP).
He was once the technical coordinator of interoperability between mobile networks in the U.S. and other
countries on behalf of North America. He developed many VoIP applications that run on Cisco ATA and
SIPURA SPA-2000 using SIP protocol on a broadband connection.

Appendix E - 15 Known Defects
 
Our Telecom Expert has reviewed the Release Notes and has labeled these 15 items outlined below as
“defects” rather than “known limitations” and “known issues.” His complete detailed analysis of each of these
defects is provided below. Each of the defects is provided in a separate screenshot from
http://www.vocera.com/ts/updates/rnotes/ReleaseNotes_vs_4.4.2.html. The Telecom Expert’s comments are
bolded and underlined and presented below the screenshot for each defect.
 


 
Product defect. This is a technically sophisticated way of saying that even when a user chooses a
smartphone over the VCRA device, you cannot move in any direction you choose at any speed you
choose without losing connectivity. You cannot have a commercially viable wireless product that does
not allow you to go wherever you need to go throughout a hospital. This is a mobile product that
restricts mobility. The point of wireless is mobility.
 


 
Product defect. This is similar to a frozen screen on a laptop, but a lot more dangerous. In this
instance, the device is used to help professionals provide urgent care in life and death situations. With
the smartphone app, this also represents a violation of Android and Apple policy. Both Apple iOS and
Android phones have strict rules against apps that interfere or prevent incoming and outgoing calls or
texts. VCRA’s apps run the risk of being removed from iTunes and other app stores as a result.

Product defect. The product cannot roam from one location to another seamlessly without losing
connectivity. VCRA needs high system reliability and quality of service levels to sell to hospitals. They
simply do not have either.
 


 
Product defect. The product simply doesn’t work seamlessly when you walk from one building to
another. By the company’s own description, the performance drops while the device searches for an
open channel. In the normal course of using a modern wireless device no manual intervention should
be necessary to create a connection. Software should scan for open channels automatically.
 


 
Product defect. Device and network fail to accurately capture and identify the voice of the subscriber.
There isn’t a fail-safe way to verify that someone is who they say they are. This opens up a long list of
questions related to patient privacy compliance laws, especially HIPAA. There are no safeguards
against misidenti�cation of the proper user. The VCRA voiceprint technology is inconsistent in an
environment where privacy is a regulatory requirement.
 


 
Product defect. Incomplete or misunderstood speech could have dire consequences in a hospital.
 


 
Product defect. Unresponsive hardware. High failure rates in life and death situations are simply
unacceptable. The professional needs to be able to grab the product and spring into action without
concern that the product is charged.
 


 
Product defect. This level of defect could impede the ability of the sta� to respond or carry out their
duties.
 


 
Product defect. Unresponsive hardware. The product should not have been released with this kind of
defect.

Product defect. Call history has been around for 20 years. It is incomprehensible why call history is not
supported by VCRA.
 


 
Product defect. This level of audio degradation compromises the ability of the user to interpret
information. This is a major risk in a medical care environment.
 


 
Product defect. This level of defect could impede the ability of the sta� to respond or carry out their
duties.
 


 
Product defect. This level of defect could impede the ability of the sta� to respond or carry out their
duties.
 


 
Product defect. This level of defect could impede the ability of the sta� to respond or carry out their
duties.
 


 
Product defect. Having to open two internet browser sessions at the same time to accomplish one
task is just one more example of the numerous inexplicable defects that create barriers to VCRA
acceptance by IT administrators.
 
We consider these defects to be de�nitive. We see no basis for anyone to contend otherwise. While
conducting our research we identi�ed several other issues we considered as “defects.” However, we
did not have de�nitive evidence to support our claims and decided against presenting those defects
within this report.

A few comments. In general your report is sloppy, makes unfair intellectual leaps, and relies on mostly old
news/information. You neglect to mention that most of the products are new and the management team has
turned over. Details, details. Any particular reason why you chose to focus on the B3000 badge and not the
newer B3000n badge? The new product settles most of your criticisms. Also many of your defect criticisms
refer to use of the smartphone app implementation, not the badge, which is misleading as you present it. In
fact, your competitive comparison chart lists the same issue (no cellular network support for the badge),
several times, simply restating it in di�erent words (probably to make the list of “problems” longer)? And why
should we rely on the opinions of a “telecom expert” to assess the quality of a WIFI-based hospital product?
Frankly I’m confused by that one. Can you give us the international growth in constant currency? That was
probably a big headwind in 2015. But then again, why go into the details when you can present charts that
look incriminating. Most of your years-old "accounting fraud" criticisms sound more like business as usual in
enterprise software as opposed fraud. Isn’t backlog intended to smooth results? That’s why investors pay
premium multiples for software companies like Vocera. I think many companies pull in business late in the
quarter, no? Either you’re a poor writer or you felt the need to type accounting fraud 3 times in each
sentence. You can say it repeatedly, but your text gives no actual evidence. Where’s the fraud in 2016? Listing
years-old cumulative net operating losses is not a valid current short thesis. That’s the old news, welcome to
the new cash �ow positive reality. You say that doctors hate the product, but last I checked nurses are the
buyers (and users). Also, most of your critiques are from 2011 and 2013. Old product, old news. Today they
support smart phones and have a new badge (which you failed to disclose). Secure texting is not what they
sell. Saying there are lots of secure texting apps on the Apple Store is irrelevant. Secure texting is a feature
within their communications platform that integrates with the entire badge/smartphone ecosystem and
produces a full audit trail. That is not the same as a secure texting app. Really, can’t you do better analysis
than that? Yikes. Your criticism of the Franciscan win is that they didn’t vet products that you think they
should have. How do we get from that claim to “they use sales to uninformed customers to pump the stock?”
Motorola is no longer an investor because the relevant business was sold to Zebra…which is now one of
VCRA’s best partners. Google it. VC’s have sold a lot of stock since the IPO…of course they have, that’s what
VC’s do after an IPO. It’s kind of the point of an IPO. So, nice hatchet job. Classy of you to �ood the market
with put buys the last few days then release a scary-sounding article using outdated information and spurious
claims. Informed readers will dig deeper.


Editor Fri, 06/17/2016 ­ 12:47


Kris, thank you for your comments. Here is our response: 1. Which products are new exactly? What new
capabilities do these products have? We don’t believe VCRA has launched a signi�cant new product or
added signi�cant functionality to its product since 2011. Go ahead and show us otherwise. We’re happy to
continue the discussion. 2. We rely on a telecommunications expert in our report because WiFi is a form
of telecommunications. Is it not? 3. VCRA has had no international growth in recent years. If currency was
truly the reason why this has been the case then the management team should have explained such. We
don’t see this argument holding any water however. Currency declines have been signi�cant but we don’t
believe they have been signi�cant enough to justify your “guess” as to why there has been no
international growth. Ultimately, management promised and promoted international growth to investors
– and they didn’t deliver. If you can prove this is untrue please do. 4. Are you really suggesting accounting
fraud is ok just because of the sector VCRA operates in? Please elaborate on your position here if. We do
not see any scenario where accounting fraud is “ok” and “business as usual.” 5. Are you suggesting
investors pay a premium multiple as a result of accounting fraud? What?! 6. You don’t consider
corroborating statements by 4 former employees, one of whom was the Senior Director of Internal Audit
and Compliance, to be substantial evidence? What?! 7. Are you suggesting fraudulent acts are ok as long
as they aren’t detected shortly thereafter? 8. You are right we did provide some evidence about nurses

hating VCRA’s product that was a bit outdated. Please see our new report. We corrected this issue and
provided more recent evidence of hatred of the product. 9. You did some great analysis of VCRA’s “secure
texting” features. The point here is if VCRA is the only company that provides this? We are doubtful that is
the case. 10. Selling products to an uninformed customer then releasing a press release about it being a
big win is a pump – in our view. Perhaps you disagree. We welcome your further thoughts on this. 11.
Motorola’s sale to Zebra was a business decision. Motorola’s sale of VCRA was an investment decision. We
don’t see the direct, simple, connection between the two that you suggest. 12. We do not believe VC’s sell
their stock in every company they invest in once an IPO occurs. We believe investors, whether VC or
others, sell their stock when they believe the time is right, and an IPO is not necessarily the right time to
sell. We welcome any data you have to suggest our view is o� base. 13. We believe the only information
that could be reasonably viewed as outdated were the nurse complaints we provided previously. Our new
recent report has more current evidence of hatred of VCRA’s product. We wish you the best. However, we
suggest you sell your VCRA shares. There is no hope for this company given the competition it now faces
and the obsolete, defective product it o�ers.

Vocera has an app for communication - - Vocera Communication Suite - - that works on iOS, Android, web
browser, and Apple Watch. York research is �awed and misleading. Please post a correction. Thank you.


Editor Fri, 05/27/2016 ­ 03:58


Yes, correct. We acknowledge VCRA has an app for communication that works on iOS and Android. See
Figure 8. How is our research �awed and misleading? We welcome a discussion.
