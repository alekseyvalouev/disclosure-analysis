What’s Behind China Sky’s Weight-Loss Patch
Sales and Gross Margin Claims. FTC says
“Products worn or rubbed on the skin do not
cause weight loss.”


Posted on June 8, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) states in its 10-K that


its weight-loss patch product, the Sumei Slim Patch, is “believed to


foster weight loss and prevent weight gain.” The Sumei Slim Patch


comprised 22% of China Sky’s total sales in 2008, according to the


company’s fourth quarter earnings conference call.


There have been many reports of customers buying China Sky’s


Slim Patch complaining that the product was ineffective and even


caused adverse reactions such as a skin rash. China Sky’s operating


company has also been cited for violations of advertising rules


related to its promotions of the Slim Patch and other products. See


report. Research on the substances in the Slim Patch and similar


products likewise raises questions about the patch’s safety and


efficacy. These questions only add to doubts about the company’s


reported sales and 76% overall gross margin.


The only description China Sky provides of the Slim Patch’s active


ingredient is as follows: “The Sumei Slim Patch uses Saponin,


believed to regulate and restrain the excessive secretion of certain


hormones, while promoting others.” A chemical analysis of the


patch reveals only that a potential component of a saponin may be


found in the patch.


Saponins are a class of chemical compounds found in various plant


species. The potential saponin component in the China Sky patch is


mixed in a gel with other chemicals to enhance penetration of the


skin. If the potential saponin component is able to actually reach


cells inside the body, the other chemicals in the patch would also be


getting into cells.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) banned a company from


selling weight-loss patches in the U.S. in 2007, stating “Products


worn or rubbed on the skin do not cause weight loss.” (See FTC


press release, complaint, and court order). The company censured


by the FTC, Transdermal Products International Marketing


Corporation, sold a transdermal patch for weight-loss with a


purported main ingredient of sea kelp.


Again, the FTC stated firmly, “Products worn or rubbed on the skin


do not cause weight loss.” There are unproven suggestions that


orally-ingested saponins may be able to cause some effect on


digestion by stopping the intestinal absorption of dietary fat


through inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity. Pancreatic lipase is an


enzyme that breaks down fat molecules for digestion. Inhibiting


pancreatic lipase activity means preventing a person’s digestive


system from breaking down fat.


If you want an FDA-approved method for inhibiting pancreatic


lipase activity, there are prescription and over-the-counter drugs


currently available in the US and China that are clinically tested.


The prescription drug Xenical, also available in OTC form under the


brand name Alli, is a lipase inhibitor and has been FDA-approved


and marketed in the US since 1999. Xenical has been available in


China since 2001.


Despite China Sky’s promotion of the Slim Patch, and claims of


expanding sales of the patch into other countries (even, quizzically,


the famine-prone African nation of Sudan), the future of China Sky’s


key product looks questionable.
