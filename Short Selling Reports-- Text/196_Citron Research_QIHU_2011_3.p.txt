Note to Readers:  The intent of this research is not


to cause short term volatility in the trading of the


stock.  Citron believes the following research is


worthy to be placed in the public domain so all


investors can make investment decisions based on


reading and considering carefully all available


information.


 


Citron has developed a tremendous
volume of forensic research on Qihoo
360 (Nasdaq:QIHU), and has concluded
that the company has either not been
forthright about their revenue model to
Wall St., or there is a financial fraud
unfolding.


Citron has received numerous
comments on its previous writings on
Qihoo, mostly to the effect that "Citron
doesn't understand. " "Citron doesn't
understand China", "Citron doesn't

understand the internet" …"Citron
doesn't understand the future", etc.


One thing Citron does understand is
math.  Math is universal: 
1 + 1 = 2, in the US, Antarctica, Mars,
and yes, China.  And Qihu's numbers
don't even come close to adding up …
in any universe.


   Can Qihoo's Topline Revenue
Withstand any Analytical Scrutiny?


 


QIHU reported 47.5 million USD in topline revenues and


guides next quarter to 55 million USD.  What do we know


about these revenues?


The company states that 75% of its advertising revenue is


generated on its homepage hao.360.cn.  It further states


that appx $4 million was generated from referring search to


Google.

   $20.9 million and the missing
number


What we know:  Homepage advertising link revenue is


the largest component of Qihoo's revenue.  The Company


sells links on this page on a fixed fee per month basis.  The


company states that the fees vary based on the customer's


business type.  Yet it was extremely challenging to find the


single most important metric :  The average
advertising revenue per paid link.


We read everytning we could find on Qihu, to
no avail.  But finally, in a single analyst report
by Macquarie (the only one that seems to
reflect any detailed knowledge of the
company's actual business model)  we read:


“The average advertising price for a link on
Hao.360.cn’s front page is RMB 200-250 K
per month.”
5/18/2018 Qihoo : Fraudulent Financials,Terminal Business, Or Both….You Decide. Citron maintains price target of $5 – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/qihoo-maintains-price-target-of-5/ 4/21


This was published on August 29th, and notes it was after


"the company raised its ad prices by 20% – 25%


sequentially in Q1 2011".  Of course an average is an


average — some links will be be priced higher, and others


lower.  To make the math easy we will run the estimates on


$225,000 RMB per month, a little more than $100,000 USD


per paid advertiser per quarter. 


It is easy to see what sites are paid because they have


tracking URL's attached to them; thereby the advertiser can


judge the effectiveness of the campaign.  Links such as


Hotmail, Vogue, CNTV sports, are displayed, as in all the


Chinese directory home pages, for free, for user


convenience.  Citron has made a heat map so investors can


see how many links on the HAO.360.CN page are tracked,


untracked, or lead to another 360 company page.  Here is


the current hao.360.cn [https://hao.360.cn] homepage,


which generates for 75% of Qihoo's ad revenue. 


GREEN:  Tracked Link to a 3rd party website. 
RED:  Link to another 360.cn or qihoo.com page – a
Qihoo company page 


YELLOW:  Untracked link, presumed free.


With this key, lets look again at QIHU's homepage again:

There are appx 92 green links on this page; however many


are duplicates and dispatch clicks to the same domain. 


Eliminating links to Google (paid separately) and Baidu,


there remain appx 60 – 65 links with tracking IDs to the

Qihoo's revenue; presumably these are at the high end of


the scale of revenue per link.)


This is what we assume are the paid links.  UBS verifies


this by publishing a list of Qihoo's paid links in its Nov 17th


note, totaling about 65.  UBS includes several untracked


links in their list, but for now let's not quibble about details.


 UBS's list very closely matches the spreadsheet we


compiled with all the links from the hao.360.cn homepage


here:

An interview with competitor 2345.com
confirmed that around 60 links on their
homepage are sold and they believe the same
to be with their competition.

So now we try to construct a picture of Qihu's

Exactly where is the $20 million in

anything even close to it??


We expect the company will now claim that
many of the non-tracked links are paid.  This
would be very challenging to believe, as
anyone paying real money for a link would
want to track the traffic generated.  And we
would need an additional 130 paid
advertisers on the home page.  WHO ARE
THEY?  (We wanted to ask this pivotal
question on the conference call but the
company would only take questions from
their “cheerleading” analysts.)

Neither the company nor any of its analysts,
nor any of the numerous mainline ad
agencies in China nor any of Qihoo's
competitors have have EVER quoted an
advertising rate for a web traffic link in China
within an order of magnitude of this
astronomical number. 


   And now the 7 million in ad
revenue that doesn't come from
the homepage
 


 


Now we try to construct a picture of Qihu's
non-homepage and non-game revenue (the
other 25% of advertising revenue ):   Citron
was able to procure a contract for a non-home
page link.  We were quoted a rate of $20,000

within expectations, as rates fall off rapidly

and cannot come anywhere close to a number
approaching 700.  Some of the 360.cn linked
pages have only one customer…or none.


    But the "Games" Do Not Stop
There!


Qihoo runs a game directory page, which is extremely


similar in appearance to those run by many major

competitors, for example Sohu and RenRen:

Sogou: http://wan.sogou.com/ [http://wan.sogou.com/]


Qihoo:  http://wan.360.cn/ [http://wan.360.cn/]


What isn't similar is the astonishing revenue per customer


Qihoo claims in their last quarterly report.


"Within IVAS, web games revenue were $9.7
million, up 187% from same period last year and
47% from the prior quarter. The strong
performance was driven by a large user base on
our web game platform."


"At the end of the second quarter, we have about
62,000 paid game players. At the end of the third
quarter, we have about 87,000 paid game users."

These revenue numbers are simply absurd.   Nobody in


the games business, in China or the US or anywhere,


generates $53.00 per month per paying customer – not

vendors report ARPU's appx $3 to $8 per month USD. 


Zynga generates about $1.00 to $4.00 per month per


paying customer, depending on which number you


compute.  Even the "gold standard" Blizzard International,


whose World of Warcraft is in a league of its own for online


gaming, charges US and European gamers, who typically


pay far more than Chinese gamers, $15/month for


subscription.


And nobody in China is growing games revenues at 47%


quarter over quarter.  For comparison, RenRen, one of the


hottest properties on the internet, grew games revenue at


26.3% year over year, and Shanda, one of China's largest


game companies, increased revenue just 3.7% quarter


over quarter. 


Like the advertising revenue numbers, these numbers are


simply not believable either.  Yet the analysts simply nod


and offer the perfunctory "great quarter, guys!"


Citron has no idea how the company will even attempt to


explain this glaringly unbelieveable revenue per player


number.  Too bad not one analyst on the call even asked


about it!


Why does Qihoo make it impossible
to verify their web traffic claims?


 


Citron has presented a compelling case as to
why the current business of QIHU can be
questioned.  Yet, the multiples afforded to
the stock by analysts are obviously not based
on their current business but rather their
future business, which is all predicated on
the web traffic generated from their
homepage — both in its generic and
"personalized" forms. 


Even though the analysts don't agree on how Qihoo will


generate money in the future, the one thing they all agree


on is that its current revenue depends solely on internet


traffic generated through its website.  Therefore the


company should be taking extra steps to clarify and make


transparent 3rd party verification of the reach, penetration,
5/18/2018 Qihoo : Fraudulent Financials,Terminal Business, Or Both….You Decide. Citron maintains price target of $5 – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/qihoo-maintains-price-target-of-5/ 14/21


and page views they claim. But instead, the company does


the opposite.


Citron first challenged Qihoo's hao.360.cn homepage traffic


claims because the industry standard measurements of


internet traffic – including Alexa, Google, CNZZ,  and


Comscore — all report ranges of lower penetration, reach


and traffic rankings than the company's paid-for statistics


from iResearch.  The company's defense was that "Citron


doesn't understand" the internet —  because the
company's anti-virus software prevents all analytic
tools from being installed on a users computer.


All tools except of course those from iResearch and their


200,000 sample size.


Wait a minute!  What kind of excuse is this?  How is it


that Qihoo's software coexists with iResearch's monitoring


tool, but can't coexist with Alexa?   Does anyone seriously


consider Alexa's voluntarily installed toolbar to be


malware?  Like all anti-virus software, Qihoo's anti-virus


updates the desktop without user intervention, so the


company could easily change its software to make it


Alexa compatible any time it wanted.  The fact that the


company actively prevents any independent verification of


web traffic metrics remains a huge red flag for this


company.  This is not Citron's issue, it is Qihoo's issue.  In


the real world, this limitation would impose a huge obstacle


for a coompany trying to sell web advertising.


This should make any interested investor question the


depth of the relationship between iResearch and Qihoo. 


   What business is Qihoo in?….a
terminal one.


Each of the analysts covering Qihoo seems to
present a different idea of what business Qihoo
is in and where the company is headed.  One
says its "mobile" (which won't be monetized
before 2014), one says it's "search" as though
they operate in a fantasy world where they
could turn on a switch and compete with
Baidu.  Another says it's going to operate an
app-store with an interface copied from
iPhone.  The only thing these three strategies
5/18/2018 Qihoo : Fraudulent Financials,Terminal Business, Or Both….You Decide. Citron maintains price target of $5 – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/qihoo-maintains-price-target-of-5/ 15/21


have in common is that all of them currently
generate zero revenue for Qihoo.


Citron will not address search, mobile, or
desktop platform because the company has
generated no revenues nor presented any
notable proprietary technology.  The analysts
involved in the name do not even have a
cohesive story as to where this company will be
in 3 years — every analyst describes the
company's future differently. 


The truth is Qihoo's revenues come nearly
100% from what can only be called "Web
Directory Services".  They devised a clever low-
cost strategy to give away anti-virus software
as an indirect method to entice internet users
to their home page.  But they generate no
revenue from the anti-virus software, and no
revenue from their browser. 


But this model — "get in front of the eyeballs" 
— is hardly new.  We can observe the same in
the early days of the internet in the US, where
the gold rush was on for eyeballs and clicks,
and of course Wall Street's dollars. 


AltaVista, Lycos, Excite, anyone?  Does anyone
even remember these web directory
businesses?

Billions of investors' dollars went into them, all
of which was vaporized.  Why?


Because they provided neither durable content
nor services, they quickly ebbed into the
background.  They were mostly a short-run and
shallow land rush to "get in front" of the user's
internet experience.  Look at what happened to
the US Web Directories — they are a virtual
internet graveyard.  Even Qihoo's biggest
cheerleader Mirae says:

“Our assumption is that PSP will run out of
momentum by the end of 2012.” 


So where does that leave Qihoo?


   Analyst Malpractice
 


Citron has commented on the incredibly shoddy analyst


work on this stock, but in our opinion, the work of Mirae


goes even farther, to professional malpractice.   For a firm


that writes glossies on QIHU nearly every week, we find


the most disturbing pattern of promotional claims without


foundation that we have ever seen from an investment


banking firm. 


Mirae will probably want to comment on this piece as well,


so we thought we'd offer them some topics to address.  


Mirae has raised its 2013 topline revenue estimates for


Qihu twice just in November. 


This topline number which includes no breakdown or


financial basis looks like this:

The Mirae analyst's work reveals the following
gross deficiencies:


Provides no breakdown or foundation of the
prediction of massive revenue gains for Qihoo
in 2012 or 2013.


Completely ignores the red flag inconsistencies
in Qihoo's current reported revenue, the lack of
transparency in how the revenue is generated,
the gross discrepancies in Qihoo's claims of
reach and penetration vs industry standard
metrics from Comscore, Alexa, Doubleclick and
CNZZ, and ignores the crazy ARPU in Qihoo's
games revenue


Completely ignores that China e-commerce
was grossly disappointing in 2011; investments
have collapsed due to gross revenue shortfalls,
massive losses, lack of fulfillment
infrastructure, low demand of Chinese
consumers wary of poorly made counterfeit
products that they feel the need to inspect
before buying, and other obstacles.  See the
charts of DANG and MCOX – both down 80%
year to date. 


Displays a clear and fundamental
misunderstanding of Qihoo's business.   
Unfathomably, in the November conference

call, despite management having made
perfectly clear that their revenue is derived
from selling links on its homepage on a
negotiated fixed-fee-per-month basis, Ms.
Nancy Yang, Mirae's internet / media analyst,
asks:


"Firstly, can you help us get a sense how much of
your fourth quarter revenue guidance will come
from growth in users and growth in per click per
user? It seems that growth in per click per user is
much faster than growth in monthly active users,
should we expect this trend to continue? "   (She
got her answer in Chinese)


Instead of analysis, Mirae publishes screen shots of
a mockup of a yet-unreleased Google product and
claim that because Qihoo has hired an unidentified
former senior Google employee, that Qihoo will be
able to monetize this unreleased technology in
2012.   Note that the product sketch simply
clutters up the user's screen with more ads –
exactly the opposite strategy of Qihoo's
homepage.  The mockup's main feature is a
product price comparison, which would itself be an
anathema to Qihoo's main e-commerce advertising
customers.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has a
long history of regulatory enforcement actions


against analysts and other 3rd party enablers of
stock promotion who issue "baseless or
unfounded revenue projections".  Literally
dozens of regulatory links against firms and
individuals for this practice have been filed over
the years.  Here are just a few examples:

Citron believes Mirae Research is publishing thinly
disguised reports on Qihoo that are in fact
promotional materials masquerading behind the
appearance of "analyst coverage", and is worthy of
immediate SEC enforcement scrutiny for stock
promotion activities.


   Conclusion


Based on the data presented above, and the
interviews we conducted to gather it, it is Citron's
belief that Qihoo's current web directory business
is generating far less in revenue than the company
is reporting. 


Its presence in China's web market is, by the
company's own choice, opaque to third party
metrics.  Its advertising links are sold only by a
small sales staff, not any of China's many agencies
that would represent major advertisers.  There is
no pricing transparency.   There is no media kit,
typical of major online advertising providers.  We
are told that their rates are soaring, but e-
commerce revenue and investment in China is
currently being crushed due to brutal price
competition and logistics pressures.  We are told

there is an "auction process" driving ad rates
higher, but there is no auction functionality.  In
short, nothing about Qihoo's main line of revenue
is independently verifiable.  That was a common
problem among several dozen US-traded China
stocks halted and delisted in the last year. 


But even if Qihoo's revenues were reported
accurate to the penny, the company is still
overvalued by a factor of 4 or 5 x. 


Analyst claims that Qihoo could be in search, or
could be in mobile, or could be a leading app store,
are patently ridiculous.  Qihoo has no more claims
on those highly competitive spaces than Citron.  It
is pure fiction.  Qihoo is no more likely to be able
to compete with Baidu in search than Microsoft's
money-losing attempt to compete with Google. 


What Qihoo does have is a web directory, which
competes with other web directories for
advertising dollars.  The company's topline would
have to double and double again just to grow into
its current valuation.


You could say that the last standing monetizable
"directory" in the US is Yahoo.  Of course Yahoo
offers a lot more than a menu to web services, it
has tons more content than Qihoo.  But even so,
when you strip out its other equity positions, the
multiple afforded by the market for its advertising
revenue is about 1:1.  For Qihoo, we're talking
14:1 or higher (even if you believe their highly
questionable numbers).


If Qihoo makes sufficient metrics
available to allow independent
verification of its claimed web
penetration and reach, and if Qihoo
were to provide transparency to its
advertising revenue sources so that a
credible revenue model could be built,
Citron would generously afford a 2:1
multiple on its current revenue run rate
to the company.  This plus the
company's cash yields a price target of
appx $5.00 per ADR.

Cautious Investing to All.


Note to all readers :  This report is not to be
misunderstood as Citron holding any antipathy
toward China or China investments.  Citron
believes the China investing space (especially
China-domiciled companies trading in US markets)
are subject to extreme risks due to the absence of
independent 3rd party verification and regulatory
remedies for corporate misbehavior at all levels. 
This condition is similar to the US market before
the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, which set
the standard for investor protection that underpins
the US equity market.  There will be successes and
failures in this space, and as the market matures,
the worst ones will tend to be washed out. 


Disclaimer:  As of the date of publication, the
editor of this report is short QIHU for the reasons
stated above, and long SINA and SOHU.
