Evidence Proves SCEI Chairman Fabricated Production Videos
May 9, 2011 2:59 AM ET110 comments
by: Alfred Little


Editor's note: On May 11, Sino Clean Energy published information on its website in
response to questions raised in the article below (see here). On May 12, a second
Seeking Alpha contributor examined Mr. Little's evidence and the company's, and drew his
own conclusions (here).


:::::::::::::


On May 3 , Sino Clean Energy (NASDAQ: SCEI) Chairman Baowen Ren published a
letter to shareholders in which he attempted to rebut four months of video surveillance of
SCEI’s three coal water slurry fuel (CWSF) factories that showed little or no production. At
the core of Ren’s rebuttal were 10 days of his own security camera videos from SCEI’s
Tongchuan plant, spanning April 20  – 29 .


I spent last week conducting a thorough analysis of Ren’s videos and uncovered two
absolute proofs they were filmed sometime after the dates he claimed. My findings
detailed in this report prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the production activity in
Ren’s films was staged.


First Proof: Ren Installed the Security Camera After the Fact


IFRA surveillance of SCEI’s Tongchuan facility began in January and continued up until
April 26 . Ren claims his videos were shot by his security camera and time-stamped from
April 20  – 29 . Did Ren really have a security camera installed on those dates? It is
certainly not visible in any of the IFRA surveillance footage through April 26 .


The following time-lapse still was taken on April 26  at 7:45am:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/268659-evidence-proves-scei-chairman-fabricated-production-videos 2/34


Zooming in on the factory itself, there is no sign of a security camera:


From these pictures and dozens more in the IFRA archive I reviewed I questioned
whether Ren’s camera even existed. So to find the truth I sent one of my investigators to
secretly photograph the factory on May 7  to get a closer look. To my surprise, the
investigator found a large security camera attached to the buiding as shown below:

Here is a close up of Ren’s new security camera (the wire connecting the camera is also
visible):


Since Ren's security camera does not appear in any of the IFRA images, he did not install
the camera until sometime after 4/26 and probably after 4/28, the date I published my first
report (link here). Therefore his production videos from 4/20-4/29 could not possibly have
been filmed on the dates he claimed since he had no camera set up on those dates. Why
then should anyone believe his videos are real?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/268659-evidence-proves-scei-chairman-fabricated-production-videos 4/34


A sample screen shot from Ren’s April 23  video is below:


You can tell from the angle of the camera that this video was filmed from the new security
camera attached to the building as seen in my May 7  image. However, on April 23  no
such camera existed. This video and the other videos must be fake.


Second Proof: Most of Ren’s Videos Were Filmed in the Rain. What Rain?


This is easy to prove. Let’s start with easiest video to debunk, the 4/23 14:08 camera 1
video, a still from which is shown above. The ground is all wet. The same soaked scenery
is apparent in the 4/23 08:55 camera 1 video that morning. Why was it raining in Ren’s
videos? April 23  was a bright and sunny day in Tongchuan without a drop of rain
according to the official record of the Tongchuan City Meteorological Bureau (interview
transcript here and recording of the call here). IFRA’s surveillance video of the bright and
sunny April 23  (linked here) showed no rain. No trucks appeared either. The Tongchuan
plant again showed little or no signs of production.


In fact the weather bureau staff reported absolutely no rain in Tongchuan after 4pm on
April 20  until 8am on May 1  when it rained until 8pm. If Ren’s videos are really from
April 20  – 29 , a period in which Tongchuan received no rain, why is there rain in 14 of
his videos? (the table below includes links to Ren’s videos I uploaded Vimeo to make
viewing easier)

* After heavy rain at 12:00am the ground was completely dry at 05:48am


Another serious inconsistency in the time sequence is the fact that the ground was dry at
5:48am on April 22  following heavy rain at midnight (April 22nd Midnight and April 22nd
05:48am). It is impossible for the ground to dry out that fast during the night!

Together the evidence proves Ren’s videos were not filmed during the dry April 20-29
period as claimed. I believe the only possible conclusion is that sometime after April 29
(the date in China he read my first report) Ren set up a security camera at the Tongchuan
factory, rented some trucks and staged production activities for the new camera in an
attempt to “debunk” IFRA’s surveillance record to get SCEI’s stock price higher. Ren’s
rainy videos were thus filmed on May 1 , when it rained from 8am to 8pm. The rest of
Ren’s videos may have been filmed a day earlier or a day after, but definitely not during
the April 20  – 29  period as he claims.


Further analysis of the videos:


IFRA’s video analyst notes that there appear to really be only 2 CWSF tankers in most of
the videos. In the 4/23 14:08 camera 1 video these two tankers appear to drive in circles
onto the scale. The 1 , 3 , and 5  tankers are the same truck. The 2  and 4  tankers
are the same truck. Loop the video for yourself a couple times and you can easily verify
this.


In addition to filming the weigh station, IFRA’s camera captures images of the factory,
itself. IFRA’s surveillance videos spanning January to April show the factory is always dark
at night, a fact verified by IFRA’s team at the beginning of the project.


During the first few weeks of observing the Tongchuan plant in January, IFRA field agents
determined the plant’s operating hours were 8am (when workers first showed up) to
around 6:30pm (when workers went home). After dark the factory is just that, dark. No
lights can be seen coming from the factory and no trucks pass through the scales. IFRA
let its cameras run until around 10pm in January and February and midnight in March and
April.


In addition to the rainy weather proof that Ren’s videos were fabricated, a comparison of
two of Ren’s night videos that appear to show production activity inside the plant are
contradicted by IFRA’s videos from the same time showing the plant was dark. Compare
Ren’s 4/21/11 21:42 Camera 2 and 4/26/11 20:15 Camera 2 to IFRA’s April 21st and April
26th videos. Ren’s videos appear to show production inside a lighted factory at night.
IFRA’s videos show darkness inside factory during the same times, each night.


Similarly, Ren’s following videos showing tankers being weighed on the scales are
contradicted by IFRA’s videos from the same time showing no tankers passing through the
scales:

All the facts I’ve shared in this report support my conclusion that Ren fabricated his
production videos. I believe IFRA’s surveillance videos remain the gold standard of proof
that SCEI produced little or no CWSF during four months of observation.


I encourage investors to check out 73 days of IFRA’s video surveillance I uploaded to my
SCEI Vimeo Channel.


Disclosure: I am short SCEI.

So far I see it's just nice photoshop work done by Alfred plus maybe one or two fake recording of the so called
weather expert.  
The evidences don't prove anything, so the company installed a new camera? So what? How do I know for sure it's
filmed from that particular angle? How do I know for sure there weren't another one inside the building or somewhere
else? It could be anything!  
As regarding weather expert, I don't know, maybe it was raining and maybe that proves that all your videos are fake? 
Are you kidding me that you really hired someone to hide in the bush filming the company for 4 months? Just for your
information, if I were a fraud nowadays, knowing someone may be filming me secretively, first, I'd hire empty trucks
running around all day long, second, I'd try to clean the parameters with gaurds. How likely is your video still effective

as proof? I dont' want to go into the details about how quickly the ground dries, I don't know the temperature, wind
speed etc, who knows? Your weather expert? Or the shop owner? 
But undeniable is that the company is expanding to Dongguan, why would they do that if they have nothing to do at
all? If I am not mistaken, this business has a small monopoly as transport costs and timeliness is key? No? So a little
healthy margin seems not too outrageous.  
I find the tax discussion much more interesting, but you didn't want to go there, I wonder why? I recall a discussion
you have with Lemmings? Looks like you lost on that one, no?

User 386985
Here is a question for you, the field operative got beaten up by company thugs, for spying, yet, the thugs are
so friendly as to give back the memory card and the camera? and allow the guy to come back tomorrow to
finish the god's job? Most likely the field operative will be detained and that's the end of it, surely wouldn't
come back again.


09 May 2011, 07:32 AM

I think Alfred said that they back up the cameras daily in case they are stolen. I believe he said camera's had
been taken. I'm also not sure if the beatings were in reference to SCEI or other scams. Actually, I don't think
he mention the particular company. It seems rather obvious that if individuals are involved with scamming
millions of dollars that they probably wouldn't sweat a bit of violence.


Has Arthur_Big even released her identity? It wouldn't change my opinion at all as to rather or not Alfred
should.

I guarantee you, once the farmer or the street kids found a hidden camera there, they will take it away home,
what they also will do, is come back next day to see whether there is another one. AL's story is getting funny

It doesn't look like a security camera. I think it is more like an alarm system. Also, the area doesn't look like an
operation area, therefore, the videos could't come from that "camera".

Not only that but the white building in both photos don't appear to be the same. The one from the company
photo has a green roof and Littles is all white. Not to mention the surrounding area doesn't look the same.


Thats the problem with all these 'stories' from Little. A lot of info can't really be substantiated.

is much more reliable than your accusations mister little.

The wet floor on the photo may not come from rain. I grew up in China. I know the government does street sweeping
every week using water tanker (at least in my home town and in the cities where I went to college and graduate
school); the street can get very wet. Alfred's piece doesn't prove anything.

Nostores - no surprise you defend a fellow geoinevesting crony.


I am pretty sure "alfred" has many alias that posts here so any one of them can respond as to why you lie about your
bio and identity.


My identity is irrelevant. I am not making accusations against anyone. I am just pointing out facts that you and your
friends are front running "hit pieces", manipulating securities, bribe officials and management for inside information,
and many more.


Alfred has no worries of being beaten up as management probably couldn't find him 1000 of yards away were
"IFRAs" video camera is as well as the fact that you guys all state you don't actually speak to management or visit
inside facilities. This came directly from the mouth of "whitetiger".


Also, we all know he doesn't do any work himself. He supposedly hires "IFRA" to do the work, despite the fact "IFRA"
doesn't exist either.

"I am pretty sure "alfred" has many alias that posts here so any one of them can respond as to why you lie about your

Are you suggesting i'm one of his many I.D.s? If that were the case I sure as hell wouldn't have been caught short
HRBN and ADY when he put out his bullish report on them.


"My identity is irrelevant. I am not making accusations against anyone."


Wow, you sure are delusional. What evidence do you have that he is bribing officials? You're a tool and anybody with
a few brain cells can tell.


09 May 2011, 08:49 AM


Arthur_Big
Ha. No, I am not claiming you are him. I am claiming you are cronies of his through your affiliation on geoinvesting.
You do defend him pretty strongly though.


I am not delusional. Sorry I said "officials" and that was inaccurate. He has stated publicly that he paid off clerks at the
government offices. I admit when I make a mistake. Bribing clerks for SAT and VAT tax filings is inside information. I
noticed you didn't try to argue the front running, manipulation, etc.


Maybe the store clerk that Geoinvesting claims is an expert in business and public filings will also get beat up as that
was a professionally done and factual piece of information. Did whitetiger threaten the starbucks cashier around the
corner after he confirmed you guys manipulate securities inside your office?

This news just out on Sino:


Press release from PR Newswire


Sino Clean Energy, Inc. Authorizes $20 Million Share Repurchase Program 
Monday, May 09, 2011


XI'AN, China, May 9, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- Sino Clean Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: SCEI) ("Sino Clean Energy,"
or the "Company"), a leading producer and distributor of coal-water slurry fuel ("CWSF") in the People's Republic of
China ("China"), today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the repurchase by the Company of up to
$20 million of its common shares over the next 12 months.


Baowen Ren, Chairman of Sino Clean Energy stated, "Based on current market prices, the repurchase program to
buy shares at what we believe are compelling valuations is in the best interests of our shareholders. Our Board of
Directors believes that the repurchase program is an effective use of cash to enhance value for our shareholders and
demonstrate our confidence in the long-term health and future financial performance of our business. Additionally,
share repurchases at Sino Clean Energy's current market value are highly accretive to the Company's EPS growth."


Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or
suspended from time to time without prior notice.


Sino Clean Energy reserves the right to approve the allocation of a greater portion of cash resources for additional
share repurchases in the future if the public markets continue to offer an opportunity to purchase shares at what the
Company believes are attractive valuations.

Also, alfred's bullish report is a method that all you "hit piece" guys are doing. Its called CYA. Clearly you don't want
the law to say you are just manipulating and front running only. So every once in awhile put out a positive piece.


Its a nice try, but it really doesn't work.

SCEI has: 
1. Auditors verify their business and monthly cash balances sent directly by the banks to the auditors. 
2. Verifiable large clients. 
3. Have paid taxes and this has been verified. 
4. Have cash way and above the secondary offering. 
5. Have commited Capex of over $50M with equipment even Alfred in his report agrees to. 
6. Has a CEO that is a member of many verifiable CWSF related organizations )China CWSF Research Center,
China Association of Environmental Protection, China Association of Low Carbon Economy, etc..) and was awarded
as one of Shaanxi top 100 entrepreneurs(10K). 
7. Has a CFO who was a Deloitte Senior member and the Assistant Financial Controler of Walmart in China.... 
8. Have continued investing in new buildings (what for if they are fake??). 
9. Are part of a known industry that is growing incredibly (why would they be the only ones not making a profit?). 
10. Get verifiable government subsidies (why would the government pay them if they are frauds?). 
11. Hired Ernst & Young to provide help with SOX 404 compliance (why would they if they are fake?)?


Now Alfred tried to argue the tax issues and was completely discredited in one of his Seeking Alpha article by a
poster named "lemming". (Just go to the past article and see how he gets nailed...Alfred is now arguing the weather
as well as the amount of trucks going in and out. Already, some have seen the inconsistencies between some of the
dates in the newspapers he holds up and the dates on the videos. He also argues the weather and cameras.....


Compare all this with the 11 points above. Do you think this company has at least a 50% chance of being legit? Well
lets take 50%. So if this company is legit, it is at least a $20 stock (EPS of say $1.40 * 14 times earnings). The
company is after all growing above 40%...so 14 times seems reasonable.


So if there is a 50% chance of this company being legit, the value of this bet is $10 (50% * $20). The upside is 5 times
your money. The downside is you lose it. Fear is the greatest impediment to making money. Don't become your own
worse enemy. You only lose if you sell. I see this as an amazing opportunity if you can look a the facts, try to calculate
probabilities and ignore your emotions....

Am I correct in understanding that Alfred Little is not saying SCEI is a total shell but is stating that SCEI is
dramatically overstating revenues?


If so, that should explain why the company continues to operate as any other company would. If the company
did not do many of the things you listed above they would not be a publicly traded stock. Not saying you are
wrong, just stating that some of things must be done.

Here is a link to a PCAOB audit inspection done in 2007. The PCAOB usually does not audit smaller firms
every year, so this may have been their last inspection.


"The inspection team identified what it considered to be audit deficiencies. The deficiencies identified in one
of the audits reviewed included a deficiency of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that
the Firm did not obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the issuer's financial
statements. That deficiency was the failure to perform appropriate audit procedures to test the allowance for
doubtful accounts."

Press release from PR Newswire


Sino Clean Energy, Inc. Files Formal Complaint Against Short Seller Attackers 
Monday, May 09, 2011


XI'AN, China, May 9, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- Sino Clean Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: SCEI) ("Sino Clean Energy,"
or the "Company"), a leading producer and distributor of coal-water slurry fuel ("CWSF") in the People's Republic of
China ("China"), today announced that it has commenced legal action against Geinvesting LLC, an individual calling
himself "Alfred Little", the owners of the web site called Seeking Alpha, and unidentified persons acting with, for or
through them. The suit seeks $55 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages resulting
from the defendants' fraud, defamation, and tortious interference with Sino Clean Energy's business relationships.


Baowen Ren, Chairman of Sino Clean Energy stated, "The malicious and fraudulent attacks on the Company by short
sellers seeking only to enrich themselves at the expense of our Company and its stockholders must stop. Trying to
correct their false and defamatory statements one by one apparently serves no purpose since these short sellers
clearly do not care about the truth. We warned the short sellers that we would not tolerate their continued fraudulent
attacks and if they do not stop we would pursue civil remedies and make appropriate complaints to law enforcement.
We intend to do both."

I think Sino should be taking aim at Rick Pearson as well, he is constantly writing negitive articles on Sino as well, and
appears to be associated with Alfred Little and Geo Investing as he tends to repeat their stories. This is such an
obvious short attack, I am pleased to see Sino going after these crooks. They are all going down and will be
entertaining to follow. This has never been a better time to buy Sino, I am not a fan of what they have done but I am
taking advantage of it now,,,,,,Buy Buy Buy, this stock is worth $15.00 easily and really should be trading north of
$20.00.

I must admit I am disappointed in SA for even publishing this. Since this isn't related to investing by any stretch of the

investors to buy or sell? But I don't find that valid since whose going to buy or sell shares based on a story/pictures
done by an amateur that hasn't been proven or disproved yet? It belongs on an amateur investigation site or
something of that nature.

Ren is his real name? I mean, come on, how do I know that's really his name? And, what about his "partner"

sikako?
Don't you think that AL has earned quite a bit of credibility with calls such as CBEH? I agree that if he'd post
under his own name, he;d be even more credible. However, at some point the track record can't be ignored, if
he keeps on nailing it, anonymously or not. 


10 May 2011, 08:22 AM


mfarm9
Sikako, in my opinion it's one thing to make comments such as "I don't like so and so's management" or "so
and so's conference calls are lousy." However, also just my opinion, it is a very, very serious leap to allege,
insinuate, whatever word you want to use, that there is fraud.


To accuse a company's management of fabrication, and I'm not a lawyer, could "rise to the level" of accusing
them of fraud. Or, accusing them of some legal term such as "negligently misleading statements," etc. This is
no place for that type of commentary. The courts, the SEC, etc. are where such serious allegations should be
pursued.


To allege in any forum that a company's management has in any way been less than honest with investors is
very serious stuff, and I certainly won't cross that line. If others care to do so, or to even "flirt" with doing so, is
their decision. But not me. If statements can be legally defined as "damaging" whoever makes them could be
in trouble. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.


11 May 2011, 04:53 AM


sikako?
mfarm9 --


I basically agree on the following point: If one makes allegations, one better be right. If one is wrong, the more
serious the allegations the greater the potential trouble. If one is wrong and makes money shorting and then
covering in the dip caused by false allegations, then one will really end up in hot water. This is how it should
be.


I disagree about whether this and other web sites are appropriate places for making well-founded allegations
backed by some evidence. I think they are, mostly because what other venues do the bears have?


I think there's a very strong built-in bullish bias in the system. The official Wall Street has very strong
incentives to be bullish and look the other way if they see red flags. Think about the broker research on the
RTO companies that had the auditors resigned, couldn't file audited financials, and were delisted. Was that
insightful? Did they work hard to investigate red flags?


In summary, I think the system will work better if the bears' views and evidence are broadcast more widely. I
wouldn't try to block any channel for those minority views when the bulls control the Wall Street system.

Sikako. I hear you. What you're saying makes sense. I guess maybe what I'm saying is I wish people would
tread a little more lightly because there's a potential for abuse wherein a person deliberately spreads
falsehoods, or, gives themselves credit for greater "investigatory powers" than they actually possess. But,
when push comes to shove everyone has the right to comment wherever they want to comment. Including
SA. And, AL may be completely correct in his assertions. I don't know. Regardless, good talking to you. And,
Happy Investing.

Given Seeking alpha is deservedly been named it two lawsuits along with the alias "alfred little" and geoinvesting in
the last you would think they would learn their lesson on dissemination of damning unproven information and
dissemination of pieces for the purpose of front running and inside information.


The legal system just needs to do what it needs to do to protect the average investor. The fraudulent activities
occurring on both sides should be investigated. Right now they are letting big money and the cronies putting out hits
for them run rampant through the streets while our hard working IRA money is evaporated by unfair tactics.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  AB that is ridiculous. SCEI, CBEH, PUDA, CCME, RINO, DEER, CGA, CHNG, among a dozen
others are the ones "evaporating" investors' IRA money. Myself and others are simply making this fact more quickly
apparent. Thanks to us you see dramatically fewer new scam RTOs being completed since we started exposing the
massive fraud in the sector.


10 May 2011, 08:29 AM

I think that AL is right and this expose of these fraud companies will reduce the number of new frauds backing
into shells in the US.


By the way, the same PRC scam was run in Singapore 2007. If you want to see the future of how this ends,
the script is available in the history books.

flags seriously.

This is illegal stock manipulation causing millions of losses to INVESTORS. Investors would be wise to sue not the
companies, but the short sellers. Our justice system is wise enough to punish the real criminals for the millions
investors have lost.

If you were so "innocently" reports frauds you wouldn't be shorting the stock. You will first sit on the stand and the
lawyer will show evidence that your report is false. You have no case against real evidence. They will show how much
you've made, and that the timing of the reports is strategic. It would be wise for other companies to sue the authors of
short attacks. Others who shorted the stock are safe, but the authors are guilty of stock manipulation. I don't envy you
right now. You're the lastest Bernie Madoff.

Alfred - are you really comparing yourself to this research piece and continually posting it? Are you nervous and feel
the need to show reference this research journal numerous times to make yourself feel comfortable?


With regards to that research and your case they are very different. That is short sellers getting sued for short selling.


What they will get you on is very very different and much much easier to prove. You are getting sued for front running,
manipulation, libel, and insider trading.


Those issues are easy to prove as you have been so adamant that you are "correct" that you post in the public
domain as your proof the same information that will incriminate you.


Is your boss geo willing to pay your legal bills? Or is seeking alpha?

As said, there could be another camera in the building which taped the videos and all your evidence about the
new camera is just that, a new camera.  
0.2 mm rain is rain, while you said "rain, what rain?".  
This is getting interesting, the company may come out with earnings any minute or could get halt any minute,
or they could start buying (once the earning is out) or you could come with another piece, I have to buy some
options and delta hedge them.  
Besides, just a general remark, transportation in China is chaotic, a lot of small operators don't have a
company but just trucks so that they don't pay tax, so it's hard to go that angle to prove anything.

Author’s reply »  Just check out the heavy rain in the April 27th night video, about 25 seconds into it you can really
see the drenching they were getting at the plant. Both my and Ren's discussion with the weather bureau confirmed
NO rain that date. <0.5mm on 21st-23rd is just nothing. Furthermore you can see rain at midnight on 22nd and then
dry ground at 05:48 less than six hours later. That is just impossible, unless Ren's team was drying the ground during
the night with the same hot air he's trying to pump into the stock.

As said, I am delta neutral but super long gamma, so I don't care which side it moves, as long as it moves.  
To play devil's advocate, and in the best interest of the poor retails who need to escape, let me just say the
following:  
1. there is nothing said about 27th by the weather expert, and if you ask him again now, he'd say it's possible
there could be showers ever now and then. He is not a credible witness. 
2. Ground could be dried in 6 hours or it could not, depends on the temperature and wind speed, do you have
those data?  
I'd appreciate you giving advanced warnings to protect the poor retails who have lost so much on those
scams already. If you could say for example in advance that you are coming with hit piece, at least some
could escape. You didn't do that, instead, you give it to institutionals first, they annihilated the stocks with
heavy loads, retail didn't know what hit them until it's too late. That's why I am against you, not necessary
your arguments.

Johnz - Retail longs had a lot of warnings. Waldo had referred to SCEI as a screaming fraud on the Yahoo
boards at least 2 months ago (don't remember the exact date). Maj at Geo investing mentioned that they had
found several troubling issues and that they were opening a short position a day or two before they even
released a summary of their findings. Maj then released early findings a day before their report to people
willing to pay a small fee, monthly fee equivalent to a transaction at most online brokerages. Maj then
released a high level summary of their findings the day or two days before Alfred's first piece. Alfred then
mentioned on at least 3 occasions on SA that he had more coming even after his first piece.

The inner workings of Alfred Little,Geoinvesting and John Does:


CHeck this out. Sound familiar? Options expire next Friday on Sino Clean and there are lots out there now with a
$2.50 strike price expiring next week.How does the scheme played by these “hit piece research” providers work?


I have laid it out below, but effectively by distributing "market moving" information pieces with the intent to move the
market hedge funds and sophisticated traders are able to profit at the expense of the retail and smaller investors.


----------------------... 
Timeline:  
1. Hit piece authors( Alfred Little, Geoinvesting) and their cronies put together a “hit piece” “research” piece based on
due diligence they claim they have done referencing public, non public, unconfirmed and unproven damning
information about a company. 
2. Hit piece authors and cronies distribute such information to their friends, subscribers, partners, etc.  
3. They all trade in the security based on the direction the report is intended to move the stock price of such
securities. To build a position to benefit from the market moving report they intend to release they:  
a. Short sell securities to other investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information they plant o
release. 
b. They sell call options to collect premiums to investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information
they plant o release. 
c. They acquire put options from investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information they plant o
release. 
4. They wait a few days to fully load up on such positions they are seeking to profit from.  
5. They release the “market moving” information to the market – including public, non public, unsubstantiated and
unproven malicious and damning information for the sole purpose of manipulating the share price in violation of SEC
Rule 10b-5, which causes the security plummet in value.  
6. They then either:  
a. Cover their short position shortly after report is out locking in hefty profits.  
b. They let the call options expire that they sold collecting healthy premiums. 
c. They exercise the puts and lock in healthy gains or sell the puts at a hefty premium to what they paid profiting
healthily. 
7. Then they go long the security as when the company responds with the facts the security is almost likely to recover
around 70% of its value in the market – profiting again from the average shareholder.  
8. After stealing money from shareholders as a result of their “market moving” information they disperse the market
they move on to the next security.  
This is a great model, only if it was legal.


I would thus expect Alfred Little and Geoinvesting to be putting out false statements on Sino Clean whenever there is
a threat of the stock price surpising 2.50, next week should be a week of spreading lies by Alfred Little and Geo.

Author’s reply »  The real timeline:


Timeline:  
1. Friends of small investors ( Alfred Little, Geoinvesting) spend months researching dozens of potential
fraudulent companies and focus on the worst cases, spending many more months doing surveillance and
gathering detailed evidence from public sources that anyone can access who speaks mandarin, lives in china
and with a little effort. 
2. Alfred/Geo don't share their work with anyone since it is costly and the short positions are crowded.
Sharing the gains while bearing the costs would be stupid. 
3. They all trade in the security based on the direction the report is intended to move the stock price of such
securities. To build a position to benefit from the market moving report they intend to release they:  
a. Short sell securities to other investors who failed to properly research what they are buying. 
b. They sell call options to collect premiums to investors that likewise failed to research what they are buying. 
c. They acquire put options from investors who failed to research what they are selling. 
4. They spend a month or so accumulating as much position as they can afford  
5. They release the truth to the market – which causes the security plummet in value as other investors
realize they've been "had" by the fraudulent company. 
6. They then either:  
a. Cover their short position shortly after report is out locking in hefty profits.  
b. They let the call options expire that they sold collecting healthy premiums. 
c. They exercise the puts and lock in healthy gains or sell the puts at a hefty premium to what they paid
profiting healthily. 
7. Of course they never go long the security, but instead short again if the stock bounces after management
spins more lies to defend themselves. Then Alfred/Geo debunk management's next round of lies and profit
again. 
8. After profiting from their well documented research and saving future investors from ever losing money on
the well documented scam, Alfred/Geo move on to expose the next Chinese RTO fraud.


This is a great model, legal, more effective than any govt regulator, and cost taxpayers nothing. Alfred/Geo
get rich and are heroes at the same time. Small investors learn to do more due diligence, never trust
banker/broker/analysts, IR firms, or Chinese RTO pumpers.


The one thing you got right is that I certainly have a ton more evidence piling up to publish proving SCEI is a
total fraud. But those dumb enough will keep holding it till its halted and to the pinks.


13 May 2011, 09:34 AM

So you are admitting publicly again to producing market moving research piece and working in concert with others to
drive the stock price down through such pieces all while front running such information.


And you claim that is not illegal. This is BY FAR the best post ever. Do you really think that you are above the law?

I must admit, I knew you had an ego, but now you are starting to act just like every other crook out there. You get
away with it so long that you believe the law doesn't care. So you start getting sloppy and defensive and then
throwing it right in the face of the law, while using Seeking Alpha to do it all.


This will be a fun one to watch once the regulators take action.

Nice attempt at a response is see I have struck a nerve, truth hurts doesnt it. You and your team at GEO may want to
get your investigative team to hit the bushes and get some camaras on this operation in Dongguan City for your next
release next Thursday or Friday or whenever you need the price come down below 2.50, timing is crucial as your
profits depend on it.


Press release from PR Newswire


Sino Clean Energy, Inc. Announces New CWSF Orders 
Friday, May 13, 2011


XI'AN, China, May 13, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- Sino Clean Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: SCEI) ("Sino Clean
Energy," or the "Company"), a leading producer and distributor of coal-water slurry fuel ("CWSF") in the People's
Republic of China ("China"), today announced that the Company signed two new orders for CWSF at its Guangdong
production facility in Dongguan city. Management expects to start delivering products for these one-year contracts on
May 20, 2011.


Sino Clean Energy's 300,000 metric ton ("MT") CWSF facility commenced production in January 2011. The company
expects these two new orders to total 38,400 MT annually:

CWSF in this market. With these two new orders, we now have 9 customers for 404,000 tons combined since we
commenced production in Dongguan this January. We believe this is only the beginning of a long growth cycle as
more users shift to environmentally-friendly energy sources such as CWSF."

How are you adding any value to the regulators?


You are front running hit pieces.


You want to do justice then do actual work, speak to actual management teams, run independent analysis and if you
find something materially different than SEC filings then report them. Don't manipulate the markets and profit at the
expense of the average shareholder.


You are no better than them.


Its funny - Madoff took the same approach. thought he was above the law and doing justice to people he thought were
lazy.


Now you are taking that approach here. Good luck to you when the situation gets told fully.

months for them to do anything? Meanwhile SCEI, CBEH et al keep bilking money from subsequent rounds of
investors. My way exposes the fraud immediately and saves future investors money.


The only way your thesis that I am "profiting at the expense of the average shareholder" makes any sense is
if my allegations are false. NO ONE has proven any of my allegations are false. You admitted so yourself.
Because if my allegations are indeed TRUE, then I am SAVING average shareholders money by stopping
fraudulent companies before they get bigger (ie. raise more capital).


13 May 2011, 07:01 PM


Arthur_Big
Whitetiger (i mean alfred Little) -


It is amazing that you think its ok to break the law, just because you are accusing others of breaking the law.
In actuality you profit immediately after front running your hit piece reports. When you manipulate the stock
downward stating rumors, creating fake volume, front running and trading on inside information, et al.


Due diligence used to be done in a manner that involved finding questions and questioning management and
the board on those questions - not just putting out a manipulative report to drive the market. Seeking alpha is
just the forum for you to do that.


In your process you don't care if its true or not. You profit the minute you manipulate the stock through your
manipulative reports and front running inside information. Don't forget the trading tactics that are utilized to
make the appearance there is more volume in the stock then there actually is to spook the market even more.


Definition of market manipulation is below.


Market manipulation describes a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market
and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a security,
commodity or currency.[1] Market manipulation is prohibited in the United States under Section 9(a)(2)[2] of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and in Australia under Section s 1041A of the Corporations Act 2001.
The Act defines market manipulation as transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial
price for a tradeable security.


15 May 2011, 09:16 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Your definition of market manipulation is particularly applicable to Chairmen who announce
they bought stock in the open market, but fail to mention that they bought the shares from friends who
credited back the proceeds to the Chairman. Or phony buybacks where the company only buys stock from
friends of the Chairman. We also know that prior to RTO many Chairmen "parked" stock with friends. In this
case the Chairman is just buying stock from himself. Understanding this form of manipulation might explain
many unusual buybacks, insider purchases and trading activity witnessed in CCME, DEER and SCEI among
others.

Alfred -


And your proof of this is where? If they do that it would be very similar to how you manufacturer volume after
your hit pieces. Yes you both would be committing fraud. I am glad you recognize that in some cases you are
both crooks. Makes me feel better that you at least don't deny your actions aren't legitimate as well.


16 May 2011, 07:16 AM


nostores
"And your proof of this is where?"


I don't know, maybe 4 months of video footage, maybe interviews with security guards, maybe weather
records, maybe stock certificates issued to Chinese investors, maybe SAIC filings. You're such a transparent
tool that I'm not sure why he even bothers to respond to you other than to point out just how ridiculous you
are. Whats funny is that you seem to think you're thoughts are important.


I especially liked where you asked EstlingKen on the yahoo message boards about what is insider trading
and what isn't. You claimed 4 things were and he responded that 2 of the 4 weren't and the two he suggested
were didn't even apply to Alfred so you dropped the conversation. I imagine that you've been losing most all
of your life but never realized it.


16 May 2011, 07:29 AM


Arthur_Big
Losing most all of your life? What are you referring to here? That doesn't even make sense.


EstlingKen is not the authorities, so sorry i didn't respond to his post.


Nostores - we all know you work for Geo so you should better represent in your comments as this didn't make
a whole lot of sense. Maybe you can speak to the bagel delivery man for the SEC and he can confirm if they
exist.


Insider trading, Front running, manipulation, and many more are illegal acts. I am going to enjoy watching this
case.


16 May 2011, 08:43 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
Look like it's time for AB to brush up his securities law. Uncovering more information through one's own
research/DD and trading on it is NOT insider trading. Just like how people spent time finding out RINO
fabricated customer contracts and trade on it before publishing their research findings, this is not insider
trading. I look forward to challenging you on topic in court.


Seriously AB, don't you have a day job other than going around, insulting people who makes valuable
contributions to this site? I can't remember the last time seeing your stating ANYTHING relevant to the SCEI
investment thesis (long or short). Same thing goes for all your meaningless personal attacks to authors of
other CBEH, SCEI, DEER, PUDA articles.

Again, it appears, other than the intention of hiding behind your alias to trash the authors who make real
contributions of investment ideas, you lack of the basic mental capacity to understand what material non-

To prove to the world that you're not just a clown, why don't you show your real identity and contact info, so

reseach???
I had this posted before and it was responded to and moved off this site by Little, you will read why he did this:


Options expire next Friday on Sino Clean and there are lots out there now with a 2.50 strike price expiring next week.


How does the scheme played by these “hit piece research” providers work?


I have laid it out below, but effectively by distributing "market moving" information pieces with the intent to move the
market hedge funds and sophisticated traders are able to profit at the expense of the retail and smaller investors.


Timeline:  
1. Hit piece authors and their cronies put together a “hit piece” “research” piece based on due diligence they claim
they have done referencing public, non public, unconfirmed and unproven damning information about a company. 
2. Hit piece authors and cronies distribute such information to their friends, subscribers, partners, etc.  
3. They all trade in the security based on the direction the report is intended to move the stock price of such
securities. To build a position to benefit from the market moving report they intend to release they:  
a. Short sell securities to other investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information they plant o
release. 
b. They sell call options to collect premiums to investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information
they plant o release. 
c. They acquire put options from investors that are then positioned to be harmed from the information they plant o
release. 
4. They wait a few days to fully load up on such positions they are seeking to profit from.  
5. They release the “market moving” information to the market – including public, non public, unsubstantiated and
unproven malicious and damning information for the sole purpose of manipulating the share price in violation of SEC
Rule 10b-5, which causes the security plummet in value.

6. They then either:  
a. Cover their short position shortly after report is out locking in hefty profits.  
b. They let the call options expire that they sold collecting healthy premiums. 
c. They exercise the puts and lock in healthy gains or sell the puts at a hefty premium to what they paid profiting
healthily. 
7. Then they go long the security as when the company responds with the facts the security is almost likely to recover
around 70% of its value in the market – profiting again from the average shareholder.  
8. After stealing money from shareholders as a result of their “market moving” information they disperse the market
they move on to the next security.  
This is a great model, only if it was legal.


Next Friday is a big day for Alfred and Geo, they will be trying to keep the stock below 2.50 and will be putting out
there made up reports to do so. This is big money for these guys at the expense of others.

For all the defenders, pumpers of SCEI stock and attackers of AL, all AL needs to do to destroy all your twisting is to
publish one picture a day from April 20-April 26, showing no camera was installed at the roof location. To date, SCEI
management and IR have yet come up with a valid excuse/spin to explain the fact they installed the camera to make
up some fake videos AFTER they've been publicly exposed. Not to mention the same trucks running in circles,
fabricated logo characters on companies in their videos, a million other things.

Alfred Littles and Geo


Sino just issued its results and stock is trading after hours at 2.76, Friday is coming and you do not want to be
squeezed here, It will be time to release your "Hit Pieces" before options expire on Friday.


You will all see here shortly, "Hit Pieces" will be coming out from Geo and Alfred and their team to get the price down
below 2.50 a share before Friday when option expire, they stand to lose a lot of money here. Timing is everything for
Alfred and he is trying to hold off as close to Friday as possible to release false claims against Sino, he does not want
Sino to have a chance to respond to his false claims before the Friday options expire.

Author’s reply »  Art Big and Reseach - FYI I directly challenged Joe Levinson (SCEI's audit chairman) to debate my
upcoming report with me before I published it. He promised to call me but then never did. Yesterday I again asked him
to contact me and he has not. So please make note that while I do not typically discuss evidence with criminal
management teams, I try hard to communicate with independent directors.


Separately I tried repeatedly the last two weeks to talk to SCEI's auditor. The audit partner in charge, Jim Tokryman,
repeatedly denied that he has anything to do with SCEI's audit. Weird. His secretary said he alone was handling it.

Now it'll be interesting to see how SCEI explain the fact that the logistics company that purportedly shipped 60%+ of
its 2010 sales volume does NOT even exist. The one logistics provider that shipped the rest 40% said they don't even
know SCEI. Looks like the shorts stand a great chance against the lying SCEI management and its stock promoters in
court. I like my odds, both making money and winning in court.

making useless blog posts? Sue us?

Allegations with out facts. Sounds like your research.


Yes I do believe you are affiliated to them.


I also believe you were very nervous by that fake press release this morning, which i had nothing to do with yet you
claim I did.


If I was speaking to the authorities why would I then impersonate them? That just wouldn't be right.

Allegations without facts? You're talking about the proven frauds such as RINO, CCME, CBEH, LFT, DGW, all
of which are now halted for investigation? Your charges and allegations surely make you fit perfectly with the
whole RTO fraud plot.


Why do you always start a conversation with a sentence that describes your own exact behavior?


Hey, why do you suddenly start dodging my questions, now that I pointed out your suspicious behavior before
and post today's fabricated SEC press release?


Oh btw, yes i was sooooo nervous about today's fabricated SEC press release, because I was afraid I wasn't
able to add to my short position in all these frauds that still exist in US markets with the help of people like
you. People like you REALLY helps when it comes to protect investors from frauds huh?

I only follow fraud on this side of the ocean. Fighting claimed fraud with fraud - classy..... Yet still illegal. Don't get too
nervous the press release was fake today that someone put out which was not me nor anyone i know, but I am betting
the you will see something soon.


To answer your questions: 
1) I don't 
2) Ask me a legitimate question?

Finally, Arthur_Big is not starting a comment with personal attacks such as "allegations without proof - just like
your research".

Sadly, you still haven't answered my question how come you repeatedly hinted us right before today's
fabricated SEC press release came out?


To answer your question, I do not worry about the fake press release at all, because I have nothing to worry
about. Your baseless charges and personal attacks against SA authors and research firms are based on your
flawed understanding about insider trading and material non-public information, as well as your intention to
twist facts as you repeatedly have shown.


To comment on your answers: 
1) That's still dodging my question 
2) Are you saying research firms should shut up and stop exposing frauds, so your bashing approach against
them will do a better job at protecting the investing public from stock frauds? And please kindly refer to the
20+ legitimate questions I've asked you in the past.

i only respond to your comments on my articles

Really? Where were your response to any of the valid question I kept asking? Hello?


I guess it doesn't matter now, it will all be worked out now that MW is suing some fraudster for defamation and
impersonation. Of course, I know that certain fraudster was not you, because you do a different type of fraud
like yourself said.

Arthur_Big, another legitimate question for you is how come you were able to hint and warn the research firms and
short seller authors, a number of times in various places on SA site, that "something" is about to happen to them, right
before today's fabricated SEC press release of a fake lawsuit against MW came out? You have dodged this questions
since it was first asked. Would you like me to point out the evidence of your prior knowledge and hints about this
morning's totally fraudulent piece?
