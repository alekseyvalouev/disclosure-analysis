United States Antimony Corp.: A Commodity Stock That Could Fall
80%
Aug. 23, 2012 9:00 AM ET33 comments
by: Ben Axler


United States Antimony Corp. (NYSEMKT:UAMY) is a former penny stock on the
bulletin board that is being promoted as a play on antimony, a must-own commodity that is
in short supply. In reality, demand for antimony remains constrained, and the company has
never shown any earnings leverage to rising antimony prices. Investors are being led to
believe the company sits on billions of dollars of antimony in Mexcio, yet the company has
spent only a few million dollars on this asset, refuses to pay for an SEC compliant reserve
report, and once wrote the asset off at $0 a few years ago (the asset was acquired from a
related party). We believe UAMY's shares are worth no more than $0.50 cents, given the
speculative nature of its Mexico operations, and inability to ever generate profits.

Key Research Highlights


UAMY is Being Promoted as a Play on a Scarce Commodity


A little over a year ago, UAMY was an obscure $0.50 cent stock on the bulletin board
until a promotional campaign began touting it as an incredible play on antimony
Antimony prices have already adjusted higher from 2008 -2011 in the post-crash
commodity cycle. Prices have since stagnated, and continue to soften; there are plenty
of global exploration projects underway to increase supply
There are limited organic demand drivers to push prices higher, as global consumption
of this commodity is tied to GDP growth, with no known new application drivers to spur
added demand. Antimony's biggest end market is flame retardant products, and its
second key end-market is lead acid batteries, which is in secular decline. Multiple
substitutes of this commodity also exist, which will also suppress further price
increases


UAMY's Financials Are Suspect: It has Never Made a Profit


UAMY is primarily a processor of the commodity, and just earns a small spread. Higher
antimony prices have never provided earnings leverage to the company; UAMY has
never made more than a penny per share in earnings over the past decade

UAMY discloses two material weaknesses affecting its disclosure controls and
financial reporting, both of which have not been remedied as of June 30, 2012. In fact,
these material weaknesses have gone unremedied for over five years


Numerous Holes and Risks in the Mexico Growth Story


UAMY's growth case is to expand into antimony mining, but has no SEC compliant
proven or probable reserves, and previously had written off the mining operation at $0
a few years back. Since 2006, the company has only invested $5.5m in Mexican capex
The company's filings contain numerous lapses in risk disclosures around their growth
operations, which leave the door open for many shareholder lawsuits


Weak Capital Structure with Significant Dilutive Instruments


Numerous convertible preferred and warrant securities in the capital structure to dilute
existing shareholders. UAMY is not shy about diluting, and quickly raised $2.8 million
in June 2012 at a 28% discount to the closing price
UAMY has a weak shareholder base that includes no institutional support (~1%); the
stock is held ~63% by a retail base led by overly promotional promises that UAMY's
antimony assets are worth billions


Share Price is Significantly Overvalued and Likely to Fall


UAMY's stock price is overvalued by at least 500-600%; there are numerous publicly
traded global peers across the value chain in the industry to determine relative value.
Trading at an EV/Revenues of 14x and a P/E ratio of 300x, UAMY's shares are priced
for perfection with significant risk of a downside correction
Global M&A transaction values for antimony assets also support our case that UAMY's
share price is significantly overvalued. To illustrate, the only operating antimony mine
in North America is Canada's Beaver Brook mine, which was acquired by Hunan
Nonferrous in 2009 for $30 million.
Given these very clear valuation benchmarks, we believe UAMY's share price is worth
no more than $0.50 cents.


Introduction


United States Antimony Corp made its graduation from the bulletin board to the AMEX on
May 21st at approximately $4.00 share, giving the company a $275 million valuation. The
company was incorporated in Montana on January 1970 to mine and produce antimony
products. In December 1983, the company suspended antimony mining operations, but
continued to produce antimony products from domestic and foreign sources. In April 1998,

the company formed United States Antimony SA de CV or USAMSA, to mine and smelt
antimony in Mexico. On August 19, 2005, UAMY formed Antimonio de Mexico, S. A. de C.
V. to explore and develop antimony and silver deposits in Mexico, which is presently being
merged into USAMSA. Today, the company's principal business remains the production
and sale of antimony products, along with zeolite products mined in Idaho.


So what took UAMY multiple decades to achieve its listing status and a valuation more
than a quarter billion dollars, as compared with it being a bulletin board stock with just a
$30 million dollar valuation about a year ago? In our opinion, the answer is a lot of
promotion aimed at retail investors, with attempts to draw a specious parallel between
antimony and the rare earth investment story involving companies such as Molycorp
(MCP), Avalon Rare Metals (NYSEMKT:AVL), Tasman Metals (NYSE:TSM) and Quest
Rare Minerals (NYSEMKT:QRM). Antimony has none of the same demand characteriscs
and growth potential.


In our opinion, the company's recent AMEX listing is not a celebrated milestone of its
corporate growth, but rather a catalyst and platform to sell its overvalued stock to new
investors. Our analysis will show exactly what new investors are buying into - a company
with material operational and financial weaknesses that do not justify even a fraction of the
current stock price. We'll start with a quick primer to demystify the antimony market, and
then illustrate why we believe the odds are in favor of UAMY's share price declining
significantly from current levels.

Antimony (SB) is a silvery-white, shining, soft and brittle metal. It is a semiconductor and
has thermal conductivity lower than most metals. Due to its poor mechanical properties,
pure antimony is only used in very small quantities; larger amounts are used for alloys and
in antimony compounds. Antimony's abundance in the earth's crust is 0.2 ppm, making the
element about as scarce as some of the heavier Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and a little
above silver (AG). Scarcity and supply origins in China are about the only thing antimony
has in common with REEs.


Few Demand Drivers with Declining Growth


According to the US Geological Survey (USGS) and European Commission (EC report),
the largest end market for antimony is flame retardant products that find their way into
electronics and clothes. Antimony's second biggest end-market is in lead-acid batteries,
which is a declining due to the shift to newer battery technologies.

Whereas REEs are necessary for many of the next generation batteries in hybrid electric
vehicles, antimony will not play any role in this future growth. Historical demand for
antimony has exhibited a GDP-like 2.9% CAGR from 2007-2011 in the US, and a similar
long-term rate for world consumption as estimated by Roskill in an April 2012 report
entitled "Antimony: Changes in the Pattern of Supply and Demand." "However, the growth
rate may actually decline going forward warns the EU Commission report. It's easy to
understand why the EU report made this prediction given the anemic world growth rate
and potential for displacement of lead acid batteries. Furthermore, there are few if any
future technology applications that depend on antimony as a critical element.

Supply Contracted in 2011, But Set to Increase in the Future


Focusing on the supply aspects of antimony, there is no question that China has
historically played a major role. China's Hunan Province hosts the world's largest known
deposits and is believed to account for ~60% of world supply, with another 20% coming
from other Chinese locations. As we've seen in many critical commodities such as rare
earth and graphite, China has taken measures to more closely control their resources
from mine to value added production, and reduce export quotas. The Chinese government
took measures to shut down certain antimony mines and smelters in 2011 in an effort to
control environmental issues and resolve safety problems. The tables below show the
global locations of current antimony supplies and reserves. At the current production rate,
there are safely 10 years of antimony reserves, and that doesn't account for additional
exploration efforts that are currently underway to expand supplies.


Including UAMY's efforts to expand production in Mexico, there are numerous other
companies advancing antimony projects around the world. It should be noted that the
USGS doesn't even recognize Mexico as having any reserves. Many of these projects
include bringing on past producing mines. For example, Anchor Resources is advancing
the Wild Cattle Creek project in Australia, while Adroit Resources is working to advance
past producing mines in Italy. The Hillgrove mine in Australia is another example of a
formerly producing mine that could quickly come into production if the right buyer can
finance the reported $60m purchase price that the owner Straits Resources Ltd is seeking.

Prices Have Already Adjusted Higher, Few Catalyst for Higher Prices


The price of antimony has adjusted to reflect the actual and perceived supply shrinkage
from China. Like many of the scarcer commodities tied to China, antimony prices peaked
in 2011 at $8/lb ($17,600/mt) and have softened considerably since. In the absence of
additional supply shrinkage, a material pick-up in global demand, or new uses for the
material, antimony prices are likely to stay range bound for a while or continue to soften as
market reports already indicate.


Plenty of Substitutes for Antimony Will also Suppress Demand and Higher Prices


The USGS lists plenty of substitutes for antimony. For example, compounds of chromium,
titanium, zinc, and zirconium substitute for antimony chemicals in paints, pigments and
enamels. Combinations of cadmium, calcium, copper, selenium, strontium, sulfur and tin
can be used as substitutes for hardening lead. Selected organic compounds and hydrated
aluminum oxide are widely accepted substitutes for flame retardants. The higher price of
antimony also incentivizes additional substitution effects to take place. For example,
phosphorus can be a substitute for antimony metal when it comes to production of flame
retardants. Phosphorus has been one of the materials subject to a WTO ruling against
China when it comes to their current export restrictions - which according to the ruling is
unfair. A recent order by the WTO all but assures China will remove their current export
barriers for this material. Phosphorus will then become an even more attractive substitute

to antimony metal based flame retardants. The result is that we will probably see many
producers in the flame retardant business investing in new technology able to handle this
material, making antimony metal less attractive.


United States Antimony - Profitless Monopoly


No company on the planet has ridden the illusion of the extraordinary profit potential of the
antimony market than UAMY. No one can dispute that there is currently no antimony mine
production in the U.S., and that UAMY owns the only smelter in Montana. However, given
the magnitude of the company's share price move and its $200 million valuation, are
investors completely understanding what they are purchasing and appropriately valuing
the company's earnings potential?


Limited Profitability, No Recent Cash Flow


UAMY sells both antimony and zeolite products, with ~80% of revenues coming from
antimony. While it is the only producer of antimony products, there are at least 10
companies in the U.S. that produce and sell zeolites, which are used in the animal feed,
odor control, pet litter, water and waste purification, fungicide or pesticide carrier, and
horticulture markets. The rise in antimony prices have been the greatest driver of UAMY's
revenue growth in the past few years. The company has seen stagnant antimony volumes
since 2007, so the growth in its revenue is primarily a function of antimony price inflation.


UAMY is purely a processor of antimony; they acquire the concentrates, and sell the final
products at market prices to earn a low margin spread. An analysis of their costs indicate
that, for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, raw materials were approximately 50% of cost
of goods sold. Most of their production costs are fixed in nature, and cannot be decreased
easily without decreasing production. While UAMY has managed to earn just 1 penny per
share the past two years, a closer look at the company's free cash flow reveals a more
perilous situation. The company has never generated a single dollar of free cash flow in
the past five years, and is burning capital at an accelerated rate.

Riskless Investment or Skeletons in the Closet?


When we review prospective investments, we always pay close attention to the risk
factors listed in a company's annual report or prospectus. What we found in UAMY's risk
disclosures shocked us. We found only three risk factors faced by the company, which
made us wonder if UAMY was the least risky investment we had ever evaluated, or a
company that was hiding skeletons in the closet? The very first risk factor blew our mind:


1) If we were liquidated, our common stockholders could lose part, or all, of their
investment.


"In the event of our dissolution, the proceeds (if any) realized from the liquidation of our
assets will be distributed to our stockholders, only after the satisfaction of the claims of our
creditors and preferred stockholders. The ability of a purchaser of shares to recover all, or
any, portion of the purchase price for the shares, in that event, will depend on the amount
of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied by those funds."


On the surface, UAMY's balance sheet looks ok, with a positive book value of $11.6
million, and no imminent debt obligations. The disclosure is a big red flag because we
don't typically see companies warn investors so boldly upfront as a first risk factor that in
liquidation they could lose all or part of their investment. Perhaps, the second risk factor is
where investors should be paying closer attention:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/823521-united-states-antimony-corp-a-commodity-stock-that-could-fall-80-percent 9/29


2) We may have unasserted liabilities for environmental reclamation.


"Our research, development, manufacturing and production processes involve the
controlled use of hazardous materials, and we are subject to various environmental and
occupational safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage,
handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and some waste products….We do not
have environmental liability insurance now, and we do not expect to be able to
obtain insurance at a reasonable cost. "


This disclosure should make any prudent investor worry. UAMY is in the business of
processing potentially hazardous materials according to the EPA and it can't afford to
obtain insurance at a reasonable price? The only reasonable interpretation we can draw
from this statement, is that UAMY is operating an extremely risky business, such that no
insurer is even willing to cover them at any premium rate.


3) We have accruals for asset retirement obligations and environmental obligations


"We have accruals totaling $241,500 on our balance sheet at December 31, 2011, for our
environmental reclamation responsibilities and estimated asset retirement obligations. If
we are not able to adequately perform these activities on a timely basis, we could be
subject to fines and penalties from regulatory agencies."


Of the three risk disclosure, this one appears to be the most innocuous. However, we are
slightly skeptical that less than $250,000 is all that's necessary for environmental and
reclamation activities for an operation such as UAMY's that's been around for decades.


Overall, we are concerned by the dearth of risk factor disclosures made available to
investors. UAMY operates in an extremely cyclical, capital intensive, and competitive
business, yet offers no explanations that cover the multitude of ways that investors can be
harmed. The company's international activities in Mexico, and possible dealings with
China, also add another layer of risks not formally addressed to shareholders. These
omissions may have real consequences for the company in the future at significant costs
to shareholders through lawsuits if future results fail to materialize as expected.


Capital Structure Leaves Little Value for Common Shareholders


In the table below, we detail UAMY's capital structure. The major surprise for new
shareholders should be the significant amount of preferred stock in the capital structure.
The preferred stock has rights to earnings ahead of common shareholders, and offers

cumulative dividends that are currently in arrears. The preferred stock liquidation value of
$5.7 million currently exceeds the amount of cash on hand, and is ~65% of the company's
current book value.


No "Smart Money" Institutional Shareholders Own UAMY


If we are to believe that UAMY is a major force in the antimony market with significant
upside earnings potential, and undiscovered asset value, surely we would expect to find
some of the savviest hedge funds, value investors, and smart money crowd owning large
blocks of shares. To the contrary, the current shareholder base is one of mystery and
intrigue. While we are pleased to see the CEO has a large ownership stake, the remainder
of the shareholders appear to have no experience in the mining business. The current
roster of shareholders includes a dermatologist, dentist, veterinarian, and oil wildcatter.
The majority of shares in the float are held by the public. Institutions appear to refuse
owning the shares and currently have ~1%.


Significant Dilution Appears to be Coming


Why did UAMY wait decades to establish its listing on the AMEX? We believe that the
listing was timed precisely to maximize its chances of selling its shares to new investors,
and to capitalize on the misperception that antimony is the latest must own commodity.

We are not just speculating that this is the reason, we have proof it is already happening.
On June 25, the company announced a quick capital raise of $2.8 million by issuing 953k
of shares at $3.00 and nearly a half million warrants struck at $4.50. The company wasn't
shy about sticking it hard to its existing investors through punitive dilution. The stock had
closed the previous day at $4.20/share, so the issuance came at a whopping 28%
discount to the closing price. This discount is 2x larger than the discount used for a $2
million capital raise earlier this year on Jan 13, 2012.


The most concerning aspect of UAMY's potential dilution is the overhang of the Series D
preferred stock. The 1.75 million shares have a liquidation value of $4.7 million. It makes
perfect sense to convert them and slowly sell them into the open market. We believe this
major overhang could cause UAMY's share price to deflate sharply when the Series D
preferred is converted. An additional 1.8 million warrants outstanding also mature in the
next few years, with some in-the-money.


There are also reasons why UAMY's largest shareholder, the Dugan family, could begin
selling large blocks of their 6.3 million shares. According to public record, family patriarch
Al Dugan recently passed away in October 2011. The oil and real estate business
appeared to have been his core holdings; therefore, it would not be surprising to see his
family holdings diversified away from riskier holdings such as UAMY stock.


UAMY's Growth Plans Hinge on a Once Worthless Asset with No Proof of Any Reserves


If there ever were a case to be made that UAMY's share price offered compelling value at
a nearly $200 million valuation, there would have to be significant tangible evidence that
the company owned vast antimony holdings, and had a clear path to production and
earnings leverage. Investors are currently being lured by the prospect that UAMY will be
realizing potential upside from their Los Juarez mining properties in Mexico. UAMY also
owns the Puerto Blanco mill, and a smelter at Madero. Combined, UAMY is telling
investors that these operations are expected to begin producing a significant portion of
their raw materials in Q2'2012. The production of concentrated smelter feed from its
Mexico operations shipped to the Montana smelter for refining is expected to allow UAMY
to produce more products for sale during the ensuing reporting periods. It expects to have
a lower production cost and a greater recovery of precious metals due to the increased
smelter feed from Mexico.


There is one very BIG problem with this business plan that investors must take a leap of
faith on that UAMY bluntly discloses:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/823521-united-states-antimony-corp-a-commodity-stock-that-could-fall-80-percent 12/29


We have no "proven reserves" or "probable reserves" of antimony or zeolite, as these
terms are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


In other words, there are zero assurances that UAMY will produce any antimony quantities
of sufficient quality and duration to cover any of its capital and operating costs. UAMY
offers some explanation, which also leads more to hope than actual proof their Mexican
assets have any value. It claims that its Mexican properties, including San Miguel I, II and
part of San Juan III, were originally drilled by Penoles (Mexico's second largest mining
company) in 1970, when antimony metal prices were high. They did not proceed with the
property, due to the complex metallurgy of antimony. Subsequently, the Mexican
Government did additional work and reported a reserve of 1,000,000 metric tons
(NYSE:MT) grading 1.8% antimony and 8.1 ounces of silver per metric ton (opmt) in
Consejo de Recursos Minerales (Publicacion M-4e). However, the Securities and
Exchange Commission does not recognize this report, and the Company claims no
reserves. We believe that if the metallurgy was difficult and uneconomic to develop
30 years ago, chances are these assets are still difficult and uneconomic.


An even closer look into UAMY's history in Mexico corroborates our suspicion. UAMY has
two Mexican subsidiaries: ADM and USAMSA. Antimonio de Mexico SA de Cv "ADM" was
incorporated in 2005 under the laws of Mexico and the State of Jalisco. On December 16,
2005, ADM signed a contract and option agreement that gives ADM the exclusive right to
explore and exploit the San Miguel I and San Miguel II concessions for an annual payment
of $50,000, and an option to purchase payment of $100,000 annually. Total payments
would not exceed $1,430,344, reduced by IVA taxes paid. During the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $186,956, $186,956 and $86,956 was paid or
accrued and capitalized as mineral rights towards ADM. ADM is presently being merged
into United States Antimony, Mexico S.A. de C.V. "USAMSA," which was formed in 1998
through a 50% interest. UAMY had written off its 50% stake as entirely worthless (aka $0)
on December 31, 2005 due to volatile antimony prices and the lack of operating and
development capital. During 2006, UAMY acquired the 50% interest in the stock of
USAMSA for just $165,000 in the form of $48,500 of cash, $61,000 of UAMY common
stock, and a $55,000 note payable. The company has spent $5.5 million since 2006 to
prepare its Mexican operations for this supposed ramp in production, so we believe
its shareholders shouldn't be terribly surprised if future results fail to meet
expectations.

UAMY Has Material Financial Weaknesses and Financial Control Issues


As of June 30, 2012, UAMY's 10Q reported material weaknesses affecting its disclosure
controls and procedures and, as a result of those weaknesses, its disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. These material weaknesses are as follows:


The company lacks proper segregation of duties. The president authorizes the majority
of the expenditures and signs checks
During its year-end audit, the company's independent registered accountants
discovered material misstatements in our financial statements that required audit
adjustments


We reviewed these material weaknesses and found that the company has had them listed
since 2007. In other words, the company has failed to address these issues for over five
years and has repeatedly had financial misstatements. Key Takeaway: Investors should
approach the company's financials with extreme caution.


UAMY is Excessively Overvalued, and Worth No More Than 50 Cents


We have used a couple common sense approaches to determine that UAMY is
excessively overvalued. First, let's consider the company's market value in relation to the
market opportunity for antimony products. According to the company's own 10k disclosure
on page 5, it estimate its share of the domestic antimony products market is approximately
2%. This would imply a staggering $10.5 billion dollar market value for the entire U.S.
antimony market. However, as we've shown earlier in our analysis, the entire world market
for antimony products is approximately 169,000 metric tons. The current price is

approximately $14,000 per metric ton, which equates to $2.4 billion in annual world
turnover. The U.S. consumes approximately 16% of world production, so we estimate a
total revenue opportunity in the U.S. of approximately $372 million. This figure is nearly as
large as UAMY's entire market cap even though the company only has a 2% share of the
market. The absurdity of UAMY's valuation in relation to the total world and US market
opportunity for antimony is illustrated below.


We have also evaluated UAMY's value in relation to known antimony players across the
world and determined its shares to be exorbitantly overvalued. In the table below, we have
listed a variety of companies engaged in antimony mine production, value added products,
and exploration.

The largest world producer and smelter of antimony is Hunan Nonferrous Metals (HK:
2626), which produces 34,000 tons of antimony per year, and also produces zinc,
tungsten, lead and other metals. The next largest producer of antimony products is
Campine NV (EBR: CAMB) of Belgium. Lastly, Village Main Reef (JSE: VIL) in South
Africa and Mandalay Resources (TSE: MDN) of Australia mine approximately 4,600 tons
and 1,700 tons, respectively. Antimony is typically found near gold and silver deposits, so
investors in these two companies also receive production ounces of these precious
metals. At the bottom of the table is UAMY with a paltry 675 metric tons of antimony, and a
de minims amount of gold, silver and zeolite.


We have also tabulated a list of every deal we could find in the past few years that
included an antimony asset and was stunned that the average deal size was
approximately $40 million. The only operating mine in North America is Canada's Beaver
Brook Antimony Mine which was acquired by Hunan Nonferrous in 2009 for $30 million.
Even if we assume its value has doubled or tripled in the past few years given the rise in
antimony prices, it would put the value of Beaver Brook at $60 - $90 million. Beaver Brook
reportedly spent $15 million to revive the mine, planned to produce 6,000 metrics tons
annually, and had only a 7 years of reserves. To put UAMY's Mexico ambitions in
perspective, the company has spent under $6 million since 2006, is estimating a
maximum throughput of 1,800 tons per annum, and has no proven reserves. From this
perspective, UAMY's $200 million enterprise value appears wildly unjustified.

From a valuation perspective, there is no way to justify UAMY's exorbitant valuation.
UAMY is trading at 14x sales vs. 0.9x peer average and a 300x P/E vs. a 13.5x peer
average. If we applied the peer group multiples to UAMY's current financials, we estimate
the share price would between $0.20 cents. Because the company has no proven or
probable reserves, we give no credit for future revenue or earnings upside, which we view
as entirely speculative. On the other hand, if you consider that the company has spent
approximately $5.5 million on its Mexican operations since 2006, and take a leap of faith
that it could yield a 3x return on the investment, this would be only worth an additional
$0.30 cents per share or a total share price of approximately $0.50 cents.

Conclusion: High Risk, Little Reward for Owning Shares of UAMY


We have conducted months of research into United States Antimony and determined a
highly unfavorable risk / reward proposition. We are concerned that investors are ascribing
too high a value to the company's earnings potential and misunderstanding the prospects
for the antimony market. The overvaluation of UAMY is directly attributable to excessive
promotion of their earnings prospects. The promotion first started in April 2011, when the
company p aid for promotion through a Wall St. Transcript interview. Shortly after, a
reckless Forbes article intimated that UAMY might be the next Molycorp, and could do
$100 million of revenues and $0.30 cents of earnings by 2013. With a year to go, UAMY
would have to increase revenues and earnings by 7x and 30x to reach these lofty goals.
UAMY is also covered by one sell-side research firm with an aggressive $5 target, and a
SeekingAlpha blogger who makes unsubstantiated claims the company is sitting on
billions worth of antimony and could be a $45 stock.


Antimony is undoubtedly a scarce commodity, but demand potential is limited to a few end
markets, and growth will not outperform GDP. Unlike rare earths, antimony will not play a
leading role in future technologies, and has numerous substitutes. The price of antimony
has already adjusted in the past few years to changes in China's policies, and is unlikely
to move any higher now that Chinese growth is slowing, and new sources of supply are
aggressively being explored and brought to market. UAMY is indeed the sole U.S.
processor of antimony, but it controls only 2% of the US market, and has never been able
to generate more than a penny of earnings.


In our opinion, the company's recent AMEX listing is not a major corporate milestone to
signal future upside opportunities for new shareholders. Rather, the listing provides a
platform for the company to rapidly dilute public shareholders, and offer long-time holders
a better means to liquidate large holdings. The company's capital structure also does not
support additional value for common shareholders because of the large preferred stock
classes that must be liquidated or converted.


However, our biggest concern is the excessive valuation of the company at nearly $200
million that hinges on them commercializing new antimony deposits in Mexico without any
proven or probable reserves. Investors are risking major disappointment if actual results
do not meet or beat expected results. Because of the deficient financial filings, material
weaknesses, and omission of numerous risk factors, UAMY would face countless
shareholder lawsuits.

We have presented a plethora of comparable companies and transactions to show the
degree of overvaluation in UAMY's share price. By giving no value to the Mexican
operations due to its highly speculative nature, we believe UAMY's share price would be
worth no more than $0.20 cents if it were valued at peer averages. On the other hand, if
you consider that the company has spent only $5.5 million on its Mexican operations since
2006 and it could yield even a wildly bullish return of 3x on the investment, this would be
only worth an additional $0.30 cents per share or a total share price of $0.50 cents.
Ironically, this is exactly where the share price was trading about a year ago before the
first promotional efforts from the company began.

It makes perfect sense that a person or entity who is short in UAMY would write this article. It is well written and
compelling. In fact the short position has grown to over 4 million shares in a short period of time. 4 million shares is a
lot to cover and the short wold be happier covering at 50 cents rather than $5.


There are some holes in the argument though: 
1) Whereas the author writes that there are NO reserves in Mexico, a recent release on activities in Mexico counters
the point: http://yhoo.it/NKVopX The company has been around for 50 years. Why start hyping now? The CEO has no
history of hyping so this would be unusual behavior unless there is somethng to it. Why risk his career and prison time
by releasing false information after all this time? 
2) Here is what the US govenrment has to say: 
http://on.doi.gov/GY1lz2 
In China, the world’s leading antimony producer, the Government continued to shut down antimony mines and
smelters in an effort to control environmental issues and resolve safety problems. The local Government in
Lengshuijiang, Hunan Province, which accounts for about 60% of the world antimony supply, shuttered almost all of
its mines and smelters. Also, officials in Lengshuijiang announced that after more than 110 years of continuous
mining, the area now had only 5 years of mining life left. 
3) Here is what the British Government has to say: 
http://bit.ly/NKVopZ Click on Risk list 
a relative risk listing of 52 chemical elements or element groups needed to maintain our economy and life style. Only
four are listed in the very high risk group; Antimony, PGEs, Mercury and Tungsten. 
4) As to other suppliers coming on lin, in tmie they will. I have spoken to Adroit resources. There is nothing coming
onlinefor the next two years and they are in need of capital. Hillgrove has environmental pushback and although
shovel ready also has a the problem of who will do the smelting.

IF UAMY can produce 1,800 t/yr of antimony, estimated revenue would be $35 mil including 800,000 oz of silver @
$28/oz. this assumes 8 oz/ t and an antimony grade of 1.8%. I cannot estimate cash costs yet as UAMY has been toll
processing. But, if cash costs were $10 million, EBITDA would be $25 mil, justifying a $175 million market cap based
on the group average of 7x used by this analyst. The real story though is supply. Chinese output is going to decline
substantially in the next few years. Prices will move up dramatically, tempered by substitution effects. A $10/ lb price
does not seem unreasonable.


23 Aug 2012, 03:49 PM


Ben Axler, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Blaise: I stand corrected on the institutional ownership. Many funds recently reported updated
holdings. Keep in mind, many of these institutions are forced to hold shares due to UAMY's index inclusion, so I would
not draw any overly bullish conclusions just yet. Also, you focus extensively on supply side scarcity issues, but
antimony is equally a demand story. With anemic world GDP growth, declining usage in lead acid batteries, and no
known future uses, why should one be overly bullish on antimony?


You have been predicting "record earnings" for UAMY for well over a year now and it's failed to materialize. The
company seems incapable of producing more than 1 penny of earnings in even the highest price antimony
environments. This ought to give you a good sense of just how tough there business is to make money and how bad
management has executed. I have severe doubts that the future will look any different from the past.


Fred Ohr: I'm glad you qualify your response with an "IF"  
There are two many unknowns here to draw any meaningful conclusions on future earnings. You also assume that
this company has the right people and managerial talent to execute in Mexico. Why has it taken a decade to get
where they are today, which is still no closer to any clear earnings roadmap?

Ben, 
You're spot on regarding UAMY. Here are my observations to supplement yours. There is not a lot of info on this
company, outside of SEC filings, but what little there is is not encouraging. The products they produce are toxic (see
MSDS at their website) and their Montana site looks like it has a tailings pond and other disposal sites. That is likely a
large environmental liability down the road. There is almost no information on their Mexican operations, but they do
state they are producing ore for the mill and smelter by "hand sorting". Calculating their production, it amounts to a
few pickup loads per day. Doesn't sound like a multi $100 million company to me.


23 Aug 2012, 06:16 PM

Also, they have all of 3 customers. There is also self dealing - renting equipment from the chairman and paying
consulting fees to a board member. Also, the chairman's son is also on the board. Nice to keep it all in the family.

I think maybe what bothers you about this company is that they have revenue. You could be talking about how many
hundreds of companies of comparable market cap that have NO revenues, But no, here is a company with a unique
story, and you have to down it. This is a company in continuous smelting history for how many decades? But you
don't like it. There was a reference to comparing UAMY to Molycorp in a magazine article. What was the market cap
Molycorp attained and had never smelted an ounce? I can see you don't like experience, don't like revenue, don't like
production, don't like expansion, don't like growth, don't like anything about anything successful.

1. “Investors are being led to believe the company sits on billions of dollars of antimony in Mexico….”


I personally believe that this is a real possibility. But the current price reflects only the possibility that the mine is worth
several hundred million. If there is even a very small chance that the mine could have a large value, the current price
significantly undervalues UAMY. I would give a lot of weight to Mr. Guamera’s decision to join the board. He is clearly

Ben: Shortsqueeze.com indicates that there are currently 4,211,900 shares shorted and that it will take 30.3 days at
recent volume levels to cover. You obviously put a lot of time into writing your report and creating your charts. But
have you met with the CEO? Have you visited the mine in Mexico? Do you have any idea about the quality of the ore
from initial production (antimony, silver, gold levels/ton)? Have you held any of the ore in your hand? Ore is being
crushed at Los Juarez at this very moment. The results could prove to be crushing to you and your fellow shorts.


You were very wrong when you were bullish about LGDI in January 2010 (see your Seeking Alpha article entitled
"Ben Axler's Highest Conviction Holding: An Undervalued, Smallcap Commodities Stock"). Your LGDI
recommendation has plummeted 95% since then. If you are equally wrong with regard to your recommendation about
UAMY, your potential losses as a short have no ceiling. At least when you were long LGDI, you could only lose
$1.54/share (closed at 8 cents a share today). By way of shorting UAMY, your downside knows no bounds.


UAMY is not a GTZ company. Ore is crushing. More crushing to come. Revenue has and will flow. Reserves and
profits to be booked. The shorts have had a nice ride from the day the Russell trade transpired. But that ride could go
haywire in a heartbeat given the daily volume issue and the squeeze that will come as the value in the mine is
recognized and booked.


Disclosure: I have been very long UAMY for a couple of years and will remain long for the duration based upon the
hands-on research I have done regarding US Antimony, its management, and its properties.

1. Again, you distort. I asked, " Have you held any of the ore in your hand?" You replied stating I asked, "Have
I held antimony in my hand?" You then jump to the conclusion that I must be ignorant based upon my failure
to recognize antimony's toxicity. Your logic is akin to me asking you if you've held a piece of galena in your
hand and you claiming that I must not "...understand a single thing..." because the federal government says
lead is toxic. Paleologic, I dare say. I have held the Los Juarez ore in both hands. My point is only that the
mine is real, the ore is real, and the reserves are real but post Bre-X, the requirements for claiming reserves
are beyond substantial. Assays of the ore will be forthcoming. Initial reserve reports will be forthcoming. Cash
from mining and processing the Los Juarez ore is beginning to flow to the top line.


Regarding your record of being 100% correct with regard to short ideas, all I can say is congratulations. The
only time I have been 100% correct in all of my financial predictions has been when I have predicted three
outcomes for each investment (1. Stable. 2. Lower. or, 3. Higher.). Great to bump into somebody who is 100%
accurate. For your and your investor's sakes, I hope that your 100% accuracy has helped you recoup the
95% decline in the long position you touted in January 2010 (Legend).


Regarding your inquiry about my investment record. I do not manage money for others. I have made some
good investments and some very poor investments during the past 30 years. My best investments have
involved buying assets (frequently by way of direct purchase - oil and gas properties mostly - but also by way
of equities) that are dramatically undervalued by the marketplace. I then either patiently wait for management
to do what needs to be done to develop the asset or I begin the process myself if I am the owner. Eventually, I
sell the asset/equity at a significant profit. If I owned the asset directly, I keep an overriding royalty interest at
the time of sale. I view US Antimony as fitting my investment profile exquisitely well. I'm not a stock picker or
a trader. I'm a value investor who seeks out the rare but dramatic incongruities between price and value.
When I spot such an opportunity, I buy and patiently hold the asset pending market recognition of value -

which admittedly can sometimes take several years and be a bit of a roller coaster between then and when.
UAMY is not risk free and it certainly does not have the bookable metrics to bedazzle the market - yet.


Again, I repeat: My down side as a long is knowable. Your upside with regard to your short position is
bounded and your downside is boundless. If I were short UAMY at this price range and performed due
diligence about the Los Juarez mine, I would be very nervous knowing that it would take 30 days at current
volume for all of the shorts to cover. The backdoor can get very narrow at times. As a long, I can ride the hills
and valleys without significant concern knowing what my investment goal is with respect to UAMY. As a short,
the track for your train may be as short as your position. What then?


I don't think debating this further is meritorious. Frankly, I'm glad you are short for two reasons. First, you are
creating more buying opportunities for longs who understand the value of the operations at the Los Juarez
mine. Second, you and the other shorts will provide 4+ million shares worth of rocket fuel to the PPS once the
crush of ore becomes more apparent to you and Mr. Market. You can shake out weak hands in the short run -
but in the long run, the value of the mine and associated production will prevail.

2. “Why did UAMY wait decades to establish its listing on the AMEX? We believe that the listing was timed precisely
to maximize its chances of selling its shares to new investors, and to capitalize on the misperception that antimony is
the latest must own commodity.”


UAMY could not list on the AMEX previously because the share price did not meet AMEX requirements.


3. “UAMY is purely a processor of antimony; they acquire the concentrates, and sell the final products at market
prices to earn a low margin spread.”


True in the past, but not in the future.


4. Fears about dilution are misguided. The amount of dilution was small. Further, the investors received restricted
stock, which typically sells at a substantial discount. You can buy the stock now at a price lower than in the recent
private placement.


5. “From a valuation perspective, there is no way to justify UAMY's exorbitant valuation. UAMY is trading at 14x sales
vs. 0.9x peer average and a 300x P/E vs. a 13.5x peer average.”


Valuing what is basically a Mexican start up using historical and current ratios is seriously flawed.


Disclosure: I have been long UAMY for more than 20 years and I currently hold a substantial long position that I plan
to retain long term although I may make trades from time to time.

Notice the parallel of a Forbes article claiming you must own tungsten?

So what is Malaga, a producer of tungsten products worth? Unfortunately, Malaga is worth just $20 million and trades
at a p/e of 7x....If you think UAMY is worth many multiples of this company, I hope this serves as an effective warning
for you.

The debate is on between the long and short position. With regard revenues I admit to being off on timing. I DO
expect this quarter will be far better. With regard revenues: 
2009 4.1 million 
2010 9 million 
2011 13.1 million 
2012 ??? 
http://yhoo.it/OA7ow5 
So they are growing AND spending money so it is just pennies. Once they start processing their own material with
better margins I suspect this will be reflected in the earnings.


I will hold to this post as I suspect Ben will hold to this. See you in the November earnings!

Author’s reply »  Blaise: Thanks for your input. Most equity investors focus on earnings per share and not revenues.
Unfortunately, higher commodity prices do not always translate into higher earnings for lower quality commodity
companies that cannot efficiently run their business and control costs. Mining costs have escalated significantly in the
past few years and should be scrutinized carefully with respect to this company. Where are they getting their skilled
and technical labor force to operate in Mexcio? There's a death of skilled mining works currently on a global basis;
just talk to any people in the industry and you'll find this out quickly. Has management given any guidance whatsoever
on the cost side of their equation?

A crucial issue is the value of the Mexican mine. The current stock price is pricing in a low value. I believe that the
value is high. Others believe that it is low. No amount of examining sales and earnings ratios or comparing this mine

with other mines will tell investors the value of this mine. Fortunately, the answer will be known in 2 years and possibly
a lot less as the company ramps up its operations.


If there were no institutional holdings there would likely be no shares for the shorts to borrow. But the relatively low
institutional ownership is what makes trying to panic the retail stockholders feasible.

Good news for UAMY!

“Has management given any guidance whatsoever on the cost side of their equation?”


Absolutely. UAMY has discussed mining costs on numerous occasions. After attending the annual meeting in January
2012, based on management discussions, I concluded that UAMY would be able to achieve a gross margin of about
35% on purchased ore and possibility as much as 75% on ore from their own mine. And ore from their own mine
could eventually account for 50% or more of production. Further, UAMY announced details of the contract to build a
pipeline to reduce energy costs and the building of a road to reduce transportation costs.


“…Mandalay Resources (TSE: MDN) of Australia mine approximately 4,600 tons and 1,700 tons, respectively.
Antimony is typically found near gold and silver deposits, so investors in these two companies also receive production
ounces of these precious metals. At the bottom of the table is UAMY with a paltry 675 metric tons of antimony, and a
de minims amount of gold, silver and zeolite.”


Again, this is true in the past, but I don’t believe it will be true in the future. If UAMY can just be as successful as
Mandalay, its market cap would increase substantially from current levels.

As a long-term long, I love the shorts. 4+ million shares shorted - 30 days to cover. More institutional investors appear
to be starting to realize the benefits of owning UAMY at these prices. The shorts have tried to stimulate a "sell"
campaign among the weak retail hands, and it obviously has not worked. As the back door narrows, the shorts will
help push the PPS higher as the actual value of the Los Juarez mine becomes apparent to Mr. Market. People think
that if something isn't booked, it isn't real and that it has no inherent value. As a case study, in 2002, the north half (18
sections) of the Umiat Oil Field (Alaska North Slope - NPR-A) sold in a sealed bid BLM auction for ~$83,000. In 2011,

the Umiat Oil Field was purchased for $50 million by Linc Energy and exploration is underway this winter. My point?
Value can be recognized by those who put their boots on the ground; those who dust off historical reports and figure
out what is in the ground. Those with vision and guts acquire such properties before the herd notices value.
Eventually, the herd notices. From my perspective, UAMY's acquisition of the Los Juarez mine is exactly the same
type of value play. The mine has only just begun production. I am very pleased to be long UAMY at this juncture in
corporate development and am delighted that Ben Axler and others in his camp have shorted the stock. Nothing quite
like rocket fuel from the shorts when the herd begins to detect the company's underlying value.


I may be wrong. But I have my money where my mouth is and my strategy has been very rewarding historically. I am
a patient long. But I do not invest unless I see very significant unrecognized value. UAMY fits my investment strategy
perfectly. FXEN is another company I have held for a decade and will continue to patiently own. The Kutno-2 well is
on the brink of penetrating the massive Rotliegend structure below the Zechstein salt in Poland's Permian Basin. If
the well is a commercial success, the upside for that company will be huge. If dry, the buying opportunity created by
Mr. Market will be outstanding given that the current price per share is justified without the Kutno and other prospects
are being drilled and/or developed for production. Efficient marketplace? Not a chance from my perspective.


Disclosure: I am long both UAMY and FXEN.

Turnipseed
Arktic, 
My main criticism of UAMY is that the company does not provide much information. Their website is not very
useful and their SEC filings are short on details. I have been unable to find any useful information on Los
Juarez deposit which seems to be the key to the future of this company. The combination of abundant press
releases and no hard data makes me very suspicious of UAMY. Until they are more forthcoming, I'll pass.


30 Aug 2012, 02:26 PM


thefundamentals
I agree with Turniseed.


Arktic, where are the reports and feasibility studies that show that their Mexican mines have value? I have yet
to seen any valid reports that show any value here other than pure speculation.

Looks like more supply might be incoming from China. http://reut.rs/NGWEcu


Makes you wonder if having a US monopoly on antimony is going to end up amounting to much of anything if China
just fills the gap. Look at what's happened to Molycorp...

Author’s reply »  Thanks for sharing this link Ian. You highlight another risk of owning this stock, which is their
fortunes are tied to the capricious nature of Chinese policies. You also raise a great point about Molycorp. The stock
always traded on unrealistic valuation metrics and they have failed to execute. The Forbes article that compared
UAMY to Molycorp should be a sharp warning for long investors, especially at this inflated valuation level. As turnseed
points out, the company has not produced any valid reports backed by geological experts as to what exactly they
own. This is an essential precondition for owning any mining stock. The only arguments the long supports are making
here is that we should trust both them and management.

Odds and ends...There have been 2 negative articles recently on the company and the stock moved up 8%, ballpark.
The USAC website is very cluttered, I agree. Not sure about the toxicity of antimony. Antimony ore? Processed
antimony? I have a small processed brick with the USAC logo on it at home and it has not yet killed my canary.
Likewise we were given samples on the Mexican field trip. I assume processed antimony, and was warned simply to
wash my hands before eating if I hand handled it. Earnings at the next report. Not an issue for me. Earnings in 2014
at these levels and I will be upset. People who buy based on current earnings will indeed find this stock iffy. It is
starting up a serious Mexican operation that may not reflect in earnings at this point. Likewise USAC has been around
quite a while. 1969 or so. Still here, still cooking, and the longs hope the big days are ahead.

I admit to being wrong on my original call on this. 
3 things torpedoed my original perspective: 
1) Price of Antimony plummeted 
2) UAMY took a lot longer to compensate for this drop in price by increasing production (they have markedly
increased production in terms of total pounds which is a good thing but price of Antimony collapsed). 
3) The anticipated loss of production by the Chinese has not yet materialized.


I hope that as Antimony prices force marginal mines to close that UAMY can continue to produce to the point of
another price spike..
