Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell
Disaster For Avanir

We have published a more detailed report on Avanir Pharmaceuticals on September 11,
2013. A PDF version of the full 47-page report can be found at
gravityresearchgroup.com/reports.


Avanir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AVNR) is a pharmaceutical company currently
marketing one FDA-approved drug: Nuedexta. Nuedexta is a combination of two generic
drugs (dextromethorphan and quinidine) and is approved to treat Pseudobulbar Affect
(PBA), a condition that causes patients to experience bouts of uncontrollable laughing
and/or crying. We believe that AVNR stock will collapse in the near future due to the
perfect storm of overhanging potential negative events threatening its solvency, including
a sharp drop in future revenue and fines resulting from a potential illegal off-label
marketing investigation, steep declines in revenue and default on outstanding debt due to
loss of this week's patent case, and other events that may adversely affect AVNR's cash
flows in the near future.


1) We believe AVNR has engaged in illegal off-label marketing of Nuedexta and that
off-label prescriptions have generated a significant portion of AVNR's Nuedexta
revenue to date. We have collected strong evidence to support this conclusion, including
numerous documented allegations of and allusions to off-label marketing from purported
AVNR employees and recorded discussions we have held with former AVNR employees.
Below are selected comments in reference to the off-label marketing at AVNR (see the full
report for more):


"People are marketing off label for "Agitation" and "other behaviors." Many of us have
seen it first hand with LNAM [long-term care neuroscience area manager]
counterparts. It is a huge concern."
"…there is so much off label selling - it's dangerous. Reps will get caught...the
company will get caught...good luck...this company is teetering on the edge with one
foot in illegal waters and the other on a banana peel"
"[Y]ou will be encouraged to promote off label, you will be competing against reps who
have zero issue selling off label…"
"…practically EVERYONE is selling OFF-LABEL!"
"…we have a HUGE culture problem in LTC [long-term care] selling off-lab[el]."

We believe AVNR could face over $100mm in fines and penalties and see its
Nuedexta sales plummet following a potential government investigation. We
reached this figure through research of settlements, which appear to be based on both the
egregiousness of the off-label selling as well as the amount of revenue generated by the
drug. For example, Elan's $203mm settlement represented approximately 93% of the total
historical revenue it generated with the drug Zonegran. Cumulatively, AVNR has
generated over $100mm in gross revenue from sales of Nuedexta.


According to one of our sources, at the time he left AVNR, the off-label marketing of
Nuedexta at AVNR was not merely rogue sales representatives, but extended up the
chain and was driven by multiple regional sales directors, and at least one national sales
director. We believe that off-label marketing contributed to the mysteriously rapid
departure of AVNR's former Chief Commercial Officer who arrived soon after Nuedexta
was launched and who, as we confirmed with a source, became aware of the issue prior
to leaving the company after less than eight months.


Former employees of AVNR have told us that the actual pool of PBA patients in the US is
significantly lower than Management represents, making it difficult if not impossible to
reach sales targets without engaging in off-label marketing (we believe the pool of
marketable patients is at least 75% smaller than the 1.8mm figure quoted by
Management).* This situation is eerily similar to what happened at InterMune, where
AVNR's current CEO Keith Katkin was previously a Vice President of Marketing.
InterMune was found guilty of engaging in off-label marketing while Katkin worked there,
and former employees have testified in court that Katkin set sales goals for a drug so high
that the only way to attain those sales goals was through off-label marketing.  The fact
that AVNR has experienced extensive turnover in salespeople and 50%+ of Nuedexta pills
are being sold through long-term care facilities despite Management explicitly stating that
such facilities only constitute 5.6% of total PBA patients also served to heighten our
suspicions. There has been a recent rash of off-label marketing cases through long-term
care facilities in particular among other pharmaceutical companies, and based on our
research and discussions, we believe this is where the majority of off-label marketing of
Nuedexta is taking place


2) We believe that AVNR has a very high probability of losing its current patent
case, and as a result, will likely face an 80%+ decline in quarterly revenue by the
end of FY 2014 and default on its debt due to a clause which lists "[a] commercial
generic version of Nuedexta (for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect) becomes
available" as an event of default.

We believe the evidence presented in the court filings creates a clear-cut case in the
defense's favor, and a reverse payment ("pay-to-delay") settlement with Par
Pharmaceuticals (Par) is the only way AVNR could avoid a ruling invalidating its patents.
However, Par has a strong incentive not to accept such a settlement due to 1) the fact that
a favorable ruling in the case would lend itself to future cases for non-PBA indications
using quinidine/dextromethorphan combinations and 2) anti-trust concerns, which are
especially significant in light of the recent June 2013 Supreme Court ruling that reverse
payment settlements are subject to anti-trust scrutiny. Having reviewed thousands of
pages of court filings and academic/industry publications related to the case and patents
in question (relevant parts of which are posted on our website under Appendix X to the
report), we believe that AVNR would lose a ruling in the patent case. This would soon
trigger default on its debt due to a clause in AVNR's credit agreement that declares the
marketing of generic Nuedexta to be a default event.  While creditors always have the
option of allowing the company to continue with regularly-scheduled payments (typically at
a much higher interest rate), we believe that would not be feasible in this case because
we estimate that generic competition would wipe out AVNR's quarterly revenue from
Nuedexta by at least 80% by the end of FY 2014, magnifying AVNR's already-negative
operating cash flows.


The defense team for Par and its (former) co-defendants has produced firm evidence that
the "composition of matter" concept of combining dextromethorphan and quinidine, and
the "method of use" concept of using the resulting compound to treat PBA had both been
patented with priority dates before the priority date of AVNR's earliest relevant patent (see
US Patent Nos. 5,166,207 and 5,206,248),  and the impact of low doses of quinidine on
dextromethorphan plasma concentrations ("method of use") were documented in a 1999
abstract (the "Yakatan Abstract")5,6 that was published and made publicly available three
years prior to AVNR filing for the relevant patents. We believe the data from the Yakatan
Abstract in conjunction with the earlier patents makes all three of AVNR's patents invalid
due to obviousness based on prior art and/or double-patenting.


Below is our summary of AVNR's patent case, culled from thousands of pages of available
court filings from both the plaintiff and defense sides. We believe we present it in a fair and
concise way that allows for readers to reach their own objective conclusions. It leaves out
certain arguments from both sides that we consider to be frivolous. See Why We Believe
the Nuedexta Patents Won't Hold Up in Court for a more detailed discussion of the patent
case:


Plaintiff's Case

5/20/2018 Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell Disaster For Avanir - Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc (NASDAQ:AVN…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 4/30


• AVNR have three patents covering its drug Nuedexta (which contains 20 mg of
dextromethorphan and 10 mg of quinidine per pill): the '115 patent, the '242 patent, and
the '484 patent. By filing ANDAs and paragraph IV certifications, the defendants are
violating all three of them. The relevant claims from the '115 patent are "composition of
matter" claims covering the dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, and the relevant
claims from the '242 and '484 patents are "method of use" claims covering the use of
specific ratios of dextromethorphan and quinidine ("1:0.5 or less" and "1:0.75 or less",
respectively) and ranges of doses for dextromethorphan and quinidine ('242 patent: 20
mg/day to 80 mg/day of dextromethorphan and 10 to 30 mg/day of quinidine; '484 patent:
20 mg/day to 60 mg/day of dextromethorphan and 10 to 30 mg/day of quinidine)


Defense's Case


• The relevant claims from all three of the Plaintiff's patents are invalid and/or inapplicable
in the case


• The '115 patent has a priority date of June 9, 1992. The asserted "composition of matter"
claims of the '115 patent covering the combination of dextromethorphan with quinidine to
augment the impact of dextromethorphan are invalid due to double-patenting-those same
composition of matter claims were previously claimed through US Patent No. 5,166,207
(the '207 patent)  which has a June 17, 1991 priority date, and US Patent No. 5,206,248
(the '248 patent), which has a March 27, 1992 priority date. Claims other than composition
of matter are irrelevant to the case because the patent specifically addresses indications
other than PBA (specifically "chronic or intractable pain, for treating tinnitus and for
treating sexual dysfunction"), which is why it was granted by the patent office in the first
place given the other two patents had already been filed and approved


• The '242 and '484 patents, which both carry a priority date of July 17, 2002 and cover the
treatment of PBA with a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine, are differentiated
from the prior '248 patent (which also covers the treatment of PBA with a combination of
dextromethorphan and quinidine) purely due to their dosing claims. The '248 patent does
not specify dosing in its claims, and the '242 and '484 patents claim doses that are low
relative to the doses used in cases cited by the '248 patent. However, a 1999 publication
(the "Yakatan Abstract") 8,9 in conjunction with the '248 patent demonstrated clearly that
doses of quinidine/dextromethorphan within the ranges claimed by the '242 and '484
would have been obvious for the purposes of treating PBA.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 5/30


It is true that the Yakatan Abstract was published by AVNR employees, however, the
waiver that prevents publications by inventors from being considered prior art only applies
if the publication was made within a year of the priority date of the patent-in this case, the
Yakatan Abstract was published three years before the priority dates of the relevant
patents. The Yakatan Abstract showed that 2.5 mg of quinidine combined with 30 mg of
dextromethorphan would produce peak blood concentration of 42.75 ng/mL, while 25 mg
of quinidine produced a peak blood concentration of 96.9 ng/mL (both calculated solely
based off of figures given in the Yakatan Abstract). It also stated that the same level of
blood concentration was observed with both 50 mg of quinidine and 75 mg of quinidine,
and 25 mg of quinidine yielded 85% of the plasma concentration levels of 50 mg,
indicating that 25 mg of quinidine yielded close to the maximum effect in terms of
dextromethorphan inhibition, making it obvious that doses higher than 25 mg would not be
significantly beneficial to patients. Meanwhile, the '248 patent includes three examples of
patients for whom a combination of DM and Q treated emotional lability. Example 2
describes a patient successfully treated for PBA, whose DM blood plasma concentrations
"usually averaged between 43 and 55 nanograms per milliliter." 42.75 ng/mL, the peak
blood concentration generated by 2.5 mg of quinidine per the Yakatan Abstract, is nearly
within the range shown to be effective in treating patients in the '248 patent. Therefore, the
combination of these pieces of prior art demonstrate that very low doses of
quinidine/dextromethorphan well within the ranges claimed by the '242 and '484 patents
would have been sufficient to treat PBA three years in advance of the priority dates of the
'242 and '484 patents.


Plaintiff's Rebuttal


• The '207 and '248 patents do not make the composition of matter element of the '115
patent obvious because they do not list specific doses of dextromethorphan and quinidine
under their claims, while the '115 specifically claims doses of quinidine of "300
milligrams/day or less"


• The '242 and '484 patents are valid because the Yakatan Abstract and '248 patent are
not sufficient to claim obviousness. Focusing on Example 2 of the '248 patent amounts to
cherry-picking, and it is unreasonable to think that someone skilled in the art would have
motivation to reach a similar conclusion based on the prior art presented


Defense's Rebuttal
5/20/2018 Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell Disaster For Avanir - Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc (NASDAQ:AVN…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 6/30


• While 300 milligrams or less of quinidine is not explicitly listed under the claims of the
'207 and '248 patents, it is obvious based on the descriptions of the '248 and '207 patents.
They specifically included the results of trials done using 150 mg and 300 mg doses of
quinidine


• Focusing on Example 2 of the '248 patent is not cherry-picking-only two of the three
available examples provided blood plasma concentrations, and based on severe negative
side effects of overdosing, there was clear incentive to find the lowest effective dose.
Example 1 of the '248 patent does not provide the patient's blood plasma concentrations,
while Example 3 described a patient successfully treated for PBA with DM blood
concentrations that "usually averaged between 130 and 180 ng/ml". There is clear
motivation to find the lowest effective dose that could be used to treat patients because
the reaction can be severe in the event of an overdose, as was noted in the description of
the '248 patent:


"Dextromethorphan is believed to act at the phencyclidine (NYSE:PCP) binding site,
which is part of the NMDA receptor complex…One patient suffered a severe adverse
reaction at the 30 mg/day dosage of DM, when quinidine was co-administered. He
had not previously suffered any adverse reaction when DM alone was administered.
His reaction, which lasted several days, was similar to the hallucinatory and
psychotic reactions that are often observed in people who illegally abuse the drug
phencyclidine (also known as PCP or "angel dust")."


Combining the learnings of the '248 patent with the Yakatan Abstract, it is obvious that
doses well within the ranges claimed by AVNR in the '242 and '484 patents would have
been sufficient to treat PBA. Therefore, the patents are invalid because they are obvious
based on prior art.


We believe that the recent settlements are irrelevant, and the case that matters is the one
between AVNR and Par Pharmaceuticals, which was first to file its ANDA. Generic
companies that are first to file generally foot the vast majority of the legal bills in exchange
for a period of 180 day exclusivity, after which other generic competitors are permitted to
enter. We believe that the aftermath of AVNR losing the patent case spells certain
bankruptcy or dilution to pennies per share for investors in the near future


3) Other imminent events will negatively impact AVNR's cash flows and further
endanger AVNR's vulnerable cash position. After including the impact of the agreement
with OptiNose, AVNR's cash balance as of the end of the last quarter stood at $35mm,
with $30mm in debt. With consistent negative operating cash flows at $10mm+, debt

beginning to mature in 2014 at the rate of $3mm/quarter, approximately $1mm/quarter in
revenue from its docosanol ("Abreva") license disappearing next year due to the terms of
the license agreement, and increased costs of $2-3mm/quarter over the coming quarters
due to the OptiNose deal, we do not see how AVNR can survive through the next 12
months without significant equity offerings to shore up its balance sheet. Based on the
current price, even ignoring the entrance of generic competition and the off-label
marketing allegations, we believe these events have not been properly accounted for by
investors.


________________________________________________________________


AVNR also faces two other major issues in selling Nuedexta that we believe have largely
been overlooked by analysts and investors: lack of marketability for drugs to treat PBA
due to the nature of PBA as a relatively non-threatening symptom rather than a condition
in and of itself (in fact, because PBA is generally not even considered to be a disease, the
phrase "pseudobulbar affect" is not even consistently used to describe the condition-it is
also called pathological laughing and crying, emotional lability, emotional incontinence,
involuntary emotional expression disorder, emotionalism, and numerous other names),
and competition from antidepressants (which have been clinically shown to treat PBA,
and we believe, based on published data, are superior to Nuedexta in terms of efficacy,
cost, efficiency, and safety). At the same time, we believe that AVNR's pipeline will provide
no relief for investors-instead, it will likely accelerate AVNR's financial distress by
increasing R&D costs as well as requiring milestone payments to OptiNose and Concert
Pharmaceuticals:


I. AVNR has admitted that it does not have sufficient capital to independently fund Phase 3
trials for the DPN pain indication within its dextromethorphan/quinidine pipeline, and it
should be obvious to investors based on AVNR's financial profile. Given that DPN pain is
the most advanced indication in its pipeline, it is unreasonable to think that AVNR has
sufficient capital to fully fund any other Nuedexta-related indications


II. AVP-825 (sumatriptan delivered via a dry powder nasal spray to treat migraines) is the
only drug in AVNR's pipeline that is remotely close to FDA approval, and we believe it will
be virtually unmarketable-in terms of efficacy, it is dominated by competitors (among the
five triptan competitors we compared it with, AVP-825 showed the lowest therapeutic
benefit for patients in its clinical results!10,11) and on top of that, it requires patients to
blow air through their mouth to push dry powder through one nostril and out the other.
Further, the triptan market is set up in a way that gives an enormous advantage to the
cheapest options. While insurance companies will technically cover all available triptan

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 8/30


deliveries, we found that they frequently restrict the number of doses patients are allowed
to purchase for more expensive delivery systems (such as nasal and subcutaneous
delivery). As a result, tablets command over 95% of the triptan market, despite being the
slowest-acting and requiring the highest drug exposures! We believe that this, combined
with the uncomfortable administration method, will severely restrict the market share for
AVP-825


III. While AVP-786 (deuterated dextromethorphan combined with quinidine to produce
similar efficacy to Nuedexta with lower levels of quinidine) would have a lower dose of
quinidine than Nuedexta, we believe it will present no significant advantage over
Nuedexta/generic Nuedexta. Doctors would prescribe antidepressants to PBA patients for
whom quinidine presents a risk. The primary risk for prescribing Nuedexta is that quinidine
inhibits metabolism of many drugs, including dextromethorphan, antipsychotics,
antidepressants, and other drugs that are commonly taken by the type of patients most
prone to PBA. It has been shown that even at 2.5 mg, quinidine can produce a 15x
increase in plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan compared to patients taking the
same dose of dextromethorphan by itself, with the potential for similar effects when
combining quinidine with other drugs. Most drug-drug combinations with quinidine other
than dextromethorphan have not been tested, leaving a huge question regarding the
safety for patients taking multiple drugs that would be impacted by the quinidine inhibition.
We believe that, AVP-786 would only be able to reduce the quinidine dose to 5 mg, at
best. As a result, we believe AVP-786 will have no advantage in selling over generic
Nuedexta and represents a gimmick rather than a true advance in therapy


[*] Based on our research, discussions with medical professionals, and discussions with
ex-employees, we believe the total pool of marketable PBA patients is at least 75%
smaller than Management currently claims. Numerous articles have been published citing
a "CNS Scale" in estimating seven figure PBA patient populations, but unbeknownst to
many investors, CNS stands for Center for Neurologic Study and is an organization that
stands to benefit financially from any success AVNR has in selling Nuedexta due to an
agreement granting CNS royalties on Nuedexta revenue. We believe this has led to
perverted "estimates". In December 2008, Management estimated the US population at
roughly half of what Management is projecting to investors today ("likely over one million").
The next year, Management increased its estimate to "an estimated two million patients in
the U.S."

Good comment imo. 
After being in contact with management, Summer Street says Avanir "vehemently" denies the allegations
made yesterday by Gravity Research. The firm reiterates a Buy rating on the stock with a $17 price target. 
This attack creates a buying opportunity for those who are not yet invested in AVNR, imo.


Today there is an article at The Street with the head line:  
Trade Ideas: AVANIR (http://bit.ly/1eHIGHh) is todays "Dead cat bounce" stock.  
And that is why I would like to ask the author if he is working togehter with The Street or connected with them
in any form whatever. 
Maybe this is an orchestrated short atack - I don´t know, but I think it could be. There are a lot of shares short
that have to be covered. 
This maybe a buy opportunity to grab some cheap shares.

Piper Jaffray attributes last week's 30% sell-off in shares of Avanir to accusations of off-label marketing of
Nuedexta and concerns regarding the ongoing patent litigation. Piper views both issues as overblown and
says the pullback in shares is a buying opportunity. The firm keeps an Overweight rating on Avanir with a $30

game. Par is still pressing its case and they are the ones with the most to lose by failing to win that case. Had
AVNR settled with Par THAT would have been big news. The fact they promote the companies without much
of any vested interest in the patent case suggests they are trying to sell investors on the fact the patent case

"The fact they promote the companies without much of any vested interest in the patent case suggests they

I assume you mean that by "promote the companies" Avanir has issued press releases that they came to a
settlement. 
This is not "promoting" the companies. It's basically just reporting news.

You're probably right about off-label marketing, but I doubt it matters. A tough case to prosecute and little incentive for
the FDA to go after them for such a small drug.


I think you're right that AVNR's patents will fall (c'mon, it's a mix of quinidine and cough syrop......), but that may also
take some time to play out and judges in patent cases aren;t always the most savy scientifically.


AVNR did a nice move shifting attention to some BS asset with the optinose stuff, and that should be enough to fool
the next round of suckers into buying AVNR's inevitable secondary.

It isn't the FDA, but the DOJ that prosecutes these cases for the FDA. I doubt it is a tough case when so
many Pharma reps are complaining about off label marketing. Even a $50 or $60 million lawsuit is worth it.


Patent cases are never a 'Sure thing",but that is true for AVNR as well, and the percentage of companies that
lose patent cases favors the generic industry, not the innovator's. This will play out very soon since the patent
case is in court right now.


I think the behavior of the management speaks volumes about their integrity and honesty. They have oversold
virtually all their assets while the management has sold most of their own stock.

Pretty aggressive negative report. Extrapolating potential damages based on unrelated prior cases is sensationalistic
at best. But for an admitted shorter, totally expected.


It is mutually exclusive to say you do not trade, but you short.


I would suspect a response out of the company in the next few days. Unless they decide to not attract attention to this
"report".


And I must admit that I have never seen unsubstantiated and impossible to verify recorded conversations as a major
supporting point for a research report.


But, for now, the short side is winning. As of August 15, there were over 19 million shares short. The number for
September 15 is probably much higher.


Could be good for traders playing a short squeeze.

Any you don't know how to read - from your own link, the fight with Par is not over:


Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVNR) recently entered into a settlement agreement with Wockhardt to resolve
their patent litigation regarding Nuedexta. Wockhardt had filed an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to
get its generic version of Avanir’s Nuedexta approved.

However, with the litigation being settled, Wockhardt can now sell its generic version of Nuedexta on Jul 30,
2026 or before under certain circumstances. Avanir and Wockhardt have also filed for the dismissal of the
patent litigation.


We remind investors that in Aug 2013 and earlier this month, Avanir settled its Nuedexta patent litigation with
Novartis' (NVS) generic arm Sandoz and Actavis (ACT) respectively. Meanwhile, two other companies, Impax
Laboratories, Inc. (IPXL) and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc., have also filed ANDAs for their generic
versions of Nuedexta. Litigation against these ANDA filers is in progress.

sts66 is correct. There are four separate cases: two were settled and two are pending.


However, the author is making a tremendous leap in logic regarding Par's unwillingness to settle.

Yep. 4 cases, 2 of which have been settled and push out the generics until 2026. I fully expect the other 2 to
be settled in a similar fashion.


11 Sep 2013, 06:38 PM


Bentio Gonzalez
Actually, we have. Wockhardt, Sandoz and Activas were all minor litigants in the patent case. Par
Pharmaceuticals is the lead litigant in the patent case. The apparent reason AVNR has promoted this
settlement and the others with minor litigants was to make it appear everyone in the case is bailing out and
AVNR was on its way to winning. Hardly. they have a weak case trying to defend their patent.

However, over promotion of AVNR products is a hallmark of the present management. Remember their claim
that the OptiNose sumatriptan would make $100-$150 million per year. Right, the total nasal market for
sumatriptan is $120 million and they are going to take the entire market away from GSK. Right! Check out
who is leading this company and why he might be less than honest with investors. that is the way he treats
his customers as well.


11 Sep 2013, 07:16 PM


rayonman
Actually, Avanir has predicted peak Optinose nasal sumatriptan sales will be $150-$200 million per year. 
Also, around 2005 Avanir was saying there could be "over a million" PBA sufferers in the U.S. 
Based on surveys where there was a very low response rate and some of the responses were incomplete
and no report was made on those who did not respond, Avanir increased their estimate of U.S PBA sufferers
to 8 million. Coupled with the observation by a busy neurologist in practice for a good number of years that he
had seen one case of PBA made me think Avanir's new 8 million claim was not credible. 
Avanir sponsored a symposium in Manhattan in 2005 where the experts said that most patients with PBA live
in long term care facilities. So I think you may have your numbers wrong about that. 
The PRISM study was reported recently to show high percentages of patients with underlying neurologic
illnesses to have PBA but it seems that clinicians did not discuss the questionnaire or the patients' responses
with the patients. 
Patients frequently misunderstand questions on medical surveys and their replies may not really be
addressing the crux of the questions. 
Also there was a more liberal lower cutoff on the CNS scale of something like 13 which gave a higher
percentage than the stricter cutoff of 21 or so on the CNS scale. 
But the PR did not discuss the lower percentages with the use of the higher cutoff, only the higher
percentages with the use of the lower cutoff. 
I have not seen the 1999 presentation at the Pharmacology meeting but the pharmacology work by Avanir
apparently addressed the 10 mg quinidine dose, as well as the 25 mg dose. 
Avanir has said that 10 mg of quinidine gives 70% of the maximal inhibition of the cytochrome p450 2D6
enzyme given by 30 mg of dex. 
If that information about the 10 mg dose was made public in 1999, coupled with the 1995 publication by Smith
RA, Moore SR, Gresham LS, Manley PE, Licht JM The treatment of affective lability with dextromethorphan
Neurology, 1995 45, A330 that probably is a Phase 2 study of dex 30 mg with quinidine 30 mg twice a day
showing effectiveness for PBA, I think it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art in 1999 that 10 mg
of quinidine coupled with dextromethorphan could be shown to be effective for PBA. 
Disclosure: no position in Avanir

Did you read the report? I think calling even half of the report true is generous. Absolutely nothing is
substantiated, and some of it is pie-in-the-sky thinking.


For example, an outright loss in the legal proceedings is a VERY extreme projection, in my opinion. AVNR
has already settled with two of the four other parties (one just yesterday...poor timing for that research
company's claims). Both settlements seem favourable, excluding generics from the market until I believe
2026.


$100MM in fines and penalties for off-label marketing? Come on. InterMune (the basis for the report's off-label
marketing case) settled for $36.9M. Pfizer settled for $14.5M for off-lable marketing of Detrol in October 2011.
Novo Nordisk settled for $25M in June 2011 for off-label marketing of NovoSeven. $100M seems excessive.

Apparently Pfizer or Warner-Lambert paid $240 million in a criminal case for marketing Neurontin off-label
followed by $142 million in another case.  
"Wed Apr 3, 2013


* Epilepsy drug was marketed for migraines, bipolar disorder - court


* Appeals panel also revives two similar lawsuits


* Off-label marketing of Neurontin has earned Pfizer a criminal fine


By Nick Brown


April 3 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Pfizer Inc should pay about $142 million to cover costs for the
marketing and prescribing of epilepsy drug Neurontin for unapproved uses, a practice that has also earned it
a hefty criminal fine.


A panel of appellate judges in Boston on Wednesday refused to overturn a ruling in favor of Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan, which claimed it had been damaged after prescribing Neurontin for conditions it did
not effectively treat, based on fraudulent marketing by Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker.


In related appeals, the panel also revived similar claims from insurer Aetna and class action allegations from
Harden Manufacturing Corp, restoring lawsuits that had been thrown out by a lower court.


The ruling in the Kaiser case, which deals the biggest immediate blow to Pfizer, upholds a lower court's
decision not to grant Pfizer a new trial after a jury had awarded it $142 million.


The jury found that Pfizer had marketed Neurontin for bipolar disorder, migraines and neuropathic pain, none
of which had been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.


The verdict followed a $240 million criminal fine in 2004 paid by Pfizer's Warner-Lambert unit, as well as a
$190 million civil fine paid by Pfizer in connection with the off-label marketing.


Neurontin, developed by a Warner-Lambert unit, was approved in 1993 to treat seizures at a maximum dose
of 1800 milligrams per day. Warner-Lambert was later acquired by Pfizer.


The drugmaker initially forecast about $500 million in revenue generated by Neurontin, but in 1995 began
marketing it for off-label uses in an attempt to increase its earning potential -- a move that apparently worked,
reaping $2 billion from Neurontin sales in 2003 alone, the appellate court said."

LOL! In my opinion, this appears to be an obvious attempt by admitted shorts, to manipulate the market, i.e. run the
price of AVNR shares down in order to cover. A new firm out of Panama with no recognized history? I place far more
stock in the recent analysis and report out of Piper Jaffray, the highly respected 118-year-old US financial firm, which
recently reiterated its Buy recommendation on AVNR and upped its AVNR price target from $6 to $13.


11 Sep 2013, 04:22 PM


danl1988
Yep, shameless price manipulation. I'll take it though, since they created a pretty good buy opportunity. I
expect that once folks digest this information and do a bit of fact checking AVNR's share price will climb back
to its previous $5.50+ levels in short order.


I think I might actually start following Gravity Research though, because they'll continue to create good buy
opportunities. I missed the bottom by about 20 cents this time, but I figure the next time they manipulate the
price I'll be ready to capitalize.

Agreed that there is off label marketing but everything is one sided and posed negatively about the company. A real

a great buying opportunity.

Excellent point. Think of the people who believed the wild and unsubstantiated allegations in this article, and sold due
to the panic it created. There are laws in the US prohibiting this kind of market manipulation, but the jurisdiction of the
SEC may not reach into Panama where the brand new upstart firm (Gravity Research) is based, but whose IP
address is in Sweden. In any event, I do not buy it, and place far more trust in the recent report, analysis and new $13
price target for AVNR out of Piper Jaffray.

11 Sep 2013, 05:38 PM


OFP
I think the '484 patent points are illuminating (and flimsy):


The heart of their '484 argument is that the prior art 1999 "Katkin abstract" mentions the use of 2.5mg of quinidine
with 30mg dextromethorphan. In the 1999 abstract they claim this produced a peak blood DM concentration of
42.75ng/ml. They claim that this almost reaches the range seen in one of two patient examples given in the '248
patent where average blood concentrations were in the 43-55 ng/ml (concentrations were dramatically higher in the
other patient). Given the proximity of these values they feel it is obvious that based on the 1999 abstract the lower
dosage of Q would be efficacious. There are many reasons this argument is fallacious: 
1. Peak levels are by definition higher than average levels so comparing one to the other is not valid.  
2. Point #1 becomes rather ridiculous when the peak level don't even cross into the average level low end of the
range 
3. Point #1 and #2 become even more strained when the conclusion is based on a single patient 
4. The authors conveniently omit that the patient referenced in the '248 patent with blood levels of 43-55ng/ml
REQUIRED A DOUBLING IN HIS DM DOSE to maintain efficacy suggesting that the 43-55 ng/ml was NOT
efficacious.  
5. Data from this abstract were published by Pope et al in 2004. In that article the 2.5mg Q dose was shown to NOT
be effective so even if someone did think the 1999 abstract was "obvious" as to the 2.5mg they would have been
WRONG. 
6. The fact that Avanir used high doses of Q in their studies AFTER 1999 leading to FDA rejection in 2006 hardly
supports the contention that a lower dose was obvious


The rest of the report can probably be torn apart in similar manner (references to anonymous posts on CafePharma
that they could have planted themselves as "purported" employees?????). Gravity reports are distributed for FREE -
subscription is also free and can be done anonymously by providing any email. Why give away 47 pages of detailed
"research"?...the only answer can be they want you to follow their lead…i.e. they plan to make money by influencing
the market.


Pretty clear that this piece was purposefully bloated (47 pages!) which could be condensed to 1/10 that just so
someone (probably an associate who may or may not go by the "Chenz" moniker) could say something like "if even
HALF of the report is true…".

I believe there's a 30-month stay on FDA approval of generic that does not expire until December 2014 so not sure
the


"we estimate that generic competition would wipe out AVNR's quarterly revenue from Nuedexta by at least 80% by
the end of FY 2014"


statement is correct…unless you're suggesting the debt default and alleged off-label marketing woes will cause the
revenue drop. Maybe the answer is in the full report, which I haven't had a chance to read yet.

This article has stunned everyone because a rebuttal would have to be so lengthy to address all the points. I will start
with a few: 
Lack of marketability for drugs to treat PBA; 
AVNR just got approval to market Nuedexta in Europe....why no mention in the article? This is long awaited by many
sufferers in the EU and AVNR has patent protection there regardless of how the case turns out in the U.S. (although I
continue to believe that AVNR will prevail)


AVNR does not have sufficient capital to fully fund any other Nuedexta-related indictions: 
The report fails to mention anything about the Merck deal which will provide over $60million, nor do they mention that

AVNR is in talks with Big Pharma for Nuedexta in the EU which would provide upfront payments if AVNR accepts a
favorable deal.


OptiNose will be unmarketable in terms of efficacy? 
This claim is absurd. Not only is there efficacy, there is a need. Check out NuPathe's field research of Zecuity patch.
they have found overwhelmingly that Insurers are excited about the potential of saving costs related to migraine
sufferers with nausea and they are going to cover it as Tier 3 drug at cost of $100. OptiNose will be the same

Wannamillion, if these allegations are true and a case is brought against Avanir for off-label marketing in long

This is from the 1991 patent 5166207 where they called for doses of quinidine as low as 50 mg. 
Note that they apparently they looked for dex levels of at least 100. 
"Typical doses in orally acceptable pharmaceutical carriers would be from 30 to 300 mg, preferably from 50 to 150
mg, for dextromethorphan, and from 50 to 500 mg, preferably from 50 to 150 mg, for compounds of the invention such
as quinidine. These doses are for administration to a typical 70 kg human. Administration can be adjusted to provide
the same relative dose per unit of body weight.


A preferred formulation comprises dextromethorphan, quinidine, and an inert carrier suitable for use as an injectable
solution or suspension. Aqueous solutions, optionally containing minor amounts of an organic solvent, such as
ethanol, for use in increasing solubility, are particularly preferred. Preferred is an injectable solution containing from 30
to 300 mg, preferably from 50 to 150 mg, of dextromethorphan, and from 50 to 500 mg, preferably from 50 to 150 mg,
for compounds of the invention such as quinidine. The amount utilized for any particular patient will vary depending on
the body weight and particular use, as is well understood in the art. Typical concentrations in the blood stream on the
order of 100 to 1000 ng/mL, preferably 250 to 500 ng/mL, for dextromethorphan and on the order of 1 to 7 mcg/mL,
preferably 3 to 5 mcg/mL, for quinidine will be useful. "

This appears to be bogus. I don't have time to debunk all of the claims, but I'll mention a few.


1. Research company nobody's ever heard of. No employees, no address, no accountability. HUGE red flag.


2. The report itself is a lot of highly speculative or anecdotal claims (and lots of bold!) but not substantiated by a lot of
concrete facts. It's very sensationalized. For example: 
"AVNR’s capital structure will experience extreme pressure in the near future due to $20mm in upfront required
payments to OptiNose, $3mm/quarter in debt maturing starting in 2014, ~$1mm/quarter in revenue loss from
expiration of the US Abreva patents license next year, and $2-3mm/quarter in incremental expenses related to the
OptiNose deal. Even ignoring the off-label marketing and patent case issues, we believe significant equity capital
raises are necessary for AVNR within the next year in order to stay solvent."


So they need to cover about $6M/quarter (a generous estimate, in my opinion) + $20M upfront? AVNR has $55M in
cash. I expect some minor dilution, just like over the past year or two, but talking insolvency is overkill.


Or this claim: 
"Based on our research, discussions with medical professionals, and discussions with ex-employees, we believe the
total pool of marketable PBA patients is at least 75% smaller than Management currently claims."


You mean to tell me that this research group nobody's heard of found the PBA market to be 75% smaller than both
AVNR and the 8 analysts that follow it like vultures? Come on.


The off-label marketing claim seems to be largely based on the CEO Keith Katkin formerly working at InterMune,
which did some off-label marketing. Hardly incriminating, and as bio.bobby mentioned, off-label marketing is a tough
case to prosecute and the FDA has little incentive to even try. Assuming they do try though, and assuming that they
win, $100MM in fines and penalties seems highly unlikely. InterMune settled - both criminal charges AND civil liability
- for $36.9M, a relative drop in the bucket. That's about 4% of AVNR's market cap.


OptiNose: I don't think anybody's expecting the OptiNose to be a blockbuster, and its risk was already accounted for
in the share price as the OptiNose deal announcement didn't exactly build the price up.


Bottom line:  
1. The report is awfully suspicious. 
2. I trust analysts like Mizuho, Zacks, and Jefferies a hell of a lot more than this shadowy group. 
3. Could be a good opportunity to get in while the price is attractive.

about the Panamanians sources? Either investors are listening to these guys or these guys are REALLY tuned in. If

Gravity research?What does gravity do? Well, actually it pulls everything down!  
This will demonstrate how hard they will work to create the conditions that make their shorts payoff. My friend Leroy
works in the men's room at a quality hotel in Haiti, between earthquakes that is, and he said I should go buy AVNR
because I want to make some money. So I compare the quality of the alleged "report" from Gravity to the report from
Leroy, and low and behold Leroy comes up with higher credibility than the old 
"Pullem Down Gravity" boys soakin in the sun in my favorite place in all the world, Panama. Plesase don't blame
Panama-a beautiful place with some very fine and beautiful people. Those who believe the likes of this fraudulent

Thanks for the advertisement...I was able to sell off about 70% of my load and rebuy at a 50 cent discount and ended
up with even more shares for the same amount of cash. Those who were able to ride the trade-day congrats.
Honestly I thought I was going to lose a few thousand when it bounced back up, but I held out for the 2nd drop and
recouped my sale + more.


Hopefully the shorts didn't cover too much of that and were the major players in the drop. Hate to see some of the
long investors who had weak stomachs play into this ploy.


I'll admit when I first read it and saw the stock dropping I got a little squeamish that is until I went to the publishing
website and pulled the document.


Lets put it this way -- if you are a short hedge-fund you and you just shorted based on the publication of a document.
You probably made at least a few million dollars or saved a few million re-buying. Either way it was money well spent
on the production of this document. If the SEC were not doing the current investigations and playing hardball now i'd
be tempted to do the same thing and make a few quick dollars.


Once again thank you! I'm long looking at a long-term low target of $20 and a high of $100.

Yes i know 14B seems like a lot. But its not that far fetched. Gross revenue nearing 100M and we are just
starting. Multiply that by 10 and cut costs. You'll see a profit rift and something similar to multiplier buyout for
by big pharma looking to increase long term revenue.


Buddies with Merck who have 140B market cap? A talented sales team? A pipeline pill and now making a
deal with migraine medication that has a huge market? I was just in the pharmacy line and the lady was
complaining about the migraine was so miserable that she desperately needed the medication.


Its a no brainer....I'm just sad i cashed out 40k at 4.25 to buy some BP at 40.50 a share. I'm sure several of
you here like myself had you bought and sold AVNR at the proper times would be multi-millionaires many
times over. I made some good calls but most of all i've been long and just buying more on dips. After I missed
the MA train by trading my MA shares for profit back and forth on a few bucks, i learned my lesson the hard
way.

First of all, I am long in this stock.


I just read all 47 pages of their report, and I have to be honest, that is just horrible writing and quite honestly not

Most of their arguments I think can easily be refuted, and if I were management, I would have some response to this,

And one more red flag as if we didn't have enough is the fact they don't even bother responding to any of our
comments. Long AVNR let's see what happens next!


12 Sep 2013, 09:32 AM


OverSouled
Someone will have to explain this to me. The patent issue seems to turn on the following claim:


"the impact of low doses of quinidine on dextromethorphan plasma concentrations ("method of use") were
documented in a 1999 abstract (the "Yakatan Abstract")5,6 that was published and made publicly available three
years prior to AVNR filing for the relevant patents. We believe the data from the Yakatan Abstract in conjunction with
the earlier patents makes all three of AVNR's patents invalid due to obviousness based on prior art and/or double-
patenting"


and


" However, a 1999 publication (the "Yakatan Abstract") 8,9 in conjunction with the '248 patent demonstrated clearly
that doses of quinidine/dextromethor... within the ranges claimed by the '242 and '484 would have been obvious for
the purposes of treating PBA. It is true that the Yakatan Abstract was published by AVNR employees, however, the
waiver that prevents publications by inventors from being considered prior art only applies if the publication was made
within a year of the priority date of the patent-in this case, the Yakatan Abstract was published three years before the
priority dates of the relevant patents."


I cannot find a reference to "Yakatan et al., Low dose quinidine inhibition of dextromethorphan metabolism by
CYP2D6, Abstracts of the Twenty-Eighth Annual Meeting, American College of Clinical Pharmacology, September 16-
18, 1999, J. Clin. Pharmacol. 39, 984 (1999)" either in the journal or through an online search. I checked the online
issues of the journal for that year, and (1) Issue 9 ends at p. 950, and the last article is on a completely different topic;
(2) Issue 10 begins at p.995 (don't know why they skip pages, maybe advertising); (3) other annual meeting abstracts
are found in a search of the journal, but not this one.

Furthermore, an Abstract from a conference presentation, even if it was published, is not sufficient scientific evidence
to establish a basis to overturn a patent (it is not "prior art" in any meaningful sense) much less the drug safety,
dosing or interaction recommendations required to market something based on the putative finding. 10's of 1000's of
conference papers and abstracts are delivered every year, but acceptance for a conference presentation does not
require the same level of peer review as for journal publication. So I don't see how the alleged 1999 abstract, even if
published, would support the case against Avanir, and without having a physical copy of the journal with the 28th
Annual Meeting abstracts it's not even clear that it was published in 1999.

I'm not a lawyer but I would think any publication of information that makes an invention "obvious" would
qualify as prior art whether it is published or not. 
The important point that may have been publicized at that Pharmacology meeting was that 10 mg of quinidine
provided 70% of the maximal inhibition of the cytochrome p450 2D6 enzyme that 30 mg provided. 
With that information, along with the information of what was probably a Phase 2 study of 30 dex/30 quinidine
published in Neurology in 1995, Smith RA et al volume 45, A330 which probably showed efficacy for the 30
dex/30 quin dose would be enough for one skilled in the art to know that 10 mg of quinidine could work also. 


12 Sep 2013, 08:28 PM


OverSouled
I would agree that there is some ambiguity here. "Prior art" usually means published data, not hallway
whispers or privately circulated documents. The question here is whether an abstract of a conference
presentation constitutes "publication" in the relevant sense. I am not a lawyer either, but I am a scholar and it
is extremely rare that anyone cites a conference presentation, and then only if it is published in its entirety -
e.g., when a volume of a journal is devoted to the papers presented at an important conference. What take
the courts or the USPTO might have on this I can't say. I think patents are generally awarded much too
liberally, but I would find it unfortunate if a patent were overturned based on the idea that an abstract from a
conference paper constitutes previous public awareness of some scientific fact.

Thanks for taking the time to reply. 
From a capitalist point of view and in terms of encouraging innovation, I think Avanir deserves protection until
2026 and I hope they get it. 
That said, people in medicine do cite abstracts of research presented at professional conferences although it
does not carry the weight of a published article in a peer reviewed journal. 
Apparently, from the Gravity article, Avanir had a year to get that information patented but they did not get it

patented for three years (not until July, 2002). 
As for the concept of "prior art", I'm all in favor of changing the patent law and extending the 1 year time
period to encourage the sharing of medical information, but I think presenting data at a public medical
conference to professionals skilled in the art, qualifies as sufficient publicizing to assume that information was
available to others skilled in the art to make obvious conclusions. 
I would imagine there were several hundred pharmacologists, trolling around for information who at least had
access to that poster and I'm sure it was not presented as embargoed or confidential information. 
Even if Avanir only had a booth and only made a poster presentation, I take your point that it wasn't in a
widely disseminated journal or other report but my judgement is this is much more than a "hallway whisper" or
a "privately circulated document" and I suspect the difference is quite significant from a legal point of view
once an entity like a generic drug maker makes a legal case.

The Gravity Research article is being widely exposed as being patently false and ridiculous, IMO. The name "Gravity"
speaks for itself, and got the precise result intended, in that it generated a massive drop in the stock and huge short
covering, although there are a lot of shorts still out there. But, let's face it, Gravity research was created less than 2
months ago with a business address in Panama, and an IP address in Sweden. I do not believe there is any need for
AVNR to respond, as that would only call more attention to the article and give the impression that it was a concern. In
any event, the PPS has rebounded, several firms are advising accumulation of the shares, and there are a number of
firms with price targets for AVNR in the $10 -$13 range. Just too bad that a number of investors were probably hurt by
this shameful market manipulation. All IMHO of course.

Summer Street Research reiterates Buy recommendation and $17 Price Target.


"Gravity took its toll on shares of Avanir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AVNR) this week -- literally. The stock fell 30%
after a report chock-full of allegations was posted online by Gravity Research, which has a short position in Avanir.


Listed among the potential issues for Avanir were alleged illegal off-label marketing of Nuedexta, a perceived
likelihood of losing a patent case over the drug, and possible financial difficulties. Gravity Research stated that Avanir
was "doomed to fail as a company within the next two years."


As you might expect, Avanir didn't take kindly to the negative blast from the short-seller. Investment firm Summer
Street Research contacted the company's management team, which "vehemently" denied the allegations made by
Gravity Research. Summer Street subsequently reiterated its buy recommendation for Avanir with a one-year price
target of $17 per share."

The only way a short seller can book a gain is by closing out the position--and buying to cover the short. Gravity is in
the uncomfortable position of having to be a buyer to actually profit by the temporary decline.


Of course, they could expect AVNR to go much lower, but sometthing tells me that Gravity knows that the other
analysts are working on follow up research to refute the assertions of the Gravity report.


This rebound could be quicker than most expect.

their point or in some cases concede to new information. I mean say something. I wish SA could allow us to blacklist
an author. Not because I or anyone disagrees with them, but because they just don't care. They made the stock go

Nothing but dead silence out of Gravity Research, the 2-month old Panamanian firm who published the bogus article
on AVNR 2 weeks ago. they have not made any effort to defend the3ir article in the face of widespread criticism and
the exposure of the article as fictional nonsense. Let's hope FINRA or the SEC catch up with these drive by fiction

The short version Gravity Report said, "InterMune was found guilty of engaging in off-label marketing while Katkin
worked there". 
I think there was only a settlement, a $36.9 million settlement. 
But I don't think any wrongdoing was admitted. 
I think Intermune's CEO admitted to making false statements in a Press Release or something like that. 
Avanir's present CEO was the Vice President for Pulmonary Marketing at Intermune. 
The off-label marketing allegation brought against Intermune was regarding their drug Actimune for a Pulmonary
indication (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) which Actimune was not FDA approved for.
