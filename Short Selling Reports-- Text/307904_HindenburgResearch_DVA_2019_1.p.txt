DaVita is a $10 billion market cap dialysis company that derives much of its pro�ts
through a charity scheme that has been exposed by the New York Times and the
Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, among others.
The scheme involves DaVita donating to a “charity”, the American Kidney Fund, which
then guides individuals into switching from low-cost public insurers (that DaVita makes no
pro�t from) to high-cost private insurers (that DaVita makes a substantial pro�t from).
In California, a state estimated to account for 15-20% of the company’s dialysis business, a
bill has passed the state assembly that intends to close the charity scheme loophole.
The assemblyman who introduced the bill has called DaVita’s charity loophole a “self-
serving scam” and “a scheme to bankroll patients’ healthcare premiums”.
DaVita has responded to these legislative e�orts by quietly funding a group called
“Patients and Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients” that claims to be a broad coalition
acting against the bill in order to protect the interests of the poor and disadvantaged.
We spoke to numerous groups in the coalition; most readily admitted to not knowing
anything about the bill and/or simply taking their cues from lobbyists or other
organizations. Some didn’t even know they opposed it at all.
In reality, about 90% of the recent monetary support for “Patients and Caregivers to
Protect Dialysis Patients” comes from large for-pro�t dialysis corporations such as DaVita
and Fresenius. DaVita represented about 60% of the group’s funding over the last 2 years,
having donated over $67 million in that period.


Introduction


DaVita is Secretly Trying to Defend its
Charity Scheme with a Lobbying Scheme

We believe DaVita to be a corrupt healthcare organization whose historical success has relied
largely on gouging the healthcare system. The company has paid over $1.1 billion in the past 5
years to settle four DoJ False Claims Act allegations. (1
(https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-
claims-act-liabilities),2 (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/davita-rx-agrees-pay-637-million-
resolve-false-claims-act-allegations),3 (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/davita-pay-450-million-
resolve-allegations-it-sought-reimbursement-unnecessary-drug-wastage),4
(https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/davita-pay-350-million-resolve-allegations-illegal-kickbacks))
The result of these settlements has been to mitigate several pro�table (and allegedly illegal)
lines of business.


Now, DaVita’s most lucrative scheme is �nally becoming obvious to insurers, patients and
legislators following multiple media exposés. As a result, legislation is starting to speci�cally
target the company’s primary remaining pro�t center. We intend to highlight the legislative
challenges currently facing DaVita at both the state and national level that we believe will
persist until the loophole driving this scheme has been closed.


As DaVita works against one of its main legislative challenges of the moment, California
Assembly Bill 290, we sought to understand the company’s lobbying e�ort. We found that
DaVita is, in characteristic fashion, engaging in what looks to be underhanded lobbying tactics
in order to defend its charity scheme.


We at Hindenburg are typically known for taking short positions alongside our research, but
the truth is that we just like to call out scams when we see them. We have no position long or
short in DaVita (for reasons we will explain) but, nonetheless, we thought it would be important
to shed light on the ridiculous abuse of the medical system that continues under a cloak of
legitimate lobbying e�orts.


Background: Almost All of DaVita’s Pro�ts Come from
Commercial Insurance Payors


DaVita is the second largest operator of dialysis clinics nationwide. According to its latest
annual (https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/927066/000092706619000025/dva-
123118x10k.htm) report, it derives 79% of its revenue from these clinics.

The company acknowledges that it loses money on patients that use government insurance
(Medicare/Medicaid/Medi-Cal) and makes all its pro�t from patients using commercial
insurance, who are charged substantially higher rates for their dialysis services.

(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4136947-davita-healthcare-partners-dva-presents-36th-
annual-j-p-morgan-healthcare-conference?part=single))


Former DaVita CEO Kent Thiry said at the 2017 J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference:


The private payors dramatically subsidize the government. Most of our patients are
Medicare. In fact, about 85%, 90% of our patients are from the government sector. On
average we lose money on each one, which leads to a grotesquely large cross-subsidy
from the private sector to the government.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 4/17


Thus, the company’s pro�tability largely relies on its mix of commercial versus government
payors across its dialysis clinics.


Background on the American Kidney Fund (AKF), DaVita’s
Charity Scheme That it Uses to Juice Pro�ts


In late 2016, the New York Times highlighted DaVita
(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/25/business/kidney-fund-seen-insisting-on-donations-
contrary-to-government-deal.html?module=inline) as being party to a scheme whereby it
donates to a ‘non-pro�t’ entity called the American Kidney Fund (AKF), which then helps
convert patients from low-cost government payors (such as Medicare and Medicaid) toward
high-cost private commercial insurers.


In September 2017, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation highlighted exactly how
the scheme works (http://sirf-online.org/2017/09/22/davita-inc-warren-and-charlies-excellent-
insurance-gambit/) and how it results in billions of dollars dropping to DaVita’s bottom line at
the expense of the medical system.


The AKF targets low income and minority individuals who believe they will be getting better
care (when, in reality, many are being set up to pay higher costs or lose services later). The AKF
then pays for the patient’s co-pays, allowing dialysis operators to burden the commercial
insurers with extraordinarily high costs despite no apparent di�erence in treatment.


It is estimated that a year of commercial dialysis treatments for one patient can cost $160,000,
compared with $40,000 when Medicare pays for them.


Last year, DaVita and Fresenius (the two largest dialysis providers) donated $247 million
(http://www.kidneyfund.org/assets/pdf/about-us/akf-2018-audit-report.pdf) to the AKF. As of
2017, the AKF paid premiums for over 74,000 patients
(https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/health/kidney-dialysis-kickbacks.html), representing
almost 20% of the nation’s dialysis recipients.


Legislators Are Catching On: A Bill Just Passed the
California State Assembly Called AB 290 That Targets
DaVita’s Charity Loophole in The Crucial State.


Assemblyman: DaVita Involved in “A Scheme to Bankroll
Patients’ Health Care Premiums”

11/4/2019 DaVita is Secretly Trying to Defend its Charity Scheme with a Lobbying Scheme – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 5/17


In California, a bill called AB 290 (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?
bill_id=201920200AB290) just passed the State Assembly. It is directly focused on closing
DaVita’s charity loophole. The bill was introduced by Assemblyman Jim Wood, who, in his press
release (https://a02.asmdc.org/press-releases/20190128-asm-jim-wood-introduces-ab-290-
prevent-dialysis-companies-scamming-health) for the bill called the actions of dialysis
companies “a scheme to bankroll patients’ health care premiums.”


Commenting on the intention of the bill, Wood said:


Runaway costs in health care a�ect everyone, and I’m committed to protecting
patients but I’m not interested in protecting dialysis companies from scamming the
system for their own bene�t…


…When unscrupulous dialysis companies, through a third party, steer patients away
from Medicare or Medi-Cal by indirectly paying a patient’s premiums, for the
company’s own �nancial bene�t, these companies are price gouging and it’s a
scam. It doesn’t improve care for patients and increases the cost of health care
premiums for everyone.


The bill goes on to note the e�ect that the scheme has on taxpayers:


Nationally, this problem has added billions of dollars of costs to the individual and
group health insurance markets.


DaVita Is Now Defending Its Charity Scheme by Quietly
Directing Over $95 Million Into Lobbying Schemes


Rather than attacking the bill on its merits, DaVita instead quietly spent $95 million on
“advocacy costs” to fuel lobbying e�orts to wage a propaganda war against the bill and others
like it.


Keep in mind that net income attributable to DaVita Inc. for 2018 was only $159.3 million, so
the amounts spent are clearly material.

In California alone, DaVita has quietly directed $67 million in the past two years to a single
group in order to combat legislation aimed at closing its charity loophole.


Meet the California ‘Non-Pro�t’ Group Claiming to Defend
the Poor and Disadvantaged—Funded with Over $67
Million In DaVita Cash


The lead lobbying group working against AB 290 in California, “Patients and Caregivers to
Protect Dialysis Patients”, has set up a website (https://dialysislifesupport.com/) called “Dialysis
Life Support”. The group claims to be “�ghting to protect dialysis patient access to quality care.”


On its site (https://dialysislifesupport.com/), it argues that AB 290 is discriminatory and puts
low-income patients at a disadvantage. Speci�cally, the group states:


AB 290 attacks vulnerable, low-income dialysis patients by eliminating charitable
premium assistance (CPA) in California.


It sounds like a virtuous �ght. So, where does the money come from?


At the bottom of the lobbying group’s website, it notes that it is paid for by “Patients and
Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients, sponsored by the California Dialysis Council”.

Despite its public claims to be advocating for the poor and disadvantaged, the California
Dialysis Council’s organizational documents say that it was formed to act in the interest of
dialysis providers:


The speci�c purpose of this corporation is to provide state-wide representation
for end stage renal dialysis providers.


As we will show, “Patients and Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients” seems to be nothing
more than a cleverly disguised support arm for DaVita’s business, appearing to act in the
interests of protecting the company rather than patients.


The Non-Pro�t Group Seems to Conceal That 90% of its
Funding Comes from For-Pro�t Dialysis Providers
11/4/2019 DaVita is Secretly Trying to Defend its Charity Scheme with a Lobbying Scheme – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 8/17


FollowtheMoney.org shows that about $100 million, or 90% of the budget for “Patients and
Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients” has come from just two entities: DaVita ($67 million)
and Fresenius ($33 million), providers that collectively control
(https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180404/NEWS/180409959/dialysis-industry-on-
alert-as-calif-union-pushes-for-reimbursement-cap) 70% of the California dialysis market. 


Usually when you direct tens of millions to a non-pro�t cause they feature your sponsorship
and highlight how critical your donation is to the organization. They might even throw you a
dinner or name a building in your honor!


Contrary to that expectation, we see that DaVita and other for-pro�t dialysis operators are
instead buried near the very bottom of the list of coalition members on the lobbying group’s
website (https://dialysislifesupport.com/ab-290/#facts).

DaVita’s name falls well below relatively unknown organizations such as the “Scottish American
Military Society”, “Sacramento Valley Section-National Council of Negro Women, Inc.”, and the
“American Legion, Department of California”.

We Called the Organizations That Supposedly Back DaVita’s
Lobbying E�ort: Some Didn’t Even Know They Were
Opposed to the Bill, Others Had No Idea DaVita Funded the
Group


Since many of these obscure organizations were listed above DaVita and Fresenius on the list of
those who oppose AB 290, we �gured perhaps they were vital to the e�orts against the bill.


After calling numerous organizations on the list, a couple things became clear:


1. Most people we spoke with didn’t seem to have a grasp on the bill’s content, why they
opposed it, or how it was even brought to their attention in the �rst place. Some were not
even aware they opposed it at all.


2. Most of the organizations seemed small. Some were di�cult to get a hold of, with
“o�cial” phone numbers leading to personal voicemails and recorded messages. Another
had a defunct website.


Here’s what some of the groups that oppose the bill told us, in their own words:


Commander of the State of California American GI Forum:


As far as I’m concerned, I haven’t been informed about anything that’s out there or
stance that we take, etc., so I can’t really say why are we opposed to it.


CEO of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce:


Um, I’m trying to remember o� the top of my head which one this is. We’ve followed
some that have to do with dialysis for 2 or 3 years now, so I’m trying to wrap my head
around which one this is.


When asked if she knew they were part of the coalition: “Yes, but we’re probably in 50 or 60
coalitions.”


When asked if she knew DaVita and Fresenius funded the coalition: “That wouldn’t surprise me.
They’re trying to protect their interest obviously.”

https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 11/17


Legislative A�airs Manager at Valley Industry and Commerce Association: We asked if he
knew that most of the funding for the coalition came from DaVita and Fresenius. His response:
“Uh, no.”


Press Contact for the Desert AIDS Project seemed completely surprised that the
organization was involved in anything to do with dialysis:


This being Desert AIDS project…we have 6500 clients who are getting medical care
from us. Only half of them actually have HIV, the other half are just getting primary
care – a lot of those folks are getting treatment for Hepatitis C. So, when you’re talking
about kidney care, I’m like ‘wow, that’s interesting’


President of the National Veterans Foundation:


I really listen to those veteran lobbyists that advise the group…I just wait and look at
everybody and then once they say ‘hey, this is really good’ and they do a little
paragraph, I go ‘OK, NVF supports’.


Associate Director of Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association:


Normally we are in alignment with CMA’s view. If the CMA opposes something, most
likely we’ll be opposing it…Our main leader is the California Medical Association when
it comes to this opposition.


(Despite the California Medical Association seemingly guiding its local chapters, roughly a
dozen chapters were individually listed as opponents, in addition to the CMA itself. This gives
the appearance of a broad coalition of medical organizations opposing the bill despite the
direction coming from only one group.)


In other instances, we called organizations opposed to the bill and found that they either went
straight to voicemail or didn’t seem to have much of an organization at all.


For instance, the website address we found for the Chambers of Commerce Alliance of Ventura
& Santa Barbara Counties, www.chamberalliance.biz (http://www.chamberalliance.biz), came
up with a message that said “This Website is Disabled”.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 12/17


Our calls went straight to voicemails when we called the ROA Department of the Golden West
and the Black Women Organized for Political Action.


All told, despite dozens of calls to numerous organizations, we couldn’t �nd one well-informed
member of the coalition who read the bill or who could articulate clear reasons for their
opposition.


Charity Scheme Victim: The AKF Cost My Mom Her Last
Chance at a Kidney Transplant, We Were “Devastated”


The ultimate impact of this charade is signi�cant. Along with burdening the medical system
with billions in excess costs, the AKF has also impacted patients and their families.


The daughter of one victim recently wrote an op-ed for the California Capital Weekly
(https://capitolweekly.net/a-�ght-against-price-gouging-in-dialysis-treatment/), highlighting
DaVita’s scheme and how it led to her mother missing the opportunity for a possibly lifesaving
kidney transplant:



https://capitolweekly.net/a-fight-against-price-gouging-in-dialysis-treatment/
11/4/2019 DaVita is Secretly Trying to Defend its Charity Scheme with a Lobbying Scheme – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/davita-is-secretly-trying-to-defend-its-charity-scheme-with-a-lobbying-scheme/ 13/17


…It didn’t take long for us to realize what a mistake we’d made. Patient care
was never the priority of the American Kidney Fund. It was making a pro�t for its
funders, DaVita and Fresenius. Patients like my mom were encouraged to switch to
private health insurance because it lets the large, for-pro�t dialysis corporations make
more pro�t than they would from patients covered by Medi-Cal or Medicare.


After signing up with the American Kidney Fund, my mom started having to pay high
out-of-pocket costs for her medications – something she never had to do with Medi-
Cal. When she tried to schedule a normal appointment with her doctor, the clinic said
they couldn’t see my mom because they didn’t accept her new health insurance.


With all the money we were spending, we were getting so stressed. That’s when we
began trying to get my mom back into Medi-Cal, a process that took eight
months. By that time though, she was 68 and considered too old to be eligible
for a kidney transplant.


We were devastated. My mom’s dialysis clinic told us we were doing the right thing
by switching to commercial insurance paid for by the American Kidney Fund, and yet
she ended up with inferior coverage that cost my mom her chance of getting a new
kidney.


When California Assemblyman Wood introduced AB 290 he speci�cally called out this problem:


…patients caught up in these schemes may face higher out-of-pocket costs and mid-
year disruptions in coverage, and may have a more di�cult time obtaining critical
care such as kidney transplants.


Why We Have No Position in the Stock, Long or Short


We’d like to provide a quick note on the dynamics of DaVita’s stock. As investors, we look for
sustainable business models and therefore view DaVita as a terrible long-term business model.
That being said, we have no position today because the company has a liquid balance sheet
after the recent sale of a division (http://pressreleases.davita.com/2019-06-19-Optum-
completes-acquisition-of-DaVita-Medical-Group-from-DaVita), and has signaled an aggressive
intent (http://pressreleases.davita.com/2019-07-22-DaVita-Commences-Self-Tender-O�er-To-

While now we are primarily concerned with shining light on the company’s lobbying scheme,
we may reevaluate DaVita as a potential short down the road.


Conclusion: DaVita is Engaged in a Multi-Front Fight for Its
Life That We Expect It Will Eventually Lose, Though It Will
Take Time


Organizations that provide great service at reasonable prices don’t need to use underhanded
lobbying e�orts to save their charity scams.


While the proposed California bill has made some headlines, much of the work against it (and
against similar legislation in other states) is being done behind closed doors. The purpose of
our article today is to provide an update on the DaVita story and to shine sunlight into a
lobbying e�ort that appears, at least to us, to be yet another scheme born out of an already
existing scheme to further strain an already ine�cient healthcare system.

Always been curious why a dialysis provider (Davita) would have such a large, recently built,
apparently expensive high-rise building in a very expensive part of downtown Denver,
Colorado.
