Is Citizens Life Insurance A House Of Cards? Strong Sell

Summary


Citizens Inc. is a low-quality life insurance company trading at sky-high valuations of
66X P/E and 4.5x Price/Tangible Book, yet faces multiple total wipeout risks.


CIA sells insurance overseas without a foreign presence with questionable legality -
while a questionable "Stock Investment Plan" artificially generates temporary
demand inflating CIA's stock.


When foreign insurance regulators wake up, there could be huge fines that could
completely wipe CIA out - Brazil fined peer company NWLI $6 billion.


CIA has -75% to -88% downside just to trade at a similar valuation as superior peer
company NWLI. Multiple additional risks create potential for -100% overnight loss
and total wipeout.


The economies of CIA's largest end-markets in South America are imploding,
creating serious macro headwinds for CIA.


Citizens Inc. (NYSE:CIA) is a life insurance company that trades at sky-high multiples of
66X P/E and 4.5x Price/Tangible Book, despite anemic low-single digit ROE and nominal
growth prospects. I believe the stock is grossly inflated by artificial and temporary demand
generated by the company using policyholder money to buy its own stock. Furthermore,
the threat of regulation, devastating fines and an unraveling of its business all have the
potential to completely wipe out CIA stock overnight. Even if CIA somehow manages to
avoid all the ways it could be wiped out, when it re-rates to a rational valuation, CIA has
-88% downside from valuation alone.


This is how I see CIA's scheme, and I seriously question its legality:


1. CIA sells life insurance in developing countries where it has no legal presence, using
intermediaries where they "do not determine whether our independent consultants are
required to be licensed to sell insurance".


2. CIA then lends some of the cash from policy revenue BACK to the policyholder under
its "Stock Investment Plan".

3. The policyholder (in part through a Panamanian trust) then buys CIA shares in the
open market!


(chart by me)


How big is this scheme in proportion to CIA's total business?


I estimate 95% of CIA's life insurance is sold to non-US customers.
CIA states it has no international offices or licenses, and does not determine whether
independent consultants are licensed.
I estimate over 60% of the shares outstanding are now owned by these policyholders
(The 85 y/o CEO controls the company with super-voting "B" shares).
A shocking 75% of CIA's tangible common equity  is the $52mm of policy loans
In 2013, 52% of CIA's pre-tax earnings came solely from interest on these policy loans.


Anything where common stock is used as collateral for a loan reminds of Enron's famous
"special purpose vehicle" schemes Whitewing or Raptors that would buy junk assets using
Enron's own stock as collateral: when the stock began to decline in 2001, the whole
scheme unraveled with the rapidity of a margin call.


Why would policyholders need or want to borrow money from CIA at 7.5% to buy stock in
the open market, when they can get a margin loan from a broker today for <1% given how
low interest rates are? Why would they want to buy CIA's stock using this loan?
Something seems very fishy to me...

Is CIA Selling Insurance Policies Overseas Without a License? Isn't this illegal?


Insurance, especially life insurance, is a highly regulated business, where you need a
license to sell, underwrite or basically have anything to do with the business. When a
family has a death, they need to know that the company behind a promise made to them
is truly solid. Citizens earns 95% of its policy revenue overseas (as of the most recent Q),
and yet admits in its own SEC filing 10-K that it has:


"no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States" and "we do not
determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell
insurance in the countries in which they market our policies".


CIA lists as a risk factor:


"If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws,
including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would
reduce our revenues. We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign
jurisdictions with respect to these matters."


In developing countries, where CIA gets its premiums (Venezuela and Colombia are the
two largest sources, representing 22.3% and 19.5% of its total premiums respectively),
insurance regulators are unfortunately not as vigilant as in the developed US market.


If the regulators in these countries woke up and demanded all CIA associates be licensed,
could the existing premiums be rescinded, or could CIA be forced to cease operations in
these countries? Given the precarious set-up using CIA's own common shares for policy
loans, could this lead to a devastating "run on the bank" and wipe CIA stock out
completely?


I believe investors buying CIA stock at 66x earnings and 4.5x tangible book value are not
appropriately analyzing the potential for total stock wipeout and complete loss.


What extra risks do foreign citizens have in collecting claims from a company without a
license to even sell insurance in their country? There has been at least one class action
lawsuit where consumers sued in Texas, in an attempt to recoup their policy payments.
The lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S.
residents, when combined with a policy feature... were actually offers and sales of

securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas
securities laws. The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium
payments.


Is CIA Also Selling Securities Without a License Overseas? Isn't this illegal?


In addition to turning a blind eye to whether its agents are licensed to sell insurance, CIA
also appears to neglect whether these agents are licensed to sell securities.


According to the 10-K Risk factors:


"The majority of our foreign policyholders choose to invest their policy dividends or
other cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock
Investment Plan (the"Plan"). If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the
Plan's operation contrary to applicable securities laws, we risk facing fines and
penalties and cease and desist orders which would create a reduction in the
amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the
Plan."


It wasn't until January 2013 that CIA filed the proper documents with the SEC to allow it to
operate such a stock investment plan; therefore, I believe it's possible that all stock sold
under the Plan prior to this time period was illegally sold, and that the SEC could take
action against the company.


Potential Fines Could Be Enormous If Overseas Insurance Regulators Wake Up?


CIA could also get completely wiped out if overseas regulators get smart to what is going
on, and fine CIA for selling insurance without proper licenses. In fact, a very similar
company, National Western Life Insurance (NASDAQ:NWLI), was issued a $6 billion fine
after Brazil realized it was selling insurance without proper licenses:


"On October 26, 2011 the Brazilian Superintendence of Private Insurance ("SUSEP")
attempted to serve the Company with a subpoena regarding an administrative
proceeding initiated by SUSEP in which it alleged that the Company was operating
as an insurance company in Brazil without due authorization. The Company has
been informed that SUSEP is attempting to impose a penal fine of approximately
$6.0 billion on the Company."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2557775-is-citizens-life-insurance-a-house-of-cards-strong-sell 5/15


NWLI appears to be a larger, much more profitable company than CIA, with a similar
business model (except for CIA's uniquely questionable "Stock Investment Plan" that I
believe is temporarily dramatically inflating the price of CIA's stock). In fact, the
CEO/founder of CIA started his career at NWLI, and literally runs CIA across the street
from NWLI's offices! CIA's CFO also previously worked at NWLI.


Given the risks inherent in issuing international insurance without a license, as
demonstrated with the Brazil outcome, NWLI trades at a discounted valuation: a P/E of 8X
and P/Tangible Book of about 1.0x vs. CIA's astronomical 66X P/E and 4.5x Price/Tangible
Book. How else can one explain the massively higher valuation without the source of
temporary and artificial demand for CIA's stock generated by its "Stock Investment Plan"?


How Big Could a Fine be if Regulators Woke Up? - Venezuela Example


Brazil regulators woke up to NWLI selling insurance without a license, and in 2011, fined
the company $6.0 billion. CIA's biggest market is Venezuela, with about 22% of premiums.
I estimate that Venezuela alone could fine CIA amounts ranging from $110-882m. This is
an impossibly devastating amount for CIA, who only has $320m market cap and ~$70m of
tangible common equity.


A legal opinion we received estimates that:


"foreign insurance companies not licensed in Venezuela that insure risks "located in
Venezuela" are 1) unenforceable and 2) subject to a fine of one thousand (1,000) tax
units (approximately US$ 20,158.73 at the official exchange rate of Bs. 6.30 per 1
USD) to eight thousand (8,000) tax units (approximately US$ 161,269.84 at the
official exchange rate of Bs. 6.30 per 1 USD). Moreover, performing insurance
activities or insurance brokerage activities without a license issued by the Insurance
Superintendence, may subject the violator to criminal prosecution"


Using this framework, I estimate below that CIA could face a $880m+ fine from Venezuela
alone.

(chart and estimates built by me)


Policy Loans for the "Stock Investment Plan" Appear Unsustainable


CIA, like many life insurers, issues policy loans, which are loans originated by an insurer
to a policyholder, backed by the cash value of the insured's policy. While these loans are
usually benign, due to the previously described risk of policy rescissions at CIA, these
loans could prove to be toxic for the company. Because the collateral for such loans is the
underlying value of the life insurance policy (which accrues value with the payment of
premiums), if CIA is required to refund its customers' premiums, then the collateral against
which these loans were underwritten ceases to exist.


With no collateral backing these policies, CIA could run into major solvency issues,
particularly since the debtors are not US citizens, and CIA, as previously discussed, has
no offices, employees or assets outside of the US - which I believe makes collection on
these loans virtually impossible. With these policy loans now representing 75% of CIA's
tangible common equity (up from 38% just 3 years ago), losses on these loans could be
disastrous for CIA.


Additionally, in recent years, CIA appears to be relying on these high-interest loans to pad
its anemic earnings (as well as, reportedly, to enable policyholders to continue paying their
premiums, and in turn, buy more CIA stock). What's more, the interest rate "earned" on
these loans is well above normal at 7.4% vs. 3.8% for the rest of its investment portfolio;
accordingly, in 2013, 52% of all of CIA's pre-tax earnings come solely from interest on
these policy loans (in 2009, this figure was only 12%).


The enforceability of foreign laws to a US-domiciled company is a double-edged sword for
CIA. If you argue that it is not at risk of paying (potentially massive) foreign fines because
it lacks a foreign presence - you also realize that it could have a tough time collecting on
foreign policy loans that represent 75% of its tangible common equity!

"Stock Investment Plan" shares


It appears to me that CIA first used a Panamanian Trust for virtually the whole
administration of its "Stock Investment Plan", and according to a 2005 13D filing, this Trust
owned 17.4mm shares, or about 45% of the total shares outstanding. Today, this Trust
only officially owns about 10% because there was an administration shift to putting the
shares into the names directly of the policyholders for reporting purposes. Estimating
1.5mm shares bought per year through the program (pg. 8 of 2013 10-K), I estimate that
today over 60% of the total shares are owned via this plan.

South America Facing 2014 Recession and Riots: Could This Be The End for CIA?


It is no secret that South America is facing serious economic headwinds in 2014. Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela seem to have all entered recession in 2014, and I believe the
other countries in the area will be deeply affected.

What happens to CIA stock if CIA's policyholders stop paying premiums, cancel insurance

occurs while people are defaulting on policy loans?

Public Shareholders Have NO Voting Control Over Their Company


Perhaps most concerning, what do CIA public shareholders even own? Because the
potential insurance violations are occurring outside of the US - and therefore, not directly
harming US citizens - the Colorado Division of Insurance and other domestic regulators
have so far allowed CIA to continue to operate with near impunity in CIA's South American
markets (95% of its business). Moreover, because of special provisions in the Class B
shares, the company's founder, 85 y/o Chairman and CEO Harold Riley, who owns all of
the B shares which control the Board seats and thus the company - draws a salary of $1
million per year. Given that the publicly traded "A" shares are mostly mopped up by the
trusts and policyholders via the "Stock Investment Plan", this mechanism allows the
scheme to continue, while Riley can maintain control via the B shares.


Why is CIA Management Running CIA This Way? What is the True Purpose of This
Company?


CIA insiders have collected an absolutely shocking $29.1m (so far) in total compensation
(per CapIQ) since 1998. CEO Harold E. Riley alone has collected an astounding $11.5m,
and just the four Rileys listed by CapIQ have collected over $20m from this "business".


(chart built by me using CapIQ publicly available data)


Management Response:


I spoke with CIA's IR department, and was surprised by the lack of details and financial
assistance they were willing to provide. Initially, they tried to pass me on to the transfer
agent, an entity I believe would likely know virtually nothing about the details of CIA's
business. I have never had that happens to me before, and I found this quite suspicious.


Then, when I asked about CIA's international business, the person at CIA could not even
give any facts or figures to help explain CIA's exposure. When pressed for any information
about the policy loans CIA is making, the individual's response was "that is also not my

area of expertise". If the individuals at CIA appointed to help shareholders claims have
little or no understanding of the international business (95% of premiums) or the policy
loans (I estimate at ~75% of CIA's tangible equity), what exactly are they there to do? If
you are a shareholder of this company, I would encourage you to immediately call the
company and ask them for detailed answers about the international regulatory
environment they operate in, and I hope you get useful answers, because I certainly did
not.


In the past, there have been many sudden shareholder wipeouts resulting from the toxic
combination of financial leverage, regulatory risk and a lack of transparency. I urge
caution.


I encourage you to read CIA's internal "Purpose, Principles, Philosophy & Beliefs"
statement:


"The principles which guide our actions are: the ethical standard, morality, integrity
and spirit of our conduct should at all times be at a high level"


I personally find this ironic and more than a little offensive.

Conclusion: -88% Downside with Potential for Total Wipeout


I think that CIA's transfer agent, Computershare, should seriously investigate what is
going on with this "Stock Investment Plan"; and I believe the SEC and insurance
regulators in the US, Venezuela and Colombia also should take a deep look at this as
well. I do not think people should have to worry about trusting the livelihood of their family
upon their death to an insurance policy that may be sold without a license, which may be
unenforceable, from a company that appears to drive demand for its own stock with
"shaky-looking" methods.


Just to trade in line with comparable NWLI (which is much larger and more
profitable), CIA's stock would have to decline between -75% and -88% (depending if
you use a P/TangBook or P/E multiple).


Even more concerning, I see multiple ways CIA stock could get totally wiped out and go to
$0 overnight. When this comes unwound, I believe it will happen virtually instantaneously,
and I urge you to be cautious.


Lastly, CIA has abundant borrow at cheap rates, and so I view shorting CIA stock as an
essentially free option on the various ways CIA stock could go instantly to $0. There has
already been one lawsuit and inquiry, and I believe it is simply a matter of time before CIA
comes completely unraveled. In the mean time, you are short a low-quality insurance
company at 4.5x tangible book value that has negative retained earnings, where the
majority of the business is in imploding South American economies.

NWLI is very different than Citizen's both in valuation and their business practice.


NWLI provides a real product to it's customers and has a very long track record. Obviously i wish they would not have
the chairman's wife on the board and wish they paid out a bigger dividend.


we own NWLI for a few years sub 150. we expect in the next few years that book value will get to 450 bucks and the
stock will be earnings 35-40 dollars a share per year. And if rates ever go up to the 3.50 range on the 10 year we
could see 9% ROE and this trade back to .9x book value or 400 dollars (i am using end of 2015 numbers).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2557775-is-citizens-life-insurance-a-house-of-cards-strong-sell 14/15


Dear PS,


Allow me to put your drama into perspective. While you have some points in your analysis, statements on regulatory
threats and South American countries might have another interpretation, to say the least.


Devastating fines / regulation by Venezuela: Highly unlikely. It is a country sinking into Cuba-style Communism with a
record of poor to no enforcement of its many laws.


Venezuela is an oil-rich nation hostage to a rogue government. That is why policies like those offered by CIA are so
attractive to those who can still afford it there. The official rate of VEB 11 per USD is way stronger than the black
market rate of VEB 174/USD -the exchange rate you mention is only available form imports of medicines and food,
mostly by government agencies.


Therefore, a person standing to receive a monthly rent in US of a few hundred to a few thousand from a CIA policy
(marketed as a retirement plan) could live as lavishly as many of the corrupt government officials.


CIA has been selling policies in Venezuela for almost 50 years -I understand- and so have many other US and
European companies. ALL without an insurance company license or licensed dealers. NWLI, State Trust, a bunch of
insurance companies from Florida and Puerto Rico and a host of Isle-of-Man and channel island companies come to
mind.


Never heard of any of them being subject of even the mildest administrative complaint. Never heard of any unlicensed
dealer being prosecuted. I met several of them when they came to sell me their products while I lived in Caracas
(Venezuela).


If anything, the economic woes of Venezuela could hinder new policy sales (less than 15% of all company revenue)
and renewals (85% of revenue), but how much of this business does come from Venezuela nowadays?


As for South America being "chaotic" as another commentator said, well that is why some markets are called
emerging, and everything from sales to profits and risks are higher there than in mature, slow-growth markets like the
USA, Europe and Japan. Emerging markets are "chaotic" by definition and when they cease to be so they become
less of an opportunity investment-wise.


By the way, the riot pictures are from February 2014 (Venezuela) and April 2014 (Colombia). Things got much quieter
after those incidents. Venezuelan riots were crushed by Venezuelan military with the help of Cuban and Middle-
Eastern militia disguissed as Venezuelan military. In the end, over 30 people got killed and many were imprisoned
while the World looked the other way. The economic "implosion" has more to do with plummeting oil prices.


In Colombia, President Santos got re-elected despite protests, mainly beceause of his success in negotiating peace
with guerrilla leaders to end over five decades of conflict. Colombia has one of the most solid and fastest growing
economies of South America as a result. Not precisely a country on the verge of collapse.


Brazil is the "B" of BRIC countries and despite its economic headwinds it still accounts for roughly 50% of Latin
America's GDP (excluding Mexico). Businesspeople there have been used to invest their profits in US currency, away
from local tax authorities, for as long as I remember, some of it into US-denominated retirement plans. So its doubtful
that the ongoing downturn would make them change their minds, as it did not in the previous crises in the 70s, 80s or
early 90s.

In a way, the "chaotic country" argument is like saying foreing investors should not put money into US securities
because of the riots over the recent killings of African-American youngsters by White police officers in that country or
into Thailand due to the frequent coups there, or in Italy and France due to their economic malaise, and so on.


Thus, the statements on South American countries seem biased due to a US-centric perspective.


Things are different everywhere. Riots do no equate to imploding economies. Insurance regulators in Venezuela have
not and are unlikely to get tough on CIA or on any of the dozens other foreign insurance companies selling policies
there (marketed as retirement plans, annuities, and so on), economic woes actually make such policies more
attractive (as a protection of hard-earned wealth).


I give you a point for the rest: the Stock Plan, transparency issues, high P/E multiple, etc. Definitely, such issues
should be further explored by relevant authorities and investors alike.


Kindest regards

Hello,


Im felipe from Colombia, I have an insurance with Citizen, Which I aquired 11 years ago, I already payed 60.000 USD,
right now COP vs USD change about 60% in the last months, I read your article and I dont know if its a good Idea to
finish and get some of the money from the insurance, about 70% because I have to pay a penalty, but anyway the
60% increase in the USD vs COP (colombian peso) will help me to don´t lose money, what do you think? take into
account that in 3 months i have to pay the annual fee which is 5.000 USD, and I earn in COP, so the fee is 60% more
expensive than last year
