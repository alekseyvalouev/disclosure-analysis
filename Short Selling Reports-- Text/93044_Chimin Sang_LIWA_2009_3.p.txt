Short Ideas China


In my previous article, I discussed several problems of Lihua International (LIWA):
Unusual insider share unlock, discrepancies of 2008 revenue between its SEC filings
and local media, discrepancies of 2008 raw material purchase from Fushi Copperweld
(FSIN), dramatic increase of unit sale price of CCA, its main product, and dramatic
reduction of account receivable days and account payable days.


On Friday morning, Fushi Copperweld (which I will hereafter refer to as Fushi) released
its earning report for the third quarter, which helped shed more lights onto Lihua's
potential accounting fraud.


Fushi is special to Lihua because they are in the same sector and they sell to the same
market, in which Fushi is the industry leader. Fushi is one of the first in China to have
started Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) wire business, and it is the largest by far. Lihua
does not have the capability to clad copper over aluminum. Instead, it purchases CCA
wires from other manufacturers, the largest supplier being Fushi, and draws them
thinner. In some cases, paint is applied to the finished products for use in manufacturing
electric magnets. From the beginning of 2009, Lihua entered a low margin scrap copper
business. Fushi is both a peer and the largest supplier of Lihua International, which
makes the comparison of the two apple to apple.

Fushi disappointed its investors. For the third quarter, Fushi's revenue decreased 25%
compared to the same period in 2008. The analyst consensus was $55.4 million, a 13%
drop, but Fushi only made $47.7 million.


According to the management, "the decline was driven primarily by a decrease in
average selling price (21.6%) resulting from lower raw material prices." But what price is
the management talking about? On a consolidated basis, Fushi saw 3.7% decline in
output, which means 10,100 (2008 Q3 output) x (1-3.7%) = 9,726 tons and $4,904 per
ton. In my previous article, my calculation shows that the selling price of Lihua for the
first half of 2009 was $14,360 per ton. Hmm... Are these two companies truly in the
same industry?


Well, let's dig further. As in my previous articles, I will organize the findings in sub-
sections.


A. Significant Difference of CCA Unit Sale Price between Lihua and Fushi


To compare apple to apple, I compared the unit sale price of CCA, the main product for
both companies. For Lihua, it means that the new business of scape copper is not
included; for Fushi, it means non-China located sites are excluded since they are mostly
on Copper Clad Steel (CCS) business. Fortunately, all the supporting data can be found
in SEC filings for both companies.

Since the beginning of 2009, Fushi saw its unit sale price compressed due to the lower
copper price. However, Lihua's sale price has been defying the gravity. In the second
quarter, its unit sale price increased to a jaw-dropping $16,958 per ton, nearly 300%
premium over $4,349 per ton of Fushi Dalian.


There are quite a few problems associated with this huge difference, knowing that the
products are essentially the same with different thickness and the raw materials of Lihua
is the finished product of Fushi.


How can wire drawing create 300% margin?1.


How can CCA price of Lihua not following the margin-plus pricing scheme of the
wiring industry?


2.


Why is Fushi not adding some drawing machine to extract the profit of Lihua if this is
such a lucrative business?


3.


WHAT is the raw materials of Lihua anyway? The CCA raw material cost was $18.2
million for the second quarter. With the production 1,545 tons, the unit raw material
cost was $11,845 per ton. What is this kind of material? It certainly does not look like
anything Fushi manufactures.


4.


B. Significant Difference in AR Days between Lihua and Fushi


Though the two companies are in the same sector, their AR days difference makes one
feel like that they are NOT serving the same market.


AR days is the average days customers pays off the bill of the company. Many
accounting Shenanigan such as channel stuffing and irregular revenue recognition leak
their trace in AR days because AR days link the revenue with the balance sheet and the
balance sheet, as its name suggests, does need to be BALANCED. It is also much
easier to relax the account receivable collection than tightening the collection because
tightening collection typically causes customer loss.

For the last quarter, Fushi further relaxed its bill collection to retain their customers in
face of lower utilization of its capacity. Quoted from their earning release:


Accounts receivables at September 30, 2009 were $69.1 million compared to $49.8
million on December 31, 2008, an increase of 38.8%. This increase is primarily a
result of extended credit terms in 2009 to certain credible customers that have
long-standing business relationships with us in order to capture increased
market share.


While Fushi is relaxing the account receivable collection, Lihua is certainly NOT living on
THIS earth -- it was able to grow its revenue at full capacity without adding proportional
account receivable. The numbers suggest that customers have been flocking into Lihua,
paying them cash to buy products 4 times as expensive as they would from Fushi and
ignoring the generous pricing and payment terms from Fushi.


C. Significant Difference between Lihua AP Days and Fushi AR Days


Due to the well established supplier/customer relationship between Fushi and Lihua, the
payment period of Lihua paying TO Fushi is the exact same payment period of Fushi
receiving FROM Lihua. Thus we should expect some positive correlation between
Lihua's AP days and Fushi's AR days. Yet we see that these two are negatively
correlated from the following graph.

It is especially interesting to look at year 2008, in which Lihua buys 46.5% of its raw
materials from Fushi. (For more detailed relationship link, refer to my previous post)


Its prospectus states that "For each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006,
2007 and 2008, and the three months ended June 30, 2009 our five largest suppliers
accounted for 100% of our total purchases, and our single largest supplier accounted
for 31.9%, 26.8%, 46.5% and 21.1% of our total purchases, respectively." (page 70)


In year 2008, Fushi's AR days is 82 days and Lihua's AP days is 18 days. Even if we
assume that Lihua pays all other suppliers cash on delivery, Lihua's AP days would be
82 x 46.5% = 38 days, far more than the 18 days calculated.


========


Fushi is under the pressure of the economy slowdown: Its revenue did not make the
expectation and the utilization ratio of the Dalian facility dropped from 88% in the second
quarter to 78.6% in the third quarter.


Lihua, Fushi's downstream wire drawing firm, however, is able to get away with selling
the market finer wires at a quadrupled price with 100% utilization of capacity up to the
second quarter.


Well, maybe Fushi investors should fire all the management in face of the great
"achievement" of Lihua. Their "faults" include:


They could not shorten the account receivable days like Lihua did. It is huge saving
on the capital if they do.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.


They sold raw materials to Lihua only to allow Lihua to make 300% margin on it OR
They sold raw materials actually at more than $11,000 per ton but reported less
than $5,000 per ton.


They cannot sell their products at $16,958 per ton, like Lihua did.


They "grossly overlooked" how "lucrative" buying more wire drawing machines can
be.


Friday is a sorrowful day for Fushi -- its stock dropped 3.5% on the news, making its
market cap $186 million. It suffered a 26% drop in a month. Maybe the Fushi
management should learn how to fabricate fairy tales from Lihua, whose market cap is
now standing at $222 million. What a reward.


All my calculations are show in the following screenshot. The data are all from SEC
filings. Click to enlarge.
