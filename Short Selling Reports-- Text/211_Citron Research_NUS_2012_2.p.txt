Citron is Unraveling the Big Lies at Nu Skin  
 


Nu Skin is : 


 operating an illegal MLM in China,  


 in apparent violation of FDA and/or FTC regulatory law in 
the U.S., and  


 lying about a scientific research relationship with 
Stanford University for their flagship technology AgeLOC. 


 
And worse, they are instructing their own sales 
representatives to deceive anyone who questions the actual 
scientific basis of Nu Skin's product claims.

Update on the MLM and/or Pyramid Sales in China 
 


Last week Citron broke the story that Nu Skin retail locations were engaging in MLM and/or 
pyramid sales activity in China, both expressly forbidden by law in that country.  We posted 
multiple recordings and photos documenting our findings.  Since then, our operatives have 
submitted a new explicit audio and report from Hefei. 
 


In the report on this conversation, we see direct use of the word  金字塔 ("Pyramid") as well as 
"2000 downlines"  and "6 uplines".   (This new audio is available for download here.  )  Since the 
investment community is still in denial about the possibility of Nu Skin operating an MLM in 
China, Citron will continue to offer more evidence to back its opinion. 
 





Our contact attended a NUS conference in Hefei on July 7 ‘12. The conference started off as 
usual with a PowerPoint presentation showing before and after pictures of NUS customers. The 
host, Chunhui, explained to the group how AgeLOC products prevent aging. She told the group 
AgeLOC products revitalize aging cells with scientifically proven chemicals. 
  
The main speaker at this conference was Chen Jiajun.  Our contact has heard a lot about him 
from Li Shanshan. Jiajun graduated from the National University of Singapore, one of the best 
schools in his country. He has degrees in both computer science and finance. He told the group 
that before he joined NUS he worked for Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, where he was a 
branch manager in Tokyo. 
  
He explained every company’s corporate structure is like a pyramid, with a few executives at 
the top and numerous employees at the bottom.  Jiajun went on to say that NUS is composed 
of many pyramids, you are always at the top of your own pyramid while being at the bottom of 
someone else’s pyramid. 
  
Jiajun said people will never become rich if they choose to work for someone else and with NUS 
you can be your own boss. He explained you can make a lot of money with NUS if you take the 
initiative and purchase two or four spa machines. Our contact was previously told, by Li Rong 
and Li Shanshan, she needed to purchase four Spa machines to become a NUS distributor. 
  
Jiajun told the group he didn’t like Amway’s business model. He said Amway wants to develop 
every distributor into their customer. Jiajun claimed that NUS is not like this. Distributors of 


NUS can decide whether they want to use NUS products or not. Jiajun has 2,000 full-
time downlines in China. 
  
In NUS, every new distributor has 6 uplines who will help train the new distributors. He said 
they will help you because every one of your uplines will make 5% commission from your sales. 
  
Our contact told Jiajun that she didn’t believe AgeLOC products could stop the aging process 
altogether. Jianjun then confessed to her that their advertisements exaggerated the effects of 
the AgeLOC products, but he pointed out that NUS doesn’t specifically say in their ads how long 
one’s age can be locked for.

But moving on, in our research of Nu Skin, we've discovered something equally as disturbing as 


operating an MLM in China, and it's a whole lot closer to home.  
 


Nu Skin is in apparent violation of US law, puts its products at 
risk of being deemed drugs and medical devices by FDA and FTC 
 
"Anti aging" claims are currently a hot-button topic for the FDA.  In March, 2012, FDA issued the 
following alert regarding cosmetics with "anti aging" marketing claims, stating:  
 
"This import alert represents the Agency's current guidance to FDA field personnel regarding 
the manufacturer(s) and/or products(s) at issue." 
 


 
 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_188.html 


 
Contrast the above FDA document to the statements the company makes about its 11 
products that use its extensively-marketed AgeLOC technology.  Specifically, the company 
purports that its AgeLOC brand is based on claimed "proprietary science" that makes the 
following pseudo-scientific claims: 
   











There are numerous skin care products on the market with exaggerated 
"anti- aging" claims which cause the products to be unapproved new 
drugs. Examples of such claims are that the products "counteract," 
"retard," or "control" the aging process.  Claims that the product will 
"rejuvenate," "repair," or "restructure" the skin may also be drug claims.  
A claim such as "molecules absorb and expand, exerting upward pressure 
to 'lift' wrinkles upward" is a claim for an inner structural change that 
would usually cause a product to be a drug.  


Charge:  "The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to Section 
801(a)(3) in that it appears to be a new drug without an effective new 
drug application (NDA) as required by Section 505(a)."

Not exaggerated enough ?  Read on.  





* "Nu Skin, in collaboration with anti-aging and genetics experts, HAS 
IDENTIFIED key groups or functional clusters of genes—YOUTH GENE 
CLUSTERS—THAT HELP INFLUENCE HOW WE AGE. Nu Skin believes that 
finding and identifying these functional groups of genes is the key to 
TARGETING AGING AT ITS SOURCE. " 


* ...ageLOC science identifies and targets groups of genes ... resetting the 
genes related to aging toward a more youthful, harmonious state. 


* Resetting Youth Gene Clusters is a subtle balancing process—it’s not as 
simple as turning them on and off. Some genes within the cluster may 
need to be turned up while others may need to be turned down. Nu 
Skin’s proprietary ageLOC science resets Youth Gene Clusters to create a 
youthful balance within each cluster—returning them to more youthful 
patterns of activity. " 


* "Nu Skin next identified groups of genes that play a central role in the 
aging process, key arSuperMarkers called Youth Gene Clusters (YGCs). 
Using proprietary ageLOC science and ingredients, we have found ways to 
reset these YGCs to reflect a more youthful profile. " 


* On various promotional videos, Nu Skin's Chief Scientific Officer states 
"These products are incredibly safe, even though they work at the genetic 
level." 


*  "by understanding how gene expression changes with age and how to 
externally influence it through gene expression modulation"   


And finally, our favorite: 


*  "That's why we are very confident with AgeLOC we have found this 
Fountain of Youth – we have found how to unlock the secret of youth by 
restoring those YGC's.  [ Youth Gene Clusters ]

These are not just a few stray loose words.  There are hundreds of such specific, pseudo-
scientific references to the purported benefits of the "AgeLOC science":  


 throughout all of the marketing literature printed and produced by the company in 
multiple languages 


 on the company's websites for Nu Skin's products 


 on numerous online videos of statements by company officers, distributors and others 
about Nu Skin's products and science 


 public statements made to the media and analysts by its Chief Scientific Officer and its 
CEO and other company scientists  


 as well as countless statements made by thousands of Nu Skin distributors trained to 
sell the company's products by repeating these claims throughout the United States and 
over 50 other countries.   


 
Fourth "A": ageLOC Algorithm 
The fourth "A" refers to the ageLOC Algorithm. This may be a difficult word 
to understand so let me explain. The reason why Google dominates the 
Internet search business is because it has a special algorithm that allows it 
to search the Internet quickly and accurately. That’s how they dominate. 


Similarly, we have developed an ageLOC biological algorithm that provides 
a roadmap for how we look at the aging process. With this algorithm, we 
can more accurately identify age-related genes, categorize them into youth 
gene clusters, and target and reset them to a more youthful pattern.  That’s 
why ageLOC is so exciting to all our scientists and why we believe we will 
dominate the industry. 





Fifth "A": Aging Response Modulators 


The fifth advantage is particularly meaningful. Through our unique ageLOC 
scientific approach, we have created an entirely new category of anti-aging 
products – we call them Aging Response Modulators, or ARMs for short. 





In essence, our ageLOC scientific understanding is enabling us to develop 
products that promote youthfulness – in essence; we’re rebalancing genetic 
activity to a more youthful pattern. That’s why ARMs is such a powerful 
term, and why it’s going to accommodate everything that we are working 
to develop through the ageLOC scientific approach to product 
development.

The Bull vs. Bear Debate 
In the heat of the moment during a live CNBC debate last Thursday, a significant red 
flag in Nu Skin's filings was glossed over glibly by Deutsche Bank analyst William Schmitz 
during our little "Bull vs Bear" segment  which was drifting off the main debate topic  -- (which 
had been whether Nu Skin's is operating MLM sales pyramids in China):  
 





Andrew Left [Citron Research]:  "… this "great product" was actually was refused 
admission into the United States this past spring…by the FDA" 


William Schmitz [DeutscheBank]:  "It wasn't approved by the FDA … it's factually 
incorrect…" 


Andrew Left:  "It's actually in their filings…"     
( … at the 5:30 to 6:00 mark here -  ) 


   
… and at that very moment Herb Greenberg  interrupted ….  





Herb Greenberg:  "Andrew, wait, if we took this entire Chinese situation away, if 
it just disappeared, what then would be your opinion on Nu Skin ? "

In light of the information documented in this report, Citron can now respond fully:   
 


 
 
Citron had much more to say about Nu Skin, and the time has come to expose it fully.  This 
report reveals much more ominous risk to Nu Skin's business than last week's debate could 
possibly cover.  DeutscheBank's William Schmitz went on to hang a "17 multiple" on Nu Skin's 
projected earnings; the 7 other Wall Street analysts all reflect similar thinking.   
 
Our discussion continues with the facts Andrew Left wasn't given the time to explain on CNBC -- 
Nu Skin's product shipments, "detained" by the FDA, as disclosed in its last four 10-Q reports.   
http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001021561&type=10-
Q&dateb=&owner=include&count=40   (Search on FDA in the top four 10-Q's)  
 
We've provided a summary of the filings' disclosures of the matter.  Then follows a review of 
questions investors should demand disclosure from the company about, and our risk analysis.  
 


Nu Skin's disclosures about product "detained by the FDA": 
 


Summary:   Over the course of its last four quarterly 10-Q's, the story of detention of Nu Skin product 
shipments by the FDA unfolds.  In November 2011, one shipment was detained, with the company 
stating the FDA believes the product may require clearance as a "medical device" In May, they 
disclose two other shipments of the same product as was detained in March.   
 
The product detained was Nu Skin's "Galvanic Spa System", an electric device it sells to consumers 
intended to be used in conjunction with cosmetic substances applied to the face.  At present, neither 
the FDA nor Nu Skin has disclosed that the matter is settled.   


"Disgregarding the fact that Nu Skin's worldwide selling 
practices are illegal in its fastest growing market (mainland 
China), and that the company's flagship product line is 
deceptively marketed and breaks U. S. and international 
laws, most notably those of the US  Food & Drug 
Administration, and that they are lying about their scientific 
research relationship with Stanford University... ignoring all 
that and hanging any significant multiple on the stock is like 
asking "Besides that Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"

Citron asks the hard questions. 
 


Nu Skin's disclosures in this matter are misleading and deficient -- investors should demand the 
company come clean:  
 


1)  If this dispute with FDA is over the matter of of classifying the product as a "medical 
device", and/or AgeLOC marketing claims about the product, how will this affect other 
Nu Skin products?  


2) Why hasn't the company released any disclosure of communications with FDA on this 
product?  


3) Why would the company attempt to ship two more loads of product, when one is 
already in "detention"?  Is it a lack of internal controls, or was the company trying to pull 
a fast one?   


4) Where is that product currently located, and what is its status? 
5) Is this product subject to similar regulatory scrutiny in mainland China, prompting the 


need to sell it in Hong Kong?   (Citron observes that the product is not approved for sale 
in Taiwan.)  





Because the company hasn't released this information, Citron has 
filed for copies of FDA and FTC files through a Freedom Of Information 
Act request, and will continue to update investors with its findings.

AgeLOC is the Key  
… but is it the key to the fountain of youth or an FDA Cease and Desist letter  ?  
 


If you are an investor in this company, you'd better know about AgeLOC – Nu Skin's brand name 
for a purported set of technologies which Nu Skin has identified as its core sales strategy.  As 


Anti-aging scams: 
Despite claims about pills or treatments that lead to 
endless youth, no treatment has been proven to slow or 
reverse the aging process.

Dr. Joseph Chang, Nu Skin's "Chief Scientific Officer" proclaimed recently during the video of his 
presentation (See the YouTube Links on the next page) :   
 








AgeLOC is an entire branding and marketing strategy, the centerpiece of Nu Skin's sales effort, 
designed to promote Nu Skin as a "science leader in "anti aging technology", spanning at least 
eleven products covering cosmetics and dietary supplements, in addition to devices.  
 
Look at the language used by Nu Skin's Chief Scientific Officer Joseph Chang at the recent Hong 
Kong convention, where he instructs 20,000 distributors on how to sell the company's AgeLOC 
product line, resulting in over $100 million in sales to distributors on the spot.  
 
While it would be easy to blame the misstatements of any MLM company on a few rogue 
distributors, these quotes come directly from Nu Skin's "Chief Scientific Officer", as his direct 
instructions to his sales force … and the whole thing is on YouTube!

a 5 to 10 Billion Dollar Company over 


the next five years."

Not only is Dr. Chang instructing them to be deceptive, he is instructing them specifically how 
to deceive anyone who is questioning the actual scientific basis of Nu Skin's product claims".:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT4U9WNdKEQ   The conference   


"When you talk about AgeLOC, it's very simple.  Don't worry 
about the science.   Because the science is really for 
scientists.  Those scientists are complicated people, and they 
use many difficult words to explain the science.  Don't get 
confused with the science, leave it to our 100 scientists, both 
in China and in the US, to to worry  how we make our 
products.  ...   


All you have to do when you talk about AgeLOC  is to say 
'Unlike any other company, we are the only company that 
can attack the fundamental sources of aging.  Every other 
competitive product are just products used to cover up the 
skin, for example.  And if they have a dietary supplement 
product line, it's all a matter of saying 'believe me, they're not 
using scientific evidence to prove that their products work" ... 


That's why we are very confident with AgeLOC we have found 
this fountain of youth – we have found how to unlock the 
secret of youth by restoring those YGC's. [Youth Gene 
Clusters]"

Stanford University Denies Involvement in AgeLOC 


After researching all this material, it was difficult to believe that one of the most prestigious 
universities in the country would lend the gravitas of its name to be the main source of 
credibility for AgeLOC.  So before we published this report, we reached out to Stanford, and 
you will not believe what we found.  
 


Nu Skin relies heavily on references to Stanford University's name for 


much of its scientific research credibility 
http://www.nuskin.com/global/images/ageLOC/en/stanford.html  


Stanford University 


"Researchers at Stanford have focused on gene expression during human development 
and aging, and have also explored novel modes of gene control in aging skin. Nu Skin’s 
agreement with Stanford aims to increase the understanding of fundamental aging 
mechanisms in humans by translating insights from basic science into human 
application. The agreement also includes access to Stanford’s expertise in 
dermatological clinical trials." 
 


https://www.nuskin.com/content/liveandlookyoung/en_AU/science.html 


"Nu Skin is taking the science of anti-aging to a completely new level by studying the 
genetic origins of how and why we age. Developed by Nu Skin in collaboration with 
leading scientists from Stanford University and genetic experts at LifeGen Technologies, 
ageLOC science is based on the discovery of internal sources of aging that contribute to 
an aging appearance."

Nu Skin (AgeLOC) relationship to Stanford established through 
Dr. Stuart Kim, Ph.D. professor in Genetics 
In particular, Nu Skin announced the appointment of Stuart Kim, Ph.D., professor in Stanford's 
Department of Genetics, to its scientific advisory board in January 2010 with the full PR treatment: 
  
http://www.nuskin.com/content/nuskin/en_US/corporate/media_center/press_releases/2010/pr20100
111.html  


Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS), a premier anti-aging company, announced Stuart Kim, 


Ph.D., professor at Stanford University in the departments of Developmental Biology and 
Genetics, as a new member of the Nu Skin Anti-Aging Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Kim will 
provide insights on the molecular analysis of aging science.  


 
 
Dr. Kim appears with a photo in Slide 18 of this Powerpoint presentation "Ageloc-products.ppt" 
available for download at many sites around the internet.  
 


 
 
 
And he appears here, with photo, halfway down the page in Nu Skin's company newsletter "The 
Source", with a feature a link to a USA Today story about Dr. Kim that has nothing to do with Nu Skin.

Citron spoke to Dr. Kim and this is what he told us: 


 Dr. Kim worked for two years looking for Youth Gene Clusters while being promised 
funding by Nu Skin. 


 The relationship did not go well, and there was zero data created through Stanford 
University. 


 Dr. Kim never received any funding from Nu Skin.

Citron Research:  Nu Skin Page 13 
 


 All of Dr. Kim's research papers posted on Nu Skin's websites have nothing to do with 
Nu Skin, and were never done in collaboration with Nu Skin 


 Dr. Kim resigned from his advisory board position in 2011.  The company did not 
announce it. 


 Yet Nu Skin continues to use the goodwill associated with Dr. Kim's name in its 
promotion of AgeLOC 


 Dr. Kim wants nothing to do with Nu Skin. 
 
Stanford University's legal department has been contacted. 
 
The one line that sums it up most clearly is Dr. Kim's statement to Citron:   "At best, it was a 
failed collaboration."   


 
Nu Skin's Unsubstantiated Medical Claims for AgeLOC :  On the 
line or over the line, for the FDA and the FTC?  
 
The FDA has no choice but to investigate the marketing claims of AgeLOC, because so many of 
Nu Skin's products, including the "AgeLOC Galvanic Spa"  and the "Galvanic Spa Facial Gels with 
AgeLOC " (meant to be used with the detained Galvanic Spa facial units) plus at least 9 other Nu 
Skin products including both cosmetics and dietary supplements, are identified with the 
AgeLOC brand and therefore the AgeLOC medical claims.   So what are these claims? 
 
Just some of these marketing claims appear above in the first red box above.   After consulting 
with experts in the field of FDA regulation and the law, it is Citron's opinion that each one of 
these statements, as well as hundreds more, subject AgeLOC products to the risk of intense 
FDA /FTC scrutiny and possible intervention.  If you are going to make revolutionary medical 
claims, about cosmetics, you had better be prepared to prove those claims if the FDA deems 
them to be medical claims.   Ditto for medical devices, and FDA is already at work on Nu Skin's.  
 


Claims of affect to the structure and function of the human 
body trigger FDA requirements for proof of safety and efficacy  
 





 
 
Yes there are exceptions for "Generally Recognized As Safe: (GRAS) substances, which are 
allowed to the extent that they are foods.  Examples are food extracts, vitamins and herbs.  
While the specifics of enforcement are looser for dietary products derived from foods, 


A product intended … to affect the structure or function of the body 
is classified as a drug   


-- (FD&C Act, Section 201(g))  



https://www.nuskin.com/content/nuskin/en_US/products/nuskin/ageloc.html
Citron Research:  Nu Skin Page 14 
 


producers are still subject to requirements that they be able to substantiate all medical claims 
to regulators.  
 
Allowing Nu Skin to make such exaggerated claims is an affront to all the pharmaceutical, 
biotech, and legitimate cosmetic companies that spend literally billions in research every year 
trying to prove safety and efficacy of products that can positively impact the health of all of us.   
 
Nu Skin's language is not merely marketing hype for a simple wrinkle cream.  How do you think 


the FDA regards a family of products that claim to be "working at the 
genetic level" and targeting, influencing, and resetting the process of 
gene expression?  With an algorithm?   
 


To make Nu Skin's preposterous pseudo-scientific claims even more absurd, consider that the 
family of AgeLOC products doesn't even share a universal active ingredient.   


 In the case of its supplement, AgeLOC R2 [AgeLOC R-Squared], a day/night capsule 
regimen costing $160 a month, the active ingredients are Cordyceps Mushroom mycella 
and ginseng, (day), and grape seed, red orange and broccoli seed extracts (night).   


 In a cosmetic product, a potpourri of other ingredients including Equol (a non-steroidal 
estrogen), pea extract, bamboo extract and hyaluronic acid (a common ingredient in 
cosmetics) 


 In another cosmetic product, narcissus bulb extract, salicin (from willow bark) and 
Schizandra Chinessis (Five Flavor Berry) extract .  





Nu Skin's R&D spending  
 
Nu Skin discloses its R&D spending as follows : 
 


"Our research and development expenditures were $10.4 million, 


$12.4 million and $13.6 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011, 


respectively" 





So for $35 million spent over three years, Nu Skin wants its customers, its 
distributors and investors to believe that its products work at the genetic level 
to attack aging, and soon the same for weight loss.  But they can't say 
"manipulate" – that's too close to a medical claim, so they say "reset", which 
leaves the experts, the public, and their own sales reps baffled as to what it 
really means.

What are the potential consequences of Nu Skin's tightrope 
walk with the law?   
 


Citron believes the issues are numerous, the consequences are severe, and this obvious 
uncertainty is not reflected in the analysts' multiples. 
 
Nu Skin has bet the company on "AgeLOC", and here are just some of the possible 
consequences, both in the US and worldwide: 
 


 Ordering a recall of every product in the U.S. marked with the AgeLOC brand? 


 Ordering retraining for every distributor in the US as to what statements are legal and 
illegal in marketing any of Nu Skin's products? 


 Refusal of all shipments of inventory being imported into the US until this matter is 
remediated? 


 Demanding the company delete every reference to AgeLOC and its unsubstantiated 
medical claims from the company's websites and its distributors' internet 
communications?  


 Ordering Nu Skin to publish a series of public statements to retract its unsubstantiated 
claims? 


 Civil penalties? 
 


Investors need to assess the likelihood of collateral financial risks, including: 


 Financial costs of reimbursement of returned product in the channel 


 Loss of distributors "share of mind", trust and goodwill 


 Customer refunds for consumed or unconsumed product purchased under false 
pretenses 


 Class action and individual lawsuits by distributors, customers and shareholders in 
multiple jurisdictions 


 Loss of reputation within the U S and worldwide  


 Loss of regulatory approval needed to import products into other countries  (the US FDA 
is a very influential reference point for many other countries' policies and procedures) 


 Loss of capital invested in building distribution networks due to consequential damage 
 


Time for Full Disclosure 
Which brings us back to the point that started this entire discussion.  The company owes 
investors a duty of disclosure of all events which might be material with regard to investment 
decisions made by market participants.   
 


1)  It should start by making full and candid disclosure of the actions management has 
taken since being informed of MLM and/or pyramid sales activity going on in multiple 
locales in China.

2) It should make a full disclosure as to the status of its regulatory situation with the FDA 
and/or the FTC.  


3) Has any conclusive scientific data supporting AgeLOC's medical claims ever been come 
from Stanford University's research collaboration with Nu Skin?  


4) Has Nu Skin ever submitted any statements referencing a research relationship with 
Stanford University in response to any FDA or FTC questions about any matter under 
those agencies' jurisdiction?  


 
Citron Research has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the FDA and FTC 
regarding Nu Skin and its marketing claims, and will keep investors apprised of its findings.  





Revisiting the "Bull" vs. "Bear" Debate:   


"Limited-Time Offers", "Distribution load" or "Channel Stuff"?  
 
Nu Skin presented this disclosure in their most recent Q: 
 


Q2-2012 10-Q  
 


"Significant revenue growth in the Greater China region was 


driven by successful limited-time offers of our AgeLOC R
 2 
 


[dietary supplement] and AgeLOC Galvanic Body Spa [device] and 


related products [cosmetics] in connection with our Greater China 


regional convention held in Hong Kong in June." [bracketed 


comments added by Citron] 








This event was described as a "a one-time distribution load" by DeutscheBank analyst William 
Schmitz.   Citron thinks it is more accurately described as "Channel Stuffing".   
 
Why did the company orchestrate this transaction at this time?  When it knew products 
described by the identical marketing claims were under FDA "detention" and subject to the 
same looming threat to its entire product strategy?   
 
What is the need for a "distribution load"?  What does the company know about this product 
and its marketability over the next year that you don't know?  
 
Citron also asks:  While the company wants you to believe this product was sold in Hong Kong, 
how much of it was knowingly intended to be taken back to mainland China by the distributors 
as its surrogate import agents?  And by the way, are those two products even approved for sale 
in China?

Are all the MLM companies this bad?  
Citron has frequently been asked this recently.  So we surveyed the marketing language on the 
websites of Amway, Avon, Herbalife, and Usana.  Citron isn't endorsing these companies' 
business models or products -- they all may have other issues.   
 
But none of them make pseudo-scientific claims so exaggerated that they risk being 
unsubstantiated medical claims.  In nearly all instances, their marketing language for cosmetic 
products and dietary supplements is very careful – and very similar to the language of similar 
products found in stores.    
 
Even in the world of MLM's it appears to Citron that Nu Skin has ventured far beyond the 
rhetoric of traditional Multi-Level-Marketing companies, and has crossed over into the world of 
unsubstantiated medical claims, where its competitors have all restrained themselves.  
 


The Future for Nu Skin 
From the sound of Nu Skin's AgeLOC promotional language, aging is about to be a thing of the 
past.  But the company isn't going to be limited by that.  They've just discovered a way to use 
the same process of gene manipulation to effect weight loss – again by resetting gene clusters. 
And this time, it's not the Chief Scientific Officer talking …  Nu Skin CEO Truman Hunt is 
personally making these claims too!

Hey gentlemen, good morning. 


Truman Hunt:  Hi Bill. 


Bill Schmitz:   Is there any way you can give us sneak peek into 
what the weight management products would be like next year? 


.... 


Truman Hunt: Well, you’ve going to get a good sneak peek of the 
product offering itself in our November Investor Day conference. 
But remember that, the ageLOC platform is all about the 
formulation of products to maximize the right kind of generic 
expression and that is the unique angle of this weight management 
product is essentially we’re going to reset the gene clusters that 
have to do with weight loss... 


The revenue impact is going to be enormous. 


-- Nu SKIN CEO Truman Hunt -- Q2 Conference call, July 26 2012

   Conclusion 
Citron stands by its evidence of MLM and/or pyramid sales operations in China at the time of 
publication of this story.   
 
But now Nu Skin appears to be headed for a moment of truth with the FDA.  Citron can't 
predict exactly when it will happen, but it is obvious from its own filings that the process has 
begun and is well along.   Each day that passes is a day that harms all legitimate companies in 
biotech, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and dietary supplement industries, because it is a day in 
which Nu Skin is allowed to compete unfairly and illegally with a raft of flimsy and 
unsubstantiated medical claims.   
 


Citron thinks this is an amazing moment in time, where "the truth is hiding in 
plain sight".   Nu Skin's officers should either be on the cover of Time Magazine, 
or on the top of the list for FDA and FTC regulators.  
 
Cautious investing to all.
