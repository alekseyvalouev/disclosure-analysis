ProPetro Holding Corp (PUMP): There’s No Fracking in Cabo 
 


“Girl the last time you saw me I wasn’t this cool, 


And I'm hangin' out in Mexico down by the pool 


In Cabo, Cabo San Lucas 


If I send you a ticket would you fly in? 


I'd sure like to see you we could hook up again 


In Cabo, Cabo San Lucas” 


– Toby Keith 


 
ProPetro chose not to provide a response to our original report: Bloomberg stated that “a PUMP representative 
said the company doesn’t have a comment at this time,” while Reuters stated that “ProPetro was not immediately 
available to comment.” We find two possible explanations for this non-response. First, the Company chose to not 
respond as a response would further implicate management and the Board in the numerous issues we originally 
outlined. Second, management may have just been hungover from their apparent weekend trip to Kansas for the 
Texas Tech football game: 
 


  
 
We couldn’t blame ProPetro executives entirely if they preferred to take the following week off; it was a tough 
loss as a fumble on a blocked field goal return allowed the Jayhawks to win on a 32-yard field goal as time expired.  
 
As ProPetro management evidently found the game important – more so than, say, filing its overdue financial 
statements or scheduling Q3 earnings – we thought investors might care to know the game’s outcome as well.

This trip isn’t an anomaly; from January 1, 2018 to the present, flight logs show 248 total flights, including round 
trip flights and layovers. Most of these flights are to and from Texas destinations, which is fair, given that the 
Company is based in Texas and operates in the Permian Basin. However, we sorted and counted 59 trips (round 
trips, not flights) made in the same time period that we cannot easily explain as business-related. See our 
appendix for the full table. These trips include: 


 
1) Numerous warm weather / vacation destinations such as Cabo San Lucas, Mexico; Las Vegas, NV; 


Monterey, CA; Scottsdale, AZ and Orlando, FL. 
 


2) Long weekends in Hayden, Colorado in both January 2018 and 2019, presumably for ski trips. 
 


3) Locations such as Springdale, AR; Charleston, SC; Wichita, KS; Topeka, KS and St. Paul, MN, where, 
coincidentally, a Texas Tech University team was playing football or basketball that day.

We’re all for spending time with family, but we find this sheer level of non-corporate travel to be illustrative of a 
CEO who would rather be jet-setting than running the Company. It is also telling that the $717,481 in 2018 
compensation that the Company paid Sam Sledge, IR Director and son of COO David Sledge, was not enough to 
entice the formulation of a response to our report, even over a weekend when Texas Tech wasn’t playing ball. 
 
We challenge management to show some commitment to the business by answering the following questions: 
 


1. Given Alan Douglas is a signatory on multiple undisclosed entities that name ProPetro executives and 
employees, how does the Board justify Douglas’s role as both (a) an “independent director” per NYSE 
listing standards and (b) a member of the Audit Committee responsible for the recent “internal review”?

2. How much has CEO Dale Redman paid to Alan Douglas in each of the past 3 years, given their numerous 
undisclosed professional and personal entanglements? 


 
3. By what conditions did the Company declare “substantial completion of fact finding for [its] internal 


review” given the myriad of conflicts of interest and related-party entities that remain undisclosed? 
 


4. How much did ex-Chief Accounting Officer Ian Denholm receive from property sales to ProPetro? Given 
Denholm’s separation agreement stated, “that he will assist the Company with respect to its investigation 
of the Clarabby Transactions,” by what conditions did ProPetro also declare “substantial completion of 
fact finding for previously disclosed internal review”? 
 


5. How many of ProPetro’s vendors were owned, in part or in full, by ProPetro executives, board members, 
or employees as of year-end 2018? 
 


6. How many ProPetro employees are immediate family members of other ProPetro executives, board 
members, or employees? 


 
7. What is the extent of ProPetro’s contractual relationship with Diamondback Energy? 


  
Since going public, ProPetro has reported third quarter earnings on November 6, 2018 and on November 1, 2017. 
As the calendar has now turned to November and the Company has yet to schedule or hold a third quarter 
conference call, let alone file second quarter financial statements, investors might not otherwise have the chance 
to receive answers to these questions for quite some time. We remain short ProPetro.
