Whitney Tilson Announces New Short Position In Questcor

Whitney Tilson on  Questcor


I hadn’t gotten around to writing about one of my newest short positions, Questcor Pharmaceuticals


Inc (NASDAQ:QCOR), so I owe a debt of gratitude to this article in tomorrow’s NY Times, which does a


nice job of laying out key parts of what I believe is a scam of epic proportions (I’ve also included theepic


recent Barron’s and Seeking Alpha articles that the NYT article links to).


You really can’t make this one up. Just over six years ago in Aug. 2007, this stock was at $0.35 – so how


did it increase 158x to today’s closing price of $55.18, giving this former penny stock a $3.3 billion


market cap? Easy: just increase the price of its one product (H.P. Acthar Gel, a 60+ year old drug


acquired for $100,000) from $40 to more than $28,000 a vial (that’s not a typo – a 700x increase!).


Believe it or not, our insane healthcare system allows this, as insurers are paying it – which, of course,


means that all of us are.


Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:QCOR) has done all sorts of questionable things to juice


Acthar sales so various investigators are circling and medical professionals are asking tough


questions, so the smart money is betting that this is a house of cards about to collapse (38%


of the �oat is short). But in the meantime, many investors, cheered on by Wall St. “analysts”,


are drawn to the company’s rapid growth, sky-high 40% after-tax margins, and modest


valuation (12.7x trailing EPS and 7.2x EV/EBITDA).

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson Announces New Short Position In Questcor


https://www.valuewalk.com/2013/12/whitney-tilson-questcor-short/ 2/7


 


The bulls have been winning this battle so far – see the three articles below in Barron’s and


StreetSweeper and the Citron report from 2011 and 2012, when the stock was much lower – but I think


the gig is just about up.


PS—Sometimes it’s better to be lucky than good. Had I learned of this company a couple of years ago


and read the articles below and attached, I probably would have shorted it. But instead I came late to


the party – so was able to short it last month (my average cost is over $60), which probably makes me


one of the few people who’s ever shorted this stock who’s in the money!

Drug Maker’s Donations to Co-Pay Charity
Face Scrutiny
By ANDREW POLLACK


Published: December 18, 2013 80 Comments


As drug prices have soared in recent years and insurers have increased co-payments, a new type of


charity has blossomed to �ll a vital niche — helping patients pay the steep out-of-pocket costs for


their medicines.

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson Announces New Short Position In Questcor


https://www.valuewalk.com/2013/12/whitney-tilson-questcor-short/ 3/7


Drug company Questcor is both a donor and a
bene�ciary of a fast-growing medical charity. That
could give investors aches and pains.
O�-duty cops secured the meeting rooms at the Gaylord Texan Resort last month, as the Chronic


Disease Fund held its yearly conference at the Dallas-area hotel. Days before, the medical charity had


canceled the registrations of some would-be attendees and refunded their $1,500 donations. The


uninvited then got threatening lawyers’ letters from Questcor Pharmaceuticals, a drug company


that’s been a backer of the charity and a bug zapper for short sellers.


Questcor’s letters said the barred guests must have bought tickets for the charity’s fundraiser and


conference to get nonpublic information and manipulate Questcor stock (ticker: QCOR). Those letters,


which several Wall Street recipients showed to Barron’s, told the interlopers to prepare for litigation


and to stop contacting the Chronic Disease Fund and its a�liates.


Questcor And The Chronic Disease Fund: Is
Free Drug Truly Free?

truly-free


Disclosure: I am short QCOR. (More…)


In February of this year, we posted an article on Value Investors Club detailing the aggressive


accounting used by Linn Energy (LINE). Subsequently, on July 1, LINE announced that the SEC


launched an investigation into LINE’s usage of problematic accounting practices that arti�cially


in�ate their reported distributable cash �ow (DCF). The result was an immediate 32% stock price


decline and the real possibility that LINE’s $4 billion acquisition of Berry Petroleum (BRY) will be


scuttled. Questcor (QCOR) is another company with some questionable dealings and it is already


being investigated by the U.S. Attorney General’s O�ce in Pennsylvania. In particular, we question the


manner in which Questcor conducts its free drug program in conjunction with the Chronic Disease


Fund. Given the issues we raise with Questcor detailed below, we wonder what may come next.


Despite the fact that Questcor appears optically cheap, trading at just 13x 2013E EPS, we believe the


company’s increasing reliance on its co-pay and free drug programs operated in conjunction with the


CDF can potentially put earnings at great risk as these programs are scrutinized.

Plenty of other suckers who were glib about being one of the only shorts "in the money", only to have their arses
handed to them a few months later.

not a smart guy from what i've read - according to wiki on Tilson. follow him at your own peril.: 
When Google had it's IPO in 2004, Tilson famously said in 2004 Motley Fool article, "Google with the same
market cap of McDonald's (a stock I own)?! HA! I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be
highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to
that." [7] Note: Since then (as of 10/18/13) Google has gone on to give it's investors over a 1050% return

Yes only QCOR is helped by the CDF. not - I don't hear you talk about the other 75 drugs or many other
companies involved. Oh only QCOR has an expensive drug. I don't hear you talking about the industry. Didn't
GILD just have a drug approved and the therapy is 110k. Go short them. Your article is misleading and I hope you
lose all your money.
