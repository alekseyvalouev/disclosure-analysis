ZERO's Current Scheme Is Nearly Identical To The Program That Led
To An SEC Halt And Fraud Charges In 2001
Sep. 25, 2012 8:40 AM ET46 comments
by: Infitialis


Since publishing our first report on August 8, 2012, our public track record of exposing
alleged fraud or folly has recorded 5 out of 5 wins with the most recent OTC:CLSR
declining by as much as 56% yesterday less than 24 hours after our expose was
published. And while readers will not be able to verify this independently we had prepared
our second NASDAQ report on PPHM which was due to be published this week only,
shares of the company dropped by 76% yesterday making our report obsolete.


The purpose of this opening rant is to communicate to our readers that when we publish a
report on a company, we have generally spent hours upon hours poring through the
regulatory filings as well as conducting background checks on nearly everyone involved
with the enterprise. We view our track record as merely a testament to the fact that the
information we uncover is so material to the investment making process that it causes an
imminent revaluation of the share price.


History Repeating


Today's report may provide some of our readers with a surreal case of Déjà vu in what is
yet another unique OTCBB experience. We have uncovered a company trading at a $242
million valuation that not only has zero revenues, just $59,892 in cash, and $3.6 million in
negative shareholder equity (liabilities that exceed assets) but was sued in 2001 by the
SEC for engaging in exactly the same type of promotion that we believe has led naïve
investors to purchase the shares en masse contributing to a 300% gain in the share price
in less than 10 days. Investors and their short memories have apparently forgotten how to
use the handy SEC website as anybody could find the well documented case of
management hyping shares with dreams of a new technology that would revolutionize a
multi-billion dollar industry. We believe the case to be so identical that we have decided to
write the report in a format that places the SEC case on the left and the current promotion
on the right highlighting the similarities in the most efficient manner. This is the story of
Save The World Technologies, Inc. (ZERO.OB)

Readers can decide whether this is an R&D Facility for a quarter billion dollar company or
an AAMCO Tune Up Shop.


Side by Side Comparison of 2001 SEC Case against ZERO and the Current Efforts
to Manipulate the Share Price


From the December 2001 SEC Litigation Against


ZERO and it's then CEO Jeffrey Muller


The 2012 ZERO Stock Promotion


10. STWA is a Nevada corporation. At all relevant times,


its principal offices in the United States were located at


1285 Avenue of the Americas in New York, New York.


STWA's common stock is registered with the Commission


under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Until July 20,


2000, STWA stock was quoted on the over-the-counter


bulletin board ("OTCBB") under the ticker symbol ZERO.


On July 20, 2000, the Commission temporarily


suspended trading of STWA securities. STWA's stock


currently is quoted on the "pink sheets."


Nearly everything has remained the


same:


Still incorporated in Nevada


Still trading under the symbol ZERO


Still called "Save The World"


Same website at:


http://www.stwa.com/


Has yet to be Halted


Nearly everything is the same in the


company's current description of its


business on its most recently filed 10Q,


note the company provides ZERO


disclosure of its well documented SEC


case from 2001.

1. From at least February 23, 1999 through at least April


17, 2001, Defendants STWA and Muller, STWA's


former chief executive officer and president, engaged


in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for


stock in STWA, a public company. STWA and Muller


used press releases, Internet postings, an elaborate


Internet website, and televised media events to


disseminate false and materially misleading


information about STWA's product and commercial


prospects. STWA's and Muller's actions artificially


inflated the price and trading volume of STWA stock,


causing its market capitalization to be as much as


$218,728,062.


Since January of 2012 ZERO has


distributed no less than 27 press


releases, while building an elaborate


website filled with media events, product


presentations, and even an investor


newsletter which have led shares of


ZERO to increase by over 300%. This


while an invisible hand has been buying


and selling shares of ZERO using a


relatively unknown broker dealer in


Texas named Tejas Securities. In both


July and August of 2012 Tejas had the


highest reported volume (non retail) in


shares of ZERO. Together these actions


have manipulated investors into buying


shares of ZERO at artificially inflated


prices causing the market capitalization


to rise to $242,791,135 even though


the company has just $59,892 in


cash, less than $200,000 in assets,


and over $3.6 million in liabilities.

2. STWA's business purportedly involves the


manufacture, licensing, and distribution of a device for


motor vehicles called the "Zero Emission Fuel Saver"


("ZEFS"). Arranged by Muller, STWA engaged in a


promotional media campaign to generate interest in


STWA and the ZEFS. The promotional information


distributed by STWA falls generally into two


categories: (A) announcements of significant


licensing agreements and other important business


developments; and (B) announcements concerning


public automotive demonstrations that purportedly


proved or would prove that the ZEFS materially


reduces emissions and improves fuel economy in


motor vehicles. The foregoing representations by


STWA were false and misleading and were made


without reasonable basis in fact. The purported


licensing agreements and other purported business


events simply did not exist, and the ZEFS


demonstrations did not prove that the ZEFS actually


worked as represented.


Directly from the June 30th, 2012 10Q:


STWA's business now purportedly


involves the design, licensing and


development of products that reduce


operational costs for oil pipelines.


Specifically the AOT technology which


reduces the viscosity of crude oil,


thereby making it less restrictive to


pipeline transport. The promotional


information distributed by STWA falls


generally into two categories:


announcements of significant licensing


agreements and other important


business developments; and


announcements concerning public


demonstrations that purportedly proved


or would prove that the AOT technology


materially reduces the viscosity of oil


allowing with its beer budget balance


sheet to challenge the laws of physics


and innovate in the $100 Billion+ R&D


Energy industry.

3. Blackwelder prepared and arranged to have issued at


least one false press release announcing a major


licensing deal. That transaction did not exist. Blackwelder


also posted positive messages about STWA on an


Internet stock message board without disclosing, as


required, that he received shares of STWA as payment


for the promotion. Blackwelder's postings were materially


misleading because they created the impression that


Blackwelder was expressing unbiased views about


STWA and its stock, when he was actually a paid


promoter.


Only the SEC can figure this out by


using their subpoena power. In the


mean time we uncovered a press


release from March 2012 that we


believe to be exaggerated at best and


possibly a complete fabrication. In the


way ZERO issues the press release


they make LG Partners sound as though


they are a large enterprise developing a


$2.5 Billion pipeline. We searched


vigorously and found no proof of LG


Partners other than as a DBA for an


individual named Michael Leader in


Atlanta Georgia. The address used on


the purported contract that warranted


such a promotional press release is


none other than Michael Leader's 1,355


square foot home in Atlanta valued by


Zillow at $212,000. There is no way this


company is developing any billion dollar


pipelines anytime soon.


4. On February 23, 1999, STWA issued a press release


announcing the sale of the ZEFS device to Pancorp


Australia Pty. Ltd. ("Pancorp"). STWA reported that it had


"received a 5% cash deposit for the $2.5 million


(Australian dollars) sale." The announcement further


quoted Muller as stating, "[w]e believe that our estimated


revenue projections of 20 cents per share for the first


quarter can now be achieved


If in 1999 the cornerstone of the


promotion was a heavily promoted


contract with an Australian company in


2012 ZERO has changed the script a


little bit by hyping a purported


relationship with a Chinese company.


Here is our problem with this whole


purported relationship:


1. There is not one indication of proof


on the internet that "Beijing Heng He


Xing Ye Technology Consulting" has


ever existed prior to it being


mentioned as a partner by ZERO.


This claim can be independently

verified by any reader by simply


searching Google for the company


and going through EVERY page of


results (as we have done). You will


not find one example of the


company existing outside of


news releases issued by ZERO.


2. The entire Petrochina relationship


appears to be exaggerated with our


belief that ZERO simply paid a


consultant to have their prototype


tested at the Petrochina R&D lab


something that anyone can pay to


do.


3. This is no different from the overly


hyped "tests" that ZERO paid for


through the Pipeline Research


Council. Both the test with the


RMOTC and the one with Temple


University were self funded and self


prepared by ZERO with the results


highly exaggerated as we will


explain in the next section. As the


Pipeline Research Council states on


its OWN website "The majority of


funding for PRCI's research


programs comes from the pipeline


industry through the annual


subscriptions of member


companies. In addition to the


allocation by members of their


subscriptions, members may also


contribute supplemental funding


to programs they determine


worthy of commitment. In this


case a program that can add over


$200 million dollars in value to your

https://seekingalpha.com/article/887041-zeros-current-scheme-is-nearly-identical-to-the-program-that-led-to-an-sec-halt-and-fraud-charges-in-2001 8/


stock is obviously "worthy" of a test.


Especially when you are using your


shareholders money to pay for it.


25. STWA's representations concerning the success of its


ZEFS demonstrations were false and misleading, were


made without reasonable basis in fact, and omitted


material facts necessary to make the statements made


not misleading. In fact, STWA's demonstrations of the


ZEFS device did not prove that the ZEFS device would


actually perform as represented and the press releases


omitted material facts concerning the demonstrations.


For example, the demonstrations were performed on old


cars equipped with carburetors, not on late model cars,


virtually all of which are equipped with fuel injection. The


demonstrations were also "static" tests, performed on


cars in neutral gear without their wheels moving, not on


cars in actual operation on the road. During the Los


Angeles demonstration, discussed in the June 15, 2000


press release, the carbon monoxide reading decreased


only after a mechanic adjusted the car's carburetor.


STWA did not demonstrate that the purported results


were the result of the ZEFS device and not the result of


the carburetor adjustment. During the Los Angeles


demonstration, after connecting the ZEFS device, the


emission of harmful nitric oxide actually increased.


Here the SEC will need to use its


subpoena power to confirm if in fact the


tests were fraudulent. We believe the


tests are clearly misleading for the


following reasons:


1. All "Tests" were self funded by


ZERO


2. The Chinese tests were merely


certifications and not actual


feasibility tests. In reality anybody


with a prototype could pay these


labs to complete these tests on their


products.


3. The RMOTC test was overly hyped


with examples of unnecessary


promotion such as placing stickers


on the oil silos behind the prototype:


4. The entire RMOTC test lasted only


24 hours!


5. During the entire time no variations


of temperature were administered to


the prototype highlighting what is in


our view an unreasonable if not


flawed scientific method underlying


the test.

27. Early in 2000, Muller directed Blackwelder and others


to post numerous messages touting STWA stock on the


Raging Bull Internet message board dedicated to STWA


stock. Muller told Blackwelder and others to use different


aliases and different computers when they posted


messages touting the stock. Muller did this in order to


create the false impression that many people were


talking positively about STWA and its stock.


Once again the SEC will have to use its


subpoena power here to verify whether


the ZERO clan is once again at it on the


message boards. From what we have


observed on the investors hub board


there is definitely some highly


promotional activity orchestrated by a


few posters such as this one that have


post histories comprised only of bullish


ZERO comments.


29. In these posts, Blackwelder did not disclose that


STWA gave him 14,000 shares of STWA stock in


compensation for his promotional services. In some


instances, Blackwelder affirmatively concealed his


identity as the author of the posts.


Looks like ZERO didn't learn from its


past experiences with paying stock touts


shares as compensation. The website


pumpsanddumps.com has disclosed


that ZERO paid a pennystock promoter


nearly 60,000 shares to send out


promotional emails on the company. The


company hired is called: stockguru.com


30. From September 1999 through December 2000,


Muller sold nearly all of his five million restricted shares in


private, unreported transactions. Some of Muller's sales


were to United States citizens. If sold at the then-


prevailing market price, Muller would have realized nearly


$9 million from the sales.


Only 4 days ago! Cecil Kyte, the CEO of


ZERO purchased 500,000 shares of


ZERO currently worth $1.89 a share for


$.25 a share. While retail investors are


paying nearly two bucks, Cecil can sell


into them for a handsome profit!


This exercise has merely confirmed that there are too many similarities between the
current ZERO promotion and the one the SEC sued the company for in 2001. We are
always surprised to see just how dishonest some of these OTCBB scammers are. With
ZERO, we have not been let down as the patterns appear to be nearly identical with the
objective being to liquidate cheap stock at artificial prices.


Different Decade Different Story


Note two screenshots from the ZERO website with one from today and one from 2007. We
remind investors that in 2007 ZERO had the SAME Chairman, Mr. Cecil Bond Kyte:

Screenshot from ZERO's website today. From badmouthing fossil fuels


and promoting the prevention of global warming in 2007, to


badmouthing alternative energies while promoting oil in 2012.


ZERO's "Technology" Is Hardly Proprietary With Past Examples Consisting of
Bankrupt OTCBB Companies


Investors may remember Sulphco Inc. a Texas based OTCBB Company that is currently
bankrupt and trading under the symbol (OTC:SLPHQ). Before it filed for bankruptcy in
2011, Sulphco was a higher flier reaching a valuation of as much as $400 million in 2007.
The demise of the company came when promises to change the physical characteristics
of crude oil by electrifying the crude using a process they called "Sonocracking" eventually
turned out to be a sham. Today shares of Sulphco trade at $.0006 per share.


Conclusion


The bottom line is that investors need to realize that a company with nearly no cash and
assets that total only $200,000 has a ZERO chance of innovating in an energy industry
that sees over $100B expended by the best and brightest scientists and engineers the
world has to offer. The true purpose of this entire production is to sell worthless shares at
artificially inflated prices to unsuspecting investors.


Even the most naïve of retail investors should find it a little unnerving that nearly 10 years
ago this same exact company was sued by the SEC for engaging in nearly an identical
fraud that left investors with nearly $200 million in losses.


We urge investors to stay away from ZERO as we predict that the shares will follow the
path of all five of our recently profiled companies which experienced an average decline of
nearly 60% from the time our report was published. And for those investors that are still
skeptical we urge you to please read the SEC case vs. ZERO in its entirety as we are
certain it will change your minds.

Nice hit piece.....looks like the shorting crews have been busy little beavers......combined with hit pieces like

But JBII survives and is doing very well....With any luck this hit piece on ZERO will FAIL........z

So now that we are moving towards the end of Oct what is the follow up on this very strong pointed article? 
Especially after the opposite view was expressed on Alpha the day after this was released. 
The major contritiction does not feel good. 
repectful update please

It would be nice if the author corrected the absurd assertion that the company is lying about where its R&D
unit is located.


A simple use of Google maps shows they're telling the truth.


I don't know why SA tolerates false assertions like these to go uncorrected.

Author’s reply »  I promise you that is not our intention. In our next piece we will have a section entitled: "How
to Clean Up the OTCBB" with our recommendations for rules and policies that need to be implemented in
order to fix the fatal flaws in the current OTCBB market. We believe in an OTCBB that provides a fair shot to
all retail investors whilst providing innovative, legitimate companies with much needed growth capital. I assure
you that each and every single report we have written was on companies that were engineered to sell
artificially inflated stocks, companies that over time produce nothing but losses for the majority of investors
with the possible exception being a small minority of day-traders that buy into the pump and sell before the

smaller companies. We have had a lot of time to think about this and readers who enjoy investing on the long-
side of the OTCBB will appreciate our analysis in the next piece we publish. We have no qualms about
investor awareness campaigns and promotions as long as they are adequately disclosed but ONLY if the
capital structure of the company has integrity placing ALL investors on an even playing field. Examples of
legitimate companies that fall into this category include: BMPI, VPIG, CMXI, CDXC etc. We are in no way
advocating these companies as a buy because we don't believe ethey are. But they are all legitimate
companies with capital structures that have integrity providing retail investors with an honest shot at
generating a decent return on their invested capital.

ZERO was on the way to uplisting...before this happened....and my guess is she STILL will uplist.......The
technology is Sound.....Temple University doesn't back scams.........z


25 Sep 2012, 02:17 PM


Shane Blackmon, Contributor
the scam is the pumping going on of this stock. I didn't say the technology was a scam, but it's not worth
anywhere near $100M today, or $250M yesterday.


http://bit.ly/QiKQ5e 
you guys aren't even close to uplisting to any major exchange without revenues, cash, or profits. And a share
price back under $1 doesn't give it to you either.

How do you short stocks such as CHMR, NVMN, ZERO, CLSR etc.  
I use Interactive Brokers and in general it is difficult to short any decent type off volumes.

Here's some more DETAILED REBUTTAL to this:


We've all seen the penny stocks that all have the same promise. They are going to change the world, their product will
make your car run on water, cure cancer or solve any one of a million other impossible tasks but this one is different
and here's why:


Let's look at the original players of STWA. The BOD consisted of The Erin Brockavich's law team of Ed Masery (RIP)
and Eugene Eichler CFO of the law firm, with Erin Brockavich as VP of consumer relations and they even pulled
Bobby Unser Jr in. The law firm Masery, Vittero and Eichler split the PG&E settlement of $140M so these people did
not need money. They truly wanted to make a difference by actually changing the world in some manner thank's to
Erin. Here is STWA's history for your review.

Here is a quick preface about how this started. 
History: This company has a complicated history, but in essence it began with a simple emissions-reducing invention
for cars in Australia (based on magnetism), which was brought to U.S. by an Australian charlatan named Mueller who
had bought up the rights to the invention and who created the company in the U.S., hyping the stock (without having a
viable prototype yet), who was later kicked out of the company and the US stock market for securities fraud by the
SEC.


The new management came in (next CEO was environmental attorney Ed Masry of Erin Brockovich fame) who hired
the Rand Corporation to research the invention, Rand Corporation hired renown physicist Dr. Rongjia Tao of Temple
University, a leading expert in the physics of fluids and magnetism, and the company funded the research with a US
Grant.


Dr. Tao and Temple signed an exclusive licensing partnership with Save The World Air under Masry to research, test
and eventually commercialize this brand-new technology. Later, Ed Masry passed away and Bruce McKinnon, the
COO, took the helm until Chuck Blum came in bringing automotive expertise, international reputation and contacts
with him along with Nathan Sheldon from K&N Automotive and S&S Automotive fame..

The new STWA beginning with Masery, Brockavich and Eichler. (12/2001)


A.) Ms. Brockovich has been involved with efforts to rehabilitate a dilapidated park, soccer field and amphitheater in
lower Manhattan as part of an ABC-TV news program entitled “Challenge America with Erin Brockovich.” Mr. Masry,
on the other hand, may have undertaken a far more difficult task at the helm of Save the World Air. On December
19th, The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the Company, its founder, Jeffrey Muller, and a promoter
named Billy Blackwelder with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Save The World Air
stock. The SEC complaint alleges that Muller, Blackwelder and the Company conspired to bilk investors by
distributing false information through press releases, Internet Message Boards (including Raging Bull) and public
corporate filing 
B.)More than a decade ago their legal work on a water contamination case became the basis of the acclaimed film
"Erin Brockovich." Now Ed Masry, a Thousand Oaks city council member and prominent attorney, and Erin
Brockovich, an environmental activist and namesake of the movie, are taking on clean air. 
The two lead a company called Save The World Air, Inc. (STWA), which is developing technology to improve fuel
efficiency and reduce pollution from automobiles, motorcycles, generators, lawn mowers and other internal
combustion engines. According to STWA figures, as much as 75 percent of the world’s air pollution is caused by
internal combustion engines.

I have been trading and forecasting stocks and the market for 22 years. 
Every public company's stock in America is promoted, pumped and painted in the best picture possible. That is how
shareholder bases and branding works in a capital market. State your facts and build a story around it. The longs
have rules they must follow. The shorts do not operate by these same rules nor are they liable for their statements.
Over the long run, truth and facts can win. However, when aggressive negative propaganda designed to insight fear
and confusion is permitted, investors become the victims.

Author’s reply »  And our collective experience in the market exceeds 50 years yet we have only recently
been exposed to the sewer that is the US OTCBB market where by our estimation tens of billions of dollars
are extracted from naive retail investors by unscrupulous scammers EVERY YEAR! Had that capital actually
flowed into the hands of legitimate and innovative entreupenuers we are confident that the american ingenuity
that has led the world in innovation would have produced dozens if not hundreds of annual 10 and 20
baggers that would graduate from the OTCBB to the NASDAQ and even NYSE. Our goal is to simply root out
the pond scum in the hopes that the quality companies will rise to the top and be visible to investors. As we
indicated today our next research report will include a well thought out plan that we believe will eradicate up
to 90% of the fraud on the OTCBB while leaving significant opportunities to profit for speculative investors.
Stay Tuned...

short and hoping to profit.

cha_ching59
Now I'm confused--maybe PabloPicker is Hans Brost--"they" use exactly the same paragraphs--or perhaps
Mr. Brost should credit Mr. Picker as the source for much of his 'rebuttal'? On the other hand Mr. Infitialis has
data galore (and pics, tks.) and a style not unlike V (except for the tulip rather than the V's I suppose). Lame
humor aside, this is no laughing matter. CLSR closed up 75% off yesterday's low of $2.65, PPHM is up
almost 250% off yesterday's premarket low of .70, and Zero is up almost 140% off its .48 low of the day. V
wasn't everybody's hero and Guy Fawkes had a few flaws as well. I like to think that any profits from this
recent spate of (potentially) useful exposes would be used to sincerely improve the OTC and the fact that it so
often rips the retail customer off. For the help in identifying "pond scum" I'm, (potentially) grateful. But the
market is an odd place and I hope Mr.Infitalis doesn't turn out to be "B for bitter" rather than "I for insightful".
Otherwise that'd be "N" for infitalis and selfishly negative. No?

The author of this piece clearly hasn't done very thorough research. I have, and I will not be selling 1 share. What
STWA have in the AOT is something which will make the oil majors much more profitable. If investors cant see this,
it's their loss. Mr Author, lets see what happens in the next six months - I feel you will be eating your words

Since the 2001 debacle, STWA has had extensive changes in CEO, management, and product. The stockguru
"pump" and compensation of 60,000 shares mentioned above happened in 2007, per stockguru's own disclaimer. No
relevant proof was provided that any 3rd party promotion paid by STWA has happened in over 4 years.


The fact that the CEO has recently purchased shares is commonly viewed as a positive. If any CEO sells shares,
doesn't he have to disclose that fact? No such disclosure has yet been filed. The author did not mention what the
stock price was at the time of the CEO's acquisition. ZERO's stock price closed at $.48/share on 8/6/12, around the
time of the disclosure of CEO's purchase at $.25/share.

I'll have an article coming out in Seeking Alpha shortly. The author of this article is misinformed. I am an engineer who
has worked closely with the team at Temple University and seen the technology work many times in the presence of
dozens of engineers with decades of pipeline experience. The company only had access to the facilities at RMOTC
after having passed the scrutiny of many highly skilled pipeline engineers from major pipeline companies and one
major pipeline pump manufacturer. I was on those calls and in those meetings. STWA has real technology and a
great team.

Do you really think STWA is in cohoots with Temple University, the US Government that gave them the $500K grant to
develop the AOT, The Pipeline research Council International which is teh fortunr 50 oil companies, The US

The following statements are taken directly from the CPP/CNPC PetroChina R&D Center Report about the STWA
AOT™ Lab Test: 
"The above test results clearly show that the viscosity reduction technology, AOT, has the ability to significantly reduce
the viscosity of Daqing crude oil, Changqing crude oil, and Venezuela crude oil. Especially, the viscosity reduction for
Daqing crude oil and Changqing crude oil is extremely effective. For Daqing crude oil, the AOT can reduce its
viscosity by more than 80% at 35ºC, and 40ºC. For Changqing crude oil, the AOT can reduce its viscosity by more
than 78% at 26ºC. The tests also show that the viscosity reduction effect lasts more than 24 hours. The technology
reduces the viscosity very fast, in a couple of seconds, and consumes little energy."

AOT™ may be installed for the final Phase III commercial implementation Pilot Program," stated STWA CEO Mr.
Cecil Bond Kyte.


Commercialization announced to be built in USA (Rumor is Detroit)--> http://bit.ly/UulnnA


Going Global 
1.) http://bit.ly/OU75zB


Sound bytes 
a.) STWA's Applied Oil Technology™ (AOT™) is a new technology developed for new pipeline construction and
existing pipeline infrastructure. AOT™ is a standalone crude oil viscosity reduction system, compatible with existing
and new construction for installation at pipeline pump stations to reduce the energy intensity per ton, per mile.
According to the Company's research and the U.S. Department of Transportation, there are 160,868 miles of
petroleum pipelines throughout the United States, with another 11,000+ miles slated for development through 2020
worldwide.


b.) The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) published the latest
AOT™ test results on April 4th, the second day of the conference. These tests showed that AOT™ reduced oil
viscosity by 40.01%, resulting in a 40.04% reduction in pipeline pressure drop per mile. (Now it's 80%)The results
sparked strong interest from industry, leading to one-on-one meetings and presentations with companies and
government dignitaries including Trans-Canada, Enbridge, Voyager Petroleum, Oasis Oil, Acorn Energy, Power
Service Inc., National Oilwell Varco, On Point, Industrial Screen and Maintenance and other suppliers and prospective
customers. During the meetings, STWA discussed in detail the scale and scope of AOT™'s benefits to industry.


c.) STWA Chairman and CEO Mr. Cecil Bond Kyte stated, "The test results released today showed that our
technology could deliver a 40% pressure drop reduction in oil pipelines. This pressure drop reduction could result in
more oil flowing through pipelines. This alone could dramatically impact the industry. The Company has not yet
translated the financial impact of how this 40% reduction could impact the industry. Up to this point we have only
calculated the financial impact of the 13% energy reduction from results last October." He added, "The cost of
transporting $1.35 billion worth of oil per day is significant. AOT™ has been proven to reduce the amount of energy
required to move oil by as much as 13%. This potentially means 13% lower oil transportation costs and a
corresponding decrease of 13% less greenhouse gas emissions every day in the U.S. We are now in the process of
moving towards commercializing of AOT™. Our goal is to advance AOT™ for deployment in the United States and
impact up to 71% of the oil that flows through this country."


d.) STWA has awarded Temple University $500,000 to fund research led by the university's world-renowned physicist,
Dr. Rongjia Tao and his team to pursue additional advancements to the Company's exclusively licensed oil pipeline
technology through collaborative R&D between STWA and Temple University. 
"We have a very productive collaborative arrangement with Dr. Tao and Temple University. The current development
and licensing agreement has led to completion of some of our critical milestones in successfully testing AOT™ with
the United States Department of Energy. We believe we will achieve additional significant technology milestones
during the perpetuity of our agreement," stated STWA Chairman and CEO, Mr. Cecil Bond Kyte. "As we outline our
future R&D goals, we see Dr. Tao and Temple University continuing to work together with us in co-development.
STWA and Temple shall jointly own intellectual property created jointly by the parties. This is a great example of how

When I first heard and saw the article on seekingalpha, I phoned **Andrew Hague early this morning (California
6:30am my time 9:30am) He answered the phone and took the time to discuss this situation. I had several people in
the room with me and I must say congrats Zero you are definitely a class organization.


He addressed every point within the article published by Seeking Alpha, and without exception made a strong case
for continuing with Zero.


This is a viable company with exceptional people. If this were a fraud the phone would have rang with no answer or
worse yet lots of excuses and double talk for each point that our group brought forward, that did not happen. In my
opinion each of us left the conversation convinced that the article and the person who wrought it was nothing more
than a fraud perpetrated for self-enrichment.


Everything I knew about this company is still true. They have the technology, Temple University research, good
management and ability to succeed.


In my opinion the only thing fraudulent here is the Seeking Alpha article that only list specific points to make the stock
go down because that person has shorted the stock.


Amazing amount of half-truths never stands the test of time that's why Zero is going back up!


Long and Strong Zero.

why did they not just start with a new company and name in 2001? 
50 cents to 1.74 and heading down now . legit pump and dump?

Ah! Happy days are here again. It's been a long time since I saw ZERO's name in lights. I was one of the lucky ones
who was short to ZERO the first time around, ten years ago. Bring in on again.

It seems Mr. Haag and Mr. Steele currently both work (or are affiliated) with the same IRTH communications team. 
http://bit.ly/VK8LLo 
Since Mr. Haag is an employee (?) of Zero as the director of Investor Relations, is Mr. Steele a defacto ZERO
employee too? If so, how "independent" are the sources on the SA board?  
Mr. Haag is recently former CFO of the (2012) bankrupt Quintek Technologies (QTEK).  
http://bit.ly/UJYp04 
Mr. Steele also has the dubious distinction of having served as CEO of the same, now defunct, QTEK. 
http://bit.ly/VK8Oah


Although ZERO rallied back above $1 today, this is not a team that inspires my confidence.

Infitalis, you might be interested in looking at REFR. I'm not even sure what to call the company, pump and dump
doesn't really seem enough. I think of pump and dumps as having an exponential pump phase followed by a
vertiginous dump phase. But REFR has spent almost 20 years writing press releases and selling stock. It is still going
as strong today as the day it was conceived.

It takes very minimal effort to see this is not a P&D and not going to be shut down by SEC. For example, look on
Temple University's website. Are you suggesting they are part of something shady? WOW!

What does that have to do with anything? Temple was PAID by zero to put out a paper on the magnetic field
effect. RAND oversaw that, and in its report saw no commercial relevance, or proof it worked, as well as
stating that temples paper was never peer reviewed and the results never duplicated by a second party. This
was in 2007 and RAND was hired by zero. You can find the report on RANDs website. Why did zero not
address RANDs comments? If temple did the initial device, had more or less the same 'testing' and results as
this second go around, then why wasnt the first device commercialized? Why is temples involvement in this
'again' somehow more valud or proof of anything than it was the first time?

I don't know whether STWA is an investing scam or not. I do own some shares that I bought very low, I've taken out
my initial investment and now I a just going to sit on it hoping that some big will come out of the testing going on in
China. 
I do have a question though: If STWA is not a scam and if the china testing turns out positive and if the do end up
signing a major contract with Chineese petroleum company, HOW WILL STWA MAKE MONEY THEN??  
How much does one of these oil reducing viscosity unit cost? what is the company's profit per unit? How many unit
per mile does it require and how many miles of pipeline is the potential contract ? and finally how many units could
they project to sell to China? Projected amount of the contract? Projected profit? over how many years??


Also, where will the units be manufactured? How will it be funded? They only have $59k in cash reserve?


Does any body have the answers to these questions?


Thanks!

I knew Ed Masry personally and was his friend. He believed in the technology and this AOT application has huge
potential to save a lot of energy costs for oil distribution. Once these tests prove the ROI timeframe, the orders should
start coming in along with the beginning wave of profits. Global application for this technology is huge. I have been
long on the stock for years waiting for the best application of the technology. Sooner or later STWA will be a $10
stock.

About the Morgan Hill address, if you look at Google maps, you will see they do indeed occupy #5 on that lot.


The Aamco station is in the front but there is additional space you cannot see from the street.


As to whether they're pump and dumping, I have no idea. A friend of mine owns some of the shares and asked me to
take a look at it.


If I find out more, I'll post again.
