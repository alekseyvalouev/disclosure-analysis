Update:	Supercom's	Q3	Results	Confirm	Key	Points	Of	My	Bear
Thesis
Nov.	4,	2014	10:14	AM	ET39	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


During	their	Q3	earnings	call,	Supercom	management	indicated	that	the	source	of
the	Company’s	recurring	revenue	is	primarily	from	follow-on	contracts.


Follow-on	contracts	should	not	be	considered	annual	recurring	revenue	because	the
timing	and	amount	of	the	follow-on	order	is	not	clearly	defined.


Based	on	YTD	results,	revenue	from	existing	customers	has	continued	to	decline
drastically.	This	indicates	that	follow-on	contracts	tend	to	decline	significantly	in
value	over	time.


Overall,	the	Q3	results	and	management	comments	further	support	my	bear	thesis
on	the	Company.


Supercom	remains	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price.


Supercom	(NASDAQ:SPCB)	released	its	Q3	2014	earnings	report	on	Monday	morning.
This	quarter's	results	and	management's	comments	from	the	earnings	call	strongly
support	the	bear	thesis	from	my	previous	article.	The	Q3	results	were	generally	in-line	with
expectations	with	revenue	of	$9.1mm	slightly	below	consensus	estimates	and	EPS	of
$0.30	above	estimates	by	$0.07	.	Although	there	were	no	big	surprises	in	terms	of
reported	revenue	and	earnings,	SPCB's	Q3	results	provided	some	answers	to	key
questions	that	bulls	and	bears	have	been	debating	about	the	Company's	recurring
revenue	streams.


During	the	Q3	earnings	call,	management	stated	the	following	during	their	opening
remarks:


"After	the	implementation	is	completed,	we	typically	receive	between	20%	to	30%	of
the	contract	value	as	recurrent	revenue	annually.	This	is	additional	to	the	initial	stated
amount.	We	currently	receive	such	recurrent	revenue	from	contracts	previously
implemented	by	both	SuperCom	and	SmartID,	as	reflected	in	our	Q1	and	Q2
revenues."

According	to	the	bolded	portions	of	management's	comments,	the	recurring	revenue	that
SPCB	receives	annually	from	previously	implemented	contracts	is	reflected	in	their	Q1
and	Q2	revenues.	With	this	in	mind,	I	have	provided	below	a	breakout	of	the	Company's
1H	2014	revenue:


As	can	be	seen	in	the	figure	above,	the	vast	majority	of	the	Company's	revenues	from
existing	customers	in	Q1	and	Q2	was	from	follow-on	contracts.	Since	management	stated
that	the	20%	-	30%	recurrent	portion	of	contracts	was	reflected	in	the	Q1	and	Q2	results,	it
can	be	concluded	that	most	of	the	Company's	recurring	revenue	is	actually	from	follow-on
contracts.	Follow-on	contracts	are	not	truly	recurring	revenue	because	follow-on	contracts
tend	to	be	a	year	or	less	in	length.	In	addition	to	this,	the	amount	and	timing	of	follow-on
orders	can	be	unpredictable.	Thus,	SPCB's	actual	amount	of	annual	recurring	revenue	is
much	lower	than	has	been	previously	portrayed	by	some	contributors	on	Seeking	Alpha.	It
can	also	be	concluded	that	recurring	revenue	from	the	$25mm	contract	signed	in	March
and	$22mm	contract	signed	in	August	will	likely	come	from	follow-on	contracts.


The	Company's	reliance	on	follow-on	contracts	would	not	be	a	big	concern	if	the	amount
of	these	follow-on	orders	was	consistent	or	growing	on	a	year-to-year	basis.	This,
however,	is	not	the	case.	I	have	provided	below	a	breakout	of	the	Company's	revenue
between	existing	customers	from	contracts	signed	prior	to	FY	2014	and	new	customers
from	contracts	signed	in	FY	2014.

My	estimate	for	revenue	from	existing	customers	in	FY	2014	is	based	on	the	Company's
YTD	Q3	results.	In	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014,	the	Company	reported	$21.5mm	of
revenue.	I	estimate	that	$11.5mm	of	that	amount	is	from	implementation	work	for	new
contracts	($10mm	of	revenue	from	March	2014	contract,	$1.5mm	of	revenue	from	August
contract).	$11.5mm	of	revenue	from	new	customers	implies	that	$10mm	of	the	Company's
revenue	for	YTD	Q3	2014	is	from	existing	customers.	By	annualizing	$10mm	of	YTD
revenue,	I	estimate	that	SPCB	will	generate	$13.3mm	of	revenue	from	existing	customers
in	FY	2014.	This	represents	a	31%	decline	in	revenue	from	existing	customers	compared
to	FY	2013	and	a	64%	decline	compared	to	FY	2010!	Thus,	it	can	be	concluded	that
revenue	from	existing	customers	(follow-on	contracts)	tends	to	decline	substantially	and
consistently	from	year-to-year.	Given	the	tendency	of	follow-on	revenue	to	decline	over
time	and	the	EID	industry	headwinds	which	I	mentioned	in	my	prior	article,	it	appears	likely
that	revenues	will	decline	by	a	meaningful	amount	from	FY	2014	levels.


In	summary,	SPCB's	Q3	results	provided	confirmation	that	many	investors	were	mistaken
in	their	belief	that	the	Company	generates	a	high	proportion	of	annual	recurring	revenue.
Instead,	the	Company's	receives	most	of	its	revenue	from	existing	customers	via	follow-on
contracts	which	tend	to	decline	significantly	in	value	over	time.	Thus,	the	Company's
financial	performance	is	likely	to	decline	from	FY	2014	levels.	Even	with	the	recent	drop	in
share	price,	I	believe	that	SPCB	is	still	significantly	overvalued,	and	I	recommend	shorting
SPCB	at	the	current	share	price.

JOIN	THE	CONVERSATION


Dane	Capital	Management,	LLC,	Contributor
Jay,	we	respectfully	suggest	that	there	was	nothing	to	support	your	contention	that	SPCB	is	a	good	short	and	we'd
advise	any	interested	party	to	read	the	transcript	http://bit.ly/1twndIr
If	you	believe	that	the	call	supports	your	semantic	debate	about	how	they	count	recurring	revenue	vs.	how	you	look	at
it,	that's	terrific.
However,	there	was	nothing	to	suggest	that	management	isn't	extremely	confident	that	its	opportunity	set	is	as	robust
as	it's	ever	been.
They	were	pretty	clear	that	they	are	more	confident	about	reaching	$100M	in	annual	revenues	than	they	had	been
previously.
There	is	absolutely	no	reason	to	believe	your	call	that	2014	will	be	peak	revenue	-	simply	based	on	already	won
business	2015	will	be	a	significant	growth	year	-	yours	appears	to	be	a	specious	claim.
We	also	find	it	hard	to	believe	that	anyone	would	look	at	this	as	an	asymmetric	risk/reward	opportunity	on	the	short
side.	This	is	a	company	which	literally	could	win	a	$20M	or	$50M	or	$100M	project	award	tomorrow	-	in	which	case
shares	could	go	parabolic,	vs	the	60%	downside	you're	looking	for.	This	isn't	a	pie	in	the	sky	hope	-	they	actually	have
announced	2	$20M+	awards	in	the	last	9	months...and	they	have	many	more	bids	and	greater	resources	in	the	market
today	than	12-18	months	ago	when	they	where	submitting	those	bids.


Good	luck	with	your	short,	we'll	stick	with	our	long	http://bit.ly/1rGqQaT

Author’s	reply	» 	Revenue	from	existing	customers	is	$13mm.	If	you	assume	they	receive	$10mm	a	year	from
follow-on	contracts	from	their	2	new	customers,	then	you	are	left	with	a	base	of	$23mm	of	revenue	(this	base
of	revenue	will	also	likely	decline	given	past	trends).	$100mm	in	revenue	certainly	seems	like	a	pie	in	the	sky
hope	given	the	fact	that	there	are	only	17	governments	converting	to	EID	over	the	next	4	years.	15	are
projected	to	convert	in	2014	alone,	which	indicates	that	this	year's	contract	wins	are	from	an	unusually	strong
markets	-	there	were	more	bids	available	and	bids	were	less	competitive.	The	RFID	business	is	a	crapshoot
given	that	it	generates	only	$300K	of	revenue	a	year	and	has	been	around	for	several	years.	You	can	talk	all
you	want	about	submitting	multiple	bids,	but	the	fact	is	that	the	Smart	ID	business	has	been	around	for	a	long
time.	I	am	sure	that	OTIV	also	submitted	multiple	bids	via	the	Smart	ID	business.	In	fact,	OTIV	invested	a	lot
of	$	in	sales	and	marketing,	so	it's	not	like	Smart	ID	was	an	underinvested	asset.	There	is	nothing	to	indicate
that	SPCB	management	has	fundamentally	changed	that	business.	Have	they	improved	the	technology?
Have	they	made	a	more	robust	service	offering?	I	don't	think	so.	I	feel	comfortable	with	my	conclusion.
