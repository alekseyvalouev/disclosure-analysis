Watch For A Potential 50% Drop In Omeros

Summary


Omeros recently spiked on release of new Phase II drug data for OMS-721.


The stock quickly gave up almost all of these gains once the details of this trial were
better understood.


Omeros had previously been hitting a new 52-week low of $11.93 due to the failed
launch of its only commercial product, Omidria. But shares appeared to be headed
lower.


Omidria continues to fail and the share price should retrace to well below $11.00.
Ultimately, the stock should settle around $6-8.


Omeros desperately needs to raise money in the near term via an equity offering
any day now. This is the near-term catalyst for a sharp decline.

Shorting stocks into a failed drug launch is about the closest thing there is to printing free
money. Sell side analysts routinely put unrealistic sales estimates on new drugs even
when there are obvious signs that the market will not accept the drug commercially. The
sell side targets result in vastly overpriced stocks which inevitably correct as the poor
launch results become visible over time. When companies are forced to raise cash on the
back of a failed drug launch, the correction is even further accelerated.


Back in May, I highlighted a short opportunity with Keryx Biopharmaceuticals
(NASDAQ:KERX). Keryx was trading at around $10 with a market cap of around $1 billion,
despite generating sales for its only drug of less than $1 million. Even these paltry sales
were only achievable when Keryx used overly aggressive marketing tactics, conveying an
iron benefit for which its Auryxia drug was not approved. The sell side had told us to
expect sales of over $20 million for the year, but by May it was clear that this was pure
fantasy. Even with the stock trading at a 52-week low of around $10, the stock was a
compelling short. Keryx now trades for around $6, down by nearly 40% in just 3 months.
Previously, the stock had traded at over $18 due to pre-launch hype for Auryxia thanks to
sell side analysts.

Another example is the failed launch of Afrezza by MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD).
MannKind is backed by billionaire Alfred Mann, which generated ample enthusiasm for the
prospects of this inhaled insulin drug. Even as the failure of the launch became evident,
the stock still traded as high as $7.00 as recently as June. The stock now trades for just
$3.50, down 50% in 3 months.


As with Keryx and MannKind, we are about to see a similar phenomenon with Omeros
Corp. But with Omeros, the situation is exacerbated by the company's need to raise cash
in the near term.


Shares of Omeros now represent a compelling short opportunity for a variety of reasons.
There is also a catalyst for a near-term decline. The first issue is that the launch of its only
commercial product has been an abject failure. Further revenues will not materialize in
any amount remotely near to what the sell side had told us to expect. The notion of getting
to $100 million is pure nonsense.


The shares recently spiked due to the release of Phase II data on a separate drug, but
now they are quickly giving up all of these gains, as investors understand the tiny scope of
this preliminary trial and the lack of trial design.


However, the shares currently remain elevated versus where they were prior to this data
release, creating the compelling short opportunity. Much of the reason that Omeros
currently trades above $6-8 is that the market believes that Omeros has an additional
broad pipeline of potential drugs. It is the "multiple shots on goal" theory.


But this is mistaken. Three of these drugs have either been discontinued or are on clinical
hold by the FDA. There is no value to them. The only Phase III candidate has already
been licensed out and offloaded for a minimal sum. Again, there is no further value there
either. And with OMS-721, we can see that the stock is already giving up all of its gains
due to the weak trial design and small trial size.


Prior to the release of the recent Phase II data, Omeros was hitting new lows of
$11.93. If it were not for the data driven spike, the stock appeared to have been
headed steadily lower. Omeros does not currently have enough cash to even fund
its trials and must raise capital in the very near term. As a result, the company
needs to issue stock, which will ultimately see the stock trading at around $6-8.

Omeros Corp. has a fully diluted market cap of $734 million, despite the fact that it has
only a single commercial product (Omidria) which is now suffering through a failed launch.
Omidria is basically just an NSAID (Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) which controls
pain and inflammation during cataract or lens surgeries. It also controls pupil dilation.


As of Q2, the company had just $51 million in cash vs. a 6-month cash burn of $34 million.
By now we can estimate that cash is down to $30-40 million. Yet cash burn now needs to
accelerate due to ongoing clinical trials. As a result, the company simply must issue equity
in the near term.


Based on the failed drug launch and the stock offering catalyst, we can expect the
stock to fall by 40-50% from current levels.


The failure of Omidria to achieve meaningful sales should have come as no surprise to
investors. The product is simply a combination of two existing generic drugs which can
be easily compounded by any compounding pharmacy for about 1/10th the cost of what
Omeros is attempting to charge.


Despite this obvious competitive problem, the sell side had very aggressive sales
estimates following the company's Omidria launch earlier this year. This is identical to
what we saw with Keryx and MannKind.


The sell side estimated that Omidria sales for 2015 would come in at over $20 million,
while sales in 2016 would exceed $100 million. Omidria was launched earlier this year
with sales so far of around just $3 million. However, according to the recent 10-Q, these
sales include at least 1 month's worth of inventory stocking by wholesalers as opposed to
end demand to be used in procedures. As a result, true sales should be estimated in the
range of $1-2 million so far.


Omeros has no other viable pipeline


Management has continued to tout its pipeline outside of Omidria. This has helped to
support the stock at prices over $10 for some time. However, the fact is that what it is
touting does not really exist.


Looking at its investor presentation, Omeros does seem to have a lot of other drugs in the
pipeline. However, much of this can be seen as very misleading. The chart below shows
Omeros' pipeline as per its presentation to investors. The red lines and text were added by
me to illustrate where this pipeline is bogus.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3478056-watch-potential-50-percent-drop-omeros 5/18


The bulk of the programs that are listed by Omeros are simply pre-clinical. There have
been no trials initiated and there should only be minimal (if any) value attributed to them.
Some of these programs have been ongoing for as long as 7 years without even making it
into clinical trials. Yet management still continues to tout them as part of its "pipeline".


But here is the real problem. There is only one Phase III candidate listed in Omeros'
pipeline. This is for OMS-103 to be used for arthroscopy indications. That drug already
failed to reach statistical significance in its primary endpoint in clinical trials. In June of
2015, Omeros basically offloaded the drug to Faragon NV for up to $10 million in
milestone payments, should they ever occur. It is basically worthless.


Within the several Phase II programs, we can see from the recent 10-K (but not in the
presentation to investors) that three of these programs have either been cancelled or
placed on clinical hold.


OMS-824 for CNS disorders (two listings below) was placed on clinical hold by the FDA in
October of 2014.


OMS-201 for urology uses is no longer in active clinical trials. These three items are, for
all intents and purposes, dead. There is no value to them.

OMS-405 is for opioid and nicotine addiction. However, this is still in the recruiting stage
for a Phase II trial and should not provide any value or catalyst for the stock in the near
future.


That leaves us with OMS-721 which was what caused the stock to spike when the data
was recently released. So let's take a look at why the gains didn't hold following the
release of data.


Looking at the data for OMS-721


On August 14th, Omeros was hitting new lows of $11.93. The next day, Omeros released
data on the mid-dose cohort for its OMS-721 and the stock quickly spiked to as high as
$30.00. But now the stock has given up nearly all of those gains, trading at just $15.00.
What happened?


OMS-721 is being studied for the treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs).
TMAs are a family of rare, debilitating and life-threatening disorders characterized by
excessive thrombi (clots) - aggregations of platelets - in the microcirculation of the body's
organs, most commonly the kidney and brain.


The data was indeed positive, and the fact that Omeros has obtained Orphan Drug Status
for OMS-721 is what led the stock to spike so high. Clearly, some might have thought this
could represent another distinct revenue stream for Omeros and the Orphan status could
make that meaningful.


Or perhaps not.


The reason why the stock is now plunging is that the market has become aware that the
trial applied to just 5 patients and there was not even a placebo arm. More importantly, it
does not appear that the drug would be competitive with the existing drug Soliris by
Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN).


From the data release,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3478056-watch-potential-50-percent-drop-omeros 7/18


In the mid-dose cohort, the two patients with plasma therapy-resistant aHUS
demonstrated:


• 47% increase in mean platelet count, resulting in both patients having counts in the
normal range


• 86% decrease in mean schistocyte count, with schistocytes disappearing in one
patient


• 71% increase in mean haptoglobin with both patients reaching the normal range
during treatment, one slipping slightly below normal at one week following the last
dose


• 5% decrease in the mean levels of LDH, with levels in both patients remaining
slightly elevated above normal range


The key concern from the above data is the fact that there was only a 5% decrease in the
mean levels of LDH, with levels remaining elevated. Soliris has shown normalization of
LDH levels in up to 80% of patients.


It was also noted that with the mid-dose patient with TTP, "Laboratory parameters did not
show consistent improvement". That was for one out of the five patients.


The first conclusion is that all in all there should have been nothing to get too
excited about with the release of data from OMS-721. There should have been very
little movement in the stock in the first place. This is why the stock is now giving up
all of its gains.


KEY POINT: But the key takeaway here is that over the course of 7 years, and after
spending nearly $300 million, Omeros has produced just a single approved drug...
which happens to be nothing more than the combination of two existing generic
drugs.


Looking at the failed launch of Omidria


Looking at the overall pipeline for Omeros, including the new data from OMS-721, it is
clear that the overwhelming majority of the value of the company should be based simply
on Omidria. Omidria is Omeros' only FDA approved product and the only one which has
been commercially launched.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3478056-watch-potential-50-percent-drop-omeros 8/18


Sell side analysts have put forth projections for Omidria sales which are as high as $100
million in 2016. This is what kept the share price elevated prior to launch at levels of $20-
25.


Once we were able to get past the initial launch and see how sales actually materialized,
the share price was quickly cut in half. Just a few weeks ago (prior to the recent spike),
the stock was hitting new lows daily, as low as $11.93.


Omidria is simply a combination of phenylephrine and ketorolac which is injected into the
eye during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement. The combo treatment helps to
maintain pupil size, while reducing pain and inflammation.


The key thing to realize here is that both phenylephrine and ketorolac are existing generic
drugs. Omidria is simply a formulation which combines the two and which was
subsequently FDA approved.


Omidria did obtain Medicare pass through status for reimbursement at around $400 per
vial. However, this is about 10x what it would cost a compounding pharmacy to simply mix
the two medications on its own. Most ophthalmologists have ample access to
compounding pharmacies.


As a result, the only real reason to use Omidria is that it is more convenient and saves the
step of having the compounding pharmacy mix the drug. It is clear from the results post
launch that this has not been enough of an incentive to generate meaningful revenues. It
is also clear from the failed launch that this combination of two readily available generics
will never be a $100 million drug. Not by a long shot. At best, we will continue to see a few
million in sales from Omidria.


Similar to what we saw during the failed launches for Keryx and MannKind, the share
price for Omeros is steadily grinding lower, rather than suddenly plunging. But unlike
Keryx and MannKind, Omeros is in urgent need of raising money. With a minimal viable
pipeline, there is very little to incentivize investors, such that the impact on the stock will
be larger than usual.


The catalyst for a share price drop will be a near-term equity offering at a
meaningful discount. Such an offering could be expected to happen any day now.

Over the past 7 years, Omeros has spent nearly $300 million on a variety of endeavors
and the only thing it has to show for it is a single approved drug, Omidria, which happens
to be nothing more than a combination of two existing generic drugs.


Aside from its already-launched Omidria, Omeros does not have a viable pipeline. The
bulk of its programs are simply pre-clinical and not even in FDA trials. Of the ones which
have reached clinical stage, 3 have either been placed on clinical hold or have been
discontinued. One has already been offloaded to another company for a mere $10 million
of potential milestones, should they ever occur. That leaves us with OMS-721, where the
recently announced trial had just 5 patients and no placebo arm with fairly mediocre
results. There should be little, if any, value attributed to OMS-721 until there is a larger
Phase III trial in 2016 or 2017.


That leaves Omeros with just a single commercial product, Omidria. Omidria is FDA
approved and has already been launched. But because it is simply the combination of two
readily available generics, it has not generated meaningful sales post launch.


Omeros had just $51 million in cash as of June. Yet the company burned $34 million in the
6 months ended June. By now it is likely down to $30-40 million in cash. Unusual for a
biotech, the company has $30 million in debt.


Against this, the company must fund a 40-person sales force as well as its ongoing clinical
trials for OMS-721. It is quite clear that the company doesn't have the cash to do this
without raising equity financing in the very near term, which will add significant pressure to
the share price.


With the share price spike now fading quickly, I expect that the company will issue shares
very soon and that the share price will quickly head back to $11 or below. Given the failed
status of Omidria, the share price will likely find a floor at around $6-8.


This is based on the assumption that Omeros raises $80 million at $12, issuing 6.7 million
new shares, bringing fully diluted share count to 54.07 million. It also assumes that sales
for 2015 and 2016 stabilize in the range of $10-15 million, rather than $20-100 million as
per sell side estimates.


Note that Omeros excludes from its share count the 9.5 million options and warrants. (See
page 8 of the recent 10-Q).

Wow what a totally biased article. At least you divulge that youre short (obviously). Omer went up as highas 100%
due to its being a low float day traded stock before settling at about $23 (still up about 50%) by the end of the day. It
sold off from there along with everything else under the sun due to the market correction, NOT due to "people
realizing there was no control arm etc. blather). You act like Omer is some kind of a one trick pony that has no other
drugs in development, no other catalysts pending nor any recent approvals on market. Nothing could be further from
the truth and it only takes a little DD to realize that at its current market cap Omeros is extremely undervalued.

The FDA will inforce this and you also forgot there are triple damages in using and and non FDA approved drug when
infact there is a FDA APPROVED drug. The lawyers are going to love this.

Funny how you left the part out about the top 30 US insurance carriers have signed up for Omidria. Funny how you
left out the European aspect of this story which has 5M LRS procedures per year and European approval. Funny how
you claim a failed launch because of $3M in revenue when you have to know that the revenue amount was fully
explained in the conference call. You know the part where the timeline for ordering Omidria was a 10-12 week
process from initial contact to ordering. Funny how you left out that opthamologists have been very receptive to
effectiveness of the drug and do not characterize it as the same as compounding two generic drugs. I am not an
expert but when someone writes an article and fails to leave out key aspects of the storyline I think they are not be to
be trusted. You seem to fall into that category.

All I have to say is if I was short, this would be an excellent time to come out with a short hit. The jury is still out on
Omidria. Too early to make a call either way. If the FDA ever starts to enforce compounding rules, no larger
beneficiary than Omidria. Bottom line? Below $14 ain't the level to be a seller, long or short.

@pbvflorida, I read your comment and thought it was well thought out. I was more curious if @romantic12u
had any specific criticisms.

I am all for hearing the other side of an investment but this is a very transparent article, omidria is far from a failed
launch and the author is using fear to garner a result... So far, bravo it's working! However this company has MANY
catalysts still just this year and the Ahus trial result was in fact a huge success, omidria may be a simple formula but
that does not mean it will not be a huge success, in fact it's simplicity and FDA approval (cover for doctors) make it
much more likely to succeed. This company has been encircled by shorts performing a bear raid... Just don't be the
last to cover when all else do.

You pass over the FDA approval Medicare reimbursement like it is meaningless. As one poster pointed out, there is
pressure from the FDA to discontinue the use of compounded products and when it comes to the economics facing
the doctors, why would they spend $40 out of pocket (they don't get reimbursed for a compounded drug) when they
get fully reimbursed plus an administrative charge (I think it is 6% of cost) when using Omidria. So, the doctors make
money by using Omidria vs a compounded drug and using a compounded drug opens them up to all kinds of legal
issues if it proves to be inferior or harms the patient. Doesn't seem like much of a choice?

From a five-star ranked analyst at Wedbush earlier in August...


In a research report released today, Wedbush analyst Liana Moussatos reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of
Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER) and raised the price target to $70 (from $61), after the company announced
additional positive data in the company’s Phase 2 clinical trial of OMS721 for the treatment of thrombotic
microangiopathies.


Moussatos wrote, “With significant normalization of platelet counts and other TMA parameters in aHUS patients, we
believe OMS721 has achieved clinical proof-of-concept for efficacy. We believe OMS721 with its more convenient

subcutaneous dosing and potentially safer profile could be a threat to $2+ billion per year Soliris.”


The analyst continued, “We have updated our model to include revenues and our valuation for OMS721 in aHUS. We
project potential launch in mid:18 and conservatively project gross peak annual sales could reach over $900 million.
We also consider Omeros to be a future take-out target.”


Overall, “We anticipate Omeros to complete the high-dose cohort in the Phase 2 trial testing OMS721 in TMAs and
meet with the FDA to design a pivotal trial which we anticipate could begin in 2016. We see the potential for non-
dilutive cash from potential partnership(s) for the sale of Omidria in Europe in the coming months. We also anticipate
the potential restart of the Phase 2 trial for OMS824 in Huntington’s disease by year-end.”

Still way early to call Omidria a failure. With the encouraging data from OMS721 and the current market cap, OMER
looks very attractive to me. Keep shorting so I can buy more at a lower price.

I don't understand investors playing the "Lemming" on this article. You know this guy Mr. Pearson, he did it with
$ADXS as well and now do it with $OMER. This author is SHORT and wants to see you sell in panic. This article and
the author is ridiculous ! Trust your own investments and not that guy here. It's a shame and def a case for the SEC!!!

sells what isn't his'n, buys it back or goes to prison".


I'd have to think tonight's closing print suggests the bottom for OMER near term. 
3.7M, 7M plus on day. You know they say nobody rings a bell at tops and bottoms? RING RING RING

Interesting patent news today. I've not seen it widely disseminated. Program likely wouldn't start ahead of '17, but
appears to be a legit opportunity.

The OMS-103 Press Release from OMER mentions the same milestone payments but as one part only of a deal
involving two parts:


(1) "In exchange for the U.S. license, Fagron will pay Omeros a substantial majority share of the gross revenues
generated from sales of OMS103 with Omeros also receiving a minimum revenue per vial sold." 
(2) "In addition," (that's IN ADDITION) "Fagron will pay Omeros up to an aggregate total of $10 million in commercial
milestones, some of which will be received by Omeros as revenue-share enhancement on early sales."

While I recently sold OMER after reaching my target return, there are a couple points of inaccuracy and/or
misunderstanding in the article.


First, while it's true that Omidria is compounded from existing generics, that compounding is novel for the usage
prescribed and is patented. There is no danger of unfettered competition. I'd say that it's too soon to call the product
launch a "failure" given the recency of approvals for reimbursement.


Second, the method of administration is both an initial injection and infusion during surgical irrigation. This removes
the time pressure on surgeons during the procedure. However long the sales uptake might take (admittedly unknown)
it is very likely to become standard of care for the label procedures.


I have no opinion on the pipeline. My original thesis was to own OMER for a 100% gain on a buy-out. I received that
without the M&A. I may yet go long again.

I hope at this level you are going long again because the real value of the company is in their oGPC receptor
program and the IP of their assay. That part of the company is worth 10B by itself.

Skwirrlmaster please provide details that support that comment.


06 Sep 2015, 01:27 PM


skwirrlmaster
that it is worth 10B by itself? It is the value I place on the IP based on the fact that 30-40% of the world's
700B+ per year drug market targets all of 46 GPCRs. There are another 82 targets underway outside of
oGPCRs and another 116 traditional GPCRs that are currently not drug targets. Lets say 30% of 700B. That's
currently 210B dollars a year worth of drugs on 244 traditional GPCReceptors. Slightly over 50% (128) of
those targets are currently viable and of that 50ish% only 36% is bringing in all that bacon. That brings the
value of each viable and currently drug developed non-orphan GPCR from a MINIMUM average of 4.565B
dollars a piece, up to 6.086B dollars each.


Now the advantages of traditional GPCRs are we already understand how to affect them, they are easily
accessible by drugs, they affect a wide range of disease indications and they are traditionally low on side
effects.


Here's where this affects Omeros. There are 119 ORPHAN GPCRs which until recently had no known ligands
by which to manipulate them. Since the start of Omeros' proprietary oGPCR program they have unlocked and
affected 54 of these orphan G-protein coupled receptors. Their method of doing so via their high-throughput
assay is patent protected IP. The rest of the world combined has unlocked 8. Current technology for the rest
of the world has limited them only to agonist screening.


Now lets use the same %s from before with 52.45% of non-orphan GPCRs as recognized drug targets. There
are 119 oGPCRs, by both my and Omeros estimates, that brings us to 60+ (62.4) viable drug candidates that
we already understand how to exploit for drug discovery. This is not like cancer research where we are
guessing what will make the biggest difference. We already have a very good idea what to do with these. Just
accessing them was the big challenge. That mountain has been summitted.


Many of these oGPCRs are involved in vastly profitable fields of medical research. Everything from myelin
disorders like MS, to obesity, to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers... to 14 different types of
cancers including their stem cells, to anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's, pain,
inflammation, auto-immune and arthritis, to wound healing and damn hair follicle stem cells. These are all
accessible to Omeros and nobody else at this point in time.


Now lets conservatively take 1/4th of that 200-280B (240 as an average). 60 Billion. 60 Billion spread across
60 oGPCRs that are likely drug candidates. 60 Billion worth of drug candidates that Omeros is years ahead of
the rest of the world on (and patent protected in the method of getting there). It's very likely that Omeros will
never turn out a successful drug for 80% of these. For the sake of argument lets even say 90%. But even with
that low success rate (which I believe will be closer to 80) that's still 6B a year worth of revenue that their
oGPCR program will turn out. I personally believe they could even exceed that 80% success number due to

the awesome science they have been producing in their other programs and could have some enormous hits
that bring this closer to a $15-20B a year peak earnings boon. But lets just stick with 6B a year or so.


Now paying a 60% premium on the 1 year peak value of the program? Brings us right out to about 10B
dollars.

They appear to get the a chunk of money for any GPCR rev's, tied to a previous financing. I've tried hard to learn
more about the portfolio and the opportunities, it's been difficult. I've got my arms around the bulk of the business, but
frankly have zero value for it. I don't understand why they haven't developed those opportunities more quickly. Im
even more interested after the success TRVN has had using GPCR to develop TRV-130.
