Provectus: More Concerns, Reiterate 'Strong Sell' On BTD Failure
May 27, 2014 9:10 AM ET12 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


PVCT has definitively been denied its Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)
application by the FDA.


According to the May 23 call, PVCT received notice of BTD failure on Wednesday,
May 21, the same day it stated in a PR, “The FDA has not reported back to the
Company."


Was PVCT selling stock to the public last week, while shareholders did not possess
this critical BTD information that was with the company?


Why was PVCT stock halted all day Friday, May 23, when the 8K was out by 2:18
pm?


FDA letter highlights prior concerns in 4 separate communications going back to
April 2010, along with other issues.


I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating on shares of Provectus (OTC:PVCT), as I still
believe this stock has $0 intrinsic value and the fundamentals appear to be deteriorating.


My opinion is that shares of PVCT, when unhalted, could gap down substantially, before
ultimately dribbling down to my long-term price target of $0, just like PVCT management's
last company, Imcor Pharma.


1. PVCT has definitively been denied its Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)
application by the FDA.


2. According to the May 23 call, PVCT received notice of BTD Failure on Wednesday,
May 21, the same day it stated in a PR, "The FDA has not reported back to the

3. Why was PVCT stock halted all day Friday, May 23, when the BTD failure 8K was out
by 2:18 pm?


4. The FDA letter highlights prior concerns in 4 separate communications going back to
April 2010.


5. PVCT shareholders looking forward to an ASCO "catalyst" could be disappointed, as I
believe that is a "non-event", and I explain why below.

The Suspicious Timeline of Provectus' BTD Failure Announcement and Stock Halt


On Wednesday, May 21st, I released a report detailing how, based on changes PVCT
made to its website on May 20th at what appeared to be the 60-day BTD deadline, I
believed it was likely Provectus had already received a negative BTD decision. Later that
day, 5/21/14, Provectus issued a press release where it said:


The article alleges that the Company's oncology drug PV-10 "appears to have failed
their Breakthrough Therapy Designation." This statement is completely false. The
FDA has not reported back to the Company with respect to the Company's
application for Breakthrough Therapy Designation.


We now know that actual FDA correspondence about Provectus' BTD failure was dated
Friday, May 16th - apparently five days before I issued my first report. In my opinion, it is
troubling how Provectus has attempted to spin this.


On its May 23rd conference call, Provectus claims to have received the FDA response on
Wednesday 5/21, the same day its press release stated "The FDA has not reported
back to the Company," but appears to have withheld this information from shareholders
until it formally announced the BTD failure on 5/23. On the call, management states they
were out of the office and did not receive the FedEx from the FDA, as they were ringing
the NYSE opening bell on the 5/22.

Why was PVCT Stock Halted ALL DAY on Friday 5/23 Before a Long Weekend?


Once management released the BTD failure news, why was the stock halted? Before the
stock market opened but after the BTD failure was announced, PVCT stock was halted
the entire day of Friday before the 3-day long Memorial Day weekend. I find this very
confusing. With this extremely bad news now public, why was it necessary for PVCT stock
to be halted ALL DAY, when its 8-K with the full disclosure had been filed by 2:18 pm
EST?


FDA Letter Discloses Additional Concerns


The FDA letter is a "must-read" for any PVCT shareholder, and I believe some of the other
issues mentioned in the FDA BTD failure letter are even more concerning than the BTD
failure.


I believe the most important part of the FDA letter that all PVCT shareholders need to
focus on is this quote below direct from PVCT's BTD failure letter (emphasis mine):


preliminary clinical data do not demonstrate substantial improvement over existing
therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. This determination is based
on the paucity of data on endpoints indicative of clinical benefit"


This is a direct statement from the FDA about PV-10, based on the clinical data they've
been shown that is about as clear as I can imagine.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238783-provectus-more-concerns-reiterate-strong-sell-on-btd-failure 4/13


Furthermore, in my first report, I provided source material supporting my estimate that the
BTD response in recent years was in excess of 90% negative (refusal) by the FDA.


We also know, quoted directly from the FDA's BTD failure letter to PVCT below (emphasis
mine), that:


FDA previously communicated concerns regarding the development program and
provided advice regarding the type of data that should be systematically collected to
investigate the clinical benefit(s) of an intratumoral treatment of a subset of individual
lesions in a systemic disease (malignant melanoma), as previously discussed at
the April 8, 2010, March 7, 2011, and October 18, 2011, end-of-Phase 2
meetings and the December 16, 2013 General Guidance teleconference.


Provectus management knew well in advance - in fact 4 years ago, on April 8th, 2010 -
that the FDA had significant concerns about the data regarding PV-10 drug.


What has PVCT Been Doing Clinically the Last 3+ Years?


Remember, PVCT was a tiny penny stock trading for $0.60 per share recently. It would
have been difficult to fund Provectus' substantial cash burn with a share price of $0.54 at
the end of 2013, and may have been difficult to obtain the necessary shareholder votes to
change the company's Certificate of Incorporation. On January 15th, PVCT released a
press release hyping a Type C meeting with the FDA in December. Why now, after 4
years, with no additional clinical support?


And why did several paid research reports follow after this announcement?


The initial Small Cap Street paid research report was issued on January 21st, 2014 - just
days after the Type C meeting. Provectus still has not answered questions raised in my
initial report about why this report was issued and how it was paid for. We know the Small
Cap Street report was paid for by Hunter Marketing, but who paid Hunter Marketing? Was
it Provectus?


Path Forward? PVCT needs an expensive Phase III Trial just to apply for approval,
but has just $19mm of cash left, while already burning ~$1m per month.


As I discussed in my initial report, Provectus has survived by repeatedly executing highly
dilutive capital raises with some of Wall Street's shadiest investment banks. According to
CapIQ data, PVCT has executed no less than 19 dilutive financings, while producing
lifetime revenue of zero and losses since inception of $153 million. During this time period,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238783-provectus-more-concerns-reiterate-strong-sell-on-btd-failure 5/13


management has personally earned stated compensation of ~$49 million. More shocking
still, $24 million of this stated compensation was been paid to executives between 2011-
2013, according to PVCT proxy statements. This is the same time period in which
Provectus management apparently disregarded trial advice from the FDA that could have
positively impacted the BTD decision.


The company has $16.6m of cash on hand as of its latest 10-Q balance sheet, which
apparently increased to ~$19m in the mean time, despite the cash burn (per the update
call). Given I estimate PVCT will need to maintain $4-5m in cash, this $19m is enough to
cover a little over one year of operations, considering the company's trailing 4-year
average free cash flow burn of $13m per year.


Including fully diluted warrants, the company's share count today is ~245 million shares.
The Provectus Certificate of Incorporation allows a maximum share count of 250 million
shares. Provectus is currently attempting to raise this limit to 300 million shares at the
company's June 16, 2014 annual meeting. What will the company do to raise capital if it is
unable to increase its maximum share count?


ASCO Event a PVCT "Non-Event" In My View


Some PVCT shareholders seem to believe the upcoming ASCO conference is an
important "catalyst" for PVCT stock, based on PVCT's "presentation" there. I want
investors to be clear that, as far as I can tell, the hyped PVCT "ASCO Presentation" listed
here is identified as a "Poster Highlight Session". This is not a Keynote speech presenting
some groundbreaking information. In fact, when checking the implications of this on the
ASCO website here, the "Poster Highlight Session" description is explained down near the
bottom as:


"Poster Highlights Sessions feature selected abstracts of clinical research in poster
format. The posters are grouped by topic and are on display for a specified time"


Is PVCT simply putting PV-10 information on a cardboard poster somewhere at the
conference? It seems so to me, and if this is true, for a drug with no large pharma partner,
which the FDA has stated has a "paucity of data" and "clinical data do not demonstrate
substantial improvement over existing therapies", with Phase II trials done years ago and
with no Phase III trials, I do not see how a poster at a huge conference for a drug whose
trial happened years ago will have any material impact or could be considered any sort of
catalyst. I believe ASCO is a "non-event" for PVCT.

Was PVCT Selling Shares to Investors Last Week?


On April 30th, 2014, Provectus entered into a controlled equity offering with Cantor
Fitzgerald, with a total maximum offering value of $50m. Those unfamiliar with this type of
offering can learn more here - the gist is that through Cantor, PVCT can sell shares
directly into the market and book the proceeds as PVCT cash. This differs from a
traditional equity offering, where all of the shares are placed at once in a structure
transaction. In other words, if you buy a share of PVCT, there is a chance that you might
be buying it directly from the company.


With that in mind, I find it very interesting that PVCT management appear to have said on
the call they now have ~$19m in cash. Given PVCT has zero revenue, where did this
additional cash come from? Was management selling stock to public investors in the open
market via the Cantor Fitzgerald equity tool prior to them releasing the BTD failure news? I
believe management needs to clarify this issue immediately.


Management Response


I tried contacting management since the update call, and have been unable to get in touch
with them yet. I look forward to them publicly clarifying the issues at hand for investors.


Disclosure: I am short PVCT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

"NYSE MKT Reviewing the Continued Listing of the Common Stock of Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.


NEW YORK, May 27, 2014 - The NYSE MKT LLC ("NYSE MKT") announced today that the staff of NYSE Regulation,
Inc. ("NYSE Regulation") will continue to review and monitor the listing status of the Common Stock (the “Common
Stock”) of Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") - ticker symbol PVCT - on the NYSE MKT.


NYSE Regulation had previously initiated a trading halt in the Company’s Common Stock prior to the opening on
Friday, May 23, 2014, in advance of the Company’s announcement that it had received notification from the United
States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) that the FDA has declined to designate PV-10 as a Breakthrough
Therapy at this time.


NYSE Regulation has now completed its assessment of the May 23, 2014 disclosures in the context of the NYSE
MKT Company Guide (the “Company Guide”) and will begin the procedure to resume trading in the Company’s
Common Stock. NYSE Regulation will carefully consider the price indications obtained in the opening process and will
assess whether to move to continue to halt or suspend trading in the Company’s securities should the: (1) price
indications or subsequent trading reflect a price that the NYSE MKT deems to be “abnormally low”; (2) NYSE MKT
receive authoritative advice that the security is without value; or (3) Company fall below the quantitative continued
listing standards listed in the NYSE MKT Company Guide. NYSE Regulation will continue to closely monitor events at
the Company and the appropriateness of continued listing of the Company’s securities."

think they are questioning the phase II results although some think they are over hyped because of the sample size.
The FDA has its' reasons obviously we cannot understand their thought process or motives for denial but
transparancey from the company was not good at all. PVCT was foolish not to do a bigger pahse III study that was
requested by the FDA. This could all be a conspiracy or could be something else I do not know. Maybe they didn't
have the money and were hoping it would get approval sooner. That was a bad gamble in hindsight.

MoMoInvestor
How did they deliberately mislead ?


27 May 2014, 11:13 AM


MichaelJ8
they weren't foolish to run into a phase III study right off the bat. They met with FDA on many occasions over
the past 4 years, and each time they had a design it was shot down by the FDA. To do a phase III study with
endpoints and patient population that was frowned upon by the FDA would have not worked. Did you listen to
the conference call?


The BTD was a reach, and it should never have been publicized, that is the mistake PVCT management
made. It was a huge gamble and backfired.


however, on June 2nd, we will know more about their plan. I hope its a bridging study powered to show
clinically significant reduction in pain and bleeding to get the BTD.


The phase III can then be powered with the desired endpoints and patient population. PV-10 has so much
potential to help patients.


I am bullish on PVCT, more so than ever now due to the amazingly low share price, and tripled my position
today(my original position was small, so I'm not as jaded as many other longs and remain in good spirits)....

I thought I would bring up some things from your last article (there is a point by point refutation posted there, this is
just to point out the lack of investigational journalism and that this would not hold up in any real new article:


“This report outlines connections between PVCT and some of Wall Street's shadiest participants.” If you think those
mentioned, which you TRY to link to PVCT are shady, you don’t know Wallstreet.


“patents begin to expire in 2016.” Yes, the patents not related to their cancer treatment which expire in 16+ years.


“can be bought for $30 at any medical supply store” An AF talking point. It’s not the same and it can’t be used from
the medical supply store. No doctor ever would.


“the doctor involved with research into PV-10 was sued by the SEC for insider trading”.’ He is settled a suit with no
wrongdoing when his father’s account made $14k in 2006 before an announcement of a drug trial result. He paid a
fine. He disclosed no ownership in PVCT in a recent article. This happened years before ever working with PVCT. He
is employed by St. Luke’s research hospital.


You say he is “the doctor”. That is incorrect. He is one of more than ten doctors with their names tied to the research
of PV10, including world and US renown melanoma experts.


http://bit.ly/1k5BXej


Merrick Ross (the US authority)  
Moffit is currently the world highest ranked cancer center for melanoma research. 


Here are some authors/doctors from their latest ASCO 2014 Abstract:

You try to manipulate to your advantage that he “was recently involved in a failed cancer trial that resulted in drug
abandonment.” Show me a clinical researchers


“PVCT is connected to questionable stock pumpers” You try to make a vague connection with no proof and saying
they are connected to someone who is connected - guilty by association?

they have no connection to PV10 and your Small Cap conniption is unproven.    
“While the press release specifically focuses on marijuana-related investments” Yes. Because US Banks are unwilling
to take marijuana money yet as it conflicts with US law. You’re connecting this issue with PVCT?


“In January "Small-Cap Street" issued a report claiming PVCT is worth $62 per share” PVCT had nothing to do with
this and it appears to be a pump and dump scheme, before a short attack by Adam Feurestein. I am not alleging
Adam was connected (don’t use your logic), but his articles aided in the quick stock decline and panic.


“Osman Ghani has recently authored numerous reports on a variety of stocks as a paid article writer.” You fail to
mention he was not paid by PVCT but by his employer who pays him to write articles. You do realize that journalists
get paid by employers (and writers on seeking alpha get paid by seeking alpha) to write articles, no?


“I researched Paul in great depth and found a lot of red flags.” Could you provide the research and what the red flags
are? That’s what a journalist does. They present the facts. The do not say “I researched this a lot and found a lot of
bad stuff. Trust me.”


PVCT will be fighting these allegations and the lawyers looking to make a buck. I believe they are quoting Adam
Feurestein and this article as the basis for their lawsuit, which seems to lack any credible evidence (just accusation).


 “Just to use "OTCbbjournal.com" as an example, EKNL listed on the otcbbjournal.com homepage with RFMK and
OOIL shown as their picks here.


EKNL: $0 revenue, basically $0 cash and $2.85m market cap with huge stock decline”  Are you suggesting every
single stock they picked (not to defend them, I don’t read their things because they aren’t very capable writers) went
to zero? None went up? Or are you cherry picking a few bad examples?


“I also find the disclosure on compensation regarding Small Cap Street to be confusing as well. This Small Cap Street
PR about PVCT shows no disclosure of compensation as of 1/22/2014. However, this PVCT announcement shortly
after on 2/27/2014 shows Small Cap Street was paid $10k by the mysterious "Hunter Marketing.””   You really
need to have some evidence that “Hunter Marketing” is related to PVCT. There is clearly no evidence of that. How
about the idea that Hunter Marketing participated in the run up in January and then the naked short scheme. There
have been allegations a large firm in Canada naked shorted some 20 million shares.


“Multiple Small-Cap Street LLC Stocks Have Recently Been Halted by the SEC: Is PVCT next? 
Just this last Friday 5/16/2014 the SEC issued a warning to investors. In this warning the SEC highlighted they have
halted 5 stocks recently.” 
 MOST OF THESE ARE POT STOCKS!!! You are cherry picking information and virtually all pot stocks were halted,
not because of their promotion by any company (and there have been many promoting pot stocks) but because the
SEC is trying to figure out the legality of those types of stocks as marijuana is illegal by federal statute.


“Given the recent SEC actions against three public companies Small Cap Street LLC has recently written about, I
think it is possible that the SEC is looking at the various people involved and the other companies they are involved

with. PVCT stock is clearly on this list and I would not be surprised if the SEC steps in and shuts PVCT down or halts
the stock soon as well.”


CLEARLY ON THIS LIST???? “I think it’s possible” (anything is possible. You have no proof and are just guessing)
yet say “PVCT is clearly on the list”   WHAT LIST??????? There is no list. You just said you only think it’s possible.
 


“PVCT's Dr. Sanjiv Agarwala History of Drug Trial Failure”  EVERY Clinical researcher does. Show me one that
has a 100% successful drug research rate and I’ll give him a nobel prize. Investigating drugs MEANS trying to see if
they work or not. He has not bearing on if the drug works or not. Ever. He and other doctors administer and document
the drugs. He has never misled or forged any clinical tests. The accusation here does not point to anything concrete.


“Cancer is a highly complex group of diseases. Do you believe cancer will be cured by someone with this track record
of litigation by using a purified red dye?”


This doctor did not make the drug. He is one of more than a dozen doctors at seven sites in two countries doing trials,
administering the drug under compassionate use to those who do not have any hope (and have tried all approved
drugs). AND current research shows PV-10 is working on dying patients (refractory patients) who did not even
respond to the current leading drugs:   
““What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest drugs
including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a small molecule
ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of patients.” 
 http://bit.ly/RVfK7r


I could continue, but I only wanted to point out some logic errors. It’s not worth my time. People interested can learn
the facts about the drug and its efficacy, which you even fail to get into. Linking to Adam Feurestein articles does not
prove the clear evidence of efficacy, just that it has not been approved yet. He even himself suggested that they “do a
phase three and until then, shut the f#$k up” at the end of the article. Classy and professional, I might add.


The fact is, PV10 works. It works on multiple stages on melanoma. It has shown success in liver and breast. It has
shown that it boosts the immune system (it has local and systemic benefits), as well as killing cancer cells that are not
directly injected (which is great for cells not seen). It has been treated on over 200 patients to great success and has
helped the lives of many people.

Half of patients with locally advanced cutaneous melanoma who had all their lesions injected with the investigational
agent PV-10 achieved a complete response, reports a subgroup analysis of an open label phase 2 study.


The sub-group analysis, released as an ASCO abstract (May 14, 2014), provides the basis for the pending
breakthrough therapy designation application for PV-10 submitted to the FDA in March 2014.


PV-10, a 10% solution of Rose Bengal that was originally used as an agent to stain necrotic tissue in the cornea, has
been developed to selectively target and destroy cancer cells without harming surrounding healthy tissue, minimizing
the potential for side effects.


Between October 2007 and May 2010, 80 patients with Stage IIIB-IV melanoma received up to four treatment cycles
of intralesional (IL) PV-10. 
Altogether up to 10 cutaneous or subcutaneous target lesions and up to 10 additional non-target lesions received IL
PV-10 at day 0 and could receive up to three further treatment cycles at weeks 8, 12 and 16 if tumour remained.


Furthermore, up to two ‘bystander’ lesions were identified that underwent biopsy to confirm melanoma, but did not
receive treatment.


The subjects, recruited from seven centres in the USA and Australia, all had locally advanced disease refractory to a
median of six previous interventions.


In the current abstract, Sanjiv Agarwala, from St. Luke's Hospital and Health Network, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
explored the subgroup of 54 patients from the phase 2 study who were able to have most or all of their lesions
injected, leaving out patients with more advanced disease where substantial numbers of lesions went untreated from
the analysis.


Results showed that for 28 patients who had all their existing melanoma lesions injected with PV-10 (i.e. had no
uninjected lesions) the overall response rate was 71% (CI 51-87%) with 50% achieving a complete response (CI 31-
69%).


In a second analysis when these 28 patients who had all their lesions injected were considered together with a group
of 26 patients who had up to two lesions left untreated (to investigate bystander effects) a complete response was
achieved in 232 of the 363 injected lesions (64%).


Furthermore, the abstract showed that in the combined analysis 121 lesions required a single injection for complete
response, 84 required two injections, 22 required three injections and five required four injections.


Of the 28 uninjected bystander lesions 10 achieved complete response.


“These sub-analyses show PV-10- injection results are maximized when all lesions get treated. What we’re seeing
here is a remarkable response in a heavily pre treated or refractory patient population with locally advanced
cutaneous melanoma who have unmet medical needs since, unlike patients with more advanced disease, limited
treatment options are available,” said Eric Wachter, the Chief Technology Officer at Provectus, who co-developed PV-
10. 
That 56% of lesions in the sub-analysis only required one or two injections to achieve a complete response, he
added, underlines the simplicity of PV-10 treatment regimens.


“These results support a premise that not only is PV-10 safe and effective, but unlike many other intralesional
therapies, requires limited injections. This could prove highly advantageous for both patients and clinicians,” said

Wachter.


In a second abstract Amod Sarnaik, from Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa, Florida, investigated the immunological
mechanism of the ‘bystander effect’ where uninjected tumours undergo complete response.


In the study eight patients with dermal and/or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma had two lesions sampled bybiopsy
prior to treatment, then one of the two lesions was injected with IL PV-10, and both residual sites were completely
excised one to two weeks later.


Six of eight patients had metastatic disease refractory to previous ipilimumab, anti-PD-1 and/or vemurafenib therapy.
Peripheral blood was collected pre-treatment, at the time of resection and four weeks after PV-10 injection.


Results showed treatment with PV-10 led to pathological complete response (pCR) in post-treatment biopsies of both
PV-10-injected and uninjected bystander lesions in four of the eight patients, and all eight exhibited at least partial
regression of the injected lesion. IL PV-10 was associated with an increase in circulating cytotoxic CD3 /CD8 T cells
(paired t test, p=0.008).


“What’s really powerful about these results is that patients responded even after being refractory to the latest drugs
including ipilimumab, anti PD-1 and/or vemurafenib,” said Wachter, adding it was unprecedented for a small molecule
ablative agent to have this kind of immune system activity detectable in the peripheral blood of patients.


Both abstracts will be featured in the Poster Highlights Session, Melanoma/Skin Cancers, on June 2, 2014 during the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (OTC:ASCO) Annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois.

Doesn't make any sense to be short a $1 stock with phase 3 coming, phase 2 data coming 6/19, shareholder meeting
Monday 4pm, and all the momentum coming, this can spike to $5-$10 easily next week, shorts will cover.
