Is More Dilution Coming Soon For Odyssey Shareholders?
Nov. 3, 2014 6:20 AM ET27 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


OMEX Management is adamant in public statements that they do not need to raise
equity, yet their SEC filings make a more 'open' stance on the topic.


Over the last 12 months, shareholders have been significantly diluted both from
share count increasing and also from project level / subsidiary dilution.


Cash looks like it is about to run out very soon and all current projects are
encumbered.


SSCA monetization still hazy as court appeals go on: could be next "Black Swan"?
Oceanica public consultation this week will illuminate.


One year ago now we stated that we believe that within the next 12 months, Odyssey
Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) will be forced to file bankruptcy or raise equity and
dilute shareholders. There has not yet been a bankruptcy filing though shareholders have
been diluted and the company has significantly curtailed operations including shelving the
big commodity wreck program, the CEO resigned, and the Dorado Discovery 2nd ship has
been released.


The company has been able to raise some equity over the last 12 months, diluting
shareholders (discussed below in detail) but we believe there is much more dilution
coming soon if the company expects to avoid a bankruptcy filing.


Management Says They Don't Need to Raise Equity


Aug 15, 2013: "These results, along with planned monetization of mineral exploration
projects, put us in position to fund our scheduled exploration and recovery activities
through this year and most of 2014," said Greg Stemm


Since our report raising serious questions was posted Oct 31, 2013, management has
been highly explicit and adamant in public statements that they do not need to raise
equity:

Nov 7, 2013 FAQ:


"We have no plans for any OMEX stock offering in 2013 or 2014."


Q1 Conf Call May 2014:


"We believe that our cash on hand and these other cash sources will be sufficient to cover
our costs and pursue our planned projects for the rest of the year."


CFO: "Let me start of by making something very clear. We have no plans to do any equity
raise with Odyssey stock."


CFO: "All of the different scenarios have been envisaged, and all of them do not require
an equity raise for 2014. So that, I think that's clarified."


2014 AGM Q&A June 4, 2014


"We do not anticipate needing to undertake any equity raise in 2014."


Q2 Conf Call Aug 2014: Discussing new "Marketing Loan": "There is no dilution of
Odyssey equity, and we receive an immediate $5 million with an additional $5 million in
funding available to us in the coming months, based on attaining certain mutually agreed
performance targets"


"We are not facing any sort of imminent liquidity crisis and I'm confident we have the cash
and funding in place that will carry us through to our next significant monetization events"


"I'm asking you to give your Management team a chance to allow actual results to
influence your judgment as to whether OMEX is an investment you should buy, hold or
sell."


Getting a Different Picture from the Legal SEC Docs


All of the above quotes were made with the benefit of a "safe harbor" for forward looking
statements in press releases that are highly forgiving when it comes to making optimistic
statements from a legal perspective. Shareholders should always check the official SEC
legal documents to corroborate press release statements as making untrue statements in
SEC filings can have serious consequences, in contrast to press releases.

We may also have to revert to capital raises that include equity and/or convertible
debt to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated cash balance at
June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support approximately two
months of operations. …


While we have been successful in generating cash inflows and raising the necessary
funds in the past, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in 2014
or the following twelve months.


Understanding What Dilution Means


To use a pie analogy: Dilution occurs when a slice of the pie (e.g. share of the total) you
hold becomes smaller. This can happen either by:


1) Making your slice "narrower" by directly increasing the number of slices: imagine the
size of a pie cut 10 ways rather than 6.


2) Making the slices "thinner" by introducing additional layers of slices below the surface
of the pie.


Three specific examples of dilution of shareholder value in the last 12 months:


1) $2.4mm of the 8% note which was partially repaid in cash but where OMEX issued
1.29mm shares to repay this note with stock in Q2 2014: "In 2014, we issued 1,290,155
shares of common stock, valued at $2,420,863" - 10Q Aug 2014


2) $2.5mm raised to sell a % of Oceanica to Mako Resources in January 2014


3) $5mm "marketing loan" Aug 2014 which includes giving equity of a subsidiary as
consideration (Details not yet disclosed except in 8K filed Aug 14: "As further
consideration for the credit facility, Odyssey assigned to the lender a portion of the shares

that Odyssey owns in an Odyssey subsidiary")


These actions sum up so that in addition to the share count increasing from 83,587,243 on
Oct 25 (Q3 2013 10Q) to 85,229,295 on July 21, 2014 (Q2 2013 10Q) = 1,642,052
increase of 2% making your slice "narrower", the share slices have been made thinner by
shrinking OMEX's ownership in its subsidiaries.


When Might Shareholder Dilution be Coming? Soon!


A company needs cash to fund payroll and other operations or it comes to a grinding halt.
So far, OMEX has been able to kick the can down the road with project level dilution but
we do not see how this could be possible going forward. All of OMEX's projects appear to
already have project level overrides or financing associated with them already and there
do not appear to be any unencumbered assets that could be borrowed against (the ship is
likely too old to get a loan against).


We also still don't know what subsidiary the most recent "marketing loan" was granted
shares in. We also know from on-the-ground sources that OMEX was attempting to raise
money for Oceanica in the UK this summer but was unsuccessful in doing so. The EIA
has been filed and there has been significant opposition to the project but much more
information will be available after the official public consultation in Mexico later this week.


Estimating When Cash Could Run Out


OMEX's Historical Operating Cash burn (Cash flow from operations + capex):


Q1 2014: $11.76mm = $3.92mm/mo


Q2 2014: $7.35mm (but accounts payables increased by $1mm) so cash burn would be
$8.35mm excluding this. $2.78mm/mo


(looking historically, the lowest it's ever been in the last decade on an annual basis is
about $1.5mm/mo)


Let's say an optimistic estimate is $2mm/month cash burn for Q3 and onwards and
pessimistic is $3mm/month.

Comments (27)


Based on the balance sheet from June 30, 2014 and the known payments, we estimate
that the cash balance will reach $0 sometime between now and February 2015 in the best
possible case which includes an additional $5mm for achieving currently undisclosed
performance targets.


Another possible source of cash could be the SSCA monetization, however that appears
to still be in appeals from CADG according to the docket and it is unclear when that will be
resolved. That cash will also need to be used primarily to repay the ~$7.5mm Fifth Third
loan.


We look forward to learning more from the coming 10-Q that must be filed by Nov 15.
Oceanica's prospects for approval will also be clarified after the public consultation later
this week and the most powerful environmental NGO in Mexico, CEMDA will make their
official stance on the project known. We are not optimistic on Oceanica as another BCS
mining project just threw in the towel and gave up and CEMDA has said they intend to
help change the laws to more explicitly and strictly cover marine mining situations recently.

Actually, share dilution is also a result of short selling. In order to sell short, the seller must borrow stock from a
broker. The broker takes stock he is holding for a customer and loans it to the short, who sells it. Now there are two
buyers who think they own the same stock, and now there are two shares where before there was one.


OMEX has 85 million shares outstanding, and there are 19 million sold short, making a total of 104 million shares
bought by shareholders. The stock has been diluted just as if OMEX had sold an additional 19 million shares.


The good part of this is that when short sellers cover by buying and returning the borrowed shares to the broker, it has
the same effect as if OMEX did a share buyback. When the number of shares is reduced and the company's value
remains unchanged, the usual result is higher share prices.


Arithmetically, when all OMEX shorts have covered and shareholders can own only 85 million shares instead of 104
million, the share price will be 22% higher from this alone.

I'm curious - how much of an upside do you see with this trade? I understand that you think the PPS will go to zero,
but honestly - how much money do you (or your charity) stand to make "when" that happens? It seems to me that
there are plenty of opportunities out there with less risk and greater return that you could be taking advantage of.

In my opinion, this stock is not driven only by news; in addition, it is driven by loyalty, or perhaps by "fans who are
rooting for their team". I think your odds of successfully driving (or anticipating) this stock going to zero are very slim.
There will always be investors who "root" for OMEX and will accept any actions the company takes to remain solvent.
Furthermore, I think that your very public position on the company continues to ignite the support of "diehard fans".
Going further, I believe that your public comments continue to draw attention to the company. It would be difficult to
argue that this attention has not had negative impacts on OMEX (e.g. the precipitous decline in PPS before April
2014). However, going forward, this attention will (in my opinion) begin (or has begun) to support the PPS and will
likely prevent significant further decline. I think it is difficult to quantify the "animus" of the market. At some point, the
numbers, forecasts, SEC filings, and everything else that is "rational" does not matter. I would argue that OMEX is at
this stage; and the proof, I think, is how your articles have been unable to sustain the PPS below about $0.90. Mr.
Morris, optimism is a powerful thing. Optimism has the potential blind investors to rational considerations. Although it
is obvious that optimism cannot ensure the *profitability* of a company, I believe it can be successfully argued that
optimism can ensure the *continued existence* of an otherwise (in your opinion) unsustainable business.


I am not arguing that $0.90 is (a) a true market value; (b) that you have not damaged the company by driving the PPS
to $0.90 [in other words, give credit where credit's due]; or (c) that the PPS can't be driven lower than $0.90. I am
arguing that the PPS will asymptotically approach a lower bound and it will be difficult (perhaps impossible) to drive it
lower. Again, without considering the possibility of future catalysts, the "diehard fans" who are "rooting for the little
guy" will prevent the PPS from declining much further. I would also suggest that your crusade against the company
has ignited (and will continue to ignite) public support to such degree that *if* they had to offer shares, buyers would
line up and the company would be able to successfully raise capital.


However, I am sure that you already understand the importance of public perception in this context. I believe that your
offer to donate your OMEX profits to charity is an attempt to give the public a reason to "root" for you. However, I
would argue that this your PR campaign will not be successful because (a) the social connotations of managing a
hedge fund are such that people assume everything you say is disingenuous; (b) you have unsuccessfully specified
exact dates for bankruptcy that damaged the credibility of your arguments; and (c) this campaign has made you a
pariah in the eyes of many small(er) investors who have lost money on OMEX and believe (perhaps correctly) that
you are to blame. I would argue that point (c) is (and will be) the most problematic aspect of your campaign because
the cost to "buy in" is cheap. And because the stock is cheap, it will be difficult to dissuade investors to not speculate,
or perhaps more importantly, to not support "their team" in a fight for survival against the "evil hedge fund." It is based
on this consideration that I put forth the argument that the PPS will asymptotically approach a lower bound and it will
be very difficult to continue driving it lower. Furthermore, I believe that this consideration will continue to be a source
of public support for the company that will enable it to take measures that ensure solvency.


In my opinion, these factors will also make your short position on the company increasingly tenuous, if not dangerous,
in the future. Because (a) the PPS is cheap, (b) "hope springs eternal", (c) the company has had several positive
developments recently, and (d) there is the potential for a large catalyst in the future (Don Diego project), there is
significant risk to the upside that is largely disproportionate to any potential gains you could realize by further drops in
PPS valuation. As an example, the recent spike from $0.90 to $1.34 (approximately 50% increase) that occurred of a
span of *three days* based on news that contained *no information* regarding financial benefits of a new project
should give you pause. I think that this is a perfect example of how powerful optimism can be. It is telling that the
announcement of the HMS Victory contract contained *no guidance* on potential impacts to the company's bottom
line; yet the *ever optimistic investor* suddenly assigned a 50% higher valuation to the company. Given the likelihood

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2630075-is-more-dilution-coming-soon-for-odyssey-shareholders 9/16


that the Don Diego project will be approved, the potential for PPS to increase such that your short position implodes
is, in my opinion, increasingly likely.


I am sure that you are very aware of how tenuous your position is. The days to cover metric is extraordinarily high,
and this is a very dangerous position to be in for short investors. Additionally, it would be *extremely* profitable for
another large investor to precipitate a squeeze. Given the low daily volume and cheap price to buy in, even a short-
term "pump and dump" campaign could be incredibly damaging to your position. In fact, much of the message board
chatter regarding OMEX is based on this very possibility. Investors (really, gamblers) are able to buy in at a *very*
cheap price with decent odds of making 2x - 10x their initial cost. And should this occur, OMEX could (and likely
would) seize the opportunity to raise capital at inflated prices. In this event, dilution would not need to be significant,
as inflated prices would allow them to issue fewer new shares. And the market's reaction to *dilution* would likely be
negligible. A good example of this can be observed in LAKE. The company took advantage of a "pump and dump"
campaign predicated on Ebola fears to issue shares at a PPS of $10 - approximately double the PPS of a few weeks
earlier. It would be very ironic if your short position (that is predicated on your argument of unsustainable financials)
ended up providing them with a perfect opportunity to improve the financial viability of their business.


Overall, I believe that your short thesis for OMEX is running on fumes. In my opinion, this position becomes more
dangerous with each passing day. You can take this post with a grain of salt (as I'm sure you will), but if I can see
these possibilities (and I am an unsophisticated, small-time investor), can't others see them too?

I believe your reliance on hope and loyalty to keep the share price and company alive are misguided to say
the least. Loyalty and hope do not pay the bills.


While the announcement by Odyssey contained no guidance on expectations of value, the news media was
full of valuations. There was an SA article published within hours of the announcement claiming a potential
$815M value of the Victory cargo. The rest of the media hype included such valuations, that to the
unsophisticated investor like yourself, must have made it appear they hit a payday.


The Oceanica project has also run amok in the media, again, with articles here on SA, and in the media,
showing the 'potential' again to be upwards of $1B.


How is it that the media and certain individuals, feel free to provide these valuations without scrutiny? When
scrutinized, or asked to provide factual data, nothing appears.


The statements by the Company were very clear: 
"Our consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support approximately
two months of operations. …"  
Looking back at that SEC filing, one would see that there were accounts payable and accrued debts of
$6.04M. In other words, they had cash for 2 months assuming they did not pay these debts. This does not
include the mortgage debts or any other loan amounts either.


That was back at the end of June. It is now November, and what revenue have they provided to pay these
debts? The only active project was the Central America. There was no revenue captured by that recovery to
date.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2630075-is-more-dilution-coming-soon-for-odyssey-shareholders 10/16


Where is the money to pay the debts and operational expenses coming from? Hope and Loyalty?


Current funding is through loans. It would appear, since there is no revenue, that the loans are the only way to
pay the amounts due for operations, the $6+M accounts payable, and the current loans.


The loan secured by the Central America recovery is based on a contract with RLP, a company currently in
bankruptcy court. The Admiralty Arrest that gave RLP the rights to the Central America recovery is under
appeal. 
Typically, appeals are on an 18 month calendar, but there is no way to determine the Court priority.This issue
will likely cause delay in marketing the recovery until determined.


Oceanica appears to be at the limit of monetization for Odyssey. Should Odyssey sell off any more of its
percentage, it would lose the ability for consolidation filings. That is not likely to happen.


The latest 'marketing loan'. From the 8K filing: 
On August 14, 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (“Odyssey”) entered into a loan agreement with a
strategic marketing partner that provides for loans of up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. At closing,
Odyssey borrowed $5.0 million, and Odyssey has the right to borrow the remainder in two tranches of $2.5
million each upon the achievement of milestones set forth in the loan agreement. Advances under the loan
agreement bear interest at a rate of 8.0% for the first year and 11.0% thereafter. The credit facility provides for
monthly payments of interest only, with the principal amount and all accrued interest due and payable on
August 14, 2016. As further consideration for the credit facility, Odyssey assigned to the lender a portion of
the shares that Odyssey owns in an Odyssey subsidiary and granted the lender the right to convert the
outstanding loan balance into shares of that subsidiary or to purchase additional shares of that subsidiary
from Odyssey if the loan is repaid. Odyssey’s obligations under the credit facility are secured by specified
assets, including a portion of Odyssey’s shares in the subsidiary. Odyssey’s obligation to repay the principal
and accrued interest may be accelerated at the option of the lender if an event of default, as specified in the
loan agreement, occurs. Odyssey may prepay the outstanding loan balance before the maturity date."


So far $5M at 8%, with monthly interest payments. Where is that cash coming from to pay that interest, as
well as all of the other loans that are due? 
An unknown subsidiary has been pledged, why is that subsidiary unknown?  
Odysseys share of the subsidiary is included as collateral, but there is other collateral pledged for this loan,
what is that?


The buildings appear to be fully mortgaged, the remaining coins from the Republic are mortgaged, the Central
America recovery is encumbered...what is left?


Those are the bottom line factual numbers of revenue and debt. One can easily see why the author of this
article considers a bankruptcy looming.

Thank you for the thoughtful post. I certainly do not dispute the points you've made. Any rational analysis of
the company's finances would likely lead to conclusions similar to those of Mr. Morris.

The point that I was trying to convey with my post(s) is that OMEX valuation is likely to enjoy irrational support
that will make it unlikely for them to file bankruptcy in the near-term. Certainly loyalty and hope do not pay the
bills *directly* (although I wish I could pay my bills like that!); however, loyalty and hope could "grease the
wheels" such that the company has greater latitude to take steps to ensure it remains solvent.


I also argued that the intractably large short position that Mr. Morris has built makes him very susceptible to
the short-term volatility that is common in "penny stock" trading. I think you comments regarding media hype
support this thesis.


Again, thanks for the post.

available to publish.

User 25877403
I would also like to expand somewhat on how you will unwind your short position. I think it is pretty apparent that your
end game for this position is to wait for OMEX to file bankruptcy. In my opinion, this is really the *only* way that you'll
be able to unwind this position profitably. I believe that any other approach to unwinding this position will be
extraordinarily expensive for you. The short position that you have built, combined with the low trading volumes and
cheap share price, could easily result in a squeeze of massive proportions.


I think it is important to point out that the days-to-cover metric assumes that all of an average day's volume would go
to covering net shares sold short. In real life, this is unlikely. Supposing that you could capture 50% of daily volume to
cover, it would take approximately 140 days to completely unwind this position. This is an incredible figure - it
represents approximately 7 months of trading!! And during this time, I believe that investors would recognize the
squeeze as such and therefore have *incentive to keep holding*. The PPS could rapidly spiral upwards. Couple that
with institutions who "join the party" and rapidly escalating interest costs on your position and you could experience a
"perfect storm".


Given the possibilities of this occurring, it is clear that OMEX bankruptcy is the *only* practical way to unwind your
position. However, your rational analysis has been predicting this result for one year, and while the PPS has dropped
by about 50%, OMEX is not at the precipice of bankruptcy. Indeed, recent developments are likely to result in greater
liquidity than last year when you initiated this campaign. I believe that there will come a time when the evidence
*against* OMEX filing bankruptcy cannot be refuted.


Furthermore, owing to the fact that the predictions of bankruptcy have not yet materialized, it is possible that investors
will grow tired of "waiting" and begin to move funds back into the company. This could easily occur with *any hint* of
positive developments regarding the Don Diego project. Even this organic growth in interest could spell trouble for
your position.

In this situation, I believe that you are no longer in control of where the PPS is headed. If this is the case, the actions
that you have to take to maintain the status quo are likely to be become more "desperate" (for lack of a better word). It
is in this situation where weakness becomes apparent that risks can increase exponentially. Unfortunately, this
position does not lend itself to an orderly unwinding under any other circumstance than OMEX insolvency. I would
agree with the idea that much greater companies have fallen, but OMEX enjoys a unique type of support owing to its
unconventional business model and loyal followers. In my opinion, OMEX has a much greater chance of seeing PPS
at $10 than $0.

Perhaps you missed the one where he responded to Green River with a picture of a barking poodle. That pic
and the comment wherein I complained about it are both gone. He is worried....make no mistake. Nobody
who was confident would have a need to produce this article so soon after the last one. RM is worried, in my
humble opinion.


And, the bar at Seeking Alpha for what passes for analysis is, is incredibly low. I've had posts removed for
"questioning the authors credibility"? Like that doesn't matter? Apparently what he says today trumps all his
incorrect predictions in the past. OK Seeking Alpha, how do you vet yr authors? Yr readers would like to
know.


Let's see how long this post lasts.

R: 
Do you have any examples to back up what you are saying? You go on to attack the author, yet provide no
facts or data for your allegations, simply that the author is wrong.


That is likely why your posts are deleted.

269..., the links are provided above by SA. Click on any of Meson's articles to find a prediction that didn't
come true, apparently based on faulty analysis. "Bankruptcy by July" is one of my favorite topics, along with
the one where he claimed Oceanica drilled core samples illegally (which has been thoroughly disproved).
That article still exists on Seeking Alpha while my rebuttal of it is as gone as Labor Day weekend. So, yr
theory is as lacking as Mr. Morris' analysis.


How does Seeking Alpha vet their "analysts," are you familiar with the process? How much editorial power
does an author here have over the "comments" section? Any insight you can offer would be appreciated.

Also the one wherein he claimed the EIS was "leaked to social media" after it was in fact filed and released,
that link, last I looked still existed above. Oh, I see you have to click on his name to see it...click on "Meson
Capital Partners" to see the full list of his faulty analysis.


Good thought 269... but it doesn't bear up to any scrutiny. Further, unless you are visiting us via an alias, you
have no clue as to the content of my posts which were removed. One was simply a link without commentary
to a site that disproved the Morris claim. It was vaporized as apparently he cannot abide honest debate or
criticism. Good try friend, 269, but there is more to this than you suggest.

Talking about a $1+/- stock having to raise capital at some point, is not earth shattering. With OMEX, that can take
many different looks: straight equity, convertible, debt (unlikely), specific project financing, asset (Oceanica)
monetization part or whole etc . Frankly, I think if they can get decent terms-relatively- they should do a convert to one
or two institutions, even before an Oceanica decision. If Oceanica is a green light, then it really won't matter and they
were just being cautious, and if Oceanica is delayed, then, well, it would have been very prudent to get some cash in
the door for HMS Victory, commodity wrecks, etc before final monetization of the SSCA. Regardless, they may or may
not and it is hardly worth writing about..for the umpteenth time, but that is your prerogative, and SA has provided you
with a very friendly platform to do so. 
Anyway, the real elephant in the room is Oceanica and the public hearings/meetings which start this week. 
You mentioned the large NGO, CEMDA, in your article: I am not familiar with them as they are a local, yet quite vocal
and powerful group from what I've read, so what are your thoughts on which way they lean and the effect they can
have on the process and outcome. Thanks

Meson is now at panic level. They lost their chance to reap large gains before the CA recovery and are now
desparate. Anyone reading their posts needs to know that the large portion of their claims are fictitious. Perhaps they
should reveal to all of us just what profit will accrue from Ryan's assertion that he will give profits from all his shorts to
charity. Don't get too exited charities. I doubt that Ryan has personally shorted any OMEX. He is paid as other
managers of similar funds are paid: by a share of profits. Don't be swayed by this guy-his time is running out and he
knows it.

Meson: I would like to point out to you that as your theory is slowly falling apart! You now resort to the Bill Ackman
approach? Donate $ to public officials and write letters to attempt to disrupt any and all operations. In the least you
attempt to delay approvals for as long as it takes, in hopes that your 12 month long Bankrupt call, " extended to 15
months." Might actually take hold. 
In this Q about to become public have you included any current operations income, to your above numbers? Like the

income from Navy contract work or RLP current payments and or forward IOU's? Also The current appeal in the Ohio

The 3Q about to become public would have been from the period ending August 31st. It is unlikely that any
current revenue, if any, would be included in that filing.


According to the recent article on the Central America, RLP has made no payments to Odyssey, and has not
made any decisions on how to monetize the recovery to date. Why do you think that RLP has made any
payments to Odyssey?


While Odyssey will likely add the amount owed for costs of the CA recovery 'owed' to them by RLP, between
the appellate process, and the determination to return next year or not, it appears any monetization of the
recovery is a long way off.  
The gold coins are carry a double edged blade. When the gold coins from the last recovery hit the market, it
depressed the value of the 1857-S, about 50%, due to the number of coins available. The release of another
batch of coins will likely further depress that year. Until a decision is made to return or not, collectors will not
know if there are 5000 more or 50 more, thus affecting the value. There were some rare coins found, and the
value will be determined by the number found, so once again, the decision to return or not is significant in the
decision to monetize.


I would also remind you that Odyssey's contract is with RLP, which is currently in Bankruptcy Court, so one
should probably not be so reliant on that payment.


During the 3Q time period, the only project that Odyssey talked about working on was the Central America.
Why do you think that they had Navy Contract work they were paid for during that time period?


The current appeal is not in the Ohio Court, but in the Admiralty Court in Virginia. The Admiralty Arrest has be
appealed by 3 different parties. I feel there is a very good chance of the decision to be overturned. What will
happen to the recovery at that point is unknown. Either way, it is doubtful there can be any monetization of the
recovery until the Appellate Court decision. Appeals are typically on an 18 month calendar, but I have no idea
of the Court docket and prioritization of that Court.


I would note that a Bankruptcy Court is tasked with maximizing the return to the creditors. While Odyssey will
be paid their costs, I sincerely doubt that Odyssey will be paid the 45% of proceeds before the original
investors, creditors, and associated Court costs are paid.


CADG is a Corporation, not a sole proprietorship owned by Tommy Thompson.


IOU's do not pay current bills, costs, and interest payments on debts.

The Q ends September 31st. If you get your first fact straight the rest would almost be believable

It seems the OMEX long thesis can be distilled down to "it hasn't filed for bankruptcy yet"

KB, 
That about sums it up. One would refer to the Hope and Loyalty comment. While for some this may be a boutique
stock, for others it is an investment to which they had hopes of some accomplishments and perhaps some return on
the $200M plus that has been spent over time.

We've seen this movie before...different setting...different actors...yet it still ends the same. Paper profits or losses are
irrelevant when the winners and losers are revealed. Lucky those above who are new to the drama and have dry
powder to put into the chamber. The time at which we press the trigger is when reality sets in, not before. The actions
of the players are being scrutinized by swarms of investigatory bodies, no matter what attempts to silence the facts of
the matter. Despair is now shifting between the longs to the shorts. Oh what a squeeze this will be!


The rights to this soap opera have yet to be sold to Discovery Channel...add that to EPS!

With OMEX's share of the CA recovery estimated at $50 million, the forecasts of running out of money seem far
fetched. Some length of time must be alloted for the individual examination of 16,000 coins, but it may be assumed
the most salable coins will be looked at first. If low cash on hand becomes a problem, then some coins will be
monetized.


This same problem existed after the first CA salvage was terminated due to legal difficulties twenty years ago, in fact
the situation was probably worse then. But those coins were sold.


Instead of a bankruptcy filing, the more likely announcement is of coin sales which thereby replenish OMEX' treasury,
ensuring salvage of the HMS Victory. This should give a major boost to the stock price. Eventual Mexican government
approval of the Oceanica project and the shorts are dead meat.

"With OMEX's share of the CA recovery estimated at $50 million" I think you are very high with your estimate,
Bill, maybe by a factor of 2. Otherwise, I agree 100% with the rest of your post.

Where are these outlandish values coming from? Even Odyssey is not estimating that sort of value. The reasonable
estimates for what has been recovered to date are about $35M total, not Odysseys share.


There have been many breakdowns of what was recovered, and most put the amount to odyssey, assuming they get
45%, at around $12M to $15M. That is placing Odyssey on the same tier as RLP, which I do not believe. I believe they
are a sub to RLP, and will be paid the 45% of RLP's percentage. As one can see, the terminology in the Q has been
revised again, and when asked in the CC, Odyssey claimed NDA.


Gordon stated it himself, they expect to be paid their expenses and be able to pay off the $10M 5th 3rd loan.
Remember his cost +$30% comment?

Since the coins have not been evaluated at least to the stockholders (who are they anyway?) to make that claim is
absurd but par for the course for the P...s.
