More On Lumber Liquidators And Formaldehyde
Apr. 15, 2015 4:56 PM ET50 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


While everyone is exposed to small amounts of formaldehyde in the air, the amount
emitted by Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-made laminate, according to tests 60
Minutes and others have done, is far above typical indoor air levels.


Thus, Lumber Liquidators is vulnerable to lawsuits by customers suffering adverse
health effects associated with exposure to excess levels of formaldehyde.


There is currently no national law setting a limit for formaldehyde in indoor air, but I
think regulators are almost certain to set a standard in the 7-33 ppb range (probably
much closer to the low end).


The three Lumber Liquidators samples 60 Minutes had tested came in far higher, at
57, 93 and 268 ppb.


Assuming the regulators’ tests show similar results, it’s unclear what actions they
might take, but I suspect they’ll be very onerous for Lumber Liquidators - and its
stock.


In any investment I make, I do my best to seek out people, facts and analyses that
challenge my investment thesis - and I make an extra effort for my largest positions and
those about which I've been very public, as I'm especially vulnerable in these situations to
what's called "confirmation bias."


Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL), my largest short position, is a good example. To try to
offset confirmation bias, I regularly engage in healthy debates with numerous people
regarding this company, consider every analyst report, whether bullish or bearish, read
articles on this site and elsewhere, and participated in a bull-debate debate over a lunch
organized by PiperJaffray last Friday.


The bull case can be summarized as follows: this whole Lumber Liquidators-is-knowingly-
breaking-the-law-and-poisoning-its-customers thing is "fantastical," nothing meaningful will
happen to the company vis-à-vis regulators, customers or legal liability, earnings will

rebound strongly, exceeding $3/share within a couple of years, and the stock will once
again be awarded a premium growth multiple by investors, and therefore trade up to at
least $75.


With the NBA regular season ending today, allow me to use a basketball analogy: the
bulls think this is a touch foul while I think it's a flagrant 2 foul, for the reasons I've outlined
in the 12 articles I've published over the past six weeks. If the bulls are right, this stock is
going up; if I am, this company (and stock) will be under enormous pressure for years to
come.


In this article, I'd like to address two arguments I've heard the bulls make, both related to
formaldehyde.


The Many Sources of Formaldehyde


The first is that, even if it can be shown that someone exposed to Lumber Liquidators'
Chinese-made laminate is suffering adverse health effects caused by formaldehyde, who's
to say that the formaldehyde came from the company's flooring? After all, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Everyone is exposed to small amounts of
formaldehyde in the air" because formaldehyde is found in:


Resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products (i.e., hardwood plywood,
particleboard and medium-density fiberboard)
Building materials and insulation
Household products such as glues, permanent press fabrics, paints and coatings,
lacquers and finishes, and paper products
Preservatives used in some medicines, cosmetics and other consumer products such
as dish washing liquids and fabric softeners
Fertilizers and pesticides


It is a byproduct of combustion and certain other natural processes, and so is also
found in:


Emissions from un-vented, fuel burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space
heaters.
Cigarette smoke.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072996-more-on-lumber-liquidators-and-formaldehyde 3/21


The primary way you can be exposed to formaldehyde is by breathing air containing
off-gassed formaldehyde. Everyone is exposed to small amounts of formaldehyde in
the air that has off-gassed from products, including composite wood products.


To address this argument, I asked Dr. Philip Landrigan, who is one of the world's leading
experts on exposure to toxic chemicals and was interviewed in the 60 Minutes story, the
following question:


Given all of these sources of formaldehyde, why should anyone be worried about a
little bit more from Lumber Liquidators' laminate?


He replied:


It all depends on how much someone is exposed to. Substances considered toxic
are harmless in small doses and, conversely, an ordinarily harmless substance can
be deadly if over-consumed.


Exactly. For all the talk about the many sources of formaldehyde in a home, various
studies have shown that the average American is actually exposed to very low and
declining levels of formaldehyde in their home. For example, regarding one of the main
sources, pressed-wood products, the Consumer Product Safety Commission notes that:


Formaldehyde emissions from pressed-wood products have been reduced 80-90%
from levels in the 1980s and earlier due to mandatory formaldehyde emission
standards in California and national voluntary formaldehyde emission standards…


And here's an excerpt from a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Formaldehyde Exposure in Homes, that cites four studies from 1985, 1999, 2000 and
2005 showing sharply declining formaldehyde levels in the average home over time:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072996-more-on-lumber-liquidators-and-formaldehyde 4/21


An early U.S. study conducted in 1985 investigated formaldehyde levels in different
types of housing. That study demonstrated that formaldehyde levels in 38
conventional U.S. homes averaged 40 parts per billion (ppb) with highs of 140 ppb.
Nineteen apartments and 11 condominiums were also studied and had
formaldehyde levels averaging 80 ppb and 90 ppb, respectively, with highs of 290
ppb (Stock & Mendez, 1985). A more recent study of new homes found the
geometric mean formaldehyde level was 34 ppb in manufactured homes and 36 ppb
in site-built homes (Hodgson et al., 2000). This study also suggested that
formaldehyde concentrations in conventional homes have decreased greatly since
the 1980s due to decreased use of plywood paneling and reduced emissions from
the composite wood products used.


In another study conducted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
National Human Exposure Assessment Survey found 189 Arizona homes had a
median formaldehyde level of 17 ppb with a high of 332 ppb. (Gordon et al., 1999)
The most recent study of 184 single family homes in different several cities (RIOPA,
2005) found a mean concentration of formaldehyde in outdoor ambient air of 3 ppb
and in housing of 17 ppb. That same study found a mean level of formaldehyde for
mobile homes or trailers ranging from 15.5 to 24.7 ppb.


In short, the most recent study found the "mean concentration of formaldehyde…in
housing of 17 ppb...(and) a mean level of formaldehyde for mobile homes or trailers
ranging from 15.5 to 24.7 ppb." (Note that this study is a decade old, so levels are likely
even lower today.)


This trend of declining formaldehyde levels in the average home is a testament to the
effectiveness of strong environment regulation and is great news for American families.


But it's not great news for Lumber Liquidators because the formaldehyde emitted by its
Chinese-made laminate flooring is many times higher: 57, 93 and 268 ppb, according to
the three emissions tests 60 Minutes commissioned (posted here).


Thus, assuming additional testing is consistent with these results, I think most reasonable
people (including, most importantly, regulators, judges and juries) would conclude that
when someone exposed to Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate suffers symptoms
consistent with breathing in excess levels of formaldehyde, the flooring is to blame.


What Indoor Air Limits Regulators Are Likely to Set

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072996-more-on-lumber-liquidators-and-formaldehyde 5/21


Another, related, argument bulls make is that even if the three emissions tests 60 Minutes
commissioned are representative of all of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate,
who's to say that 57, 93 and 268 ppb are dangerous levels? After all, there is no national
law setting a limit for formaldehyde in indoor air - rather, various regulators have come up
with vastly different numbers, as this table shows:


In addition, here are three more data points:


1) The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (COEHHA) sets
formaldehyde limits of 55 micrograms per meter cubed for acute (short-term) exposure
and 9 micrograms per meter cubed for 8-hour and chronic exposure.


(9 micrograms per meter cubed = 7 ppb, which is the figure I used in my article, A
Response To Lumber Liquidators, when I wrote: "Lumber Liquidators claims that 'The
emissions from our laminate floors will typically only add approximately 5 ppb to a home
when first installed.' If true, this would be good news since regulators have set 7 ppb as
the limit to protect everyone, including children.")

and Health, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072996-more-on-lumber-liquidators-and-formaldehyde 6/21


2) COEHHA, in another document (see page 5), sets formaldehyde limits of 40
micrograms per meter cubed [33 ppb] for "No Significant Risk Levels (NSRLs) for
Carcinogens."


3) The California Air Resource Board (CARB), in a 2004 report entitled Formaldehyde in
the Home, notes that adverse health effects begin at 40 ppb and, in addition, citing a study
by COEHHA, concluded that:


For an eight-hour exposure time, no short-term adverse effects would be expected to
occur if average levels do not exceed 27 ppb (OEHHA's interim 8-hour REL).


However, people often spend more than eight hours a day in their homes; infants,
young children and the infirm sometimes spend virtually the entire day inside their
home. Thus, it is highly desirable that residential levels remain well below 27 ppb to
avoid acute effects in such individuals. To avoid irritant effects, air concentrations in
new homes, including manufactured homes, also should not exceed 27 ppb.


(Note that a 1991 report by CARB, entitled Formaldehyde in the Home, Indoor Air Quality
Guideline No. 1 and Supplement, set 100 ppb as an "action level" and 50 ppb as a "target
level," but this has been superseded by the 2004 CARB report.)


In summary, at the low end, we have 7 ppb and at the high end, 750, as this table shows:


Recall that the three samples of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate that 60
Minutes had tested came in at 57, 93 and 268 ppb, so depending on which standard one
uses, one could conclude that the laminate is far (8-38 times) above a safe level of 7 ppb -
or that's it's well below the HUD and OSHA levels, so it's likely fine.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072996-more-on-lumber-liquidators-and-formaldehyde 7/21


What should we conclude? And, more importantly, after numerous federal regulators such
as the Consumer Product Safety Commission and EPA finish emissions tests on Lumber
Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate, what are they likely to conclude?


My view is that regulators are highly likely to set a national standard somewhere in the
range of the very low levels established by COEHHA, CARB, NIOSH and FEMA for six
reasons:


1) The HUD and OSHA standards are very out of date: the former was established 30
years ago in 1985 and the latter was last revised 23 years ago in 1992. Since then, the
science on formaldehyde has improved dramatically, and there's now far greater
awareness of its dangers (it's been established as a known carcinogen, among other
things), which are reflected in the more recent and much lower levels set by other
regulators.


2) The OSHA standard is for a workplace (i.e., adults, eight hours per day) whereas, for
flooring, regulators will be concerned about babies and children in homes pretty much
24/7.


3) There are five data points between 7 and 33 ppb - and two extreme outliers. Where do
you think regulators are likely to set the national standard?


4) Note that the maximum formaldehyde levels in the table above are for all formaldehyde
in indoor air, not just from flooring, so when regulators set a level for flooring only, they are
likely to pick an even lower number.


5) The regulatory agencies looking into this are part of a Democratic administration that's
been very strong on environmental issues.


6) Given that there will always be some level of ambiguity - it's not like anyone can
definitively say "15 ppb is safe, but 16 isn't" - I can't think of any reason why an agency
charged with protecting consumers would want to take any risk.


My answer: they won't. I think regulators are almost certain to set a standard in the 7-33
ppb range (probably much closer to the low end), which means all three Lumber
Liquidators samples 60 Minutes had tested are far out of compliance. Assuming the
regulators' tests show similar results, it's unclear what actions they might take, but I
suspect they'll be very onerous for Lumber Liquidators - and its stock.

So now Tilson's short thesis rests on his 'feeling' of what a currently non existent yet to be determined, potential future
regulation is? I would be nervous if that was my thesis.

That's an excellent point: now Mr. Tilson's argument is the regulators' should put into laws that he wants, for
his own investment gain, while disregarding recent decisions (such as that of CSPC's dismissal of
deconstruction test, which Mr. Tilson conveniently decided not to mention).

And when this future regulation is determined and everyone is told exactly how to determine it, LL can simply
test its laminates in the same fashion. If it exceeds, they pull the lot...if it doesn't, they sell it to the public.

Mr. Tilson, 
What you continuously misrepresent are the facts. The OSHA limit is for a person exposed to formaldehyde at 750
ppb for 8 hours a day. What 60 minutes did is to deconstruct a wood in a chamber. That high emission (although not
recognized by CPSC and ATSM) is only for a few seconds after the wood is cut. By the same token a cigarette
generates over 6000ppb of formaldehyde. One should drop dead instantaneously if what you presented was correct
walking by a person smoking a cigarette. Even congress in their 1660 ACT require a three month testing of the
affected area ( appropriate section included at the bottom of this post).


You keep presenting data with incorrect assumptions and incorrect conclusions. I think SA has given you the benefit
of the doubt and you have over used your welcome way, way, beyond anyone can stand.


SA- I am requesting for Mr. Tilson's post on this subject to be checked for factual content because this is not
victimless and it is not only the investment community.


You just do not know when to quit.

"What 60 minutes did is to deconstruct a wood in a chamber. That high emission (although not recognized by
CPSC and ATSM) is only for a few seconds after the wood is cut."


60 Minutes did not deconstruct the finished floorboards. It was HPVA Laboratories in Virginia which did that
which is required under the CARB standard operating procedures because Lumber Liquidators is labeling
their Chinese laminates as being CARB 2 compliant, which they are not.


You can listen to the interview from the president of HPVA here about this: 
http://bit.ly/1NNcp5M


And also there was a 7 day conditioning time where the floorboards are in a ventilated chamber at 74°F
before the sample gathering of formaldehyde begins.


And the fact is a deconstructive test is much closer to real-world than just testing the top surface only with the
laminate material on top, and isolating all other surfaces with foil tape and a stainless steel plate on the
bottom which no one has on their floorboards in their house. Even during the deconstructive test, all surfaces
other than the top surface with the laminate material planed off, were isolated.


Formaldehyde from HDF core floorboards from China are dangerous as is presented in my YouTube playlist

"You just do not know when to quit.


Section of the S 1660 Congress ACT on Formaldehyde: 
"ATSM testing required for this ACT does NOT recognize deconstructive testing""


In regards to this, the particular section you quoted strictly applies to composite wood products which includes
particleboard, medium density fiberboard and hardwood plywood.


It does NOT apply to finished goods. A finished good containing a composite wood product must contain a
complying composite wood product. Otherwise, it is not compliant with the law. The only definite way to
determine that is through a deconstructive test for a finished good. Simple as that.


Clearly you have a misunderstanding here.


Whitney Tilson should be commended for the work that he has done. What is the point of being on the side of
the Chinese who are operating unfairly loading high density fiberboard with high levels of formaldehyde and

making Americans, Canadians and New Zealanders, and others sick with respiratory and neurologic

He and others in this effort to expose this, should be commended.


And yes, people are getting sick from the high levels of formaldehyde in these Chinese HDF floorboards. This
is well known and documented. I have my own experience, and when I read the other experiences, it is
horrifying. Absolutely nobody should be on the side of Lumber Liquidators, Torlys and others who are involved
importing high formaldehyde/VOC floorboards from China and supplying them to customers.

Incorrect. The only definite way to determine that is by testing the core before they're made into the finished
good!

Tilson wrote this not for us to read but to scare the safety board who is doing formaldehyde inspection on LL. He
wants them to do the exact same tests that he did. He tries to tell them his knowledge of testing. He knows that the
law suit is coming to him. He is preparing for the worst. In order for 60M and Tilson to know the manufacturers in
China to frame LL, I think there must be an insider from LL. Otherwise, how did they know where to go? If Tilson

then proceeds to saw it to pieces.

Tilson says he doesn't read the message boards for his articles. Based on the decreasing number of comments with
each successive article, it appears that readers are losing interest in Tilson's articles and not posting comments. Win -

In the summary for this article there is a revealing point: there are no federal standards for formaldehyde levels in the
air.


If there are no federal standards, lawsuits will have little or no basis.


Also, the 60 minutes tests were not done to test formaldehyde in the air.  
Isn't this thesis falling apart? Is there a thesis here at all?

I am sure Whitney is covering his shorts every time it drops below $33.00.i am sure he becomes nervous every time it
stays above 33. I hope he will hold his shorts until April 29 when LL announces their quarterly earnings. Every
financial website has exaggerated LL situation such as the results of testing and the effect on LL sales since the
barrage of negative articles. Whitney is probably building his long position as he speaks.

SA please start showing some unbiased factual articles on LL. On the CARB website it does say that deconstructive
testing is required on finished laminated products but with only 5% of unfinished edges and finished product exposed.
SA has supported Whitney Tilton to the point that their staff must also be shorting LL. It is also amazing no other
sellers of laminate flooring were tested using the same incorrect methods.

Author’s reply »  Question:


Ivan Gault 
April 16 at 9:29am 
Quick question.


The test by 60 minutes were done on flooring that had been deconstructed or stripped of their top layer that acts as a
sealant. If standards are for indoor air quality then isn't this an apples and oranges comparison? Wouldn't the
appropriate test be to install this flooring in a room and monitor the formaldehyde levels in the air?


I appreciate that this is nothing but LL's argument, but if I'm not mistaken all of the standards you quote are for room
air concentrations. I'm not trying to bolster the bull case or defend LL, just trying to be impartial when looking at the
data. I personally believe using illegally harvested Russian lumber is a greater crime.


My reply:


60 Minutes commissioned two types of tests: a chamber test and an emissions test. The former is what CARB calls
for: take a piece of laminate, sand off the outer layer, and see how much formaldehyde is being emitted by the core
(MDF), as the 0.11 CARB standard is for the MDF.


The latter is what you're talking about: "install this flooring in a room and monitor the formaldehyde levels in the air."
60 Minutes commissioned three of these tests, the results of which I analyzed in yesterday's article.


Best regards,


Whitney

It's worth pointing out that in this article and his response, Mr. Tilson seemingly deliberately avoided the use of
the term "deconstruction test", which was a major issue against his short thesis and the 60Minutes/GCM
report, as CPSC had sided with LL and agreed that such test was non-realistic.


But perhaps more importantly, Mr. Tilson failed to realized that his biggest stake in the LL trade is not his
(comparatively large) short position on LL, but his reputation, as he's really more of a media pundit, than an
investor/hedge fund manager.


If anyone noticed, his latest attack, no longer has immediate negative impact on LL stock price. In my opinion,
he should be more concern about the public's disregarding of his input, and viewing his work as gossip

well
As noted above the testing is pretty conclusive. others including R james also performed their testing- the results
matched the results of the 60min testing, yet the chamber testing did not(however this was only done on 2 samples).
Further LL attacked the fact that 60 min chamber test was a small chamber and that the product is sealed, when it
doesn't matter as it can leach


A lot of bulls here thinking there is no issue when there is. This is not a product i would ever want in my home. the

Denali, 
I do not know how much Tilson is paying you to defend him but twisting my words does not help you IMO.


When I say 60 minutes deconstructed the wood, I think everyone knows that Anderson Cooper did not personally
deconstructed the wood.


As Far as ATSM, I did not want to bore everyone here as the post was long enough. If you go to the ATSM document
required by the ACT, it clearly states that it tests finished products as it is used by the consumer. I do not know how
many consumers do you know that set out to physically destroy their flooring on a daily basis but I bet the answer is
none.


It was funny to listen to the business news this morning as Phillip Morris reported a large profit on their tobacco
products. One cigarette will expose a person to more formaldehyde than living in a 3000 sq home covered with
laminate wood for 300 years.  
I am tired of folks like you scaring the masses for really no reason at all but greed. 
So the installer that smokes 10 cigarettes while installing the laminate, should not be worried about the formaldehyde
released from the laminate ( I know not all installers smoke).

You say "you are tired of folks scaring the masses for no reason." Well, I have to say "I'am tired of folks
having little or no concern for the people who are chemical sensitive, have asthma or children that crawl and
play on this flooring that contains a Urea Formaldehyde adhesive." Some people may have no reaction while
others can have severe and potentially life threatening responses to the exposure! This is the reason
regulations are put into place......not just for you, but for everyone! Point is....this flooring can be made without
using Urea Formaldehyde and the only reason they don't make it NAUF is the cost! To compare one
carcinogen to another is totally lame IMO, being they are both "carcinogens!" It's like saying "two wrongs
make a right!" Fact is, neither is good for you and if we can limit the amounts of formaldehyde, especially in

the closed environment of our homes, why not do it? Again,....the answer is cost! So, we have manufactures
who are putting their profit margins ahead of the consumers health. And yes, I know about all the other
products that contain formaldehyde so please don't start comparing carcinogens.....the point is we need to
limit our intake! Flooring is not a small toy or a piece of furniture.....some people have installed this throughout
their home! Imagine an entire home with this flooring when it was first installed off gassing and then being
Chemical sensitive or having asthma! There is a reason every regulator lists the "risks." Not because there
aren't any....it's because "there are risks."


16 Apr 2015, 01:45 PM


DenaliOcean
Whitney Tilson is not paying me anything. My interest in the subject is I have been personally harmed by toxic
HDF core floorboards with high levels of formaldehyde out of China and they were mislabeled.


This past Friday we received confirmation of that from the same laboratory used by 60 Minutes, HPVA
Laboratories in Virginia. These boards were not supplied by Lumber Liquidators but by Torlys Canada. So
now Torlys is also involved in the same mislabeling and some customers are being harmed by this. So this is
not merely a small technical compliance issue. It is serious.


In regards to: 
"If you go to the ATSM document required by the ACT, it clearly states that it tests finished products as it is
used by the consumer. "


Although US law makes reference to a particular testing standard, does not mean that the testing standard
can override US law. When the law makes reference to a particular standard, it is meant to apply only to the
composite wood product itself and not the finished good.


The US law is very clear on this:


"‘‘TITLE VI—FORMALDEHYDE STANDARDS FOR COMPOSITE WOOD PRODUCTS


‘‘(4) APPLICABILITY.—The formaldehyde emission standard  
referred to in paragraph (1) shall apply regardless of whether  
an applicable hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard,  
or particleboard is—  
‘‘(A) in the form of an unfinished panel; or  
‘‘(B) incorporated into a finished good. "


What this means is that the core MDF board must comply with the law if it is going to be incorporated into a
finished good. The Lumber Liquidators and Torlys Chinese MDF/HDF core boards do not comply.


"So the installer that smokes 10 cigarettes while installing the laminate, should not be worried about the
formaldehyde released from the laminate ".


I would tend to agree, but that does not mean that the floor is going to be safe for the occupants of a home
especially if they are there 24 hours a day and the floorboards have high levels of formaldehyde. Neither
cigarettes or MDF with high levels of formaldehyde are safe.

Whitney, 
Your LL short does not seem like a sure thing. Why not go for companies whose moat is eroding quickly? Those are
obvious shorts. Examples:


1. In Canada NFLX is eating away cable subscribers, and the economy is quietly slowing, which means lower ads.
Shorts: RCI and BCE.


2. The ALU NOK 'merger' is suspect. Surely there's an arbitrage opportunity there?


3. Something bearish is going on in the semiconductor space. Why not short firms saddled in excess inventory,
eroding pricing power?


16 Apr 2015, 12:23 PM

i think the chance for ll to beat this case is pretty slim, there's good odds here and im sure theres a personal
reason as well. i think tilson has better things to spend time on than joke canadian companies like rci,bce(in a
market of 30mil people where every major us corp runs from)- first off these business are a monopoly so even
if they loose subscribers people still need their service to watch nflx. alu nok was all speculation nothing to do
there. ll is a better opportunity until this bull market comes to an end


16 Apr 2015, 11:45 PM

Relevant points @well. BCE just got sued for breaking privacy laws ( http://seekingalpha.co... )


Also, the mere threat of any american cable/telco coming to canada and these firms will fall hard and fast.


Look at what another HF did when he got into CP. Did real activist work and CP is up sharply.


Back on LL, I don't think this is a short.

why have you not also addressed the national testing standards that will soon be enacted (more than likely from this
LL example) ? no national standard could or would use a deconstruction methodology as there are too many
compressed wood products on the market today. Deconstruction as a measure, would grind these companies to a
halt (literally).


meanwhile, I see that Mr. Tilson is speaking at a LL litigation conference in Minneapolis next month.

of course no mention of the raymond james test that show all the laminates were fine on a finished products basis....

17 Apr 2015, 01:43 AM


well
it would be nice to see more results from more sources, perhaps from a home owner who submits to a lab
that has nothing to do with LL/ or even run European testing on it. The r james test showed what 60 min
showed, except for the small chamber test (but again its hard to draw a line from only 2 samples) that's why
there's no mention. Further LL criticized the small chamber test that was done by both rj and 60min. There is
too much confusion at the moment- but soon enough , consumers have the right to know eventually the real
results will come out unless those sources are bribed by LL just like the rest of them. I guess this is what you
get when you cheap out on floor, at least there should have been labellng, but if this was my flooring i would
really be concerned , I don't think i would take ll's word for it sitting around getting sick- its only common
sence that a product 7x of glue in it will leach eventually- i would rip the stuff out and demand a refund

If Whitney perturbs you, I would suggest not reading his posts. At this point, it doesn't matter what he writes. His
comments and opinions on LL are irrelevant. Cats already out of the bag. LL is poorly ran company who has made
several bad decisions. Decisions I'm sure they thought they could get away with. Decisions that also help them
increase their margins and drive their stock price to 120. Problem is they got caught. Caught harvesting wood from
Siberia and caught buying from the cheapest sources they could find in China. Most of their products are junk even if
it's compliant. To top it all off, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Lynch have done a terrible job defending their company from these
accusations. Blast Whitney all you want. It doesn't change the fact LL is a terrible investment now and going forward.

April 16 at 2:31pm 
Hi Whitney,


Thank you for sharing all of your work on LL. I've really appreciated reading all your articles.


Obviously I don't know the situation as well as you do, but I try to bring my own framework to all ideas. Basically, I'm
always looking for the "sure thing" and trying to figure out how I could lose money.


After listening to Elliot Kaye's press statement, it seems they will do the tests as soon as possible and results should
be out within months and not years. So naturally I thought about buying put options. But the problem is I'm not sure
the stock will collapse further than the already big drop. The only thing that seems pretty certain is that something big
will happen: either the stock will drop further or will go back up if things blow over.


My first question is: How can you be so sure the stock is going to zero? I remember many years ago the Sherwin-
Williams paint scandal and that company escaped relatively unscathed despite knowingly selling harmful products to
their customers. At the time, lots of people were saying the company was finished, but, as history has shown, these
situations are unpredictable and drag out for a long time.


Also, the Chinese laminate is about 10% of LL's sales which doesn't seem like enough to take down a company. I
understand this could just be the tip of the iceberg of their shady practices (ie government raid in 2013), but I don't
know for sure.


My second question is: Why continue to short the stock when you could limit your risk with options? Is this because of
liquidity as there probably aren't enough options for you to take a large enough position?


Thank you for any response,


-theo

Hi Theo,


I’m not sure the stock is going to zero. I think it’s possible though – especially if the company continues to act in a
reckless and irresponsible way. Every day that goes by in which they continue to sell the Chinese-made laminate,
when they (and everyone else) knows it’s dangerous, while claiming it’s “100% safe”, increases the odds of this.


As I wrote in my article on 4/8, Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling Toxic Laminate? (all 13 articles I’ve
published are posted at: http://bit.ly/1CpMeYd), the key will be whether evidence emerges that they KNEW they were
poisoning their own customers.


10% of sales is still ~$100 million/year – and they’ve been doing this for many years I believe. That’s a lot of false
advertising and customers suffering symptoms from formaldehyde exposure.


Lastly, I never use options. It’s hard enough to be right about a stock, much less also be right on the timing.


Best regards,


Whitney
