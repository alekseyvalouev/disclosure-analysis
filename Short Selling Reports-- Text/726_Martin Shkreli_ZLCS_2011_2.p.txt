Closing Zalicus Short Position: A Lesson In Getting The Timing Right
Nov. 9, 2011 5:01 AM ET4 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


I am closing my recommendation to short Zalicus (ZLCS), which was issued on July 6th,
when the stock traded at 2.60. The stock closed at 1.16, -55% from my short
recommendation. It's important to annualize your returns when you analyze your returns in
trades. This is useful because it reminds you that time from entry to exit is one of the most
important (and overlooked) variables in trading. I've worked at funds that tried to make
money in 1 day, 1 month and 1 year timeframes. There is no "right" or "wrong" but any
experienced investor knows how to calculate IRR. A 55% gain in 4 months annualizes to a
272% gain. In other words, if you exited my Zalicus recommendation and entered into
another 4 month 55% gain, and yet another one, you would make 272% in one year, or
nearly 4x your money.


I belabor this point because it's vital to compounding money quickly. Sticking with a stock
forever is very rarely a great idea, unless it's profoundly undervalued or has a spectacular
management team (rare things in our industry!).


Anyway, Zalicus has been pitiful. Synavive is still worthless and Exalgo is generating
limited royalty revenues. The company is running out of cash and I am NOT
recommending an investment in it. I'm sure it will continue to trend lower, but the
risk/reward isn't good enough for me and the return this far has been spectacular.


For those of you who are curious, (short) Mesoblast (MBLTY.PK) is my best idea at the
moment. I'm convinced Mesoblast stock will fall 50%+.


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.

Strange that Martin is talking about RII. look at ur RII on BMRN. At 28/29 u mentioned target of 50 or 100. It is still at
31, after 7to 8 months. Great RII. Look who is talking about RII.

Martin, Also look at your track record in Chelsea therapeutics (CHTP). You went long at 5.50 in july 2011 and today it
is languishing at 4.75. Calculate your IRR after 5 months. Pathetic 15% negative returns) You will never tell
whether/when you closed your position, inspite of people asking if you closed ur position. You will only write after the
stock moves in ur favor.


Cheapster Martin!!
