Flotek: a plea for accuracy
This post had a material impact on the stock: the company admi�ed to most the
important allega�ons in this post and the stock halved. My view is that there is much
more to do. Details in the post script.  
 
=========== 


Warning: this is a really gonzo story. We tried to check the data and use the
main marke�ng tool for a billion dollar company. 


None of it worked out. The data looks like it was made up or at least
systema�cally rigged. The marke�ng tool (an iPad app) simply crashes and is
non-func�onal. 


We can't tell whether the whole company is this suspect - but this is as non-
sensical as anything we have seen on Wall Street. The closest comparable on
this blog was Universal Travel Group, a stock which is now delisted and where
the principals se�led civil fraud charges.


If you own the stock you must work this to the end. Try to reproduce our
results. If this is the whole story this stock will trade with a low single digit
handle or lower.


 
John W. Chisholm is a fan of accuracy. Demands it, even. As the CEO of Flotek Industries,
Inc., (NYSE:FTK) he requires factual, mathema�cal accuracy.
 
How do I know? Because Chisholm devoted a bit of �me on the recent 3Q conference
call to express his apparent displeasure with a certain unnamed analyst who, it seems,
had chosen a wayward path:
 


Before I turn the call over to Rob Schmitz to provide addi�onal financial review, I
want to take a minute to discuss an issue of interest to all Flotek investors of which
all of us around this table today are. We appreciate the though�ul work and effort
that many of the analysts who cover Flotek provide and we understand how
difficult the economic analysis of a company like Flotek will be, especially in an
environment with such high levels of uncertainty. That said, the challenges in the
analysis business also create challenges for companies like Flotek, especially when
one erroneous es�mate can have such a dispropor�onate impact on consensus
numbers which is what happened in the third quarter.
 
Removing just that one es�mate from the mix provides a more cogent view of
consensus thinking and makes Flotek's third quarter results not only at or near the
top of the service sector, but slightly ahead of mainstream consensus. Please
understand, we appreciate the effort that goes into complete and accurate
coverage of our Company and have no interest in a debate over valua�on and
ra�ng calls that are based on factual and accurate informa�on. That is what makes
the US public market so robust.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 2/22


 
However, accurate-based mathema�cs, factual statements that don't involve blind
conjecture or guesses as to material facts such as customers or key chemistry
performance and correct statements of fact about items such as the current status
of credit agreements and the like that can easily be located in our public filings
seem like basic tenants of objec�ve, thorough securi�es research. While we have
li�le control over what is published in today's world, I would say we welcome firms
and analysts that have an interest in factual, construc�ve evalua�on and we'll feel
compelled going forward to men�on those who appear to poten�ally [have]
agendas other than objec�ve securi�es analysis and cri�que.


 
We share Mr Chisholm's interest in “factual, construc�ve evalua�on.”
 
Flotek, the Houston-based company he heads, supplies chemicals and produc�on
equipment to the energy industry. The market for those products looks a li�le bleak at the
moment. However Flotek claim excep�on due to special products and special technology.
They have grown regardless. Flotek is a beacon in these harsh �mes.
 
Flotek is keen to tell you how they did it. On 11 September in New York it gave the
company's fi�h investor presenta�on since mid-August, and again it gave the story. 
 
The a�rac�on of the stock (and the miracle of Flotek's business resilience) comes from
Flotek’s citrus-based “complex nano-fluid” (“CnF”) surfactants. These, they say, boost the
produc�on of oil and gas from hydraulic fracturing of exis�ng and newly-completed wells.  
 
Here’s John Chisholm describing it to Jim Cramer in February 2015: 
 
 


 
 
In recent quarters (and in the video) the company has highlighted FracMax, an iPad app
created as a sales tool to demonstrate the complex nano-fluids’ capabili�es.
 
Chisholm has been lavish in his praise for FracMax, assigning it almost sole credit for the
Company’s industry-downturn-defying increases in chemical sales. At a Barclays
conference on 10 September, Chisholm stated (p. 3):
 


While like other companies with an energe�c focus, we are not immune to the
ac�vity swings resul�ng from powerful commodity price cycles. Our energy
chemistry business, for example con�nues to grow, even as comple�on ac�vity
weakens. This anomalous and unprecedented growth is the result of con�nued
market penetra�on and the power of FracMax, our proprietary data analysis and

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 3/22


visualiza�on so�ware which shows, using producers' own empirical data, the
compelling economic benefits of our customized chemistry.
 
Moreover, we do not expect that growth to slow. Even in this more challenging
environment, as data suppor�ng the efficacy of our technologies provide ample
opportuni�es for progress as explora�on and produc�on companies understand
that the op�mal well results only when they come and put Flotek in their wells.


 
The Company’s SEC filings have been similarly kind to FracMax. Last year’s 10-K noted
(p.24-25):
 


Energy Chemical Technologies revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased…
33.8%...primarily due to the increased sales of stimulation chemical additives, largely the
result of the introduction of the Company’s proprietary, patent-pending FracMax™ software
which statistically demonstrates the positive production and economic impact of using
Flotek’s CnF® chemistries in unconventional well completions. The FracMaxTM software has
led to a record number of new validation projects and accelerated commercial acceptance of
the Company’s CnF® completion chemistries.


 
During the 11 September presenta�on, Chisholm showed a video (seen below) that
proclaimed:


 
It's more impac�ul and convenient than ever to experience the real-world benefit
of CnF.  An innova�on that's revolu�onizing an industry by truly making a
difference. You can touch it, you can see it, and now, you can believe it. Your data
has become intelligent in a way never imagined. The future is here.


 
Have a look: 
 
 


  
 
Put simply, FracMax ma�ers to Flotek. And precision ma�ers to FracMax.
 
And as any true fan of mathema�cal precision knows, the proof is in the showing, not the
telling. So Chisholm demonstrates the analysis Flotek hopes poten�al customers will
perform using FracMax.  
 
Let's go through one of his presenta�ons and check the data. 
 
Chisholm compares four wells in Texas: one that used CnF in its comple�on (“Molnoskey
1H”) and three nearby wells that did not (“Targac 1H,” “Gillespie 1H,” and “Berger 1H”).

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Flotek: a plea for accuracy


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 4/22


According to Flotek, the FracMax app visualizes data derived from public sources, such
as FracFocus.org (“FracFocus”) and state oil and gas produc�on records.  Slide #50
from February’s investor day presenta�on gives a bit more detail (highligh�ng added):


 
 
FracFocus.org is a centralized database that collects self-reported informa�on on the
chemicals used by energy companies in hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”). FracFocus’s data
is available in a machine-readable format, so with effort anybody—not just Flotek—can
reproduce FracMax-style analysis, provided that the chemical data is joined to produc�on
data by a common industry iden�fier such as an API number.
 
For the wells Chisholm highlighted in the presenta�on, produc�on data comes from
the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”), which collects informa�on on Texas energy
produc�on. Chisholm emphasized the independence of the data he presented on 11
September, stressing that it had been reported directly to FracFocus and the Texas RRC
and was “un-adjusted” (Slide 34, highligh�ng added).
 


 
 
Chisholm could hardly have declaimed the data’s provenance more loudly. For instance,
Chisholm took a shot at cri�cs at 46:35 in the replay:
 


It was reported three or four weeks ago in a comment that we claim performance
of CnF. That's not right. We report the performance, and there's a big difference.
We don't create the data, we allow the visualiza�on of the data in a way that
people have never seen before. [emphasis in original]


 
Chisholm again proclaimed the data’s bona fides (Source: 1:01:53 in linked video):

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 5/22


That's why the data backchecks and validates. This is data coming right from the
Texas Railroad Commission. Forget about FracMax. Just forget about it completely.
That's data that comes right from the Texas Railroad Commission.


 
Let’s have a look.
 
The four proximate wells Chisholm highlighted were:
 


Slide #   API # TX Lease# Well Name Operator
58, 59 42-285-33654 10702 Targac 1H Sabine Oil & Gas LLC
60, 61 42-285-33673 10811 Gillespie 1H Sabine Oil & Gas LLC
62, 63 42-285-33756 10920 Molnoskey 1H (CnF) Sabine Oil & Gas LLC
64, 65 42-285-33802 10972 Berger Unit 1H Devon Energy Corp


 
Targac 1H
 
Targac 1H from Sabine Oil & Gas (API#: 42-285-33654) was selected for its loca�on within
four miles of the CnF-using Molnoskey 1H (see map on slide 58). Targac, said Chisholm, is
an example of a large, expensive well that used substan�al amounts of water.
 
Slide 59 shows produc�on and addi�ve data from FracMax:
 


 
 
Chisholm narrated at 1:07:20 in the replay: 


 
So that par�cular well there, here's what we want you to focus on. 11 million
gallons were pumped in that frack job. Here's the ini�al produc�on: eight
thousand eight hundred barrels in the first month, no CnF in that well. 'Kay? 11
million gallons, 8800 barrels.


 
The RRC reports produc�on data by RRC ID#, to which well API#s directly correspond for
the four wells of concern to us. So first we look up the RRC ID using the API #:

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 6/22


 
 
Using the RRC’s query tool, we lookup the RRC produc�on data for lease ID# 10702.  
 
Let’s compare the numbers.
 
The table below shows, by month, the produc�on data for oil and gas from Targac 1H. The
first column under each of Oil and Gas headings, labeled “FTK – FracMax,” reproduces the
numbers as shown on Chisholm’s slide above that was presented to investors. The middle
column under each of the Oil and Gas headings, labeled “Texas RRC” shows
the original produc�on data (not disposi�on) as reported by the Texas RRC and
reproduced in full above. The final column under each of the Oil and Gas headings simply
divides the FracMax number into the Texas RRC number, stated as a percentage. 
 
 


 
 
Eagle-eyed readers—who no doubt share our commitment to correctness—will note
several problems here.  
 
 


The produc�on data shown on Chisholm’s slide does not match what was
reported to the RRC. 





The data appears to have been adjusted, as the numbers shown on the
FracMax slide total only 60% of the oil produc�on reported to the RRC and
50% of the gas.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Flotek: a plea for accuracy


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 7/22


The first month’s oil produc�on was not 8900 barrels in December 2013, but
17,761 in November 2013. 


 
Chisholm it seems understated produc�on data for the well that contained none of
Flotek's special "complex nano-fluid".  
 
We gave John Chisholm the benefit of the doubt. We thought this could be a coding or
data entry or a simple copy-paste error.  
 
Alas we found that this is a pa�ern rather than isolated error.
 
Gillespie 1H
 
Chisholm next presented the Gillespie 1H well (API# 42-285-33673), also from Sabine Oil
and Gas, located nearby (see slide 60).
 
At 1:07:39 in the replay, Chisholm describes Gillespie 1H as a “clone” of the Targac 1H
well, as Sabine used a similar set of chemicals:
 


The operator, Sabine, then went and decided they needed to reduce the size of
their jobs. And that's this well right here that they used a clone with. Focus in on
this. They reduced the size of the job from 11 million gallons to eight; produc�on
went down, 5800 barrels instead of 8800.


 
Slide 61, reproduced below, shows the produc�on reported by FracMax:
 


 
 
As before, we use the API#, 42-285-33673, to look up the Texas RRC ID #, which is 10811.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 8/22


 
 
A�er retrieving the produc�on data using ID # 10811, we find that Gillespie has the same
undisclosed adjustment as Targac. Using the same table as we did for Targac, we compare
the FracMax numbers from Flotek’s slide and the original RRC data. 
 
 


 
 
Once again, the numbers don’t match. Chisholm correctly notes that both water use and
produc�on at Gillespie 1H were lower than at Targac 1H.  
 
But what he didn’t say was that his numbers did not match the official data from the Texas
Railroad Commission: produc�on was both a month earlier (May, not June) and
substan�ally higher than he claimed.
 
Molnoskey 1H
 
The Molnoskey 1H well, also by Sabine Oil & Gas, is the punchline of Chisholm’s
presenta�on of well comparisons using FracMax screenshots. This is the well that enjoyed
the benefit (and pleasing citrus odour) of Flotek’s complex nano-fluids, and the other
wells were selected for comparison because they are near Molnoskey (slide 62).
 
Slide 63 shows the addi�ves and produc�on data as reported by FracMax:

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 9/22


 
 
Chisholm noted Flotek's complex nano-fluid sold under the trade name “Super S�m 120,”
and highlighted one ingredient, citrus terpenes. Chisholm then made the key, direct
comparison between Molnoskey and Targac, the first well presented. At 1:08:04 in the
replay, he stated:
 


They [Sabine] then came to us and said, we're going to reduce it even further, in
fact they called these wells “smurf” wells. And we're gonna run complex nano-
fluid.
 
Focus here on this. Volume six million gallons versus the original one [Targac] of
over 11. Produc�on 12.5 thousand gallons in the first month versus eight, so the
produc�on's up 50%, the fluid's down 50%, here's complex nano-fluid, in fact it's
Super S�m 120, remember FDP? Super-s�m in this case they happen to put citrus
terpene in there.


 
This is the key to Flotek’s claims of the value of CnF and its FracMax app. Given our
experience so far, we should probably double check the numbers. We use API #42-285-
33756 to retrieve the Texas RRC ID# of 10920.
 


 
 
But this �me the RRC produc�on data for ID# 10920 holds a surprise: while the first
month was again omi�ed, it hasn’t otherwise been adjusted at all. In other words, only for
the well with CnF did Flotek report (mostly) the original, unadjusted RRC numbers:

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 10/22


 
 
John Chisholm fails to meet his own "accuracy" standard 
 
Not only were Flotek and Chisholm’s repeated insistences that the data is “as reported by
the operator” incorrect, but the adjustments we have seen ARE consistently favorable to
the Company’s CnF well and detrimental to the non-CnF wells.  
 
Mistakes happen, though they undermine the many declara�ons of FracMax’s sta�s�cal
robustness.  
 
Given this pa�ern of adjustments we can’t help but wonder if these divergences are, in
fact, mere mistakes. It is just too suspicious to consistently understate the results from
wells that did not use their product. 
 
Starker problems 
 
Comparing the adjusted and unadjusted data for Molnoskey (CnF) and Targac (no CnF)
reveals a starker problem: for at least some months, when the oil produc�on is reported
without Flotek’s altera�ons, the CnF-containing well performed worse, not be�er. 
 
The table below compares monthly oil produc�on in barrels, star�ng with the first month,
of Targac and Molnoskey, the two wells Chisholm compared above. Under the heading for
each well, there are three columns: Flotek’s numbers from its FracMax slide, the Texas
RRC numbers, and Flotek’s numbers divided by the Texas #s shown as a percentage. (This
data is the same as shown in each well’s respec�ve comparison tables above.)
 
As Chisholm’s claim was that Molnoskey produced more oil than Targac with less water—
thanks, he implies, to CnF—the final two columns check that claim using the original
data.  
 
Under the heading “Diff in Produc�on (Mol. – Targ.),” we subtract the two sets of reported
numbers. First, we show Flotek’s numbers for Molnoskey – Targac, for the same month of
produc�on. These show an increase, as Chisholm stated. But when we use
the original Texas RRC numbers, in the rightmost column below, we find that, for at least
some months, Targac (no CnF) outperformed Molnoskey (CnF).

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 11/22


 
 
Sure many factors affect produc�on (eg geology, how much water and sand and maybe
acid are pumped into wells and maybe even the surfactants use).  
 
Our aim is not to prove that CnF makes no difference. To do that we would need a large
sample set. Rather we point out that on John Chisholm's data (a�er taking out the errors)
it is impossible to conclude that Flotek's complex nano-fluids do anything.
 
We believe in "accuracy" but there ain't none here. 
 
Like the wayward analyst (with apologies to James 1:3), the tes�ng of our faith in accuracy
produces perseverance.   
 
So let’s look at the final well.
 
Berger 1H
 
The final well Chisholm highlighted was the Berger 1H Unit from Devon Energy, a nearby
well (slide 64) that he told us had no CnF. A screenshot from FracMax reports Berger’s
addi�ves and produc�on (slide 65):
 


 
 
Chisholm narrated at 1:08:43 in the replay:
 


Wanted to show you the well right next door to that CnF well was with...by
Devon.  Uh...amount of fluid 5.9 million, less than half the produc�on. Right next
door. To the well that had CnF in it, with a similar amount of fluid in the frack job.
This type of data analysis was absolutely [sic] no way Flotek had access to it '�ll we
invented FracMax. Absolutely no one else in the industry has it.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Flotek: a plea for accuracy


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 12/22


 
Using the API#42-285-33802, we retrieve its RRC Lease ID#10972: 
 
 


 
 
As above, we look up the produc�on data for Berger from the RRC using ID# 10972. Once
again, Flotek’s reported produc�on data from FracMax does not match the RRC’s, as the
by-now-familiar table below shows: 
 
 


 
 
Where before Flotek omi�ed the first month of produc�on (usually the largest), in this
case they have omi�ed the first two months of September and October 2014, as well as
the most recently reported month, June 2015. And we find again the same undisclosed
altera�on of the RRC’s data, as FracMax displays only 60% of the RRC’s number for oil and
50% for gas.
 
Chisholm compared Berger and Molnoskey directly, as the two wells are nearby and used
a similar amount of water, but only Molnoskey contained CnF. Berger, Chisholm said, had
“less than half the produc�on,” presumably intending for his investor audience to
conclude that CnF made the difference. While Molnoskey clearly produced more oil in its
first 10 months, the difference is far less stark once the full RRC produc�on numbers—
including the missing months—are taken into account. 
 
The size of the claimed Flotek data base
 
Ul�mately, of the 9,800 wells Chisholm claims have used CnF (replay at 45:48), Flotek
picked these to compare. They were chosen deliberately. If this is management’s “best
foot forward” we wonder how FracMax will persuade sophis�cated reservoir engineers
who must build models incorpora�ng produc�on cost, geological complexity, etc., while
maintaining sta�s�cal robustness.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 13/22


It’s worth quo�ng Chisholm’s statement at 45:48 in the replay in full:  
 
 


“[W]hat you'll see today is on a FracMax instance that has 98 thousand wells.
Not 98. Not 980. Not 9000. Ninety-eight thousand wells in the United States
that we have all categorized based on what went in and what the produc�on
is. And 10% of it has CnF in it. And any sta�s�cian will tell you that's enough
of a database that you can make algorithmic, sta�s�c inferences as to what
the economic impact is on a dataset that big.” [emphasis in original]


So we thought we might test the whole data base. And it was all meant to be in their
FracMax app all ready for your ipad. 
 
So we downloaded an app claiming to be FracMax. 
 
We just can’t make it work and we tried with a brand new ipad just to test compatability.
 
Trying the FracMax App (?)
 
A version of what claims to be FracMax is available in the Apple iTunes Store under the
name “Flotek Max.” Released on 17 February 2015, the descrip�on of the app fits the
public descrip�ons of FracMax: 


 
 A quick but important caveat: we cannot know for certain if this is the app Chisholm
demonstrated or the app used by Flotek’s sales force. It is en�rely possible—likely, even
—that another version of FracMax exists. That said, our reading Apple's policies make it
unlikely that a parallel private app exists. 
 
With that caveat out of the way, we do what we can to try to use the app.  
 
We find the same Flotek applica�on pictured in the consumer app store above:

Clicking on the link leads us to the same page as before, except with “Volume Purchase
Program” as the header:
 
 


 
 
(Note the sec�on on “Managed Distribu�on” on the webpage above.  It indicates that free
apps are only available in bulk when using a “Mobile Data Management” solu�on, which
implies control over the end user’s iPad.  This form of distribu�on would be more
common within a single enterprise whose mobile devices are managed centrally.)
 
Anyway, we downloaded the iTunes Store applica�on—the first one shown, from
the consumer app store—and tried to run it on two separate iPads, each running the
latest version of iOS (one an iPad 4th Genera�on the other an iPad Mini 4).
 
Here’s what happened when we tried it, from the ini�al download onwards - note that
this is a very boring video showing you what happened right to the point where the
ipad crashed:

On neither iPad we tried did the applica�on work. First, it asked for access to the
camera, for what purpose we do not know. Next, it simply displayed a black screen with
a set of red bubbles, much like the screenshot of the business card in the app store
images above—except without any discernable image in the background. No amount of
tapping or dragging or swiping or pinching could persuade it to do anything. 
 
We would love if other readers could try to load the app. At last tes�ng it crashed both
our ipads. 
 
This is curious as Flotek tells us that this app is responsible for the fantas�c recent sales
performance. (Also curious is the claim in the app store descrip�on that the data is
updated weekly; as the images show, the latest version of the app was released on 17
February 2015.)
 
As we can’t run FracMax—or an app from Flotek claiming to be FracMax, anyway—
accuracy-minded investors like us can’t check other wells. It would be fascina�ng if Mr
Chisholm's faulty data is repeated over the whole United States. That would be deeply
"curious". 
 
And we like a good stock puzzle - especially one where the management seem to make it
up. 
 
 
 
 
 
John 
 
And a side note to Mr Chisholm.  
 
Adlai Stevenson suggests that “Accuracy is to a newspaper what virtue is to a lady, but a
newspaper can always print a retrac�on.” 
 
Can we expect a retrac�on or is Flotek truly without virtue?

The company put out a press release that admi�ed to most the key issues in this blog

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 16/22


post. The press release is repeated here. 
 


Flotek has carefully reviewed a recent report regarding the validity of the data
from the Company's FracMax® database by analyzing data from a small
subset of wells in FracMax®.  The analysis suggests the produc�on data
presented by Flotek – for three of the wells analyzed – were misinterpreted
by Flotek and understated the produc�on of those wells. 


"We take any conten�on of errors in our data, processes and analysis very
seriously," said John Chisholm, Chairman, President and Chief Execu�ve
Officer of Flotek. "We appreciate the thorough analysis provided in the report
and are using this cri�que as well as others to improve our FracMax®
applica�on to ensure both the validity and reliability of the underlying data as
well as the accuracy of the analy�cal processes." 


As a result of our ini�al review of the report we have concluded that the
FracMax® database – partly a result of third party data used by Flotek –
iden�fied the three wells in ques�on to be contained in units with mul�ple
wells (the state of Texas organizes produc�on repor�ng by units, or leases,
that report total produc�on in the aggregate).  The FracMax® applica�on uses
algorithms to assign produc�on to individual wells within mul�ple well units.
In this case, the report contends that the wells in ques�on were on single-
well units and, as a result, 100% of the produc�on from those units should be
assigned to the iden�fied wells. A�er review of the report, data from the
Texas Railroad Commission as well as other third-party data providers, it
appears that the wells in ques�on are single-well units. 


While the adjustment does impact the magnitude of the outperformance of
the well completed using CnF® when compared to the non-CnF® treated
wells, it does not, the Company believes, change the conclusion that the CnF®
well outperformed the non-CnF® wells, especially when normalized for the
length of the lateral comple�on zone. 
"While we are concerned by the uninten�onal data and processing error that
led to this uni�za�on miscalcula�on and are taking aggressive steps to ensure
this process is immediately corrected, our analysis of the wells in ques�on
concludes the use of CnF® improved produc�vity when compared to the
neighboring wells that did not use CnF® in the comple�on process," said
Chisholm. "Moreover, Sabine Oil & Gas – the operator of three of the wells in
ques�on – con�nues to use CnF® on its comple�ons, an indica�on that
Sabine's internal data show compelling benefits from the use of Flotek's
Complex nano-Fluids® suite of comple�on chemistries." 


The Company has conducted an ini�al review of the FracMax® database and
has determined that this data and process error does not impact the vast
majority of wells in the database which appear to be uni�zed appropriately
by the so�ware applica�on. "In fact, there were several other wells in the
investor presenta�on that were uni�zed and reported correctly, showing the
benefits of CnF® that were not discussed or referred to in the report," added
Chisholm. 


"While FracMax® is an important tool in the development of new markets for
CnF®, the most important determinant of the success of CnF® is the actual
performance of the Company's comple�on chemistry in the wells of new and
exis�ng clients," said Chisholm. "The growth in valida�ons that result in new
commercial customers is the ul�mate proof of the efficacy of our comple�on
chemistries. Our clients and their experiences – as seen through their own
proprietary produc�on data – are by far the best evidence of the
performance-enhancing nature of CnF®."

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 17/22


Posted by John Hempton at 1:36 AM  


The number of produc�on companies using CnF® in the comple�on process
con�nues to grow with a consistent flow of valida�on projects for operators
of all sizes.


 
A previous press release took issue with my asser�on that the FracMax iPad app did not
work. To quote: 


"In addi�on, as we have noted consistently over the past year, FracMax® is
currently used exclusively by the Flotek team to analyze well and
performance data for our clients," added Chisholm. "The applica�on is not
available outside of Flotek and, as a result, cannot be downloaded without
appropriate creden�als."


I have yet to see any working FracMax app. Moreover I have not seen anyone (such as a
client) using said app. The company now says that the app is en�rely an internal tool.
However this is not how it was represented in the past. Here is a link to the app's website
on Archive.org. 
 
And here is a picture. 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
This is the "innova�ve mobile app where the industry revolu�onising impact of Flotek's
CnF technology is on full display" and we should "prepare to experience what it can do for
yourself". 
 
This is very different from the current asser�on that FrackMax is an internal sales tool
only. 
 
Here is a simple challenge to Flotek management: find a friendly Wall Street Journal
reporter who will report - even in a brief column - that they have experienced it for
themselves. 
 
I do not think it can be done. Without further proof I remain convinced that the
management are simply making it all up.

"Also curious is the claim in the app store description that the data is updated weekly; as
the images show, the latest version of the app was released on 17 February 2015" 
 
There's this thing, it's called the internet, it's where data is transferred between computers
via distributed networks. One of the cool things about this thing the internet, is that if you
want to let people see some new data, you don't have to update your program and put all
the new data in it. You can just write the program once, and then transfer the data over
that cool invention, the internet, and then you have updated data on your 'old' program.
Neat! 
 
For a firm who was so rigorous in thrashing this company, it's pretty astounding you guys
are so clueless about something so basic. I for one would definitely want to make sure
everything I said was extremely rigorous if I was criticizing someone for NOT being the
same. Being super anal on your analysis and then conjecturing like a kindergartner
makes you look like at best hypocrites, at worst bumbling idiots.

Definitely interesting -- the adjustment factors are clearly questionable, and for that
reason alone this looks like an interesting short. 
 
That said, I'm not sure the poor app performance is? In the video you link to (beginning at
2:40) it says, "now U.S. and national oil companies can license a version of the
application customized to them on a FracMax-centric Apple iPad."  
 
Now, maybe the version in the app store (which I'll admit I have not tried) is really
indicative of how terrible the product is, but I think you have to at least consider the
possibility that there is a really wonderful (cooked-books?) version of the app available.

One of the key determinants of horizontal well production is the length of the lateral that is
drilled. Longer laterals are cited as a (the?) key factor for the recent performance of wells
in the Permian at reduced cost. It's curious to me that they would try to compare well
performance without including this data or the number of frac stages. I guess the amount
of fluids/chemicals used is supposed to be a proxy for this but not sure it's a good one.
Another red flag perhaps.

I downloaded and tried the app. My experience was the same as yours. 
 
I note that the robot pictured in the app is similar to, but not quite the same, as the robot
from the Flotek website

Hello John, 
 
I am curious, why did you exclude the Monson Unit 3H well from your review? It is the
first example well they reference in that investor day presentation (page 42). It is a well
that uses an FTK product. 
 
Like the non-Flotek wells you reviewed, the FTK stated production from Monson is
materially lower than the RRC reported production data.  
 
Including Monson, FTK showed results for two FTK related wells (Monson and
Molnoskey) and three non-FTK wells (Targac, Gillespie and Berger) in the section where
they attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of FTK products (they also show
production data for Krudwig later in the presentation). Excluding Molnoskey, all other
wells included in the presentation are shown with less production than the lease-based
data that can be found in the RRC data. 
 
Can you explain why Monson, a FTK-related well, would also be shown production lower
than the RRC data?  
 
I do not have the answer, but I am guessing that there may be some discrepancy

between well-based data and lease-based data (i.e., RRC lease-based production data
may group production from multiple wells within that lease). The main flaw with my guess
is that it would not explain a why a well would constitute a consistent share of RRC lease
data. I would speculate that multiple wells within one lease would be declining at different
rates at any given time and, as such, the share of RRC lease-based production for one
well should change over time.

just a couple of notes: 
 
1. the app may be crashing due to the relatively new iOS you were using, given it was last
updated in march when the new iOS was not out 
 
2. the data being updated weekly does not necessarily mean the app needs to be
updated weekly (date seen on itunes store), it could be updated through the internet
without needing to re-install the app.

Hmmm, statistically what I find troublesome is that the adjustment is always exactly 60%
and 50%.  There's no algorithm at work, it just scaled all the data, except when their CnF
product is involved.  Logically, one of them is erroneous. 
 
Incidentally you probably won't get that app to run on a retail ipad. They likely must
provision it to you. Considering the purported value they may even distribute an iPad to
each user and then centrally manage them all.  The website offers a free demo - maybe
you should just ask for one!

"Similar to the United States, the FracMax architecture will remain proprietary to Flotek
with well studies run for clients through the Company's FracMax analytics subsidiary. The
closed architecture provides for consistency and integrity of the data and processes of the

"Definitely interesting -- the adjustment factors are clearly questionable, and for that
reason alone this looks like an interesting short." 
 
The Texas Railroad Commission is perhaps the worst and the latest reporting of the state
regulators of oil and gas. Often you have to wait several months to get accurate well data. 
 
That being said, I've never seen Texas RRC data which was exactly 60% and exactly
50% different between two points in time. Coincidence? I don't think so.

The main point of the article is if the CEO deliberately lies in presentations, what are the
quality of the financial statements - particularly in an industry where estimates are
important? 
 
Low quality management, low quality financial statements, low quality company.

"Since Sabine is the operator for BOTH of the wells you examined, wouldn't it make

They would have whatever factual data is available since they are the actual operator of

I dunno what this app is, it looks more like a placeholder to me. Pulling it apart it seems to
be based on the Unity engine https://unity3d.com/ generally used for cross platform game
development although I guess it will work for visualisation tasks as well. 
 
I pulled out one of our test iPads running iOS 8.4 and I can get the app to run, it just
shows the view from the camera behind the dots you see in your video. I imagine your
problems are because you are using the latest version of iOS. The probably only version
(1.0) of this app was released on Feb 27, 2015 and has not been updated since, this
seems unlikely to be an app used in any way. I'm kinda surprised it got through the store
review as it doesn't seem to do anything. 
 
There are many ways to get custom apps onto an iOS device, the VPP for Business
allows the creation of custom apps http://www.apple.com/business/vpp/ and then there's
the Enterprise Developer Program, just using test flight with access for 1000 "beta"
testers, or even just using the 100 identified devices allowed on a single developer
account. All of these would be used by many apps for this sort of restricted use set
application, even though they may not be fully in compliance with Apples T&C's. 
 
You would be mad to do the dataset update via an app store update, the turnaround time
on getting these out would kill you.

Observe the two App Store screenshots. In the first, you can see someone's desk with
the blobs and lines and the robot superimposed. This is almost what we get when we run
the app, except we don't get the lines and the robot. It looks to me as if that is what the
app is actually supposed to do - it uses the Unity 3D game engine, which is consistent
with graphics of that sort - but somehow they have broken it. I see no evidence that the
app tries to do anything more than show the robot, lines and blobs against the camera
image (maybe animated?), but it's not impossible that more functionality is buried in there
somewhere (and inaccessible).

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/11/flotek-plea-for-accuracy.html 21/22


He seemed to claim that the data set they use is mostly accurate but that you found the
few outlier errors (which occured because of third party mistakes or a possible system
glitch). That claim seems absurd. He also seems to state that they have the data that
proves this claim but that they decided not to demonstrate it at the Stephen's meeting. If
true, this seems like a ridiculous thought process.  
 
He then seems to claim that CnF is not about increasing production but about using less
fluid in fracing thereby reducing costs. This appears ridiculous when page 13 of their
investor day has this bullet point "Our patented Complex nano-Fluid® suite of
technologies increases production while protecting the environment." They will probably
claim in the future that CnF increases production for a lower level of fluid used in the
fracing process. Such a perspective appears distinctly different than previous claims. 
 
Furthermore, he seems to claim that their FraxMax data set is focused on comparing
wells starting at 45 days after first production. Such a claim appears absurd as public
data sets, like RRC, generally do not give you the ability to do such a comparison
because, at best, they provide monthly production figures. 
 
The main question now is what data do their major customers have that demonstrates the
efficacy of FTK's CnF products?

Any chance the app is trying to phone home to Flotek before it lets you use it? I'd try
running the iPad through a network sniffer before completely writing it off as non-

I can confirm that the Texas RRC only reports gas well production at the well level, and
rolls the oil well production into the lease level while providing the number of producing
wells on a lease from my knowledge. It is the most nonsensical database I have ever
attempted to get data out of and the ebcdic file format is quite a joy to deconstruct.  
 
Seems like a silly complaint to me.

Did they pay that guy in the infomercial? He sure did look like he was nervous speaking. I
noticed they didn't give any specific well names? Why don't they just release a thousand
well names on wells where the product has been used so a cross check can be done with
offset wells to prove the product's efficacy? Why the cloak and dagger game?

John, 
 
What's your view on Flotek now? regarding that they have discontinued their drilling and
production activities and the rise in consumer and industrial tech segment? Their energy
chemical are still on decline but perhaps they can make a turnaround if oil prices recover
and more O&G firms start to produce.
