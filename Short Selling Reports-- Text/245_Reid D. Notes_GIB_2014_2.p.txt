CGI Group: How Much Money Did Logica Lose? (Part 2)

Please read our disclosure at the end of this entry. All figures in CAD unless noted
otherwise.


This is our second in a series of entries on CGI Group, Inc. (NYSE:GIB). We remain short
CGI stock.


In this entry, we show how acquisition accounting can be used to manipulate earnings. We
also explain how CGI re-marked the assets and liabilities of Logica PLC in accounting
related to the acquisition, and we discuss what the re-marking implies about Logica's
historical profitability.


Readers should begin with our first entry on CGI, in which we introduce the Logica
acquisition and the concept of "cookie jar" accounting. We also suggest that investors
read a recent article about CGI's accounting in Vanity Fair in which the author, Bethany
McLean, compares CGI to Tyco International Ltd. under Dennis Kozlowski.


How did CGI account for the Logica acquisition?


CGI Group, Inc. ("CGI" or the Company) acquired Logica in an August 2012 deal that
valued Logica's outstanding shares at $2.7 billion and the whole enterprise at $3.6 billion.
In accounting for the acquisition, CGI followed accounting guidelines laid out in IFRS 3.
IFRS 3 required CGI to make certain valuation adjustments to Logica's assets and
liabilities in a purchase price allocation.


We focus our analysis on two types of adjustments that CGI made in the Logica purchase
price allocation:


1. CGI adjusted the book value of Logica's accrual accounts to conform with CGI's
accounting and revenue recognition policies: Logica and CGI had different revenue
recognition policies. Differing revenue recognition policies result in different accruals
for balance sheet accounts such as work-in-progress and deferred revenues.


2. CGI made further adjustments to mark the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to
fair value: Logica's assets and liabilities were not carried at fair value on Logica's
balance sheet before the acquisition. IFRS 3 requires that CGI adjust the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed to their fair value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1965651-cgi-group-how-much-money-did-logica-lose-part-2 2/11


The purchase price allocation resulted in post-acquisition book values for Logica's assets
and liabilities that were meaningfully different than the pre-acquisition book values.


Importantly, the adjustments for the purchase price allocation depended on subjective
assumptions and discretion from CGI's management.


Because of this subjectivity, IFRS 3 allows acquirers to retrospectively revise adjustments
for a full year after the close of an acquisition. CGI revised the Logica purchase price
allocation several times in the year following the acquisition.


Can balance sheet adjustments be used to manipulate earnings?


Our prior entry on CGI explored one method that companies use to engage in cookie jar
accounting: Companies manipulate accrual accounts to create artificial losses in a target
company during the stub period before an acquisition. After the acquisition closes, the
acquirer can reverse the fake loss-making accruals of the stub period. The reversal of
loss-making accruals generates inflated earnings and no corresponding cash flow.


Here we explore a similar method for earnings manipulation:


Just as an acquirer can create a cookie jar in the stub period preceding an acquisition, an
acquirer can create a cookie jar by manipulating the post-acquisition balance sheet of a
target company. The acquirer can make pro forma purchase price allocation adjustments
to understate a target company's assets and overstate its liabilities.


Understating a target's assets and overstating its liabilities has the effect of artificially
depressing the book value of the target company. In the periods following the acquisition,
the acquirer can reverse the pro forma write-downs of assets and write-ups of liabilities to
increase book value and generate fictional earnings but no cash flow.


From an accounting perspective, the two cookie jar accounting techniques we have
discussed are equivalent to one another. This is because earnings (and losses) represent
the change in the book value of a company from one period to the next. Thus, reporting
fake losses in a stub period has the same impact as making pro forma acquisition
accounting adjustments to artificially depress book values.


A company engaging in cookie jar accounting through acquisition-related adjustments
would show a substantial reduction to the book value of a target company.


Following the close of the acquisition, we would expect to see margin expansion, inflated
earnings, increased book value, but no corresponding increase in operating cash flow.

Is the Logica purchase price allocation consistent with cookie jar accounting
patterns?


CGI made several rounds of pro forma adjustments to the book value of Logica's assets
and liabilities over the course of one year following the acquisition, as permitted by IFRS
3. CGI does not provide a document that summarizes all pro forma adjustments to
Logica's book value relating to the purchase price allocation.


We have constructed a table that shows all the purchase price allocation adjustments
using information from five different CGI filings. Investors may download a PDF of this
table here.


The cumulative effect of all the purchase price allocation adjustments to Logica's balance
sheet is shown in the following table.

We note that CGI's purchase price allocation reduced Logica's current assets by $737
million and increased Logica's liabilities by $276 million.


These adjustments had the effect of lowering the book value of Logica by over $1,013
million. $1,013 million of book value is equal to 60% of the market value of Logica's equity
before CGI's acquisition offer, and is more than twice the earnings of CGI in fiscal 2013.


Going forward, if CGI reverses any of the $1,013 million markdown in book value from
adjustments to current assets and liabilities, CGI will recognize higher earnings, higher
margins, increased working capital, but cash flows will be unaffected.


Logica's total net book value (all assets less all liabilities) did not change significantly in
the purchase price allocation because the markdown of tangible assets was offset with
very large increases to goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill was increased $603
million as a plug equal to the difference between the purchase price and the book value of
Logica's other assets and liabilities; intangible assets were increased $304 million. We do
not know CGI's basis for marking up the intangible assets by this amount.


We leave it to the reader to decide whether the acquisition write-down of Logica's tangible
book value (offset by increased intangibles and goodwill) is consistent with cookie jar
accounting methods.

Have any of the write-downs to Logica's tangible book value been reversed?


CGI's final purchase price allocation, shown in the table above, does not give us visibility
into all working capital accounts.


However, the Company provides a table that shows the effect of applying CGI's revenue
recognition policies to Logica's assets and liabilities in its first preliminary purchase price
allocation in Schedule C of a Business Acquisition Report filed on November 11, 2012.


In this table, we learn that CGI's revenue recognition adjustments to Logica's work in
progress and deferred revenues reduced Logica's book value by $384 million and $118
million, respectively.

To the extent these adjustments are reversed, CGI will record additional earnings, higher
margins, increased working capital, but no additional cash flow.


We do not know whether CGI has reversed any of these adjustments, but we are able to
track how CGI's consolidated work in progress and deferred revenue accounts have
changed in the past fiscal year.


Page 10 of CGI's FY 2013 financials shows how these accounts have contributed to a
substantial increase in the book value of CGI in fiscal 2013: work in progress increased by
$169 million, and deferred revenues decreased by $164 million. Both these changes
increased working capital at CGI.


We think it is interesting that the increase in working capital from these line items in fiscal
2013 generated earnings but did not generate operating cash flows.


We leave it to the reader to determine whether the purchase price allocation markdown of
Logica's working capital accounts, followed by growing working capital at CGI in fiscal
2013, is consistent with the use of cookie jar accounting techniques.


Did Logica make any money in the five years before the acquisition? What are the
implications of CGI's purchase price allocation adjustments?

CGI marking down the book value of Logica's net assets is equivalent to re-stating
Logica's pre-acquisition financials to show lower earnings. This is because earnings
simply represent the growth of a company's book value over time, adjusted for
distributions to shareholders.


We think it is interesting to consider what Logica's earnings would have been if Logica's
financials had been restated to align with CGI's final purchase price allocation.


Logica's tangible book value was marked down by $765 million in CGI's purchase price
allocation. Therefore, restating Logica's financials would have eliminated $765 million in
historical Logica earnings related to tangible assets. (We exclude CGI's $304 million mark-
up of intangibles because we do not understand the basis for this adjustment.)


A $765 million adjustment would have effectively eliminated all of Logica's profits going
back to 2007, as shown in the table below.


In other words, CGI's purchase price allocation adjustments imply that Logica may have
been much less profitable than previously reported and was likely producing large losses
for several years.


Summary


In this note, we have discussed the following:


Cookie jar accounting is when a company understates profits in one period, so that it
can overstate profits in a subsequent period.
Re-marking the book value of a company is equivalent to re-stating earnings from prior
periods.
CGI made a series of adjustments to Logica's balance sheet in accounting for the
acquisition that reduced Logica's tangible book value by $765 million.

These adjustments are equivalent to writing off $765 million of Logica's earnings,
which is equivalent to more than all of Logica's combined earnings from 2007 to 2011.
Working capital, which was marked down in the Logica purchase price allocation
adjustments, has grown at CGI since the acquisition.
Growth in working capital has generated earnings for CGI but has not generated
additional cash flow.


In subsequent notes we will look at topics such as CGI's organic growth and bookings.

Granted, it appears the author has an excellent grasp on reading financials, and he makes the numerical points well.
He obviously spent a lot of time. My kudos to him. 
However, the hands-on sources I have, describe a company that - in the field - is seeing significantly expanding
operational activities, new lucrative contracts, and other very positive developments. 
(The story of their role in Healthcare.gov has been hugely misstated, and of course their contract included a Gag
Order.)  
Direct observations and key conversations I am having, makes it difficult for me to share the author's opinion that CGI
is any trouble whatsoever, and moreover, it may be poised for growth that will outsize recent years. 
He may be right, but I would not short this stock if I were you. 
You may have noticed Fri, the Dow was down 300 pts, and CGI stock was up .67%. 
Go figure.

I'd like to ask one question. One of the paragraph at the top of the article says that IFRS3 allows to reverse
adjustement for a full year after an acquisition. Does that mean the cookie jar is only effective for 12 months past
acquisition? If so it will be interesting to see the next CGI results as this period is over.

Author’s reply »  On their conference call today, CGI noted cash flow from operations before integration payments
was $819 million in the trailing twelve months ended 12/31/2013. This figure is shown on slide 12 of today’s earnings
deck.


We would make two points:


- Short term accrued compensation has risen over $200 million in the trailing twelve months. Had accrued
compensation remained flat over the trailing twelve months, operating cash flow plus integration payments would
have been less than $620 million. (We assume that CGI will eventually pay employees their bonuses).


- CGI regularly spends cash on purchasing PP&E, contract costs, and intangible assets. Over the trailing twelve
months, total expenditures on these three items was over $260 million.

Operating cash flow before integration payments, less the cash benefit from growth of accrued compensation, less
the disbursements on PP&E, contracts costs, and intangibles, would have been less than $360 million in the trailing
twelve months.
