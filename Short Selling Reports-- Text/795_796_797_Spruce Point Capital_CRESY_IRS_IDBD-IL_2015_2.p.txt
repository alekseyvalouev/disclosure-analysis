Ten Thousand Foot View


• IRSA (NYSE: IRS) is a Latin American real estate company. IRSA recently invested $300m+ in IDB Development Corp. (TLV: IDBD), an 


Israeli holding company with interests in real estate, communications, agricultural products, insurance and technology. IDBD is burdened 


with $6.7 billion of net debt, going through a restructuring process, and has a “going concern” warning from its auditor. It is 


dependent on further capital injection commitments from IRSA of approximately $185m through 2016


• Together with IFISA, a related-party and controlled entity of IRSA’s Chairman, it appears that IRSA owns 81% of IDBD, a controlling stake 


that should trigger IDBD being consolidated into the financial results of IRSA. IRSA claims that it only owns 49%. The additional capital 


injections of $185m will only increase the aforementioned ownership stake above the current level


• IRSA has used a narrow loophole in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) accounting to avoid consolidation by designating its 


IDBD investment through Dolphin Fund, a subsidiary designated a Venture Capital Organization (“VCO”). In our opinion, this is a grossly 


flawed accounting application to avoid consolidation and we’ve provided documentary evidence that calls into question Dolphin’s status as a 


VCO. Upon consolidation, we estimate IRSA’s pro forma Net Debt / EBITDA leverage to be 8.6x


• Under IRSA’s outstanding Global Notes indenture, a consolidation of IDBD’s debt would result in a covenant breach of its EBITDA to 


interest coverage ratio of 1.75x (we estimate pro forma 1.25x). At its October shareholder meeting, IRSA took the necessary steps to issue 


a further $300m in Global Notes, perhaps as means to fund its IDBD capital injections. A covenant breach would impede this issuance  


• In a November NT 20-F filing (a request for an extension to file its annual report), IRSA suggested that the SEC may be currently investigating 


the consolidation issue by requiring IDBD financial statements audited under US GAAS. The SEC denied its request to Israeli GAAS


statements instead.  In its new 20-F filing, IRSA included a big risk factor that its inability to provide such audited financials would 


“materially adversely affect” its ability its access to capital markets, and may ultimately result in the delisting of its shares. 


• IRSA trades at 3.6x book value, an irrational price given the apparent covenant breach and debt issues upon IDBD consolidation. If IRSA 


traded at 1x book value, its stock would be worth $4.75 per ADR (approx. 70% downside)


• IRSA is 64% owned by Cresud (Nasdaq: CRESY). CRESY’s stock trades parallel to IRSA’s and could fall to $4.00 per ADR (-70%)


How the Dominos May Fall:


1. The SEC denies IRSA’s request to file anything but US GAAS statements for IDBD; compels IRSA to consolidate IDBD


2. IRSA severely breaches its EBITDA/Interest covenant under its Global Notes indenture


3. IDBD’s future becomes more uncertain as its controlling shareholder becomes restricted from making good on additional capital contributions


4. CRESY’s 64% ownership stake in IRSA becomes impaired, causing harm to its own shares

We Believe IDBD Should Be Consolidated Into IRSA’s Financials: IRSA’s accounting choice appears designed for 


one thing; to avoid consolidation of IDBD into its financials. We can understand why; IDBD is massively levered with  


$6.7 billion of net debt outstanding as of 6/30/15. Despite IRSA having already injected $300m+ into IDBD since 2014, 


IDBD still has received a “going concern” warning from its auditor as of 6/30/15. IRSA has commitments to inject a 


further $185m into IDBD through 2016. We estimate IRSA’s pro forma Net Debt / EBITDA assuming consolidation to be 


8.6x, however, we view IRSA’s EBITDA as inappropriate because it includes gains from sales of investment properties, 


which goes against best practices for IFRS reporting. By normalizing IRSA’s EBITDA, and converting it to US$, we find 


its EBITDA has been declining and barely covering its interest expense. IRSA appears dependent on liquidating its real 


estate assets to fund its investment in IBDB and to cover its interests costs


Under IRSA’s Global Bond Indenture, It Appears To Be In Violation of its Covenants: IRSA currently carries 


US$300m of debt issued under its Global Notes program which mature in 2017 and 2020. Its indenture contains an 


“Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” covenant that expressly prohibits its EBITDA to Interest ratio to be less than 


1.75x on a pro forma basis. Given IDBD’s substantial debt load (consisting primarily of unsecured debentures 


amounting to $5.4 billion), we estimate IRSA’s pro forma coverage ratio to be 1.25x (1.0x excluding one-time property 


gains). It is our view that IRSA is in imminent risk of a covenant breach


Egregious Accounting For IRSA’s Controlling Investment in IDB Holdings: Our close examination of the facts and 


circumstances suggest that IRSA has majority control of IDBD through related-party entities under common control that 


have accumulated 81% of IDBD’s shares. It appears that IRSA has structured its investment through an entity it 


designated as a VCO. IFRS rules provide a narrow exception for investment entities such as VCOs to allow issuers to 


record investments on the balance sheet as an “investment in associate” and record changes in value through the 


income statement. In our opinion, IRSA’s Dolphin Fund VCO entities bear no resemblance to a venture fund by any 


stretch of the imagination. In short, we believe the designation as a VCO is grossly inappropriate and designed to avoid 


consolidating IDBD’s $6.7 billion of net debt on to IRSA’s books


IRSA’s New 20-F Annual Report Filing Highlights Big Material Risk of ADR Delisting: On Nov 3rd IRSA filed an NT 


20-F indicating it had petitioned the SEC for relief from presenting IDBD’s US GAAS audited statements. IRSA offered 


an excuse that “it was unable to force its associate” to provide audited financials following US GAAS standards. Given 


that IRSA controls ~81% of IDBD’s shares and that IRSA and IBDB share the same Chairman of the Board (Eduardo 


Elsztain), the response is questionable. The SEC denied IRSA’s request for relief. The new 20-F filed on Nov 17th adds 


a risk factor that, absent a waiver from the SEC, it may lose its registration, access to capital, and be delisted

By Virtue of Cresud Owning 64.3% of IRSA, We Believe Its Shares Risk Impairment: Cresud (Nasdaq: CRESY), 


a Latin American agriculture company, is also controlled by Mr. Elsztain. Its current market cap of $650m 


approximates its IRSA ownership. If IRSA’s price becomes impaired from a covenant breach, CRESY’s stock price 


could also become impaired as it consolidates IRSA’s debt load. We see a similar 70% downside to its share price


Rampant Evidence of Deficient Disclosures to the SEC and Its Global Investors:  IRSA operates in a multi-


jurisdictional securities law and regulatory environment. It is an Argentina company that has an ADR listed on the 


NYSE. Furthermore, its material investment in IDBD trades in Israel. We have observed a few instances where IDBD 


has made disclosures related to IRSA, yet IRSA has failed to make corresponding disclosures to the SEC, or in a timely 


manner. From a materiality perspective, IRSA should be reporting to the SEC the activities of IDBD, a material 


subsidiary. IDBD’s assets totaled $10.5 billion at 6/30/15 or 11x larger than IRSA’s assets!


Plenty of Related Party Deals To Consider: IRSA makes numerous disclosures about related-party transactions. IRSA 


has the largest list of related-party transactions that Spruce Point has, to date, ever seen! To illustrate, IRSA’s 2015 20-F 


Note 37 to the financial statements include 17 pages (F180 to F197) of related party disclosures! We have found 


instances of related party transactions not adequately described to IRSA investors. For example, complete details of an 


off-market warrant transfer from IRSA to IFISA (an entity controlled by the Chairman) were not adequately disclosed 


8


IRSA and CRESY’s Auditor Cited For Significant Audit Deficiencies: Both IRSA and CRESY (along with IRSA 


Commercial Properties (Nasdaq: IRCP)) are all audited by Price Waterhouse & Co S.R.L. a member firm of PWC. 


According to its last PCAOB inspection report from 2013, the firm had just 11 issuer audit clients, which raises the 


likelihood that these inter-related companies may have been the subject of the audit citations. Specifically, the reported 


highlighted for “the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test the initial recording of, and subsequent accounting for, 


assets purchased,” and “the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test the fair values of fixed assets acquired in 


business combinations.” – This would be significant for an acquisitive minded real estate company such as IRSA


9


IRSA’s Share Price Is Dramatically Overvalued: IRSA trades at approximately 3.8x and 8.5x, LTM Sales and Adjusted 


EBITDA (assuming no IDBD consolidation). On a pro forma basis for the consolidation of IDBD, we estimate IRSA trades 


at 1.5x and 10.0x LTM Sales and Adjusted EBITDA. Given our belief that it is currently in violation of its debt covenants, 


levered 8.6x on a pro forma net debt basis, on the hook for funding $185m in commitments to IDBD, and resorting to 


asset sales to raise cash, we believe IRSA is in a precarious position. If IRSA traded at its book value in reflection of its


pending problems, the stock would have 70% downside to $4.75 per ADR

• IDB Development Corp Ltd (IDBD) is an Israeli holding company with interests in businesses across various industries 


such as agriculture, financial services, real estate, communications and technology. 


• In May 2014, IRSA, through Dolphin Netherlands BV (“Dolphin”), its indirect subsidiary, acquired 23% of IDBD’s 


common shares as part of a court approved debt restructuring with the creditors of IDBD’s parent company, IDB 


Holdings Corporation Ltd.  By December 31, 2014, IRSA’s ownership interest in IDBD had increased to 31% of IDBD’s 


outstanding shares.  Under the terms of an agreement between Dolphin Fund Ltd (DFL), a majority owned subsidiary of 


IRSA, and E.T.H. M.B.M. Extra Holdings Limited (“Extra”), dated November 17, 2013 (the “Shareholders Agreement”), 


IRSA’s ownership interest in IDBD gave it the right to appoint three of the nine members of IDBD’s board of directors, 


while Extra’s ownership interest gave it the right to appoint another three members of the board. 


• In February 2015, Dolphin acquired additional IDBD shares as part of a rights offering approved by a majority of IDBD’s 


board. Extra did not purchase shares in the rights offering and, as a result, subsequent to the completion of the offering, 


Dolphin owned approximately 61% of IDBD’s outstanding shares. 


• Subsequent to the completion of the rights offering, Dolphin sold shares totaling approximately 12% of IDBD’s 


outstanding shares to Inversiones Financieras del Sur S.A. (“IFISA”) for cash and a note receivable secured by the 


IDBD shares. IFISA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFIS Limited (“IFIS”), over which Mr. Elsztain has control of 


(greater than 50% of the voting shares), either through direct and indirect holdings or through irrevocable powers of 


attorney that give him the right to vote shares owned by other IFIS shareholders. 


• Extra gave notice to Dolphin that Extra was exercising its rights under the “buy me buy you” provision in the 


Shareholders Agreement requiring Dolphin to either sell all of its IDBD shares to Extra at a specified price or purchase 


all of Extra’s shares at that price. Dolphin elected to purchase all of Extra’s IDBD shares. Dolphin, through IFISA, 


purchased all of Extra’s IDBD shares bringing IFISA’s holdings in IDBD to over 32%. In our opinion, the net effect is that 


IRSA now owns 81% through its common control interests in Dolphin and IFISA and has the right to appoint an 


additional three Board members (for a total of six of nine)

We estimate that Dolphin, IFISA, and entities related to Eduardo Elsztain now own approximately 81% of IDBD (vs. 49% 


reported in its SEC financial filings), and clearly has control of IDBD


• Subsequent to the completion of the Feb 2015 rights offering, Dolphin sold shares totaling approximately 12% of IDBD’s outstanding 


shares to Inversiones Financieras del Sur S.A. (“IFISA”) for cash and a note receivable secured by the IDBD shares. 


• IFISA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFIS Limited (“IFIS”), over which Mr. Elsztain has control of more than 50% of the voting shares, 


either through direct and indirect holdings or through irrevocable powers of attorney that give him the right to vote shares owned by other 


IFIS shareholders. 


• Specifically, IRSA’s 20-F (p. 114) says “Eduardo S. Elsztain is the Chairman of the board of directors of IFIS Limited, a corporation 


organized under the laws of Bermuda and Inversiones Financieras del Sur S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Uruguay.


Mr. Elsztain, is the beneficial owner of 37.94% of IFIS capital stock, which owns 100% of Inversiones Financieras del Sur S.A.”


• Extra gave notice to Dolphin that Extra was exercising its rights under the “buy me buy you” provision in the Shareholders Agreement 


requiring Dolphin to either sell all of its IDBD shares to Extra at a specified price or purchase all of Extra’s shares at that price. Dolphin 


elected to purchase all of Extra’s IDBD shares 


• Dolphin, through IFISA, purchased all of Extra’s IDBD shares bringing IFISA’s holdings in IDBD to over 32%. This acquired 32% stake, 


when added to IRSA’s 49% stake, brings IRSA’s total ownership to approximately 81%


• In relation to the above transaction, IRSA’s 6-K disclosure to U.S. investors was limited to saying that it would acquire the stake at a price 


of NIS1.64 per share for a total amount of NIS 151,972,119 (approx US$ 38.7 million) and that Dolphin will additionally assume all the 


obligations that Extra Holdings has, including the obligation to make certain share repurchases during 2015 and 2016


• A 6-K filed on October 13, 2015 indicated that IRSA granted a 1 year loan to IFSA for $40m 1M Libor +3%, with “no audit 


committee objection” 


• A final 6-K filed on October 26, 2015 still represented that as of the filing date, IRSA held indirectly through Dolphin 49% of the 


outstanding shares of IDBD

We believe that IDBD became a subsidiary of IRSA as a result of the February 2015 rights offering, which 


resulted in an increase in Dolphin’s ownership interest to 61% of IDBD’s outstanding shares. IFRS 10 


Consolidated Financial Statements,  states, in part:


“an investor controls an investee if and only if the investor has all the following:


a) power over the investee (see paragraphs 10–14);


b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee (see paragraphs 15 and 16); and


c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns 


(see paragraphs 17 and 18)”


• We believe that Dolphin controlled IDBD subsequent to the rights offering as it had the right to call a General Meeting 


and appoint a majority of IDBD’s directors due to its 61% interest. Eduardo is currently Chairman of the Board, and 


Dolphin also appointed Alejandro Gustavo Elsztain and Saúl Zang as regular members (although IDBD’s website


does not show Alejandro). Currently three of nine members are representatives of IRSA/Dolphin. Therefore, IRSA 


should have included IDBD in its consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary as of March 31, 2015. The fact 


that Dolphin did not exercise its right to appoint a majority of IDBD’s board does not, in any way, diminish its control 


over IDBD. Paragraph BC97 of IFRS 10 addresses that topic, stating, in part:


“an investor that holds more than half the voting rights of an investee has power over the investee when those 


voting rights give the investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities (either directly or by appointing the 


members of the governing body). The Board concluded that such an investor’s voting rights are sufficient to give 


it power over the investee regardless of whether it has exercised its voting power….”

We do not believe the transfer of a 12% interest to a related party (Dolphin’s sale of 12% of IDBD to IFISA) changes 


the conclusion that Dolphin could exercise control over IDBD. In discussing relationships between an investor and 


other parties, IFRS 10 paragraphs B74 and B75 state, in part:


B74: “… A party is a de facto agent when the investor has, or those that direct the activities of the investor have, the 


ability to direct that party to act on the investor’s behalf. In these circumstances, the investor shall consider its de 


facto agent’s decision-making rights and its indirect exposure, or rights, to variable returns through the de facto agent 


together with its own when assessing control of an investee.”


B75:  “The following are examples of such other parties that, by the nature of their relationship, might act as de facto 


agents for the investor:


a) the investor’s related parties.


b) a party that received its interest in the investee as a contribution or loan from the investor.


c) a party that has agreed not to sell, transfer or encumber its interests in the investee without the investor’s 


prior approval (except for situations in which the investor and the other party have the right of prior approval 


and the rights are based on mutually agreed terms by willing independent parties).


d) a party that cannot finance its operations without subordinated financial support from the investor.


e) an investee for which the majority of the members of its governing body or for which its key management 


personnel are the same as those of the investor.


f) a party that has a close business relationship with the investor, such as the relationship between a 


professional service provider and one of its significant client”


Because IFISA is a related party of Dolphin and because Dolphin financed IFISA’s purchase of the IDBD shares, we 


believe that, in accordance with paragraphs B74 and B75 of IFRS 10, IFISA is Dolphin’s de facto agent and the 


shares held by IFISA should be attributed to Dolphin, and ultimately IRSA’s total ownership of IDBD

In a signed affidavit to the Israeli Court, Saul Zang – First Vice Chairman of IRSA – stated fairly clearly

is the same individual that signs IRSA’s financial statements and filings to the SEC.

• The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in October 2012, to 


introduce an exception from consolidation of investments in subsidiaries by entities that qualify as 


investment entities. Such entities must not consolidate their subsidiaries; instead those subsidiaries must 


be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss 


• The standard defines an investment entity as one that:


 Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purposes of providing those investors with 


investment management services


 Commits to its investor(s) that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital 


appreciation, investment income or both  


 Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis


• Most investment entities will be in the fund management industry, including private equity and venture 


capital funds


• The standard also sets out the following four typical characteristics of an investment entity to be 


considered alongside the definition, although the absence of any one of these does not necessarily 


disqualify an entity from being classified as an investment entity:


 It has more than one investment


 It has more than one investor 


 It has investors that are not related parties of the entity


 It has ownership interest in the form of equity or similar interests

IRSA’s investment in IDBD made through Dolphin Fund Limited (“DFL”) and related Dolphin Entities


“On May 7, 2014, a transaction was closed whereby we, acting indirectly through Dolphin Netherlands, subsidiary of 


DFL, an investment fund incorporated under the laws of the Island of Bermuda and subsidiary of the Company, 


acquired, jointly with ETH, 106.6 million common shares in IDBD representing 53.33% of its stock capital, under the 


scope of the debt restructuring of IDBD’s holding company, IDB Holdings Corporation Ltd., with its creditors. Under 


the terms of the agreement entered into between DFL and E.T.H. M.B.M. Extra Holdings Ltd., a controlled company 


of Mordechay Ben Moshé, to which Dolphin Netherlands and ETH adhered, Dolphin Netherlands, jointly with other 


third party investors acquired a 50% interest in this investment, while ETH acquired the remaining 50%. The total 


investment amount was NIS 950 million, equivalent to approximately US$ 272 million at the exchange rate prevailing 


on that date. As of June 30, 2014, our indirect interest in IDBD was 23%.”


IRSA Describes DFL Specifically as a Venture Capital Organization (“VCO”)


“We generally account for our investments in associates under the equity method. However, IAS 28 “Investments in 


Associates” provides an exemption from applying the equity method where investments in associates are held 


through “Venture Capital Organizations” (VCO) or venture capital entities, as defined in Spanish, even when we are 


not a VCO. This type of investment may be accounted for at fair value with changes in net income for the years 


because such measure proves to be more useful to users of financial statements than the equity method.”


And later on pages 52 and F-59:  


“As DFL is a subsidiary that qualifies as a VCO under the exemption contained in IAS 28 mentioned in Note 2.3 (d), 


the Group has valued its interest in IDBD at fair value with changes in the income statement.”

as a VCO


Typically provides start-up capital in 


high-risk private ventures that do 


not have access to the public 


capital markets


IDBD is a public company in Israel with mature businesses in communications, 


insurance, real estate and retail. IDBD has access to the public capital markets. 


The capital being provided by IRSA is to restructure IDBD


No


Held in a portfolio of multiple 


venture capital investments

Bermuda) do not indicate any other venture investment holdings


No


Pooling of investor capital for 


purposes of making investments


Our review of IRSA’s Dolphin filings (Netherlands, Gibraltar) do not indicate any 


other outside strategic investors. Dolphin Fund Ltd (Bermuda) has a substantial 


majority investor ~90%  – tied to its Chairman and IRSA – a related party


No


Seeking long-term growth in capital 


appreciation vs. current income


IRSA describes its investment in IDBD through its International segment which it 


says seeks long-term capital appreciation


Yes


Usually has an identified exit 


strategy (e.g., IPO or strategic sale)


IDBD is already a public company in Israel. IRSA may seek to sell some of its 


businesses or assets as part of its restructuring, however, we do not believe 


there is a strategic acquirer for all of IDBD


No


Investments made are typically in 


businesses unrelated to the entity’s 


business


IRSA’s main business is real estate. IRSA also owns 29.77% of Banco 


Hipotecario, a full service Argentina commercial bank. Approximately 20% and


25% of IDBD’s holdings are real estate and financial service related, 


respectively. Therefore, it appears nearly 50% of IDBD’s business are directly 


related to IRSA’s businesses. Furthermore, 27% of IDBD’s holding relate to 


Adama, an agricultural crop solutions company. This business appears 


strategically significant to Cresud’s agricultural business. Cresud owns 65.9% of 


IRSA as of 6/30/14.


No


Our interpretation of Dolphin and its entities suggest that it is not a Venture Capital Organization

• IRSA should be reporting to the SEC the activities of IDBD, a material subsidiary which we believe should be consolidated. To


illustrate, IRSA’s total assets as of 6/30/15 were approximately $960m (adjusted to exclude reporting IDBD as an associate). IDBD’s 


assets totaled $10.5 billion at 6/30/15 or 11x larger than IRSA’s assets!


• Under Israeli law, Dolphin has been required to inform IDBD of material events related to its investment in IDBD. IDBD, in turn, 


discloses such events in an “Immediate Report” on Magna, Israel’s public disclosure portal.  As a foreign private issuer, IRSA, 


Dolphin’s parent company, is required to submit a current report on Form 6-K promptly when material information is made public to 


non-US investors based on foreign laws or stock exchange regulations  


• We’ve identified numerous matters that have been disclosed by IDBD on Magna for which IRSA has either not filed a Form 


6-K or has not disclosed certain information in the 6-K that was disclosed on Magna, including the following significant events:


1. On February 10, 2015, Dolphin sold 71.39 million (or approximately 12%) IDBD shares to IFISA for a total price of 


approximately ARS 221.9 million ($25.65 million). IRSA filed a 6-K dated February 11, 2015 disclosing the sale of the shares 


to IFISA. However, IRSA did not disclose in that Form 6-K that, as consideration for the sale, it had accepted a note from 


IFISA for approximately 86% of the sale price secured by a pledge of the IDBD shares. That information was provided in a 


filing on Magna by IDBD. Further, IRSA does not discuss the terms of the related party transaction as required by IAS 24 


Related Party Disclosures in its March 31, 2015 quarterly financials. In Note 34 to the quarterly financial statements, IRSA 


discloses that, as of March 31, 2015, it had trade and other receivables from IFISA totaling ARS 191.8 million, up from ARS 


0.4 million at June 30, 2014. IRSA classified the receivable from IFISA as a current asset at March 31, 2015


2. On February 22, 2015, IDBD disclosed through Magna that Extra and Dolphin had requested arbitration over the rights 


offering that closed in early February 2015. On February 26, 2015, IDBD disclosed through Magna that the parties agreed to 


arbitrate the dispute. The issues to be arbitrated include damages relating to Dolphin’s failure to offer Extra the option to


purchase one-half of the shares that Dolphin acquired in the rights offering. The arbitration was disclosed in IRSA’s 6-K


quarterly financial results as of March 31, 2015, which was not furnished to the SEC until June 17, 2015, almost four months 


after this information was disclosed in Magna.

3. On May 8, 2015, IDBD disclosed through Magna that Dolphin had committed to make an additional investment totaling NIS 150 


million (approximately $38.9 million at the exchange rate on that day) by exercising warrants to acquire IDBD shares. Dolphin’s 


commitment was disclosed in its 6-K Note 41 Subsequent Events of the March 31, 2015 financial statements furnished to the 


SEC on June 17, 2015 


4. Dolphin sold the warrants to IFISA on May 31, 2015 at a price below the market price for the warrants and IFISA exercised the 


warrants on June 2, 2015. IDBD disclosed Dolphin’s commitment and the transfer of the warrants to IFISA through Magna, but 


IRSA has still not furnished that information on Form 6-K, nor did it disclose the transfer or exercise of the warrant in its March 


31, 2015 financial statements.


 IRSA sold series 4 warrants to purchase 46,000,020 shares of IDBD to IFISA for a price of NIS 0.01 per share, at a 


time when the market price of the IDBD warrants was NIS 0.46. (See Appendix). IFISA exercised these warrants 


on June 7, 2015. 


 This transaction has the appearance of siphoning value from IRSA shareholders by transferring value to entities 


controlled by the Chairman at a below market price


5. On May 28, 2015, IDBD disclosed through Magna that Extra had triggered the buyout mechanism in the Shareholders 


Agreement, requiring Dolphin to either sell its shares to Extra at the indicated price or purchase Extra’s shares at that price. On 


June 10, 2015, IDBD disclosed through Magna that Dolphin had elected under the buyout mechanism to acquire Extra’s shares 


in IDBD for an aggregate purchase price of NIS 151.97 million ($39.7 million at the June 10, 2015 exchange rate). IRSA did not 


disclose that Extra had triggered the buyout mechanism or that it had committed to acquire Extra’s shares in its March 31, 2015 


financial statements filed June 17th, 2015, nor had it timely furnished that information on Form 6-K, until it reported on the result 


of an arbitration proceeding relating to the buyout four months later in a 6-K September 25, 2015


6. On September 9, 2015, IRSA filed its consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015 with the National 


Securities Commission in Argentina. IRSA has continued to account for IDBD at fair value through profit or loss, even though we 


believe IRSA obtained control over IDBD in February 2015. It took IRSA until November 17, 2015 to file its 20-F with the SEC


7. IRSA also recently released its Q1 2016 results through the September 30, 2015 period with full financial results on its website, 


yet filed a brief summary to the SEC in a 6-K

EBITDA Was 74x Higher Than Revenue in 2015! The 
Operating Segment Has Zero Depreciation


The financial presentation of IRSA’s “Sales and Developments” segment is perplexing. Its EBITDA dwarfs 


its sales, and its disclosures below adds little clarity as to what is a sale. Also, IRSA includes no 


depreciation in this segment. What happens after it completes a property development and it sits waiting 


to be sold? Where is the depreciation accounted for? 


“We seek to purchase undeveloped properties in densely-populated areas and build apartment complexes 


offering green space for recreational activities. We also seek to develop residential communities by acquiring 


undeveloped properties with convenient access to the City of Buenos Aires, developing roads and other basic 


infrastructure such as electric power and water, and then selling lots for the construction of residential units.”


“Revenues from this segment usually undergo significant variations between periods because of: (i) the non-


recurrence of the sales of properties and of the prices obtained for such sales; (ii) the quantity of properties being 


developed and (iii) the date of completion of such developments.”

IRSA recently discussed selling New York real estate to increase its investment in IDBD:

the mortgage levied on the asset in the amount of US$ 75 million. Such transaction generated a gain before tax

IRSA’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow For Debt Repayment:  Fiscal Years Ended June 30th


Almost 80% of IRSA’s debt is US$ denominated so it’s important to evaluate its ability to repay upcoming maturities in 2017. 


We adjust IRSA’s operating cash flow to remove interest paid. Under IFRS companies have the option to show this figure as a 


financing cash flow, but under traditional US GAAP and financial analysis, it is an operating cash flow. After factoring in the 


depreciation of Argentina Peso, we find that IRSA’s free cash flow contracted substantially in 2015 to approximately $83m and


its effective interest costs have risen to almost 13%

IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anonima 


(“IRSA” or the “Company”) has determined that it is unable to 


file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended on June 


30, 2015 (the “Form 20-F”) by the prescribed due date without 


unreasonable effort or expense for the following reasons:


(i) On October 9, 2015, IRSA filed before the SEC a request of relief 


from the requirement to present full financial statements audited 


under U.S. GAAS of an associate accounted for using the fair value 


option on Form 20-F, pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, 


based on the fact that the Company was unable to force its 


associate, IDBD Holdings Corporation Ltd. (“IDBD”) to provide 


audited financial statements following such standards. In lieu of 


the required information IRSA offered to present full financial 


statements audited under Israel GAAS, which are already available. 


On October 29, 2015, IRSA received a response from the staff of 


the SEC denying IRSA’s request. Consequently, IRSA will need 


additional time to request and obtain the US GAAS audit report for 


IDBD.


(ii) As previously reported by way of a filing on Form 6-K on October 


27, 2015, IRSA is currently analyzing the impact of certain ruling 


passed by the Tel Aviv Jaffo Court with regards to its indirect holding 


in IDBD in its accounts, which could impact the valuation of our 


investment in IDBD and the valuation of the related derivative liability 


for the tender offer of IDBD shares  to be included in IRSA’s Annual 


Report on Form 20-F. Currently, the reported amounts for our 


investment in IDBD is Ps 1,757.10 million and the related derivative 


liability is Ps 500.58  million.


CRESUD INC. (“CRESUD” or the “Company”) has determined 


that it is unable to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the 


year ended on June 30, 2015 (the “Form 20-F”) by the 


prescribed due date without unreasonable effort or expense for 


the following reasons:


(i) On October 15, 2015, CRESUD filed before the SEC a request of 


relief from the requirement to present full financial statements 


audited under U.S. GAAS of an associate accounted for using the 


fair value option on Form 20-F, pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation 


S-X, based on the fact that the Company was unable to force its 


associate, IDBD Holdings Corporation Ltd. (“IDBD”) to provide 


audited financial statements following such standards. In lieu of 


the required information CRESUD offered to present full financial 


statements audited under Israel GAAS, which are already available. 


On October 29, 2015, CRESUD received a response from the 


staff of the SEC denying CRESUD’s request. Consequently, 


CRESUD will need additional time to request and obtain the US 


GAAS audit report for IDBD.


(ii) As previously reported by way of a filing on Form 6-K on October 


27, 2015, CRESUD is currently analyzing the impact of certain ruling 


passed by the Tel Aviv Jaffo Court with regards to CRESUD’s 


indirect holding in IDBD in its accounts, which could impact the 


valuation of its investment in IDBD and the valuation of the related 


derivative liability for the tender offer of IDBD shares to be included 


in CRESUD’s Annual Report on Form 20-F. Currently, the reported 


amount for CRESUD´s indirect investment in IDBD is Ps 1,757.10 


million and the related derivative liability is Ps 500.58 million.

It appears the SEC may be investigating the consolidation issue and has denied IRSA and CRESY’s request for not 


providing it US GAAS audited IDBD financials. Ironically, IRSA claims it cannot “force” its “associate” to present audited 


US GAAS financials even though it controls 81% of IBDB and Mr. Elsztain is the Chairman of IRSA, Cresud and IDBD.

Our inability to provide audited financial statements for IDBD in accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X may cause us to 


be unable to complete a registered offering, which would materially adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets, 


may cause certain of our shareholders to be unable to rely on Rule 144 for sales of our securities and may ultimately result in 


the delisting of our GDSs from the NYSE.


We have been unable to obtain financial statements for IDBD for the year ended December 31, 2014 audited in accordance with auditing 


standards generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAS”) that may be required to be included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F 


by Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-09”). As of June 30, 2015, we held 49% of IDBD and, as such, we did not control IDBD and did 


not have the power to direct IDBD or its management to provide us with such audited consolidated financial statements. In reliance on 


Rule 12b-21 promulgated under the Exchange Act we have provided unaudited consolidated financial statements for IDBD for the year 


ended December 31, 2014, which do not comply with Rule 3-09. As a result of including such financial information, we do not believe that 


the omission of the audited financial statements in accordance with Rule 3-09 will have a material impact on a reader’s understanding of 


our financial condition or our results of operations.


We are in the process of requesting a waiver from the SEC for filing the audited consolidated financial statements of IDBD for the year 


ended December 31, 2014 as may be required by Rule 3-09. We cannot provide you with any assurances that we will obtain this 


waiver. If the SEC does not grant this waiver to us, we will have to file an amendment to this annual report including the financial 


statements of IDBD for the year ended December 31, 2014 audited in accordance with U.S. GAAS as soon as such financial statements 


become available. If this annual report on Form 20-F is considered materially deficient due to the lack of financial statements of IDBD for 


the year ended December 31, 2014 audited in accordance with U.S. GAAS, we may no longer be considered current in our Exchange Act 


reporting requirements until the time we file such amendment and we may no longer be considered timely in our Exchange Act reporting 


requirements. As a result, we would become ineligible to use a “short form” registration statement on Form F-3 for 12 months. In addition, 


the SEC may not declare effective any registration statement that we file in connection with an offering that requires the financial 


statements under Rule 3-09 to be included. If, as a result, we are unable to complete a registered offering, our ability to access the public 


capital markets would be materially adversely affected. Any resulting inability to complete a registered offering may materially adversely 


impact our business, liquidity position, growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the Rule 144 safe 


harbor for the sale of our securities may be unavailable for a certain period of time, which may make it harder to effect such sales. Finally,

As of IRSA’s recent 20-F filing on November 17, 2015 it still claims it owns just 49% of IDBD and that it doesn’t have the 


power to deliver audited financials for IDBD. The reluctance to provide these financial statements to the SEC could result 


in financing issues and a stock delisting


Still 
claiming it 


doesn’t 
“control” 


IDBD


Serious 
outcomes 


for not 
complying 
with the 


SEC!

IDB Development Series 4 Warrants


As disclosed in a Magna filing on May 31, 2015 a total of 46,002,000 Series 4 warrants were sold for NIS 0.01 


(totaling NIS 460,020 or US$ 118,561) to IFISA.1 IFISA is an entity 100% owned by IFIS Limited, which has Mr. 


Elsztain as 37.94% beneficial owner.2 According to the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, the warrants closed at NIS 0.46. 


This off-market transactions appears to be a transfer of value away from IRSA shareholders for the benefit of its 


Chairman Mr. Elsztain.

Following the closing of IRSA’s investment in IDBD in May 2014, the stock has traded down, in part as a 


reflection of the Company’s uncertain financial future and “going concern” warning issued by the auditor.

The weak Argentina Peso makes it more difficult for IRSA to make payments on its US$ debt, but also to 


honor its IDBD funding commitments in Israeli Shekels
