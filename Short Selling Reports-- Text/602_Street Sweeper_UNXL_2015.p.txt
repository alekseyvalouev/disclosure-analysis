Uni-Pixel: This Steamroller Is About To Squash Investors

Summary


The touchscreen market has shifted, battering huge, established, cost-efficient
companies.


Many smaller competitors have rushed in, and established companies have watched
low gross margins drop even to 8 percent. With the market shift, TPK's stock price
has plunged 65%.


Smartphone opportunities will evade Uni-Pixel, and the company is running out of
other good, viable markets to go after.


The company is overvalued. Competitors enjoying both profitability and scalability
trade at lower enterprise value to sales multiples than Uni-Pixel.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Editor


Many of today's investors, one sage noted, seem to be picking up pennies in front of a
steamroller. Specifically, Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) is gunning its engine, and we think
that big machine is just about to flatten unfortunate investors - again.


The Woodlands, Texas company makes touchscreen film for electronic devices and a
hard-coat protective film for various uses. The stock just recently emerged from a two-
year-long drop from about $40 to the recent ~$6.77.

The initial run-up two years ago escalated on news of a Uni-Pixel/Kodak (NYSE:KODK)
partnership announcement that April, targeting year-end 2013 to begin reeling out rolls of
film to make touchscreens respond to touch. This seemed to validate the technology.
Never mind that Kodak and Kingsbury Corp. released a very similar announcement two
months later about their partnership that, apparently unlike the Uni-Pixel deal, has landed
a sale. And no one knew then that the Uni-Pixel/Kodak roll-out would hit multiple delays
and not happen until … well, everyone's still waiting two years later. Regardless, the stock
lingered in the $30-$40 range.


Later in 2013, the stock began cratering amid a pile of reports suggesting problems,
including excessive promotions, misallocation of capital, repeated delays, heavy
competition, disappointing technology, questionable insiders (see a bull's interesting
response here), along with class-action lawsuits, including one later dismissed and others
settled.


And it was all capped off by the Securities and Exchange Commission issuing subpoenas
on Nov. 19, 2013, in connection with some Uni-Pixel sensor agreements, hurtling the
stock down to around $12 and gradually trailing downward.


But recently, the market has forgotten about Uni-Pixel's problems and its zero revenue in
each quarter of 2014 and its missed earnings. Indeed, investors sent the stock rocketing
to about $6 on hopes the company may be able this quarter to begin commercial
production of a hard-coat resin and a sensor product.


TheStreetSweeper has not yet received a response to requests to Uni-Pixel for an
interview.


Check out other viewpoints here and we'll lay out the top reasons we think it's time to drop
the pennies and run like crazy.


Dangerous, shifting market


Even low-cost companies in Taiwan have found the touchscreen market can range from
brutal to deadly. The market has battered both of Taiwan's biggest and second-biggest
touchscreen companies. Wintek Corp. (OTC:WNTKF), the second-largest touchscreen
manufacturer, had the world on a string just three years ago, according to a number of
articles. Revenue had quadrupled from 2009 to $3.5 billion in 2012, driven primarily by
juicy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) contracts for iPhone 4 and iPad touchscreens.

But Wintek poured $630 million into expanding capacity to address an anticipated market
for larger touchscreens for non-Apple devices - a market that failed to live up to
expectations.


Yet, another blow occurred when Wintek lost 75 percent of its Apple orders, because
Wintek couldn't provide the needed technology for the iPhone 5. Meanwhile, Wintek and
others watched Chinese competitors enter the market, worsening the oversupply of
touchscreens and increasing market concerns about the industry.


Focus Taiwan wrote in October:


"Wintek's financial woes are making many investors nervous that other touch panel
suppliers will encounter similar financial difficulties under the current unfavorable
circumstances."


Wintek fired 14,000 employees, shuttered three plants and filed for bankruptcy protection
in October 2014.


More small competitors, lower margins hurt


Such incidents are common within the industry, experts say.


"It mostly has to do with the growing competition and lower margins," Jerry Chen of
Laibao Hi-Tech told iPhoneinCanada. "Before, there used to be two to three companies
sharing a single order and now there may be as many as 10."


Taiwan's largest touchscreen maker, TPK Holding Co. (OTC:TPKCF), has the benefit of
yield and scale as the market leader. Yet, it has watched its margins fall from about 22
percent in 2009 to just 8 percent gross margin in 2014, even as its working capital
becomes even more negative … dropping last year to minus $665 million US dollars and
operating income sliced to 1 percent of the year before.


Indeed, TPK, has suffered a stock decline of about 65 percent since 2013.

Uni-Pixel itself notes the falling price risk in this market, as shown in this snapshot from its
corporate presentation:

Uni-Pixel's model is inherently less efficient


While touchscreen giants face troubles, too, at least they had an advantage over Uni-Pixel
from the get-go. Those companies' labor costs are much lower, because they have based
production in Taiwan or mainland China, close to panel makers. But consider the case of
Atmel Corp. (NASDAQ:ATML). Like Uni-Pixel, Atmel set up its touchscreen product plant
in the United States.


Atmel launched production of its XSense line in Colorado Springs amid great hopes late in
2013. In February 2015, just 15 months later, it decided to shut down the plant.
Apparently, its metal mesh sensors for 10.1-inch HP tablets were not cost competitive,
according to one expert.


Atmel's chief financial officer said during the recent quarterly earnings call that his
company "recently completed a strategic review and decided to exit this business."


No really viable product markets to chase


Uni-Pixel went after a 7-inch tablet opportunity, failed to get an order and then proceeded
to chase the customer's 10-inch table opportunity, according to CEO Jeff Hawthorne's
response to questions following his Jan. 14, 2015 presentation at the Needham
conference. The referenced comments are in the last couple of minutes of the webcast
here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3062726-uni-pixel-this-steamroller-is-about-to-squash-investors 5/14


"At the time that we decided to develop the 7-inch, there was a pretty reasonable market
for it. What's happened since is that the 7-inch market has really been going into
oversupply, so our customer asked us to focus on 10-inch instead of 7-inch," said Mr.
Hawthorne.


But the tablet market has been losing share to smartphones. Retailers have tried to push
discounted tablets for months and months, locally, offering tablets as cheap as $49.99 in
stores and online. When we checked in stores, shoppers milled around the counters
displaying smartphones, particularly large-display or phablets, but showed little interest in
tablet displays. Worldwide statistics verify that preference.


Global tablet shipments are on the way down and have already dropped 30 percent this
quarter, according to Digitimes Research.


Smartphone market opportunities will evade Uni-Pixel


When Henry Ford created his daring and dastardly horseless carriage, the buggy-whip
makers must have been shaking in their boots. Consumers climbed into Ford's (NYSE:F)
machines and, no matter how beautifully polished the horse-drawn carriages, no matter
how exquisitely groomed and shod the horses, new technology sent even the best of
buggy whips to the wood pile.


Likewise, we've seen the recently reversed fortunes of touchscreen makers Wintek and
TPK. Like Uni-Pixel, those companies' business plans revolved around transparent rolls of
film that were laminated on top of touchscreens. Using a touch sensor from the vendor,
plus an LCD from another vendor, the manufacturer would put the two layers of film
together.


Recent iPhone screens are different. Apple eliminated the double thickness of film to
make the phones thinner. Now, rather than encased inside a touch sensor, the sensing
element goes inside the liquid crystal display or "cell." The technology is called in-cell.


The Galaxy S screens use a similar technology. But the on-cell approach involves multiple
layers: top and bottom glasses, electrodes, liquid crystal display or LCD layer and a color
filter. Like in-cell, it's all part of the panel assembly.


Though embedded sensors were initially only for smartphones, they have now reached
the 10-inch size, according to Seeking Alpha author Richard X Roe, who goes by a
pseudonym and is short the stock.

"And they (embedded sensors) are effectively free - or very close to free," he told
TheStreetSweeper. "They are embedded in the display by the display manufacturer with
only one or two extra steps."


So, manufacturers have discovered they can cut costs using in-cell or on-cell, as they
bypass Uni-Pixel and other sensor vendors.


"That's a dramatic shift in technology that hurts their business," an analyst told
TheStreetSweeper.


Suddenly, like the buggy-whip maker of yesteryear, the sensor maker - no matter how
good, no matter how competitively priced - gets sent to the wood shed. And a smartphone
opportunity isn't even a topic of discussion for Uni-Pixel, according to Mr. Hawthorne's
comments during his Needham conference presentation. (Listen to the webcast here).


"We are addressing tablets, notebooks, 2-in-ones and all-in ones," said Mr. Hawthorne.
"We are not addressing the cell phone market."


Unprofitable Uni-Pixel looks overvalued compared to profitable peers


Company EV/Sales ('16) Est. 2015 Rev. Est. 2016 Rev.


Uni-Pixel 1.17 x $10.95 m $52.75 m


TPK 0.58 x $4.89 b $5.44 b


O-film Tech 0.94 x $4.19 b $5.21 b


(Source: Bloomberg)


Established touch sensor companies TPK and Shenzhen O-film Tech trade at low
enterprise value to sales multiples, as indicated in the chart above. They are both
profitable and have significant scale.


But look at Uni-Pixel. Lacking both profit and scale, the company is currently valued as if
full-scale production in 2016 were a certainty. Those Wall Street expectations look ripe for
revision. Uni-Pixel sales are expected to go from zero in 2014 to $11 million in 2015, then
take a nearly 5-fold leap to $53 million in 2016, then $105 million in 2017. So the valuation
and consensus forecast for Uni-Pixel seem completely out of synch.

Meanwhile, O-film, unfortunately for Uni-Pixel, is making quite a name for itself, as
indicated by this snippet from material comparing sensor suppliers and various
alternatives to indium tin oxide such as Uni-Pixel's arena - metal mesh. This is from a
tutorial presented by Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) senior touch technologist Geoff Walker:


O-film is the "800-pound gorilla" of metal mesh!


Bull thesis


Bulls assert that quality issues and delays are expected to be resolved, leading to some
commercial roll-out in coming months, including the Kodak deal that is two years behind
the target date. They presume Uni-Pixel film is cheaper and better than indium tin oxide,
so it will find uses.


Though recognizing that scaling issues may raise their ugly heads, bulls believe the hard-
coat protective film and sensor product will produce meaningful revenue and some sales
will begin in 2015. Though the CEO recently said he thinks there's enough cash for capital
expenditures in 2015, some bulls admit that, if Uni-Pixel does finally produce a
commercial product, it may need an equity raise.


In fact, company filings state:


"…our long-term viability is dependent upon our ability to successfully operate our
business, develop our manufacturing process, sign licensing, development and
distribution agreements, develop our products and raise additional capital through
offerings of our debt or equity securities to meet our business objectives."


Conclusion


Ah, if only Uni-Pixel's products and opportunities could be half as exciting as the piles of
teeth-gnashing and cheer-leading articles written about the company.


But, unfortunately, while Uni-Pixel was trying to pull itself together, a once-welcoming
market was growing rough and tumble, piling up injured competitors who'd been furiously
scraping up slim margins and even slimmer operating income. And if Uni-Pixel gets past
production issues plus that SEC investigation and actually begins commercialization, it will
still have undifferentiated, non-price-competitive products, we believe. In fact, we agree
with analysts who say it will likely need a potentially dilutive equity raise to even achieve
commercialization.

the guy who
OMG, could you make any more effort to discuss every possible factor that condems UNXL ? (repeated presentations
of events that happened with this company one to two years ago reeks of agenda) 
As the stock moved higher today (4/10/15), all of a sudden those who stand 
to lose money come out of the woodwork to make more negative commentary. 
If anyone who was short the stock didn't cover at $4.38 and move on, then 
that's a shame. UNXL may or may not find a place in the market place for their 
product, but either way they are making the effort to do so. It's still to early to 
know the outcome, but I totally disagree with this author about the future demand for touch screens.

These guys hit and run the whole index "the guy who". I do think its a good article though and a pretty
comprehensive view on the sector though I admit if he wrote against one of the ones I root for in this industry I
would probably be less happy to receive the message. With these stocks its one of those things that time will
tell who's intentions were what, investors , analyst , management and so on.

Right, "the guy who" - Well stated & agreed by most. The most relevant point with this generally "old, selective
news by shorts" article is at the "Additional Disclosure" disclaimer, as well as this authors' bio. Even cited the
famous Richard X Roe for icing on the shortcake. Dinner, anyone else?


And what a nice "recent" chart ending Jan. 2 or so. I personally like the last 60 day chart, which, like much
positive info, is not shown in this article, & being of the CURRENT UNXL company with pre-CC good
expectations as discussed in the last CC.


The steam-roller might make the worried shorts even flatter while reaching for those precious pennies, from
their DD based on ancient history.

People are still promoting this stock? I thought for sure the SEC would've investigated by now. They've pushed back
their commercial launch by... 16-20 quarters? Most of their products were supposed to go into mass production in the
2010 timeframe, weren't they? But quarter after quarter, excuse after excuse...


I'm surprised that anyone still trusts the management after this long. Seems like you'd have to be really gullible or
trusting... they haven't yet met one of their deadlines.

Stock Market Mike:


No one is promoting this stock. The article you are commenting on here is a negative article written by an
investor who is short UNXL stock. The three previous SeekingAlpha articles on UNXL were all negative
articles written by investors who were short the stock. Those articles were published 9 and 10 months ago –
7/16/14, 6/27/14, and 6/17/14. There have been no articles published on Seeking Alpha since then, until
today.


The company has issued only two press releases this year – an announcement on February 12 that it would
report 4Q results on February 26 and its report of 4Q results on February 26. As far as I know, there have
been no recent research reports published on UNXL except those that covered UNXL’s 4Q report on
February 26.

I’m surprised you don’t know that UNXL has been under new management since April 2014, when a new
CEO was hired. As you know, turnarounds often begin when old management is fired and new management
is hired. New management has yet to prove itself, but it is wrong to taint new management with the sins of the
prior management, as you have done.

Ikarus you and your BFF Richard X Roe have a very short memory. You both said NEON $1.85 was
worthless and guaranteed going to zero. What happened? The stock is now 100%+ higher.  
So if anyone wants to lose all their money I guess investors should listen to you.

I guess I should wait on covering my old short. Then again it could fall another 90% so maybe cover and then re-
establish.

Whoever wrote the article understands the industry and where it is headed! Touch integrated into display has been
around for a while. It was only a matter of time before they got the production yields up to where it became readily
accepted. Lets see, thinner, lighter and eliminates a full laminating step out of the cost of manufacturing. Is there
anything wrong with that? And, do not think that the ITO based crowd will give up without a bloody fight. O Film, the
champion of the micro metal mesh industry appears to be backing tracking out of the technology. Touch is practically
a commodity business now. If a company does not have manufacturing in Asia, it will be a very tough road.


10 Apr 2015, 07:45 PM


goodybob
"The ITO based crowd" & their consultants sure have been putting up a fight alright. So have the shorts on
UNXL (& over at NEON). In fact, many ITO producers are selling at cost because they know they can't price-
compete with metal mesh, & Uni-Pixels' copper useage & it's ROLL-TO-ROLL process.

Phil in OKC -
I found this article informative and accurate. I wish I had listened to all the short articles back when I bet the farm at
$40. Instead, my greedy little slef listened to the bulls and it cost me 10's of thousands of dollars. Lesson learned.
Finally sold the last few thousand shares at $7 and moved on. No regrets, just consider it a "tuition payment" in the
school of had knocks!


11 Apr 2015, 09:46 AM


the guy who
Phil, I'm sorry to learn of your losses. However, as so many of us have learned in this market place, timing IS
everything.


13 Apr 2015, 01:00 PM


Phil in OKC -
tgw,


No need to be sorry for me. I learned a very valuable lesson. In the words of the late great Benjamin Graham,
there is a big difference between an "investor and a speculator!" It was a valuable lesson, though somewhat
expensive "tuition" in the college of hard knocks, that has saved me even greater losses over the years
whenever that little devil called "greed" (who sits on my shoulder and whispers sweet nothings into my ear)
tries to get me to squander my capital on other "speculative" opportunities.


14 Apr 2015, 07:51 PM


bullchin
Stock moved up without any news and low volume means opportunity to short again. New management haven't
talked about QA yet so they are still off from production and sales....Their cost structure of making non ITO film has
increased but haven't told investor or kodak yet because they are still trying to make one...lol


11 Apr 2015, 11:29 AM


Timothy Conway, Contributor
I'm not long this stock and may consider going short, but just a cautionary for shorts: yesterday (Friday) the s/price
spike blasted through the descending Parabolic-SAR indicator on the T.A. chart and triggered a shift from "sell" to
"buy." So UNXL shares may continue to rise a bit (perhaps to the low 7.50s as happened intraday on March 9) before
reversing down.

The chart is also showing the upside down lucky rabbits foot pattern which means it's time to go long and
then short and then long again before liquidating your account at a loss and finding another hobby.

What a desperate attempt to hold down the price. Unfortunately for those who are really behind this article, I don't
think anyone who really follows this technology believes a word that's said in this hit piece. Hawthorne has been
exceptional in his tenure so far, and has given me no reason to question a word he says. Exciting times ahead for
UNXL for sure.

To the author: The fourth bullet point of your summary and the table of EV/Sales comparisons later in the report are
not convincing. Enterprise Value (EV) is market value plus debt less cash, which for UNXL at UNXL’s closing price of
$6.77 on Thursday, April 9, the day before your report was first sent to your subscribers at 10:04 am Friday, April 10,
was approximately $60 million (market cap of $83.6 million plus debt of zero, less cash of $23.7 million (at 12/31/14).


EV/Sales ratios are usually calculated using TTM sales or current annual rates of sales. For UNXL, current sales are
zero, so on that basis, its current EV/Sales ratio is infinity.


To overcome that, you have used the consensus expectation of $52.75 million in sales for 2016 to calculate UNXL’s
EV/Sales ratio, which ratio you find is 1.17 (which is close to the 1.13 one gets using an EV of $60 million based on
the closing price on April 9). BTW, I know the table says the numbers in it are from Bloomberg, but they are in YOUR
report, so you own them.


Your choice of 2016 is arbitrary. Had you used the sales consensus of $10.95 million for 2015, UNXL’s EV/Sales ratio
would be 5.64 instead of 1.17. Had you used the sales consensus of $105 million for 2017, UNXL’s EV/Sales ratio
would be 0.59 instead of 1.17. That 0.59 for UNXL for 2017 would be less than or close to the EV/Sales ratios of 0.58
for TPK and 0.94 for O-film Tech shown in your table for 2016. From the table, we cannot calculate EV/Sales ratios for
TPK or O-film Tech for 2017 because we don’t know the consensus sales estimates for those two companies for
2017, but I’m confident those ratios would not be substantially lower than the 2017 ratio of 0.59 for UNXL.


Why are the EV/Sales ratio comparisons better for 2017 than for 2016? Because UNXL’s year-over-year sales growth
in 2017 is expected to be 99%, or several times greater than is likely for TPK or O-film Tech. On the basis that UNXL’s
expected annual growth rate is several times greater than for the other two companies, I argue UNXL’s shares are
substantially undervalued, instead of overvalued.


There’s another way to look at valuation. The share price is the product of the P/E multiple times the earnings, which
earnings, in turn, depend on the profit margin on sales. If in 2017, UNXL’s net margin on the expected $105 million in
sales is, say, 10%, its net earnings would be $10.5 million. Based on the current 12.35 million shares outstanding, that
would be EPS of $0.85, which would make the P/E on the closing price of $7.26 on Friday, April 10, only 8.5. That’s a
low forward P/E for a company expected to expand sales from zero to $11 million this year, to grow sales by 382%
next year, and to grow sales by another 99% the following year.

The fact is, UNXL’s share price is based on earnings expectations, not on its expected EV/Sales ratio on estimated
2016 sales. There is substantial uncertainty about those earnings expectations at the moment, on both the sales and
margin sides, which is why the forward P/E for 2017 based on those expectations is low. On the other hand, if those
expectations are even partly realized, the upside for the stock will be large. Thus your opinion that UNXL “is currently
valued as if full-scale production in 2016 were a certainty” is wrong.


The bottom line is that a comparison of EV/Sales ratios between a development company with no current sales but
expectations for large sales and large sales growth rates in the future and established companies with relatively slow
sales growth rates is not meaningful or useful for assessing stock valuations. What is meaningful for assessing the
stock valuation of a development company is the probability that consensus expectations will be realized or
exceeded. On that point, opinions will differ.


One more thing: At 10:05 am yesterday morning, Friday, April 10, UNXL hit its low share price for the day of $6.67.
That low for the day was one minute after you released this negative report to your subscribers at 10:04 am. One
minute after you released this negative report, UNXL’s shares started going up strongly on sharply increased volume.
The shares ended the day at $7.26, up 8.8% from the time you released your negative report and up 7.2% on the day,
despite this negative report that you published twice yesterday – first to your subscribers at 10:04 am and second on
Seeking Alpha, at 3:21 pm. One wonders why the stock went up so strongly after your negative report was published.
In the past, negative reports have usually caused the stock to go down.

Not Street Sweeper's unless you are talking about the distant past. Once upon a time Street Sweeper was an
effective short seller who outed fraud and misconduct in the stock market. Today, Street Sweeper is largely
ineffective. Why? It's a different author (this author) who posts most of the content. It's not even close to as
good as Muddy Waters, Pump Stopper, Citron, etc. It's like comparing little league baseball against the
Yankees.


There are algos that track short report authors. My guess is whomever programmed the algo figured out that
Street Sweeper is a negative signal, so they buy on Street Sweeper reports instead of sell. Recently
speaking, that's probably a good strategy.

Good article, but doesn't have much value. If someone still thinks that this company has any value, he has left reality
totally. He will not believe this article.
