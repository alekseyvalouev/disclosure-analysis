by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Shares of CYTR and GALE both quadrupled during an undisclosed paid promotion
via Dream Team.


Documents show that CYTR and GALE management edited, changed and approved
the paid articles.


At the peak of the promotion, CYTR issued $86 million in new equity while GALE
insiders sold personal stock.


Over 100 Dream Team articles have been removed from various sites in the past
two days.


At least 13 articles on CYTR alone have been removed from publication.


(Editor's Note: Upon reviewing Mr. Pearson's article, we removed articles from Seeking
Alpha that were in violation of our policies. We take author integrity very seriously and
appreciate Richard's work in helping us identify authors who were in breach of our
contributor Terms of Use.)


Author's Note: At least 13 recent articles covering CytRx have been removed from
circulation at Seeking Alpha, Wall Street Cheat Sheet, Motley Fool and Forbes.
Many were removed in just the past two days. A list of these removed articles is
shown at the bottom of this article. The author has preserved PDF copies of these
articles at MoxReports.com.


In total, more than 100 articles tied to The Dream Team have now been removed
from circulation in just the past two days.


Overview


A few weeks ago I received a surprising email asking me to be a paid stock tout for IR firm
"The Dream Team Group." I was asked to write paid promotional articles on Galena
Biopharma (GALE) and CytRx Corp (NASDAQ:CYTR), without disclosing payment.
Rather than refuse outright, I decided to investigate. I began submitting dummy articles to
the Dream Team rep (with no intention of ever publishing them). My goal was to determine

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 2/122


how involved management from these two companies were in this undisclosed paid
promotion scheme. Below I will provide detailed documentation (emails and attachments)
that indicate management from both Galena and CytRx were intimately involved in
reviewing and editing the paid articles on their own stock at precisely the time they
were looking to sell / issue shares.


Management will have a very difficult time convincing investors that "we didn't know." The
articles were provided from Dream Team directly to CytRx and Galena. Management then
edited and approved the articles and would have seen the lack of disclosure. When they
appeared in final publication there was again no disclosure. And it seems no coincidence
that there appears to have been great urgency to get these articles in almost exact
proximity to sales / issuances of stock by insiders and the companies at both Galena and
CytRx.


Many investors are aware that Galena was previously a subsidiary of CytRx and that the
CEO of CytRx also sits on the board of Galena.


The promotional articles and the paid retention of the Dream Team Group were
coordinated with the release of news and data from the companies such that they
coincided with the share prices of both stocks rising dramatically. News events included
items like the completion of Phase 2 trials, the inception of new trials and the receipt of an
SPA from the FDA. Clearly these would all normally be expected to have a positive effect
on their own. Yet management used coordinated articles in the media to interpret and
amplify the effect of the news which it had released.


The promotional campaigns by Dream Team extended to various web sites including
Forbes, TheStreet.com, Motley Fool, Wall Street Cheat Sheet and Seeking Alpha. Multiple
aliases were used, some of which pretended to be hedge fund managers. At least 13
articles on CytRx alone have now been removed, most of those during the past two days
alone.


The undisclosed media promotions coordinated with the release of news and data saw
both of these stocks rise from around $2.00 in November to around $8.00 by January. The
fact that these recent news releases were concurrent with undisclosed stock promotions
casts significant doubt on many of the fundamental statements made by these companies
regarding their drug prospects.


Below I include a review of Federal Securities Laws Section 17b (regarding touting) and
Section 10b(5) (the anti-fraud provision). Given that the recent equity offering from CytRx
occurred on the back of this undisclosed promotion, it creates the potential that the

proceeds from the offering may be at significant legal risk. Investors who bought into the
offering at $6.50 are already well underwater. They may find these promotions to have
been very disturbing in the context of their flagging investment.


Broader awareness of these issues could see the share prices of both CytRx and
Galena trade to well below $2.00, back where they were when the promotions
began.


Preliminary notes


Note #1: Shortly prior to publishing this article, the author notified the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission about the details described herein. Portions of this
content were also shared with media outlets including Seeking Alpha, Wall Street Cheat
Sheet and TheStreet.com which had previously published articles by Dream Team writers.


Note #2: Prior to publication, the author contacted CytRx Corp, Galena Biopharma, and
Michael McCarthy of Dream Team Group. Their responses are noted in Appendix II.


Note #3: During the course of this investigation I have exchanged dozens of emails with
individuals who admit to promoting CytRx, Galena and other companies in exchange for
undisclosed payments. I have included copies of some of these emails as links below.
These should be read from bottom to top so as to be read in chronological order. In some
cases, certain personal information including email addresses and phone numbers have
been redacted and are displayed as XXXXX in red font. The author also has numerous
additional emails which he is still processing and which have not been included in this
article.


Note #4: Before I undertook any of this, I first sent an email to a neutral 3rd party and to
my attorney letting them know about this experiment and putting into advance writing the
fact that at no time would I ever publish any of these articles nor would I accept any
compensation. This was for my own protection. I strongly discourage readers from
engaging in this type of research on their own.


Note #5: Dream Team also operates via a sub-brand called Mission IR. I have used
Mission and DTG interchangeably throughout this article. Mission IR is a frequent poster
of messages at Investors Hub. Their page on Investors Hub provides a list of companies
for which they have recently been engaged. (It also includes several obvious decoys such
as Facebook and Twitter).


Background

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 4/122


A few weeks ago I received an email and subsequent phone calls asking me to be a paid
stock tout for an IR firm called The Dream Team Group ("DTG"). The sender first informed
me about an article he wanted on CytRx Corp., and later asked for additional articles on
Galena Biopharma, among others.


This was a notably odd invitation for me to receive given that I generally write very
negative articles focused on inappropriate (and sometimes what I view as illegal) behavior
by US-listed companies and their promoters. It was clear that the individual contacting me
had not even bothered to read what I have written in the past. He clearly had no idea what
he had just stumbled into by contacting me of all people.


The individual ultimately revealed his name to be Tom Meyer. He later informed me that
the IR firm he works for was the Dream Team and that he worked closely with the head of
Dream Team, Michael McCarthy. In his initial emails and in subsequent phone
discussions, I was offered $300 per article, but was also told that there were two
conditions. First, management of the companies would have to sign off (and edit) the
articles. Second, I would not be allowed to disclose that I was getting paid.


Hi Rick,


Thanks for getting back to me so soon. I work for an IR firm and I have a team that I
manage. So when the firm has a new client, they will ask me to start getting some
articles published on various sites. And then my team will get started on it.


We typically cover biotech companies but occasionally will have some others as
well.


When I give you an assignment, you will type up the draft and then send back to me
so I can get the company's approval. I will send you back the edited version and
then you can publish. Once published, I will pay you $300. We send checks to our
guys every 2 weeks.


Let me know if that is of interest to you.


Thanks a lot,


Tom


I was told to not worry about posting on Yahoo message boards, because DTG has a full
team which handles the posting of numerous bullish messages on places like Yahoo
Finance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 5/122


I felt that there was a lot of information to be uncovered if I dug deeper. So rather than
immediately make my findings public, I chose to fly to Chicago to meet Mr. Meyer in
person and then submit a series of "dummy articles" to him to see what response I could
get. (At minus 20 degrees, Chicago was actually 100 degrees colder than Los Angeles
during my visit!)


My goal in submitting dummy articles to DTG was to determine the level of involvement of
management of these companies in reviewing and editing articles. To me, this was of far
greater significance than the (already troubling) non-disclosure by various authors and IR
firms who might be getting paid. As a result, I submitted dummy articles to Tom / Dream
Team on both CytRx and Galena as well as a few others.


With CytRx I was able to receive fully edited copies of the dummy articles which
bore the electronic signature of the VP of Business Development (David Haen) as
well as by the Assistant to the CEO (Lauren Terrado). The conclusion I reached is
obvious: management at CytRx was intimately involved in editing these documents
extensively.


With Galena, I was told that the company suddenly changed its mind and cancelled the
article on February 10th, almost immediately prior to an exposé article by Adam
Feuerstein at TheStreet. Based on this, I am under the assumption that Galena backed
out from wanting an article from me as a result of Mr. Feuerstein calling them just before
publishing his article. In any event, the offer of payment still stood from Tom/DTG as
compensation for my time.


The writers and their aliases


Throughout the course of our discussions, Mr. Meyer discussed with me an additional
writer who writes for him on CytRx and Galena. His name is John Mylant. Mr. Mylant
writes for both Seeking Alpha and for TheStreet.com and has published 3 articles on
CytRx and 1 on Galena. (Note: these articles on CytRx and Galena have since been
removed from Seeking Alpha.)


Via email and phone I was able to confirm with Mr. Mylant that he was paid by DTG to
publish articles on CytRx and GALE and that management had signed off on them
because that is what they are paying for. In addition, confirming the involvement of Mr.
Mylant should not prove to be too difficult given that DTG does require its writers to fill out
a form W9 for tax purposes. Mr. Mylant's only complaint seems to be that DTG only pays
him $300 which is well below his standard rate for the other IR firms he works for which
pay $525 per article.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 6/122


From Mr. Mylant on February 21st:


Dream Team people do only pay $300. I actually stopped working with them. The
work I did for [XXXXX] was through another company wasn't with them. I am not
sure who you talk to their work with Dream Team, but some of the articles that I saw
were very second rate articles and really can work trying to get people to buy into
the company. Very poorly written. Dream Team were the only ones that paid that low
to me. When I told people I charge $525, they didn't blink. I only wrote for Tom you
times because he just didn't pay enough and I thought the company was very shady.


Note: information regarding other companies which could not be verified has been
redacted until 3rd party verification can be obtained.


The links to the emails above make it clear that Mr. Mylant had been working for
Dream Team and had published on both Galena and CytRx for Dream Team.


Together, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Mylant have published 13 articles on CytRx since November,
some of which had a very dramatic impact on the share price. In addition to doing much
writing, Mr. Meyer also appears to have served as the go-between for Michael McCarthy
(head of DTG) when coordinating the writing of other authors such as Mr. Mylant when he
wrote on Galena.


On February 6th, I asked Mr. Meyer the following:


on GALE, I thought that John Mylant did a great piece this week, but he did not
address the short attack. did the company approve his piece ?


To which Mr. Meyer responded:


John wrote his article before the short piece came out. It was published after but
written before. The company just took a long time to approve it. Wouldn't have
been fair to make him go back and add something else.


He's been working for me 4 months or so. He's pretty good, gets things written
pretty quick.


GALE is just slow my friend. I chatted with Michael last night and they're still
pending. I can't make them approve when I say, it's up to them unfortunately.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 7/122


Mr. Meyer writes under many aliases, some of whom purport to be hedge fund managers.
For example, at Wall Street Cheat Sheet, his bio for "Christine Andrews" states that:


Christine is an analyst and fund manager with almost 20 years of investment
experience. She covers a variety of industries, with a special focus on technology,
and likes to write about value stocks, poorly understood or under-followed situations,
and contrarian perspectives.


The fictitious Ms. Andrews also has had a bio and one article at TheStreet.com. (Note:
The article posted by the fictitious Ms. Andrews at TheStreet has since been removed
from circulation.)


Mr. Meyer also uses the Wall Street Cheat Sheet where he uses the aliases James Ratz
(also a supposed LA hedge fund manager), Christine Andrews (shown above) and John
Rivers. He also uses his real name there under Tom Meyer to write articles about CytRx.
(Note: Wall Street Cheat Sheet's contributor program was a beta program with just 12
contributors. The site has now removed all articles that it has linked to Dream Team
writers, including on CytRx and Galena.)


Mr. Meyer also has accounts at the Motley Fool under "James Johnson" as well as "Ted
Mayer". (Note: All of his past articles under both of these aliases have since been
removed from circulation by Motley Fool.)


At Forbes he uses his real name, Tom Meyer, but the picture doesn't look anything like the
individual I met in person in Chicago. In December, an article at Forbes sent CytRx
soaring by nearly 50%, from the mid $4s to almost $7.00. (Note: Meyer's articles at Forbes
have since been removed from circulation.)


Finally, on Seeking Alpha he has written under the four names of Wonderful Wizard,
Equity Options Guru, Kingmaker and Expected Growth. (Note: All articles linked to Mr.
Meyer or Mr. Mylant on CytRx and Galena, along with a number of others, have since
been removed by Seeking Alpha.)


In Appendix I, I have included the links to the 13 articles (on CytRx alone) that have been
recently published by Meyer and Mylant, along with the stated name (ie. alias) of the
author where applicable. These are the links as they appear in Yahoo Finance. Clicking on
them simply reveals that they have been pulled from circulation. But it at least allows us to
see when the articles were written along with the promotional titles and the (stated) name
of the author.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 8/122


For those who are interested in reading the actual articles which have been removed, I
have spent the past 6 weeks archiving as many articles as possible on CytRx and other
companies and I have made the originals for CytRx available at MoxReports.com. I plan
on posting additional archived files going forward.


Promoting the promotion - one step further


An additional feature of interest is that once these articles were published, Dream Team /
Mission IR would then tout the publication of these "independent" articles on its own
website, further pretending that they had been written by independent sources.


For example, on its website Mission IR notes that:


CytRx Corp.'s Aldoxorubicin Demonstrates Blockbuster Potential, Says Motley Fool
Contributor


It was actually an article written by Mr. Meyer under the alias of James Johnson.


A separate post on the Mission IR blog site quotes the "LA hedge fund manager" James
Ratz for his article on Wall Street Cheat Sheet.


Once again, the real underlying author was the same Tom Meyer, who was being paid by
Dream Team / Mission IR but without providing disclosure.


Nearly every article written by a Dream Team author gets quoted on the Mission blog
posts as if they were written by independent authors.


CytRx management was heavily involved in editing the articles


Mr. Meyer sent one of my dummy articles to Galena management, but before they got a
chance to send me their revisions, Adam Feuerstein from TheStreet.com wrote an exposé
highlighting the Dream Team and its paid promotion campaign with Galena. Right at that
time (likely while Mr. Feuerstein was calling Galena), Mr. Meyer suddenly informed me
that he would no longer need an article for Galena. The fact that management had enough
control to prevent publication shows that they knew they were paying for these articles.

Hang tight for a bit on those articles. We're going to let this GALE storm clear the air
for a bit and so we're going to take a break from writing on all symbols for at least a
little while. AF killed DreamTeam in the article and I think Galena may have fired
DreamTeam (not sure on that yet). We're going to pay you for your Galena research
though ($300) once I get your W9. We will pay you for CYTR and [XXXXX] once we
get back to biz and get them published.


This hasn't happened before and is really the fault of GALE management who
basically dumped their shares at the high point. They're idiots and who knows what
will happen to them later on. Sorry for the trouble, just need to let this sh*tstorm
pass.


(Note: Again, references to other tickers within these emails should not be interpreted to
conclusively indicate that these companies had knowledge or involvement in these
promotions.)


For CytRx, on the other hand, he was very eager to get an article published. And
this happened to be in the few days leading up to their equity offering.


CytRx management received my articles and then quickly provided feedback, emailed via
Mr. Meyer. This was presumably done to maintain the appearance that management was
not an active participant and that the process was being entirely orchestrated by Dream
Team.


Changes would be run through Michael McCarthy who runs Dream Team. Mr. Meyer let
me know that CytRx typically provides heavy changes in these paid articles and that I
should not take it personally that their changes to my dummy article were so extensive.
Mr. Meyer told me that it would be VP of Business Development David Haen who made
most of the changes.


On January 29th, I said in an email:


man oh man....those were extensive changes. he basically re-wrote about 25% of
the article.


To which Mr. Meyer replied:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 10/122


Every once in a while a company will be really picky. CYTR is one of them. Our other
companies aren't nearly as bad.


Let me know when you submit.


Thx


In fact, it was easy to confirm who made the actual edits by simply using the "Track
Changes" feature in Microsoft Word. As can be seen in the pdf files below, the changes
were made by David Haen, VP of Business Development and a minor change by Lauren
Terrado, Executive Assistant to the CEO. Changes marked "xx" are changes between the
two versions of the documents I submitted. One was before the equity offering was
announced, one was after.


I include 4 links here which I strongly encourage readers open and read.


Readers should keep in mind that the original document was one that was provided to
CytRx only by me via Mr. Meyer. This can be seen by looking at the term "CYTR_RP" (my
initials) within the filenames at the top of page 2 on the track changes files.


#1 - Entire article with edits made by David Haen


#2 - e signatures for individual edits by Haen


#3 - Entire article with edits made by Lauren Terrado


#4 - e signatures for individual edits made by Terrado


Note: The date listed on the cover page of the PDFs is February 12th, 2014. This is simply
the date on which I printed these files as PDFs. As shown inside, Mr. Haen's edits were
provided on January 29th. Ms. Terrado's were provided on February 3rd. On February 5th,
CytRx announced the closing of the equity offering for a total of $86 million in proceeds.


The conclusions should be obvious.


CytRx management was well aware that these articles are being published. They also
knew that these have been articles via Dream Team / Mission IR. They were also actively
participating in the editing of the articles. Management also should have been well aware
that no disclosure was being made about the fact the CytRx management was paying
Dream Team and the writers for these articles, or about the editing of them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 11/122


During the time of the offering (in early February), Tom Meyer published two bullish
articles on CytRx. To the extent that CytRx management provided edits and paid for
this promotion, it raises the risk that investors in this deal and the investment bank
involved will feel duped with respect to the exercise of the greenshoe during the
offering. This potentially creates the risk that CytRx may not be able keep the
proceeds raised in the offering due to potential legal consequences.


CytRx's connections with Galena


Readers should keep in mind that Galena was originally a subsidiary of CytRx and was
later spun out of the company. CytRx CEO Steven Kriegsman is also a director of Galena
and recently took in nearly $3 million from selling Galena stock in January, before the
recent plunge.


On February 12th, TheStreet.com published an article entitled "Galena Biopharma Pays
For Stock-Touting Campaign While Insiders Cash Out Millions". The crux of the piece was
that two articles on Galena had recently been removed from Seeking Alpha because they
were both posted by one individual using the multiple aliases of Kingmaker and Wonderful
Wizard. TheStreet noted that:


The articles were part of a broader, coordinated "brand awareness campaign"
designed to boost Galena's stock price, according to a document obtained by
TheStreet


TheStreet identified the Dream Team Group as being behind the promotion, pointing to a
$50,000 payment which had (at one time) been disclosed on DTG's website. The
disclosure of this payment has since been removed from DTG's website.


Since that time, a series of lawsuits against Galena have been announced and the stock
is now down by around 40% from where it was before the Feuerstein article. Prior to the
Feuerstein article, Galena had been trading as high as $5.46 and it is now trading at
around $3.20. Also like CytRx, Galena had hit a high of around $8.00 in January.


As the lawsuits against Galena have multiplied, the share price has steadily
weakened. Some of this weakness has crossed over into shares of CytRx, as a
result of the close links between these companies.


At CytRx alone, Mr. Kriegsman has paid himself over $5 million over the past 3 years
($2.8 million in 2013 alone). Most recently, last week he increased his base salary from
$700,000 to $850,000 and (oddly) paid himself a spot "retention bonus" of $300,000. So

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 12/122


even before his bonus in 2014 he will have already made well over $1 million in up front
pay. This is certainly eye popping for a pre-revenue biotech.


Following the heavy media attention on Galena, the Dream Team has removed from its
website disclosure on both CytRx and Galena. But the cached pages from search engines
still show that the amount paid by CytRx to Dream Team was $65,000. The fact that
Dream Team is now removing its own disclosures on CytRx and Galena is telling in and of
itself. It is cause for substantial concern.


And as of now, a growing number of articles covering Galena and now CytRx have been
removed from the media sites listed above. I expect that the legal fallout from this
undisclosed promotion campaign is just beginning.


Looking at the securities laws


For those who are not familiar with US Federal Securities Law, I have included reference
to Section 17b, which deals with paid touting of stocks and the required legal disclosure. I
have also included reference to Section 10b(5), also known as the "anti-fraud provision".
To the extent that management was paying for and editing these articles by supposedly
independent authors, it raises the possibility that these articles can now be considered to
be statements issued by management themselves. This creates the potential that
management could therefore be on the hook for any exaggerated or inaccurate
statements made by these small time paid writers who were aggressively looking to boost
the share prices.


Note: I am not a lawyer nor am I a securities regulator. But I am an individual with a strong
background in the securities industry and I have spoken about these issues with several
securities law attorneys. Based on this information I have reached a number of my own
conclusions in terms of the legal implications of these activities. Readers should come to
their own conclusions. Readers who wish to obtain formal legal advice or opinions should
consult with an attorney of their own who specializes in securities law.


Those who are interested in background information on these types of situations can refer
to this article which details an SEC crackdown on internet stock touting and the laws that
were violated. It is a forceful read and I strongly encourage readers to at least give it a
quick browse.


The article quotes the SEC Director of Enforcement describing actions against 44
individuals and companies as saying:

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 13/122


In all of these cases, the Internet promoters gave ostensibly independent opinions
about Microcap companies that in reality were bought and paid for.


The article includes the following definition of Section 17b.


It shall be unlawful for any person, by the use of any means or instruments of
transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails,
to publish, give publicity to, or circulate any notice, circular, advertisement,
newspaper, article, letter, investment service, or communication which, though not
purporting to offer a security for sale, describes such security for a consideration
received or to be received, directly or indirectly, from an issuer, underwriter, or
dealer, without fully disclosing the receipt, whether past or prospective, of such
consideration and the amount thereof." (15 U.S.C. § 77q(NYSE:B).)


The key point to note is that this Section applies to both direct and indirect
payments which come from an issuer, underwriter or dealer in connection with the
promotion of their stock.


As per their (now removed) disclosure, Dream Team was receiving payments from CytRx
and Galena (the issuers). The writers indirectly received this via Dream Team. From the
documents above it seems clear that the issuer was then well involved in the process via
the editing and oversight.


But this also raises another, much thornier issue. Public companies must generally be
very careful about what they say about themselves in order to avoid violating the anti-
fraud provisions of the securities code. This is section10b(5) which states that:



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B
5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 14/122


Rule 10b-5: Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Practices


It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any
national securities exchange,


(A) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,


To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, or


(C) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would
operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security."


Wikipedia is often a source that should be approached with some caution. However, its
content on 10b(5) is useful.


Here is the problem:


Because CytRx was paying for articles to be written, and because CytRx was signing off
on (and editing) them, it raises the prospect that all of the statements within these articles
will be viewed (for legal purposes) as having been issued by CytRx itself. After all, they did
pay to have these statements made to the public and they did oversee the editing of the
articles.


That means that any mistake or exaggeration by any of these small time authors
could potentially constitute fraud by CytRx management to the extent that the
statements were speculative, promotional or incorrect.


The fact that these promotions then culminated in the sale of securities by CytRx in the
recent capital raise (i.e. an offering of securities) only serves to heighten these concerns.


To me the issues seem quite obvious. But again, I emphasize that I am not a securities
attorney or a regulator, so I encourage readers to evaluate the facts and the laws and
arrive at their own understanding in order to best handicap the odds and magnitude of any
fallout from the items presented above. To the extent that there arise class action lawsuits
against CytRx, those suits will likely do a more thorough job of spelling out the specific
legal issues.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Rule_10b-5
5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 15/122


But what about the cash?


In February, CytRx closed its offering of $86 million (inclusive of greenshoe) worth of new
shares at a price of $6.50. This may appear to give CytRx a decent cushion of safety vs.
its market cap of around $250 million at present.


But to the extent that it is determined that the offering was conducted on the back of an
undisclosed paid promotion, it could create significant legal uncertainty about the
company's ability to keep this newly raised money. If the share price drops sharply,
investors in this deal could potentially file claim that they were defrauded into buying
shares of CytRx near a 4 year high. In fact, the share price has already dropped to well
below the $6.50 offering price and even further below the recent high share price of $8.35.


As a result, I view this "cushion" of around $2.00 per share to be at risk, creating
the potential for the stock to trade well below any perceived "cash floor" of $2.00.


Looking at the share price of CytRx


CytRx is a pre-revenue biotech with multiple compounds in the hopper. It is expected that
results from Phase 3 clinical trials will become known in 3-4 years (2017-2018). But the
problem is that if the company had such stellar prospects, then why would it choose to
conduct a highly inappropriate paid promotion campaign just so that it could raise $86
million in a stock sale?


I take the view that the blatant paid stock promotion itself casts doubt on every other
statement the management has made, including those regarding the prospects for any of
its drug candidates. But readers should make their own decision as to whether or not the
non-disclosure of payments and editing of promotional articles is reason to doubt other
promotional statements.


The most urgent concern is the fallout which can be expected from the SEC and the
NASDAQ in connection with this promotional campaign.


Following the release of Phase 2 data in December, CytRx's share price jumped from as
low as $2.19 to as high as $6.79. But the initial move in the stock was only around 80%.
Yet (as shown below) this was accompanied by 3 positive articles in a row by Mr. Meyer
and Mr. Mylant and the stock continued to soar post-announcement, tripling in 3 days.


However, by December 26th, the share price had fallen back to $4.62.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 16/122


On December 27th, Tom Meyer published an article in Forbes entitled "The Race To
Develop A Brain Cancer Treatment Takes An Interesting Turn". He then quickly published
another article on Seeking Alpha (under the alias Equity Options Guru) entitled "CytRx
Corporation Poised For Success In 2014". Within days the stock had risen to a new 52
week high at $6.90, another increase of nearly 50%. (Note: Both of those articles have
since been removed from circulation.)


The point is that these various articles demonstrably had an enormous effect on the
share price.


The following graph shows the CytRx share price since November along with orange dots
to show when the 13 articles were published by Meyer or Mylant.


Looking at the fundamentals at CytRx


So far I have deliberately refrained from providing any analysis of the fundamentals at
CytRx, including the prospects for their compounds in FDA trials. Based on the facts
presented above, it is the stock market promotion that has dominated the share price
action, bringing the stock to multi-year highs.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 17/122


CytRx is held just 26% by institutions, implying a high ownership by retail investors. The
promotions (via at least 13 paid articles) were well underway prior to the release of Phase
2 data in December, such that the release of that data likely had a greatly exaggerated
effect on the share price.


Readers should keep in mind that drugs do not "pass" Phase 2 trials. It is the decision of
the sponsor (ie. CytRx) whether or not to proceed to Phase 3. The FDA would certainly
halt a study if it was deemed to be dangerous to the patients enrolled. But the FDA would
not otherwise rule on effectiveness or stop a trial at Phase 2.


Aldox was recently given Special Protocol Assessment. However, this is simply the FDA's
way of saying that the study design is rigorous enough that the trial will not be rejected
based on study design alone. It is categorically not an expression of confidence in any
expected results themselves and it is not an expression of confidence in the drug itself.


The point I am trying to make is that these findings should not be viewed either as strong
positives or strong negatives for CytRx. Yet a review of the various paid promotional
articles shows that they have portrayed the "passing" of Phase 2 and the SPA designation
as being very strong positives which supposedly make ultimate success much more likely.
This is wrong.


Adam Feuerstein speaks and Tom Meyer rebuts


On December 16th, it was once again Adam Feuerstein who wrote an article entitled
"CytRx Directors Are $3M Richer With Well-Timed Stock Option Grants". He made two
main points.


First, CytRx directors had approved option grants for themselves almost immediately
before the release of the Phase 2 data which sent the stock price soaring. As a result,
they netted millions of dollars in gains within days.


Second, the actual underlying data beneath this Phase 2 trial was far less compelling than
it appeared on the surface. For some reason patients in this trial had a 0% response rate
for tumor shrinkage with the legacy drug doxorubicin. This is unusual in that dox is
considered the standard treatment for sarcoma patients. A 0% response in this control
arm provided a very strong (apparent) boost for CytRx's aldox.


Feuerstein also notes that more than 60% of the patients enrolled in CytRx's aldox study
were in India, Romania, Russia and Ukraine, implying that accuracy may not be as high
as for a study which had been done primarily in the US and/or Western Europe.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 18/122


Mr. Meyer responded in a rebuttal article on Wall Street Cheat Sheet (using his own name,
but not disclosing payment or editing from CytRx) in an article entitled "Inaccurate Article
Sends CytRx Shares Lower".


Mr. Meyer noted that:


Unfortunately, an inaccurate report was published on Monday, December 16, by The
Street's Adam Feuerstein. The report contained several inaccuracies, which caused
shares of CytRx to sell off by more than 10 percent.


Mr. Meyer makes the point that the board had previously met in December 2012 with no
spikes in the share price at that time. He also notes that 30% of the trial participants were
from the US. Mr. Feuerstein apparently included participants from Hungary into his
Eastern Europe calculations. This should only total 58% from those countries, not 60%.
Mr. Meyer also includes a very detailed analysis of the underlying statistics which would
appear to have required a PhD in biology and clinical statistics for anyone to have written.
(Note: the rebuttal article by Mr. Meyer has been removed from circulation but I have
stored a saved PDF copy of it here.)


As always, Mission IR then posted on its website a highlight of these corrections to the
described inaccurate Feuerstein article, quoting Mr. Meyer, but not disclosing that he was
being paid or if the content within was coming from CytRx management. So Mission
basically quoted someone who was quoting someone who was paying them to
quote them.


Again, I take the view that the fallout from the promotion will dominate the equation in
determining the share price of CytRx. This is because Phase 3 trials are unlikely to be
completed before 2017-2018 and the current cash balance following the $86 million equity
offering may be in jeopardy due to the paid and edited stock promotion.


As a result of these factors, it is difficult to determine just how low the stock will trade. But
due to the risk on the cash, there is the possibility that the stock trades back below $2.00.


Asked about the timing of articles coming out in conjunction with a stock offering by
CytRx, Mr. Meyer had this to say:


I had a long conversation with Michael about it. I don't like the fact that the company
wanted your article out before the offering. I explained him to that it would make the
writers look bad and he agreed. He had a conversation with the company about it.

Appendix II - responses from McCarthy, CytRx, and Galena


I did speak with Michael McCarthy by phone and asked about his relationship with Mr.
Meyer, Galena and Cytrx. I also asked about the payments to authors and the editing by
Galena and CytRx. His only response to a series of questions was "I am unable to
comment on that at this time." He repeated that answer verbatim to each question asked.


I also spoke to David Haen who provided the edits to the dummy article I sent. He initially
stated that CytRx had stopped using the Dream Team several months ago, "when the
stock was a $2.00 stock". (Note: that would be back in November, which is when the
campaign appears to have begun, not when it ended). When I pressed further he stated
that it might have been "earlier this year". As I discussed the editing of documents with
him, he noted that CytRx may have provided "some new or original content" to writers but
that he felt most of it was for editing for accuracy. Readers can refer to my attached edited
dummy article and to the comments which came from Tom Meyer's emails to make their
own determination about the extensiveness of Mr. Haen's changes. I did inform Mr. Haen
that I would be writing an article on this topic and gave him the opportunity to provide
comment.

wow, richard. let's take a look at your track record. i guess we could start with your shorting of KNDI, at around the 5
or 6 level, then again another point or two higher. Recently the stock hit 20. You seem to be very myopic. You said
you will not comment on the trials of cytr - that's because there's nothing negative to comment on. the results were
spectacular. So the stock was pumped. if 65k dollars got forbes and other huge finanicial pub. to promote those trial
results, i'd be shocked, wouldn't you? HOW MUCH STOCK OF CYTR HAS BEEN SOLD BY INSIDERS since the run
up? ZERO. Why is that? So where do you sit with KNDI now?


13 Mar 2014, 09:57 AM


Keith Stokes, Contributor
Exactly what I was thinking, if the stock was pumped why would all insiders hold and not sell after the surge?
Stock run all started after phase II results, the pull back was profit taking and the next surge was more buyers
entering. Don't see the correlation to the articles as they were posted in the 2s with no such effect.

Not every scam is a P&D...sometimes they borrow money against their stock. Other times they use the pump
to do an offering to refill company bank accounts. Regardless. Paid promotion is always a sign of a scam.

Keith,


Ahn said that they had a 9 month window where they couldn't sell stock due to the Mills acquisition in
process. That culminated on Jan. 13th. Mills was acquired then. Risi and Kriegsman made their first sales on
Jan. 17th, then Ahn 10 days later, and other sales after that. I don't see them holding, but selling soon after
Mills was acquired.

Re: "Paid promotion is always a sign of a scam." - not so. Many smaller companies find it necessary to
publicize information about their company, just as a small software development company might advertise,
partly to support and attract investors. Current investors who feel that management is not doing enough to
promote their investment in the company will complain to management and threaten to stop supporting the
company.


Even a prospective investor might only invest if the company boosts their stock value by agreeing to a paid
promotion campaign.


17 Mar 2014, 12:24 PM

@wizerdave - Actually yes, it is always a sign of a scam. Not the only one, but a sign for sure. Real
companies, with good management simply do not use paid touts. Period.


Investors that will only invest if the company engages in paid touting are just penny stock hucksters, not
legitimate professional investors. Wake up!

Want to bet on that? You might be surprised at what mega companies do. Bigger companies don't call it "paid
touting" they just call it PR and spend millions on PR every year.

The Bondman, Contributor
I'm not going to defend big corporate practices because they have enough of their own ethical issues.
However, with respect to small companies, with little or no revenues, no real products and thinly traded
stocks, there is a widespread practise of engaging firms, like the DTG group for obvious purposes. While
nothing is 100% its ALMOST ALWAYS a sign of a scam. True large companies provide information to equity
analysts, guide earnings and information and of course try to promote a positive view of the company (thats
what investor relations departments are for), companies that engage groups like the DTG ALMOST ALWAYS
have the characteristics listed above that make their equities extremely volatile and susceptible to
manipulation. You can excuse Mr. Ahn's sale of stock 50 ways from Sunday using whatever justifications you
want but no true manager, who believes in his product and its chances for approval, is going to take
anywhere close to the amount of stock/options he took off the table. That ALWAYS is the biggest red flag of
all. What comes out of his mouth is trivial as compared to how he voted with his wallet. Amazing to see the
longs in this for the long haul while the CEO spills his ownership stake.

Oh you mean like a hedge fund manager tweeting that he has personally talked with the head of Apple
suggesting that increasing the dividend should go higher and then watching the price of Apple stock soar.

Last I checked that was not a violation of any law and the SEC is not investigating activist hedge fund
managers for trying to goose companies into unlocking value. How does this situation compare if at all? Here
we are talking about a company hiring paid stock touters (who have no formal training in securities analysis or
investment management). I fail to see the connection.

Not every scam is a p&d by purely by insiders.


CYTR sold 13.23mm shares at $6.50 & GALE insiders sold millions of $ worth of stock. These are clear facts.

Still no comment from shorts on the value of the companies' (CYTR or GALE's) drug development successes,
which should be all that matters. Developmental stage companies are such easy targets for shorts - as long
as they don't have to talk about facts that matter.

The BIG question -- how many commenters here are paid shills?? There's enough black & white comments
from relatively new to SA, to make me wonder.


If someone does research, buys long, then posts a detailed article... that's considered normal and fine. This is
the same thing. Richard did research, invested accordingly, and is now sharing his investment & information. I
would have preferred the short position was the first sentence in additional disclosures, but it is in there.


Now if he'd posted this article, then bought after it went down from it without disclosing -- then posted a
pumping article claiming he had a position... that'd be an immoral pump and dump. So unless he's recently
posted a pumping article... this is the usual SA & internet model, only using a short instead of long position.


13 Mar 2014, 05:29 PM

I'd like to comment that he just recently published a bullish article on the company on the street. Very fishy if

I had shares in a very small company that actually got FDA approval for a drug for one disease that helped
many people, and ALS patients were claiming improvement of their disease in an additional, promising trial.
But a multi-billion dollar drug manufacturer claimed they violated a patent regarding a manufacturing method.
The courts made the small company stop making the beneficial drug, and they couldn't afford to continue the
ALS trials after that, either. No one seemed to care about the patients.


Same as these vulture attorneys who will be the only ones to make any money in these class actions, if
successful. And also same for vulture shorts who will twist and fabricate news about a company making
cancer drugs hoping to destroy the company for their own gain. I wonder what level Dante would put these
souls in. Maybe the 8th circle of the inferno.

what currently exists. I'd have reasonable doubt right now, that the DTG efforts made any difference.


Ahn and company can lie and deny knowing about the non-disclosure, I wouldn't buy that as a juror, but they
can deny the stock sales were a pump and dump. It's he said, she said. Still reasonable doubt, IMO.

Pretty sure the lack of disclosure is a "strict liability" issue. It need not have done anything to the stock price or
volume. Under strict liability doctrine the very act itself is illegal, regardless of the outcome.

Yes, but if you look at what GALE stock did from Aug 1 through Nov. 6, it was up 1.63% more than the
Nasdaq Index for that time frame. Not significant.


July 30 and 31 looks like they could have made some impact, not sure.


But then, after Nov. 6, it's mostly news releases about legitimate positive GALE catalysts such as the 3rd qtr
Abstral sales viewed in a favorable light, the Folate Binding Protein Vaccine Phase I Trial positive results,
institutions buying into GALE. Then in January, 2014 you've got the Mills Pharma acquisition, a NY Times
Jan. 7 article, the Dr. Reddy's contract, and a Barron's article on the 16th. All of these are catalysts by GALE,
not DTG.

aware of.


14 Mar 2014, 12:02 PM


jsIRA, Marketplace Contributor
Agreed.


Also I could not find anything the management mislead investors. Management promotes their own stock,
nothing wrong.


They made corrections on the articles, nothing wrong.


The only thing wrong was when they publish the article, they need to disclose the relationship, whether or not
it is paid, etc.


On the other hand, all short articles should also disclose the same information like this article did (whether
they getting paid, whether they have any relationship with short hedge fund, whether they benefit from the
articles, etc). But few other short article did not.


For me I am more on company's fundamentals. I am holding all my shares on GALE and add more when it
drops. Nothing scares me.

Bryce,


Concur that post-Nov GALE share price increase had more to do about legitimate positive catalysts (i.e.
Abstral, Mills Pharma acquisition, Dr. Reddy's contract, Nuevax Phase 3, etc ...), and less to do with Dream
Team pump & dump schemes. I seem to recall that GALE enjoyed center-stage attention from numerous
third-party analysts (such as Roth Capital, Maxim) during this period with buy recommendations and positive
share price estimates. Does anyone really believe that these guys base their recommendations on paid pond-
scum? I think not!


I’d love to have been a fly on the wall during the Board meeting when the contract with Dream Team was
initially proposed, and by whom? I'd like to see GALE restore some credibility by removing the Board
member(s) who were directly responsible for entering into such a risky, disreputable business affiliation

the results of the trials speak for themselves, unless you're saying they're doctored. they were spectacular. obviously
you ignore this and move on to a non event about why it was given phase 3 approval. Let's not forget, the results are
what they are 2) there were 14 mm warrants conv at 4.10 a/o 12/31/13 - so i'm quite certain , with this nice profit (now
dwindling fast) ppl were cashing in - giving the co. even more of a bankroll, and 3) no one from the co. has sold a
share of stock...another KNDI and NEON in the making. You can publicize all you want and pump all you want, but
spectacular phase 2 result and over 2 dollars a share in cash are where it's at..


13 Mar 2014, 10:11 AM


Dody23
The results don't match other results using Doxorubicin for STS. How could the results from CTYR and their
Independent differ by almost a month? 
Results still were stat sig but this just shows that this management tends to inflate the results to the point in
which it is difficult to believe. 
The results of the next trial will be in 2017 and will cost close to $85 Million. 
That is a long time to wait for a catalyst and in the meantime with negative news coming from all directions,
it's not good for the immediate stock price.

Can you at least read the current conference call? Here are the catalyst for CYTR in 2014: Upcoming Major
2014 Milestones  
• Initiate a global Phase 3 pivotal trial of aldoxorubicin as a second-line treatment for STS in the first quarter of
2014  
• Announce preliminary results from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of aldoxorubicin in Glioblastoma
Multiforme in the second half of 2014  
• Initiate a global Phase 2b clinical trial of aldoxorubicin as a second-line treatment for small cell lung cancer
(SCLC) in the second half of 2014  
• Announce OS results from its ongoing global Phase 2b clinical trial of aldoxorubicin as a first-line treatment
for STS in the second half of 2014  
• Expand the oncology pipeline by combining our novel linker platform technology with additional
chemotherapeutic agents

In the end, it's up to the companies' fundamental that matters. While Dream Team's involvement is arguable, it's no
different from any writers writing articles to strengthen their own positions (you, for example), or getting paid to write in
favor of a certain group (again, you for example), and all these are eventually going to be noises (whether bear or
bull) before the next quarterly report.


13 Mar 2014, 10:17 AM


The Frugal Norwegian, Contributor
ummmm....not quite vanebfbc...managemenet can make or break a company and it appears that CYTR just
might be breaking. The case appears to be pretty strong that they broke SEC regs. Good product with bad
management usually results in a company heading towards zero over time.


13 Mar 2014, 05:00 PM


vanebfbc
Yes and no. Management does affect a company to some point, but an incompetent management team can
be elected out by the shareholders, while the results of research and experiment will stay. In the case of
CYTR and GALE, since both have solid clinical outcome, they will not go to zero, though the short term stock
price is expected to be volatile.

You also need to learn some manners. There is no legitimate reason to put quotation remarks around

piece of investigative journalism, whether or not the author benefits from it (why shouldn't he?), and whether
or not the effect of it conflicts with the interests of your long investment, which you have been cheerleading
about in numerous posts.

I am a very small trader of pharmaceutical and biotechnological stocks. I think that is referred to as a "retail" trader. 
With over 30 years pharmaceutical, medical device, and biological regulatory affairs, documentation, etc. (working for
two major pharmaceutical companies), I stick to what I know something about. 
I also keep a spread sheet of relevant information and catalyst dates for approximately 75 companies. This
information comes mostly from internet postings (FDA websites, company websites, stock articles, etc). 
I do not proclaim to be an expert, just someone who made a decision to by a particular stock. 
My advise to traders such as myself is: These companies are volatile, things can change rapidly, and the companies
always want to look successful - so read as much as you can, both positive and negative - then make your decision.
But the bottom line is that you can loose or sometimes gain (nicely), but there are no guarantees.

Volte-Face Investments, Contributor
The actual drug is the least of the issues if this article is correct. Certainly for Seeking alpha itself to remove articles is
not typical.


The breach of securities laws, if proven here to some legal authority's satisfaction, could be lethal to the company.


The legal risks here for a development stage company are enormous. Having a major equity raise and insider sales
concurrent with these activities as outlined above will have Management spend far more time and money from here
forward dealing with lawyers than scientists. At least that seems highly likely to us.


An amazing investigation Mr. Pearson.


13 Mar 2014, 10:30 AM


Meltdownman
Bottom line, does the drug work or not? That IS the issue. That is was investors want to know and most
certainly the patients being treated.


To put it into perspective, a multimillion dollar lawsuit over 300 dollar articles is the least of the issues. Apple
pumps out promotional articles every day. Unfortunately small biotech firms can't afford an entire staff to do
this. It is all word of mouth in the industry as to who to obtain for IR purposes. Incestuous perhaps but they
have a limited budget and unfortunately the best firms are not always chosen.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha

Interesting article, however you did not disclose much about Galena's pipeline, and or acquisitions, which should
certainly add value to the Co, any particular reasons for this slant ? 
This article reminds me of your OPK article on SA last April/13 advising your readers to short the stock, when its SP
was @ $7 only to see it rise to $12.95 by October/13. 
keep up the great work!

As a CYTR long, I want to know two key questions: 1. are these paid articles contain inaccurate information? 2. Are
CYTR management sold into the "pump" stock price? If there is no "dump". where is the crime?

The dump may have been planned but unfortunately caught before it reached.

CYTR stock price stayed above $6 for almost a month. That is not enough time for the management to sell
some shares?

This may be much ado about nothing. Galena could be in trouble only if 2 things are true: 1) they told the authors not
to disclose they were being paid. The fact that the authors made no disclosures is their problem, not Galena's.
Unless, of course, it can be shown Galena told the authors (or DreamTeam) not to disclose.


2) Materially false information was disseminated which affected the stock price. I have seen nothing to validate this.
All this is is hype about a stock and a company. Let the reader beware. If people bought based on hype, but not
materially false information, that is their problem. "Reader beware."


Ironically, all this editing by management at the two companies tells me that they were extremely careful to make sure
that no materially false claims were being made in these articles. One of the reasons that I sold between $4-$5 is

because nothing I was reading supported this crazy acceleration in price. In other words, I read nothing of any real
substance to support those levels. It was fluff. Fluff is very different from materially false information. I strongly
suspect nothing will come of this in terms of tortious liability. Focus on the data as it comes out. That is all that
matters.

False persons used media outlets to release truthful information about Galena to an unsuspecting public. All
was for compensation in order to pump up the stock price.


In my world, you don't release a company to do your marketing until you have approved it, knowing full well
the content of every piece, whether or not the financial arrangement between Galena and Dream Team is
disclosed. Galena knew it wasn't. I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday. Give me a break.


The purpose: to pump up the stock price to an artificially, unsustainable level, at which time you dump your
stock to enrich yourself.


Some of the fake news media marketing can be correlated to the stock price increases. Not sure how much,
but some can be.


Galena knew all this information.

Just like this author you mean


 
The author states the following; 
I began submitting dummy articles to the Dream Team rep (with no intention of ever publishing them). My goal
was to determine how involved management from these two companies were in this undisclosed paid
promotion scheme.


However contrary to what he states above he wrote an interesting positive article on Galena (Jan 27th) on
The Street, roughly 10 days after being contacted by DreamTeam, resulting in the SP of GALE going from
$5.06 on Jan 27th, closing Jan 28th/14 at $5.53

wizerdave
Very interesting! In his article that you reference he says good things about CYTR and GALE, and NWBO - all
of which he or someone from The Street.com have since bashed.


I also noticed that in the current article he downplayed completely any role that the FDA has in endorsing a
company's success when moving from Phase II trials to a Phase III trial. He states that this is entirely up to
the company. Not so. The FDA can stop further trials for several reasons, primarily safety concerns. They are
also intricately involved in the form that the Phase III test takes. And in the article you reference, he said "The
stock also jumped roughly 10% Tuesday when the FDA provided the company with more flexibility in its
administration of aldoxorubicin in its ongoing phase III trial."


I'm keeping my GALE stock. Even if the CEO and others were not wise to sell when they did, and even if the
CEO only exercised options which he turned around and sold, and even if he only sold 20% of his total
holdings because he has a family and wants to diversify (as all financial advisors suggest), none of this
affects the science and clinical results.


Look at ImClone. Yes, the CEO may have gone to prison, if I remember correctly, as did Martha Stewart, and
several others were banned from managing stock accounts or otherwise severely punished for insider selling.
But eventually Erbitux was approved and the company was sold for over $6 BILLION.


Thanks for the info!

The stoke went down before you published the article. somebody mast have known of your short. nothing has

make the company not the story you wrote.

Biotech Dan, Contributor
I am not long GALE or CYTR, but it's very misleading to suggest that the price increase in each company is due
solely to articles written. You are just setting up shorts to be blindsided.


If you want to make a compelling short argument, you need to dispute the data presented. Obviously articles are
going to coincide with data release/catalysts.


Your article suggests article = price increase, whereas a more accurate description would be good data = article =
price increase.

Well written article. This should really be of no surprise to anyone who's played the market. I always go by the adage,
believe 1/2 of what you read and 2/3rds of what you see.


I was told this when growing up. Even before this big scandal I had a cynical eye towards the articles I read on this
website, and other websites.


The stock market is "legalized gambling," and there are associated 'artifacts' that go along with this legalized
gambling.


As anybody who's read seekingalpha should know, you really need to be a doubting thomas when reading the articles
(pro or con) because research could be paid for, research could be incomplete, wrong data...


Caveat Emptor.


P.S.


I still believe in some of the science behind Galena. I could still be wrong though, but then again, some of my
remaining purchases were at the 50 cent range.


13 Mar 2014, 11:01 AM


ripsi_1
Like I said above, caveat emptor.


GALE certainly is a wild ride of a stock and there are some probable ethics violations that need to be
explored. Science and Abstral sales are TBD IMO.


More importantly! Remember who this guy is. Here he states: "The author has not been engaged in any
investment banking transactions with US listed companies during the past 5 years"


Well, 5 years ago, guess what? That was the nadir of the stock market and investment bankers were being let
go by the dozens.


Who got us into the financial crisis in the first place? Bankers, investment bankers and most likely this guy
too.


He's no Mother Teresa and keep in mind his past when he writes about this eye opening investigation.

Can you explain how you can be in contact with federal authorities, the SEC, with information known only to you and

The difference is the disclosure. Evidently that means nothing to most people here, but having GALE/CYTR
pay for, edit, and approve for publishing content they pay an IR firm to do all the while every single one of
those hundreds of pieces NOT disclosing their being paid, is not only extremely ethically dubious, but legally
as well. I can almost guarantee that with this publicity there will be at the very least an SEC inquiry and from
the evidence above I would not be surprised if it then resulted in a full blown investigation. I hope you are still
super confident on the efficacy of their drugs and sales prospects for the pain drug. Can't wait to hear their
response to this.


13 Mar 2014, 11:37 AM


User 4542301
Ross,


I sold my GALE shares this morning after reading enough of this article to know that GALE executives had
been involved in unethical and probably illegal activities. That alone, not considering the legitimacy of their
vaccine, caused me to sell.


I appreciate the work that has been done here, and am frankly in shock right now. Don't know what to make of
it all or comprehend it all right now. But, this author profiting off of as of yet undisclosed private information
just doesn't strike me as ethical.


My research stands on its own. I don't see that the DTG materially impacted GALE's stock price. However,
knowing what has been disclosed in this article, I don't want anything else to do with GALE. So, it looks like I
was wrong about Ahn and company. Live and learn.


Do you think the physicians are in on it too? All those who signed the Phase II trial results, who stated that the
vaccine achieved clinical efficacy within subgroups of the population of patients? That is why I believed in
Neuvax. After this, legit vaccine or not, I don't want any part of GALE.

conundrum.


Actually, I am just wondering why you would sell your stake today, 3 days before earnings? For sure, the back
and forth on SA is tiresome and stagnation of the stock is depressing as well.


13 Mar 2014, 12:36 PM


Ross Klosterman, Contributor
It's hard to say "in on it" or not. Somewhere buried in the other article comments (possibly in the articles
themselves) is a very real "issue" - the docs that participate in these trials clearly *want* the drugs to work.
This is a common thread across the vast majority of drug trials. That's fine - I hope Neuvax is a success and
treats millions of people - but you have to separate "hope" from "reality" when it comes to your money. Reality
is generally learned from difficult circumstances (such as this). You can hope and pray for treatments to work.
Unfortunately, hoping and praying will not make you any more dollars tomorrow than it does today.


I don't recommend this, but go try to "invest" in pink sheets/OTCBB stocks for a couple years, and you'll be
sickened by the amount of lies and manipulation. Although, if you're like me, you won't know it for those 2
years and lose your money that way. Then come back to the big boards and schemes like this will be easier
to understand earlier in the process. Maybe let you exit at 4.50 or even in the 5's when I first tweeted about
Dream Team Group and believe I posted it in the comments here at SA. That was on/around Feb 3/4th -
before Adam F. Article, Enhydris articles, multiple lawsuits, this eye opening piece, and now as a result the
very real *threat* of an SEC investigation.


My couple of sentences of advice for you and anyone else who wants to heed it:


Unless you have a PhD or significant experience in the very specific field of the company you're investing in,
or at least have a few years of general biotech investing experience and SUCCESS, *trade* these tickers,
don't *invest*.


Invest in companies that are easy to understand - aka the boring ones to most folks - and trade the rest, if you
so choose. Also, give more credence to viewpoints the opposite of your own. I personally want *all* of the
negative viewpoints first, because it gives me targets to aim for. If I can't explain or poke holes in every single
one, I stay away. The fact that folks simply ignored DTG involvement and at the same time couldn't dispute
the facts has resulted in many losing quite a bit of money. Hopefully you can come back from this one Don,
you at least do research the co's you invest in. While on the opposite opinion spectrum w/ GALE, the long,
thorough info you provided was valuable nonetheless.


13 Mar 2014, 12:49 PM


Ross Klosterman, Contributor
Also, "private" info is very different than "inside" information. One gives you an edge in investing, the other
lands you in prison. This is a perfect example of the former vs. the latter. Nothing ethically wrong with this. I
do this myself but have simply been on the long side.

enigma,


"Actually, I am just wondering why you would sell your stake today, 3 days before earnings? ?


Thus far, there are three articles on my instablog written by Tom Meyer. Two have been pulled so the links
don't work, and one is under the name, "Ted Mayer", a Motley Fool article from Dec. 10, 2013. So, who knows
how many other articles I have links to in my instablog are bogus? So, did the DTG play a material role in
GALE's stock run up. I don't know, now. The Motley Fool and the Wall Street Cheat Sheet put out quite a few
articles whose dates closely correlate with the stock run up. Until we find out the real identity of all these
people, how does one know?


I believe that Ahn and company approved this trash before it was published. Why would you do that if your
company is legit? And then the stocks sales. It sickens my stomach to think I was involved in aiding this
company. I want nothing to do with it.


13 Mar 2014, 01:02 PM


Ross Klosterman, Contributor
The evidence is above. GALE was *very* involved in the articles that went out (which there are hundreds).
They have a responsibility not only to shareholders but to the Laws of the United States to be sure it was
disclosed. They didn't have to "tell the paid authors not to disclose." The mere fact that they saw the content
and then ignored - whether by accident - ha! - or on purpose - (if proven true in a court of law) is a securities
laws violation.


13 Mar 2014, 01:35 PM


Jim Long
If (and I mean "IF") GALE did edit and approve PR article(s) content, it would be with the contractual
understanding that any boilerplate disclosure language would be the responsibility of the company with which
GALE contracted to handle PR, i.e. The Dream Team (TDT). The fact that GALE did not renew their contract
with TDT can be a solid indicator that upon be advised of TDT's omissions, GALE pulled the plug as a
remedy to terminate any misconception. Not only am I alarmed at how amateurish the original article is but
the fact that there are those who, seem to have little to no business acumen insist on supporting him as the
"Grand Revelatory".


 
Bear in mind folks, Abstral sales are increasing, Nuevax is in Phase III subsequent to successful Phase II
trials, and the management team has an agressive going forward agenda supporting GALE becoming a
growth and value powerhouse. These facts trump any of the allegations postulated by the author.

would turn into authors from the Motley Fool and the Wall Street CheatSheet being employed by DTG also.


I would not be surprised to see GALE officers investigated by the SEC and eventually criminally charged.
Enron couldn't withstand the onslaught of negative press. How will GALE?


13 Mar 2014, 02:34 PM


Rebecca Taylor
Ross, you are correct that clinical investigators (not just physicians, but everyone from PhDs to technicians to
nurses, who interact with patients face-to-face and want them to get well) have an interest in seeing the drug
they are investigating succeed. This is one of the most obvious and well-recognized types of experimental
bias, and it is why clinical trials are "double-blinded" whenever possible. This means that both the
investigators and the patients are "blinded" to which treatment (investigational drug or control/placebo) is
being administered. Implying that the clinical investigators involved in the trials conducted by these two
companies achieved positive results simply because they really wanted the drugs to succeed is misleading
and inaccurate. To further imply that this type of bias is a common problem in clinical trials (a "common
thread" as you said) makes me question your knowledge about how clinical trials and investigational pharma
actually work.

3 days before earnings? Do you realize this type of behavior now calls into question managements practices
with respect to all of its business? Quite frankly I'm surprised the stock is only down 10% and if I had to

"pushing the unethical envelope type behavior".

actually there is nothing in the article that implicates GALE as editing the content of an article. Nor is there
any proof offered that GALE & CYTR paid for "hundreds of pieces". The author spoke with some specificity of
how many articles CYTR "sponsored" that is 13 articles were removed from various web sites. Previous
allegations were that 2 articles pumping GALE were removed from seeking alpha. 
Of more importance to me is did either company provide information that was false or misleading? did either
company direct a writer what he or she was to write about?


Of course this article is troubling but hopefully in the end it will be about the efficacy of the various drugs these
companies have in trials. I guess we could all rise up in righteous indignation (and to some extent we

Enron paid power companies to not produce power resulting in brownouts and sky rocketing prices. And they

a very good analogy.

Even if GALE did commission the articles, which by all evidence seems to be true, how is the information
presented bogus? Ethically questionable actions, yes. Intentionally distributing materially false information as
one of the most followed and traded stocks on the market? I think not. I sold my shares long ago, but just my
opinion. I do not think the executives of the company are dumb enough to do something that is that obviously
illegal and relatively easy to discover.


13 Mar 2014, 04:16 PM

Enron's stock imploded from within, from lack of trust of the Enron executives. I see no difference here. It now
appears that the executives pumped up the stock in order to sell and make a nice profit for themselves. I have
4 links in my blog, thus far, whose content has been pulled, no longer viewable, and there is at least one more
which is by Ted Mayer. Totally bogus news media "pumps". How many more are bogus?


My analogy was to compare the behavior of both company's executives, fraudulent, to enrich themselves. I
see no difference.

I think I would agree with you Rocketman33. But the fraud is the news media used to "pump" the news and

have to assume was to take advantage of the "pump" in order to profit from an artificially inflated stock price.

Ahn denied knowing anything but that DTG was contracted. You don't allow marketing to be released about
your company, unless you have reviewed and approved it, not in my world anyway. I didn't fall off the turnip
truck yesterday.


So, his statement that he sold stock to "diversify" I believe now to be a lie. And the smallest percentage I
could come up with that he sold was 39.5%, not less than 20%.


He and the others need to give back their profit to pay for the losses that I and the rest suffered as a result of

I am wondering how many so called analysts/ reviewers are paid by big companies like Apple and Samsung
to give positive reviews about their products without disclosing any affiliation. This happens more often than
we realize. Newsletters like Motley fool and others survive on their reputation for being good source of advice
for investment.

byrce,


If Ted Myyer forgot to disclose isn't that on Ted Meyer or DTG? Gale may read the article before its published
for content, but it is not the responsibility of Ted Meyer or DTG or motley fool to make sure the disclosure is
present when published?


From Motely fool 
"All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required
to publicly disclose their current individual positions on their personal profile pages on the Fool.com website.
(We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)"


So... if Ted Mayer didn't disclose according to the Fool policy... tha'ts on him.. how would GALE be in trouble
for that... they aren't responsible for enforcing other companies disclosure policies.

In my view this author lost all credibility with me when he stated the following;


I began submitting dummy articles to the Dream Team rep (with no intention of ever publishing them). My goal
was to determine how involved management from these two companies were in this undisclosed paid
promotion scheme.


However contrary to what he states above he wrote an interesting positive article on Galena (Jan 27th) on
The Street, roughly 10 days after being contacted by DreamTeam, resulting in the SP of GALE going from

MichaelJ8,


Of course GALE new what was going on, of course they knew his real name was Tom Meyer (also writes for
TheStreet.com), and of course they knew it was not disclosed that GALE paid the DreamTeam for his
services. Duh.


Don't treat me like a 10 year old, please. I've had experience with how marketing is done, being the
accountant who issued the checks to pay for it. Nothing is down without company approval and everything is
reviewed prior to its release.

Say that the results were doctored to COL Peoples, who led the team in the Army that developed Neuvax. Or
to The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc. that licensed rights to
Neuvax to Galena. Who are they? "They are a not-for-profit Foundation authorized by Congress to support
research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) and throughout military
medicine. Since its founding in 1983, HJF has served as a vital link between the military medical community
and its federal and private partners. The Foundation’s support and administrative capabilities allow military
medical researchers and clinicians to maintain their scientific focus and to accomplish their research goals
effectively and efficiently." (HJF website) I would also ask you to change your profile description to exclude
"objective" because several comments you have made throughout the short attack that has taken place over
the last 6 weeks clearly have lost their objectivity.

how do you "know"... there is no proof. I'm not treating you like a 10 year old... I'm just pointing out that
everything up to this point is nothing but speculation. People are selling, and are angry, and trying to justify
their emotional actions with facts... which aren't facts. All facts up to now are coincidence and only the
speculation suggests illegal activities.


IMO.. the bears saw a coincidence and took advantage of it, and its nothing more than that. All these lawsuits
will go nowhere, just like LINE, the SEC will find nothing wrong with GALE, just like LINE. Unfortunately LINE
overpaid for BRY, which is real, and why I sold.


But I'm holding onto GALE through this nonsense. Actually bought more today. (long options)

"The mere fact that they saw the content and then ignored - whether by accident - ha! - or on purpose - (if
proven true in a court of law) is a securities laws violation. "


It is not merely that management "saw" the articles, they OVERSAW and indeed heavily edited them, none of
which was disclosed. The illegality is clear and obvious. They also obviously knew about the fake IDs and
biographies, since their relation with DTG continued after the first phoney publications (which they themselves
orchestrated).

No proof, yet. I believe there will be. Its' just common sense that GALE knew everything, approved
everything. That's how business works, and how it was in my own work experience. They will need testimony
from the DTG employees. That will come during Discovery and depositions and a trial. A jury isn't going to
believe GALE that they didn't know, I don't think. I wouldn't.

How much more than that they need to convict the executives of something, I don't know. But, it doesn't
necessarily depend upon "proof" or "facts". Skilling and Lay were convicted and I'm not aware that the

Ross Klosterman, Contributor
Thanks for the reply Rebecca. Feel free to question my knowledge how you'd like, but I'm quite confident of
my knowledge regarding the clinical trial process and biotech research. I did state "docs that participate in
these trials clearly *want* the drugs to work" and I can see how easily one would assume I meant their bias
has thus been reflected in GALE and CYTR trials. With respect to it being a response to Bryce_in_tx, I meant
to construe it more along the lines as docs that work closely with same/similar diseases and are well aware of
these trials. Their *want* of trial drugs to work seems to often bias their "professional" analysis of said drug
when made public via avenues like SA. The "doctor(s)" who have made however many articles defending
Galena and Neuvax ignore important inconsistencies brought up by other articles often referred to as short
attacks, bashing, etc etc. Many GALE longs hung their hat on that kind of analysis - esp. Bryce.


I know many true medical professionals staunchly defend the double blinding protocol, and it's a proven
successful and reliable method for unbiased data. That doesn't detract from the inconsistent data in the
Neuvax trials. I will say I haven't spent many hours looking in depth at Neuvax data, as my focus has always
been on the very questionable actions of management that have clearly been outlined here today.


And as for CYTR, I really have no idea about their trials. All I know is they have a toxic member of
management who needs to go. Before I make any investment in a biotech co., the first thing I do is research
the mgmt. Steve would have thrown up many red flags. If your fund is invested in either of these names, good
luck - you better be confident on the science.

Ross Klosterman, Contributor
Wow. I really can't believe some of these comments.


- AAPL et al do not pay analysts to cover their company. This would be blatant securities violation. If they did
pay, it would have to CLEARLY be disclosed. The tons of articles published that GALE paid for, in which they
edited & approved, had no disclosure. It was made to seem as if independent individuals/analysts were
covering the stock. If this is as cut and dry as it seems, each one of those non-disclosures is a violation in and
of itself. Every single one.


- It doesn't matter the content of the articles. DTG could have published a GALE article with one sentence
simply stating the state the company is based in (easily verifiable fact), and without the disclosure of being
paid by the company to write that, they've broken the law (albeit this is an extreme example... doubt much
would happen in this case). Folks need to understand this.

My own personal belief is that Kriegsman is behind the entire hire of the DT. If you do some checking on him
you will see he is a money hungry person. He used the DT for his firm CYTR so he probably told Ahn they
were very effective for his firm he should use them for Galena. Ahn was to busy making Galena into the great
company it is and left this to Thiefman to handle. I would put Thiefman as the culprit. If you check out this
creep you will see ridiculous amounts of compensation he gets from different companies always wanting
more and more. I hope they throw the book at him if he did something illegal. Check out his sales of stock on
Google and his compensation with Cytr.


14 Mar 2014, 08:12 AM


inkyx
gatlingg, I skimmed this article quickly the first time, and this AM read it carefully. This article is not the actual
investigation by the SEC. It exposes the relationship between GALE, CYTR and TDT. As Bryce_in_TX is, I,
too, am disturbed by the relationship. I am still long though. Bryce pointed out he was deceived into
supporting GALE by quoting articles from the Dream Team in his blog. Having a corporation employ such a
disreputable company as the Dream Team didn't seem like such a big deal a week ago, but now knowing the
depth of the relationship and the duplicitous relationship of the information available on GALE makes me a
very reluctant long. I'll stay a few more days, but I'm done with this company.

Ross,


"The "doctor(s)" who have made however many articles defending Galena and Neuvax ignore important
inconsistencies brought up by other articles often referred to as short attacks, bashing, etc etc. Many GALE
longs hung their hat on that kind of analysis - esp. Bryce."


I still believe the science is good. At 18 months the p value was .04 and 65% of patients in Phase II did not
receive optimal dosing. The study states they believe that the vaccine could have been losing its
effectiveness over time and that boosters may restore its effectiveness. That could explain the drop in p value
at the two and three year marks. Seems very reasonable to me. It's not like the vaccine never showed clinical
efficacy. It did.


What I see with the bears is they claim it never worked, which is totally false. And with the p value
approaching clinical efficacy or statistical significance, they still want to believe it is not effective AT ALL,
which I also consider false. So, to me, the bears are trying to paint a black and white picture of the vaccine
which simply does not exist. That is a real problem for me, a lack of objectivity and a bias and desire to view
the results in a distorted manner. It makes me suspect of their motives.

The Bondman, Contributor
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, a management whose ethics are questionable, are capable of
acting in that capacity with regarding to just about any aspect of their business. I personally view any of their
public statements, accounting practices and scientific methods and results as being more likely to deviate
from best practises than normal. There is countless examples both in the biotech arena and just about every
other industry of outright fraud, lies and deception. It will remain to be seen what else if anything is uncovered
at GALE but the first layer of the onion has been peeled and it appears to be rotten.


14 Mar 2014, 11:43 AM


User 4542301
I don't agree with you, Alex, in regards to tampering with the trial results or the accounting. You have
physicians who would have to be in collusion in tampering with trial results. Not just the physicians leading the
trial, but the patients' physicians as well. On the accounting end, you have CPAs, people who have their
livelihood invested in that profession. You don't sacrifice or risk your certification and livelihood for sleaze like
this or anyone.

Neuvax history goes back a long way. The P2 trial was run by Dr. George Peoples of MD Anderson , who in
my opinion is beyond reproach. 
Gale only became involved in 2011. The P2 data is controversial and Gale's stock will, IMO, continue to be
extremely volatile until P3 results prove one way or the other whether Neuvax is effective or not.

That is certainly the way l see it too. 
The bears saw an opportunity to short and make money, and they pounced on it. 
All we seem to have 100% clarity on is the fact that Meyers/ Mylant is the only person that seems to have
committed a fraud, everything else is total speculation and will be extremely difficult to prove in court if and
when it proceeds to that point. 
My educated guess is this will blow over by summers end, and the SP will once again start to show increases
based on legitimate data, which l might add is the reason for much of the past run up. 
l don't believe for a second that one individual working for DTG was responsible for a majority of the run-up, a
lot of legitimate catalysts were also coming out, and basically all he did was spread the news around using
pseudonyms, he did not fabricate any info, and that is basically all Pearson proved with his article, the
remainder of his article is smoke and mirrors.

Bryce. Has it crossed your mind that Galena wanted to have its own IR department proof read the DTG
articles before they were published to ensure that they were factual?


You also may be giving this author, Pearson, too much credibility. For all we know, he was up to his neck in
this whole thing back when he wrote the first article and he is only now claiming that he was purely
"investigating" the whole time.

That's what I have been saying, that GALE's marketing dept. would review the material before being
published, not just to insure it is factual but to insure everything is there as it should be, including the
disclaimer that this is a paid advertisement by GALE, before they would release it. No disclaimer tells me they

The multicenter, randomized, open-label global Phase 2b clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of
aldoxorubicinprogressi... survival (PFS) reported a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression as first-line
therapy in subjects with metastatic, locally advanced or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS). 
The hazard ratio for investigator-read scans was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, range of 0.212 to 0.643) (p=0.0004);
and the hazard ratio for central lab scans was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, range of 0.36 to 0.96) (p=0.034).  
Both the investigator assessment and central lab review showed subjects treated with aldoxorubicin demonstrated
highly statistically significant better clinical outcomes than those receiving standard doxorubicin therapy for STS.
Specifically, both assessments showed an unambiguous 80% to 100% improvement in PFS among patients treated
with aldoxorubicin. 
These are the only clear facts, period! 
If it received the accelerated approval and demonstrate the same efficacy in Phase III trials as that one of Phase II, it
could receive approval in less than 2 years and its price would be well over 20 USD, considering market penetration
for doxorubicin.

If the paid marketing, undisclosed, would be a material factor in whether one would invest in GALE or not,
then I think it crosses a line. Reading and relying on what you trust is independent analysis and opinion is
very different than relying on what you know is not objective analysis and opinion. With one there is trust
thinking this gives weight to investing in the stock, with the other you know it's paid for and not legitimate or
independent.

In order to validate the thesis of this article, we need to know more about the editing of the articles in question. Did the
edits tone down or accentuate the "pumping"? Did the edits add any false information? Did the order to not disclose
come from Dream Team management or was it relayed from the companies in question?


without this information, this article and others like it mean nothing, or at best point out Dream Team's wrong doing,
not the companies in question.

After reading the edits provided by CTRX management, I conclude that many if them toned down the
sensationalist nature of the original document (changing "true" to "known" being the most obvious example),
added in actual science, and in many cases just fixed grammar and poor writing.

Brilliantly done. The saying that you don't want to watch them make the sausage might be an appropriate metaphor.
Many seem to miss the forest for the tree. GALE is not the story. The corrupt process of winning the hearts and minds
of the investment community and the financial implications is the scandal.


It is transparent to me that favorable press exists for the sole purpose of exaggerating (maximizing??) market values
of a publicly traded entity. That premium is extracted from the dim witted and the trusting. America can't be in too bad
shape financially if we can continue to crank out these all-day-suckers anxious to piss away small fortunes on Jack
and the Beanstalk fables.


What ought to really eat at the GALE supporters is the minimum wage touts they were using. $300.....????.

there wasn't an honest person left and they had all been trained to cheat people out of their money. 
You and I both know that this occurs with MANY other companies...you can usually tell by consecutive SA, MF, and
an occasional Forbes article to ice the cake. 
I made some real good money buying CYTX at 2.22 and selling around $6.70. I did not buy back in because the
pumping was ridiculous. I actually look for stocks that have been bashed down that have true potential.  
You NEVER know who is on these message boards, who they are working for and what their true intentions are.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 56/122


It sounds like you could of continued your investigation further if Adam Feuerstein didn't write that pre-mature article
on GALE...I imagine you could of really uncovered some good things about them. 
CYTR has had a couple spin offs, not just GALE. 
David Haen and Kriegsman should be fired....the Board of Directors need to be leaders and get rid of these guys, but
they will take the perception that everyone else does it, we just were unfortunate to get caught. 
There will be lawsuits. David Haen lied to you and he knew it...I have spoken to him on several occasions and he is a
pumper without question. 
The fact that they pumped this up to raise cash was dubious. 
I wish more people would blow the whistle of what goes on underground. 
By the way: Tom Meyer should NEVER be able to write EVER again. 
What is the Deal with SA? Full Name Disclosure should be mandatory on ALL this blog release sites....Forbes, Motley
Fool, Seeking Alpha, and I was surprised by the "The Street" having an author participating in the pumping. This guy
should be fired immediately, but the Street is not a newsworthy source, it is more of a "glorified blog" with bashings
from AF and some pumping by others. 
GALE's actions are flat out Illegal and they will/are in trouble. The entire board of directors and management should
be replaced right now....they flat out robbed shareholders while smiling at in their faces while doing it. They should be
permanently kicked out of the Pharmaceutical field. 
There is a right way to do things and these companies chose the wrong way and David Caen flat out Lied to you and
he knew it immediately...I'm surprised he was dumb enough to say what he did, but when you have verbal diarrhea
you can't help yourself. 
Very Interesting Article...like reading a mystery book with anticipation.

He did not take the $300 not because he is honest. It is because he can make much more money for him and
his clients "short" the stock.

the stock going down..too funny

Eli, If you had done the proper DD on your bloggers you would have uncoveredalot of this noise by the shorts. But
then again it made good publicity for SA didnt it? The fact remains Galena has a great future and it drugs work. All the
rest is noise which your company feeds on for revenues. I would ask the SEC to have your bloggers post not on the
headlines of each companies news events. They are not news events they are tout sheets.

To the longs posting on this board defending these companies:


There seems to be a consistent theme in your arguments-that even if these companies engaged in some pumping
shenanigans, the science is real, and if we all stay patient and let the trials play out, we'll all be rewarded. If that is
your argument....you are really missing the risk here.


You might be right about the science in these two companies. But if the facts presented by the author of this article
are correct (and I'm not assuming that they are at this point)- these companies will never last that long. The
implication is that they manipulated information from supposedly independent third-party analysis....and then profited
personally from the activity. Whether that "profit" is from selling personal shares (GALE) or the timing of a secondary
offering at an inflated price (CYTR), it is no less illegal from a lack of disclosure standpoint. Clinical-stage biotechs do
not have sufficient capital to deal with the potential litigation that may stem from this activity- in terms of investor
lawsuits, as well as regulatory consequences. They will collapse under the weight of those fees, and won't be able to
fund the trials to their conclusion.


My discolsure: WAS long GALE. Sold about half in the 6's; sold the rest today as I will wait for the smoke to clear, still
at a profit with my cost basis around $2. If this is all much ado about nothing, and it's just a short raid as some assert,

If you truly trade biotech. you will understand 90% of small biotech management are bad, dishonest. "failure is

FoolIggy
Richard, truly YOU are to be commended for your integrity, honesty, and effort in producing this document.


I had obtained a very large position in GALE, based on early entry and the fact my wife has BREAST CANCER.


I had hoped, within a couple years, GALENA & its management team would produce revolutionary results that would
control, if not eliminate a hideous disease that would help all our Mothers, Sisters, Wives, and Daughters.


At the same time I will never stop being an activist investor. Even after my first stock purchase, I monitor a company
and its MANAGEMENT TEAM on an almost daily basis.


I never stop asking questions, such as: "Would I provide cash to these individuals and require nothing in return but
their promise to act responsibly?"


Every common shareholder must be an activist because we are the most vulnerable entity in any public company. If
corruption or mismanagement takes over we immediately become the VICTIMS!


People like Carl Icahn prove every day that even the BEST Public Company MANAGEMENT teams can and do lose
site of their responsibility to the common shareholders.


I became suspicious of Galena and its management team when the stock "run up" occurred. Due to the lack of
satisfactory answers to justify this run up, I sold out. I do NOT gloat here. I got lucky because I acted as a cautious
activist. Not having access to the Galena management team, not finding any reasonable answers to my questions in
places like SA, and having no authority to bring attention to my concerns; I did the only thing I could: I sold my shares!


Galena's risk factors have grown exponentially in the last several months and I wouldn't consider a position at any
price.


My prediction is, somewhere down the road, Galena's science will belong to others. Galena and its present
management team will struggle for their lives and reputations based on the number of law firms & potential SEC
involvement that is about to rain down on them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 59/122


I have moved on and found other Bio-Tech firms, like CVM, whose management team has demonstrated a completely
different approach to how they act and view the partnership they have with common shareholders!


To me, CVM's management actions speak volumes about how they will handle "my funds." At the same time, I will
never stop asking questions as I watch this company grow.


Thank you for your article. Thank you for delivering first hand knowledge on what transpired at Galena. My suspicion
is, as the legal process continues, you will be contacted by more than one law firm.


Efforts like yours makes the American Stock Market a very dynamic world where hopefully good effort far outweighs
the bad!

Wow. Excellent article and research. One of the best ever on Seeking Alpha. Unique opportunity to see how sleazy
stock pumpers work.


You'd think CYTR and GALE would pay their sleazy pumpers a bit more to get better quality pump articles. But wait,
since management is doing all the real editing themselves maybe the 'writers' don't deserve to be paid much. lol.


Kudos.

Equitable Research, Contributor
Excellent article Richard. I don't know anything about GALE or the other company as I don't follow the biotech space
very closely but I do know all about shady stock promotion being an internet marketer myself. I've been approached
MULTIPLE times by outfits like you have described through SeekingAlpha private messages and through my internet
marketing company, which specializes in reputation management. I've turned down every offer, despite some being
very lucrative. I like your idea of "playing ball" to gather info then expose these criminals. I'm likely to do the same and
write a similar expose on the next big pump and dump. I had a chance with LOT78 as I was approached through my
marketing company, but instead just politely turned down the work and kept my eye on the stock and made a bundle
shorting it from $25 to pennies. It is just a matter of time before the SEC (or worse) catches up to these criminals. It is
nothing short of a massive fraud. LIVE is one to watch right now using similar promotional tactics, with the same
sketchy past of the shot callers involved with it.

Why not cut out speculation about efficacy and ask the participants in the drug studies if Abstral or NeuVax is
improving their life. Can they definitively say yes or no. Is this permitted by those controlling the study.....or must
specific regulations delay the answer for years.

Solid piece of research. 
Anybody who is questioning the article, take a close look at Steven Kriegsman's CYTR pay himself and trading GALE.
He has zero education in biotech. I looked into his activities and dropped my shares on Monday (phew!) -- Just take a
look -- IMHO he's not acting in the interest of the shareholders. I was shocked at how much money he takes from
CYTR in salary, but GALE is diluted. It's an early development biotech with 100mil+ float -- does management
compensation include incentives/compensation in shares and warrants?  
Take note that management sold nearly $13 million (as a group) in GALE shares in a 10-day period, all near the high.
It's alll public record. Look into it and decide for yourselves. 


13 Mar 2014, 01:31 PM


Prakoman
Compelling article, whatever Mr.Pearson's motives may be, it cannot be argued that this isn't a well prepared
document highlighting the misdeeds of GALE and CytRx's management. All involved management need to be
punished, and that may make the stock tumble but as far as I am concerned, thats a good buying opportunity
because from whatever I have seen of the science behind GALE's pipeline, it gives me great hope that these are
products that will work and work well, and patients need them. I am Long GALE.

There is nothing illegal or unethical about doing independent research, shorting a stock, and publicizing your research
that you have obtained independently (at considerable effort and expense) so as to inform the public regarding the
information you have uncovered.


This is a perfect example of how the pursuit of self-interest in a marketplace can in the long run work to the benefit of
society at large. The stock market is a marketplace of ideas that rewards individuals for uncovering and publicizing
information that enables more efficient price discovery. If the profit motive for uncovering fraudulent or unethical
behavior did not exist, much or most of it would go undetected to the detriment of society.


The market system rewards people like Richard handsomely for bringing valuable information to the fore. This is a
very good thing.


It's an excellent example of how the work of stock analysts adds value to society.

Fair enough Bryce,


That's why I said "fully trust." I wasn't trying to make a blanket statement about all investment bankers. I want
to remind people to keep that in mind when reading this and other articles on this site.


I worked briefly for Shearson Lehman Brothers over 20 years ago and got out of finance to get in another line
of work. IMO, I felt there was a little more lack of ethics on Wall Street than just a 'few' individuals. Remember,
just IMO.


As you responded to in another comment in here, this author also published on the Street a more favorable
article for GALE back in January. Things are suspect on both sides.


Regardless, at this point I'd like to see most of GALE's officers resign.

Richard,


Since you are short CYTR, this is a very well timed article. It's no coincidence the lawyers posted their complaint
within hours of your write up. Congratulations on taking a large short position and working the stock down. That's the
true dream team. How large of a short position did you have?


My final question is: does the drug aldoxorubicin work? As we know doxorubicin works, and aldoxorubicin is merely a
tweek of the existing drug, which was favored by the FDA. So congratulations on your short position, but your short
position does not help Cancer patients dying of Cancer. Hopefully the drug aldoxorubicin does.

japasiamerica:


"Your short position does not help Cancer patients dying of Cancer."


Neither did the long positions of company executives and insiders that paid touts to boost the share price.


Actually, Richard's article DOES help cancer patients because it helps weed out fraud and unethical conduct
in the biotech space. If guys like Richard did not do this sort of work, biotech companies with potentially
legitimate cures for cancer would never get funded because a capital market to fund such ventures would not
exist.

Its unfortunate that it takes this type of article to convince people of what many of us having been saying all along.
The engagement of the Dream Team and its affiliates by GALE was a resounding redflag. Where there is smoke there
is usually fire. More importantly if the management of a company is willing to do this is it far fetched to think that
maybe its accounting practices and scientific methods could be suspect? I've run by so many companies like this in
my career. The unethical behavior has more often than not been systematic and not related to just one area.


13 Mar 2014, 01:47 PM


cmblanch
Fabulous article. I had been holding shares until last week, bought at $2, luckily. I was never comfortable with
management, with Kriegsman in particular. He's never accomplished anything in this business and yet he and his
cronies on the Board continue to grant each other massive numbers of shares, the most recent being just before they
reported results in December--more than 3 million shares in December alone. And none of them, including the CEO,
has ever bought a share on the open market. They are completely unaligned with shareholders.


When they reported last week I emailed David Haen and asked why they also didn't schedule a call, to which he
replied, all the analysts asked them not to! I figured Kriegsman was too busy dealing with lawyers on the orchestrated
GALE pump and dump and wanted to avoid questions about it as well as CYTR's own p&d.


Anyway, great article. I hope CYTR really does have something worthwhile in their pipeline, and if they do I will have
left lots of cash on the table. But it smells to high heaven over there and I think your article is spot on. Thanks for
taking the time.

The real question is was any of the information posted by the DT false. If not no harm done. If Galena reviewed the

Just one problem with that. The stock was pumped, then dumped by GALE insiders. Artificially pumped up by
seemingly independent news sources which turned out to be false, i.e fraud. The material may have been
accurate, the news media used was a fraud, all paid by Galena to pump so insiders could profit by unloading
their stock.

"Bryce

Go to my instablog. There are four or five links that no longer work, DTG employees, the articles have been
pulled. The Wall Street CheatSheat and Motley Fool. Those links directly correlate to GALES's stock price for
those days. This is the DreamTeam at work. How many more are fake as well and we don't know?


Did GALE know this? Of course they knew it. So, there is evidence that these articles may have helped to
push the stock price up. Then we have the stock sales, and, IMO, the reason is clear now, pumping the stock
price to an unsustainable level while the insiders sell and enrich themselves, leaving retail investors like
myself to hold the bag.

Abraxxix,


A lot of articles have been pulled, no longer available. Even though I sold my shares today, I still have my blog
up for a few more days. I have nothing to hide, I believed in the company, including finding very sound
evidence that other factors besides the DTG influenced the stock price very materially. However, today's news
was the last straw for me. Still the blog is up. I have nothing to hide.


If the DTG had nothing to hide, why did they pull everything? If they were doing legitimate work for GALE,
why pull the articles? There should be nothing to hide or be ashamed of. Let the light shine in. On the other
hand if you have something to hide, you hide things, or attempt to.

Any difference between Liana M of Wedbush when she is pumping CHTP and LJPC and Tom M of Dream Team
when he is pumping CYTR, GALE, ISCO? I could not find any. Are they brother/sister of M? 
Both work with management to pump the stocks. The idiots are duped.

awesomeimo101
"Broader awareness of these issues could see the share prices of both CytRx and Galena trade to well below $2.00,
back where they were when the promotions began" 
You have a motivation to badmouth this company and you are making ridiculous statements like above to drive the
price down. Your motivation to drive down price of the stock makes your credibility questionable. You article sounds
mostly fluff. You are saying management is promoting its company by going through different channels. Did any
company contact you write this article? Did your short position in this stock encouraged you to do the investigation
when you were approached to promote this company? so many questions come up. At this point, I have more
questions about your credibility than CYTR.


13 Mar 2014, 03:46 PM

Good work on disclosing the intricacies and questionable practices surrounding CYTR, GALE, the Dream Team and
its hired and compensated authors of stock touting articles. I appreciate and especially take note of your own
disclosure - short CTR and intend to take other CYTR positions in 72 hours. I guess, but it is only a guess, that your
72 hour disclosure means you are going to cover at least some, if not all, of your short position in light of Warren
Buffet's advice to buy when others are fearful.


As for me, I too plan on opening a CYTR position within the next 72 hours. I am buying. Thank goodness you
"strongly encouraged" (in bold print even) the readers of your article to read the CYTR edits of the Dream Team
article, and provided the link to make that possible. I took your advice and did so. I encourage others to do the same.
As I read those links, it seemed to me that in each instance of an edit, CYTR management did nothing more than
make the information to be disclosed more accurate and to tone down some of the touting language used. The edits
were the right thing to do. The wrong and deceptive thing was that the paid authors masqueraded as independent by
failing to disclose their compensation. Whose fault is that, the Dream Team, the authors themselves, CYTR
management, all of them or some of them?


Be that as it may, I am confident that Oppenheimer did their own due diligence on CYTR and aldoxorubicin's Phase II
results prior to underwriting the $6.50 per share follow-on secondary that raised $86M proceeds.

"First, management of the companies would have to sign off (and edit) the articles. Second, I would not be allowed to
disclose that I was getting paid."


I have no problem with management editing articles for clarity, but like others would be concerned if they were told not
to disclose. I did not see anything in the emails or the links, can anyone point it out for me?

Thanks Rocketman33. To a very novice and naive new investor like myself, I would assume that whomever
writes an article has to disclose they are paid. I would think it is not up to the company paying them to ensure
that is completed, it is just understood and expected of all writers and PR groups, kind of like the OTC
warning on all Seeking Alpha articles, it is just something that is automatically included.

So wait...the problem is that authors who praised the stock did not disclose that they were being paid by a PR firm,
right?


Has it been proven that any of the information in the articles are factually incorrect or misleading?


13 Mar 2014, 06:22 PM


User 4542301
Dude, the authors posed as several different people, one of which at least was a fraud. Their articles
appeared as objective, non-compensatory. In fact they were paid and the article, as a result, was not an
independent opinion. It was a paid fraud, undisclosed, like Ted Mayer (Tom Meyer) a total fraud as well.


Tell you what, let's let every company do the same thing, hire dozens and dozens of people to impersonate a
host of other people and pay them to write hundreds of articles on the companies and publish them in
somewhat reputable sites like TheStreet.com and The Motley Fool. What would that do to the integrity and
trustworthiness that investors have in the markets? It would blow them to pieces. Lack of trust in the markets
would result in their destruction. Get it?

I understand how you feel but I think you are 'over-thinking' this. Do the valuation number again with Abstral

I took my losses and got out. I don't want anything to do with the sleaze in charge of GALE. I do hope the

For example, I create a toothpaste that really actually whitens teeth very well. But people just aren't catching
on, so I hire a group to do a PR blast, even lie and pretend to be unpaid, objective, etc. I have them fill up
reviews online pretending to be cutsomers.


However, they don't lie about what the product does. And the product actually is real and works.


I feel like this is what GALE is. That's my impression. But I want to know if I'm wrong about the facts. Did
these articles lie about GALE trials and data?

We have had back and forth exchanges where I've explicitly told you that DTG and affiliates are paid shills.
What do you mean "had I known"?


14 Mar 2014, 08:11 AM


User 4542301
Alex,


What I am saying is that the pumpers were not only associated with DTG and its affiliates, but also with the
Wall Street CheatSheet and most importantly, the Motley Fool, and Forbes. Those last two brands shock me.
So, that makes me wonder if there is more pumping associated with what I thought were reputable
companies. The pumping now appears more widespread than it did when I did my research, and it appears to
have had more of an effect than what I thought.


If there had been a disclaimer on these articles, a third, at least, of which my research articles are composed
of, those articles would have been discounted.


It simply appears now that DTG marketing was more widespread than what it appeared.

Wow! I tip my hat to the extensive detecting and reporting this and other related articles have uncovered. I'm new to
biotech and am learning a lot from these articles. With GALE, I see a MASSIVE upside potential, before earnings and
after this Monday. I think they have a lot more going for them then just pumping up and trying to hard, to fast, to get
there. Can't wait for earnings to see if I am somewhat right. Could be a 50-100% increase, without much further
possible decrease from it's smashed into the ground position.

Good instinct for a beginner dude. I've only been in this for two years or so and I wish I had that instinct at the
beginning. What's the downside risk with an investment in GALE while it's in the low 3's or high 2's? Not a lot.
But upside is potentially huge. It's one of those companies where you go contrarian when fear is in full swing.

Author please answer this question - Did Galena approve the article(s) you refer to?


Your article states: "GALE is just slow my friend. I chatted with Michael last night and they're still pending. I can't make
them approve when I say, it's up to them unfortunately."


It appears that GALE did not approve the article(s) referred to and they have no comment on this story as litigation is
pending.


13 Mar 2014, 06:41 PM


KCATTY
Agreed. I noticed that as well and assume that either 1) the CEO or CFO was uncomfortable with some
statements in a stupid article or 2) they ran it by legal and they nixed it. Either way, reflects well on GALE.


13 Mar 2014, 07:00 PM


KCATTY
I don't know anything about CYRtrx. But again, what is conspicuously missing from this article is an allegation that
Galena, it's officers, or their paid promoters made any "misrepresentations of material fact." Every word is those quote
marks is absolutely explicit from a securities regs perspective. It must be a statement of fact, not opinion, that is
materially false. By "material" we mean that a reasonable investor would have relied on the false material statement
to buy or sell. The problem is that those articles that were published about GALE 1) did not contain any
misrepresentations of fact, 2) much less any material misrepresentations of fact. That's why none of these short
articles ever mention any such misrepresentation of fact. In fact, I've read a couple of the complaints and they don't
cite any misrepresentations of fact.

In fact, although they wouldn't be liable, many of the shorts, like Enhydris have been making many misrepresentations
of material fact during this whole debate.


I originally bought GALE at 2.17 and sold at 4. Bought again at 4.25 and sold at 6.40. I just bought a big chunk today
at 2.92. Anywhere in the low 3's or 2's is a steal.


Bryce in TX breaks down the whole DreamTeam article bullcrap in his blog with a timeline of the GALE stock
movements vs the DT publishing dates. Really destroys this whole controversy.

KCatty,


I sold my stock today. A third of the links in my blog are now bogus, do not exist, because they were the work
of the DreamTeam employees. IN specific, several from the WallStreet CheatSheet and the Motley Fool. Tom
Meyer portrayed to be himself, plus "Ted Mayer" plus a few more.


So, there is now some evidence that the DreamTeam, paid by GALE, aided in pushing GALE's stock price up.
And the insiders sold millions of shares. Now, if that isn't criminal, it should be.

How can you know if they misrepresented since they are "insiders" and you as an outsider don't have access
directly to check anything. When there's slim (not saying one way or the other here), but when there's slim, it's
very likely to show up elsewhere in the person's actions too. Either in the past or in the future.

Too bad greed or misguided self righteousness on either side side tracks the promise of the technology and

Thank you so much for your work. What a picture you painted. Your fly on the wall view of what happened was both
instructive and entertaining.

Wow so many comments! You really had this amazing shorting opportunity handed to you. What a gift. But my biggest
question is why did you wait so long to report this. It seemed that everything transpired before AF's article. Your
corroboration of everything Adam said sure would have helped many people from losing their money as CYTR would
not have been able to sell all those now pretty worthless stocks. Oh right it allowed you time to buy lots of shorts at
very reasonable rates so you could make a lot of money back. The only person you helped was yourself and now you
are driving it home. Be careful the SEC may be looking at your actions as being collusive.

Rick, was this also you? 
http://bit.ly/O74Aej


If so, something looks odd. You wrote a relatively positive piece about GALE in The Street on Jan 27, but apparently
received contact from the Dream Team at least a week earlier, on or before Jan 20 (according to the link in today's
article to an e-mail you sent sent to a neutral 3rd party). Why publish a relatively positive piece about GALE some
time AFTER you started your investigation of its relationship with Dream Team? Or, was the article in The Street a
product of your relationship with Dream Team, maybe part of your investigation?

Fantastic conversation here,both sides have an argument and I am 100% sure that absolutely NOBODY is going to
change their opinion one way or another. The one thing I found most interesting is that CYTR officers/directors didnt
sell shares and GALE officers/directors sold millions of dollars of shares.I do not own shares in either co and do not
ever plan on buying shares long or short.I hope both cos have BB drugs and stock holders make a ton of money and I
do not trust admitted shorts writing short articles.

Wonder whether any of the DreamTeamGroup "Message Board Team" or "Social Networking Team" are among the
commenters on this article? See: http://bit.ly/1iHl2uY


Also, there's a list of companies (presumably clients) in the right hand column of their blog that might be of interest to
SA readers: http://bit.ly/1iHl2v2


FYI: I have no position in either stock.

David:


I've been wondering about that myself. Some of these comments don't sound like real people. And how about
the "people" that have posted the same comment about 25 times asking about the supposedly favorable
GALE article that the author posted in January?


This is one reason I really don't like anonymous articles or commenting.


14 Mar 2014, 02:16 AM


David Jackson, Contributor
James, I think there's a lot we can do on the platform to flag suspicious commenters. I'm sure that if we mine
the data we can find patterns, which might include: commenting consistently on the same stocks and no
others, short average comment length, and being consistently bullish. Others which might be harder to
identify using technology might include attacks on the author rather than discussion of the substantive issues,
and having a user photo which is a young woman :-)

14 Mar 2014, 03:55 AM


David Jackson, Contributor
James, one additional thought about how we could curtail manipulative comments.


It's clear that the stock promotion firms behave in unethical ways:  
- They masquerade as investors without disclosing that they are actually being paid by the company. (Thus
DreamTeam's "Message Board Team".)  
- They run websites with names that suggest they are purely in the interest of investors, when in fact those
websites are platforms for promotion. For example, DreamTeamGroup's "Quality Stocks", "Stocks To Buy
Now", "Home Run Stocks", "Tiny Gems", "Touch Down Stocks" and others here http://bit.ly/1iIpJEP


However, they seem to stop short of explicitly lying. I suspect the reason is that they're concerned about the
legal exposure of lying.


So, if we required all commenters to agree to terms of service that if you are being paid to comment, you
agree not to do so without explicitly disclosing it in each commment, my guess is that would block many of the
promotors from commenting.


Thoughts?


14 Mar 2014, 04:34 AM


James A. Kostohryz, Contributor
David:


First, I think your ideas to use technology to flag abuse are great. I would also like to throw a related idea in
there: When a commenter leaves multiple critical comments on virtually every single article a contributor
writes, I think SA should step in and ban that commenter for that contributor. Even if these folks are not
always being "abusive" in the most immediately acute sense they are being disruptive. For example, I have
obsessive "critics" that have had multiple comments deleted. Many of these critics also make repeated
statements that are factually incorrect or misleading in order to harass an author. In my view, SA should go
one step further in reining in this sort of disruptive concerted adversarial activity that degrades the level of
discussion on the site.


2. I agree entirely that penalty clauses should be placed in the terms of service for users. Many users --
especially firms -- will think twice about running afoul of a specific contractual provision that has a penalty
attached. Another deterrent to consider along these lines would be positive identification. In a separate
contributor forum that I posted to today, I suggested that positive identification and background checks be
required for contributors and that an anonymous contributor's identity be revealed when terms have been
violated. That would be part of the penalty clause for contributors. It would have to work differently for
commenters because SA can't do background checks on each one. One way to do this with users, as you
know, is through cross registration with Facebook. This might scare some legit commenters away, but it would
definitely be a deterrent to abuse. Cost-benefit, I think it is more valuable for SA to deter abuse than the loss
in participation that might occur. I realize the FB option would represent an extreme change for SA, however.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 82/122


Finally, although I realize SA has not been keen on this idea, I would be remiss if I did not mention my strong
support for enabling trusted contributors to curate their own comment sections. Sure, some contributors might
abuse this. But, the question is what abuse is better, on balance, for SA to let slip through the cracks. If SA is
going to err in this, it should be on the side of trusting its more valued contributors rather than giving the
benefit of the doubt to anonymous commenters as occurs today. Enabling trusted contributors to curate would
also be a money and time saver for SA.


So, I think you have thought of some good options. I hope your team will consider my suggestions as well.


Cheers!


14 Mar 2014, 05:45 AM


Land of Milk and Honey
James,


David's ideas for flagging abuse are good. They would identify posters misusing the system. I'd disagree with
needing to "expose" people's real identities. Comments can be taken on their merit or lack of. That tends to
shine through, and glancing through the poster's history helps. I'd like to see, when a post is removed by SA,
there's a way when looking at the person's profile, to look through removed posts. That way others can see a
more complete picture.


The site is designed to give users a chance to grow alpha... it's not a business you've joined where your
identity is needed. It's an internet forum for users.


There are many reasons for non-authors to want to stay anonymous when it comes to posting about their
finances. For instance, I've learned recently an acquaintance of mine through a charity organization does a lot
of trading. I'm very glad not to be knowingly running into his account and learning a lot more about his
finances and viewpoints than we'd both be comfortable. And vice versa. To insist that everyone present their
identities, would greatly limit the useability of this site for many of it's current users.


14 Mar 2014, 08:42 AM


David Jackson, Contributor
James, in addition to Land of Milk and Honey's points above, I'd add:


1. Academic research has proved that the comments on Seeking Alpha (which are largely written under
pseudonyms) are extremely valuable, as measured by their ability to predictive future stock prices. Moreover,
when comments and articles are in conflict with each other, the comments have higher predictive value than
the articles. See: http://bit.ly/Oq2qpO


2. Research on blog comments generally has shown that pseudonyms lead to higher quality comments. See:
http://bit.ly/Oq2o1j


3. See also the Electronic Frontier Foundation's case for pseudonyms: http://bit.ly/Oq2qpP

I understand what you are saying. It's a cost-benefit analysis. I understand that most people that post

constructive.


14 Mar 2014, 01:35 PM


James A. Kostohryz, Contributor
Hi David:


Thanks for the reply and excellent links. My comments:


1. The first link does not contradict my point. Nobody encourages intelligent debate and engages commenters
more than I do. So, I agree that comments are very valuable.


2. To be clear, I am not against pseudonyms. My suggestion is that SA (not the public) be able to positively ID
them in order to "out" them if they break the terms of use. I believe this could be a deterent. It preserves
people's anonymity as long as it is not abused.


3. The third article is excellent and shows that there are different points of view. FB and G+ are big companies
that do lots of research and if they think that pseudonyms are not a great idea for their communities, they
have reasons. But every community  is different, so I think that the decision needs to be contextual. For
some sites anonymity makes sense, for others it does not. In the case of SA I wonder if we could strike a little
better balance. Allow pseudonyms, but restrict their use and punish those that abuse the privilege.


14 Mar 2014, 01:46 PM


varan
Not to be unduly adversarial here, but I think that the proposal to ban posters writing excessive number of
adversarial comments purely on the basis of that criterion is a bit self-serving. In many articles, for example,
authors rejoice in whole-sale condemnation of all the analytical research that has been done in finance, and
there is no way to deal with such articles than to ridicule them and post multiple 'adversarial' comments.

I have posted my concern with the credibility of the author, and quite a number of people on this board seem
to share this concern, as it is a valid concern but certainly not an indictment of his guilt, as his article raises a
number of "red flags" regarding the integrity of management of both CYTR and GALE. 
l do not see an issue with posting comments anonymously, what l do have an enormous issue with is SA's
practice of allowing contributing editors to post an article if they are either long or short or intend to take a
position within 72 hours of penning an article for SA .

Rationality
It is unrealistic to expect people to post articles for purely cerebral or altruistic reasons. Many times they have
certain vested interests, and that is perfectly fine. If what they write actually has an impact on a stock's price
then I think that should not be condemned but in fact applauded for being able to move the needle when most
folks cannot even come close to that feat.


I went long on GALE 2 days ago and, hopefully, it does not turn out to be a disastrous decision, but you never
know. There is risk in trading and investing. We are the authors of our own decisions.


15 Mar 2014, 10:19 AM


Rocketman33
Rationality


Oh, really, why is it so unrealistic to ask all contributing editors to be completely transparent and free of any
and all implied impartiality. 
We ask this of our politicians, this is the very reason we have civilians on police boards etc., etc., to help
prevent any and all collusion. it is the one thing we can do to eliminate corruption. 
This very principal is the main reason the western world triumphs over so many other nations, and people
flock here in never-ending numbers. 
The people primarily opposed to such an ideal, would they not be the people that have the most to gain from
this practice ? 
This author certainly put a lot of effort into this lengthy article re: CYTR and GALE, however are we to believe
his main motive was one of nobility or financial gain, and or perhaps both, perhaps he thought it was totally
ethical to short CYTR , and or tell some of his associates what he was about to do, because he thought he
deserved to at least be compensated for his expose ? 
All valid questions are they not ?

No they are not valid questions, Rocket.


"this is the very reason we have civilians on... boards... to prevent collusion" 
Richard is a civilian on this board working to expose collusion between Dream Team and Cytrix.


"perhaps he thought it was ethical to tell some of his associates ... he was about to [short CYTR]" 
Mr Pearson told you about his decision to short CYTR. If he told others first perhaps it's because they have
the sense to be grateful.


Why question an author's motive for writing? It's not as if you can discern it. Why not try instead to discern the
truth or falsehood of his words? Investors are not disciples of Kant. Neither, I assume, are many alumni of
SAIT Polytechnic. Why fake it? Make money, ride your motorcycle, enjoy life! No need to waste time
speculating about Richard Pearson's motivation for giving you valuable information for free.

For many, unfortunate "investors" and I use that term loosely, being long or short is a unshakable commitment
that is not subject to new information. Its like having the argument with a friend about whether god exists. The
position is not reversible. They aren't going to change their views because admitting one is wrong is an earth
shattering revelation (more important than the $s involved). These people are emotional about their
investments and we all know what happens when you get emotional about investing. The goal here is not to
be wed to any position and continually judge its merits on an continuous basis with any new information that
might affect its valuation.

The SEC will do nothing with this, too overstretched. Private securities litigation will settle for pennies on the dollar as

deficiencies with the drug and indeed the absence of insider selling underlines the likelihood that it is real. Thinking of

James A. Kostohryz, Contributor
In the SA contributor forum one contributor voiced an objection that was similar to many voiced here, namely that
Pearson narrowly focused his article on potentially unethical/illegal conduct while ignoring presumed good data from
clinical trials. He suggested that SA should never have published the article because it is a site dedicated to
fundamental analysis and a short thesis should never be based exclusively on such "tabloid" information." I copy my
reply here as I believe it addresses many of the points discussed in this forum:


________


The author has painstakingly uncovered unethical and potentially illegal behavior by company management. This is
hugely important and NEW fundamental data. By contrast, dozens of articles on these stocks simply rehash old
information and speculation about the science and the clinical trials. By comparison, many such articles add little or
no value compared to the one just provided by Pearson.


Furthermore, uncovering this behavior was precisely what Pearson's article was about; it was not about the clinical
trials. Therefore there was no need for him to mention clinical trials whatsoever. He leaves that to you and others to
speculate about and rehash.


The fallacy in your argument is your apparent belief that an article needs to cover every single major fact that is
relevant to a stock. In this case you seem to believe that the author has an obligation to discuss the clinical trials. This
is false. Many good articles focus on a very narrow aspect of a stock and contrary to what you imply, there is nothing
wrong with that sort of narrow focus. To the contrary, focus is a good thing.


You say a short thesis should not be based on such a narrow analysis. Why not? The trustworthiness of the
management of a company like this is a huge aspect of its valuation given all of the unknowns involved with the
science and the trial process. With a small cap stock like this, disclosure of this sort of information regarding unethical
conduct of management and potential legal problems for the company can easily be estimated to subtract hundreds
of millions of dollars from the value of a stock -- a substantial percentage of the company's market cap prior to the
revelations which presumably reflected all prior-known information about test data and so on. Indeed, it should does
not take a genius to understand that the market value of these stocks would have been considerably less at
yesterday's close if the information uncovered by Pearson had been announced by the company in a press
conference yesterday morning. That in and of itself means that the narrow focus of the short thesis was entirely
appropriate.


You and others are free to write the 127th article on the "data." But you embarrass yourself when you show yourself to
be in denial about the importance of the unethical and potentially criminal conduct by management that was
uncovered in Pearson's article.

Could the technology owned by these companies ultimately be proven to be so valuable that their share prices are
currently undervalued? Maybe; that is highly speculative. Does the fact that management has engaged in unethical
and/or illegal activity subtract from the fundamental value of the stock? That is ABSOLUTELY FOR SURE.


For an analyst such as yourself to suggest that SA should only publish articles that focus on the former subject and
refuse to publish articles that are focused on the later subject treating such information as "tabloid" material, is truly an
embarrassment.


Finally, if you are so convinced that the information presented by Pearson is so irrelevant and misleading, then you
should be EXTREMELY HAPPY. Because you are being given a wonderful opportunity to buy these stocks and to
write an article about how and why you made a killing from doing so that will make you more rich and famous than
you already are.

Have you seen the amounts that Mr. Kriegsman has awarded himself?


I once called him 'one of the most respectable biotech executives around' and Galena 'a jewel of a biotech firm'.


I have been educated since.


The science may still be good. But the companies are being led by crooks.

A lot of people have invested in CYTR (myself included) and are probably wondering what is next. Need to answer
the fundemenral questions: 
Were the results doctored?  
The rise of the stock price was before or after the paid advertisements? 
Can anyone answer these two questions? 
Thanks

Sad to see but hopefully GALE will eventually come out of this in a year or so...I hope they learned their lesson and it
doesn't bankrupt the company.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena - CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:CYTR) | Seeking Alpha

I submitted a comment around 1PM today but the SA moderator apparently did not approve it, for some reason.
Trying once more...


The author, Richard Pearson, indicates he was approached by The Dream Team and asked to participate in the
alleged unethical/illegal conduct no later than January 20, 2014 -- the date of his e-mail to a 'neutral 3rd party'
outlining his plan to play along with TDT's game.


But the author penned a relatively positive article on GALE that was published in The Street a week later, on January
27, 2014 (http://bit.ly/O74Aej).


Was the author 'playing along' with TDT when he published his 1/27/14 piece in The Street? If so, he seems to have
stepped over the line, from 'playing along' to actively participating in TDT's deceptive practices. If not, what was he
doing publishing a positive piece on GALE while he was supposedly in the midst of trying to expose a scam about
illicit pumping up of GALE's stock price?

Can I suggest you, and the other person posting this information repeatedly... write a note to SA asking them
to figure out the details of this and post the results in this article, so we can all know.


Posting the same thing over and over, probably will get the comment detailed by moderation eventually.
Better to take this news and try to get to the bottom of it.

I have no positions in either company and never have, but my portfolio is biotech heavy. Greed being what it is, I'm
not naive enough to have not realized there was bound to be some corruption in the market place and there have
been several occasions when articles would make me suspicious. 
Nevertheless, this is disturbing stuff. How are small retail investors, like myself, with full-time jobs and educations in
something other than finance, supposed to insulate ourselves? Part of my DD for any company has always been to
read through many of the articles and comments from people with (allegedly) more expertise than I. 
Just my two cents. Thank you for taking the time to research and post this excellent article.

Now we've talked this all out. I think Seeking Alpha should have some legal contract for their contributors that makes
writing misleading, paid articles a basis for breach of contract with SA as it damages their reputation. Further, those of
us writing comments should also have something that verifies us. This site is feeling very Yahoo Finance to me.


14 Mar 2014, 11:21 AM

How about establishing credentials like journalist in newspapers. Then you could have credentialed
contributors, and those that choose to remain totally anonymous. Same for commentators like me. Make
those standards high, verified by SA staff, and non-published. Then SA would also have a responsibility for
the credibility of its articles.

jsIRA, Marketplace Contributor
This thing happens many times. Take ROSG for example, it run from 1.66 to over $22.5 in 7 days in May, 2012. They
did the same thing before issuing shares. Many others.


14 Mar 2014, 11:31 AM


User 4542301
One thing that does bother me about Mr. Pearson is that he has not made any replies to the comments. That in my
eyes reduces his credibility. He's not willing to address anything about his article, including an explanation for his Jan.
27, 2014 positive "Street.com" article on GALE. That gives him and the article the appearance of a "hit and run" and
being more "anonymous" and "aloof" and not as trustworthy.


I think authors have a responsibility to enter into some exchange with their readers. There are legitimate questions
presented in the comments that need amplification and or clarification. (What's with seeking alpha cutting short words
when I put a slash between them like amplification/clarific... That is frustrating as all get out. )

Bryce I see you are really unsure what to do. Don't buy shares when your are not convinced of GALE. 
Better buy Coca Cola or Tesla shares then you have less pressure :) 
It's only a well-meant proposal


14 Mar 2014, 03:09 PM


User 4542301
Not unsure at all. I sold my GALE shares yesterday. GALE needs to jettison the officers and directors and
bring in fresh management who have integrity, for the sake of the patients and doctors conducting the trials,
and the sake of other cancer patients who may eventually benefit from the drugs in trial.


My post stands on its own.

I don't blame him. Very few comments here have been worth reading, much less worth responding to. Most
are about his motivations as a short seller, not about the points he makes in the article. Would you waste your
time replying? (And should I waste mine?)

platonic


it would take all of ONE comment on the topic of motivation to have stopped or limited all the rest. Even a "for
legal reasons I'm not commenting" would give a sense of integrity.


I don't know his motivation, but my positive impression with the exposure has gone down since the lack of
response by him and SA on several valid and important points raised. Such as what was that article he wrote
after they contacted him for... since here he implies that he didn't take them up on their offer to publish.


My sole interest is watching it all unfold and hopefully learning a little more personal savvy about internet
information - both those of commenters and of contributors.


20 Mar 2014, 02:26 PM


User 4542301
platonic,


I have two questions. What was going through the author's mind when he wrote the article for the Street.com
on Jan. 27. Why did he give a positive impression on Galena in that article if he had already been contacted
by the DTG? Second, he states there are 100 articles that have been pulled in the two days before his
publishing this article, but there are only 13 on his website. Where are the others, and why didn't he make
copies of those also? Then there's the SEC and who they will go after, DTG or GALE or both. According to
one statement by the SEC, it appears they may go after only DTG.


I think there are plenty of good questions to be asked, if he were available.

Good points 
It seems that as more and more of the very diligent commenters dig into the so called facts put forth by this
author regarding Gale, the greater the question of authenticity of his implied points. 
You, Rocketjock, myself ,and others have noticed this 
SA really needs to do a better job of keeping these authors accountable, and or accessible to at least answer
any and all valid rebuttals, again it is simply a matter of transparency and making this a better forum where
we can believe that what is being penned by the author is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, without
any hidden agendas.

He commented at the commenter, not the author. So the commenter, commented back.


I'm back to my earlier post-- how many commenters here have come out of the woodwork to shill for one side
or the other?


An incredibly peculiar number of low comment counts, no bio, nothing much pic, with short very polished or
highly hit and run sounding comments. Often with an authoritative air that they or their view is authoritative,
that's has an edge to them.


For instance, there's a stream of them at the end of this article.


14 Mar 2014, 06:24 PM


zubbub
When article writers pump a stock while employing phoney biographies and aliases, and moreover are paid
by the company to do so, that is fraudulent, and its exposure newsworthy. That is why I praise this author for
his excellent exposé.


However, when people write short comments here making some substantive point, I couldn't care less who or
what they are "shills" for. I'm happy to see arguments pro and con, and take for granted that many if not most
commentators are interested parties, long, short, or whatever. So what? I want to hear points from both sides;
as John Stuart Mill observed, that presents the best chance that the truth be learned, and it makes intelligent
readers here better investors.


This commenter may have commented "at" the previous commenter (whatever that means) but he was
commenting ON the author, and raises a legitimate question about why he published a positive GALE article.
I couldn't care less if he does so as someone's "shill", although the only alleged evidence cited by you and the
other commenter is worthless.


The incessant ad hominems here are mindless and stifling. People regularly think they are being clever when,
instead of addressing a point made by someone, they "investigate" him and try to throw mud on his credibility
or reputation. I even witnessed a case of a veteran doctor on a QCOR thread who was accused by cyberbully
longs - on no grounds whatsoever other than that he expressed qualms about the marketing of QCOR's sole
drug - of not being a real doctor, of being a quack, and so on. Examples on SA are too numerous to mention,
including on this thread alone.

You can't figure out what the means? Read it as written.  
Bruce was commenting at you, not the author. You were commenting back AT Bruce, not at the author.


>"happy to see arguments pro and con" 
Sure but these aren't arguments. Shilling is posting less than accurate and bias non-thought out points in
order to influence in exchange for money. It's a form of advertising, and it influences. Even when you don't
mean it to. It's not genuine exchange. It noise that gets in the way of finding the genuine exchanges and
points.

I didn't cite evidence. I expressed my impression. If you think of that as "evidence" then you're working way to

post does...

I guess what I don't understand is that Rick Pearson himself wrote a positive article on GALE and CyTRx on
The Street on 1/27/14.


http://bit.ly/O74Aej


This is right in the middle of all this 'turmoil'. So...what's his angle? He doesn't agree with GALE's methods but
he agrees with the outcomes?


Guess I'm lost here.


16 Mar 2014, 02:04 PM


User 4542301
I don't get the "positive article" talk. He says in the article that he isn't making a bull or bear case, that he isn't
taking one side or the other. He describes how and why the stocks have risen very significantly in value and
what is in each company's pipeline. But, I see nowhere where he states these are great stocks to own or
recommends buying them. At the end of the article he reiterates that he is withholding his investment opinion
on all 3 stocks.


Based on that, how do you arrive that he is positive on GALE or Cytrix?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena 95/122


I agree with your points however the actual content of the article is anything but negative towards Gale, here
it is;


Galena Biopharma


Galena is noteworthy because it is attempting to bring to market a pain relief treatment ("Abstral") as well as a
cancer intervention. Abstral launched in October 2013 and the company projects revenue of $40 million to
$60 million within five years.


Galena also has a pipeline of oncology drugs that have piqued investor interest, all centered on key
technology Neuvax.


Neuvax is a novel cancer immunotherapy which targets the HER2 protein, and has potentially promising
results in Phase I and Phase II FDA trials. What makes Neuvax and other immunotherapies different from
chemotherapy drugs is that instead of killing cancer cells with the HER2 protein directly, Neuvax trains the
body's immune system to identify and kill cancer cells with the HER2 protein. Galena is currently running a
phase III FDA multinational trial with 700 patients for the use of Neuvax in breast cancer.


Galena is also running a phase IIb trial that combines Neuvax with Herceptin by Roche.


Galena has other products further away from FDA approval including a controlled release formulation of
anagrelide and a folate binding protein treatment for ovarian cancer.


 
Since early November 2013, Galena is up more than 100 % from roughly $2.25. There have been a number
of recent developments. The company brought Abstral to market, it bought Mills pharmaceuticals, it signed
several deals such as this one, and obtained equity research coverage from Oppenheime


16 Mar 2014, 07:31 PM


User 4542301
Definitely not negative, but it is a description of GALE's pipeline and statement of facts. Hardly an
endorsement.


16 Mar 2014, 08:23 PM


Rocketman33
Bryce


The fact that he starts off the article with "Galena is noteworthy because " and then goes on and paints the Co
with a positive tone, certainly contradicts the position of abstaining from publishing anything as he points out
in this quote from his article; 
[ I began submitting dummy articles to the Dream Team rep (with no intention of ever publishing them). My
goal was to determine how involved management from these two companies were in this undisclosed paid
promotion scheme. ]


This is certainly quite the contradiction that the author has never addressed.

By arranging his statements in the way he did, to show the company's pipeline and position, he is in fact
making a positive statement about GALE. Any writer can 'lead the reader' to a conclusion based on the
positioning of "facts".


For example, a baseball team may be .500 at the all-star break, but how the assessment is made can lead a
reader to vastly different conclusions about where it's going:


Positive:


1. Team A has won as many games as it has lost 
2. Team A won 60% of it's last 40 games 
3. Team A is batting .300 in it's last 40 games


Negative:


1. Team A has lost as many games as it has won 
2. Team A only won 40% of it's first 40 games 
3. Team A only batted .250 in it's first 40 games


All of these statements are correct; however, they lead you to 2 different conclusions about where team A is
headed.

Excellent investigative work Richard.


"Investors who bought into the offering at $6.50 are already well underwater. They may find these promotions to have
been very disturbing in the context of their flagging investment."


Those investors should have a legal put back to the company. This is disgusting behavior. About a year ago I received
an unsolicited e-mail asking me if I would be interested in earning up to $1,000 per article if I would research a
particular stock. At first I thought it was legit and said sure. Then I was told I just had to publish their research under
my SA account. I asked to see a sample article. The article mentioned 5 stocks of which 4 were legitimate big caps.
The fifth was some obscure microcap with no business to speak of. An obvious pump and dump. Of course I declined.
I suspect this goes on on the short side too with hedge funds footing the bill.


As an aside I wrote an article on an old fashioned pump and dump a couple of years ago that involved a brochure I
received in the mail. Its a very interesting story of a multimillion dollar promotional campaign to tout the "Lithium

Stop trying to imply that Mr. Pearson was part of some sort of unethical, two faced scam, designed to both pump
GALE and then bash it. The article to which you all refer, dated 1/27/14 states the following from Mr. Pearson, "At
present I have no position in any of these stocks and I am deliberately refraining from expressing any bull or bear
opinions on any of these stocks. But I continue to focus on all three quite closely."


The article as he states in the first paragraph is written to inform the reader what had been driving the share price. He
expresses no opinion, long or short, regarding GALE.


Stop creating nonsense from this.

the same as a piece designed to give a buy or sell recommendation which Mr. Pearson clearly states that he has no
opinion. This article is no different from the everyday informative reporting one might see on Bloomberg TV, Fox
News, or MSNBC. Its not a stock tout.


No boundary crossed here, not by a long shot.


If your defense of GALE's behavior is to try to discredit Mr. Pearson you are going to have to do better than that.

Go back and read my many comments. You are writing to me about things I haven't said.


There may be something wrong here. You've got a new account, call him a very polite & usually formal "Mr.
Peterson", and generally sound like you've got an position to push. Meanwhile, I haven't pushed any position.
Just said that something that something should be looked into before dismissing it.


Just because an article doesn't officially take a position in an early statement, doesn't mean it isn't meant to
influence. But that's not a forgone conclusion either. I'd like to know what's going on.... it shouldn't be
dismissed with the word "nonsense."

Do you not understand the point that LOMAH makes ? 
Any author will have his credibility challenged if he gives the impression that he chose to abstain from writing
about a certain Co. because he did not want any part of DTG's fraudulent activity, only to have this very
important point completely refuted ?

Thanks for your hard work on this. I initially held the same somewhat distorted idea of why wouldn't you pay to
promote your company that you believe in and if the drug works does it really matter, but this goes beyond that and it

"The author's bio seems very impressive except for the fact that he is also a part of the generally corrupt
financial industry that he so correctly decries."


I also belong to that community, as an accountant. This is like calling all German people Nazis. It is offensive
and inappropriate. I can't speak for Mr. Pearson, but I can speak for myself and many other people who are
accountants or in finance. This is plain, ugly bias, without any justification whatsoever. Some wrongs
committed by people in the financial industry have angered you and distorted your thinking to the point you
automatically think all are guilty. It is you who's thinking is distorted and needs adjustment.


The "generally corrupt financial industry" is made up of individuals, all of whom have varying backgrounds
and levels of integrity, just like any other industry.

Anyone here who dismisses the significance of the stock pumping by saying the clinical data is good, is too stupid to
know how to critically read and understand the data that was given (and to notice certain portions were not given),
publicly.


Furthermore, if a company really has good, complete, clinical data, knowledgeable investors would buy the shares
and company would not have to rely on pumping it to non-knowledgeable, naive ones.

By the way, who wants to bet the David Haen ends up holding the bag on this one? Kriegsman is very clever-- he
hired someone green for a reason, just for this purpose. Who wants to bet he covered his tracks? 
I can see it in my mind now: 
Kreigsman's laywer: "Mr. Haen, isn't it true that it was YOU who edited the press release and approved it's contents
without full disclosure?" 
David Haen: "But, but, but..... Steven, help me out here... you told me to do it, you said it was okay, you said I was like
a son to you...". 
Kreigsman's lawyer: "You only THOUGHT he wanted you to do this, he never explicitly SAID to do this!" 
David Haen: "he said to 'just take care of it'!" 
Kreigsman's laywer: "what does that mean, Mr. Haen? Does it mean.. take care of getting the coffee? take care of
ordering my lunch? YOU have no idea of what 'take care of it means, Sir!"

l meant to add before the editing timed out; l am quite sure going forward Gale and Cytr will continue to spend money
on marketing, however we can be quite sure it will not be with DTG, and in ending l would hope they would replace
the board member that suggested their relationship.

Controversy over the undisclosed payment for PR notwithstanding, if their science and trials are legitimate, then it's
immaterial, and at worst Kriegsman may have to step down. If the clinical trials continue to be successful this stock is
a huge buy.  
It's a big if, albeit.

What this article exposes is actually how the entire IR-PR industry for the biopharma works. The tactics of
DreamTeam GALE and CYTR are nothing exceptional. It does not make them right or acceptable. But it does mean
that investors MUST take this into consideration. If you want to invest in this sector you better dig find and read actual
peer-reviewed articles and presentations. Then read the comments and questions raised by other professionals. Here

Pancreatic ductual and solid tumor trials were initiated in 2012, by CYTR, using Aldox. There was never any
disclosure as to the results, they probably saw something they disliked and decided to bury it. 
At least that's as far as I can tell, but I haven't trawled their PR statements that far back yet. 
I think they may have buried the results, which biotechs do a lot, if they are unfavorable. 
http://bit.ly/1grGh0w


On top of small clinical trials with Aldox on the STS with ZERO response by Dox, as pointed out by Adam Fuerstein, I
think their science is rather suspect.


16 Mar 2014, 06:47 PM


BuyersStrikeWP
@ Granters


Agree 100%. There is no "science" here. Aldox is actually an old drug that has bounced around from company to
company. After being licensed out of Germany, it was left for dead by a Lindsay Rosenwald backed outfit before
CYTR picked it up.


That provenance alone should be enough to terrify any rational investor.


16 Mar 2014, 08:16 PM


jackryanjr
Dox is an old drug. The albumin binding technology is licensed from Japan. The combination of the old "go to"
drug, and the novel albumin binding & delivery technique is what makes Aldox a great drug. By great I mean
it offers significantly better outcomes compared to dox, with greatly mitigated side-effects, and the ability to
deliver 5-10X the medication dose to the tumors feeding off of blood full of Dox laced albumin . Ask any
Oncologist if all of this matters to his/her patients. The answer is YES. If GBM trials prove equally effective,
those given a death sentence will enjoy possibly years more time in a relatively healthy state.


This is actually a very important step towards better oncology treatment as biotech works towards the
individualized vaccines 15-20 years from full-blown efficacy.


To those who wonder why some trials are stopped or ended by the company, in the case of aldox, it has more
to do with the FDA accepted Protocol, ability to meet very highly significant goals, volume of other studies in
the same relative space, and CASH BURN. With GALE, they cannot even write an achievable protocol, name
their studies appropriately (ph3 is really 2b), or simply state they realize the patient population for their
compound is a micro-fraction of those they had hoped would benefit. GALE cancelling a trial would raise red-
flags for me. Knowing a great deal more about the innards of CYTR, I feel confident stating they can only
spend money in so many indications at a time, and finding centers for many indications has become a very
crowded and more difficult proposal.

Pearson said "Those who are interested in background information on these types of situations can refer to this article
which details an SEC crackdown on internet stock touting and the laws that were violated. It is a forceful read and I
strongly encourage readers to at least give it a quick browse."


I took the author's advice and read the entire SEC press conference he provided a link to above. The press
conference was held by William Walker, SEC Director of Enforcement. I am glad a took the time to read it in it's
entirety because if you read the question and answer section you will see his response to this press question: 
[Response to question about whether companies hiring touters would be prosecuted.]  
William Walker response: 
"There is nothing illegal about companies paying fees to touters. The law requires the touters have to disclose ... The
laws do not cover the companies themselves who make the payments." 
Question on how to locate the touters: 
[Response to question about how the SEC finds out the touters are paid.] 
William Walker response: 
"... It would not be unreasonable to call the company itself to find out whether they had paid anyone to make
promotions about the company, or call the newsletter itself and ask a question directly. Now, I cannot tell you whether
you are going to be told the truth, but these are two ready and easy ways to start the process."


So, from the mouth of the SEC Director of enforcement himself - It is the responsibility of the touter themselves to
ensure full disclosure, not the companies that may have paid them. In fact, the SEC may seek the help of those
companies to prosecute touters.


Thank you Mr Pearson for providing a link to real SEC information that vindicates the companies involved here.

For true longs, buying on fear is always a good way to make money.


But remember never put everything in one basket.


Also buying in steps should work.


I am still believing that GALE has great future. Hold it one year. Will find out where the stock will go.


Paid advertising: nothing wrong.  
Editing the materials before publishing: nothing wrong. 
Non-disclosure: it is wrong but we need to know who will be responsible? GALE or DTG?


Insider selling: we need to know whether it is against the law? It may be or may be not.


17 Mar 2014, 02:11 PM

Read rocketjocks article above, the disclosure is the responsibility of the touters, not the Co that may have paid them. 
Insider selling?  
What did they do, they sold stock options, nothing illegal about that 
I feel as an investor you have to at least hold onto this stock until the end of this yr when we should see the interim
phase lll results, which l might add may very well result in a partnership from Roche or Teva as both these Co's have
stated their interest if the results are positive.

Ross, on the Abstral sales, are you referring to 4th Qtr. guidance? Looks to me like they met full year 2013
guidance with $2.5 million. Fourth Qtr was $1.3 million I believe. What was the estimate for 4th Qtr?


Could the Abstral coupon promotion have had an impact on 4th Qtr. sales and is that a short term program
ending in 2014? Could the upward guidance for 2014 be explained by the coupon program ending?


Not interested in spin, pro or con, just objective analysis, if that is possible.


Their cash position looks good for 2014. Plenty of cash to fund everything into 2015. No dilution anytime soon
it doesn't look like.


17 Mar 2014, 05:52 PM

The estimate was $1.5 to 3.0 million. So they were closer to the higher end.

via Benzinga:


Galena Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GALE) reports Q4 revenue of $1.32M versus the estimated $1.62M.


No idea re:upward guidance/coupon program because management won't have a conference call for anyone

1.32 Million has been in the air for the last 2 weeks. Please re-read the 10K re: SEC investigation. They do
not state they are under direct investigation, which you would have already heard in the wild if true. I
guarantee AF & Cramer would have publicized that info it was in fact going on. They DO state that there is an
investigation of some sort related to their practices and 3rd party relations. Essentially a vague statement
leading one to believe they are cooperating against the DTG. (IMHO)


If this is a soft statement on their part, and they actually are under a direct and actionable investigation, this
10K would only help to prosecute them. If that is the case - with all that has happened - I will again be
sickened by the ego, greed, and total lack of ethics in GALE + Kriegsman.

"GALE enjoyed center-stage attention from numerous third-party analysts (such as Roth Capital, Maxim) during this
period with buy recommendations and positive share price estimates. Does anyone really believe that these guys
base their recommendations on paid pond-scum? I think not!"


No, you're right...Roth and Maxim base their analysis on the hopes of future banking deals for their firms. Most
research/opinion is "paid" in some way. The issue is disclosure.

Abraxix,


Try and stay within the boundaries of reality, rather than fantasy. If you want to be taken seriously, what you
say needs to have some credibility. A short group corrupting DTG is simply not credible or believable, not
even to the GALE bulls, I don't think.


If Ahn and company didn't know, after reading published DTG articles, that a disclaimer was necessary, then
they are some of the most incompetent management I have seen in a while. Stock sales the same. What the
heck were they thinking that 6 insiders could sell at the same time? Just dumb. At best these guys are
clueless, a few bricks short of a full load. And that scenario just doesn't fly with me, that they were so
clueless. They need to go, IMO.


18 Mar 2014, 04:24 PM


P Man
Bryce, wouldn't it be fair to say that you are lacking credibility by defending this company and management
for weeks, to all of a sudden becoming one of its bashers?


Personally, I think most CEO's are scoundrels to some degree so things like this don't surprise me that much.
I look more at the business model and base my valuation on that. Warren Buffet looks for companies with a
business model so strong that an idiot could run the company, because some day, an idiot will run the
company.


In biotech, their business model is their clinical platform. If it's strong and positioned well, it's a good model. In
my opinion, that hasn't changed with the current flap with GALE. Nothing fundamentally has changed; Neuvax
has a better than 50% chance of having a positive p3 trial (in my opinion) and I feel Abstral sales will hit their
guidance this year. That is why I am staying with it.

Well by hook or crook (mostly crook) the shorts were determined to get the share price below $2.00 so they
could cover, and they succeeded


You mean $3.00, not $2.00

Sorry P Man, but you're fundamentally incorrect regarding Buffet. He does look for strong business models -
companies that he can easily understand and that have a large moat, etc. But Buffet primarily invests in the
folks who run those companies. All his agreements are done literally with a handshake, which to my
knowledge he has only regretted once. Would you do anything with this management on a handshake?


19 Mar 2014, 09:18 AM


P Man
'Shaking hands' simply means he's agreeing to the deal. It does not mean he is necessarily giving his seal of
approval to management.


He's been quoted saying this many times.


And since I have many shares of GALE (in at $1.80), I'd love to shake hands with the person responsible for
my profit.


19 Mar 2014, 02:49 PM


scotttav2014
if u didn't sell when it was nearly 8 dollars then wow......all I can say is wow....yeah u have a small profit, but at
nearly 8 you would have had a huge profit......bulls make money, bears make money....ah u know the rest


19 Mar 2014, 05:19 PM


P Man
I've sold portions along the way up to $6. What's left is long term. If you're a trader - which it seems like you
are - then you probably would have sold at $3 had you bought at $1.80. Most of my investments are long
term, for obvious reasons.


19 Mar 2014, 11:00 PM


scotttav2014
yes, day trader.....but I never knock people that don't go with my methods...long term investors can also make
money....I just would rather have 500 now then possibly 1000 next week....because the macro doesn't look
that great for the market....it looks like yellen broke herself in good today with certain language that the
market didn't care for.....I think the market is very toppy at these levels and look for a 10 percent correction
through the spring.....good luck in your trading


19 Mar 2014, 11:06 PM


P Man
If you're an investor, 10% corrections don't mean much. Over time, it'll correct back.

P Man,


I have never been negative on GALE's pipeline. I consider myself to have been duped by the management in regards
to DTG. If calling a spade a spade is bashing then there's nothing I can do about that. I'd like to see all GALE top
management leave the company, for the good and the sake of the patients and doctors involved with the on going
trials.


I don't care what you think about my credibility. I just thought the statements by Abraxix were a bit "out there".


Keep drinking the GALE management kool-aid. These are some of the dumbest decisions I have seen a company
management make in a while.


18 Mar 2014, 05:13 PM


Nataku
I actually respect what Bryce says. He did a great amount of research and defended GALE's trials and
results. And he has the right to be upset at the DTG issue. It may not bother other investors, but we all have
different priorities and values, and this is a big one for him.


My hope is that the SEC comes out saying GALE is not responsible and all of this dies down.


18 Mar 2014, 05:17 PM


P Man
I'm sure Abraxix cares about what you think about him as much as you care about what I think about you. Oh,
I forgot, you're the only one allowed to have opinions here.


As for 'drinking the kool-aid', it clear to me you did not understand my post.

I agree that NeuVax has an excellent potential to be approved eventually. I’ve circulated this with reputed
physicians and biotech analysts and they all agreed. Actually two of the physicians I’ve discussed with even
bought into GALE (I am sorry for that now). I also agree that management is guilty and has poor execution
when it comes to managing a publicly traded company. However I’d like to add that DTGs tactics are nothing
exceptional. Most IR/PR firms pay ‘independent’ writers for their ‘research’ published online. No disclosures
are made about these payments.

No, most IR/PR firms (legit ones) do not pay anyone for research published online. That is what scum stock
promoters do, not what legit companies do. And lack of disclosure about it is a HUGE problem. Not
something to be glossed over lightly.

I personally know of at least a couple of well established IR/PR firms that are employing the same tactics
(directly or indirectly). And here you can read about another persons experience:

It certainly does not make any of them right. Nor GALE's management should be acquitted based on that.

Thanks for that link. It is clear there are some bad IR/PR actors out there pushing the stocks of junk companies. DTG
is not the only one.


But this is the scum or the IR/PR world. Any of their clients should be immediately suspect.


Here's hoping that Mylant comes clean and tells the world exactly who has approached him with these offers and
what companies are stooping so low as to hire undisclosed paid touts.


This is not the behavior of legit firms and honest mangement teams.

I am not oblivious to the fact that all this surrounding gale stinks....I do however think that this is a very dangerous
stock to be short at these levels.....from almost 8 bucks down to 3 ALL of this crap surrounding the company are
FULLY baked in.....if management gets replaced, this stock doubles in one session.....if great trial results come out,
this stock doubles in one session.....I am a suffering long in full disclosure, but I will keep this stock all the way to zero
if need be.....I refuse to sell as the shorts are crushing it while it is down.....Bryce, you panic sold....in a few months
you will wish you would have waited to sell when it is 5 bucks

You also told me that I would be regretting my sell yesterday. I was very clear why I sold, due to my loss of confidence

Take it for what is worth the mentioned companies CYTR and GALE are poised for huge upside in months/years
ahead. There is little ( if any) downside when compared to huge upside from here regardless of all these noises. 
Please take note that I was not paid $300 or any compensation for this comment lol


30 Mar 2014, 05:46 AM


shmori
My experience has been that the management that resorts to questionable misleading immoral marketing
tactics like this does NOT have shareholders' best interest in mind but rather their own stock option plan. A
great drug speaks for itself, doesn't have to have shady business practices to prop it up. I was long on CYTR.
Not anymore.


30 Mar 2014, 12:56 PM


Rationality
If they have to prop it up through shady practices then perhaps this suggests that management might have
little, or no, confidence in the company's own products. Also, given all this, do shareholders themselves now
have any confidence in what management says in terms of statements and the figures that it puts out? All a
bit dubious.

User 4542301
"If they have to prop it up through shady practices then perhaps this suggests that management might have
little, or no, confidence in the company's own products."


Management having no confidence in the vaccine is not consistent with the science, IMO.


At 18 months, the vaccine showed clinical efficacy (p value .04). Bears will argue that at 24 months and 60
months the vaccine "failed" and showed no clinical efficacy. However, only 58 patients, or 55% received what
was eventually determined to be the optimum dosing of Nuevax, 6 consecutive monthly injections. (See
"Months Vaccinated" at top right of chart on page 2596 of Phase II Study results)

Furthermore, at the 24 month interval, though the P value was .08, the vaccine was associated with a 57%
decrease in relative risk of recurrence of cancer. See page 2597 in above link.


Adding boosters every 6 months after the initial treatment also improved results. So, bottom line, almost half
the patients in the Phase II study did not receive the optimum dosing which was subsequently established.
Looking at those who did receive the optimum dosing as well as boosters, there was zero (0%) disease
recurrence at the 24 and 36 month intervals, and just 5.6% at the 60 months interval, versus 25.9%
recurrence rate for the control group. That's a recurrence reduction of 78.4%.

I would not want to be a short on GALE, who shorted it based on the science.

31 Mar 2014, 11:03 AM


Meltdownman
Why don't the shorts just go and tell the patients that the medicine does not work, that the company is corrupt and a
sham, they don't believe in their own medicine because they need 300 dollar articles to prop up the company's
executives, and all the money they are spending on the patients' medicine they are being injected with is just for
show. While you're at it tell the patients to join the lawsuits because you can make even more money and the lawsuits
increase. That way you can feel justified for your short position, feel confident that the money now will be spent on
lawyers instead of other studies so that it will bankrupt the company and thus drive the price down. Yeah, that's it, feel
better at night knowing what you have accomplished by screwing over patient care and knowing that your wife and
daughters will just have to suffer through their current treatments. Look them in the face and let them know you are
part of the problem and not part of the solution. God bless the work you are doing for humanity and keeping the fight
against money grubbing investors. After all, we don't want anyone to make money including the company. We are
proud of the work you are doing here.

orting a stock vigorously leads to stops being taken out. The firms know where these stops are placed.
Therefore it is easy to figure out how low the stock price will go. So people will lose money either because of
the stops in place and/or panic selling for fear of losing more money. It is one of the oldest games in the book
that has been exacerbated by the removal of the old rule to prevent shorting unless the stock price was rising
(uptick rule). Furthermore, the challenge on any article works both ways (either long or short (in this case).
So, people criticizing those who believed in positive articles should also question those articles that are
negative on a stock. Case in point, CYTR was written up as being undervalued even with the alleged
violations of wrongdoing. This article was written by someone affiliated the THE STREET of all places by
someone who was being paid.


02 Apr 2014, 09:53 AM


Meltdownman
So as a result of all this shorting based on one article the company will now have to vigorously defend
themselves using attorneys which takes away money that would otherwise be used to go towards research
and additional trials that involve real patients.


02 Apr 2014, 10:38 AM

Meltdown,


I asked you to explain your presupposition that shorting the stock would lead to "screwing over patient care".
Instead you explained how shorting the stock would have the effect that "people [i.e. long investors - such as
yourself?] will lose money". I'm still waiting for an answer to my original question.

"So as a result of all this shorting based on one article the company will now have to vigorously defend

Utterly ludicrous. No company ever had to hire attorneys because their stock was shorted. This company is
hiring attorneys because it is being sued, and it is being sued for reasons elaborated in excruciating detail in
the above article.

Rationality
Speaking generally (and not specifically) if a company has excellent, life-saving, products then it is immaterial
what happens on the legal front as patients would be unaffected. A company can be made to pay multiple
millions of dollars to settle lawsuits and that would likely lead its stock price to crash but, ultimately, its life-
saving products would survive all that as another company would surely move in and buy up the financially
gutted company so as to acquire its products and continue its life-saving work.


This shows that dabbling in a certain stocks while mixing it with moral and altruistic concerns is never a good
idea. Those who invoke moral/altruistic concerns while being investors are erecting an artificial construct
intended to parry away serious questions about possibly dubious practices by management.


04 Apr 2014, 04:13 AM


Meltdownman
Follow the money...more money spent on lawyers fees instead of research and including more patients in the
studies (which is sponsored by the company and not the insurance industry - which aren't cheap)...what don't
you get?


04 Apr 2014, 04:46 AM


Meltdownman
No company's are sued by those who lost money because the company's value declined by an article who
alleges certain actions by an outside firm.


Isn't it amazing that the Street has now had another author saying that CYTR is now undervalued after
previous allegations by paid writers of the STREET say CYTR is a fraud?


So you believe everything you read here on SA or the authors on THE STREET or is it selective just
comprehension? Lawyers can't even get the company's name right as to who they are suing. Look at the
corrections put out by the law firms.


04 Apr 2014, 04:59 AM


Meltdownman
I didn't realize that being altruistic was such a bad thing. I guess we should just go tell the patients to give up.
That would be the moral thing to do.

Cognitive dissonance is a great point, as this is precisely why people make poor decisions while investing in
the stock market, and it is so important to try and be unemotional and or focus on a yr from now in the case of
GALE.


01 Apr 2014, 10:51 PM


TimeOnTarget
@Rocketman33


Agree completely about trying to be unemotional. It really can be hard to do--we all have failings to one
degree or another.


This is a pretty cool list of cognitive biases that I try to look at and consider in light of my own behavior or
stock analysis, as the case may be. Naturally it also helps in spotting other peoples' analyses or behavior that
indicates a cognitive bias may be exerting undue influence.


http://bit.ly/U3c28e


Although cognitive dissonance can be a very powerful cognitive force (nobody thinks they are a jerk;
everyone thinks they are a good person), I have a bit less sympathy for those who allow cognitive dissonance
to run rampant after presented with facts like those in this article and the other one that Richard did. No one
likes to be wrong, but really, some of these people need to get a grip.

GALE is extremely undervalued. The company has one drug to sell, one in Phase III, few in Phase II and stock is still
in $2.00.


Buying it at this price may give us 1,000% return in one-two years. Patience is needed on this stock in order to see
the profit.

@scotttav2014, Your confidence should be applauded. I think there are many other folks like you who bought
in above $4, $5, and even $6. (This is contrary to what some other person on SA claimed, that funds were
mostly the ones that bought at the higher levels.) As long as the retail investors have holding power and do
not need the cash for some other purpose in the short run their investment in GALE should be ok in the
medium-to-long term. For the immediate term, potentially financially ruinous lawsuits could keep the stock
price range bound.


05 Apr 2014, 09:17 PM


jsIRA, Marketplace Contributor
My buys:


First buy $4.01 
Second buy 2.15.


My strategy is always in three steps:  
Double position when the first buy down 50%.  
Double it again, if it is down another 50%. 
Do it as long as I believe that the fundamental does not change.


For GALE case:


I think current fundamental is actually better than the same time last year but the stock price is exactly the same as
year ago (April 5)


If I bought K shares at $4.01, 
second buy should be 2K shares at $2.00 and third one 4Kat $1.00.


But my second buy a little higher than $2.00 after I saw it bounced from $2.15 to $2.70 then went back to $2.15 again,
a possible double bottom.


Now my cost base is at $2.77 with 3K shares.

you will make a nice profit if you hang tight....once the SEC clears them we could see a nice pop in gale....all
the ambulance chasers chasing the lawsuits is a joke and a waste of time....I am interested to see what

sentiment is so horrible...those are the kind I usually make a mint on in the end

am able to make good profit and bought shares back and lowered me buy price further down to 2.20.

This thread has been quite quiet recently and I don't know whether the author is still shorting CYTR.


In fact both stocks are moving up huge recently. Almost doubled from their recent lows and almost recovered all the
loses since this article published.


All are manipulations.

Recycled garbage from a short who didn't sell before the stock price started recovering from the united attack several
weeks ago. I guess he failed to coordinate with the other hacks.


How many times will Seeking Shorts re-post this garbage?

Until they've made their short call and enough money to satiate their greed. Some have no limits. They remind me of
the crack fiend that will take you out in an alley for 1$.

Does all this information qualify for whistle blowing status?

Pearson gives us an "I told you so" statement in the beginning of this article and states that the stock traded at $8.00
at the height of what he speculates was a promotion of the stock. He proudly referred us to his article and pointed out
that the stock now trades at $2.00. This leaves the clear impression that he called a move from $8.00 to $2.00. This is
hardly the case. His article was published on March 13, 2014 when the stock was at $3.00. While this is a 33%
decline in the stock this is about in line with what has occurred to a broad swath of emerging biotechnology
companies since a serious correction began in March. He fails to mention this in his report. It appears that the
correction in the stock is due to a sector decline rather than his article. In fact, Adam Feuerstein had made the same
allegations nearly a month earlier when the stock was trading in the low $5.00. I think it is incumbent on an author to
state price changes when he makes an "I told you so statement" as Pearson does in this article.

"While this is a 33% decline in the stock this is about in line with what has occurred to a broad swath of
emerging biotechnology companies since a serious correction began in March."


On March 13, the IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) representing the broadest "swath" of biotech
companies closed at 254.80, BELOW the current level (even after this week's sell-off) of 268.59.


In short, IBB more than recovered from its March decline, and was as high as 277.82 last week. This includes
"emerging biotechnology companies", some which are performing spectacularly. The author's point remains
intact: to explain the precipitous decline of GALE in the face of the general *rise* in biotech stocks since then,
one must consider the sordid facts surrounding this particularly company.

Should we make our investment decisions by following seeking alpha articles? No, we should do are own research
and focus on what's going on with the company and its drug pipeline. Instead of reading articles and making
emotional decisions, we should use that energy to do more in-depth analysis of individual small companies. IMO cytr
is a good buy here and will see new 52 week high after phase2 data on glioblastoma either end of this year or early
next year.

Actually the high after article published was 3.50.


Company's stock price is based on its fundamentals. Recent decline is purely from worse than expected
Abstral sales numbers. Nothing related to this article.

I stand corrected on GALE. I see that the author was not short when he wrote those reports. From the tone of the
reports I assumed they were sells. I guess my question is what was your recommendation on the March 13 report and
what is it now?


27 Aug 2014, 05:33 PM


Rationality
I wonder why there are no more articles on GALE published in SA. I'm looking to go long but am waiting for a
compelling argument to do so for those who have done some research on it.

because the stock already got beaten down. No need for the shorts to write anything on it now.
