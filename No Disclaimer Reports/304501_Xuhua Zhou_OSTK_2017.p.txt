Retail Investors Beware: You Are Not Investing Alongside George Soros
And John Burbank

OSTK


Retail investors largely misunderstood the nature of Overstock’s warrant
transactions with brand-name institutional investors.


While Overstock predicted a $500 million tZERO ICO, the actual amount will most
likely be significantly less.


The questionable background and experience of entities involved in the tZERO ICO
further heightens the risks of an unsuccessful ICO.


Jonathan Johnson, the man leading charge at tZERO has significantly reduced his
OSTK position since May.


At the end of the cryptocurrency hype, Overstock will likely see 50%+ downside as
investors turn their attention back to its legacy business.

I have been following Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) for the past few months with
intrigue. The stock spiked upwards of 30% since its earnings release on Nov 8, and I
believe much of the move is tied to two warrant transactions struck between the
Company and Quantum Partners and Passport Capital.


I am pleased to announce that we have sold a warrant to a fund affiliated with
Passport Capital LLC for $2.6 million to purchase 1,250,000 shares of our common
stock at $40.45 per share until February 7, 2018. We also sold a warrant to Quantum
Partners LP for $4 million to purchase 2,472,188 shares of our common stock at
$40.45 per share until January 2, 2018. Quantum Partners LP is a private investment
fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC.


Given Overstock’s foray into cryptocurrency and ICO, the stock has garnered significant
interest from retail investors who may lack basic understanding of the warrant
transactions disclosed in Overstock’s earnings release.


First of all, large hedge funds employ many individual portfolio managers, with each
responsible for his separate P&L. Given the size of these warrant investments - $2.6
million in Passport’s case and $4 million in Soros’ case - it is highly unlikely either John
Burbank or George Soros had any input at all in making this investment decision.


Secondly, the short-term warrants sold to the two funds were likely priced the day before
earnings release at over 70% discount to their market value. At 25 million shares
outstanding, warrants tied to 3.7 million shares sold in these transactions represent over
15% dilution. It is hard to believe management would sell such dilutive warrants to
hedge funds if it truly believes its stock is undervalued. I estimate the warrants sold in
these two separate transactions represent a roughly 70% discount to their fair market
value; hence, making it a no-brainer decision for Soros and Passport to jump onboard
as investors.

When calculated with the market-implied volatility, the implied value of the warrants sold
to Passport Capital is around $9.3 million. Similarly, Quantum paid $4 million for
warrants with an implied value of around $14.8 million. With a liquidity event, these
technical investors would have already locked in significant profit by purchasing such
warrants without taking any capital risks.


Thirdly, retail investors need to understand that when purchasing such warrants,
sophisticated hedge fund investors often short-sell the underlying stock to hedge their
exposure. In this case, after the post-earnings spike, the warrants purchased by the
Soros portfolio manager for $1.62 are worth $12 a warrant. The portfolio manager at
Soros can lock in his substantial profit by shorting Overstock at the prevailing market
price. I believe portfolio managers at Soros and Passport are most likely shorting
Overstock to hedge its long exposure and lock in a profit of close to $40 million.

Success of tZERO ICO is highly uncertain


Lastly, by selling such deeply discounted dilutive warrants to well-known hedge funds,
the management at Overstock seems to care more about generating hype than creating
shareholder value. If they truly believed Overstock was underpriced at $40, the highly
dilutive warrant transactions demonstrate a lack of fiduciary responsibility.


In conclusion, retail investors in Overstock should spend time understanding the nature
of the warrant transactions and be aware hedge fund investors typically hedge their
cheap warrants to create alpha. Blindly following the headlines will likely result in you
taking the exact opposite position of the famed investors you thought you were
following.


Overstock’s recent stock price movements can largely be attributed to the growing
interest in its cryptocurrency-related businesses. Much of the excitement hinges on the
highly touted tZERO ICO.


Given the importance of tZERO ICO to Overstock’s valuation, many investors paid little
attention to the last point made regarding tZERO in Overstock’s earnings release.


tZERO expects to launch the ICO process around November 30, 2017, subject to
market conditions and regulatory developments.


Overstock had consistently stated it would launch the pre-sale on November 15  in prior
conferences. To explain the delay, it further stated in its press release.


th


Therefore, we have decided to move the ICO pre-sale process out to allow for
broadening the registration of all interested participants and account for any
uncertainty regarding the potential fork.


Such explanation suggests tZERO needs more time to market the ICO than expected;
generally, a bad sign indicating a lack of sufficient interest. Furthermore, the ICO market
has slowed substantially in the last month after a few spectacular blow-ups such as
Tezos, and a general lack of liquidity in the aftermarket.

Who are Overstock’s partners in the purported $500 million ICO?


While publicly boasting a $500 million figure, Argon Group’s pipeline document suggests
the internal expectation for tZERO’s raise is actually significantly less. The indicated
expected raise is only $200 million, and based on the current progress of two of Argon’s
other ongoing projects, the actual amount will likely be significantly less.


tZERO’s ambition of raising $500 million in the largest ICO ever seems very much
misplaced in the current market environment. If Overstock were to further postpone or
end up raising significantly less in its much hyped ICO, its stock price will correct
significantly.


Overstock’s press release on the tZERO ICO includes two partners, Argon Group and
RenGen. Specifically, Argon Group is tasked with managing the ICO process for
Overstock’s record breaking capital raise. A closer look at Argon’s website leads me to
question whether it has the ability to manage such a massive ICO.


On Argon’s website, it only lists three successful deals, and the largest deal it raised
was $30 million in June 2017, when the ICO market was red hot. Since then, the three
ongoing deals seem to be progressing not as well. Despite launching Science
Blockchain in early September, a whopping two months have passed, and it has only
raised $12 million. When the ICO was launched, it was hyped as the next incubator and
was going to raise up to $100 million. Another ongoing ICO Protos launched in late
September has only raised a bit over $5 million since launch.

Insider selling from tZERO


Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise


Based on Argon’s track record, tZERO’s $500 million ICO raise appears as realistic as
Science Blockchain’s $100 million raise.


Another partner, RenGen appears to have a whopping five employees. Before buying
into all the hype surrounding tZERO, retail investors should carefully examine the
current deals managed by Argon Group and reassess whether the $500 million ICO
figure is even at all realistic.


Another point overlooked by many retail investors is the fact the president of Medici
Ventures, the block-chain focused subsidiary of Overstock, has significantly reduced his
stake in Overstock over the past few months. Jonathan Johnson has sold 43% of his
Overstock shares since May of this year.


As his past trading pattern would indicate, his share sales have usually been a highly
accurate indicator of future slumps in stock prices.

Conclusion

Retail investors should carefully examine the warrant transactions presented in
Overstock’s earnings release and understand their implications to avoid mistakenly
believe they are investing alongside George Soros. Furthermore, additional evidence
suggests the much hyped tZERO ICO is far from a guaranteed success. If the tZERO
ICO follows a similar path as the two currently being managed by Overstock’s partner
Argon Group, it is likely Overstock will correct over 50% and trade back to levels prior to
the build-up of all the ICO hypes.
