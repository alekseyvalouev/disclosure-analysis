Wayfair Doubles Down On Poisoning Its (And Its Partners') Customers
Nov. 18, 2015 11:08 AM ET19 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


I had three items of furniture sold by Wayfair tested for formaldehyde, and two of
them showed toxic levels.


In addition to selling these two items on its own website, the company is selling them
on the websites of the partners for which it does fulfillment.


I suspect that these two toxic cabinets are only the tip of the iceberg.


Wayfair continues to sell both and actually slashed the price of the most toxic one in
what appears to me to be an attempt to dump it.


The deny-and-attack strategy that Wayfair appears to be adopting is what Lumber
Liquidators tried in the 2-3 months after the devastating 60 Minutes story.


Following up on my article last week, Why Wayfair Is My Largest Short Position, on
Monday afternoon I gave a 74-slide presentation at the Robin Hood Investors Conference
in which I shared additional details of my short thesis on the company (and followed up
with an interview on Bloomberg TV).


The most relevant new information I revealed was:


I had three items of furniture sold by Wayfair tested for formaldehyde, and two of them
showed toxic levels.
In addition to selling these two items on its own website, the company is selling them
on the websites of the partners for which it does fulfillment (including Wal-Mart
(NYSE:WMT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)), so Wayfair is
poisoning other companies' customers, not just its own.
Based on what I've learned from my two-year involvement with Lumber Liquidators
(NYSE:LL), I suspect that a fairly high percentage of furniture and other wood products
that Wayfair is selling that are manufactured in China and are constructed of wood
composite materials such as medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and particleboard have
dangerous levels of formaldehyde.
Thousands of products Wayfair is selling are potentially affected, as a search under
"MDF" on Wayfair's website yielded 18,461 items.

This problem is likely rooted in the fact that Wayfair appears to do no compliance or
quality control of its own; instead, it seems to be relying on little more than assurances
from the more than 7,000 suppliers that provide Wayfair with the more than seven
million items it sells on its various websites.


What would any sensible, honest, ethical and reputable company do when confronted with
evidence that it is selling products that don't comply with environmental regulations in the
largest state, California, and therefore is likely jeopardizing the health and safety of its
customers? Wayfair should:


1) Immediately suspend sales not only of the products in question, but also any other
products that might be toxic (in this case, at the very least, all furniture and other wood
products manufactured in China that are constructed of wood composite materials such as
MDF and particleboard);


2) Ask the person who revealed the test results (me) for an official copy of them so that my
results can be verified (I've posted all three here);


3) Once the results of the tests I commissioned are confirmed, contact all customers who
bought these products, inform them of the potential danger, and offer a free return and
either a full refund or replacement;


4) Launch its own large-scale testing program to determine how widespread this problem
is; and


5) Make a substantial investment in compliance, which would include hiring a senior-level
Chief of Compliance, engage firms that specialize in on-the-ground monitoring of suppliers
(especially those in Asia), and regularly test products being sold on its site.


Obviously, many of these things will take time, but at the very least I expected Wayfair to
immediately stop selling the two toxic products I publicly identified on Monday on this slide
in my presentation (page 54):

Indeed, Wayfair had been wise enough to quickly cease selling all laminate flooring from
Ark, a Chinese company, right around the time that a New York Times reporter called to
ask about high formaldehyde levels in Ark laminate flooring I'd had tested. In light of this,
surely Wayfair would be wise enough to suspend sales of the furniture products I'd flagged
as toxic, right?


WRONG!


I am truly flabbergasted that Wayfair not only hasn't suspended sales of the two products
in question, but initially slashed the price of the most toxic one (the Shabby 1 cabinet,
which is emitting formaldehyde at more than three times the CARB2 limit) from $114.99 to
$89.99. Is the overnight 22% price cut an attempt to dump a product that Wayfair now
knows is toxic before customers learn that it might be poisonous? Here's a screenshot
from Wayfair's website yesterday, where one can see the "On Sale" price of $89.99:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3694436-wayfair-doubles-poisoning-partners-customers 4/16


Worse yet, Wayfair isn't content to dump this toxic item on its own customers: it's also
selling it on the websites of the partners for which it does fulfillment. Here are current
screenshots showing the same product, "Sold by Wayfair", on the websites of Wal-Mart,
Kohl's and Staples:

In addition, Wayfair also continues to sell the other toxic product, the TMS Mission
cabinet, on both its website as well as Wal-Mart's, as these screenshots show:

Once Walmart, Kohl's and Staples realize that Wayfair is, possibly knowingly, selling toxic
products to their customers, thereby exposing these companies to significant reputational,
legal and regulatory risk, I have to imagine that they will reconsider doing business with
Wayfair.


An Update From This Morning


Curiously, when I checked the websites of Wayfair and its three partners this morning,
Wayfair had increased the price of the Shabby 1 cabinet to $119.99 on its own website:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/18/saupload_Screen_shot_2015-11-18_at_11.40.23_AM.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3694436-wayfair-doubles-poisoning-partners-customers 8/16


Even more curiously, however, Wayfair continues to sell the same product on the websites
of Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Staples at yesterday's sale price of $89.99. This is the first time
I've seen Wayfair charging different prices for the same product on its own website vs. its
partners' websites.


What's going on? Is the price cut yesterday across all sites and the price hike this morning
only on Wayfair's website a computer-driven pricing algorithm, having nothing to do with
me publicly identifying this item as toxic on Monday? Or is Wayfair (or Zingz & Thingz)
playing a nefarious game, trying to dump a known toxic product on unsuspecting
customers?


Deny-and-Attack Strategy


For the health and safety of Wayfair's customers, I hope the company immediately
suspends sales of these two products (and similar ones). As someone who is short the
stock, however, I'm delighted that the company has not only continued to sell them, but in
fact appears to be rushing to dump the most dangerous item as quickly as possible on
unsuspecting customers, while simultaneously attacking its critics (mainly me).


This deny-and-attack strategy is what Lumber Liquidators adopted in the 2-3 months after
the devastating 60 Minutes story, and it failed spectacularly as the stock plunged by
another two-thirds.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3694436-wayfair-doubles-poisoning-partners-customers 9/16


The parallels are striking. Rather than suspend sales of the Chinese-made laminate that
60 Minutes, I and others had tested, which showed formaldehyde levels many times the
CARB2 limit, Lumber Liquidators slashed prices and rushed to sell it. Wayfair appears to
be doing the same.


And soon after the 60 Minutes story aired, Lumber Liquidators posted this attack on its
website:


These attacks are driven by a small group of short-selling investors who are working
together for the sole purpose of making money by lowering our stock price. They are
using any means to try and scare our customers with inaccurate allegations. Their
motives and methods are wrong and we will fight these false attacks on all fronts.


In addition, Lumber Liquidators founder and Chairman Tom Sullivan went on CNBC and
accused 60 Minutes, one of the most respected news programs in the world, of "making
up this story" and defiantly said the company would continue selling the laminate because
"we will sell what customers want."


Similarly, Wayfair's co-founder and CEO, Niraj Shah, went on CNBC last week and told
Jim Cramer that "These short sellers just look for a stock they can knock around and
make a quick buck or two" and slammed the New York Times, one of the most respected
newspapers in the world, saying that I "managed to get [the NYT] to write the story for
him."


This Isn't a Short-and-Distort Campaign


It's almost not worth responding to the usual trope about we're-the-victim-of-a-conspiracy-
of-nefarious-self-serving-short-sellers, but a few points are in order.


I've spent my entire life building a good reputation. Of course I have an interest in making
money - that's my job - but the idea that I would destroy my reputation by inventing a story
to smear an innocent company to benefit one position (among three dozen) in my portfolio
is beyond absurd. It would also be easy for the company to show that I'm lying - and I'd
likely end up banned from the industry (or worse). One might not agree with my analysis
or conclusions, but know that my beliefs are genuinely held.


Nor have I done any trading around last week's New York Times' article or my own article
and presentation. In fact, my last trade in Wayfair's stock was on Sept. 23rd, when I
increased my short position.

Rather than having a conflict of interest, I believe I have a confluence of interest: in
speaking out, I am both doing my job and also serving the public interest by warning
Wayfair, suppliers, regulators and customers about the likely dangers of certain Wayfair
products.


I find it quite ironic that the company is accusing me of distorting the truth for my own
financial gain when it is, in fact, the senior executives of the company who have far
greater incentives to do so than I. This is one of roughly three dozen positions in my fund
(only 11 of which are shorts), so it's not going to make or break me one way or another. In
contrast, the outcome of this battle means everything to Shah and his fellow executives,
both reputationally and financially. Shah and the other co-founder, Steven Conine, each
own Wayfair stock worth nearly $600 million and the top eight executives at Wayfair have
been selling an average of nearly $7 million of stock per month for the past seven months,
led by Shah and Conine, at $2.7 million per month each.


So let's be clear which of us has overwhelming incentives to present a false and
misleading picture of Wayfair…


But What About Others Selling Similar Products?


In a note to clients yesterday rebutting my presentation, a Wedbush analyst wrote:


...we do not think W has a compliance problem. We think the company has
adequate controls over suppliers and no major online-only competitor, including
Amazon, has a Chief Compliance Officer that Tilson believes is necessary.


Tilson points to tests indicating that 2 of 3 MDF-based furniture products (out of
18,337 offered) had excess formaldehyde levels. We note that other large internet
companies such as Amazon sell similar products (such as this one) from one of the
same manufacturers in question, Zingz and Thingz, suggesting this is not a Wayfair-
specific issue if it is one at all.


I agree that other merchants are selling the two toxic items that I identified. For example,
here are screenshots of both being sold by other merchants on Amazon's website right
now:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3694436-wayfair-doubles-poisoning-partners-customers 11/16


Like Wayfair, Amazon and any other merchant carrying these two products should
immediately suspend sales, and then invest in compliance to make sure that no other
toxic items poison their customers. In particular, in light of the known potential dangers of
composite wood products, especially those made in China, it is irresponsible for any
retailer to sell these products without a rigorous compliance program in place. The entire
industry, not just Wayfair, needs to wake up and take steps to deal with what I suspect is a
widespread problem.

But is the Wedbush analyst seriously defending Wayfair by channeling his inner Richard
Nixon and arguing that “If two wrongs don’t make a right, try three”???


I will email Jeff Bezos directly today and make him aware that Amazon appears to have
the same problem Wayfair does – but this doesn’t excuse Wayfair poisoning its own (and
its partners’) customers (however inadvertently) and, worse yet, failing to fix the problem
once made aware of it.


Lastly, I think Wayfair has a much bigger problem than Amazon does for two reasons.
First, Amazon is more than 50 times Wayfair’s size, so it can easily suspend sales of any
questionable products and invest a few million dollars in compliance with no impact to its
business. Second, unlike Wayfair, Amazon isn’t trying to build a trusted brand in the
furniture and home goods space, so if this issue becomes widely known, I think customers
are far more likely to abandon Wayfair than Amazon, especially in light of the latter’s far
better service and long-term customer loyalty.


Conclusion


I am short Wayfair's stock because I believe it's significantly overvalued, primarily because
(as I wrote in my article last week and presentation on Monday) it has one of the worst
business models I've ever seen. Competing head-to-head vs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),
Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Target (NYSE:TGT), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), etc. (did I
mention AMAZON???), I think the company's odds of ever reaching breakeven, much less
earning a profit, much less earning enough of a profit to justify a $3 billion market cap are
close to zero.


This formaldehyde problem is a catalyst for my short position, to be sure, but isn't likely to
be a major issue if - and this is a big if - Wayfair is smart in handling it. It was smart to stop
selling Ark laminate flooring, but the company is being very dumb right now in (apparently)
adopting a deny-and-attack strategy. It's just not that expensive to temporarily suspend
sales of a small fraction of the seven million products Wayfair sells and implement a
proper compliance program to ensure that its customers aren't being poisoned (unless the
problems are more widespread than I believe, which would explain the company's recent
actions - and spell doom for the stock).


As I noted earlier, for the health and safety of Wayfair's customers, I hope the company
immediately suspends sales of the two toxic products I've identified (and similar ones) and
implements the other obvious steps I've outlined. As someone short the stock, however, I
hope they channel their inner Lumber Liquidators and turn a manageable situation into a
disaster. Stay tuned - this could get interesting…
