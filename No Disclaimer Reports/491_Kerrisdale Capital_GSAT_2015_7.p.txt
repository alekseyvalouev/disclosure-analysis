Globalstar: Wireless Industry Presents United Front Against TLPS,
Putting Globalstar In Danger

Summary


Today's public panel discussion brings together GOOG, MSFT, and more in the fight
against TLPS.


A wide range of wireless stakeholders now recognizes TLPS as bad technology and
bad policy.


As opposition to TLPS grows, the risk of an FCC rejection has become very real.


Today a who's who of important and influential stakeholders in the wireless industry are
coming together publicly to voice their opposition to Globalstar's (NYSEMKT:GSAT)
proposed Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) - a concept once touted by Globalstar as
the only solution to a dire Wi-Fi spectrum crisis but now increasingly recognized by a
broad and growing range of observers as bad technology and bad public policy.


Details for the event are available here.


Even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),
rivals in businesses like search, have joined forces to highlight TLPS's shortcomings - not
just the interference risks it poses to other users of the 2.4GHz band but the ugly
precedent it would set in granting a single private party de facto control over public
spectrum. Today's event, organized by Microsoft and the non-profit Open Technology
Institute and hosted at Microsoft's Innovation & Policy Center in Washington, D.C., will
include the following experts:


From Google, Dr. Andrew Clegg, the spectrum engineering lead spearheading several
of the company's wireless initiatives;
From Microsoft, Michael Daum, technology policy strategist;
From the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association - a strong and respected
advocate for rural broadband access - Vice President Alex Phillips (a member of the
FCC's Consumer Advisory Committee);
From the Wi-Fi Alliance, the key Wi-Fi industry group, Russell Fox, counsel;
From the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the leading trade
group for cable companies, Paul Caritj, counsel; and

From the Open Technology Institute, a non-profit think tank focused on "freedom and
justice in the digital age," Michael Calabrese, a member of the U.S. Department of
Commerce's Spectrum Management Advisory Committee and former member of the
president's spectrum reform working group in 2011-12.


Each of these participants has voiced concern about Globalstar's TLPS proposal in FCC
filings. Google's filing is available here and Microsoft's here. WISPA's latest filing is here;
the Wi-Fi Alliance's latest filing is here and NCTA's is here.


The Open Technology Institute has filed criticism here, here and here.


The opposition to TLPS does not fall along conventional partisan or factional lines. While
groups like the Open Technology Institute and the cable industry were at loggerheads over
net neutrality, they agree on the problems with TLPS. Likewise, the predominantly rural-
focused members of WISPA have historically had a strong ally in Ajit Pai, one of the
Republican FCC commissioners, while unlicensed interest groups including the Wi-Fi
Alliance have often benefited from the support of Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the
Democratic commissioners; yet they all see eye to eye on TLPS. Globalstar, by contrast,
has no strong allies, in keeping with its failure to offer any meaningful benefit to the public.
It simply wants special regulatory treatment in a last-gasp bid to keep its failed business
afloat, and the wireless community is increasingly seeing its self-interested spin for what it
is.


Since making our Globalstar short position public, we have always maintained that the
stock is worthless even if the FCC authorizes TLPS. Thus, we did not fear the possibility
of a near-term approval. But given how intense the opposition to TLPS has grown - and
how stubbornly Globalstar has refused to offer even a hint of a compromise - we now
consider a flat rejection of TLPS a very real possibility. Without the benefit of post-approval
hype over TLPS, it will be hard to prolong Globalstar's survival much longer.


Globalstar supporters once contended that Google, Microsoft, and big cable companies
were among the most likely bidders in what they dreamed would be a frenzied private
auction of Globalstar's spectrum; now that all three have put TLPS's very existence in
serious jeopardy with their strong opposition, that narrative - always, in truth, ridiculous - is
shattered beyond repair. While some shareholders console themselves with the fantasy
that all this opposition must mean that TLPS is somehow a "threat" to the tech giants and
thus very valuable, the reality is that a paid, exclusive Wi-Fi channel would have no effect
on anyone's business model unless its deployment got far enough to cause harmful
interference. Otherwise, how exactly would an exclusive Wi-Fi channel reduce Google or
