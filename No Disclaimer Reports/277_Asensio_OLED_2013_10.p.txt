UDC’s “glaring confessions” contradict its claims.
Confessions were made unbeknownst to
investors and analysts.


Posted on September 27, 2013 by asensio.com


Friday, September 27, 2013.    Universal Display Corporation (“UDC”;


NASDAQ: OLED) claims that it “owns” phosphorescent OLED


technology. However, unbeknownst to investors and analysts the


company has made “glaring confessions and admissions” that


directly contradict its central patent claims. Analysts mistakenly


believe that UDC had something to do with discovering


phosphorescence, or phosphorescent materials, or a particular


organometallic phosphorescent material well suited for OLED


production, such as an iridium-based organometallic


phosphorescent compound, or an OLED with an organometallic


phosphorescent material. UDC has admitted that it did no such


thing; we discuss these “confessions and admissions” below. A


separate asensio.com report shows why UDC cannot claim to have


invented or discovered any phosphorescent iridium compound.


This report, titled “Universal Display’s ludicrous claim of owning


phosphorescence,” provides investors with details on the profound


wealth of knowledge that existed publicly on triplet emission from


organometallic phosphorescent iridium compounds, long before


UDC’s “dramatic breakthrough.”


The confessions show that UDC’s most repeated claims are grossly


over-blown and totally distorted. These confessions and admissions


destroy UDC’s own most central claim, that it “own[s]


phosphorescent emitters” as a result of its purported “dramatic


breakthrough.” They also show UDC taking credit for OLEDs and


phosphorescent phenomena long after they were well known. All of


this goes to show not just UDC’s weak and convoluted position in


patent litigation, but it explains the insecurities that led

management to wrongfully say they contributed in any way to


InterDigital, Inc.


UDC has a long history of making ostentatious, promotional claims


to investors about purportedly inventing and ‘owning’


phosphorescent OLEDs. At an Oppenheimer investor conference on


August 14th, UDC management stated, “We have developed what we


call phosphorescent technology.” At a J.P. Morgan conference in


May, UDC management stated, “We own phosphorescent emitters.”


At another investor conference on September 11th, hosted by


Deutsche Bank, UDC actually mentioned the iridium material that is


behind its grandiose invention claims, stating its owns “[t]he basic


phosphorescent patent … converting this triplet energy into usable
light… you can do this by using an iridium complex material.” Well
it turns out that UDC made all these ostentatious claims to investors


AFTER it had essentially admitted the opposite to the world’s


highest and most respected patent court.


UDC’s “glaring confessions and admissions” are explained by


another scientific expert to mean that UDC has admitted that it


simply added an iridium compound to an existing OLED device


made up of well-known, existing parts. They also show that UDC


does not and cannot claim that it invented the iridium compound it


added, or even that it invented an iridium compound as an


emissive material. The UDC filing plainly and clearly in no


uncertain terms states, “The invention is… not an emitter
compound” (emphasis in original, page 7).


The above extraordinary admission came after UDC conceding in


the same filing that “[f]luorescent emission from organic materials


was already described in 1987,” and that “since fluorescent OLEDs


only differ from phosphorescent OLEDs in the type of emitter


compound used, it is clear that the know-how regarding OLED


materials and structures built up for fluorescent OLEDs is routinely


transferred to phosphorescent OLEDs without any hesitation” (page


6 emphasis added). UDC appears to have given up its so-called


“dramatic invention” claim and admits that its invention was


actually a mere ‘routine transfer’ from existing inventions.


UDC’s confessions continued. UDC attempts to distance itself from


iridium in the same filing, stating that the idea “that the patent is


directed to the provision of certain chemical species… is…
incorrect.”


In simple terms, UDC is stating that its supposed “invention” was


not an iridium compound or even an OLED containing an iridium


compound; UDC tries to claim that it invented any and all


phosphorescent OLED devices.

The accompanying asensio.com report shows just how ludicrous


UDC’s position is. It is indisputable that certain iridium compounds


were well known to be phosphorescent long before UDC ever


conducted its experiments. Specifically, it was well known that the


iridium compound used by UDC was known to produce


phosphorescent emission. Investors should be aware that UDC is


attempting to take credit for more than a decade of work done by


Samsung and others to develop functional phosphorescent OLED


displays, though UDC only did simple, mundane, optimizing


experiments in the mid-1990s, based on more fundamental


discoveries going back to the 1970s, based on phenomena observed


in the 1890s.


We strongly believe that these admissions and confessions,


submitted by UDC to the highest patent court in the world,


indisputably shows that UDC has made no significant contribution


to the development and commercialization of phosphorescent


OLED displays, contrary to UDC’s claims to investors. It also shows


that in patent litigation, UDC is making weak, convoluted


arguments to cover up its disintegrating charade.


As previously reported by asensio.com, this November the


European Patent Office Boards of Appeal will be making a ruling


that could result in sudden death for UDC’s key patent claims on


phosphorescent OLED materials and trigger undisclosed


termination clauses in its Samsung agreement.


* The confessions and admissions are filed in the final appeal of


UDC’s key patent claims. UDC is responsible for paying for the legal


defense of the patent, according to UDC’s filings with the Securities


& Exchange Commission.
