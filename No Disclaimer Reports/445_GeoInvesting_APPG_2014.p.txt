Apptigo (APPG) – The Jig Is
Up, The Same “Sexy” Pump
And Dump Story With A
Different App!
August 15, 2014 By GeoTeam


Apptigo International (APPG) is one of the most obvious
pump and dump (P&D) cases we have come across since
we began investigating P&D’s in our inaugural report
Raystream (RAYS), which now trades at $0.001.


Some of the characters associated with APPG have deep
roots in the P&D game. One character in particular that
caught our attention was Lyle Hauser. Hauser’s company,
The Vantage Group, is well entrenched in the APPG story.
The Vantage Group owns APPG preferred stock that is
convertible into 15,925,000 common shares.


Mr. Hauser has ties to at least six past pump and
dumps either through being an executive of these
companies or by providing capital to them through diluted
financing transactions (convertible securities) via The
Vantage Group Ltd., a company where he holds the
position of Chairman and CEO. Three of these stocks trade
for less than two cents with two of these three received
temporary suspensions from the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Two of the six had their registrations
revoked by the SEC.


In 2012 we actually exposed one of Hauser’s recent P&Ds,
DiMi Telematics International, Inc. (DIMI). The stock fell
from $1.38 to $0.04 (Pre reverse split) in four trading

sessions. Aside from Lyle Hauser, APPG and DIMI share
another trait. Both companies enticed investors about their
involvement in the “sexy” mobile app space. We think
investors will easily put the pieces of the APPG puzzle
together resulting in a quick dump of its shares along the
same magnitude as DIMI’s pump two years ago. In Q2 of
2014, APPG even admits in its filings that it has not even
begun to market its app.


Here is a November 23, 2011 iHub message board post
from an investor expressing frustration over his opinion
that Lyle Hauser has a propensity to be involved with
P&Ds.


“What a bunch of crooks. This is a just one of the
many penny stock scams run by Lyle Hauser. It
fact, his latest scam just registered about a week
ago is First Quantum Ventures, Inc. or DiMi
Telematics dimispeaks.com


DiMi Telematics’s common stock trades on the
OTCQB under the symbol “FQVE”


If you read the Form 8-K submitted about a week
ago, you’ll see Roberto Fata and Barry Tenzer
which are the same crooks involved in another
penny stock scam enacted by Hauser, Motorcars
Auto Group Inc., formerly Associated Automotive
Group Inc.


How many years are we going to have to look on
after pump-and-dump and other penny stocks
scams before the SEC acts? All the investors
lose, and they profit. Hopefully the Securities and
Exchange Commission will indict him and his
coconspirators this time.”

https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 3/16


We are confident that our negative sentiment on APPG will
be shared by other investors if they perform a simple web
search on “Lyle Hauser Vantage Group pump and dump”.


Lyle Hauser / Vantage Group LTD.


Ticker Pump Campaign Price as of August 14, 2014


APPG YES $1.39


DIMI YES *$0.0065


GRBD YES Registration Revoked


LFXG YES $0.0001


MAGI YES Registration Revoked


WLKF YES $0.0001


MDFI YES $0.03


*adjusted for 1 for 100 reverse split in February 2014


We conclude that APPG is just another P&D that is worth
nothing more than what we think it would fetch as a shell
company ($500,000/45 million fully diluted shares), or
$0.01.


Background


APPG completed its reverse merger on April 14, 2014. The
shell that APPG merged into was called Bailus Corp.,
trading under the symbol BALI that went public through a
self-underwritten IPO in 2013 (S-1). Using the self-
underwritten IPO route is a common way to bring shells to
market. It’s cheaper than a traditional IPO and “cleaner”
than buying a shell that has gone through many

https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 4/16


transformations. We noticed that Thomas E. Puzzo (more
on him later) was the legal counsel for BALI per its S-1
filing. Puzzo can be traced back to past shells that ended
up housing P&Ds. BALI’s primary business was that of
buying and selling horses in Ireland, which appears not to
have panned out based on revenues disclosed in its only
10-K filing.


Although some investors may think APPG has only 29
million shares outstanding based on its Q2 2014 filings, the
reverse merger resulted in 45.15 million fully diluted
shares, after accounting for a 3.5 for 1 forward stock split
and convertible preferred shares:


1. Vantage Group: 15,925,000 (if converts preferred
stock)


2. David Steinberg , Co-owner of company that merged
into shell that is now APPG: 8,575,000 free trading
shares


3. Casey Cordes, Co-owner of company that merged into
shell that is now APPG: 8,575,000 free trading shares


4. Unaccounted: 12,075,000 free trading shares


So with APPG trading around $1.40, the Vantage Group,
David Steinberg and Casey Cordes are potentially worth
$46 million by owning shares of a zero dollar revenue-
generating company. And they have had ample time to
cash in on some of their shares. APPG has traded over 11
million shares since we noticed the commencement of a
promotional campaign launched by Fly under the Radar
Stocks (“FLURS”) in early August.


The online promotional campaign website landing page
discloses that FLUR received $25,000 from an entity called
Micro Cap Media Ltd. However, it fails to disclose the full
extent of Micro Cap Media’s budget to promote APPG. But
luckily one of our GeoInvesting followers provided us with
a disclaimer from a hard mailer he received disclosing that

5/23/2018 Apptigo (APPG) – The Jig Is Up, The Same “Sexy” Pump And Dump Story With A Different App! | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 5/16


Micro Cap Media’s budget is nearly $1 million to “build
investor awareness.”


APPG, or Déjà Vu?


APPG’s self-written description goes like this:


“Apptigo is a non-conforming, highly creative
agency, corporate incubator and investment
vehicle headquartered in Miami, Florida. Apptigo
is focused on designing, developing and bringing
to market cutting edge, mobile apps that “entice
the soul,” “stimulate the mind” and “make
downloads worth downloading and experiences
worth experiencing.”


If you think this sounds like a broken record, it’s probably
because you are familiar with the events surrounding DiMi
Telematics International, Inc. which also introduced its app
business venture to investors. Lyle Hauser was one of the
three founders of the Company. On July 9, 2012 we
informed our GeoInvesting Premium members that we
were seeking to short shares of DIMI when the stock was
trading at $1.83. Shortly thereafter, our July 17, 2012
short thesis expose, “DiMi Telematics Implosion Underway”
correctly predicted shares would quickly plummet. On July
18, 2012 the stock closed at $0.04. This was one of the
quickest and most devastating pump and dump
cycles we have ever witnessed. (Please note that the
stock currently trades at $0.65 because the company
executed a 1 for 100 reverse stock split in February 2014.)

https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 6/16


There is still more to this déjà vu story. Just like APPG,
DIMI was spinning a sexy story hyping its involvement in
the mobile app space.


“Available for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad for
the price of $0.99, Green Genie is an app that
provides its users with a massive collection of
green projects and resources, making it a
comprehensive guide to sustainable living. It
provides a breakdown of certified green products
and technologies, glossary of green terms,
collection of essential reading, links to the best
green web sites and organizations, and links to
various carbon footprint calculators. Users can
also submit their own ideas, projects and
resources. As of June 1, 2012, Green Genie had
nearly 14,000 active app subscribers.”


“In addition to providing DiMi with a new high
margin revenue stream, Green Genie provides us
with a powerful marketing platform that we can
now leverage to aid our Company in achieving
our underpinning mission: to reduce the
collective carbon footprints of consumers,
commercial businesses, government agencies
and industrial enterprises on a worldwide basis,”
stated Barry Tenzer, President and CEO of DiMi.”


Subsequently, GeoInvesting stated:


“We conclude that DIMI’s recent acquisition of
the software application Green Genie is nothing
but a sideshow, which we believe is a pathetic
attempt to distract investors from the fact that
they are not generating meaningful sales from
their flagship software. A distraction maybe one
thing, but the comical statement implying that

Hauser’s Connection To Five More
Pump And Dumps


Our article on DIMI highlighted several P&Ds that Lyle
Hauser/the Vantage Group had ties to.


Motorcars Auto Group Inc


Here is a quote from our DIMI article on MAGI:


“In 2002 Tenzer and Hauser collaborated
together at Motorcars Auto Group Inc.,(MAGI)
subsequently renamed Hauser Motorcars Auto
Group Inc.), where Mr. Tenzer was the CEO and
Hauser the majority shareholder via his private
equity firm, the Vantage Group in which he is the
sole-owner. The last news item that we were
able to reference was one on September 8,
2010 that revealed the possibility of the SEC
suspending trading in Motor Auto Group,
symbol MAGI, We were not able to find a stock
quote on the symbol. Reuter’s last MAGI headline
on September 24, 2010 indicates that its symbol
had been deleted, with no subsequent symbol
change.”


We later learned that MAGI’s registration was revoked by
the SEC.


Life Exchange, Inc, ($0.0001)


Here is some intelligence about the Life settlement P&D,
LFXG, from our DIMI article:

https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 8/16


“Life Exchange, Inc.(PINK:LFXG) was another
alleged pump in which Mr. Hauser was part of,
owning 45 Million shares or 25.465% of the
Company. Here is a 13D filing showing that The
Vantage Group held the shares. The Seattle
Times reported on this P&D in a February 26,
2006 article titled “Life Exchange tries a twist on
pump-and-dump ploy” where it discusses an
“investment letter” named “Investment Trader
Trends” that attempted to dupe investors out of
their money with empty promises of “600%
returns or more.” LFXG is currently priced at
$0.001.”


More importantly, LFXG was one of 17 companies
where trading was suspended to “combat
corporate hijackings.”


SEC Suspends Trading in 17 Companies to Combat
Corporate Hijackings


“The Commission temporarily suspended trading
in the securities of the 17 companies because of
questions that have been raised about the
accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated
information concerning their status as publicly-
traded companies. Specifically, certain persons
appear to have either: 1) usurped the identity
of defunct or inactive publicly traded
corporations, initially by incorporating new
entities using the same names as each of
the defunct entities, or 2) reinstated
defunct publicly traded corporations without
authorization. (Rel. 34-60707)”


Medefile ($0.0026) and Global Roaming, registration
revoked

https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 9/16


The third and fourth P&Ds that we tied to Hauser were
Medefile International Inc. (MDFI), recipient of several
pump campaigns over the years, and Global Roaming
Distribution (GRDB)


Here are two more passages from our DIMI article:


“Lyle Hauser currently owns shares in MDFI
which appears to be a family owned Pump and
Dump that has been promoted in many
newsletters, including but not limited to this one
we highlight here. The company is currently
being run by his brother Kevin Hauser, who is
the CEO. Kevin was gifted 200 million shares in
2011 by his brother Lyle Hauser


Mr. Hauser became a shareholder of Global
Roaming Distribution (GRDB) in conjunction with
a reverse merger transaction consummated on
September 8, 2007. GRDB was highlighted in an
article called “Memorial Day pump and dump
(with emphasis on the dump)“. The article stated
that GRDB dropped 70% over a five day period
on “no news” but was pumped using “amazingly
optimistic advertisements”.


The SEC issued a trading suspension on MDFI on at least
one occasion.


After being sent to the Grey sheets in 2010, the SEC
revoked GRDB’s registration on November, 27, 2014.


Walker Financial Corp ($0.001)


After performing more due diligence on Hauser and the
Vantage Group we came across another P&D that we did
not highlight in our DIMI report, Walker Financial Corp.

(WLKF), formerly Walker international Industries. The stock
also invited a trading suspension order from the SEC in
February 2014:


“The federal securities laws allow the SEC to
suspend trading in any stock for up to ten trading
days when the SEC determines that a trading
suspension is required in the public interest and
for the protection of investors.”


Although we were unable to find any P&D material on
WLKF we found the following warnings on otcmarkets.com.


“…


OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Markets”) has
discontinued the display of quotes on
otcmarkets.com for this security because it has
been labeled Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware) for
one of the following reasons:


1. Promotion/Spam without Adequate
Current Information – The security is
being promoted to the public, but adequate
current information about the issuer has not
been made available to the public. OTC
Markets believes adequate current
information must be publicly available
during any period when a security is the
subject of ongoing promotional activities
having the effect of encouraging trading of
the issuer’s securities. At such instances, as
a matter of policy, when adequate current
information is not made available, OTC
Markets will label the security as “Caveat
Emptor.” Promotional activities may include
spam email, unsolicited faxes or news

2. Investigation of Fraud or Other Criminal
Activities – There is an investigation of
fraudulent or other criminal activity
involving the company, its securities or
insiders. When OTC Markets becomes aware
of such investigation, the companies’
securities may be subject to Caveat Emptor.


3. Suspension/Halt – A regulatory authority
or an exchange has halted or suspended
trading for public interest concerns (i.e. not
a news or earnings halt).


4. Undisclosed Corporate Actions – The
security or issuer is the subject of a
corporate action, such as a reverse merger,
stock split, or name change, without
adequate current information being publicly
available.


5. Unsolicited Quotes – The security has only
been quoted on an unsolicited basis since it
entered the public markets and the issuer
has not made adequate current information
available to the public.


6. Other Public Interest Concern – OTC
Markets has determined that there is a
public interest concern regarding the
security. Such concerns may include but are
not limited to promotion, spam or disruptive
corporate actions even when adequate
current information is available.

The Hype


Much of the current hype surrounding APPG is over its
dating app, “Score – Match Maker” (Score). It looks like
the company is attempting to ride the popularity of the
Tinder dating app that has gone viral, with over 10 million
downloads on Android. Tinder is also available in the Apple
(AAPL) store. “Score” is only available in the Apple store
and as far as we can tell has attracted an insignificant
amount of downloads and is still in beta.


“The first application developed by Apptigo is
SCORE, which was introduced to market for beta
testing in June 2014. SCORE is an interactive
dating game that allows people to determine
their compatibility through answering online
questions. Users of the application can choose to
invite anyone to play by:


1. Entering a queue that shows other active
players and sending invitations through the
queue


2. Using the interactive map that shows pins of
all the people who are available to play in a
specific geographic region; and


3. Inviting friends through email, phone
number or social media contact lists.

5/23/2018 Apptigo (APPG) – The Jig Is Up, The Same “Sexy” Pump And Dump Story With A Different App! | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/apptigo-the-jig-is-up-the-same-sexy-pump-and-dump-story-with-a-different-app/ 14/16


We do not intend to commence our marketing
campaign for SCORE until completion of the beta
testing, which we estimate will occur by
approximately September 25, 2014.” Q2 2014

Our understanding from one of our team members that
downloaded Score, the app, like Tinder, attemptsto match
people based on user distance settings, age, sex and
various questions. After the questions are answered, little
blue dots populate a map of compatible people. A major
problem we see with the app is that users can’t see
pictures of other users on the map unless they click on the
blue dots.


Tinder is quick and simple. A user chooses location, age
and sex, and moments later pictures/profiles are displayed.
Next, the user swipes left if they don’t like what they see
and right if they like what they see. A match is made when
users randomly like each other. In our opinion, the ability
to view pictures is a must for a mobile dating app.


Ultimately, we don’t think Score, an app that we deem to
be inferior to other much more established players in the
space, has even a small chance of succeeding in its
business plan based on this intense competitive
environment.


If Score wants to compete, APPG is going to have to pony
up massive amounts of dilutive capital to catch up to its
competitors that have already spent millions of dollars to
acquire members. Luckily we can compare APPG to a
publicly traded comp that is similar to Tinder called
Meetme (MEET).

people in their local communities or anywhere in
the world and Over 200 million messages are
sent per month.. We believe a dramatic shift is
underway in the multi-billion dollar dating
industry, and that the industry is anchoring
towards free with lowered pricing [bolded for
emphasis]and dramatic investments in free
services by existing players.”


So APPG, with Zero revenues plans on taking on companies
like MEET in an industry where product prices are
decreasing? This means that APPG will have to spend
enormous marketing dollars to build a massive
membership base to earn ad revenue. MeetMe has spent
$19 million just in marketing expense since 2010. Its
revenues for 2013 were $40 million compared to the
stock’s market cap of $85 million. APPG’s Q2 2014
revenues were Zero, while its fully diluted market-cap is
sitting at $63 million.


APPG aspirations are even more challenging given that it
appears Tinder just received $500 million from
Iac/interactivecorp (IACI).


“IAC is a leading media and Internet company
focused on the areas of search, applications,
online dating, media and eCommerce. Ranked
by Fortune magazine’s annual standing of the
world’s most admired companies in the Internet
Services & Retailing sector for many years, IAC’s
network of sites has over a billion total monthly
visits in more than 100 countries and is the 11th
largest network in the world. The company is
headquartered in the Chelsea neighborhood of
New York City and has business operations and
satellite offices around the world.”
