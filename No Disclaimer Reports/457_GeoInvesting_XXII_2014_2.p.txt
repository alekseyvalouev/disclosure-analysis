22nd Century Group (XXII)
– XXII’s History of Press
Releases That Haven’t
Panned Out
August 27, 2014 By GeoTeam


While doing our research, we’ve noted a lot of company press releases


that seem impressive on the surface, but that have all ultimately led to


where the company is now-poised for more dilution and continually


posting losses. When considering whether or not to lend credence to the


company’s most recent press releases, suggesting that International and


European sales could be right around the corner, we chose to check what


the company’s history of delivering on press releases was. Specifically,


the company has issued press releases dating back to 2011 touting


potential “big things” which still haven’t panned out or of which they’ve


stopped talking about without major explanation. This is a common


tactic we’ve witnessed from other pump and dump style companies.

Here’s a list of some of the more impressive sounding press releases the


company has released: May 29, 2014 – 22nd Century Group Signs Letter


of Intent with European Factory For Production of Nicotine-Free Tobacco

MAGIC distribution was expected this summer, the

The company has had de minimis sales as a result of
acquiring NASCO for the MSA agreement, again from
the last 10-Q:

a limited capacity two super-premium priced
cigarette brands, RED SUN and MAGIC , into the
U.S. market in the first quarter 2011. There have

April 10, 2012 – 22nd Century Group to File Modified Risk
Cigarette Applications with the FDA


Two years later, still listed as in process in the
company’s 10-Q:

the United States depends on obtaining FDA
authorization to market these products as
modified risk, and our ability to generate
meaningful revenue in the United States from X-

are authorized and approved by the FDA, we
must still meet the challenges of successful
marketing, distribution and consumer
acceptance. February 8, 2012 – 22nd Century
