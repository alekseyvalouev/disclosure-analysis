Pareteum  - Related party share incentive schemes 
Pareteum’s unsolicited press releases are laughable.  


July 2, 2019 – Pareteum yesterday announced that its Q2 2019 performance will exceed analysts expectations 


on Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA will beat consensus. This press release is laughable in light of Viceroy and 


Aurelius’ exploration of Pareteum’s “customers”, who are financially unable to fulfil the multi-million dollar 


contracts announced by management.  


 
Figure 1 Pareteum Announces Its Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Will Exceed Analysts' Consensus 


Pareteum can record as much revenue on paper as they like from their “customers”, however this will not 


improve the Company’s dire cash position and ballooning payables balance. Readers should note that we have 


previously identified and reported numerous instances of customers being related parties and/or not existing in 


any financial substance1. 


We challenge Pareteum to transparency through the provision end-of-quarter receivables, 


payables, and cash balances to its stakeholders. Without these, there is no way to grasp 


the quality of Pareteum’s income. 


With the data available to us, we can make an educated and empirical opinion that Pareteum will continue to 


generate limited cash revenues outside of its Vodafone contract, and revenues accruing as receivables will 


eventually collapse. 


1. More ‘fake’ customers 


In a desperate attempt at legitimacy, Pareteum introduced a “Customer Panel” in its most recent shareholder 


meeting.

1.1. Ali Davachi, Realware and Cognativ 


We focus in on Ali Davachi, Realware Founder & CEO and former employee and subcontractor of Pareteum in a 


development reminiscent of the Global Connect entities.  


Davachi’s LinkedIn profile lists him as Founder of Realware and Cognativ as well as COO/CTO at Pareteum.

At no point throughout Pareteum’s presentation does it mention Davachi’s status as a Chief Operating Officer 


and Chief Technology Officer at Pareteum simultaneous to his employment at Realware and Cognativ3.

According to the Freelancer page of former Realware LLC programmer Miodrag Radojkovic, Realware served as 


a subcontractor for Pareteum.

Davachi’s other venture, Cognativ.com Inc, appears to be non-functional at the time of writing based on its 


website and lack of web presence.

Despite his position as an employee and subcontractor, Pareteum prefer to use the following biography for 


Davachi: 


“Ali Davachi has over 25 years of hands-on experience with all facets of complex technology 


implementation at scale. He has both functional and non-functional hands on experience spanning the entire 


information architecture stack (hardware, network, virtualization, cloud and applications). His "roll your sleeves 


up" strategy informs his team execution approach.”

Possibly a “benefit” of appearing on the customer panel are the 150,000 shares only disclosed in a Pareteum 


Form S-35.

The shares issued to Davachi were also sold: not only is this further evidence the company’s stated cash figures 


is in question, but the recieveables being collected are in serious question. Pareteum are running what Viceroy 


believe is a confetti share issuance scheme, with shareholders bearing the effects of the dilution.  


Davachi was not the only beneficiary, Roth partners and Devicescape Software all sold their awarded shares. 


Figure 9 Form S3 filing dated June 19, 2019 


Pareteum’s omission of Davachi’s role is made more suspect by their full disclosure regarding the Pareteum 


directorship of Luis Jiminez Tunon, former Vodafone Spain Enabler CEO. Our research shows no indication that 


Tunon or any associated entities currently do business with Pareteum.  


2. Iran Sanctions 


2.1. Licenses do not exempt Pareteum’s transactions 


One point Pareteum did make in its response was regarding the existence of a GL-H or GL-D1 license which it 


implies makes the Iran connections made in our first report entirely legitimate. This is not the case.  


Firstly, a GL-D1 license explicitly states: 


“the general license does not authorize any transaction prohibited by any part of chapter V of 31 C.F.R. 


other than part 560” 


As a reminder, the chairman of Amin MVNO was Hamid Reza Amirinia who is also the chairman of the Center of 


Innovation and Technology Cooperation. The Center of Innovation and Technology Cooperation is sanctioned 


under two programs; the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations and the Weapons of Mass Destruction 


Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. Neither of these programs are 5606.

Secondly, GL-H was revoked on June 27, 2018 with immediate effect7. GL-H also did not authorize the actions 


described above.

2.2. Breach of disclosure requirements  


Setting aside the above, Pareteum is in breach of SEC disclosure requirements regarding their dealings in Iran. 


Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 states requires listed entities to disclose in their annual or 


quarterly reports if it or its affiliates has knowingly engaged in specified activities involving contacts with, or 


support for Iran8.  


Companies are required to file the extent and details of their dealings with certain Iranian entitles under section 


219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012. These entities are generally characterized 


as entities associated with the Iranian Government and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. 


Below is a copy of T-Mobile's disclosure in their most recent 10-Q. Section 219 requires an issuer to disclose its 


dealings with Iranian entities whether or not the activities are sanctionable under US Law. Pareteum has never 


made any such disclosure, nor filed any IRANNOTICE filings with the SEC. 


 
Figure 11 Extract from T-Mobile 10-Q 


3. Conclusion 


Viceroy reiterates its belief that the company should be independently investigated due to the issues in this and 


previous reports including but not limited to dealings with individuals on the OFAC sanctions list, backlog figures 


that make no sense, apparently uncollectable revenues and undisclosed related party customers.
