Short Idea Introduction


• Cardtronics is a case of technical obsolescence, their product being physical paper cash, 
which has been losing share to electronic payments for decades.  Recently, cash usage has 
declined according to the Federal Reserve.


• The ATM business is heavily leveraged to volumes.  We estimate a 10% revenue decline 
could impact earnings by 40%.


• Tap to Pay adoption likely results in 25% to 35% declines in ATM transactions as 
witnessed in the U.K. and Australia. Adoption curves show Tap to Pay cannibalizes cash 
and will typically be 50% of in person transactions within 5 years.


• All 5 of the largest U.S. mass transit systems are adopting Tap to Pay within the next 12 to 
18 months.  International examples show that Tap to Pay  adoption rapidly accelerates in 
areas with mass transit adoption.

For hundreds of years, check volumes grew despite the introduction of credit cards, the internet, eCommerce, and the dot 
com boom. As we entered the new millennium, it seemed the check was unstoppable.  However, year 2000 proved to be 
the tipping point as checks not only lost share, but went into absolute decline.

Consumers are making a rational choice to move away from cash:


• Faster checkout experience and no cumbersome coins


• Cards often offer cashback, points, or rewards


• Transactions can be disputed if not properly delivered


• Safer: A lost card can be deactivated, cash is gone


• Cards offer ability to revolve balance


• Cards can execute transactions much larger than would be practical with cash


• Government programs moving to card-based systems


Cash Is The New Check

CATM management points investors to ‘Total Cash in Circulation’ even though 
CATM is not paid on cash outstanding.  We believe CATM is more closely tied 
to ‘Transactional Cash’.


We have done a deep dive into Federal Reserve data to analyze ‘Transactional 
Cash’ using the definition provided by the Federal Reserve – Transactional 
Cash includes: $1, $5, $10, and $20s.

• Transactional cash “velocity” is slowing as shown by the Fed’s unusually low 2019 print order. 
Bills are lasting longer, and banks sit with high inventory.


“During FY 2018, Reserve Banks destroyed fewer notes than we estimated when we prepared the FY 2018 
order.  As a result, Reserve Banks will end the year with larger inventories.”


• Cash outstanding (specifically $100s, which CATM does not dispense) can be growing while 
transactional cash can be declining. The number of outstanding U.S. $100 bills has doubled 
since the financial crisis and accounted for the vast majority of the growth in cash in 
circulation.

The Federal Reserve’s Most Recent Data Showed ATM Transactions Declined 2.8% In 2017.


These trends tend not to reverse:
UK reported its first decline in ATM activity in 2016.  Every year has been negative since.


Australia never reported negative ATM activity until 2008.  Every year has been negative 
since.

guests to easily pay.”  - Darren Rebelez, President of IHOP, Dine Brands 4Q18 earnings call.


 ‘So, we’re seeing credit card charges continue to be a bit higher than what we typically run. Some of that is due to 
credit card transactions, more of those transactions being plastic versus cash, so that’s one thing we saw this 
quarter.” – 2Q18 earnings call, Tonya Robinson, Texas Roadhouse CFO.

Cardtronics Specific
Are Challenges Behind?


The company has had to deal with:


1. Tap to Pay adoption in the U.K. and Australia


2. Australian banks eliminating ATM surcharge fees while CATM is all 
surcharge (i.e. competition went to free)


3. Interchange fees reduced in the U.K.


4. Loss of largest partner: 7-Eleven, who is now part of the MoneyPass
surcharge free network.


The company has maintained pro forma profitability, but we 
believe new challenges are ahead.

Merchant Owned Ending # of Transacting ATMs:
2018 Metrics Had One-Time Benefits


1. 7-Eleven volume recapture:  When 7-Eleven went off CATM’s free Allpoint
network, the company believed some of the volume was recaptured.  So, while 
the 7-Eleven loss was ‘pro forma’d’ out of organic growth, the recapture benefit 
remained as an organic benefit.  See below.


2. CATM likely eliminated its lowest performing machines.  Thus, the reported “SSS” 
number only shows the performance of their best performing machines.  Even 
post the 7-Eleven machine removals, ATMs are declining at a 7% annualized rate.


3. 2017 EMV upgrades led to high “downtimes” in 2017 so 2018 “uptimes” were 
bound to improve and the company currently claims “record” levels of “uptimes.”


30


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL
of San Francisco, L.L.C.30


“We estimate that the year ended December 31, 2018 was also positively impacted by transactions which 
migrated back to our network following the removal of Allpoint from 7-Eleven stores on July 1st, 2017.  
Finally, we believe the growth rate during the year ended December 31st, 2018 was positively impacted by 
higher ATM availability relative to the prior year as a result of the software upgrades and outages in 2017 
that negatively impacted transaction volumes during the first part of that year.”  - CATM 2018 10K
Tailwinds Becoming Headwinds


CATM annualized 7-Eleven volume recapture in 1Q19


Machines will be comparing against the ‘record uptimes’ reported in 2018 and 
thus difficult to show further improvement


Machines will incur downtime for Windows 10 upgrades


Machine fleet has been rationalized, but the company now has fewer machines 
deployed


31


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL
of San Francisco, L.L.C.31
New competition: MoneyPass boasts 32,000 surcharge-free ATMs versus the 55,000 at 
Allpoint.  MoneyPass partners include: 7-Eleven, Fifth Third, US Bancorp, Zions, East West 
Bank, Mechanics Bank, Provident Credit Union, etc.


Customers likely to change their behavior to avoid surcharge fees.  In the UK, CATM added 
surcharges to 4,000 machines in 1Q19 and we believe this could negatively impact 
volumes. 


In Australia, 77% of CATM revenues are from surcharge while all major banks offer free 
ATM transactions to not only their own customers, but customers of their competitors, 
essentially creating a free to use utility. We believe consumers will continue to rationally 
take advantage of free ATMs.


Post the 7-Eleven loss, North America ATM count (CATM owned) has declined at a 7.4% 
annualized rate. For all of 2018,  ATMs in Europe declined 9.1% and Australia ATMs 
declined 8.7%. Because of seasonality, it is more difficult to measure trends in the number 
of ATM transactions post 7-Eleven, however if trends were strong or even stable, we do not 
believe CATM would be removing ATMs.

Tailwinds Becoming Headwinds
Questionable ‘Organic Growth’
CATM Has Inconsistencies In Its Definition Of ‘Organic Growth’


Organic growth excludes price cuts due to LINK price changes


Includes price increase via added surcharge to offset the LINK price reductions


Excludes all geographies with negative same store sales


Excludes machine removals


Despite all these inconsistencies, claimed revenue growth is still roughly in line with inflation


33


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL
of San Francisco, L.L.C.33
Economically Impaired Assets Weigh On The Balance Sheet


The company has 4,000 ATMs out of operation, yet has not impaired the value of these 
assets.  With continued declining ATM counts, we think it is unlikely that these ATMs will be 
put back into service. 


We estimate these assets have a carrying value of $10M to $20M. The impact of a write off 
would be noncash, but we question why the company  sits on so many  unused machines.

Refuting The Bull Case: Allpoint


CATM highlights the value of their surcharge free Allpoint network, particularly 
highlighting the growth in Allpoint transactions.  However, minimal financial 
information is provided.


• Despite highlighting ‘almost 10%’ growth in surcharge free transactions (Allpoint) in 1Q19, total 
domestic revenue growth was negative 2% in 1Q19.


• It is generally believed that Allpoint transactions are at a significantly lower price point than non-
Allpoint transactions.  Thus, Allpoint volume may be cannibalizing higher priced surcharge 
transactions.


• Allpoint either charges a fixed monthly fee per cardholder or a fixed fee per transaction, but the 
mix between the two is not disclosed.  The fixed monthly pricing mechanism is listed first, making 
us suspect that is more common. Thus, revenue is not necessarily correlated with transactions. 


• At the end of 1Q19, 20,000 ATMs were branded with 500 institutions offering surcharge-free 
transactions, unchanged from 2017.  Revenue from bank branding & surcharge free network 
revenue only increased 3% in 1Q19 (negative 6% for all of 2018).

Refuting The Bull Case: Outsourcing
One positive argument is that as cash demands decline, banks are more likely to outsource to specialists like CATM.


We disagree:


• In Australia, ATM transactions are 35% below their peak, but CATM’s Australian managed services business is 
contracting, not growing. Australian Managed services revenue declined 35% in 1Q19.  It seems a shrinking 
market is bad for all.


• In the UK, ATM transactions are 25% below their peak, but CATM does not even offer managed services in this 
market.


• In the US, where Federal Reserve data shows transactions just starting to decline, managed services revenue 
was down 2% in 1Q19.


• Managed services revenue today is less than 5% of total revenue.  It does not appear material enough to us to 
change the overall  growth.


• Many ATMs are already outsourcing cash needs with Brink’s and servicing with NCR or Diebold.  Further 
outsourcing to CATM may not represent material savings.


• “We would never outsource our ATMs, that would be too much of a compliance risk.” – Bank of America 
Executive

Refuting The Bull Case: Expanded Service


CATM is testing new ATM machines that accept check deposits. Most banks offer 
mobile check deposit. We see little demand for these services and even less consumer 
willingness to pay when there are so many more convenient and free alternatives.


Mobile: Testing ability to get ATM cash using a smart phone rather than a debit card.  
In other words, this will do for the ATM what calling cards did for pay phones.  Like the 
calling card, we don’t see this saving the ATM.


Wells Fargo sells stamps at some ATMs, but demand is limited. We believe this shows 
limited consumer interest in expanded ATM services.

Refuting The Bull Case: International Expansion


CATM is citing growth opportunities in Germany, Spain, and South Africa:


• Card payments in Germany surpassed cash payments for the first time in 
2018.
A survey by EHI Retail Institute showed that last year, card payments made 


up 48.6 percent of all retail sales, while cash payments made up 48.3 
percent (source: pymnts.com).


• Cash in Spain is still the preferred in person payment. But, the ATM industry is 
mature and in slight decline. ATM usage in Spain peaked in 2008 and has 
generally declined since (latest data 4% below peak), according to a CATM 
industry report.

Refuting Bull Case: Government Regulations

For every positive, we see at least one negative


• Several cities (Philadelphia, San Francisco, etc.) have banned 
stores from not accepting cash. Some bulls point to these bans 
as bullish for continued cash usage. We see it as a sign of 
dwindling demand for cash.


• California has proposed a bill requiring e-receipts rather 
than paper. We believe if this is passed, it forces all businesses 
to accept electronic payments.


• Several states are proposing digital IDs. If enacted, consumers 
will have one less reason to carry a physical wallet.
