Mallinckrodt's Distribution Partner throws Acthar Under the Bus  








June 5, 2017 


Citron provides New PROOF (post-SALT Conference)  
why Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) is on its way to ZERO.   





Express Scripts lets the genie out the bottle!!!! 


When Jim Chanos Speaks - Citron Listens. 


First Enron, Then Valeant, Now Mallinckrodt. 





Mallinckrodt is the most reviled company in the pharmaceutical 


industry.  Its unsavory business practices have only survived 
in the “post Valeant” era because of the direct business 
support of Express Scripts, their “co-conspirator”.  


Two weeks ago at the SALT conference in Las Vegas, legendary short 
seller Jim Chanos described this unholy alliance, likening the Express 
Scripts companies' role to Valeant’s Philidor. 


While Express Scripts was supposed to protect the healthcare system 
from gouges like Acthar, they were actually distributing the drug 
through their CuraScript division, managing the hub that is tasked with 
getting approvals for the drug through their United BioSource 
division,  and then making very healthy profits dispensing the drug

through their specialty pharmacy Accredo.  


Acthar's dependence on Express Scripts has been detailed for many 
years in the press:

Most recently, this alliance re-appears as Express Scripts has been 
added as a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by the City of Rockford, Il., 
which accuses Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts of monopolistic 
practices and price gouging. The city accused the two of conspiring to 
charge over $54,000 a vial for the drug.

Express Scripts has been kicked to the curb by their former largest 
customer, Anthem Healthcare.  Worse, it is now being investigated by 
multiple Attorneys General for representing both the pharmaceutical 
companies and the insurance companies.   


In the case of Acthar, while they were supposed to be protecting 
insurers from system abusers, they were actively obtaining 
authorizations and selling it thought their own "specialty" pharmacies. 


Those days are done.  This Genie cannot be put back in the 
bottle. 


Express Scripts Has FINALLY changed its stance on Acthar 
and the effect will send shares of Mallinckrodt to ZERO. 


In an investor conference call for Express Scripts hosted by Citi last 
week, as a reaction to Mr. Chanos comments at the SALT Conference, 
Express Scripts was forced by analysts to explain their position on HP 
Achtar Gel.

All insurance companies and Medicare take notice; these are the words 
of Express Scripts management, the lifeline of the Acthar cash machine. 
No more editorializing.   
 
Let's turn it over to Everett Neville, Senior Vice President, Supply Chain 
and Specialty Pharma:   











Then there are the words of Dr. Steve Miller, Chief Medical Officer,  
Express Scripts:  





 “If you look at the data, the indications for the drug are really – 
while it had, in the compendium, it’s listed under a lot of indications, 
its real use should be very, very limited. ITS AN OLD DRUG .  
THERE”S BETTER PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE and so we’re 
going to continue to be very vigilant in our utilization management.” 
 


--  Dr. Steve Miller, SVP Supply Chain and Specialty Pharma  


 “I personally told their management team their drug is hugely 
overpriced. I know Steve has as well “ 
 


--  Everett Neville, SVP Supply Chain and Specialty Pharma  


 ““Completely, you know, and Steve, you could chime in here too, but 
I think Steve and I both would agree, and I think everybody in our 
company would agree, that the product is vastly overpriced for the 
value...” 
 


--  Everett Neville, SVP Supply Chain and Specialty Pharma  


 “I don’t think it’s a very great – it’s a pretty poor drug with a very 
limited need and certainly Steve could comment…. “ 
 


--  Everett Neville, SVP Supply Chain and Specialty Pharma

Citron notes this comment stands in sharp contradiction to Daniel 
Yunger, a Mallinckrodt spokesman who told the NY Times 6 months ago, 
"Acthar is not a drug with no immediate competition."    
 https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/business/drug-price-medicare-mallinckrodt-acthar.html?_r=0 


In the same call Dr. Miller discusses a more responsible and efficient 
future for Express Scripts: 





So Express Scripts finally admits in a public forum that the drug is 
overprescribed with low efficacy and it is far too expensive.   


The status quo cannot continue.  There is nothing the analyst 
community can say or do to defend against these statements. 


So Why Didn't the Market React?  
 


Incredibly, the transcript for this damning conference call misspelled 
Acthar ["Aksar"]  So the bots, website crawlers indexers, and the AI text 
analyzers hooked up to algo trading computers never picked it up.    
That is why you have Citron.   





 “Yes. So as you know, we have already told people that we are going 
after the multiple sclerosis market this next year….. Lots of things, 
lots of new entrants, but also drugs going generic and other things. 
We believe this is the perfect time in which we can start reining in 
this class that’s been a real expense driver for our plan sponsors. .”

How this will Play Out 


Express Scripts is the cash lifeline of Mallinckrodt's Acthar franchise.  
They will not be able to maintain both pricing at volumes at their 
current level.    


Mallinckrodt could never replace Express Scripts, because no other PBM 
would ever tolerate the bad publicity and negative effect on stock price 
attached to being custodian of the most infamous drug in pharma.    


Citron understands that Acthar is not going to disappear overnight, but 
in a simple model we see that if Acthar revenue, whether through unit 
volume, pricing or both declines 50%, Mallinckrodt trips all debt 
covenants and goes bankrupt.   


Now a 50% loss in Acthar's contribution to the bottom line is hardly 
unthinkable.  Acthar was generating $500 million in sales just 5 years 
ago.  At the time, that numbers was considered outrageous.  Longtime 
Acthar observers will remember the N.Y. Times article in 2012 
criticizing the drug and its outrageous pricing.  At the time it was doing 
$500 mil.

Here is a simple financial model:

Prisoner's Dilemma 


Mr. Chanos calling out both Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts put the 
two companies in a classic game theory double-bind known as the 
Prisoner’s Dilemma.  Express Scripts decided to “be the rat” and the 
result will be billions of dollars saved for the US Healthcare system and 
the destruction of the equity of Mallinckrodt. 


Investors must remember that 10 years ago Acthar was priced at $2,000 
per vial and 15 years ago it was $40 a vial.  Now it is over $40,000 per 


vial and their distribution partner now admits it is a “poor drug” that 
is overprescribed.   


Time for Express Scripts to Back To Work  


With a renewed focus on saving their real clients money and assembling 
formularies that represent 2017 medicine and pricing, Express Scripts 
should make MNK the first bankruptcy in the “post Valenat” days.    


What Does Mallinckrodt have to throw Overboard 
in order to Save this Doomed Acthar franchise??   


MNK has recently announced plans to sell their generics unit.  Their 
generics unit is beyond controversial because of its sales of opiate based 
painkillers, which have fallen out of favor with doctors, due to the 
epidemic of addiction to this class of drugs, and the legal system 
blowback.   


https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/?utm_term=.bf7c6b55a072 


We give credit to CFO Matthew Harbaugh for being honest with  
investors, in disclosing the headwinds for Mallinckrodt's generic 
business: 
 





 “We expect continued pressure on the segment from competitive 
entrants and market pricing in coming quarters,"  
 


--  Mallinckrodt CFO Matthew Harbaugh

Selling the generics business at any price is just putting a finger in the 
dam.  It will only increase Mallinckrodt's dependency on Acthar for its 
entire bottom line.  Lets us not forget, if MNK receives anything less 
than $2 billion for the generics, the leverage actually INCREASES 
because of the loss of EBIDTA.   
 


Nothing can make up for the extreme leverage taken on by Mallinckrodt 
when it acquired Questcor for debt at the top of the pharma buyout 
feeding frenzy.    
 


Mallinckrodt:   Pharma's Most Wanted 
 


All the signs of a pharmaceutical 
company going rogue perpetuated 
when Mallinckrodt resigned from the 
Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers Association.   
 


This happened because of potential 
changes to the trade group's bylaws 
that could exclude companies that 
don't spend significant funds on 
researching and developing new 
drugs.

  Conclusion 
 
Express Scripts will continue to earn the vast majority of its profits as a 
pharmacy-benefit manager.   The losses due to curbing Acthar's 
excesses are just a minor flesh wound to them.  But the loss of Express 
Scripts enabling market access is a fatal blow to Mallinckrodt.  The 
words of Express Scripts management will echo through the halls of 
Medicare and insurance companies as Acthar has finally met the truth:  
it is old drug that is way too expensive and not as good as its 
competition.

While continued prescribing of Acthar will be limited to the narrow 
niche of infantile spasms diagnosis, whether at a reasonable or inflated 
cost, the equity of Mallinckrodt will go to 0, as correctly predicted by the 
same short seller who warned on us on Enron and Valeant…… 


Kudos to Mr. Chanos.

Supplemental Information 
 
According to the Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard for 2015, Acthar 
was the single most expensive drug, per patient, that the 
government paid for during the course of last year.  
 
Of the 3,100 beneficiaries using Acthar, Medicare spent an average of 
$162,371 on each one.

The biggest problem is not new expensive drugs but re-pricing old ones, 
and not just ones being purchased by Martin Shkreli or Valeant. "You 
have no new research. You have no innovation. You have nothing 
but increased drug prices," says Steve Miller, chief medical officer at 
Express Scripts.

Congress has had its eyes on ending the Acthar 
scheme for years 


As stewards of taxpayers money, Congress needs to expose why CMS 
continues to pay for this drug when "Acthar reimbursements have 
been severely restricted by most large pharmaceutical companies and 
Tricare has discontinued reimbursement for this drug."
