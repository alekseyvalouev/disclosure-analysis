SFX Entertainment: Playing House Music In A House Of Cards

Summary


CEO Robert Sillerman has so far reneged on his promise to purchase shares.


We examined why and found a company that's misrepresenting itself.


The company has an over-levered balance sheet and heavy cash burn, and we
believe the equity is worthless.


While SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE) proclaims itself to be a leader in EDM and
house music festivals, we believe that SFXE is actually a house of cards headed towards
imminent collapse. Despite owning a portfolio of popular EDM concerts, SFXE is over-
levered, unprofitable, and burning through its cash reserves at an alarming rate. All an
investor needs to do is connect the dots, focusing on the CEO's actions, the recent debt
offering, and absence of 8-K exhibit filings. Investors do not want to be caught holding
SFXE shares when the bass drops.


What happened to Robert Sillerman's 10b5-1 plan?


On June 11, 2014, SFXE announced that Chairman and CEO Robert Sillerman had
instructed his advisors to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 stock purchase plan to purchase up to
2 million shares of SFXE. The release states, "Robert F.X. Sillerman, Chairman and CEO
of SFX Entertainment, Inc., today announced that he instructed his advisors to file a stock
purchase plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 promptly following the Company's release of its
second quarter financial results in August 2014. Mr. Sillerman's plan will have a term of
one year and provide for the purchase of a maximum of 2 million shares of SFX
Entertainment."


SFXE shares closed the day at $6.96.


On the August 14, 2014 second quarter 2014 earnings call, Robert Sillerman confirmed
the Rule 10b5-1 plan and stated that he thought SFXE shares provided compelling value.
In his opening remarks, he said, "I announced a 10b5 program, which will have a term of
one year, where I will acquire or seek to acquire up to 2 million additional shares. There's
no greater expression of my confidence in the platform, the people who are achieving this
and most importantly the loyalty and affection of our fans; they are here to stay."

Later in the Q&A section, he added, "I am very comfortable with the QMA position, and I'm
demonstrating that by a 10b5 that is put in place, and details of which will be forthcoming."


On the strength of Robert Sillerman's comments, shares of SFXE closed at $6.75, up 4%
on the day.


Despite two announcements of entering into a 10b5-1 trading plan, Robert Sillerman has
not purchased a single share of SFXE stock. Any share purchases by executives, even
those executed under a 10b5-1 plan, are required to be filed in a Form 4 within two
business days. These requirements are clearly outlined by the SEC in this document. As
seen here, purchases by executives under a Rule 10b5-1 plan are not exempt and must
be filed in a Form 4. SFXE has not filed a single Form 4 outlining any purchases of stock
by Robert Sillerman.


We do not know if the CEO has canceled the plan, but we do know that no insiders have
purchased a single share of SFXE in the open market. The share price has fallen by over
33% since the second quarter earnings announcement, which is when the 10b5-1 plan
was put in place. The CEO's 2 million shares would have cost him $13.5 million after the
second quarter conference call. They would now only cost him $9 million.


If SFXE shares were so compelling at $6.75, why hasn't Sillerman purchased any shares
as they've fallen to $4.49? The shares must look like a veritable bargain now. Assuming
Sillerman hasn't bought any shares, a good assumption given the obligation that he would
have to file a Form 4, he has saved himself at least $4.5 million. We believe Sillerman has
not purchased any shares because he doesn't want to throw his money away.


SFXE raised debt because it's burning so much cash


On September 24, 2014, SFXE raised $85 million of second lien senior secured notes due
in 2019. Total debt now stands at $305 million, all due in 2019.

On September 18, 2014, Moody's rated the notes Caa1. This rating is several notches
below investment grade, meaning that Moody's believes that the notes carry significant
default risk. Moody's defines corporate bonds rated Caa as "to be of poor standing and
are subject to very high credit risk," as seen here.


Historically from 1920 to 2007, corporate bonds rated in SFXE's range had a cumulative
default rate of 42.9% over a five-year period, as seen on page 24 of this Moody's report.
That means that approximately two in every five of these lowly rated companies default
during a similar five-year period as these bonds default. This compares to a 1.7%
cumulative default rate for Investment Grade bonds and 16.7% for Speculative Grade
bonds. Based solely on SFXE's rating, it's nearly a coin flip as to whether or not the
company defaults.


But the chances of default look much higher when SFXE's financials are analyzed. SFXE
burned through $48 million of cash in the second quarter alone, and finished with $59
million of cash and $162 million of net debt. This is significant financial deterioration from
the end of the first quarter 2014 when SFXE had $106 million of cash and $124 million of
net debt.


These EDM festivals, despite being popular, aren't nearly profitable enough to finance
SFXE's operations much less service its debt or fund its acquisition spree. In the first half
of 2014, SFXE reported an operating loss of $79 million and a net loss of $107 million.
EBITDA in 1H 2014 was negative $32 million, which is a loose proxy for cash flow. Even
on an adjusted EBITDA basis, which is the most favorable way for SFXE to report its
financials, it lost $22 million in the first half of 2014.

Without its recent capital raise, if SFXE had continued its current cash burn rate, it would
be out of cash by the end of the year. We believe this is why SFXE rushed to raise
additional debt despite having to increase the consent fee by 400% from $2.50 per $1,000
to $10.00 per $1,000 principal amount. It is also most likely why Robert Sillerman has
refused to purchase any SFXE shares.


While Sillerman has not purchased any stock, we do acknowledge that Robert Sillerman
did purchase $10.0 million of the 2019 notes in a private placement on September 18,
2014. Presented with the choice of equity or debt, Robert Sillerman chose to invest in the
debt of SFXE, which is structurally senior, rather than to purchase equity and align himself
with suffering shareholders. We believe this is a clear signal of his views regarding SFXE's
equity valueâ€¦


Additional red flags and who is the CFO?


There are additional red flags that we have observed with SFXE. First, despite claiming
that SFXE has signed $50 million to $60 million in Qualified Marketing Agreements
(QMAs), SFXE has not filed any of these agreements as exhibits to its financial reports.
The SEC requires "material definitive agreements" to be filed as an 8-K and included as
an exhibit in the next registration statement (SEC Disclosure Requirements).


These QMAs are supposedly significant for SFXE and the company claims they will
contribute meaningfully to profits and cash flows. We question how material they actually
are when the company refuses to file these agreements as exhibits. Either the
agreements are material and the company violated securities laws or the agreements are
immaterial and the company misled investors. Frankly, both possibilities should trouble
investors.


Lastly, we ask, "Who is in charge of these loose financial controls?" We'll note that the
CFO Richard Rosenstein (bio here) doesn't have a CPA or CFA and has no prior training
as a CFO in any capacity, at either a private or public company. He does, however, have
