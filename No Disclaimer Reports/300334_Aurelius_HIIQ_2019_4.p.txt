and bonds of Health Insurance Innovations. They therefore stand to
realize signi�cant gains in the event that the prices of either equity or
debt securities of Health Insurance Innovations decline.  Aurelius
and the Aurelius A�liates intend to continue transactions in the
securities of Health Insurance Innovations for an inde�nite period
after his �rst report on a subject company at any time hereafter
regardless of initial position and the views stated in Aurelius’
research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information on this
website to re�ect such positions or changes in such positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.


We are short Health Insurance Innovations (NASDAQ: HIIQ).


We believe HIIQ management has made a series of misleading
statements that conceal thousands of customer complaints that
have not been disclosed to investors.


Documents recently �led by the FTC reveal that HIIQ received more
than �ve thousand complaints from customers being defrauded by
boiler rooms run by Steve Dorfman. The tables below show that HIIQ
received 1,976 complaints in 2016, 2,335 complaints in 2017, and
1,025 complaints in 2018 (before Dorfman was shut down by the
government). These were described as “escalations” by HIIQ and the
customers frequently complained that agents had misrepresented
HIIQ products:

We would not be surprised if HIIQ has received tens of thousands of
customer complaints in aggregate, that management has not
disclosed to investors, because we believe Dorfman is only one
player inside a vast ecosystem of unscrupulous actors selling HIIQ
policies. We also �nd it likely that the total number of victims is far
higher because most people don’t realize they’ve been scammed
until they get sick and learn that the policy they purchased doesn’t
cover what they were told it does.


Yet HIIQ management has consistently made statements to
investors suggesting that HIIQ has received virtually no customer
complaints and has “market leading customer satisfaction”. For
example, on a November 2017 conference call, CEO Gavin Southwell
declared that “HIIQ-speci�c complaints were effectively 0.00% of
policies in force” during the quarter. In August 2018, Southwell again
referenced “an absolutely tiny, tiny number of complaints” and stated
that “people who are attacking this, they’re not attacking it based on
any data or facts”. In October 2018, Southwell again touted that “we
can show them [regulators] a very happy customer base, we can show
them a very low number of complaints”.

By adding quali�ers when referring to complaint data such as “HIIQ-
speci�c” or “Department of Insurance”, management may claim that
its statements are technically true. But we �nd them highly
misleading because they have failed to mention the thousands of
complaints which have indisputably poured in from customers who
say agents lied to them.


Investors and Sell Side analysts have relied on management’s
representations to promote the (�ctitious) narrative that virtually no
HIIQ customers complain. For example, after the closed-door
December 2018 analyst day, one analyst touted the “stunningly
limited number of complaints”.   The analyst stated that a table
provided by management showing only 25 customer complaints (via
the Department of Insurance) “was the most powerful chart of the
day” and “should help silence the Twitter-based critics”. We note that
CEO Southwell and CFO Hershberger collectively sold more than four
million dollars worth of stock in early February 2019 personally, just
over a month after the analyst day (here, here).

While management has consistently touted the company’s
compliance program, internal HIIQ emails contained in the FTC �ling
demonstrate that HIIQ management was aware that Dorfman’s boiler
rooms were misleading unsuspecting families throughout 2017. In a
2017 email, HIIQ’s Agency Compliance manager wrote “this appears
to be a widespread issue”, “we still have inaccurate information
being presented along with agents speaking to subjects they have no
visibility on”. Another HIIQ supervisor wrote “Dee stated that the
incorrect information being given by Simple Health to members is
getting out of control”.

We believe HIIQ management is misleading investors about the true
nature of its business. We continue to believe it is now only a matter
of when, not if, HIIQ’s business will implode. We therefore see
enormous downside potential.
