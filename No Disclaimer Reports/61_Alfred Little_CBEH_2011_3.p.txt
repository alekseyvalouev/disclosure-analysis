China Integrated Energy: Investigators and KPMG Begin Sorting
Through Evidence
Apr. 5, 2011 4:16 AM ET199 comments
by: Alfred Little


Charles J. Landy, of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, contacted me to announce that
he has been engaged as counsel to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of
China Integrated Energy (NASDAQ: CBEH) to investigate my allegations. He stated the
he appreciates my offer to help find the truth and asked that I send him copies of all of the
evidence against CBEH. I referred him first and foremost to the key video evidence
(viewable here) proving CBEH has not produced any meaningful quantity of biodiesel in
the last four months, despite management’s repeated public claims that their plants are
running at 100% of capacity. I plan to spend the next several days walking Mr. Landy
through the documentary evidence, all of which is available by clicking the hyperlinks in
my updated report available (here).


Pillsbury’s investigation appears to be progressing very quickly. I believe Pillsbury can
conclude by next week that the videos and Chinese audit report together conclusively
show there has been no meaningful production and sales of biodiesel proving
management fabricated of $22 million of gross profit from biodiesel sales in 2010 as well
as grossly exaggerated wholesale and retail division profits. CBEH’s historical financials
clearly can no longer be relied upon.


The March 10  Investor Tour video also conclusively shows management staging phony
production at the Tongchuan plant to deceive investors (also viewable at the same link
above). Once Pillsbury confirms the truth of the videos the Independent Board Members
will have to take swift action to terminate Chairman Gao and his management team as the
first step toward preserving shareholder value. Then the Independent Board Members will
have to find new honest management to sort out what remains of CBEH and determine
whether or not there is any viable future for the company.


KPMG Audit and Q1 Preview


International Financial Research & Analysis Group ("IFRA") investigators handed over all
their documented evidence late last week to KPMG, CBEH’s independent auditor. I
encourage institutional investors and analysts to contact KPMG audit manager Ryan Guo

in the Beijing office (main line: +86 10 8508-5000) to share their concerns. Ryan’s
assistant is Pingping Cen (direct line: +86 10 8508-5517, email:
pingping.cen@kpmg.com).


Given the video evidence clearly shows no material production of biodiesel in the first
quarter of 2010, I expect CBEH will be forced to report a loss on it biodiesel operations for
the quarter just ended. The loss could be large if CBEH is forced by KPMG to write down
biodiesel asset values and goodwill attributable to its Chongqing Tianrun biodiesel
acquisition.


More importantly, since KPMG is now aware that CBEH’s historical biodiesel production
was likely all a hoax, it is only a matter of time before KPMG pulls its 2010 audit opinion
resulting in the delisting of CBEH. The former auditor, Sherb & Co., LLP, should likewise
pull its 2008 and 2009 audit opinions. I don’t expect CBEH to trade on NASDAQ much
longer.


More Videos Uploaded


I have now uploaded a total of 64 days of Tongchuan and Chongqing surveillance video to
Vimeo (viewable here). The videos span February 10  to March 24 . In addition to
proving CBEH has no meaningful biodiesel production activity, the highlights of the videos
include:


Tongchuan 3/10/11 – Management hosts a group of 20 Rodman & Renshaw investors
on a tour of the idle Tongchuan plant. During the tour management staged production
activity including the fake filling of five biodiesel tanker trucks from the factory’s storage
tanks. During four months prior to the tour, investigators saw only one other tanker
truck (see below). The Tongchuan plant requires at least 18 large tanker trucks per day
to enable it to run at 100% of capacity as management claims.
Tongchuan 3/24/11 - A sea container load of heavy equipment is delivered to the new
50,000 ton production line. Management previously announced in a January 31, 2011
press release (here) the completion of construction of the new production line stating
that “the facility is expected to be operating at 25% - 30% capacity in the first quarter of
2011”. This is impossible since equipment was still being delivered as recently as
March 24  and the surveillance videos show no meaningful production of biodiesel
throughout the first quarter.
Tongchuan 2/21/11 – CFO Albert Pu hosted a plant tour for Jason Xu of Quantum
Asset Partners. Jason contacted me explaining that he was very unhappy at the lack
of production activity he witnessed. After viewing the IFRA surveillance videos he told

me he is “certain now that CBEH has been faking biodiesel production for a long time”.
Other investors have come forward and shared similar stories. One investor who was
allowed to film a video inside the plant in November 2010 expressed to me his concern
that the operation was a hoax.
Tongchuan 3/2/11 – The first large biodiesel tanker truck the investigators witnessed in
four months entered the Tongchuan factory.
Tongchuan 3/7/11 – The lights are on at night for the first time in four months.
Tongchuan 3/12/11 – After five nights of lights (centered around the March 10
Investor Tour), the factory returns to darkness.
Chongqing 3/9/11 – A large truck containing what may be waste oil barrels entered the
factory. This was the first evidence of any possible production activity in two months of
surveillance.


2010 Surveillance Records


IFRA has agreed to let me release surveillance records (pictures and comments) from its
field agents stationed outside the Tongchuan plant in November and December 2010. I
am formatting the pictures for upload to Vimeo this week. Like the surveillance videos from
2011, these records show no production activity at the Tongchuan plant. The only activity
was the ongoing construction and equipment deliveries to the new 50,000-ton Tongchuan
production line.


Cash Per Share Confusion: $2.29, $1.47 or $0.28?


I noted many investors expressing assurance that CBEH is a “safe” investment at these
low levels due to Yahoo Finance and other sites reporting the company has $2.29 cash
per share. But free sites like Yahoo routinely miscalculate cash per share, ignoring
restricted cash, earmarks and dilution from new funds raised.


As I show in my updated report (here), according to CBEH’s own management
shareholder letter dated 3/23/11 (here or here) the unrestricted cash balance at 12/31/10
was $30.3 million after management deducted working capital and prepayments from
customers. I add to this the total net proceeds of $36.73 million CBEH received from
Rodman & Renshaw investors in January to get $67.03 million. Dividing $67.03 million by
45.65 million fully diluted shares outstanding (following the financing) results in $1.47 cash
per share as of the first week of January.


However, CBEH is aggressively spending its cash on highly questionable acquisitions,
including the previously announced $46 million Hainan Lin Gao biodiesel project as well
as the $8.2 million pending payment for the acquisition of the Chongqing FengDou
