EPO Filing is Devastating for Universal Display.


Posted on September 12, 2013 by asensio.com


Thursday, September 12, 2013.     A recent filing at the European


Patent Office (“EPO”) shows that the most important claims of


Universal Display Corporation’s (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) “key


PHOLED technology patents” should be entirely revoked. This could


happen quickly and with finality, after an EPO Board of Appeal


hearing scheduled for this November. Equally important, the filing


sheds light on UDC’s constantly changing stories about its


contractual relationship with Samsung.


European Patent No. 1449238 (“EP-238”) is described by UDC as one


of its key patents and has been the subject of opposition


proceedings at the EPO since 2007. Merck, Sumitomo Chemical, and


BASF have all been seeking to have EP-238 revoked in its entirety. In


the first round of EP-238 opposition proceedings before the EPO’s


Opposition Division, several of the patent’s original claims were


invalidated.


Each of Merck, Sumitomo Chemical, and BASF filed an appeal to


revoke EP-238 in its entirety. The EPO Boards of Appeal will issue a


ruling following its November hearing. Any invalidation or


revocation of EP-238’s surviving claims will have final effect


throughout all of Europe, and could have a material impact on


UDC’s OLED materials sales and licensing revenue, in our view.


On August 16th, Lowe Hauptman & Ham LLP, a leading patent and


intellectual property law firm, submitted a formal Third Party


Observations filing (the “Lowe Hauptman filing”) to the EPO in


response to the Board’s Summons, which contains an annex with


discussion from the Board. According to EPO procedures, the Board


of Appeal has to consider the Lowe Hauptman filing, and we believe


the filing makes it clear that complete revocation of EP-238 is


required as a matter of law and fact.

The authors of the Lowe Hauptman filing provided the EPO with a


nine-page summary, which can be read here. The full 57-page Lowe


Hauptman filing can be found here.


EP-238 contains UDC’s only economically material patent claims, in


our view, especially the claims directed to emissive material in


OLEDs – specifically, phosphorescent organometallic iridium


compounds. If the EPO were to revoke EP-238’s surviving claims, we


believe it would materially impair UDC’s ability to generate future


licensing revenue, even from Samsung, UDC’s only material


customer.


The EPO Board of Appeal’s decision will be final, subject to an


enlarged Board proceeding, and there appears to be an


overwhelming amount of factual and legal evidence making it a


virtual certainty that EP-238 will revoked in its entirety, according


to the Lowe Hauptman filing and our own expert consultations. The


filing by itself is devastating to UDC. It shows how insignificant,


mundane experimentation was originally used to secure extremely


broad patent claims in EP-238 and corresponding key patents in


other jurisdictions. An in-depth, expert review of the


experimentation shows that it was frivolous rather than a


fundamental breakthrough.


The Lowe Hauptman filing systematically takes apart EP-238’s core


claims, examines the experiments conducted by UDC’s scientists


that form the basis of those claims, and addresses the merits of the


supposed invention. The Lowe Hauptman filing finds that UDC


scientists did not invent any single component of the claimed


invention. Rather, UDC scientists made routine optimizations using


existing, well-known materials and architectures. The filing finds


that under existing law, the Board of Appeal must revoke EP-238 in


its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step.
