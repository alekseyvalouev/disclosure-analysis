Company 
Promotion


Producer of ingredients and alcohol 
beverages hires new management and 
promotes reprioritization of “higher-
margin” premium alcohol beverages 


(e.g. bourbon and whiskey)


Maker of low-temperature sterilization

Our 
Criticism


Customer Diageo (8% LTM sales) was 
close to completing KY distillery of its 


own. Proliferation of US distilleries 
saturates market. Key ingredient 
patent, customer contracts set to 


expire in ‘17. History of operational 
disasters (explosions, etc.). Effectively 
out of cash, relying heavily on credit 
facility for liquidity. Restatements of 


related-party transactions did not 
reconcile. Regulators expanded audit 


investigation into MGP.


Poorly promoted single-product 
Canadian healthcare company with 


limited product value. Disclosure issues 
obfuscate actual end market sales, and 


overstatement of total addressable 
market. Over-promotion of a 


partnership with Getinge that would 
be destined to fail. Terrible insider 


alignment with mgmt. owning 1% of 
shares. 80%+ downside when Getinge 


deal fails.


Our intense fundamental and forensic 
due diligence uncovered evidence of 


slowing U.S. growth, and margin 
pressure being covered-up. We also 
expressed grave concerns about the 
Company’s strategy to build a U.S. 


manufacturing facility and believed its 
capex costs seemed overstated, which 
would allow capitalization of costs on 


the balance sheet and potentially 
overstate earnings


Increasingly high-end competitors 
taking share in robot vacuum space 


and pressuring ASPs. History of failures 
in non-vacuum products suggests 


inability to grow mop sales or 
successfully launch lawnmower. Rising 


DSIs suggest financial strain. 
Distributor acquisitions obscure 


underlying sales declines


Successful 
Outcome


Whiskey growth story ends as 
premium alcohol bubble falters. Long-
term guidance recently slashed. CFO 


with ties to accounting-challenged KHC 
resigns. Stock falls from high of ~$95 


per share to ~$25 per share.


On Jan 25, 2018, TSO3 discloses 
amendments to the Getinge 


partnership, validating Spruce Point’s 
criticisms (source). Multiple brokers 
downgrade shares from >C$5.00 to 
C$2.00. Share price made a low of 


C$0.48 in  Oct 2018, down 81%.


Two CEO/CEO’s and two CFO/CFO’s of 
Caesarstone have subsequently 


resigned. The Company has reported 
numerous manufacturing problems in 


both its new U.S. production and Israeli 
facilities. Gross margins contracted to 
25%. The share price has fallen >70% 


from our initiation price


Disappointing sales growth due to 
slower-than-projected robotic mop 


sales. Gross margins continue to 
decline due to increasing competition 


at both the low and high end of the 
market. FY outlook lowered. Long-


time CFO Alison Dean announces 
transition plan in Feb 2020


Spruce Point has a successful track record of identifying inflection points in consumer and medical product companies well ahead of sell-side 
analysts and other investors.

Our Criticism New management is more aggressive, using 
financial and accounting tactics to inflate the 


share price. The recent acquisition of 
FLAWLESS hair care was expensive and will 


disappoint investors. Governance lapses 
have allowed management to reap unjust 


bonuses based on non-cash gains. Shares at 
$80 trade 8% above analyst targets


AMETEK isn’t creating any value by 
delivering zero organic growth and 


that its financial statements showed

accounting. We believed its 


premium valuation multiple could 
not be sustained as the quality of its 


acquisitions deteriorated


Excessive cost capitalization from a 
12 year “Blue Ocean” ERP

14% over avg analyst price target


China capital expenditure 
anomalies, notably consistent mis-


forecasting. Capex issues often 
linked to gross margin inflation. 


Excessive spending on a protracted 
ERP implementation also often 


linked to accounting and

Successful 
Outcome


Within the first quarter after our report, CHD 
reported disappointing Q3 sales results, cut 


its full year revenue guidance, and issued Q4 
earnings at $0.54, well below the $0.62 


expected. Management blamed higher sales 
and marketing expenses on FLAWLESS. 


CHD’s new 10-K added risk factors around 
financial controls and it Chief Accounting 


Officer is “retiring”


By early 2016, AMETEK began 
guiding down sales and earnings 


expectations for multiple quarters. 
Its CEO and CFO abruptly retired. Its 
share price fell nearly 20% from our 


initial report date


Q2 2019 missed sales estimates by the 
widest margin in years, and initial 
2020 guidance issued in Q3 2019, 


missed estimates with lower sales and 
earnings growth. Management failed 
to address any of the issues identified 


by Spruce Point. The share price 
corrected by 22%


AOS admitted an undisclosed 
material supply chain partner 


following a report by firm J Capital. 
In Q2 2018, AOS substantially 


revised guidance, showing 
weakness in China with sales 


projected down 16-17%. AOS fired

“Being an S&P 500 company is a validation of absolutely nothing, and can be a wasteland of corporate mediocrity. The bigger

We’ve Seen This Story Before: Align Mirrors 
Other Successful Spruce Point Shorts


We believe that Align shares many features and themes of other successful Spruce Point shorts. In particular, we believe that Align, much like 
iRobot, is an industry incumbent whose investors mistakenly believe can continue its pace of growth with little threat of serious competition. 


Spruce Point, however, finds evidence of new competitors which are poised to upend industry economics – NOT just SmileDirectClub and other 
direct-to-consumer players, but other players which, to our knowledge, have never before been taken into consideration by investors.

Executive Summary

Short ALGN: Spruce Point Sees 40%-55% 
Downside To $80-$115 Per Share


Third-Party Labs Turning Aligners Into Commodities: For close to 20 years, Align operated as the lone major player in the clear aligner space, with other large dental 
equipment suppliers only recently entering the industry. Over just the past two years, however, patent expirations and developments in 3D printing have enabled 
dozens of third-party printing labs to begin to produce FDA-approved aligners of their own, threatening to transform the clear aligner from “high-tech” dental 
equipment into a low-value-added, easy-to-source commodity. What’s more, the former developer and provider of Align’s own polymer has developed a new plastic 
which can be used by third-party labs to produce aligners of comparable quality to Invisalign. Spruce Point has obtained term sheets from one such third-party lab 
which reveal that dental practitioners can save over 50% per case on average by sourcing from it rather than Align, and that a typical practice – depending on its 
volume – could increase its cash flow by close to 10% simply by switching from Align. We find evidence that large orthodontic organizations are considering 
switching from Align to third-party labs, and that other major dental players are already slashing prices to as low as 33% of Align’s in response to this competition. 
We believe that Align will inevitably be forced to follow suit – or else lose significant case volume – as third-party labs grow increasingly mainstream.


Under-The-Radar Improvements In Workflow Technology Make In-House 3D Printing A Threat: Until now, Align bulls have generally considered in-house 3D 
printing an inconvenient alternative to Align, as in-house printing forces orthodontists to bring entirely new workflows into their offices. Through a proprietary 
survey of high-volume orthodontists, together with conversations with industry experts, we find that interest towards in-house printing is in fact extremely high 
among doctors, who are attracted to the potential efficiencies and cost savings. We find that broader adoption of in-house printing has been constrained NOT by 
limited demand, but by the relatively limited supply of quality technological infrastructure to support this workflow – in particular, high-quality CAD/CAM aligner 
design software. However, with Align’s patents on this technology recently having expired, major innovations are coming to this space as we speak. Notably, uLab 
Technologies – a company founded by former Align executives and employees who were themselves behind the most successful attempt to compete with Align 
during the 2000s – is in the process of rolling out CAD/CAM software which experts believe to represent a step change over existing solutions. The full-scale launch is 
expected to occur this spring. With the final barriers to widespread in-house printing adoption set to fall in the near term, we expect interest in 3D printing – which 
offers even greater cost savings than third-party labs – to expand dramatically.


Emergent Competition Already Putting Pressure On Align: Though still relatively novel, Spruce Point observes that these competitive forces are already beginning to 
pressure industry pricing and threaten Align’s case volume. Our diligence reveals that a large dental service organization (DSO) representing up to 12% of Align’s US 
aligner volume is actively exploring opportunities to source aligners from third-party labs. Meanwhile, we are told that 3M is offering orthodontists lab fees as low as 
$500-$600 per case – less than one third the price of a comprehensive Invisalign case. We believe that this is just the beginning of a longer-term trend.


By now, investors in Align Technology, Inc. (“ALGN” or “the Company”) are used to hearing that competitors are, for the first time, beginning to 
penetrate the clear aligner space. The bullish consensus: dental equipment competitors can coexist with Align, but cannot yet compete toe-to-toe 


with the 20-year incumbent.
The reality: the economics of clear aligners are on the precipice of a radical shift – and it has little to do with SmileDirectClub or other direct-to-


consumer players. Once considered high-value-added “dental tech,” FDA-approved aligners of similar quality to Invisalign – Align’s clear aligner 
product – are now being printed at scale by commodity 3D printing labs, which price their aligners at less than half the cost of Align’s. Meanwhile, 


patent expirations have ushered in under-the-radar developments in aligner design software which are removing the final barriers to the 
widespread adoption of 3D printers by orthodontists – many of whom are infuriated with Align’s aggressive tactics, and who are actively exploring 
their options in a market which, for the first time, offers numerous (cheaper) alternatives to Align. On-the-ground diligence reveals that large dental 
players are already slashing aligner prices in response to these shifts, in some cases to as low as a third the price of Invisalign. We believe that it 


is only a matter of time – perhaps accelerated by industry cost pressures brought on by the pandemic – until Align is forced to follow suit.

Short ALGN: Spruce Point Sees 40%-55% 
Downside To $80-$115 Per Share


Widespread Dissatisfaction With Align Could Accelerate Customer Losses: Align bulls are quick to argue that the Company’s brand and practitioner network 
protect it from new competition. We find that orthodontists are, almost universally, anywhere from dissatisfied to infuriated with Align, which continues to 
raise prices aggressively on orthodontic practices even as costs fall across the rest of the space, and which has threatened orthodontists’ control over the 
teeth alignment industry by selling to dentists and backing direct-to-consumer players. With competitive options proliferating across the space for the first 
time in ~20 years, Spruce Point observes that even Align’s highest-volume orthodontists are actively pursuing alternatives – and doubly so as they pause 
normal operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has given them a unique opportunity to explore cost-saving measures.


Growth Into The Purported TAM Will Be More Difficult Than Expected: Management claims that Align captures just 1.5M of over 8M annual worldwide 
malocclusion cases which Invisalign can be used to treat, and that there are more than 300M additional candidates who would benefit from more minor 
treatments with clear aligners. However, we estimate that Align is already close to 80% penetrated among US orthodontists, making further growth into the 
domestic orthodontic channel difficult – particularly as increasing competition induces churn and causes utilization to fall. Meanwhile, cheaper competitors 
and DTC players like SmileDirectClub will make it difficult for Align to capture meaningful share of lower-complexity cases without reducing prices materially.


Management Reducing Transparency While Showing Little Confidence In The Business: After reducing disclosures which would have made it easier for 
investors to see the impact of competitive pressures on Company results, management expanded a number of risk factors in its most recent 10-K in ways that 
suggest that more aggressive competition is on the way. At the same time – just as sales growth decelerates and margins compress – insiders are selling their 
holdings of ALGN shares in size, while simultaneously increasing the Company buyback by 4x. With the Company experiencing declining growth as it is pinched 
by a more crowded competitive landscape, pivoting to M&A to support future growth, and buying back shares just as insiders sell out, Spruce Point feels that 
Align exhibits many of the classic characteristics of a business under pressure.


COVID-19 Pandemic Poses Unique Short-Term Risk, While Competitive Threats Could Inhibit Rebound: Shares in ALGN have largely traded in-line with the 
market as investors bet on when restrictions on normal economic activity will be lifted. However, with clear aligner therapy – an elective, cosmetic treatment 
– falling among the least critical of medical procedures, Align bears outsized risk to the potential lingering effects of the disease, which may not only depress 
discretionary spending for an extended period, but also prevent orthodontic offices from reopening entirely for up to a number of months, and discourage 
patients from entering what may be a high-risk, aerosol-laden environment thereafter. Meanwhile, our diligence indicates that orthodontists are using their 
time off to evaluate their practices’ cost structures and identify areas of potential cost savings – a trend which could result in accelerated switching away from 
Invisalign as the competitive landscape becomes increasingly crowded with low-priced providers. We estimate that case volume could fall by anywhere from 
30% to 90% worldwide YoY in Q2, with the lingering effects continuing to drive declines of 20-30% for the rest of the year. We believe that near-term earnings 
revisions in the face of the ongoing crisis will serve as catalysts for downward moves in the stock, as revisions have before.


Not A Post-Pandemic Bounce Back Candidate, Even As Shares Trade Down: As ALGN shares trade lower with the market as the pandemic grows increasingly 
drawn-out, bulls with faith in the long-term growth story likely see the stock as a strong “buy low” opportunity. Spruce Point strongly disagrees: not only does 
Align bear outsized risk to the continued prevalence of COVID-19 beyond 2020, but the proliferation of competitors and alternative aligner printing 
technologies will, in our opinion, prevent the Company from bouncing back with the same force as the rest of the dental/orthodontic space. Spruce Point sees 
40%-55% downside in ALGN to $80-$115 per share on disappointing case volume growth in FY21 and ongoing ASP pressure amidst an expanded competitive 
landscape. ALGN’s ~24x FY21 earnings multiple could also compress as investors increasingly understand the competitive forces facing the Company going 
forward, bringing the potential for even greater downside to ALGN shares.

Not A Long-Term Buy Amidst COVID Selling: A New 
Competitive Landscape Will Exist On The Other Side


Spruce Point believes that very recent and underappreciated developments in the clear aligner landscape undermine most of the key tenets of the 
bull case for Align. Investors must begin to adapt their understanding of the space to new and rapidly-evolving competitive realities.


Theme Bulls Believe... Spruce Point Findings And Conclusions


Competition 
And Pricing


• The only material competitors in the space are other large dental 
equipment providers, none of which has made significant headway 
in the space


• Align has a 20+ year head-start on clear aligner technology, and 
produces aligners which are both superior to competing products 
and applicable in a wider range of treatments


• Align’s limited competition and technological advantages support a 
stable pricing environment


• Orthodontists are comfortable with Invisalign and do not yet see 
competing products as sufficient substitutes


• Third-party 3D printing labs are obtaining FDA approval to print clear aligners at a rapid pace, 
and, as a whole, quickly achieving sufficient scale to compete


• Third-party labs now have access to high-quality aligner materials developed by Align’s own 
former plastics provider. Industry experts report that these aligners are of comparable quality 
to Align’s.


• Third-party labs offer aligners which, on an all-in cost basis, are 50-65% cheaper to the 
orthodontist than Invisalign. Other large dental equipment players are slashing prices to 
similar levels in response.


• Large buying groups – including one  representing up to 12% of Align’s orthodontic Americas 
case volume – are actively exploring lower-cost alternatives to Invisalign


In-House 3D 
Printing


• Orthodontists and dentists are not interested in taking the hassle 
of 3D printing in-house


• 3D printing technology cannot produce aligners of comparable 
quality to Invisalign


• Align has a massive head-start in Aligner design software 
technology


• Interest towards in-house 3D printing is extremely high among orthodontists: over 50% of 
high-volume orthodontists surveyed by Spruce Point either have or are actively considering in-
house 3D printers, which produce aligners at an all-in cost (to the doctor) 75% below Invisalign


• Orthodontists can use the same high-quality material now used by third-party labs to print 
their own clear aligners


• Recent developments in CAD/CAM aligner design software by highly-experienced industry 
veterans are making in-house 3D printing extremely user-friendly


Addressable 
Market


• Align has penetrated just ~12% of the global malocclusion market
• Align has a long runway for growth by opening the teeth alignment 


market to 300M unpenetrated potential treatment candidates with 
less complex treatment needs


• Align is near a saturation point in its US orthodontist base.
• Competition is becoming fierce among the lower-complexity market as competition enters 


both the doctor-directed and direct-to-consumer spaces. Align will likely have to dramatically 
reduce prices to be suited to this market


Doctor 
Loyalty


• Doctors want to remain Align customers to benefit from volume-
based discounts and to receive leads from Align’s practitioner 
network


• Orthodontists are infuriated with Align for continuing to increase prices even as other costs 
across the orthodontic industry fall, and for opening up alignment treatments to dentists and 
the direct-to-consumer channel


COVID-19 
Risk


• Align performance will suffer through the pandemic, but practices 
will inevitably return to normal and experience pent-up demand 
for Invisalign


• Teeth-straightening treatment is not just elective, but cosmetic and discretionary, and will be 
among the last medical treatments to return as the pandemic subsides – particularly if 
unemployment remains elevated, and if concerns over aerosols discourage orthodontist visits


• Orthodontists are using their time off from normal business as an opportunity to review cost-
cutting opportunities, putting Align at risk for accelerated competitive losses

FDA 510(k) Approvals for Clear Aligner Production


Actual Expected (Spruce Point)


FDA Approvals For Clear Aligner Production 
Are Accelerating Rapidly


More informed investors may have been aware of the presence of third-party 3D printing labs in the clear aligner space in prior years. Until now, 
however, they have been only very minor players, as only one or two new producers were granted FDA 510(k) approvals for printing clear aligners 


in most years prior to 2018. However, since 2018, 33 new producers have been approved by the FDA to print clear aligners – more than those 
cleared in all years leading up to 2018 combined – and we are currently on pace to see more than 18 new approvals through the rest of 2020.


To the extent that investors are at all aware of the presence of third-party 3D printing labs in the clear aligner space, they have likely been 
conditioned to treat them as extremely minor players with limited scale and/or limited credibility among doctors.


Spruce Point believes that, with so many now obtaining FDA approvals, third-party labs are, as a whole, quickly achieving the scale and 
credibility necessary to pose a serious threat to established clear aligner producers.

“We are at the point where we can switch to another clear aligner 
vendor and we would not have even entertained that two years 
ago… There are over 100 aligner companies coming out of 
Asia. Two to three years from now, I don't see how Invisalign 
will see the same amount of cases that they had in the past.”

“You can setup a clear aligner FDA approved lab in less than a year.
Your capital equipment costs between buying three [high-volume] 3D 
printers and thermoforming machines can be less than $100K to get 
started. If you add in labor, your total costs in your first year will be 
less than $200K.”

At approximately what price level of lab fees would you (or 
did you) consider switching a majority of yoru Invisalign case 
volume to other clear aligner providers or alternative third-
party workflow solutions, assuming clinical outcomes were

Has Clarity (3M) been in your offices to discuss their clear aligner 
products and pricing?


Doctors Reveal That Pricing Pressure Is Already 
Coming To The Space


Dentists and orthodontists across the US tell us that the influx of competition is already beginning to weigh on industry pricing. Through a 
proprietary survey of high-volume orthodontists and conversations with a variety of dental professionals, we have learned that 3M is acting 


aggressively to win new business for its Clarity aligners by offering steep discounts. Of the 31 high-volume orthodontists included in our survey 
– a far different population than the more diverse groups covered most sell-side surveys, but one much more critical to the business – close to 
60% have had an in-office visit from 3M to discuss Clarity aligners. Our conversations reveal that 3M is offering lab fees as low as $500-600 per 
case, far below Align’s average lab fee – even among high-volume orthodontists receiving heavy discounts. Our survey also reveals that most 


orthodontists would consider Align alternatives if offered lab fees between $800-1,000, a threshold which 3M already appears to have surpassed.


Spruce Point believes that it is only a matter of time before Align is forced to slash its own lab fees to maintain its existing orthodontist base, 
or else risk losing significant case volume.


“3M is offering me cases at a $500 lab fee compared to 
my Invisalign Lab fee of $1,000. If I can start doing more 
cases with 3M and it will save me money, why not just 
switch? 3M software is excellent. It is very easy to use. 
They brought a lot of people over from Invisalign. It’s 
getting to the point where it will be as good as 
Invisalign.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“3M came to me and said that we can do all of your cases 
for $600… I expect my Invisalign volumes to be down 
going forward”

Not Just Hypothetical: Major DSOs Considering 3D 
Printing Centers, Both In-Sourced And Outsourced


Spruce Point emphasizes that, while 3D printing centers are relatively new to the clear aligner space, the threat which they pose is not merely 
hypothetical: high-volume buying groups are actively considering switching to them from Invisalign. Our diligence reveals that, just as third-party 
labs have become a realistic option for aligner sourcing among independent dentists & orthodontists, larger dental service organizations (DSOs) 


are exploring the possibility of setting up their own 3D printing labs to support their practices, as well as to support new revenue streams. In 
particular, we find that one DSO representing up to 12% of Align’s orthodontic case starts in the Americas is actively exploring 3D printing center 
opportunities. Given the low cost of setting up an FDA-compliant printing lab – less than $200K, per industry experts – these organizations, which 
can represent thousands of practices, would have little trouble establishing organization-wide printing centers, which could generate significant 


savings across a large number of practices. Industry experts confirm that DSO migration represents a major risk to Align’s case volumes.


“There is a 50% chance that we move away from Invisalign when our 
contract comes up in 2020 and for me to say that is a big deal. It's a 
really big deal. I personally have not been happy with the service for 
the last year and half.”


- Dentist, Top 10 DSO


“Invisalign case volume at DSOs is the biggest risk in the dentist 
channel. One big one that launches in house aligners and it is going 
to be a huge loss. If you have 1,000 practices in your DSO, each dentist 
could easily be doing 50 Invisalign cases a year, so with just one DSO, 
you could have 50,000 annual cases at risk.”


- Dentist, Top 10 DSO


“You can setup a clear aligner FDA approved lab in less than a year.
Your capital equipment costs between buying three [high-volume] 3D 
printers and thermoforming machines can be less than $100K to get 
started. If you add in labor, your total costs in your first year will be 
less than $200K.”

Align Bulls Are Mistaken About Orthodontist 
Attitudes Towards 3D Printing


Most Align bulls all but take for granted the notion that orthodontists and dentists view in-house 3D printing as an inevitable nuisance. They 
acknowledge recent innovation and price declines within the in-house 3D printing space, but are convinced that many orthodontists simply do 


not want to deal with the logistics of in-house printing. Our survey and conversations with high-volume orthodontists suggest otherwise. Spruce 
Point finds that, while just 6% of surveyed orthodontists currently own a 3D printer, over 50% plan on purchasing a 3D printer in the future – even 


with prevailing software not quite yet up to par with third-party CAD/CAM aligner design software. In particular, when asked what in particular 
would most likely convince them to allocate aligner cases to channels other than Align, the most popular answers given were the major selling 


points of in-house 3D printing: greater case control and more efficient case execution.


As in-house 3D printing grows increasingly mainstream, Spruce Point believes that the major selling points of in-house 3D printing will drive 
significant demand for this option.


Over 60% of respondents plan to 
use an in-house 3D printer to 


print clear aligners (or do already)


Biggest drivers behind desire to seek 
Align alternatives match major selling 


points of in-house 3D printing


“I now have the capability of providing same day treatment with clear 
aligners which I could not do with Invisalign. I would have to wait at 
least two weeks. With my own 3D printer, I can have aligners the same day 
and I can also alter an aligner case on the same day. This really helps my 
practice be more efficient throughout the patient’s treatment.”


- Orthodontist


“The difference between braces and Invisalign is if there is a change needed 
mid case. With Invisalign, I may need to wait 2-4 weeks to get a new aligners 
to continue the case. With braces, I can make the change immediately. With 
3D printing in your office, you have an aligner the same day which will 
make case management simpler.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“I know that when you are a new doctor, you get the worst Invisalign technicians 
out of Costa Rica that are designing your case. Sometimes, you are going back 
and forth with the technician as many as eight times before the case is right.”

New Software Overcomes Many Of The 
Shortcomings Of In-House 3D Printing


Spruce Point believes that the recent emergence of uLab Systems – a relatively little-known developer of aligner CAD/CAM software – represents 
a major step towards making in-house 3D printing a practical option for a broad range of doctors. Much as Zendura’s newest aligner material was 


created by Align’s original plastics supplier, uLab was created by former Align technology and sales executives with close knowledge of the 
aligner software market, and a strong understanding of where current 3D printing software is coming up short. These same individuals launched 


a similar competitive bid against Align in the early 2000s in the form of OrthoClear – a bid so threatening that, when they settled their litigation 
with Align by having Align buy them out in Sep 2006, Align’s share price immediately more than doubled.

“What we created 22 years ago [at Align Technologies took] control from the 
orthodontists and clinicians to do the treatment planning because a lot of things 
were unknown back then…. We didn’t have the computational power that is 
available to us today. We didn’t have intraoral scanning, the 3D printing was not in 
a state it is in today… The system that was designed in such a way that it was a 
centralized model that was highly controlled by the manufacturer. And like anything 
else, as businesses grow and scale, their legacy issue is that they keep the 
same architecture. About 4 years ago, we looked at the state of the 
technology and no one [was] breaking the mold and coming up with new 
ideas of how to do clear aligners differently and that is how uLab was born.”

Third-Party Labs And In-House 3D Printing Offer 
Overwhelming Cost Savings On Case-By-Case Basis


Spruce Point observes that the cost savings made possible by sourcing from third-party labs or printing aligners in-house are overwhelming. In 
particular, printing aligners in-house allows dentists and orthodontists to save over 75% versus Align on a per-case basis. This on top of the fact 
that in-house printing gives the orthodontist greater control over the case, allows him to complete the treatment with substantially fewer patient 
visits, and can be faster and easier than designing an aligner remotely with an outsourced technician (10 minutes vs. 30 minutes when done with 


the right software, per our conversations with doctors).

Clear Aligner Case Economics Example:
Comprehensive Case with 44 Aligners (Covering Both Arches)


“My material costs per aligner are about 
$5 to $6 and when I factor in labor, I am 
printing aligners for approximately $10. 
As my staff gets more efficient, the cost 
will go lower. 3D printers are getting 
faster and cheaper as well, so a new 
investment there will eventually lower the 
cost as well.”

Third-Party Printing Labs And In-House 3D 
Printing Offer Substantial Cost Savings


Spruce Point finds that, for large-volume orthodontists, printing in-house could produce over 50% more savings over Align compared to sourcing 
from third-party labs, and would allow most orthodontists even of lesser tiers to save over 60% compared to Align fees themselves. We estimate 
that the option to switch to in-house printing presents the average Diamond Plus Align customer with a $400K per year cost savings opportunity. 
We believe that, as in-house 3D printing grows increasingly mainstream with improvements in printer and software technology, printing in-house 
could well become a no-brainer option for a large share of the orthodontist population. Align would inevitably be forced to cut prices dramatically 


or otherwise suffer serious case volume losses among its highest-volume customers.

Case Study: Cost Savings From Align Alternatives A 
Material Benefit To Orthodontist Profitability


Our diligence into the cost structure of orthodontic offices allows us to evaluate the potential impact of Align alternatives on their bottom lines. 
Our findings: current Align customers could increase their cash flows by close to 10% by instead sourcing their aligners from a third-party lab, or 


by over 12% by printing aligners in-house. We believe that the magnitude of this potential cost savings will be too great for many orthodontic 
offices to ignore – something which the current pandemic-driven pause in business will allow (and encourage) them to evaluate.

TAM-Driven Argument For Future Case Growth 
Undermined By Emerging Threats


Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sell side anticipated top-line growth of approximately 20% in FY20 and beyond for Align, on long-term case 
growth of 20-30% per year. However, with the North American orthodontist channel increasingly saturated for Align, and with overwhelming 


competition coming to the dental, orthodontic, and all international channels, we believe that total case growth could revert to a run-rate level of 
just over 10% in the near-to-medium term. With Align likely to experience powerful pricing pressure from the onset of new competition at the 


same time, run-rate revenue growth could collapse to mid-single-digit levels – a tremendous drop-off from consensus estimates of ~20% long-
term annual growth.

How Bad Could The Coming Quarter Be?


While it is no secret that Q2 will be a historically bad quarter for many companies and sectors, Spruce Point believes that investors are not fully 
prepared for the likely near-term impact of the pandemic on Align. As of today, the most conservative of orthodontists and dentists anticipate 
closures through the end of April. Many more plan to be closed through the middle or end of May at earliest. Even then, we anticipate that new 


cases will be extremely sparse immediately upon their return for at least several weeks. This suggests that Q2 FY20 EPS could be down by close 
to 50% YoY in an optimistic scenario in which dental practitioners return to work in mid-May – an aggressive timetable at this point.

ALGN: Shares Held By Insiders


Management Trimming Exposure As 
Competition Mounts And Results Falter


Spruce Point observes that, just as Align’s performance has begun to deteriorate with the emergence of new competition, insiders have steadily 
and consistently trimmed their exposure to the stock. Today, insiders own just over 1% of outstanding shares. Meanwhile, the Company has 
expanded its buyback from just under $100M in FY14 to $400M in FY19. Spruce Point frequently sees insider selling paired with accelerated 
buybacks among companies under increasing strain. We worry that this is a signal that Align’s insiders are heading for the exits ahead of 


renewed pressures with an explosion of new competitors.

Capitalization And Valuation


With most sell-side estimates having been adjusted only conservatively in the face of tremendous uncertainty for Align amidst the current 
pandemic, Spruce Point believes that near-term earnings adjustments are highly likely, and could serve as a catalyst for a material downward 


move in the stock – just as they have before. Meanwhile, just as it begins to face stronger growth headwinds amidst an increasingly congested 
competitive landscape, the Company spent close to $420M – half its available cash – on a software acquisition intended to increase sell-through 
to the dentist channel. Spruce Point believes that, not only could near-term uncertainty elicit earnings revisions which pressure the stock, but 


longer-term competitive challenges will prevent the Company from rebounding as bulls expect.

Clear Aligners: A Brief Background
24


A Brief History Of Clear Aligners


While single-piece tooth positioners have existed in some form since 1945, it was only in the late 1990s and early 2000s that clear aligners 
emerged as a practical alternative to bracket-and-wire systems for teeth realignment. In 1997, Align’s founders – Stanford graduate students at 


the time – developed a system by which oral impressions could be replicated in computer imaging software, which could then be used to 3D-print 
sets of aligners designed specifically for an individual patient’s teeth. Throughout a course of treatment ranging from 6 to 18 months, an 


orthodontist or dentist applies to the patient’s teeth a number of aligners designed to accomplish specific “movements.” Each set of aligners is 
swapped out for another at various stages of the treatment process until each “movement” is complete. Clear aligner treatment plans can include 


the use of traditional wire braces to address more complex cases or to shorten the duration of the treatment.
25


The Clear Aligner Process


Today, the Invisalign process begins with an “intraoral scan” of the patient’s teeth. Using Invisalign’s proprietary iTero intraoral scanner (or 
another scanner if desired, though only outside the US), the orthodontist or dentist generates a 3D digital image of the patient’s teeth, which can 


then be used to develop a customized treatment plan via Invisalign’s ClinCheck software. The doctor submits the image to a technician in 
Invisalign’s design headquarters in San Jose, Costa Rica, who then consults with the doctor to develop and finalize the treatment plan through 


ClinCheck. Once finalized, the plan is sent to Invisalign’s manufacturing plant, where the aligners are printed and ultimately shipped to the doctor.

Competition Finally Enters After 20 Years Of 
Align Dominance


For years, Align was effectively the lone major player in the clear aligner space, protected by an IP portfolio which it enforced vigorously in court. 
However, the Company’s key patents finally began to expire in 2017, creating an opening for dental tech competitors to enter the market. The 


influx of competition in the clear aligner space has dramatically transformed the market landscape since 2010. Even those with limited knowledge 
of the clear aligner industry will likely be familiar with the emergence of the SmileDirectClub, a provider of “do-it-yourself” aligners sold directly to 


the consumer (“DTC”) rather than through dentists or orthodontists. Bulls have arrived at the consensus that DTC aligners cannot address the 
more serious cases of malocclusion which Align is used to treat, and, as such, do not pose an immediate threat to Align. Spruce Point does not 


necessarily disagree. Rather, we observe newly-emerging competitive dynamics which pose a threat to the economics and competitive rationality 
of Align’s core “doctor-directed” channel, among both “comprehensive” and “non-comprehensive” cases.


Some of these changes to the competitive landscape will be familiar to Align investors. Others will not. Spruce Point believes, however, that, 
taken as a whole, these developments will (and are beginning to) drive seismic shifts in the economics of the clear aligner space, which was 


until recently occupied by just one major player.

Third-Party Labs Blow Open Doors To The 
Competitive Landscape


Most commentary on the evolving aligner landscape among the investment community has tended to focus on established players in the dental 
industry – 3M, Dentsply Sirona, Straumann, Henry Schein, and Envista in particular (in addition to SmileDirectClub). This commentary, however, 
ignores another major source of competition which has begun to make inroads among orthodontists and dentists: third-party 3D printing labs. 


Outsourced 3D printing centers which print a wide variety of products for other clients are increasingly beginning to offer their services to 
dentists and orthodontists for the manufacture of custom clear aligners, designed by outsourced dental technicians in consultation with the 


doctor. This has opened a new avenue for disruptive upstarts to offer FDA-approved clear aligners in what is perceived to be a space occupied by 
just a handful of established dental players.


INVESTOR PERCEPTION: Clear aligners as specialized medical equipment which can be produced by only a small number of established dental 
device players.


REALITY: Medical-grade clear aligners are plastic commodities that can be printed by any 3D printing lab which bothers to obtain FDA approval.

Third-Party Labs New To The Space, But Ramping 
Quickly, And Proactively Marketing To Doctors


Align bulls may be inclined not to take third-party 3D printing labs seriously as a potential Invisalign competitor. Spruce Point would strongly 
advise that investors not underestimate this emerging threat. Not only are these labs capable of producing aligners of comparable quality to 


Invisalign, but they are rapidly expanding capacity and, per our conversations with dental professionals, aggressively reaching out to 
orthodontists and dentists. Align investors should not be taken off-guard by the novelty of outsourced 3D printing in the clear aligner space: our 


diligence reveals that third-party labs are quickly gaining traction.


Spruce Point believes that the aggressive entry of third-party 3D printing labs into the clear aligner space could quickly render the aligner a low-
value-added commodity in short order.

FDA 510(k) Approvals for Clear Aligner Production


Actual Expected (Spruce Point)


FDA Approvals For Clear Aligner Production 
Are Accelerating Rapidly


More informed investors may have been aware of the presence of third-party 3D printing labs in the clear aligner space in prior years. Until now, 
however, they have been only very minor players, as only one or two new producers were granted FDA 510(k) approvals for printing clear aligners 


in most years prior to 2018. However, since 2018, 33 new producers have been approved by the FDA to print clear aligners – more than those 
cleared in all years leading up to 2018 combined – and we are currently on pace to see more than 18 new approvals through the rest of 2020.


To the extent that investors are at all aware of the presence of third-party 3D printing labs in the clear aligner space, they have likely been 
conditioned to treat them as extremely minor players with limited scale and/or limited credibility among doctors.


Spruce Point believes that, with so many now obtaining FDA approvals, third-party labs are, as a whole, quickly achieving the scale and 
credibility necessary to pose a serious threat to established clear aligner producers.

Outsourced Design Services Also Embracing 
Third-Party 3D Printing Labs


Similar disruption is occurring across the clear aligner value chain in ways that are supporting innovative competition in the manufacturing 
process. In particular, the space has seen the emergence of numerous dedicated aligner design services, which work with orthodontists and 


dentists to develop treatment plans and to design a patient’s aligners accordingly – a similar role played by Align’s treatment planning 
headquarters in Costa Rica. These increasingly high-quality third-party design services allow doctors to design aligners to be printed by third-
party printing labs just as they would design aligners to be printed by Align itself. FullContour, one such third-party design service, has alone 
seen its base of aligner manufacturer partners grow by 50% since June 2018. Spruce Point believes that the growth and improving quality of 


these services will support the continued penetration of third-party 3D printing labs into the clear aligner space.


By supporting not only large, recognizable players like Straumann and Zimmer Biomet, but also third-party 3D printing labs like Voodoo 
Manufacturing, third-party aligner design services are lowering the barrier to entry in the aligner manufacturing space, and making low-cost 


aligner manufacturers more accessible to a wider range of dentists and orthodontists.

Has The Materials Gap Closed?


Align management touts its proprietary SmartTrack material as superior to all other plastics available to other clear aligner producers (and users 
of in-house 3D printers). New developments, however, appear to have closed any outstanding gaps between SmartTrack and the rest of the field. 


In particular, Bay Materials – the same polymer product development laboratory which supplied Align’s own clear aligner plastics through the 
early 2010s – recently announced the release of Zendura FLX, its newest clear aligner material. Our conversations with industry experts reveal 


that this material achieves a multi-layer structure similar to that of SmartTrack, giving it analogous flexibility and crack resistance while allowing 
for a similar level of comfort. Spruce Point believes that further developments by materials producers – particularly one as experienced in aligner 


plastics development as Align’s own former supplier – will only continue to close any gaps between SmartTrack and other aligner plastics.


Spruce Point believes that the ongoing proliferation of third-party 3D printing labs in the clear aligner space will only incentivize further R&D directed at 
clear aligner development: whereas Align was, until recently, the only major player in the clear aligner space, materials producers now face a broad and 


rapidly-growing number of potential customers for clear aligner plastics.


ALGN: Stephens Investor Conference (Nov 13, 2019)


“So the question is on product differentiation between us and 
maybe some of the other traditional orthodontic clear aligner 
companies. It starts with, one, we've been able to -- over 22 
years being able to understand how to move teeth in a 
predictable, reliable way. Some of that's product we've been 
able to put down. We have over 800 patents that are around 
how to move teeth from a software standpoint, from just the 
mechanics of moving teeth with attachments and gingiva cut 
and other parts of the -- even the material, SmartTrack 
material, which is a multi-layer material that moves teeth 
on a predictable, reliable way. So there's a lot of technology 
that's gone in that certainly differentiates products.”

Last-Ditch Effort To Pitch Its Material As A 
Competitive Advantage?


Spruce Point observes that, just as competitors make inroads towards creating clear aligner plastics of comparable quality to Align’s, the 
Company is now – for the first time – listing its SmartTrack Aligner material as a “key competitive factor” in its 10-K. We see this as a last-ditch 


effort to reinforce management’s argument that its material is truly differentiated and unlike any other material offered by other clear aligner 
providers. Our diligence reveals that this is no longer the case. Indeed, the fact that management cites its material as a key competitive factor just 


as other providers are developing aligner materials of comparable quality suggests to us that Align’s competitive advantage is quickly eroding.


Why is management suddenly listing its SmartTrack material as its #1 key competitive factor after not even disclosing it as a competitive 
factor at all in the past?

Individual Labs Do Not Need Massive Scale To 
Put Pricing Pressure On Align Collectively


Do third-party labs have sufficient scale to compete with Align, a global clear aligner producer? Spruce Point believes that they are well on their 
way: while many of these labs are, individually, relatively smaller in scale, their rapid proliferation could make them a powerful force in the 
industry on a collective basis in the near future. Importantly, our diligence reveals that clear aligner printing labs are neither difficult nor 


expensive to start up: a lab of modest scale could cost as little as $100K in up-front spending. While such a lab would have relatively limited 
capacity individually, the rapid spread of clear aligner producers across the US – encouraged by exceedingly low startup costs – is quickly 


expanding the scale of third-party labs. The dramatically lower prices offered by these labs versus Align will only intensify industry-wide pricing 
pressure into the future.


“You can setup a clear aligner FDA approved lab in less than a year.
Your capital equipment costs between buying three [high-volume] 3D printers 
and thermoforming machines can be less than $100K to get started. If you 
add in labor, your total costs in your first year will be less than $200K.”


- Senior Employee, Major Dental Equipment Supplier


ALGN: Legacy Manufacturing


While Align has relative scale in manufacturing, it has not been pressured to leverage its scale to match competitors’ prices until now, as it 
was effectively the only major player in the clear aligner space until the mid-2010s. The expansion of third-party labs, we believe, will help to 


force Align to adjust its prices downwards.


Third-Party Labs: Proliferation Of Manufacturers With Minute Startup Costs


“Our group has a committee looking to get a 
relationship with one of these [third-party labs] as 
our own print farm. They seem keen on one or

Clear Aligner Production Proliferating Rapidly


Spruce Point observes that domestic, FDA-approved clear aligner producers are distributed widely across the country. This suggests that, 
though some third-party 3D printing sites may individually be relatively smaller in scale than Align (for now), most US orthodontists and dentists 
are in close proximity to at least one clear aligner producer with sufficient capacity to service a more regionalized market. Local third-party labs 


need not necessarily match Align’s global scale in order to pose a serious competitive threat as a whole: they can collectively achieve meaningful 
scale by serving only smaller regions individually. With start-up costs so low for a third-party lab with modest capacity, it may not be long before 


low-cost clear aligner producers blanket the country.


While clear aligner producers can ship anywhere, their increasingly broad distribution across the US highlights the fact that, collectively, 
individual labs are quickly growing capacity and achieving national scale. Even individual orthodontists with in-house printers are offering 


capacity at the margin.

Source Materials Allow Spruce Point To 
Conduct Comprehensive Cost Comparison


Through our rigorous diligence process, we have obtained Align’s Pricing Terms and Conditions sheet for US practitioners, in addition to the 
details of Align’s volume-based discount program (“Advantage”). Taken together, these documents reveal the price charged by Align to its dental 
practitioner base for each Invisalign treatment program. We have also obtained the Terms and Conditions for Voodoo Clear Aligners, a third-party 
3D printing lab FDA-approved to print aligners. These source documents allow us to conduct a comprehensive head-to-head analysis comparing 


the cost of Invisalign against the cost of aligners printed by a typical third-party lab. 


With third-party 3D printing labs only just now entering the clear aligner industry in size, Spruce Point believes that this head-to-head 
comparison is similar to the kind of cost comparisons which will increasingly be conducted by orthodontists and dentists as third-party labs 


enter the mainstream.
Accordingly, we believe that this represents a cutting-edge analysis which details the pricing pressure soon to beset the industry.

Medical Equipment Or Commodity?
Third-Party Labs Upending Industry Economics


Spruce Point finds that the proliferation of third-party 3D printing labs capable of producing high-quality clear aligners is already beginning to 
reshape the economics of the aligner space. For a typical comprehensive clear aligner case consisting of a series of 44 total aligners covering 
both arches, doctors would pay over 50% less than Align’s list price by instead sourcing from Voodoo. Industry experts inform us that Voodoo 


and other third-party labs can offer prices as low as $10 or less per aligner, suggesting that doctor savings could be even more significant.

All-In Price per Aligner, Align ((J) / (44 Aligners)) $42.70 $42.70


Third-Part Lab Discount to Invisalign (Representative) 53% 65%


Until now, the price paid by the doctor for clear aligners has been dictated by dental device and equipment companies – Align in particular. 
However, with third-party 3D printing labs now inundating the space, dentists and orthodontists will increasingly be presented with opportunities to 


purchase aligners at prices set by producers of 3D printed commodities, which clear aligners themselves are now inevitably becoming.


Clear aligners are well on their way to becoming plastic commodities from a manufacturing perspective, not difficult-to-produce medical equipment.

Sourcing From Third-Party 3D Printing Labs 
Results In Substantial Cost Savings


Spruce Point finds that sourcing clear aligners from a third-party 3D printing lab rather than from Align results in significant cost savings for 
effectively all dentists and orthodontists, even after accounting for Align’s volume-based discounts. With third-party labs becoming increasingly 
accessible to doctors while offering similar-quality aligners, we believe that this represents the beginning of a seismic shift in the economics of 


the clear aligner industry – a space which, for nearly 20 years, featured almost no real competition. We believe that the proliferation of FDA-
approved third-party labs will inevitably put pressure on more traditional dental equipment providers – Align included – to slash aligner prices.

Case Study: Cost Savings From Align Alternatives A 
Material Benefit To Orthodontist Profitability


Our diligence into the cost structure of orthodontic offices allows us to evaluate the potential impact of Align alternatives on their bottom lines. 
Our findings: current Align customers could increase their cash flows by close to 10% by instead sourcing their aligners from a third-party lab. 


We believe that the magnitude of this potential cost savings will be too great for many orthodontic offices to ignore – something which the 
current pandemic-driven pause in business will allow (and encourage) them to evaluate.

Has Clarity (3M) been in your offices to discuss their clear aligner 
products and pricing?


Doctors Reveal That Pricing Pressure Is Already 
Coming To The Space


Dentists and orthodontists across the US tell us that the influx of competition is already beginning to weigh on industry pricing. Through a 
proprietary survey of high-volume orthodontists and conversations with a variety of dental professionals, we have learned that 3M is acting 


aggressively to win new business for its Clarity aligners by offering steep discounts. Of the 31 high-volume orthodontists included in our survey 
– a far different population than the more diverse groups covered most sell-side surveys, but one much more critical to the business – close to 
60% have had an in-office visit from 3M to discuss Clarity aligners. Our conversations reveal that 3M is offering lab fees as low as $500-600 per 
case, far below Align’s average lab fee – even among high-volume orthodontists receiving heavy discounts. Our survey also reveals that most 


orthodontists would consider Align alternatives if offered lab fees between $800-1,000, a threshold which 3M already appears to have surpassed.


Spruce Point believes that it is only a matter of time before Align is forced to slash its own lab fees to maintain its existing orthodontist base, 
or else risk losing significant case volume.


“3M is offering me cases at a $500 lab fee compared to 
my Invisalign Lab fee of $1,000. If I can start doing more 
cases with 3M and it will save me money, why not just 
switch? 3M software is excellent. It is very easy to use. 
They brought a lot of people over from Invisalign. It’s 
getting to the point where it will be as good as 
Invisalign.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“3M came to me and said that we can do all of your cases 
for $600… I expect my Invisalign volumes to be down 
going forward”

Not Just Hypothetical: Major DSOs Considering 3D 
Printing Centers, Both In-Sourced And Outsourced


Spruce Point emphasizes that, while 3D printing centers are relatively new to the clear aligner space, the threat which they pose is not merely 
hypothetical: high-volume buying groups are actively considering switching to them from Invisalign. Our diligence reveals that, just as third-party 
labs have become a realistic option for aligner sourcing among independent dentists & orthodontists, larger dental service organizations (DSOs) 


are exploring the possibility of setting up their own 3D printing labs to support their practices, as well as to support new revenue streams. In 
particular, we find that one DSO representing up to 12% of Align’s orthodontic case starts in the Americas is actively exploring 3D printing center 
opportunities. Given the low cost of setting up an FDA-compliant printing lab – less than $200K, per industry experts – these organizations, which 
can represent thousands of practices, would have little trouble establishing organization-wide printing centers, which could generate significant 


savings across a large number of practices. Industry experts confirm that DSO migration represents a major risk to Align’s case volumes.


“There is a 50% chance that we move away from Invisalign when our 
contract comes up in 2020 and for me to say that is a big deal. It's a 
really big deal. I personally have not been happy with the service for 
the last year and half.”


- Dentist, Top 10 DSO


“Invisalign case volume at DSOs is the biggest risk in the dentist 
channel. One big one that launches in house aligners and it is going 
to be a huge loss. If you have 1,000 practices in your DSO, each dentist 
could easily be doing 50 Invisalign cases a year, so with just one DSO, 
you could have 50,000 annual cases at risk.”


- Dentist, Top 10 DSO


“You can setup a clear aligner FDA approved lab in less than a year.
Your capital equipment costs between buying three [high-volume] 3D 
printers and thermoforming machines can be less than $100K to get 
started. If you add in labor, your total costs in your first year will be 
less than $200K.”

Barriers To In-House 3D Printing 
Collapsing

New Developments Poised To Make In-House 3D 
Printing A More Practical And Competitive Option


Until recently, orthodontists and dentists looking to print clear aligners in-house have had very few software options from which to choose. With 
Align having maintained such tight control of the clear aligner value chain for most of the last 20 years, and with in-house 3D printing still a 
relatively novel development, relatively little has been invested in third-party CAD/CAM software to support in-house clear aligner design. 


Importantly, Align also maintained a suite of patents over its CAD/CAM clear aligner software which began to expire only in 2017. Accordingly, 
3Shape – a platform which gets mixed reviews, per our conversations with orthodontists – has been perhaps the only practical CAD/CAM 


software option for users of in-house 3D printers.


Align bulls generally do not consider in-house 3D printing a serious threat to the Company. However, Spruce Point finds that historical 
limitations to in-house 3D printing have little to do with doctor preference, brand loyalty, or cost savings limitations, as is believed by most 
Align bulls. Spruce Point finds, rather, that they are largely the product of technological barriers which are now beginning to collapse with 


recent industry innovation.


Benefit Explanation


Reduce Turn-Around Time


• Waiting period between patient scan and aligner 
delivery slashed from several weeks to several 
minutes or hours


• Allows orthodontist/dentist to complete cases in 
less time and with fewer patient visits


Cost Savings
• Removing “middle-man” technician and 


outsourced printing services reduces overall cost 
of aligner cases


Case Control


• Gives orthodontist/dentist greater control over
aligner design and case planning rather than 
outsourcing to less-knowledgeable technician


• Allows orthodontist/dentist to redesign aligners 
mid-case as necessary and print immediately 
rather than wait 2-3 weeks for delivery

Align Bulls Are Mistaken About Orthodontist 
Attitudes Towards 3D Printing


Most Align bulls all but take for granted the notion that orthodontists and dentists view in-house 3D printing as an inevitable nuisance. They 
acknowledge recent innovation and price declines within the in-house 3D printing space, but are convinced that many orthodontists simply do 


not want to deal with the logistics of in-house printing. Our survey and conversations with high-volume orthodontists suggest otherwise. Spruce 
Point finds that, while just 6% of surveyed orthodontists currently own a 3D printer, over 50% plan on purchasing a 3D printer in the future – even 


with prevailing software not quite yet up to par with third-party CAD/CAM aligner design software. In particular, when asked what in particular 
would most likely convince them to allocate aligner cases to channels other than Align, the most popular answers given were the major selling 


points of in-house 3D printing: greater case control and more efficient case execution.


As in-house 3D printing grows increasingly mainstream, Spruce Point believes that the major selling points of in-house 3D printing will drive 
significant demand for this option.


Over 60% of respondents plan to 
use an in-house 3D printer to 


print clear aligners (or do already)


Biggest drivers behind desire to seek 
Align alternatives match major selling 


points of in-house 3D printing


“I now have the capability of providing same day treatment with clear 
aligners which I could not do with Invisalign. I would have to wait at 
least two weeks. With my own 3D printer, I can have aligners the same day 
and I can also alter an aligner case on the same day. This really helps my 
practice be more efficient throughout the patient’s treatment.”


- Orthodontist


“The difference between braces and Invisalign is if there is a change needed 
mid case. With Invisalign, I may need to wait 2-4 weeks to get a new aligners 
to continue the case. With braces, I can make the change immediately. With 
3D printing in your office, you have an aligner the same day which will 
make case management simpler.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“I know that when you are a new doctor, you get the worst Invisalign technicians

The Bottleneck To In-House 3D Printing Has Not 
Been Demand, But Workflow Infrastructure


Bulls are not wrong to think that, until now, in-house 3D printing has been relatively inconvenient in some respects. It would be inappropriate, 
however, to conclude from this that interest in 3D printing is low. Spruce Point finds just the opposite – that interest towards in-house 3D printing 


is extremely high, but that limitations to existing software options have tempered demand. With new players now developing innovative, high-
quality 3D printing software following the expiration of Align’s software patents, Spruce Point believes that orthodontists are now in a position to 
explore the possibility of shifting a portion of their aligner cases from Align to in-house 3D printing, if only as an exploratory measure. This could 
lead to an accelerated shift to 3D printing not long thereafter as orthodontists grow increasingly comfortable with in-house 3D printing workflows.


With one of the major bottlenecks preventing more widespread in-house 3D printing demand now gone with the expiration of key Align 
patents and the development of new software, Spruce Point believes that the cost savings and workflow efficiency offered by in-house 


printing will trigger a new wave of demand for 3D printers among orthodontists, posing a significant threat to Align’s case volumes.


“In the future, we are going to see a change where a company is 
going to develop software that is so easy to use where I will 
pay a monthly fee and then I will be able to print the aligners 
in my office. We are not that far away from that. It is coming.”

Expired Patents Open The Door For Innovation 
Which Will Break The Barrier To In-House 3D Printing


With many of Align’s key CAD/CAM software patents having rolled off from 2018-20, Spruce Point observes that new, innovative companies are 
beginning to disrupt what has been one of the major barriers to widespread 3D printer adoption among orthodontists. With demand for in-house 
3D printing options high among orthodontists, and with Align’s CEO having effectively admitted that third-party CAD/CAM software limitations 
were one of the major choke points to more intense competition in the space, we expect the proliferation of new software options to catalyze 


more intense clear aligner competition in the form of 3D printing infrastructure.


“Yes, remember, we -- you could arguably say we had 10 to 15 key patents burn off at the last -- last part of last year and I call 
those CAD/CAM patents which means you could design something on a computer screen and then 3D print it and that's

New Software Overcomes Many Of The 
Shortcomings Of In-House 3D Printing


Spruce Point believes that the recent emergence of uLab Systems – a relatively little-known developer of aligner CAD/CAM software – represents 
a major step towards making in-house 3D printing a practical option for a broad range of doctors. Much as Zendura’s newest aligner material was 


created by Align’s original plastics supplier, uLab was created by former Align technology and sales executives with close knowledge of the 
aligner software market, and a strong understanding of where current 3D printing software is coming up short. These same individuals launched 


a similar competitive bid against Align in the early 2000s in the form of OrthoClear – a bid so threatening that, when they settled their litigation 
with Align by having Align buy them out in Sep 2006, Align’s share price immediately more than doubled.

With Align’s software patents now having largely expired, uLab represents the first new user-friendly CAD/CAM software offering in years.


“What we created 22 years ago [at Align Technologies took] control from the 
orthodontists and clinicians to do the treatment planning because a lot of things 
were unknown back then…. We didn’t have the computational power that is 
available to us today. We didn’t have intraoral scanning, the 3D printing was not in 
a state it is in today… The system that was designed in such a way that it was a 
centralized model that was highly controlled by the manufacturer. And like anything 
else, as businesses grow and scale, their legacy issue is that they keep the 
same architecture. About 4 years ago, we looked at the state of the 
technology and no one [was] breaking the mold and coming up with new 
ideas of how to do clear aligners differently and that is how uLab was born.”

Industry Sources Confirm That uLab Is Helping To 
Clear The Way For Broader 3D Printing Adoption


Industry sources confirm that CAD/CAM software limitations have been among the most significant barriers to broader in-house 3D printer 
adoption – and that developments by uLab are helping to reduce these barriers.

uLab Making Quick Inroads Among Doctors 
And Venture Capital


Just as did OrthoClear ~15 years ago, uLab is making quick inroads among orthodontists. It already has 250 doctors trained on its system and 
65,000 annual cases since early 2019 – all accomplished with just three salesmen – and orthodontists with whom we spoke indicate that the 


waitlist for the software is long ahead of its planned full-scale launch in May 2020. Dental professionals confirm that the platform represents a 
material improvement over legacy 3D printing software, and that it supports treatments which legacy platforms could not – “combo cases” in 


particular, which involve the patient wearing traditional braces instead of clear aligners at various points throughout the treatment. Between its 
quick uptake among doctors and demonstrated ability to attract institutional capital, uLab appears to represent a meaningful step forward in a 


clear aligner software space which has seen relatively little development through much of the 2010s.


With the aligner printing software space finally attracting innovators which are addressing historical shortcomings among in-house 3D printing 
software, Spruce Point believes that one of the major bottlenecks prohibiting more widespread in-house aligner printing is set to collapse.


We believe that enlarged interest with in-house 3D printing among doctors will quickly follow from uLab’s impending broad-scale launch.

Rapid Uptake A Sign Of Things To Come?


Importantly, we observe that uptake of uLab’s software has been swift even during its limited launch period – again, despite the fact that it had 
just three sales representatives through early 2020. Again, since early Jan 2019, orthodontists have already conducted 65,000 cases using uLab 
software, and the Company is expected to have 600 dental practitioners on its platform by the end of 2020. Given the pace of uLab’s uptake and 


our conversations with industry experts, we anticipate that uLab could have as many as 1,000 doctors on its platform by the end of 2021, and 
could reach an annual case count of 175,000.

In-House 3D Printing Offers Overwhelming 
Cost Savings On Case-By-Case Basis


Spruce Point observes that the cost savings made possible by printing aligners in-house are overwhelming, even when compared against third-
party 3D printing labs. Printing aligners in-house allows dentists and orthodontists to save over 75% versus Align on a per-case basis. This on 


top of the fact that in-house printing gives the orthodontist greater control over the case, allows him/her to complete the treatment with 
substantially fewer patient visits, and can be faster and easier than designing an aligner remotely with an outsourced technician (10 minutes vs. 


30 minutes when done with the right software, per our conversations with doctors).

Clear Aligner Case Economics Example:
Comprehensive Case with 44 Aligners (Covering Both Arches)


“My material costs per aligner are about 
$5 to $6 and when I factor in labor, I am 
printing aligners for approximately $10. 
As my staff gets more efficient, the cost 
will go lower. 3D printers are getting 
faster and cheaper as well, so a new 
investment there will eventually lower the 
cost as well.”


- Orthodontist

In-House 3D Printing Offers Substantial
Cost Savings


Spruce Point finds that, for large-volume orthodontists, printing in-house could produce over 50% more savings over Align compared to sourcing 
from third-party labs, and would allow most orthodontists even of lesser tiers to save over 60% compared to Align fees themselves. We estimate 
that the option to switch to in-house printing presents the average Diamond Plus Align customer with a $400K per year cost savings opportunity. 
We believe that, as in-house 3D printing grows increasingly mainstream with improvements in printer and software technology, printing in-house 
could well become a no-brainer option for a large share of the orthodontist population. Align would inevitably be forced to cut prices dramatically 


or otherwise suffer serious case volume losses among its highest-volume customers.

Case Study: Cost Savings From Align Alternatives A 
Material Benefit To Orthodontist Profitability


By once again analyzing the cost structure of orthodontic offices, we find that in-house 3D printing offers even greater savings than do third-
party labs: current Align customers could increase their cash flows by over 12% by printing aligners in-house. Again, we believe that the 


magnitude of this potential cost savings will be too great for many orthodontic offices to ignore – something which the current pandemic-driven 
pause in business will allow (and encourage) them to evaluate.

In-House 3D Printing Creating Revenue 
Opportunities?


Spruce Point finds that a number of clear aligner printing early-adopters among orthodontists and dentists have managed to turn their in-house 
3D printers into sources of revenue by offering to print clear aligners for other local practices. Opportunities to generate revenue through in-


house 3D printing would only make the economic benefits of switching from Invisalign to in-house printers even more overwhelming. 
Furthermore, that individual dentists could effectively serve as third-party printing labs for other local practices reinforces the threat posed by 


third-party 3D printing to Align: the barriers to entry in third-party printing appear so low that individual practices could explore the opportunity, if 
only on a local scale.

Opening User-Friendly Software To Multiple 
Workflows Only Creates More Alternatives To Align


Spruce Point finds that, in Feb 2020, uLab received FDA approval to print its own clear aligners. This helps to confirm other sources which 
suggested to us that uLab is on the verge of opening its own outsourced 3D printing lab. We believe that this development represents yet another 
step towards the general easing of clear aligner sourcing: orthodontists and dentists will be able to use uLab’s well-regarded software to design 


aligners to be printed in-house or by a third-party lab. As more and more third-party labs, printers, and aligner design software options are 
introduced to the market, doctors will have a wide variety of ways to organize their respective workflows in whichever manner is easiest and most 


user-friendly for them. This will only encourage greater doctor migration away from Align.


“In the next few months, uLab is also going to offer their own lab to print 
aligners. So you can use uLab software to design a case and print in your 
office or send it out to them.”


- Orthodontist


uLab: FDA 510(k) Premarket Notification Approval For Clear Aligner System


As low-cost workflow options grow increasingly diverse and easier-to-use, we expect more and more Align doctors to explore alternatives to 
Invisalign.

Align’s Purported Moat Is 
Overblown And Eroding
57


Bulls Have An Unrealistically Rosy View Of 
Orthodontists’ Relationship With Align


It’s common for Align bulls to reference the Company’s dentist/orthodontist base as an important protection against the expanding competitive 
landscape. This, combined with a twenty-year head start on clear aligner IP and strong retail brand recognition, supposedly give Align a powerful 
moat against both direct-to-consumer and doctor-directed players. As discussed, Spruce Point finds that Align’s IP advantage is quickly eroding 


with the introduction of new third-party plastics and software. Importantly, we also find that the strength of its practitioner network is, in our 
opinion, vastly overstated: across nearly every call that we conducted with high-volume orthodontists, we found practitioner attitudes to be chilly 


at best, and more commonly openly disdainful.


Competitive
Advantage


Investor Perception Spruce Point Findings


Brand Recognition


• Customers shop for Invisalign in particular 
– not just clear aligners more generally –
and seek out dental practitioners who 
offer Align Products


• Patients generally do not shop for 
Invisalign in particular, and, even then, 
will trust their practitioners if they suggest 
a different provider


Practitioner Network


• Offering Invisalign allows a 
dentist/orthodontist to remain on Align’s 
practitioner directory, which can generate 
leads


• Most individuals will seek advice from 
their own dentist or orthodontist about 
clear aligners rather than seek out an 
entirely new practitioner for the sole 
purpose of inquiring about Invisalign


Practitioner Loyalty


• Dentists and orthodontists appreciate 
Align as a lead-generating brand, and are 
incentivized to sell as much Invisalign as 
possible to achieve Align’s volume-based 
discounts


• Dentists and orthodontists generally see 
Align as an unfriendly business partner 
and are actively looking for alternatives
58


Orthodontists And Dentists Pinched In The 
Pocket Book By Align


Dental practitioners with whom we spoke told us that Align is an outlier in the orthodontics industry today: while costs for dental equipment are 
coming down almost across the board, Align continues to raise prices on its orthodontists and dentists. This has angered many of Align’s clients 


– high-volume offices included – and has motivated many of them to more actively seek out alternatives. Spruce Point believes that this trend 
may accelerate as the space continues to be inundated by new, lower-cost competitors, which will likely put downward pressure on the price to 


the end customer and squeeze orthodontist margins. Several orthodontists report that this is already happening.


Despite the recent influx of competition in the space, Align appears to continue to behave as a monopolistic player in the doctor-directed 
clear aligner market. Spruce Point believes that industry pushback – given more leverage by the recent proliferation of new competitive 


alternatives – will inevitably force Align to stop forcing price increases on its customers, lest it lose significant case volume.


“The cost of orthodontics is coming down across the board. The 
demand for orthodontic treatment is growing but the suppliers is 
growing exponentially, so costs again are going to come down. 
So we are going to see an absolute decrease in the cost of 
treatment. This is the problem with Invisalign, they keep 
raising their fees every year. This is opposite of the rest of 
the market. I am getting squeezed by Invisalign, I am 
charging less for it and they keep raising their prices…”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“Align has been so arrogant over the last three to five years. 
They raise prices every summer and have done it every 
summer. If they don't adjust their prices, they are going to 
see major market share erosion.”


- Senior Employee, Major Dental Equipment Supplier


“I don't think the customer really cares which clear aligner 
treatment they are getting.”


- Dentist, DSO


“From a patient perspective, they are relatively impartial to the 
brand of clear aligner. If the doctor recommends Clarity or 
ClearCorrect, the patient is not going to care.”


- Dentist, DSO


Orthodontists Upset By Align Price Hikes… …And Do Not Feel That Align Generates Leads For Them


…so why remain a user of Align?
59


Less Of A Partner, More Of A Sales 
Organization


Many dentists and orthodontists report a high level of dissatisfaction with Align’s business practices. Notably, Align recently announced that, for 
US dental practitioners, third-party intra-oral scanners would no longer be compatible with Align’s software, forcing them to purchase its own 


proprietary iTero scanners in order to continue to offer Invisalign.


“I bought 3 Trios wireless scanners…. I am very angry with 
Align that they will fight a legal battle over the backs of 
their customers. I have invested more than $150K in Trios 
scanners and then from one day to the next they may say to 
me, ‘I am sorry, you can not use your scanner to submit 
cases that way.’”


- Orthodontist (Ex-US)


“There is a 50% chance that we move away from Invisalign 
when our contract comes up in 2020 and for me to say that 
is a big deal. It's a really big deal. I personally have not been 
happy with the service for the last year and half.”


- Dentist, Top 10 DSO


“Clear aligners cases will go up in my practice, but 
Invisalign will not…. Invisalign is the evil empire.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“I hate Invisalign. I think they are the worst company in the 
world to deal with. I philosophically hate what Invisalign has 
turned my practice into…. I am sick and tired of Invisalign 
taking my information and using it against me. You don’t see 
3M or Ormco doing that… Invisalign is not a company that I 
am partnered with. They are not going to help me. It is 
simply a product that I am going to buy and eventually I 
will move to a competitor. I have no loyalty to Invisalign…. 
It is just a matter of time that I move as much of my case 
volume as possible away from Invisalign.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“It would be the best thing to come out of this [pandemic]. 
Invisalign getting f*cked.”

Sacrificing Customer Relationships In Pursuit 
Of Growth?


Most Align bulls do not see SmileDirectClub and other DTC aligner providers as a direct threat to Align, as Invisalign is generally used to treat 
more complex cases for which DTC aligners would not be appropriate. Dentists and orthodontists are nonetheless unhappy about the fact that 


potential patients can now seek out teeth-straightening devices without having to go through them. The fact that, until recently, Align was a major 
investor in – and supplier of – SmileDirectClub angered many of the dentists and orthodontists with whom we spoke. Similarly, many 


orthodontists are upset that Align has made its teeth-alignment treatments available to the dentist channel: what was historically a source of 
referrals for teeth alignments is now a source of competition. Again, bulls see this move as primarily “market-expanding” – e.g. as providing teeth 


alignment options to a population which would have never consulted an orthodontist about braces in the first place – but orthodontists 
nonetheless feel slighted by Align for its decision to open up its services more broadly.


“I expect my Invisalign volumes to be down going forward. Direct 
to Consumer offerings are taking business away from us.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“Invisalign has diluted the orthodontic industry. They took 
away our exclusivity. The damage is done now…. We just don’t 
trust Invisalign…. It is just a matter of time that I move as much 
of my case volume as possible away from Invisalign.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


“If I had to guess 30% to 40% of SDC cases are cases that would 
have gone to Invisalign if the DTC option was not available.”

Changing Risk Factors Reveal 
Acknowledgment of Competitive Threats?


Recent changes to Align’s risk factor on competition suggest that management views the recent influx of new competitors as a material threat to 
the business. Spruce Point believes that its decision to expand this risk factor may reveal that Align already sees pricing pressure and customer 


losses as orthodontists begin to push back against Align. We strongly believe that pushback will only grow more intense as orthodontists 
become increasingly aware of and comfortable with the current alternatives to Align.

Management Not Transparent About Exposure 
To Competitive Threats


Spruce Point believes that Company disclosures are contributing to a broad misunderstanding of the share of Align cases for which other players 
can effectively compete. Management disclosures implying that its mix of comprehensive to non-comprehensive cases is ~75 / 25 suggest that a 


large share of its case load is complex in nature, including advanced cases such as mandibular advancement and treatments for anterior 
intrusion which competitors cannot yet address. However, our conversations with industry experts reveal that, at most, just 50% of Align’s 


comprehensive cases are aligner / wire “combo cases” that cannot be addressed by competitors, implying that just ~35% of Align cases can be 
conducted only by Align. The remaining ~65% “more typical” cases are exposed to competition among players capable of providing similar or 


precisely the same treatments. uLab’s ability to support such combo cases, which are planned to begin with wire braces before switching to clear 
aligners, will only reduce the share of cases which be addressed only by Align


Bulls frequently argue that Align’s multi-year IP head start protects it from competition from newer players. Spruce Point finds that the vast 
majority of Align’s cases can be addressed by competing products and, as such, are exposed to competition.

The Growth Runway Is Not As Smooth As The 
Bulls Think


Align bulls have grown accustomed to being warned about the threat of new competitors since the major dental equipment suppliers began to 
enter the aligner space in the mid-2010s. Those who have remained in the stock throughout have generally done so on their faith in the magnitude 
of the clear aligner TAM: management cites that, between aligners and wire braces, 12M teeth alignment cases are initiated each year worldwide –
8.4M of which Invisalign can address – of which Align captures just 1.5M as of FY19. Meanwhile, management claims that another 300M globally 
are candidates for more minor alignment treatments from dentists. Spruce Point, however, believes that bulls have far too naïve a view of Align’s 


market opportunity, and that they overlook material barriers which will make it difficult for the Company to expand into both sub-markets.

Uncomplicated Cases A Prime Target For Low-
Cost Competition


Management claims that, as clear aligners grow increasingly mainstream, individuals who wouldn’t have otherwise been candidates for dental 
alignment procedures – put off by the aesthetics of traditional wire braces – may begin to migrate to clear aligners. However, this market is also 


ripe for low-cost competitors – particularly DTC players such as SmileDirectClub, which allow teeth alignment candidates to obtain treatment 
without having to make frequent visits to the dentist/orthodontist, and, indeed, without having to consult a dental professional at all. It is also a 
prime target for other, lower-cost clear aligner providers among the large dental equipment suppliers, as well as third-party printing labs which 


offer aligners at a fraction of the cost of Invisalign.


To the extent that Align is able to penetrate the non-comprehensive market and/or expand its addressable patient base, Spruce Point 
believes that it will experience dramatic price compression.


ALGN: Robert W. Baird Global Healthcare Conference (Sep 4, 2019)


“We're really going to try to continue to grow our market. 75% of our market is comprehensive…. That really 
mostly addresses that 12 million TAM that we talked about, but 25% of our portfolio is non-comprehensive. 
That's growing very fast, in part because it's going after these 300 million consumers.”


- John Morici – CFO, Align Technology


“Yes. And over the last year or two, one thing we've worried about/thought about with your business is, 
SmileDirect does create demand…. Again, the 25-year-old maybe doesn't even think to go into the 
dentist's office. They just want to do it online…. But one thing we've worried about is that 40-year-old 
parent goes into the office and the doctor says, "Oh yes, I can do that, $6,000, write me a check and we're 
done," versus $1,895 or whatever SmileDirect is. So are you seeing your doctors understand that they 
need to reprice, reset their pricing policies or how they charge patients? Because it seems like to me 
orthodontics, GP's doing orthodontics, has been one of the wild, wild wests out there where they can charge 
anything they damn well want because it's a cash paid business. Now they finally have a regulator there. 
They have a governor there that's going to say ‘No, no, no, market's going to tell you that you're really 
only valued at $2,000 or something.’ Are the dentists getting that message? Are they starting to maybe 
not price match but at least become more price competitive?”


- Jeffrey Johnson – Analyst, Robert W. Baird


“Yes. Many doctors are realizing that those patients or potential patients are coming in and price 
shopping. They have an idea that maybe it should cost them $2,000, you're right for if it's an easier 
movement, don't need a lot of aligners to be able to move their teeth in the right way, maybe they shouldn't 
be charging $5,000 or $6,000. And I think those doctors who kind of get that, get that the market is 
shifting in front of them, will charge something that if you're sub $3,000, ideally $2,500, then the 
comparison between some of the others is less….”

Orthodontic Channel Growth In Americas Choked Off 
By Saturation Among US Orthodontists


Align bulls claim that, despite the growing congestion in the dental and DTC channels, Align remains the leader in the orthodontic channel 
(particularly among comprehensive cases) due to its 20-year head-start on clear aligner technology. We have disputed Align’s purported 


technological advantages at other points throughout this report. However, even then, the one channel in which it may be able to resist aggressive 
competition and pricing pressure offers a far more limited window for growth. Based on management’s claims regarding the expansion of its 


doctor base, orthodontic utilization rates, and orthodontic case growth, Spruce Point estimates that Align currently serves ~8,000 North American 
orthodontists, leaving little room for further growth among the total market of ~10,500 orthodontists in North America. Meanwhile, the 


proliferation of alternative aligner providers could result in losses among its orthodontist base while pressuring orthodontist utilization.

North America Growth Opportunity: Orthodontist Penetration vs. Dentist Penetration
(Spruce Point Estimates)


With some orthodontists perhaps not interested in offering clear aligner treatment (at least in high volume), how much runway really remains in 
the North American orthodontic channel? Spruce Point believes that Align’s saturation of this channel could slow the pace of case volume 


growth, while more aggressive competition threatens to increase orthodontist churn and pressure utilization.

Changing Disclosures Obfuscate
Growth Headwinds


Spruce Point observes that changes in management disclosures have obscured a number of the aforementioned barriers to Align’s continued 
growth into its purported addressable market. After FY13, management stopped disclosing its North American doctor breakout between 


orthodontists and dentists, making it more difficult for investors to observe Align’s increasing saturation of this channel through the ensuing 
years. Further, it stopped disclosing its case breakout by product level, obscuring its gradual shift towards lower-complexity cases as dentists 


represent an increasingly large share of the Company’s case mix. We also note that, in FY18, management redefined its “North America” segment 
to “Americas,” and recategorized its South American markets into this segment, improving growth in this key category by an estimated 2%.

TAM-Driven Argument For Future Case Growth 
Undermined By Emerging Threats


Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sell side anticipated top-line growth of approximately 20% in FY20 and beyond for Align, on long-term case 
growth of 20-30% per year. However, with the North American orthodontist channel increasingly saturated for Align, and with overwhelming 


competition coming to the dental, orthodontic, and all international channels, we believe that total case growth could revert to a run-rate level of 
just over 10% in the near-to-medium term. With Align likely to experience powerful pricing pressure from the onset of new competition at the 


same time, run-rate revenue growth could collapse to mid-single-digit levels – a tremendous drop-off from consensus estimates of ~20% long-
term annual growth.

Pandemic Poses Unprecedented 
And Underappreciated Risk To The 
Business
70


Dental Practices Shut Down In Response To 
Pandemic – But Risks Could Linger On


Orthodontic and dental offices have been effectively shut down across the US and abroad as the world continues to cope with the COVID-19 
pandemic. ALGN shares have effectively traded in-line with the market as investors continue to bet on when the world begins to return to normal. 
However, Spruce Point believes that – while, to date, most offices have announced closures only through April or May – Align is put at particular 


risk by the ongoing pandemic, and that investors have not yet properly taken the associated near-to-medium term risks into account.
71


When Will “The Most Elective Of Procedures” 
Return?


Paralleling the broader medical community, dental oversight and regulatory boards have issued recommendations that dental practices postpone 
all elective procedures for the foreseeable future, with most states barring them outright for the foreseeable future. As one dental practitioner said 


to us, “there is nothing more elective than orthodontics” – particularly a procedure which, in most cases, is cosmetic. While public sentiment 
continues to swing back and forth on when restrictions on public activity may be lifted, Spruce Point believes that cosmetic orthodontics may be 


among the last businesses to “return to normal” following the current crisis – particularly if the disease continues to linger into the future, in 
which case medical equipment may continue to be reserved for emergency purposes.

Recommends Indefinite Postponement of Elective Procedures…


…And State Governments Are Banning Elective Dental 
Procedures Outright And Indefinitely


“There is nothing more elective than orthodontics.”
- Dental Practitioner


…especially a cosmetic treatment like clear aligners!


We are already closing in on some of the first proposed return dates in early/mid-April with no end in sight as to the public health crisis. That the 
initial return dates were so unreasonably optimistic only highlights the industry’s uncertainty as to when it might be able to return to business 


as usual. Spruce Point believes that investors should expect projected return dates to continue to be delayed for the foreseeable future.
72


Dental And Orthodontic Offices Could Be A 
Major Health Hazard In The COVID-19 Era


Regardless of when local and national governments begin to lift restrictions, experts agree that we may continue to see new cases of COVID-19 
for a year or more. Even if the disease were to become less virulent over time, Spruce Point anticipates that consumers could be reluctant to 


undergo dental procedures for an extended period of time – particularly elective cosmetic procedures. Dental tools can create aerosols within a 
patient’s mouth which spray mucous and saliva into the surrounding environment, exposing anyone in the immediate vicinity to the potential for 
infection by an unknowingly-contagious dental patient. We believe that lingering stigma around entering such environments could slow dental 
office activity for months into the future, given that the disease itself is not expected to disappear until later this year at the absolute earliest.

If The Disease Persists In Any Scale, When Will 
People Feel Comfortable Returning To The Dentist?


Of late, ALGN shares have traded up on broader market optimism that the economy could begin to return to normal sooner than expected. 
However, investors should bear in mind that not all industries will return on the same schedule – and orthodontics and dentistry could be among 


the most significant laggards. Over the coming months, consumers may gradually grow more comfortable returning to retail stores and other 
public places, but will they be comfortable returning to a setting in which aerosols are spraying mucous in the open air? Spruce Point believes 


that, for as long as new cases of COVID-19 continue to arise – which could last well beyond the first signs of a broader return to normalcy – there 
could be a powerful stigma against returning to dental and orthodontic offices, particularly for elective and cosmetic procedures. Unfortunately, 


some of the most credible studies on the likely trajectory of the pandemic – including the Imperial College London (ICL) study which most 
western nations are using to inform their action plans – predict that the disease could continue to linger for at least another 18 months at least.


If the disease itself does not dissipate for another 18 months – regardless of when retail, transportation, and other sectors begin to return to 
normal – will people really be willing to return to the orthodontist for an elective procedure?

Prime Opportunity For Dental Practitioners To 
Review Expenses


The current uncertainty surrounding the dental industry notwithstanding, the current pause in business presents dental practitioners with a 
unique opportunity to review their expenses and evaluate cost-saving alternatives – particularly amidst an environment in which dentists are 


likely to see very limited revenue for a period of time. Several dentists and orthodontists have told us that they are using their time off to do just 
this. Align may be at particular risk of losing younger orthodontists with newer practices, many of whom carry significant loans – both student 


and business – and who, per our conversations, are likely the most comfortable switching to newer software and 3D printing technologies. 
Accordingly, we believe that the current crisis – however short-term in nature – could have lasting longer-term consequences for Align by 


accelerating the shift to competing aligner alternatives.


“The whole industry is being encouraged during this 
time to re-examine their expenditures and work flow 
efficiencies.”


- Dentist


With new, low-cost competitors having only recently entered the clear aligner space, and with in-house 3D printing becoming increasingly 
economical, we believe that the current pause in business presents a uniquely ominous threat to Align. Not only could case volumes be slashed 


to near-zero in the near term, but long-time orthodontic customers may be given an opportunity to evaluate a newly-evolved competitive 
landscape with whose offerings they have yet to fully understand – and they may be forced to opt for an alternative out of necessity.


“I talk to between 5-15 dentists a day, and they are 
greatly reducing their Invisalign numbers. For those 
dentists that are not yet switching, they are thinking 
about it.”


- Dental Consultant


“The biggest risk to Invisalign is the core base of users are looking for 
alternatives. There are study clubs in my area that are called 
‘Invisalign alternative study clubs,” meaning you have a roomful of 
30-40 of the heaviest hitter orthodontists in [region redacted] come 
together every 2-3 months to sit there and talk about other 
companies other than Invisalign that you can use.”


- Orthodontist, Diamond Plus Align Tier


Now could be a convenient time for them to think through 
these alternatives more seriously…


“The younger to midcareer guys, a lot of them are 
switching away from Invisalign.”


- Dentist, DSO


“The orthodontists coming out of school are more in debt 
than ever in the history of the profession. They are very 
tech savvy. If they know that they can save money, 
they will.”

ALGN: Shares Held By Insiders


Management Trimming Exposure As 
Competition Mounts And Results Falter


Spruce Point observes that, just as Align’s performance has begun to deteriorate with the emergence of new competition, insiders have steadily 
and consistently trimmed their exposure to the stock. Today, insiders own just over 1% of outstanding shares. Meanwhile, the Company has 
expanded its buyback from just under $100M in FY14 to $400M in FY19. Spruce Point frequently sees insider selling paired with accelerated 
buybacks among companies under increasing strain. We worry that this is a signal that Align’s insiders are heading for the exits ahead of 


renewed pressures with an explosion of new competitors.

Ill-Timed Acquisition Raises Concerns 
Regarding Remaining Growth Runway


On March 4, Align spent €376 ($419) – half of its available cash – to purchase exocad Global Holdings, GmbH, a producer of dental CAD/CAM 
software. Spruce Point finds it curious that a business such as Align – which, given its early communication to investors about the impact of 


coronavirus in China, was well-aware of the threat that COVID-19 could pose to sales in a given geography – would decide to make such a 
significant non-earnings accretive acquisition at 24x TTM sales just as it enters a period of extreme uncertainty and risk to forward performance. 


Management claimed that the goal of the acquisition was to sell more clear aligners by integrating Align more closely with GP dentists, but 
experts with whom we spoke are skeptical that it will gain traction.


Why was management not transparent about exocad’s sales 
growth trajectory?


“If you're not familiar with exocad, they're a 10-
year-old innovative software company based in 
Darmstadt, Germany, growing approximately 
20% annually.”


- Joseph Hogan – Align Technology, CEO
10% YoY Growth


“The overall trend that we're really addressing here, Steve, is a whole idea of digital dentistry and how 
dentists are really reaching out, whether they reach out to their lab partners, whether they reach out 
to customers or whatever, they're looking for that digital platform that we're talking about. And that 
digital platform, it has to be broad and wide when you're -- we're a basic GP…. this is all about how in 
the future we sell more clear aligners and how we sell more clear aligners through these specific 
channels. And we think that this deal really helps us to facilitate that in the future.”


- Joseph Hogan – Align Technology, CEO


“Trying to make it smoother to integrate Invisalign 
with dentists restorative treatment. And get more 
involved with the restorative nuts and bolts. It’s a 
risky play I think with all the other restorative 
platforms with scanning and milling.”

exocad Justification: Align Management vs. Independent Orthodontist


Management Deceptive About exocad Performance?


Spruce Point is concerned that management is overspending on M&A in order to support growth as competition from both doctor-directed and 
DTC players makes it harder for Align to grow into the remaining dental channel TAM.

Playing Games With EPS Just As Competitive 
Forces Accelerate


In FY19, management added stock-based compensation back to its Non-GAAP Net Income figure for the first time. Spruce Point estimates that 
this added $0.86 to FY19 Non-GAAP EPS, boosting management’s reported EPS figure by a significant 16.7%. We find it concerning that 


management would choose to take this new, large add back to EPS just as the clear aligner competitive landscape grows increasingly crowded.


($, Thousands, except share data) FY19


(A) Net Income, GAAP $442,776


(B) Stock-Based Compensation 88,184


(C) Impairments and Other (Gains) Charges 22,990

SBC Benefit to Non-GAAP EPS, %  ((L) / (M)) 16.7%


Stock-Based Compensation Add-Back Benefit to Non-GAAP EPS


Spruce Point does not believe that this 
significant Non-GAAP add back is justified, and 


finds it concerning that management would 
choose to include it in Non-GAAP EPS just as it 


begins to face an increasingly threatening 
competitive landscape

How Bad Could The Coming Quarter Be?


While it is no secret that Q2 will be a historically bad quarter for many companies and sectors, Spruce Point believes that investors are not fully 
prepared for the likely near-term impact of the pandemic on Align. Many official practice notices indicate discuss closures only through the end of 


April, but our diligence – confirmed by a call with Invisalign sales – reveals that most plan to remain closed through late May / early June. Even 
then, we anticipate that new cases will be sparse immediately upon their return for at least several weeks. This suggests that Q2 FY20 EPS could 


be down significantly even in an optimistic scenario in which dental practitioners return in mid-May – an aggressive timetable at this point.

Volumes Could Be Down Substantially Due To 
The Impact Of The Pandemic


To date, sell-side estimates have generally been revised only very conservatively in response to the ongoing pandemic, and there remains a great 
deal of uncertainty about the near-term future for Align. Spruce Point believes that, with elective procedures delayed for the indefinite future, and 


given the potential stigma that may surround dental offices over the coming months, Align could see US and international cases decline by 
anywhere between 20-60% year-over-year in Q2 and remain down between 20-30% for the remainder of the year.

In light of the prevailing restrictions on 
non-emergency dental activity and 


expert predictions which indicate that 
the coronavirus may linger for months 
into the future, Spruce Point believes 


that it is not outlandish to believe that, 
not only could US volumes collapse to 
near-zero in Q2, but that volumes may 
remain heavily depressed through the 


remainder of the year.


An elective, discretionary, cosmetic 
procedure is unlikely to experience a 


rapid recovery as the economic 
consequences of the pandemic grow.

Not A Bounce-Back Candidate: Spruce Point Sees 
40%-55% Downside To $80-$115 Per Share


As ALGN shares trade lower with the market as the pandemic grows increasingly drawn-out, bulls with faith in the long-term growth story likely 
see the stock as a strong “buy low” opportunity. Spruce Point strongly disagrees: not only does Align bear outsized risk to the continued 
prevalence of COVID-19 beyond 2020, but the proliferation of competitors and alternative aligner printing technologies will, in our opinion, 


prevent the Company from bouncing back with the same force as the rest of the dental/orthodontic space.

Survey Methodology: Focus On High-Volume Users 
Allows Us To Capture Trends Among Align’s Largest, 
Most Important Customers


As part of our diligence, Spruce Point surveyed 31 dental practitioners who use administer Invisalign clear aligners in their practices. Importantly 
– and unlike most sell-side surveys – our survey targeted only high-volume users, with no participant administering fewer than 100 case starts in 


2019 (participant average of 182), or qualifying for anything lower than Align’s Diamond-tier discount. We believe that, by surveying only high-
volume users, our analysis captures the behavior and sentiment of dental practitioners whose buying patterns will be most material to Align’s 
performance going forward. We also believe that the behavior and sentiment shown in their responses reflects the early impact of emerging 


competitive threats, which are likely to emerge first among higher-volume users.
