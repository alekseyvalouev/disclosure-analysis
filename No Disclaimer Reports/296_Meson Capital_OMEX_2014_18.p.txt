5/21/2018 Muddy Waters Reaction to Olam Frantic Response - Muddy Waters Research

To Olam CEO Sunny Verghese and the Board of Directors:


In the two and one-half years Muddy Waters, LLC has been openly
criticizing publicly-traded companies, we have not seen a response
as defensive as yours – not even from Sino-Forest. On Monday, our
Director of Research gave a brief talk on Olam at a well-respected
charity event. He presented facts about Olam along with Muddy
Waters’s opinion that Olam is at risk of collapsing due to multiple
factors, including its debt load. As Olam has since said, his
comments were not overly substantive. But based on this alone,
Olam halted its stock, scheduled two conference calls, discussed
buying back shares, and issued statements that included saying it is
not a “�y-by-night company”. It has further evidenced a bizarre
�xation on baseball caps.


Olam’s disproportionate reaction is extraordinary in our experience.
Should Olam come to collapse (as we believe it will), its use of
much-needed cash to buy back shares at this time should give rise
to questions about whether �duciary responsibilities have been
breached – particularly given the possible existence of individual
motivations that are not necessarily aligned with those of Olam’s
lenders. We also note Olam’s attempts to impugn our credibility.


You and your investors should note that attempting to silence critics
is not a plan of corrective action. In no way does it make Olam
stronger. The February 2011 CLSA report, which raised far fewer

concerns than we have identi�ed internally, and that Olam itself
made so controversial, should have caused you to work toward
repairing what ails your business and your balance sheet. Instead,
Olam has since increased its a) debt load by approximately S$900
million, b) cumulative investment cash burn by approximately S$2
billion, and c) cumulative operating cash burn by approximately
S$500 million. In other words, you did the exact opposite of what you
should have done. Your actions have been an abject failure of
leadership.


Companies that attack criticism the way Olam does fail to
understand that raising money from the public is a privilege.
Because Olam has received signi�cant investment from the
government of Singapore, Olam’s mismanagement of the public trust
is that much less forgivable. Know this: You voluntarily came to the
market, you subjected yourselves to its forces, and you must bear
the consequences of your ineptitude.


We do not work for an investment bank, and cannot be bullied the
way other analysts can. Our research into Olam has been exhaustive,
and we plan to resolutely stand by it regardless of any attempts you
might make to discredit it or us.


We therefore suggest you �nd better uses of your time than focusing
on criticism. For instance, you might want to work on plans to reign
in your CapEx and de-leverage. The clock is likely ticking.


Warmest Regards, 
Muddy Waters, LLC
