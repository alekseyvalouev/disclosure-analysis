Exact Sciences - The Rotten Sniff Test (1 Of 5)
Jul. 24, 2013 1:21 PM ET117 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) (EXAS or the "Company") is the Wisconsin-based
company behind the overhyped soon to fail colon cancer screening test known as
Cologuard. As such, we believe that the fair value for this persistently cash flow negative,
value-destroying Company is at best equal to the value of the cash on its balance sheet,
or less than $3 per share. We will demonstrate over the course of this series, why we feel
that the stock should be aggressively sold or shorted. This article is the first in a five part
series which will cover:


1. Why the Cologuard test is actually worse than currently available tests
2. Why the economics of the Cologuard test do not support reimbursement
3. Why almost nobody will use the Cologuard test even if it gets approved
4. Why the Cologuard test is no Pap Smear (the Bull case deconstructed)
5. How Exact Sciences has misled investors (for the third time)


In order to be successful, Exact Sciences will need to show that Cologuard is an effective
test, gain reimbursement, convince doctors to prescribe the test, and make a simple
enough test that patients will use it. We believe that they will fail at each of these tasks. In
this article, we will explain why we believe that the Cologuard test has a high probability of
being rejected by the FDA and why, in the unlikely event that it is even approved, it will
almost certainly be a commercial failure due to its lack of efficacy.


Exact Sciences would like investors to believe that Cologuard will revolutionize the
detection of colon cancer. The Company believes that Cologuard will replace the colon
cancer screening Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), just as the FIT has progressively
replaced the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) in recent years. To support this contention,
the Company has used a highly promotional slide deck in conversations with institutional
investors. Curiously (perhaps because Exact knows it is misleading?), a copy of this slide
deck has never been filed with the SEC. To aid investors, we have posted a copy of it
here.


Cologuard Is Actually Less Effective And More Expensive Than FIT


Exact Sciences highlights its contention that the Cologuard test is superior to the current
standard of care, the FIT, by touting Cologuard's sensitivity and specificity. The Company
reports the results of the Cologuard test as having a cancer sensitivity of 92%, a pre-

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 2/35


cancer sensitivity of 42%, and a specificity of 87%. In contrast, Exact Sciences claims that
the FIT has a cancer sensitivity of just 66%, a paltry pre-cancer sensitivity of 20%, and a
specificity of 95%. A higher sensitivity and a higher specificity are better. A copy of the
Company's slide with the FIT's performance is below:


In order to see how EXAS has misrepresented Cologuard, we need to review two
important statistical concepts when evaluating a medical test: sensitivity and specificity.
According to the Company's recent press release conveying its results, "Sensitivity
measures a test's ability to correctly identify positive results. It is the percentage of
patients who were determined by colonoscopy to have pre-cancerous polyps or cancer
that had a positive Cologuard test result. Specificity measures a test's ability to correctly
identify negative results. It is the percentage of patients who were determined by
colonoscopy not to have pre-cancerous polyps or cancer that had a negative Cologuard
test result."


While it seems from the data that the Cologuard test is better than the FIT, nothing could
be further from the truth. In fact, the FIT, when properly administered, is superior to
Cologuard. Exact Sciences hides this statistical fact by not providing an apples-to-apples
comparison. When compared over the same number of years, the FIT proves to be more
effective in identifying colon cancer. This article will clearly explain why.


Let's start by reviewing in a table format what Exact Sciences would like investors to
believe:

First, it is important to consider the vastly different frequency with which these tests are
meant to be administered. According to Exact, Cologuard is designed to be administered
every three years and is expected to cost $400, per Canaccord Genuity's May 27, 2017
EXAS research report (see excerpt here). In contrast, the FIT is designed to be
administered annually and costs $23 ($69 over three years) per the same report. This
difference in frequency is incredibly important. The sensitivity and specificity of the
Cologuard test should be compared to the sensitivity and specificity of the FIT
administered each year for three years (the cumulative efficacy of the FIT). We know that
even Exact Sciences believes it is important to consider the cumulative efficacy of a test,
because they do so in their presentation on slide 20 as can be seen here:


When you normalize the FIT and Cologuard tests for their frequency, the FIT shows itself
to be superior to Cologuard in nearly every aspect. Over a three-year time period, the FIT
is better at finding cancer and misses fewer potential cases.


Below is the expected performance of the Cologuard test in a 10,000 patient group,
identical to what the company used in its DeepC test.  This assumes that the test is given
once every three years, as suggested by the Company. Below it, we show the FIT being
administered to those same patients every year for three years.

Even based on the data that the Company highlights, investors should clearly understand
that Cologuard significantly underperforms FIT:


FIT finds 61 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
FIT finds 367 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
FIT misses 388 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
FIT results in 1,310 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


When compared on an apples-to-apples basis, the FIT outperforms Cologuard on the
three most important metrics. The lone exception is unnecessary colonoscopies, where it
is a mere 10% worse.


Exact Sciences Uses Old, Obsolete Data To Show A More Favorable Result For
Cologuard


To make things worse, the Company chose data from an outdated FIT study that
happened to be the single worst study we could find from the last 10 years. We identified
6 other trials that on average, inclusive of the trial that Exact used in its presentation (a
total of 7 trials), shows that the FIT has 77% sensitivity to cancerous tumors, 39%
sensitivity to pre-cancerous lesions, and 95% specificity.  When these average
representations of the FIT are used, the Cologuard test looks even worse in comparison:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 5/35


Here is the expected performance of the FIT based on the average performance in the
trials we identified:


Using this average data, we can now see that in all cases the FIT appears to be even
more effective than originally thought:


FIT finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
FIT finds 579 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
FIT misses 174 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
FIT results in 1,277 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


In fact, after only two years of testing the FIT is already outperforming the Cologuard test:


After two years, FIT finds 60 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
After two years, FIT finds 469 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
After two years, FIT misses 286 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard
misses 441
After two years, FIT results in 872 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results
in 1,194


Exact Sciences Ignores the 800lb Gorilla In The Room: The InSure FIT

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1567942-exact-sciences-the-rotten-sniff-test-1-of-5 6/35


Now we would like to introduce the InSure FIT. While the FIT is a good test, the InSure FIT
is even better and is the current leader in take-home FIT testing. Importantly, because of
the quantity of stool needed for Cologuard, it will be almost exclusively a take-home test -
more on this in part 3. The InSure FIT has 88% sensitivity to cancerous polyps, 43%
sensitivity to precancerous polyps, and 97% specificity, which can be seen here. A
comparison between Cologuard and InSure would be as follows:


These are the results that we would expect from the InSure FIT using the identical 10,000
patient group:


Using the InSure FIT as the comparator, Cologuard underperforms every single end point:


InSure finds 64 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
InSure finds 610 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
InSure misses 142 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
InSure results in 905 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


In fact, the InSure FIT outperforms the Cologuard test only two years into the three-year
testing cycle:

After two years, InSure finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds 59
After two years, InSure finds 504 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
After two years, InSure misses 249 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard
misses 441
After two years, InSure results in 614 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard
results in 1,194


Exact Sciences Hid Data From Its Pivotal Trial


The mystery of the FIT comparison does not stop there. There are two other oddities
regarding the Cologuard trial. First, it appears that Exact administered a FIT in its DeepC
trial in order to compare the two tests in an identical patient population. Exact clearly
states a FIT was administered as a comparison here. Exact then chose not to disclose the
data generated in its trial and chose to instead use an outdated 2005 FIT study done in
Japan by Morikawa as the comparator test. In our experience, this type of sleight of hand
is performed when a company wants to distract investors from potentially troubling results.
Further, in order to make Cologuard look better, the Company chose the FIT-CHEK test as
the FIT comparator in the DeepC trial, even though FIT-CHEK only uses one fecal sample
and is primarily administered in doctor's offices, which is a different setting from
Cologuard's. If the Company had instead used the InSure FIT, which like Cologuard is a
take-home test, it would probably have doomed Cologuard.


In addition to choosing an irrelevant FIT as the comparator for Cologuard, the Company
also chose not to report the results of the FIT included with Cologuard. As can be seen on
see slide 14 posted below, Cologuard actually includes a FIT, the results of which can be
separated from the Cologuard test as a whole to see whether the expensive DNA testing
actually adds any value above and beyond the FIT included with Cologuard. Bizarrely, we
don't know which FIT is included with Cologuard, so the supposedly positive DeepC trial
results may simply reflect a better FIT included with Cologuard. We would be shocked if
these data are not available, and believe that their exclusion suggests there is insignificant
value to the DNA testing, not to mention how little value it seems to add for an extra 17x
the cost of the FIT alone.

Making Up Numbers To Make Cologuard Look Better


We now again call attention to slide 20, which contains the unusual language "Not based
on clinical evidence." We find this a curious, weird, and misleading way to tout the efficacy
of a test - tell everyone how great it will be over a 9-year period and then back away from
your claims with the disclaimer that they're not based on clinical evidence. If the claims are
not coming from clinical evidence, then where are they coming from? Hopes and dreams?
Here is the relevant portion of the slide once again:

If You Thought That It Couldn't Get Any Worse…


We want to leave with one last telling sleight of hand in the information that Exact has
been disseminating. We have already posted slide 18 from the June 2013 presentation
above. We now highlight slide 16 from the May 2013 presentation, which can be found
here. At first glance, it looks like the same slide. However, after taking a closer look, we
can see that for the FIT statistics, Exact provided a range in May (with two sources). Now
going back to slide 18 from the June presentation Exact drops the second source, which
happens to be more recent and more favorable to the FIT, and instead simply reports the
lower (and arguably outdated) end of that range. Here is a side-by-side comparison of the
two slides:


We do not believe that the FDA is likely to be as easily fooled as investors. Instead, we
suspect that they will ask the hard questions, such as which test is actually better, what do
the true historical comparisons really show, and what did the Company's own FIT results
show in the same population. We believe that as the true irrelevance of the Cologuard test
comes to light, it has a high likelihood of being rejected by the FDA. In the unlikely event
the test is approved, it will likely fail to gain adoption due to its poor predictive abilities.
Further, we intend to submit a citizen's petition to the FDA outlining why Cologuard should
not be approved.


More To Come


This article, the first in a five part series, began by illustrating that regardless of the set of
data that you use, the Cologuard test is inferior to the FIT. Going forward, we are excited
to continue our takedown of EXAS's lofty claims regarding its Cologuard test. Next we will
discuss the economics of the Cologuard test, and why they don't support reimbursement.
That will be followed by a detailed argument explaining why we feel that very few doctors
will actually prescribe the Cologuard test even if it gets approved. Our fourth installment
