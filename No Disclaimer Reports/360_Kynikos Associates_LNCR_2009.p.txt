From the Trough to the Slaughterhouse?
2


Pigs at the Trough


• Healthcare


• Education


• Financial Services


• Defense


• Government Services


The 30-year deregulation boom 
derived from the view that the private 
sector always offers a better solution:

Inmates Running the Asylum


• Medicare Fraud Allegations (Merck $400m settlement in qui tam case)
• For-Profit Education Shenanigans: Numerous instances of recruiting and lending 


violations coupled with questionable educational outcomes
• No Bid Contracts at Halliburton, Contracting Scandals at Boeing
• Fannie and Freddie’s Stranglehold on Regulatory Oversight
• Enron Co-Opts US Energy Policy Through The Bush Energy Task Force
• Abramoff and K-Street Ilk Take Over Washington
• Wall Street Changes the Rules: Repeal of Glass-Steagall, loosened derivatives 


oversight, mark-to-market accounting and eased capital requirements


“There is no kind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and 
frequently fall than that of defrauding the government.” –Benjamin Franklin


The increasing intersection between federal largesse and corporate interests 
resulted in widespread incidents of corporations dictating public policy, systemic 
abuse and outright fraud.

The Perfect Storm & the Aftermath


The Outcomes of the Inmates Running the Asylum


• Financial System in Utter Collapse: Market Meltdown and Credit Crisis
• Fannie, Freddie Went Bust, Further Disrupting Housing Market 
• Current U.S. Healthcare System Is Troubled
• Explosive Growth in For Profit Post-Secondary Resulting In Large Numbers 


of Students Saddled With Massive Debt and High Default Rates 


• Enron, Halliburton and Other Companies With Close Government Ties 
Mired in Scandal


• Citizens and Legislators, for the First Time in Decades, Are Calling Into 
Question the Very Foundations of How Our Economic System Functions

The New Sheriff in Town


• Obama views access to health 
care and education as civil rights 
issues and vital to his legacy


• Administration is not in the 
business of subsidizing fat 
corporate margins.


• Wall Street has yet to fully 
recognize the new reality.


President Obama fashions himself 
as a once-in-a-generation reformer, 
in the vein of Teddy Roosevelt, FDR 
and Reagan -- riding into 
Washington on a wave of populism.

Social Services That Are Sold and Not Bought


• Heavily government-supported industries such as for-profit education and 
Big Pharma have spent disproportionately large sums of money on self-
serving advertising and promotion.


• For-profit education companies’ advertising costs amount to 53%(1) of 
educational spending.


• Big Pharma spends nearly three times the amount on sales and 
administrative costs as it does developing new drugs via research and 
development.

Costly Lessons: Which Comes First – Students or Profits?


Education Companies vs. Students


• Instructional costs as a percentage of revenue continues to decline (39% 
in most recent quarter vs. 44% in 2007(1)), enhancing profit margins.


• Government money pays for advertising that has fueled double-digit 
enrollment growth vs. 1%-2%(2) for traditional not-for-profit colleges.


• Students at proprietary schools saddled with 58%(3) more debt than 
students at traditional colleges.


• Budgeted lifetime loan default rates for proprietary-school students is 
more than 40% vs. 12%(2) overall.

The ‘For Less Profit’ Education Sector 


The ‘Old School’ Mentality (’98-’08)
• The for-profit postsecondary schools 


seen as solution to overcrowded 
community colleges, key component in 
retraining US workforce.


• Industry trade groups, erstwhile 
executives (APOL, SLM) help rewrite 
regulatory framework: 90/10, recruiter 
compensation, distance/online 
learning, etc.


• Five largest proprietary schools by 
revenue increased cumulative 
enrollment by 379k from the beginning 
of 2004 to 630k at end of 2008(1), for a 
five-year CAGR of 11% compared to 
1-2%(2) growth at traditional colleges.


The ‘New School’ Mentality (’09-)
• New Education Department places 


greater emphasis on community 
colleges, questioning the quality, cost 
and recruitment practices of for-profit 
schools.


• Administration, Capitol Hill staffers are 
re-examining rules on prop schools: 
rulemaking committee established this 
past week to renegotiate rules on 
incentive compensation, definition of a 
credit hour, job placement and other 
matters.


• Subsidized lending headed for 
extinction? 


• Little margin for error: Eight publicly 
traded for-profit companies average 
P/E is 23.2x, a 56% premium to S&P 
500’s 14.9x P/E.(3)

Healthcare Cure Can’t Wait


• Healthcare cost continues to 
outpace economic growth


– Expenditures doubled over the past 
10 years resulting in $2.3 trillion of 
spending or ~17% of GDP(1)


– Over the next decade, forecasted 
spending to reach $4.3 trillion or 
+20% of GDP(1)


– At projected rates, healthcare 
spending could approach $30 trillion 
and make up ~40% of GDP by 2050


• The White House views reforming 
healthcare as a cornerstone of fixing 
the economy


– Medicare to go bust by 2017 under 
current projections.(2)


– Increasingly small/mid-sized 
companies are foregoing health 
insurance. 


– Economic downturn leading to more 
Americans without healthcare 
coverage.

All that, and Universal Coverage too???


• 45mm Americans without health insurance


• Obama supports mandate for universal coverage with a goal of budget 
neutrality


• Individual mandate alone won’t cover the increase in costs across the 
system


• Public plan of some form is likely to emerge


• Congress calling for greater governmental oversight, intervention and price 
controls


• Pressure on profits across the healthcare system going forward
12


The Squeeze is Coming


• Holding industry’s feet to the fire to 
come up with ways to take $2 trillion 
in costs out of the system over the 
next 10 years.


• Healthcare Fraud Prevention and 
Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) 
combines forces of U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) 
to tackle Medicare fraud


• Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) clawing back on past 
overpayments, as shown by recent 
Medicare Advantage rate cut

Lincare – In the Bull's-eye


• Home oxygen services sector has 
been an egregious example of 
Medicare abuse in the past


• Despite past challenges, 
competitive bidding is coming
– CMS initially estimated 27% 


savings from competitive bidding
– After a 9.5% across-the-board cut 


to Durable Medical Equipment 
(DME), there’s still plenty for CMS 
to pursue


• Lincare’s margins reflect past rate 
cuts, but still top the charts


• The timing of any future market 
share gains won’t be enough to 
offset profit deterioration

Change We Can All Believe In: 
More Regulation & Lower Profits


The New Reality
• Healthcare, for-profit education and other 


industries reliant on governmental largess 
face a fundamentally different environment.


• Higher taxes for everyone in this room!


Opportunities to Offset Higher Taxes
• Go short these affected industries; AND…
• Give generously to the Ira W. Sohn
