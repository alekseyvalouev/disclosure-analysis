CITRON EXPOSES UBIQUITI
NETWORKS


THEY DIDN’T WANT CITRON TO EXPOSE
ANOTHER FRAUD, SO GUESS WHAT
WE’RE GOING TO DO?? EXPOSE



https://citronresearch.com/
Does Ubiquiti Networks (NASDAQ:UBNT) actually have real products that sell to
consumers? Of course! So did Valeant and WorldCom, but that does not stop its
financials from having every indication of being completely fraudulent.


Citron will detail a series of alarming red flags and detail how Ubiquiti Networks is
deceiving the investing public.


Brief History
Ubiquiti Networks is a hardware company that focuses on network routers and has
moved into consumer electronics. The company is controlled by a bright and brash,
yet unsophisticated, CEO named Robert Pera. While Ubiquiti started out serving the
WISP market with unique wireless networking products, its business quickly became
commoditized. As its product lines have advanced Ubiquiti finds itself competing in
the home network/access point space with the likes of Netgear, Cisco, and Google.


Believe it or not the company’s lack of ingenuity has led to its latest offering which is
a wearable camera – think GoPro….talk about chasing a loser.

ANOTHER FRAUD


Ubiquiti first came on Citron’s radar five years ago when CEO Robert Pera described
his mid-level engineering job at Apple by stating:


“APPLE IS A GREAT COMPANY, BUT I
REALIZED I WANTED TO HAVE MORE
SUCCESS FASTER.”


https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2012/0116/entrepreneurs-robert-pera-
computer-hardware-apple.html


To Citron, these words exemplify someone more interested in the trappings of
wealth than changing society with transformative technology.


It was the same “focus on money” behavior that led Pera to become the major
owner of an NBA team less than 1 year after his IPO. While Pera should have been
busy building a team in Silicon Valley, he instead built a team on the hardwood in
Memphis.


CNBC analysts Herb Greenberg immediately commented on this bizarre purchase.

Last month marked Citron Research’s 17th year of publication. We have used that
experience to compile a list of red flags, which lead us to believe without a doubt
that Ubiquiti Networks is a FRAUD.


#1.  CEO USED THE FRAUD
“DEATH WORD” ON LAST
CONFERENCE CALL
On Ubiquiti’s last conference call, Pera responded to critics by saying


“I believe up to this point in time, Ubiquiti, as a
company, has been misunderstood by a lot of
people. I feel we have a group of core
competencies that gives us a great competitive
advantage in the market.” Aug 2017
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094445-ubiquiti-networks-ubnt-ceo-
robert-pera-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single


This reminds Citron of the statements made by Valeant and Enron, in which
executives stated:


Mr. Pearson conceded that Valeant’s business
model was not fully understood by all investors but
insisted the company had “nothing to be ashamed
of”.


 –Michael Pearson, Valeant CEO, Interview with the Financial Times


It is unfair to us and unethical if you don’t take the
time to understand our business… we are doing it
purely right… people who raise questions are



https://www.cnbc.com/video/2012/06/12/another-ubiquiti-controversy.html

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094445-ubiquiti-networks-ubnt-ceo-robert-pera-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single
people who have not gone through our business in
detail.”


–CEO Jeff Skilling, phone call with Fortune, 2/14/2001


What Pera calls “misunderstood,” we call corporate fraud.  These warnings are
obvious not just to a savvy investor but to any reader capable of critical thought.


RED FLAG #2:
OPERATING
METRICS
Whenever a company seems too good
to be true, it probably is. Citron has
exposed more corporate fraud than
any non-government agency based on
this premise alone.


Citron has not “cherry picked” these
metrics, the below charts come from
this naively bullish Motley Fool article


https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/21/what-
is-ubiquiti-networks-competitive-
advantage.aspx


These 2 charts tell us one of the
following has to be true — either Robert
Pera is the best CEO in networking
equipment, or Ubiquiti is committing
FRAUD.


While other network equipment makers
are struggling to sell into a
commoditized market, Ubiquiti seems
to shine.


To illustrate how ridiculous the notion
that investors can rely on the claims of
Robert Pera, let’s just look at the closest
competitor: Netgear.


Netgear CEO Patrick Lo worked at HP as



https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/21/what-is-ubiquiti-networks-competitive-advantage.aspx

https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/page43-1030x773.jpg

https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Chart-image2.jpg
a senior executive for over 10 years. Lo
then founded Netgear and has been
CEO for 15 years. He has also
surrounded himself by a “top team.”


https://www.netgear.com/about/management/default.aspx


On the other hand, Robert Pera, with no
hardware experience, no CFO, no CTO
and a home grown COO with no real
business experience is blowing the
doors off Netgear.


Ubiquiti does not even have a
leadership page on its website.


RED FLAG #3: THE “SECRET
SAUCE”
Frauds often claim some “operational advantage” over competitors to justify their
outsized margins. This was common in the 2011 Chinese RTO scandals.


It is also common that the secret sauce turns out to be total bullshit once some light
is shined on it.


In the case of Ubiquiti, the sauce is the “Ubiquiti
Community” or as Pera has frequently described it: the
“evangelical community”.
This evangelical community – a fanatical user base that is devoted to Ubiquiti –
allegedly allows them to eliminate advertising and customer service. It’s “a core
competitive advantage” emphasized in IR presentations and mentioned tirelessly by
management on conference calls:
Before we go into statistics and proof
that the community is bullshit, lets
introduce some logic.


Are people so passionate about their
home router that they are telling all of
their friends and staying up at night
helping other people set up their
routers? Do people get “evangelical”
about their access point in their
homes?


Apple has the most evangelical of all
user bases — why wouldn’t Apple just
close its genius bar?


The concept is ridiculous and the
numbers Ubiquiti claims are just as
ridiculous.


Citron has done the extra work to
prove that the stats about this “alleged
community” are manipulated.


Click here to for detailed info…


While we do believe that at six or
seven years ago Ubiquiti may have
had an engaged WISP community, the
story is now as implausible as the rest
of the bullshit UBNT tells Wall Street.


The “fake community” as first exposed
by blogger @unemon1 is mostly
composed of bots:

RED FLAG #4: SHADY
DISTRIBUTORS
Just like Philidor was a fatal “tell” that Valeant was hiding something rotten behind
the curtains, relying on a distributor network invites a company to obfuscate its true
financials, especially when it is overseas, and doing business in sanctioned countries
and jurisdictions notorious for money laundering.


HERE IS A SAMPLE OF UBIQUITI’S
MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS:


Flytec Computers–founded by Osni Arruda
Flytec was Ubiquiti’s largest customer in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Since
then Ubiquiti has not named its biggest customer. Arruda was arrested in
Brazil in 2006 for “alleged crimes of embezzlement, forgery of private
documents, misrepresentation, use of false documents and conspiracy.”


More detail has been provided in this previous research report.
 https://www.altresearch.com/downloads/UBNT-April-2-2012.pdf


While this does not prove the company is obfuscating financials, it goes into
the mosaic of a story that just doesn’t make sense.


Batna/Anteny 24 (Poland)
Ubiquiti’s sales to Batna are not disclosed in the 10-K, but Batna is constantly
a top three accounts receivable distributor for UBNT.


This leads Citron to believe Batna/Anteny24 is one of Ubiquiti’s largest
customers.


Batna/Anteny24 appears to be run out of a tent in the back of a house.
Thanks to Google earth, Citron was able to provide this due diligence without
having to go to Poland.



https://www.altresearch.com/downloads/UBNT-April-2-2012.pdf
Most importantly, Ubiquiti’s financials don’t reconcile with its distributors. A report
by financial blogger “Unemon” revealed that the Ubiquiti’s disclosed recievables
don’t match its distributors disclosed payables. In the case of Batna the analysis
“show a discrepancy of at least 236%”


We encourage all to read Unemon’s report here.


Citron notes that Ubiquiti’s big markets are money laundering havens. The
Bankers Association or Finance, and Trade (BAFT) published a paper on money
laundering Red Flags.

RED FLAG #5:  THE CASH
Like many of the frauds that Citron has uncovered in the past, the cash
balances claimed by Ubiquiti do not generate reconcilable interest income.
While Pera is supposed to be the most efficient allocator of capital on Wall
Street- his cash tells a different story. What is wrong with these graphs?

https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Possible-Money-laundering-from-BAFT-tied-to-UBNT.pdf
$$$$$$$$
Ubiquiti chooses not disclose any profit or EBIT margins by region. However,
applying for analysis purposes a simple assumption that the overall company
profit margin is the same worldwide, below we see profits “generated” in the
US do not reconcile with the cash.


The green line below includes adjustments for buybacks (done with U.S.
cash), dividends, and debt issuances. For illustrative purposes the U.S. cash
should be the around the green line. The chart below shows it is far from.


The only explanation for this would be much lower profit margins in the U.S.
for Ubiquiti.


This is unlikely!  Profit margins in the U.S. should be much higher.


The largest expense for Ubiquiti is manufacturing the product (Cost of
Revenue) ~55% of revenue. The manufacturing of Ubiquiti products is done
by contract manufacturers exclusively outside the U.S. Also,
logistics/fulfillment is “primarily in China, and to a lesser extent, Taiwan and
United States.” In addition, roughly 2/3 of UBNT’s workforce is outside the U.S.


So we are expected to believe that Ubiquiti generates nearly all its cash in
Hong Kong and U.S. cash balances have not grown, despite the fact that most
its expenses are offshore, it has been profitable every quarter since its IPO,
and roughly one-third of its revenues are from the U.S. market.  Where is the
growth in U.S. cash?
RED FLAG #6: CORPORATE
TURNOVER
Despite claiming to be the most efficient operator in its space, UBNT has
more corporate turnover than Citron has ever seen in a public company—
especially in its finance and audit departments.


Corporate turnover chart


This mysterious cash theory is supported by Ubiquiti’s inability to keep a CFO
(haven’t had one for two years). Yet, they do have a European CFO who is
based in Lithuania.  Oddly enough her LinkedIn profile does not even have
her real name.


https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingrida-bl-0b61b873/?ppe=1


Without any notice this year their longtime CTO John Sanford left the
company without any disclosure or replacement.


Investors are to believe that Pera is helming the company with industry
busting margins and with longtime #2 man Benjamin Moore. Mr. Moore has
no previous experience besides Ubiquiti and he is a graduate of the esteemed
Utah Valley University (Acceptance rate 100%- something we have never
seen).


The canary in the coalmine was when respected VC Bill Gurley joined the
board of UBNT and resigned 9 months later.


Ubiquiti has yet to bring a “grown up” to either the
board or management.  All the makings of a FRAUD


RED FLAG #7: THE MOST
IMPORTANT OF ALL — CORPORATE

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingrida-bl-0b61b873/?ppe=1
CULTURE


What we learned from Enron, Valeant, and Madoff is that an underbelly of
corrupt corporate culture existed and were signs of trouble. While none of
these individually is enough to make the statement of corporate fraud, when
put into a mosaic it becomes clear what we are dealing with.


Arrest Warrant for Pera’s “right hand man”


Yu-Cheng (Believe) Lin ran Ubiquiti’s Taiwan operations and had signing power
for the company in Taiwan.


Robert J. Pera, Director of Ubiquiti Networks International Limited [Hong Kong],
does hereby authorize Believe Lin, Senior Operations Director of Ubiquiti
Networks International Limited Taiwan Branch (the “Taiwan Branch”), to sign
on behalf of the Taiwan Branch the office lease rental agreement “Lease
Contract” with the lessor for the premises at 105 Songren Road, Taipei.


This year he was charged with insider trading of Ubiquiti stock. He is now a fugitive
as Taiwan does not have an extradition treaty with the US.

Click Here to Read the  Synopsis Lawsuit
Synopsys develops software applications for the semiconductor industry. It is the
leading company by sales in the Electronic Design Automation industry. Ubiquiti
met with Synopsis to license Synopsis software all the while Ubiquiti was
counterfeiting licenses and using hacker websites to circumvent payment.


This was perpetrated by senior management especially Ching-Han Tsai


According to the lawsuit:


“Ubiquiti and its Hong Kong unit, Ubiquiti International Ltd., have used counterfeit
keys at least 39,000 times with 15 different usernames, circumventing Synopsys’
license key access control system, according to the suit. Tsai personally used a
counterfeit key to work around the paid system at least 66 times, Synopsys said.”


The Synopsis lawsuit gives us insight into corporate ethics from the top down.

The mysterious case of the missing money


In 2015, in an often forgotten story, Ubiquiti reported it had lost $46 million of
company cash. How did the company not even realize that $46 million was missing
from the company? Why did the FBI have to inform the company that it had been
“robbed”? Who is minding the ship?

Citron believes Ubiquiti story is unraveling as we write!
Next month Robert Pera’s option to buy the remaining part of the Memphis
Grizzlies that he does not own expires if not exercised. If he chooses to complete
the transaction (and he has never given any public indication that he will not), he
will need over $200 million for which he will have to tap into his stock and the NBA
will have to approve it. We believe that the NBA will take a more detailed look at the
financial stability of Mr. Pera.


On the other hand, if Pera does not exercise his option, this would be another
pretty good indication that Mr. Pera’s “game” is in the fourth quarter and time is
running out.


Ubiquiti has become a “company on the run”


Ask shareholders where Ubiquiti is based and you will hear San Jose.  WRONG.  Two
months ago without any notice Ubiquiti vacated its San Jose office.  This is what the
lobby looks like now (just three months ago the photo on left was filled with office
furniture and people)…with an empty parking lot in the middle of the day


Where is this company?? Draper, Utah? New York City?
Latvia? Lithuania?
It is no longer making sense…….


So much so that just last month Morgan Stanley
dropped coverage on Ubiquiti.



https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/02/08/how-a-tech-billionaires-company-misplaced-46-7-million-and-didnt-know-it/#4187fb8450b3
After posting a “stellar quarter” Morgan Stanley decided to drop coverage of what
allegedly is the best-operated company in networking hardware. To Citron this
means behind closed doors even the analysts have concluded


“WE JUST CAN’T MAKE SENSE OF THIS
THING ANYMORE!!”


Despite being a CEO that should be revered by Wall Street and the media for
creating a phenomenal company that sells hardware at software margins and just
destroys its competition – Robert Pera has never appeared on CNBC or Bloomberg.


Google Search for “Robert Pera Interview”


When we think of a business leader who outpaces the competition but is media shy
and won’t do interviews – one name comes to mind – MADOFF.


CONCLUSION
The end is now for the Ubiquiti Fraud.  What was once a company with
unique products in a fragmented space has turned into a company that sells
products in highly competitive markets where they are the last mover.  The
holes in their story are expanding daily and it is only time before the SEC
launches the formal investigation and Ubiquiti will go down in infamy
amongst the many other Wall Street Frauds.
