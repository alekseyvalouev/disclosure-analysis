CITRON UPDATES
AMERICAN
SUPERCONDUCTOR
(NASDAQ:AMSC)


What is a Power Module Company
Really Worth?


For the past two months, Citron has maintained its
opinion that the business of selling power modules
to the wind industry does not classify a company as
a “wind play”, but more accurately an industrial
commodity.  Meanwhile, sell side analysts have
ignored all warnings, as well as large insider selling
and questionable SEC con�dentiality requests
cloaking the company’s single largest piece of
projected business.  Citron will now put forth the
one piece of evidence that shareholders cannot
a�ord to ignore.  As for the analysts, ignoring things
is standard practice.


 


On August 5, American Superconductor revealed its
most recent quarter’s earnings to Wall St., and its
results were chilling.  With yet another losing
money quarter and declining gross margins, it
seems to be business as usual for AMSC.  Yet, here
are a few interesting tidbits which everyone has
seemed to ignore.

We Would Tell You … But Then We Would Have
To Kill You.


In a unique request made two weeks ago, American
Superconductor asked the SEC’s permission to
withhold key information regarding their huge deal
with Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Sinovel as
“con�dential”.  This is a trick they learned when
doing business with the Navy… but Sinovel is not
the Navy.  Noting that this one customer is 2/3rds
of their entire revenue stream, and the order
implies wind farms of a magnitude never before
seen on earth, Citron suggests that AMSC’s motive
for seeking con�dentiality is unlikely to be in the
best interests of its shareholders.

So what is AMSC really worth?  Don’t ask us ….
ask the industry


Until recently, there was uncertainty about how to
value the manufacturer of makers of power
modules to the alt-energy sector.  Are they
commodities as suggested by Citron (worth 1.5 to
2x sales), or do they deserve the nosebleed “alt-
energy” multiples (5x to 7x sales) that we see AMSC
enjoy in the marketplace?  The industry has now
spoken:


In the industry, Xantrex (XTX:Toronto) is a well
known direct competitor to AMSC, and as such has
been identi�ed for years in AMSC �lings.  As a
matter of fact, look who Hoovers lists as their #1
competitor:

In a piece of news that every sell side analyst
seemed to ignore, Citron notes the sale of Xantrex

There are a few obvious di�erences between

3. Xantrex has a more diversi�ed
product base and a diversi�ed
customer base.


(AMSC’s superconductor revenue fell 28% to about
$3.9 million revenue for the quarter.  At less than
10% of its revenue, there is no realistic way to
assign a signi�cant valuation to that side of the
business.)


Citron suggests this very timely and highly
comparable valuation point explains the excessive
insider selling we have seen this year from AMSC. 
Furthermore, it �nally gives the bulls and the bears
a fair comparable.


Add to this the company’s disclosure, that AMSC’s
right to sell electrical components to wind turbine
licensees is only a “right of �rst refusal”, meaning
that pricing will continue to be subject to
competitive pressures at the time of sale.  Citron
also notes that no less than four large Chinese
industrial manufacturers of power modules appear
to be on track for commercial production by 2010.


There is not much more Citron can say about the
future valuation of AMSC … but the market has
spoken.
