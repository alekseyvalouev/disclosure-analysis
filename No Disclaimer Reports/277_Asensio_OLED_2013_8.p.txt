Sterne Agee’s Explosively Misguided Take on
Universal Display


Posted on September 23, 2013 by asensio.com


Today Sterne Agee released a report saying that saying that


Universal Display Corporation (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) “is expected


to be a beneficiary of explosive growth in OLED adoption in the


next few years” and that OLED “materials are the most profitable


part of the OLED supply chain.”* However, Sterne Agee’s extremely


brief, unsupported statement of a simplistic thesis on its UDC’s


expectations utterly mischaracterizes UDC’s actual position. Despite


these “most profitable” and “explosive” labels, recently revealed


data shows that UDC is a technologically insignificant player in the


OLED supply chain, and UDC’s financials should be alarming in


their own right, even without an understanding of the


precariousness of UDC’s “key patent” claims. UDC is experiencing


declining year-over-year sales of its central red emitter material (on


which it has a supposed monopoly). UDC management’s attempts to


explain this deterioration in its business have been more and more


confusing and repeatedly inadequate.


UDC exists now only as an outgrowth of what happened between


1998 and 2005, based on government-funded DARPA experiments in


the 1990s that led to UDC’s key patents and UDC being able to


wrangle Samsung into an initial multi-year licensing deal in 2005.


The only economic value here rests on the perceived value of UDC’s


key patents to Samsung, which are private and reflect dated unique


circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that UDC’s most important


key patent claims, the basis for its so called “dramatic


breakthrough,” will be completely revoked after a hearing this


November at the European Patent Office Boards of Appeal.


Importantly, Sterne Agee highlighted the new competitive risk for


UDC from highly efficient fluorescent OLED materials, which have

the same efficiency as phosphorescent materials at “1/10 of the


cost,” according to Sterne Agee. We believe this is the first sell-side


commentary acknowledging this new competitive threat for UDC.


* The Sterne Agee report states: 


“UNIVERSAL DISPLAY. As the only publicly traded pure-play OLED


company 


in the U.S, Universal Display is expected to be a beneficiary of


explosive 


growth in OLED adoption in the next few years. POSITIVE


DATAPOINT. 


Organic materials are the most profitable part of the OLED supply


chain and 


represent ~10% of display costs. NEGATIVE DATAPOINT. Dr.


Chihaya Adachi 


from Kyushu University in Japan has invented and is looking to


commercialize 


highly efficient delayed fluorescence materials. Dr. Adachi’s


technology has 


been proven to achieve ~100% production efficiency and ~20%


external EL 


efficiency, which matches Universal Display’s phosphorescence


materials, but 


at 1/10 of the cost. Usage of Universal Display’s phosphorescence


materials 


and exclusive IP are currently key to OLED display technology. Dr.


Adachi 


has the patents to the delayed fluorescence technology and is


looking to partner 


with international chemical companies to commercialize the


materials. A startup 


company is expected to be organized by April 2014.”
