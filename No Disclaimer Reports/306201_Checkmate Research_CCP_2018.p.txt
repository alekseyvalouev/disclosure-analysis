CHECKMATE RESEARCH - CREDIT CORP GROUP (ASX: CCP) 





STRONG SELL RECOMMENDATION

CREDIT CORP: A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING? 





Credit Corp: The Group does not offer any contentious products such as Small Amount Credit Contracts 


(SACCs) or ‘payday loans’.  


Yet, Credit Corp competes with payday lenders, its loans have many features of payday loans, while 


consumers, journalists and even the marketing department of Credit Corp itself refer to the Company as 


a payday lender.   


Our analysis shows that Credit Corp exploits a loophole in the law to avoid regulatory scrutiny and to 


access cheap bank funding unlike other payday lenders. 


WE CALL WESTPAC TO FOLLOW ITS POLICY ON PAYDAY LENDERS AND TO PULL FINANCING FROM 


CREDIT CORP SIMILAR TO WHAT THE BANK DID TO OTHER PAYDAY LENDERS, CASH CONVERTERS AND 


MONEY3 CORP. 


We are not 


a payday 


lender!

Investment opinion - summary:  


1) CCP is the only debt purchaser/collector with a payday lending business globally. Our analysis 


shows that the business model combining debt purchasing and payday lending has not been 


tested through recessions. In our view this business model may underperform “pure” debt 


purchasers during a recession. 


2) Wallet Wizard (CCP’s lending business) uses a loophole in legislation to avoid being designated 


as a payday lender. In our opinion Westpac is likely to pull funding from CCP which will face the 


need to either quit its payday lending business or to urgently seek alternative funding. Both 


scenarios would be strongly negative for CCP’s share price. 


3) Wallet Wizard, CCP’s payday lending business, has one of the lowest lending criteria among 


the leading payday loan market players. The company lends to unemployed, discharged 


bankrupts, people employed unofficially (“Cash-in-hand”), recipients of government benefits 


and even to people who have negative capacity to repay.  


4) In our opinion Wallet Wizard may be violating responsible lending obligations by issuing loans 


to people who are not suitable. Such business practices may result in an investigation by the 


Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). In 2016 ASIC ordered Cash Converters, 


a competitor of CCP in a payday lending business, to pay over AU$12M for the violation of 


responsible lending obligations. 


5) We see numerous evidence of earnings management: reported net margin is too smooth when 


compared to peers, ASX-listed small cap companies and CCP’s own history; ratio of collections to 


amortization is too smooth when compared to peers and CCP’s own history; loan loss provision 


expense/interest income ratio was unchanged at 44.4% for three consecutive years (FY 2015-


2017); in FY 2016 CCP transferred AU$50M of assets from the lending segment to the PDL 


segment without providing any disclosures; the company understated losses at its US debt 


purchasing business at least in FY 2015 and FY 2017. 


6) We find many reasons why investors should be skeptical about CCP’s system of controls, 


especially about the company’s auditor Hall Chadwick.

CCP IS A TRULY UNUSUAL COMPANY WITH AN UNPROVEN BUSINESS MODEL 


Credit Corp (ASX: CCP) is a truly unusual company. Until 2012 there was nothing special about this 


business; its bread and butter were traditional debt purchasing/debt collection businesses: purchasing 


bad debts at deep discounts and trying to collect them. In 2012 CCP expanded into payday lending in 


Australia and New Zealand as well as debt purchasing in the United States (US). This expansion into new 


business areas was largely financed with debt and led to a meteoric rise in the company’s stock price. 


Entering the payday lending business created an exceptional and unusual combination of a debt 


purchaser and a payday lender. We checked all major global markets and could not find another debt 


purchaser with business in the payday lending industry. 


The list of publicly traded debt purchasing companies 





Source: Companies’ filings 


The combination of debt purchasing/debt collection and payday lending businesses has not been tested 


during recessions. While this does not necessarily mean that this business model is not viable, there 


should be reasons why debt purchasers have not expanded into payday lending. The first and the most 


obvious reason which comes to mind is that payday lending is not a core competence of a debt 


purchaser. However, there is another less obvious, albeit not less important reason.  


Being able to access funding during times of a market distress has tremendous value for debt 


purchasers. Access to financing gives a company opportunity to buy debt portfolios at cyclical lows and 


subsequently achieve exceptional returns. However, as lenders frequently report losses during 


recessions, being in a lending business may substantially limit or even restrict a debt purchaser from 


access to funding during the period of market distress.  As a result, a company may therefore forego 


exceptional investment opportunities, as compared to its competitors.

STRONG EVIDENCE OF EARNINGS MANAGEMENT 


Our analysis shows that starting from FY 2014 there has been growing evidence of earnings 


management at CCP. The table below summarizes our findings. 


Summary of accounting red flags 





(1) Over the last 4 years CCP has reported uncharacteristically smooth net margins. Since FY 2014 


margins have been too smooth when compared to  


a) industry peers;  


b) ASX-listed small cap companies;   


c) CCP own historical margins. 





Between FY 2014 and FY 2017 the following trends/events affected CCP’s business and profit margins: 


• Expansion of the lending segment, with a turnaround to profitability achieved in FY 2015. 


• Expansion into the New Zealand lending market in FY 2016 with material startup losses. 


• Breaking even of the US debt purchasing segment in H2 FY 2017 after many years of losses. 


• Acquisition of NCML, a debt purchasing business in FY 2017. 


• Increase in debt purchases in FY 2016-2017 by 72% as compared to FY 2014-2015. 


• Increase in financial leverage as measured by debt/equity ratio from 0.24x in FY 2014 to 0.85x in 


FY 2017. 


• Exit from SACC business in FY 20161 and introduction of a new lending brand, Wallet Wizard, 


with the launch of a large-scale and costly advertising campaign. 





Despite these various trends/events the net margin of CCP remained in a very tight range of between 


20.0% and 20.7% during the whole period. Such smooth net margin is highly surprising given that 


historically CCP had quite a volatile net margin. For example, during FY 2007-2013 net margin fluctuated 


between 6.9% and 23.4%. Even if we exclude the period of the Global Financial Crisis (FY 2007-2009) and 


look at FY 2010-2013, the net margin was in the range of 14.5% - 22.4%. However, since FY 2014 the net 


margin has been almost unchanged.

CCP net margin 





Source: Company Public Filings 


When we compared CCP net margins with margins of publicly traded peers, we saw the same pattern, 


with CCP being an outlier during FY 2014-2017. Even the closest peers – Australian debt purchasers 


Collection House (ASX:CLH) and Pioneer Credit (ASX:PNC) – had materially higher margin volatility during 


the same period. 


Net margins of CCP and other debt purchasing companies 





Source: Companies’ Public Filings 


CCP net margins are not just smoother, they are also higher than the net margins of peers (the only 


exception is a Sweden-based debt purchaser Intrum Justitia, which has reported high net margins 


similar to CCP but with higher volatility).  


Harry Markopolos, a US forensic accountant, thinks investors should be skeptical when dealing with the 


outstanding performance: 


“Focus on the manager or the company that is head and shoulders above the rest. Whenever 


somebody has outstanding performance, Wall Street assumes genius. I assume fraud until genius 


is proven. Look for the outperformance and investigate there… If the numbers are too good to be 


true, they rarely are”. 


CCP also has exceptionally smooth net margins when compared to its small cap peers trading on the 


ASX. The table below shows that CCP was an outlier in terms of net margin volatility2 over the last 4 


years (FY 2014-2017) among ASX 200 companies with market capitalization below AU$1.0B:

While the exact mechanics of earnings management at CCP is not clear, one of the ways CCP could be 


managing earnings is by capitalizing certain costs, for example, transaction and loan origination costs. 


Although CCP discloses that some of these costs are capitalized, neither the amounts are disclosed, nor 


are any additional details provided. Below we present those accounting policies where CCP discloses 


capitalization of expenses. 


Note 3: Revenue 


Interest and fee income from consumer lending 


Interest income is recognised when the payments are received and fees are recognised as income 


over the life of the loan. Direct loan origination costs are netted against fee income over the life 


of the loan. 


Note 10: Consumer loans receivables 


Consumer loans receivables are initially recognised at fair value of the loan written plus 


transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 


method, less provision for expected credit losses.

Note 11: Purchased debt ledgers 


PDLs are recognized at fair value (generally the consideration paid) plus transaction costs and 


subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, in accordance 


with AASB 9 Financial Instruments. 


In some cases, the amount of such transaction costs can be large enough to affect a company’s net 


income by dozens of percentage points. For example, in 2016 the leading UK debt purchaser Arrow 


Global capitalized GBP 22.9M of litigation costs which, if fully expensed, would have reduced the 


company’s net income by 83%. 


Another debt purchaser – Australian publicly traded company Collection House – found itself in hot 


water during 2017 after it was revealed that the company improperly capitalized certain software 


development expenses. We also note that despite having a smaller business than CCP, Collection House 


discloses the amount of capitalized legal costs as a separate asset, thereby showing higher transparency. 


(2) During FY 2015-2017 Consumer loan loss provision relative to Interest and fee income from 


consumer lending was unchanged at 44.4%. 


Management of a bank has great discretion regarding the recognition of loan loss provision expense, 


which may be used to smooth earnings. While we would not be surprised to see low volatility in CCP’s 


loan loss provision expense, CCP managed to exceed our expectations, recording the same ratio of LLP 


provisions to interest income over the three consecutive years. 


CCP loan loss provision expense 





Source: Company Public Filings 


We would like to highlight that the timing when CCP recognizes interest and fee income, and loan loss 


provision expense does not coincide. While interest income and fees are recognized on a cash basis and 


over the life of the loan respectively, loan loss provision is recognized at the time when the loan is 


issued. 


Accounting policy on revenue recognition: 


Interest income is recognised when the payments are received and fees are recognised as income 


over the life of the loan. 


Accounting policy on consumer loans: 


Consumer loans receivables are initially recognised at fair value of the loan written plus 


transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 


method, less provision for expected credit losses. Given the nature of loans written, a lifetime 


expected credit loss provision is taken up upon initial recognition of a consumer loan receivable.

Consumer LLP expense/Interest revenue from consumer lending 75.8% 44.4% 44.4% 44.4% 41.7%
Page 9 of 37 
 


We do not believe that reporting the same LLP expense/Interest income ratio three years in a row is a 


coincidence; we think CCP does not follow its own accounting policies by recognizing loan loss provision 


expense as a function of interest and fee income earned, and not based on the amount of loans issued 


as per the stated accounting policy on consumer loans. 


(3) Ratio of Collections from PDLs to PDL amortization was unusually stable between FY 2013 and FY 


2017 as compared to peers and CCP’s own history. 


For a debt purchaser, reporting under IFRS and recognizing revenue according to the effective interest 


method, revenue is calculated as Collections from PDLs less PDL amortization. While collections are a 


relatively straightforward metric, calculation of portfolio amortization requires a lot of management’s 


discretion, including making assumptions about expected return, estimation of remaining collections, 


and collection curve. 


As the table below shows, the ratio of collections to amortization for debt purchasers reporting under 


IFRS generally exhibits certain volatility: it can be affected by a number of different accounting 


assumptions and operating decisions made by management like the change of return expectations on 


newly purchased PDLs, purchasing different PDL assets as compared to the existing book, PDL 


impairments/writeups, etc.  


Collection/Amortization ratio for CCP and selected peers3 





Source: Companies Public Filings 


During FY 2013-2017 CCP reported an unusually stable Collections/Amortization ratio which remained 


within a very tight range of 2.10 – 2.14. By this ratio CCP is an outlier both when compared to peers and 


relative to its own history. Like CCP’s net margin, the Collections/Amortization ratio was quite volatile in 


the past and later became very smooth. In our view the Collections/Amortization ratio staying in such a 


tight range over five years is statistically improbable and is a strong red flag indicating that these 


numbers are managed.

(4) Questionable asset transfer from Consumer lending to Debt purchasing segment in H2 FY 2016 


During the second half of FY 2016 CCP transferred4 c. AU$50M of assets from its Consumer lending 


segment to the Debt purchasing segment. The amount transferred constituted 45% of the net loan book 


as of 31 Dec 2016. Transferring of supposedly fully provisioned consumer loan assets to the segment 


involved in purchase and collection of nonperforming debts looks highly suspicious. In our view, this 


transaction may indicate that the actual amount of loan loss provisions was understated at the time, 


and CCP had a much higher share of non-performing loans on its consumer loan book. 


Subsequently, in the report for the first half of FY 2018, CCP stopped providing disclosure on the 


segment assets and liabilities. This decreased transparency of segment assets is particularly worrying 


given the unexplained material transaction observed during H2 FY 2016.

(5) CCP may be misleading investors about the performance of its US business 


While performing our analysis we found a way to check the performance of the US business during FY 


2015-2017. Closer look at notes “33: Cross guarantee” and “23: Subsidiaries” (Annual Report 2017) 


shows that the note “33: Cross guarantee” includes the financial results of all Australian and New 


Zealand subsidiaries of the Group5. Subtracting the results of all Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries 


from the consolidated financial results gives us the performance of the US business (CCP has subsidiaries 


only in three countries: Australia, New Zealand and the USA). The financial results of the US business 


calculated by us based on CCP’s audited financial reports substantially differ from the results disclosed 


by CCP in its presentation for H1 FY 20186. 


                                                           
4 For these calculations we compared segment assets as reported in a footnote on Operating segments with the 
numbers from the balance sheet. For example, assets of the Consumer lending segment (Note 24: Operating 
segments in AR 2017) were compared with the Consumer loans line from the balance sheet. The difference 
between these two numbers was immaterial during the whole period under review except for the H2 FY 2016, 
which caught our attention. Moreover, the decline in assets of the Consumer lending segment coincided with the 
increase of Debt purchasing segment assets of similar magnitude, which led us to conclude that CCP transferred 
assets between these two segments. 


5 While Credit Corp Financial Solutions Pty Limited, a subsidiary operating CCP’s lending business in New Zealand, 
was incorporated on 2 Jul 2015 (FY 2016), according to public sources, this entity was included into the scope of 
the Cross Guarantee only in FY 2017.

DESPITE MANAGEMENT’S CLAIMS, WALLET WIZARD IS A PAYDAY LENDER 


In a press release issued on 23 Oct 2015, CCP announced plans to withdraw from SACC lending (small 


amount credit contract, a legal term used for payday loans in Australia) from 1 March 2016. According 


to CEO Thomas Beregi this move was a result of “a decision by ASIC to apply the pejorative description 


“payday loan” to all SACC products regardless of duration, affordability and pricing”. 


Since then the company highlighted its exit from SACC/payday lending business numerous times. 


AR 2016:  


The Group does not offer any contentious products such as Small Amount Credit Contracts 


(SACCs) or ‘payday loans’. 


Thomas Beregi on 31 Jan 2017 investors call:  


Credit Corp does not issue any SACC products. 


In its communication with investors, CCP regularly points out that it is not in a payday lending business. 





Source: Company presentation from 18 April 2018 


Below we present evidence that Wallet Wizard is a payday lender which makes it subject to huge 


business, regulatory and litigation risks.

(5) Loans provided by Wallet Wizard have many features of payday loans7. According to the website of 


Wallet Wizard, automatic loan repayments coincide with a borrower’s pay cycle. This is one of the key 


features of a payday loan as per Wikipedia8. According to the article from Wikipedia on payday loans 


“the basic loan process involves a lender providing a short-term unsecured loan to be repaid at the 


borrower's next payday”. 





Source: Wallet Wizard 


What are the reasons CCP does not want to be called a payday lender? 


During 2015 Australian banks pulled out from financing payday lenders. In August 2015 Westpac was the 


last major Australian bank to stop funding payday lenders - Cash Converters and Money3. At the same 


time Westpac continued to provide financing to CCP, which although abandoned SACC lending, 


remained in payday lending business. 


Westpac should be consistent in their policy regarding payday lenders and withdraw funding from CCP 


in line with what the Bank did to other payday lenders in 2015. According to Bank’s website, the policy 


of Westpac is to stay away from doing business with payday lenders.

The other reason why CCP avoids being called a payday lender is due to the risks coming from the 


expected additional regulation of the payday lending industry.  


Since the introduction of payday lending reform in 2013 various consumer protection groups in Australia 


have been lobbying further tightening of payday lending regulation, in particular SACC lending. The 


government has already completed the consultation process regarding further SACC and consumer lease 


reform, and presented the Draft Bill in October 2017. The key reform to be introduced:  


The existing protected earnings amount for SACCs will be extended to cover all consumers and 


the portion of income that can be devoted to SACC repayments will be 10 per cent of a 


consumer’s net income. Currently the SACC protected earnings amount only applies to persons 


who receive 50 per cent or more of their income from Centrelink and the portion of income is 20 


per cent of gross income. 


With this reform the Government proposes to further limit the share of borrower’s income which can be 


directed towards the repayment of a payday loan. In our view, this will reduce the total addressable 


market for payday lenders and will result in increased competition for eligible borrowers. 


Other important reforms related to the SACC market according to the Draft Bill are: 


• requiring SACCs to have equal repayments and equal payment intervals; 


• introducing broad anti-avoidance protections to prevent SACC and consumer lease providers 


from circumventing the rules and protections contained in the Credit Act; and  


• strengthening penalties to increase incentives for SACC providers and lessors to comply with the 


law. 


Initially, this legislation was expected to be implemented by the end of 2017, and later the deadline was 


shifted to April 2018. As per the latest information according to the assistant minister to the treasurer, 


Michael Sukkar, the government would progress legislation in 2018. While payday lenders have been 


able to block the introduction of the new legislation, we think the introduction is inevitable and will have 


a material effect on the payday lending industry and the lending business of CCP. 


We also highlight that MACC lenders (medium amount credit contract – loan with amount between 


$2,001 and $5,000) should be worried as well. As Good Shepherd Microfinance, a non-profit lending 


organization, puts it, payday lenders have been shifting their business towards MACC market to avoid 


SACC reforms and this trend is unlikely to stay unnoticed by lawmakers and the regulator: 


Also concerning is a shift towards the Medium Amount Credit Contract (MACC) market by 


payday lenders as a means to means to avoid SACC reforms. As the deadline approaches, payday 


lenders are increasing loan amounts and extending loan terms, with the amount of MACC credit 


doubling over the past financial year. Good Shepherd Microfinance’s experience with the StepUP 


low interest loan program has shown that the market for loans between $2,000 and $5,000 


includes a significant proportion of people living on low incomes, many of whom are dependent 


on government benefits. We strongly encourage regulators to pay attention to the MACC market 


to ensure activity in this category of loans does not lead to consumers being lent more money 


than they want or need.

IS CCP COMMITTING A LEGAL FRAUD? 


One of the questions which puzzled us is how could CCP so smoothly pull out of the SACC/payday 


lending business in FY 2016 without even downgrading profit guidance for that year? 


It turns out that while CCP abandoned SACC lending, the company remained in the payday lending 


business by finding a loophole in the definition of a SACC loan.  


A small amount credit contract (SACC) is defined in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 as 


a credit contract provided by an entity that is not an authorized deposit institution, where the credit 


limit is less than $2,000, the term of the contact is at least 16 days but not longer than one year, the 


debtor’s obligations under contract are unsecured, and the contract is not a continuing credit contract. 


Here is what Wallet Wizard says on their website: 


The Wallet Wizard continuing credit contract can provide simple, two-step access to redraw up 


to your credit limit - anytime, anywhere. 


The only difference between SACC loan and a loan from Wallet Wizard is that the latter is a line of credit 


(continuing credit contract). This allows CCP to avoid regulatory burden imposed by National Consumer 


Credit Protection Act 2009 and an industry regulator ASIC. 





Source: Wallet Wizard website, company filings 


In our view, by exploiting a loophole in legislation, CCP is conducting legal fraud as defined by Jim 


Chanos of Kynikos Associates: 


“While they might be adhering to every aspect of legal requirements in what they were doing, 


there was still an attempt to mislead and an attempt to obfuscate…” 


The king of all legal frauds – Enron – was described by Bethany McLean, in her book “The Smartest Guys 


in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron”: 


Such criminal prosecutions are nothing if not complex. That was one of the lessons from Enron. 


That’s because much of what seems so wrong in commonsense terms is actually perfectly legal, 


and it’s hard to hold senior executives accountable when accountants and lawyers gave their

blessings. Executives exploit this unfortunate reality. As Fastow (Enron’s CFO – CR) explained in 


Las Vegas, accounting rules and regulations and securities laws and regulation are “complex . . . 


what I did at Enron and what we tended to do as a company [was] to view that complexity, that 


vagueness . . . not as a problem but as an opportunity.” The only question was “do the rules 


allow it—or do the rules allow an interpretation that will allow it?” Fastow insisted he got 


approval for every single deal—from lawyers, accountants, management, and directors—yet 


noted that Enron is still considered “the largest accounting fraud in history.” 


Indeed, in many ways, Enron was a legal fraud. Fastow’s guilty plea—and Skilling’s and Lay’s 


convictions—were due to specific incidents where prosecutors could show that the Enron 


executives had crossed the line. But they didn’t speak to the larger fact that Enron’s financials 


were basically a complete misrepresentation of reality. “I knew that what I was doing was 


misleading,” Fastow told the Las Vegas crowd. “But I didn’t think it was illegal. I thought: That’s 


how the game is played. You have a complex set of rules, and the objective is to use the rules to 


your advantage.” 


Marianne Jennings, the author of “Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns Before 


It’s Too Late” describes such behavior as a hallmark of ethical collapse in the organization: 


Not all the companies that drift ethically have violated any laws. There are many pleas, 


settlements, and agreements that companies discussed and studied in these pages have reached 


for the sake of expediency and/or not because of any legal violations. The majority of the reports 


on settlements indicate that the company involved does not admit any wrongdoing. Indeed, I 


would be the first to state unequivocally that hung juries and acquittals in these cases are 


reassurance that the jury system works. The “common man,” when presented with the tasks of 


finding intent and guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, cannot always conclude that either was 


present in the complex transactions that often do carry the protection of technical compliance 


with the law. However, the law was never intended to be the maximum for standards of 


behavior. The law represents the minimum standard of behavior required. We are permitted to 


do more than the law requires and less than the law allows. A company can be teetering 


ethically without crossing legal lines. 


When an organization collapses ethically, it means that those in the organization have drifted 


into rationalizations and legalisms, and all for the purpose of getting the results they want and 


need at almost any cost… They meet legal standards without really considering the long-term 


implications of technicalities, taking advantage of loopholes, and the resulting impact on the 


individual and organizational soul. They are concentrating so much on the “Gotcha strategy” of 


finding the loophole or the easier way around the tough slog of diligent competition that they 


are no longer managing as effectively, creatively, or successfully as they could. 


Should Westpac want to protect its reputation and act ethically, it may need to go beyond the legal 


definition of a payday loan in determining whether CCP is a payday lender and whether to provide 


financing to this company. As Marianne Jennings puts it: “The law represents the minimum standard of 


behavior required”. At the same time, the misleading and questionable behavior of CCP with regards to 


its payday lending business has numerous signs of ethical collapse and legal fraud.

Source: walletwizard.com.au 


We believe that such behavior of CCP is not sustainable and will be corrected, potentially at a large cost 


to its shareholders: 


• It is anticompetitive. While other payday lenders must comply with extensive and costly 


regulatory requirements for SACC lenders (which were introduced to protect consumers), Wallet 


Wizard avoids such oversight/regulatory scrutiny which gives the lender an unfair competitive 


advantage over more responsible payday lenders. Another unfair advantage CCP enjoys is cheap 


bank funding, despite the fact that Australian banks pulled out of funding SACC lenders back in 


2015. We think Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should investigate this 


matter. 


• It is misleading. While management makes shareholders believe that regulatory and litigation 


risks are low, in reality they are large. The legal loophole used by Wallet Wizard may be easily 


closed during the next regulatory review of the payday lending industry which will considerably 


increase costs of doing business and regulatory scrutiny of Wallet Wizard, and will most likely 


cut off funding for CCP. We would like to point out that misleading statements made by 


management during 2007-2008 led to a lawsuit filed by shareholders. This lawsuit was one of 


the key factors triggering a 95% decline in share price during that period.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WESTPAC AND CCP 


In our view, the decision by Westpac to continue business with CCP in 2015 despite huge reputational 


risks was motivated not only by CCP’s use of a loophole in legislation. Upon closer look it is clear that 


Westpac and CCP have strong business relationships.

4) Three out of five board directors of CCP, including board chairman, previously held executive 


positions with Westpac: 





Source: Company filings, open sources 


So why would Westpac pull financing from CCP given such strong business relations between the 


companies? Well, because Westpac should care about its reputation and should not want to be known 


as “the only Big-4 bank in Australia doing business with payday lenders”. In December 2017 Westpac 


chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, emphasized the paramount importance of the bank’s reputation during the 


AGM: 


As we begin our third century, our biggest challenge lies in rebuilding our reputation across the 


communities in which we operate. 


If we are to continue to prosper we must ensure the needs of customers and communities are the 


priority and we must actively demonstrate the value we bring to society and the value we bring 


to customers every day. 


In our view, given the huge importance of reputation to Westpac and a relatively small scale of a 


business Westpac has with CCP, the choice for Westpac looks obvious.

CCP EXERTED PRESSURE ON JOURNALISTS WHICH CALLED ITS LENDING BUSINESS “A PAYDAY LENDER” 


We found evidence of a censorship by CCP regarding the journalists who called Wallet Wizard “a payday 


lender”. On 1 June 2017, The Checkout, a popular consumer-oriented show on ABC, ran an episode on 


payday lenders titled “Having A Lend Of Us: Payday Loans” (Season 05, episode 08).  


According to the commentaries under the video, published on the Youtube channel of The Checkout, 


the original version of the video contained the Wallet Wizard logo on the list of payday lenders which 


appears 34 seconds into the video. Later, this version of the video was replaced with a new version 


without a Wallet Wizard logo:

The screenshot of the currently available censored version of the video from 0:34 does not contain a 


Wallet Wizard logo anymore:

We note that journalists calling Wallet Wizard a payday lender were correct in substance. A company 


forcing journalists to be silent is never a good sign. We have seen this pattern before, and such behavior 


has never ended well for a company.  


According to a response from ABC to a complaint filed by Wallet Wizard, authors of the episode were 


confused “because of the way the business positions and markets itself in competition with payday 


lenders”.

HOW HAS WALLET WIZARD GROWN SO FAST? 


CCP’s payday lending business has shown exceptional growth: it was started in 2012 and by the end of 


2017 the company took 20% of the Australian/NZ cash loan market (as per CCP’s presentation): 





Source: Company Public Filings 


According to the management of CCP, lower cost of loans is one of the key competitive strengths of the 


company’s lending business.  


Annual Report 2017:  


Credit Corp’s Wallet Wizard-branded fast cash loan is the cheapest and most flexible offering in 


the segment. All of Credit Corp’s lending products apply interest and fees at rates below the 


regulatory caps applicable to mainstream lending. This differentiates our products from the 


heavily scrutinised alternatives marketed by competitors. 


However, according to numerous industry research studies, payday lenders generally compete not on 


price, but on qualitative factors like convenience of location, quality of service and ease of obtaining a 


loan.  


Competition on price doesn’t exist in the payday loan market because the cost of the credit is a 


very low consideration for the borrower. People ‘choose’ their payday lender based on the 


convenience of the location, the friendliness of store staff, and the ease of getting a loan.  


Source: consumeraction.org.au  


One of the most recent and expansive studies undertaken in Canada is the Payday Loan 


Customer Study: Final Report (September 2010) (for the Canadian Payday Loan Association) 


conducted by Thinkwell Research. This involved a large scale telephone survey of current payday 


loan customers in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, asking consumers 


about their practices, behaviours and opinions in relation to various financial products. The 



https://smallloans.consumeraction.org.au/nine-myths-about-payday-lending/
Page 27 of 37 
 


survey resulted in 350 completed interviews. Over half of the respondents indicated that they 


chose payday loans rather than other financial products because they believed the process was 


“quick and easy” and that they were able to receive a loan whenever they needed it. 


Source: aph.gov.au  


And payday loan customers say they prefer the longer business hours and easier lending 


requirements of payday lenders, despite the high interest that payday lenders charge (391 


percent APR, or annual percentage rate), the study said.  


Source: ucdavis.edu  


Customer reviews on Wallet Wizard on a local website productreview.com.au confirm these findings. 


Most of the customer reviews contain complaints regarding the slow approval process OR regarding 


being refused a loan by the company. At the same time, we found only a few customer reviews with 


complaints about high interest rates that the company charges (47.8% APR). 


In our view, one of the key reasons which differentiates the lending business of CCP – Wallet Wizard – is 


that the company has one of the lowest lending criteria among its peers. We conducted analysis of 


lending criteria for Australia’s top payday lenders and present our findings below. The table shows 


various categories of high-risk borrowers and whether they may obtain a loan from the leading payday 


lenders in Australia. 


Source: Companies’ websites, finder.com.au 


This is not a full spectrum of lending criteria used by the company, as we have evidence Wallet Wizard 


issues loans to borrowers with negative capacity to repay (more on this later). 


When we started analyzing the lending criteria of Wallet Wizard, we found that the company has a very 


few stated restrictions for potential borrowers. On its website WW simply states, “we welcome all 


applications”, including people on government benefits and discharged bankrupts. Up to February 2016 


WW was even issuing loans to current (undischarged) bankrupts, however, since then this practice was 


stopped.

When we were analyzing the code behind the Wallet Wizard website, we found a file creditcorp-


constants.js. As its name implies, the file contains a list of constants (values that cannot be changed by 


the program during normal execution). In our view, by not closing access to this part of the code, Wallet 


Wizard inadvertently disclosed important details about the lending criteria of the company (see the 


block in red).

According to this part of the code, there are three reasons to be automatically declined by the Wallet 


Wizard loan engine:

• “Not Permanent Resident” 


• “Below Minimum Age” 


• “Single, capacity below threshold (-$100)” 


The following applicants are being “referred” which means “additional assessment is done by the 


company staff”. In this case the applicant can be either declined or approved: 


• “Bankrupt” 


• “Unemployed” 


• “Cash in Hand” (e.g. people receiving their income in cash) 


• “Partnered, capacity below threshold (-$100)” 


• “Capacity within buffer (-$100 to $100)” 


If the loan application was referred, the following message appears:

Being referred means that Wallet Wizard will request more information from a potential borrower to 


make the final decision. 


It is our understanding that the term “capacity” as used by Wallet Wizard in the programming code 


behind its website has the same meaning as in the regulations issued by the industry watchdog ASIC. So, 


what is “capacity”? 


Responsible lending obligations introduced by National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 require 


Australian lenders to check if a loan they provide is “not unsuitable” for potential borrowers. Below is an 


excerpt from ASIC’s Regulatory guide 209 “Credit licensing: Responsible lending conduct” describing 


what “unsuitable” means:

In addition, you must assess a credit contract or consumer lease as unsuitable where it is likely 


that: 


(a) the consumer will be unable to comply with their financial obligations under the contract (i.e. 


they do not have the capacity to meet their payment obligations under the contract), or could 


only comply with substantial hardship; 


(b) the contract will not meet the consumer’s requirements or objectives; or 


(c) if the regulations prescribe circumstances in which a contract is unsuitable, or unsuitable 


unless the contrary is proved—those circumstances will apply to the contract. 


Source: ASIC  


As per Regulatory Guide 209 it is lender’s responsibility to assess borrower’s capacity to repay a loan to 


make sure a loan is suitable for the borrower. Here is an example of how “capacity” is calculated: 


Example 10: Regular family expenses 


In assessing whether a credit contract will cause a consumer to experience substantial hardship, 


a credit licensee might set one or more levels of realistic family living expenses required to meet 


the consumer’s (and their dependants’) living costs. The consumer would need to be able to meet 


these living costs from their income, after deducting the ongoing repayments under the credit 


contract (and all other repayments and regular financial commitments of the consumer). Below 


this level, the licensee would, as a policy, not consider the consumer to have the capacity to 


repay the loan without substantial hardship, regardless of their circumstances. 


Source: ASIC  


According to ASIC, a borrower’s capacity should be calculated as “income less living expenses less 


repayments under the credit contract and other financial commitments”. If CCP complies with ASIC 


guidance on responsible lending, then how can they not automatically reject borrowers with negative 


capacity to repay (this means some of them get loans)? We particularly refer to these two categories of 


borrowers which are being “referred” for additional review, and not being automatically rejected: 


• Partnered, capacity below threshold (-$100) 


• Capacity within buffer (-$100 to $100) 


Issuing loans to unemployed people may also be a violation of responsible lending obligations.  


Even ignoring the possible violation of responsible lending obligations, how is issuing loans to people 


with NEGATIVE capacity to repay not a Ponzi scheme?

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT 


(1) CEO Thomas Beregi is an accountant and is a former CFO of CCP 


Here is what the renowned veteran investor Jim Chanos says about accountants turning CEOs: 


Jim Chanos: Well I’m always wary of accountants who become CEOs too. That’s always a bad 


sign for me. 


Prior to being appointed a CEO of CCP, Thomas Beregi was its CFO. FT summarizes why CFO is generally 


not a good choice for a CEO position: 


The main objection to the apotheosis of the CFO is that he or she doesn’t have the right skill-set 


or characteristics for the top job. Speaking privately, a US bank CEO told me that when 


companies need “creative solutions and marketing approaches, [decisions about] adding or 


discontinuing product lines [or making] acquisitions, [many CFOs] wouldn’t be at the table”.  


Luke Johnson revealed his own selection criteria in a recent column: “I prefer working with 


someone fundamentally conservative. Bullish chief finance officers are dangerous. The leader of 


a business needs to be an optimist, and sales-oriented. But every business needs at least one 


person at the top alongside them to worry about the downside.” 


Source: FT  


(2) CEO Thomas Beregi sits on the board of directors of the Credit and Investment Ombudsman 


Service (CIOS), an organization offering a dispute resolution scheme to assist consumers to resolve 


complaints with participating financial services providers. In our view, sitting on the board of CIOS 


presents a conflict of interest for a CEO of CCP. According to the industry sources, Thomas Beregi uses 


his position at CIOS for the benefit of CCP.

(3) CCP is the largest audit client of Hall Chadwick as measured by market cap 


A large and important audit client may have too much influence over the opinion of a small audit 


company.  


Companies audited by Hall Chadwick with market capitalization over US$ 10M 





Source: CapitalIQ 


(4) Smaller competitors Collection House and Pioneer Credit use Big-4 audit companies KPMG and 


PWC respectively. 


(5) Despite the growing complexity of the business between 2010 and 2017 (launch of lending 


business; entering the US PDL market), audit fees as a share of revenue have materially declined. 


In our view, the declining ratio of audit expense to revenue may indicate that the quality of audit 


services provided by Hall Chadwick has been deteriorating.

VALUATION 


While sell-side analysts prefer to value CCP based on P/E and P/B multiples, we conduct valuation based 


on the combination of discounted cash flows and P/E and P/B multiples. As a result of our analysis, we 


arrived at a target share price of AU$ 10.00 or 47% below the current level. 


DCF valuation 





We assume that CCP will collect its existing PDL book over six years, as after this time the lender loses 


the right to take legal action against the borrower as per Australian legislation (e.g. the debt becomes 


statute-barred or legally unenforceable). Even extending the collection cycle to 10 years and assuming 


2.60x gross money multiple over that period does not change share price target by any material 


magnitude. 


We assumed a conservative IRR of 8%, while IRR implied by the current share price is negative 15%.

Multiple-based valuation 





CCP trades at a substantial premium to peers based on P/B multiple and at a slight premium based on 


P/E multiple. We think CCP should be valued based on the combination of multiples for debt purchasing 


companies AND payday/subprime lenders. For P/E the closest peers among debt purchasers are 


Australian companies Collection House (P/E 12.4x) and Pioneer Credit (P/E 13.7x) with the average P/E 


of 13.1x; among lenders the closest peers are Cash Converters (P/E 8.5x) and Money3 Corp (P/E 10.8x) 


with the average P/E of 9.7x. The combination of these multiples (80% debt purchasing/20% lending as 


per H1 FY 2018 results) gives us a target P/E multiple of 12.4x or a target price of AU$15.50. We note 


that by valuing CCP’s lending business at 9.7x earnings we may be too generous:  


1) in February 2018 it was reported that one of CCP’s key competitors in the payday lending 


industry – Nimble Money – was put up for sale at around 7.0x earnings, without finding a buyer; 


2) As we noted in the section on accounting red flags, the quality of earnings is low.  


For P/B the same approach gives a target P/B multiple of 1.5x or a target share price of AU$ 8.42. 


The average of these three valuations gives us the target price of AU$10.76 vs the current share price 


AU$18.74.
