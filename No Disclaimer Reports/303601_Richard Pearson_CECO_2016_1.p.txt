Summary
In 2014, CEC pulled an accounting gimmick in order to remain “�nancially
responsible” in the eyes of the Department of Education (“ED”).
Calculations indicate that CEC’s failure to sell Le Cordon Bleu will result in its
Composite Score plunging to below 0.7 – deep into the category of “not �nancially
responsible”.
CEC is already on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and is likely to fall into HCM 2,
changing its access to almost $700 million in Title IV funds.
CEC has over $70 million in near term off balance sheet lease liabilities and has
burned over $50 million over the past year – its cash balance is shrinking quickly.
Separately, CEC is facing more than 2 dozen separate investigations and lawsuits
which could potentially result in over $100 million in penalties.

https://moxreports.com/watch-for-a-sharp-drop-in-career-education-corp/ 2/18


In 2014, Career Education Corp. or “CEC” received $695
million in federal funds


(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm#tx824438_25) via
Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Pursuant to the Title IV Program regulations, each eligible higher
education institution must, among other things, satisfy a quantitative standard of �nancial responsibility that is
based on a weighted average of three annual tests (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-
center/school/composite-scores), which assess the �nancial condition of the institution.


For each of 2013 and 2014, CEC scored
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm#tx824438_25) 1.5
out of 3.0, where 1.5 is the bare minimum (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/composite-
scores) score to be deemed “�nancially responsible” and eligible to receive Title IV funds without restriction.


But last year, the only way that CEC was able to maintain this score was by stating its intention to sell its
famed (but failing) culinary school, Le Cordon Bleu. It was an accounting gimmick, which allowed CEC to shift
over $200 million in expenses into discontinued operations
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm#tx824438_25).


However, CEC had already been placed on
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm#tx824438_25) He
Cash Management 1 (“HCM1”) due to administrative concerns raised by the Department of Education over
misrepresentation of placement rates. The HCM status a�ects how and when the funds are disbursed.


It appears that recent �nancial declines, including CEC’s failure to sell its failing Le Cordon Bleu schools, will
now result in CEC falling into the lowest possible category of “not �nancially responsible” and could see the
company downgraded to HCM2.


CEC had warned of this possibility in its risk factors
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm#tx824438_25) in
its most recent 10-K. The company disclosed the failure of the LCB sale in December 2015. But so far, it
appears that no one has performed the detailed calculations, which reveal that the plunge in its Composite
Score has already taken place. The calculation methodology is made public by the Department of Education
such that those who care to make the e�ort can do it themselves before it is disclosed by CEC.


I have performed the calculations and they show that CEC will now fall to a level of 0.646 – well below the
0.90 threshold for “not �nancially responsible.”


Under HCM2, CEC would no longer receive direct Title IV funds and instead would have to use its own cash
to front to students. If this happens, it would be a disaster for CEC and would see enrollments plunge. Again,
last year CEC received $695 million (over 90% of its revenues) from Title IV sources.


CEC does not even remotely have the cash to fund such enrollments. CEC appears to have a total of $185
million in unrestricted cash. This equates to around $2.72 per share in cash, which happens to be right where
the stock trades. Investors are valuing the ongoing business of CEC at zero.


However, short term o� balance sheet lease obligations (within the year) and ongoing cash burn will take net
cash down to around $80 million ($1.20 per share) this year.

I expect the stock to trade at around net cash per share at around $1.20. The primary catalyst for the decline
in the share price would be the disclosure by CEC that it has been deemed “�nancially not responsible” by the
Department of Education. Additional (secondary) catalysts may come in the form of signi�cant legal
settlements from the more than 20 active lawsuits or investigations against CEC.


Background


There was a time when for pro�t education stocks were a veritable gold mine for investors. Aggressive
marketing allowed the companies to grow enrollments at unprecedented rates while Uncle Sam footed the bill
through loans and grants.


But now the party is coming to an ugly end.


Shares of Apollo Education (NASDAQ:APOL (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APOL)) are down by nearly
70% this year. Shares of ITT (NYSE:ESI (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESI)) are down by a similar 70%.
But even those are far better o� than Corinthian Colleges and Education Management Corp., which have
basically gone bust (down 99-100%).


Apollo’s University of Phoenix has been placed on probation (https://seekingalpha.com/news/2820846-for-
pro�t-alert-university-of-phoenix-goes-on-probation-with-the-dod) by the US Department of Defense for
various violations. The US Department of Education enacted a rule (the “gainful employment rule
(http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/for-pro�t-colleges-lose-bid-to-block-u-s-student-loan-
rules)“) which could eliminate government funding to hundreds of thousands of students at underachieving
for-pro�t colleges. The FTC, the OIG, the SEC and dozens of state attorneys general are in the process of
suing or investigating the for-pro�t schools for misrepresenting placement rates. The Department of Education
has also put forth a “90:10” rule (http://ticas.org/content/pub/qa-pro�t-college-), which eliminates Title IV
funding for schools, which receive more than 90% of their funding from Title IV sources. This is a direct shot at
the for pro�t sector.


The point is this:


The for-pro�t education sector has reaped billions of dollars from federal loan and aid programs, even as
completion and job placement rates continue to be dismal. Against this, the for-pro�ts have repeatedly been
found to use marketing tactics, which are overly aggressive and blatantly misleading.


The Feds and the State governments are using a wide variety of legislative tools to clamp down on the
abusive nature of the for-pro�t education sector. We can see from the collapse of Corinthian Colleges
and Education Management that the various governments are not pulling any punches and are
perhaps even looking for ways to curtail the rapid growth of the for-pro�t sector, which includes
shutting these players down altogether.


The focus of this article is on Career Education Corp. or “CEC.” CEC shares are already down by more than
60% for the year, but are likely to fall by another 60% due to recent developments.

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/1/26/4238561-145379043001324_origin.png)


As with the other for-pro�t schools CEC is facing a wave of investigations and lawsuits over deliberate
in�ation of job placement rates (http://www.hu�ingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/career-education-corp-
settlement_n_3782418.html). Only the �rst of these has been settled and that one already cost over $10
million alone. There are more than 20 remaining active suits and investigations against CEC coming from the
FTC, the OIG and more than 20 state governments.


CEC has already disclosed
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm) how recent
legislative changes have forced it to close dozens of its physical schools. As we will see below, the vice
appears to be tightening much more on CEC.


Meanwhile, both the CEO and the CFO recently resigned.


The former CEO was replaced by Todd Nelson who came from both Apollo Education and Education
Management Corp. However, Mr. Nelson has a track record, which is littered with regulatory problems, which
resulted in over $100 million in past �nes and penalties. The state and federal governments are no doubt very
familiar with Mr. Nelson, his companies and their practices.


CEC has a market cap of around $200 million and currently has around $185 million in unrestricted cash
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000156459015009236/ceco-10q_20150930.htm) (around
$2.72 per share) and appears to have no long-term debt. Investors appear to be valuing the business itself at
zero while naively valuing the stock at what appears to be cash per share. SCROLLTO TOP

https://moxreports.com/watch-for-a-sharp-drop-in-career-education-corp/ 5/18


Unfortunately, the fact is that this apparent cash balance is very misleading. What investors have missed is
the fact that CEC has $71 million in short term o� balance sheet liabilities
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000156459015009236/ceco-10q_20150930.htm) this year
due to ongoing lease payments (including from schools being shutdown, such as LCB). The company has
also burned more than $50 million in cash in the past 12 months.


As a result, the real net cash balance for CEC should be viewed at around $80 million, or around $1.20 per
share.


This should all become apparent once the next earnings report is released shortly.


In the past, CEC was a successful operator of online as well as brick-and-mortar schools. But the problem is
that brick and mortar schools are too expensive to operate compared to online only programs.


As a result, in 2014, CEC completed the shut down of 21 of its then physical campuses. It also created a
“transitional group” of 12 more campuses, which are to be shut down by 2017.


In September of 2015, CEC completed the “sale” of its Missouri College campus. However, the company
received no proceeds from this sale, and in fact, it was required to make additional working capital payments
to the “buyer” just to complete the supposed “sale.”


As disclosed (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000156459015009236/ceco-
10q_20150930.htm):


We received no consideration for the sale of Missouri College and recorded a loss on sale of $0.9
million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The terms of the agreement provide that we make
certain working capital payments to the buyer; accordingly, these amounts were included in the loss
calculation.


The point is that CEC literally can’t even give away its assets for free. They have to pay 3rd parties just to give
away the assets.


In December of 2015 (4 weeks ago), CEC announced
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515397730/d62752d8k.htm) that it had failed to
sell its Briarcli� College. As a result, CEC is forced to “teach out” the remaining programs and record a loss of
$6-8 million.


This leaves CEC with its “University Group” (the mostly online programs of Colorado Technical University and
American Intercontinental University) and its “Career Colleges Group” (the 5 physical campus schools which
o�er career training in �elds like healthcare and fashion/interior design).


The majority of CEC students fall within the University Group, where it is now the case that around 90% of the
students are online only.


The latest of its schools to face a shutdown is the famed culinary school Le Cordon Bleu. LCB contributed
$173 million of revenue in 2014 but also generated losses of $67 million
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515404312/d30994d8k.htm). As of Q3,
CEC management seemed con�dent (https://seekingalpha.com/article/3659166-career-educations-ceco-ceo-
ronald-mccray-on-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript)that a sale of LCB could be e�ected, such that the
school could keep running for students without saddling the parent company with the huge ongoing losses.


But now it all hits the fan, because in December 2015 it was announced
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515404312/d30994d8k.htm) that the hoped-for
sale had fallen through and that CEC would instead conduct a “teach out” through 2017. A teach out means

that CEC will continue to run the school and allow current students to �nish their programs, although no new
students will be accepted. The additional drag on cash and earnings (losses) is therefore set to continue for at
least 2 years going forward.


The failed sale could not have come at a worse time for CEC. The company’s �nancials have already
deteriorated to the point where it will be deemed “�nancially irresponsible” by the Department of Education
(“ED”).


The ED makes public its scoring methodology for schools, which wish to participate in the Title IV government
funding program, which funds student loans and grants.


Here is an example calculation as provided by ED
(http://ifap.ed.gov/sfahandbooks/attachments/0304Vol2Ch4FinancialResponsibility.pdf). The purpose is to
illustrate the methodology.

The calculation is somewhat convoluted and involves a number of speci�ed accounting de�nitions.
As a result, it appears that the market has not yet digested the fact that CEC would now be deemed
“�nancially irresponsible” by the ED according to the latest �nancial numbers.


Once the market �gures out this score, the stock price is likely to fall dramatically.


The Composite Scores (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/composite-scores) range from
-1.0 to +3.0. A score of 1.5 to 3.0 means “�nancially responsible” and eligible to receive Title IV funds without
restriction. A score of 1.0 to 1.4 means “in the zone” of �nancial responsibility. “Zone” schools can still
participate but may need to post a large letter of credit and adhere to other restrictions. Schools, which score
below 1.0 are deemed “not �nancially responsible” and must obtain provisional certi�cation and adhere to
certain “cash monitoring” requirements.


Even before the recent problems at CEC and before the failure to sell Le Cordon Bleu, ALL OF CEC’s
SCHOOLS had already been placed on Heightened Cash Management 1
(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/�les/SchoolsonHCM1orHCM2120115.xls) status (“HCM1”). But with
the recent problems, it is also likely to be downgraded further to HCM2.


There is a big di�erence between HCM1 and HCM2.


Academic institutions on HCM1 can still draw down from FSA funds to cover disbursements in largely the
same way as unrestricted schools. But schools on HCM2 are far more restricted.


According to ED (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/hcm):

A school placed on HCM2 no longer receives funds under the Advance Payment Method. After
a school on HCM2 makes disbursements to students from its own institutional funds, a
Reimbursement Payment Request must be submitted for those funds to the Department.


This is crucial. A school, which is placed on HCM2, must front all of the money itself to students and
then try to get reimbursed by the ED after the fact.


HCM2 is a very big deal. Out of the thousands of Title IV schools in the US, only a few dozen
are currently on HCM2
(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/�les/SchoolsonHCM1orHCM2120115.xls).


CEC had already warned investors
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000156459015009236/ceco-10q_20150930.htm) of this
possibility in 3Q 2015:


ED may impose monetary or program level sanctions, impose some period of delay in the Company’s
receipt of Title IV funds or transfer the Company’s schools to the “reimbursement” or Heightened Cash
Monitoring 2 (“HCM2”) methods of payment of Title IV Program funds. While on HCM2 status, an
institution must disburse its own funds to students, document the students’ eligibility for Title IV
Program funds and comply with certain waiting period requirements before receiving such funds from
ED, which results in a signi�cant delay in receiving those funds.


Last year, CEC received $695 million in funds via Title IV out of total revenues of over $741 million.


This would mean that under HCM2, CEC would have to come up with nearly $700 million in cash of its
own to front to students before attempting to get reimbursed by ED. But CEC simply doesn’t have the
money. Without that funding, enrollments would (by necessity) plunge dramatically.


So just how bad are things at CEC? Very bad.


In the past, CEC disclosed (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000156459015009236/ceco-
10q_20150930.htm) that it had received a Composite Score of precisely 1.5 in both 2013 and 2014. In other
words, CEC was already at the lowest level possible to be considered “�nancially responsible.” Given the
obvious deterioration in CEC’s �nances, it should not be surprising that the company has fallen out of the
“�nancially responsible” category.


The timing of last year’s decision to “sell” LCB is notable. By stating just its intention to sell LCB, CEC was
able to shift all of the LCB expenses (over $200 million in 2014) into discontinued operations. This was the
only way that CEC maintained its score of 1.5 (“�nancially responsible”).


CEC went to great lengths
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515075170/d824438d10k.htm) within its
disclosure to describe what would happen if it fell into “the zone” of 1.0-1.4. But the company failed to go into
much detail about what would happen if it fell into the lowest category – i.e. below 1.0.


Below are the calculations performed for the last 12 months as of Q3 2015, which show that CEC now earns a
score of just 0.646. These are my calculations. For the sake of completeness, I have included as an Appendix
the calculations for 2014 and 2015. This just veri�es that this methodology does indeed result in scores of 1.5
for both 2013 and 2014, as disclosed by CEC and as calculated by the Department of Education.


Again, the de�nitions of the accounting terms above (such as adjusted equity, modi�ed equity) can all
be found here (http://www.schev.edu/adminfaculty/iapproval/�nancialcalculation.pdf).

As per the ED, note that the “strength factors” in the calculations are calculated such that they cannot be
greater than 3.0 or less than -1.0. As a result, the Net Income factor is the same (-1.0) in all three years. The
point is that seasonality from using Q3 numbers does not a�ect these calculations. Instead, it is the steep
plunge in equity that has caused the change.

Note: the table above calculates the Composite Score for CEC based on LTM numbers from Q3 2015, with
the assumption that LCB expenses and revenues are added back into continuing operations from
discontinued operations.


As per the 8-K from CEC
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046568/000119312515404312/d30994d8k.htm) dated December
11th, 2015:


LCB contributed $128.2 million and $172.6 million of revenue and ($43.5) million and ($66.6) million of
operating losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31,
2014, respectively. As a result of the decision to teach-out the Le Cordon Bleu campuses, the results
of operations for these campuses will now be reported within continuing operations.


A look at the new CEO


One thing should be jumping out at investors by now: the state and federal governments have the for pro�t
institutions in their sites. Government agencies are aggressively implementing new rules, which are e�ectively
turning o� the federal funding spigot. They are also coming after bad actors with lawsuits and investigations.


Following the resignation of the former CEO and CFO, CEC appointed Todd Nelson as the new CEO in
August of 2015. Nelson had previously served as CEO and Chairman of Apollo Education between 2001 and
2006. He then served as Chairman and CEO of Education Management from 2007 until 2013.


During his 13 years with those predecessors, Nelson amassed a track record, which involves hundreds of
millions worth of �nes paid out by Apollo and Education Management. SCROLL

https://moxreports.com/watch-for-a-sharp-drop-in-career-education-corp/ 11/18


In 2004, Apollo paid what was at the time the largest settlement of its kind for its actions under Nelson after
a review by the U.S. Department of Education
(http://archive.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/0914apollo14.html).


A government review of the University of Phoenix, the country’s largest for-pro�t university, paints a
picture of a school so hungry to enroll new students that it has threatened and intimidated its
recruitment sta� in meetings and e-mail, pressured them to enroll unquali�ed students and covered up
its practices to deceive regulators. In a 45-page report obtained by The Arizona Republic, the U.S.
Department of Education describes corporate culture overly focused on boosting enrollment. The
review, based on site visits and interviews with more than 60 employees and former employees, led to
the largest settlement of its kind last week. The Phoenix-based university agreed to pay $9.8 million
without admitting any wrongdoing.


Nelson left Apollo in 2006, but even 3 years later in 2009, Apollo was forced to pay $78.5 million to settle
Justice Department charges (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/15/apollo) that under Nelson the
company had illegally paid recruiters based on the number of students they enrolled.


And then 9 years after his departure, in 2015, Apollo was forced to pay $13.1 million to settle charges
(http://www.law360.com/articles/624724/u-of-phoenix-parent-drops-13-1m-to-settle-backdating-suit) that
Nelson illegally granted hundreds of millions worth of backdated stock options that helped him sell $82.8
million worth of stock for himself.


In addition, Apollo faces a string of investigations and lawsuits over deceptive marketing and false claims,
which went on during Nelson’s tenure.


Apollo looks like it is going to survive (for now). But things are much worse for Nelson’s former company
Education Management.


In 2015, Education Management agreed to pay (http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/16/pf/college/for-pro�t-college-
edmc-settlement/) $103 million in debt forgiveness to over 80,000 former students to settle charges brought
by 39 state attorneys’ general for practices under Nelson. The wide-ranging charges related to recruiting
practices, false and misleading graduate placement statistics, graduate certi�cation and licensing, and student
lending activities.


In 2014, Education Management settled with San Francisco for $4.4 million for illegal marketing practices
(http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-wins-4-4M-settlement-with-for-pro�t-art-5559635.php) under
Nelson at its Argosy art school.


In 2013, Education Management settled with Colorado’s attorney general for lying under Nelson that the
company was seeking to have Argosy’s psychology program
(http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/argosy.aspx) accredited by the American Psychological Association. It
also misleadingly told psychology students that upon graduation they would be eligible to become licensed
psychologists, which was unlikely.


In 2011, the Justice Department and �ve states sued Education Management under Nelson for lying to
regulators regarding illegal incentive-based payments (http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-�les-complaint-
against-education-management-corp-alleging-false-claims-act-violations)to recruiters based on the number of
students they recruited.


What does this have to do with CEC ?

The regulators and investigators are no doubt familiar with Todd Nelson. Organizations under his command
have already been forced to pay hundreds of millions in penalties for improper actions. Now he is simply
sitting atop a new organization with a litany of legal problems stemming from bad behavior.


CEC’s most recent legal problem comes from a Civil Investigative Demand from the FTC, which the company
received in August of 2015. The investigation regards deceptive marketing or advertising, just like the ones
that took down Education Management with its $103 million payout.


CEC is still under investigation by the Department of Education regarding in�ation of placement rate reporting.


CEC is also under investigation by the OIG regarding its proper or improper administration of Title IV funds,
including how it handles payments with student withdrawals, how it documents attendance with online classes
and how it processes refunds.


CEC also faces multiple suits under the Federal False Claims Act, which state that CEC provided false
certi�cations to the Federal government, causing the Federal government to make improper payments. The
suits each seek treble damages.


Most importantly, CEC faces lawsuits and investigations from 20 di�erent states’ attorneys general regarding
recruitment, placement stats and certi�cations. This is almost identical to what we saw with Education
Management with its $103 million settlement.


Education Management now trades for just 7 cents on almost no volume.

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/1/26/4238561-145379104471941_origin.png)


Conclusion


For the past two years, CEC was just barely able to remain “�nancially responsible” (a score of 1.5 or above)
in the eyes of the Department of Education. Last year, this was only achieved by CEC stating its intention to
sell its Le Cordon Bleu.


However, CEC has consistently demonstrated that it is unable to sell any of its schools. In fact, it has had to
pay money just to give the schools away. Not surprisingly, the supposed sale of LCB fell through. This means
that over $200 million of expenses will come back into continuing operations, which has a heavy impact on
CEC’s Composite Score with the Department of Education.


Losses have continued to mount, while CEC’s cash balance has continued to shrink.


According to the methodology provided by the Department of Education, the failure to sell LCB combined with
ongoing deteriorating �nancial results as of Q3 would now result in a composite score of well below 0.90. In
other words, CEC would now be categorized as “not �nancially responsible” – by a wide margin.


CEC has already been placed on Heightened Cash Management 1 (“HCM1”) status for “administrative
reasons.” Because of the “not �nancially responsible” designation, the Department of Education would now
have ample justi�cation to classify CEC as HCM2. If CEC falls into HCM2, it would no longer receive Title IV
funds in advance. Instead, it would need to front up to $700 million of cash, which it does not have.

CEC’s cash balance is being rapidly consumed by over $70 million in short term o� balance sheet lease
obligations (due within the year) as well as over $50 million in cash burn over the past year.


Separately, CEC faces dozens of investigations and lawsuits. The �rst of these alone was settled for over $10
million. CEC’s new CEO, Todd Nelson, presided over two competitors who paid hundreds of millions in
penalties for their actions during his tenure. The regulators are no strangers to the CEO and haven’t been shy
about handing down massive penalties.
