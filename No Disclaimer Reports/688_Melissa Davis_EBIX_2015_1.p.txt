Ebix Inc: Taking A Premature Bow For An Overhyped Business Deal
May 5, 2015 9:30 AM ET48 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Ebix owes up to $160 million of its lofty market value to an overhyped business deal
that’s almost bound to disappoint bullish investors once they discover the truth.


That shaky deal calls for Ebix to provide the London insurance market with an
electronic trading platform that’s unwanted by many of those who must agree to
cover the bill.


Even if the market decides to give Ebix a chance, the company will likely wait years
before it generates enough e-trading business to start bragging about any outsized
paychecks.


With its current e-trading platform severely outdated, Ebix might need to build a
modern system from scratch after losing the visionary experts who seem best-
equipped to attempt that formidable task.


Ebix better finish that demanding project in a hurry, too, since its rivals have refused
to politely concede defeat and rushed to further expand their own e-trading
businesses instead.


Ebix (NASDAQ: EBIX) can probably forget about making a quick buck - let alone actually
striking it rich - on a celebrated business deal that's widely regarded by investors as an
absolute gold mine.


Despite all of the hype surrounding its successful bid to provide the London insurance
market with a fancy electronic trading platform, Ebix still needs to wait and see if the
funding for that project actually materializes before it can safely bank on even a modest
paycheck for its services. More than two full months after its stock exploded on news of its
winning bid - adding $160 million to its market value in a matter of days - Ebix remains in a
state of limbo, so to speak, at the mercy of London brokers and underwriters who might
feel understandably reluctant to finance an electronic placing system that many of them
don't even want.

Just ask Roger Foord, a well-connected industry consultant who has spent decades
focused on the London insurance market and enjoys ready access to many of the highest-
ranking executives in the field.


"There's no way Ebix is suddenly going to make millions of pounds on this," Foord bluntly
declared a few weeks ago. "It's worth absolutely zilch right now.


"I was at Lloyd's today, and nobody's even thinking about electronic trading," he
emphasized. "Nobody wants it. (SO) it's not going to happen."


No wonder Ebix refuses to share any concrete details about that shaky deal.


While Ebix has blamed its silence on a strict confidentiality agreement that it apparently
intends to honor forever, since the CEO basically said that any clues about the projected
value of that project (or even the likely start date for the job) would need to come from the
opposite party, the company must feel pretty clueless itself. Ebix would probably love to
brag about the bundle that it stands to make on that deal if the company knew that it
safely could.


"Until the money is in place, it's a rather hollow victory," noted one of several well-informed
industry sources who volunteered information for this revealing investigative report. "It's
hard to get people to put money into anything. And that's actually quite a hard sell … It's
by no means a done deal."


Shame on Ebix for keeping its mouth shut while hopeful shareholders anxiously wait in
vain for imminent news of a gigantic contract.


When Ebix proudly confirmed that it had won the bid to supply the e-trading platform
requested by Private Placement Limited (PPL) - a special-purpose entity formed by
London market reformers to pursue a single e-placing solution for all - the company
probably should have mentioned that PPL lacks the financial resources to cover that big-
ticket project on its own. Rather, PPL merely hopes that market players will come together
and provide enough support for the "collective purchase" of a modern e-trading platform
instead. It still needs the industry leaders who back its cause to persuade a whole bunch
of individual brokers and underwriters to actually foot the bill.


Since most of those firms have refused to even use e-placing systems financed by others
in the past, including a notoriously expensive failure pursued by none other than mighty
Lloyd's of London itself, PPL better make sure that its industry representatives come up
with an irresistible sales pitch. If PPL wants London brokers and underwriters to cough up
millions of pounds just to build that platform - never mind the "$10 million-plus" that Wall

Street fantasizes Ebix collecting for its future services every year - it might as well go
ahead and prepare itself for a somewhat frosty reception. Just think of the likely sticker
shock.


Generously assuming that Ebix ultimately receives enough money to move forward and
makes enough progress to stick with a schedule that PPL openly regards as tight,
however, the company still wouldn't see its e-trading platform achieve full-scale operations
until the second half of next year. So even under a best-case scenario, Ebix could find
itself waiting quite some time for a decent paycheck.


"This is going to be a long, long process," predicted an industry source who has kept a
close eye on the situation. "The revenue stream to Ebix will be very small and slow to
speed up … The only way this would make the company's earnings go up this year is if
the London market gave them $5 million right now, and I just can't see that happening."


Ebix did not respond to questions for this story.


Waiting on the Sidelines while Rivals Continue to Make Gains


To be sure, the rival firm that competed against Ebix for that big project hardly seems
willing to abandon its own e-placing business and helplessly surrender in defeat.


A well-established competitor with a number of other electronic-based services already on
the market at this point, Xchanging has continued to lure new customers to its own e-
placing system while Ebix itself remains stuck on the sidelines waiting for some distant
chance to steal the show. No sooner had Ebix declared victory by officially confirming that
PPL had favored its proposal, in fact, than Xchanging proceeded to announce some fairly
impressive news of its own. Barely one month after Ebix trumpeted that big win,
Xchanging issued a press release proclaiming that the initial adoption rate for its global
reinsurance placing system had "exceeded all expectations" by swiftly attracting
customers in more than 70 markets around the globe.


"Xchanging has invested significant time and effort to ensure that globalREmarket
becomes the tool of choice for reinsurance deal distribution," the company declared, "and
believes its simplicity of use has been instrumental in securing immediate buy-in from the
broker and carrier communities."


The first brokerage firm to give globalREmarket a chance, TigerRisk has by now already
decided to conduct all of its placing business exclusively on that electronic platform. After
throwing its full support behind the system, TigerRisk confidently predicted a "significant

increase in reinsurance markets coming online" as the firm drives more and more traffic to
the platform by relying exclusively on the system to help process all of its future deals.


The Insurance Workplace (TIW), a firm that partnered with Xchanging to compete for the
PPL deal that Ebix recently won, seems determined to keep on growing its e-placing
business as well. Hoping to take advantage of a welcome head-start, TIW plans to keep
on courting new customers - and aims to hook them on its own e-placing services - before
Ebix gets a chance to launch its proposed e-trading platform.


"We have our own placing solution in use by a number of brokers, which we believe is
superior in many ways to their offering," TIW Chief Executive Officer David Edwards
recently proclaimed. "We are not going anywhere, and will continue to develop our
portfolio of electronic trading solutions for our clients in London and around the world."


"I do understand that the Ebix solution is now a complete rewrite," Edwards noted, "which
will hopefully give us the opportunity to continue to grow our market share."


For its part, Xchanging acts almost as if Ebix never even secured the PPL deal at all.
When Xchanging issued its most recent quarterly update in mid-April, for example, the
company not only reiterated its commitment to modernizing the London insurance market
but also highlighted its ongoing investment in the projects that it has pursued, along with
its technology partners, to help further that cause.


To its credit, a past interview with the company shows, Xchanging spent a lot of time
studying all of the e-placing services that the London insurance market had invariably
rejected over the years before the company even tried to design a new e-trading platform
that might stand a legitimate chance. By the time that Xchanging finished its homework,
the company felt thoroughly convinced that the market would refuse to adopt any e-
placing service that required brokers and/or underwriters to dramatically change their
ways. So Xchanging deliberately refrained from pursuing an expansive system like the
one that Lloyds had introduced to the market - a bold experiment that evolved into a
notorious $120 million failure - and settled on a much simpler e-placing solution instead.


"Cultural change needs to happen in gradual steps, and the technology must be designed
in a way that does not require too much cultural change to occur too quickly," the
managing director of Xchanging explained in a candid interview with an industry journal
early last year. "I believe it will take about five years for the technology to reach a
reasonable scale and adoption rate - and then five to 10 years for reasonable change to
begin to take shape within the industry."

So much for Ebix making a fortune on its overhyped PPL deal any time soon. The
company might need to wait an entire decade - an eternity by Wall Street standards - for
its proposed e-trading platform to achieve widespread acceptance, if that elaborate
system ever wins over the rigid London insurance market at all.


In a wildly lucrative industry where operating expenses often hover in the low single digits
and profits can reach into the billions, one market insider explained, companies see little
reason to waste time and money on complicated technology that - even with plenty of
effort - might lower their costs by a measly 1% at the absolute best.


"There's no urgency," Foord agreed. "There are 5,000 people at Lloyd's who are happy
with the way that they're doing things. If you found one who wants this (new e-trading
platform), I would be really impressed."


Mistaking a Discarded Antique for Modern Technology


Maybe Ebix really did start out by pitching its current e-placing system for free, as Foord
and his industry contacts highly suspect, only to find its offer soundly rejected due to the
"inept" performance of its antiquated technology.


To be sure, Ebix seemed to scale back its expectations for the acquisition target that
supplied the company with its e-trading platform in a pretty big hurry. When Ebix inherited
that outdated relic by purchasing Qatarlyst a couple of years ago, it practically came right
out and said that it had acquired the firm to gain handy access to the London insurance
market and compete for the looming PPL deal. While Ebix promised to reward Qatarlyst
with generous "earn-out" payments if it achieved future revenue targets extending through
the end of 2016, however, the company had already reversed a big chunk of the reserves
that it initially established to cover those potential bonuses - conveniently boosting the
profits that it reported to Wall Street in the process - by the time that it officially won the
PPL bid.


By then, Ebix must have realized that it had inherited an e-trading platform so far behind
the times that it would probably need to build a new one from scratch. Even the visionary
pioneer who presided for years over the firm that originally launched that e-placing system
now considers the platform virtually beyond repair.


"What you are looking at here is a platform that was built on an architecture designed in
2001 with an application manager at its core that is now out of step with the modern
technology frameworks," said Alex Letts, who served as the CEO of RI3K until Qatarlyst
purchased the company. "The market needs to give Ebix a mandate to build a platform for

the future that will suit everybody in five years time … The mistake will be to persist with
just the old technology and create an increasing tangle of legacy spaghetti that will have
escalating costs and decreasing business benefit in direct proportion.


"That is the path to perdition."


Losing Critical Talent in a Lengthy Parade Out the Door


Too bad Ebix lost the very experts who seem best equipped to pull off such a challenging
project. Ebix sure could use the expertise of those RI3K/Qatarlyst veterans - including the
trio of accomplished leaders who bailed at first chance - right now.


Take Robin Merttens, the founding chief operating officer of RI3K and former market place
director of Qatarlyst, just for starters. After co-founding RI3K with Letts and designing its
original e-trading platform at the dawn of the century, Merttens oversaw the evolving
technology and the services that it delivered to a growing population of customers in the
decade that followed. In the end, he would manage to win over even a pair of industry
giants - negotiating deals with both Aon and Marsh - although the latter (a gigantic
brokerage firm) swiftly cancelled its service a few months after Ebix purchased Qatarlyst
and took control of its e-trading platform.


"The UK arm of the broking heavyweight completed a trial of the platform last year in what
appeared to be a major breakthrough for Qatarlyst," The Insurance Insider noted at the
time. But "Marsh has stopped using the Qatarlyst electronic placing platform while a
London market body undertakes due diligence on the platform and its new owner Ebix, the
scandal-struck US technology firm" - then a fresh target of government authorities and still
a lightning rod for suspicion to this very day.


Once Ebix entered the picture, Merttens soon bolted as well. Loyal for more than a
decade until then, Merttens had stuck around after RI3K sold itself to Qatarlyst and his
fellow co-founder retired to leave him in charge of running the show. When Ebix
purchased the company a few years later, however, Merttens must have felt desperate to
start packing his bags. Within a couple of months, he split to work for himself as an
industry consultant and left behind the e-trading platform that he had nurtured throughout
most of his professional career.


Two other noteworthy veterans soon followed him out the door. Arriving at RI3K right after
it opened its doors back in the year 2000, Kelly Fegan initially handled the legal and
compliance department for the young firm before ascending to become managing director
of the entire company. Together with Merttens, he landed the prominent Aon account and

signed on hundreds of smaller underwriting firms in dozens of countries all over the world.
Another dedicated servant who remained at the firm after its sale to Qatarlyst in 2010,
Fegan served as the director of client services - handling everything from business
development to sales and contract negotiation to training and user support - during the
final three years of his lengthy tenure at the company.


With Ebix in charge and Merttens gone in a hurry, however, Fegan decided to hit the door
months before he even landed a new job. In a matter of weeks, former RI3K Chief
Information Officer and Qatarlyst Chief Product Officer Ian Meadows rushed to join the
parade.


Shooting for the Stars while Running on Fumes


All told, official regulatory filings show, Qatarlyst shed almost three-quarters of its entire
workforce the year that Ebix purchased the company. Qatarlyst lost its Big Four auditors
that year, too, with KPMG resigning and Ebix somehow locating an obscure firm stuck in a
row of dreary retail shops to verify the company's financial statements instead.


Those numbers look pretty pathetic. Despite an 80% jump in revenue during 2013,
Qatarlyst still mustered less than 3 million pounds in total sales - while burning more than
16 million pounds in cash on its business operations - and ended yet another year in the
red. While Qatarlyst lost far less money than usual, the company also cut its workforce to
the bone and slashed it budget for everything from advertising to auditing fees.


With Ebix so busy cutting corners, the company must have lost track of all the Qatarlyst
employees who no longer appear on its payroll. Go to the Qatarlyst website and look at
the contact page. Of the three managers listed, only one of them actually still works at the
company. The other two (the first previously in charge of client services, the second of
training and support) vacated their positions - with the big PPL project officially still out for
bid - before the end of last year.


If Ebix can't even update its own website, how on earth does the company expect to
provide the busy London insurance market with a sophisticated e-trading platform
impressive enough to succeed where others have inevitably failed? Never mind that Ebix
inexplicably rushed to gut Qatarlyst - leaving the firm with a skeleton crew stripped of its
most valuable talent - before it ever volunteered to tackle that ambitious project. With so
much at stake, Ebix might want to pray for a miracle while the London insurance market
decides whether it should trust the company with a generous handout or not.
