How the Volkswagen Scandal PROVES 
Citron’s Analysis of Mobileye 


. 
Citron Lowers Near Term Target to $20:  See GPRO and AMBA 





The biggest story in the business world over the past week has been Volkswagen’s emissions 
cheating scandal.  But the analysis has been overlooked by the media.  The looming question 
not dissected in the press, nor answered by the automotive markets analyst community is not 
WHAT Volkswagen did … but WHY did they do it? 
 


All you have to know was explained by Michael Cusumano, Distinguished Professor of 
Management at the Sloan School of Management and the MIT Engineering Systems Division, 
former Editor-in-Chief and Chairman of the Sloan Management Review, when he recently 
commented: 
 


 
http://qz.com/507761/theres-a-very-simple-reason-why-no-carmaker-can-seem-to-rule-the-industry-for-long/ 





This disastrous conspiratorial decision by Volkswagen top management was simply a reflection 
of the brutal competitive realities of the auto industry -- notorious for razor thin margins and 
withering competition -- shaving profits throughout the supply chain -- to the point where 
almost anyone or anything can become collateral damage. 
 


Does this seem like an industry that will EVER tolerate Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) maintaining 
EBIDTA margins of 60% until 2025, while EVERY tech supplier to the auto supply chain struggles 
to post 10%?  There is one analyst on Mobileye who at least acknowledges this risk: 
  





“The auto supply chain structure may ultimately turn from being a positive to a negative 
for Mobileye.  We believe these supplier partners have ample time to invest in similar 
technologies to bridge technology gaps. Further, given that these systems are often being 
provided by suppliers with massive incumbent footprints in the vehicle, competitors could 
certainly become more price aggressive. Finally, OEMs do not like to sole-source, which 
could limit Mobileye’s pricing leverage.”        -- Pacific Crest Analyst's Note on Mobileye  
 


“No one is putting a gun to their head to compel this bad behavior … Yet it’s 
difficult to make money otherwise. … It’s hard to increase market share. Profit 
margins are tight.” 


Michael Cusumano, professor at Sloan Business School,  


the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Anatomy of the Automotive Supply Chain  


 
(Click to enlarge) 


 
The bulk of Mobileye's volume will never come from selling product direct to automakers. Their  
ADAS system-on-a-chip is sold predominantly to Tier 1 suppliers who integrate it with their own 
modules to create ready-to-install components in a car on an assembly line.   
 


These same Tier 1 suppliers are also Mobileye’s direct competitors (see references to Denso, 
Bosch, and Continental below.)  The Volkswagen debacle kills the theory that Mobileye can 
sustain monopoly-level margins and massive growth at the same time….  This industry is ALL 
about saving money wherever it is possible and looking for every angle every year, every day. 
 


The same Pac Crest analyst understood this point enough to write: 
 





http://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Mobileyes+(MBLY)+Valuation+Rich,+Pacific+Crest+Starts+at+Sector+Weight/10554724.html 





"We believe that expecting Mobileye to improve its leverage with tier-1 supplier partners 
in the future assumes that tier-1 suppliers' ADAS investments will not be successful. Not a 
great bet, in our view. Mobileye has quietly lost two partners in the past year (Autoliv 
and Gentex), with others working on their own in-house developments."

Citron on Volkswagen and Mobileye September 24,2015 Page 3 of 10 





Absurd:  Mobileye, a Supplier to the Auto Industry, is 
making Qualcomm’s 1999 valuation blush ... 
 


Citron believes Mobileye is the most overpriced tech stock (in the billions) in the Nasdaq’s 
history.  We are aware this statement sounds like an overreach, but our analysis confirms that 
is the truth ... and it's not even close.  
 


For those of you who faced the 1999 stock market, Qualcomm, the mother of all fabless 
semiconductor companies, is etched in our brains. The stock went completely parabolic nutso 
for the whole year as the world absorbed the game-changing potential of their technology and 
the patent moat they had built around it.  Forget about ADAS – this was the cell phone and 


wireless technologies…. IT WAS BEYOND HUGE.  All of this unfolded amidst a massive 
tech and internet stock bubble. But during this whole interval, Qualcomm never 
even came close to being as overvalued as Mobileye now is … not even by half 
or a third.   





While not fabless, but still semiconductor, note that Intel never traded higher than 14.3x sales 
at Apr 1, 2000….the absolute peak, all the while the market was lit up by the imminent 
appearance of a computer in every home.
Citron on Volkswagen and Mobileye September 24,2015 Page 4 of 10 





Citron will explain below how this turned out for Qualcomm – as we describe exactly how it will 
end for Mobileye.  Trust us, it didn’t turn out any better for Intel.  





Despite becoming a legitimate 15+ year success story, continuing to innovate and hold its lead 
in the cell-phone ASIC industry, Qualcomm stock never recovered the highs of that period (even 
on a dividend-adjusted basis.)    To this day, Intel remains below half its peak valuation of 2000.   
 


This demonstrates a tech company with unassailable accomplishments and an unparalleled 
record of execution dominating its space always presents the risk for investors of never 
recovering the valuation from its "hype phase".   
 


So how exaggerated were Qualcomm’s metrics at the height of its run and afterward?  And how 
do these compare to Mobileye's at the present time, and in the analyst models for the next 15 
years?

Historical EBIT for Qualcomm  (adjusted for licensing rev) 





Throughout its entire history, despite its unique IP technology for cell phones, Qualcomm never 
notched EBIT margins over 40%, and ultimately couldn't sustain anything over the 20%'s.   
 


To compare to Mobileye, we begin at 2013, when the company turned profitable.  Notice now 
Morgan's EBIT estimates soar above 50% -- a level Qualcomm never achieved, and never 
return to earth below 50% ever again, even through 2029… according to Morgan Stanley’s 
crystal ball.

Citron’s Response to the Mobileye Analysts:  Morgan 
Stanley proves themselves Wrong. 
Since the initial Citron report on MBLY was presented, we have reviewed responses from 
Barclays, Citi and even a conference call from Morgan Stanley with great interest.  We could 
write 30 pages tearing apart the research from these firms, detailing why it is devoid of any 
intellectual honesty, and making examples of recent similar analyst hype-phase disasters like 
Mellanox and DDD.  But we do not want to bore our readers. We are open to a debate on the 
topic with any of those analysts anytime. Instead, we will focus on the one firm considered the 
“hammer” in Mobileye, and PROVE the lack of integrity in the research: Morgan Stanley.

Qualcomm EBIT as a % of Revenues
Citron on Volkswagen and Mobileye September 24,2015 Page 6 of 10 





In part 1, Citron referenced a Blue Paper -- penned by Morgan Stanley just eight months before 
MBLY's IPO --on the future of autonomous driving.  There was virtually no notice given to 
Mobileye.  Than the IPO comes and now Morgan Stanley (after a few banking fees) is the blind 
cheerleader. 
 


Citron presents some chronology of the M.S. research and the basis behind the current price 


targets that are going to make the analyst wish he could channel the late, great Yogi Berra, and 


utter:   “I never said most of the things I said…” 


Hello Ravi! 


One year ago, Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley’s  MBLY analyst, held this CNBC 
interview.  Contrary to all of his recent research, Ravi stated that he 
assumes Mobileye’s margins would erode, that competitors would enter the 
space, and that the next 18 months would be pivotal for assessing whether 
Mobileye could maintain market share with its technology.  





He had a $46 target on Mobileye at the time. 
 


He identified 3 key points that were a risk to the complete Mobileye story.  Let’s evaluate how 
these key indicators turned out:   
 


Ravi #1: “Mobileye claims to have 80% or 90% of the [ADAS] market, Continental and Bosch 
have the rest.  Those two are going with stereo systems.  We don’t believe they are coming in 
with a mono camera just yet. “ 
 


Sorry Ravi:  Continental’s mono camera component was released in early 2015.  
http://www.continental-
automotive.com/www/automotive_de_en/themes/commercial_vehicles/chassis_safety/adas/
product_portfolio/multi_function_mono_camera_mfc400_en.html 
 


Ravi #2 and #3:  “if they lock up Volkswagen and Toyota, two of the biggest automakers in the 
world, it's going to be hard for others to break in. “ 
 


Sorry Ravi:   Toyota.  In December 2014, Toyota disclosed their sensors for automatic braking, 
and sure enough, they are based on Denso’s module for mid-range cars and Continental’s 
monofocus camera at the low end.

0.htm  
 


Sorry Ravi  Volkswagen.  Much has been made of Mobileye’s inclusion in Volkswagen’s FAST 
program.  However, the reality is that Bosch, already an award winning VW supplier with over 
2,000 ADAS engineers, and already deeply entrenched in VW’s supply chain, supplies a radar-
based AEB system to Volkswagen for the Golf, that has proved to reduce insurance claims for 
3


rd
 party injury claims dramatically, and will cover all VW's US models in 2016.   Other than that 


… good luck squeezing big profits out of VW.

Despite the failure of his three key leverage points of 2014 Ravi has the cohones to actually 
upgrade the stock in 2015 with assumptions that make Citron almost embarrassed to repeat. 
 


As he states in his most recent note he publishes a model justifying a target nearly doubled 
from just a year ago, that projects gross profit margins unprecedented in the semiconductor 
industry, or more importantly the automobile industry … extended out to 2025 and beyond.   
 


Someone should show this model to the people at Volkswagen.  We are sure they can use a 
good laugh about now 
 


The analysts might know how to write about a semiconductor company or an automotive 
supplier but they certainly have no idea how any of this could possibly be executed.   
 


Because Morgan Stanley knows the valuation is so absurd the analyst was forced to note: 
 





He states the only way to judge the company is CAGR, which is an obviously misleading number 
because it is notoriously difficult to maintain revenue growth rates as small revenue numbers 
become large. (Mobileye’s current revenue run rate is just breaking through $50 million per 
quarter!  Where are the billions?  2020?  2025?) 
 


He identifies Mobileye as the 2nd highest CAGR in his coverage group, and uses #1 -- Twitter -- 
to justify his logic.   It should be noted that Twitter is down over 50% since he put out this 
research… so much for his CAGR. 
 





We believe a long-and-fat-tailed story like MBLY cannot be valued using multiples on 
near-term earnings.  Numbers through 2017-18 do not come close to reflecting the 
true earnings potential fo the stock, in our view... We believe there is no direct comp 
to Mobileye.   


-- Ravi Shenker, Morgan Stanley Lead Analyst 
April 15, 2015 Update

Mobileye's Tale of Ownership Structure  
 


Retail investors should heed that Mobileye has the lowest institutional ownership (58%) of any 
fabless chip manufacturer of size.  The last time we noted this dynamic was when Ambarella 
(AMBA) was trading at $110 a share.  http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mbly/institutional-holdings 
 


And yet, consensus analyst’s targets are 40% higher than Mobileye's current market price.  
Obviously, institutional investors aren't fooled by the lure of a "huge upside"... so you have to 
ask yourself, who is the sucker at this table?  
 


Compare this to NVidia, who no one will argue is a direct competitor to Mobileye. The two 
companies have skirmished publicly over their respective technology claims as competitors 
commonly do.  The consensus analyst price targets on nVidia are ($23.84), appx 1.5% above 
current stock price yet institutional ownership is over 85%. 
 


The Third Rail 
 


In all of the analyst reports, not one noted the extreme insider selling and the absence of 
commitment to R&D.  These two numbers are the cornerstone of the company’s commitment 
to the future.  Mobileye went to Wall St for two stock offerings, raising $1.8 billion.  Of this, 
$1.6 billion went to insiders and only $200 million went in the company.  Now, the analysts 
want investors to believe that MBLY can dominate a new, hotly contested, highly technology-
driven industry, and maintain record margins with only token R&D spend. Mobileye is somehow 
going to grow margins and revenues without ever having to make a dedicated commitment to 
R&D!   
 


From the Morgan Stanley model on Mobileye: Projected Percent of Revenue Spend for R&D: 





Chew on this - if Mobileye spends on R&D as per Morgan Stanley estimates, and insiders never 
cash out even a single additional share of stock, then the amount they just cleared from insider 
sales will exceed the company’s aggregate R&D spend – not just for the company's disclosed 
history (2011), but through its future until 2029.   
 
And for those who believe the R&D is not necessary to maintain leadership in the 
semiconductor industry just follow the leader- look at how absolutely stupid these charts look 
next to one another.

. 


Now let's look at the track record of Qualcomm's R&D spend.  Once its revenues flowed into 


the billions (appx 1998-99), it was compelled to ratchet up R&D – sustainably.   








( * Morgan Stanley’s Mobileye Model through 2029) 
 


      Citron KNOWS How this will end 
 


There are only 2 scenarios for how this will end.  We base this on a historical analysis of 20 
years of top tier technology companies to conclude that NO technology company has ever 
maintained the nosebleed valuations with which Mobileye is now anointed, while Wall Street 
gifts them an incredible 10 or 15 years to grow into themselves.   NOT ONE.  Is Mobileye really 
the greatest technology story every?? 
 
 


Here's the future and you heard it from Citron. 
 


Short term, there will be a piece of news that sends this stock dramatically lower.  It could be a 
loss of a RFQ, comments or a product introduction from a competitor, a wake up call to an 
analyst, or as simple as a general market decline. Once this happens, the stock will no longer 
become a market darling and investors and analysts will be forced to rethink their position.

Mobileye R&D as a % of Revenue
Citron on Volkswagen and Mobileye September 24,2015 Page 10 of 10 








Best Case Scenario:  Mobileye becomes as relevant to automotive technology as Qualcomm is 
to cell phones. It executes on all cylinders while hitting all numbers (as unrealistic as they are) 
while keeping costs low.  If MBLY is in fact the next QCOM than it should be able to continue to 
put up growth and eventually get back to its current market price in around 10 years ... Note: 
This took QCOM 15 years.  Intel never made it... and neither did Microsoft or Oracle, either.  
 
Other than Best Case Scenario:  Once the stock, declines people start questioning the complete 
lunacy of the bull case and the stock quickly trades to what is just an expensive fabless 
semiconductor company in the $20-$25 range.  It will face increased competition and margin 
compression like every other industry in the world, and will end up in a few years at multiples 
similar to NVDA or Freescale, and trade in the single digits….and there it will sit...for years.  
 


Conclusion that all shareholders must read for themselves. 
 


If you are a shareholder in Mobileye, you have to go to sleep at night believing at its current 
valuation that you own the most perfect technology company that has ever existed.   Not 
Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Qualcomm or Intel have EVER traded even close to these 
valuations -- even during the dot com boom -- without collapsing. 
 


No semiconductor company in HISTORY has every maintained margins and market share that 
the analysts have conferred upon Mobileye -- through 2025 and even 2029.  You have to buy 
the notion that they can maintain this powerful control of their market niche not just for years, 
but for decades, as a supplier to one of the most cost-sensitive and price-cutthroat businesses 
in the world:  the automotive business. 
 


To make it crazier, you must go to sleep knowing that Mobileye is going to be able to maintain 
this advantage while spending a drastically lower percentage of their revenue on research and 
development than any of the aforementioned companies ever did.   
 


All this blind faith, while knowing that insiders have been selling their stock at an 


unprecedented pace -- 85% of the money raised from stock sales has been to enrich insiders, 
not build company coffers for the battles ahead. 
 


To Citron, believing the analyst targets on Mobileye sounds like the financial 
version of locking yourself in the garage with the motor running -- in a 
Volkswagen Diesel.
