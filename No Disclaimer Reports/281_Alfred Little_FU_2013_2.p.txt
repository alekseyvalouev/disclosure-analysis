FAB Universal: Management Caught Red-Handed Covering Up Piracy

On Monday, November 18th, 2013, my investigators caught FAB Universal's
(NYSEMKT:FU) Chinese management in the act as they attempted a full-scale cover-up of
the pirated U.S. movies on FAB's kiosks. In today's report, I present "before" and "after"
videos of FAB's Beijing kiosks documenting the removal of the pirated U.S. movies. My
investigators interviewed FAB's kiosk operators and discovered that FAB was removing all
of the pirated U.S. movies over anti-piracy concerns after FAB's "copyright licenses had
expired." What a convenient coincidence!


Where did all the $0.13 Pirated U.S. Recently Released Movies Go?


Prior to the publication of my report, FAB's Beijing kiosks were loaded with pirated recently
released U.S. movies. On November 6th, 2013, my investigators filmed this video
recording of all of the movies available for download from FAB's 5C Intelligent Media kiosk
at its Dong Fang Yin Zuo (Oriental Ginza Mall) location (东直门外大街48号东方银座商场3
层). The following sample screen-shots highlight a selection of over 50 pirated U.S.
movies FAB offered on this kiosk prior to the publication of my report:

Good-Bye Pirated U.S. Movies, Hello Breakdancing!


On Monday, November 18th, 2013, my investigator returned to visit the FAB Beijing Hui
Long Guan Wan Yi department store kiosk and discovered that FAB management had
deleted all the pirated U.S. movies as well as many of the Chinese movies. The staff
explained that due to anti-piracy concerns in China, FAB had recently removed all the U.S.
movies from its kiosks, claiming that FAB's "copyright licenses had expired." What a
convenient coincidence: FAB's U.S. film distribution rights expired simultaneous with
publication of my report!


On Tuesday, November 19th, 2013, my investigator returned to visit the Dong Fang kiosk
and found that FAB had similarly removed all of the pirated U.S. movies and many of the
Chinese movies. A video recording of the revised list of movies available for download
from the kiosk can be seen here. The video clearly shows the complete removal of all the
U.S. movies (as well as UK and Canadian movies). The following screen-shots from the
video show the complete removal of all the pirated movies which were replaced with old
Chinese, yoga, and instructional dance videos. In the absence of pirated copies of cool
movies like Iron Man, Man of Steel, and Skyfall, will FAB customers and franchisees really
want to continue spending millions of dollars on FAB's kiosk business model?

I challenged FAB in my November 14th, 2013 report to publish the complete addresses of
all of its approximately 4,000 purported kiosks in Beijing so that investors and researchers
could independently confirm their existence. FAB has failed to provide this list.


FAB management has now been caught, red-handed, conducting a full-scale cover-up of
its pirated movie business. Without pirated content FAB's $0.13 per movie download
franchised kiosk business will collapse. Thousands of franchisees will soon be demanding
their "guaranteed minimum" return on investment. This scheme will soon implode.


Disclosure: I am short FU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.
