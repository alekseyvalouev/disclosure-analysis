Hexindai = Fraud 





We believe that Hexindai has executed a fraud using fabricated financial statements to siphon all of its cash 


from the pockets of Unites States investors into the hands of China-based Hexindai insiders. 





In our experience, when revenues are fake, profits are fake, transaction volumes are fake, and cash is fake, minority 


shareholders are victims of a financial crime which coincides with a worthless stock. 





Hexindai Inc. (US: HX) (“Hexindai” or the “Company”) operates an online consumer finance marketplace facilitating 


peer-to-peer (“P2P”) lending between borrowers and investors in the PRC. With China’s consumer lending market 


estimated to grow at a CAGR of 49% from 2016 to 2020 and investor demand high, Hexindai completed a US$50 


million Nasdaq initial public offering (“IPO”) equity listing in November 2017.  





Evidence from local PRC filings, including Credit Reports and annual filings of Hexindai’s most significant guarantee 


insurance supplier, suggests to us that Hexindai lied in its Prospectus about the size and scale of its operations during 


its track record period to attract capital from US investors.  Established in 2014, we estimate that Hexindai overstated 


its cumulative profits since inception by 1,343% and overstated its cumulative revenues since inception by 


195%!  





In its Prospectus, Hexindai claimed that it was going to use its IPO proceeds to grow and invest in its core business, 


an online consumer marketplace where borrowers are lent cash from independent lenders, not cash from Hexindai.  


However, once the IPO proceeds were deposited into its accounts, Hexindai immediately decided to change its use of 


the cash proceeds.  Cash exited the business via a special dividend to shareholders (mostly insiders) and with Hexindai 


unexpectedly launching a direct lending business of unsecured loans nearing ~US$ 1 million in size to a few hundred 


Chinese individuals and/or businesses. We believe that the US$ 43 milion in net cash proceeds is gone, and we 


suspect all of it went to China-based insiders who live outside the jurisdictional reach of the United States.   


 
As part of our diligence, we opened accounts on Hexindai’s online marketplace to confirm the user experience with what 


Hexindai described to investors.  In January 2019, we spoke with Hexindai IR who confirmed to us that Hexindai is 


processing new borrower loans and that Changan is still providing default risk guarantee insurance for Hexindai’s platform 


lenders.  Both of these statements are lies. As of today, Hexindai borrowers can no longer access Hexindai’s online 


marketplace borrower app and Hexindai’s default risk insurance partner has been forced to stop underwriting P2P guarantee 


insurance since December 17, 2018. 





As with many previous examples of US-listed Chinese frauds, a large amount of the assets were ultimately held outside 


the jurisdictional reach of our US court systems, leaving little recourse for shareholders to recoup any value from their 


investments.  This is why we think Hexindai is a zero.

1. FAKE REVENUES, FAKE PROFITS, FAKE CASH. Hexindai, along with many other US-listed Chinese 
companies, have been on our radar screen since the recent reemergence of capital markets interest in the sector.  Our 


due diligence has led us to believe that Hexindai’s financial performance is illusory and much of its reported revenues, 


profits, cash and transaction volumes are fake.  The fabricated figures are signifcant.  Local PRC Credit Reports 


suggest that since inception Hexindai has overstated its cumulative profits by 1,343% and overstated its 


cumulative revenues since inception by 195% in its SEC filings! We believe that these fake profits are reflected as 


fake cash offset by fake retained earnings on its balance sheet and estimate that Hexindai had a negative cash balance 


of US$ 3 million versus its reported cash balance of US$ 53 million as of September 30, 2018! 





2. FABRICATED TRANSACTION VOLUMES. We believe evidence from Changan Property & Casualty Insurance 
Co., Ltd.’s (“Changan”) 2017 annual filing revealed that Hexindai’s actual transactions volumes are significantly less 


than what Hexindai reports to investors in its filings and on its website. Additional evidence from Hexindai’s website 


suggests to us that Hexindai artificially inflated its new user counts in the last quarter of its track record period to stoke 


investor interest in its IPO.  We believe this evidence corroborates with local PRC filings that Hexindai has lied to 


investors by overstating the size and scale of its operations.  





3. INSIDERS SIPHON OUT CASH. In its Prospectus Hexindai claimed that it was going to use its IPO proceeds 
to grow its core business, an online consumer marketplace where borrowers are lent cash from independent third party 


lenders, not cash from Hexindai.  However, once the IPO proceeds were deposited into its accounts, Hexindai 


immediately changed its use of proceeds and both declared a special dividend to shareholders and unexpectedly enter 


an unsecured direct lending business.  Two months after going public, Hexindai launched an unsecured direct 


microlending business with loans 50x larger than its typical loan size nearing ~US$ 1 million.  In July 2018, just 8 


months after its IPO, Hexindai declared a special cash dividend to shareholders (the majority being insiders).  This 


again is a direct contradiction to what Hexindai disclosed to investors as the intended use of IPO cash proceeds and we 


believe was designed as a way to siphon funds out of Hexindai into the hands of China-based insiders.  What better 


way than via unsecured loans that are never repaid?!? 





4. NEGATIVE ONLINE MARKETPLACE DEVELOPMENTS. On December 3, 2018, Hexindai reported poor 
year-over-year operating figures for 2Q’19 (ending September 30, 2018), with total loan transactions declining 87%, 


net revenues declining 83%, and incurring net income losses instead of profits.  While Hexindai management explained 


that it was because of changes to regulatory policies, we think there is an alternative explanation.  As part of our 


diligence, we opened accounts on Hexindai’s online marketplace to confirm the user experience with what Hexindai 


described to investors.  In January 2019, we spoke with Hexindai IR who confirmed to us that Hexindai is processing 


new borrower loans and that Changan is still providing default risk guarantee insurance for Hexindai’s platform lenders.  


Both of these statements are lies. 





a. No New Borrower Loans Being Originated.   As of today, Hexindai borrowers can no longer access 
Hexindai’s online marketplace borrower app. When trying to access Hexindai’s online marketplace borrower 


app, users are met with a bad gateway QR code on both the Android and Apple iOS app stores. We called 


Hexindai’s borrower service hotline numerous times in the past week and was met with a busy signal every 


time.  To us, the evidence suggests that Hexindai’s borrowing apps are no longer working for borrowers.   





b. Changan Out of the P2P Default Loan Guarantee Insurance Business. Hexindai is currently telling 
both online marketplace customers and investors is that Changan is still underwriting loans on Hexindai’s 


platform.   On January 14, 2019, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”) revealed 


on its website that it issued a regulatory letter to Changan on December 17, 2018, requiring Changan to 


immediately stop operating its P2P guarantee insurance business.  This regulatory action was a result of 


Changan’s poor operating performance and it inability to maintain a sufficient solvency margin as of 3Q’18. 





5. REPEAT OF THE CHINA HUSTLE.   The SEC requires extensive disclosures in company filings in an attempt to 
protect investors from being lied to.  Company advisors are also supposed to aide in the vetting process of a newly 


listed company to provide additional protections for minority investors from bad actors.  History has shown that greed 


is a very powerful incentive, especially when someone is financially incentivised to turn a blind eye to bad behavior. 


Hexindai’s Founder, Chairman and Executive Director is named Mr. Xiaobo An.  He and his family are the largest 


beneficiaries of the scheme, and we believe he was the primary orchestrator who used his relationships to entice United 


States gatekeepers to raise capital from United States investors. Sadly for US investors, if the auditors or the 


underwriters did even a limited scope of due diligence work, investor losses could have been avoided.

FAKE REVENUES, FAKE PROFITS, FAKE CASH 





Hexindai claims that its online marketplace has been extremely successful in participating in the 49% CAGR industry 


of online Chinese consumer lending. Hexindai’s business model since inception in 2014 through its IPO track record 


period was to collect fees from matching together consumer borrowers and lenders. Over 90% of the borrowers are 


referred at no cost to Hexindai from Hexin Group (the private business of Hexindai’s founder and chairman).1  Third-


party online marketplace platform investors (“platform lenders” or “lenders”) were attracted by cash incentives and 


guaranteed returns of 8 to15% on their investments.2  To US investors, Hexindai had capitalized on a niche market 


collecting fees from both borrowers and lenders to facilitate online loans without using its own cash balance to fund 


the loans.  





Hexindai, along with many other US-listed Chinese companies, have been on our radar screen since the recent 


reemergence of capital markets interest in the sector.  We became interested when we read that Network 1 Financial 


Securities, Inc. (“Network 1”) and Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP (“MBP”) underwrote and audited, respectively, 


the Company’s November 2017 IPO and decided to review the Company for additional red flags.  Our due diligence 


has led us to believe that Hexindai’s financial performance is illusory and much of its reported revenues, profits, cash 


and transaction volumes are fake.   





The fabricated figures are signifcant.  Local PRC Credit Reports suggest that since inception Hexindai has 


overstated its cumulative profits by 1,343% and overstated its cumulative revenues by 195% in its SEC filings!  





Hexindai’s consolidated financial statements are dominated by its VIE contractual arragement with PRC-based Hexin 


E-Commerce Co. Ltd (“Hexin E-Commerce”).3

As part of our diligence, we obtain Credit Reports for PRC-based businesses which include financial performance 


information reported to local PRC authorities, and compared the local PRC filing financials to what Hexindai disclosed 


to US investors in its Prospectus and SEC filings.  Local PRC Credit Reports disclose that Hexin E-Commerce 


generated cumulative revenues of US$ 48 million and net profits of US$ 4 million for the three years ended December 


31, 2017, much lower than Hexindai reported in its IPO Prospectus and SEC filings.

Hexindai’s SEC filings reveal significantly higher revenue and profit figures for the same time period, suggesting that 


Hexindai overstated its revenues and profits since inception.

The table below summarizes the differences between the cumulative Credit Report data for Hexin E-Commerce versus 


what Hexindai discloses in its public filings.  Local PRC Credit Reports suggest to us that Hexindai fabricated 


US$ 56 million of its reported US$ 60 million in cumulative net income (93% of reported net income) 


purportedly generated from FY 2015 through December 31, 2017.

We believe that these fake profits are reflected as fake cash and fake retained earnings on its balance sheet.  





As of September 30, 2018, Hexindai claimed to have US$ 53 million in cash.  If we subtract US$ 56 million of fake 


profits from cash and retained earnings, we estimate that Hexindai had negative cash balance of US$ 3 million as of 


September 30, 2018 satisfied by one of its existing lines of credit. 4

In our view, the data clearly suggests that Hexindai’s reported financial performance to local Chinese authorities is 


dramatically smaller than what Hexindai reported to US investors.  Hexindai used its fabricated financial statements 


to attract cash from unsuspecting investors under the guise that the funds were to be used as working capital to grow 


the business.  Instead investor funds were used to reward the scheme’s orchestrators.

FABRICATED TRANSACTION VOLUMES 





We believe evidence from Changan Property & Casualty Insurance Co., Ltd.’s (“Changan”) 2017 annual filing 


revealed that Hexindai’s actual transaction volumes are significantly less than what Hexindai reports to investors in 


its filings and on its website. Evidence of fabricated transaction volumes corroborates our previous findings and 


strengthens our opinion that Hexindai lied about the financial performance of its operations. 





To attract lenders to its online marketplace, Hexindai’s policy was to protect investors “up to the full amount of the 


investment and accrued interest” on defaulted loans.  From inception to January 2017, Hexindai managed its own risk 


reserve liability setting aside ~2% of total loan amount plus accrued interest on the loans to cover any borrower 


defaults.5 





These risk reserve liability charges were increasing as a percentage of Hexindai’s total revenues.

As of February 1, 2017, Hexindai transferred the risk reserve liability guaranteeing lenders in the case of borrower 


defaults to Changan.6  Hexindai’s Prospectus disclosed that Changan receives the same fee from the borrowers at the 


time of loan origination, 2% of the loan principal plus interest, and that no loans are originated unless the borrower 


agrees to Changan’s insurance coverage policy.

On its website, Hexindai disclosed its historical monthly loan transaction volume as RMB 7.6 billion in the 11 months 


ending December 2017. 7  If we apply Changan’s 2% fee to these loans, we estimate that Changan would have received 


RMB 155 million from Hexindai’s borrowers.

Exchange rate as of January 31, 2017: 6.7867 





However, Changan’s 2017 annual report disclosed that it generated total revenues from its guarantee insurance 


business of RMB 177 million.  If Hexindai’s reported loan transaction volumes generted RMB 155 million in 


guarantee insurance revenue for Changan in 2017, this implies that Changan only generated revenues of RMB 22 


million from its remaining lengthy and distinguished P2P lending client list (Appendix I) which we find unlikely given 


the size of Changan’s client list.

In early November 2018, we downloaded the monthly data Hexindai previously discloses on its website.  In 


preparation for its Prospectus disclosures, Hexindai appears to have artificially ramped up its monthly new user 


registration numbers to give the appearance that its business was gaining momentum at an accelerated rate.

As illustrated below, the pace of new users accelerated into the June 30, 2017 period, followed by an immediate 


decline to a lower normalized rate. In June 2017, Hexindai reported 709,747 new monthly user registrations.  In 


October 2018, Hexindai added only 28,633 new users, only 4% of Hexindai’s June 2017 results.

To us, it appears that Hexindai artificially inflated its new user counts in the last quarter of its track record period to 


stoke investor interest in its IPO.  We believe this evidence corroborates with local PRC filings that Hexindai has lied 


to investors by overstating the size and scale of its operations.

INSIDERS SIPHON OUT CASH 








We believe that Hexindai executed a premeditated fraud using fabricated financial statements to siphon cash 


from the pockets of United States investors into the hands of PRC-based Hexindai insiders.  





In its Prospectus Hexindai claimed that it was going to use its IPO proceeds to grow its core business, an online P2P 


consumer marketplace where borrowers are lent cash from independent lenders, not cash from Hexindai.  However, 


once the IPO proceeds were deposited into its accounts, Hexindai immediately changed its use of proceeds and both 


declared a special dividend to shareholders and unexpectedly enter an unsecured direct lending business.  





Two months after going public, Hexindai launched an unsecured direct microlending business with loans 50x larger 


than its typical loan size nearing ~US$ 1 million per loan.  As of September 30, 2018, these loan receivables equaled 


US $ 73 million and were the single largest asset on Hexindai’s balance sheet.  In July 2018, just 8 months after its 


IPO, Hexindai declared a special cash dividend to shareholders.  Hexindai insiders owned 83% of the shares, meaning 


the special dividend went almost entirely to scheme orchestrators.  This again is a direct contradiction to what Hexindai 


disclosed to investors as the intended use of IPO cash proceeds and we believe was intentionally designed as a way to 


siphon funds out of Hexindai into the hands of China-based insiders. 





a) Hexindai Says No Dividend – Then Issues Dividend 
 


It took only 8 months post IPO for 37% of Hexindai’s IPO proceeds to get into the hands of insiders. 





On November 3, 2017, Hexindai completed the sale of 5,036,950 ADS at a price of US$ 10.00 per ADS.  Hexindai 


paid US$ 7.1 million in fees to raise the funds, leaving Hexindai with net proceeds of US$ 43.3 million.  Hexindai 


stated that it intended to use the proceeds from its IPO for upgrading operating structure and business framework, 


brand building, and general corporate purposes.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1702318/000104746917006527/a2233550z424b4.htm  
 


However, this is not how Hexindai used the funds.  





In its Prospectus, Hexindai explicitly tells investors that it has no plans in the future to declare a dividend, rather that 


Hexindai intends to retain cash to operate and grow the business.

Despite its stated intentions, on July 23, 2018, Hexindai declared a cash dividend of US$0.40 per ADS.  As of 


June 30, 2018, Hexindai had 48.4 million shares outstanding, making the total cash dividend US$ 19.3 million.  


Since 83% of Hexindai’s shares are owned by insiders, Hexindai insiders received US$ 16.1 million from the 


special dividend, roughly 37% of Hexindai’s IPO proceeds! 





 
Source: Hexindai SEC Filings 





We suspect Hexindai’s cash dividends are not the only way insiders have enriched themselves from the scheme. 





b) Hexindai Says no Direct Lending – Then Makes US $ 79mm in Unsecured Direct Loans 
 


An attractive selling point for Hexindai was its position as an asset-light operator that did not lend to borrowers from 


its own balance sheet, rather acting as an intermediary to facilitate P2P loans.  Hexindai’s consumer lending 


marketplace targets borrowers looking for medium sized loans “ranging from RMB 20,000 to RMB 140,000 (US $ 


3,000 to US$ 20,000).”8

According to an online interview with the CFO regarding Hexindai’s 2Q’2018 resutls, Hexindai had no plans to 


change its operating status as an intermediary and did not intend to use its own cash to engage in small loan business.  


When asked directly about Wusu Hexin Internet Small Loan Co., Ltd. (“WUSU”), the CFO commented that the 


microlending business license gave Hexindai optionality benefit from having an online microlending license in case 


of uneforeseen market or policy changes.9

However, Hexindai’s 20-F disclosed something very different.  In 4Q’2018 Hexindai entered into the direct lending 


business, offering unsecured loans at 8% interest rates with loan sizes 50x larger than previously facilitated “micro” 


loans “ranging from RMB1.0 million (US$159,424) to RMB6.0 milllion (US$956,541).” 10

As of March 31, 2018, Hexindai had loan receivables balance of US$ 29 million, which equaled 100% of WUSU’s 


disclosed maximum loan balance.  However, by September 30, 2018, Hexindai’s largest asset was its WUSU-related 


loan receivable balance which increased to US$ 73 million (from zero just nine months earlier) and now exceeds 


Hexindai’s reported maximum loan balance by 2.5x!  





Using Hexindai’s reported loan receivable balance and range of loan sizes for WUSU, we estimate that WUSU has 


made between 83 and 496 different unsecured loans in nine months. 





 
Source: Hexindai 20-F, 2Q’19 Results Announcement, Bonitas Calculations 





While other operators with microlending licenses typically pursue loan sizes of US$ 1,000 to US$ 3,000, smaller loan 


sizes than Hexindai’s core business, Hexindai decided to use its new microlending license to lend significantly larger 


sums of money directly to “high-value” customers who are given an unsecured line of credit to draw from at will.  


Why would a company with expertise acting as an intermediary broker for tens of thousands of loans ranging from 


US$ 3,000 to US$ 20,000 all of a sudden decide to change its intended use of IPO cash proceeds to engage in unsecured 


direct lending with 50x larger loan amounts to a few hundred borrowers? 





Hexindai does not disclose identifying information about who the Company’s loans are made out to. However we 


believe that Hexindai’s astounding financial performance is illusory and much of its reported revenues, profits and 


transaction volumes are fake.  In our experience, bad actors fabricating financial statements who raise capital from 


public market investors are also looking for ways to siphon funds out of the public company into the hands of the 


scheme’s orchestrators.  What better way than via unsecured loans that are never repaid?!? 





We urge regulators to immediately review the counterparties of Hexindai’s WUSU loans to see if the borrowers are 


undisclosed related parties to Hexindai insiders.  Investors deserve disclosure!

NEGATIVE ONLINE MARKETPLACE DEVELOPMENTS  





On December 3, 2018, Hexindai reported poor year-over-year operating figures for 2Q’19 (ending September 30, 


2018), with total loan transactions declining 87%, net revenues declining 83%, and incurring net income losses instead 


of profits.  While Hexindai management explained that it was because of changes to regulatory policies, we think 


there is an alternative explanation. 





As part of our diligence, we opened accounts on Hexindai’s online marketplace as both a borrower and a lender to 


confirm that Hexindai’s user experience matched what Hexindai disclosed to investors.  In January 2019 we spoke 


with Hexindai IR who confirmed to us that Hexindai is currently processing new borrower loans online and that 


Changan is still providing default risk guarantee insurance for Hexindai’s platform lenders. 





Both of these statements are lies. 





a. No New Borrower Loans Being Originated 
 


As of January 10, 2019, Hexindai’s borrowers can no longer access Hexindai’s online marketplace borrower app.  We 


searched Huawei’s Android and Apple iOS app stores on January 10, 2019, and we were not able to identify any app 


that serves as the lending platform for Hexindai in Huawei app store.  If a customer clicks on the “I want to borrow” 


icon on Hexindai’s website, that customer will be redirected to a page to download the borrowing app for both Android 


and iOS smart phones.

Hexindai’s microlending customers use a different WUSU specific borrower app.  In the Apple iOS app store, we 


found the WUSU app for Hexindai’s microlending customers, “和信借款 (Hexin Borrowing),” (“WUSU app”).  
When we downloaded and tried the open the WUSU app, we received the error message that we needed to download 


an update for the app before we could use the WUSU app.  We were unable to find the update and ultimately unable 


to run the WUSU app.

Repeated calls to Hexindai’s borrower customer service phone number this past week were met with a busy signal 


every time.  To us, the evidence suggests that Hexindai’s borrowing apps are no longer working for borrowers.  If the 


borrowers cannot get new loans, then there are no new loans being written in Hexindai’s online marketplace, contrary 


to Hexindai IR’s statement that Hexindai’s online platform is currently facilitating new borrower loans.  





b. Changan Out of the P2P Default Loan Guarantee Insurance Business 
 


Hexindai is currently telling both online marketplace platform lenders and investors that as of today, Changan 


continues to underwrite loans on Hexindai’s platform. However, multiple independent sources suggest that Changan 


is no longer allowed to offer guarantee insurance as of mid-December 2018 and that Changan was exiting its P2P 


default loan guarantee insurance business due to heavy operating losses.  





On January 14, 2019, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”) revealed on its website that 


it issued a regulatory letter to Changan on December 17, 2018, requiring Changan to immediately stop operating its 


P2P guarantee insurance business.  The operating restriction was effective on the date of the receipt of the letter, 


suggesting Changan is no longer providing guarantee insurance for any new P2P or Hexindai borrower loans.

were in distress and that Changan failed to meet minimum regulatory requirements to operate its P2P guarantee

Chang’an Insurance Caught in P2P Explosion, with 2 Billion Paid and Solvency in Trouble 


December 6, 2018 


As of now, the company 


has compensated close 


to RMB2 billion in this 


space (P2P), with 


unsettled insurance 


liabilities of RMB2.2 


billion. Changan 


Insurance has further 


booked RMB400 


million in provision at 


the end of Q3 2018. 


It is reported that the company has stopped its cooperation with all P2P companies and stopped 


generating any new P2P guarantee insurance. All its problems were reported to regulatory 


authorities and it is in the process of disposing its assets…

Hexindai has repeatedly warned of the operational risks associated with Changan ceasing to insure platform lenders 


from default risk. Now that Changan has incurred signifiant losses and left the business, Hexindai’s disclosures state 


that its “operations and reputation may be adversely affected”.

REPEAT OF THE CHINA HUSTLE 





The SEC requires extensive disclosure in company filings in an attempt to protect investors from being lied to.  


Company advisors are also supposed to aide in the vetting process of a newly listed company to provide additional 


protections for minority investors from bad actors.  History has shown that greed is a very powerful incentive, 


especially when someone is financially incentivised to turn a blind eye to bad behavior.  





We remind readers of our first-hand historical experience with raising money from US investors for PRC-based 


operating businesses.  If you are not familiar, we encourage you to watch “The China Hustle.”  





 
Source: https://www.thechinahustlefilm.com/ 





Hexindai’s founder, chairman and executive director is named Mr. Xiaobo An.  He and his family are the largest 


beneficiaries of the scheme, and we believe he was the primary orchestrator who used his relationships to entice United 


States gatekeepers to raise capital from United States investors.

Of the US$ 50 million in gross proceeds raised by Hexindai, 7% was paid to Network 1 Financial Securities (“Network 


1”) for underwriting the deal.  An additional US$ 561,000 was paid to auditor Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP 


(“MBP”), with an additional US$ 2.1 million paid to Shearman & Sterling LLP and Mei & Mark LLP, among others, 


for legal matters.

All in all, Hexindai paid 14% of its IPO cash proceeds (~US$ 7.1 million) in fees.   





Historically, Network 1’s IPO performance has produced dismal return for investors, with a number of them facing 


fraudulent claims regarding reported financial performance.

On November 16, 2018,12 Hexindai announced that it dismissed MBP as its auditor and wanted to engage Deloitte 


Touch Tohmatsu (“Deloitte”) for its ongoing filings. While the Company touts this event as a win and an auditor 


upgrade, we remind investors of Deloitte’s track record with Chinese-based frauds listed in the US.13   





If you or anyone you know has bought  Hexindai in part based on bullish research from Sidoti, please reach out to us 


by email at hello@bonitasresearch.com using the subject line “SIDOTI VICTIM HOTLINE HELP” to discuss your 


frustrations and answer any other outstanding questions you have about Hexindai. 





We believe that making investors aware of such nefarious activity is part of our societal duty and encourage regulatory 


action.  We have seen such activity consistently in foreign markets, but rarely do we come across short opportunities 


listed on the US markets like Hexindai where the public company overstates profits by 1,343% and siphons the capital 


raised to China-based individuals in less than a year. 





Sadly for US investors, if the auditors or the underwriters did even a limited scope of due diligence work, investor 


losses could have been avoided.  We encourage the SEC to increase penalties for gatekeepers to try and deter greed 


from superseding duties and responsibilities.  We note that international advisors in Hong Kong face criminal charges 


for facilitating a fraudulent public offering while US advisors seem to face little recourse if capital is raised for a fake 


company.14 





Considering the evidence suggesting Hexindai fabricated its financial performance, we anticipate that Hexindai 


insiders will steal as much as they can from shareholders as long as the Company has access to the capital markets.  


As with many previous US-listed Chinese frauds, we suspect investors will find that the assets are ultimately outside 


the jurisdictional reach of our US court systems, leaving little recourse for investors that have lost their investments 


in Chinese based fraudsters. 








We believe Hexindai is a fraud and expect “HX US EQUITY” to be worthless.

DISCLAIMER 
 


We are short sellers. We are biased. So are long investors. So is Hexindai. So are the banks that raised money for Hexindai.  If you are 


invested (either long or short) in Hexindai, so are you. Just because we are biased does not mean that we are wrong. We, like everyone 


else, are entitled to our opinions and to the right to express such opinions in a public forum. We believe that the publication of our opinions 


about the public companies we research is in the public interest.  





You are reading a short-biased opinion piece. We stand to profit if the price of Hexindai’s stock declines. This report and all statements 


contained herein are the opinion of Bonitas Research LLC (“Bonitas”) and are not statements of fact. Our opinions are held in good faith, 


and we have based them upon publicly available evidence, which we set out in our research report to support our opinions. We conducted 


research and analysis based on public information in a manner that any person could have done if they had been interested in doing so.

instrument declines. Use Bonitas’ research at your own risk. You should do your own research and due diligence before making any 


investment decision with respect to the securities covered herein. The opinions expressed in this report are not investment advice nor 


should they be construed as investment advice or any recommendation of any kind.
