Executive Summary
4


Spruce Point Believes Axon Enterprises (Formerly 
Taser) Is A “Strong Sell”: 40% - 60% Downside Risk


Axon Enterprises (Nasdaq: AAXN), the maker of the Taser stun gun, has been positioning itself more as SaaS provider of analytics 
through body cams to law enforcement agencies. With a history of SEC inquires, delinquent filings, and material weaknesses, we 
believe Axon will shock investors with significant earnings disappointment and increasing cash burn as it fails to scale beyond 


these niche businesses. Furthermore, we believe investors misunderstand Axon’s exposure to China tariffs, which will constrain 
margin growth, and its aggressive revenue recognition policies, which have pulled forward revenues. As part of our research, we 
spoke with a law enforcement expert at one of the 5 largest police departments in the US, a former Axon product executive, and a


leading global competitor. With its shares and valuation trading near an all-time high, and analysts price targets of $72 (implying 9% 
upside), we think the risk/reward is terrible and believe investors should brace for 40% – 60% downside risk ($27.50 - $40.00).


Senseless Equity Capital Raises And Need For Borrowing Increase A Classic Red Flag Pointing To Future Financial Challenges
 Axon’s Q1 operating cash burn was the worst in its public history. In addition, Axon quietly increased its line of credit from $10m to 


$100m, an odd move given it has $350m of cash on its balance sheet, no debt, and is forecasted to produce profits this year of $56m 
according to analyst projections


 Axon raised $234m of equity in June 2018 for no defined purpose, has spent only $5m on the plagued acquisition of VIEVU, and 
announced its intention to build a new HQ despite underlying Taser unit growth struggles. From our experience exposing Chinese 
financial schemes, capital raises for undefined purpose and suspect capex projects are significant red flags


Undisclosed Dependence on Chinese Imports Will Drag On Gross Margins, And Increase The Likelihood of Earnings Misses:
 We believe Axon has concealed its dependence on Chinese imports. It removed the word “China” from its recent 10-K, but in Q1’19 


said that “tariff and customs expenses” weighed on margins without quantifying the amount or country source
 Based on import records, we believe Axon has become increasingly dependent on China imports tied to the body cam business in 


the past few years, and given on-going tariffs, we believe these costs will weigh on margins, and could easily cause it to miss 2019E 
EBITDA by 10%. Based on our field research (not disclosed by Axon), we find some evidence it has implement upwards of 5% price 
increases in Q1’19, yet despite this increase, gross margins were still under pressure and missed company estimates by 250bps


Recent Financial Results Signal Growing Strain
 Taser’s core stun gun product is mature with limited domestic unit growth opportunities. A new Taser 7 introduction, over three 


years in development, is unlikely to materially change this trend aside from a short-term benefit
 Meanwhile, its faster growing Software and Sensors (including Axon Cloud) is experiencing a slowdown, while its margins are also


contracting. We believe these trends will continue as costs escalate from offering unlimited video storage, and competition increases
 Now 5 years into the Taser 60 program introduced in 2014, and with the Taser having a 5yr expected life, we believe its early mover 


advantage is being eroded by competitors pricing and solutions on the software and sensor side. Axon’s best gains are now behind it

Spruce Point Believes Axon Enterprises 
(Formerly Taser) Is A “Strong Sell”


VIEVU Acquisition To Expand Into The Body Camera Market A Disaster And More Accounting Concerns Surface
 Axon’s $17m acquisition of VIEVU in May 2018, during a company reposting period, stoked a $1.8bn increase in market value. Based on our 


estimate, the market for bodycams is at best a $356m market, but the TAM is constrained, margins are shrinking and losses are accelerating
 Axon stated significant cost synergies as part of the deal rationale. However, more than a year later, Axon still operates a separate call 


center for VIEVU. Based on our work, it appears that sales declined sharply after the acquisition, while losses intensified. We believe there 
are no synergies, and VIEVU was a defensive acquisition to buy into the NY Police Dept. We also find that Axon took an enormous inventory 
reserve amounting to 70% of the total amount of inventory it acquired in the transaction 


 Lastly, Axon says the seller received a contingent payout based on VIEVU’s financial milestones. However, we find no evidence it recorded 
the liability on its balance sheet, and by year end 2018, the liability account was zero. This further indicates a failed deal


Capex Planning, Inventory and Gross Margin Disappointment Generally Linked: Axon Fits The Mold
 There are many data points to cast doubt on the accuracy of Axon’s margins beyond it having recently reported a material weakness tied to 


revenue recognition and cost of sales, fail to promptly address SEC comment letters, and have its CFO resign:
• Inventory: Stopped disclosing “work-in-progress” inventory and increases its reserve to inventory ratio every year. It is now disclosing 


“inventory optimization” as part of why Q1’2019 had negative cash flow. Inventory to cash conversion days is at a multiyear high
• Capex: Axon missed its 2018 Capex guide by ~20% and offered no guidance to start 2019. Now, with its plan for a new HQ 3.5x the size 


of its existing HQ, it quietly increased the project cost by 30%. Further, based on segment reporting, it appears Axon allocates more 
overhead to its slower growing Taser segment, allowing it to embellish margins in its faster growing segment


New Evidence of Aggressive, Potentially Flawed, Revenue Recognition And Undocumented Compensation Errors
 Axon released its Taser 60 plan in 2014, allowing customers to save by bundling and paying for product and services over 5 yrs. Axon 


increasingly recognizes revenues under “multiple performance obligation” accounting tests which gives it discretion to decide the timing 
and value of revenue recognition. It claims its bundles have “stand-alone” value, and books revenue for hardware upfront. Bolstering our 
concerns, public contracts we’ve evaluated include no stated value for the hardware. We estimate this has inflated revenues by 6% - 9% in 
the past few years


 Based on information directly from Axon, it admits that products such as the body cam cannot be used without Axon software. This directly 
calls into question its stand-alone value proposition to customers, and its choice to book the hardware upfront. We also spoke to a former 
senior Axon sales exec and top 10 customer: Both agreed that purchasing Axon’s product makes little sense without the attached software 


 In addition, Axon has never disclosed errors or accounting issues tied to compensation expenses. However, Spruce Point has unearthed 
401k plan filings at the IRS where Axon admits errors dating back to 2014. SEC reported expenses do not match IRS filings

(Formerly Taser) Is A “Strong Sell”


TAM Inflation And Likelihood To Disappoint In New Markets:
 Axon has rapidly inflated its Total Addressable Market (TAM) from $4.8bn (2016), $6.5bn (2017) to $8.4bn (2019). Yet, by closely analyzing 


assumptions, it becomes obvious that much of this TAM is largely unproven, and being exaggerated with unrealistic pricing assumptions:
• Axon Records / Dispatch: Significant entrenched competition in these critical areas will make it extremely difficult to crack this market. 


Axon has given the records away for free to try to whet customer appetite. However, the purchasing decision is not always tied to police 
chiefs, where they have their best relationships. We believe the market is dominated by Motorola, Tyler Technologies, and CentralSquare  
Technologies. These three players have largely consolidated the market through acquisitions, leaving Axon no alternatives to buy its way 
into the market, and punting its future on a greenfield development strategy with a high risk of failure


• Axon AI: Beyond redaction, Axon has limited proven analytics here to sell that we can identify. Furthermore, Axon has mysteriously 
marked up its sales assumption from $50/mo to $100/mo and users from 600k to 1.1m to inflate the TAM. Axon spent $15m on two 
small AI acquisitions to form its AI team, and already impaired 27% of acquired technology. By contrast, Motorola spent $1 bn to acquire 
Avigilon, a leader in video surveillance and AI. This underscores our belief that Axon is multiple steps behind the competition


 International: Axon has repeatedly made big promises about its ability to crack these markets, with underwhelming results. It recently 
pivoted to distributor acquisitions to accelerate progress, while slowly cutting its TAM from $2.7bn (2016) to $2.4bn (2019). In addition, 
Axon’s transparency and disclosures about international sales are poor. Our research suggests it is still many years away from succeeding


Governance Concerns To The Extreme 
 Axon has been embroiled in many past controversies, including numerous lawsuits, open SEC investigations, and allegations of bribing 


police chiefs to win business. CEO Rick Smith has seen both his father and brother leave the company under unceremonious circumstances
 While Axon appears to have used a shareholder friendly buyback to repurchase $141m of stock since 2010, insiders have unloaded $92m of 


stock over the same time period. With Axon both issuing and repurchasing shares, insiders now own a record low of 2.3% of the company
 Axon’s latest compensation scheme, while touted to be shareholder friendly and modeled after Tesla’s long-term plan to link market cap 


creation, is undermined by the fact the CEO immediately sold 300,000 shares in a senseless stock offering shortly after announcing the plan
 Axon’s compensation scheme ties pay to high flying tech SaaS companies with significantly bigger TAMs, while ignoring the fact that it Is a 


weapons manufacturer with a more constrained TAM, and significantly bigger liability risks 
 Arthur Andersen served as Axon’s auditor from 1996-2002. The current Chairman of the Audit Committee was a long-time accountant and 


partner at Arthur Andersen, a firm that collapsed the wake of the Enron scandal from blessing aggressive revenue recognition practices. In 
light of our evidence that Axon uses aggressive interpretation of accounting standards to book hardware upfront that cannot be separated 
from software, we believe investors should be cautioned
7


Spruce Point Sees 40% - 60% Downside Risk


Terrible Risk / Reward At The Current Share Price:
 Analysts’ average price targets for Axon is $72.30, or just 9% upside from the current price. A majority of analysts (9) are bullish, but 


there are five (5) that are neutral or expect Axon to perform in-line with the market. Four (4) brokers fail to offer a price target
 Analysts have bought into the narrative that Axon is a superior “razor / razor blade” model with a promising recurring revenue and 


cloud business. However, we believe this is a one-time boost from a move to the Taser 60 subscription model in 2014, that is now
maturing five years into the program.  All the while, future growth opportunities will remain challenging, and analysts have amnesia 
as it relates to Axon’s past SEC investigations, material weaknesses, and legal spats and view them as one-off “non-recurring” issues. 
Based on our recent findings, we beg to differ, and don’t believe that Axon is worthy of its super valuation of  7.4x, 46x, 65x 2019E 
sales, EBITDA and EPS, respectively


 We believe a majority of the brokers pitch Axon’s stock to retail investors. Sophisticated institutional investors have been selling 
shares over time, side-by-side with insiders


 Meanwhile a key executive and Board member recently departed, which we believe signals waning confidence in Axon’s future, and 
supports our case that Axon has a technology roadmap challenge, and constrained ability to acquire deeper penetration in its 
verticals. Axon’s EVP of World Wide Products, recruited from Apple, quietly left in less then two years. Brett Taylor, Chairman of 
Axon’s Technology Committee (and M&A Board member), also just resigned as disclosed on June 14th


 Many analysts fail to look at Axon’s two distinct businesses when evaluating the Company. However, we believe it is appropriate to do 
so given the different growth rates, TAMs, and margin profile:
• Taser: We view Taser as a mature business, and give an 7x-9x multiple of 2020 EBITDA, a premium to other weapons peers by 


acknowledging its above average margins and market dominance. However, we fail to see any sustaining upside to Taser’s margins
• Software and Sensors:  Evidence of revenue accounting issues having resulted in pulling forward of hardware sales, slowing sales 


growth, compressing margins, and a smaller TAM than advertised, give us reason to value this segment at a discount to SaaS peer 
multiples at 3.5x – 5.5x 2020 sales. Management is leading investors to believe it will start generating revenues from Records and 
AI in H2’19, but we fail to see a path to monetization and believe this will disappoint. In addition, Axon is promising improved
margins, but with China tariffs lingering and storage costs exploding, we fail to see any material upside 


• Factoring in the excess cash, we estimate a price target of $27.50 – $40.00 (40% - 60% downside)65

Company Background


• In 1991 the Smith brothers formed AIR TASER Inc with Jack Cover 
(inventor of Taser predecessor).  After nearly going bankrupt 
marketing other electroshock systems, the company renamed itself 
TASER International, introduced the TASER M26 and would later pay 
police officers to train other officers on the use and efficacy of the 
product.  The success of this strategy lead to an IPO on the Nasdaq 
in May 2001 and a dominant market position


• In 2005, TASER International began to offer Taser Cam, a camera 
that would become activated when safety was disengaged.  The 
product had some moderate success before the company unveiled 
its first body camera in 2008.  The body cam would experience 
growing success as a result of its ability to exonerate law 
enforcement personnel, particularly in the wake of a growing 
number of high profile shootings and incidents receiving national 
media attention


• In 2013 TASER opened an office in Seattle and would later 
announce the formation of a division known as Axon.  Axon 
comprised the company’s technology business, including body 
cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics.  On April 5th, 
2017 TASER would rebrand itself as Axon Enterprise to reflect its 
expanded business and distance itself from the stigma attached to 
the TASER name.


• In 2018 the company raised capital (“re-IPO”) in an attempt to 
reposition itself as a SaaS business model and set the goal of 
becoming an end-to-end police technology partner to law 
enforcement globally

Placing Axon’s Historical Product Success In 
Context


Axon’s product origins trace back to the TASER, a passion of CEO Smith after experiencing the loss of two friend’s lives resulting 
from gun violence.  The body cam would later emerge from the TASER Cam, an additional feature on an earlier TASER model.  Both 


of these products can be characterized as predominately hardware solutions.  In both instances Axon enjoyed significant early
mover advantage and historically weak competition given the newness and niche nature of the product categories.

Notes
• Axon has successfully defended its market 


positions due to its defense of patents and strong 
relationship with law enforcement


• After securing its initial first mover advantage, 
Axon also offered free 1 year product trial in 2017. 


• Motorola, a natural competitor in the space, 
mistakenly came to market with a product at a 
higher price than the market would bear
11


Decoding Axon’s Future Product Plan


Axon would now like investors to believe that it is at the precipice of leveraging their video and emerging AI capabilities 
alongside a subscription model to drive both revenue and margin for investors.  In layman’s terms we believe they are simply 


attempting to deliver innovative solutions to fill their current capability gaps in pre-crime analytics, Computer Assisted 
Dispatch (CAD) and Records Management Systems (RMS).

Police Incident Technology Capability Map


The backbone of critical police technology and technology spend has long been CAD and RMS.  These software systems serve the 
critical functions of dispatching officers and recording incidents and are inextricably linked.  Axon has suggested that the key to 


winning future incident technology business is to be able to deliver a completely integrated solution.  Interestingly, several of 
Axon’s largest competitors (e.g., Tyler Technologies, Motorola and Central Square) are already offering the entire integrated


solution outside of body cam video.  Motorola is presently the only player that is capable of delivering the full suite of incident 
technology.  Spruce Point believes that it is highly unlikely that Axon will parlay video AI to shoehorn their way into CAD / RMS.

Axon Is Unlikely to Have Meaningful Success 
In CAD “Build”


Unlike TASERs and Body Cams, Axon is almost 40-50 years late to CAD, law enforcement’s largest technology spend category.  
The CAD space is already heavily consolidated and, not surprisingly, two of the leading providers, Motorola and Harris, are both
LTE mobile radio providers.  CAD systems also tend to be heavily customized for larger clients and it is our understanding that 


these systems are extremely sticky.  A former Axon exec gave the analogy of asking someone to give up your 
Windows operating system. 


• Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) is a system that collects Calls For 
Service (CSF) (e.g., 911 calls) and then leverages technology to deploy 
the appropriate resources to the scene and provide them with 
situational awareness. Given the critical nature of its function, CAD 
has been around since the early 1970s


• These systems are often customized, multi-jurisdictional and multi-
disciplined.  As a result, the buying center is often times outside of a 
specific law enforcement department where Axon has it’s strongest 
relationships


• Given that CAD systems assign a number to each dispatch, this 
identifier often serves as the reference number and first data input 
for incident reports contained in records management systems. 
Interoperability across CAD and RMS systems has increasingly been 
viewed as a necessity


• CAD has historically been the largest technology spend for law 
enforcement, approximately 50% per the head of a top 5 US police 
department, and as a result the market place is dominated by four 
players and almost completely owned by the top 7


• Given that CAD is a communication system at its hub, it’s not 
surprising to see that LMR players like Motorola and Harris command 
meaningful market share

14


RMS Penetration Is Also Likely To Be An 
Uphill Battle


Much like CAD systems, record management systems have been a core law enforcement capability for decades.  Over time RMS 
has evolved from simply being a repository for forms to a sharable database that provides access to myriad constituents, both
internal and external, and powers real time intelligence to officers in the field.   Given the emphasis on interoperability, we don’t 


see Axon likely penetrating RMS without CAD success or highly differentiated analytics and AI. 


• Records Management Systems (RMS) are the interface where records 
(e.g., incident reports) are created, modified and later shared with a 
variety of 3rd parties (i.e., 911, CAD, mobile officers, Jail, prosecutors and 
other agencies).  The RMS typically allows you to create forms, 
validations and work flows


• These systems are often customized, multi-jurisdictional and multi-
disciplined.  As a result the buying center may be outside of a specific 
law enforcement department where Axon has it’s strongest relationships


• RMS population often begins with a CAD CFS or incident ID. 
Interoperability across RMS and CAD systems has increasingly been 
viewed as a necessity.  As AI technology has evolved RMS has become 
the data repository that powers real time insights to officers in the field.  
As Axon has highlighted, one growth area for RMS will be the 
automation of the data entry process


• RMS has historically been the second largest technology spend for law 
enforcement, approximately 30% per the head of a top 5 US police 
department, though it remains highly fragmented and competitive


• In addition to the incumbent CAD players competing for RMS market 
share, new well funded / venture backed firms are also entering the 
market.  Mark43 a Jeff Bezos / Goldman Sachs / David Petraeus (CIA) 
backed RMS / CAD solution has raised over $78 million through its C 
round

Industry Consolidation Likely Leaves Axon 
With Limited Acquisition Targets


While Axon rushed to accumulate share for its lower-quality camera business as the body-worn camera fad played out, the stickier and more 
profitable law enforcement software space experienced tremendous consolidation. Firms such as Tyler Technologies, CentralSquare, and 
Motorola have spent north of $1B acquiring most of the strongest software vendors in the CAD, RMS, and AI verticals, leaving few (if any) 


remaining high-quality M&A prospects for Axon as it plays catch-up in software. Industry experts report that these capabilities are extremely 
expensive to develop, and that Axon has little chance to take meaningful share in these verticals against entrenched and trusted vendors.

Failure To Execute On CAD / RMS Could 
Place The Body Cam Business At Risk


Spruce Point Believes that Axon will likely fail miserably in its attempt to develop the AI capabilities necessary to launch 
themselves into the RMS, yet alone the CAD space.  Without achieving these capabilities we find Axon’s long term 
revenue / TAM assumptions to be unreasonable.  Further, if you believe Axon’s own view that integrated solutions 


providers will eventually “take-all”, then we wouldn’t be surprised if failure on CAD / RMS leads to the loss of Axon’s 
current body cam positioning to integrated competitors like Motorola.

Artificial Intelligence Hype Already Failing


2018 10-K:  “During the year ended December 31, 2018, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business 
combination resulting in an impairment charge of $2.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we abandoned 
certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $1.0 million”.


In Feb 2017, Axon announced two acquisitions to launch a new artificial intelligence group “Axon AI”. The acquired 
technologies and team of about 20 researchers and engineers “will accelerate the introduction of new AI-powered 


capabilities for public safety.” Dextro was purchased for $7.5m ($5.8m acquired technology) and Fossil was 
purchased $6.8m ($5.2m of acquired technology). Axon would then later report abandoning $3.0m or 27% of what it 


hyped as “structurally superior” AI.


Q4’16 Feb 2017 CEO Smith:  “Our company's advantages in AI aren't just somewhat better than our competitors, it's 
structurally superior”.


Q2’17 Aug 2017 CEO Smith commenting to a question on RMS / AI:  “Yeah. This is Rick. I'll take that one. We expect that 
we will be starting to field trials late this year. We'll likely be making some announcements at the IACP Conference in 
October about some specific products related to some of these capabilities and we expect in 2018 that we'll start to see 
revenue contribution”.

International Growth Also Likely To 
Disappoint


Axon has been attempting to expand outside of the U.S. for most of its operating life.  However, despite many years of 
inconsistence performance, it hasn’t been able to grow beyond ~20% of total sales.  Our conversations with a head of 
competitor sales suggest that it could be another five years before international opportunities resemble those in the  
US. Management gives very little transparency into the business, and disclosure quality has generally gotten worse. 
Axon has resorted to purchasing distributors in two key regions: the UK and Australia, and now is suddenly calling 


out these countries as sources of growth in 2018. Notably, Axon has reported a material weakness in its U.K. 
subsidiary post acquisition, which should be alarming given it was a small acquisition of just $3.3 million.

Any Surprise Axon’s Technology And M&A 
Board Expert Just Resigned?


Friday June 14th, after market close, Axon revealed that Bret S. Taylor, its Board member and Chair of the Technology 
Committee (and member of the M&A committee), tendered his resignation. The timing, five years into the Taser 60 


plan, and while management is promoting an even bigger TAM is very suspect. His departure underscores our belief 
that Axon’s technology roadmap and ability to acquire deeper domain relevance is challenged.

Evidence of Financial Struggles And 
Why We Believe It Won’t Improve

Core Businesses Under Pressure


Axon’s core Taser product is at best not growing, while margins have been slowly contracting. Meanwhile, its faster 
growing Software and Sensor segment is experiencing slower growth, along with margin contraction. We believe 
Software and Sensors margins will be pressured from tariffs and rising video storage costs because Axon offers 


“unlimited device storage”.

Axon’s financial operating metrics continue to slow down and deteriorate. The fact that this happened ahead of the CFO 
transition, 10-K delay, and multiple SEC comment letters that Axon failed to promptly address are concerning.

Axon’s Cash Burn The Worst Q1 In Its 
Public History


We observe that Axon just reported its worst Q1 cash burn in its public history. Management is claiming this is due to 
the Taser 7 ramp, and trade-in credit terms. However, we believe there are other factors at work that will cause cash 


flow to remain under pressure.

Senseless Capital Raise A Major Red Flag


Source: Axon prospectus and 8-K


From our early work exposing Chinese scams, we cautioned investors to beware of companies that show pristine balance 
sheets, yet raise funds from investors for no defined purpose. We have significant concerns that Axon raised $234m in June 


2018, when its balance sheet had $96m of cash, no debt, and it was projecting accelerated revenue growth of 18-20% with 
healthy earnings projected at over $30m. CEO Smith sold 300,000 shares netting him a cool $15.1m. Of course, the CEO’s stock 


sale came quickly after he promised a Ten-Year Performance Plan, modeled after controversial CEO Elon Musk’s plan.

Spruce Point has based prior successful short calls on companies we found had abnormal and poor capex guidance 
and inventory practices, notably Gentex (GNTX), Caesarstone (CSTE), and A.O. Smith (AOS).  In each of these 


examples, these practices were a strong leading indicator of future gross margin and earnings contraction. We will 
illustrate that Axon fits the mold and exhibits poor inventory and capex accounting practices. In addition, we will 


illustrate why we believe Axon also has aggressive revenue recognition practices.

Accounts Receivables Growing 4x 
Faster Than Revenues


There is evidence that suggests Axon has aggressively been recognizing revenues, not a stretch given it previously 
noted material weaknesses tied to internal controls over revenue recognition in 2016.  The practice started in 2014 when 
Axon started its Taser 60 and Officer Safety Plan (OSP) program, allowing customers to pay for hardware and services 


over an extended contractual life, typically 5yrs, and billed annually. Axon has put receivables related to this program in 
the “long-term” account. Total receivables have ballooned 456% in the same period that revenues have grown 99%. 


This suggests that Axon has booked revenues, generally associated with the weapon (and body cam), in advance of its 
ability to collect on these sales in a timely fashion.1

of imputed interest, and the amount allocated to the extended warranty is recognized over five years”


Axon 2016 10-K:  “Specifically, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over revenue 
recognition, cost of goods sold and services delivered and the reporting of deferred revenue. Further, we identified material weaknesses in our account 
reconciliations and monitoring processes. These material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting resulted from a breakdown in the 
operation of identified preventative and detective controls which led to the Company not initially recording some transactions correctly.”

Evidence of Aggressive 
Revenue Accounting 


As seen in the table below, Axon has been booking substantially more revenue under “multiple performance obligation” 
accounting since 2014. We believe this allows it to aggressively book equipment revenue upfront, when in reality, its 


equipment is inextricably linked to the services being provided, and should be deferred over the contract life. The 
analogous situation is fleet telematics solutions which provide a GPS device to customers, but charge for the tracking 


software and service. We provide the accounting used by Fleetmatics below as an example. 


Fleetmatics 10-K:  “As the in-vehicle devices do not have value to the customer on a standalone basis, the delivery or 
installation of the in-vehicle devices does not represent the culmination of a separate earning process associated with 
the payment of the up-front fee. Accordingly, we record the amount of the up-front fee as deferred revenue upon 
invoicing and recognize that amount as revenue ratably.”


Axon 10-K:  “Evidence.com and Axon cameras and related accessories have stand-alone value to the customer and are sometimes 
sold separately, but in most instances are sold together. In these instances, customers typically purchase and pay for the equipment 
and one year of Evidence.com in advance. Additional years of service are generally billed annually over a specified service term, 
which has typically ranged from one to five years. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for the Axon equipment at the time 
of the sale consistent with the discussion of multiple deliverable arrangements above.”

Estimating The Impact


We use the annual change in sales reported under multiple performance obligations, and apply a range of percentages 
to this figure to estimate the revenue booked upfront from Axon’s aggressive revenue recognition policy. We estimate 


revenue inflation of 6% - 9% p.a.  In addition, by applying the gross margin, we estimate the impact to gross profit.

Documentary Proof That Axon’s Body 
Camera Has Limited “Stand-Alone” Value 


When asked about the Body Cam’s functionality, Axon’s technical support representative says that Evidence SYNC software 
is necessary to connect Axon devices via a USB connection.(1) Axon software is necessary to operate the device in real-time, 


and to connect it with another cloud or software provider, the user has to go offline and use the Axon Sync software to 
download the content to the computer, for upload to a competitors solution. Therefore, the Axon device has constrained 
operability with other solutions. These facts call into question what is its real “stand-alone” value as claimed by Axon for 
revenue recognition purposes, when its utility is constrained.  We spoke with a top 10 customer and former Taser product 


sales executive. Both agreed it would be unlikely to purchase the hardware without the software.


1. Axon Evidence Sync



https://www.axon.com/products/evidence-sync
35


Careful Look At Axon’s Contracts


Axon’s accounting disclosures say, “we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using 
our estimate of the standalone selling price ("SSP") of each distinct good or service in the contract.” We find it unusual 


that public contracts we found include zero value for the hardware. This bolsters our concern that Axon is both 
recognizing the hardware value at contract inception, and could be overstating its value by obscuring it. 


Otherwise, Axon is implicitly saying its hardware is worthless.

Warning: Cloud Revenue Cannot Be 
Reconciled 


Our concerns about Axon’s revenue quality and cloud story is further supported by the fact that its quarterly revenues in 2018 
sum to $92.4m, which does not reconcile to its annual reported result of $90.3m. The issue stems from Q2’19 where Axon made

In Our Experience, Poor Capex Planning 
Leads To Financial Disappointment

?


Spruce Point has repeatedly warned to be cautious when companies cannot accurately forecast capex, as this often 
leads to gross margin deterioration (and ultimately EPS disappointment). We find the Axon significantly missed its 


first capex target in 2018, with actual spending of $11.7m falling below the low end of its $12 - $16m range. 
In addition, Axon did not offer formal capex guidance for 2019, but when pushed by an analyst on the Q1’2019 


conference call five months into the year, the CFO said $12 - $15m.

Axon Has Spent Money On Nothing, 
Other Than Preparing A Plush New HQ 


Beyond the small $17.6m acquisition of VIEVU (requiring just $5m of cash), the only notable investment Axon has 
announced is its intention to construct a new headquarters in Scottsdale, AZ. Axon claims it needs a new 325,000 
square foot space for manufacturing and production, a 3.2x increase in size from its current 100,000 square foot 
facility.(1) The need for such an aggressive expansion in light of stagnate Taser product sales and unit production 


appears outlandish. Furthermore, Axon’s repeated delays and 25% increased costs (without explanation) shows further 
evidence of poor capital planning and disclosure practices by management. We also question why is it pre-paying rent 


for an 84 year leasehold interest? Is Axon attempting to inflate future cash flow by incurring the cost upfront?


“On December 13, 2018, we entered into a Purchase and Sale 
Agreement ("PSA") to purchase a leasehold interest to a parcel 
of land located in Maricopa County, Arizona for a period of 84 
years, on which we intend to construct our new headquarters. 
The purchase price of the land lease was $13.1 million. It is 
also contemplated that we will prepay the rent under the 
lease in the amount of $10.9 million. The PSA includes a 
due diligence period, during which we may terminate and 
forfeit our initial deposit of $0.2 million. On March 4, 2019, we 
entered into an amendment to the PSA which extended the 
due diligence period to May 3, 2019. On May 3, 2019, we 
entered into a second amendment to the PSA which extended 
the due diligence period to June 28, 2019. The second 
amendment also revised certain stated approval dates and 
removed the requirement for an additional deposit originally 
due at the end of the due diligence period.”


Source: Original agreement – filed Nov 11, 2018


Axon has not explained why the total cost (land lease purchase + prepaid rent) increased 25%. Also, recall it said 
total capex of $12 - $15m in 2019. Does this mean its total capex budget will be just to purchase land, and its 


operating business requires no growth or maintenance capex?


Source: 10-Q – filed May 10, 2019


1. Axon says it has other warehouse facilities, and that its new HQ will consolidate locations. We are unable to determine the size of these other facilities.

Why Might Axon Need 3x More Sqft For 
Its New HQ?


By reading Axon’s segment reporting carefully, we see that it includes select costs for Software and Sensors, and “all other costs 
are included in the Taser segment”. With Axon planning to triple the size of its new HQ, and Axon removing reference to 


“overhead allocation” to its Software and Sensors business, it would be able to allocate substantially more “overhead” to the
slower growing Taser segment, while artificially inflating the segment performance of its faster growing Software and Sensors


segment. In addition, as of Q1’2019 Axon stopped providing SG&A by segment1.

Gross Margins Will Severely Disappoint


Axon forecasted 61% - 63% gross margins for Q1’19, yet actual results were 59.5% - a significant miss that management initially 
explained from Taser 7 program start-up costs and trade-in credits. Management has not been fully transparent on the impact from
China tariffs and customs expense, while analysts have not asked any questions about the issue. We explore this issue later in our 
report. Analysts’ project Axon’s gross margins to improve, but we expect them to disappointment, especially in light of Axon using 


FIFO accounting, which allows it to delay costs into the future in an inflationary cost environment.

Margin 


Guidance


“In Q1 2019, we expect gross margins to be in the range 
of 61% to 63% and build higher over the rest of the year”


Q1`19 Actual 
(press release)


“Gross margin of 59.5% represents 260 basis points of 
sequential improvement, driven by strength in software 
and sensors, partially offset by TASER 7 program startup 


costs, including customer trade-in credits”


Q1’19 
(Conf Call)


“In Q1 TASER segment gross margins were pressured by 
two main factors ASP, average selling price and scrap 
rates both will improve over time and we're improving 


even as we speak.”


Q1’19 
(10-Q)


“Additionally, margins were compressed related to the 
rollout of our newest TASER device and increased data 


storage and tariff and customs expenses.”


Gross Margin 
Guidance For 
Rest of 2019


“Total company gross margin is expected to expand 
throughout 2019 as we continue to improve TASER 7 yields 
and realize cost improvements on TASER 7 cartridge parts. 


Gross margin is also expected to benefit from natural trends 
in our business, including our growing software revenue mix, 
the amortization of TASER 7 live cartridge revenue, and the 


phasing out of TASER trade-in credits.”


Analysts estimate that gross 
margins will magically 


increase, yet none are aware 
of Axon’s significant exposure 


to China imports and tariffs

Axon Doesn’t Talk About Price Increases


Axon does not give investors enough information to determine how much benefit it is receiving from price increases in any of its
SEC filings, and does not discuss pricing trends on conference calls. We have found clear evidence that it is trying to push price 
increases, upwards of 5%, perhaps to moderate margin pressures. However, the evidence shows Axon is willing to forestall price 


increases to entice customers to sign contracts quickly by firm dates.

Rapidly Escalating Inventory Provisions A 
Problematic Development


Spruce Point’s skepticism about Axon’s gross margins being inflated are further supported by its inventory accounting practices.
We observe that it is now disclosing “optimization efforts” after slowly phasing in higher provisions. Most concerning, we find the 
growth of its 2018 provision, which it attributed to VIEVU, was 70% of the total inventory acquired in the transaction. All-in costs 


related to the VIEVU acquisition were $3.8m or 21% of the deal cost.1


Source: Axon financial statements
1. Includes $1.8m of inventory reserve charges, $0.9m of deal costs, and $1.2m of 
purchase commitments = $3.8m on $17.6m of total deal costs. See 10-K p. 88


$ in mm 2015 2016 2017 2018


Ending Inventory $15.8 $34.8 $45.5 $33.8 


Provision $0.5 $1.2 $2.0 $3.8 


Provision % of Inventory 3.2% 3.4% 4.4% 11.3%


“Operating cash flows were also impacted by decreased inventory of $14.8 million resulting from continued 
inventory optimization efforts. These increases were offset by increased accounts and notes receivable of $67.6 
million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $12.7 million during 2018”


“During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded provisions to 
reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of 
approximately $3.8 million compared to $2.0 million during 2017. The 
increase in provisions made during 2018 was primarily attributable to 
the impact of phasing out previous generations of VIEVU cameras in an 
effort to convert existing customers to Axon body camera 
deployments. The remaining change in the provision for 2018 was driven 
by analyses looking at projected sales data for existing products and 
making corresponding adjustments to state inventories at their lower of 
cost and net realizable value.”

Inventory Disclosure More Opaque As 
Cash Conversion Worsens


Looking carefully, we see that at the time Axon started ramping up its inventory reserves, it also stopped providing 
standard disclosure about inventory “Work-in-Process” which it listed at just $100k for two years, and paints the 


picture that it literally has no production in-process.  In addition, Axon’s days to convert inventory to cash 
(and cash conversion cycle) started to lengthen.

Undisclosed Compensation Errors 
Since 2014


Spruce Point has identified previously undocumented financial errors in Axon’s employee compensation 
programs. This bolsters our confidence that management is not being transparent about the true state of its 


financial affairs. While it has previously noted material weaknesses of financial control issues, Axon has never 
cited problems or issues tied to compensation expenses.

Audit Chair Concerns


The evidence suggests that Axon has aggressively recognized revenues. These aggressive accounting choices were 
known to be blessed by Arthur Andersen, the now defunct auditor, that famously signed-off on Enron’s financial 


statements and was charged with obstruction of justice. Notably, we see that Axon’s Audit Committee Chairman worked 
at Arthur Andersen from 1974 – 2002 and was a named partner. In addition, Axon was audited by Arthur Andersen from 


its earliest years in 1996 through its emergence as a public company.1

Axon Concealing Dependence and 
Risk To Margins From China
48


Why Is Axon Concealing Its Dependence 
On Chinese Imports?


“We currently purchase finished circuit boards and injection-molded plastic components from suppliers located in the U.S., Mexico and 
Taiwan. Although we currently obtain many of these components from single source suppliers, we own the injection molded component 
tooling used in their production. As a result, management believes it could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring 
significant production delays. We also purchase small, machined parts from a vendor in Taiwan, custom cartridge components from a 
proprietary vendor in the U.S., and electronic components from a variety of international and domestic distributors. We believe that there 
are readily available alternative suppliers in most cases who could consistently meet our needs for these components. We acquire most 
of our components on a purchase order basis and do not have any significant long-term contracts with suppliers.”


“The Company currently purchases both off-the-shelf and custom components, including finished circuit boards assemblies and injection-
molded plastic components, primarily from suppliers located in the U.S., Mexico, China and Taiwan. Although the Company currently 
obtains many of these components from single sources of supply, the Company owns the designs as well as the injection molded 
component tooling and test fixtures used in production for all custom components. As a result, management believes it could obtain 
alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. The Company also strategically holds safety stock levels 
on custom components to further reduce this risk. For off-the-shelf components, Management believes that there are readily available 
alternative suppliers in most cases who can consistently meet the Company's needs for these components. The Company acquires most of 
its components on a purchase order basis and does not have any significant long-term contracts with suppliers.”

“Our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $115.8 million, an increase of $14.6 million, or 14.4%, from the
comparable period in the prior year. We had income from operations of $2.7 million compared to $13.6 million for the same period in the 
prior year. The decrease in operating results was due to an increase in cost of sales as well as investments over the past year for additional 
headcount in research and development and sales, general and administrative functions to support continued and future growth.
Additionally, margins were compressed related to the rollout of our newest TASER device and increased data storage and tariff
and customs expenses. We recorded net income of $6.4 million compared to $12.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year.”


Why has Axon not made a single disclosure related to China since March 2018?

YTD 2019 Shipments: China


Axon management is potentially misleading investors about its dependence on China. We have sourced import 
records of containers shipped to Axon from abroad. Of the 32 import records received YTD May 2019, we believe 18 
(or 56%) can be traced from Chinese manufacturers including Airspeeed1, Konda2, and China National Electronics. 


We believe this exposure comes from its greater emphasis on the body camera business.

Sensitivity To China Tariffs


Axon does not provide any quantitative impact to its financial results from tariffs, but we know they are material now 
that the company included a vague risk factor, and finally mentioned the words “tariff” and “customs” expense in its 
recent 10-Q. We believe the exposure comes from its greater emphasis on the body cam market, and increased when 
it purchased VIEVU. We make some conservative estimates and believe that tariff costs could easily cause Axon to 


miss its EBITDA estimates by 10%.

Non-Sensical Valuation Expansion Post 
VIEVU Acquisition


VIEVU was acquired on May 4, 2018. We view the acquisition as a defensive move by Axon after it lost the NY Police Dept 
contract to VIEVU.(1) Pre-acquisition Axon’s market cap was $2.2 billion and today it stands at $4.0 billion. 


We size the entire U.S. market opportunity to Axon for body cams at $356m (device + software), and of course, it’s unreasonable 
to believe that Axon will capture the entire market. Axon’s $1.8 billion market cap valuation seems excessive relative to the
market opportunity, which we do not believe has significant growth given: 1) stagnant law enforcement officer growth, and 


2) deflationary forces that will compress Axon’s ability to charge for cameras while absorbing rising storage costs.(2)

VIEVU Failed Promises


Axon’s VIEVU deal looks like a major disappointment. Despite claiming opportunities for cost savings, the deal has resulted in a
lawsuit with a former employee, FTC subpoena for information, and a high profile product snafu when one caught on fire.(1) All 
this, while evidence from Axon’s disclosures show its revenues declined throughout 2018 while operating losses ballooned. 


While claiming opportunities to rationalize costs by eliminating duplicate sales efforts, a year later, and VIEVU’s website is still 
operating with a phone line separate from Axon’s remaining operation and professional service costs are increasing.(2,3)


CFO on Q1’2018 Call:  “We only recently closed on the deal and are still working to quantify the extent of these synergies. But expect there 
to be significant opportunities to rationalize expenses by eliminating duplicate sales efforts in combining certain aspects of our teams both 
of which are based in Seattle”.

VIEVU Failure As Seen Through 
Contingent Consideration 


Though Axon claims the VIEVU deal contained contingent consideration for future milestones, it does not appear to have 
recorded the liability on its balance sheet, as we would have expected the account to increase in Q2’19. Instead, by the end of 


2018, Axon stopped reporting any contingent consideration and made just $2.3m of payments all year, as reported through the 
cash flow statement. Therefore, we conclude either it never recorded VIEVU’s contingent consideration, or it abruptly wrote it 


down to zero by year end which would signal its failure.

anniversaries of the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was $5.8 million”.

A Look Into The Smith Family


Patrick Smith


(CEO)


Thomas Smith


President


(Brother of Patrick –
Ex-Chairman)


Dr. Phillip Smith


(Father of Patrick –
Ex-Chairman)


• Axon has a history of sketchiness with various allegations of conflicts of interest for unethically paying police executives 
to win contracts, allegations of stock fraud due to providing misinformation to investors, multiple delinquent SEC filings, 
disclosures of internal control weaknesses, federal subpoenas, and large insider stock sales


Taser Int’l (now Axon) has been run by various members of the Smith family since inception. Investors have to get comfortable
with the past, and current, missteps associated with the Smith family.

 Settled for $20 million (source)
 Retired in 2006 (source)


 Thomas Smith, former president of Taser

flow needed to pay these officers to do free 
training work.“


 Patrick Smith leaves Taser for aviation 
startup in 2012 (source) 


Phillip & Thomas Smith (Father & Son) were sued for securities fraud; purported to be paying off police agencies, and shortly
thereafter left the Company.

Now: Has Anything Changed?


Now
Patrick Smith (CEO)


Is CEO Smith still too close in their relationships with police chiefs? In early 2015, Taser was exposed for having “cultivated financial 
ties to police chiefs whose departments have bought the recording devices, raising a host of conflict-of-interest questions”. (1)


1. Taser has financial ties to police chiefs, including Halstead, Star-Telegram, 2015



https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article12443984.html

Allegations of Police Briberies And 
Conflicts of Interest


 In 2013, some controversy 
surrounded as to how Taser 
secured a $2M contract for 
body cameras. The ex-police 
chief involved at the time 
was reportedly provided 
with various Taser perks and 
he retired shortly after and 
became a consultant to 
Axon (1)


 In 2014, Chief Halstead 
successfully pushed for the 
signing of a $2.7M no-bid 
contract with Taser before a 
company quarterly sales 
deadline.


 He was quoted in emails 
saying his “fee is not cheap! 
LOL” and “Someone should 
give me a raise.” (2)


 In 2016, a federal antitrust 
lawsuit accused Taser of 
bribing public officials in 
New Orleans, where the 
police department signed a 
$1.4M deal for cameras in 
2013. Similar to Ray Schults, 
the police Chief retired and 
joined Axon

Excessive Comp Linked To Managerial Hubris?


Spruce Point cannot recommend investing in a company where the CEO makes headlines for large 
compensation while “flexing” his muscles. This suggests extreme managerial hubris.   


“Mr. Smith’s reported compensation far surpasses that of the highest-paid CEOs last year at much larger companies and 
is about 20 times the median pay for an S&P 500 chief, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Axon is too small to 
be in the S&P 500 index”

Perfectly Timed Sales?


• In November 2004 Taser executives were reported to have sold $91.5 million of their own stock, raising 
suspicions that they sought to maximize their own profits before their product lost ground (1)


• In one week in November following an announcement that Taser stun guns had been approved by the 
federal government for use on domestic flights, three family members sold shares worth $54.6 million (2)


• In a shareholder letter, the company defended the insider sales indicating the 
father, Phillips Smith, sold the majority of his Taser stock as “part of his retirement 
transition”, while the sons sold an average of 22% of their Taser stock (3)


• There has even been a book written on Taser’s poor history of manipulation 
(“The Perfect Stock: How a 7,000% move was set-up, started and finished in an 
astonishing 52 weeks”) (4)

Simplistic Valuation Based On Hearing 
And Seeing No Evil At Axon


Some analysts rely on back-of-the-envelope methods to value Axon, even applying multiples based on penny stock microcaps, 
while claiming Axon should trade at a premium to peers, or the high end of the valuation range, yet do not grasp Axon’s software
roadmap challenges ahead. Analysts also conveniently ignore Axon’s past run-ins with the SEC including a formal investigation, 
failures to promptly respond to comment letters, past material financial weaknesses of internal controls, numerous legal battles


and overhangs, government subpoenas, and allegations of influencing police officers. None of this seems to merit any discount to
Axon’s valuation.

Exaggerating What Axon Is To Justify 
Inflated Price Targets


Axon has always aspired to be something other than a weapons manufacturer to justify a higher multiple, and to justify paying
management more comp. To illustrate, in its recent proxy statement it doesn’t list a single weapons maker as a peer. Instead, Axon 
uses companies with significantly bigger and faster growing TAMs (tied to consumers, small businesses, etc) where there are also


lower litigation risks involved. Some analysts have bought into the narrative, and claim Axon should carry a premium value.

Axon’s Taser business is stable with low single digit 
growth, and taken at face value, higher EBITDA margins 


than other public weapons makers. We apply a generous 
7x-9x multiple on the business. Our EBITDA estimate is 


below the Street as we believe Axon will fail to upsell the 
Taser 7 to  the degree anticipated, and more muted 


upside to margins


We believe its Sensors and Software business will also 
disappoint expectations as it fails to displace the 
competition in other segments such as records 


management. Whereas some analysts argue Axon 
deserves a premium SaaS multiple, we completely 
disagree given its much lower TAM, and declining 


margins from tariffs and price pressure. We view this 
business closer to a Garmin, but with faster top-line 
growth, and apply a generous 3.5x – 5.5x 2020 sales. 


$ in millions, except per share amounts


We have a more sober view of Axon’s valuation as we believe there is ample room for disappointment around Axon’s 
ability to penetrate adjacent software needs of law enforcement, including dispatch, records management, and artificial 
intelligence analytics. We also see headwinds to margin expansion, including tariff and storage costs, which analysts 


either fail to acknowledge and model, or assume will abate.
