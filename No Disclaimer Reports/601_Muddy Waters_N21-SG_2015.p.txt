Noble’s Accounting: Fueling the Cash-Burning Fires 


 
Muddy Waters is short Noble Group Limited (“Noble”).  Noble seems to exist solely to 
borrow and burn cash.  According to Bloomberg, Noble has been free cash flow positive 
only four out of 20 years – in other words, it literally generates positive free cash flow 
once every five years!1  According to Bloomberg, since 1997 Noble has raised from 
banks and markets net $7.7 billion.  Noble’s debt is now almost four billion dollars.  (A 
recent estimate, which Noble has not contested, is that due to repo-style transactions, 
Noble’s intra-quarter debt is approximately $3 billion greater than reported.2) 
 
Noble might encourage investors to exclude its working capital changes from 
calculations of operating and free cash flow. We think that approach would be self-
serving and disingenuous.  We are puzzled by why, when given a 20-year runway, this 
company is still unable to stop burning cash.  Really, what is the point of Noble growing, 
if after all of this time, it still cannot consistently generate cash?  We think Noble’s 
growth is a means to no end, other than to keep the credit flowing. 
 
Noble depends on its income statement to survive.  When a company borrows and burns 
cash as consistently as Noble does, it needs to generate EBITDA for its lenders, and net 
income for its equity investors (a company’s ability to issue equity is comforting to 
lenders).  For a company such as Noble, with significant amounts of Levels 2 and 3 fair 
value assets and an ever-expanding balance sheet, EBITDA and net income can be 
relatively easy to produce.  The key questions about Noble are: 
 


• Is Noble effectively borrowing just to repay its existing debt?  (In other words, if 
Noble stopped growing its balance sheet, would the business actually generate 
free cash and repay debt?) 


• Is Noble in a vicious cycle whereby it will spend cash in value destroying ways in 
order to generate accounting gains (and keep its credit flowing)?

The reality of Noble’s financial statements has recently been criticized by a supposed 
former employee. 3 4  Recently released details on 2014 results suggest concerning 
answers to the above questions.  In 2014, 70% of Noble’s net income came from 
unrealized net gains on Level 3 assets.5  $2.1 billion of Noble’s 2014 fair value gains are 
on contracts maturing in over four years,6 which represents 30% of Noble’s 2014 fair 
value gains and 41% of shareholders’ equity.7  With $4.0 billion in debt on Noble’s 
balance sheet and funding costs that have recently been volatile, the degree of substance 
underlying Noble’s financials is critical.8   
 
We are really short Noble’s management.  With a company as complex and opaque as 
Noble, there is no way for investors to definitively answer the above questions.  It 
becomes a question of how much investors should trust Noble’s management to be 
straight with them.  Noble’s management has adamantly insisted that its accounting is 
conservative, and by implication, is reflective of reality.  We do not believe Noble’s 
management. 
 
If “adversity introduces a man to himself”, in the public company context, it also 
introduces management to investors.9  Management’s actions taken on the eve of Noble 
reporting its first quarterly loss since being public, give a clear view of how they operate.  
Through a highly questionable acquisition followed by a series of suspicious transactions, 
Noble reduced its first reported quarterly loss by approximately two-thirds.  The reported 
gain was equivalent to roughly 10% of Noble’s 2011 net income.  In this report, we 
present the details of these transactions.  After amassing this information, the truly 
disturbing aspect of Noble is that it has over 12,000 contracts – i.e., a lot of opportunities 
to do similar things again, and again. 
 
Third party behavioral analysis strongly supports our opinion of Noble management.  
Muddy Waters engaged Qverity to analyze management’s statements on the February 
26th Q4 2014 results call for deception.  (The call is the only time Noble management has 
spoken extemporaneously in public about the recent criticism.)  Qverity provides 
behavioral analysis, and is founded and staffed by former United States Central 
Intelligence Agency experts in detecting deception.  Its principals authored the books 
“Spy the Lie” and “Get the Truth”.  We have included the Qverity analysis in this report. 
Qverity’s opinion is that Noble management has been deceptive in addressing the 
criticism.

On November 9, 2011, Noble reported its first quarterly loss as a public company.  The 
following series of transactions – undertaken at this time of financial stress – seem not to 
be bona fide business transactions.  Rather, they appear designed to generate substance-
less accounting profits, and then to purge the evidence.  The most incredible aspect is that 
to accept these transactions at face value, one has to believe Noble’s attorneys lost $12 
million of their own money as Noble’s counterparty.  (Talk about pro bono.) 
 
When Noble purchased PT Alhasanie (“PT ALH) in Q3 2011, Noble booked a gain from 
negative goodwill that reduced its quarterly loss by approximately two-thirds.10  The 
most remarkable aspect of the $46.4 million negative goodwill gain Noble booked on PT 
ALH was that Noble paid only $300,000 for the company.  In other words, Noble 
claimed to have bought a company worth $46.7 million for only $300,000 – i.e., Noble 
found someone willing to sell this gem for 0.6% of its true value. 
 
The February 25th 2015 Iceberg Research report highlighted PT ALH as an example of a 
potentially abusive transaction.11  Noble has failed to respond to this criticism.12 When 
we scratched the surface of transaction, we found numerous red flags and aggressive 
actions by Noble.   
 
When the dealing in PT ALH was finished in April 2013, both Noble and one of its 
affiliates, PT Atlas Resources Tbk (“PT Atlas”), had taken fair value gains from buying 
PT ALH.  Disturbingly, Noble appears to have neither bought from, nor sold to, arms-
length parties.  Our interpretation of these transactions is that there was a premeditated 
scheme to convey PT ALH to PT Atlas, generate unjustified and substance-less 
accounting gains for Noble along the way, and then ultimately purge the company of the 
evidence.  If our understanding of these facts is correct, it goes directly to the question of 
whether management is willing to manipulate investors and ratings agencies.   
 
Noble is initially uncomfortable discussing PT ALH. 
 
It would have been hard for investors to initially spot the red flags surrounding the 
massive gain from negative goodwill.  When Noble released its Q3 2011 financials, 
management misled investors into thinking that the gain arose from multiple sources. 
 


“<Q – Mervin Song [DBS]>: Two questions…And the other thing I need

reorganizations we were going through in Indonesia relating to some of our 
mining activities.”13 (emphasis added) 


 
Mr. van der Zalm appears to be doing backflips to avoid admitting that the $46.4 million 
gain arose solely from negative goodwill Noble booked on the PT ALH acquisition.  We 
wonder what questions management would have received had it announced this fact at 
the time, coupled with PT ALH having pre-acquisition negative book value of ($5.5 
million), negative net tangible assets of ($6.2 million), and was purchased for only 
$300,000.14  Instead, management was able to defer disclosure of these uncomfortable 
facts until it buried them in note 16 on page 131 of the 2011 annual report, released over 
three months later.

Noble transfers the questionable fair value gain to an off take agreement. 
 
Noble reported selling PT ALH one year later (in either September or November 2012 – 
Noble seems confused and has disclosed both dates).  The consideration Noble reported 
receiving for selling PT ALH was only $4.0 million.15   
 
Noble justified receiving consideration significantly less than PT ALH’s (massively fair 
valued upward) carrying value by disclosing that prior to sale, PT ALH restructured an 
off take agreement with one of Noble’s subsidiaries.  Largely as a result of restructuring 
the off take agreement, Noble reported that within one year, the net value of PT ALH’s 
assets had declined (versus the post-negative goodwill adjustment) to $2.1 million.16  
Therefore, Noble likely valued the restructured off take agreement with PT ALH at 
between $31 million to $38 million.17    
 
Noble defends its MTM assumptions on off take agreements as “conservative”.18   
But we are very curious why an arms-length seller would sell for $300,000 a mine that 
could execute an off take agreement worth to the counter-party approximately $31 
million to $38 million.   
 
We speculate that the real purpose of the restructured off take agreement was to avoid 
Noble taking a massive impairment charge when it disposed of PT ALH.  (We believe 
that a true arms length buyer would never have paid anything close to Noble’s carrying 
value.)  Another concern we have is that the off take restructuring might have juiced 2012 
EBITDA by transferring below the line 2011 profit to an above the line account in 
2012.19 
 
Noble Triple Dips on PT ALH 
 
When Noble sold PT ALH for a purported $4.0 million, Noble took an additional fair 
value gain of $1.9 million.20  While the amount of the second “dip” is immaterial, by 
taking a fair value gain on the sale, Noble is telling us that it sold the mine for more than 
it was worth.   
 
Noble accomplished its triple dip when its affiliate, PT Atlas Resources Ptk (“PT Atlas”), 
ended up buying PT ALH just a few months after Noble sold it – in February 2013.  PT 
Atlas agreed to pay the same price Noble received when it sold PT ALH: purportedly 


                                                             
15 Noble 2013 AR, p.126. 
16 Noble 2012 AR, p. 120. 
17 The off take agreement valuation is based on carrying value of $46.4 million as of 9/30/2011 and 
carrying value of no more than $38.6 million as of 9/30/2012. We can see from the 2Q 3Q 2012 and Q3 
2013 quarterly filings amortization of the mine properties of PT ALH to be less than $2m per quarter 
during the period therefore, amortization would total no more than $8 million. The residual value of mine 
properties of $7.06 million would suggest that the off take agreement was valued at a minimum of $31 
million and a maximum of $38 million.

$4.0 million.21  Surprisingly, PT Atlas booked a fair value gain on the acquisition of $6.1 
million.  Thus, when Noble sold PT ALH for $4.0 million, it effectively claims to have 
sold the company for about twice what it was worth.  However, when PT Atlas bought 
the company a few months later, $4.0 million was 60% less than PT ALH’s fair value at 
the time.   
 
The $6.1 million fair value gain reduced PT Atlas’s 2013 net loss by 36%.22  The 
relationship between PT Atlas and Noble appears complex – Noble owns 10% of PT 
Atlas; Noble’s President, Will Randall, is on PT Atlas’s board of commissioners; and, 
Noble has an off take agreement with PT Atlas.23 24 25  We are unsure what benefit Noble 
would have received by abetting what seems to be questionable accounting treatment by 
PT Atlas; but, little about this series of transactions seems above board. 
 
Based on both Noble and PT Atlas taking accounting gains, these transactions appear to 
have been win-win.  However, there is more to the picture.  In order for PT Atlas to book 
the negative goodwill on PT ALH, the seller (i.e., the party that bought from Noble) 
needed to pay compensation PT Atlas of an additional $12.0 million cash.   
 
PT Atlas’s 2103 annual report states: 
 


“Based on Shares Sale and Purchase Agreement, the previous owner ensures that 
the aggregate value of coal in stockpile and cash is US$ 5,600 and no liability in 
ALH financial statements as of April 30, 2013.  Because of variance between 
ALH financial position and such agreement, the previous owner has to give US$ 
12,007 to OPE.”26,27 


 
The unfortunate seller, who purportedly ended up parting with PT ALH and a net $12.0 
million, was a company called PT Dayana Lestari (“PT Dayana”).  PT Dayana was 
90.9% owned by Ms. Hetty Tumondo and 9.1% by Mr. Adiwidya Imam Rahayu.  Both 
Ms. Tumondo and Mr. Rahayu are attorneys at the Indonesian law firm Brigitta I. 
Rahayoe & Partners.  The name partner of said firm is Ms. Brigitta Hadianto Imam 
Rahayoe.  Ms. Rahayoe is also the mother of PT Dayana shareholder Mr. Rahayu.  Ms. 
Rahayoe herself was the controlling shareholder of PT Dayana until October 2012, at 
which point she transferred her shares to her subordinate, Ms. Tumondo.   
 
Investigators we hired in Indonesia spoke with multiple sources who believe it is likely 
Rahayoe & Partners represented Noble in the PT ALH transactions, and possibly other 
work.  (We have not obtained our own corroboration of this point.)  Regardless, Ms. 
Rahayoe, Ms. Tumondo, and Mr. Rahayu each served as nominee shareholders of PT 
ALH and its holding company PT Borneo Sejahtera Mulya (“PT BSM”) during the

periods in which Noble owned the companies.28  This fact implies a business relationship 
between Noble and Ms. Rahayoe’s law firm. 
 
Moreover, Ms. Rahayoe was one of two directors of PT BSM from 2008 until Noble 
bought it and PT ALH.  (PT ALH had been a subsidiary of PT BSM since 2008.)  Given 
the pervasive role Ms. Rahayoe and her firm played in these various transactions, the 
initial PT ALH purchase is suspicious.  It is definitely difficult to regard it as arms-
length. 
 
Regardless, if we are to take both Noble and PT Atlas’s disclosures at face value, then 
Ms. Tumondo and / or Ms. Rahayoe in September 2012 paid Noble consideration for PT 
ALH of $4.0 million.  Then, Ms. Tumondo and / or Ms. Rahayoe received $4.0 million in 
2013, but had to return that money along with an additional $8.0 million the same year.  
That would mean that the attorneys Ms. Tumondo and / or Ms. Rahayoe lost $12.0 
million transacting with Noble and PT Atlas.   
 
We highly doubt that Ms. Rahayoe, her firm, or Ms. Tumondo ever paid Noble $4.0 
million, and we completely dismiss the possibility that any of them additionally paid PT 
Atlas $8.0 million.  These purported consideration amounts seem to be little more than 
accounting entries to a) justify these transactions, and b) produce more substance-less 
accounting profit. 
 
Tying Up Loose Ends – Disposing of PT BSM 
 
When Noble bought PT ALH, it did so by acquiring PT BSM.  PT BSM owned PT ALH.  
When Noble transferred PT ALH to Ms. Rahayoe / Tumondo’s company, PT Dayana, it 
transferred PT ALH directly – i.e., without also transferring PT BSM.  Thus, PT BSM 
was left to smolder on Noble’s balance sheet a little while longer. 
 
Noble announced that PT BSM issued 15,125,779 new shares, which constituted 55% of 
equity, to PT Jatro Indonesia on January 20, 2014.29  Noble claims that PT Jatro paid $28 
million for this stake.  There are some problems with this disclosure.  First, the 
amendment to PT BSM’s articles of association effecting the issuance to PT Jatro was not 
even notarized until April 3, 2014.  However, something different happened in January 
though – it’s a bit of a head scratcher. 
 
On January 24, 2014, the Indonesian government approved the AOA amendment 
transferring 100% of PT BSM to a company called PT Andhika Raya Semesta (“PT 
ARS”).  (The AOA amendment had been notarized in December 2013.)  PT ARS was 
formed on May 27, 2011.30  This is the exact same date that PT Dayana was formed (PT 
Dayana is the straw party that “bought” PT ALH from Noble and “sold” it to PT Atlas).   
 


                                                             
28 Indonesian law requires at least two shareholders, so it is therefore common to have a nominee 
shareholder who owns one share.

30 As evidenced by notarization of the corporate records.  Its formation was approved on August 10, 2011.   


Page 8 of 14
Moreover, Hetty Tumondo owns 50 shares of PT ARS (90.1%), and Ms. Rahayoe’s son 
owns 9.09%.  This shareholding structure is identical in every respect to that of PT 
Dayana.31  Because PT Dayana seems to have been conceived for purposes of being a 
straw party, it is reasonable to conclude that PT ARS and the disposal of PT BSM were 
part of the same plan. 
 
While PT Jatro did eventually receive 55% of PT BSM, the remaining 45% is still owned 
by PT ARS.  However, the shareholders of PT ARS have not changed – they are still Ms. 
Tumondo and Ms. Rayahoe’s son.  At the time of Noble’s January 20, 2014 
announcement, Noble referred to PT BSM as its “ultimately beneficially wholly-owned 
and controlled subsidiary”, which implies that Noble could have had a “variable interest 
entity”-type structure in place with PT ARS.  (“VIE” structures seek to transfer economic 
benefit and control to parties other than the actual equity owners.)   
 
We cannot understand the justification for a VIE-type of structure in this instance.  Noble 
seems to have had no legal problem owning 100% of PT BSM previously.  We suspect 
that imposing this layer that Noble does not actually own somehow serves to further the 
chain of likely sham transactions.  This is particularly true, given that Noble claims $28 
million changed hands.  To whom did the $28 million go, if to anybody at all? 
 
Conclusion 
 
PT ALH shows that Noble management manipulates financials and investors when the 
pressure is on.  The problem for investors is that given how prodigiously Noble chews up 
cash, the pressure is always on.  PT ALH seems to be a premeditated chain of sham 
transactions that not only unjustifiably pumped up net income by $46.4 million (and 
possibly EBITDA the next year), but requires investors to believe that in order to 
facilitate the transactions, Noble’s attorneys went out of pocket $12 million.  And of 
course there is the question of whether Noble really owns a share of PT BSM, and did 
anybody receive the $28 million purportedly paid for the majority share? 
 
Noble responded to criticism of its fair value practices and calls for transparency into 
them by stating it has over 12,000 agreements, which it marks to market using 
conservative assumptions.  The implication of this statement is that the average net fair 
value gain per contract in its portfolio is small, and Noble’s accounting is thus 
reasonable.  However, PT ALH shows us that one contract can significantly move the 
needle.  Management has therefore failed to adequately respond to the criticism, which 
we strongly suspect is because transparency could negatively impact Noble’s credit 
rating.

Analysis of Noble Group Q4 2014 Call 


Summary: On the basis of select commentary by Noble Group management and the 
associated deceptive behavior identified below, we have concluded it is highly likely that 
one or more of the allegations made in the Iceberg report are true. The area of greatest 
concern appears to be Noble’s write-down of Yancoal, and the accounting assumptions 
on which the write-down is based. 


In

Analysis: The CEO’s qualified statements, coupled with the attack on the non-

level of risk associated with further deteriorating market conditions.

  any

  on	
  our

  We've	
  gone	
  through	
  as	
  part	
  of	
  our	
  year-­‐end	
  
process	
  and	
  reviewed	
  in	
  great	
  detail	
  the	
  operating	
  assets	
  that	
  we	
  have

  (35:45)	
  we	
  have	
  impaired	
  them	
  as	
  we	
  did	
  in

quarters.	
  


So	
  looking	
  at	
  what	
  we	
  have,	
  looking	
  at	
  the	
  amount	
  of	
  exposures	
  that

have

  at

  we	
  don't	
  see	
  any

  on	
  any	
  of	
  
the

  exposures	
  that	
  we	
  have.

Analysis: Mr. Alireza begins his response with overly polite behavior, thanking the 
analyst and using his name. This is a form of manipulation behavior, in which a person 
uses politeness and familiarity to ingratiate himself with his audience. He follows this 
with overly specific statements about Territory, along with a reminder that Noble is an 
asset-light entity. This is noteworthy in that deceptive people often become overly 
specific in conveying detail as a persuasive strategy—they provide details about 
inconsequential issues as a means of giving the appearance of cooperation and 
openness. He then offers a non-specific denial about reviewing the balance sheet, in 
which he fails to specifically deny that Yancoal has no other issues. In addition, he 
completely ignores, for the moment, the question about differentiating the losses in the 
quarter for both Agri and Yancoal. Collectively, his deceptive behavior is strongly 
indicative of a level of concern that is higher than what has been disclosed regarding 
additional problems with Yancoal.  


In	
  terms	
  of	
  the	
  breakdown	
  between	
  Yancoal	
  and	
  Noble	
  Agri,	
  Robert,	
  do	
  you	
  have	
  those	
  
details?	
  <A	
  -­‐	
  Robert	
  van	
  der	
  Zalm>:	
  Noble	
  Agri	
  was	
  on	
  the	
  balance	
  sheet	
  at	
  roughly	
  
$1.4-­‐ish	
  billion.	
  <A	
  -­‐	
  Yusuf	
  Alireza>:	
  I	
  think	
  the	
  question	
  is	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  the	
  losses	
  on	
  
associates.	
  	
  


<A	
  -­‐	
  Robert	
  van	
  der	
  Zalm>:	
  Losses	
  on	
  associates,	
  in	
  the	
  year,	
  NAL,	
  the	
  Noble	
  Agri,	
  the	
  
quarterly	
  impact	
  –	
  the	
  impact	
  on	
  the	
  associate	
  line	
  was	
  just	
  a	
  quarterly	
  impact	
  about	
  
$94-­‐ish	
  million	
  and	
  the	
  Yancoal	
  impact	
  was	
  roughly	
  $60	
  million	
  loss,	
  [ph]	
  it	
  was	
  all	
  
(36:47).	
  	
  


Analysis: Mr. Van der Zalm initially provides information that was not requested. After 
further prompting from Mr. Alireza, he provides only approximate figures regarding the 
losses. His behavior reflects concern about providing any significant detail regarding the 
question that was posed.  


<Q	
  -­‐	
  Yuriy	
  Humber>:	
  Hi,	
  good	
  evening.	
  I	
  wanted	
  to	
  ask	
  about	
  the	
  write-­‐down	
  on	
  
Yancoal.	
  You	
  mentioned	
  that	
  you	
  have	
  an	
  annual	
  process	
  to	
  evaluate	
  all	
  the	
  write-­‐
downs.	
  Would	
  you	
  be	
  able	
  to	
  specify	
  exactly	
  when	
  you	
  look	
  to	
  have	
  the	
  write-­‐downs	
  
and	
  maybe	
  give	
  a	
  little	
  bit	
  of	
  more	
  details	
  on	
  what	
  kind	
  of	
  coal	
  price	
  assumptions	
  you	
  
used	
  for	
  the	
  Yancoal	
  write-­‐down	
  and	
  maybe	
  an	
  outlook	
  for	
  the	
  coal	
  prices	
  with	
  that?	
  
And	
  was	
  any	
  of	
  the	
  write-­‐down	
  –	
  was	
  it	
  in	
  any	
  way	
  sort	
  of	
  connected	
  with	
  recent	
  
questions	
  raised	
  about	
  the	
  Yancoal	
  valuation	
  by	
  Iceberg?	
  Thank	
  you.	
  	
  


<A	
  -­‐	
  Yusuf	
  Alireza>:	
  Sure.	
  So	
  just	
  to	
  clarify,	
  we	
  review	
  all	
  of	
  our	
  associates/other	
  assets	
  
investments	
  on	
  our	
  balance	
  sheet,	
  on	
  a	
  quarterly	
  basis,	
  but	
  obviously,	
  have	
  a	
  more	
  
detailed	
  review	
  on	
  an	
  annual	
  basis.	
  In	
  terms	
  of	
  your	
  last	
  question,	
  there	
  is	
  nothing	
  in	
  
terms	
  of	
  our	
  results	
  that	
  was	
  impacted	
  in	
  any	
  way	
  by	
  any	
  anonymous	
  report	
  that	
  was	
  
released.	
  	
  


In	
  terms	
  of	
  when	
  the	
  decision	
  was	
  made	
  to	
  write-­‐down	
  Yancoal,	
  we've	
  
been	
  going	
  through	
  the	
  process	
  of	
  reviewing	
  our	
  balance	
  sheet	
  and	
  all	
  of	
  
our	
  assets	
  with	
  E&Y	
  for	
  the	
  last	
  month,	
  month-­‐and-­‐a-­‐half	
  since	
  the	
  year-­‐
end.	
  We	
  presented	
  those	
  results	
  to	
  the	
  Audit	
  Committee	
  over	
  the	
  last	
  


Page 11 of 14
few	
  days	
  and	
  finalized	
  them	
  with	
  the	
  board	
  today.	
  	
  


In	
  terms	
  of	
  the	
  assumptions	
  that	
  have	
  gone	
  into	
  it,	
  there's	
  obviously	
  a	
  number	
  of	
  
assumptions	
  that	
  impact	
  that	
  cash	
  flow	
  model,	
  the	
  cash	
  flow	
  model	
  that	
  externally	
  
created,	
  internally	
  verified	
  by	
  our	
  control	
  functions	
  and	
  verified	
  by	
  E&Y.	
  Those	
  
assumptions	
  are	
  around	
  production,	
  around	
  cost,	
  around	
  fuel	
  inputs,	
  around	
  coal	
  prices,	
  
around	
  FX,	
  so	
  there's	
  a	
  number	
  of	
  variables	
  that	
  go	
  into	
  that.	
  	
  


As	
  I	
  said	
  earlier,	
  I	
  think	
  we	
  have	
  been	
  conservative	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  the	
  variables	
  we've	
  used	
  
and	
  then	
  that	
  cash	
  flow	
  model	
  comes	
  out	
  with	
  a	
  range	
  of	
  value.	
  And	
  we	
  have	
  impaired	
  
Yancoal	
  down	
  below	
  the	
  bottom	
  end	
  of	
  that	
  range,	
  right	
  below	
  the	
  bottom	
  end	
  of	
  that	
  
range.	
  	
  


The	
  coal	
  price	
  assumptions	
  are	
  the	
  same	
  assumptions	
  that	
  we	
  use	
  in	
  all	
  of	
  our	
  
businesses.	
  And	
  at	
  this	
  point,	
  our	
  coal	
  price	
  assumptions	
  are	
  below	
  the	
  consensus	
  
curves.	
  Obviously,	
  I	
  can't	
  provide	
  you	
  the	
  specifics	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  those	
  numbers,	
  because	
  
that	
  is	
  basically	
  the	
  numbers	
  that	
  we	
  use	
  to	
  manage	
  our	
  business.	
  But	
  what	
  I	
  can	
  say	
  is	
  
they	
  are	
  below	
  the	
  consensus	
  curves.	
  And	
  the	
  adjustment	
  in	
  valuation,	
  not	
  only	
  was	
  
our	
  external	
  auditor,	
  E&Y,	
  comfortable	
  with,	
  but	
  our	
  Audit	
  Committee	
  and	
  our	
  board	
  
are	
  very	
  comfortable	
  with.	
  	
  


Thank	
  you.	
  Next	
  question,	
  please.	
  	
  


Analysis: The first area of concern is Mr. Alireza’s non-specific denial as to whether the 
write-down was in any way connected with the Iceberg report.  When addressing the 
issue of Noble’s coal price assumptions, other than to say that those assumptions are 
below the consensus curves, he refuses to provide any specifics beyond a vague claim 
that these are the numbers used to manage their business. Finally, he punctuates his 
response by offering a quick “Thank you,” and then immediately calls for the next 
question. His eagerness to move away from this issue reflects his desire to avoid any 
further inquiry into the issue. His behavior suggests concern about the Iceberg report, 
as well as likely discomfort relative to the assumptions Noble is using to justify the 
write-down on Yancoal. 


<Q	
  -­‐	
  Charles	
  C.	
  Spencer>:	
  Okay,	
  great.	
  So	
  you're	
  saying	
  that	
  EY	
  actually	
  did	
  look	
  in	
  detail	
  
at	
  this	
  report,	
  reviewed	
  it	
  with	
  the	
  board,	
  reviewed	
  it	
  internally	
  there,	
  and	
  went	
  ahead	
  
with	
  their	
  statement.	
  	
  


<A	
  -­‐	
  Robert	
  van	
  der	
  Zalm>:	
  EY	
  just	
  followed	
  their	
  internal	
  protocols	
  and	
  felt	
  comfortable	
  
signing	
  off	
  on	
  the	
  accounts.	
  


Analysis: This is clearly an overly specific response, which again is a persuasion 
behavior that’s intended to give the appearance of cooperation and responsiveness by 
providing information, however the information provided is inconsequential detail Mr. 
Van der Zalm fails to state that E&Y reviewed the report. Instead, he simply says E&Y 
went through its normal protocols. 


<Q	
  -­‐	
  Charles	
  C.	
  Spencer>:	
  Will	
  you	
  be	
  coming	
  out	
  with	
  a	
  further	
  sort	
  of	
  a	
  detailed	
  


Page 12 of 14
response	
  to	
  some	
  of	
  the	
  points	
  raised?	
  	
  


<A	
  -­‐	
  Yusuf	
  Alireza>:	
  Well,	
  we	
  have	
  sent	
  out	
  –	
  listen,	
  I	
  don't	
  –	
  and	
  I	
  have	
  been	
  given	
  
advice	
  not	
  to	
  spend	
  a	
  lot	
  of	
  time	
  talking	
  about	
  this	
  thing.	
  But	
  I	
  think	
  I	
  –	
  I	
  guess	
  I'm	
  not	
  
good	
  at	
  sometimes	
  following	
  that	
  advice.	
  	
  


On	
  the	
  one	
  hand,	
  we	
  have	
  a	
  company	
  that	
  was	
  set	
  up	
  30	
  years	
  ago	
  by	
  our	
  Chairman,	
  
Richard	
  Elman,	
  with	
  three	
  people	
  and	
  $100,000	
  of	
  capital,	
  and	
  has	
  been	
  built	
  over	
  
those	
  30	
  years	
  to	
  the	
  76th	
  largest	
  company	
  in	
  the	
  world	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  revenue.	
  It's	
  a	
  
company	
  that's	
  been	
  a	
  public	
  company	
  for	
  20	
  years,	
  and	
  issued	
  quarterly	
  results	
  for	
  
those	
  20	
  years,	
  audited	
  quarterly	
  results	
  for	
  those	
  20	
  years,	
  and	
  has	
  hundreds	
  of	
  
stakeholders,	
  credit	
  intensive	
  stakeholders,	
  that	
  review	
  our	
  balance	
  sheet	
  all	
  the	
  time.	
  	
  


And	
  on	
  the	
  other	
  hand,	
  there	
  is	
  an	
  anonymous,	
  unknown	
  blogger	
  who	
  set	
  up	
  a	
  blog	
  a	
  
month	
  ago.	
  I	
  will	
  say	
  that,	
  at	
  this	
  point,	
  we	
  believe	
  strongly	
  we	
  know	
  who	
  it	
  is,	
  and	
  it's	
  
a	
  disgruntled	
  junior	
  ex-­‐employee,	
  that	
  we	
  fired	
  about	
  a	
  year-­‐and-­‐a-­‐half	
  ago.	
  We've	
  
provided	
  that	
  information	
  to	
  the	
  regulators.	
  	
  


I	
  don't	
  plan	
  on	
  spending	
  any	
  management	
  time	
  on	
  this	
  or	
  shareholder	
  resources	
  on	
  it.	
  
Our	
  job	
  is	
  to	
  be	
  focused	
  on	
  the	
  business	
  and	
  deliver	
  results.	
  We'll	
  let	
  the	
  regulators	
  
decide	
  what	
  they	
  want	
  to	
  do	
  with	
  the	
  information.	
  	
  


Analysis: Mr. Alireza begins his response with a false start, and then states, “I have 
been given advice not to spend a lot of time talking about this thing.” This comment  
reflects his adoption of what is known as an “access control” or “avoidance” strategy. 
This approach is often taken in situations where individuals, entities, or both are 
attempting to conceal information, particularly acts of wrongdoing. In doing so, they 
often make statements that reveal an unintended message as to how they plan to 
accomplish the concealment. In this case, Mr. Alireza’s plan was to cite advice he had 
been given to avoid spending a lot of time talking about the matter. Typically, we find 
that this approach is taken in crisis situations. Mr. Alireza subsequently provides a 
lengthy string of convincing statements, a form of persuasion behavior in which he is 
focused on convincing his audience of the reputable nature of his company rather than 
conveying information that speaks directly to the matter at hand. This is followed by an 
equally lengthy attack on the individual whom he claims is responsible for the negative 
commentary. Such an attack is a form of aggression behavior that is indicative of a 
person’s feeling that he has been backed into a corner by the facts, and so has no 
recourse but to lash out in response. 


<Q	
  -­‐	
  Neil	
  Hume>:	
  Hi.	
  I	
  think	
  you've	
  sort	
  of	
  answered	
  a	
  lot	
  of	
  the	
  questions	
  we	
  had.	
  But	
  
just	
  going	
  back	
  just	
  to	
  Iceberg	
  very	
  quickly,	
  I	
  mean	
  what	
  makes	
  –	
  I	
  mean	
  can	
  you	
  give	
  us	
  
a	
  bit	
  more	
  detail	
  on	
  what	
  makes	
  you	
  think	
  this	
  report	
  was	
  written	
  by	
  an	
  ex-­‐employee?	
  	
  


And	
  also,	
  if	
  I	
  heard	
  you	
  correctly,	
  I	
  mean	
  you're	
  sort	
  of	
  saying	
  that	
  you're	
  not	
  going	
  to	
  
take	
  any	
  legal	
  action	
  against	
  him.	
  You're	
  just	
  going	
  to	
  let	
  the	
  regulators	
  deal	
  with	
  this	
  
report.	
  Can	
  you	
  just	
  explain	
  why	
  you've	
  taken	
  that	
  decision	
  as	
  well?	
  	
  


<A	
  -­‐	
  Yusuf	
  Alireza>:	
  So	
  we	
  don't	
  want	
  to	
  get	
  into	
  detail,	
  for	
  obvious	
  reasons,	
  from	
  a	
  


Page 13 of 14
regulatory	
  perspective,	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  why	
  we	
  believe	
  we	
  know	
  who	
  it	
  is.	
  But	
  we	
  have	
  a	
  
high	
  degree	
  of	
  confidence	
  that	
  we	
  know	
  who	
  it	
  is	
  and	
  we've	
  provided	
  that	
  information	
  
to	
  the	
  regulators.	
  	
  


Listen,	
  why	
  are	
  we	
  not	
  going	
  to	
  take	
  action	
  against	
  this	
  employee	
  that	
  we	
  fired	
  is	
  
because	
  that's	
  not	
  we	
  want	
  to	
  be	
  focused	
  on	
  from	
  the	
  management	
  team,	
  and	
  that's	
  
not	
  what	
  we	
  want	
  to	
  do	
  with	
  shareholder	
  equity	
  and	
  shareholder	
  capital.	
  Our	
  focus	
  is	
  
to	
  deliver	
  results.	
  At	
  the	
  end	
  of	
  the	
  day,	
  our	
  stakeholders	
  will	
  judge	
  us	
  not	
  by	
  an	
  
anonymous	
  blogger,	
  right,	
  but	
  by	
  our	
  results.	
  And	
  that's	
  what	
  we're	
  going	
  to	
  focus	
  on,	
  
our	
  results.	
  If	
  he's	
  broken	
  any	
  laws,	
  then	
  I	
  think	
  it's	
  the	
  regulators'	
  responsibility	
  to	
  
pursue	
  that.	
  It's	
  just-­‐	
  	
  


Analysis: Citing regulatory reasons, Mr. Alireza refuses to explain why Noble believes 
that an ex-employee wrote the Iceberg report. Rather than provide a substantive 
rationale for not taking legal action against the suspected author of the report, Mr. 
Alireza simply provides a series of convincing statements that are designed to convince 
investors that the allegations levied in the Iceberg report are attributable to a 
disgruntled ex-employee, and therefore have no merit.
