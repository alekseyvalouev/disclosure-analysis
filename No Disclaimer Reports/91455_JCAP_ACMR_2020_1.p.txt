Dirty business


We believe ACM Research (ACMR) is a fraud, over-reporting both revenue and profit. What real profit the company has is appar-
ently being siphoned off to related parties. 


ACMR faces a cash crunch even with a reported $86 mln in the bank. 
ACMR is borrowing at high rates of interest, and the company is push-
ing to IPO substantially all the company assets in Shanghai in order 
to raise cash. This will significantly dilute U.S. investors.


We visited ACMR sites in China, Korea, and California, accessed credit 
reports on ACMR subsidiaries, reviewed ACMR’s exchanges with 
Shanghai regulators, and conducted more than 40 interviews. This 
work brings us to conclude the following:


 ‣ ACMR reports industry-beating gross margins of 47%. We be-
lieve the real gross margins are half that at best. That would 
wipe out the company’s net profit.


 ‣ We estimate that revenue is overstated by 15-20%.


 ‣ We have evidence that undisclosed related parties are diverting 
revenue and profit from the company


 ‣ Key means by which ACMR tunnels over-reported profit out of 
the company may be through about $20 mln in overstated in-
ventory costs and through cash that is inflated or just compro-
mised. We think least $11 mln in warranty and service costs are 
understated.


 ‣ ACMR appears to be strapped for cash in spite of the $86 mln 
reported on the balance sheet. ACMR had $25.77 mln in short-
term borrowings in Q2 2020, up by $21.88 mln QoQ and at aver-

age annualized borrowing cost of 6.1% compared with annualized 
interest income of 1.3%. ACMR’s CEO has personally guaranteed 11 
of 13 short-term “lines of credit” issued on the mainland.


Founded in Silicon Valley in 1998, ACMR never realized its ambition to 
make original electroplating equipment for the semiconductor industry and 
turned to cleaning equipment instead. Limping, with just $27 mln in rev-
enue and making losses in its 18th year of operations, the company found 
Roth Capital Partners and managed to list in 2017. Now Chinese in all but 
headquarters, ACMR pitches itself as a high-tech inventor that makes far 
more money than industry leaders like Screen and Tokyo Electron. Much 
of the evidence we have found indicates that is a lie. We estimate that 
ACMR makes much less profit, that revenue is 15-20% lower than claimed, 
that related parties are pulling money out of the company, and that at least 
$40 mln in assets simply do not exist. 


The team around ACMR is better known for stock promotion than for man-
agement. The former ACMR CFO, Xu Min, who left soon after the IPO to 
join China Online Education Group, was previously CFO of well-known 
fraud UTStarcom.1 Before that, Xu was a research analyst at Roth covering 
cleantech. Lisa Yilu Feng, CFO of the China subsidiary, formerly worked

at Lumenis, an Israeli company at which two top executives were charged 
with revenue accounting fraud to inflate sales.2


The company’s auditor is Daniel Ho of BDO Shu Lun Pan. He has audited 
other companies widely regarded as frauds such as Orient Paper, now a 
penny stock trading as IT Tech, and Origin Agritech (SEED).


Hyped
We think ACMR overstates the price of many of its machines by about 
20%. The actual costs, revenue, and profit are hidden when the company di-
verts revenue from over 90% of sales to five on-paper-only companies. The 
company reports an average price of $3.6 mln3 for its single-wafer cleaning 
machines, while we estimate $2.8 mln per machine. One of the very few 
customers that did not go through a sales agency in 20194 told us within a 
narrow range what the company had paid for two wafer-cleaning machines 
purchased in 2019. ACMR disclosures show prices 15-22% higher than this 
customer reported to us. 


Grossly overstated margins
Not only is revenue overstated, but we have a mountain of evidence show-
ing inflated profits.


We believe that Screen Holdings, which commands roughly 40% of the

world market for wafer-cleaning equipment, is the company most directly 
comparable to ACMR. Screen owns more technology and more manufac-
turing equipment. Screen reports gross margins of 23.7%.


ACMR gets $300,192 in revenue per employee. Meanwhile, Screen gets 
$568,869. Those numbers make ACMR reported margins more or less im-
possible.


Building stuff without equipment5


The true nature of ACMR’s business is readily available for investors to see 
in the company’s disclosures. ACMR has virtually no capital equipment. 
So-called “manufacturing equipment” at cost on the balance sheet in Q2 
2020 amounted to $3.9 mln. This equipment was actually reduced in 2019 


5  ACMR claims higher margins based a different set of comparables: Amec, Kingsemi, 
HZCCTECH, and the whole business of Naura, not just its equipment business (the company 
does not separately disclose margin on wafer-cleaning machines). These companies are 
making equipment that is of much higher value and with higher tech content.


“Amec and ACMR are not in the same industry,” an AMEC customer-service agent told us 
when interviewed in August. “Amec’s products are totally different from theirs,” said an 
engineer there. This sentiment was echoed in all our four interviews with Amec executives.


Kingsemi derives just 1% of revenue from cleaning equipment and 90% from 
photolithography process coating equipment.  Hangzhou Changchuan, or HZCCTECH, makes 
testing equipment. Naura makes a much higher margin on electronic components—60%-- 
than on equipment. We compare AMCR’s margin with Naura’s 35% margin on equipment. We 
chose a comparable group of companies that make similar equipment. The only large, direct 
comparable is Screen.

when production was supposed to “ramp.” The value of office equipment 
added since the start of 2019 greatly exceeds the value of added manufac-
turing equipment.


The company opened a new factory in 2018, yet the amount spent on con-
struction in progress during 2017 and 2018 is negligible, and the depreci-
ated PPE machinery values clearly show older machinery, not brand new 
and still barely depreciated capital assets. 


By far the most valuable piece of equipment in the factory is for testing, 
not production.6

Sensible peer group comparisons show just how little PPE the company has.


ACMR is building a new, 1 mln square foot production and R&D base in the 
Lingang park in Shanghai. Only 11% of the roughly $127 mln being in-
vested is for “equipment and software investment,” while a staggering 31%, 
or $40.9 mln, is for “raw materials for trial production.”7 We question why 
the company needs to capitalize such large amounts of otherwise inventory 
costs for “trial” production when it already has an apparently established 
production process.

Wafer-cleaning technology is a mature and low-margin area, and ACMR 
has opted to be a provider of complete equipment sets rather than a tech-
nological innovator. Single-wafer cleaning technology: “is actually the 
simplest part of the industry and the equipment is so simple,” an industry 
expert told us in a phone call. “And so low tech that Applied, Lam, Tokyo 
Electron don’t bother with it because it’s low tech. The technology really 
hasn’t changed a hell of a lot in 40 years.”


The plugs
When a company inflates its revenue and profit, it has to create fake assets 
to compensate for the missing cash. We have also found invented liabili-
ties and mysterious costs in ACMR’s accounts. Among these problematic 
accounts are inflated cash, inflated inventory, a mysterious liability, under-
stated warranty costs, and R&D costs that should properly be booked as 
cost of sales.


All this massaging of the accounts has apparently created a cash crunch.

At the end of Q2 2020, the company reports 13 outstanding short-term 
loans from Chinese banks totaling $25.8 mln. All but two of the loans are 
guaranteed by the CEO and six are guaranteed by the CEO alone. At end 
of Q2 2020, five of these loans, from the Bank of Shanghai Pudong Branch, 
were almost at maximum borrowing limit, as were two loans from Bank of 
Communications. The average annualized interest paid was just over 6% 
for Q2 2020, much higher than the interest ACMR receives on its cash and 
equivalents (an average of 0.5% in 2019 and 1.3% in Q2 2020). Although 
the maximum disclosed interest rate on borrowings was 4.7%, the higher 
average annualized rate may be a function of related fees and/or a different 
time weighted average debt.


We find this puzzling: why does ACMR require a guarantee from its CEO 
for some $25 mln in loans, when the company in Q2 had $86.4 mln in 
cash? If ACMR prefers not to use its cash, why not collateralize offshore 
dollars for Renminbi? Moreover, these loans are clearly labelled as lines of 
credit, not long-term loans for past capital expenditure, for example. With 
all that cash in the bank, why does the company need “lines of credit”, 13 
of them?

That gap may be explained by cash in the Caymans company that belongs 
to the U.S.-listed entity. But we question why the cash is there when the

company is taking out large short-term lines of credit on mainland China 
and whether the balance can be properly audited in the Caymans.


We suspect that a chunk of cash may be missing from the STAR IPO 
group. The IPO group includes in its account cash deposited overseas:


The Shanghai company has most of the sales and COGS. The Hong Kong 
company exists as a convenience for processing payments in U.S. dollars; 
its net income should be moved promptly to the Shanghai accounts. But 
the Shanghai company shows negative operating cash flows, while the con-
solidated STAR IPO group shows big positive operating cash flows. That 
difference indicates that a lot of cash is circulating offshore with very little 
apparent COGS. If the cash is really there at all.

“Inventory”
There is a large mismatch between what clients have told us and what 
ACMR reports. ACMR claims nearly $20 mln in inventory of delivered ma-
chines—meaning completed machines that have not been paid for and are 
sitting on customer premises. This is an astonishing 45% of total inven-
tory. But most clients say they pay for 90% of their orders by the time of 
delivery and the balance within 30 days of receiving the machine. ACMR 
employees tell us they ship machines as soon as they are assembled. There 
is no room for inventory of completed goods. We believe that the $19.6 mln 
in finished-goods inventory reported by the company is an invention.


One might note that any finished and delivered inventory would be at cli-
ent premises and therefore very difficult for the auditor to check.

Warranty
We estimate the gap between cash outflow for parts and inflow under 
“other” income at roughly $11 mln. This may be under-reported warranty 
or out-of-warranty service repair expense.


There are two types of warranty: a standard product warranty and an ex-
tra warranty, which is sold to the customer. The accrued warranty liability 
was only $3.2 mln as of Q2 2020.  The company recognizes income from 
the extra warranty, but for all warranties and out-of-warranty repairs, 
there is also a cost for spare parts and repairs. In the company’s STAR IPO 
document, it defines “Other Operating Income” as mainly from the sales of 
spare parts and after-sales services, which could be related to repairs either 
in or outside warranties.


Yet in the STAR IPO document’s direct-method operating cash flow state-
ment, the cash paid relating to other operating activities appears signifi-
cantly higher than the associated “other” operating income. The costs are 
much higher than associated cash received and associated “other operating 
income.” This would lead to a gross-margin boost. 


Unreported customer deposits
The company claims that delivered machines at client premises can be un-
paid for up to six months for established customers with repeat orders and 
an incredible 24 months or more--if at all--for “first tool” delivery that may 
not even have a purchase order. This freebie business model of “pay if you 
want to” is not an encouraging growth strategy.


As stated by the company:


“We often incur significant research and development costs for 
products that are purchased by our customers only after much, or 
all, of the cost has been incurred or that may never be purchased. 
We allow some new customers, or existing customers considering 
new products, to evaluate products without any payment becoming 
due unless the product is ultimately accepted, which means we may 
invest a significant amount in manufacturing a tool that may never 
be accepted and purchased or may be purchased months or even 
years after production.” 


“When we deliver evaluation equipment, or a “first tool,” we may 
not recognize revenue or receive payment for the tool for 24 months 
or longer. Even returning customers may take as long as six months 
to make any payments. If our sales efforts are unsuccessful after

expending significant resources, or if we experience delays in com-
pleting sales, our future cash flow, revenue and profitability may 
fluctuate or be materially adversely affected.”


We have found disparities between the company’s disclosures and our 
interview evidence of customer deposits. Only one customer, SK Hynix, 
reported the same terms as the company reported. All small customers 
reported paying 30-40% on ordering.


According to the company, some of these machines are “demo” models, 
also customized which reduces the potential for resale. But every customer 
we spoke with except one reported the same payment terms: 30% down-
payment on placing the order, 60% when the order is shipped, and 10% 
when the client tests and accepts the equipment. 


Advances from customers were $8.42 mln at end 2018 when full year rev-
enue was $74.64 mln. By end Q2 2020, advances from customers were $8.78 
mln, yet annualized Q2 2020 revenue was $156.2 mln (4 x $39.05 mln).

Revenue has basically doubled, while advances from customers have stayed 
flat. Customer deposits should at least match the momentum in business 
activity. 


Magically appearing liability
In Q2 2020, ACMR reported a financial liability of $15.1 mln, which essen-
tially appeared out of nowhere. Creating a new liability helps the company 
work off fake assets.


The liability had arisen out of a complicated series of back-and-forth trans-
actions between AMCR in the U.S. and ACMR Shanghai. The Shanghai 
company had received $2.98 mln for warrants issued to an employee-
owned company—and had lent that company the money to buy the war-
rants. ACMR Shanghai passed the obligation to U.S. shareholders then up-
valued it to $15.1 mln. Presto, U.S. shareholders lose $15.1 mln in assets.8 


Skimming
We think ACMR management is using five on-paper-only companies to 
divert money. In September, we learned more about this process. We ob-
tained ACMR’s responses to questions from Chinese regulators9 about its 
IPO application, and in those documents, ACMR discloses that almost all 
its sales run through “agents.”

We have gotten detailed pricing and invoicing information from six of 
ACMR’s top clients. Five of them had paid more for equipment than ACMR 
disclosed. We think that extra payment was diverted, possibly to manage-
ment via an “agent” or possibly back to the SOE customer.

Note that Hanwool—which was started and continues to be operated by 
the director of ACM Korea, according to his LinkedIn profile--made 100% 
of its sales for ACMR and yet is labeled as “not dependent” on ACMR.


We went back to procurement managers at the largest customers, and 
three agreed to detailed interviews. None of the three had heard of the 
agents that ACMR reported were responsible for their sales. The customers 
we spoke with are some of the largest and together represent the majority 
of disclosed sales.


ACMR discloses that 91% of its sales are made through the five sales 
agents.

At least three of these agents are related parties whose relationship has not 
been disclosed to U.S. investors.


Related party A: Lida Technology
Lida is responsible for 41% of ACMR 2019 sales and is owned by an un-
disclosed related party. The ¥15.26 mln commission that ACMR reported 
paying to Lida in 2019 represented 45% of Lida’s income.10 These facts are

Lida owner Wang Beiyi is also a supplier to ACMR, owner of an agency 
selling on behalf of ACMR, and a shareholder of both the Chinese IPO ve-
hicle and U.S.-traded company. ACMR owns 15% the company that Wang 
uses to sell “filters etc.” to ACMR. ACMR makes the ridiculous claim that 
Wang’s company, Shengyi Semiconductor Technology (Wuxi) Co., Ltd., 
sells them filters—a commodity product that is super abundant in Chi-
na—for 62% less than competitors.


Lida is currently a Hong Kong-registered company. Prior to 2018, the 
company was registered in the U.K. Wang Beiyi owned one-thirds of the 
equity, and the other third belonged to someone with the same name as

A little on the side
We think Lida Technology is skimming money from ACMR by book-
ing some of the sales on its own account instead of giving the revenue to 
ACMR.


We interviewed several people involved with building and selling ACMR’s 
electroplating devices, which are all sold by Lida.12 The interviewees gave 
us a clear count of how many the company had produced in 2015-2019. 
ACMR reported making far fewer electroplating machines indicated in 
interviews with two former executives with direct knowledge of the elec-
troplating operation.

Executives are cagey about the electroplating equipment. When asked 
whether ACMR builds electroplating equipment, one executive told us that 
was a “trade secret” and hung up the phone. Several others claimed the 
company was not making the machines at all. We speculate that is because 
the machines are being sold by a related party and not by ACMR.


ACMR shoulders a portion of the costs of electroplating by putting costs 
onto the R&D budget. We have interviewed ACMR executives in charge of 
making electroplating equipment. They are on the R&D staff.  The compa-
ny receives about $3 mln in government subsidies for electroplating tech-
nology, but ACMR executives told us that their electroplating “R&D” activ-
ity consists of designing and building custom machines for customers. 


Related party B: Hanwool
The head of Hanwool Scientific, agent for sales to SK Hynix, has simulta-
neously headed ACM Korea since 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
ACMR discloses that its Korean subsidiary has hired all the Hanwool 
staff—but the Hanwool account remain separate. On page 8-1-118 of its 
“first response” to the Chinese regulator, on August 11, 2020, the company 


says: “Currently, the Hanwool Scientific Co. Ltd. team has already joined 
ACM Korea.”


Hanwool is always paired in the company’s sales disclosures with TJM 
Partners Ltd., which we think is also a related party.

We believe that Hanwool and TJM are also diverting income for ACMR 
products. 


We have interviewed several current and former executives of SK Hynix. 
They told us that the company inventory lists three more machines than 
ACMR has disclosed selling. 


ACMR’s key supplier in Korea, Ninebell Co. Ltd. stores finished inven-
tory for ACMR. When our investigator visited Ninebell, on premises were 
ACMR machines bearing the Ultra trademark. Ninebell is disclosed as a 
supplier to ACMR, not a sales agent; the fact that machines are on prem-
ises at Ninebell indicates that they are being sold by a third party.

Kickback how-to
The agents represent a pass-through that is common in China, where buy-
ers at state-owned companies often demand kickbacks in order to place 
orders. Companies that want to distance themselves from the kickbacks 
direct the companies to make payments to “distributors” that are willing to 
issue an inflated invoice to the company then pay the kickback out of the 
over-billed portion. The SOE buyer is the goat. No one pays much attention 
to a state-owned company’s expenditures, and it’s common for company 
managers to skim. 


But at ACMR, the company, not the agent, issues the invoice. Given the 
large disparity between reported payments and ACMR’s reported average 
prices, we believe ACMR must be actively facilitating payment either to

A lot of money has disappeared in the sales agencies. Our interviews with five 
customers, representing the majority of ACMR revenue, indicate that they pay 
significantly more than the company discloses receiving—the difference may 
be kicked back to customers or may be diverted to management, or both.13 14 15


The sales agents are certainly not motivated by sales commissions. The 
commissions are low, and ACMR takes a very long time to pay them. Ac-
cording to the STAR IPO document company filings, sales commission 
expense for 2019 was $3.9 mln while accrued commission rose from $2.9

How do auditors fail to see the diverted payments? Probably because 
ACMR obscures the transactions via its Hong Kong subsidiary, CleanChip. 
We know from disclosures that clients sign big framework agreements 
spanning several years. On page 320 of the June 1,2020 8K, ACMR pro-
vides a table of â€œmaterial sales contracts.â€� That table includes a contract 
with SK Hynix for $41.76 mln, for delivery â€œSubject to the contract/order.â€� 
It includes a contract with Shanghai Huali, also to be delivered â€œSubject 
to the contract/order,â€� for $37.28 mln. These contract amounts exceed the 
amounts that each customer paid in any one year.

In other words, contracts cover several years, and when customers make 
payments, auditors would not necessarily be able to match the payments to 
specific purchases.


What R&D?
We think most of the $12.9 mln spent on R&D is actually a cost of goods 
sold. Our interviews indicate that a big chunk of R&D activity consists of 
customizing and building machines for sale.


One of the company’s response documents to the Shanghai exchange in-
dicates that ACMR does not even receive the subsidy funding for its R&D 
projects. Funding for research into electroplating technology, by far the 
largest piece of funding, goes to the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Research 
Center Co. Ltd.

We also believe that “R&D” activity is used to enable tax-free imports. 
China exempts domestic equipment from taxes under certain condition if it 
is produced for R&D.16 In the itemized tax-payable table of ACMR’s disclo-
sures, there is no disclosed Value-Added Tax (VAT) payable: this is highly 
unusual and in fact almost impossible for an equipment maker.


We think the company improperly claims tax exemptions by reporting 
that parts are imported as part of its capital investment and for R&D 
when really these are raw materials for operational production. A sup-
plier told us he believes the CEO, David Wang, may hand-carry some of 
the components to China. This would seem too petty a means for evading 
taxes, but there is evidence from the disclosures that it is true. ACMR had 
to pay a fine on October 9, 2019 for a false declaration at the Shanghai 
Pudong International Airport, where ACMR staff apparently carried parts 
“used for power of silicon chip cleaning machine.”17 Procuring inventory 
via staff air luggage is not sustainable for a publicly listed company that 
claims to be expanding operations.

Budget for the new plant in Shanghai betrays mis-
categorization of R&D costs.
The Shanghai construction project includes a budget of $41.1 mln for “R&D 
materials,” nearly four times the investment in hardware and 64% of the 
budgeted costs. This is separately itemized from “hardware investment” 
and budgeted far lower, at $11.7 mln. Yet the reported “material consump-
tion for R&D” in 2019 amounted to $3.8 mln. We get it that R&D projects 
can last for years, but to budget the equivalent of over 10 years of R&D 
“materials” is a stretch. Depreciation of fixed assets for R&D alone is virtu-
ally identical to the depreciation and amortization for the STAR IPO listed 
entity overall. This strongly suggests that virtually all PPE must be related 
to R&D rather than manufacturing processes. 


In total, the $41.1 mln for R&D materials and $40.9 mln for trial produc-
tion materials amount to an astonishing $82 mln, equating to some 1.4 
times the $56.9 mln 2019 cost of goods sold, or 1.8 times an already bloat-
ed end-2019 inventory amount. Redirecting inventory to project construc-
tion and R&D costs also comes with dubious tax benefits.


A former longtime R&D employee of ACMR told us that when he joined 
the company, “I felt there was no technological content in their product. 
A components supplier who has known ACMR for a decade told us: “They 
don’t have much in way of R&D, a lab, manufacturing. It’s an assembly 
operation.” 


Some assembly required
We have spoken with a half dozen production workers at ACMR’s Shang-
hai plant, with more than a dozen suppliers, and with customers. We have 
concluded that ACMR purchases valuable parts from third parties and per-
forms a low-value assembly operation that principally entails connecting 
tubes (the machine “plumbing”) and electrical circuits and then testing the 
machines. That is contrary to the bull case on ACMR: company presenta-
tions constantly stress “differentiated megasonic technology” and “propri-
etary technology.”18

A longtime ACMR sales executive told us customers identify products by 
searching images online. The company does not have a Chinese-language 
website, and a he told us that to find products, we should search Baidu. 
“That’s what I do. I search with the term ‘ACM Research semiconductor.’” 
Clients provide ACMR with specifications, and ACMR builds the machine 
to order, with assembly taking about two weeks and testing taking another 
two weeks. 


By speaking with the suppliers, we learned that most of them sell to small 
factories that pre-assemble portions of the machines. The ACMR staff then 
connect up the plumbing and electrical circuits at the company’s factory in 
Shanghai and on customer premises.


ACMR U.S.: ACMR in California is the company’s largest supplier, purchas-
ing “valves, contacts, etc.” in the United States and shipping them to China. 
This channel is rife with opportunity for hiding costs.


Before 2019, ACMR was both a supplier and a “customer” for ACMR in 
China. That simply obscures the transaction chain for auditors. 


We visited the ACMR office in California. The company reports five staff 
there. No one was on premises between 3:30 and 5 in the afternoon on a 
Wednesday. The company reports it pays $3,600 per month for the space; 
neighbors with similar spaces told us they paid from $1,400-$1,700. The 
amount, if overstated, is immaterial. But over months of looking at this 
company, we have come to feel that every number it publishes is inflated.


ACMR sales 
told us they 


have no product 
catalogue: 


they just 
search "ACMR 
equipment" on 


Baidu.

Ninebell: We have evidence that Ninebell is buying the robotic arms it 
sells to ACMR from a Japanese supplier.


ACMR owns just a 20% stake in Ninebell but provides all or almost all 
of that company’s revenue. Based on a credit report we purchased and on 
ACMR’s disclosures, in 2019, Ninebell had $8.9 mln in revenue and ACMR 
made $8.9 mln in purchases from Ninebell. The number presumably in-
cludes taxes and duties. ACMR has substantial influence and control over 
Ninebell, and as a result there is a strong case that it should be fully con-
solidated into ACMR’s financial statements, including Ninebell’s liabilities, 
and any inventory it may hold on behalf of ACMR.


Curiously, with $8.9 mln in purchases, ACMR could not have obtained even 
half of its robotic arm assemblies from Ninebell. We learned in a lengthy 
interview that the assemblies cost about $650,000. At this price, the 2019 
value of procurement would have paid for 14 robotic arms at most, while 
the company used at least 32.


On page 6 of the June 2020 8K, ACMR discloses: “NINEBELL is the main 
supplier of robot arms used in the transport system of our wafer cleaning 
equipment.” But our investigator visited Ninebell in the Seongnam suburb 
of Seoul and found that the company was buying robotic arms from the 
Japanese company Yaskawa.

Ninebell is a mysteriously low-tech company. It originally provided office 
printers to business clients then developed a second business line in ro-
botics. We spoke with two robotics associations in Korea, and neither had 
heard of Ninebell.


The archived site shows a business registration number for Ninebell the 
printing company that is the same as that for Ninebell robotics. Accord-
ing to the archived website, Moon-soo Choi is the founder of the business 
printer company. Choi is head of the robotics company.

2019


ACMR owns 20%. Original company rents out office printers to 
businesses. Current business appears to do software integration for 


robotic parts. A longtime ACMR executive told us that Ninebell is 
simply a pass-through for ACMR. We believe Ninebell has no original 


technology.


ACMR (US) 8K
$10.7 mln in 


2019


ACMR discloses that the U.S. company purchases parts and ships 
them to China. However, U.S. bills of lading show no exports by ACMR. 


Because the volume of manufacturing is small—about 25 machines 
per year—and the most valuable parts relatively small, the parts could 


be carried into China, thus avoiding import tariffs.

We spoke with eight company representatives. Seven said ACMR was 
not a client. One named all the company's clients and insisted "I can

Dilution everywhere
At $71.88 per share, some 5.3 times higher than the share price of $13.49 
a year ago, the company’s P/E is now a stratospheric 77 times on a historic 
EPS basis. This compares to a trailing P/E of some 25 for NASDAQ, and far 
in excess of many reputable companies. This company is trading as if it 
were a high-tech company with great corporate governance; it is not.


The sale of subsidiary shares to pre-IPO investors already reduced U.S. 
NASDAQ shareholders’ ownership of the company’s primary operations by 
8.33%, to 91.67%, and the proposed STAR IPO will further dilute owner-
ship down to 82.5% with a very questionable use of proceeds. The com-
pany’s last 10K also warns ACM Shanghai from the STAR IPO may issue 
options, and other forms of share-based compensation to its directors, lead-
ing to even more US shareholder owner dilution.


From the end of 2018 to end Q2 2020, the NASDAQ listed Class A and 
Class B basic share count increased from 16.009 mln to 18.053 mln, a dilu-
tion of 13%.


There is also further risk of a huge increase in share count from the po-
tential exercise of a gigantic number of stock options, which the company 
does not include in its diluted EPS calculation on the basis that their im-
pact would be anti-dilutive.


Up until and including the end of December 2018, the company explained 
potential dilutive securities were excluded from the diluted EPS calcula-
tion “due to our net loss for those periods”, even though for 2018 it in fact 
reported a small positive net income and earnings per share. These ex-
cluded securities can potentially expand the share count by a further 23% 
based off the end December 2019 number of shares.


In addition to shares issued in a follow on offering and stock option ex-
ercises already taken place, the last 10K disclosed the company issued 
1,344,764 Class A unregistered shares during 2019 pursuant to stock op-
tion conversion at exercise prices between $0.75 and $3.00 per share, a tiny 
fraction of the current share price. We believe a subsequent registration for

these shares was later withdrawn but can reappear at a later date. It is not 
clear whether the related stock options were counted as dilutive or anti-
dilutive. Knowing what stock options are dilutive or not Is important.


U.S. Class A shareholders deserve a more thorough explanation about what 
“iron cast” dual class anti-dilutive provisions exist to protect them from 
continuous withering dilution on a stock with a P/E multiple of 77 times.


Share sales
On September 3 and 4, CEO David Wang disclosed his plan to sell $11.4 
mln in ACMR shares, about 12% of his holdings. This is not the action of 
someone who has confidence in his company’s future. These sales of U.S. 
NASDAQ-listed shares make a mockery of Wang’s agreement to lock up 
and not sell shares of ACM Shanghai for a three-year period after the com-
pletion of the STAR IPO.


The vice president of sales, Chen Fuping, exercised 17,946 options at $3 
last September.20


Customers on the U.S. blacklist
On September 8, shares of ACMR fell by 30% based on a rumor that the U.S. 
Department of Commerce would blacklist a key customer, Semiconductor 
Manufacturing International (SMIC). Shares in SMIC had closed down 
23% in Hong Kong on September 4, following reports that the U.S. might 
blacklist the company.21 Being added to the U.S. “entity list” would mean 
that U.S. companies would need a special license to do business with SMIC. 
SMIC is currently on a S&P BBB- rating, just above junk bond level. Shares 
have come back, but we believe based on conversations with U.S. govern-
ment sources that SMIC will ultimately be blacklisted. We think there is 
a possibility that all of ACMR’s Chinese customers—about 80% of sales, if 
SK Hynix is reclassified as Korean—will come under U.S. sanctions. Selling 
low-quality equipment for discount prices, ACMR is able to penetrate inde-
pendent Chinese fabs that earn government subsidies for buying “domes-
tic.” But ACMR will not penetrate companies like Intel and TSMC, which 
require reliability and a track record. That means that the ACMR market is 
much more vulnerable to U.S. sanctions than are peers.
