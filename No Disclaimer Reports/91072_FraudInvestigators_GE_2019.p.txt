GENERAL ELECTRIC, A BIGGER FRAUD THAN ENRON


Summary: GE’s $38 Billion in Accounting Fraud 
www.gefraud.com  
by Harry Markopolos, CFA®, CFE 


Synopsis:
	 This	is	my	accounting	fraud	team’s	ninth	insurance	fraud	case	in	the	past	nine	years	and	it’s	the	biggest,	bigger	
than	Enron	and	WorldCom	combined.	In	fact,	GE’s	$38	Billion	in	accounting	fraud	amounts	to	over	40%	of	GE’s	market	
capitalization,	making	it	far	more	serious	than	either	the	Enron	or	WorldCom	accounting	frauds.	Enron’s	CEO,	Jeff	
Skilling	resigned	on	August	14,	2001,	Enron	was	downgraded	to	junk	status	on	November	28th	and	filed	for	bankruptcy	
protection	on	December	2nd.	On	March	11,	2002	WorldCom	received	document	requests	from	the	SEC	related	to	its	
accounting	and	loans	to	officers;	on	April	30th	CEO	Bernie	Ebbers	resigns	regarding	his	$400	million	in	personal	loans	
from	the	company,	then	on	June	25th	CFO	Scott	Sullivan	is	fired	before	WorldCom	files	Chapter	11	on	July	21st.	It’s	been	
17	years	since	WorldCom	so	we’re	long	overdue	for	something	like	GE.	As	you	read	our	slide	deck	you’ll	see	that	GE	
utilizes	many	of	the	same	accounting	tricks	as	Enron	did,	so	much	so	that	we’ve	taken	to	calling	this	the	“GEnron”	case.	
	 To	prove	GE’s	fraud	we	went	out	and	located	the	8	largest	Long-Term	Care	(LTC)	insurance	deals	that	GE	is	a	counter-
party	to,	accounting	for	approximately	95%	or	more	of	GE’s	exposure.	Either	these	8	insurance	companies	filed	false	
statutory	financial	statements	with	their	regulators	or	GE’s	financial	statements	are	false.	We’ll	show	you	the	losses	from	
each	reinsurance	arrangement	in	both	dollar	losses	and	percentage	losses	and	let	you	determine	who	is	telling	the	truth.	
	 We	paid	to	use	the	National	Association	of	Insurance	Commissioners	(NAIC)	and	AM	Best	Databases	to	access	these	
8	insurers’	statutory	financial	statements	filed	with	the	relevant	state	insurance	commissions.	What	they	revealed	
was	GE	was	hiding	massive	loss	ratios,	the	highest	ever	seen	in	the	LTC	insurance	industry,	along	with	exponentially	
increasing	dollar	losses	being	absorbed	by	GE.	The	GE	Capital	insurance	unit	with	the	largest	losses	is	ERAC	and	that	
unit’s	average	policy-holders’	age	is	now	75.	The	losses	in	this	unit	led	to	GE’s	unexpected	late	2017/early	2018	$15	
Billion	reserve	hit.	Unfortunately,	the	fast	approaching	5-year	age	group	between	76-80	will	see	a	77%	increase	in	LTC	
claims	filed	which	will	see	GE’s	losses	increase	several-fold.	We	expect	to	soon	see	loss	ratios	of	750%	to	1,000%	or	more	
on	some	of	GE’s	reinsurance	agreements.	According	to	industry	data,	approximately	86%	of	GE’s	LTC	claims	are	ahead	of	
them	and	the	accompanying	losses	are	growing	at	an	exponential	and	un-survivable	rate.	
	 Of	the	$29	Billion	in	new	LTC	reserves	that	GE	needs,	$18.5	Billion	requires	cash	immediately	while	the	remaining	
$10.5	Billion	is	a	non-cash	GAAP	charge	which	accounting	rules	require	to	be	taken	no	later	than	1QTR	2021.	These	
impending	losses	will	destroy	GE’s	balance	sheet,	debt	ratios	and	likely	also	violate	debt	covenants.	Unfortunately,	GE	
has	almost	no	cash,	so	they	had	to	request	special	forbearance	from	the	Kansas	Insurance	Department	(KID)	to	be	able	
to	fund	their	January	2018	$15	Billion	reserve	increase	over	a	7-year	time	horizon,	so	the	odds	of	them	being	able	to	
fund	$18.5	Billion	in	new	cash	reserves	is	doubtful.	What’s	even	more	doubtful	is	GE	becoming	cash	flow	positive	in	2021	
as	management	would	have	you	believe.	
	 GE’s	cash	situation	is	far	worse	than	disclosed	in	their	2018	10-K,	in	fact	once	GE’s	$9.1	Billion	accounting	fraud	
tied	to	its	Baker-Hughes	GE	(BHGE)	acquisition	is	accounted	for,	GE	only	had	$495	Million	in	cash	flow	from	operating	
activities	in	2018	and	it	ended	the	year	with	MINUS	$20	Billion	in	working	capital.	After	we	accounted	for	the	$38	Billion	
in	accounting	fraud	GE’s	debt	to	equity	ratio	goes	from	the	3:1	ratio	it	reported	at	the	end	of	the	2nd	quarter	2019	to	a	
woefully	deficient	17:1.	
	 My	team	has	spent	the	past	7	months	analyzing	GE’s	accounting	and	we	believe	the	$38	Billion	in	fraud	we’ve	come	
across	is	merely	the	tip	of	the	iceberg.	To	put	it	into	perspective,	$38	Billion	in	accounting	fraud	is	over	40%	of	GE’s	
market	capitalization	and	we	know	we	only	found	a	portion	of	it.	If	you	love	analyzing	accounting	fraud	as	much	as	we	
do,	we’re	sure	you’ll	find	our	slide	deck	a	gripping	read.

Awareness: 
	 I	first	became	aware	of	GE’s	suspect	accounting	attending	educational	program	luncheons	at	the	CFA®	Society	of	
Boston	in	the	late	90’s.	Chief	investment	officers,	portfolio	managers,	analysts,	and	directors	of	research	would	all	
comment	on	how	they	believed	GE’s	earnings	numbers	couldn’t	be	true	because	they	always	met	or	beat	consensus	
earnings	estimates	every	quarter,	year	after	year,	no	matter	what	the	economy	was	doing.	The	question	around	the	
lunch	table	was	always,	“as an investment manager charged with beating the S&P 500, how much GE stock should you 
put into your portfolios?”	When	GE	had	a	3%	weight	in	the	S&P	500,	if	you	only	had	a	1%	allocation	to	GE,	your	portfolio	
was	effectively	short	GE	by	a	2%	portfolio	weight.	Most	agreed	that	the	proper	thing	to	do	was	to	be	neutral	on	GE	and	
invest	a	3%	benchmark	weight	of	your	portfolio	in	GE	shares	so	that	it	would	neither	hurt	nor	help	your	performance.	
 


GE Is Hiding $29 Billion in Long-Term Care Losses: 
	 There	are	three	key	risks	to	GE’s	survival.	First,	a	stiff	recession	after	ten	years	of	domestic	economic	growth,	will	see	
that	the	next	chapter	in	GE’s	history	is	Chapter	11.	Second,	in	2021	there	isn’t	going	to	be	any	positive	cash	flow,	which	is	
the	fairy	tale	that	GE’s	new	management	team	is	pitching	because	an	accounting	rule	change	for	insurance	liabilities	and	
significant	under-reserving	is	going	to	cause	GE	to	take	$29	Billion	in	additional	reserve	hits	for	its	Long-Term	Care	(LTC)	
liabilities.	Third,	assuming	GE	can	avoid	a	recession	and	somehow	borrow	enough	to	fund	its	LTC	liabilities,	it	will	next	
face	repaying	its	$107	Billion	in	debt	and	also	covering	its	$27	Billion	in	pension	liabilities.	How	is	GE,	a	company	that	
has	almost	no	cash	and	which	earned	a	total	of	only	$14.9	Billion	over	the	last	seven	years,	going	to	out-earn	over	$160	
Billion	in	liabilities	with	the	operating	business	units	it	hasn’t	already	sold	to	stay	afloat?	
	 As	you	go	through	our	presentation	you’ll	see	that	our	“edge”	was	having	two	members	of	my	team	with	extensive	
insurance	fraud	expertise.	They	own	a	forensic	accounting	and	consulting	firm	in	Baltimore	that	specializes	in	this	field.	
	 The	GE	LTC	story	is	very	similar	to	AIG’s	Financial	Products	Corporation	(AIGFP)	and	how	that	ill-fated	unit	destroyed	
AIG’s	share	price	and	resulted	in	a	$189	Billion	government	bailout	to	keep	AIG	alive.	For	many	years	AIGFP	sold	credit	
default	swaps,	took	the	premiums	as	“earnings”	and	never	set	aside	proper	reserves	until	the	2007-2009	Global	Financial	
Crises	revealed	that	the	underlying	securities	AIGFP	was	guaranteeing	were	anything	but	the	solid	credits	AIG	thought	
they	were.	AIG’s	stock	price	enjoyed	those	“earnings”	for	many	years	until	the	risks	became	apparent	too	late	for	AIG	to	
survive	without	government	assistance.	
	 GE’s	LTC	reinsurance	units	are	part	of	GE	Capital	(GEC),	and	GEC	was	very	happy	to	imprudently	account	for	LTC	
insurance	premiums	as	“earnings”	in	the	1980’s,	1990’s	and	2000’s	while	policy-holders	were	still	young	and	weren’t	
filing	claims.	GE	continuously	failed	to	fund	adequate	reserves	to	offset	its	LTC	liabilities,	allowing	itself	to	book	billions	in	
“earnings”	over	a	period	of	decades	and	pay	dividends	to	the	holding	company	and	then	to	shareholders.	
	 We	include	a	2018	LTC	industry	age	chart	in	our	presentation	showing	at	what	ages	LTC	claims	are	filed.	Industry	
data	shows	that	86.2%	of	the	GE-ERAC’s	claims	are	ahead	of	them	so,	if	less	than	14%	of	these	claims	have	already	led	
to	a	$15	Billion	reserve	hit,	simple	math	tells	you	what	the	other	86%	will	do	to	GE’s	balance	sheet.	GE’s	LTC	losses	will	
continue	rising	at	an	exponential	rate	until	it	either	files	for	bankruptcy	protection	or	finds	some	way	to	out-earn	its	
LTC	liabilities.	You’ll	note	that	GE’s	7	March	2019	Teach-In	failed	to	show	you	any	of	the	industry	comparative	data	that	
we’ve	included	in	our	slide	deck.	When	you	see	the	data	we’re	providing	that	compares	GE’s	LTC	loss	ratios	to	the	rest	of	
the	industry’s,	you’ll	know	why	they’re	hiding	their	true	financial	picture	from	you.	
	 Insurance	companies	keep	GAAP	books	if	they’re	public	companies,	but	State	Insurance	Departments	also	require	
them	to	file	Statutory	Financial	Statements	using	a	completely	different	set	of	statutory	accounting	rules,	which	we’ll	call	
SAP	going	forward.	These	are	longer,	more	complex	filings	than	the	10-K’s	that	analysts	use	and	it	takes	special	training	
to	know	what	you’re	looking	for.	But	once	you	know	how,	it’s	easy	to	model	the	differences	between	GAAP	and	SAP	
accounting.	Simply	accessing	and	analyzing	the	SAP	filings	from	the	Long-Term	Care	(LTC)	insurers	who	were	reinsuring	
with	GE-ERAC	showed	us	how	much	GE	was	losing	each	year.	What	we	saw	were	exponentially	growing	losses	that	are	
going	to	bleed	GE	of	additional	cash	such	that	GE	is	unlikely	to	become	cash-flow	positive	in	2021	and	beyond.	
	 GE	twice	went	out	of	its	way	to	intimidate	analysts	on	pages	5	and	12	of	their	7	March	2019	insurance	“Teach-In”	
where	they	blow	smoke	by	saying,	“we are dependent on accurate and timely reporting from over 200 ceding companies 
covered by more than 1,000 reinsurance treaties.”	While	these	statements	are	true,	they	were	also	deceiving	because	
GE	was	including	the	life	insurance,	long-term	disability	and	structured	settlements	portions	of	their	insurance	business	
to	confuse	and	intimidate	analysts	from	looking	into	their	LTC	Statutory	Filings.	Our	analysis	of	GE’s	seven	largest
iii


reinsurance	deals	accounts	for	approximately	95%,	maybe	a	tad	more,	of	GE’s	total	LTC	reinsurance	liabilities.	We	also	
analyzed	GE’s	own	reinsurance	with	failing	reinsurer	LifeCare.	Only	8	of	these	200	ceding	companies	matter	for	LTC	
purposes	and	they	account	for	$29	Billion	in	losses	that	GE	still	hasn’t	acknowledged	or	reserved	for.	If	GE	truly	wanted	
to	provide	investors	with	transparency	they	could	have	easily	have	shown	you	these	8	reinsurance	deals	and	the	steadily	
growing	losses	for	each,	but	they	kept	those	hidden.	Rest	assured,	our	Whistleblower	Report	details	each	reinsurance	
deal	in	Appendix	I	where	each	deal’s	P&L	is	presented	year	by	year,	from	2013	through	2018,	so	that	you	can	see	those	
exponentially	rising	losses	that	GE	doesn’t	want	you	to	know	about.	
	 We	paid	to	use	the	National	Association	of	Insurance	Commissioners	(NAIC)	and	the	AM	Best	databases,	from	which	
we	obtained	the	SAP	filings	for	the	vast	majority	of	LTC	insurance	carriers	that	GE	is	reinsuring.	The	three	relevant	forms,	
with	all	of	the	information	needed	to	determine	that	GE	is	committing	accounting	fraud,	are	found	in	Forms	1	&	2	and	
Exhibit	6.	We	detail	how	we	used	each	form,	why,	and	provide	the	footnotes	so	that	you	can	duplicate	our	work	and	
see	for	yourself	how	GE	is	pulling	the	wool	over	investors’	eyes.	The	eight	carriers	mentioned	in	the	previous	paragraph	
reported	all	of	the	LTC	premiums	taken	in,	policy	claims	paid	out	each	year,	along	with	their	loss	ratios	and	how	the	
losses	were	apportioned	between	themselves	and	GE.	That	was	all	it	took	to	figure	out	GE’s	scheme.	
	 GE	was	able	to	hide	its	LTC	liabilities	for	a	long,	long	time	because	its	actuaries	are	about	as	independent	as	KPMG,	
GE’s	auditor	for	the	past	110	years,	and	the	ratings	agencies.	All	are	getting	paid	by	GE,	so	of	course	they’ll	never	
question	GE’s	LTC	reserves.	That	GE	had	to	add	$15B	to	LTC	reserves,	in	late	2017/early	2018,	which	shocked	GE’s	long-
suffering	investors,	shows	how	independent,	competent	and	credible	their	external	actuaries	and	auditors	are.	
	 We	calculated	GE	should	have	taken	a	reserve	hit	as	early	as	2012,	and	certainly	no	later	than	2015,	but	they	waited	
until	new	management	came	in	and	booked	what	little	reserve	they	could	afford	in	late	2017/early	2018,	a	$15	Billion	
commitment	that	they	had	to	request	a	special	exemption	from	the	Kansas	Insurance	Department	(KID)	to	spread	
over	a	7-year	period	because,	plainly	put,	GE	isn’t	liquid	right	now	and	likely	won’t	survive	long	enough	to	make	their	
last	few	years	of	reserve	payments	anyway.	GE	no	longer	controls	its	destiny	nor	its	cash	flows,	KID	does,	and	that	
state’s	insurance	commission	will	determine	how	much	forbearance	it	receives	when	it	comes	to:	1)	adding	reserves,	2)	
dividend	increases	and	3)	share	buybacks.	
	 GE’s	$15	Billion	LTC	reserve	hit	was	a	nasty	market	surprise	and	it’s	about	to	get	$29	Billion	worse.	Read	our	analysis	
and	then	look	at	the	transcripts	from	GE’s	7	March	2019	“Insurance	Teach-In”	and	ask	yourself	3	questions:	1)	who’s	
being	transparent	–	them	or	us?	2)	who’s	showing	you	GE’s	reinsurance	losses	by	insurance	carrier	by	year,	by	dollar	
amount	–	them	or	us?	and	3)	whose	accounting	do	you	trust	more	–	theirs	or	ours?
	 When	you	benchmark	GE	to	a	responsible	insurance	carrier	using	going	concern	accounting	such	as	Prudential	
(PRU),	GE	needs	$18.5	Billion	in	additional	reserves	in	order	to	be	able	to	pay	claims.	We	compare	GE’s	LTC	policies	to	
Prudential	and	Unum,	two	insurers	with	similar	pre-mid-2000’s	vintage	LTC	policies,	but	whose	policies	have	much	lower	
risk	characteristics	than	GE’s.	Prudential’s	2018	loss	ratio	on	similar	policies	was	185%	and	they’re	reserving	$113,455	
per	policy	while	GE’s	loss	ratios	are	several	times	higher	and	they’re	only	reserving	$79,000	per	policy.	Just	to	match	
Prudential’s	level	of	reserves	would	require	an	immediate	$9.5	Billion	increase	in	reserves.	
	 Unfortunately	for	GE,	the	LTC	policies	they’re	reinsuring	have	much	worse	risk	characteristics	than	PRU’s	and	even	
$113,455	in	reserves	per	policy	totaling	$9.5	Billion,	would	not	be	nearly	enough.	Here	are	the	comparisons	between	the	
two:	
	 1.	 GE’s	Premiums	Per	In-Force	Life	are	only	$1,133	vs.	PRU’s	$2,723.
	 2.	 GE’s	Average	Attained	Age	is	75	vs.	PRU’s	68.
	 3.	 GE’s	%	of	Policies	not	paying	premiums	is	26%	vs.	PRU’s	2%.
	 4.	 GE	provides	Lifetime	Benefits	on	70%	of	its	policies	vs.	PRU’s	24%.
	 5.	 GE	has	no	ability	to	raise	premiums	because	it	is	only	a	reinsurer	while	PRU	can	and	is	able	to	file	its	own	
requests	for	rate	increases	with	state	departments	of	insurance.	
	 Risk	Factor	#	1,	GE	is	taking	in	only	41.6%	of	the	premium	dollars	per	policy	($1,133/$2,723).	The	present	value	
of	GE’s	$1,590	premium	shortfall	($2,723-$1,133)	per	policy	vs	PRU	adds	another	$3.6	Billion	in	additional	required	
reserves.
	 Risk	Factors	#	2	-	#	5	add	another	$5.4	Billion	in	new	required	reserves.	GE’s	benefits	being	paid	out	are	much
iv


higher	since	it’s	on	the	hook	for	lifetime	benefits	on	70%	of	its	policies	and	its	insureds	are	7	years	older	than	PRU’s	and	
far	more	likely	to	be	filing	claims	in	the	very	near	term.	Only	74%	of	GE’s	policies	are	still	paying	premiums	vs	98%	of	
PRU’s.	7%	of	GE’s	LTC	policies	aren’t	paying	premiums	because	those	insureds	have	filed	claims	and	are	receiving	policy	
benefits.	What	GE’s	“Teach	-In”	didn’t	explain	is	why	the	other	19%	of	their	LTC	policies	aren’t	paying	premiums.	There’s	
a	lot	of	additional	critical	information	that	GE	is	withholding	from	public	view	which	we’ve	included	in	our	report,	so	we	
encourage	you	to	read	it.	
	 If	the	$18.5	Billion	in	additional	required	reserves	weren’t	bad	enough,	GE	also	has	a	$10.5	Billion	difference	
between	its	$30.4	Billion	in	statutory	reserves	and	it’s	$19.9	Billion	of	GAAP	reserves.	This	$10.5	Billion	difference	will	
lead	to	a	$10.5	Billion	non-cash	charge	to	earnings	between	now	and	the	new	insurance	accounting	rule	change	which	
goes	into	effect	in	1QTR	2021.	This	will	result	in	a	devastating	$10.5	Billion	hit	to	GE’s	already	thin	shareholder’s	equity	
cushion	and	put	its	credit	rating	and	debt	covenants	at	grave	risk.	Responsible	insurance	carriers	such	as	PRU	and	Unum	
have	already	taken	these	charges	against	earnings	in	2018	because	they’re	using	going	concern	accounting	while	GE	is	
playing	for	time,	praying	for	miracles	and	trying	to	avoid	bankruptcy.	To	summarize,	GE	is	hiding	$29	Billion	in	additional	
LTC	losses	from	investors	and	our	Whistleblower	Report	will	walk	you	through	the	details	using	figures	provided	by	eight	
of	GE’s	LTC	counter-parties.	Either	those	eight	companies	are	lying	and	reporting	false	data	or	GE	is.	
	 We	will	end	our	LTC	section	with	two	key	questions	for	GE’s	management	regarding	LTC:	1)	make	your	reinsurance	
agreements	public	and	2)	provide	your	LTC	actuarial	assumptions.	


GE Is Hiding $9.1 Billion in Baker Hughes Losses: 
	 GE	originally	structured	its	disastrous	2017	investment	in	Baker	Hughes,	which	combined	the	two	company’s	Oil	
and	Gas	businesses	into	a	new	entity,	Baker	Hughes,	a	GE	Company	(BHGE).	GE	held	a	62.5%	interest	in	BHGE	and	
BHGE	controlled	the	business.	GE	accounted	for	its	holdings	in	BHGE	as	a	Non-Controlling	Interest,	which	was	entirely	
consistent	with	the	substance	of	the	transaction	and	the	nature	of	GE’s	investment	in	the	newly	formed	entity.
	 In	November	2018,	that	accounting	treatment	changed	when	GE	announced	its	plans	to	exit	its	investment	in	BHGE,	
and	sold	101.2	million	BHGE	shares	via	a	secondary	offering,	which	left	it	with	a	50.4%	ownership	interest.	GE	booked	a	
$2.2	Billion	pre-tax	loss	from	that	sale.	GE	improperly	continued	to	account	for	its	shares	in	BHGE	as	a	Non-Controlling	
Interest	in	2018,	despite	the	fact	that	the	substance	of	GE’s	BHGE’s	holdings	was	now	strictly	an	investment,	a	clear	
violation	of	FASB	Accounting	Standards	Codification	810-10-25-38A	“Recognition	–	Variable	Interest	Entities”	and	FASB	
SFAC	No.	8,	BC3.26’s	“Substance	over	Form”	Concept.	However,	if	GE	had	treated	it	as	an	Investment,	as	accounting	rules	
require,	it	would	have	incurred	a	$9.1	billion	loss.	Maintaining	a	50.4%	interest	(non-controlling	interest	threshold)	in	
BHGE	is	a	sham	transaction	with	no	business	purpose	done	solely	so	that	GE	can	create	the	false	impression	that	GE	has	
a	reason	to	keep	$9.1 billion	in	losses	off	of	its	books	in	2018.	


Why Didn’t GE Disclose Its Working Capital of Minus $20.3B and Its Current Ratio of .67?:
	 The	same	$52B	of	Baker	Hughes	assets	and	$22B	of	revenues	are	reported	on	both	GE’s	2018	financial	statements	
and	BHGE’s	where	in	reality,	only	one	entity,	BHGE	actually	controls	these	assets	and	cash	flows.	Backing	out	BHGE’s	
cash	flow	from	operating	activities	(CFOA)	reduces	GE’s	2018	CFOA	from	$2.257B	to	a	meager	$495M.
	 GE’s	2018	year-ending	working	capital	was minus $14.3B with BHGE and minus $20.3B without!	Knowing	this	was	
critical	information	for	investors,	lenders,	vendors,	retirees,	and	regulators	it	was	a	willful	omission	on	their	part	to	
not	provide	customary	working	capital	reporting	and	disclosures	in	their	10-K.	Do	a	word	search	on	“working	capital”	
and	you	will	see	GE	spreads	out	its	discussion	of	working	capital	over	numerous	pages	of	their	10-K	and	only	discusses	
changes	in	working	capital,	but	never	gives	you	a	true	picture	of	how	dire	their	financial	position	is.	We	provide	you	with	
our	working	capital	schedules	for	GE	both	with	and	without	BHGE	on	Slide	104.	
	 We	are	saving	GE’s	worst	for	last,	because	this	is	the	last	chapter	in	our	report,	immediately	ahead	of	Chapter	11.	
GE’s	current	ratio	is	a	stunningly	low	.67	when	you	back	out	the	Baker-Hughes	numbers	from	GE’s	year-end	balance	
sheet.	What’s	impressive	about	GE’s	accounting	is	they	offer	very	little	transparency	in	their	financial	statements,	which	
meant	we	had	to	calculate	GE’s	current	ratio	for	ourselves,	which,	of	course,	we	did	and	you	can	see	how	we	calculated	
it	on	Slide	105.	A	.67	current	ratio	is	many	things,	but	investment	grade	is	not	one	of	them.	Do	a	word	search	for	“current	
ratio”	in	GE’s	2018	10-K	and	ask	yourself	why	it’s	not	there	for	GE’s	industrial	business?	Our	final	three	questions	are	for
v


KPMG,	GE’s	auditors	for	the	past	110	years	dating	back	to	1909:	1)	What	did	you	know?	2)	When	did	you	know	it?	and	3)	
Where’s	your	“Going	Concern	Opinion?”	


How We Analyzed GE and Discovered the Fraud:
	 I	won’t	reveal	every	technique	we	used	because	every	wannabe	accounting	fraudster	out	there	is	going	to	be	
reading	this	section	closely	looking	at	it	as	a	“how	not	to	get	caught”	primer.	There’s	no	point	in	making	them	harder	to	
catch	than	they	already	are.
	 It	took	several	months	of	hard	work	using	dozens	of	publicly	available	sources.	We	read	2002-2018’s	Annual	Reports	
and	10-K’s,	while	modeling	lots	of	different	performance	metrics	and	accounting	entries.	Seeing	GE	change	their	
numbers	without	earnings	restatements	was	alarming	enough.	What	was	worse,	GE	would	change	its	reporting	formats	
every	2-4	years	to	prevent	analysts	from	being	able	to	make	comparisons	across	time	horizons!	In	other	words,	GE	went	
out	of	its	way	to	make	it	impossible	to	analyze	the	performance	of	their	business	units.	Why	would	a	company	do	that?
We	could	only	think	of	two	reasons:	1)	to	conceal	accounting	fraud	or	2)	because	they’re	so	incompetent	they’re	not	
capable	of	keeping	proper	books	and	records.	I’m	not	sure	which	reason	is	worse	because	both	are	bad	and	each	is	a	
path	to	bankruptcy.	
	 One	technique	used	was	what’s	called	Sherlock	Holmes’	“dog	that	didn’t	bark	method”	of	looking	at	what	didn’t	
appear	on	GE’s	financial	statement	but	should	have.	That	“missing	dog”	was	everything	between	top	line	revenue	and	
profit	margin,	in	other	words	all	of	the	many	expenses	it	takes	to	run	a	legitimate	business.	GE	would	post	revenue	
numbers	for	its	business	units	and	then	give	you	their	profits	with	no	expenses	listed	between	the	top	and	bottom	lines.	
	 Other	companies	competing	with	GE,	or	in	the	case	of	Safran,	GE’s	50/50	joint-venture	partner	at	jet	engine	
manufacturer	CFM,	would	report	its	expenses,	R&D	costs,	tax	credits,	etc.,	while	GE,	for	the	same	joint-venture	would	
only	report	the	top	and	bottom	lines.	What	was	most	interesting	here	was	that	Safran	acknowledged	in	their	2017	
Registration	Document	(p.	50)	that	they	were	losing	money	on	each	LEAP	engine	produced	and	only	hoped	to	cover	
their	Cost	of	Goods	Sold	(COGS)	by	the	end	of	the	decade.	So,	if	LEAP	engines	were	over	51%	of	CFM’s	jet	engine	sales	
in	2018,	and	they	didn’t	even	cover	the	COGS	on	each	engine	sold,	how	did	GE	Aviation’s	free	cash	flow	go	up	so	much	
in	2018?	Two	answers	come	to	mind:	1)	GE	Aviation	is	using	gain	on	sale	accounting	using	some	sort	of	mark-to-model	
basis	and/or	2)	GE	is	fabricating	its	numbers.	Keep	in	mind	that	GE	was	caught	doing	both	by	the	SEC	in	August	2009	and	
lightly	punished,	committing	over	$3.4	Billion	in	accounting	fraud	while	GE’s	long-suffering	shareholders	paid	$50	Million	
in	fines	and	management,	KPMG,	and	the	Audit	Committee	all	got	to	keep	their	jobs.	What	lesson	did	GE’s	management	
learn?	If	you	guessed,	accounting	fraud	leads	to	bigger	bonuses	and	no	one	gets	fired	and	no	one	goes	to	jail,	well,	that’s	
my	guess	too.
	 The	analyst	community	fell	for	GE’s	accounting	tricks	hook,	line	and	sinker	by	always	priding	themselves	in	coming	
up	with	methods	to	allocate	GE’s	corporate	overhead	and	expenses	to	the	business	units.	The	most	common	method	
analysts	used	was	revenue-weighting	corporate	overhead	and	allocating	those	expenses	in	accordance	to	each	business	
unit’s	percentage	of	total	revenue.	I	call	that	“chasing	rabbits,”	and	when	you	do	that,	you’re	playing	into	the	accounting	
fraudsters’	hands.	Anyone	who’s	hunted	rabbits	knows	you	can’t	chase	rabbits	and	expect	to	catch	them,	yet	that’s	what	
analysts	are	attempting	when	they’re	allocating	expenses	and	overhead	to	GE’s	business	units.	Instead	analysts	should	
have	been	asking	GE	why	it	wasn’t	allocating	pension	costs,	corporate	overhead	and	other	expenses	to	its	business	units	
in	an	accurate	and	transparent	manner.	
	 One	mantra	I	teach	in	my	advanced	forensic	accounting	seminars	to	Certified	Fraud	Examiners,	Internal	Auditors	
and	Chartered	Financial	Analysts	is,	“Listen to what is said and then look at what they do. Where there’s a difference 
dig in, because that’s where the fraud is.”	GE	tells	investors	it	owns	a	portfolio	of	operating	companies	and	that	it	will	
buy	and	sell	companies	in	order	to	assure	its	continued	growth.	Now	look	at	what	they	do,	they	don’t	provide	stand-
alone	financial	statements	listing	each	business	units’	expenses	such	that	investors	or	outsiders	interested	in	buying	
GE’s	businesses	can	properly	value	them.	I	believe	this	is	a	willful	concealment	to	hide	how	poorly	these	units	are	really	
doing.	It	would	be	much	easier	to	spin	off	units,	sell	units,	and	value	units	that	kept	stand-alone	books	and	records,	yet	
GE	doesn’t	do	that.	
	 On	a	revenue-weighted	basis	during	the	7-year	period	from	2012-2018,	GE’s	industrial	business	units	earned	an	
average	annual	profit	margin	of	14.7%.	But,	GE	on	a	consolidated	basis	only	earned	$14.93	Billion	on	$928.355	Billion	
of	cumulative	revenues	over	that	same	7-year	period	for	a	1.6%	profit	margin	which	is	far	below	GE’s	5.5%	weighted
vi


average	cost	of	capital.	Clearly	something’s	amiss	in	these	numbers	because	they	don’t	pass	the	test	of	reasonableness.	
How	can	the	industrial	units	be	earning	14.7%	while	GE	is	only	earning	1.6%?	Sadly,	the	analyst	community	allowed	GE	to	
get	away	with	not	producing	usable,	transparent	financial	statements	that	might	have	prevented	this	fraud.	
	 GE	might	have	survived	LTC	if	it	had	a	competent	CEO.	Unfortunately,	GE’s	CEO	was	Jeff	“Two-Jet”	Immelt,	an	
executive	who	excelled	at	overpaying	for	value-destroying	purchases	such	as	Alstom	and	Baker	Hughes,	just	in	time	for	
cyclical	downturns.	Faced	with	stagnating	to	declining	revenues,	GE	engaged	in	financial	engineering,	vaporizing	$52.2	
Billion	in	stock	buybacks	from	2012-2018,	which	was	3.5	times	more	than	GE’s	earnings	of	only	$14.9	Billion	over	that	
same	time	period.	GE	also	raised	its	dividend	to	unsustainably	high	levels,	paying	out	$54	Billion,	which	was	3.6	times	
GE’s	earnings,	during	that	key	seven-year	period.	That	$106.2	Billion	unwisely	spent	on	financial	engineering	to	keep	
the	bonus	train	running	could	and	should	have	been	used	to:	1)	pay	for	losses	to	wind-down	GE	Capital;	2)	fund	GE’s	
new	additional	$29	Billion	in	required	LTC	reserves;	and	3)	eliminate	GE’s	$27	Billion	pension	shortfall.	Sadly,	that	$106.2	
Billion	is	gone	forever	and	now	GE	is	on	the	brink	of	insolvency.	The	majority	of	what’s	left	inside	of	GE	Capital’s	black	
box	is	very	likely	unsaleable	unless	GE	is	willing	to	pay	billions	to	get	someone	to	take	these	toxic	liabilities	off	its	hands.	


Clues Missed by Investors and Analysts:
	 Unfortunately,	most	investors	are	not	trained	as	Certified	Fraud	Examiners	(CFE’s)	and	have	no	idea	of	what	forensic	
accounting	analysis	entails.	The	biggest	clue	that	this	is	an	Enronesque	accounting	fraud	were	the	$53.5	Billion	in	
Negative	Surprises	in	2017	and	2018	which	destroyed	over	$130	Billion	in	market	capitalization.	There	were	two	dividend	
cuts	totaling	$8	Billion	per	year,	$15	Billion	added	to	LTC	reserves,	a	$22	Billion	goodwill	writedown	on	Alstom,	and	an	
$8.5	Billion	Long	Term	Service	Agreement	(LTSA)	restatement	of	2016	and	2017	earnings.	When	you	see	that	many	large	
dollar	adjustments	in	such	a	short	time	frame	that’s	not	house-cleaning,	it’s	a	red	flag	that	the	prior	years’	financial	
statements	were	false,	internal	controls	are	weak	to	non-existent,	and	there	are	a	lot	more	cockroaches	in	the	GE	
earnings’	kitchen	that	you	haven’t	seen	yet.	Our	Whistleblower	Report	only	details	$38	Billion	in	accounting	fraud,	but	
we	know	we	didn’t	catch	everything.	Only	GE’s	accounting	department	knows	where	the	rest	of	the	skeletons 
are buried. 
	 One	other	key	clue	was	watching	over	ten	years	of	media	interviews	of	GE	executives.	What	stands	out,	when	
asked	what	went	wrong	with	all	of	these	acquisitions,	asset	sales,	negative	earnings	surprises,	surprise	write-downs	and	
dividend	cuts,	senior	leadership	of	this	company	repeats	the	same	message,	“we’re not here to discuss the past, we’re 
only going to discuss the future.”	This	is	no	surprise	–	from	people	who	have	something	to	hide.	


Concluding Remarks:
	 All	information	contained	within	our	Whistleblower	Report	was	obtained	from	publicly	available	sources,	most	of	
which	cost	nothing	to	procure	such	as	annual	reports,	Society	of	Actuary	Reports,	and	news	articles.	The	only	paid	data	
sources	used	were	the	National	Association	of	Insurance	Commissioners	(NAIC)	and	the	AM	Best	databases.
	 Each	slide	is	extensively	footnoted	so	that	you	can	see	what	source	document	and	page	number	each	piece	of	
information	used	comes	from.	This	will	allow	you	to	duplicate	our	work	and	determine	whether	or	not	you	agree	with	
our	forensic	analysis.	We	have	also	provided	a	listing	of	all	source	documents	used	at	the	end	of	our	presentation	for	
your use. 
 This is a Whistleblower Report not Investment Research. We are not making any investment recommendation 
nor are we offering investment advice. 
	 I	want	to	express	my	sympathy	to	the	one	million	people	who	count	on	GE	for	either	salaries,	healthcare,	or	
pensions.	Make	no	mistake,	GE’s	current	and	past	employees	are	the	victims	here	as	are	GE’s	lenders,	vendors,	and	
customers	all	of	whom	have	to	deal	with	the	aftermath	of	an	accounting	fraud.	The	only	winners	are	GE’s	fat	cat	
executives	who	enriched	themselves	with	undeserved	bonuses	as	they	drove	this	once	proud	beacon	of	American	
business	into	the	ground.	I	encourage	you	to	hold	them	accountable.	
	 Thank	you	very	much	for	taking	the	time	to	read	our	Whistleblower	Report,	we	hope	you	find	it	informative.

Exposing GE’s Accounting Fraud Reveals Little Cash and Almost No 
Balance Sheet 


GE’s 2018 Cash Flow from Operating Activities of $495M is not enough to support 
itself once the fraudulent accounting treatment of Baker Hughes is revealed 


GE’s 2018 working capital was NEGATIVE $20B 


Note: The $495M cash flow from operating activities and the $20B 2018 working capital are related to GE’s Core Industrial Businesses (Non-GE Capital) 


GE’s true debt/equity ratio is 17:1 not 3:1 which will undermine its credit status 


GE’s current ratio is .67 which raises going concern issues

GE Is the Next Enron 


GE has been running a decades long accounting fraud by 
only providing top line revenue and bottom line profits 
for its business units and getting away with leaving out: 


• Cost of Goods Sold 


• SG&A 


• R&D 


• Corporate Overhead Allocations 


To make it impossible to compare GE’s numbers across 
multi-year time periods, GE changes its Financial 
Statement reporting formats every few years.  


This is only detectable by reading at least 10 years’ worth 
of 10-K’s back to back. We read 17 years from 2002-2018 
and that’s how we spotted it.

GE Fails the “Madoff Test”: Conclusion 


If GE’s 14.7% Profit Margins Were Real: 


Where’s the cash? 


$29.0 billion Long Term Care liabilities would be fully reserved 


$27.2 billion pension shortfall would be fully funded  


GE wouldn’t have a BBB+ credit rating and be on credit watch 


GE dividends would be a lot higher than a penny per share  


GE shares would be trading at prices a lot higher than a shoe size

Conclusion: By Failing All of the Above Tests, the Reported Profit Margins Are Not True

Reasons for the Disconnect Between GE’s Net Profit Margin and the 
Reported Profit Margins of Its Business Units 


Source: 2012-2018 GE 10-K 


GE capital is a black box that spits out inexplicable gains and losses 2 


GE is hiding expenses just like the SEC caught them doing in the early 2000’s  3 


GE is not properly allocating corporate overhead in a transparent manner so we can determine what the real 
profit margins for business units are 


4 


GE is baking its ledgers and cooking its books  5 


GE uses “gain on sale ” accounting that shows great reported earnings in the present without the accompanying 
cash flow (Aviation, Power LTSAs) 


6 


GE habitually buys businesses high and sells low leading to massive losses  1 


GE reports great profit margins then moves a company to non-operating status, sells it and books losses 7

What Accounting Tricks Does GE Use to Hide a 17:1 Debt to Equity 
Problem? 


1 
GE uses a mismatch between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Statutory 
Accounting Principles (SAP) to keep $10.5 billion in losses off it books  


2 In Q1 2021, the new accounting rules will stop GE’s financial reporting manipulation 


3 
Despite 2017’s $15 billion* SAP LTC reserve adjustment, GE continues to use overly aggressive 
assumptions to understate LTC reserves by $18.5 billion 


The 2021 accounting rules will require $18.5 billion immediate hit to earnings  4 


5 
GE has gotten away with under-reserving by not disclosing actuarial assumptions or reinsurance 
arrangements 


 * - GE only disclosed it was making $15 billion in capital contributions and not the statutory reserve adjustment. For the purposes of this analysis, the statutory reserve adjustment is assumed to be $15 billion

Accounting Rule Change Will Stop Misleading LTC Financial Reporting 


Source: August 15, 2018, “New Rules Look to Make Insurance Contracts More Transparent for Investors” by Michael Rapoport, Wall Street Journal - www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-look-to-make-insurance-contracts-

Rule Change Will Eliminate Opportunities to Create a GAAP/SAP Reserve Mismatch  


August 15, 2018 
Wall Street Journal The idea, Mr. Kroeker said, is to make sure investors get the most current information on the  


contracts’ value. Insurance contracts can extend over decades, but often the assumptions that 


governed their value at the outset—life expectancy and the costs of long-term care, to name a 


couple—aren’t updated. 


The contracts’ value doesn’t stay current until and unless they become unprofitable for the insurers, 


and then they suffer a big hit to their value all at once, potentially blindsiding investors. As a result, the 


investors may not have a fully accurate idea of how much those contracts are worth under current 


conditions, Mr. Kroeker said .…  


Insurers also will be required to use a standard discount rate to measure their liabilities. The rate will 


be pegged to the yield from high-quality bonds, which is lower than the discount rate many insurers 


use now—the rate they earn on their investment assets. A lower discount rate would increase the 


current value of the obligations on insurers’ balance sheets.

 The test indicated a premium deficiency resulting in the unlocking of reserves and resetting of 


actuarial assumptions to current assumptions. This resulted in a $9.5 billion charge to earnings, 


which included a $0.4 billion impairment of deferred acquisition costs, a $0.2 billion impairment of 


present value of future profits, and an $8.9 billion increase in future policy benefit reserves. We 


commenced integrating these new assumptions into our systems and processes embedded in our 


framework of internal controls over financial reporting and expect to continue the integration in 2018.

And you're saying that basically, all these things moving around were exactly almost 0  
like-for-like with regards to the GAAP impact on your charge? Everything moving around 
was exactly 0, almost exactly 0. 
 
Bob Deutsch, GE Managing Director 
The math is the math, but I can't stress enough the independence of the rigorous process 
we went through. Anthony's work was completed in November -- towards late November, 
well before we even started the actuarial component of the calculations. And so Anthony's 
movement was the 1.9% that you saw the morbidity improvement was the 1.2%. The fact 
that it all came out to $82 million pretax is just the way the math fell out. 
 
Tim Kneeland, GE President and CEO North American Life and Health 
And I think to process, the key we talked about earlier, disciplined process really put us in a 
position where a very thorough review, step-by-step in every single assumption that we 
took, whether it was Anthony and the investment team in their discount rate, whether it 
was morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, all of the individual pieces went through 
a very strict process of challenges. As a matter of fact, 2 levels of challenges internally as 
well as external challenges in order to make sure that the assumptions that we relied upon 
were well vetted and that we are confident in them when we book those results.

Here Is What GE’s “Teach-In” Did Not Teach 


5 GE holds unmarketable LTC that it was unable to spin-off to Genworth or sell to Swiss RE 


6 
GE entered into one of the worst retrocession agreements with an under-capitalized reinsurer that cannot honor its 
reinsurance commitments – ultimately costing GE billions 


3 
 
GE reinsured primarily policies from the worst era of the LTC market 
 


4 GE entered into some of the worst, one-sided and unfavorable reinsurance agreements in the industry 


1 
GE traded short-term LTC benefits for earnings, but now unsustainable losses are rolling in that may destroy the 
company  


GE management didn’t know what it was doing  2 


7 
GE failed to adequately reserve for LTC losses, used proceeds that should have gone to its carriers for a share buyback, 
and now lacks the liquidity to fund even its existing under-stated reserves – let alone the required additional reserves 


GE misled investors into thinking everything was fine with LTC – despite having the knowledge that it retained the 
worst within the industry – until it blew up in 2017 with a massive (and insufficient) $15B reserve adjustment

GE’s ERAC Insurance Unit Was Run by Inexperienced Executives  


Source: insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-features/2003/01/13/25420.htm 


January 13, 2003 
Insurance Journal 


“ERC Faces an Uncertain Future” 


“[GE-ERAC] can’t seem to make money, even in a market that’s seeing sharp premium increases” 


“[F]or all the money they have, they haven’t used it wisely … one of the main reasons is a lack of 
experienced reinsurance talent managing it, especially at the top.” 


“[T]here is too much interference from other GE operations” 


“Of the top 17 people listed as having primary responsibility for ERC’s operations …. one waits until 
the sixth person listed … and the seventh person … to find an extensive insurance background”  


GE-ERAC’s CEOs would drop in from GE Lighting, Transportation, Plastics, Real Estate and 
Power without any insurance background and they wouldn’t stay very long 


“[GE-ERAC is] sitting on a bunch of long-tail liabilities; it doesn’t appear to have an experienced 
team of reinsurance professionals running it, and it’s changed focus too many times to have a 
thoroughly reliable base of clients to acquire.”

A $15 Billion Accounting Fraud 


GE’s 2017 LTC Reserve Hit
53 


GE’s Official Story Is False; Reserve Adjustment Should Have Been 
Taken in 2012 and Certainly No Later Than 2015 


2017 
GE Annual Report 


During 2017, in response to elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts 
that was most pronounced for policyholders with higher attained ages, we initiated a comprehensive review 
of premium deficiency assumptions across all insurance products, which included reconstructing our future 
claim cost assumptions for long-term care contracts utilizing trends observed in our emerging experience for 
older claimant ages and later duration policies. Certain of our long-term care policyholders only recently 
started to reach the prime claim paying period and our new claim cost assumptions considered the emerging 
credibility of this claim data. In addition to the adverse impact from the revised future claim cost assumptions 
over a long-term horizon, our premium deficiency assumptions considered mortality, length of time a policy 
will remain in-force and both near-term and longer-term investment return expectations. Future investment 
yields estimated in 2017 were lower than in previous premium deficiency tests, primarily due to the effect of 
near term yields on approximately $15 billion of future expected capital contributions. The test indicated a 
premium deficiency resulting in the unlocking of reserves and resetting of actuarial assumptions to current 
assumptions. This resulted in a $9.5 billion charge to earnings, which included a $0.4 billion impairment of 
deferred acquisition costs, a $0.2 billion impairment of present value of future profits, and an $8.9 billion 
increase in future policy benefit reserves.  


GE’s Claim that “During 2017, in Response to Elevated Claim Experience … [The Company] Initiated a 
Comprehensive Review” Leading to the $15 Billion Reserve Adjustment Is Not True; GE Knew Elevated 
Claims Had Been Occurring Years Earlier
54 


February 27, 2019 
Complaint: 


Touchstone Strategic Trust, et 
al. vs. General Electric Co., et al. 


First Disclosure of Potential LTC Reserve Issues: 
“GE did not begin to disclose its true exposure to LTC until July 21, 2017 when GE’s CFO, Bornstein, announced that GE 
experienced adverse claims in its LTC portfolio and that GE would have to reassess the adequacy of its reserves. In 
January 2018, GE announced that it was increasing LTC reserves by $8.9 billion, almost doubling them, and taking a 
related $6.2 billion charge to earnings. GE further announced that it expected to make additional capital contributions 
of $15 billion over the next seven years to address adverse claims experience.” – p. 4 


Genworth Spin Off: 
“When the Genworth transaction was announced in November 2003, Immelt stated on a conference call that GE was 
retaining only a ‘very stable” block of policies that were ‘pric[ed] diligently’ and provided ‘safe earnings.’ However, 
GE did not make a strategic decision to retain its LTC block. According to a Bloomberg report published in 2018, the 
bankers that structured the spin-off, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, advised GE that it could not divest itself of its 
LTC liabilities in the Genworth transaction because they were too risky. GE never disclosed this fact.” – p. 3 


Additional Evidence GE Delayed Making LTC Reserve Adjustments: 
“On November 30, 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that former GE employees interviewed by the SEC admitted 
that the ‘insurance business failed to internally acknowledge worsening results over the years’ and ‘buried risks that 
ultimately kept the company from booking bigger reserves.’ At least one individual left the Company ‘after growing 
concerned that senior executives in the division were changing numbers and their methodology without providing 
supporting evidence.’” – pp. 4-5 


GE’s Activities to Delay the Reserve Adjustment and Hide Its LTC Problems 
from the Public Are Spelled Out in a Recent Class Action Lawsuit
55 


February 27, 2019 
Complaint: 


Touchstone Strategic Trust, et 
al. vs. General Electric Co., et al. 


Manipulation of LTC Reserves: 
“Plaintiffs in Sjunde AP-Fonden v. General Electric Company, No. 1:17-cv-08457- JMF interviewed a number of former 
GE employees who provided information that confirms the accuracy of the Wall Street Journal’s report. For example, 
they relied on statements from an individual who was employed as a senior actuary at ERAC from 2006 to 2012, a 
senior insurance audit specialist at GE Capital Audit from 2012 to 2014, and a senior vice president at GE Capital Audit 
from 2014 through January 1, 2017. According to the class plaintiffs, in the summer of 2014, this individual discovered 
in the course of an audit of ERAC that key assumptions used in LTC modeling were “stale by several years.” He also 
reported that prior and subsequent audits had identified serious issues with the models that were used by GE to set 
LTC reserves that were elevated in reports required to be provided to Defendants. These issues included use of 
outdated assumptions and the failure to validate models.” – p.34 


Ignoring and Delaying a Loss Recognition Event: 
“The Sjunde AP-Fonden plaintiffs also obtained statements from an individual who worked at GE as an Actuarial 
Controller ERAC from July 2015 to September 2016. This individual indicated that ERAC management changed LTC 
reserve assumptions without justification. According to this individual, during loss recognition testing in the spring of 
2016 his modeling showed that GE Capital had experienced a “loss recognition event” and would need hundreds of 
millions of GAAP additional reserves. When his superiors, Clark Ramsey (“Ramsey”), ERAC’s chief actuary, and William 
Steilen, ERAC’s CFO, learned of this, they modified the way testing was done and took the position that there was 
actually a $78 million surplus. This individual was “very uncomfortable” because management was not supporting 
changes to modeling methodology.” – p.34

With rising claims experience in 2015, GE still does not 
substantially increase its active life reserves.  


2014: GE ignores reserve impact of 
increase in paid claims, despite 
Genworth taking a $1.4B reserve hit in

QUESTION:  Why did GE, which knew it had the worst LTC in the market, wait until 
2017 to make a $15 billion reserve adjustment? 


ANSWER: It allowed GE to divert $20 billion from its 2016 sale of Synchrony for a  
$20+ billion share buyback instead of funding the LTC reserve shortfall. 


2014: GE ignores reserve impact of 
increase in paid claims, despite 
Genworth taking a $1.4B reserve hit in 
2014 with less toxic LTC. 


2015: Reserves decrease despite 
continued increases in paid and 
incurred claims. How is this  
actuarially possible? 


2016: Minimal reserve adjustment 
despite fact that claim experience trend 
has emerged. 


2017: Belatedly, in response to 
elevated claim experience over the 
prior 4 years, GE conducted an LTC 
review that led to an insufficient  
$15 billion reserve adjustment. 


2017: GE had to ask the Kansas DOI 
for permission to pay the $15 billion 
over seven years, because it didn’t 
have enough cash to pay it all at once

66 


Reasons Why GE Has Been Able to Understate LTC Reserves by 
Tens of Billions of Dollars: 


3 
Commonly used publicly available reserve data commingles different types of LTC coverage that have different economics and 
prevents reserve benchmarking of similar LTC – by type (group / individual) and vintage (pre mid 2000’s / post mid 2000’s) 


The LTC industry has been in a continuing state of evolution due to changes in morbidity, mortality, lapse rates, health care costs, 
interest rates and LTC pricing making it difficult to find comparable baseline results for reserve benchmarking 


4 


The industry-wide lack of transparency prevents detailed analysis of a carrier’s LTC reserves or meaningful comparisons of LTC 
reserves across carriers 


1 


Wide variability of LTC reserve levels exist across the industry, due to limited standardization of tables and assumptions,  
so carriers can base key assumptions on subjective interpretations of “company experience”  


2 


The underlying actuarial reserving practices and inter-relationships are highly complex, which further limits the usefulness of the 
minimal publicly available information to analyze a carrier’s LTC reserves  


5 


LTC reserves are estimated to be 50% understated1 industry-wide making it difficult to identify and quantify specific instances of 
under-reserving due to the wide-spread and systemic nature of this problem  


6 


GE fails to provide real transparency into its LTC reserving and largely withholds any information that could raise questions about 
the adequacy of its existing reserve levels, for example not disclosing the results of its LTC business in its “Teach-In” 


7 


GE executives promote false and misleading statements that its LTC exposure is not a risk, that it is priced diligently and that it is 
a stable block of policies or portray bad news (26% of policies not paying premiums) as a positive  


8

67 


The Steps to Identify and Quantify GE’s Current $18.5 Billion in 
LTC Under-Reserving: 


3 
Statutory financial statements provide information for each LTC “Policy Form Type”, including type of LTC coverage, dates sold, 
premiums, incurred claims, in-force policies, in-force lives and reported reserves; additional actuarial reserve data is also available 


That information can be used to develop per in-force life reserve metrics that can benchmark one carrier’s reserves against 
others at the most granular level possible, and, most importantly, enables reserve benchmarking of similar LTC 


4 


There are disparate datasets of LTC information that can be assembled into a mosaic that enables benchmarking of LTC reserve 
levels across different carriers  


1 


Benchmarking GE-ERAC’s LTC reserves, which consist of individual pre mid 2000’s policies, requires the identification of similar 
LTC within carriers that sold a mix of LTC – group and individual and pre mid 2000’s and post mid 2000’s. 


2 


In addition to reserve benchmarking, GE-ERAC’s LTC has so many unique issues and problems, it stands alone in the LTC industry, 
that it requires additional reserve adjustments to address its specific risk factors 


5 


Our analytical approach avoids falling into the trap of trying to apply actuarial based analysis, which is not possible due to lack of 
available information, and instead uses commonly accepted business analytical approaches 


6 


GE-ERAC’s per in-force life reserves can be benchmarked against conservatively reserved carriers’ similar “Policy Form Type” LTC 
(individual, pre-mid-2000’s) to identify and quantify under-reserving  


7 


Reserves can be further adjusted to reflect GE-ERAC’s unique situation by using discounted cash flow analysis and the 
assessment of additional risk premiums 


8
68 


The Reserve Benchmarking Process Involves Gathering Specific Data

• Our reserve analytic metric is based upon the number of in-force lives. That information is only available in 
Form 1. 


• The “Policy Form Type” data, which is the basis for most of our reserve analysis, comes from Form 2. That 
information includes only the number of in-force policies. 


• The Prudential and Unum number of in-force lives and number of in-force policies are the same.

• Form 2 provides various types of information at the most granular level possible, by “Policy Form Type”.  


• The Reported Reserves are one element of active life reserves, which correlates with additional contract 
reserves. This is developed specifically for each “Policy Form Type”.  


• The only missing reserve data from Form 2 is the additional actuarial reserves, which is found on Exhibit 6.

Source for Additional Actuarial Reserves: Exhibit 6 


• Additional actuarial reserves are another element of active life reserves. They capture the financial impact 
of reserve adjustments and are not required to be developed on a “Policy Form Type” basis. 


•  Additional actuarial reserves are added to the reported reserves by “Policy Form Type” based upon the 
proportion of each “Policy Form Type” reported reserves.  


• The Per In-Force Life Reserve metric, used to benchmark reserves, reflects all elements of the active life 
reserves except for the unearned premium reserve, which is immaterial.

LTC Carriers Report Reserves

Policy Form Type Data Unbundles LTC Policies, 
Allowing for Proper Comparison
73 


Unbundling Prudential’s Commingled LTC Reserves Provides An 
Example of How Our Analytical Approach Segments LTC Reserves  


Analysts Utilize Reserve Data That Commingles 
Different LTC Coverage That Is Not Comparable 


(i.e. group, individual, old and new LTC is combined, 
preventing reserve comparisons of similar LTC) 


Policy Form Type Data Unbundles LTC Data, 
Allowing Reserve Benchmarking of Similar LTC 


(GE-ERAC’s LTC is individual pre-mid-2000’s and 
Prudential’s ILTC1 is the reserve benchmark) 


 * - Policy Form Types are after mid 2000’s and have different economics and reserving.

• The “Policy Form Types” most comparable to GE-ERAC's LTC, individual policies originally underwritten prior to the mid 2000’s, are 
Prudential’s ILTC1 and Unum’s ILTC. 


• Group policies (GLTC) and newer LTC policies, originally underwritten after the mid 2000’s, possess different economics and are not 
appropriate benchmarks. 


• We reviewed “Policy Form Type Data” of the Top 30 LTC carriers to identify Prudential and Unum as reserve benchmarking candidates.

A $9.1 Billion Accounting Fraud 


The Baker Hughes Double Count

GE Avoids Taking a $9.1 Billion Loss on Its Baker Hughes Investment 
by Fraudulently Failing to Report Its BHGE Holdings as an Investment  


Depending on the form and timing of our separation, and if BHGE’s stock 
price remains below our current carrying value, we may recognize a 
significant loss in earnings. Based on BHGE's share price at January 31, 
2019 of $23.57 per share, the incremental loss upon deconsolidation by a 
sale of our interest would be approximately $8,400 million. 


Misleading Statement 1: 
BHGE loss should have been 


recognized in 2017/18 


Misleading Statement 3: 
GE should have valued BHGE 
as of 12/31/18, putting the 


loss at $9.1B not $8.4B 


Misleading Statement 2: 
GE should never have 


consolidated BHGE
93 


GE Engaged in Multiple GAAP Violations to Avoid Reporting BHGE as 
an Investment and Improperly Consolidated BHGE in Its Financials 


Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8, Chapter 3: “Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information” 


“Faithful representation means that financial information represents the substance of an economic phenomenon rather 
than merely representing its legal form.” 


GE Faithful Representation SFAC Violation: 
• BHGE, a $22 billion business, is being reported (consolidated) in its own financial statements and being reported again 


when GE consolidates the same results into its financial statements 
• With the double count, GE inflates its financial results, misleading investors 
• Furthermore, GE continued to consolidate BHGE after it announced in 2018 it was exiting the BHGE investment, 


meaning, in substance, it should have treated BHGE shares as nothing more than marketable securities held for resale

“Only one reporting entity, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE … A reporting entity has a 
controlling financial interest in a VIE and must consolidate the VIE if it has both power and benefits.” 


GE Primary Beneficiary GAAP Violation: 
• BHGE makes clear in its 10-K filing that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE, which it cites as its reason for 


consolidating the $22 billion business in its financial statements 
• Consolidation of a VIE is limited to (at most) one entity: the primarily beneficiary, which in this case is BHGE

Requirement with Its Baker Hughes “Double Count” Consolidation

Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts BC3.26: 


Substance over form 


BC3.26 Substance over form is not considered a separate component of faithful representation because it would 
be redundant. Faithful representation means that financial information represents the substance of an economic 
phenomenon rather than merely representing its legal form. Representing a legal form that differs from the 
economic substance of the underlying economic phenomenon could not result in a faithful representation.

GE’s Baker Hughes “Double Count” Consolidation Made Even Less 
Sense After GE Announced It Would Be Exiting the BHGE Investment 


In Substance, the Remaining BHGE Shares Held by GE Are Nothing More than Marketable 
Securities Held for Resale, Which Should Not Be Consolidated But Reported at Fair Value

• our success in executing and completing, including obtaining regulatory approvals 
and satisfying other closing conditions for, announced GE Industrial and GE Capital

David Westin Interview of 


Larry Culp, Bloomberg 
Q: And the stock has reacted pretty well to what you had to say, even though you said you 
may lose some money in terms of cashflow. Do you anticipate a debt review? Are you 
worried about the debt-rating situation because there were some of those ratings that were 
based on some assumptions that don’t seem to be right anymore. 


Read: GE jet leasing unit’s portfolio churn makes JPMorgan wary 


A: It seems like investors understand that the deleveraging plan we have in place both for 
the industrial balance sheet and at GE Capital is well under way. We’ve announced the sale 
of our biopharma business. We’ll see about $20 billion in proceeds there. Our Baker Hughes 
stake -- one that we’ve earmarked for sale -- is worth, call it $12 billion. Wabtec is another 
option we have. So we have about $38 billion of resources to help us bring down the 
leverage on the industrial balance sheet. Similar opportunities and capital as we make GE 
Capital simpler. So we think that we’re on a path to see our deleveraging goals through.

BHGE Annual Report 


As of December 31, 2018, GE held approximately 50.4% of the economic 
interest and the Company held approximately 49.6% of the economic 
interest in BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic interest in 
BHGE LLC, we conduct and exercise full control over all its activities, 
without the approval of any other member. Accordingly, we consolidate 
the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a noncontrolling interest in 
our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic 
interest in BHGE LLC not held by us.

• Note: the $9.1 billion loss 
for the restatement would 
apply to the 12/31/18 
financial statements 


• BHGE’s shares have risen 
since 12/31/18 financial 
statements and GE disclosed 
in its 10-Q that the loss 
would be $7.4 billion as  
of 6/30/19 


• BHGE shares have increased 
from 6/30/19 and the loss as 
of 7/31/19 is estimated to 
be $7.2 billion 


EY Says “Big R” Restatement Required: 


When an error is material to prior period financial statements, a 
company is required to restate previously issued financial statements 
and correct the error (e.g., in a Form 10-K/A filing or, in some cases, the 
next Form 10-K filing). In such situations, the audit opinion also is revised 
to disclose the restatement and refers to the financial statement 
footnote that describes the error and related correction. This type of 
restatement is commonly known as a Big R restatement. 


Because Big R restatements are material corrections to previously issued 
financial statements, investors will want to understand the nature of the 
error and the correction. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Big R 
restatement results from one or more material weaknesses in internal 
control. Thus disclosure of the Big R restatement frequently is 
accompanied by disclosure of a previously undetected material 
weakness in internal control over financial reporting.

Questions for GE on How the $9.1 Billion 2018 Restatement Will 
Impact the Following Areas of GE’s Business:  


Will GE Violate Any Debt / Equity or Other Debt Covenants? If So, What Is the Total Dollar Value 
of the Affected Debt? 


Will GE Violate Any Covenants for the $40.8 Billion of Available Credit Facilities? If So, What is the 
Total Dollar Value of the Affected Available Financing? 


Will GE Still Have Access to the Commercial Paper Market? 


Will GE Continue to Meet the Criteria for Its Current Credit Ratings? 


 Are There Any Other Major Business Arrangements That Would Be Adversely Impacted?

The $9.1 Billion 2018 Restatement Is in Addition to the $2.2 Billion 
Loss GE Took When It Started to Exit Its BHGE’s Investment 


GAAP Violations Have Kept the $9.1 Billion in Losses Off GE’s Financial Statements  


Source: GE 2018 10-K, p. 9 


GE Ignored the Substance of the BHGE Investment and GAAP Rules to Continue to Account for 
It as a Non-Controlling Interest to Avoid $9.1 Billion More in Losses. THIS IS FRAUD. 


Pursuant to our announced plan of an orderly separation from BHGE over time, BHGE 
completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of 
BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65 million BHGE LLC units from 
us. The total consideration received by us from these transactions was $3.7 billion. 
The transaction closed in November 2018 and, as a result, our economic interest in 
BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a pre-tax loss in equity of $2.2 
billion. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

“Beginning in 1995 and continuing through the filing of the Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2004, GE met or 
exceeded final consensus analyst earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations every quarter.” – Complaint at 1 


“Because GE originally reported a fourth quarter 2002 net income figure of $3,102 million, the improper change of 
methodology resulted in GE overstating its fourth quarter 2002 net income by an estimated 5.4%. In addition, the 
estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $200 million that GE avoided by switching CP hedging methodologies would 
have caused GE to miss its quarterly and annual consensus EPS estimates by approximately 1.5 cents.” – Complaint at 16  


"[T]he restatement [of swaps with 'shortcut' designations] had the effect of increasing GE’s 2003 reported net earnings in 
the first and second quarters by 9.6% ($287 million) and 11.9% ($450 million), and decreasing reported net earnings by 
12.2% ($446 million) in the third quarter. – Complaint at 18 


“These [bridge financing] transactions accounted for 131 of the 191 locomotives purportedly sold by GETS in the fourth 
quarter of 2002 (68.6%); $223 million of the $717 million in reported quarterly GETS revenue (31.1%); and $38 million of 
the $134 million in reported GETS operating profit (28.4%). Inclusion of these transactions significantly overstated the 
performance of the GETS business in the fourth quarter of 2002, with GETS revenues and profits being overstated by 45.1%

“For the fourth quarter of 2003, the rail transactions accounted for 92 of the 215 locomotives purportedly sold (42.8%) by 
GETS; $158 million of the $857 million in GETS revenue (18.4%); and $24 million of the $168 million in GETS operating profit 
(14.3%). Inclusion of these transactions significantly overstated the performance of the GETS business in the fourth 
quarter of 2003, with GETS revenues and profits being overstated by 22.6% and 16.7%.” – Complaint at 23 


“GE misled investors by reporting materially false and misleading results in its financial 
statements ... GE has agreed to pay a $50 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges.”  
– August 4, 2009 SEC Litigation Release, "SEC Charges General Electric With Accounting Fraud" 


“First, GE removed sales of spare parts from a model used to account for sales of aircraft engines that resulted in an 
immediate $844 million charge to revenue. Second, to offset that charge and to avoid disclosure of its original accounting, 
GE simultaneously made a second, related change to another accounting model. That second change did not comply with 
GAAP. GE’s error improperly overstated GE’s 2002 net earnings by approximately $585 million.” – Complaint at 24 


"The creation of the $156 million reserve also did not comply with GAAP. Under GAAP, even if it had been proper for GE to 
recognize the approximately $1 billion in increased revenue and earnings, GE should either have (1) recognized the entire 
approximately $1 billion in the first quarter and “trued up” the number in later quarters based on future analysis of the 
CSAs or (2) not recognized any gain on the switch until it had completed its analysis." - Complaint at 30

When CEO Joyce Overstates 3-Year Profit Margin CAGR As 11%, It’s Not a 
Rounding Error; In Fact, It’s Nearly Double the Actual Rate of 5.73%! 


Let’s start with a quick perspective on our 
performance over the last three years. As you 
know, Aviation has been a strong business for GE with 
good leverage, compounded annual growth rate and 
operating profit of 11% on 8% growth in revenue.

Reasons to Doubt GE’s Aircraft Leasing (GECAS) Profits  


GECAS Is a Black Box with “Enronesque” Off-Balance Sheet Borrowings; GE Provides Us With Almost No 
Information Other Than This Unit Has “Great Earnings”; If That’s So Where Is the Accompanying Cash?  


Reason 


#1  


3 


4 


1 


2 


More importantly, for it to have “reported profit margins” in the 24%-41% range, there must be lots of 
“Off Balance-Sheet Borrowings” which calls into question GE’s BBB+ credit rating  


Our conclusion is that the GECAS profit margins, particularly 2017’s 41.2% profit margin, is nowhere close to 
the truth! Why doesn’t GE tell us how this unit earned 41.2% in 2017?  


Why didn’t GE bother to post the profit margins for GECAS? Our guess is because no one would believe the 
percentages that we discovered were real given GECAS is downsizing and has lower YOY revenues 


GECAS, a business unit with $41.7B in assets provides no details on how it earns money, how costs are 
allocated or how Free Cash Flow (assuming it exists) is generated

LOOK OUT! Off-Balance Sheet Entities and Number of Planes Go Down, While Number of 
Engines Goes Up! 


Reason 


#2  


Lastly, turning to the influence from GECS and other factors, investors wonder why there would be a big disconnect 
between EBITDA of $7.5 B and FCF of ~$3 B including allocations, but we have seen a disconnect between EBITDA and FCF 
at GE before (Power), and we don’t know why some assume this business is “ring fenced” from the rest of GE. Most notable 
is the relationship with GECAS and the CFM JV, as off-balance sheet mechanisms to deliver better earnings than cash (with 
the charge likely coming in the interest and other financial charges line). The impact from CFM moving parts is not 
disclosed, and we have little information about this important JV. 


Additionally, we note that, starting in 2013 (same time 
the FCF disconnect started for Power), engines owned 
by GECAS were growing by 10%+, while aircraft owned 
went down until 4Q15, at which time the disclosure 
was no longer provided. With a fraction of the 
disclosure from pure play leasing companies, and the 
historical backdrop, it’s reasonable to ask more 
questions around this relationship, especially when 
both are referred to as “crown jewels”.

GE-ERAC receives virtually no current net premiums from Allianz for assuming net

This is what one of the most one-sided LTC reinsurance arrangements looks like: 
Allianz kept its best LTC and off-loaded its worst LTC to GE-ERAC and Munich American Re;  
GE-ERAC then got the worst deal of the two reinsurers and is assuming 90% of the losses.

GE-ERAC’s Deal With Mass Mutual May Become the Worst Ever 


This could soon become the worst reinsurance arrangement EVER in LTC industry!!! 
Mass Mutual kept LTC with over $100 million in increasing premiums with virtually no losses 


 and ceded to GE-ERAC LTC with almost all of the losses and declining premiums; 
The insured are much younger so this will get far worse as they enter prime claim paying ages..

AUL functions as a pass-through entity, assuming and ceding this LTC, which comes from the American Long

 The ALTCGR is the “Black Box” of the LTC Industry, and pools tens of billions of dollars of LTC exposure, but 
is very secretive and files no financial Information with regulators; What LTC loss exposure is GE-ERAC

Long Term Care: Overview of the Industry 


Appendix II
159 


History of the LTC Market 


Originally offered by a small number of carriers in the late 70’s and early 80’s for nursing home expenses 1 


Experienced rapid growth in the 80’s and 90’s as more carriers entered the market and product offerings 
expanded to include assisted living and home care 


2 


The largest factor cited for entering the LTC market was sales; profitability was secondary 3 


The policies have level premiums that build investments in the early years that can be liquidated decades later 
to fund the claims 


4 


The industry subsequently addressed many of these problems by introducing benefit caps, changing the 
accessibility of benefits and repricing coverage 


5 


While that improved LTC economics going forward, the legacy of toxic LTC and its related under-reserving still 
exists within the industry 


6

160 


History of the LTC Market (cont’d) 


Source: Society of Actuaries, 2014 Overview of the U.S. LTC Insurance Market 


A PwC presentation to Society of Actuaries estimated that – industry-wide – the LTC was under-reserved by 
50%; the majority of the reserve issues related to pre-2003 policies 


7 


Most of pre-2003 policies were underwritten before the NAIC created the Long-Term Care Insurance Model 
Regulation in 2000, which is known as the “rate stability law”, in order to protect consumers 


8 


Prior to the implementation of the rate stability law, actuaries did not have to verify that premiums were 
reasonably expected to be sustainable with no future premium increases. 


9 


During this period, carriers could set unsustainably low premiums to generate revenue for years – decades – 
and then increase premiums as policyholders approached claim paying ages. 


10 


Policyholders from this period are approaching prime claim paying ages and it is becoming increasingly 
difficult for carriers to ignore the industry-wide under-reserving.
