Summary: (NASDAQ:HFFG)
HF Foods Group (“HF”) is the third SPAC merger orchestrated by Atlantic Acquisition, the
sponsor of 2 other infamous public company debacles. First, Wins Finance, whose shares
rocketed on allegedly manipulating its FTSE/Russell index qualification criteria, then
plunged once ejected from the indices. Second, iFresh, which is down ~95% since its
merger amidst a slew of related-party transactions that have sucked shareholder cash out of
the business. We think HF Foods is a combination of the worst parts of both Wins and
iFresh.
HF’s massive $509 million merger with food distributor B&R appears to be a blatant
undisclosed related-party transaction. The company claimed that the deal was negotiated at
“arm’s length”, but we found multiple documents showing that both HF and B&R were part of
the same Chinese investment group for years prior to the acquisition.
HF has transacted with at least 43 separate related-party entities in 2019 alone. Several are
based out of the company’s own headquarters and appear to have no operations. We
visited others across the country and found red flags suggesting that these related parties
are being used by insiders to extract cash from the business.
We discovered that the company’s trucking subsidiary, ostensibly set up to transport food
products, appears to have also used shareholder cash to purchase an undisclosed fleet of
exotic supercars including Ferraris, Porsches, and a Bentley. We found photos of the
Chairman’s teenage son bragging on Instagram about them being his vehicles.


HF Foods: 90%+ Downside on
Massive Undisclosed Related-Party
Transactions, Shareholder Cash Spent
on Exotic Supercars & Outrageous
Fundamental Valuation


Published on March 23, 2020
HF also directed over $2 million of shareholder cash to business entities owned by the
Chairman’s teenage son, including one that bought another fleet of 7 Ferraris with vanity
plates such as “FUCKAH0E”, “RUSINGLE”, “IPULL”, “DIKTAT0R”, and “IMHUMBLE”. (And
yes, we have photos.)
We think HF’s auditor has been asleep at the wheel. It was recently subpoenaed by the SEC
for its work on iFresh (another Atlantic Acquisition SPAC mentioned above), and was
lambasted in its recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection
report for a multitude of audit failures.
The B&R merger more than doubled HF’s share count. However, FTSE/Russell mistakenly
included almost all of these shares as part of the company’s free float, which sent HFFG’s
price and volume soaring on Friday’s index rebalancing. We think this mistake may be
reversed.
We believe HF and its insiders are masking the true number of shares held by its affiliates.
Once made clear to FTSE/Russell, we expect the recent forced index buying in HF will
reverse and become forced selling.
We see 90%+ downside for HF’s shares based on outrageously priced fundamentals,
insider deals that appear to be hollowing out the company, and potential forced selling by
FTSE/Russell.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of HFFG.
This report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence.
Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.


Basics on the Company


On Friday, a relatively unfollowed company called HF Foods Group Inc (NASDAQ:HFFG) (“HF” or
“HF Foods”) surged almost 40% mid-day on no news. The stock traded over 1.8 million shares of
volume on the day, more than 30 times its 60-day average volume. Investors who track the
company might have wondered: “What on earth was that?”


We have been working on this report for months and had predicted that Friday would be the
specific day when HFFG’s shares would surge. In fact, we specifically waited until after Friday’s
surge before releasing our report. In our report, we provide a thorough explanation for this
movement and why we believe it could help contribute to shares plunging well below recent
levels.


HF Foods is one of the largest food distributors to Chinese restaurants in the United States. The
company supplies over 10,000 Asian restaurants across 21 states, and has two segments: (1)
sales to independent restaurants and (2) sales to wholesalers. [Pg. 3]


The company was founded in 1997 by a husband and wife team, Zhou Min Ni (who is
currently Chairman/Co-CEO) and his wife, Chan Sin Wong (who formerly served as President and
Director).

HF Foods went public via SPAC on August 23, 2018. The stock has since been volatile,
particularly around Russell index rebalancing periods (more on this later).


In November 2019, HF Foods merged with B&R Global Holdings, a large West Coast-based
Chinese food distributor, in a $509 million two-part deal. The acquisition provided HF Foods more
scale, taking its annual revenue from over $300 million in 2019 [Pg. 30] to a combined $828
million. At present, the company discloses ownership of 14 distribution centers located across the
East and West Coasts and a fleet of over 340 refrigerated vehicles. [Pg. 3]


Introduction: Dozens of Related-Party Transactions,
Failure to Disclose Its $509 Million Mega-Merger was a
Related-Party Deal, an Undisclosed Fleet of Supercars
and Major Red Flags Around Its SPAC Sponsor and
Auditor


Our research on HF, spanning several months, leads us to believe that the company’s insiders are
looting the place. We found that the massive $509 million merger with B&R appears to be an
undisclosed related-party transaction. Additionally, our report raises red flags relating to
transactions with more than 40 additional related-party entities, the company’s apparent use of
shareholder cash to purchase a fleet of exotic supercars, the track record of the company’s SPAC
sponsor, and regulatory questions about the company’s auditor, who was recently subpoenaed by
the SEC and lambasted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).


Background: HFFG Has 60%-80% Fundamental
Downside Before We Even Examine Its Most Alarming
Issues


HF currently trades at a market cap of roughly $642 million[1] and a total enterprise value of $765
million.[2]


The company’s revenue growth appears to be stagnating while recent profitability has declined
precipitously. Its 2019 pro-forma combined revenue was $828 million, representing year-over-year
growth of only 1.2% relative to its 2018 pro-forma revenue of $818 million [Pg. 34]. This includes
its recent acquisition of B&R. Over the same period, pro-forma net income plunged 64%, declining
to $5.6 million in 2019 from $15.7 million in 2018. [Pg. 34]

We expect net income to further decline given (a) plunging margins, which we explain further
below and (b) the slowdown caused by COVID-19, which has hurt all restaurants, but has
disproportionately affected Chinese and Asian restaurants. [1,2,3]


We compared the company to Sysco, United Natural Foods and Core-Mark, three of its closest
peers, and found that HF is egregiously overvalued relative to its peer group across key metrics:


(Source: Capital IQ)


When comparing HF’s key financial metrics to peers we see fundamental downside alone of
between 58% and 80%.

When we combine our fundamental analysis with what we believe to be other red flags outlined
below, we see 90%+ downside from these levels and believe the company to be completely
uninvestable.


The Sponsor of HF Foods’ Go-Public Transaction
Sponsored Two Other Public Company Debacles That
Crumbled After, Respectively, (a) Undertaking
Numerous Related-Party Transactions, and (b)
Allegedly Gaming its FTSE/Russell Index Inclusion
Criteria.


We Think HF is Following a Similar Playbook, Which Will Result in The Same Outcome


We think HF Foods is (a) being hollowed out through related-party transactions designed to enrich
insiders while (b) gaming its FTSE/Russell index inclusion criteria to drive irregular passive index
buying into its stock. These practices are very similar to what ultimately devastated shares of
Wins Finance and iFresh, the two above-mentioned companies also sponsored by the backers of
HF Foods’ SPAC merger.


The HF Foods go-public SPAC deal was sponsored by Atlantic Acquisition Management, whose
two prior SPAC transactions resulted in infamous drubbings for shareholders:


1. Wins Finance Holdings (NASDAQ:WINS). This China-based lending services company
reverse-merged with an Atlantic Acquisition SPAC in October 2015, subsequently soaring over
4,500% to a market cap of $9 billion in a move largely driven by passive index buying from

https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/this-chinese-stock-soared-4-500-on-nasdaq-and-no-one-knows-why
the FTSE/Russell indices.


At the time, multiple reporters (1,2,3,4,5) noted the irregular trading, including this example:


Wins fraudulently claimed to own a U.S. office in order to qualify for FTSE/Russell index inclusion,
according to a lawsuit filed in 2017 (Wins settled the complaint in 2018). The stock spiked on the
inclusion, but FTSE/Russell ultimately removed WINS from its indices. Its shares were halted for 6
months and then crashed spectacularly.


The company is currently late to file its annual report due to an $83 million dollar loan issued to an
opaque Chinese entity that the company is no longer certain it can collect.


2. iFresh Holdings (NASDAQ:IFMK). This Asian/Chinese food distribution and grocery company
was laden with related-party transactions, including acquisitions [Pg. 12], since its go-public SPAC
transaction in February 2017. [Pg. 109] At present, in addition to defaulting on its credit
agreement [Pg. 44] and having been subject to an IRS tax lien [Pg. 43], the company’s balance
sheet remains significantly indebted to related parties. [Pg. 1]


The company is currently fighting a NASDAQ delisting. As of just weeks ago,
iFresh announced that both it and its auditor, Friedman LLC, are being subpoenaed by the
SEC. Friedman LLC is also the auditor for HF Foods. iFresh has traded down ~95% since

HF Foods’ Massive $509 Million Merger with B&R
Appears To Be Just One of Dozens of Suspicious
Related-Party Transactions


Our review of HF Foods uncovered a staggering number of related-party transactions, both
disclosed and undisclosed, that we believe are suspicious.


These transactions include HF’s $509 million merger with B&R, which we believe is a clear and
massive undisclosed related-party transaction. We also found other undisclosed dealings,
including a loan to an undisclosed related entity and a fleet of Ferraris and exotic luxury supercars
owned by an HF Foods subsidiary.


In addition to undisclosed related-party transactions, the company has also conducted dozens of
irregular disclosed related-party transactions.


In total, the company transacted with 43 related-party entities in 2019 alone. [Pg 104–105, Pg.
109] In 2019, HF Foods reported over $40 million in purchases and $19.3 million in sales to
related-party entities. [Pg. 67]


Our investigation uncovers related entities with (a) minimal or no online presence, (b) no signage
or apparent operations at their respective registered addresses and (c) entities held out as
separate companies to investors that appear to actually be operating as part of HF.

We believe insiders are using these dozens of related-party transactions to suck cash out of the
business, eventually leaving shareholders with a hollow, debt-laden company.


Undisclosed Related-Party Transactions: HF Group Had
Clear Ties to B&R Before Consummating its $509
Million “Arm’s-Length” Deal, Yet None of It Was
Disclosed to Shareholders


In June 2019, HF Foods announced it would be merging with B&R Global Holdings, a West Coast
food distribution company. The merger was a 2-part transaction valued at a massive $509 million.
It included HF Foods issuing 30.7 million shares to former B&R shareholders, more than doubling
the company’s outstanding share count and adding ~$101 million in debt to the balance sheet.


According to deal documents, the acquisition process started when HF’s CEO phoned B&R’s
CEO in October 2018. [Pg. 27] The deal documents describe the transaction as being negotiated
“at arm’s-length”. [Pg. 60]


Contrary to those representations, we found longstanding formal ties between HF Foods and
B&R:


HF and B&R were both under the umbrella of the same investment group, the American
International Rongjin Investment Group,[3] according to an announcement by the Chinese
Ministry of Commerce in 2012.[4]
In 2012, an affiliate of the above-named entity also affirmed that HF and B&R are part of the
same investment holding group.
A May 2018 interview with the President of Fujian Rongjin Group (福建榕金集团有限公司),
Zhang Yi Tuan (张贻团) also affirmed the relationship. According to the interview, the
American International Rongjin Investment Group’s distribution business operates in the
U.S. and includes both HF and B&R. According to the interview, the group uses B&R as its
official American headquarters and works with HF Foods and others to jointly distribute food
in the U.S.


Instead of being “at arm’s length”, these entities look to have been closely affiliated through the
same investment group for at least 8 years, which we believe clearly makes them related-parties.


These intricate pre-existing connections represent a major conflict of interest, yet none of this was
disclosed to investors prior to, or after, the merger.

Undisclosed Insider Enrichment: An HF Subsidiary
Owns a Fleet of Ferraris and Exotic Luxury Supercars,
Paid for By Shareholders.


The CEO’s Son Bragged About Them Being His Cars on
Instagram


In another series of highly irregular transactions, we examined the assets of Truse Trucking,
a company subsidiary:


We performed a background check on Truse, which detailed its vehicle assets. As expected,
Truse owns numerous refrigeration trucks that we presume are used to deliver raw and
refrigerated food products to the company’s customers. [Example 1, Example 2]


In addition to the fleet of trucks, however, our background check showed that Truse owns an
undisclosed fleet of exotic luxury supercars, including Ferraris, a Bentley, a Porsche, and other
high-end vehicles with vanity plates such as “RIDEIT69”, “MAKNBBYZ”, “UPGIRL” and
“H0P0NIT”.


These, we presume, are not used to deliver raw and refrigerated food products to the company’s
customers.


For example, a 2013 Bentley Continental, with an MSRP of $193,000, the license plate “99Pr0BZ”
and previous license plate “BENTOVER”, is titled and registered to Truse.

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/8fMlml7ixho6xI
We could think of no business justification for just about any public company purchasing Ferraris
or Bentleys with shareholder money. The HF Chairman/CEO’s son puts these vehicles to
apparent personal use, bragging openly about his “stable” of cars on his public Instagram account
(we expect he’ll soon discover privacy settings). Here he showcases the “BENTOVER” Bentley,
captioned with a #fuckahoe hashtag:

A Ferrari, with an MSRP of $319,995 and the license plate “WANTMY” is also registered to
Truse Trucking, according to our background check.


We matched this Ferrari and the “WANTMY” license plate to the Chairman/CEO’s son’s Instagram
account:


In total, we found 8 luxury supercars valued at a ~$1.5 million MSRP registered to and owned by
Truse Trucking:


Nowhere do we see any of these cars disclosed as compensation. The Chairman/CEO’s
executive salary supposedly consisted of $400,000 in cash [Pg. 98]:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680873/000143774919019423/fooh20190927_defm14a.htm
We find these high-end exotic vehicles to be an outrageous use of shareholder capital, especially
given the severe deterioration of the company’s profitability.


HF’s Disclosed Related-Party Transactions: Doing
Business with At Least 43 Different Related-Party
Entities


We also think HF’s insiders are drawing cash from the business through its disclosed related-party
transactions.


HF reported transacting with a staggering 43 different related-party entities in 2019 alone,
including over $40 million in purchases and $19.3 million in sales from and to the entities [Pg. 67]
[Pg. 104, Pg. 109]. Many are owned all, or in part, by the Chairman/CEO and his immediate
family, as shown from the table below that lists 20 of these entities:

Major Discrepancy: Customers Are Told Some of These
Entities Are Part of HF Foods, Yet Shareholders are
Told The Entities Are Separate (Which Allows Insiders
to Extract Cash)



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680873/000143774919019423/fooh20190927_defm14a.htm
When HF Foods went public, its merger documents [Pg 8] and investor presentation [Pg. 20]
claimed that the company owned and operated three distribution centers. It also advertised an
“expansion plan” to extend its business beyond the American Southeast:


(Source: Atlantic Acquisition Management. Investor Presentation, Pg. 20)


However, well before HF Foods went public, its customer-facing subsidiary “Han Feng Inc.”
already claimed to operate 20 distribution centers (see below):

This same website’s Chinese-language portal has a more detailed map, showing that HF Foods
had already been operating distribution centers where the company told investors it
planned to expand:


Source: Han Feng China Web Capture (2016)


Many of the distribution centers on the Chinese-language website match the names of entities HF
now claims are separate entities that insiders own equity stakes in (Fortune One Foods, N&F
Logistic, Allstate Trading).


So, which is it? As we detail later, our on-site investigations of several entities showed signs that
they operate as part of Han Feng. In some cases, employees on-site confirmed it for us (which we
have recorded).


We believe insiders have retained this network of entities, which were not consolidated into HF
Foods, in order to extract cash from HF and its shareholders.


HF’s Disclosed Related-Party Transactions: Wholesale
Margins to These Entities Collapsed
Immediately After the IPO. Cash Seems to Be Slipping
Out the Back Door



https://web.archive.org/web/20161018041240/http:/www.hanfengchina.com/col.jsp?id=114

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680873/000143774919019423/fooh20190927_defm14a.htm
HF reported a ~33% collapse in its wholesale gross margins in the quarter after it went public, by
related-parties that presumably benefitted from the margin compression.


Source (SPAC / HFFG merger, 2018 10-K and 2019 Q3 10-Q)


The company acknowledges that the margin decline was due to related-party sales, but tried to
explain it away by citing volume discounts:


“The decrease in margins resulted form (sic) increased sales to related
parties relative to total wholesale revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017. The
wholesale price for related parties is generally lower than third party customers due
to the larger quantities purchased by related parties.” [Pg. 30]


This explanation is puzzling. Sales only grew ~3% year over year for the comparable 2019/2018
9-month period, so there was no surge in volume. Furthermore, the company disclosed that
related parties constituted 92% of wholesale segment sales in 2017 [Pg. 30], making it impossible
for related business to have meaningfully increased. [Pg. 32]


Our investigation of these related-party entities uncovers a different explanation for why the
company’s sudden wholesale margins have collapsed: insiders appear to be looting the place.


We investigated several of these entities in detail, including on-the-ground field research on both
the East and West Coast. All told, we believe these related-party transactions are largely shams
designed to extract cash from the business.

$4 Million Of Shareholder Cash Was Used for Purchases
and Advances to Revolution Industry, An Entity Based
Out of HF Foods’ Headquarters, Owned 100% By The
Chairman/CEO’s Son, That Was Formed 1 Month Prior
to the IPO Deal, With No Visible Signs of an Actual
Business


HF Foods discloses transacting ~$3.3 million in purchases from, and directing over $700
thousand in advances to Revolution Industry. [Pg. 106,  Pg. 21] Revolution Industry is 100%
owned by the Chairman/CEO’s son and claims to do business in “food processing” and
“distribution” according to its  North Carolina corporate filings.


We find it suspicious that HF Foods directed ~$4 million in business to the Chairman’s son,
who was likely a senior in high school at the time, according to social media posts.


Note that HF’s SPAC sponsor announced the deal to take HF public in March 2018. Revolution
Industry was formed just one month earlier, according to North Carolina corporate records.


We found no signs that Revolution Industry is an actual business—no website, no social media
profile, and no evidence of it having customers.


Even more suspicious, North Carolina corporate records show that the entity is registered to
the same address as HF Foods’ headquarters: 6001 West Market Street, Greensboro North
Carolina:

As shown below, this entity’s address matches the address of HF Foods’ headquarters:


What kind of food could HF be distributing to an entity based out of its own address? We think the
only thing being distributed is money to insiders.

$483,000 in Loans to Revolution Automotive, Another
Related-Party Entity Owned 100% by the
Chairman/CEO’s Son to Buy Yet More Ferraris


License Plates of the Vehicles, Apparently Paid for With
Shareholder Cash: “FUCKAH0E”, “69PRBLMZ”,
“RUSINGLE”, “IPULL”, “DIKTAT0R”, “IMHUMBLE”


HF Foods also extended $483,000 in loans to the similarly named “Revolution Automotive” (not to
be confused with the above-mentioned “Revolution Industries”). These loans were distributed
around the time of the March 2018 take-public deal announcement. [Pg. 107]


Revolution Automotive is also 100% owned by the Chairman/CEO’s son, according to HF Foods’
filings [Pg. 65], and is also registered to the address of HF Foods’ headquarters, according to
the North Carolina Secretary of State. Once again, we couldn’t find any business operations by
“Revolution Automotive”.


The only discernible assets held by Revolution Automotive are titles to 9 Ferraris, according to our
background check:

The Chairman’s son boasts about this armada of Ferraris, each apparently purchased with
investor cash, on his Instagram:


Source: Instagram 


While the tags appeared on our title / registration background check, some have likely been
revoked due to North Carolina DMV’s poor taste rules. We noticed that several of these sports
cars seemed to cycle through different distasteful license plate names every couple of years.


As to the loan balance owed to shareholders, the Chairman/CEO recently paid it off personally
with shares of illiquid HF stock. [8-K, Pg. i]. This, in our view, allowed him to draw cash out of the
business in exchange for nearly worthless paper.


Over $1 Million Of Shareholder Cash Has Gone to UGO
USA Inc., Another Related-Party Entity Registered to
HF Foods’ Headquarters with Few Signs of Operations


HF Foods has made almost $1 million of purchases over the past 2 years from UGO USA, Inc,
another related-party entity based out of HF’s headquarters. According to company filings, HF’s
Chairman/CEO owns a 30% equity interest in UGO. [Pg. 105] Jin Yan Ni, who we believe may be
a relative to the Chairman (based on matching surnames), set up and manages this entity
according to North Carolina corporate records.

https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/business_registration/annual_report/10215480
UGO claims to be in the “wholesale” business. We see the address once again matches HF
Foods’ headquarters:


We found little evidence that UGO is an actual operating business, though it appears it had taken
steps to become one in the past. In 2016, the entity filed a trademark application for “on-line retail
store services featuring Asian snacks, Asian beauty products, Asian health supplements, Asian
home appliances, and Asian restaurant supplies.” We were unable to locate any online store or
online presence.


We also found that the company imported a total of 3,000 pounds of coconut chips in two
shipments between 2016 and 2017, according to ImportGenius. These records show that the 2
shipments were imported from Thailand and directed to 99 New Hook Road in Bayonne, New
Jersey, which happens to be the address of another HF Food related-party called Eastern Fresh
[Pg. 107] (which we detail further below):

picked up.


$11.6+ Million of Shareholder Cash Went to Eastern
Fresh, An Entity HF Foods Claims is a Separate
Business. Signage at the Facility Has HF’s Logo,
Indicating Otherwise


Since 2017, HF has directed $11.6 million into Eastern Fresh LLC, a company that HF’s
Chairman/CEO owns a 30% equity interest in. [Pg. 104] Eastern Fresh appears to be registered
as “Eastern Fresh NJ LLC”, a distributor based in New Jersey.


Despite HF filings claiming that Eastern Fresh is not a subsidiary (but rather a separate related-
party), its signage appears to bear the logo of HF’s customer-facing subsidiary, Han Feng, Inc.
[Pg. 16]


Here is Han Feng’s logo from its website:

And here is Eastern Fresh’s sign, clearly showing the Han Feng logo:

Here is a closer look. It even says “Han Feng” underneath the logo:

Similarly, Eastern Fresh identifies with Han Feng inside its facilities, according to photos found on
its Facebook page:

Again, HF appears to be presenting a unified face to customers, while separating these entities
from investors. This is consistent with what we would expect if these entities are being used to
funnel out shareholder cash.


$1.8 Million in Shareholder Cash Went to Related-Party
Fortune One Foods. Once Again, HF Foods’ Filings
Describe it as a Separate Entity. But Fortune One
Describes Itself as Being a Part of HF Foods


HF’s Chairman/CEO indirectly owns a 17.5% equity interest in Fortune One Foods Inc. [Pg. 104]
HF has made about $1.8 million in purchases from the entity, according to company filings. [Pg.
104] Although filings claim that Fortune One is not an HF subsidiary, but instead a separate
related-party entity, Fortune One appears to brand itself as if it were part of HF.


We were unable to find any website for this entity. Fortune One does have a Facebook page,
however, which describes it as a distributor under Han Feng (i.e., HF), and points to the HF
website:

corporate records.

During our March visit, we observed a fleet of vehicles that appear to be used for delivering food,
a loading bay and a warehouse – all things we would expect from a distribution business.


There was no signage indicating “Fortune One” on the inside or the outside of the facility, as far as
we could tell (the neighboring business was called “Jake’s”):
(Source: Hindenburg Research onsite visit)


(Source: Hindenburg Research onsite visit)


However, several trucks did bear a Fortune One logo:
(Source: Hindenburg Research onsite visit)


We sent an email to Fortune One in March to inquire as to whether it transacts with any
customers other than HF Foods and why it cites HF Foods’ website as its own. We have not
received a response as of this writing.


We also called the number listed on its Facebook page and asked a representative point blank if it
was an independent business or if it was part of Han Feng. His reply (which we have recorded)
was: “Yeah we are a part of Han Feng.” He also confirmed to us that Fortune One has its own
fleet of trucks.


All told, we find it alarming that Fortune One describes itself as being a part of HF Foods, whereas
HF Foods does not include it as a subsidiary. Instead, it reports it as a separate related-party
entity, allowing insiders to personally profit from transactions with it.


NC Noodle, A Related-Party Owned By HF’s Previous
CFO, Made ~$4.2 Million In Sales To HF, But Our On-
The-Ground Research Showed Its Premises To Be
Largely Vacant


HF states that the company’s recently departed CFO owns a 66% equity interest in NC Noodle.
[Pg. 105] Based on HF’s disclosures, we estimate that NC Noodle sold ~$4.2 million to HF in
2019 alone, yet we found no customer-facing business presence online.


We paid a visit to the company’s principal business address during normal working hours to try
and speak with management and get an understanding of the business. Given the volume of
product sold to HF during the year, we expected a sprawling operation.

Instead, we discovered what our investigator described as a “completely vacant” building except
for 3 employees handling a pallet of product in an otherwise empty-looking back warehouse (see
below):

Our investigator asked the employees about the business but was unable to learn anything due to
a language barrier, so he left.


NC Noodle is headquartered less than 10 miles away from HF Foods’ warehouse in North
Carolina.

We suspect this is little more than an insider-owned entity that sells product to nearby HF. We
have serious doubts about whether this “middle man” provides value to anyone but HF insiders.


HF’s Chairman Has Effectively Sold Almost 10% Of His
Shares by Purchasing ~$12 Million in Loans Made by HF
And Paying Them Back With His Own Illiquid Stock


In another series of incestuous and alarming related-party transactions, HF’s Chairman/CEO
bought cash loans issued by HF to related and non-related parties and paid these loans back
using shares of his illiquid HF stock.


The Chairman/CEO’s transactions include purchasing loans originated by HF Foods to his son’s
“business”, Revolution Automotive, along with other related parties.
According to company filings, on September 30, 2019, the Chairman/CEO delivered 1,203,803
shares to the company to purchase ~$12 million in loans issued by HF (8-K) to the 4 different
entities listed below:


According to the 8-K:


“Under the terms of the Loan Sale Agreement, Mr. Ni has acquired the Related-
Party Loans without warranty or recourse and has assumed all risks of non-
collection”


We think this shuffling of assets is nothing more than a way for the company’s Chairman/CEO to
unload his otherwise illiquid and overvalued stock, while extracting cash from the company
through related-party loans.


HF’s Auditor, Recently Subpoenaed By The SEC, Has a
History Of Reportedly Failing To Obtain Sufficient
Evidence To Support its Audit Opinions


We are not surprised that HF’s auditor, Friedman LLC, has not uncovered the many issues
outlined in this report.



https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-19-019696/fooh20191003_8k.htm

https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-19-019696/fooh20191003_8k.htm
As noted earlier, iFresh, another company backed by HF’s SPAC sponsor, is also audited by
Friedman. Similar to HF, iFresh has a history of numerous related-party transactions dating back
to its own go-public transaction. On March 6  2020, iFresh announced that it, along with its
auditor, had received a subpoena from the SEC relating to its work on the company:


In addition to current regulatory issues, Friedman’s recent inspection by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) found material issues. The PCAOB 2018 inspection report
suggested that Friedman had failed to perform its basic function as an auditor: providing
reasonable judgment as to whether financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether by error or fraud. The PCAOB report is scathing:


“Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the
inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial
statements were presented fairly…”


“In other words, in these audits, the auditor issued an opinion without
satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements were free of material misstatement and/or
the issuer maintained effective ICFR.”


The PCAOB report further identified weaknesses with Friedman’s audits of 3 unnamed issuers,
including (a) failures to test the controls and valuation of revenue, (b) failure to test controls over
inventories and (c) “the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test the existence of
investments”.


What Happened with Friday’s FTSE/Russell Forced
Index Buying And Why We Think It Will Prompt
Subsequent Forced Selling of HFFG Shares

https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Documents/104-2019-115-Friedman-LLP.pdf
As noted earlier, the sponsor of HF’s SPAC transaction, Atlantic Acquisition, has a history of
sending socks soaring due to the alleged manipulation of company inclusion criteria for the
FTSE/Russell indices. The 4,500% spike in Atlantic-backed Wins Finance still serves as the
classic example of a passive index forced-buying bonanza (followed by a passive index forced-
selling bonanza), a process that played out several times over the history of Wins:


Similar to Wins, we have seen irregular spikes and troughs in HF’s shares precisely around
rebalance dates.


Beyond HF’s mid-day ~40% spike on massive index buying volume last Friday, a similar scenario
unfolded in June 2019 around the FTSE/Russell index reconstitution. The week leading up to the
rebalance coincided with a price spike of ~65%, followed by a ~48% crash the following week, all
despite an apparent absence of news. As seen below, the company has had regular price and
volume spikes around these reconstitutions.



https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice/?id=2592146

https://hffoodsgroup.com/investor-relations/press-releases/
For context, when index funds buy stocks, they weight the purchases according to a company’s
free float (essentially the number of shares freely traded). In other words, the more freely traded
shares, the more shares the passive indices will buy.


So what happened during Friday’s index rebalancing that led to a surge in HFFG’s price
and volume?


FTSE/Russell had calculated HFFG’s free float to be 21.8 million shares (per its subscription-only
service). This calculation was just flat out wrong. The freely tradable shares were 6.2
million per HF’s own recent March filing. [Pg. 25]


The source of the mistake appears to have been the accidental addition of shares from the B&R
transaction, which closed in November. As with every such merger, shares issued to the
acquirees are restricted for at least 6 months, according to SEC Rule 144. FTSE/Russell
apparently missed this and added the shares to its free float calculation anyway. We think
FTSE/Russell should reverse this decision, which would lead to a forced selling of the shares
purchased.


Beyond the above, which appears to largely be a FTSE/Russell error, sometimes companies are
able to juke the index rebalancing process to ensure that the actual free float is tighter than it
appears. We think this may also be taking place.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680873/000143774920005276/fooh20191231_10k.htm

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/04/1940779/0/en/HF-Foods-Completes-Merger-with-B-R-Global-Holdings.html

https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsrule144htm.html

https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Free_Float_Restrictions.pdf
For example, as shown earlier, to the extent that shares are held by family members or affiliates
(potentially through dozens of related-party entities), this can serve to constrain the true free float.
Given the sheer consistency of the index rebalancing irregularities around HF (and Wins, backed
by the same sponsor), we believe this to be likely. To the extent Russell takes action, forced sales
by passive investors could add severe selling pressure to HF’s shares.


Conclusion: We Believe HFFG’s Shares Have 90%+
Downside


In Latin, res ipsa loquitur means, “the matter speaks for itself”.


We think the evidence compiled regarding HF’s troubling related-party transactions, its flagrant
misuse of shareholder cash, its potential gaming of the FTSE/Russell index criteria and the track
record of its auditor and SPAC sponsor speaks for itself.


Besides the troubling issues presented by our report, we believe HFFG faces 58% to 80%
downside based on fundamentals alone.


Given the totality of our findings – and what the resultant investor, analyst, and regulatory
responses to these findings could be– we believe HFFG faces 90%+ downside and is
ultimately uninvestable.


Disclosure: We are short shares of HFFG
