Ernest Cheung’s multiple officerships and
directorships in various companies


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


Today asensio.com issued a report titled “SinoTech Energy Limited’s


(NASDAQ: CTE $2.80) questionable dealings with Premium Sino-


Finance and Ernest Cheung.” The report details a series of irregular


transactions surrounding the formation of SinoTech and its


November 2010 initial public offering. The report shows that the


disclosures pertaining to Mr. Cheung’s dealings with CTE’s original


owners and CTE’s current Chairman Qingzeng Liu are irregular. To


read that report, click here.


As we illustrated in our report, Analysis of TNH 2007 and 2009


acquisitions and subsequent financings, Ernest Cheung was


purportedly paid substantial sums of “additional considerations”


based on “certain oral agreements.”


According to Bloomberg Businessweek Executive profiles, Ernest


Cheung has participated as an officer or as a director of at least 20


companies since the early 1990s. From 1975 to 1993, he held


Research Analyst positions with several Toronto based brokerage


houses. He left the brokerage industry in 1993 to concentrate on


funding Chinese projects via North American markets.


Mr. Cheung has held the President title in eight companies, Chief


Financial Officer in four, and Director in eight. Click here to see a


list of the companies. The lists of companies include defunct public


penny stocks and others with irregular securities related


transactions. Below is a description of Asia Global Holdings Corp.


(“AAGH”) and Global Peopleline Telecom Inc. (“GPPL”), both for


which Mr. Cheung was the Chief Financial Officer.


AAGH was the subject of a FINRA Disciplinary Proceeding in March


2011. FINRA claimed that the broker-dealer AIS Financial, Inc.,


allowed suspicious activity in the AAGH stock by breaking the

broker-dealer’s anti-money laundering program. FINRA stated that


customers who traded AAGH were mostly Hong Kong citizens. “In


addition, several of the new account forms listed the customers’


liquid net worth and annual income at amounts significantly less


than the amount of AAGH that they sold.” Furthermore, FINRA


stated in its filing that, “In May 2009, the SEC filed a Complaint


against Mr. Riviello (CEO of AIS) for engaging in manipulative


schemes. The SEC complaint asserted that Riviello planned a


manipulative scheme for AAGH in 2006. The U.S. Department of


Justice filed a criminal indictment against employees of AIS


Financial, Inc. for several charges including fraud, conspiring to


commit securities fraud, and conspiring to commit money


laundering for their roles in a manipulative scheme involving


AAGH and other stocks during 2006 and 2007.” To see SEC’s


litigation click here, to see FINRA’s decision and press release, click

In February 2011, SEC charged Xiaoqing Du (a.k.a. Angela Du), CEO


and director of Global GPPL for being engaged in one or more


schemes to manipulate the price and volume of the GPPL shares by


paying for false spam e-mail campaigns. Ernest Cheung was GPPL’s


Secretary and Chief Financial Officer. Angela Du is currently


missing. Click here to see the report on GPPL. Click here to see the
