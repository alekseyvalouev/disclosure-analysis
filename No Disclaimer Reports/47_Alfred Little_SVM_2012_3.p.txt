Silvercorp Reluctantly Discloses Significantly Lower Resources And
Grades For Key SGX Mine

In today's report, I dig beneath the headlines to point out the recent reversal of fortune of
Silvercorp Metals' (NYSE:SVM) key SGX mine that accounted for 74% of SVM's total
production the last three years. SVM has done its best to mask the abrupt decline in the
SGX mine from investors. Nevertheless, it is now clear that the SGX mine has much lower
silver resource estimates than SVM previously disclosed and much lower grades of ore
recently produced.


1. AMC Mining Consultants 2012 Ying District Technical Report Discloses Much
Lower Silver Resources for the SGX Mine


Last year, I suggested SVM should upgrade its independent Qualified Persons (doing
business as "BK Exploration Associates") on the SGX mine to a major multinational
geological consulting firm with offices and staff in China. On 12/29/11, SVM responded by
engaging AMC Mining Consultants ("AMC") of 200 Granville Street, Suite 1330, in
Vancouver, Canada, to prepare updated technical reports on SVM's Ying District (including
SGX) and BYP mines (press release here). Like "BK Exploration Associates," AMC
disclosed that it heavily relied upon translations of key Chinese documents prepared by
SVM. AMC's principal geologist, Brian O'Connor, actually visited the Ying district mines in
February and April 2012.


On 6/5/12, SVM announced (here) highlights of the much-anticipated AMC technical
report with the promotional headline:


"Silvercorp Reports Significant Gain in Measured and Indicated Mineral
Resources and Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Ying Silver-Lead-
Zinc Mining District, Henan Province, China"


The "significant gain" touted in the headline referred to the 28% (21 million ounce)
increase in the combined Measured and Indicated mineral resources of the SGX, HZG,
HPG, and TLP/LM mines in the Ying district. As I show below, SVM's press release in
my opinion is highly misleading because it masks a dramatic 79% (60 million

ounce) decline in the Inferred silver resource, 46% (55 million ounce) decline in total
silver resource, and 59% decline in the silver grade of the Inferred resource at the
SGX mine.


The following tables compare the SGX silver equivalent resource estimates and metal
price assumptions as of 12/31/11 in AMC's technical report dated 6/13/12 (page iii) to the
SGX silver equivalent resource estimated as of 12/31/10 in BK's technical report dated
5/20/11 (page 7):


The large declines in silver resources shown in the tables above occurred despite
changes in the 2012 measurement criteria, last year's massive exploration program, and
significant higher metals price assumptions. These three factors should have significantly
boosted estimates, as follows:


1. SVM now uses a minimum silver cut off grade of 150g/t instead of 300 g/t, allowing it
to count far more resources in its calculations.


2. SVM used significantly higher metal price assumptions for silver equivalent
calculations allowing for more marginal resources to be counted


3. SVM completed its largest underground drilling exploration program on the SGX mine
to date, adding 61,066 meters to the 174,836 meters previously drilled as well as
11,186 meters of new tunnels


Ceteris paribus, these three positive factors should have resulted in a much higher silver
resource estimate. Why did the exact opposite actually happen? Why did SVM not
publicize this huge 60 million ounce decline in Inferred SGX silver resources?


Buried in its 6/5/12 press release, SVM attributes the decline in Inferred resources to:


"…conversion of Inferred Resources to Measured and Indicated categories by
extensive tunneling and drilling in 2011, and to a change in the grade interpolation
approach in 2012."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 3/20


SVM's explanation is misleading. Measured and Indicated silver resources increased by a
combined 4.9 million ounces, plus SVM purportedly produced around another 4 million
ounces, but these amounts do not come close to explaining the 60 million ounce decline in
the Inferred silver resource.


Therefore, the vast majority of the decline must be attributable to AMC taking a
more conservative approach than BK resulting in a much lower Inferred silver
resource estimate for the SGX mine. Looking back at my warnings last year that the
SGX resource estimates were likely too good to be true, the following table clearly
shows that I was right:


Are AMC's findings surprising? Not to anyone who seriously looked at SGX
resource data available from the local Chinese Land & Resources Bureau.


The biggest "red flag" that the SGX mine appears to have less resources than SVM
previously claimed was published on the Luoning County Land & Resource Bureau
("LRB") website on 11/30/09 listing the resources of the TLP, HPG and SGX mines in the
Ying district (a translated copy of the LRB web page can be found here).


The table below summarizes the LRB published silver, lead and gold resources  of the
TLP, HPG and SGX mines and compares them to the total resources disclosed in the
January 2010 Mineral Resources Estimates provided on page 10 of the 2/26/10 NI43-101
technical report on the Ying District mines:

For the TLP and HPG mines, the relative variance is reasonably small (in the range of
+69% to -42%). For the SGX mine, however, the NI43-101 resource estimate is over
900%, or ten times, higher than the LRB published resource estimate!


Why is the Chinese resource estimate for the SGX mine so much further at variance
relative to the other mines? I first pointed this out in my reports last year. SVM has
never, to date, offered any explanation for the widely different variances.


Mysteriously, after the publication of my reports last year, the LRB removed this
data from its website (invalid old link here), probably at the request of SVM. To date,
the LRB has not published a revised version of these resource estimates on its
website.


2. SVM Tried to Conceal that is SGX Grades are 32% Lower than Last Year


In its 2013 Q1 earnings press release (link here), SVM tried to avoid disclosing a dramatic
decline in the silver head grade of SGX ore by combining the results of the several Ying
mines together as a "district." For the entire district, the silver grade declined 16.2% from
271 g/t to 227 g/t.


However, in response to an analyst inquiry on the conference call, SVM Chairman Rui
Feng was forced to admit that the SGX silver head grade fell from 444 g/t a year ago
to "around 295 or 300" g/t, a decline of over 32% and double the decline of the
district.


Feng then said the grade would probably be the same for Q2 2013, thus admitting that
there would be two quarters of dramatically lower ore grades from the SGX mine, as
shown in the following chart:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 5/20


In its press release announcing its Q1 2013 results (link here), SVM provided the following
ludicrous excuse which blamed short sellers for the sharply lower production
grades:


"The "Short and Distort" attack last fall has caused Managements' time being
inadvertently, but necessarily diverted to deal with the crisis, which caused delays
implementing certain development plans at the SGX mine, resulting in a gap in the
mining schedule of blending ore from different zones with different grades."


The big decline in the SGX silver grade to 295-300g/t in the quarter ended 6/30/12 was a
huge surprise to investors who on the 5/18/12 earnings conference call (highlighted
transcript here) in which Rui Feng reiterated 2013 guidance (link here) of 460 g/t. Once
again, I question SVM's unwillingness to disclose negative material information.


Furthermore, on 8/1/12, the day before SVM reported horrible Q1 2013 results and many
weeks after SVM management became aware of the sharp declines in the SGX silver
grade and Inferred resource estimate, SVM announced positive drilling exploration results
for the SGX mine (link here).


I view the 8/1/12 positive announcement as a highly promotional attempt to support
SVM's stock price that was teetering at the $5 level ahead of the terrible Q1 2013
results SVM reported the next day.


Conclusion


- Rui Feng comment to shareholders at SVM's annual meeting in Vancouver on 9/23/11, according to The Globe & Mail
