Lumber Liquidators’ Stock Is Down 


Nearly 90% Since I First Presented It 


Note: I first presented this as my favorite short idea at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in November 2013.

Why I Covered 


I published an article in December explaining why I was exiting my short 


position in Lumber Liquidators. Here’s the summary: 


• I received information that leads me to believe that senior management of 


Lumber Liquidators wasn’t aware that the company was selling Chinese-


made laminate that had high levels of formaldehyde 


• If this information is correct, then the company was sloppy and naïve, but 


not evil 


• If there are no “smoking gun” documents/emails, then the doomsday 


scenario for the company (and the stock) is less likely 


At the time, LL also had a net cash position and I thought that: 


• Formaldehyde off-gassed to normal levels within 3-10 months  


• There was little/no cancer risk 


• The operating performance of the business might improve, if not in Q4 


then certainly once the company started to lap the March 1, 2015 first 


airing of the 60 Minutes story 


Based on the information I had at the time, it was a good decision to cover.
-6- 


Summary of Why I Put the Short Back On 


I continue to believe that LL’s senior management was unaware of the toxic 


laminate and thus no longer believe this company is evil, plus the stock is now 


a bit lower, so why have I reestablished a meaningful short position (my 


largest at 4+%)?  


Very simply, I have new information that leads me to believe that the odds of 


very bad outcomes for Lumber Liquidators and its stock have risen materially 


based on new information in six areas: 


1. Widespread media coverage of the CDC’s error and increased cancer risk appears 


to be having a severe impact on the business 


2. The cancer risk is likely significantly greater than even the CDC’s revised estimate, 


which could result in further damaging publicity and increased liabilities 


3. A “Prop 65” trial has just begun that LL is likely to lose, resulting in further adverse 


publicity 


4. Likelihood of even larger legal and regulatory liabilities 


5. Operating performance of the business in Q4 was much worse than I expected – 


and I think meaningful improvement is unlikely for quite some time (if ever) 


6. Lack of confidence in company leadership
-7- 


I Now Believe There Is at Least a 50% Chance That 


Lumber Liquidators Eventually Goes Bankrupt 


I now believe that there is at least a 50% chance that LL eventually goes 


bankrupt (despite the fact that the company had $6.7 million of net cash and 


$67.2 million available on its line of credit at the end of Q4, and, under normal 


circumstances, a nicely profitable business), for the following reasons: 


• I think operating losses and cash burn will remain severely negative (in 


the range of Q4’s -$20-$30 million per quarter) for the foreseeable future – 


and could even get worse 


• It will likely be very difficult and expensive to settle the regulatory issues 


(Consumer Product Safety Commission, CA Air Resources Board, etc.) as 


well as class action (multi-district litigation), securities fraud, and Prop 65 


cases, especially in light of the CDC recently tripling its exposure and 


cancer risk estimate, as well as the fact that more than one million 


Americans may have been exposed to LL’s Chinese-made laminate since 


2010 


• LL’s liability insurers have all denied coverage for the formaldehyde 


claims under the pollution exclusion in the insurance policies, forcing LL to 


pay its enormous legal fees out of pocket

More Than 1 Million Americans May Have Been 


Exposed to LL’s Chinese-Made Laminate Between 


2010 and May 7, 2015 


Assumptions/estimates: 


• LL finally suspended sales of Chinese-made laminate on May 7, 2015 


• For 2012 and 2013, laminate sales and percent from China are estimates 


• Average Ticket (Laminate) is an estimate based on 80% of the total ticket (laminate is cheaper than 


engineered and solid hardwoods) 


• People exposed is customers x 2.54 residents per household (US Census) 


• January – May 7, 2015 assumes that sales continued at 2014 levels in January and February and then fell by 


half after the 60 Minutes story aired on March 1, 2015
Widespread Media Coverage of the 


CDC’s Error and Increased Cancer 


Risk Appears to Be Having a Severe 


Impact on the Business
-10- 


Severe Impact of Recent Publicity About a 


Cancer Scare 


• Even though comps are now much easier now that we’ve just passed the 


one-year anniversary of the first airing of the 60 Minutes story, I believe 


that Lumber Liquidators’ sales will not recover in the first half of this year, 


possibly longer, due to a recent well-publicized cancer scare 


• According to my sources, the recent publicity has had a hugely 


deleterious impact on Lumber Liquidators – possibly even exceeding 


what happened in the aftermath of the initial 60 Minutes story 


• As we’ve seen over the past year, adverse publicity linking a Lumber 


Liquidators product to formaldehyde has severely damaged the business 


– but, let’s be honest, while exposure to this chemical sounds sort of 


scary, most people don’t know much about it. And to the extent they do, 


the primary symptoms – irritation of the eyes, nose and throat – don’t 


sound like cause for alarm 


• But everyone knows about – and is rightly terrified of – cancer. Thus, a 


Lumber Liquidators’ product (even one it no longer sells) becoming very 


publicly associated with increased cancer risk could be a mortal blow to 


the company
-11- 


The CDC’s Initial Report Was Moderately 


Favorable for Lumber Liquidators (1) 


• Last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 


released the results of the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s tests 


of Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-made laminate flooring 


• It was mostly good news for the company 


• Though the report found elevated levels of formaldehyde, in its 


conclusions the CDC seemed to be trying to downplay the risks and 


reassure homeowners 


• While acknowledging that “The amount of formaldehyde released could 


cause health symptoms in some people,” the media focused on this line: 


“The added cancer risk from exposure to formaldehyde released from the 


floorboards is small.” 


• Importantly (and, I believe, wrongly, as discussed later in this 


presentation), the CDC assured homeowners that if their flooring is more 


than two years old, the formaldehyde had likely “off-gassed” down to a 


normal level: “Several studies have shown that formaldehyde levels 


return to normal levels about 2 years after formaldehyde-emitting 


products are installed in a home.”
-12- 


The CDC’s Initial Report Was Moderately 


Favorable for Lumber Liquidators (2) 


• The CDC calculated that “the cancer risk from the off-gassing floorboards is 2 [to 9] 


additional cases of cancer per 100,000 people exposed” [20-90 per million] and 


reassured homeowners: “To put those numbers in perspective, the American Cancer 


Society (www.cancer.org) estimates that for people living in the United States, one in 


two men and one in three women will develop cancer from all causes.” 


• In its recommendations, the CDC suggested that homeowners should see a doctor if 


they have symptoms related to indoor air quality, and take steps to reduce the 


concentration of formaldehyde in the air (increase ventilation, lower temperature and 


humidity, cease smoking indoors, etc.).  


• But the CDC pooh-poohed the idea of widespread air testing (“Generally residents do 


not need to consider testing the air in their homes, especially if the flooring was 


installed more than two years ago.”) or replacing any flooring: 


Residents should consider the following before removing this type of laminate flooring 


from their homes:  


– If the flooring was installed more than 2 years ago, the levels of formaldehyde have most 


likely returned to what is normally found in homes — so there is probably no reason to 


remove it.  


– Removing laminate flooring may release more formaldehyde into the home. Some new 


flooring may also release formaldehyde.  


– Consult a certified professional (such as a CIH or REHS/RS) before taking any action to 


remove the flooring.
-13- 


• The media coverage of the report was minimal and, in general, quite 


favorable, highlighting that the cancer risk is de minimis and most 


homeowners don’t have to test the air much less replace the flooring 


• Not surprisingly, the stock rose ~20% in the next few days 


• The CDC report was consistent with my view (until recently) that the 


cancer risk was insignificant 


– In an article I published on April 9, 2015, I wrote: “formaldehyde, at 


the levels and length of exposure at issue here, is unlikely to cause 


cancer” and concluded that “Lumber Liquidators’ problem, while 


serious, isn’t as serious as asbestos” 


The CDC’s Initial Report Was Moderately 


Favorable for Lumber Liquidators (3)
-14- 


Then 60 Minutes Showed That the CDC Had Made a 


Terrible Mistake: Actual Formaldehyde Levels Were 3.3x 


Higher, Meaning There Was “Triple the Cancer Risk” 


It turns out that the CDC made a major computational error: its analysts calculated the 


formaldehyde concentration in the test room based on a ceiling height of eight meters 


instead of eight feet! 


60 Minutes learned of the CDC’s mistake and on Sunday, February 21st, Anderson 


Cooper gave the following update:  


After our story aired last March, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, working with 


the Centers for Disease Control, launched a study of that laminate flooring. This month, the 


government published its findings. They showed the flooring gave off enough formaldehyde to 


irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and could trigger breathing problems. It also increased 


cancer risk by a small amount.  


After the report was published, 60 Minutes was alerted to the possibility that government 


scientists made a major mathematical mistake in their report. We sent the report to scientists 


at several universities and discovered the government forget to convert feet to meters in some 


calculations.  


That error means that all the predicted formaldehyde levels from Lumber Liquidators’ 


flooring are 3.3 times higher than government scientists calculated, which can amount to more 


than 18 times higher levels of formaldehyde than those in a normal home and triple the cancer 


risk to a level that’s considered unacceptable by national and international health agencies.  


The Centers for Disease Control has admitted its mistake and issued a correction.  


The Consumer Product Safety Commission is continuing its investigation and told us it’s 


working to provide more specific answers to homeowners about the safety concerns.
-15- 


As Cooper Read the Update, Two Scary, Rising-


Bar Graphics Appeared in the Background 


• In addition to Cooper saying “triple the cancer risk”, the chart on the right 


says: “Additional cancer risk”
-16- 


• The CDC issued a press release on 2/18 admitting its error and tripling its 


formaldehyde exposure and cancer risk estimates: 
– “CDC/ATSDR was notified February 13 of an error in its report released February 10, 


2016, about the possible health effects from exposure to formaldehyde emitted from 


select laminate flooring samples. Health risks of people who have the laminate flooring 


are being revised to reflect greater exposure to formaldehyde, which could cause eye, 


nose, and throat irritation for anyone. The estimated risk of cancer associated with 


exposure to the flooring increased. 


The CDC/ATSDR indoor air model used an incorrect value for ceiling height. As a result, 


the health risks were calculated using airborne concentration estimates about 3 times 


lower than they should have been…After correcting the measurement in the model, 


CDC/ATSDR is revising the possible health effects…The estimated risk of cancer is 6-30 


cases per 100,000 people [60-300 per million].” 


• In the days after the 60 Minutes’ story and the CDC’s correction, there 


was a media frenzy, including stories on every major evening news 


program 


• Unlike the first round of (limited) publicity, the focus was on the increased 


cancer risk 


• The next day, the stock dropped 20% to around $11 


The CDC Admitted Its Error and Increased Its Estimate of 


Cancer Risk, Leading to Extensive, Damaging Media Coverage
-17- 


• Keep in mind that this is anecdotal, but my best source*, whose 


information is consistently accurate, tells me that this wave of publicity 


has had a hugely deleterious impact on Lumber Liquidators, possibly 


even exceeding what happened in the aftermath of the initial 60 Minutes 


story a year ago 


• The impact is in three primary areas: 


1. Sales are down because customers are avoiding Lumber Liquidators 


2. Customers with Lumber Liquidators’ flooring are returning it (if not yet 


installed) or demanding that it be removed 


3. Lumber Liquidators’ employees are demoralized and looking to leave 





The Impact on Lumber Liquidators 


Appears to Be Significant 


* My source is an industry veteran whose information and anecdotes are derived not from anyone at 


Lumber Liquidators itself, but from installers and others who have had interactions with the company.
-18- 


• A store manager on the east coast said that sales in January and February 


were the two worst months in the history of the store – and then things got 


worse! He said the week after the 60 Minutes update and resulting cancer 


scare was the “worst experience of his life.” In the first two days of March 


the store actually had negative revenue due to returns. 


• At another store, the incoming phone calls were so intense and frequent 


that the store manager unplugged it and threw it in the warehouse. 


• On Tuesday, February 23rd (two days after the 60 Minutes update aired), 


one store had a long line of people returning product – a total of $10,000-


$11,000 just that morning. 


• Last week, the store manager of a competitor, whose store is directly 


across the street from a LL store, looked over a half dozen times during the 


day and on at least two occasions saw trucks pulling in with product but 


leaving with nothing (i.e., returns). At least one customer came into the 


competitor’s store that day saying he had cancelled his order with LL and 


just wanted something “non-toxic”! The competitor says this is now a 


regular occurrence.  


Anecdotes – From Stores
-19- 


• My source has heard multiple stories of LL’s customers who are so 


desperate to get this “crap” out of their homes to protect the health of 


themselves and their families that they’re paying for removal themselves, 


even though they doubt that they’ll get a refund or any reasonable 


remedy from LL. They just don’t want a carcinogenic floor.  


• A customer showed up absolutely livid because she felt that the LL store 


manager had deceived her when he told her in January that the laminate 


floor she had purchased had been discontinued. She later learned that it 


had been pulled because it was toxic. The manager recounted this story 


to an installer and confessed, “You know what, she’s right. I lied to her. I 


feel so bad. I can’t keep doing this.” 


• A customer showed up with documentation showing that he had bought a 


floor from Lumber Liquidators in 2011-12, and last year his dog died from 


some strange cancer. Now he says he “knows what happened!” 


Anecdotes – From Customers
The Cancer Risk Is Likely 


Significantly Greater Than Even the 


CDC’s Upwardly Revised Estimate
-21- 


I Believe That the CDC Is Significantly 


Understating the Formaldehyde Exposure 


• I believe that the CDC’s report, even after adjusting it to increase 


formaldehyde levels by 3.3x, significantly understates the actual amount 


of formaldehyde that homeowners are exposed to, for two reasons: 


1. The CDC did two types of tests, small chamber and large chamber, 


and appeared to weight them equally  


o I believe that the large chamber test, which showed ~6x higher 


formaldehyde levels, is far more realistic and therefore that these results 


should be used to calculate risks of adverse health effects 


2. The CDC assured homeowners that if their flooring is more than two 


years old, the formaldehyde had likely off-gassed down to a normal 


level: “Several studies have shown that formaldehyde levels return to 


normal levels about 2 years after formaldehyde-emitting products are 


installed in a home.” 


o I believe this statement is incorrect; my analysis of the research regarding 


how quickly formaldehyde off-gasses leads me to believe that elevated 


(and dangerous) levels of formaldehyde persist for far longer than two 


years – and thus the cancer risk is much greater
-22- 


Large Chamber Testing Is Far More Realistic and 


Thus Should Be Weighted Much More Heavily 


• The small chamber test involves placing a piece of flooring in a small device 


(which ranges in size, but think the size of a microwave oven) and measuring the 


formaldehyde emitted 


– However: according to the CDC report, “The edges of the laminate flooring samples were 


sealed with aluminum tape to cover exposed edges in compliance with the small chamber 


test sampling method during analysis.” 


– Test data shows that the vast majority of the formaldehyde emitted by flooring comes 


from the edges, which are not sealed when flooring is installed 


• The large chamber test, according to the CDC report, “is intended to measure 


emissions from floorboards under conditions that mimic product installation in 


homes. The large chamber allows a larger sample, which means that boards are 


assembled as they would be in a home, that is, with seams and unsealed edges.” 


(emphasis added) 


• Clearly the large chamber test is far better at measuring the actual level of 


formaldehyde a homeowner is exposed to, and thus should be weighted much 


more heavily 


• The small-chamber tests (33 tests of 11 samples) showed average emissions of 


40 micrograms per square meters of material per hour (μg/m
2
-hr) (median: 63)* 


• The large-chamber tests (10 tests of 5 samples) averaged 252 μg/m
2
-hr (median: 


321)* – approximately six times higher than the small-chamber results 


* These figures are actually 3.3x higher due to the CDC’s calculation error.
-23- 


Formaldehyde Likely Does Not Off-Gas to 


Normal Levels Within Two Years 


• In its report, the CDC, based on three studies, assured homeowners that 


if their flooring is more than two years old, the formaldehyde had likely 


off-gassed down to a normal level:  


– “Research suggests that formaldehyde levels in recently built or 


renovated homes dissipate within the first two years after installation 


of formaldehyde-containing materials (Brown, 2002; Park and Ikeda, 


2006; Wolkoff et al., 1991), reaching background (“normal”) levels of 


indoor formaldehyde within the initial off-gassing period of two years.” 


• I believe that the CDC is misinterpreting the three studies it cites 


• In reality, I believe that elevated (and dangerous) levels of formaldehyde 


likely persist for longer – perhaps far longer – than two years 


• Therefore, the cancer risk is far greater than even the higher, revised 


estimate by the CDC of 60-300 per million
-24- 


The CDC Appears to Be Misinterpreting Studies 


on How Quickly Formaldehyde Off-Gasses (1) 


• The Brown study shows that while formaldehyde levels do indeed initially 


decay quickly (by 38-53% in the first 35 weeks), the emissions thereafter 


remain essentially constant 


• The Wolkoff study of occupied and unoccupied apartments shows that 


formaldehyde decreases by 68-73% within one month – but then not only 


doesn’t decline further, but actually increases – by 25% in the occupied 


apartment and, in the case of the unoccupied apartment during spring 


and summer months, back above the initial level
-25- 


The CDC Appears to Be Misinterpreting Studies 


on How Quickly Formaldehyde Off-Gasses (2) 


• The Park & Ikeda study shows a 36% decline in formaldehyde emissions for 


new homes (<6 months), but old homes (>6 months) showed no decline: 





























• Importantly, the year 3 value for both old and new homes, ~90 μg/m
3
, 


would, over a lifetime, using the CDC’s metrics, translate into an excess 


cancer risk of approximately 1,170 per million

Lumber Liquidators’ Expert Uses Unrealistic Assumptions 


to Conclude That Formaldehyde Off-Gases Quickly 


• Based on tests of raw particleboard, LL’s expert calculates that 


formaldehyde emissions decline quickly (left chart) 


• But actual LL laminated product shows little/no decline in the first four 


months (right chart), which makes sense as the laminate seals in most of 


the formaldehyde

-27- 


The Actual Cancer Risk May Be Far 


Higher Than Even the New CDC Estimates 


• After correcting its error, the CDC’s revised estimate triples the risk of cancer to “6-


30 cases per 100,000 people” [60-300 per million] 


• But the actual risk may be far higher because the CDC continues to assume “that 


formaldehyde levels return to normal levels about 2 years after formaldehyde-


emitting products are installed in a home.” 


• As shown on prior pages, this is likely an incorrect assumption 


• If one applies the formaldehyde levels that persist over extended periods, as 


predicted by the Brown and Park & Ikeda studies, to the small and large chamber 


test results of LL’s Chinese-made laminate, the excess cancer risk skyrockets:

The CDC Should Issue Another Correction 


• The evidence appears clear that the CDC is incorrect in: 


1) Giving equal weight to small- and large-chamber tests; and 


2) Assuming that formaldehyde off-gasses to normal levels within two 


years 


• Consequently, the actual cancer risk appears to be 12-26 times higher 


than the CDC’s current estimate of 60-300 per million
A Prop 65 Trial Has Just Begun That 


Lumber Liquidators Is Likely to Lose, 


Resulting in Further Adverse Publicity
-30- 


Prop 65 Is a California Environmental Law 


That Lumber Liquidators Likely Violated 


• In 1986, California voters approved an initiative to address their growing concerns 


about exposure to toxic chemicals. That initiative became the Safe Drinking Water 


and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known by its original name of 


Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires the State to publish a list of chemicals 


known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. This list, which 


must be updated at least once a year, has grown to include approximately 800 


chemicals since it was first published in 1987 


• Formaldehyde (gas) was added to the list on 1/1/88 because it can cause cancer 


• Proposition 65 requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts 


of chemicals in the products they purchase, in their homes or workplaces, or that 


are released into the environment 


• Prop 65 allows “any private person proceeding ’in the public interest’” to sue any 


entity suspected of violating the law 


• All a plaintiff has to do is prove that a product contains one of the toxic chemicals 


on the list, and then the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the amount of 


the chemical being emitted by the product falls below the No Significant Risk Level 


(NSRL) established by the state 


• Damages can include civil penalties of $2,500 per day per violation, subject to a 


one-year statute of limitations

-31- 


Lumber Liquidators Faces a Prop 65 


Lawsuit 


• Global Community Monitor, a California-based environmental 


organization, and Sunshine Park LLC, an entity formed by one or more 


anonymous hedge funds, have filed a Prop 65 lawsuit against Lumber 


Liquidators 


– I have had no contact with GCM nor the hedge fund(s) and don’t 


know who they are 


• I have posted the trial briefs here: 


– Plaintiffs’ trial brief: www.tilsonfunds.com/GCMbrief.pdf 


– Defendant’s (Lumber Liquidators’) trial brief: 


www.tilsonfunds.com/LLbrief.pdf 


• GSM is asking for the following damages: 


– A recall of the toxic flooring 


– Reimbursement of attorney’s fees 


– A penalty of $2,500/day per violation 


o I estimate that LL sold Chinese-made laminate to ~80,000 customers 


nationwide per year. If California was 12% of the total, that’s 9,600 


customers. At $2,500 each, that’s $24 million/day or $8.8 billion over one 


year!
-32- 


The Trial Phase of a Prop 65 Lawsuit Against 


Lumber Liquidators Began Last Week 


I asked Alexander Robertson of Robertson & Associates, a lawyer who is very 


familiar with this case, to comment. He replied: 


• The trial is bifurcated into liability (phase 1) and damages (phase 2)  


• The liability phase is estimated to last three weeks 


• A judge (not jury) will decide whether 26 varieties of LL’s Chinese-made laminate 


contain formaldehyde levels that exceed the 40 micrograms per day (µg/day) that 


Prop 65 has established as the No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) for 


formaldehyde 


• Plaintiffs’ 400+ tests, conducted at certified laboratories, show that the products 


initially exceed this level by an average of 600% 


• LL’s own expert calculates an even higher initial level, but argues, desperately 


and unconvincingly, that the formaldehyde off-gasses very quickly and most 


people sell their homes in within nine years so lifetime exposure doesn’t apply 


• The Prop 65 law neuters this argument, however, because it established the 


NSRL’s assuming a 70-year exposure based on current emission levels 


• LL will lose this trial and, even before the damages phase starts, the headlines 


will be that a judge has determined that LL’s laminates were toxic 


• This further adverse publicity will likely further impact sales to new customers and 


cause even more panic among prior Lumber Liquidators’ customers, who will 


demand refunds and replacement flooring
Likelihood of Even Larger Legal and 


Regulatory Liabilities
-34- 


Lumber Liquidators Faces Enormous Legal 


and Regulatory Liabilities 


• LL settled Lacey Act violations (related to illegally harvested hardwoods) 


with the Department of Justice last October for $13.2 million 


• But the company has yet to reach settlements with any of the regulators 


or lawyers related to formaldehyde – and the CDC recently tripling the 


exposure level and cancer risk by 3.3x will make undoubtedly make 


settlements that much more difficult and expensive to achieve 


• The amounts at stake here could make the cost of the Lacey Act 


settlement look like chump change 


• And if the CDC revises the risk upward again, as I believe it should, then 


all bets are off
-35- 


Lumber Liquidators Faces Multiple Legal 


Liabilities 


Potential legal liabilities include: 


• The Prop 65 lawsuit discussed earlier 


• A class action (multi-district litigation) lawsuit seeking monetary damages 


for customers to remove and replace toxic flooring 


– I heard last month from two sources that Lumber Liquidators was close to a 


settlement that would have provided customers with a store credit for 


replacement flooring, but I suspect this option is no longer viable 


• Securities fraud lawsuits claiming that LL concealed material information 


about the formaldehyde problem from shareholders 


– Damages are shareholders’ losses based on the drop in stock price 


– From its peak, LL has lost more than $3 billion in market cap 


• Compensation to customers who’ve suffered adverse health effects 


– In addition to cancer, other symptoms, according to the CDC report, include: 


“asthma symptoms and other respiratory issues for people with asthma and 


COPD” and “eye, nose, and throat irritation for anyone” 


– While I am not aware of any mass torts related to cancer or other adverse 


health effects, with ~1 million people exposed since 2010, I think there will 


likely be many lawsuits around this

Lumber Liquidators Faces Multiple 


Regulatory Liabilities As Well 


Regulators could require Lumber Liquidators to: 


• Pay large fines 


• Contact all customers who purchased LL’s Chinese-made laminate, warn 


them of the risks, and offer them proper testing (estimated cost: 


~$1,500/home) 


– If 10% of the 400,000 customers who purchased LL’s Chinese-made laminate 


since 2010 demand proper testing, that’s $60 million 


• Tear out and replace all floors emitting high levels of formaldehyde 


(~$3,500/home*)  


– If 3% require remediation, that’s another $42 million** 


* Former LL CEO Rob Lynch stated on the 3/12/15 Business Update Conference Call: “Once the full analysis of the home’s air quality is 


completed and if the customer is still not satisfied, we will consider a reinstallation, the cost of which is expected to range from $3,000 to 


$4,000.” 


** In LL's “Update on Laminate Flooring Source from China” press release dated 5/7/15, the company stated that 97% of the test kits showed 


indoor air concentrations of formaldehyde that were within World Health Organization guidelines (meaning 3% were higher). I think the actual 


number is much higher, but am using 3% to be conservative.
-37- 


Regulators Should Require Lumber Liquidators 


To Take a Number of Steps 


Regulators should require Lumber Liquidators to do what any honest and reputable company 


would have immediately done: 


1) Offer a full refund to any customers who want to return Chinese-made laminate that was 


purchased prior to 5/7/15 (when LL finally suspended sales of this product) 


2) Rather than waiting for inbound calls and complaints, Lumber Liquidators should send a letter 


to every customer who purchased its Chinese-made laminate flooring between, say, 2010 and 


5/7/15, informing them that the product may be emitting dangerous levels of formaldehyde and 


offering a proper test 


3) Cease the bogus “Bio-Badge” formaldehyde testing program that it’s currently offering 


customers (see my article, Lumber Liquidators’ Offer to Do Indoor Air Quality Testing Appears 


to Be a Sham), and instead offer to send a trained specialist with sophisticated equipment to 


do proper testing 


4) For any customers with a reading above 0.016 parts per million (16 ppb or 20 μg/m
3
), the 


standard set by both FEMA and NIOSH (I’m being generous – 7 ppb is the limit set by the 


California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment; for more on this, see my article, 


More On Lumber Liquidators And Formaldehyde), offer to pay all costs for them to, if they 


wish, temporarily move out of their home until the flooring can be removed and replaced with 


safe flooring; also, for these customers, offer to pay all medical bills for anyone in the home 


suffering symptoms consistent with formaldehyde exposure 


5) Establish a fund to pay for future health costs of customers who suffer adverse health effects 


associated with exposure to formaldehyde 


(Beyond formaldehyde, if they’re really feeling ambitious, regulators should require LL to address 


chronic quality problems with its Morningstar bamboo flooring, which is notorious for creaking, 


cracking, warping and shrinking, especially in warm and humid areas.)

Summary of 2015 Financial Performance 


• Lumber Liquidators’ operations are performing even more poorly than I thought 


they would when I covered this position a couple of months ago – and I can see 


no signs of a turnaround 


• As we saw in Q4, the inventory reduction has run its course so Lumber 


Liquidators will no longer be able to generate free cash flow far in excess of its net 


income – rather, the two will track each other fairly closely going forward 


• Turning to the balance sheet, as of the end of Q4 (12/31/15), the company had 


$67.2 million available on its line of credit and $6.7 million in net cash, but both 


are declining rapidly 


– Net cash fell sharply from $33.8 million at the end of Q3 to $6.7 million at the end of Q4 – 


and is likely negative now  


o On the Q4 conference call on 2/29/16, CFO Greg Whirley said: “During the first quarter of 2016, 


we borrowed an additional $10 million against our asset-based revolving credit facility to fund 


additional inventory purchases in advance of the higher volume spring flooring season.” 


• Thus, the onus is now on the company to turn things around because if sales and 


margins remain depressed, it could soon be in big trouble 


• I don’t lightly throw out the possibility of Lumber Liquidators going bankrupt, but 


simple math tells me this is not only possible but likely within a year if the 


company keeps posting quarterly losses in the $30 million range
Lack of Confidence in  


Company Leadership
-48- 


The Current CEO and Board Don’t Appear 


to Be Capable of Turning LL Around 


• Pretty much the entire board and the current CEO, John Presley, presided over 


Lumber Liquidators when, over an extended period, it purchased and imported 


illegally harvested hardwoods and toxic laminate, thereby bringing the company to 


its knees – yet these are the people who are supposed to fix the mess they’re 


responsible for??? 


• If they had confidence in their ability to turn things around, why aren’t they buying 


stock? 


– There hasn’t been one insider purchase in the past year 


• John Presley, who’s been on LL’s board since 2006 and was chairman of the audit 


committee in recent years, has no retail experience – his entire career has been in 


banking – and, according to two of my sources, he’s not getting the job done: 


– Multiple store managers say that their sales plan (on which each manager’s bonus is 


based) has been increased to 2014 levels, so few stores have any chance of hitting their 


goal. In one region, with over 20 stores, only a few hit plan in February 


– This has further demoralized store managers, who are increasingly seeking employment 


elsewhere 


– LL’s supply chain, price articulation strategy, product selection and quality are all areas of 


severe neglect and concern 


– Both merchandising and operations are in need of an upgrade 


• My conclusion is that the board needs to find a new CEO – and shareholders need 


to replace most of the board – before it’s too late

How Has Gross Margin Risen?  


• On the Q3 13 conference call, LL CFO Daniel Terrell said: "Our third 


quarter average sale was $1,745, up [7.1%] from $1,630 in 2012 due to 


an increase in average retail price per unit sold, which benefited from a 


net increase in the sales mix of premium flooring products, a 180 basis 


point increase in the sales mix of moldings and accessories [from 16.7% 


to 18.5%] and stronger retail price discipline at the point of sale." 


• Later, he added: "Our gross margin over the past two years has benefited 


from a portfolio of initiatives working individually and in combination to 


deliver cumulative multiyear benefit…We aggregate gross margin drivers 


in three primary categories, all of which contributed to third quarter 


expansion. The product margin drove 300 basis points due to shifts in our 


sales mix, including an increase in moldings and accessories, lower cost 


of product due to sourcing initiatives and higher like kind ASP, not due to 


retail price increases, but a result of greater retail price discipline at the 


point-of-sale.“ (emphasis added) 


• I believe that a substantial fraction of LL's gross (and operating) margin 


expansion is due simply to buying the same products for less.

Another Explanation for Why LL’s 


Margins Have Skyrocketed 


• Robert Lynch became President of LL in January 2011 and then CEO a year later. 


Many attribute the company’s improved performance, especially margin increases, 


to his leadership, but I think another event two years ago also played a critical role 


• In late 2011, LL paid $8 million to acquire Sequoia, which is based in Shanghai, for 


its "quality control and assurance, product development, claims management and 


logistics operations in China. We believe our cost of product was reduced, primarily 


in 2012, due to both the net cost reduction of owning those services and the 


benefits of working directly with the mills." – LL 2012 AR 


• Since this acquisition, the percentage of product sourced in Asia has risen from 


42% to 51% and margins have skyrocketed: 




















How could a tiny $8 million acquisition have such a big impact??? It's not like 


directly sourcing wood from mills in China is some great secret, unavailable to 


Home Depot, Lowe's and others…

I Believe That a Meaningful Portion of LL's 


Margin Expansion Is Due to Buying Illegal Wood 


• On October 9th, the Environmental Investigation Agency, 


a London-based nonprofit that conducts "undercover 


investigations, including audio and video recordings, to 


expose environmental crime", released a 64-page report, 


Liquidating the Forests: Hardwood Flooring, Organized 


Crime, and the World's Last Siberian Tigers (http://eia-


global.org/news-media/liquidating-the-forests), which 


"details the organized crime of illegal timber harvesting in 


Eastern Russia, and tracks the wood across the border 


into China, through factories and warehouses, to its 


ultimate destination in showrooms around the world."  


• "During a multiyear investigation by the EIA, Lumber Liquidators, the largest 


specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in the United States, emerged as the 


strongest example of a U.S. company whose indiscriminate sourcing 


practices link U.S. customers to the destruction of critically endangered tiger 


habitat and forests in the RFE [Russian Far East]. While making record 


profits in recent years, Lumber Liquidators has turned a blind eye as its 


purchases have fueled rampant illegal logging in the region."

A <2 Minute Excerpt of EIA's 


11-Minute Video 


Source: EIA (posted at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKqwMH2N0vc or simply Google “EIA Lumber Liquidators video”)
-15- 


Is the EIA Report Correct – And If So, So 


What? 


• The EIA report is meticulously researched and documented – it's an 


extremely impressive piece of investigative work 


• The story is consistent with everything we know about Russia and China: 


the Wild West of capitalism, widespread corruption, little rule of law or 


concern for environmental issues, etc. 


• Both EIA's evidence and common sense indicate that the EIA report is 


directionally correct – but the devil is in the details: how widespread is the 


illegal logging in Russia, how many mills in China are trafficking in illegal 


wood, and how compromised is LL's supply chain? 


• My best guess is that this is a big problem, not a small one 


• But even if I'm right, so what? Lots of companies are doing lots of even 


more nefarious things and regulators/authorities do nothing 


• What's the catalyst?
-16- 


Federal Authorities Raided LL's 


Headquarters Two Months Ago 


• On September 26th, agents from the Department of Homeland Security's 


Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 


Service raided LL’s headquarters, executing sealed search warrants 


"which relate to the importation of certain of the Company's wood flooring 


products" 


• LL hasn't revealed any further information other than to say: "We are 


continuing to cooperate fully with the authorities to provide them with the 


requested information and there is no update or additional information 


pertaining to the request that we can provide at this time." (Q3 '13 


conference call, 10/23/13)  


• Normally a stock falls sharply and stays depressed with news like this – 


but in this environment (and in light of LL's blowout Q3 earnings), the 


stock is near its all-time high
-17- 


The Lacey Act 


• The Lacey Act of 1900 prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have 


been illegally taken, transported or sold 


• It was amended in 2008 to include anti-illegal-logging provisions 


• It carries criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation 


• The most relevant prior use was against Gibson Guitar, which the United 


States Fish and Wildlife Service raided in 2009, accusing the company of 


illegally importing hardwoods from Madagascar 


• The case was settled on August 6, 2012, with Gibson admitting to 


violating the Lacey Act and agreeing to pay a fine of $300,000 in addition 


to a $50,000 community payment
-18- 


How I Think It Will Play Out 


• I do not think federal authorities are likely to impose a meaningful fine 


• I think LL will successfully claim that it didn't know it was buying illegal 


wood (unless company executives were very indiscrete in their emails 


and documents) 


• Like Gibson Guitar (see appendix), LL will probably pay a small fine a 


year or two from now 


• BUT – this is key – LL will have to ensure that it is no longer buying illegal 


wood 


• While the largest mill supplying LL only accounts for 4% of LL's hardwood 


purchases, I think it is likely that a meaningful percentage of the 51% of 


LL's wood sourced in Asia is from Chinese mills that are trafficking in 


illegal wood 


• Thus, the raid by federal authorities – even before any resolution is 


announced – is likely to disrupt LL's supply chain and materially impact 


margins

Lumber Liquidators's Stock Is Priced for 


Perfection 


• Stock price (11/21/13 close): $115.36 


• Market cap: $3.2 billion 


• Cash: $84 million 


• Debt: $0 


• Enterprise value: $3.1 billion 


• TTM EPS: $2.53 


• 2014 est. EPS: $3.47 


• P/E (trailing): 46x 


• P/E (2014 est.): 33x 


• EV/EBITDA (trailing): 24x 


• TTM revenues: $954 million 


• P/S (trailing): 3.4x 


Any disruption to Lumber Liquidators's supply chain and/or margins could 


result in the stock being cut in half.
-20- 


My Two-Year Price Target Is $53 


• Sales in 2015: $1.35 billion (16% annual increase in 2014 and 2015) 


• Operating margin: 9% (give back half of the 830 basis point increase in 


the last nine quarters and go to 9%, still far above LL’s long-term 


average) 


• Tax rate: 39% 


• Diluted shares outstanding: 28 million 


• Equals EPS of $2.65 


• P/E multiple of 20 (generous if earnings are flat for two years and 


margins contract) 


• Equals share price of $53
Summary: There Are Many Ways to Win 


• The valuation is very high – far above historical and peer averages 


• Operating margin is at an all-time high, roughly double the historical 


average 


• The raid by federal authorities could impact the company in many ways: 


• LL might have to change many of its suppliers, which could raise product costs 


and disrupt its supply chain 


• It could suck up significant time and attention of management 


• Legal/compliance costs might be large, both up front and ongoing 


• LL might get hit with a big financial penalty and/or other actions such as 


charges against management 


• The EIA report might get picked up by the media and/or social networking, 


which could impact sales and put additional pressure on the company 


• LL may have a formaldehyde problem, which could gain traction thanks to 


a class action lawsuit that was just filed 


• A major new direct competitor, Floor & Decor, has emerged and is growing 


rapidly 


• Customer dissatisfaction appears to be extremely high, which could impact 


future growth

What LL Says About Its Sourcing 


CEO Robert Lynch, Q3 '13 conference call, 10/23/13 
"I can assure you of our commitment to uncompromising integrity and ethical business conduct across all 


areas of Lumber Liquidators' operations. We expect and require the same with our suppliers. Working together, 


we strive to advance responsible forest management. The nature of our supplier relationships within our direct 


sourcing model allows us to develop and produce the highest quality merchandise in the broadest assortment at 


industry-leading value. We believe these direct relationships are unique in our industry and provide us with a 


competitive advantage.  


We work collaboratively with our suppliers, from planning to payment, and expect them to stand by their 


promises and commitments as we do. We are sought after by mills all over the world and we have a supplier due 


diligence process designed to identify long-term relationships that can provide sustainable and growing supplies 


of our product. Many mills are disqualified during this on-boarding process. Once we establish a mill relationship, 


we monitor and enforce our specifications and practices through more than 60 employees dedicated to quality 


control and assurance located on the ground in the U.S., Canada, China and South America. 


We invest significant time and resources to safeguard quality and enforce product compliance and we 


terminate relationships with suppliers we believe are not adherent to those standards. As a result of these 


processes, we diversify our sourcing across more than 100 suppliers, this affords us flexibility in making changes 


to meet consumer trends or if we find that the supplier is not willing to comply with our policies. 


It is important to note that no single mill provides more than 4% of our hardwood purchases and no single 


hardwood product represents more than 1% of our sales mix."

LL’s Response to My Presentation 


LL stock fell 12% the day of my presentation, which led the company to 


release this statement: 


"Mr. Tilson did not contact the company in compiling his presentation and we 


have never met with him to discuss our business.  Mr. Tilson’s presentation is based 


entirely on his own speculation and the contents of a report released almost two 


months ago which we had previously stated contained numerous inaccuracies and 


unsubstantiated claims.  Lumber Liquidators is committed to uncompromising 


integrity in how the Company operates, across all areas of the business.  We have 


policies and procedures in place for the sourcing, harvesting and manufacturing of 


all of our products, monitored by professionals located around the world.  We 


support the protection of the environment and responsible forest management, and 


we invest significant time and resources to safeguard quality control and 


compliance.  As a result of our processes, we diversify our sourcing across more 


than 100 suppliers, which affords us the flexibility to make changes to meet 


consumer trends and move business away from any supplier unwilling to comply 


with our policies.  If we find that any of the Company’s suppliers are not adhering to 


our standards, we will discontinue sourcing from those suppliers.  It is important to 


note that no single mill provides more than 4% of our hardwood purchases and no 


single hardwood product represents more than 1% of our sales mix."
-25- 


My Response to LL (1) 


Lumber Liquidators asserts that the EIA report “contained numerous inaccuracies and 


unsubstantiated claims”, but has yet to provide even one fact to rebut the report, which I found to 


be an extremely impressive piece of investigative work – and 100% consistent with everything 


we know about the wild-west business environment in Russia and China: widespread corruption, 


weak rule of law, little concern for the environment, etc.  


Federal authorities obviously think the EIA report is credible, as agents from the Department 


of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 


Service on September 26th raided LL’s headquarters, executing sealed search warrants "which 


relate to the importation of certain of the Company's wood flooring products."  


Lumber Liquidators’s only response has been to say (on the Q3 earnings conference call), 


"We are continuing to cooperate fully with the authorities to provide them with the requested 


information and there is no update or additional information pertaining to the request that we can 


provide at this time." The company’s silence speaks volumes. 


Lumber Liquidators’s second line of defense appears to be that even if the EIA report is 


correct, it focuses on only one supplier, which the company can simply stop sourcing from with 


minimal disruption since “no single mill provides more than 4% of our hardwood purchases and 


no single hardwood product represents more than 1% of our sales mix.” 


I’m skeptical that this is an isolated problem limited to one rogue supplier. Rather, the 


combination of a) the evidence in the EIA report, b) the unusually rapid increase in Lumber 


Liquidators’s margins to unprecedented levels immediately after acquiring a Chinese supply 


chain company, and c) the hugely corrupt business environment in both Russia and China lead 


me to believe that Lumber Liquidators has a big problem on its hands. Though I can’t prove it, 


the evidence I see, combined with common sense, makes me think it’s highly likely that what 


EIA has uncovered is a pervasive problem across Lumber Liquidators’s Chinese supply chain.
-26- 


My Response to LL (2) 


My response (continued): 


Since the raid, I assume that the company is scrambling to show the authorities that whatever 


problems are in their supply chain are isolated cases, they didn't know about it, etc. But keep in 


mind that the authorities raided Lumber Liquidators based on the EIA report, so they're not going 


to be easily fooled by some spin and token actions. Rather, I think Lumber Liquidators right now 


has no choice but to very quickly clean up its act to avoid major sanctions by the authorities. 


Specifically, I think Lumber Liquidators will have to: 1) immediately stop sourcing from 


suppliers they even suspect are trafficking in illegal wood; 2) find replacement suppliers; and 3) 


ensure their entire worldwide supply chain is pristine. Doing all of these things is likely to be very 


costly and disruptive to the business – not to mention management being distracted by having to 


deal with the authorities for the foreseeable future.  


These things might not matter if the stock were cheap, but it’s not: after a 7x run-up in less 


than two years, it trades at 40x trailing earnings and 22x trailing EBITDA. 


My two-year price target is $53 (and I think I’m being generous) based on the following back-


of-the-envelope math: 


Sales grow 16% annually in the next two years, as analysts expect (resulting in revenue of 


$1.35 billion) 


Operating margins give back half of the 830 basis point increase in the last nine quarters and 


fall to 9% (still far above the long-term average) 


The market responds to this by assigning the stock a 20x P/E multiple 


Result: $1.35B x 9% - 39% tax rate / 28M shares = $2.65 EPS x 20 = $53

My Analysis of Lumber Liquidators’ 


Updated Guidance 


• On December 9th, Lumber Liquidators updated its guidance for Q4 and 


2014 and released a new investor presentation. I believe this new 


information provides evidence to support the key pillar of my investment 


thesis: that margins will come under pressure, leading Lumber Liquidators 


to miss the exuberant expectations built into the stock price.  





• On December 10th, I posted an article on Seeking Alpha entitled My 


Analysis of Lumber Liquidators’ Updated Guidance:

-28- 


Another Short Thesis 


David Peligal, Analyst, Grant's Interest Rate Observer 


"The bullish Lumber Liquidators' story revolves around the potential 


opportunity for the company to open 600 stores in the United States over the 


next couple of years and to take market share from independent floor-


covering retailers… 


Now it's true that new stores cannibalize old stores, but let's make the 


generous assumption that a mature LL store can generate $3.5 million of 


revenues per year. Furthermore, assume LL can open a total of 600 stores, 


and that total revenue at some point in the future will be $2.1 billion (600 


stores times $3.5 million per store). Say, in addition, that LL can take share 


from independent retailers and that operating margin climbs to 14%. You 


would then have $294 million in earnings before interest and taxes ($2.1 


billion in future revenues times a 14% margin).  


Because, at this indeterminate point in the future, LL will have become a 


mature retail concept, apply a multiple of 14. You get about $2.6 billion of 


value, or perhaps $2.4 billion, as the stores don't just build themselves."

A Formaldehyde Problem? 


• A short seller bought three samples of flooring LL imported from China, 


had them tested for formaldehyde, and discovered that one was tainted 


with dangerous levels of formaldehyde: 


– "I recently conducted independent lab testing -- engaging Berkeley Analytical, 


an IAS accredited testing laboratory -- on a sample of Lumber Liquidators 


house brand flooring ("Mayflower" brand), and the results that came back 


weren't pretty: Over 3.5x the maximum legal level for formaldehyde. (This 


product was purchased retail from a Southern California retail store.) Fully 


understanding the importance of this finding, we submitted samples from the 


same package to a second laboratory, this one the "gold standard" lab for the 


National Wood Flooring Association, NTA. This second lab confirms the 


product is in violation of the legal limit for formaldehyde." 


• By itself, this proves nothing – but tainted products from China are so 


common that I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a big problem 


for LL

A Formaldehyde Scare in China 


Source: Illegal Products Could Spell Big Trouble At Lumber Liquidators, Xuhua Zhou, Seeking Alpha, 6/20/13. 


• "A&W, Anxin Weiguang Flooring, was a leading hardwood flooring company in 


China until February of 2012 when a consumer advocate broke the news on the 


Internet that A&W branded engineered hardwood flooring products do not meet 


regulatory formaldehyde emission standards. For investors who are unfamiliar with 


formaldehyde, it is listed as a known carcinogen in June of 2011 by the National 


Toxicology Program. In addition to being a known human carcinogen, 


formaldehyde is also shown to cause childhood asthma and female reproductive 


issues. A&W is a major Chinese flooring company counting Carlyle as one of its 


investors. Media nicknamed the issue "toxic flooring gate" and drew an incredible 


amount of attention from consumers. Among the allegations, the advocate detailed 


A&W branded engineered hardwood flooring products used in certain 


condominiums developments significantly exceed the regulatory limits and such 


flooring products were sourced directly from A&W. The issue turned into a major 


controversy forcing China Vanke, the largest residential real estate developer in 


China, to re-test all the flooring products sourced from A&W. After comprehensive 


testing of the flooring products in question, Vanke identified at least one of its 


developments where the formaldehyde emission level of the flooring products was 


noncompliant. The incident caused significant public concerns and subsequently, 


A&W experienced a drastic sales slump and almost went bankrupt as a result of 


the incident."

stars), but as Xuhua Zhou notes: 


– "The Google reviews are notoriously known to be subject to easy 


manipulation. The issue got so severe that Google itself had to issue a 


warning to SEO and businesses to avoid fake reviews. In the case of Lumber 


Liquidators, the reviews on Google Shopping are especially suspicious. 


Investors should take time to scroll down a number of pages and actually read 


the reviews. Most of the reviews came from Online Shopper (I do not think 


many consumers who purchase LL products do so exclusively online). And 


almost 96% of the reviews or 3168 of them came from a single source, 


Bizrate."

• More importantly, however, I now believe that my investment thesis a

sourcing illegally harvested Siberian hardwoods from Chinese mills – is 


only the tip of the iceberg 





I believe that Lumber Liquidators is trafficking in tainted wood to a much 


greater degree than just hardwoods – and I think I will soon be able to prove 


this, so stay tuned
The Third Presentation
Why I’m Short Lumber Liquidators (LL) 
 
 





Whitney Tilson 
Kase Capital Management 


June 14, 2015
-35- 


Despite the Stock's Collapse, Lumber 
Liquidators Remains My Largest Short Position 


• The stock isn't cheap: at $21.49, it's still trading at 14.4x analysts' 
estimates for 2016 of $1.49 


• I see nothing but bad news emerging for the company over the short-, 
intermediate- and long-term horizons.  


• I think regulators (most likely the California Air Resources Board and the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission) will announce that their tests of 
Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate show the same (very high) 
levels of formaldehyde shown by the tests 60 Minutes, myself and others 
commissioned. 


• At that point, I expect regulators to take strong action against the 
company, including fines/penalties, requiring proper testing, and 
remediation steps. 


• I think that the legal liabilities will be enormous, especially once hard 
evidence emerges that the company was knowingly poisoning its own 
customers. 


– I see the largest legal exposure in two areas: a) damages to customers who 
suffered adverse health effects and b) damages to investors who bought the 
stock at inflated prices based on information (the true source of margin and 
profit expansion) that management knew was false.

The 60 Minutes Story Aired on March 1st  


• On March 1st, 60 Minutes, the longest running, most respected 
investigative news program in the U.S., aired a devastating 
story about how Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate 
has dangerous levels of formaldehyde 


• The most devastating part of the 60 Minutes story was hidden 
camera footage from the Chinese laminate mills, where 
employees confessed that the laminate being manufactured for 
LL was not CARB2 compliant

I Think It's 90%+ Likely That Senior Managers of 
Lumber Liquidators Knew That the Company Was 
Sourcing Non-CARB-Compliant Laminate 


• Was Lumber Liquidators duped by its Chinese suppliers – in which case, the 
senior managers are guilty of nothing more than being sloppy, naïve and/or overly 
trusting – or did they knowingly source toxic laminate and poison their customers 
to save ~10% on their sourcing costs?  


• If the latter proves to be the case, it would be devastating to the company in the 
courtroom, amongst regulators, and in the court of public opinion – so much so, in 
fact, that I believe the fate of the company (and the stock) will be largely 
determined by this issue. It would also indicate that the senior managers are truly 
evil and are engaging in a massive cover-up to hide their behavior. 


• I think it's 90%+ likely that they knew for the nine reasons outlined on the next six 
pages. 


• However, I cannot prove my hypothesis. To date, no damning emails, documents 
or whistle-blowers have emerged, nor have any Chinese suppliers ratted them out. 
But I'm not surprised by this – these things take time, and it's been less than three 
months since the 60 Minutes story aired. 


• I'm confident that the truth will eventually be discovered by the many regulators, 
lawyers, reporters and short sellers who are carefully scrutinizing the company.
-40- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (1) 


1. Two anonymous tips 
– "I must start by saying that you have become something of a hero here. For 


years, all us mom-and-pop indy flooring retailers suspected something was 
awry at Lumber Liquidators. You have brought this to light. THANK YOU. 
There is a good chance in the next week or so I will be in possession of the 
smoking gun you seek on proving various knowledge by Lumber's 
management." 


– "I would put myself in the top 5 or 10 people who knew what was going on. I 
have some fairly damning information that they did it to save a buck, and they 
knew about it. I also know someone else involved." 


2. A long-time installer for Lumber Liquidators told me that when he 
complained to the company about the high failure rate of their bamboo 
flooring, a senior executive told him it was occurring because they 
switched to an inferior water-based resin because the prior bamboo 
flooring had high levels of formaldehyde (due to a formaldehyde-based 
resin).
-41- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (2) 


3. Lumber Liquidators' behavior 
– Since the 60 Minutes story broke, the company has, in my opinion, acted 


exactly as I'd expect a guilty company, not an honest and reputable one, 
which would have immediately taken the following steps: 


• Stop selling the product in question (even if it doubted the validity of the testing 60 Minutes did, 
why take any chances with customers' health and the company's reputation, not to mention future 
liabilities?). 


• Offer a full refund to any customers who wanted to return unopened product. 
• Set up a Special Committee of the board, made up of independent directors, to conduct a full 


investigation. 
• Hire an independent firm to do a wide range of testing, not just of Chinese-made laminate, but all 


of the company's products. 
• Offer to send a trained specialist with sophisticated equipment to do proper testing in customers' 


homes. 
• Rather than waiting for inbound calls and complaints, send a letter to every customer who had 


purchased the product in question in the past, say, five years, informing them that the product may 
be emitting dangerous levels of formaldehyde and offering a proper test. 


• For any customers with a reading above 0.016 parts per million (16 ppb), the standard set by both 
FEMA and NIOSH (I'm being generous – 7 ppb is the limit set by the California Office of 
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment), offer to pay all costs for them, if they wish, to 
temporarily move out of their home until the flooring can be removed and replaced with safe 
flooring (even if the customer chooses carpeting or wood flooring bought from another company). 
Also, for these customers, offer to pay all medical bills for anyone in the home suffering symptoms 
consistent with formaldehyde exposure.
-42- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (3) 


4. The sudden and unexpected resignation last week of CEO Robert Lynch 
and the departure a month ago of CFO Dan Terrell 


– People with nothing to hide tend not to suddenly quit (or get fired from) their 
jobs when under scrutiny. 


5. Industry scuttlebutt 
– Pretty much everyone I've talked to tells me that LL is a notorious bad actor: 


cutting corners at every opportunity, selling very low-quality products, treating 
customers, vendors, installers and employees badly, and, most damningly, not 
being serious about compliance. 


6. Knowledge of the industry, the product, and China 
– Laminate is a low-end, global commodity product in which 1% or 2% differences 


in pricing are meaningful. Thus, a savvy player like LL, which has been buying 
in China for roughly two decades, would instantly know that if they were buying 
10% below the standard price for a particular type of laminate that something 
was wrong: perhaps it was stolen, used illegal or inferior materials, was of 
exceptionally low quality, or was filled with toxic chemicals.  


– This is especially true given that China is the wild west when it comes to 
environmental standards and rule of law. 


– You can't hit the low bid in China and expect to get high-quality, compliant 
product.
-43- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (4) 


7. Knowledge of the Chinese mills 
– The Chinese mills openly sell non-CARB-compliant laminate – just ask them 


for a price quote. This isn't surprising, as they sell to customers all over the 
world and many countries don't have formaldehyde standards. 


– It's simple: the Chinese mills will produce whatever the customer orders and 
package it however the customer wishes, even if it says the laminate is 
CARB-compliant when it's not. Heck, they'll even provide phony 
documentation to that effect! This is all part of the customer service package 
many Chinese mills are happy to provide – especially to a very big customer 
like Lumber Liquidators. 


8. A lie-detection analysis 
– The ex-CIA guys at Qverity, authors of Spy the Lie, did a careful analysis of 


what Lumber Liquidator' founder and Chairman, Tom Sullivan, did and didn't 
say when he was interviewed by Anderson Cooper in the 60 Minutes story, 
and they have posted a damning report that concludes: 


QVerity's behavioral analysis of the interview concluded that Sullivan was likely aware 
that his company was selling flooring that was non-compliant with these regulations, 
and that he appeared to be withholding information, the disclosure of which could 
result in serious negative consequences for himself and his company. 
We have drawn that conclusion on the basis of the high volume and the specific types 
of deceptive behaviors exhibited by Sullivan during the course of the interview.
-44- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (5) 


9. Ray Cotton 
– No company serious about compliance would hire (and twice promote) 


someone like Ray Cotton to be Senior Vice President, Chief Compliance and 
Sustainability Officer. 


– He's totally unqualified for the job: his LinkedIn profile reveals a college 
degree from an online, for-profit school followed by plenty of job hopping (10 
jobs at seven employers from October 2000 to the present), every one of 
which was related to either "security" or "loss prevention".  


– He appears to have no prior experience whatsoever related to his most 
important areas of responsibility at Lumber Liquidators: quality control, 
sourcing, managing suppliers in China, overseeing the testing program, etc.  


– In summary, Ray Cotton is exactly the person I think a company would hire if 
it was knowingly sourcing tainted product and didn't want the head of 
compliance to know about it (though I suspect he knew). 


– PS: I hear he's one of Lynch's guys, so he'll likely be following him out the 
door very shortly.
-45- 


Nine Reasons Why I Think They Knew (6) 


9. More on Ray Cotton 
– He doesn't appear to be a serious person, as evidenced by his personal home page and 


Twitter feed, which border on comical and bizarre 
• He's taken both down since I started writing about them, but I saved screenshots. 


– He was tweeting from the Oscars on the morning of Wednesday, February 25th at the 
very moment that LL was reporting: a) terrible earnings; b) the Department of Justice 
might be bringing criminal charges against it for violations of the Lacey Act (for buying 
and importing hardwoods illegally harvested in Siberia); and c) 60 Minutes was running a 
negative story a few days later – all of which crushed the stock 26% that day.

Why Did They Do It? 


• Why would they do something so immoral and potentially destructive? 
The oldest reason in the universe: greed.  


• Prior to the 60 Minutes story, Chinese-made laminate, one of the 
company's most profitable product lines, accounted for 14% of Lumber 
Liquidators' sales and this was. 


• Non-CARB-compliant laminate is ~10% cheaper, so the company saved 
a lot of money on sourcing costs, not a few pennies, as founder, 
Chairman and new CEO Tom Sullivan claims. 


• This was a meaningful contributor to a quick doubling of margins, which 
in turn helped send the stock price up eight times from $15 to $119 in 
less than two years.  


• Sullivan and Lynch recognized a golden opportunity when they saw it, 
dumping $37 million worth of stock at prices more than triple today's level 
in early- to mid- 2013 (Sullivan: $26.7 million; Lynch: $10.6 million).

Formaldehyde Causes Numerous Adverse 
Health Effects 


• The National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
say that formaldehyde can cause "watery eyes; burning sensations in the eyes, 
nose, and throat; coughing; wheezing; nausea; and skin irritation," "upper 
respiratory tract irritation (that) can potentially exacerbate asthma symptoms and 
other respiratory illnesses," "chronic runny nose, chronic bronchitis, and 
obstructive lung disease," and is a "known human carcinogen" associated with 
"several cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia."

it nicely:

It's Easy to Find LL Customers Suffering Symptoms 
Consistent With Formaldehyde Exposure (1) 


• I just wanted to thank you for your work on Lumber Liquidators. My wife and I put 
the St James Vintners Reserve (a Chinese-made laminate) in our house back in 
May 2013. We have a 7-month-old who had basically been sick his whole life with 
all the symptoms caused by formaldehyde poisoning (asthma, rashes, upper resp. 
infections, daily breathing treatments, constant wheezing) and we (including the 
pediatricians, who were trying everything) for the longest time could not figure out 
what was wrong with him until we saw the airing of 60 Minutes. We got our things 
and got out of our house while we could figure out what steps to do next. During the 
time out of the house (little over a month) my son started almost immediately doing 
better as did my wife, me and our little girl. 


• …our dogs have developed allergies and my youngest daughter who will be 4 in 
August has been running fever like an off and on switch every few weeks she runs a 
high fever for a couple of days then she's OK until the next episode. I'm not sure if 
this has to do with the flooring. I'm almost speechless on one hand I want to rip the 
floor out on the other we don't have the money to put flooring back in...So at this 
point I'm not sure what to do. 


• I had head and chest congestion the whole time we were installing the floor. My 
friends teased me that maybe I was allergic to the floor. I was at the doctors so

finished putting down the floor. But I still use an inhaler when I exercise.

It's Easy to Find LL Customers Suffering Symptoms 
Consistent With Formaldehyde Exposure (2) 


• My symptoms are burning eyes and nose and coughing up phlem at night. Also 
have itchy skin. My two dogs also cough. I thought they had kennel cough, but now 
think it is the flooring… Open your windows and air the place out frequently, 
especially before bed. Then pray this gets settled soon as I read that the off 
gassing can last 10 years. 


• I was doing some reading of scientific papers on this formaldehyde effects, 
wondering two things. 1. Could my tremors that I have had for the past few month 
be related to this? Sadly, yes. It also cause neurological damage. 2. How long does 
outgasing go on with a product like laminate flooring. Bad news again. It was 
estimated to be in the 10 year range. 


• …we have had boughts of sore throays, burning eyes and my son and I always 
have stuffy, runny noses. 


• …the itching was so sever I literally had scratches all over my body – it was 
insane… 


• …my husband…has had MAJOR skin issues… 
• …our children and dogs and I have had multiple issues… 
• My husband has had major skin issues since installation (he installed it). 
• We both have runny noses and burning eyes.

Formaldehyde Isn't Asbestos, However 


• The levels of formaldehyde Lumber Liquidators' customers are being 
exposed to are likely causing a range of adverse health effects, some 
even debilitating and requiring medical attention, with possible long-
lasting effects. 


• There are three mitigating factors, however:  
a) Formaldehyde, at the levels and length of exposure at issue here, is unlikely 


to cause cancer;  
b) The most common symptoms can be caused by many things, not just 


formaldehyde, so in court the company will surely claim other causes for its 
customers' ailments; and  


c) Formaldehyde dissipates ("off-gasses") in 3-10 months. 
• For these three reasons, Lumber Liquidators' problem, while serious, isn't as 


serious as asbestos because:  
a) Exposure to asbestos can cause a much more serious illness: 


mesothelioma, an often-deadly form of cancer;  
b) Asbestos exposure is pretty much the only way to get mesothelioma; and,  
c) Asbestos doesn't off-gas in the environment, nor does it dissipate in the 


body.
-51- 


But This Doesn't Mean Lumber Liquidators 
Is Off the Hook 


• The fact that formaldehyde isn't as serious as asbestos is great news for 
Lumber Liquidators and its customers and installers, but it doesn't mean 
the company is off the hook.  


• Many, many people – perhaps tens of thousands, maybe more – have 
likely been harmed and suffered adverse health effects, ranging from 
unpleasant to debilitating. 


• But in one critical way, things may be much worse for Lumber Liquidators 
than for the companies associated with asbestos: 


– Asbestos wasn't known to be a dangerous product when most of these 
companies were mining, using and/or installing it, so they could honestly claim 
that they had no idea they were endangering their employees and customers. 


– In contrast, I think it's highly likely that the senior managers of Lumber 
Liquidators knew that they were buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-
CARB compliant laminate from their Chinese suppliers, knowingly putting 
untold numbers of American families at risk.

Lumber Liquidators' Defense – MDF Cores 
Are Compliant (1) 


• As part of its first web site responding to the crisis (since removed), LL 
showed this chart of test results of the MDF cores it claims were used to 
make its laminate flooring: 



http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/10/saupload_witney1.png
-53- 


Lumber Liquidators' Defense – MDF Cores 
Are Compliant (2) 


• Based on my conversations with a number of experts, it's not possible for 
formaldehyde levels of the finished product that 60 Minutes, Drury and I all 
independently tested to be as high as they were – 6-7 times CARB2 limits – if the 
MDF cores had low levels of formaldehyde. 


• Thus, either the test results are bogus or, more likely, the MDF tested (and shown 
to be compliant) wasn’t what was used to produce the laminate LL bought.  


• It would be very easy for the Chinese laminate mills to cheat. They produce both 
CARB-compliant and non-CARB-compliant laminate, depending on customers’ 
wishes, so they could simply produce the latter for Lumber Liquidators (using 
cheap, non-CARB-compliant MDF), while providing the company with the 
documentation it desired showing CARB2 compliance.  


• The mills may also be using corrupt and/or conflicted inspectors. An industry insider 
with first-hand knowledge of many mills that Lumber Liquidators buys from told me: 


"What even LL does not know is their own QC (quality control) inspector is paid a 
commission by the factories. This inspector knows there's no way to make CARB2-
compliant product at the prices LL demands, especially after he takes his cut of the 
price." 


• I have no way to verify this statement, but: a) I believe the person is credible; and 
b) It's consistent with what I know about China – namely, that creating phony 
documents is very common.

Lumber Liquidators' Defense – Its Finished 
Product Is Compliant (1) 


• LL also showed this chart of test results of the finished product: 



http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/10/saupload_witney2.png
-55- 


Lumber Liquidators' Defense – Its Finished 
Product Is Compliant (2) 


• The problem with this test is that Lumber Liquidators didn't “deconstruct” 
the finished product (i.e., sand off the veneer/outer layer). 


• The formaldehyde is in the MDF and resins used to make the laminate, 
so it’s mostly sealed in by the veneer. 


• Thus, testing how much formaldehyde is emitted by the laminate sample 
without deconstruction (especially when the sides and back of the sample 
are sealed) will of course show minimal levels of formaldehyde. 


• CARB was aware of this when developing its testing methodologies and 
standards. It set a standard based on the formaldehyde in the MDF, so 
naturally it requires deconstruction prior to testing finished product. 


• Lumber Liquidators says: "60 Minutes used a 'deconstructive test,' which 
would be like testing the emissions of a car by removing the catalytic 
converter and muffler." 


• This is a spurious analogy. A correct one would be if the emissions 
standard for cars was set by regulators based on a test in which the 
catalytic converter and muffler were removed, and then a company 
rigged the test by not removing them – and then (falsely) reported that its 
cars met the standard.
-56- 


More on Deconstruction (1) 


• Lumber Liquidators says that "CARB has indicated to us that no one in 
the industry is required to conduct deconstructive testing for compliance 
purposes." 


• This is a typical statement from Lumber Liquidators: true but highly 
misleading and disingenuous.  


• It's true that CARB does not require testing finished products – only the 
MDF core prior to being processed into laminate. 


• But many companies that sell laminate (including Lumber Liquidators), to 
their credit, test the finished product for the logical reason that, especially 
when you're dealing with Chinese manufacturers, it's important to trust 
but verify. 


• However, if testing of finished product is done, CARB clearly specifies 
that it must first be deconstructed.
-57- 


More on Deconstruction (2) 


• While plenty of people and companies (including, of course, Lumber 
Liquidators) question whether this is the right way to do the testing, 
there's no question that CARB requires it – it's under the frequently asked 
questions section of its web site (emphasis added): 


42. How will CARB test pre-assembled case goods made of composite wood 
products (e.g., a small table) that are painted, with no edges unsealed?  


CARB will purchase case goods, deconstruct them, remove the paint, and 
test the exposed composite wood product surface using our enforcement test 
method. CARB staff has developed the sample preparation protocol to be 
followed to remove the layer of paint or laminate, and then will determine if the 
composite wood product in the case good complies with applicable standards 
or not. 


• Contrary to Lumber Liquidators' claims, deconstruction isn't a new or 
unproven test method. Rather, it was developed over several years, with 
industry consultation and peer review, and was finally published in 2013.
-58- 


More on Deconstruction (3) 


• CARB's Final Statement of Reasons (FSOR) on page 42 states: 
Agency Response [24-Landry-070423-CWIC]: Yes it is correct that finished 
products must be deconstructed to test for compliance. But, we disagree that there 
is great uncertainty in the enforcement program. Deconstructive testing is needed 
for finished goods to verify compliance with the emission standards. 


• And on page 231 states: 
Agency Response [20.4-Bradway-080215-Mannington]: …To determine if 
compliant materials are being used to make finished goods, we must deconstruct 
the finished good and test its component parts... 


• To summarize, the regulation and the official legislative history make clear 
that finished composite wood products should be tested through 
deconstructive testing and that CARB would be developing a sample 
preparation method for such testing. That method is the SOP (Standard 
Operating Procedures), an official CARB agency guidance document that is 
consistent with the regulation and therefore has the force of law and is 
entitled to deference. Lumber Liquidators' argument that the SOP is to be 
ignored makes no sense and ignores black-letter legal principles. Instead, 
the SOP is an official CARB agency document entitled to great deference.
-59- 


More on Deconstruction (4) 


• Kip Howlett, the President of HPVA, which operates HPVA Laboratories, 
a CARB-certified lab that I hired to test samples of Lumber Liquidators' 
products, said: 


“CARB has an SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) where you take the 
surface layer off to test the formaldehyde level in the core. So when you have 
five labs follow the SOP and remove the surface layer – and all show levels of 
formaldehyde higher than the CARB2 standard, you have a problem. And 
when it's 1,000% higher, you have a big problem! 


When you have five labs all doing it the same way and getting the same 
results, it isn't about the test method. The company either didn't understand 
the SOP, or did understand it and did a work-around. They're either stupid or 
they're lying – which is it? 


Another problem they have is that if you stamp the box “CARB2 compliant”, 
you had damn well better be CARB2 compliant. 


It's telling that the American-made laminate was all compliant, but every 
sample from China wasn't. The Chinese producers are completely and totally 
unfairly competing with American and Canadian companies who abide by the 
law and produce safe laminate.”
-60- 


Another Type of Test: “Exposure Scenario” 


• Rather than testing samples in a lab, what most people really care about 
is how much formaldehyde people are actually exposed to. 


• To measure this, one must use an “exposure scenario” test, which follows 
rigorous protocols established by the California Department of Public 
Health (CDPH), including making assumptions that are widely accepted 
and scientifically based regarding various factors such as the 
temperature, humidity and air circulation in the home.  


• This "exposure scenario" test is what the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission is doing. 


• Lumber Liquidators claims that its tests "measure a product according to 
how it is actually used by consumers,“ which at first glance might lead 
one to conclude that it’s done exposure scenario tests, but in fact it hasn’t 
(or at least hasn’t disclosed this). Rather, this is the company’s way of 
saying it doesn’t deconstruct its samples prior to doing chamber tests.
-61- 


Dr. Philip Landrigan's Comments on the 
Exposure Scenario Test Results 


• 60 Minutes commissioned three exposure scenario tests of samples of 
Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-made laminate, which showed formaldehyde 
levels of 57, 93 and 268 ppb.  


• 60 Minutes showed these test results to Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the 
world's leading experts on formaldehyde and exposure to toxic chemicals, 
and here's what he said: 


Dr. Philip Landrigan: It's not a safe level, it's a level that the US EPA calls 
polluted indoor conditions. 


Anderson Cooper: Would you want that in your home? 


Dr. Philip Landrigan: No. 


Dr. Philip Landrigan of N.Y.'s Mt. Sinai Hospital, specializes in environmental 
pediatrics and exposure to toxic chemicals. He's talking about the results of 
another kind of test Drury and Larson conducted measuring the concentration of 
formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical home. 


Dr. Philip Landrigan: I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky 
because it would increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a 
person's lung function, increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce 
symptoms in everyone but children will be the people most likely to show 
symptoms at that sort of level.
-62- 


There Are Many Sources of Formaldehyde 


• According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Everyone is 
exposed to small amounts of formaldehyde in the air" because 
formaldehyde is found in: 


– Resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products (i.e., hardwood plywood, 
particleboard and medium-density fiberboard) 


– Building materials and insulation 
– Household products such as glues, permanent press fabrics, paints and coatings, 


lacquers and finishes, and paper products 
– Preservatives used in some medicines, cosmetics and other consumer products such as 


dish washing liquids and fabric softeners 
– Fertilizers and pesticides 


• It is a byproduct of combustion and certain other natural processes, and 
so is also found in: 


– Emissions from un-vented, fuel burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space 
heaters 


– Cigarette smoke 


• The primary way you can be exposed to formaldehyde is by breathing air 
containing off-gassed formaldehyde. Everyone is exposed to small 
amounts of formaldehyde in the air that has off-gassed from products, 
including composite wood products.
-63- 


So Why Worry About the Formaldehyde in 
Lumber Liquidators' Flooring? 


• I asked Dr. Philip Landrigan the following question: 
Given all of these sources of formaldehyde, why should anyone be worried 
about a little bit more from Lumber Liquidators' laminate? 


• He replied: 
It all depends on how much someone is exposed to. Substances considered 
toxic are harmless in small doses and, conversely, an ordinarily harmless 
substance can be deadly if over-consumed. 


• Exactly. For all the talk about the many sources of formaldehyde in a 
home, various studies have shown that the average American is 
actually exposed to very low and declining levels of formaldehyde in 
their home.  


• The most recent study found the "mean concentration of 
formaldehyde…in housing of 17 ppb…(and) a mean level of 
formaldehyde for mobile homes or trailers ranging from 15.5 to 24.7 
ppb." (Note that this study is a decade old, so levels are likely even 
lower today.) 


• This trend of declining formaldehyde levels in the average home is a 
testament to the effectiveness of strong environment regulation and is 
great news for American families.
-64- 


Regulators Have Set Various Limits (1) 


• There is no national law setting a limit for formaldehyde in indoor air – 
rather, various regulators have come up with vastly different numbers, as 
this table shows: 


• [1] NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, September 2005 (NIOSH is the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 


• [2] AN UPDATE ON FORMALDEHYDE, 1997 REVISION, U.S. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 
COMMISSION, WASHINGTON, DC 20207 



http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/15/saupload_tilson_1.png
-65- 


Regulators Have Set Various Limits (2) 


In addition, here are three more data points: 
1. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (COEHHA) sets 


formaldehyde limits of 55 micrograms per meter cubed for acute (short-term) 
exposure and 9 micrograms per meter cubed [7 ppb] for 8-hour and chronic 
exposure. 


2. COEHHA, in another document, sets formaldehyde limits of 40 micrograms per 
meter cubed [33 ppb] for "No Significant Risk Levels (NSRLs) for Carcinogens." 


3. The California Air Resource Board (CARB), in a 2004 report entitled 
Formaldehyde in the Home, notes that adverse health effects begin at 40 ppb and, 
in addition, citing a study by COEHHA, concluded that: 


For an eight-hour exposure time, no short-term adverse effects would be expected to occur 
if average levels do not exceed 27 ppb (OEHHA's interim 8-hour REL). 
However, people often spend more than eight hours a day in their homes; infants, young 
children and the infirm sometimes spend virtually the entire day inside their home. Thus, it 
is highly desirable that residential levels remain well below 27 ppb to avoid acute effects in 
such individuals. To avoid irritant effects, air concentrations in new homes, including 
manufactured homes, also should not exceed 27 ppb. 


(Note that a 1991 report by CARB, entitled Formaldehyde in the Home, Indoor Air 
Quality Guideline No. 1 and Supplement, set 100 ppb as an "action level" and 50 
ppb as a "target level," but this has been superseded by the 2004 CARB report.)
-66- 


Regulators Have Set Various Limits (3) 


• To summarize, the seven regulators are all over the map, at 7 ppb at the 
low end and 750 at the high end, as this table shows: 
 
 
 
 
 


 
• Recall that the three samples of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made 


laminate that 60 Minutes had tested came in at 57, 93 and 268 ppb, so 
depending on which standard one uses, one could conclude that the 
laminate is far (8-38 times) above a safe level of 7 ppb – or that's it's well 
below the HUD and OSHA levels. 


• What should we conclude? And, more importantly, after numerous 
federal regulators such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
and EPA finish emissions tests on Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made 
laminate, what are they likely to conclude? 



http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/15/saupload_tilson2.png
-67- 


Regulators Are Likely to Set a National 
Standard at a Low Level (1) 


My view is that regulators are highly likely to set a national standard 
somewhere in the range of the very low levels established by COEHHA, 
CARB, NIOSH and FEMA for six reasons: 
1. The HUD and OSHA standards are very out of date: the former was 


established 30 years ago in 1985 and the latter was last revised 23 years 
ago in 1992. Since then, the science on formaldehyde has improved 
dramatically, and there's now far greater awareness of its dangers (it's 
been established as a known carcinogen, among other things), which are 
reflected in the more recent and much lower levels set by other 
regulators. 


2. The OSHA standard is for a workplace (i.e., adults, eight hours per day) 
whereas, for flooring, regulators will be concerned about babies and 
children in homes pretty much 24/7. 


3. There are five data points between 7 and 33 ppb – and two extreme 
outliers. Where do you think regulators are likely to set the national 
standard?
-68- 


Regulators Are Likely to Set a National 
Standard at a Low Level (2) 


4. Note that the maximum formaldehyde levels in the table above are for all 
formaldehyde in indoor air, not just from flooring, so when regulators set 
a level for flooring only, they are likely to pick an even lower number. 


5. The regulatory agencies looking into this are part of a Democratic 
administration that's been very strong on environmental issues. 


6. Given that there will always be some level of ambiguity – it's not like 
anyone can definitively say "16 ppb is safe, but 17 isn't" – I can't think of 
any reason why an agency charged with protecting consumers would 
want to take any risk. 
My answer: they won't. I think regulators are almost certain to set a 
standard in the 7-33 ppb range (probably much closer to the low end), 
which means all three Lumber Liquidators samples 60 Minutes had 
tested are far out of compliance.  
Assuming the regulators' tests show similar results, it's unclear what 
actions they might take, but I suspect they'll be very onerous for Lumber 
Liquidators – and its stock.

What About Lumber Liquidators' Claim That 97% of Its 
Customers' Homes Have Safe Levels of Formaldehyde? (1)  


• On May 7th, Lumber Liquidators disclosed: 
Initial Indoor Air Quality Testing Program Results 
Initial results of the indoor air quality testing program for certain laminate 
flooring customers – conducted by independent, accredited laboratories – 
indicate that over 97% of customers' homes were within the protective 
guidelines established by the World Health Organization for formaldehyde 
levels in indoor air… 
… While various groups have recommended higher or lower levels, there is 
currently no national standard for recommended indoor home air 
concentrations in the United States. The company has used the guideline 
established by the World Health Organization, which is an international 
consensus standard that draws on recent research and the expertise of the 
many governments, academic institutions and researchers that have studied 
formaldehyde emissions. 


• Phew, we can all breathe a big sigh of relief, right? WRONG!
-70- 


What About Lumber Liquidators' Claim That 97% of Its 
Customers' Homes Have Safe Levels of Formaldehyde? (2)  


These results are meaningless for three reasons: 
1. The testing program, according to expert testimony, is "the cheapest possible way 


to test," "cannot be considered valid" and "will likely provide some consumers with 
poor data that give them a false sense of security." In short, Lumber Liquidators 
has rigged the testing program to show the results it seeks. 


2. For many customers, the formaldehyde will have off-gassed – a process that can 
take anywhere from a few months to a year or two. Thus, even if the testing 
program was rigorous and legitimate, it would show low levels of formaldehyde in 
the air of most customers' homes (I'd guess pretty much all of them who'd installed 
their flooring more than a year ago). But that doesn't mean that they weren't being 
poisoned to a significant degree in the first year or so after the flooring was 
installed. And it certainly doesn't mean that the Chinese-made laminate that 
Lumber Liquidators was selling until very recently is safe – in fact, all of the 
evidence indicates that it's not. 


3. The WHO standard of 81 ppb that Lumber Liquidators chose is among the highest 
of any regulators and is certainly not the appropriate standard for flooring in one's 
home, where babies and children might be playing/crawling on the floor for many 
hours every day. Four different American regulators have set limits for homes 
ranging from 7-33 ppb.
-71- 


What About Lumber Liquidators' Claim That 97% of Its 
Customers' Homes Have Safe Levels of Formaldehyde? (3)  


Here are questions Lumber Liquidators needs to answer: 
1. Why isn't Lumber Liquidators offering customers a professional test conducted by an 


Industrial Hygienist or other accredited technician? 
2. If a homeowner pays for a professional test themselves, will Lumber Liquidators 


honor the results? 
3. What are the results broken down by how recently the flooring has been installed? 


What's the average formaldehyde level for flooring installed in the past month, 3, 6, 
12, 18 and 24+ months? 


4. What were the exact results: how many were below 10 ppb, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, 50-
75, 75-100, 100-200, and 200+? 


5. Why did Lumber Liquidators choose the WHO standard and ignore standards for the 
home set by CARB, FEMA, NIOSH and the California Office of Environmental Health 
Hazard Assessment? 


6. For customers with formaldehyde levels exceeding the WHO standard, Lumber 
Liquidators makes only a vague promise to "take additional steps that may include 
further in-home air testing and testing of floor samples from the customer." Why 
does the company think customers will be satisfied with this lame offer? Why doesn't 
it act with urgency and offer to pay for the family to immediately move out of their 
home if they wish until the flooring can be replaced, and give a full refund?

Thoughts on Lumber Liquidators' Decision to 
Suspend Sales of Chinese-Made Laminate on May 7th 


• I believe that halting sales after selling thousands of American families tens of 
millions of dollars of toxic flooring in the 67 days after the 60 Minutes story aired is 
too little, too late, as the damage has already been done. 


• It likely means that Lumber Liquidators is under immense pressure from 
regulators, who will, I expect, take decisive action to rein in and punish this rogue 
company.  


• I simply don't believe Lumber Liquidators would halt sales of its own volition, given 
that it must now write off ~$13 million of inventory and be out of stock on some of 
this high-margin product for many months, which will seriously impact results for 
the second and third quarters.  


• One source tells me that the decision to halt sales was made by the board, over 
management's objections, which, if true, means that perhaps they kept the board 
in the dark about their nefarious actions. 


• Lumber Liquidators tried to sell all the Chinese-made laminate it could right up until 
the stores closed on May 6th, according to a friend of mine who sent me this email: 


What's amazing is I had heard hints of this and have been calling stores this week. I spoke 
with three stores in Florida and all three told me I could buy the (Chinese-made laminate) 
product on Tuesday or Wednesday, but had to pick it up by Wednesday night. So, they 
were actively selling it while knowing that they were going to pull it. That's a dream for a 
class action attorney...

Implications of Rob Lynch's Sudden and 
Unexpected Resignation (1) 


• I was shocked by this announcement because it undermines all of the 
company's denials.  


• CEOs with nothing to hide don’t suddenly resign and/or companies with 
nothing to hide don’t suddenly fire their CEOs. 


• It is powerful evidence that what I've been saying all along is true: 
Lumber Liquidators has been knowingly poisoning its customers with 
toxic, formaldehyde-drenched laminate flooring and, in general, is a 
notorious bad actor.  


• It's further evidence that Lumber Liquidators is likely under immense 
pressure from regulators. 


• I think Lumber Liquidators' board members are finally waking up to what 
really happened, are rightly panicked about the implications, both for the 
company and their own personal liability, and are seizing control of the 
situation. Thus, Lynch was likely under pressure from the board, saw the 
writing on the wall, and decided to jump before being pushed. 


– I heard from one source that Tom Sullivan blames Lynch for everything that's 
happened and engineered his ouster.
-74- 


Implications of Rob Lynch's Sudden and 
Unexpected Resignation (2) 


• I doubt that Lumber Liquidators was ever a corporate exemplar, but I'm 
not sure that it was always a notorious bad actor. 


• I've heard from numerous people that when Lynch became CEO at the 
beginning of 2012, the company's sourcing and compliance procedures 
as well as how it treated vendors and installers got much worse – all part 
of an effort to increase margins, profitability and, of course, the stock 
price in the short term, long-term consequences be damned. 


• If Lynch was, in fact, a major source of the rot in the company, then his 
departure is good news for Lumber Liquidators and everyone who 
interacts with it, most importantly customers. 


• If the few remaining bulls on this stock are looking for a silver lining to 
Lynch's resignation, this is it.
-75- 


This Isn't a Short-and-Distort Campaign 


• I've spent my entire life building a good reputation. Of course I have an interest in 
making money – that's my job – but the idea that I would destroy my reputation by 
inventing a story to smear an innocent company to benefit a ~3-4% position in my 
portfolio is beyond absurd.  


• It would also be easy for the company to show that I’m lying – and I’d likely end up 
banned from the industry or even in jail. 


• One might not agree with my analysis or conclusions, but know that my beliefs are 
genuinely held. 


• Rather than having a conflict of interest, I believe I have a confluence of interest: in 
speaking out, I am both doing my job and also serving the public interest by warning 
others about the possible dangers posed by certain Lumber Liquidators' products. 


• I find it quite ironic that the company is accusing me of distorting the truth for my 
own financial gain when it is, in fact, the senior executives of the company who 
have far greater incentives to do so than I.  


– This is one of two dozen positions in my fund (only six of which are shorts), so it's not 
going to make or break me one way or another.  


– In contrast, the outcome of this battle means everything to founder and Chairman Tom 
Sullivan and CEO Robert Lynch, both reputationally and financially. Sullivan currently 
owns 608,998 shares – still worth a pretty penny – and both were heavy sellers in mid-
2013, after the stock had soared, pocketing $26.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively.
-76- 


There is No Conspiracy of Short Sellers 


• Contrary to the company's claim that "These attacks are driven by a small 
group of short-selling investors who are working together…", there's no 
such conspiracy (at least to my knowledge).  


• I have no idea who the hedge fund(s) are behind Sunshine Park LLC, nor 
have I met or had any communication with Denny Larson, the executive 
director of Global Community Monitor, or Richard Drury, the prominent 
environmental attorney, both of whom were featured in the 60 Minutes 
story. 


• I can only assume that the hedge fund(s) behind Sunshine Park figured 
out, as I did, that Lumber Liquidators was poisoning its customers, but 
chose a different route than I did to be an activist (by hiring Larson and 
Drury).

It’s Possible But Not Likely That Lumber 
Liquidators Will Go Bankrupt 


• My best guess is that there is a 30% chance of Lumber Liquidators eventually filing 
for bankruptcy. 


• If it happens, it would likely not happen for a while (maybe two years). 
• As of Q1 ‘15 (March 31st), the company had $44 million of cash and only $20 


million of debt, so it has net cash of $24 million. 
• On April 24th, Lumber Liquidators expanded its credit line to $100 million total 


(though no greater than “50% of the cost of eligible inventory…plus 90% of credit 
card transactions which have not settled, less certain reserves”), of which $79.1 
million was available. 


– “The Company has the option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility up to a maximum 
of $175 million subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to such increase specified in 
the Credit Agreement.” 


• The company is consistently cash flow positive: 
– Cash flow from operating activities was $57 million in 2014 vs. cap ex of $71 million (most 


of this was for growth and can be cut) 
– Cash flow from operating activities was $13 million in Q1 ‘15 vs. cap ex of $9 million 


• Only two things could cause a bankruptcy filing: 
1. Sales collapse 20-30% or more and stay depressed (likely due to revelations that the 


company was knowingly poisoning its customers) and the company is forced to slash 
prices to maintain foot traffic, resulting in significant negative cash flows 


2. Costs associated with legal and regulatory action (remediation, penalties, settlements, 
judgements, etc.) swamp the company.

What I Expect to Happen Next 


• I see nothing but bad news emerging for the company over the short-, 


intermediate- and long-term horizons.  


• I think regulators (most likely the California Air Resources Board and the 


Consumer Product Safety Commission) will announce that their tests of 


Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate show the same (very high) 


levels of formaldehyde shown by the tests 60 Minutes, myself and others 


commissioned. 


• At that point, I expect regulators to take strong action against the 


company, including fines/penalties, requiring proper testing, and 


remediation steps. 


• I think that the legal liabilities will be enormous, especially once hard 


evidence emerges that the company was knowingly poisoning its own 


customers. 


– I see the largest legal exposure in two areas: a) damages to customers who 


suffered adverse health effects and b) damages to investors who bought the 


stock at inflated prices based on information (the true source of margin and 


profit expansion) that management knew was false.
