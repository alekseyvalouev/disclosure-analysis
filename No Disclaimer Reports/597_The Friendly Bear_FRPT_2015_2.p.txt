Mold Contamination In Some Freshpet SKUs Introduces Product
Recall Risk

Summary


In recent weeks, we have observed a number of consumer complaints on social
media detailing instances of mold in Freshpet products being sold at retail.


Mold complaints on Facebook have accelerated in recent months and appear to be
popping up across multiple states and across multiple retail chains.


We wanted to verify these claims ourselves, so over the weekend, we visited 10
stores in Kansas City and found 3 stores that were selling moldy Freshpet food.


The moldy products we found were unexpired and unopened, with no discernible
damage to the packaging.


This article contains a number of graphic pictures - viewer discretion is advised.


Since our first article on Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT), the company's stock price has been
on a tear. Based on the stock's current valuation, Freshpet appears to have accomplished
what no refrigerated pet food company in history has accomplished: curing cancer while
simultaneously shifting all of its refrigerators "to the cloud".


One thing that does not appear to be priced into the stock, however, is the risk of a
massive nation-wide product recall as a result of growing signs of potential mold problems
at Freshpet.


For the past several weeks, we have been actively monitoring the Freshpet Facebook
comment board and have found a disturbing pattern of consumers stating that they bought
Freshpet food from the store, only to come home and realize that the food was riddled
with mold. We summarized our findings in this link.


This is an obvious concern for any pet parent given the health concerns associated with
mold in pet food. It is an even more acute concern in the case of Freshpet, given that
the food is stored in consumer refrigerators alongside human food, raising
potential human health and safety issues.

This complaint from April 8, 2015, provides the best summary of the mold concerns we
found in our research:

This concerned pet parent writes:


"I purchased a bag from Publix this past Sunday and this is what I almost fed my
dogs. I've never had an issue until now but am scrolling through and seeing
many others with the same issue. This can harm our animals and I think it
should be addressed asap!!!"


As the concerned pet parent above notes, the issue of mold in the food appears to be
"trending" on Freshpet's Facebook page. In fact, we found over a dozen reports of moldy
Freshpet food. We analyzed the reports, conducted our own primary research (more on

activity has been reported:

As one can see in the map above, reports of mold in Freshpet products have emerged
across the country. Based on our review of the Facebook posts (many of which we have
included later in this article), the complaints also appear to span across multiple retail
chains (including Target (NYSE:TGT), Petco, Publix, and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)).


Mold complaint momentum appears to be accelerating, and the timing of the increase in
complaint activity coincides closely with the timing of the company's November 2014 IPO.
We summarized the recent history of Facebook posts regarding moldy Freshpet products
below:

The company's consumer complaints department appears to have acknowledged the
mold issues through multiple responses on Facebook, generally attributing the mold
issues to damage the packaging may have sustained during shipment.


However, in the April 8, 2015, post, the company had a slightly different response, which
seemed to suggest there is a possibility that there is an issue at its manufacturing facility:


In response to the April 8, 2015, Publix complaint above, Freshpet writes:


"We're really sorry to see this. We are looking into this issue at our Kitchens"


Yet on April 10  2015, when Freshpet broke its IPO lockup almost one month early,
it made no mention of any potential mold issues in its S-1 (we checked).


The company does, however, acknowledge product recalls as a major risk factor. From
the FRPT S-1:

We may be exposed to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals,
and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or if
we are alleged to have mislabeled or misbranded our products or otherwise violated
governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that
we consider below our standards, whether for taste, appearance or otherwise, in
order to protect our brand reputation. Consumer or customer concerns (whether
justified or not) regarding the safety of our products could adversely affect our
business. A product recall or withdrawal could result in substantial and unexpected
expenditures, destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the
unavailability of the product for a period of time, which could reduce profitability and
cash flow. In addition, a product recall or withdrawal may require significant
management attention. Product recalls, product liability claims (even if unmerited or
unsuccessful), or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our
brands with high quality and safe products may also result in adverse publicity, hurt
the value of our brands, lead to a decline in consumer confidence in and demand for
our products, and lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies
of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


We also may be subject to product liability claims and adverse public relations if
consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness. While we
carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all
liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example,
punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. In addition, we may not
be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance, obtain comparable insurance
at a reasonable cost, if at all, or secure additional coverage (which may result in
future product liability claims being uninsured). A product liability judgment against
us or our agreement to settle a product liability claim could also result in substantial
and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce profitability and cash flow. In
addition, even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully
pursued, these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may require
management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business.


As we have seen from the Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) saga, product
contamination claims can be highly problematic for companies and can tie up
resources and require a major investment into PR.

There is no way for us to assess how widespread the mold problems are at Freshpet, and
therefore we cannot conclusively say there is a widespread product contamination issue.
We have compiled a significant amount of anecdotal evidence to suggest that mold has
been appearing in many Freshpet products sitting on shelves. Most concerning to us is
that these products appear to be unexpired and unopened, suggesting that the problem is
not one of poor product handling by pet parents.


Here are some posts (we apologize for the graphic photos) highlighting some of the
complaints we found on Facebook (and note, these are directly from Facebook, with many
of the posters identifying themselves as big fans of Freshpet products).

For those of you who made it this far with your stomach contents still secure -
Congratulations!


And for those who read our last article, you will likely recall that Freshpet's CEO Richard
Thompson actually ate Freshpet food on live TV. We sure hope he didn't get a tummy
ache afterwards!


The Friendly Bear's Channel Checks


Given the sheer volume of consumer complaints we read over the past few weeks, we
decided to conduct our own primary due diligence by taking a look at a few fridges this
past Saturday morning (April 25th, 2015).


The Friendly Bear's busy tour schedule took us to Kansas City, MO over the weekend. We
visited 10 stores over the course of a Saturday morning, and in our travels were amazed
to find that 3 stores carried unopened and unexpired Freshpet product that contained

mold. We closely examined the packaging and could not find any evidence of structural
damage. The mold was readily observable to the naked eye because it was visible
through the transparent portion of the Freshpet packaging, right in the front of the fridges.
While our "n=10" study is clearly statistically insignificant, we were very surprised to find
that it was so easy to stumble upon moldy Freshpet food, with a 30% mold hit rate during
our leisurely Saturday morning channel checks. Mold in pet food can be a major health
concern for pets (see below):

One way to never have a recall is to ignore complaints about mold…


Summary


Freshpet has been written on extensively, so we will keep our closing comments brief. We
simply believe it is prudent for any investor long FRPT to take a deeper look into the mold
complaints.


Given FRPT is a new issuer with under $100M of revenue that just broke its IPO lockup,
any perceived mold issues could be a material headwind for the company.


The Friendly Bear initially intended on putting together a 60 Minutes special regarding the
potential mold issues at Freshpet, but was saddened to discover that during raging bull
markets, bears are not welcome on TV. So, for now, all a friendly bear can do is dream…
