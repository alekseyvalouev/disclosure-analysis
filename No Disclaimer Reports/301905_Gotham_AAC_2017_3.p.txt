GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT: 


 AAC has used 20+ undisclosed related parties & dubious 
accounting to overstate & smoothen profits since 2014.   


 At least 20 undisclosed related party suppliers are owned 
or managed by AAC CEO’s family members or employees. 


 These undisclosed related party suppliers are not listed in 
Apple’s supplier list, despite some claiming otherwise. 


 Some of the undisclosed related entities supply the same 
products as AAC does, are based in the same locations as 
AAC is, & hire employees under AAC’s name. 


 AAC has used these hidden entities to evade Apple’s labor 
standards specified in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct. 


 Apple (and other parties) will conduct independent 
investigations, & validate our findings. As a result, AAC’s 
profit margins will decline, converging to its peers’ levels. 


 AAC is in violation of Hong Kong listing rules, Apple’s 
supplier code of conduct, and its own representations.  


OBSERVATIONS 


 AAC’s China-based subsidiaries’ 2015 operating margins 
are only around 9%, per local filings, compared against 
AAC’s total 2015 operating margins of 30%. 


 There are at least 30 companies listed under CEO father’s 
name, some of which do business with AAC. 


 Companies with more automation should have a higher – 
not lower – average compensation, revenue, & gross profit 
per employee versus peers, according to a Sunwah analyst. 


 AAC has no CFO, & has never addressed whether its 
reporting, financial statement accuracy, & quality of 
internal controls would be affected. 


 Conference call: “At this moment we don’t need a CFO.” 
 AAC CEO’s responsibilities include finance while AAC CEO’s 


wife sits on the audit committee. 
 AAC has not explained how its auditor is able to audit 


AAC’s financial statements with such low audit fees, given 
that AAC’s size would seem to require more billable hours.

PREVIEW OF PART II 


“It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.” – John Maynard Keynes 


In our first full report released last week on AAC Technologies, GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH revealed some 
of the reasons that led us to believe that AAC has used 20+ undisclosed related parties & dubious 
accounting to overstate & smoothen profits since 2014.  Based on how the company and others have 
responded thus far (e.g., some have falsely accused us of fabricating evidence), our confidence in our 
originally stated opinions has increased. Specifically, our core question seems unanswered: Why are AAC’s 
reported profit margins higher AND smoother than Apple’s, since 2014? 


While some have questioned the materiality and/or relevancy of our AAC research, the narrative about 
the company seems to have shifted suddenly from “Gotham’s opinions are groundless and misleading” to 
“Gotham’s findings so far are immaterial and don’t provide sufficient proof.”  


Note that in the case of Quindell, a UK-listed company we researched, Gotham City Research’s main thesis 
– that 42%-80% of Quindell’s profits were suspect – seems to have been proven correct over time. 
Quindell is currently being investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office, and its purchaser’ investment has 
been written down more than £637 million of its value on the basis of fraud. We may not have fully figured 
out all the exact details in our report, and not all our findings may have been directly relevant or material 
to the profit overstatement –  but our overall suspicion of the company’s profits turned out to be correct.  


Similarly, we may not figure out all the exact details as to how AAC’s reported profits margins are higher 
AND smoother than Apple’s – but we have reasons to believe that our core opinions will be validated, 
over time. For example, we intend to address the following question in our coming report: How is it that 
AAC’s listed Chinese subsidiaries’ operating margins appear far lower than AAC the parent company’s 
operating margins (we estimate 9% versus 30%, respectively, for 2015), per local financial reports? 





Consider the following questions as well:  


 If the individuals we’ve identified with the same names as relatives of AAC’s CEO or AAC 
employees are in fact those relatives or employees, are there other undisclosed related parties, 
yet to be revealed, owned &/or managed by AAC employees &/or the CEO’s family members? 


 Are there other means by which AAC’s reported profit margins – since 2014 – may be overstated?

Is this a Smoking Gun? 


AAC Technologies and others critical of Gotham City Research’s work, recently made the following claims: 


 The Company denies all the allegations made against the Company in the Gotham’s May 18 
Report. 


 Shuyang Lisheng is not an undisclosed related party. 


Here are a few questions: 


 If Shuyang Lisheng were described as a subsidiary of a AAC (see the legal document, beginning on 
the next page), would it not complicate the above claims? 


 If Shuyang Lisheng were a subsidiary of AAC, wouldn’t Shuyang Lisheng be a related party of AAC? 


We encourage you to review the AAC legal document we’ve attached (see the next page) titled: 


瑞声科技（沭阳）有限公司与曹晓敏劳动合同纠纷二审民事判决书 


We’ve highlighted – in yellow – the sections we found the most interesting (though the entire filing is 
worth reading, in our view). Who is correct? Come to your own conclusions. Note that this document is a 
sample of what we intend to discuss in our coming report (which we intend to release in the near future).
