Aurora Cannabis is equitizing convertible debt due in four months in a death spiral-
like transaction.


Aurora faces potential of virtually unlimited dilution.


That Aurora, one of the largest and most liquid cannabis companies was unable to
obtain better financing options should signal caution in the cannabis sector.


Based on set-up, stock should fall this week, until the convert is equitized.


On Thursday, November 14, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: NASDAQ:ACB) quietly issued a
press release alongside its earnings release. In the press release, Aurora announced
the equitization of CAD $230M of convertible debt (with an original exercise price now
far out-of-the-money) in a classic "death spiral" structure. The fact that Aurora was
forced into this extremely dilutive option should signal caution in the cannabis sector.

From Investopedia: "A Death Spiral is a term applied to a type of convertible debt that
stimulates an ever-increasing number of shares, leading to steep stock price drops. The
convertible bond, unlike a conventional convertible one, converts into a fixed value
instead of a fixed number of shares. If this bond is converted into stock, the price of the
stock tends to drop due to the increased supply of shares. This, in turn, encourages
more conversion because the convertible debt owners can obtain — and then sell —
even more shares of the stock with the fixed value feature. Theoretically, the death
spiral can end with the stock at or near a zero dollar value."


Management was vague about the true mechanism of the repayment of the 2020
debenture. They pitched it as a measure to "strengthen" the balance sheet, when in fact
it exposes shareholders to the potential of virtually unlimited dilution. While Aurora
shares are down ~30% since the announcement, the potential downside is even lower
given how punitive this repayment structure could be for existing shareholders.


It appears that a few sophisticated hedge funds have negotiated this repayment
structure which allows them to hedge out the debenture without needing to borrow
shares, meaning they can begin selling the approximately 80M shares that would be
needed to hedge the entire $230M debenture issue. Note the 80M shares figure
assumes the share price stays at the current $3 CAD over the next 5 trading days - but
this number could increase significantly if the share price were to drop in a meaningful
way.


The supplemental indenture filing reveals a very deliberate structure that allows holders
to lock in gains by hedging out shares of ACB over the course of this week. The
debenture holders have cleverly negotiated a two-part repayment: the first, based on the
average daily VWAP from November 18 and 19, is paid in shares on November 20. This
is extremely advantageous as it allows the funds to receive shares in a standard T+2
settlement, thus obviating the need to borrow shares. The second part of the repayment
is based on the VWAP over the whole week (November 18 to November 22) and paid in
shares on November 25. The staggered repayments allow holders to begin hedging or
shorting this week without the need for borrow.

It’s a vicious cycle: the lower the price of ACB, the more the debenture holders
need to hedge. The more they hedge, the lower the price goes. The below table
outlines the dilution that ACB will suffer under various price scenarios. All references
below are in CAD.


While the financing structure will be a significant technical headwind into November 25,
shares could find support if the broad cannabis sector experiences a sharp rally or short
squeeze. However, the effects on ACB shares would likely be outweighed by convertible
hedging and additional shorting given the size of the issue and the stock's liquidity.


The takeaway is that there will likely be continued heavy selling pressure on ACB stock
throughout this week as hedge funds who own the 2020 debentures scramble to hedge
out their exposure and lock in gains. Given this, we recommend investors avoid Aurora
stock or reduce their holdings until the convertible is equitized.
