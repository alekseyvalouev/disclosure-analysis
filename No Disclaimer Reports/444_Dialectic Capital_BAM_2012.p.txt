Dialectic Presents The Confusing Case Of Brook�eld Asset
Management


November 21, 2012 12:49 pm  by Tabinda Hussain


ialectic Capital’s latest letter details the performance of the fund in the last quarter, and as


usual, gives a bearish outlook on several sectors and stocks. The Dialectic Antithesis O�shore,


Ltd. is down 7.42 percent for the quarter ending on Sep 30, which is Dialectic’s �rst quarter


for FY2013. To sum up, the fund incurred losses in shorts on China Fraud, European Banks, European


Sovereigns, Canadian Real Estate, and in entities held by Brook�eld Asset Management Inc.


(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A). The negative performance marred Dialectic pro�table short bets in US


�nancials, Technology, Gold, and cyclical stocks. Dialectic is a fundamental based hedge fund with a


unique method of shorting.


Dialectic believes that the technology sector is at the verge of a signi�cant slowdown, as most of the


sectors have become fully saturated and the big techs, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google


Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC),


International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ),


Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), reported quarterly


earnings that missed expectations.


In the tech sector, Dialectic presents its thesis on Tellabs, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLAB). The fund was involved


in activist e�orts with the management of Tellabs, who they believe have a tendency to go for


unnecessary spending and step into areas that the company is not particularly good at. Tellabs has


since appointed a new CFO and CEO, balanced its spending and generated $40 million in cash �ow in


the �rst two quarters. Dialectic expects more growth in the future for Tellabs, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLAB)..


Dialectic calls  Brook�eld Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) the most confusing and


fascinating company that they have ever looked into. BAM’s network expands to nine public equities in


which the company has a controlling stake, this includes shares in General Growth Properties Inc

(NYSE:GGP). One of the inconsistencies that Dialectic noted in BAM’s quarterly earnings report was


how Brook�eld Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) reported gains worth $1 billion from


the acquisition of GGP, when the stock was basically �at after BAM acquired a stake in the company.


At another time, BAM has claimed that the GGP stake was worth $12 billion to BAM, when GGP’s total


market cap is $16 billion (BAM owns 40 percent of GGP). This is where Dialectic ties the link between


BAM’s reluctance to a buyout of GGP by Simon Property Group, Inc (NYSE:SPG) (One has to know about


Bill Ackman’s misgivings about BAM’s intentions and his activism at  General Growth Properties Inc


(NYSE:GGP) to understand the background here). Dialectic suspects that  Brook�eld Asset Management


Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) booked up its position in General Growth Properties Inc (NYSE:GGP),


using some skilled IFRS accounting and are therefore are not accepting an o�er below that mark.


In the investor letter, Dialectic also tries to comprehend what went into General Growth Properties Inc


(NYSE:GGP)’s spin-o� of Rouse Properties Inc (NYSE:RSE). Before the IPO,  Brook�eld Asset


Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) owned 37 percent of RSE and later put up a rights o�ering


at $15, which was above the market price. As rights o�erings are usually below market price, BAM was


able to contribute $170 million out of the total $200 million raised. RSE then transferred $150 million


back to  Brook�eld Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) in a checking account. Dialectic


points out the strangeness of the whole process when BAM is not a bank and RSE is borrowing at


higher interest rate (LIBOR plus 850 bps), but lending or depositing at a far lower rate (LIBOR plus 100


bps), both from the same party, i.e. Brook�eld Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A).


Dialectic also thinks that BAM’s episode of pro�ts in their property investments is nearing the end,


with interest rates near zero, the investments are going to be of less worth going forward.
