Reported Scandal in China Suggests Baidu`s Weak
Corporate Governance


geoinvesting.com/reported-scandal-china-suggests-baidus-weak-corporate-governance/


News regarding a Baidu (BIDU) executive and his potentially undisclosed business
relationship and investment in certain parties related to Baidu is making the rounds in China,
but has not yet been widely disseminated here in the United States.


Multiple news sources in China have reported that Baidu’s VP, Li Mingyuan, “had the whistle
blown” on him regarding “not reporting to Baidu that an external company that he invested in
has business relationship with Baidu”, and that he has already admitted to wrongdoing and
decided to resign. Baidu immediately accepted his resignation. According to the introduction
of the article, Li Mingyuan became a member of Baidu’s highest decision-making committee
in July 2014.


Here are the news stories from Tencent and Sina Finance:

Below is the main content (paraphrased) that Baidu’s Professional Ethical Committee
reportedly sent to its employees, as shown in the news referenced above:

“In an acquisition involved, [Vice President] Li Mingyuan has tremendous amount of
economic relationship with the person in charge of the company acquired [by Baidu]; In
[Baidu’s] business under his management, [Li Mingyuan] has tremendous amount of
economic relationship with the person in charge of a gaming company partner [of
Baidu]. Also Li Mingyuan did not report to Baidu that an external company that he
invested in has business relationship with Baidu. “

Additionally, both Macquarie and Credit Suisse downgraded Baidu to Neutral after the
company reported its Q3 2016 financial results, according to Benzinga.
We will continue to follow this story as it develops in China since the U.S. mainstream media
seems to be unaware of this issue.
