UDC’s Management’s Significant
Misrepresentations of their Past Experience.


Posted on September 9, 2013 by asensio.com


Monday, September 9, 2013.   The CEO and CFO of Universal Display


Corporation (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) have made material


misrepresentations concerning their purported past experience at


InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDCC), based on our review of filings


with the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”).**  What public


records really show is that UDC executives were involved with an


unsuccessful wireless telephone venture that was in operation for


two decades without turning a profit.  This business, International


Mobile Machines Corporation (“IMM”), was on the verge of


bankruptcy by the time of the departure of the individuals who


were later involved in UDC.


Recently, at the Oppenheimer Technology Conference on August


14th, UDC’s CFO, Sidney Rosenblatt, stated, “The founder of


Universal Display [Sherwin Seligsohn] founded a public company


called Interdigital Communications, IDCC, which is a patent


licensing company in the cellular business.”  Rosenblatt also stated


that he “was actually CFO of that company [IDCC], and the CEO of


Universal [Display] was head of licensing.”  Rosenblatt then stated,


“So, we have had about 35 years experience together working on


filing and obtaining patents and running licensing businesses.” 


However, examination of IDCC’s filings with the SEC shows that


Rosenblatt’s statements are fundamentally inaccurate, based on our


review.


UDC’s CEO, Steve Abramson, is on record making similar remarks –


as far back as December 1998 in an interview with the Wall Street


Transcript – about the UDC executives’ purported involvement


IDCC’s licensing business.  Abramson even claimed that IDCC had


“generated over $200 million in licensing fees” from technology

developed during his time at the company.  Again, we believe that


public SEC filings show these claims to be fundamentally


inaccurate.


We believe that this is an attempt to take credit for the success that


IDCC has had in its licensing business and an attempt to establish


credibility in creating successful patent-licensing ventures.  What


SEC records really show is that UDC executives were involved with


an unsuccessful attempt to develop and market a wireless


telephone system, the “UltraPhone,” at IMM.


Sherwin Seligsohn, UDC’s founder, reportedly started IMM in 1972


and served as chairman of IMM’s board of directors until his


resignation in 1991.  Steve Abramson also left IMM in 1991, having


worked there since 1982.  Sid Rosenblatt worked at IMM from 1982


until 1990.  In nearly two decades of operation under Seligsohn,


IMM failed to achieve significant revenues and only generated


operating losses.  Under Seligsohn, IMM did not have a strategic


focus on, or obtain, patent licensing fees; sales of the UltraPhone


were IMM’s primary source of revenue.


It was only after the departure of Seligsohn, Abramson, and


Rosenblatt that IMM changed its business strategy to focus on


obtaining and licensing patents in the wake of the failing


UltraPhone business.


In 1992, IMM changed its name to InterDigital, and acquired SCS


Mobilecom, Inc. in order to obtain patents and in-process research


and development.  At the same time, sales of the UltraPhone


developed under Seligsohn “began to experience a significant


decline… during 1992,” according to the company’s 1995 10-K.  IDCC
stated in the same 10-K, “Beginning in 1992, competition for sales of


wireless telephone systems intensified… [IDCC] implemented a
strategy during 1993 of negotiation and litigation with certain


entities which it believed were infringing the Company’s patents.” 


IDCC only began to recognize licensing revenue in 1994.


Looking at IDCC as it stands today, it would ridiculous to suggest


that IDCC’s current success is in any way attributable to the pre-


1991 activities of IMM.  According to IDCC’s 2012 10-K, IDCC


employs 172 engineers engaging in on-going R&D efforts; IDCC has


over 1,500 U.S. patents, 190 of which were issued in 2012 alone.  By


contrast, in 1989, IMM disclosed only 21 patents relating to the


UltraPhone that would expire between 1991 and 2006.


We believe that UDC management’s misrepresentations concerning


the success of the IMM venture are indicative of a broader trend of


baseless promotion and a lack of straightforward disclosure,


exemplified with management’s treatment of the UDC contract with
