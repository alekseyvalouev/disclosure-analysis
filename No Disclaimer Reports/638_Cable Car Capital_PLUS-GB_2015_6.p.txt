Plus500′s purported 2010-11 revenue was either generated illegally or
not at all. Inconsistency #8 in Part 4 is significant enough that it deserves its
own post.

Comparison of Group
and Plus500UK
turnover


2010 2011 2012 2013
2013 as
restated


2014


A. Group reported
revenue


24,211 50,028 56,127 115,088 115,088 228,865


B. Plus500UK reported
revenue, translated into
USD


1,553 28,993 44,692 99,864 20,043 40,025


C = A – B. Revenue
generated elsewhere


22,658 21,035 11,435 15,224 95,045 188,840


Plus500UK as % of
Group reported revenue


6.4% 58.0% 79.6% 86.8% 17.4% 17.5% 


D. Stated revenue from
EEA/Gibraltar
customers


18,667 42,874 49,785


E = D – B. Missing
revenue from regulated
customers


17,114 13,881 5,093


Revenues are translated at period average exchange rates. EEA/Gibraltar revenue for 2010-2012 is
based on percentage of Group revenue disclosed in the Admission Document.


There are two important takeaways from the $24.2 and $50.0 million in reported 2010 and 2011
revenues in the Admission Document. The first is that these amounts exceed the revenue reported in
the Plus500UK subsidiary by over $20 million both years (line C). We already know that the
Plus500UK revenue was reported on a gross basis prior to the 2014 report, so any difference must
arise from the Parent or another subsidiary. We know from the Admission Document that Israel
represented a very small proportion of revenue (2%). The Australia and Cyprus regulated subsidiaries
were not yet up and running. Therefore, the remaining revenue must have been generated in other
jurisdictions, where Plus500 was unlicensed.


This may not seem controversial. The Admission Document (p.36) discloses that Plus500 operated
illegally for a period of time:
5/19/2018 Your Capital at Risk Part 6: Unlicensed Activity | Cable Car Capital LLC


http://www.cablecarcapital.com/your-capital-at-risk-part-6/ 3/6


The Group has grown rapidly and as part of this growth has, in the past,
commenced trading in a limited number of jurisdictions where operations
have been found to constitute, or are likely to constitute, an offence and
the penalties (whether civil, criminal, regulatory or other) against the Group
or its directors are unknown.


It seems probable that Plus500′s dormant subsidiary MeVideoCY Ltd. (p.84) was responsible for these
activities. More on this in Part 7.


However, it is not possible to reconcile this $43.7 million of unlicensed, unregulated activity
with the customer domicile disclosures in the Admission Document.


The second important takeaway is in line E of the table. In 2010 and 2011, respectively, the Admission
Document claims that 77.1% and 85.7% of turnover was generated within the EEA and Gibraltar—
under the aegis of the FSA. If the Admission Document is accurate, Plus500 generated $17.1, $13.9,
and $5.1 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012 from UK/European customers without those revenues
flowing through Plus500UK. Did Plus500 conduct unlicensed activity in the EEA even after its
license was obtained in 2010? Alternatively, did the Admission Document misrepresent the
geographic origin of Plus500′s customers? Did it present 2010-11 revenues that were higher than the
company actually earned?





On to Part 7: Or was Plus500 operating an undisclosed subsidiary? –>
