AMPE


Ampio’s sole drug candidate, Ampion, for osteoarthritis of the knee, has a long and
mediocre clinical history.


Competitors, including Flexion and Anika, have shown significantly better efficacy
than Ampion.


Management claims FDA buy-in on its latest trial design, but we find this very
unlikely.


Aggressive communications by the CEO have propped up shares to an
unsustainable valuation.


We believe Ampio will have to run another Phase 3 trial, forcing another
financing. Expect shares to eventually trade below $1 and possibly to lows of last
year ($0.30/share).

Ampio Pharmaceuticals (AMPE) is a biotech currently developing Ampion for the
treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK). Given the
consistently mediocre clinical data Ampion has produced to date, we believe it has
almost no chance of approval. In spite of this, the stock is trading at a valuation implying
success in the form of Ampion's near-term approval or a partnership/buyout at favorable
economics (all of which the CEO has hinted at). We will show that none of these
scenarios makes sense, and that due to the company's dwindling financial reserves, the
stock is significantly overvalued.


Ampio was formed in 2010 when DMI Life Sciences reverse-merged into Chay
Enterprises, a residential real estate company based in Littleton, CO. Current Ampio
CEO Michael Macaluso was a board member of DMI and became Ampio's CEO in
2012.


As described in Ampio's first S-1 registration filing from November 2010, the company's
pipeline initially consisted of four compounds and one device: Optina and Vasaloc were
low-dose formulations of danazol addressing diabetic macular edema and diabetic
neuropathy; Zertane was low dose tramadol (opioid pain medication) repurposed for
premature ejaculation; a machine called Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)
Diagnostic Device measured "oxidative stress and anti-oxidant reserves" in patients;
and Ampion. In 2015, Ampio spun off Zertane and ORP into two separate companies
that eventually reverse merged with Rosewind Corp. and became known as Aytu
BioScience (AYTU).

Ampion: Mediocre Data and Questionable Trial Design


Ampio's pipeline has morphed over the years, and while this is not uncommon for a
small-cap biotech, the pipeline has produced very little value despite an exceptionally
ambitious range of targets. For instance, in addition to its four original drug candidates,
a compound named "NCE001" targeting glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma was
listed on investor presentations beginning in 2012 and prospectus filings as recently as
2016. Ampio has also claimed it was investigating Ampion in more than just
osteoarthritis of the knee. A presentation given at a 2013 sell-side conference lists the
following indications: Crohn's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, allergic rhinitis, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. In a March 2017 conference call, Ampio management
claimed it was developing multiple Ampion delivery formulations for an impressive array
of targets: intravenous (for multiple sclerosis), oral (Crohn's), nebulized (cystic fibrosis,
ALS), eye drops (AMD, dry eye, anterior uveitis) and cream (diabetic neuropathy, pain).
On the same call, Macaluso hinted that Ampion may act "synergistically" in the
treatment of such diseases as ALS, MS, and inclusion body mitosis. Given its small size
and lack of resources, it's hard to believe that any significant development efforts were
made for Ampion in these areas, but if so only OAK and a 15 patient hand study ever
progressed into the clinic. Currently, Ampion for OAK is the only drug in Ampio's pipeline
under development.


Ampion, an intra-articular injection (IAI) whose primary active ingredient,
diketopiperazine, is believed to have anti-inflammatory effects, entered clinical
development for OAK in 2011. In a Phase 1/2 conducted in Australia, the drug was
shown to be safe, and trends towards efficacy were highlighted (we note that Ampion
has shown a benign safety profile comparable to saline in all of its clinical trials). In
2013, the Phase 3 SPRING trial tested two doses (4ml and 10ml) of Ampion vs.
equivalent doses of saline. The primary endpoint was pain reduction measured on a 5-
point scale at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included measures of stiffness, physical
function, and an overall patient assessment of benefit.

Ampio showed a statistically significant reduction in pain at 12 weeks vs. saline. Patients
in the combined 4ml and 10ml arms showed mean pain reduction of 0.93 vs. 0.72 for
control arms (42% and 32% from baseline levels of 2.2 and 2.3). Ampion also achieved
statistical success in several secondary endpoints. However, a closer look at the data
reveals two issues. First, the saline arm shows a trend towards pain improvement until
week 10, then an abrupt reversal in pain improvement to week 12. If not for this
unexplained change in trend, Ampion would have scored only marginally better (if at all)
on an absolute basis and missed the primary endpoint (Figure 1). Additionally, there is
very little difference in efficacy between 4ml Ampion and 10ml saline - except for the
abrupt shift over the last 2 weeks (Figure 2). Ampio said it chose to move forward with
4ml Ampion since there was little difference between doses, but it may be worth
investigating 10ml saline as well, given its relative performance.

A closer examination of the data and comparison with other approved OAK treatments
is beyond the scope of this article, but we include tables (Figures 3 and 4) comparing
data from the Phase 3 of ZILRETTA (FX006) an IAI approved last year for all stages of
OAK owned by Flexion (FLXN). We also include placebo-adjusted pain improvement
from the first Phase 3 of Cingal, an OAK IAI being developed by Anika (ANIK). While we
acknowledge Ampion's Phase 3 included more advanced OAK patients and cross-trial
comparisons are difficult, both drugs show significantly greater placebo-adjusted efficacy
than Ampion. We'd also note that both Flexion and Anika Phase 3 trials included
placebo (saline) and active comparator arms - corticosteroid (TCA) for Flexion and
hyaluronic acid (HA) in Anika's case. Ampion is equivalent or worse than these SOC
comparators, even with the help of the anomaly seen during the last two weeks of
SPRING. Finally, we'd compare the steady performance in the saline arms of both trials
vs. what was seen in weeks 10 through 12 of Ampion's SPRING (Figure 5 and 6):

Despite what we view as mediocre and questionable data, the FDA accepted SPRING
as adequate for 1 of 2 trials to support a BLA and even granted a Special Protocol
Assessment (SPA). Ampio shared the following guidance from the FDA:

"This recommendation is based on the fact that [SPRING] was adequate (n=329) and
well controlled (normal saline), the trial conduct was acceptable and the study met its
primary endpoint…".


"FDA recommends that Ampio conduct an adequately powered study to confirm the
effect size of [SPRING] and design the study to obtain information on the duration of
action and repeat dosing."


In adherence with the SPA Ampio designed PIVOT noting this would be its "final pivotal
trial". A total of 480 patients were randomized between Ampion and saline arms. The
primary endpoint was change on the same 5-point pain scale relative to control.
Secondary endpoints were similar to the SPRING trial. Unfortunately, PIVOT failed to
achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint (we don't know how Ampion
fared on the secondary endpoints since Ampio hasn't shared that information). Ampio
asked the FDA to consider an approval filing, but the agency requested additional
clinical work. So, in March 2017 Ampio announced it would conduct another "final
pivotal trial" (AP-003-C), implying it was designed in conjunction with FDA. AP-003-C
would focus only on the most advanced OAK patients.


A total of 168 patients with severe OAK were randomized to Ampion or saline at a 6:1
ratio. The primary endpoint was percentage of responders defined by a composite index
of pain and function. Success would be judged against a benchmark of 30%, which
Ampio claimed was set by physicians and industry experts as clinically meaningful.
However - and this is key - only patients receiving Ampion would be evaluated for a
response! Last December, the company reported the trial met its primary endpoint.


Ampio has claimed this trial was designed in compliance with FDA requirements but we
believe that's unlikely for several reasons:


In a conference call (time 51:00), Macaluso said the FDA presented nine trial options
for this Phase 3. This trial wasn't one those nine options


1.


The trial was relatively small with n = 168. The FDA considered PIVOT, with almost
500 participants, as "adequate" under the SPA. It's unlikely the FDA would consider a
trial with less than half that number as adequate


2.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4149652-ampio-pharmaceuticals-overhyped-and-undercapitalized?source=all_articles_title 10/16


Where's The BLA?


An arbitrary response rate of 30% is unlikely to be considered an appropriate
benchmark by FDA. Placebo response rates in OAK trials are typically above this
level. In fact, in a pooled analysis of severe OAK patients in Ampio's own trials, saline
showed a response rate above 50%


3.


The trial was inadequately blinded. It's very possible that investigator bias affected
data collection as patients on saline were not evaluated for response


4.


The trial was not well-controlled. Because Ampio did not measure for response rates
in the saline arm, there is no way to ensure that participants in the treatment arm
weren't violating protocol and enhancing their pain relief. In fact, Macaluso brazenly
admitted he didn't care (time 50:30) if trial participants were violating protocol by
taking opioids because only Ampion patients would be evaluated


5.


(Note: We asked Ampio management for comment on our questions regarding AP-003-
C and the degree to which FDA was in agreement with its design but have received no
response.)


For these reasons, we believe the data from the latest trial are unreliable and will be
viewed by prospective partners, acquirers, and the FDA as inadequate for a BLA filing.
Additionally, conducting such a poorly controlled trial while at the same time
incredulously claiming the FDA was in agreement with its design damages
management's credibility and could prevent any potential partners from engaging with
Ampio.


Why wouldn't Ampio simply run one of the FDA's nine trial options? We believe it's
because Ampio knew the probability of success in all of those options was low. It's also
likely that all of the FDA options were significantly larger than Ampio's eventual design,
thus costing significantly more in time and cash. As far as we know, Ampio hasn't
released the full data set from the failed PIVOT trial, but given what has transpired since
then, it's logical to assume Ampion performed very poorly relative to saline. It's possible
the data was similar to what was seen in SPRING except the anomaly we previously
noted in the saline arm didn't occur again.

We believe Ampio chose to run a small, poorly controlled trial to help its stock price and
perhaps attract an acquirer or partner to join them in financing a larger, more credible
Phase 3. A company slide deck titled "Confidential Management Presentation" indicates
that Ampio's real intention was to conduct a trial assured of technical success but of little
informational value to the FDA or prudent investors. On one slide (Figure 7) Ampio
predicts a 99% chance of AP-003-C meeting its primary endpoint proving that the
arbitrary 30% benchmark was ridiculously low. We ask investors to consider how the
FDA would view such a statement by company management.


Figure 7.

Also, notice in the same slide, Ampio implies the 30% responder rate is adequate for
"BLA approval" (we have found no evidence of this). However, in a conference call
reviewing the results, Macaluso said they wouldn't be filing a BLA at that time. This is
very curious since Ampio has been claiming it would file a BLA "soon" as early as 2012
as shown in the following links:

April 2012 - "We believe Ampion could be on market as early as 2013"


Dec. 2013 - "File BLA 3Q 2014"


Jan. 2014 - "Potential BLA filing Q4-2104"; "Company is now funded through Ampion
BLA filing and Ampion US Phase III Final Pivotal Trial"


June 2014 - "BLA submission following Q3 STEP data"


Sept. 2014 - "BLA filing anticipated Q1/Q2 2015"


Aug. 2016 - "…there are no issues that will prevent filing of an Ampion BLA"


March 2017 - "About 6 months away from having our BLA committed, maybe 7 or 8, but
this year…"


Sept. 2017 - "BLA exclusivity [beginning] 2H18"


Now with "positive results" from a trial supposedly designed in conjunction with the FDA,
Ampio decides against filing for approval? Ampion's explanation during the call was
noteworthy: the pharmaceutical company buying them would want to control the BLA
themselves. During the same conference call, Macaluso said respected research firms
were valuing Ampio in the "10-figure range" and claimed he had meetings scheduled
with over 50 pharmaceutical companies to negotiate a partnership and/or a buyout. He
also told listeners to expect partnership or buyout news within 30-60 days (note the 60th
day passed on February 12th).

Where does Ampio go from here?


To review: Ampio conducts a trial without a concurrently investigated control arm,
assigns an absurdly easy benchmark, implies FDA buy-in with this design, declares
success and suggests a near-term buyout or partnership at valuations 400% above
where it was trading at the time. To help convince investors, Macaluso has implied the
FDA is willing to be lenient with trial standards and will expedite a review, claiming
(minute 20) and implying on numerous occasions the agency has given Ampion and/or
severe OAK an "unmet medical need designation". However, we are fairly certain that
no such designation exists. The FDA does give out Fast Track designation to "facilitate
the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an
unmet medical need" but Ampion has not been awarded Fast Track even though in
March 2017 Macaluso said they requested it. Note: We asked Ampio management if
they have received an "unmet medical need designation" for Ampio or if the FDA has
conferred it upon severe OAK. We have not received a response.


Such aggressive claims and inconsistencies raise serious concerns regarding the
credibility of management. A search through Ampio's history reveals a consistent record
of unsubstantiated and unfulfilled claims. A few quotes from Macaluso during a March
2014 conference call (starting around minute 35) sound identical to the story that Ampio
is currently pushing:


"This is the year we will file for our BLA…"


"We've been in [buyout and partnering] discussions for quite some time..."


"The answer to the question, "Have we received offers?" Of course..."


"Best time to do a deal might be in a few months..."


For the reasons discussed above (inadequate data, poor management credibility), we
don't believe Ampio will be bought out nor find a partner. In this case, Ampio may
announce it will file a BLA on its own, requesting a pre-BLA meeting to begin the
process (even though any filing will almost certainly be rejected, and we believe Ampio
management knows this). In this scenario, we believe investors would be disappointed
in a no buyout/partnership outcome and shares could trade sharply lower possibly near

Valuation


Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


However, recall Ampio has been claiming it will file a BLA "soon" since at least 2012. We
believe Ampio will most likely revert back to old habits, again postpone a BLA and
attempt another "final pivotal trial" (third "final"). This will require a financing as Ampio
will only have around $1.5m in net cash by end 1Q18. Adding in potential warrant
conversions helps: warrants outstanding at the end of 3Q17 totaled 17.5m with a
weighted average exercise price of $0.73. A best-case scenario where all of them
convert adds $12.8m in cash giving Ampio a total of $14m. A more realistic scenario
would be around 50% of warrants convert resulting in an end of quarter cash balance of
approximately $8m.


In order to consider an Ampion BLA, we believe the FDA would require a trial similar to
PIVOT which took at least 15 months to complete. Total costs were approximately $27m
(Ampio's rough burn during that period). So, Ampio would have to tap markets for
another $20m just to complete another trial. It's hard to imagine investors buying into
such an offering above $0.875 (price of its October 2017 secondary) as current
investors will feel stung by management's unfulfilled promises of a BLA, partnership or
buyout. It's also very possible that class action lawsuits would swarm Ampio and find
success given the CEO's aggressive communications. Ampio management has already
been sued for misrepresenting information in the past, settling one class action lawsuit
just last year for $3.4m.


Ampio's fully diluted share count totals roughly 100.7m (includes 7.3m options and
17.5m warrants). The current share price near $3 equates to a market capitalization
over $300m and an enterprise value near that. Compare this to Anika: trading at an EV
of roughly $740m, the company reported $84m in revenue and $24m in net income over
the first nine months of 2017 while also developing a pipeline of several HA drugs.
Flexion trading at an EV of approximately $760m recently announced the commercial
availability of ZILRETTA across all OAK severity levels and has a pipeline of several
compounds and OA indications. It's difficult to justify Ampio trading at around 40% of
these companies' valuations with little cash, no revenue, no pipeline and a very low
probability of near-term approval of its sole drug.
