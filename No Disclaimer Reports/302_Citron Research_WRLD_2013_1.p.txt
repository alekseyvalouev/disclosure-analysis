No other Citron story has generated as much reader interest over time 
as World Acceptance Corp.  (NASDAQ:WRLD)   Citron initially 
examined WRLD in May 2009, documenting how the company 
systematically abuses the economically disadvantaged with its 
egregious and downright sleazy lending tactics.  The stock was $20, 
and the economy was on the ropes.   
 
Citron thought the US government would inevitably intervene to 
protect consumers.  Obviously, consumer protection has been slower 
than we expected.  Today WRLD’s book of sub-sub-sub-prime 
consumer loans has swollen to $1.1 billion, the stock perched at $90, 
and its day of reckoning may have just arrived.   
 
An outstanding piece of journalism, just published by Pulitzer Prize 
winning ProPublica, which has no dog in the fight with regard to the 
stock or the market, has served up World Acceptance on a silver 
platter to the enforcers at the CFPB.   They convincingly document 
how WRLD is engaged in systematic fraud by forcing unsuspecting 
customers to buy credit insurance.  
 


   Credit Insurance:  the Triggering Event 
 
The CFPB has already acted decisively against the deceptive sales 
practices of credit insurance: its first two enforcement actions were 
against credit card lenders Capital One and Discover -- over exactly the 
same issue.   
 
It does not take much imagination to conclude that WRLD’s days of 
jamming customers with credit insurance are about to come to an 
end.

Credit insurance is a huge driver of profits at WRLD, but just how 
much?  Citron estimates that it could be as high as 50% of net 
income.  In contrast to the large credit card issuers already sanctioned 
by CFPB, for whom credit insurance represents a small ladle of gravy, 
more than half of WRLD’s profits are likely to evaporate once the 
CFPB gets involved.  Citron challenges readers to identify another 
public company with more exposure to this sleazy product.   
 
There are two components of profits from credit insurance:  
 


1. WRLD directly books an insurance commission for placing the 
insurance with Life of the South (part of the public company 
Fortegra, ticker: FRF).  Life of the South is WRLD’s sole insurance 
partner.  WRLD’s last 10-K discloses insurance commission 
revenue of $47m.  It is safe to assume that most or all of this 
revenue falls to the bottom line.  After deducting WRLD’s 37% 
tax rate, $30m, exactly 30% of WRLD’s $101m net income flows 
right to the bottom line from credit insurance.   


 
2. WRLD also lends to borrowers the extra money to pay the 


insurance premium, so it is earning interest income for financing 
the premium.  Here we have to do a little algebra.   


 
We know from Fortegra’s 10-K that it pays out a 64% 
commission rate – in other words, 64% of the insurance 
premiums it receives are paid out as commissions to lenders like 
WRLD.  So, we can divide WRLD’s commission revenue by the 
commission rate to back into the amount of premium it is 
financing: $47m of commissions divided by a 64% commission 
rate equals $74m in premiums.  WRLD average interest rate on 
its loan portfolio is 64%.  So, 64% multiplied by $74m in financed 
premium is $47m in interest income.  After tax, that’s $30m of 
net income, or another 30% of net income.  So, that’s how we 
estimate that WRLD earns more than half its net income from

credit insurance. 
 
Furthermore, ProPublica’s investigation also illustrates how WRLD’s 
loan portfolio is an uncollectable house of cards.  WRLD systematically 
refinances delinquent borrowers in a large scale charade of “extend-
and-pretend”.  According to ProPublica’s reporting, 30% of loans are 
delinquent at the end of each month.  Rather than book loan losses, 
WRLD continues to “flip” loans to these customers to “buy 
time.”  Somehow WRLD still reports that only 2.5% of its customers 
are delinquent. 
  
WRLD trades at 12x earnings and 3x book value.  Both earnings and 
book value are based on perpetuating fraudulent business practices, 
and the CFPB could pull the plug on WRLD anytime. 
 


   The Inside Scoop 
While the regulatory threat gathers, insiders have sold $36m of stock 
in the last 3 years, $12m in the last 12 months, and $6m just this year, 
all while buying back stock to leverage the company and hit EPS 
targets. 
 
The CEO has $9m of restricted stock that vests based on hitting EPS 
growth targets in the mid-teens % range.   In the last two years, they 
have bought back $322m of stock and the increased debt by 
$213m.    Last quarter net income grew by 1% but EPS grew by 19% 
because of the buybacks.  They have to do buybacks to achieve their 
mid-teens EPS growth targets.

  Conclusion 
 
Consider the abject uncollectability of virtually all of WRLD’s entire 
loan portfolio.  Consider how World is financed by JP Morgan and 
Wells Fargo, who wouldn’t think of putting in banks and extending 
normal bank lending to World’s customer base.   And consider half 
their revenue coming from an income boosting deception that two 
major credit card companies have already been clobbered over.  
 
World Acceptance is a one-of-a-kind:  a true sub-sub-sub-prime 
investment.
