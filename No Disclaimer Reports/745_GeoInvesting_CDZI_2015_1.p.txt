We Think Cadiz’s Equity Is
100% Worthless And
Shareholders Will Drown
Under Its “Water Project”
October 8, 2015 By GeoTeam


Summary


A letter on October 5th from the California State
Office of the Bureau of Land Management continues to
paint a bleak picture for CDZI’s focus – its ongoing
“water project”.
This reconciles with, and further validates, past critical
articles suggesting that the project is doomed for
eventual failure and, as such, the company may be as
well.
On top of its main business operation looking like an
impossibility, CDZI faces a major liquidity crisis and
has enormous debt coming due.
As it stands, CDZI’s balance sheet is insolvent and the
company’s equity is worth $0 dollars on paper with
seemingly no future road toward profitability or cash
generation.
Without steady profits, we value CDZI at what it’s
worth on paper and believe it’s is on its way to $0, be
it from bankruptcy, eventual dilution or other means.


The short case on Cadiz Inc. (NASDAQ:CDZI) is centered
on two damning points: the company’s main business
project (a water project focused on relocating water from
an aquifer in the Mojave Desert) seems doomed for
imminent failure and, in the meantime, CDZI has an

insolvent balance sheet and has posted a loss the last 42
quarters straight.


The fact is that the company is essentially a one trick pony
and has been working on the same “water project,” as they
call it, for years, with very little tangible progress being
made on the necessary regulatory front, while enriching
insiders and burning through millions of dollars. The
project’s recent resurgence, seemingly the only reason to
potentially buy the stock, has been called, “the latest
version of a proposal that’s been floating around for more
than 15 years.”


Or, as the LA Times put it yesterday, “Cadiz was the
brainchild of an investment promoter named Keith
Brackpool, who came to the U.S. after pleading guilty to
criminal charges relating to securities trading in Britain.”


This project was the one potential success story the
company had and was dealt a massive blow just days ago
that we think will be extremely detrimental to the
company. Don’t take our word for it – the company has
even stated themselves, in their 10-Q, that their ability
repay their debt and remain liquid depends on the success
of this project.


While this has been ongoing, CDZI has been looting its
balance sheet andlosing money quarter after quarter, for
years.


It has been argued exhaustively that CDZI’s water project
has been, and will continue to be, a complete failure. For
those unfamiliar with CDZI, this project represents just
about all of the future prospects that investors are
seemingly betting on when they are buying CDZI
stock. This detailed and lengthy take down of the
company’s water project, published in April 2015 by The
Pump Stopper, is a must read as a pre-requisite for those

reading this article and looking to familiarize themselves
with the criticism surrounding CDZI.


Today, we take the next step in identifying what we believe
to be an extremely promising short case against CDZI.
Since the water project has been opined on at length,
we’re only going to look at recent developments from the
California State Bureau of Land Management and how they
seem to validate past reports. Finally, we’re going to take a
look at the company’s alarming liquidity crunch, insolvent
balance sheet and perpetual cash burn.


Recent Regulatory Correspondence
Confirms Short Thesis


The latest, and arguably the most threatening roadblock
the company has faced is in a letter they received from the
US Department of the Interior in early October. The letter
notifies the company that it would not be allowed to use a
loophole that the company was seeking to use in order to
move its water pipeline project forward (“cannot be
authorized”).


The letter cites not just one issue with the company’s plan,
but rathernumerous issues that it takes exception with:


1. the water conveyance pipeline
2. the fire suppression system
3. an access road
4. power lines
5. the excursion train


The letter makes it abundantly clear that CDZI is not
furthering a railroad purpose, mentioning those words
specifically numerous times.

The request was seeking to package CDZI’s water pipeline
project in with late 1800’s railroad regulations that allowed
usage of public land relatively freely for those looking to
further a “railroad purpose”.


This KCET report states:


Cadiz had argued that its proposed 43-mile
pipeline along the right-of-way of the Arizona
California Railroad (AZCR) would have
augmented the safety of railroad operations, by
providing water for firefighting along the
railroad’s right of way through one of the least-
vegetated sections of the Mojave, as well as
drinking and cooling water for possible passenger
excursions. If that argument had flown, Cadiz
could have taken advantage of a loophole of
sorts that would have exempted the pipeline —
and thus the whole project — from federal
environmental review. Cadiz is asking that the
determination by California BLM chief Jim Kenna
be reviewed by Kenna’s boss, BLM Director Neil
Kornze, but the chances that Kornze would
countermand Kenna’s call are slender.


Veteran Southern California water wonks will be
well acquainted with Cadiz: it’s the latest version
of a proposal to mine the aquifer in the Cadiz and
Fenner valleys south of the Mojave National
Preserve that’s been floating around for
more than 15 years. When first floated in the
early months of the 21st Century, the Cadiz
project would have provided 50,000 acre-feet a
year to the Metropolitan Water District.


The company’s plan was to tuck its pipeline into this
exception, as this would be a way around Federal Review of

the company’s project, which we’re guessing the
company does not want to happen, as it has been called a
death sentence for the project by the Pump Stopper
(http://pumpstopper.com) (“already effectively failed
Federal Review”, “project failure and bankruptcy”)
and here (“may kill the project”).


This is important because this exemption was seemingly
the only back ended way that the company could conceive
of getting approval for its project. It has widely been
regarded that if the company needs to seek a federal
review, the project might as well be considered dead.


As the KCET report puts it succinctly, again,


In essence, the seemingly minor “administrative
determination” means the company will likely
have to put its project through a full federal
environmental review if it’s going to
proceed. And that meansfederal hydrologists
will cast a critical eye on the company’s
claims, and that may kill the project.


This is the stage the company is at now. We think this
project, and CDZI, are as dead as a doornail.


The has a very slim “hail mary” chance of getting the BLM
to overturn the appeal, as it says in the letter that it’s not
technically final – but we believe the issues that would
have to be addressed in order to make such an appeal
worthwhile are far beyond the realm of what is possible at
this point in CDZI’s lifecycle. In another “bullish scenario”,
the company may have to tack many additional years onto
its timeline while somehow dodging bankruptcy. At the
worst, the end appears to be very near. We believe the
Board of Directors needs to look very carefully at the best
options for CDZI and its creditors at this point.

The company’s method of disclosing this recent letter is
also interesting. The company’s disclosure methods
surrounding this project had been in question for some
time in prior critical articles. Adding to that contention, we
would like to review the crux of the letter that the company
saw and compare that with the headline that the company
put out to investors.


Here is what the company saw in the letter:


And here is what they handed investors:


Guidance? Yes, they were “guided” that their project “could
not be approved”.


And this isn’t the first time the company’s disclosures have
been in question. Asecurities fraud suit claiming the
company misrepresented its business practices surfaced in
2015.


In addition to the interesting disclosure, the company filed
two Form 4’s during the middle of the trading day and one
at 4PM on that the day the letter was disclosed. These may

or may not have helped steady the stock price. However,
once investors dug into these Form 4’s, it was clear that
only one – the one filed after 4PM EST – was an open
market buy.


The other two Form 4’s looked like this one:


It also probably doesn’t help the cause that after the
regulatory letter was issued, the CEO took to Twitter to call
the regulators “dumb” and “stupid”.

Among other reasons (the big one being that CDZI’s
project doesn’t further a “railroad purpose” – kind of
obvious), the government and the company seem to have
big trouble seeing eye to eye when it comes to the science
behind this project. CDZI’s science, not surprisingly, falls in
their favor. For instance, look at the difference in opinion
when it comes to the projects touted “fire suppression”
benefits.


Lest we also not forget back in 2000, when geologists took
a look at the data the company was using to try and
further its project, a scathing report was issued to the

company noting numerous flaws. We believe there is an
extremely low chance that the company receives approval
through a federal approval process. Government geologists
don’t seem to be on the side of the company, and have
repeatedly assessed that the company’s plan to use a
desert aquifer as “seriously flawed”.


Here’s an excerpt from the brutal assessment that was
issued to the company back in 2000.


You can find a link to the National Parks Service geological
assessment here.


The project is seemingly so unviable, it’s bringing
politicians together from across the aisle. This is from a

A Republican congressman who represents the
northern Mojave Desert has asked the federal
government to launch a full-fledged
environmental review of Cadiz Inc.’s proposed
groundwater pumping project.


The request by U.S. Rep. Paul Cook (R-Yucca
Valley) joins a similar one made last year by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), making a rare
show of bipartisan unity on a publics lands
issue.


The same Senator, Dianne Feinstein violently opposed the
project in 2014 where she, “inserted a rider into a
budget bill that bars the Department of the Interior
from spending any money this fiscal year on
reviewing the project for permits. ‘Severely drawing
down the aquifer could damage that region of the Mojave
Desert beyond repair,’ she wrote in an e-mail. ‘The bottom
line is that right now we need more responsibility in how
we use our water, not less,'” she said, according to a 2014
Bloomberg article.


A Massive Liquidity Concern, Major
Risk for Shareholders


CDZI has, on the other hand, done some things well over
the last few years: issuing shares, for instance. Here’s the
company’s ballooning share count, up more than 50%
since 2006. We expect this trend to continue further as the
debt laden company has narrowing choices aside from
issuing equity if they want to keep “operations” going.

The company’s cash flow tells the story of the coming dire
need for cash. In the last 6 months, the company has
burned $5.3 million in cash (silver lining: down from $6.5
million the year prior!). At this rate, the company is going
to face some cash problems within a quarter or two and we
expect further financing, should the Board allow this
company to continue as is.


The company generates minimal revenue, and has survived
over the last 10 to 15 years by taking on lower and lower
quality debt while plundering the balance sheet, resulting
in negative equity for shareholders. All the while, insiders
have been paid handsomely and the company continues to
bet its future on a project that does not seem viable.


Here is what the Board is allowing company executives to

could be steamed into a latte in a Malibu café or
blasted through a car wash in downtown San
Diego.


The project has the potential to make the
company and its shareholders serious money, if
they can make it happen.


Two hundred miles from Cadiz, in the San Diego
suburb of Kearny Mesa, sits one public agency
that has the power to bring this desert water
west. The San Diego County Water Authority is
charged with securing freshwater supplies for
San Diego in the coming decades. It sets policy,
makes deals and can generally tighten or loosen
the spigot on the county’s water supply.


One of the Water Authority’s advisers is attorney
Christine Frahm. A former chair of the authority’s
board, Frahm has been heavily involved in local
water policy for years, and currently works for
the agency as an attorney and consultant.


While she’s been advising the Water Authority,
and at least one other local public
agency, Frahm’s firm has built a significant
financial relationship with Cadiz Inc. Another
shareholder at the firm where she works,
Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Scott S. Slater,
was named Cadiz’s CEO in February, and the firm
recently signed a contract thatpromises it
hundreds of thousands of shares in Cadiz as
its project gets closer to completion.


Take a look at an agreement from 2013 between CDZI and
the firm Slater is “shareholder” of (link to full
agreement here).

5/23/2018 We Think Cadiz's Equity Is 100% Worthless And Shareholders Will Drown Under Its "Water Project" | GeoInvesting

Here’s a line from the full agreement that states CDZI’s
CEO can work for Brownstein in other matters:


In addition, according to this May 2015 S-3,
it appears these “terms of engagement” still stand.


But it’s the liquidation section of Cadiz’s company’s filings
that really tell the tale of just how distressed that company
is. This section clearly states the company’s capital needs
are only good until February of 2016, and that the
company has $36.2 million in debt coming due in March of
2016. It also says its liquidity “depends on its progress
toward implementation of [the water project].” This is the
same project that appears to be in jeopardy of imminent
failure.

The company continues by stating that it could default in
March of 2016 due to this debt. (click to enlarge)


Here is a look at the company’s debt that’s current, and
coming due – adding up, with other liabilities, to total
liabilities of $113.03 million.


And here is a chart showing exactly how the company has
plundered and incapacitated its balance sheet over the last
9 years.

We Value the Company at $0


It is not in GeoInvesting’s nature to be sensational. We
don’t call companies frauds when they make “material
misstatements” and we only assign price targets that we
think are fair and worked out through real world valuation
scenarios. It is rare that we assign $0 price targets to
companies that are not simply outright frauds. CDZI is an
exception to this rule.


Put simply, with an $80 million dollar market cap, we think
the company is about $80 million overpriced.


We believe that shares are on their way to zero and the
only question is when this will happen, and by what means.
We can safely and fairly conclude that this company will
eventually asymptote toward zero, whether it’s from toxic
debt or plain old bankruptcy. While we cannot predict how
long the company can issue shares and move forward to
prolong their existence, what we can predict is that it is
likely going to be detrimental to shareholders. As such, we
are short CDZI.


Investors in this company need to consider several things.
The first is that they need to consider that the company
has an enormous amount of debt coming due in the

beginning of 2016 that they cannot pay as they currently
stand. Second, they need to consider that the company is
burning about $10 million in cash per year which, without
considering their debt, gives them roughly another 2 to 3
quarters to operate. Lastly, investors need to realize that
there is no more room for give on the company’s balance
sheet and that any financing moving forward is likely to be
extremely toxic, resulting in the issuance of even more
shares potentially coupled with warrants and other
instruments that could further dilute the company.


We have already seen some of this take effect, as we have
seen the company increase its share account significantly
over the last 10 years.


This note from the 10-Q gives us insight into the fully
diluted share count, which is actually more than 26 million
shares.


Taking into account the company’s fully diluted share
account of about 26 million, an investor would note that
the companies actually been assigned a market cap of
almost $100 million, and that, again is $100 million too
much.


With what we believe to be no viable projects in the
pipeline, we think Cadiz’s equity is worthless.
