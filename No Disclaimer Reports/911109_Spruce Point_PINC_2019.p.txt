Executive Summary

Short PINC: Spruce Point Sees 55%-75% 
Downside To $8-$15 Per Share


• Unique Pre-IPO Restructuring Skews Company Economics: Premier was mutually owned by its member owner hospitals prior to its 2013 IPO. To free up cash for Premier 
to invest in ancillary services, these hospitals agreed to accept sharebacks of 30% – less than half the market rate of 60-75% – in exchange for equity in Premier and 
modest tax-related distributions. These agreements were structured to last only five or seven years. While most member owners signed to five-year deals renewed their 
agreements on similar terms, they most likely did so to avoid having to forfeit their as-yet unvested equity (~30% of their respective equity allocations at the time). 
Premier’s two largest GPO members, whose seven-year contracts expire on Oct 1, 2020, will have no unvested equity remaining by the time their deals are scheduled to 
expire, and therefore have far greater incentive not to renew their Premier-friendly deals on the Oct 1, 2019 opt-out deadline. As admin fees carry 100% incremental 
margins, changes in net admin fees have an overwhelming impact on Premier’s bottom line. The loss of Premier’s two largest GPO members or the restructuring of their 
agreements could cut Premier’s FY21 EBITDA by 9-17%.


• Increased Shareback Could Be Highly Material To Hospitals With Expiring Deals: Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Premier’s largest GPO member and a 
10% Premier customer, is one of the hospitals whose contract is set to auto-renew next week. By analyzing tax filings, Spruce Point has found that, by receiving a market-
rate shareback, GNYHA’s total income could increase by 33%. We believe that GNYHA may have a responsibility to its member hospitals to seek sharebacks more in-line 
with market rates, and anticipate that it may not renew its current agreement.


• More Opt-Outs Likely To Follow: Member owners which renewed their five-year agreements in Oct 2017 can opt out once again as soon as Oct 1, 2020 (effective Oct 1, 
2021) without losing unvested equity. Should all member owners receive market-rate sharebacks of 60-75%, Premier’s FY22-23 EBITDA would be cut by more than half.


• Complacent Sell-Side Assumes Favorable Economics Can Last Forever: Premier’s ~95% renewal rate during its 2017 renewal cycle appears to have convinced the sell side 
that renewal risk is near-nonexistent. It ignores the fact that, unlike the 2017 renewal class, member owners whose contracts are due to auto-renew next week will have 
no remaining unvested Premier shares, and will therefore no longer have to accept below-market sharebacks for access to Premier equity. Analysts also appear to 
underestimate the prevailing market shareback rate by benchmarking against MedAssets. MedAssets, a GPO which was until recently public, reported superficially below-
average sharebacks due to its practice of bundling GPO agreements with ancillary services. Our market intel confirms that the market-level shareback is 60-75% and rising.


• Emerging Signs That Hospitals Are Prepared To Exit: Member owners are divesting of Class B shares at an accelerating pace, perhaps reflecting their knowledge that 
Premier’s economics are set to correct in the near future. Large hospitals such as Johns Hopkins Medicine have already exited, sacrificing some of their unvested Class B 
shares to do so. New language introduced in Premier’s most recent 10-K (filed Aug 2019) suggests that renewal risk is rising.


• PINC Shares Valued As Though Current Economics Are Sustainable: PINC trades at a 6.6x FY22 EV/EBITDA multiple based on the sell-side’s inflated future earnings 
estimates. Reverting member owner hospitals to sustainable market-level sharebacks would cut consensus FY22 EBITDA in half. PINC should also trade at a lower EBITDA 
multiple, as Premier’s true underlying economics are worse than the market believes. Valuing PINC shares at 4-5x FY22 EBITDA on an estimate of EBITDA >50% below the 
Street would imply that PINC shares are worth $8-$15, 55%-75% below current levels. Losing hospitals to competing GPOs could result in even more downside.


Premier, Inc. (“PINC” or “the Company”) is a group purchasing organization (GPO) which, due to a unique pre-IPO restructuring agreement, is 
temporarily generating twice the earnings which its business model can sustain organically. In exchange for rights to Premier equity, its “member 
owner” hospitals agreed to five or seven-year contracts through which they would accept administrative fee rebates (“sharebacks”) roughly half 


what they could get from competing GPOs. Those contracts are nearing expiration. Complacent sell side analysts, satisfied by Premier’s historical 
renewal rates among member owner hospitals accepting below-market sharebacks, forecast Premier earnings as though its prevailing economics 
are sustainable in perpetuity. However, with most member owner equity now having vested, hospitals with expiring contracts are far less incented 
to remain with Premier at sub-market shareback rates. Premier’s two largest members, whose below-market contracts are set to auto-renew on Oct 
1, 2019, could announce their intention to opt out by next week (effective Oct 1, 2020), with remaining member owners set to announce the same as 
soon as Oct 1, 2020 (effective Oct 1, 2021). This would cause Premier to underperform FY22-23 consensus revenue by >26% and EBITDA by >50%.

Case Study: Premier Closely Mirrors Spruce 
Point’s Successful Call On 2U


Spruce Point believes that the circumstances facing Premier are extremely similar to those faced by education technology provider 2U (NASDAQ: 
TWOU) through 2018-19. In July 2018, Spruce Point published a “Strong Sell” recommendation on 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU) which showed that 
the company’s tuition “take rate” (i.e. revenue share) on its online degree programs was under significant pressure: while 2U claimed historical 
take rates of over 60%, our FOIA requests demonstrated that intense competition had brought the market rate down to ~40%. Sell-side analysts 


nonetheless continued to assume that 2U could maintain its historical take rate until only recently, when management admitted on its Q2 
earnings call that its core business was under fundamental pressure. The stock fell more than 60% the following day. Spruce Point believes that 
the circumstances facing Premier are very similar: while the sell side believes that Premier’s above-market shareback rates can last indefinitely 
into the future, Spruce Point finds evidence that near-term catalysts could force Company economics back in-line with the rest of the market.


• 2U take rate under heavy pressure with 
intensifying competition


• Margin pressure with continued shift 
towards short-course programs


• Sell side inappropriately modeling 2U 
economics as though historical margins 
were sustainable


“…we’re adjusting our executional model against 
the dynamic of this mainstreaming of online

A Brief Primer On GPO Economics


As a group-purchasing organization (GPO), Premier secures vendor discounts for its hospital members through the force of their collective 
purchasing power: per its 10-K, Premier represents more than 4,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems and over 175,000 other organizations as a 


GPO. As do other GPOs, Premier also generates revenue of its own by charging vendors an “administrative fee” of roughly 1.0% to 3.0% on 
product purchases. After returning a percentage of these fees to member hospitals as a “shareback,” or revenue sharing payment, the remainder 


is retained as GPO revenue. Premier also generates revenue through various other channels, including supply chain management, SaaS 
informatics offerings, and other consulting services (and, until recently, specialty pharmacy). Even then, following the recent divestiture of its 
specialty pharmacy business, administrative fees represent Premier’s most significant source of revenue by a meaningful margin, driving over 


50% of sales ex-specialty pharmacy.

Premier’s Pre-IPO Sharebacks At Parity With 
Market Rates


Before going public, Premier offered its member hospitals administrative fee sharebacks which, according to our research, were generally in-line 
with the industry’s market rate of 60-70%. Prior to the IPO, Premier’s non-owner member hospitals were repaid ~66% of the gross admin fees 


collected on their purchases made through the GPO. Meanwhile, Premier’s “member owner” hospitals – the hospitals which collectively owned 
the Company prior to its IPO – did not receive formal sharebacks, but were nonetheless paid a share of Company income specifically constructed 


to approximate 70% of the gross admin fees collected on their own purchases, thus putting them in line with market shareback rates.

Pre-IPO Reorganization And Shareback 
Reduction


Upon modifying its ownership structure in advance of its IPO, Premier struck five-year (and two seven-year) deals with its member owners, 
structured to facilitate its expansion into adjacent business lines. To free up capital for Premier to reinvest in itself and further grow the business, 
member owners agreed to take a reduced 30% shareback of Premier’s gross admin fees through the life of these contracts. In exchange, member 


owners were granted the right to Premier, Inc. Class B shares. One-seventh of each hospital’s Class B shares would then vest (i.e. become 
exchangeable) each year following the reorganization, and the hospital would have the right to exchange them (and their LP units) for publicly-
traded Class A shares. Member owners were also granted additional payments tied to anticipated tax benefits resulting from the reorganization.

Company-Friendly Shareback Shifts GPO 
Economics Dramatically


As admin fees carry 100% incremental margins, changes in net admin fee revenue flow directly to Premier’s bottom line. Accordingly, cutting 
sharebacks to member owners from 60-70% to 30% has a dramatic effect on Company earnings. Setting member owner shareback rates at par 


with non-owner shareback rates would have slashed Premier’s FY19 operating income by a whopping 86%.

Do Sell-Side Analysts Believe Post-IPO 
Economics Will Last Forever?


Sell-side forecasts suggest that analysts see Premier’s unique post-IPO economics lasting indefinitely into the future: revenue, earnings, and EPS 
are all projected to grow steadily through the next several years, with little variation in margins. Recall, however, that its post-IPO contracts 


featuring reduced shareback rates were structured to last only temporarily, for five or seven years (beginning Sep 2013). Industry experts also 
report that, excluding temporary contractual barriers, GPO switching costs are generally not high for hospitals. Is it really reasonable to believe 
that Premier’s drastically off-market economics are sustainable when competing GPOs offer sharebacks at least two times higher on average?

Premier Consensus Estimates


PINC S-1: Aug 26, 2013


Source: Bloomberg


Spruce Point believes that consensus estimates reflect highly unrealistic assumptions regarding the sustainability of Premier’s current economic 
model. If Premier is forced to adopt shareback rates more in-line with industry standards, future sales and earnings performance will diverge 


significantly from current Street projections.


Sell-side analysts see no change in Premier economics despite contractual cliffs

Upcoming Expiry Of Long-Term Contracts 
Could Be The First Crack In The Model


Premier discloses that its two largest member owner hospital groups (GNYHA and Yankee Alliance), which were together responsible for 13% of 
Premier’s gross administrative fees as of FY19, committed to seven-year GPO contracts following the reorganization. These deals are set to 


expire in Oct 2020. Premier’s GPO Participation Agreements state that member owner hospitals can opt out of their deals with one year’s advance 
notice, but that their deals automatically renew under the same terms if they fail to opt out at least one year in advance of their contracts’ expiry 


dates. Accordingly, if these two member owner hospitals fail to opt out by Oct 1, 2019, they will be locked into 30% sharebacks – far below the 60-
70% market rate – for another seven years, until Oct 2027. They would be ineligible to opt-out again until at least Oct 2022 (effective Oct 2023).

Spruce Point believes that there is a high probability that, come next week, these two hospitals will elect not to renew their current terms beyond

Investors Lulled To Sleep By The 2017
Renewal Cycle


Why aren’t analysts or investors showing signs of concern as the opt-out date approaches? Sell-side notes and event transcripts from 
throughout 2017 show that, as the Oct 2017 opt-out date for Premier’s five-year contracts drew near, analysts were in fact very preoccupied with 
renewal risk. Premier’s strong showing during this renewal cycle, however, appears to have put concerns over renewals to bed: ~95% of member


owner hospitals originally signed to five-year deals chose to renew their contracts at the Oct 2017 deadline. Yet analysts forget that member 
owners locked into five-year deals would have had to forfeit unvested Class B shares (which vest, or become exchangeable, ratably over seven 


years) had they cancelled their agreements with Premier in 2018. Member owners originally signed to seven-year contracts, whose Class B equity 
allotments will vest in full on Sep 30, 2020 – one day before their GPO contracts are set to expire – will face no such disincentives to opting out.


PINC S-1: Aug 26, 2013


Upon leaving the Premier GPO, member owner 
hospitals lose their rights to unvested Class B 


shares.

“Redemption Amount” of ~$1.80 per share as of 


FY19 (implied by cash flow statement).

The final tranche of Class B shares is due to 
vest on Sep 30, 2020 – the day before Premier’s 
seven-year contracts expire (perhaps explaining 
why these hospitals haven’t canceled already).

As analysts questioned management on the likelihood of a shareback rerating during the 2017 renewal cycle, management repeatedly claimed 
that its close working relationships with member hospitals and broad offering of ancillary services were enough to convince member owners to 


continue to accept below-market sharebacks. However, industry experts generally see the GPO industry as a highly-competitive one with low 
switching costs and few differentiating factors between individual players. Management plays up its new SaaS services as a meaningful draw, but 
most large GPO offer similar value-added services. Spruce Point believes that, with member owner hospitals accepting lower sharebacks only in 


return for equity in the first place, the decision to renew among member owners on five-year deals was driven primarily by their desire not to 
forfeit the ~30% of their Class B shares which had yet to vest. This disincentive is not present for hospitals due to renew on Oct 1, 2019.

“Susan said on the call that the economics [of the renewed contracts] were similar to prior contracts. I think that's 
the other thing that people are going to really focus on is are the hospitals coming to you and trying to get a 
bigger shareback? So is there any color that you can provide on how things are going on in that front or what 
your expectations are?”


- James Stockton – Wells Fargo


Management Claims


“Yes. I think the expectations are similar. Economics, as has been articulated, again, if the 5-year contracts auto renew, which 
a lot of our organizations have indicated they will just allow them to auto renew, auto renewals are under the same terms that we 
have. So what I would tell you is we're saying similar. And the reason we're using the term similar is in the discussions we're 
having with organizations, there may be discussions about other things, resources, do they need more -- another 
additional system in their institution helping them to drive savings and things of that nature, but the core economics 
around the GPO relationship are not changing as a result of these renewals.”
- Craig McKasson – CFO, Premier


Reality


With their Class B shares scheduled to vest in full on the final day of their current contracts, the hospitals due to renew or opt out on Oct 1, 2019 
have little incentive to continue to accept less than half the shareback dollars that they could receive from another GPO.

Are Analysts Even Aware Of The True Market 
Shareback Rate?


Some analysts appear to underestimate the true market shareback rate, believing it to be closer to 45% than 60-75%. Spruce Point believes that 
this stems from their familiarity with MedAssets, which, when acquired by VHA-UHC Alliance (renamed Vizient shortly thereafter) in late 2015 / 


early 2016, reported a shareback rate of just under 45%. However, MedAssets often bundled its GPO contracts with its software, consulting, and 
other ancillary services, which would result in these hospitals receiving a lower face-value shareback. Premier does not bundle its GPO services 
and ancillary offerings in the same manner. We therefore believe that MedAssets’ historical shareback rates are not comparable to Premier’s on 
an apples-to-apples basis. This is confirmed by the publicly-searchable details of more recent Vizient contracts, which show Vizient – which no 


longer offers bundled pricing on GPO sharebacks – agreeing to sharebacks of 60-75%.

Industry Sources Confirm Market Shareback 
Rate Of 60-75%


Industry experts and published studies confirm that the market shareback rate is in the 60-75% range. Some experts claim to see shareback rates 
as high as 80% in some regions. Importantly, they also believe that Premier will experience extreme pressure to match market rates once member 


owners’ existing deals expire.

Could The Current Fair-Market Shareback Rate 
Be Even Higher?


Through the early 2010s, prior to its acquisition by VHA-UHC Alliance, MedAssets’ management noted that competitive pressures were driving 
industry-wide sharebacks up by 100-200 bps per year. As five years have passed since MedAssets was taken over by Vizient (private), market-rate 
sharebacks could plausibly be 500-1,000 bps higher than they were when MedAssets was acquired in 2014-15, and 600-1,200 bps higher than they 


were when Premier went public in 2013. Extrapolating this pace of shareback expansion forward to 2019 and applying it to a “non-bundled” 
shareback rate would suggest that current market-rate sharebacks could potentially be as high as 65-85%.


“I know we have discussed this in the past, but we do see continued pressure, 
as we said, in the 100-basis-point to 200-basis-point range for the revenue 
share obligation -- that's an industry trend.”
- Haley Wise – Chairman & CEO, MedAssets


“Our gross administrative fees will grow at a faster rate than net admin 
fees, as we forecast increases in our revenue share obligation due to renewal 
pricing, shift of fixed fee to shareback agreements, and the impact of 
performance related fees on the percentage of shareback.”


- Mike Nolte – COO, MedAssets

Maybe the “gradual” increase in MedAssets’ shareback rate wasn’t really so 
gradual on a contract-by-contract basis…


If even MedAssets was offering 60% sharebacks on new contracts shortly 
before being acquired, this is a much better indicator of the market 


shareback rate at that point in time than its aggregate blended shareback.

PINC Class B Share Ownership, GNYHA


GNYHA Not A Natural Fit For Premier


Up for renewal in the current cycle is Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Premier’s largest GPO member by gross purchases and 
the source of over $71M (11%) of Premier’s net administrative fees as of FY18. Industry experts report that GNYHA – with its own sub-GPO under 
Premier – is not a natural fit for Premier’s GPO: Premier works best for mid-sized hospitals and hospital groups which can leverage their software 


and benchmark tools, of which larger hospital groups like GNYHA have their own. With its own captive GPO, GNYHA has significant product 
overlap with Premier and thus may sacrifice value by permitting purchases to go through Premier. Similarly large hospital groups like Johns 


Hopkins Medicine have already left Premier for Vizient – a better steward of large GPO members, per industry experts – even before their Premier 
equity vested in full. We believe that GNYHA’s size and potential conflicts make it a strong candidate for choosing not to renew with Premier.

Increased Shareback A Material Benefit To 
GNYHA


GNYHA’s most recent Form 990 made public by the IRS (2017) reveals that the additional income which it stands to gain by moving to a market-
rate shareback would be a highly material benefit to the organization. Outside of direct income of $17M – mostly from investment income –


GNYHA’s largest source of earnings is its 100% stake in Acurity (formerly GNYHA Services), its captive GPO. Moving to a market-rate shareback 
on its purchases made through Premier would increase Acurity income by close to 30%, and total GNYHA income by 20%. If Acurity could 


eventually bring these purchases entirely in-house, Acurity income would increase by over 50%, and total GNYHA income by 40%.

Class B “Dividends” Not Sufficient To 
Encourage GNYHA To Remain With Premier


When questioned about renewal risk in the past, management cited its tax distributions and TRA as sources of member owner stickiness. As 
discussed, each member owner receives a “tax distribution” covering its pro-rata share of Premier LP tax based on its Class B ownership 


(regardless of whether it is a for-profit hospital and, therefore, whether it pays taxes at all). Each Class B owner is also given a pro-rata share of 
85% of the tax savings realized by Premier due to its change in tax basis stemming from the IPO, per the TRA. Per the LP Agreement, any member 
owner which leaves the Premier GPO not only forfeits unvested Class B shares, but must exchange its vested Class B shares for Class A shares, 
which offer none of the benefits provided by Class B shares. However, Spruce Point estimates that the value of the benefits to Class B ownership 
– which will only fall over time as the 15-year TRA is depleted – pale in comparison to the value of receiving market-rate sharebacks for GNYHA.

While GNYHA receives $7M in various tax-related distributions from Premier on an annual basis through its ownership of Class B shares, it stands to increase its 
administrative fee revenue by close to $40M per year by moving to a market-rate shareback of 66%.


The incentives associated with Class B share ownership are not nearly sufficient to keep GNYHA tied to Premier’s GPO at a 30% shareback rate.

Class B “Dividends” Make Little Difference To 
Hospitals’ GPO Decision


To the extent that member owner hospitals intend to hold their PINC shares, Class B shares offer superior total returns via the tax distribution 
and TRA – returns to which they would lose access if they left the Premier GPO and, in turn, were forced to exchange their Class B shares. Our 


market intelligence indicates that hospitals are nonetheless generally cash-strapped and would prefer to sell their shares rather than receive 
these marginal benefits, as evidenced by aggressive selling by GNYHA and other Class B shareholders. However, if GNYHA did, in fact, intend to 


hold the remainder of its shares, could Premier still get away with offering a shareback rate materially below market due to the added value 
provided by Class B ownership? Spruce Point estimates that, even taking these “dividends” into account – which, again, will only decrease over 


time – Premier would still have to offer GNYHA a shareback of at least ~60% to beat the market shareback rate. Transitioning all owner members a 
shareback rate of 60% would be nearly as destructive as would transitioning them to the non-owner member rate of 66%.

With GNYHA responsible for 10% of total Premier revenue, Spruce Point believes that GNYHA has significant negotiating leverage against 
Premier. By threatening to leave, it could plausibly command a market-rate shareback in addition to any Class B benefits it stands to receive, to 


the extent that it would choose to retain any Class B shares. 


As a group, the wave of hospitals eligible to opt-out in Oct 2020 – collectively responsible for ~80% of Premier net admin fee revenue, per our 
estimates – could wield the same leverage.
21


Aggressive Class B Share Sales By GNYHA Reveal 
Limited Effectiveness Of Ownership Incentives


To an untrained eye, a time series of GNYHA’s Class B share count might seem to suggest that it is divesting of its Class B shares only gradually. 
However, taking its vesting schedule into account paints a different picture. Of its Class B shares which are eligible to be exchanged, GNYHA has 


never held more than ~25% at one time. Put differently: as soon as its Class B shares become eligible for exchange, GNYHA exchanges (and 
inevitably sells) the vast majority of them. In fact, in 2015 and 2016, GNYHA had divested of ~99% of its vested Class B shares. This confirms to 


us that GNYHA is, in fact, an aggressive seller of Class B shares, and that it has little interest in holding its Class B simply for the associated 
distributions. It’s unlikely that these distributions will influence GNYHA to remain a Premier GPO member for the sake of its Class B benefits.

Could GNYHA Leave Premier Even Sooner?


By choosing to opt out of its current deal next week and waiting the required one year to move to a new deal at market-level sharebacks (starting 
Oct 1, 2020), GNYHA would be able to exchange its remaining unvested shares for Class A shares, but its announcement could cause PINC 


shares to fall by 50% or more if analysts update their forward estimates for a likely Company-wide rerating. By instead choosing to renew its deal 
under existing terms, GNYHA might preserve PINC’s share price for a time, but the stock would nonetheless likely fall by a similar amount on Oct 
1, 2020, when the next set of contractual lockups end, but before it can exchange its last tranche for Class A shares. Alternatively, GNYHA could 


choose to leave Premier immediately, foregoing much of the value of its Class B shares, but gaining an extra year of market-level sharebacks. 
Spruce Point finds that it may be in GNYHA’s best interest to leave immediately and forego its final tranche of unvested equity.

The Second Cliff: Two-Year Lockup Ends On 
Renewed Five-Year Contracts


Per Premier’s GPO Participation Agreement, member-owner GPO contracts can be terminated with one year’s prior notice after having been in 
effect for at least two years. Oct 1, 2020 marks the two-year anniversary of the beginning of Premier’s renewed five-year contracts with the 


majority of its member owner hospitals. With the remainder of their unvested Class B shares due to vest on Sep 30, 2020, these hospitals will 
have little incentive to continue to adhere to contracts offering a shareback of only 30% once their renewed five-year deals become eligible for 


cancellation. Spruce Point anticipates that Premier will experience a wave of cancellations and contract restructurings on Oct 1, 2020, and that, as 
of Oct 1, 2021, the vast majority of Premier GPO members will receive sharebacks closer to market rates, whether from Premier itself or 


competing GPOs.


PINC S-1: Aug 26, 2013


By Oct 1, 2021, Premier’s 30% shareback will have largely been phased out, and its blended shareback of ~35% will nearly double to 60-75%.


The economics of the business will look radically different than they do today, and radically different from sell-side projections.

Premier Economics Completely Transform 
Upon Comprehensive FY22 Shareback Rerating


If all of Premier’s member owner hospitals were to demand and receive a market-rate shareback beginning in FY22 – the earliest point at which 
their current terms could be amended – consensus sales estimates for FY22-23 would fall by 26%, and EBITDA estimates would be cut by more 


than half.

With Premier currently structurally overearning the rest of the GPO universe due to its unique post-IPO structure, Company economics will 
inevitably readjust to reflect market-sustainable terms once member owner hospitals are free to demand market-level sharebacks.

Management Tacitly Revealing Cracks In Its 
Most Recent 10-K


While management continues to cite its GPO-related savings as a major force behind hospital member stickiness – improperly, in our view – it 
has increasingly acknowledged that its renewal rates and net administrative fee revenue are at risk to broader industry competition. In fact, 


management made several additions to its most recent 10-K – filed as recently as Aug 16, 2019 – which suggest that its member hospitals are 
pressuring the Company to raise its shareback rate. We are not surprised that management made these additions just as the contracts for its two 


largest member owners approach their respective opt-out dates.


“Pursuant to the terms of GPO participation agreements entered into by the 
member owners (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the 
accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information), 
each of the member owners generally receives revenue share from Premier 
LP equal to 30% of all gross administrative fees collected by Premier LP
based upon purchasing by such member owner's owned, leased, managed and 
affiliated facilities through our GPO supplier contracts….


Subject to certain termination rights, these GPO participation agreements have 
five-year renewable terms, although our two largest regional GPO member 
owners have entered into agreements with seven-year renewable terms. GPO 
participation agreements automatically extend for successive five-year or seven-
year periods (corresponding to the length of their initial terms) unless the 
member owner notifies Premier LP, prior to the fourth anniversary (in the case of 
five-year agreements executed at the time of our IPO), or sixth anniversary (in 
the case of seven-year agreements executed at the time of our IPO), of the 
commencement of the then-current term, that such member owner does not want 
the GPO participation agreement to automatically renew upon the expiration of 
the then-current term.


As of the date of this Annual Report, approximately 96% of our fiscal 2018 
net administrative fees revenue associated with existing members is 
covered by GPO participation agreements that have been renewed or 
extended at the same or similar economics, or initially had terms longer 
than five years. We continue to work with the few remaining member 
owners with initial five-year terms that have not yet renewed or extended 
their GPO participation agreements to achieve renewal or extension of 
those agreements at the same or similar economics on or before 
September 30, 2018.”


PINC FY18 10-K: Redline to FY19 10-K


“Pursuant to the terms of GPO participation agreements entered into by the 
member owners (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the
accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information), 
the overwhelming majority of our member owners currently receive 
revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of all gross administrative 
fees collected by Premier LP based upon purchasing by such member owner's 
owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through our GPO supplier 
contracts….


Due to competitive market conditions, we have experienced, and expect to 
continue to experience requests, at times, to provide existing and 
prospective members increases in revenue share on incremental and/or 
overall purchasing volume. Subject to certain early termination rights, these 
GPO participation agreements generally have five-year renewable terms that 
initially expire on September 30, 2023, although our two largest regional GPO 
member owners have entered into agreements with seven-year renewable terms 
that initially expire on September 30, 2020. In general, our GPO participation 
agreements automatically extend for successive five-year or seven-year periods 
(corresponding to the length of their initial terms) unless the member owner 
notifies Premier LP, prior to the fourth anniversary (or September 30, 2022 in the 
case of five-year agreements), or sixth anniversary (or September 30, 2019 in 
the case of seven-year agreements), of the commencement of the then-current 
term, that such member owner does not want the GPO participation agreement 
to automatically renew upon the expiration of the then-current term.


We are currently working with the member owners with initial seven-year 
terms to achieve renewal or extension of those agreements…. In addition, 
some of our GPO participation agreements with member owners have been 
extended on terms that vary from their original terms.”

Class B Shares as a Percent of Class A and Class B Shares


Member Owner Hospitals Dumping Shares


Some investors believe that member owner hospitals are strongly incented to remain within the Premier GPO network by the Class B share tax 
distributions and TRA payments, which Spruce Point estimates to be worth ~$1.28 per share per year as of FY19, and which member owners 


would lose upon leaving Premier. We have already noted that these benefits are likely small for a given hospital compared to the potential 
benefit of receiving market-rate sharebacks. Indeed, they appear insufficient even to deter hospitals from simply selling their shares. The rapid 


pace of Class B selling among member owner hospitals has only accelerated through the past four quarters, with the Class A share count 
recently having passed the Class B count for the first time since Premier went public in Sep 2013. Our conversations with experts reveal that 
hospitals are generally not cash-rich institutions, and would likely prefer to sell rather than sit on their shares for a small “dividend.” Sales of 


Class B shares should also be interpreted as a form of insider selling, which sends a concerning signal to other Premier investors.


Source: Premier SEC Filings


Note that the pace of Class B sales accelerates each Q1, when another tranche of Class B shares vest. Spruce Point expects sales of Class B 
shares to accelerate once again this quarter – particularly as member owner hospitals, likely aware of the impending risks to Premier’s 


economics, look to reduce their exposure ahead of a seismic shift in earnings. Their understanding of these risks only further disincentivizes 
holding Class B shares, and undercuts the argument that hospitals may wish to remain with Premier to reap the benefits of Class B ownership.

Little Reason For Hospitals To Sit On PINC 
Shares


Spruce Point notes that PINC shares have been a chronic underperformer since the Company’s IPO in Sep 2013, up only 35% since going public –
lagging the XHE, XLV, and XHS since that date. The stock has also performed extremely poorly during the Oct-Dec period on a yearly basis since 
2016, often declining by 20% in this time period. We believe that recent poor performance may reflect broader questions regarding the longevity 


of Premier’s current economics among some investors. Even then, we question why cash-strapped hospitals would choose to remain invested in 
PINC shares in hopes of stronger future performance rather than sell.

Misunderstanding Of Premier’s Economics 
Results In Mispriced Shares


With only half of analysts rating PINC a “buy,” the sell side is not overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, but it nonetheless assigns PINC an 
average price target of $42.76, 26% above current levels. Spruce Point believes that this reflects the sell side’s lack of understanding of the 


business’ true underlying economics: analysts’ price targets reflect a level of earnings power which the Company cannot sustain through the 
long-term. Accordingly, we impute little to no significance to the sell side’s implied upside in PINC shares. Analysts are valuing a business 


which, we believe, will not exist in its current form in three years’ time.

Spruce Point Sees 55-75% Downside In PINC


In a base-case scenario in which member owner sharebacks gradually rerate close to the average market rate, and in which PINC’s FY22 
EV/EBITDA multiple contracts by ~35% as the economics of the business are reset, Spruce Point sees close to 70% downside in PINC shares. We 
believe that PINC shares have anywhere from 55%-75% downside depending on the extent to which the shareback rerates up front. The downside 


could be far worse should PINC lose member hospitals to competing GPOs in addition to having to raise its shareback to member owners.
