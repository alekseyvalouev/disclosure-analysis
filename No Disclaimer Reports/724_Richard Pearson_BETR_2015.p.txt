Amplify Brands: A Busted IPO And A No-Brainer Short
Sep. 24, 2015 9:40 AM ET24 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


IPOâ€™d at $18 with 100% of shares coming from insiders cashing out (company
received no proceeds).


Stock fell immediately and has now fallen by 33%.


Company is saddled with debt and has no cash to conduct acquisitions.


IPO was rushed out due to rapidly falling growth rates and margins.


At least 30-40% further downside.


Company overview


Amplify Brands (NYSE:BETR) is the maker of Skinny Pop popcorn. Skinny Pop is not
intended to be a weight loss item. The term "skinny" simply refers to the fact that it is
simpler, using fewer ingredients. (This article provides a side-by-side comparison of
Skinny Pop vs. key popcorn competitors).


Until April 2015, Skinny Pop was the company's only product. In April, the company
acquired Paqui Tortillas and at that time changed its name to Amplify Brands. However,
given that the acquisition price was a mere $12 million, it is still the case that Amplify
"Brands" is still largely just a one-product company - popcorn.


Amplify came public at a price of $18 in August valuing the popcorn company at over $1.5
billion in enterprise value. But the stock immediately traded down and now trades for
around $12.00, down 33% from the IPO price.


Key statistics are as follows:


Market cap: $900 million


Cash: $17 million


Total debt: $198 million


LTM Rev: $151 million

Background


The IPO of Amplify Brands is proof positive that on Wall Street, anything is possible.


The typical justification for an IPO is that a growth company needs capital to expand. The
IPO brings in that capital, often at a discount to fair value. The share price pops. The
company uses the fresh capital to expand. The share price continues to rise based on
stronger prospects. Voila. Everyone is happy. Capitalism works.


But with the IPO of Amplify Brands, we can see that sometimes a sneaker can slip
through the cracks and the IPO market can just act as a dumping ground for private equity
firms who need to unload one of their portfolio companies as quickly as possible.


TA Associates purchased a 74% stake in Skinny Pop in August of 2014 for just $320
million. Within 8 months (April 2015), the company had already hired Goldman Sachs to
sell the stake to a bidder. However, when no bidder materialized, TA needed an
alternative.


Skinny Pop has taken on nearly $200 million in debt and ended up paying dividends to
shareholders (i.e. including TA Associates) of $80 million. In April, just as TA was
attempting to sell the company, Skinny Pop then acquired a tiny tortilla chip maker for $12
million and changed its name to "Amplify Brands." Now, as a seemingly diversified snack
maker, the company filed for an IPO with Goldman as the underwriter.

The most unusual feature of this offering was that in the IPO, fully 100% of the shares
being offered to the public came from selling shareholders. This means that none of the
proceeds raised are going to the company. In fact, 82% of the shares came straight from
TA.


Clearly, this should be a tough sell. After all, if the insiders are all looking to cash out and
the company doesn't derive any benefit from the IPO, then why should anyone buy it?


There are a few key elements required in order to make such a transaction happen.
Especially when dealing with lofty multiples such as Amplify.


First requirement: the appearance of growth prospects


First off, there needs to be the appearance that there are still substantial growth prospects
ahead for the company. It is plain to see that Skinny Pop has already experienced a surge
in growth. In past years, the company was experiencing triple-digit growth as it expanded
from a presence of just a few thousand stores to its current level of nearly 50,000 stores.
But by now, Skinny Pop has already penetrated the largest grocers and convenience
stores in the country. This includes Sams Club, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), 7 Eleven, Wal-
Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Target (NYSE:TGT).


It is therefore not surprising that growth has declined dramatically, as shown below:


Meanwhile, operating margins have also been cut in half.

These slowing growth rates and falling margins would normally create a major problem for
the IPO.


At an IPO price of $18, Skinny Pop would be coming public with an enterprise value of
over $1.5 billion. That is more than 50% larger than the size of the entire addressable
market for ready-to-eat popcorn in the US (according to Amplify's own IPO prospectus). It
is also a valuation of more than 10x 2014 revenues! So there needed to be something
else to the story.


As a result, in April 2015 (just when TA was trying to find a buyer for Skinny Pop), the
company acquired Paqui Tortillas. The acquisition price was just $12 million, but it served
a much greater purpose.


Skinny Pop could now be marketed to investors as a diversified snack company and the
size of the popcorn market would not be a limiting factor. As a result of this tiny
acquisition, Skinny Pop changed its name to "Amplify Brands" just shortly before the IPO.


Second requirement: selecting the right underwriter


IPOs are supposedly priced for to provide initial buyers with a pop in share price. That is
the way IPOs are supposed to work. But with Amplify, we can see that the stock traded
straight down from the very beginning and has continued to trade off by more than 30%.


Investors were clearly not buying the "diversified snack company" line. Nor were they
buying the hyper growth story.

The question then becomes "if this IPO was so bad, how did it get completed in the first
place."


The fact is that Goldman Sachs brings many very attractive IPO deals to market. If you
play 10 of these deals, you will probably end up making decent money in seven of them.
And in perhaps three of them you will hit some serious home runs. It is worth losing some
money on the occasional bad deal in order to maintain a relationship for future home runs.


As a result, when Goldman launches a "favor deal" like this one, there are no shortage of
investors who will buy a small slug as a favor to Goldman. They then hold for a brief
period and start quietly unloading while they can. This is exactly why the deal never traded
up and exactly why the stock is now down by 30%.


Competition


The bull case on Amplify rests on the assumption that Skinny Pop will be so popular that it
will literally take over the salty snack market and will be the number one Ready-to-Eat
popcorn maker.


But we can already see that there are dozens of competitors out there with a product that
is nearly identical. These products are sold in the same retail outlets and at similar prices
as Skinny Pop.


A list of these competitors can be found on the GoodGuide and it runs 15 pages long with
197 products!

Evaluating Amplify at a price of $12

TA Associates paid $320 million for their 74% stake, valuing the company at $430 million.
That equates to a price of around $5.73 per share for TA.


But it is clear that even at $5.73, TA overpaid substantially. We can see from the above
charts that TA acquired Skinny Pop when growth was still clocking in at 160%. Operating
margins had just declined from 47% to 20% for the first time.


Now we can see that sales growth has plunged to just 33% from 160%, while operating
margins have failed to recover.


At a price of $12.00, Amplify has an enterprise value of around $1.1 billion. That equates
to a whopping 7.3x LTM sales. Amplify is clearly being priced for hyper growth.


To put this in perspective, when TA acquired its stake in the company one year ago, it did
so at a multiple of just 4.5x sales. Since that time, the company has taken on additional
debt while growth has slowed and margins have fallen.


Despite the lofty multiple for Amplify, growth is now expected to fall even further.


On August 31st, the managers and co-managers on the IPO all initiated coverage on the
stock. Not surprisingly, 4 out of 5 of them initiated with a price target of exactly $18 (the
same as the IPO price).


But it is interesting to note that co-bookrunner Credit Suisse initiated with a target price of
just $13.00. The key reason for the low price target is that Credit Suisse feels that the only
way to justify a higher valuation is to attribute value to acquisitions that have not yet
happened. Credit Suisse also assumes that the rate of growth on sales will be
slowing to just 20% by 2018.


Cash, debt and future acquisitions


Because Amplify did not receive any proceeds in the IPO, we are now looking at a $900
million market cap company, which has just $13 million in cash against nearly $200 million
in debt.


Again for perspective, Amplify has $10 million in debt coming due within 12 months and
an additional $14 million in consideration due to founders within 12 months, totaling $24
million against its $13 million in cash.


Credit Suisse has estimated that EBITDA for 2015 will come in at $72.2 million. That puts
Amplify at an EV/EBITDA of more than 15x. This means that Amplify is going to face
limitations on how much it can further borrow.

What all of this means is that Amplify is saddled with debt and has limited cash with which
to conduct acquisitions to achieve required growth.


Conclusion


TA Associates still owns 58% of Amplify. And we have already seen that TA has been in a
rush to sell its stake as quickly as possible. It was only 8 months after the stake was
acquired that TA began shopping it via Goldman Sachs.


TA paid just $5.73 per share for its stake in Amplify. But that is now largely irrelevant. With
the proceeds from the IPO along with its share of $80 million in special dividends, TA has
already received back 100% of its original investment in Amplify. Anything sold from here
on out is pure profit for TA.


As a result, TA's 58% stake in Amplify creates a massive overhang on the stock.


More importantly, we can see from the post IPO trading that the initial IPO buyers have
been slowly bleeding out stock. This was clearly a favor deal for Goldman Sachs, such
that buyers are simply looking to get out of their positions and (hopefully!) lose as little
money as possible.


This steady stream of sellers also creates significant downward pressure on the stock.


When TA acquired its stake at $5.73, Skinny Pop was still posting growth at around 160%
y-o-y. That is largely what justified the premium multiple for the company at the time. But
now growth has plunged to just 30%. This is why TA was in such a rush to sell the
company after just 8 months. (A normal PE holding period would be around 3-7 years.)


As a result, it is tough to say where Amplify will ultimately settle down. But with the
abundance of sellers and little chance of meeting growth estimates, we should see at least
30-40% downside from current prices.
