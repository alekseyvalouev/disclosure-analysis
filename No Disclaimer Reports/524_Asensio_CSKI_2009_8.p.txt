China Sky’s Reported First Quarter Earnings
Only Raise More Questions.


Posted on May 15, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) released first quarter


earnings on May 14. The disclosures made in China Sky’s earnings


announcement and Form 10-Q for the first quarter continue to


underscore the issues raised previously by asensio.com, concerning


margins and inventory levels. China Sky’s disclosures also raise


new questions.


China Sky competes in a mature and highly competitive industry.


China Sky’s claimed results are not comparable with those of the


established industry leaders, which do not have China Sky’s serious


governance and accounting issues.


China Sky continues reporting questionable margins. Gross margin


for the first quarter was 76%, compared to gross margin of 77% in


the first quarter of last year. However, China Sky claimed to


discontinue its “contract sales” entirely, meaning sales of products


manufactured by other companies. These contract sales should


have lower margins than products manufactured by China Sky


directly. According to China Sky’s Form 10-Q, contract sales


decreased from 24% of sales in the first quarter of 2008 to 0% in the


first quarter of 2009. Despite the sharp change in contract sales,


gross margins remained remarkably constant, decreasing only 1%.


An asensio.com report issued on April 20 analyzes CSKI’s margin


reporting.


A report issued by asensio.com on May 5 questioned the low level of


China Sky’s reported inventory relative to sales. At year-end 2008,


China Sky reported having only $55,614 in finished goods inventory,


representing less than one day’s worth of sales. At the end of the


first quarter, reported finished goods inventory was $498,095. This


represents only 7.5 days of sales. By comparison, American Oriental

Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE: AOB), a company very similar to CSKI,


reported having more than $8 million in finished goods inventory


at the end of the first quarter, representing more than 43 days of


sales.


China Sky continues reporting unexplained growth, which is the


subject of an ongoing asensio.com review. In the first quarter,


China Sky’s revenues increased 100% from prior-year period, going


from $12.4 million in 2008 to $24.8 million in 2009. According to


disclosures made in China Sky’s SEC filings, this purported growth


must be organic. China Sky did complete three acquisitions in 2008,


but none of these could have been a major source of revenue


growth. One of the acquired companies, Peng Lai Jin Chuang, had


“dormant operations” until after the acquisition, according to CSKI’s


10-Q. Another, Haina Pharmaceutical, was only acquired for a


distribution license for $437,375. CSKI’s 10-Q actually discloses that


the acquired company “does not have an established sales


network.” The third acquired company only had $2 million in sales


the prior year. Therefore, none of these acquisitions could be


driving the more than $37 million, or 40%, increase in revenues


China Sky is projecting for 2009.


Investors should carefully question how a company can increase its


sales without substantial increases in working capital and property,


plant, and equipment. China Sky states that it only has $20.9 million


in net property and equipment, which reportedly generated $24.8


million in revenue in the first quarter. In contrast, AOB had $245.5


million in property, plant, equipment, and land-use rights to


generate $46.1 million of revenue in the first quarter. That is, China


Sky in one quarter generated revenue comprising 118% of its total


PP&E, while AOB generated revenue representing only 19% of its


PP&E.
