China Agritech: a follow up
THIS POST HAS IMPORTANT QUALIFICATIONS - SEE THE POST SCRIPT.  PLEASE READ THE
QUALIFICATIONS AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS POST. 
 
China Agritech is a NASDAQ listed Chinese company that is – according to its SEC filings - in the
business of manufacturing and distributing organic fertilizer.
 
The annual filing lists their capacity as follows:
 


... annual production capacity as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 13,000
metric tons of organic liquid compound fertilizers whereas ... annual production capacity
for granular fertilizers as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 200,000 metric tons,
consisting of 100,000 metric tons in Anhui, 50,000 metric tons in Harbin, and 50,000
tons in our newly completed plant in Xinjiang.


 
In my last blog post I noted that:
 
(a) A hitherto unknown shortseller (Lucas McGee Research) had released a report that suggested
that key plants either did not exist or were entirely incapable of producing at the levels indicated in the
annual filings.  Lucas McGee research - as company promoters have been keen to point out -
operates out of a virtual office and have a very limited history.
 
(b). The biggest shareholder is the world's most powerful private equity firm (Carlyle). I did not note –
but Carlyle has filed a prospectus to register (and hence sell) their stock.
 
(c). The company has issued a denial of the shortseller report and claimed that all their plants and
distribution centers are as listed in the annual filing.
 
I have a short position in the stock. I am keen to verify or reject the claims in the short seller report. (If
I rejected the claims I would switch and go very long the stock.  The stock is on-face cheap - and it is
liquid enough that I could change my position in minutes.)
 
I wrote to Carlyle – and to Anne Zheng (a staff member of Carlyle and Carlyle's representative on the
board of CAGC) – to see if Carlyle would confirm or deny the shortseller report. Alas I got no answer. 
 
That makes research a little harder.  This post is a summary of my research efforts.  
 
The research efforts of course wound up against the normal epistemological problems of proving the
existence or non-existence of things.  In this case, if you find the plants and you count the trucks
entering and leaving the plants with amounts of fertilizer on them consistent with the company filings
you have proved the existence of the company and disproved the short case. 
 
If however you do not find the plants you have not proved the short case - the plants could be
somewhere else - or closed for a reason - or you could have the address wrong or any other similar
snafu.  It is hard - nay impossible - to prove a negative. 
 
So - if the short case is right - the best I could expect to do is find data consistent with the short case.
 I did not expect to be able to prove the fraud. 
 
The key shortseller allegations
 
Here are the key shortseller allegations as stated by Lucas McGee (the shortseller):
 


Sinochem (a claimed large customer) has told us that it does not sell any Agritech
products

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: a follow up


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-agritech-follow-up.html 2/12


Government officials in China told us that Agritech does not have a license
to manufacture granular fertilizers, which the company claims are its largest product
line. 


After visiting Agritech’s reported manufacturing facilities in Beijing, Anhui, Xinjiang, and
Harbin, we found virtually no manufacturing underway. The single exception was the
facility in Pinggu County on the outskirts of Beijing, where the plant was not in operation
on the Friday when we (Lucas McGee) visited but local people told us that it has
sporadically produced some liquid fertilizer over the last year. 


Plants in Bengbu, Anhui (supposedly the largest), Harbin, and Xinjiang were completely
shuttered.


Obviously these are allegations that go right to the heart of the company.  Instead Lucas McGee
suggests that money is being stripped out of the company by inflated rents to related parties.  
 
If the Lucas McGee allegations are correct then the company will probably trade well under a dollar at
some future date.  
 
The company has categorically denied these allegations. Firstly it has pointed to a contract with
Sinochem previously filed with the SEC (I will get to that contract later).  Further the company has
photographs of bags of granular fertilizer and some liquid fertilizer. And it has said that “the company
and its subsidiaries are operating normally.”
 
As stated – after repeated requests – Anne Zheng (the Carlyle executive on the China Agritech
board) did not confirm or otherwise vouch for the company's position.
 
Doing the work myself
 
Given that I could not rely on Carlyle, I employed a lawyer in China to visit the plant and see what
they could find. This was made somewhat more difficult than usual because of Chinese New Year
celebrations. You would not expect the plant to be operational during the holiday – and hence you
could not check the volume of the plant by, say, counting trucks visiting.
 
The Anhui plant
 
I chose the China Agritech plant in Anhui because (a) it is listed as the largest plant run by the
company – doing 100 thousand tonnes per year of fertilizer, (b) the Lucas McGee report suggested
that it was shuttered and (c) it was fairly close to Shanghai and hence possible to visit.
 
Here is what the shortseller report said about the plant.
 


In Anhui, which Agritech calls its principal production facility, $400,000 worth of plant
and equipment would seem slim for 100,000 tons of production capacity. We visited and
found a small plant on a rutted road outside Bengbu, completely deserted.


 
Lucas McGee give a photograph.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: a follow up


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-agritech-follow-up.html 3/12


This (surprisingly) was not the plant we found.  We found the plant we photographed  from following
SEC filings.  
 
The annual filing gives the addresses of the plants as follows:
 
 


 
 
The Anhui plant is giving as  Changzheng East Rd, Gaoxin District, Bangfu City. The plant is
(according to this part of the annual filing) large (3,400 square meters) and the rent is USD32,488 per
month. (You can calculate the rent per square foot and my knowledgeable China contact suggests
that this is high for low end industrial rent in China.)
 
Changzheng (the street name) translates as “Long March”.
 
There is another SEC filing (a quarterly) which gives a lease agreement for a plant in Bangfu City.
 
The address is consistent (1188 Changzheng Road Gaoxin District, Bengbu.)  I am presuming that
these are the same plant - as there is only one plant listed as rented in Anhui in the property section
of the annual report.  
 
We have however had problems with this in translation.  Some translations have it as "Long Road"
Gaoxin District – rather than “Changzheng Road” or “Long March Road”. You can see that translation
in using a Google translation of this 2007 job advert.
 
The lease gives the space as 1338 meters squared – considerably smaller than the 3400 meters
square in the annual report. The rent is also considerably less than the annual report (commensurate
with size) but the rent per square foot was higher - and high according to my (knowledgeable)
contact.
 
Anyway my contact visited this site – and it is clearly an industrial site – but there is no large fertiliser
plant on the site. The ground floor is held by the Bengbu Yi Machinery Factory and the Bengbu
Equipment Factory. These are metalworking shops – and their sign is on the front door.
 
Here is the photograph.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: a follow up


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-agritech-follow-up.html 4/12


 
 
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT REGARDING THIS PHOTO AT THE END... 
 
 
There were not a large number of people on site. That was not surprising as it was Chinese New
Year. There was however a security guard – and my contact talked to the security guard. He had
never heard of China Agritech – or even Anhui Agritech. However it turned out that they did have
premises on the second floor of the building – though nothing as large as the amounts indicated in
either the lease or the annual.
 
There were no smells associated with organic fertiliser. Organic fertiliser as most people would know
smells somewhat.
 
Moreover – and this is an obvious point – a fertilizer plant that processes 100 thousand tonnes
of fertilizer per year is vanishingly unlikely to be on the second floor. 100 thousand tonnes of fertilizer
is 2.5 million 40kg bags of fertilizer.  Moving this requires trucks and loading docks and the like.
 
The Security Guard said that the Bengbu Equipment Factory moved here approximately 3 months
ago. He was not aware of either China Agritech or Anhui Agritech having any other premises. A
cursory online check with the Administration of Industry and Commerce database showed Anhui
Agritech only at this address. My lawyer-contact in Shanghai noted that it would be breaking the law
to be operating from a second address without including that address in the database.
 
This all sounds consistent with the Lucas McGee report, however I note a glaring inconsistency.  This
appears to be a different premise to the one photographed by the shortseller report.  
 
 
The shortseller premises are a small plant on a rutted road whereas my contact suggested that this
was a more urban plant.  It would be sensible to have a fertiliser plant at an address closer to the
outskirts of town, after all fertiliser is a bulk commodity and organic fertiliser smells. Moreover it is
used outside towns – so premises on the outskirts of town make more sense than this site.
 
It is possible then that the premises are different from the ones mentioned in the annual report.
However our contact visited the premises in the annual report and they did not find a fertiliser plant
capable of producing 100 thousand tonnes per annum.
 
Moreover - considerable digging on the internet has meant that we have found an advert for a plant
lease for 1338 square meters at the same address as the Anhui Agritech lease.  The same address
and the same plant size to the square meter suggests that the plant was released.  This is consistent
with Bengbu Equipment Factory moving into premises previously occupied by China Agritech -
however we have no information that the premises were ever occupied by China Agritech.  The
security guard did not know China Agritech...

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: a follow up


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-agritech-follow-up.html 5/12


China Agritech has claimed Sinochem as a major customer. Lucas McGee says that they talked to
Sinochem and Sinochem denied being a customer. The company in their defence has pointed to an
SEC filing that details a contract with Sinochem. Here is that filing.
 
The filing is interesting. It is for liquid fertiliser and in surprisingly small quantity. The contract is for
liquid fertiliser in tiny bottles. I quote:
 
 


Name  Package Size   Number   Volume (L)   
Unit Price


(Yuan /L)   
Purchase Amount


(Yuan)  
organic condensed liquid compound fertilizer (Broad Spectrum


Type)  
15ml *300


packages/piece    5,000   22,500   60   1,350,000 
organic condensed liquid compound fertilizer (Broad Spectrum


Type)  
180ml *50


bottle/piece    100,000   900,000   55   49,500,000 


organic condensed liquid compound fertilizer (Anti-disease Type)  
20 mil * 300


bag/piece    25,000   150,000   66   9,900,000 
Total (RMB)  60,750,000                 
 
Note: the prices above include packaging price, Party B shall pay transportation fee.


 
These are tiny bottles – sometimes only 15ml and always less than one fifth of a litre. The contracts
include packaging.  A 15ml packet is probably enough for one to five shrubs - not a commercial farm.
 The instructions (in Chinese on China Agritech's website) suggests that the liquid be diluted 1000 to
1 before watering plants.  A 15ml packet would do a watering can.  
 
The total contract is for just over a million litres – or just over a thousand tonnes. This is tiny for a
company that produces (or claims to produce) over 200 thousand tonnes per year of fertilizer - and
indeed the main product appears to be packing and handling.  
 
This Sinochem contract is probably real (contrary to the suggestions of the shortseller).  But the
contract is tiny and unlikely to be financially relevant. 
 
Moreover, the contract is not agricultural supply (which is done in bulk) rather a packaging contract for
the sort of product someone use to fertilize their home flower patch. I might buy a small bottle
of fertilizer for my (postage stamp size) backyard.
 
Moreover this contract is consistent with what the shortseller said about the company – they said that
the company produced small quantities of liquid fertiliser at Pinggu County on the outskirts of Beijing.
Indeed the contract was signed in Beijing.  
 
 
The company's photographic evidence 
 
The company has presented several photos to prove the plants are there.  The photos show plants
but without loading docks or the like.  They also show liquid fertilizer packing.  They show a total of
five 40kg bags of mixed organic/NPK fertilizer.  
 
They are however not supportive of the proposition that this company produces 200 thousand tonnes
(5 million 40kg bags) of dry fertilizer annually. 
 
Several of the photos are of packaging and distributing very small quantities of liquid fertilizer.  Here is
one example.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: a follow up


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-agritech-follow-up.html 6/12


 
Summary
 
I sent a researcher to the company's stated main premise to see if I could find a plant capable of
producing 100 thousand tonnes per annum of bulk fertiliser. We did not find that plant.
 
The company has protested there is one there. The premises appear different from the one the
shortseller visited – but I found stuff consistent with what the Lucas McGee report and inconsistent
with what the company says.
 
The Lucas McGee report said that no contract with Sinochem existed. I am satisfied that Lucas
McGee is wrong on that point. A small contract for liquid fertiliser for retail use exists – and the
company is capable of bottling such a product. However it is entirely possible that no bulk-dry-product
contract with Sinochem exists.  The contract in the SEC filings does not support the proposition that
Sinochem is a meaningful customer relative to China Agritech’s claimed sales.
 
China Agritech has produced photos to support the existence of their main business. These photos
are alas entirely consistent with the shortseller claims - in that they do not support the proposition that
there is a business capable of distributing 5 million bags of fertilizer.  Moreover none of the photos is
labelled or geo-tagged in any way that helps verify the existence of the company.
 
I am staying short. 
 
 
 
 
John 
 
Some people have noticed - that unbeknown to me - my Chinese contact took the photo of the gate

TAKE photos - 
 
He just says "Here is a picture of the gate".  He never told me he TOOK the picture of the gate.
 Though my instructions to him were clearly TAKE PHOTOS. 
 
I will follow up with photos HE TOOK. 
 
---------------- 
 
The current state of play is this:  The lawyer in the states had a colleague swing by the factory on her
way home.  She was visiting her family in Anhui for Chinese New Year and SHE provided photos
including photos of the metalworking.  She also provided the photo of the factory gate - a photo that
perplexed me because it was NOT a photo that matched the photos in the Lucas McGee report. 
 
My lawyer in Shanghai cannot explain why the photo came from the website and was not taken on
her phone.  
 
He is trying to follow this up.  I will have a further follow up details when available.
