China Finance Online CEO Resigns From Key Posts In China Amid
Anti-Corruption Probe

Summary


The most current SAIC records show Chairman and CEO Zhiwei Zhao suddenly
resigned from his positions at three key Chinese VIE subsidiaries of JRJC over the
past few months.


This development has yet to be disclosed by management. Additionally, Zhao was
also mysteriously absent from JRJC’s March 23, 2015 fourth quarter earnings
conference call.


Chinese media reports exposing the detention of JRJC independent director
Rongquan Leng prompted JRJC to announce his resignation, without addressing his
alleged detention.


Chinese media reports also indicate serious legal troubles for associates of Zhao,
who himself is reportedly not allowed to leave China.


Ling Wang, a former long-time JRJC director and associate of Zhao, fled China in
2014, leaving his company indebted to JRJC for $25 million.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Serious Legal Troubles Emerge, Undisclosed by JRJC


The first hints of legal trouble at China Finance Online (NASDAQ:JRJC) appeared in a
December 15, 2014 China's Tencent Prism magazine special report on the business
dealings of the brother of a detained high-level government official. With respect to JRJC,
Tencent Prism reported that Ling Wang, a former director of JRJC and close associate of
CEO Zhiwei Zhao, fled China in 2014 to escape a corruption investigation. Zhao
apparently wasn't so lucky, as he was reportedly restricted from leaving China at the end
of 2014.


In the two trading days following the Tencent Prism report, JRJC shares fell 25% from
$7.62 to $5.70. Disturbingly, JRJC management did not respond to the report, despite the
very serious allegations and a large decline in the share price.

On March 23, 2015, JRJC reported dismal earnings and its stock fell by 26% from $6.19
to $4.58. Chairman Zhao was mysteriously absent from this important earnings
conference call, the first he had missed since July 2013. JRJC provided no explanation for
Zhao's absence, but did provide a quote from Zhao in the earnings release as well as a
prepared remark purportedly from Zhao that was read during the conference call.


Matters took another turn for the worse on April 17, 2015, when Caixin Magazine reported
the official detention of JRJC independent director Rongquan Leng during a corruption
investigation. The article pointed out that Leng's "…fall might be related to a U.S. listed
company." Also, the article cited a source who claimed that Leng and the brother of the
detained high-level government official "participated in the control of the shares of a U.S.
listed company from behind the scenes."


In response the Caixin report, JRJC issued a hastily prepared press release later that day
announcing the resignation of Mr. Leng "for personal reason." Incredibly, JRJC did not
comment on any of the issues raised in Caixin's report. JRJC thus appears to be
determined to keep U.S. investors in the dark regarding the company's numerous legal
issues in China.


CEO Zhao Suddenly Resigned from the Management of Three of JRJC's Key
Chinese VIE Subsidiaries


For U.S. investors, JRJC's legal issues are compounded by the risky VIE structure of its
Chinese operations. As many authors have previously noted, VIE structures often entail
significant risks, especially when a company's main Chinese operating subsidiaries are
VIEs controlled by a person who is in legal trouble. JRJC historically did a poor job
disclosing its VIE structure, which was recently questioned by the SEC, resulting in JRJC
filing an amended 2013 20-F on April 21, 2015 that added more detailed disclosures and
related risks. Despite the additional disclosure, JRJC failed to disclose the resignation of
CEO Zhao from key VIE management posts made in the weeks prior to the April 27, 2015
filing of its 2014 20-F.


We obtained and reviewed the SAIC records of JRJC's Chinese VIE and directly owned
operating subsidiaries. To our surprise, updated SAIC records show that CEO Zhao
suddenly resigned as director, legal representative, and general manager of three
key Chinese VIE subsidiaries over the course of the last few months. JRJC has
failed to disclose Zhao's resignations to investors.


The following are the three key VIE subsidiaries that reported the resignation of Zhao in
updated SAIC filings:

After fleeing China in 2014, Ling Wang's company still owed JRJC $25 million


Ling Wang was a former long-time JRJC director and associate of Zhao, who fled China in
2014. Wang resigned from the board of JRJC in 2012. Following Wang's resignation,
JRJC made a questionable real estate investment with Wang's company, Langfang
Shengshi Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., as follows:


"In order to enhance our return on cash during the strategic transition period, in
March 2013, we invested an aggregate $22.1 million in a real estate project in
Langfang City, Hebei Province, developed by Langfang Shengshi Real Estate
Development Co., Ltd. (the "Langfang Developer")." (page 18 of the 2014 20-F)


As of December 26, 2013, Langfang Developer was 75% owned by Beijing Qingshi
Investment Management Co., Ltd, which was 100% owned by Ling Wang, according to
SAIC records shown below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3232916-china-finance-online-ceo-resigns-from-key-posts-in-china-amid-anti-corruption-probe 7/12


At the time of this suspicious investment (March 2013), JRJC CEO Zhao also failed to
disclose that he had an indirect equity interest in Wang's Langfang Developer, which
according to the SAIC record (above) Zhao transferred to Ling Wang on July 23, 2013.


As of December 31, 2014, Wang's Langfang Developer owed JRJC $25 million, according
to the 20-F, which warns of the risk of failure to collect this outstanding amount (see page
18) but, of course, never discloses Wang's predicament with the Chinese authorities.
JRJC reported that it received $2.1 million from the Langfang Developer on March 10,
2015 (see page 76 of 20-F).
