Diodes, Inc. (DIOD): Exposing a Cheater 
 


Over the last year, DIOD’s results have materially decoupled from the 
widespread semiconductor industry downturn, with management 
attributing strength to content and share gains. However, a closer 
examination reveals an abnormal spike in intercompany sales and re-
routing of product between geographies, which coincided with the Trump 
Administration’s implementation of Chinese tariffs. It appears DIOD’s 
decoupling has been driven by illegal “transshipment” that avoids tariffs 
and creates an unfair price advantage vs. law abiding peers. We believe 
ample evidence exists for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency 
to initiate an investigation into DIOD.

“When something seems too good to be true, then it probably is” – old adage. 





Nearly two years ago, we wrote our inaugural report, “M/A-COM Technology Solutions (MTSI):  


Exposing the Charade,”1 which was the first of two reports we penned on MTSI. Since sharing our 70-


page report, MTSI’s stock has declined by nearly 60% as many of the red flags we raised came to 


fruition.  





Today, we share our first report on DIOD, which does not require 70 pages to expose what we believe 


is a blatant strategy of cheating. The slowdown in the semiconductor industry and associated inventory 


digestion that commenced in late 2018 has impacted nearly all broadline semiconductor 


manufacturers. DIOD, which has continued to report confoundingly strong results and guidance, 


appears to be the lone exception. While applauding the Company’s “execution,” many analysts have 


struggled to explain the performance disconnect in a commodity industry. DIOD attributes their recent 


success to “content and share gains” in automotive and electronics equipment. However, this fails to 


reconcile with most peers, such as Vishay (VSH), who have reported similar content gains, but have 


still suffered overall weakness given the breadth of the current downturn.  





So how has DIOD, a marginal player with “me too” products, been so successful in a pervasively 


weak commodity semiconductor downturn? A close examination of DIOD’s financial filings and 


industry discussions suggest that DIOD is cheating, and once exposed, this “too good to be true” story 


will face shareholder malcontent and possibly legal risks. We have forwarded information to the U.S. 


Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) for examination and believe ample evidence exists for 


the CBP to initiate an immediate investigation into DIOD.   
 


I. The Material Disconnect Between DIOD and its Peers 
 


The first warnings of the semiconductor industry downturn began to appear in late summer of 2018, as 


STM and MPWR warned of a slowdown. Over the last four quarters, general weakness has spread 


throughout the commodity semiconductor industry. Forward estimates have come down in each of the 


last three earnings seasons, as analog and discrete semiconductor makers, large and small, succumbed 


to cyclical forces. As the chart below illustrates, the average 2Q19 revenue estimate for DIOD’s peer 


group has been cut by 14% since downward revisions commenced last Fall. Despite strong franchises 


across the companies listed below, the combination of tariffs, inventory builds, and cyclical pressure 


have overwhelmed content and market share stories. Incredibly, during this broad downturn that has 


plagued the analog and discrete semiconductor industry, DIOD has not missed a beat, with calendar 


2Q19 revenue estimates that have actually increased by 1% when compared to expectations a year 


ago.

Note: SMTC estimate based on July 2019 quarter. Companies are arranged in order of market capitalization, largest to smallest. 





The 15% delta in estimated revenue revisions results in a materially disproportionate impact on 


earnings. Considering DIOD’s largely fixed cost model and ~50% incremental gross margin, the 15% 


revision delta versus the broader peer group would account for $0.35 of DIOD’s $0.74 consensus 


2Q19 EPS estimate.  





[Note: DIOD’s 2Q19 guidance included revenue from the GFAB facility acquired from TXN in April, 


but DIOD stated on its earnings call it would be immaterial to overall revenue. We will touch on this 


acquisition and management’s alarmingly cryptic disclosures later.] 
 


II. DIOD’s “Potential” Strategy to Cheat Tariffs (in 1 Chart) 
 


In September 2018, a 10% tariff was implemented on $200 billion of US imports of Chinese goods, 


with China applying retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of US goods. The tariffs are typically paid by the 


buyer of the goods in the destination country, which in the case of broadline semiconductors includes 


distributors and OEM customers. Our broad industry discussions and analysis of peer company 


commentary suggests that while some semiconductor manufacturers absorbed some tariffs, the costs 


have been overwhelmingly passed on to the buyers. 





DIOD has manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia, with Asia-based production 


historically representing ~80% of its revenues.2 When one region sells product to another region, 


before ultimately being sold to an end customer, an intercompany sale is created. This is a common 


practice and reporting methodology for semiconductor companies, as intermediate geographies are 


often used for logistical purposes or to complete manufacturing steps. Historically, the percentage of 


DIOD’s intercompany sales between its three regions has been steady and Net Sales reported in the 


financial results eliminate intercompany sales. However, these intercompany sales are disclosed in 


SEC filings.  





A strange pattern began to emerge at DIOD in 2Q18, which has only intensified with DIOD’s 


performance separation from its peer group. As seen in the chart below, intercompany sales in Asia

and North America regions began to increase throughout last year, before spiking meaningfully above 


historical ranges by 1Q19. We would note that 2Q18 was when tariff discussions between the U.S. and 


China became toxic.  





Table 2: DIOD’s Reported Sales by Region  


 
Source: DIOD 1Q19 10-Q.  





Our industry checks confirmed there haven’t been material changes to DIOD’s manufacturing 


processes, which means this spike in intercompany sales is the result of products being re-routed from 


the region of origin. We believe DIOD is pursuing this rerouting strategy to artificially change the 


geographic product origin and offer products that are not subjected to tariffs. If we are correct, 


DIOD is engaging in “transshipping,” which is an illegal strategy used to circumvent anti-


dumping tariffs.  
 


The practice of falsifying product origin violates Section 1592 of Title 19 (Customs Duties) of United 


States Code, Chapter 4 (Tariff Act of 1930).3 It is punishable under Section 542 (Entry of Goods by 


Means of False Statements)4 and Section 545 (Smuggling)5 of Title 18 (Crimes and Criminal 


Procedure) of Chapter 27 (Customs) of the United States Code. Punishment includes fines, 


imprisonment, or both.  





Tariff evasion through transshipment has become an increasingly hot button issue with broader 


implementation of tariffs, as evidenced by a recent article in The Wall Street Journal.6

Specific to DIOD, we have spoken with multiple industry sources who believe the Company has 


proactively pursued a strategy of transshipping. If true, which seems likely considering the 


inexplicable change in intercompany sales and decoupling versus its peers, DIOD would have an 


unfair and illegal advantage against commodity competitors whose products are labeled with true 


country of origin and subject to tariffs. For distributor customers with low-teens gross margins and 


low-single digit EBIT margins, avoiding a 10% tariff on imported products is a material economic 


consideration when procuring components.  





We believe sufficient evidence exists for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to initiate an 


immediate investigation of DIOD’s practices, and we expect the outcome to be crippling. 
 


III. Why DIOD is More Likely to Cheat 
 


It is important to recognize why DIOD may be more apt to engage in illicit behavior than its peers. 


Below are a few considerations that investors may want to consider as they think about DIOD’s 


motivations for illegal tariff circumvention: 





 DIOD more closely resembles a hairy Chinese enterprise than a reputable US semiconductor 
company. With five of its seven manufacturing facilities located in China/Taiwan, DIOD’s 


operations are heavily China-based. Its President and CEO of 14 years, Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, runs DIOD 


in an unconventional manner. Dr. Lu owns 1.55 million shares, which represents a $56 million 


position, and creates an economic incentive to “go the extra mile” at any cost. DIOD’s Corporate 


Controller is Kevin Chou, who just so happens to be Dr. Keh-Shew Lu’s son-in-law. 7 Further adding 


to the unusual C-Suite finance team dynamic is the fact Richard White, who had been the CFO for a 


decade, abruptly quit in February. 8 While we are mindful of making unfair generalizations, there is 


a language barrier between Dr. Lu and English-speaking investors. Further, industry analysts have
Cold Shower Analytics   
  


________________________________________________________________________7 


noted that Dr. Lu’s approach at DIOD is reminiscent of Peter Chang at Alliance Fiber Optic (AFOP), 


who was found guilty of securities fraud last year. 9   





 DIOD’s “content expansion” story fails to align with reality. DIOD’s “content growth” story has 
centered around Automotive and Consumer/Communications/Computing applications such as USB-


C, Smart Home and Servers, as laid out in their investor presentations.10 However, a closer look at 


the 1Q19 reality shows Automotive represented just 10% of 1Q19 revenue and accounted for a small 


fraction of DIOD’s consolidated year-over-year growth. Consumer/Communications/Computing, 


which is the other focus area for content growth, actually declined 1% year-over-year. In fact, 88% 


of the Y/Y incremental revenue was generated in the Industrial segment, which has not been central 


to the “content expansion” story. As is often the case, management responded to probing questions 


about its sources of growth with evasive answers in broken English: 





Tristan Gerra (Analyst): “In industrial, you do have a very meaningful percent exposure. So what 


would you say at a high level is driving the share gain? Is that packaging, is it pricing? Any particular 


sector that you could emphasize?” 





Emily Yang (SVP Sales and Marketing): “I think -- this is Emily, let me address the question. I think 


it’s really about content expansion. So even the market may not be growing from the total demand 


point of view, but we've seen significant content expansion within that industrial area. The leverage 


between the values and also the Pericom product line that we've seen are significant push in this 


area for us.”  





Keh-Shew Lu (President and CEO): “Packaging is one of the help, but that right now we are not just 


-- depend on the packaging. The real reason is to which we start to focus on solution provider. Since 


through all different acquisitions, our product line now is very completed and has enabled us to 


provide to our customer a total solution. So, if anyone in for TI, we now focus on provide our 


customer the total solution and this is the difference from the past.” 


Source: 1Q19 Earnings Call Bloomberg Transcript 





 Cryptic disclosure around GFAB acquisition shows an alarming lack of transparency. DIOD 
disclosed some capacity metrics for the GFAB facility acquisition on the 4Q18 earnings call but 


refused to disclose the purchase price, claiming it was immaterial. Management also refused to 


quantify its expected contribution within 2Q19 guidance, despite a full quarter of ownership. 


However, local media in Scotland has published11 that DIOD is investing £50 million ($64 million) 


in the asset, which would represent the majority of its $80 million net cash balance as of 1Q19.  
 


IV. Near-Term Financial Results Will Remain Strong, but the Smoke is Thick 
 


With tariffs increasing to 25% in May, the motivation and financial rewards to evade tariffs became 


even stronger. Combined with the contribution from the GFAB acquisition, which management 


refused to disclose, we expect DIOD to report a solid 2Q and 3Q guidance. But that is not the story.  





We believe DIOD is cheating and results can remain “strong” so long as the Company can sustain an 


illegal advantage. We believe this report is the first step to exposing DIOD, and of course, a trade deal 


may eliminate any illegal competitive advantage that has been gained through transshipping.  





Aside from the threat of being caught in a scandal, fines and potential imprisonment, we believe DIOD 


has fundamentally misrepresented its ability to compete and generate earnings through an unfair and 


illegal tariff strategy. We believe as much as half of DIOD’s current earnings power is at risk.

Moreover, if we are correct, then the stigma of illegality would be devastating considering the 


majority of DIOD’s products are catalog parts with plenty of alternative suppliers. Further, investors 


would most likely revalue the stock to be more in line with the Chinese commodity suppliers DIOD 


resembles. 





Applying the same 14% downward sales revisions of its peer group, and applying a 50% decremental 


margin, we estimate DIOD’s “legal” earnings power is closer to $0.40 per quarter. Incidentally, this 


run-rate would be consistent with 2H17, before DIOD’s tariff-related shenanigans commenced. 


Assuming a 14x multiple, which would be in line with mid-cycle commodity semiconductor suppliers, 


yet still above its Chinese peers, we believe fair value is approximately $22.50, or 40% downside.  





We’ll have more to share on DIOD after the report 2Q’19 earnings.
