Summary: Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT)
Despite a Friday CNBC investigative piece highlighting red �ags with Riot and precipitating


a 33%+ share decline, the company �led an 8-K later that afternoon raising bright new red


�ags.


The �ling was released during a market “dead zone”; Friday after the close heading into


the long holiday weekend. It detailed a dubious agreement.


We estimate that Riot’s new agreement implies an over-payment of about $18.5 million


for bitcoin mining equipment purchased from a seemingly undisclosed related party


entity.


We found other entities related to a Riot subsidiary that raise additional questions.


Riot’s latest questionable transaction strikes us as particularly brazen in light of the


intense public scrutiny the company has seen recently.


Introduction


Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)) and one of its key


backers, Barry Honig, have come under a tremendous amount of recent scrutiny over the past


couple of months, capped o� by a CNBC investigative piece Privacy  - Terms

price.


Despite the fresh warning signs highlighted by CNBC, that same evening the company �led an


8-K during a market ‘dead zone’; Friday after the close heading into a long holiday weekend.


The �ling detailed a transaction that strikes us as intensely questionable, and raises brand new


red �ags.


Public Scrutiny of Riot Blockchain


We are �rst going to recap some of the recent reporting on Riot. For those interested in just the


brand new items please skip to the following section.


10/6/2017: Following the company’s sudden business and name change from Bioptix Inc.


to Riot Blockchain, the Heisenberg Report (https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-


heisenberg/articles#regular_articles) identi�ed a multitude of early red �ags


(https://heisenbergreport.com/2017/10/06/meet-riot-blockchain-and-grab-a-blimpie-


while-youre-here/) including how the company’s o�cial corporate address corresponded


to a mail drop adjacent to a Blimpie’s in a Colorado strip mall.


12/11/2017: We published our �rst detailed report on Riot entitled “Sudden Business


Pivot, Suspicious Acquisitions, Questionable Special Dividend


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-riot-blockchain-sudden-business-pivot-


suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend).” In the report, we described the


company’s bizarre approach to buying crypto-mining equipment. Rather than purchasing


the equipment directly from the manufacturer or from suppliers, Riot instead signi�cantly


overpaid for the equipment by purchasing it through a newly formed shell entity. We also


highlighted the ownership of key backer Barry Honig and a questionable special cash


dividend that seemed to disproportionately bene�t insiders such as Honig.


12/12/2017: The following day, CNBC’s Brian Kelly


(https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/12/12/trader-warns-that-riot-blockchain-might-not-


be-what-you-think.html) led a segment that reinforced and corroborated much of our


research, concluding the piece stating “I’m not sure that this is actually a blockchain


company, so you need to be careful is the bottom line.”


12/13/2017: We published a follow-up article (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131708-

both Riot and a company called Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA)) showed alarming parallels, including shared


key executives, shared key backers, and similarly dubious methods of purchasing crypto-


mining equipment through newly-formed shell entities.


12/19/2017: Andrew Left of Citron stated on twitter


(https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/943151385532555264) “$RIOT is THE most


traded retail stock in market today yet Citron believes they are making fraudulent claims


to investors.” He then challenged Riot CEO John O’Rourke to a debate on CNBC. O’Rourke


declined the invitation, but Left went on the network and shared his short thesis


(https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/infamous-short-seller-andrew-left-scrambling-for-


ways-to-bet-against-bitcoin.html) anyway. He described the Riot business by saying “there


is nothing there.” He later clari�ed that he didn’t believe there was fraud because “in


order for there to be fraud you have to have operat[ions].”


1/9/2018: We wrote a follow-up piece entitled “Riot Blockchain: This Crypto Clown Car


Continues Hurtling Toward The Abyss (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4136235-riot-


blockchain-crypto-clown-car-continues-hurtling-toward-abyss)” which described new red


�ags, including that (1) Riot had switched auditors; engaging its 3  auditor within the


span of a year (2) Riot had a propensity for reporting its negative developments on


Friday’s after the market close; and (3) new documents showed that Riot’s crypto-mining


assets had actually been purchased through an entity that purchased them from yet


another entity that was a related-party. From our article:


After all, why buy cryptomining equipment directly from the manufacturer’s website


(https://shop.bitmain.com/) or from a supplier when you can dramatically overpay for


it by simply purchasing it through a 2-week-old entity that purchased it from a


di�erent related party entity that purchased it from (presumably) the manufacturer or


a supplier?


1/31/2018: The Wall Street Journal published a piece entitled “Investor Who Rode Pivot


From Biotech to Bitcoin Sells Big Stake (https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-who-rode-


pivot-from-biotech-to-bitcoin-sells-big-stake-1517403600)” and described how Riot’s key


backer Barry Honig had exited much of his stake in the company. When asked about a


recent SEC investigation in a di�erent company that subpoenaed records relating to Mr.


Honig and other investors, Honig stated that he hadn’t been contacted by the SEC and


didn’t believe he was a target. “I am 120% not worried”, he said.

that described new warning signs including the company’s postponement of its annual


meeting for the 2  time in a row. The article also detailed Barry Honig’s ownership


history in the company. When asked about Honig’s purchases in Riot’s recent private


placement, Honig responded:


“I still own every one of those [shares] at $22.50,” he said. “That should tell you what I


think about Riot.”


Note that Mr. Honig is legally unable to freely trade the shares issued in the private


placement given that they are as-of-yet unregistered


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000010/riot_s3.ht


m) and restricted (https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-


bulletins/ib_privateplacements.html). Later in the article the Denver Post asked the


SEC for comment:


“The SEC also declined to comment about Riot but pointed to an investor alert from


August: ‘Fraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to


convince potential victims to invest their money in scams. These frauds include ‘pump-


and-dump’ and market manipulation schemes involving publicly traded companies


that claim to provide exposure to these new technologies.’”


2/16/2018: The CNBC exposé (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/public-company-


changes-name-to-riot-blockchain-sees-shares-rocket.html) highlighted additional signs of


trouble including that (1) Riot had apparently not even booked a room for its twice-


postponed annual meeting; (2) upon visiting Barry Honig’s o�ce the reporters actually


encountered Riot’s CEO John O’Rourke who then claimed that he did not work there; and


(3) other eyebrow raising footage such as a rather awkward shot of O’Rourke attempting


to close the door in the face of CNBC correspondent Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. O’Rourke


later promised an on-camera interview to Caruso-Cabrera, but then hastily backed out


the night before. Later, O’Rourke complained that the CNBC report was “a negative one-


sided piece”, which is de�nitely something that can happen when a company CEO is asked


to present the other side then repeatedly no-shows to the interview opportunities.


2/16/2018: Investigative reporter Teri Buhl (http://www.teribuhl.com/) followed up after


the CNBC piece with additional details (http://www.teribuhl.com/2018/02/16/cnbc-

history of prior deals and other connections between key individuals involved in Riot. It

Honig and his various stock deals. Ms. Buhl was even sued by Honig after reporting on an

SEC subpoena that named Honig in relation to another company. She nonetheless


continued to advance her research. The lawsuit was eventually dropped.


An Apparent Undisclosed Related-Party
Transaction Raises Brand New Red Flags


According to O’Rourke, the company is very careful with its reporting practices. In a meeting


that O’Rourke demanded be o�-camera he told CNBC that Riot “over-disclose[s]”. He also


expressed that he was not worried about the SEC. Given the company’s self-described


approach of over-disclosure, and in light of all of the scrutiny above, one might think that Riot’s


executives would see �t to continue to exercise heightened caution with its disclosures.


It may be surprising then that on Friday February 16th at 4:54pm—the very day the CNBC


investigative piece clobbered the stock by over 33%—a new Riot 8-K detailed yet another


dubious acquisition of crypto-mining equipment that seemingly failed to disclose a related


party transaction.


The 8-K included a detailed agreement relating to a press release issued the day before,


Thursday February 15 . The press release


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/ex99x2.htm) had


announced that Riot “entered into a de�nitive agreement to acquire additional cryptocurrency


mining equipment consisting of 3,800 Antminer S9 Bitcoin miners manufactured by Bitmain.”


A quick browse over to the Bitmain website (https://shop.bitmain.com/) shows that you can


purchase Antminer S9’s for $2,320 each. Thus, multiplication leads us to believe that


purchasing 3,800 machines should cost a total of about $8,816,000, assuming no bulk


discounts and excluding shipping costs.


But the new 8-K detailed how instead of purchasing the 3,800 machines in the manner above,


Riot is instead purchasing the machines through its subsidiary Kairos Global Technologies


(“Kairos”) that is in turn purchasing them through a recently formed entity called Prive


Technologies LLC “Prive”).


The total consideration is $11 million in cash and 1 million shares of Riot stock, with 200,000 of


the shares escrowed pending certain milestones. In all, the consideration suggests a total


transaction value at the time of agreement of about $28 million. The detailed agreement

added that ancillary equipment would be purchased, consisting of an unspeci�ed number of


Racks, Power Supplies, Network Switches, LAN Cables, PDU’s, Power Cables, Desktop Control


Servers, and Software licenses.


Factoring in all of the above: we estimate that Riot’s agreement suggests an over-payment


of about $18.5 million for the equipment purchased through Prive.


Notably, the press release


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/ex99x2.htm) failed


to mention Prive Technologies LLC at all, and the 8-K failed to disclose that Prive is seemingly a


related party of Riot’s subsidiary Kairos:


Nevada corporate records show (http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=fmE0EMNZjWiD8qFICJyf1w%253d%253d) that Kairos was established October


19 2017 with its President and Director currently listed as Michael Ho and Bryan Pascual,


respectively.


Florida corporate records show


(http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTi�ToPDF?


storagePath=COR%5C2017%5C1031%5C70164737.tif&documentNumber=L17000225341)


 that Prive was set up less than 2 weeks later, on October 31  2017, and similarly lists


Michael Ho and Bryan Pascual as its managers.


We emailed Riot’s investor relations and asked about whether Prive is a related party of Kairos.


We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we hear back from the company we will


update this accordingly.


Avid readers may recall from our previous articles (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-


riot-blockchain-sudden-business-pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-


dividend) that we had identi�ed red �ags relating to Riot’s approach to purchasing crypto-


mining equipment in an earlier deal. Our criticism focused on Riot’s decision not to purchase


equipment directly from suppliers or from the manufacturer. Instead Riot chose to dramatically


overpay for the equipment by acquiring the newly-formed Kairos entity which held the


equipment.


Worse yet, Riot later disclosed (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4136235-riot-blockchain-


crypto-clown-car-continues-hurtling-toward-abyss) that Kairos had purchased the equipment


from “a company controlled by the president of [Kairos].” At the time we did not know the

name of that unnamed entity. Given the latest information however, we believe Prive is likely


the previously unknown entity controlled by Kairos’s President (Michael Ho).


When asked by CNBC about the earlier purchases O’Rourke said


(https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/public-company-changes-name-to-riot-blockchain-sees-


shares-rocket.html) that the company paid a premium for the original equipment from Kairos


due to a shortage of mining equipment and di�culties getting it directly from the


manufacturer. Our research showed (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-riot-


blockchain-sudden-business-pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) that


Bitmain did not appear to have any major shortages or signi�cant delays at the time of the


purchase however.


Now in relation to this new deal, Bitmain similarly has an estimated shipping date of about 1 to


1.5 months on new Antminer S9s as of this writing.


A Second, Starkly Di�erent Transaction


Beyond our basic check of the Bitmain website however, we also have another comparable


transaction we can use to determine a market price of Antminer S9 Machines. Namely, Riot


entered into a separate transaction to purchase Antminer S9’s on the exact same day as the


transaction with Prive.


Despite the press release only announcing the deal for 3,800 machines (through Prive), the 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/riot_8k.htm) describ


ed a second agreement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/ex10x3.htm) entere


d on the same day (February 15 ) involving the purchase of 3,000 Antminer S9’s and related


equipment. In stark contrast to the deal with Prive above, the machines in the second


transaction appear to have been purchased from a third-party supplier at prices that strike us


as borderline commercially reasonable.


Riot purchased the machines in the second transaction from a Canadian distributor named


Blockchain Mining Supply & Services Ltd. (“BMS&S”) for a total of $8,500,000 in cash. This


compares to a total value of about $7,275,000 for 3,000 machines and 3,000 PSU’s


(https://shop.bitmain.com/productDetail.htm?

1.htm) (NASDAQ:OTCPK:LBCC (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LBCC)). Consequently,


evidence suggests that BMS&S/Joe Alfa is a supplier that has worked with multiple di�erent


companies.


Given that both transactions were entered into on the same day to purchase the same type of


machine (Antminer S9s manufactured by Bitmain) we cannot help but notice the vast price


di�erential:


In the believed non related-party transaction with BMS&S, Riot paid $2,833 per Antminer


S9/PSU.


In the believed related-party transaction with Prive, Riot paid $7,368 per Antminer


S9/related equipment.


The above strikes us as a rather brazen di�erence. We emailed Riot’s investor relations and


asked why Riot paid so much more in the Prive transaction relative to the BMS&S transaction.


We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we hear back from the company we will


update this accordingly.


A Variety of Other Entities Raise Additional
Questions


Stranger still, we found yet more entities set up by Michael Ho and Bryan Pascual that raise


additional questions:


1. BMH Mining LLC was established in Florida on December 11  2017 according to Florida


records (http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTi�ToPDF?


storagePath=COR%5C2017%5C1211%5C30602423.tif&documentNumber=L17000253085)


. Given the name of the entity, we wonder if this is another entity that is in the business of


purchasing or selling crypto-mining equipment.


2. Ingenium International LLC was also established in Florida the same day, December


11  2017, according to Florida records

sudden-business-pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) may recall


that we had identi�ed a suspicious and similarly named Nevada entity called Ingenium


Global Inc. (http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=InChigm1xtv9%252bfBiQj8bMA%253d%253d&nt7=0) that was set up by Michael


Ho and Bryan Pascual on October 19  2017. We found it odd because subsequent to its


formation Riot announced an investment

senior executive named Sorin Tanasescu that controlled a similarly named “Ingenium


(https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=9437649)”


entity.


Our overall concern with these potentially related entities center around whether shareholder


funds could be misused via investments that pass through them. The recent auditor switch


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000008/riot_8k-


010518.htm) also gives us heightened caution relating to the company’s �nancial controls.


We emailed Riot’s investor relations and asked whether the company or any of its a�liates or


related parties (including recent or current key holders) engaged in any transactions with Prive


Technologies LLC, BMH Mining LLC, Ingenium International LLC, or Ingenium Global Inc. We


have not heard back as of this writing. Should we hear back from the company we will update


this accordingly.


Moving right along, a review of corporate �lings shows that Michael Ho has listed 3 di�erent


addresses on his corporate �lings despite all three entities being formed around the same


time:

The implication from the above seems to be that Mr. Ho maintained addresses in all 3 cities


and took the time to form distinct corporate entities from each location. We �nd this to be odd.


We emailed Riot’s investor relations and asked why Michael Ho has listed 3 di�erent addresses


for his recent corporate �lings. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we hear back


from the company we will update this accordingly.


Cash Drain


The company seems to be running through its cash balance at a rather hasty pace. Riot raised


$37 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riot-blockchain-announces-37-million-


private-placement-300573173.html) million in cash through a December private placement.


Since then the company has:


Entered into the above agreements to purchase crypto-mining equipment which include


$19.5 million in cash outlays.


Bought 500 bitcoin through a U.S. Marshall’s auction for an estimated $5.2 million


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/riot-blockchain-claims-500-


bitcoins-in-u-s-marshals-auction).


Entered a Letter of Intent (LOI) to purchase Logical Brokerage Corp


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000101/ex99x1.htm) fo


r an undisclosed sum.


Spent an unknown amount on general corporate operations.


All said, the company has invested/committed/spent more than $24.7 million through the


above actions in the span of less than a month. We will be watching closely to see how much


cash the company is left with after all of the aforementioned endeavors.


Conclusion


Our overall view hasn’t changed since our last article (https://hindenburgresearch.com/riot-


blockchain-this-crypto-clown-car-continues-hurtling-toward-the-abyss/). We still believe Riot is


hurtling toward the abyss.
