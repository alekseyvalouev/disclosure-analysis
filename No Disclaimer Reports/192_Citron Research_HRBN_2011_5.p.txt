HARBIN ELECTRIC –
COMPLETELY EXPOSED


   Introduction
In 2010, the Chinese RTO space was thrown on its head


when once high flying Rino International was exposed as a


fraud and its customer/contractee list was shown to be


fraudulent.  At the same time the CEO was taking money


out of the company, the company was misrepresenting its


stature in its industry to US investors.  All of this transpired


under the eyes of their trouble-plagued auditor Frazer


Frost. 


It was only a month earlier that Harbin Electric


(NASDAQ:HRBN) prevented itself from becoming another


RINO by announcing a takeover bid by its Chairman/CEO


Tianfu Yang.  But that time has now come.  Citron will


prove that Harbin is just as bad as RINO:  fabricated


customers, management taking money from the company,


undisclosed insider dealings, and the worst accounting


disclosures that either Citron or any forensic accountant


has ever seen.


As for a buyout?   Not happening!   This report, if
printed in its entirety, would span over 100
pages.  A team of attorneys and investigators
has been gathering this data for months. 


Overview


This report examines in significant depth
Harbin’s purported operations and the deal

documents to explore the following questions:


2. Harbin has grossly overstated
revenues from its three disclosed
(largest) customers.


3. Harbin has grossly overstated its
export revenue. 


4. Harbin is guilty of multiple
securities violations


5. Harbin's largest division has
disclosed material control
weaknesses in every principal
aspect of its business. 


Note:  Throughout the report we will refer
to a thorough investigation into Harbin
conducted by a private investigative firm
in China.  In order to protect our sources,
Citron redacts the name of the firm, 
replacing it with “X” in appropriate
documents.  The executive who headed
the report is a Certified Fraud Examiner
with a specialty in China who has
curriculum vitae more extensive than any
investigator we have ever worked with. 
The full report, including the redacted
names, will be available to the SEC or
through legal due process with Citron
Research.


   Grossly Overstated "Largest
Customer" Revenues
Harbin’s current 10-K (fiscal yr 2010, filed
March 16, 2011) states:


“No customer accounted for more than 10% of the total
revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
Two major customers accounted for approximately 22%
of the net revenue for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2009, individually accounting for 12% (DXT) and
10% (Jiangsu Liyang Car Seat Adjuster Factory),
respectively. Three major customers accounted for 43%
of the net revenue for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2008, with each customer individually accounting
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 3/22


for 16% (Jiangsu Liyang Car Seat Adjuster
Factory), 15% (DXT) and 12% (Guiyang Putian
Logistic Co., Ltd.), respectively.”


It is the opinion of Citron that Harbin is
materially misrepresenting its revenue to the
investing public and thereby committing fraud
on the marketplace.  Here we will review the 3
stated major customers of Harbin and the
results of our investigation.


Customer #1: Jiangsu Liyang Car Seat
Adjuster


The clearest sign of fraud at HRBN is seen in
the interview with the purchasing agent at
Jiangsu Liyang.  Jiangsu Liyang (JLA) was
reported to be Harbin's 2nd largest customer in
2009 (10% of revenues), and its largest in
2008 (16% of revenues).  
The customer's Vice General Manager states
unequivocally that not only has his firm not
ordered a fraction of what Harbin has reported,
worse, their customers predominantly order
manual seat adjustors, not motorized ones.


This interview is definitive and draws a
clear path to fraud — more than sufficient to
trigger the Material Adverse Effect clause of the
bank's loan document draft.

According to JLA's SAIC filings and
presentation, which are consistent with its
published business model, HRBN’s claimed
sales to JLA were 114% of JLA’s total 2009
revenues, and 148% of JLA’s 2009
operating costs.  See the documents linked
below for verification.

**  Interesting note:  JLA has no difficulty
making public statements consistent with
its SAIC documents – which is not the
case with HRBN … or many other of the
Chinese RTO’s.


Customer #2:  Daqing Xinchengtai
Technology  (DXT)


The reported largest customer of Harbin in
2009 (and #2 in 2008) was challenging to
obtain financial information from.  That is
because they are not a manufacturer
themselves, but rather a middleman, supplying
pumps to the government funded Daqing
Oilfield.  While the SAIC docs retrieved were
light on information because of the
“Intermediary” nature of DXT's business, the
interviews were conclusive.

5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 5/22


All of Citron’s research, including interviews,
confirmed that Harbin grossly overstated
revenues recognized from DXT.  It is Citron’s
assessment that HRBN overstated its 2009 and
2008 sales to DXT at least by 365% and 247%
respectively. 


Below is the supporting documentation:

content/uploads/2011/08/Daqing-Interviews.pdf] ]


[ DXT SAIC [http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/08/DXT-SAIC.pdf] ]


Customer #3:  Guiyang Putian Logistic


The last of HRBN’s “top 3” customers is
Guiyang Putian Logistic (GPL), responsible for
12% of Harbin’s revenues for 2008.  ( The
Chinese character name for GPL is:


贵阳普天物流技术股份有限公司 ) 


It is the opinion of Citron Research that Harbin
has greatly exaggerated its sales to GPL.  As
stated in the 10-K,  GPL was 12% of 2008 Net
Revenue of $120,802,302. Obtaining these
records was more burdensome because
Guiynag is located in the Guizhou Province, a
third level province in China with inferior
corporate record keeping.


HRBN reported sales to GPL that would be 85%
of GPL’s total revenues.  This is obviously
unrealistic as validated by the purchaser for
GPL.  Our source documents appear below:

content/uploads/2011/08/GPL_Interview.pdf] ]


[  GPL SAIC English [http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/08/GPL-SAIC-English.pdf]   ]


This is what our research revealed for the only
three customers ever identified in Harbin's SEC
filings.  We can only imagine what the rest of
the revenue book looks like.

From 2010 10-K:


“Our automobile specialty micro-motors are
purchased by customers who are first-tier suppliers to
the automobile industry. We supply these products to
domestic customers and also export them to OEM
suppliers in North America.”


In the same 10-K they state that international
sales are $20,410,902 for the year ending
2010.  Noting all of the subsidiaries of Harbin
as presented in this corporate structure on their
website:


 


Citron has completed an exhaustive
analysis of product imports as
published in Datamyne, and finds a
mere fraction of the amount of imports
to North America Harbin claims to be
exporting. 


It is the opinion of Citron that Harbin has
exaggerated their export data by a factor of
multiples.  Linked here is a worksheet with our
findings.   Our research shows HRBN exports of

reported $20+ million.


[ Harbin Exports from Datamyne

For all those who think that Harbin is immune
to criticism because of its purported pending
buyout, be advised that this company is under
the scrutiny of the SEC until the moment the
deal is completed.  The company is at risk of
being forced to announce non-reliance on its
filed financial statements at any time.  The
Material Adverse Events clauses of the various
deal agreements therefore hang in the
balance. 


   Material Adverse Events
Even though Citron has provided strong
evidence that HRBN has been fabricating
revenues in its SEC filings, we are sure that
many investors will say, “Who cares if the
company is being bought?” 


Besides the obvious regulatory risk involved,
there are critical contingencies defined in the
loan docs that give the bank an out for material
misstatements by the company in its reported
financials.  In particular, the loan documents
state:


 18.12   Original Financial Statements

Securities Law
Violation/Conflict of Interest  
– Part 1: Tianfu Yang’s personal
loan from Harbin
 


In the 10-K we read an interesting disclosure: 


"On December 28, 2010, the Company made an
advance of $1,517,000 to Tai Fu Industrial Co., Ltd.,
an entity owned by Tianfu Yang, the Company’s
Chairman. The purpose of the advance was to
accommodate an urgent cash need of a transaction for
this related entity under a guarantee to repay the
Company within a few days.  As of December 31,
2010, the money was repaid in full."


This disclosure brings up several issues that
should be troubling to all investors:


Why does another entity
belonging to the CEO have an
“urgent cash need”?
Why does Tianfu Yang not have
$1.5 million in cash to give to
the other entity?  Isn’t that odd
for someone proposing to sign
personally for a $400 million
loan?
This transaction appears to be
a clear violation of Sarbanes
Oxley.  As clearly stated in
section 402 from Sarbanes
Oxley:


SEC. 402. ENHANCED CONFLICT OF
INTEREST PROVISIONS.


(a) PROHIBITION ON PERSONAL LOANS
TO EXECUTIVES.—Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15
U.S.C. 78m), as amended by this Act, is
amended by adding at the end the
following:
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 10/22


‘‘(k) PROHIBITION ON PERSONAL LOANS
TO EXECUTIVES.—


‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—It shall be unlawful
for any issuer (as de�ned in section 2 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002),
 directly or indirectly, including through
any subsidiary, to extend or maintain
credit, to arrange for the extension of
credit, or to renew an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to
or for any director or executive o�cer
(or equivalent thereof) of that issuer.


.


Was the loan actually repaid?  Is it odd to take
an "urgent cash need" loan out on Tuesday,
only to pay it back on a Friday?  Who
accounted for the reconciliation of the loan? 
Was it paid back in full in cash on that stated
date?  Or was this a postdated transaction that
involved an “in kind” repayment at a later date
so the company did not have to take the charge
before the quarter ended ?  Or are we
supposed to believe the repayment just
coincidentally fell on the last day of the
quarter?


Additionally, it was previously reported on by
Citron that in the past that CEO Tianfu Yan and
his brother Harbin Vice President Tianli Yang
were previously obligated to make a civil
settlement of a charge of misappropriation of
funds and falsification of a bank loan document
at a prior company.  While these facts do not
prove fraud in Harbin, it does go to character. 
  


Harbin responded to this finding, not by
disproving or even denying their legal
wrongdoings, but rather by claiming that Tianli
Yang is not a director of Harbin as Citron
stated.  Just to prove the thoroughness of the
work, here is a document that proves in fact
that Tianli Yang is on record as a director of
Harbin.

 Securities Law
Violation/Conflict of Interest –
Part 2:  
Boyd Plowman’s role in Abax
and the Harbin Special
Committee
 


 


Aside from Harbin’s CEO, the most important
man in this process has become Boyd
Plowman.  Mr. Plowman is both head of the
audit committee of Harbin, as well as the
appointed head of the special committee to
take the company private.  This committee is at
the center of the requirement that the interests
of shareholders be defended.  It is under his
watch that we are to trust both Harbin’s
financials, and the fairness of the process by
which the “takeover” transaction proceeds. 


However, the July 13, 2011 proxy statement
filing is the first time investors are informed of
the following :


“Shortly after Abax filed a Schedule 13G with the SEC
on December 9, 2010 announcing its greater than 5%
ownership of the Company common stock, Mr.
Plowman, the Special Committee Chair, brought to the
attention of the other members of Special Committee,
as well as to Gibson Dunn, the fact that he was then
serving as a director of several Abax-controlled
entities including Abax Global Opportunities Fund,
Abax Arhat Fund, Abax Claremont Ltd., Abax Jade
Ltd., Abax Emerald Ltd., Abax Lotus Ltd., Abax
Nai Xin A Ltd., and Abax Nai Xin B Ltd. (the “Abax
Companies”).”


This relationship presents many conflicts of
interest among shareholders / Harbin / Boyd

5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 12/22


Plowman that the SEC cannot ignore. 


1. #1.  On July 29, 2010, just
before all the buyout drama
began, Abax Emerald loaned
Harbin $15 million at a 10%
interest rate.  This would be a
related party transaction, since
the head of the audit committee
is a director of Abax Emerald. 
Worse, you would think the head
of the audit committee would
know better than to fail to
 disclose this relationship.  The
above-market interest rate alone
gives rise to the question of
whether preference was granted
to a related party.


2. #2.  Reading the language in the
filing, we are to believe that no
one on the special committee
ever knew that Plowman was
associated with Abax?   Does this
pass the smell test?


3. #3.   It has never been disclosed
how much financial interest
Plowman has in Abax.  Nor have
been disclosed other relationships
with directors of Abax, such as
this investment company we
found called Kilometre Growth,
where Plowman is a director
along with other Abax directors. 
Why are these matters
undisclosed in HRBN's SEC filings?


http://www.formds.com/issuers/kilometre-
growth-asia-fund
[http://www.formds.com/issuers/kilometre-
growth-asia-fund]


Citron is amazed that Gibson Dunn did not find
conflict in this relationship and that the SEC
can authorize this deal without greater
transparency of the Abax/Plowman



http://www.formds.com/issuers/kilometre-growth-asia-fund
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 13/22


relationship.  This might be the first time in the
history of takeovers that the head of the
special committee formed to oversee the
sale of a company is actually a director of
the acquiring entity.


Citron also notes the numerous times
Plowman’s bio appears in Harbin’s filings; yet
not once does it mention his directorship in
Abax funds; this despite Abax’s high profile in
the China investment scene following Morgan
Stanley’s major stake in the fund in 2007. 


   Disclosures that the SEC
Cannot Ignore
While the Special Committee was busy talking
to the white shoe lawyers and bankers about a
deal, the most reprehensible disclosures we
have even seen in a public company were filed
in the HRBN 10-K.  The disclosures are
regarding Simo Motor, the largest subsidiary of
HRBN, purchased in 2009 and "restructured" in
2010, at a cost of over $25 million, to integrate
it into Harbin just last year.  We note that these
disclosures did not exist when HRBN purchased
Simo. 


“We and our independent registered public accounting
firm, in connection with management's assessment of
and the audit of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010, identified five
material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting…


Control activities related to bank reconciliation – At
Xi’an Simo, the bank reconciliation for various bank
accounts were not prepared accurately, which
impacted the valuation and existence of the cash in
bank as of December 31, 2010.


Control activities related to the reconciliation and
classification of notes receivable – At Xi’an Simo,
notes receivables endorsed as payment to third parties
were not properly recorded, resulting in a discrepancy
between the physical notes receivables on hand and
the general ledger. Additionally, the improper
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 14/22


classifications of transactions has impacted the
completeness, and valuation of accounts payable /
advance to suppliers and notes receivable balances at
the year ended December 31, 2010 at Xi’an Simo


Control activities related to the calculation of provision
of income tax – At Xi’an Simo, due to ambiguities in
the PRC tax rules, the temporary and permanent
differences in tax amounts were not properly identified


Control activities related to valuation of inventory
allowance – At Xi’an Simo, slow moving inventories
that had not been used over a year were not properly
evaluated for inventory allowance.


Control activities related to inventory recording –– At
Xi’an Simo, inventory movement between
manufacturing facilities and sales entities were not
timely and properly recorded on the general ledger.


It is especially astonishing how Simo Motors,
Harbin's largest and highest visibility
acquisition, has severe management control
problems in every single verifiable part of
this business:  cash reconciliation, tax filings,
payables, receivables, and inventory
valuation.  And as has been previously
documented in text and video ( view here
[https://www.vimeo.com/23282580] if you
haven't seen it already), Simo Motors main
physical plant is an antiquated 50 year old
facility, with severe lack of automation of its
manufacturing capabilities, requiring tens of
millions of dollars in retooling and capital
improvements required to to be competitive
in its space.


With all the money being spent on consultants,
why wouldn’t Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
or Lazard recommend a new, independent
forensic accountant to run these material
weaknesses to ground before any deal closes? 


   Forensic Analysis
Because we knew that HRBN directors would
not hire a forensic accountant to go through

their current operations, we hired one
ourselves to present a financial analysis of
HRBN.  As noted, every potential financial
acquirer walked away from this deal…maybe
they saw what our forensic accountant
projected.

   Cannot be Said Too Many
Times:  Frazer Frost
Anyone following the China RTO drama is well
aware of the notorious audit firm Frazer Frost,
which occupies a unique spot in the history of
this sector.  After all, Frazer Frost is the only
auditor sued by the SEC during this entire
China RTO fiasco.  Citron is actually in
competition with Frazer Frost — they have as
many halts as we do over the past 7 months.

“Moore Stephens Wurth Frazer Torbet, LLP and Frost,
PLLC are moving to resume operations as separate
entities, as existed prior to their combination in January
2010. The combined firm, Frazer Frost, LLP, will
continue to exist as a legal entity until the separation
has been completed. It continues to be the policy of
both firms not to comment publicly on client,
personnel, or other internal matters.”


“Frazer Frost”, the auditor of record for Harbin’s
10-K, doesn’t actually exist any more. (Citron
especially appreciates this website. 
http://www.frazerfrost.com/

investors will see if anyone ever tries to hold
the auditor accountable for the annual financial

Formed of a merger in early 2010, Frazer Frost
was dissolved in the wake of the SEC suit for
having accepted management’s assurances in
lieu of its own verification in the case of China
Energy Savings Technology.  Then came the
exposure and delisting of RINO, whose
management admitted it had fabricated
revenues based on non-existent contractual
relationships with large customers, again
assumed valid by the same audit firm.  


With all the firepower of assembled consultants
for this deal :  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
Ernst & Young, Lazard, Skadden Arps, Gibson
Dunn,  and White & Case, all with their hand in
the till for the deal, nobody has demanded the
hiring of a forensic auditor to finally lay out a
full and fair accounting of the entire company
for all investors to see what’s going on.  The
only numbers available are Frazer Frost’s.


   A 500 Page Proxy Statement,
but 
Nobody Has Done Their
Homework
 


Lets see what all these high-priced consultants
didn’t do.


Morgan Stanley:


“In arriving at its opinion, Morgan
Stanley assumed and relied upon,
without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to
Morgan Stanley by the Company, and
formed a substantial basis for its opinion.
With respect to the April 2011 Case,
Morgan Stanley assumed that they had
been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company of the
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 17/22


future financial performance of the
Company.”


Lazard:


“Lazard assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the
foregoing information, without
independent verification of such
information. Lazard did not conduct any
independent valuation or appraisal of any
of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of the Company, or
concerning the solvency or fair value of
the Company, and Lazard was not
furnished with any such valuation or
appraisal.”


Goldman:


Mr. Tianfu Yang did not request, and
Goldman Sachs did not provide, at
any time, any opinion to the parties
as to the fairness of the $24.00 offer
price or as to any valuation of the
Company for the purpose of assessing
the fairness of such offer price. Goldman
Sachs was not requested to, and did not,
recommend at any time the specific
consideration payable in the proposed
merger, which $24.00 consideration was
communicated by Mr. Tianfu Yang to
Goldman Sachs and subsequently was
determined by negotiations between the
Special Committee and Mr. Tianfu Yang
and Abax, and as a result, the
Company’s decision to enter into the
merger agreement was solely that of the
Special Committee and the Company’s
board of directors.


(Goldman apparently did not assist
Tianfu Yang in the negotiations for a
$400 million dollar bank loan either.) 


Audit Committee:


“Members of the Audit Committee rely
without independent verification on
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 18/22


the information provided to them
and on the representations made by
management and the independent
accountants. Accordingly, the Audit
Committee’s oversight does not provide
an independent basis to determine that
management has maintained appropriate
accounting and financial reporting
principles or appropriate internal control
and procedures designed to assure
compliance with accounting standards
and applicable laws and regulations.
Furthermore, the Audit Committee’s
consideration and discussions referred to
above do not assure that the audit of the
Company’s financial statements has been
carried out in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles or that
the Company’s auditors are in fact
“independent”.”


And finally, Citron notes that all the
negotiations with China Development Bank
were conducted personally by Tianfu Yang,
despite his having retained the world's pre-
eminent investment banker as his personal
advisor. 


    The Silence of the Buyers is
Overwhelming
This company was left at the altar by Barings.  Worse,
they were left at the altar by 73 potential strategic and
�nancial bidders, who were o�ered a look at this
company.   Only 3 bothered to execute an NDA, and
not one o�ered a competing bid.


The industry has spoken.  The lack of
enthusiasm for this deal speaks volumes.
Initially the deal was to be funded by Goldman
Sachs and Barings.  After they walked away,
Morgan Stanley shopped for buyers.  Of the 73
potential bidders they bought to the table

http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 19/22


(41were strategic), only 3 strategic ones even
asked for an NDA. 


For a company who is supposed to be a leader
in the Chinese motor industry it is obvious that
their industry does not even find them
significant enough to sign an NDA.  The
complete lack of interest in the deal from all
parties that were brought to the table by
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley affirms to
ridiculous nature of this alleged buyout.  This
demonstrates that not only does Citron view
Harbin with skepticism, but it has no credibility
with any serious competitor in the space.


   Breaking Up Is Hard to Do
Deals of this size typically have breakup fees
attached.  These are intended to provide a
measure of assurance to investors, who have
the most to lose if it fails, or the spurned buyer,
for all their wasted expense and effort if a
better suitor comes along. 


But like every aspect of this proposed deal, the
breakup fees are a story of their own. 


Consider:


If the company breaks up the
merger, it owes the buyer group,
90% of which is Chairman Tianfu
Yang $22.5 million.
If the buyers group fails to
conclude the merger, the buyer
group jointly (but not jointly and
severally) is obligated to pay the
company a $30 million breakup
fee.


Since, in neither of these cases, is any cash
pledged to back these guarantees, these
failsafe provisions, customarily structured to
protect the unaffiliated security holders from a
broken deal, result only in scenarios where the
Chairman has to sue his company or the
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 20/22


company has to sue its Chairman, for
enforcement of the "guarantee". 


   The Significance of the SEC in
this process
The entire proxy and Form 13E-3 is now
submitted and under review by the SEC for
comments and questions.  At a time when both
US officials and Chinese officials are working
towards the goal of reliable and transparent
disclosures from Chinese listed companies, this
filing is a major step in the wrong direction. 


The next step in this process is an anticipated
set of questions and comments from the SEC,
due within 30 days of the SC 13E3 filing date,
July 13, 2011.  This report will shed light on
numerous issues that should be of substantial
concern to the SEC, as noted in the next
section.


Where the market has done an efficient job in
flushing out Chinese RTOs and other equities
with unreliable accounting, the notion of hiring
a team of lawyers to prop of a company with
questionable financials, reconciled by non
existent auditing firm is a dangerous blueprint
for other Chinese companies to inflate their
stock while management could possibly be
selling stock into a bidding market.  Chinese
nationals in management positions, insulated
as they are from any enforcement of US
securities law can easily orchestrate the whole
process.  Therefore the SEC is a gatekeeper on
a set of market integrity concerns which stretch
far beyond the current Harbin drama.


   Proof that Tianfu Yang has NO
INTENTION of Concluding the
Proposed $24 Buyout of Harbin
Electric
 


It's really quite simple.  If Tianfu Yang wanted
to buy Harbin Electric he would have taken a
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric – Completely Exposed – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-completely-exposed/ 21/22


different path.  He knew Simo's cash couldn't
be reconciled.  He knew his gross margins from
his antiquated factories couldn't possibly be
double or triple any of his competitors.  He
knew the sales to disclosed major customers
were false.  More than anyone, he knows that
the company keeps consuming cash, despite
the profitable financial statements and
projections.


ALL he had to do was declare non-reliance on
the filed audited financial reports.  He would
have disclosed all the internal weaknesses in
the company, and gone through restatements. 
He would have hired a forensic auditor, and
would be able to buy the entire company for
possibly under $5.00 a share.  He knew all of
this and knows it today.  


For less than 25% of the pricetag of the
financing he's purportedly arranged, he and a
group of colleagues could have bought 100%
control of the business completely legally and
swiftly.  In fact, as his advisors, Goldman Sachs
would have been remiss to the point of
negligence had they not so advised.  Why has
nobody advised calling in a forensic
accountant? 


Caveat emptor.


   Conclusion
In reviewing the preponderance of evidence
presented in this and previous Citron reports on
Harbin, it is the unequivocal opinion of this
writer that CEO Tianfu Yang does not want this
deal to go through.  He alone knows what his
company is truly worth, and he knows about
the overstatement of revenues.  The last thing
he wants is to be on the hook for a $400 million
loan for a company that only made .16 cents
last quarter, even considering its highly suspect
accounting.  Mr. Yang was able to procure a
boilerplate loan doc; Citron believes it was
competently prepared, but it will never be
executed.
