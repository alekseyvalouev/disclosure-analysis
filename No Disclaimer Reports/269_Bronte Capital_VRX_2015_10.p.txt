Valeant Pharmaceuticals: some comments
Mike Pearson - the CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals - released a letter in response to recent stock
price falls. You can find the letter in an SEC filed 8-K. The letter was released before yesterdays 16.5
percent fall. 
 
In the letter they state that [Valeant] "expect the Salix business to represent approximately 20% of our
2016 revenue and expect double-digit script growth and corresponding revenue growth trends to
continue". 
 
This surprised me. Valeant sales are over $10 billion per annum. They were 2.695 billion in the last
quarter (including sales from Salix). 
 
If organic sales growth is 20 percent and the sales grow double-digit then Salix sales should be at
least $2.2 billion during 2016. 
 
During the last year Salix was a public company (2014) Salix revenues were $1.13 billion. 
 
I guess they can square this circle with massive price increases for Salix products. However in the
same letter Mike Pearson denies that Valeant's growth is dependent on price increases for
pharmaceuticals. 
 
Mr Mike Pearson, I do not believe you. 
 
What would make Mr Pearson more plausible? 
 
There are numerous instances where I have found myself disbelieving Valeant's numbers and PR
spin. If you want a really good analysis read AZ Value's wonderful blog. However I keep coming down
to people and their personal credibility. You catch way too many strange, even implausible numbers at
Valeant. 
 
And there are reasons to distrust the people more generally. 
 
It would be better if the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of the board did not have close
association with past securities frauds. Let me introduce you to Norma Provencio. 
 
Ms Provencio is founder of Provencio Advisory Services, a healthcare consultancy.  Ms Provencio
has been involved with Valeant for some time. She was on the board of legacy Valeant and signed the
original offer letter to Mike Pearson in 2008.

Searching the SEC database for "Provencio Advisory Services" not in reference to Valeant turns up a
relationship with Signalife (aka Heart Tronics) back in 2007:

.htm (p. 19) 
 
And if we go way back, it turns out she participated in the same financing for a predecessor company
to Signalife, Recom Managed Services, as an attorney named Mitchell Stein in 2003:

"On May 15, 2003, we completed the first tranche of a private placement pursuant to which we sold
82,667 units to Mr. Mitchell Stein, SJ Investments and Ms. Norma Provencio at $3 per unit for cash
amounting to $248,000. Each unit consisted of one common share and one warrant. Each warrant is
exercisable at $3 until May 14, 2004. Upon exercise of the warrants each investor will receive one
common share and an additional warrant to purchase one common share $6 per share until

November 15, 2004." 
 
Ms Provencio was a director of Signalife (aka Heart Tronics), which is not mentioned in her official
Valeant biography.  This is a worrisome omission. 
 
Mitchell Stein, the controlling shareholder and Provencio's co-investor got into a bit of trouble and is
now serving a lengthy prison sentence.

http://www.justice.gov/criminal/vns/caseup/steinm.html 
 
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22204.htm 
 
Here's a mention (including an email from Provencio) in a filing by the defendant Mitchell Stein in his
sentencing hearing, claiming that she knew about the transactions at issue: 
 
http://www.freemitchellstein.com/MTC.pdf 
 
Ms Provencio wasn't charged, but she was involved since the early days of the company, coming in
alongside its principal mastermind and serving as a Director, Audit Chair, and consultant.  
 
This seems like a meaningful omission from her biography and raises questions about her suitability
as audit chair for a company as complex and acquisitive as Valeant. 
 
We do not have any affidavits Ms Provencio made in her defence in the Signalife matters - though we
have affidavits from other board members who ran the defence that Mr Stein controlled all aspects of
Signalife and hence they (as directors) were not responsible. [Kindly this is the "asleep at the wheel"
defence.] 
 
Ms Provencio was also in the board of International Aluminum Corp, which went bankrupt at some
point back in the mid-2000s (and is not mentioned either). 
 
Approach to relevant Congressional staffers 
 
There is discussion in the news about Valeant possibly receiving subpoenas concerning drug price
hikes. 
 
If the congressional staffers concerned want more material on Valeant which helps them target their
subpoenas then I can offer some low-level assistance.
