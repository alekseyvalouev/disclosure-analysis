BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike?
Dec. 2, 2014 1:55 PM ET35 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


We found a presentation that sheds light on BOFI's lending activities. As a result, we
believe the market is meaningfully underestimating the regulatory and credit risk in
BOFI's loan book.


We view the HRB transaction delay as an early sign of regulators taking a harder
look at BOFI’s business practices.


Our research points to potential management and organizational credibility issues
(including: potential CEO resume embellishment, recent auditor change, recent
resignation of key officers, and potential disclosure issues).


We see ~65%+ downside in the stock.


Overview


Sandler O'Neill had Bank of the Internet (NASDAQ:BOFI) management on the road in
November to meet with institutional investors
Following these meetings, Sandler published a note on 11/24/14 stating that
"management's biggest concern right now is regulatory risk"… We Agree
We found a presentation through a web search (the presentation was put together by
an Account Executive at BOFI and provided to Crossline Capital ) that provides details
about BOFI's high risk lending activities
Our research also suggests that there may be a persistent culture of aggressive
lending standards within the Account Executive ranks at BOFI
We view the October 2014 H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) transaction delay as an early sign
of regulators taking a harder look at BOFI's business practices
We believe that the market has completely missed the heightened risk present in
BOFI's loan book as a result of weak disclosure in BOFI's public filings and we believe
that in 1QF15 (CY 3Q14) we saw the first signs of weakness in BOFI's loan book
(delinquent loan balances doubled between 6/30/14 and 9/30/14)
We also believe that CEO Greg Garrabrants may have misrepresented his work
experience in his official BOFI biography, which if true calls into question his credibility

We see signs of potential issues in the company's accounting organization. BOFI's
Chief Accounting Officer resigned in May 2013 and at around the same time BOFI
changed its auditor from Crowe Horwath to BDO USA
Based on our review of the above presentation, we have questions about how BOFI is
calculating the LTVs and FICOs it reports to the market
We think that BOFI is taking outsized regulatory and credit risks. We also think that
BOFI may be under-reserving against future losses. Finally, we have concerns around
the bank's financial disclosures and accounting practices
We see ~65% downside in BOFI's stock price (based on a target price of 1x TBV) as
we expect NIM compression, potential regulatory intervention, as well as a re-rating of
the multiple to levels more appropriate for a bank of this risk profile


"No Job, No Income, No Problem"


Our focus in this article is on the asset side of BOFI's balance sheet as well as on the
management team at BOFI. Previous research reports have already called out the
interest rate risk at BOFI as well as the risks associated with BOFI's potential foray into
prepaid cards (see: Seeking Alpha, Kerrisdale, and Citron).
Our research points to signs that the lending culture at BOFI is "aggressive." In
addition to the correspondent presentation we found above, we also found an article
dating back to 2011 in which a BOFI Account Executive was accused of using the
phrase "No Job, No Income, No Problem" in a marketing email
When asked to comment on the language used by the Account Executive, Garrabrants
said that it is "the complete opposite of who we [BOFI] are"
However, our research suggests that BOFI's Account Executives continue to employ
aggressive marketing and underwriting tactics. In addition to the March 2014 dated
presentation we found online, we reviewed LinkedIn profiles for multiple current BOFI
Account Executives and provide excerpts from their profiles below:
"I simplify Niche Jumbo lending for Mortgage Bankers and Brokers so they can fund
more deals and get paid more often"
"We offer aggressive non-QM options",
One Account Executive indicated that BOFI could ""create" monthly income for all or
part of a borrower's qualifying income" (we did not add the quotes around the word
create)
In our opinion, BOFI's underwriting standards appear to be lacking discipline as
evidenced by the bank's willingness to extend credit to borrowers including foreign
nationals who lack historical tax returns and credit scores, as well as borrowers who
have blemished credit histories (foreclosures, short sales, and bankruptcies)

While the Street applauds BOFI's outperformance relative to peers, our research
suggests that the primary driving factor of BOFI's outperformance versus peers are its
high risk loans. Despite the riskiness of its loan portfolio, BOFI's loan loss reserves are
amongst the lowest of any bank we surveyed
Management has spent the last few quarters convincing the investment community
that the reason for BOFI's outperformance versus peers is its efficient "internet model"
However, this claim does not explain how BOFI's net interest margin is so far ahead of
its peers. Keep in mind that branchless banks such as BOFI have to generally pay
more for deposits than traditional banks, meaning that all-else equal, branchless banks
should have lower NIMs but are able to offset their structurally lower NIMs through
superior efficiency ratios versus their traditional banking peers
Many BOFI bulls view BOFI as an "internet name" that is deserving of an "internet
multiple" (some bulls have referred to BOFI as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix
(NASDAQ:NFLX), or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of the bank industry - we find this view
comical given that virtually every bank in the U.S. has offered robust internet banking
tools for the past decade!)


Lending Guidelines - "90% LTV Loans" at "680 FICOs…but we're flexible!"


In regards to BOFI's underwriting standards, we found a document online that BOFI
provided to one of its mortgage correspondents (the presentation was previously
available through this link (now dead) on Crossline Capital's website…we have
provided a live link to the original presentation here and have also provided a link to
our Bing search for the file here … the search result remains live as of this publishing
The authenticity of the presentation can be confirmed through a quick LinkedIn search
for the publisher of the document
While former Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke is struggling to refinance his home
loan, BOFI is "willing to be flexible" in its loans to foreign nationals, including
"accepting letters of employment translated into English by certified translators" (their
words, not ours!)
BOFI regularly highlights its marketing partnership with Costco (NASDAQ:COST). We
believe that BOFI's COST originated loans are likely all sold to agencies and therefore
are not at all reflective of the "portfolio loans" BOFI actually holds on balance sheet
Based on our review of the presentation, we understand that BOFI is open to
underwriting high-risk loans including, but not limited to, loans to foreign nationals
(including foreign nationals that lack verified historical tax returns), jumbo loans to
retirees that are based on retirement savings rather than current income (i.e., a jumbo
home loan to a 73-year-old who is unable to qualify for a loan based on current income

but has retirement savings that BOFI uses to "synthetically create" income), and loans
to borrowers with a history of foreclosure and bankruptcy
We note that foreign national loans are subject to potential fraud and "know your
customer" risks, and loans to borrowers who fail to qualify based on verifiable income
are subject to potential violations and penalties associated with originating non-QM
loans and violating the ability-to-repay rule
BOFI originates its loans through the wholesale channel and as a result of its
"branchless" business model is unlikely to truly "know its customers" in the way a
traditional bank would… despite the risks associated with buying loans through the
wholesale channel, BOFI writes gigantic home loans, often well in excess of $1 million,
meaning that it will only take a few bad loans for asset problems to emerge at the bank
Loan delinquencies picked up meaningfully in the most recently reported quarter yet
BOFI continues to reserve for loan losses at one of the lowest rates of any bank in the
U.S.
The presentation also suggests that BOFI is open to making large loans on second
and third homes to individuals (the presentation seems to suggest BOFI has "no limit
to the number of financed properties" a borrower may have). These types of loans
carry potentially higher risk of becoming non-performing because the underlying
borrowers have multiple mortgages to support
BOFI also appears open to lending to individuals with historical credit issues
(bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.)
Finally, we are surprised at BOFI's willingness to test CFPB ability-to-repay rules with
"at-risk" groups such as retirees (illustrated in the underwriting example BOFI provides
of lending to a 73-year-old seeking to use liquid retirement savings to fund the loan as
a result of having insufficient income to qualify)
Per BSN Law: "It is important to note that for non-QM loans, a lender may find it very
difficult to avoid a trial if compliance with the repay test is raised, since such
compliance is very much fact specific. Therefore, a judge will be disinclined to grant a
motion for a summary judgment without first hearing all of the evidence regarding the
underwriting of the loan and the borrower's particular situation. This may increase the
likelihood that failure to comply with the ATR test will be routinely raised in disputes
with mortgagors, and will also increase the likelihood that lenders will want to settle
before the expense of an evidentiary trial is incurred"
Not only are there potential regulatory issues associated with this type of lending, but
BOFI does not appear to have any escrow rights to the assets used to "create the
income" for the loan, enhancing the risk that such loans could end up non-performing

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 5/31


The evidence of BOFI's outsized risk taking is clear in its asset yields and in its overall
best-in-class return on assets (two charts below illustrate this point)…BOFI earns a
massive premium in its loan book relative to peers (generating over 5.0% returns on its
loans  which are predominantly jumbo 5/1 ARMs versus peers that earn between 3.0%
and 3.5% on average in jumbo 5/1 ARMs)
We note that BOFI earns over 5% on its loan assets which are predominantly single
family mortgages, versus internet bank peers such as EVER and ALLY that earn
~3.75% in their single family books, and First Republic (NYSE:FRC) which earns
~3.5% in its single family residential book
We think it is wrong to compare a branchless internet bank such as BOFI to a highly
esteemed private bank such as FRC. We cite FRC as an example only because BOFI
management recently claimed BOFI has a superior product offering to FRC on an
earnings call
A quick review of Bankrate.com's mortgage tables will show that jumbo 5/1 ARM rates
are as low as 2.75% to 3.0% in some parts of the country, indicating BOFI's yields are
off the charts
While BOFI management claims that its loans are high quality and low risk, its massive
rate premium versus its peers would suggest otherwise… in fact, it would suggest
BOFI is taking on risks that other banks are simply unwilling to underwrite, yet is
reserving against future loan losses at rates far below other banks. This dynamic is
even more surprising to us in light of the fact that BOFI is growing it loan book at the
incredible pace of >60% y/y!
Even the CEO of Ocwen Financial (OCN), which faced its own regulatory scrutiny,
rejected the idea of playing in the non-QM space that BOFI specializes in, saying on a
recent conference call:
"Let me state that we have no interest in originating non-QM loans, given the penalties
that the originator could incur."
Based on BOFI's "outlier" asset yield reported in its SEC filings, we believe
substantially all of the loans held on balance sheet fit into these high risk non-QM
categories
We wonder why the Board has not taken a harder look at the loans BOFI is
underwriting and the reserves the bank is taking against these loans
We also believe that the company should take immediate steps to enhance its public
disclosures regarding these loans
We reviewed BOFI's financial statements from the past several years, and also looked
through conference call transcripts from the last several quarters and could find no

mention of the risks associated with BOFI's non-QM lending, or even any mention that
BOFI engages in non-QM lending
The charts below summarize the "too good to be true" nature of BOFI's business
model; despite having a best-in-class return on assets as a result of its high risk
lending, BOFI has one of the lowest reserve ratios of any bank in the United States:


Despite management's assertion that BOFI underwrites low loan-to-value loans of
under 60% and borrowers with ~716 FICO scores, the presentation we found suggests
that BOFI is underwriting loans at up to 90% loan-to-value ratios through its
"pledged asset program", and is also underwriting borrowers with FICO scores of
680 or lower (both far lower metrics than the averages management quotes on
earnings calls)
Based on the language in the deck, BOFI appears willing to go even lower than 680
FICOs… we note that these scores are far lower than the 700 level that Experian
claims usually reflect "good credit management"
We were also surprised to read that BOFI allows "anyone to pledge assets on behalf of
the borrower"
We note that while the presentation we found mentions that BOFI offers "pledged
collateral loans" at up to 90% LTVs in numerous instances, BOFI's 10-K from FY2014
suggests that under 1% of BOFI's home loan balance outstanding consisted of loans
with >80% LTVs…

We therefore wonder whether BOFI's financials accurately reflect the credit
quality (LTVs and FICOs) of its loan book…
We hope that in the future BOFI will provide enhanced detail in its financial reports,
including the segmentation of its loans (QM vs. non-QM, types of non-QM etc.),
enhanced clarity on LTVs, and enhanced clarity on borrower credit worthiness
Direct excerpts of BOFI's underwriting guidelines are provided below:

Potential Management and Organizational Credibility Issues


We believe that CEO Greg Garrabrants may have misrepresented his work experience
in his official BOFI biography (found here), which if true calls into question his
credibility in managing a highly regulated entity such as a bank
Based on our review of BOFI CEO Greg Garrabrants' official biography, we believe
that he may have misrepresented his work experience by claiming to have practiced
law at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and at Munger, Tolles & Olson
As readers will recall, Scott Thompson was forced out as CEO of Yahoo (YHOO) after
falsely claiming a Computer Science degree in his biography on the company's
website
We think that this potential discrepancy could be a concern given that the company's
website is picked up by SEC filings and CEOs are required to sign off on SEC filings
Our research suggests that Garrabrants' bar license (and ability to practice law / refer
to himself as an attorney) was only active from June 2001 to January 2002
We confirmed that Garrabrants was employed as a clerk for the Honorable Steven
Wilson from August 2000 until August 2001 (confirmed through a phone call to Judge
Wilson's office)
After completing his federal clerkship in August 2001, we believe that he went to work
at McKinsey in September 2001, pointing to the extremely low likelihood that he could
have worked as a practicing lawyer at either Skadden or Munger during the ~6-7
month period his bar license was active. We therefore believe that his claim that he
practiced law at both of these firms appears to be untrue
In our view, Garrabrants is potentially aware of the inconsistencies in his official
company biography as evidenced by the fact that he utilizes two distinct versions of his

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 11/31


biography - one version on BOFI's website (that has been picked up in the broader
media), and a different version in SEC proxy filings
While in his official BOFI biography on the company's website Garrabrants purports to
have been an attorney at Skadden and Munger, the term "attorney" is notably
missing in the biography Garrabrants provided to the SEC for use in BOFI's
most recent proxy
See the Appendix at the bottom of this article for a side-by-side comparison
A quick search on the CFA Institute website also suggests that Garrabrants is
potentially unable to claim the CFA Charterholder designation (which he includes in
both versions of his biography)
Finally, we note that BOFI's Chief Accounting Officer left in May 2013. BOFI never
hired a replacement for this role, instead appointing current CFO Andrew Micheletti to
the role of Chief Accounting Officer
We find it surprising that despite serving as the active Chief Accounting Officer at
BOFI, Micheletti's CPA charter appears to be inactive. He may potentially be breaching
California Accounting Board protocol by failing to specify that his license is inactive in
his bio
Right around the time that BOFI's Chief Accounting Officer resigned, BOFI changed its
auditor from Crowe Horwath to BDO USA… we think that the CAO resignation and
auditor change raise potential questions around what is going on with BOFI's
accounting organization…
BOFI's COO also resigned in January 2014 and we found no indication that BOFI hired
a replacement
We note BOFI loan growth appears to have kicked into "hyper-drive" right after the
CAO resignation and auditor change. Therefore, a significant chunk of BOFI's loans
are still unseasoned and in the "too early to tell" credit quality bucket. Bulls who rely on
historical net charge off data are missing that BOFI's loan growth has been so robust
recently that historical charge offs are likely to have poor predictive value
Furthermore, BOFI's reserve ratio has been moving down since the shakeup in the
accounting group despite BOFI's 62% y/y loan growth. This relationship makes
absolutely no sense to us. As a reminder, reserve ratios are calculated by taking
expected future losses on loans divided by the current size of the loan book. In the
case of BOFI, the denominator (loan book) is clearly growing, meaning that
management is implicitly assuming that its newer loans carry less future risk based on
its decision to take its reserve ratio metric down. Given the nature of BOFI's loans
highlighted in this note, we have a hard time believing this reserve policy is appropriate

Connections to Troubled Banks & Stock Promoters and Potential Related Party
Questions


We note that the BOFI management team has deep ties to troubled banks, including
Chief Lending Officer Brian Swanson (formerly Indymac), Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Micheletti (formerly Imperial Savings), and of course Greg Garrabrants himself
(formerly Indymac). Our review of LinkedIn profiles suggests other members of the
bank were formerly at Indymac as well
Both Garrabrants and Swanson obscured Indymac on their resumes, with Garrabrants
referring to it as the "7th largest thrift" in his bio, and Swanson referring to it as "a top 5
mortgage lender"
We note that while BOFI sports an impressive >$1B market capitalization today and is
covered by firms such as FBR, KBW, Sandler O'Neill, and Raymond James, the
company appears to have been an off-the-radar microcap stock just last year
In fact, as recently as 2013, Greg Garrabrants was out promoting BOFI through
Tobin Smith's penny stock website (see this interview between Tobin Smith and
Greg Garrabrants). We note that Tobin Smith was fired from his job at Fox News a
few months after his interview with Garrabrants for taking payments from microcap
companies to pump their stocks…
For readers who are interested, Tobin Smith was recently mentioned at an investor
conference in Chicago

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 13/31


Our research also suggests that there may be potential undisclosed related party
dealings between BOFI and one of its largest shareholders
The shareholder in question states that he owns Westlake Financial, which is listed as
a BOFI distribution partner in public presentations on BOFI's investor relations website
Westlake Financial also appears to offer compensation to individuals who open new
accounts with BOFI (Netbank is a BOFI brand)
Despite what appear to be potential business dealings between Westlake Financial
and BOFI, there is no mention of any related party connections in BOFI's financial
filings, nor are there any mentions of related party connections in the shareholder's
13D filing
The shareholder in question also appears to have been the only non-insider who was
invited to participate in an October 2012 private convertible funding round
While we have found no definitive evidence of any wrongdoing, we do think that
enhanced disclosure around the relationship between the shareholder and BOFI could
potentially benefit investors
We also noticed that the bank had ~$10.9M of related party loans to principal officers
outstanding in FY2014 (collateralized by property). The interest earned by BOFI on
these home loans amounted to $141k in FY14, suggesting that the annual interest rate
on these loans to principal officers was only ~1.3%. We note that a 1.3% rate seems
very attractive relative to market rates for home loans, and even more attractive
relative to the 5%+ rates BOFI charges on its home loans


Summary and Price Target


In summary, we think BOFI's management team appears to have real credibility issues
In our opinion, BOFI is misrepresenting the types of loans it makes, under-reserving
against future loan losses, providing incomplete financial disclosures to investors, and
running an aggressive balance sheet in which loan growth is far outpacing deposit
growth
Some bulls on BOFI view the relatively light levels of insider selling (particularly by
Garrabrants) as a positive sign. We point readers to the case study of Indymac,
Garrabrants' former employer. The former CEO of Indymac famously did not sell stock
as subprime problems were brewing, and actually meaningfully increased his stock
holdings as late as February 2008 when subprime problems had already clearly
emerged… as a reminder, Indymac was ultimately one of the largest bank failures in
U.S. history
BOFI's non-QM loans are fraught with risk (particularly "ATR" risk which is difficult for
lenders to challenge in court)

5/19/2018 BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike? - BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOFI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 14/31


BOFI's reserves appear too low in context of the nature of its loans and its massive
loan growth and we expect a material downward revision to BOFI earnings as the loan
portfolio seasons, interest rates normalize to historical levels, and regulators potentially
step in to curtail the nature and pace of BOFI's loan growth
While we have focused on the asset side of BOFI's balance sheet risk in this note,
previous online commentators have highlighted the interest rate sensitivity risk in
BOFI's balance sheet (i.e., BOFI's outlier interest rate gap ratio)
The company also recently reported a loan-to-deposit ratio (a measure of risk and
liquidity) of over 120%, which puts BOFI on the extreme far end of the spectrum in
terms of loan-to-deposit ratios for California-based banks (the average California bank
has a 78% LTD ratio)
Despite our view that there are warning signs of aggressive accounting and regulatory
risks, BOFI continues to trade at an egregious bank multiple of ~3x TBV despite BOFI
having, in our view, a far higher risk business model than comparable banks that trade
at only half of BOFI's valuation
We find the recent strength in the stock perplexing in light of the October delay of the
H&R Block deposit transaction. Our concern is enhanced by statements at recent
Sandler O'Neill investor meetings in which management said that their biggest concern
right now is regulatory risk
We view the H&R Block delay as a sign that the regulators may be taking a harder
look at BOFI and its high-risk business model
We see substantial downside in the stock (~65%) as we believe that BOFI should
trade at a discount to thrift peers as a result of its risky loan book and interest rate risk.
We ascribe a value of 1x TBV to the stock (arriving at a price target of ~$27/share)
