NAII


Large insider of NAII has been accused by the SEC of manipulating NAII’s stock
price for a decade. He remains 20% of the float and has begun selling blocks.


This same insider just filed a form 144 after the close April 28th for the sale of
another 102,397 shares of NAII.


CarnoSyn is 20% of revenue and has been a large driver of earnings for 3 quarters.
We expect slowing growth and limited market share gains for CarnoSyn.


NAII is substantially overvalued and very near peak historical valuation. We feel
there is approximately 40% downside to NAII in the near term.


It's a tough industry

It's not their fault, but Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:NAII) is
a bad company because they are in a bad industry. The supplement industry is
notorious for one-hit wonder products that shine bright for a moment but ultimately
fizzle. The products that do stand the test of time are commoditized and typically low
margin.


A review of NAII's history tells a similar story. Since going public in 1987, they have had
a series of quick increases in revenue and earnings followed by steep declines. This
year they appear to be on pace for nearly $100mil in revenue but this has been done
before. In 2006, sales peaked at nearly $100mil before being nearly cut in half to
$55mil by 2011. They have made money and lost it many times throughout the years.


If anything can be said about the business model, one word that comes to mind is
inconsistency. A quick glance at a chart of their stock explains their history. Partially due
to the fact that the float is so low, approximately 4 million shares, the stock tends to
accelerate higher for very short periods only to be followed by precipitous declines.
We've spent hundreds of hours learning about this company to try and produce a full
picture of the company and their story. Is it different this time for NAII? Based on our
analysis, we don't think so.

At times, they have counted companies like Abbott Laboratories, Nestle Nutrition, Jenny
Craig and celebrities like Deepak Chopra as customers. Customers they ultimately were
not able to capitalize on and eventually lost. According to their recent 10-K, 80% of their
revenue is in private label contract manufacturing, most of which is for multi-level
marketers (i.e. Herbalife (HLF), which is not one of their customers). At least 59% of
their total revenue is to multi-level marketing companies. This portion of their
business has been fairly steady over the years but is very low margin because they are
simply manufacturing a product for someone else to sell.


Additionally, this business contains substantial concentration risk, as 43% of their total
revenue comes from just one customer. This one customer is a multi-level marketing
company called Juice Plus with a history of questionable business practices and
inflated claims. Juice Plus claims that taking their supplements are the "next best thing
to fruits and vegetables." They fund a children's health study that claims health benefits
to children who take their supplements. A UC Berkeley Wellness Letter described the
children's health study as "a cute marketing gimmick, but it isn't science." (Sales to their
largest customer, Juice Plus were 43% in their recent 10-K and 55% of sales this past
quarter).


The other 20% of their revenue is sales of a single commodity called beta-alanine,
which they market under the trade name CarnoSyn. CarnoSyn has been a large driver
of the company's earnings performance of late. It is a much higher margin portion of
their business but is certainly not new. They've been licensing the product for several
years and sales only recently accelerated when they ended their license agreement and
began selling the product directly themselves.


They have 34 patents on beta-alanine and have successfully defended them by taking
several competitors to court. However, we are concerned that the low hanging fruit on
CarnoSyn growth is nearing completion once they report the March (FQ3) quarter.
In the current quarter (FQ4 beginning April), they will be lapping against last year's sales
when they took over distribution. Additionally, 25 of their 34 patents on beta-alanine
expire next year and the strength of the patent portfolio is questionable in our view.


The bottom line is, we don't expect the kind of explosive earnings growth seen
over the past year in coming quarters and a sharp decline in earnings would not
be unlikely given the company's history.

First, let's start with some intriguing history regarding the manipulation of NAII…


SEC accuses NAII's largest shareholder of stock manipulation


On September 30th of last year, the SEC settled a case with one Edward T. Borg
"without him admitting or denying the findings" as often is the case in these matters. The
official title was, "In the Matter of Edward T. Borg and Brian J. Mulkeen" in which the
SEC describes a decade long attempt by Mr. Borg & Co. to manipulate the price of NAII
stock.


Ed Borg was the "owner, officer and registered representative" of a small broker-dealer
called All Funds, Inc. The SEC alleged that Mr. Borg manipulated the stock price of
NAII between 2001 and 2011. He did this through several avenues, including directing
trades in several customers' accounts and sometimes loading these accounts over 90%
with nothing but NAII stock, frequently on margin. In some cases, Borg would put the
stock in client accounts without even asking them. Clients would later discover he sold
off their other holdings to buy NAII until it was the only security they held. The SEC said
he executed 1,062 manipulative trades in NAII to make the stock look more liquid than
it actually was and to support the price.


The most egregious example of Borg's behavior may have been with one specific
customer who had been his client since 1992. This client retired in 2008 with a net worth
of $400k (her home and land) and $10k in yearly income. Borg had her sell all her fixed
income securities and purchased NAII. At that point, the only thing in her IRA was NAII,
a stock that has never paid a dividend. In another of her accounts, he purchased an
additional 53,220 shares of NAII, on margin, which represented 94% of her account
after liquidating her T-bills and most of her equity including blue chip companies like GE
(GE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).


At one point, Mr. Borg personally owned 22.5% of NAII stock and combined with
accounts, he controlled as much as 55% of outstanding shares. During this period
from 2003-2011, Borg never reported the holdings as is required by federal securities
laws. When he did finally file a 13G on March 9, 2012, he understated his ownership of
the stock. On August 23, 2001, Borg convinced Carl J. Terranova and the Trust of
Vincent Terranova (Controlled by Carl Terranova), owners of over 5% of the stock at the
time, to file a 13G. Borg was a trustee but did not sign the 13G, instead he had trustee
Robert Becht sign it.

This group later filed a 13D in 2001 with the intent to highlight NAII as a takeover
target to inflate the stock, according to the SEC. Specifically, the group stated that if
management failed to act, then they would propose "that management pursue a
financial transaction to improve stockholder value, including a merger, reorganization, or
liquidation…" The Terranova group ownership eventually reached over 10% of NAII.
Borg's name was never affiliated with the group during this time and he never disclosed
his personal holdings of 22%, control over this group or control over his customer
accounts who owned additional shares of NAII. (The SEC does not mention these other
players in the drama by name in the case filed against Borg & Mulkeen but we were
able to find them in SEC filings.)


We wondered if these other individuals, Terranova specifically, were close with Mr. Borg
or were simply strangers somehow used by Ed Borg as pawns. We discovered evidence
in the form of a New York Times article that indicates Mr. Borg, Mr. Terranova and Mr.
Becht had business ties that extended beyond NAII. In an article titled "City Agents Shut
Down 32 Vendors of Fake Items" from the February 27, 2008 edition of the Times, we
read that in an undercover operation, New York City police officers and agents shut
down the sale of counterfeit goods in an area of the city mayor Michael Bloomberg
referred to as "Counterfeit Triangle."


Regarding the operation Mr. Bloomberg said it was, "one of his administration's 'biggest
takedowns ever' against the 'easy and sleazy' money derived from counterfeit
merchandise." Bloomberg further went on to state that "the sales of counterfeit goods
cheated the city of $1 billion in sales tax a year and led to money laundering and bloody
turf wars. 'It is organized crime,' he said." A civil lawsuit was filed against the owners of
the property. The four "trustees of the Terranova estate" included "Robert Becht,
Edward T. Borg, George Terranova and Carl Terranova, said Mr. Post, the mayor's
spokesman."


The term "thick as thieves" suddenly comes to mind…

Ed Borg gets creative


So it would appear that at least Mr. Terranova and perhaps others were close to Mr.
Borg. Eventually, National Financial Services (NFS) began to increase the margin
requirements for Borg's firm All Funds, LLC because they had such a concentrated
position in NAII. To satisfy the requirements Borg would have had to sell NAII stock,
which he was unwilling to do. NFS informed All Funds on December 23, 2010 that they
would not renew their broker-dealer registration going forward and the clearing
agreement expired December 2011.


Borg decided to close All Funds and move his customers to another firm called LPL.
Brian Mulkeen was in charge of moving the accounts to LPL (he had also signed off on
Borg's trading of NAII at All Funds, which is the reason his name appears in the suit).
During this period, NAII stock declined significantly through much of 2011 while the
accounts were being moved to LPL. On September 16, 2011, Borg became a registered
rep at LPL. After joining LPL from September 2011 to January 2012, NAII stock began
rising again from its low of $3.45 to over $10 by early 2012.
At LPL, Borg controlled eighty-six customer accounts, and almost all of them held large
concentrated positions in NAII. A few months after starting at LPL on March 5th, 2012,
Borg's supervisor became suspicious of the heavy concentration of NAII in his client
accounts and his own undisclosed ownership. At this point, Borg realized the jig was
up. This is when he finally filed a Schedule 13G exposing his ownership in NAII stock on
March 9th, 2012 but even then misrepresented the true size of his holdings with no
mention of the Terranova trust and others. On April 18th, 2012, Borg was terminated
and on November 1st, 2012 after an internal investigation, LPL reported Borg's actions
to FINRA.


You might think he gave up here, but Ed Borg was a wily one. After being terminated
from LPL he retired, but was able to persuade some of his former customers to transfer
their accounts from LPL to TD Ameritrade where he remained in control of the accounts.
In several attempts for varying reasons, he made calls to TD Ameritrade and LPL
impersonating his customers. At one point, TD Ameritrade "confronted Borg and told
him that they had been monitoring his phone calls and knew that he was impersonating
customers." TD Ameritrade eventually restricted trades in the customer accounts and
required liquidation or transfer of the accounts associated with Borg.


One of the things we found interesting was that before Ed Borg became involved with
NAII stock in 2001, it was trading pretty consistently around $2 per share. Once he
became involved with the stock, it increased to nearly $14 in 2004 before settling into a
fairly consistent range between $5-$8 per share. Then in 2011, When Ed Borg was
trying to figure out how to maintain control of his customer accounts loaded with NAII
stock, the stock dropped as low as $3.45.


During the months of the move of the accounts to LPL, NAII stock suddenly rises again
over $10 by early 2012 and then is followed by another sizeable drop after LPL fires him
in March of 2012. From 2013 through most of 2015, the stock was in the $4-$6 range
before its recent increase to over $10, which is where we sit now. While the moves
could be coincidental, the SEC appears to have thought otherwise based on their
allegations against Mr. Borg.
Ed Borg was penalized, barred from the industry and of course required to file his true
ownership in NAII. On October 6th, 2015 in a 13G filing, we learned that Ed Borg
(including 22,847 shares owned by his wife) controlled 1,148,693 shares of NAII, which
represented 17.1% of NAII. This meant he still remained NAII's largest single
shareholder who is not an officer of the company (CEO Mark LeDoux owns close to
18%).


Carl Terranova's last filing is a joint 13D/A filing with a Thomas H. Hansen on August 16,
2006. At that time, Terranova and Hansen owned 732,200 or 11.1% of shares
outstanding. It is unclear if Terranova and Hansen remain shareholders, but we found no
filings indicating they have sold. More recently, on January 14th of this year a 13D was
filed disclosing the holdings of the Vincent Terranova Trust (Carl's father who passed),
which stated the Trust remained owners of 224,200 shares or 3.3%. The purpose of the
filing was to "reflect that as of December 23, 2015" the Trust "no longer act(s) in concert
with Carl J. Terranova and Thomas H. Hansen" and is no longer considered a 5% holder
of NAII.


If our assumptions are accurate, what this implies is that at the beginning of 2016, Mr. Edward Borg, Carl

Terranova, Thomas Hansen and the Trust of Vincent Terranova represented a combined 2,105,093 shares
of NAII equating to 31% of NAII's outstanding shares or approximately 50% of the float. Following SEC
enforcement and subsequent 13G filing, Mr. Borg began selling NAII stock on January 11th of this year.

*This was a particularly nice sale for Mr. Borg


As of his latest filing, Mr. Borg still owns 840, 965 shares or 12.4% of NAII or approximately 20% of the
4.12mil share float. If the other members of the group still hold their stock, combined they own
1,797,365 shares or 44% of the float.
This remains a significant overhang on NAII stock in our opinion. In fact, after the
close on April 28th, Mr. Borg has filed another Form 144 for the sale of 102,397
shares. That might not sound like much, but the stock's 10-day volume average is only
69k shares. To be clear, there is no connection between any officers or employees of
Natural Alternatives International and Mr. Borg, Mulkeen or Terranova that we are aware
of. The point of highlighting these issues is to explain the influence that these individuals
have had, and continue to have on the stock. We feel it is important for shareholders to
have an understanding of who they are investing with, particularly in the case of under-
covered stocks.


The reason Borg first invested in NAII supposedly was because he had read a study
about beta-alanine and thought this could be a boon for the stock. Based on our
research, we completely disagree with this theory, as we'll explain.


Earnings growth likely to decline


The recent driver of NAII's earnings growth has been two-fold. First, they've seen an
increase in the lower margin private label contract manufacturing (PLCM) sales,
specifically last quarter. Second, they've seen explosive growth in higher margin
CarnoSyn (beta-alanine) for the past three quarters. We'll tackle CarnoSyn first because
of its rapid rise.


Beta-alanine sales began increasing dramatically in fiscal Q4 2015 ended last June.
This FQ4 quarter (April-June) of last year was the first quarter since the company
had ended their agreement with Compound Solutions Inc. Why is this important?


While discussing Compound Solutions Inc. we'll refer to them as CSI for short. As the
owner of the patent portfolio behind CarnoSyn, NAII had allowed CSI and customers of
CSI to manufacture and sell CarnoSyn in exchange for a licensing fee since March of
2009. When the contract was not renewed with CSI last April, NAII was free to begin
producing and supplying CarnoSyn directly to buyers that in the past CSI had supplied.
This led to a significant increase in beta-alanine sales for NAII. CarnoSyn is also
NAII's highest margin product. The combination of these two factors were significant
drivers behind the past year's increase in earnings. Beginning in April, the company
is now lapping up against these increased sales. Therefore, it likely will be far more
difficult for the company to increase sales substantially for beta-alanine, their highest
margin product, going forward.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/787253/000114420416097069/0001144204-16-097069-index.htm

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/787253/000143774915017483/naii20150630_10k.htm
Although CarnoSyn sales have been up year over year for the past three quarters since
the CSI contract ended, they've flattened sequentially and were actually down slightly
last quarter. Beyond March, sales growth of beta-alanine should slow substantially
and will no longer be the driver it was, in our view. We believe investors will look
forward and likely sell the stock when they report the March quarter (FQ3) around
mid May.


In the chart above, we can see that since the contract with CSI has ended, sales of
CarnoSyn have increased substantially for the past three quarters but appear to have
topped out this past quarter. Also note that total operating income has never been
sustained at this level for very long. We decided to delve deeper into this issue to see if
in fact sales of CarnoSyn were likely to continue growing strongly or if the easy gains
have been made.


To do this, we scoured the Internet looking for supplement products containing
beta-alanine and examined the supplement labels for 101 products from 83
brands on 9 supplement websites.



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/787253/000143774916025033/0001437749-16-025033-index.htm

The sports nutrition marketplace is full of "me-too" products with larger than life claims of
producing Hulk like levels of energy to produce "extreme" muscle gains. With names for
their products like "PSYCHO," "The Curse!" and "Animal RAGE XL" the industry clearly
knows their customer is the young male twenty-something.


There were a surprising number of products in the sports nutrition marketplace in
particular that contain beta-alanine. Supplement websites we examined included
GNC.com, Supplementcentral.com, Netrition.com, Bodybuilding.com,
A1Supplements.com, Vitaminshoppe.com, Fitnessfirstusa.com, Luckyvitamin.com and
Smartbodynutrition.com. On each site, we typed in "beta-alanine" in the search bar to
see what they had to offer. There were far many more than 101 products but we felt that
would be enough for our purposes. Out of the 101 supplement product labels that
we examined containing beta-alanine, 76 contained NAII's CarnoSyn and 26
contained a generic form of beta-alanine.

Considering this data, we have come to several conclusions. The first is that the number
of sports related supplements containing beta-alanine is staggering. Imagine for
example going to the grocery store and picking from a shelf containing OVER 101 types
of ketchup. Almost all of them claim to do essential the same thing (increase energy and
muscle gain) and almost none of them contain exactly the same mix of ingredients. We
looked at several supplement labels containing well over 30 various chemicals &
ingredients while others contain 3 or 4. For most consumers, this is simply overkill. The
supplement industry seems to know this and tends to focus on flashy packaging with
over-the-top names and wording on the packages. Differentiation is extremely difficult to
achieve.


The second observation was that NAII already has saturated a large majority of this
market in our opinion. The 75.2% in the chart above represents products that actually
have the word "CarnoSyn" on their label as an ingredient. To list this as an ingredient if
they were not already licensing the product or buying it directly from NAII is highly
unlikely and illegal. So clearly they have already penetrated a great majority of this
market, yet sales of the product are running just over $5mil per quarter. It appears
they've nearly saturated what is a pretty small market of roughly $20mil per year.


For anyone who is thinking that high margin CarnoSyn (beta-alanine) is going to
be NAII's next leg of growth, we caution you based on these findings.


Our third observation is part observation and part understanding of the data. After
tallying this data we realized that many of the most popular products have several
different flavors, while those less popular tend to have only one. However, we didn't
double count the flavors. What this means is that it's even worse than we thought.
They likely have saturated far more than 75% of the market because of the way we
collected the data.


In fact, some of the more popular brands have several products on the market
containing beta-alanine. If we take GNC for example, we found five products containing
beta-alanine made by GNC: Pro Performance Beta-Alanine 3200, Mega Men Sport, Pro
Performance AMP, GenetixHD Pro-Sculpt and Beyond RAW - RAVAGE. In addition they
have several flavors of many of these products, so the real number of products made by
GNC containing CarnoSyn is even higher but again, we didn't double count for flavors.



http://www.gnc.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&kw=beta%20alanine&origkw=beta%20alanine&f=Taxonomy/GNC/13200328&size=16&ppg=16&sr=1
It makes sense instead to look at penetration of CarnoSyn based not only on
number of products containing the ingredient, but the number of brands
containing the ingredient. The 101 products we reviewed were sold by 83 different
brands. So the brand penetration is much, much higher at 91.6%. The implication is
that CarnoSyn is already in all the major accounts. The remaining companies are mainly
one-offs. They are companies with one brand and one product with beta-alanine as an
ingredient. The incremental benefit of legally forcing the remaining players into
compliance is on the decline, in our view.


Stars align for NAII, but for how long?


Clearly the stars were aligned this past quarter for NAII. In addition to CarnoSyn, PLCM
sales have been seeing a recovery and margins have been improving. In the recent
quarter they reported PLCM sales of $21.6mil. This was the best quarter for PLCM sales
since FQ1 of 2008 when they posted $21.8mil. So while it's rare for PLCM quarterly
sales to come in at this level it's certainly nothing new. However, we feel it would be
extremely naive to assume they've suddenly found a sustainable growth model
given their history.

The chart below exposes what is happening with NAII revenue. While international
business has been in a long-term steady, albeit slow growth phase (with the exception
of the recent quarter, which saw oddly high growth), the domestic business has been
slowly declining.


The blue and black lines in the chart above are domestic and international sales as
reported by quarter for NAII. We believe most if not all CarnoSyn sales are domestic, so
we backed CarnoSyn out of domestic sales to get an understanding for what underlying
domestic PLCM sales are doing. Assuming we are correct that CarnoSyn revenue is
mostly if not entirely domestic, the data clearly shows the domestic PLCM business
remains in decline. CarnoSyn has been a crutch to the domestic business for the past
year, but beginning in April they are now lapping the CSI contract termination and the
domestic decline will again be apparent. You can see in the chart above it's already
begun to roll over.

In regards to international revenue, Juice Plus drove the recent quarter along with one
other customer believed to be CIT Cosmeceuticals. CIT Cosmeceuticals is based in
Singapore and was NAII's 3rd largest customer last year representing 12% of sales. We
tried to see what we could find on CIT but there is little available. All we can say is they
are a skin, hair & body care company formed in 2000 and they are located at 2 Ang Mo
Kio Street 65, (569058) in Singapore. On the surface this doesn't strike us as a high
quality long-term customer. Along with Juice Plus, CIT appears to have been a large
contributor to NAII's increase in international sales this past quarter. We question the
sustainability of increased revenue from these sources.


The Juice Plus growth in the past quarter was truly surprising and when coupled with
CarnoSyn led to breakout earnings. In fact sales of $11.9mil to Juice Plus were up 33%
and up 75% sequentially. If Juice Plus ever had a bigger quarter for NAII we didn't
find it. This was very unexpected from an extremely mature customer with several
years of declining sales. Historically Juice Plus sales have been stagnating but got a
boost this past year post a packaging reconfiguration in 2014.


The packaging reconfiguration impacted NAII's PLCM sales negatively in fiscal 2014
due to inventory reductions by Juice Plus, but in fiscal 2015, PLCM sales benefitted
from the new packaging. They have now lapped this but it's possible they could be
getting some residual benefit from the packaging reconfiguration. That still wouldn't
explain the recent quarter's increase.


Why the sudden massive increase in Juice Plus sales?

Juice Plus & CIT accounted for 70% of PLCM sales and 57% of total sales in the most
recent quarter.


Domestic Juice Plus sales were up 44% in the quarter and driven by new products with
higher average sales prices. This we see as unsustainable. Sales were up so
dramatically, that we suspect that they may have been pulled forward or they may have
filled an initial order for new products. In fact, in NAII's most recent 10-Q they state that
the first six months PLCM sales "increased 11% due primarily to the timing of product
shipments of new and existing products." Juice Plus was 55% of PLCM sales in the
quarter so if we are correct, expect a big pull back in total revenue and earnings
next quarter. It's hard to know for sure if this is the case but again we look to history of
the company. The twenty years of data we analyzed suggests this recent increase is
likely unsustainable, particularly with the margins they achieved.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/4/18/47406777-14609633986051886_origin.png

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/787253/000143774916025033/naii20151119_10q.htm
Margins reached 11.8% for the PLCM operating segment last quarter. This is
significantly above trend, which has been in long-term decline. Since Juice Plus is
by far their largest customer, they have considerable sway over the margin that NAII is
able to achieve. Since they are also a mature customer of over 20 years, it's unlikely
they would allow NAII to keep a bigger piece of the "pie" for themselves. We suspect
margins will return to historical trend as any new product is integrated into production.
This appears to have already begun in the past quarter as we can see in the chart
below.


NAII reaching premium valuation on the back of unsustainable earnings


We'll start first with our best-case scenario valuation of NAII.


We feel the sales and earnings achieved in the past three quarters are unsustainable.
Looking under the hood we've discussed several reasons why it would be a mistake to
assume that anything is "different this time." In addition, to own the stock you're getting
in bed with some questionable insiders who shouldn't be trusted. It is our opinion that to
properly value NAII you have to consider their history when projecting forward. NAII
breaks out their sales and operating income by segment so we decide to value the
company by segment to get a more granular look at the business. The two drivers
(segments) to the story are CarnoSyn, and PLCM. Let's take a look at CarnoSyn first.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/4/18/47406777-14609635281647568_origin.png
Post the CSI contract, CarnoSyn sales have averaged $5mil per quarter and segment
level operating income has averaged $1.26mil or 25%. We've already explained why we
expect only modest growth for CarnoSyn past April, but we'll assume it's better than say,
mid single digits. Assuming CarnoSyn is on a $20mil annual run rate with 10% growth
gets us $22mil. Frankly, assuming they can grow CarnoSyn at all is a leap of faith since
in the most recent quarter CarnoSyn sales were slightly down sequentially but here we
will give them the benefit of the doubt since this is our bull case. With a 25% operating
margin on $22mil in sales that's $5.5mil in operating segment income for the next year
for CarnoSyn.


Looking at PLCM we have to take a different approach. While international has seen
growth, domestic has been in decline. We feel it's fair to look at PLCM revenue over a
ten-year time span because the vast majority of this business has come from the same
two or three customers over this period (mainly Juice Plus and Mannatech). Looking at
a ten-year time frame, sales per quarter averaged $16.9mil. This seems extremely fair
since they only posted $16.3mil in PLCM sales in fiscal Q1.


Next we determine the appropriate PLCM revenue growth rates and segment operating
margins. The recent quarter muddles results because they simply are not a fair
representation of the company's history so we've excluded these results and also
excluded the period before The Juice Plus inventory reduction that ended in fiscal 3rd
quarter of 2014. The inventory reduction hurt NAII's PLCM sales and thus removing
them from our average counterbalances the omission of last quarter PLCM sales that
we consider anomalous. By excluding both of these periods we feel this provides a fair
look at the current state of business. Additionally, we included the period post the Juice
Plus inventory reduction when product was being shipped in their new packaging, which
was a boost to PLCM sales in 2015. This we feel is a very fair compromise.


PLCM average growth since that time (excluding the most recent quarter and the Juice
Plus inventory reduction that negatively impacted NAII) has been 6.7%. Assuming
growth of 6.7% on ten-year average sales of $16.9mil we arrive at $72.1mil in PLCM
annual sales. PLCM average segment operating margin using the same time frame
exclusions as described above is 8.9%. This is more than reasonable since the trend
line average is closer to 8% as can be seen in the chart above. That works out to
$6.4mil in PLCM operating segment income per year.
Combined we now assume $11.9mil in segment operating income for CarnoSyn and
PLCM. However, we have yet to account for corporate expenses not designated to
these segments, corporate taxes and other. In the "Segment Information" section of NAII
filings we find that non-allocated corporate expenses in 2015 were a bit over $5mil.
Fiscal 2016 has been running ahead of this so we'll assume about $5.6mil for our
estimates. Taxes have run between 23%-30%. We'll assume a 25% tax rate. Other
expenses/income have been mostly immaterial so we've ignored them for simplicity.
That gets us to $4.7mil in net income or EPS of 71c per share fully diluted forward four-
quarter earnings. That's not an estimate for NAII's fiscal year (ending June). It's a
forward four-quarter projection.

We feel this is an extremely fair and somewhat generous assumption on 12-month

Now the bear case…
Remember, the 71c EPS estimate is our bullish case. We haven't provided the bearish
case. For our bear case, we assume that CarnoSyn growth is closer to 5% (even in our
bear case, we won't assume flat), margins on PLCM are 8%, non-allocated corporate
expenses are $6mil and the tax rate is 27%.

The chart above shows NAII rarely gets a premium valuation on their earnings likely due
to several of the issues we've already discussed. Also keep in mind these valuations
were being manipulated upward during most of these periods, but supposedly that's no
longer the case. Applying the average historical valuation to our EPS estimate of
63c, we get to $9.26 on a straight P/E and $5.61 on P/E when we back out cash
(they hold no debt).


We take the average of the two to arrive at our target price of $7.43 per share. This
represents approximately 40% downside to the current price.


Consider for a moment that recent results consisted of two main drivers:


a) CarnoSyn sales on a one-time increase due to the ending of the CSI contract. They
are now lapping up against this one-time improvement in what appears to be a small
and saturated market.


AND


b) A very unexpected increase in sales to one large 20+ year old customer (55% of
revenue in the recent quarter) whose sales appear to have been stagnant at best prior
to the recent quarters.


Then consider the large overhang on the stock from Mr. Borg. He is now selling blocks
and remains a sizeable holder representing 20% of the current float, and along with his
affiliates represents 44% of the float.

We feel the case for our target is easy to make because history does it for us. It's not
that NAII doesn't make money, they've been making money for several years. The
problem is growth has been extremely inconsistent and that sometimes leads to years
where they lose money. Smaller customers that add incremental growth like CIT
Cosmeceuticals seem to come and go. The recent quarters have been impressive, but
NAII has been here before and couldn't sustain momentum. Currently, investors appear
willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, valuation is at a premium in
comparison to historical multiples and we prefer to stand with the time-tested facts of
NAII's history.
