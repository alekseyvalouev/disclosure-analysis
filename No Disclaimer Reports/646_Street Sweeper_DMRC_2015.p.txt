Cracking The Code On Digimarc: Deteriorating Business Will Continue
To Decline

Summary


Despite DMRC revenue hitting a 5-year low, executive compensation actually rose to
over $6 million – handing execs 26% of total revenue.


Customer concentration danger has revealed itself as DMRC struggles with the loss
of licensing fees as key customers apparently become disenchanted.


DMRC’s net losses have climbed and gross margins have deteriorated. And analysts
are expecting negative earnings of $-2.07 per share, amid some of the industry’s
worst comps.


Though Digimarc (NASDAQ:DMRC) revenue dropped to a five-year low and some
licensing deals have collapsed, executives have raked in more than $6 million in
compensation and sold shares like crazy.


CEO Bruce Davis even got a raise in November, bringing his base salary to $600,000.


Include Mr. Davis's stock awards and 401-K contributions, and it all adds up to $3.39
million.


Not only that but, if and when his job ends, Mr. Davis will receive at least $600,000 yearly
for two years after termination.


Meanwhile, three other top executives just had another $260,000 worth of stock apiece
added to their compensation packages, bringing their total compensation to nearly
$800,000 apiece.


And, just for attending up to five board meetings a year, Digimarc's four directors each
received compensation in the $150,000 range.


Ultimately, compensation for executives and directors in 2014 consumed a jaw-dropping
26 percent of total revenue.

While investors may read exclusively bullish viewpoints here on the Beaverton, Oregon
"invisible" barcode maker, we'll hit on other concerns expected to ultimately send this
highflyer crashing back to reality.


*Insiders yell "Sell!"


Perhaps raising a question about how much faith he may have in his company, CEO
Davis dumped 34,000 shares of Digimarc from Jan. 2, 2015 to June 1, 2015 - a block or
two every month. With the exception of Monday's sale, all were sold for about $2 to $7
less than the recent share price of $29 and change.


Mr. Davis has sold ~91,000 shares since 2014. While he has led all other insiders in
selling company stock, two other officers and two directors also unloaded shares last year.
Nasdaq records show all buys to date were option executions.


Here is a snapshot of sales in the last three months:

*Loss of revenue sources


Maybe Digimarc's concentrated customer base is rightfully spooking insiders. The
company is indeed a text-book case for why it's risky for companies to have a
concentrated customer base.


At one point, 69 percent of Digimarc revenue came from three sources; several central
banks (43%), Neilsen Co. (16%) and Verance Corp. (10%).

But the customer base has been crumbling. It took a hit when:


*In 2012, Digimarc and Nielsen suspended operations of their two joint ventures.


*In early 2014, Neilsen bowed out of its licensing deal, ending licensing fees to Digimarc.
Neilsen is now one of Digimarc's biggest rivals.


*In late 2014, Verance whittled down its licensing deal, waiving any future royalties and
licensing fees.


Consequently, here was customer concentration for 2014:

And look at the customer concentration now:


(Source: SEC filings)


These figures indicate both the danger of concentration and brings to question the value
of Digimarc's technology since so many major customers now seem anything but
fascinated.


Behind that depressing trend is an interesting story. Although Digimarc tried to dismiss the
Verance troubles as "waiving any future royalties," the two had been snarling and biting for
years like a pair of junkyard dogs.


*Digimarc and customers break into dog fight


Indeed, Digimarc agreements with its biggest clients sometimes turn into revenue-biting
grudge matches.


We've highlighted a couple below:

*Verance Corp.: No surprise that Verance's CEO publicly nipped at Digimarc, charging it
provided incomplete and misleading information and resorted to "distortion of the court's
true action," when Digimarc announced settlement of a dispute with Signum Technologies.
The two companies have taken each other to court 12 times in an ongoing dispute related
to patent issues, court records show, ultimately settling in 2012.


*Intellectual Ventures: The company known for leveling patent lawsuits, reached a much-
touted $36 million license fee agreement with Digimarc in 2010. The two also tussled over
potential profit sharing, finally settling that dispute in January 2014.


Intellectual Ventures' license payments to Digimarc ended in 2013. Also, patent sublicense
producing license fees have ended. Consulting fees end this year.


What has all this squabbling with some of its biggest customers - and the general
disappointment with its technology - ultimately meant to Digimarc?


Well …


*Death grip: Revenue and gross profits plummet, net losses jump


As the chart makes all too clear, problems with clients have contributed to significantly
worsening financials in the last two years. Indeed, analysts this year are expecting
negative earnings of $-2.07 per share, amid some of the industry's worst comps.
