James Chanos, Wall Street’s most notable China bear, has racked up gains this year amid
China’s slowdown after a three-year losing streak at his hedge funds. But his Kynikos
Associates LP actually has larger bets against the energy industry, which have also contributed
to recent profits, as we reported today.


One of those short bets is against Pittsburgh-area energy company Consol Energy, according to
a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Chanos, who has spoken publicly about an oil glut given
the U.S. shale boom, questionable accounting by some exploration and production companies
and the coming online of large liquefied natural gas projects, last spoke critically about Consol
at a 2012 investment conference. Kynikos has maintained a short bet against Consol since then,
though its investment now is smaller than it was in 2012, the person said.

5/21/2018 Jim Chanos Is Winning Big on Energy Bets Too - MoneyBeat - WSJ

A July 2015 Kynikos presentation for clients viewed by The Wall Street Journal said the stock of
Consol, which has fallen more than 60% this year, was “driven by financial engineering.”


In a statement Wednesday, Consol said it not seen Kynikos’s presentation but had been “very
transparent” about its efforts to transform into a “pure play E&P company.” Consol described
itself as an “asset rich company” whose restructuring would help “all stakeholders…properly
analyze these individual assets and the overall value [of] our company.”


Consol has been a popular long holding among hedge funds, hurting managers including David
Einhorn this year.


Mr. Chanos has taken aim at other energy companies as well, telling CNBC last week he was
short Cheniere Energy and saying at a Las Vegas investment conference in May he was short
major oil companies.


Kynikos’s recent gains mark a turnaround for Mr. Chanos, who started his firm nearly 30 years
ago and is one of the few short-sellers to have remained in business for so long. The returns of
short-sellers tend to be lumpy, with outsize gains during market downturns following years of
losses.


Because some clients invest in short-sellers to hedge their equities exposure, Kynikos can get
paid even when it loses money as long as it outperforms its benchmarks, typically how a short
of various stock indexes perform. The annualized return of Ursus, Kynikos’s flagship fund, Is
about 15% a year relative to its benchmark, according to another document viewed by the
Journal, compared to a much lower absolute annualized return.
