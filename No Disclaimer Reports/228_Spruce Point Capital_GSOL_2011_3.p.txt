Global Sources: Latest Company Actions Speak Louder Than Words;
Extreme Caution Warranted

Introduction


On October 13, 2011 Spruce Point Capital Management issued a report (click here) that
indicated we had major concerns with Global Sources (Nasdaq: GSOL), a Chinese B2B
trade and media business. Our major points of concern are primarily focused on the
company’s weakening financial prospects, opaque financial reporting, and unusual
financial strategies at odds with its business model.


Recent Developments


The age-old saying “Actions Speak Louder Then Words” is particularly fitting to the
situation faced by Global Sources. Since the publication of our report, the company has
not made a prepared response or comment addressing the our conclusions. This has not
typically been the approach taken by management teams that have been highlighted by
bloggers, hedge funds, and other investors.


Take for example Silvercorp Metals (NYSE: SVM), which has taken its fraud allegations
very seriously, openly communicated with investors, repurchased shares, and formed an
independent committee that hired an outside forensic accountant to investigate matters
(SVM news). Another approach, used by Camelot Information Systems (NYSE: CIS), our
last target of investigation, was to hold a same-day investor conference call in an attempt
to quell investor’s fears and halt the stock from falling farther. Our concerns about
Camelot’s employee defections and business deterioration ultimately proved correct.


Is Global Source’s decision not to comment on our allegations a tacit acknowledgement
that our conclusions are correct, and the stock is worth nothing more than $2.50/share?
Based upon Global Source’s recent action to file a $300 million shelf prospectus on
Friday, October 28th, we think the answer is a resounding "Yes." The stated intention
of the filing is for “general corporate purposes” and does not appear to be justifiable on
any grounds. This is yet another “red flag” that has been typically observed by Chinese
RTOs: raise capital at any price and valuation before the market shuts and the game
ends.

ZST Digital Networks (Nasdaq: ZSTN) is a perfect example that illustrates our point. In
November 2010, we warned investors about our concerns with this company. (Source:
here). The company’s management did not address the conclusions we made in the
article. Instead, it proceeded to file a shelf registration for up to $50 million of capital on
January 7, 2011 (Source: here). At the time, ZSTN had a market capitalization of $80m,
and was reporting that it had $34m of cash on hand, and generating $18.5m of cash from
operations.


Put in context, ZST’s management was indicating to investors it was willing to dilute over
60% of its market capitalization while showing elsewhere that both its cash on the balance
sheet and cash from operations could more than cover the $50m shelf requirement.
Ironically, ZSTN then announced on January 28th, that it would purchase office space to
support its "growth" for $7.8m. (Source: here (.pdf)). Investors have since wised up to
ZST’s actions, and shares have declined almost 70% since the date of the shelf filing.


What could Global Sources possibly need up to $300 million of capital for? The answer is
not entirely clear, especially in light of the company’s SEC reported financials. The charts
below profile the company’s reported cash balances and free cash flow (cash from
operations less non-property capital expenditures). As clearly indicated by the charts,
Global Sources paints the picture to investors of a healthy company, with ample cash
resources and free cash flow to support the operation of its business and finance its
general corporate purposes.


Could the shelf filing be related to the Company’s recent and mysterious $50 million
acquisition of property in Shanghai to support its “growth?” (Source: here). The answer is
still not entirely clear because the company has yet to provide any information publicly to
investors on where the property is located and if the transaction has closed.

The $300 million mixed use shelf also appears to be an incredibly large amount by any
relative measure. We have analyzed its recent shelf size in comparison to other U.S. listed
Chinese RTOs in the table below and illustrated the results in the following charts. To
make the results comparable, we look at the ratio of the shelf size in comparison to each
company’s market capitalization, reported cash balance and cash from operations for the
period closest to the shelf’s filing date.


The results are quite striking. Global Sources is an outlier on nearly every metric we
analyze. The fact that the shelf size of $300m is greater than the company’s entire
market capitalization alone is cause for serious concern.
