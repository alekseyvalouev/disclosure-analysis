RACE


Ferrari is overvalued based on most valuation metrics. We modeled the intrinsic
value at $25 a share or 46% downside.


"Ferrari is a luxury brand not a car company" is akin to "GoPro is a media company
not a camera maker.".


Upcoming Fiat Chrysler share distribution of Ferrari shares will cause forced
selling.


Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:NYSE:RACE) is a recent IPO (or Carve Out) of the Ferrari Division
of Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU). The IPO was structured in a way to both provide cash to
FCAU and to add value to current shareholders of the company. I believe the IPO was
ambitiously priced and is bound for a share price much lower than the ~$47 it currently
trades at. Here are the reasons that I feel that Ferrari is worth much less and the
catalyst that will drive its price towards this value.

Ferrari IPO Structure


To understand the coming catalyst for the short thesis, you need to first understand the
IPO of the company. Prior to the IPO, FCAU owned 90% of Ferrari, with the son of Enzo
Ferrari owning the other 10%. The IPO was set up as a "Carve Out." FCAU sold a 9%
stake in Ferrari during the IPO, while it held onto an 80% stake in the new publicly
traded entity called Ferrari N.V. trading under the ticker symbol RACE. The remaining
shares that FCAU owns will be distributed to its shareholders in "early 2016" via a share
distribution or a spin-off. This is what the post-IPO structure looks like right now prior to
the spin-off.


Ferrari is also what I consider a low float offering. Only 9% of the company was sold in
an IPO and the current float and volume is pretty low for a company worth $8.9b on
paper. Average volume traded in the last 10 days was 1.023m shares/day with an
aggregate value of ~$48m/day or 0.5% of its market cap. Low float offerings can often
distort the true value of the shares of IPOs initially (See GPRO or SHAK post IPO),
which is why I was originally hesitant to get short RACE. Because of the low float
borrowing, shares are somewhat expensive currently in the mid teens. But as you will
see, I view the pending spin-off as very bearish event for the stock, making it a safe time
to short.


Why Ferrari is Worth $25, maybe.

Ferrari makes some pretty awesome cars and has been doing it for over 60 years. Even
though it makes awesome cars does not mean you want to own its stock (although I am
sure people have bought shares just because they love the cars and brand).


To support the stock's current valuation with a forward P/E = 26 and EV/EBITDA = 13
(based on current projections), the company needs to grow its top line revenue above
20% for the next five years, assuming no margin improvements. To give it the benefit of
the doubt, even if it improves its profit margins from 11% to 13%, it still needs to grow
revenues at 17.5% to be worth $47 a share. Current consensus revenue growth for the
next five years is 13.5%, with almost no revenue growth in 2016. I think those
projections are likely even high in the face of the constraints in which the company
operates.


Those constraints include its production facilities, its use of manual labor in some of the
car production, investment associated with new models, and customization
requirements on each car which are almost entirely customizable. The company
announced it will ramp production and increase from a run rate of 7700 car shipments
(Q3 2015 run rate) to 9000 car shipments by 2019. That is a four-year CAGR of only 4%
in regards to shipment growth. The company also noted in the IPO document that it
grew shipments by 34% in the last 10 years (or 3.4% per year), which is pretty much in
line with its future goals. I don't see how it could ever grow revenues at close to 20%
with volume growth of only 4% unless it starts jacking up the sticker price by 15% per
year, which I don't see as sustainable.
Outside of selling cars and parts, the company also makes engines for Maserati and it
also is a "Luxury" brand that sells merchandise and supports Formula 1 racing. The
company has four segments; Cars & Parts, Engines, Sponsorship & Commercial Brand,
and Other. The company does not break out the profitability of each segment, so it is
hard to tell the profit makings on its business segments (likely on purpose). Its Engines
segment which covers the Maserati business and "rental of engines to Formula 1 racing
team" only generated 172m Euros in the first nine months of the year, which declined
from last year 228m Euros due to declining Maserati volumes. The Sponsorship &
Commercial Brand segment generated 332m Euros, basically flat year over year. Based
on the IPO filing and the subsequent earnings report, I am not buying that these other
business segments outside of Cars and Parts are either fast growing or highly profitable.


We are a Luxury Brand, Not a Car Company


During the run-up to the IPO, the FCAU CEO Sergio Marchionne said that Ferrari is a
Luxury Brand like Prada Group (OTCPK:PRDSY) or Hermes International
(OTCPK:HESAY) and not a simple carmaker. This argument was made to convince
investors to pay a high premium for shares in this "Luxury" Brand. I view the "We are a
luxury brand and not a car company" line as akin to GoPro's "We are a media company
not a camera company," and we all know how that turned out. IPOs can often distort the
valuation of companies largely because everyone involved is incentivized to get the
highest price they can for shares. Call Ferrari what is, which is a car company, a high-
end car company, but a car company.


Coming Catalyst: FCAU Share Distribution


Current publicly traded float is about 10%. Fiat owns another 80% and Enzi Ferrari's
Son owns 10%. Fiat Chrysler will spin off its 80% of shares to its shareholders early next
year, some suggesting as early as January. That spin-off event will not be good for
Ferrari's shares, as some forced selling will occur. No spin-off comes without forced
selling, largely because of the current market dynamics. ETFs, Mutual funds, dividend
investors, and other institutional investors may be forced to sell shares of Ferrari when
they are distributed due to various rules or the fact the company is outside of their stated
investment mission. Just looking at the Top 5 Institutional Holders. you can see that
some will no doubt likely sell their RACE shares immediately.

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Vanguard shares are mostly ETFs in which a portion will likely have to immediately sell
their RACE shares, as are some of the other large banks listed.


On top of the forced selling, the spin-off will also open up shares available to short for
short sellers that may have stayed away due to the low current float putting additional
pressure on the share price.


Conclusion
Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market
by 47%.
