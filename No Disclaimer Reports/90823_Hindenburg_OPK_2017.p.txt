Summary: OPKO Health, Inc. (OPK)
A slew of undisclosed or thinly disclosed executive team departures in the diagnostics


division, which represents over 82.8% of revenue, could signal business decline and a


compliance “house-cleaning”.


The quiet departure of key employees in the company’s renal division underscore issues


with the rollout of Opko’s FDA-approved drug, Rayaldee.


The company is employing “co-pay assist” programs in the roll-out of Rayaldee in an


apparent attempt to compete with low-cost generic & over-the-counter alternatives.


Pipeline delays and disclosure oddities give us doubt about the value of remaining


pipeline assets.


A low cash balance coupled with negative free cash �ow and regulatory overhang could


signal a near-term liquidity crunch.


Introduction


Opko has dropped approximately 25% since its recent quarterly report issued last Wednesday


after it missed estimates (https://seekingalpha.com/news/3309987-opko-health-misses-0_03-

sales in the company’s FDA-approved product Rayaldee, the diagnostics division also saw a


signi�cant drop in revenue. We believe the recent quarter is merely the beginning of a series of


continuing problems at the company.


BioReference: Changes at BioReference Labs


The company’s diagnostics business, which primarily consists of BioReference Laboratories


(“BioReference”), accounted for 82.8% of Opko’s 2016 annual revenue. BioReference is


described in the 10-K as “the nation’s third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing


business.”


A slew of undisclosed or thinly disclosed executive team departures seems to indicate that


BioReference is undergoing a behind-the-scenes transformation. We believe these changes will


impair growth and pro�tability of the division and could foreshadow looming regulatory issues.


BioReference: Executives Quietly Depart in
Quick Succession


On the recent conference call, EVP Steve Rubin stated “We continue to make investments in


systems e�ciencies, cost reductions and new leadership” and later made reference to a


“change in sales leadership”. When exploring this further we found the following details on old


leadership that went unmentioned or thinly referenced:


Richard Faherty was until recently the Chief Information O�cer of BioReference. He was


removed from the BioReference executive team list (http://www.bioreference.com/executive-


team/) on July 30  of this year, according to Aihitdata.com


(https://www.aihitdata.com/company/00558E2C/BIOREFERENCE/history#main), although no


announcement of his departure was made. On Faherty’s Linkedin pro�le


(https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-faherty-988870a/) he currently lists himself as an


“independent consultant”.


Charles “Chuck” Todd was previously Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing at


BioReference and served in that role at least until July of this year according to a historical


capture


(https://web.archive.org/web/20170606041139/http:/www.bioreference.com/executive-


team/) of the BioReference executive team website. Again, no announcement was made


regarding his departure.

Amar Kamath was previously Vice President of Marketing at BioReference according to the


executive team website. Kamath was removed as of July 30 , according to Aihitdata.com


(https://www.aihitdata.com/company/00558E2C/BIOREFERENCE/history#main). No


announcement of his departure was made.


Also worth noting:


Marc Grodman was the Founder of BioReference. Grodman publicly resigned from the


company in March 2016, according to a press release


(http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160315005608/en/OPKO-Health-Names-Dr.-


Gregory-Henderson-President). Despite the disclosure of Grodman’s departure, no clear


reason was given for the resignation and Grodman made no statement as part of the release.


We contacted investor relations seeking disclosure on these executive team departures and


have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this


accordingly.


BioReference: Recent Departures and a New Key
Hire Could Signal a Shi� Toward Compliance


We believe changes at BioReference could signal a focus on compliance. Several of the recently


departed BioReference executive team members had controversial pasts:


Richard Faherty had a past criminal conviction


(http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/uploads/FahertyFreedin1985.pdf) and was disbarred


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/nf6bmwQSxD7Bkn) as an attorney. He pleaded guilty in


May 1984 to misusing up to $75,000 of clients’ money, though prosecutors believe he took at


least $250,000 from clients between August 1983 and January 1984. In March 1986, Faherty


was placed on four years’ probation and was ordered to do 1,500 hours of community service


by a Superior Court Judge.


Chuck Todd’s dealings at BioReference had also come under scrutiny: In 2009, BioReference


�led a lawsuit against former BioReference employees Matt Carey and Sam Ruta, accusing


them of misusing con�dential information.


The two ex-employees then �led a detailed counterclaim


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/carey-ruta-counterclaim) stating that they


and their colleagues were victims of an extortion scheme organized by senior management of


th

Bio-Reference Laboratories. The claim stated Todd accepted $1,600,000 in proceeds from the


extortion scheme as pro�t for Bio-Reference Labs. The claim further detailed Todd and


management’s complicity in wide scale improper conduct including pervasive expense fraud


and abuse, misrepresentations and non disclosures to shareholders, self-dealing, and other


improprieties. The claim and counterclaim were later dismissed


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/bio-reference-consent-stipulation).


Marc Grodman also had some questionable associations. His brother Joel was once alleged


(https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/03/18/gottis-golden-goose/) to have posed as a salesman


for BioReference to secure a mob-controlled union contract with $400,000 of kickbacks to mob


boss Peter Gotti.


Additionally, Grodman had received �nancing from questionable sources in the early days of


BioReference, as Barron’s had reported in 2011 (http://www.barrons.com/articles/two-risky-


health-care-companies-become-one-1434768602):


CEO Grodman’s lab was �nanced in the decade after its 1986 initial public o�ering by


such penny-stock bankers as Paul Russo, a Ma�a-associated broker, and J.T. Moran,


whose �rm was the model for the movie Boiler Room. They and other Bio-Reference


backers ended up in jail (“There Will Be Blood


(http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203869804576327653050457


990),” May 23, 2011). Grodman and Bio-Reference were never implicated in any


untoward activities, and he has said he never saw any wrongdoing.


Aside from the cascade of executive team departures, Jane Pine Wood, a veteran healthcare


attorney was appointed as Chief Legal and Compliance O�cer


(http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160913005468/en/OPKO-Health-Appoints-Jane-


Pine-Wood-Chief) of BioReference in October 2016. Prior to Ms. Wood’s arrival the role appears


to have not existed, according to historical website snapshots


(https://web.archive.org/web/20160921032012/http:/www.bioreference.com:80/executive-


team/) of the executive team list.


The hiring of a Chief Legal and Compliance o�cer came on the heels of a June 2016 False


Claims Act settlement where the company paid $9.35 million (https://www.justice.gov/usao-


mdtn/pr/former-ceo-physician-and-drug-testing-laboratory-pay-935-million-settle-false-


claims) to settle charges against former Opko Health CEO Dr. Jonathan Oppenheimer, brought


by the U.S. Attorney’s O�ce in Tennessee.

We believe a “cleaning house” may be needed for the company given its historical association


with a range of checkered individuals, but it also presents several problems:


1. When faced with an increased compliance burden, BioReference may simply not


fare well in the highly competitive lab industry. Diagnostics revenue has already


dropped on a quarter over quarter basis (from $256.7 million in June to $229.0


million in September) and is down similarly on a y/y basis. We believe the


management shake-up and new compliance protocols will continue to rear their


heads in the form of worsening operating metrics.


2. As we have seen with other diagnostics businesses, one regulatory action may be


a sign that additional regulatory actions are around the corner. In the case of


Quest Diagnostics for example, the company has seen numerous successive


regulatory actions. (1

act-allegations),5 (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/blood-testing-laboratory-pay-


6-million-settle-allegations-kickbacks-and-unnecessary-testing))


3. Any potential regulatory action could create a substantial near-term cash


liability. Opko is free cash �ow negative and had only $100.4 million in cash and


equivalents as of the most recent quarter. Any material regulatory settlement


could put the company in a highly liquidity constrained position.


BioReference: SDNY False Claims Act Probe
Represents a Looming Overhang


In addition to the behind-the-scenes turmoil, we believe company statements could


foreshadow a potential settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s o�ce.


According to a 10-Q �led May 10


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480917000005/opk-

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In April 2017, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s O�ce for the Southern


District of New York (the “SDNY”) informed BioReference Laboratories (“BioReference”)


that it believes that, from 2006 to the present, BioReference had, in violation of the


False Claims Act, improperly billed Medicare and Tricare (both are federal government


health care programs) for clinical laboratory services provided to hospital inpatient


bene�ciaries at certain hospitals.


Rather than o�ering the typical corporate-speak denying the allegations or stating that they are


“without merit”, BioReference simply stated that they are “reviewing” and “assessing” the


allegations for merit:


BioReference is reviewing and assessing the allegations made by the SDNY, and, at


this point, BioReference has not determined whether there is any merit to the SDNY’s


claims nor can it determine the extent of any potential liability. While management


cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time, the ultimate outcome could


be material to our business, �nancial condition, results of operations, and cash �ows.


Three months later, after BioReference had a chance to review and assess the allegations, the


10-Q released on August 8  contained the exact same language about reviewing the


allegations for their merit and for their potential liability.


Two days after that report release, Opko CEO Frost was interviewed on CNBC’s Mad Money


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpvuTx10eIA) and commented on the SDNY issue. Rather


than giving the company a clean bill of health, he stated that they did an internal evaluation


and audit and found no “systemic” problems. Frost acknowledged that they had “found a few


errors here and there, as you would expect in a business that has so many transactions.” He


also stated that the SDNY was supposed call Opko back in April but never did, suggesting that


perhaps the matter was put to rest.


Despite Frost’s partial assurances, his statement on a lack of “systemic” problems seems to fall


short of addressing the SDNY’s allegations of wrongdoing stemming back from 2006. He (a)


provided no further details on the internal valuation (b) failed to address whether there had


been past systemic problems and (c) provided no assurance that the SDNY had actually


dropped the matter.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Furthermore, given the multiple undisclosed executive team departures at BioReference that


appear to have taken place mere weeks prior to Frost’s assurances, the issues at BioReference


seem to remain an open question.


Now, in the most recent quarterly report


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480917000018/opk-


9302017x10q.htm) we see that the language on reviewing and assessing the


charges again remains completely unchanged. We believe the SDNY probe merits close


attention and could represent a severe overhang going forward.


We contacted investor relations seeking con�rmation on whether the SDNY has dropped the


False Claims act probe and seeking an update on the status of the probe. We have not heard


back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this accordingly.


Rayaldee: A “Feature” Failure?


While the lab business transforms itself under an apparent executive team shake-up, the


company’s much touted drug o�erings seems to o�er little relief.


Rayaldee has been described in Opko’s �lings as the “feature” of their pharmaceutical segment.


The drug is FDA-approved, and is indicated to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults


with stage 3 or 4 Chronic Kidney Disease and vitamin D insu�ciency. It was approved in June


2016 and launched later that year in November.


In the OPKO earnings call transcript from November 2016


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4020819-opko-healths-opk-ceo-phillip-frost-q3-2016-results-


earnings-call-transcript?part=single), Executive Vice President Steven Rubin stated:


Rayaldee is the �rst product to receive FDA approval for this indication. Rayaldee �lls


a void in the available treatment options for approximately 9 million American adults,


which represent a potential market estimate to exceed $12 billion annually.


Despite the stated size of the opportunity and its launch last year, Rayaldee has fallen far short


of expectations. As of the latest quarterly report, the company stated “During the nine months


ended September 30, 2017, we did not recognize any product revenues related


to Rayaldee sales.” In the same report OPKO stated that the advance payments received from


Rayaldee customers (but not yet recognized as revenue) totaled only $6.5 million. Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Despite the dismal revenue contribution, the company earlier attempted to plant seeds of


optimism in Rayaldee’s future by suggesting that the drug was receiving widespread adoption


by insurers. In a June 1, 2017 press release (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=1029053) the company touted that Rayaldee is accessible to 68% of insured lives.


We view the above press release as misleading. While it is true that the company has fairly


broad access among commercial insurers, Rayaldee has unrestricted access to only 8% of


insured Medicare lives nationwide (https://formularylookup.com/?


__hssc=214756936.1.1500564113593&__hstc=214756936.03b880ddc284b861c89df491�cfa3a5.

to FormularyLookup.com (http://formularylookup.com/), an analytics service that provides data


on insurance coverage for U.S. pharmaceuticals:


We contacted investor relations seeking comment on Rayaldee’s access to Medicare insured


lives and have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this


accordingly.


Medicare coverage is of paramount importance because approximately 71% of Chronic Kidney


Disease (“CKD”) patients—the key target audience for Rayaldee—are enrolled in Medicare Part


D, as of the latest report from the U.S. Renal Data System


(https://www.usrds.org/2016/view/v1_07.aspx).[1] This suggests that the vast majority of CKD


patients will need access through Medicare Part D plans in order to have coverage for the drug.Privacy  - Terms

https://www.usrds.org/2016/view/v1_07.aspx

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The same report also shows that approximately 12% of CKD patients had no known insurance


coverage, suggesting that insurance providers outside of Medicare Part D represent only a


fraction of patients seeking CKD treatments.


The same Opko press release above proclaimed that the company had “entered into


agreements with several large Medicare Part D plan sponsors, including the largest Medicare


Part D plan, and additional commercial insurance plans for reimbursement of RAYALDEE.”


Despite these assurances however, we were only able to �nd sporadic coverage across


Medicare Part D plan providers.


Of the seemingly sparse number of Medicare providers that do grant access to Rayaldee, the


drug tends to be very expensive relative to competitors. According to FormularyLookup,


Rayaldee is typically in the highest tier expense brackets across its limited plan coverage. In the


overwhelming majority of cases, generics or alternatives (such as Calcitriol, Paracalcitol,


Rocaltrol, or Zemplar) were designated as a preferred covered alternative to Rayaldee.


In order to compare Rayaldee’s pricing with other Vitamin D analogues, we checked


GoodRx.com (https://www.goodrx.com/vitamin-d-analogues), an aggregator of prescription


drug prices across 70,000 U.S. pharmacies. As is shown below, competitor drugs cost as little as


$7-$14. The next most expensive drug in the category designed for treating CKD is Hectorol at


$360. Rayaldee by comparison is listed at $955, almost 3x the nearest competitor. Given that


drugs in higher “tier” formulary categories often have higher co-pays, the out-of-pocket


expenses for Rayaldee can be upwards of $300 per month even with insurance.


A call to Opko Connect con�rmed that a 1-month supply of Rayaldee typically sells for $900 to


$1,000, depending on the distributor.

https://www.goodrx.com/vitamin-d-analogues

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Rayaldee therefore appears to (i) lack insurance coverage in Medicare Part D, its most


important constituency, and (ii) be the high-cost, less-preferred drug in the category. We


believe the above issues makes Rayaldee a starkly uphill sales proposition.


Rayaldee: A Quiet Departure of Rayaldee
Management, and Con�icting Disclosures


There have been several high-level departures in key management and sales roles since the


launch of Rayaldee:


Jim DeMarco was listed as the SVP of Opko Renal sales on the Opko Renal Management


(http://www.opkorenal.com/about_us/management/bishop.html) website as of approximately


2 months ago, but he appears to have quietly left the company. His LinkedIn pro�le shows that


he is currently managing partner at the Elixir Group (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-demarco-


60457aa/), a business consulting �rm. DeMarco had been appointed as Senior Vice President of


pharmaceutical sales as announced via press release


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=966645) in April 2016. Per the release,


DeMarco was appointed to “support the anticipated launch of RAYALDEE.” The release further


elaborated on his extensive credentials and quali�cations:


Jim is uniquely quali�ed to establish and execute our commercial plans for RAYALDEE


in the US. His deep knowledge of the chronic kidney disease market will help bring


RAYALDEE to Stage 3 and 4 CKD patients,” said Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief


Executive O�cer of OPKO.


Given DeMarco’s loud entrance, we believe his silent departure is telling.


Douglas Laidlaw was listed as the Director of Medical A�airs on the Opko Renal “Management


Team (http://www.opkorenal.com/about_us/management/bishop.html)” website as of


approximately 2 months ago. Mr. Laidlaw’s hiring had also been announced via a glowing press


release (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=970463) in May of 2016:


“OPKO Health, Inc. today announced the appointment of Douglass Laidlaw, PhD as Vice


President of Medical A�airs to support the anticipated launch of RAYALDEE.” The release

Doug is a key addition to the management team in OPKO’s Renal Division,” said Phillip


Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive O�cer of OPKO. “A well-conceived and


executed medical education strategy is critical to Rayaldee’s acceptance by U.S.


healthcare professionals.


Despite the warm welcome, Mr. Laidlaw appears to have also left quietly. His Linkedin pro�le


(https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-laidlaw-phd-7a96712/) shows that he left the company in


June of this year and is now actively seeking a new opportunity. Given that his “critical” role


entailed educating the medical community on the importance of Rayaldee, we believe his


departure underscores the di�culty Opko has had at that very task.


Rayaldee Job Posting: In need of National Sales
Director to Develop Core Competencies


Opko is currently advertising a career opportunity


(http://chp.tbe.taleo.net/chp01/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=OPKO&cws=1&rid=160) for a


national sales director for the Rayaldee product. The posting underscores de�ciencies with the


current roll-out that the position seeks to address, stating that the national sales director is:


Responsible for developing & implementing core competencies for the regional sales


management & sales teams. Responsible for providing both strategic and tactical


direction for the national sales organization while maintaining a positive and


motivational work environment.


Given that the product launched over a year ago the absence of such a key role speaks


volumes.


Rayaldee: Use of “Co-Pay Assist” Programs


In the most recent quarterly press release


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517337350/d490503dex991.htm)


, the company stated that total prescriptions of Rayaldee in Q3 increased by 66% in Q3


compared to Q2, as reported by IMS. The pace has slowed considerably from the Q2 increase


of 140% compared Q1 prescriptions. Nonetheless the data at the very least suggests that sales


and growth of Rayaldee are taking place at some level. Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Given the fundamentals of the drug, we sought to explore exactly how the product was being


sold. We wondered; how does a product compete when it is relatively poorly di�erentiated and


priced 60x-130x higher than comparable generics and over-the-counter-vitamins? We believe


the answer is in part through co-pay assistance.


Note that in their purest form, co-pay assist programs are not illegal or untoward, as they


propose to o�er access to medicine for economically disadvantaged patients. Despite this,


allegations of widespread abuse of co-pay assist programs has led to severe pushback from


commercial insurers (http://www.mmm-online.com/commercial/pricing-debate-changes-


perception-of-patient-assistance-programs/article/475404/).


“Opko Connect (http://www.rayaldee.com/opko.html)” is a service that o�ers copay assistance


and patient access for Rayaldee to patients. As is stated openly on the website, with the copay


assistance program, “eligible commercially insured patients can �ll their Rayaldee prescription


for no more than $5 per month until the annual maximum limit is reached.” In our call with


Opko Connect, the representative candidly stated that “typically it’s a zero dollar co-pay.”


In other words, Rayaldee can compete with low-cost $7-$14 generics by making the drug cost


$0 to $5 dollars for the patient. Despite the low patient pricing, the insurer must still cover the


remainder of the cost of the drug, thereby de�ecting the burden to commercial plan


participants.


We contacted investor relations and asked the company to make the full data available on (1)


the portion of Rayaldee sales that use co-pay assistance, including Opko Connect; (2) any


solicitations to or donations to non-pro�t organizations that cover Rayaldee co-pays, which


non-pro�t organizations have covered Rayaldee co-pays; and (3) the number and percentage of


Rayaldee prescriptions that use non-pro�t organizations to cover co-pays. We have not heard


back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this accordingly.


hGH-CTP: How Many “Outliers” Must Be
Eliminated In Order to Make Phase III Trials Look
Good?


Outside of Rayaldee, hGH-CTP is the other “featured” drug cited in Opko’s earnings reports. The


drug is aimed to combat hormone de�ciency, and it showed early promise. In December 2014


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=887566), OPKO announced that they


had reached an agreement with P�zer for the development and commercialization of hGH-CTP.

http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=887566

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Under the terms of the agreement, OPKO received $295 million and is eligible to receive $275


million upon the achievement of certain goals/milestones. In the same press release, Phillip


Frost was quoted saying:


We believe that the global growth hormone market is currently valued at more than


$3 billion, and believe that hGH-CTP has the potential to be the best in class long-


acting growth hormone product.


After a long awaited Phase 3 clinical trial announcement, December 2016


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1005839) results showed that hGH-CTP


had failed to reach its primary endpoint. Following the outcome, in a slide in a January 2017


investor presentation


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517006863/d315559dex991.htm)


the company claimed to have “found an exceptional value of trunk mass reduction in the


placebo group”. A subsequent slide added “The exceptional data point warrants an outlier


sensitivity analysis.”


In other words, a lone outlier in the placebo group skewed the results.


The “exceptional value” represented in the original presentation seems to have transformed


later into “outliers”. Per a presentation in September 2017


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517278635/d410273dex991.htm)


the company stated that it had “completed post hoc outlier analysis in June 2017 to assess the


in�uence of outliers on the primary endpoint”. It also stated that “analysis which excluded


outliers showed statistically signi�cant di�erence between hGH-CTP and placebo.” Finally, the


presentation stated: “Additional analysis that did not exclude outliers showed mixed results.”


The presentation made no mention of a lone “exceptional value.”


We believe the shape-shifting outlier analysis does not bode well for the future of the drug. As


the company awaits for the results of future studies (we estimate in late 2018), the earlier


phase 3 failure suggests that a much-needed source of cash in the form of potential regulatory


milestones may be in complete jeopardy.


We contacted investor relations seeking disclosure on how many outliers the company has


found in its June 2017 post hoc outlier analysis of the hGH-CTP drug. We have not heard back


as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this accordingly.

4Kscore: Lowering Price Point and “Limited
Revenue” Signal a Flop


On the diagnostic side of the business, Opko’s key product is the 4Kscore, a test designed to


identify patients at a risk for high-grade prostate cancer.


For some context, in November 2013 (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=804005), OPKO announced a clinical validation study for a blood test called the


4Kscore test, which measures the serum levels of four di�erent prostate-derived kallikrein


proteins: total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA and hK2. The �rst 3 proteins are common markers


used in prostate testing but the company’s ‘secret sauce’ was use of the hK2 protein, which had


been shown in several studies to improve identi�cation of risks of prostate cancer. By April


2014 (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=836567), OPKO announced the


launch of the 4Kscore test in the United States.


The test is not FDA approved and has not undergone FDA scrutiny. Instead it is considered a


Laboratory Developed Test (LDT). The test had an initial price point of $1900 per test, which


compares poorly to common alternatives such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Risk


Calculator (which is free) and the Prostate Health Index, or PHI (which costs $80


(http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/825626#vp_2)). A slew of competition already exists


beyond these two common alternative tests. As industry authors have noted, a “bevy


(https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2016/february/a-bevy-of-biomarkers-battle-to-


replace-psa)” of biomarker alternatives seek to improve on the standard PSA test.


Worth noting is that unlike the 4Kscore, the PHI is FDA approved


(https://prostate.net/articles/new-psa-test-prostate-health-index-approved-by-fda). From an


e�cacy standpoint it compares similarly (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/825626#vp_2)


in identifying the risk of high-grade prostate cancer along with the 4KScore. The rigors of the


FDA process have enabled PHI to receive more widespread reimbursement through insurers.


By comparison, the 4Kscore has had di�culty receiving reimbursement.


This reimbursement di�culty can be discerned by the shifting disclosures in Opko’s investor


materials. A September 2015 company presentation


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312515327471/d10135dex991.htm)


had a slide detailing “Near Term Catalysts”, including the slide: “Coverage decisions on


reimbursement for 4Kscore test” which was assigned a date of 2015/2016. A later January 2017


presentation

again dedicated a slide to reimbursement and acknowledged that Palmetto GBA and CGS


Medicare Administrators had issued a “negative coverage determination” and that Opko was


“addressing concerns”. A September 2017 company presentation


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517278635/d410273dex991.htm)


simply dropped the reimbursement slide entirely.


In May 2017 (http://4kscore.com/news/announcing-drop-price-4kscore-test/), 4Kscore


announced that the cost for the test had been reduced from $1900 to $595, re�ecting both a


lack of demand and the di�culties with reimbursement. Despite the drop in price, the test is


still 7x more expensive than comparable alternatives such as the PHI.


Opko’s recent quarterly report


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480917000018/opk-


9302017x10q.htm) stated “We do not anticipate that we will generate substantial revenue from


the sale of proprietary pharmaceutical products or certain of our diagnostic products for some


time and we have generated only limited revenue from our…sale of the 4Kscore test.”


4Kscore and BioReference


We believe the failure of the 4Kscore roll-out is also a re�ection of the failure of the


BioReference acquisition. Management repeatedly cited that one of the key reasons behind the


BioReference acquisition was the synergy it would provide with the 4Kscore test. In September


2015, Dr. Frost went on CNBC’s Mad Money (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2DFrsTcaLU)


and promoted the BioReference acquisition by stating that it provides “access to a salesforce


and infrastructure that will help make our 4Kscore test one of the most important tests in the


history of the diagnostics business.”


The company similarly touted its BioReference acquisition on its Q2 2015 conference call


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/3669546-opkos-opk-ceo-dr-phillip-frost-q3-2015-results-


earnings-call-transcript?part=single) by stating the importance of the synergy for marketing its


4Kscore test:


…nowhere is the synergy of this merger more demonstrable than in marketing the


capabilities of our 4Kscore test to identify and di�erentiate patients in a noninvasive


manner to those that may progress to aggressive prostate cancer.

The BioReference acquisition took place at a time in the industry when pricing pressures were


not at the forefront of investor’s minds. At the time the BioReference acquisition was


completed, Valeant was peaking at about $220/share and was the darling of the


pharmaceutical world. The practice in the industry at the time among some companies was to


use related party pharmacies or a�liates as a channel to stu� consumers with high-priced


drugs.


Given the more competitive pricing landscape of the industry today we believe the 4Kscore test


is likely to require signi�cant additional price cuts if it is to be in any way competitive with


alternatives.


Remaining Pipeline Contributions Expected to be
“Incremental”


In JP Morgan’s recent downgrade report on September 14 , 2017, the report succinctly noted


that potential pipeline contributions over the next 6-18 months are “incremental” and unlikely


to meaningfully move the valuation needle.


While our analysis agrees that potential near & mid-term contributions are incremental, we


have also identi�ed a pattern of pipeline delays. A comparison of Opko’s investor presentations


given in September 2017


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517278635/d410273dex991.htm)

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517337350/d490503dex991.htm)


also shows some oddities.


The Curious Disappearance of Alpharen
(Fermagate)


The Alpharen Phase 3 trial was slated for “1H 2018” according to the September 2017 investor


presentation, but it has suddenly disappeared from the latest earnings release altogether.


By way of background, Alpharen was acquired by Opko along with another drug candidate and


announced via press release (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=732319) on


January 8, 2013 under the headline “Opko Health to Acquire Two Phase 3 Products”. By year-

end, the 2013 10-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480914000003/opk-


1231201310k.htm) stated “We are working with U.S. and European regulatory authorities to


�nalize the remaining phase 3 clinical program for AlpharenTM (Fermagate Tablets).” The


suggestion seemed to be that despite Alpharen’s phase 3 trials that had already taken place,


further clinical study was needed.


Later in the 2015 10-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480916000017/opk-


12312015x10k.htm) the company apparently dropped their European pursuits, stating:


We are currently preparing a single remaining Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S., but are


�rst studying novel characteristics of Alpharen which may o�er additional competitive


advantages.


Later the January 2017 presentation slated the Alpharen Phase 3 trial for “2H 2017”, but as


noted above it was subsequently pushed back again in September to “1H 2018” and now has


apparently disappeared entirely as of the earnings release.


We contacted investor relations seeking more information on the status of the Alpharen phase


3 trial and have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we will update this


accordingly. Given that a previous presentation


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/792641/000119312515227489/d944813dex991.htm)


has shown Alpharen to have a $1.2 billion market size we believe it is a very signi�cant item to


go missing.


Oxyntomodulin


The planned Oxyntomodulin Phase 2 trial has been recently delayed as well. The January ’17


presentation slated the trial for “2H 2017” whereas the September 2017 presentation slates the


trial for “1H 2018”.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
On Tuesday November 7 —the day before earnings—Opko announced that they had


submitted a Premarket Approval Application for the Total PSA test with the Claros 1


immunoassay analyzer. The press release (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=1047471) seemed to suggest that approval of the device is a foregone conclusion.


Per the release:


With more than 25 million PSA tests performed in the U.S. annually, the Claros 1 Total


PSA test represents a $625 million market opportunity. Once approved, we plan to


leverage BioReference Laboratory’s sizeable distribution and marketing capabilities to


make this rapid, in-o�ce test available for the bene�t of physicians and patients.


Despite management’s con�dence in the devices approval, we are cautious, namely given that


the �ling was delayed for about 5 years.


By way of background, Opko acquired (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=614706) Claros Diagnostics in October 2011 for $49 million


(http://archive.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2011/10/14/woburn_testing_�rm_claro


s_diagnostics_sold_for_nearly_50_million/). Claros makes a device that aims to take a �nger


stick of blood and get a result in 10 minutes via a portable, easy-to-use technology that can sit


in a physician’s o�ce. The approach and objective of Claros is similar to that of Theranos, and


several years ago Opko’s head of diagnostics even stated (https://www.360dx.com/business-


news/opko-preps-claros-1-poc-platform-quantitative-immunodiagnostics-market) that


Theranos was their main rival in the space.


The company has repeatedly promoted the potential of the Claros device, and in the most


recent quarterly report mentioned the device along with the 4Kscore as a key area of potential


synergy with the BioReference sales and marketing team.


Opko’s starting point for gaining acceptance of the Claros device is to gain approval for


Prostate-Speci�c-Antigen tests (PSA tests) which assess the risk of prostate cancer. Over time,


the goal is to add tests to the device to make it a more robust “point of care” diagnostic o�ering


including testosterone and vitamin D testing.


The company’s �rst major step to market Claros was the PMA �ling (a device �ling) with the


FDA. The �ling had been delayed for 5 years prior to its recent submission:

1. In December 2011, the company issued a press release


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=634642) announcing the


commencement of a U.S. clinical trial for the PSA test for their point-of-care diagnostic


test (i.e. Claros). The announcement stated that “Opko intends to submit its application to


the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of the assay in 2012.”


2. In January 2013, Phil Frost was interviewed on CNBC’s Mad Money


(https://www.cnbc.com/video/2013/01/28/opko-health-ceo-on-cytochromas-

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312513363824/d596458dex991

heading: “US FDA expected 2014”.


4. The company stated on an August 2015 conference call


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/3405495-opko-health-opk-ceo-phillip-frost-on-q2-2015-


results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) that they intend to �le with the FDA for the


PSA test in 1H 2016 and to also �le for the testosterone test in 1H 2016.


5. In a September 2015


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312515327471/d10135dex991.


htm) presentation the company downgraded that expectation, stating instead that it


anticipated a PMA �ling would be submitted to the FDA in 2016 (but not necessarily 1H


2016).


6. On March 1, 2017 the company issued a press release


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1015287) that stated “PMA �ling


anticipated in 1H 2017”. Given that the press release was in March, the implication was


that the �ling would potentially be made imminently.


7. Then, 7 months later in September the company stated that they will �le sometime in Q4


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312517278635/d410273dex991


.htm).


By November 7th 2017 the company announced that they had (�nally) submitted the �ling.


We believe the long delay with the FDA �ling could indicate a lack of con�dence in the device.


Given that the PMA process takes approximately 6 months we should expect an outcome


either way around Q2 of next year.


We contacted investor relations seeking comment on why the Claros �ling was delayed for


approximately 5 years and have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply we


will update this accordingly.

Frosts Insider Purchases are a Hollow Signal


Many Opko investors seem to be �xated on the insider purchases of Phil Frost, Chairman and


CEO of the company.


Frost has been consistently buying shares of Opko in the open market for over 10 years


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/898860/000114420407042162/xslF345X02/v084217_


ex.xml). While these purchases provide a stunning visual for those looking at an Opko chart


peppered with insider purchase markers, we view them as virtually meaningless to


shareholders who are not named Phil Frost.


Frost’s purchases have been a poor prognosticator of stock performance; they were made at


prices as high as $16.74 and at many points along the way down. Similarly, they represent a


fraction of Frost’s wealth. A Forbes article


(https://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/01/03/meet-miamis-renaissance-


billionaire/#6b07c3387306) from January suggested Frost’s net worth is over $4 billion. By that


measure, last year’s $25.8 million in purchases represents less than 0.64% of his total worth.


We estimate that Frost’s ownership in Opko represents at least 25%-35% of his net worth. At


this point is seems that he is tethered to the company regardless of outcome, and at 80 years


of age he is unlikely to embark on a new third act. We believe that with very few positive signs


to point to at the company, Frost is simply attempting to protect the stock via token insider


purchases in the hopes of buying more time.


Accelerating Cash Burn Highlights Near-Term
Liquidity Needs


Despite Frost’s e�orts, Opko appears to be running out of time. The company has generated a


negative operating cash �ow of $94.1 million in the �rst 9 months of the year, and has spent


over $32.0 million in capital expenditures. As of the most recent quarter-end


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480917000018/opk-


9302017x10q.htm) the company has only $100.4 million in cash and equivalents.


Additionally, Opko has relied more heavily on its revolving lines of credit. As of the most recent


quarter-end the company had drawn $105.9 million across its credit lines, compared to $80.7


million in the previous quarter and $47.3 million at year-end December 2016.

mid-term. Operating businesses have been burning cash at an increasing rate, and Opko’s cash


demands have historically been buoyed by up-front cash payments that are no longer


available:


A deal with P�zer on Opko’s hGH drug supported Opko with a $295 million in up-front


payment. That payment occurred during the March 2015


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480915000008/opk-


3312015x10q.htm) quarter, but the failure of the drug in Phase III trials could imperil any


subsequent or near-term milestone opportunities.


A 2016 agreement from 2016 with VFMCRP included $50m in up-front payments to


develop and market Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea, and


certain other international markets. The agreement includes $232 million upon the


achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. With the future of


Rayaldee in question (pending meaningful sales traction) these milestones may also be in


jeopardy.


We believe the company’s cash situation could be tightly constrained over the next 6 months


under a base-case scenario. When factoring in unknowns surrounding regulatory overhang,


there is a substantial risk that an adverse announcement could be crippling.
