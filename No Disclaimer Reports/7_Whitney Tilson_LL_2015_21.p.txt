Why I Covered My Short Position In Lumber Liquidators

Summary


In the past week, I’ve received information that leads me to believe that senior
management of Lumber Liquidators wasn’t aware that the company was selling
Chinese-made laminate that had high levels of formaldehyde.


If this information is correct, then the company was sloppy and naïve, but not evil.


If there are no “smoking gun” documents/emails, then the doomsday scenario for the
company (and the stock) is less likely, so I covered my short position today.


In the past week, I've received information (I can't reveal the details at this point) which
leads me to believe that it's likely that senior management of Lumber Liquidators
(NYSE:LL): 1) Wasn't aware that the company was selling Chinese-made laminate that
had high (non-CARB2-compliant) levels of formaldehyde; and 2) Made the decision to
continue selling the product even after the 60 Minutes story aired in large part because
they genuinely believed that the product was safe and compliant.


If true, this new information doesn't change certain key things - there's no doubt in my
mind that the company was, in fact, selling dangerous, formaldehyde-drenched laminate
and that it completely bungled damage-control efforts after the 60 Minutes story aired
(most damningly by continuing to sell the product for 67 more days) - but it does change
the narrative from a company that was knowingly endangering its customers to save on its
sourcing costs to one that was duped by Chinese suppliers and/or middlemen into
believing that it was receiving CARB2-compliant laminate. If so, Lumber Liquidators was
sloppy and naïve, but not evil. Many companies, alas, have unwittingly bought low-quality,
toxic and/or illegal products from Chinese suppliers.


Prior to today, even with the precipitous decline in the stock, which has plunged ~80% this
year, I maintained (and even added to) my short position in Lumber Liquidators because
of three factors:


1) The adverse publicity has tainted the brand and caused large numbers of customers to
avoid the company, which has led to a substantial drop in sales, margins and profits;
