Hailiang Education- China Hustle Déjà vu 
 


April, 9th 2018 
 
Hailiang Education​ is one of the hottest stocks on the NASDAQ, up 700% in the past 12 months. 
While some might show optimism in the company’s prospects based on changing educational 
policies in China, to Citron this seems more like the good ole China Hustle.  And guess what, they had 
the same underwriter as the recently halted Longfin Financial. 
 


 


 


We question when the SEC will open an informal or formal investigation into a company that has 


disclosures and non-disclosures that should have investors holding onto their wallets? 


Citron has a long history of reporting on Chinese companies and we played a central role in exposing 
many frauds in the 2010-2011 mania.  Most of our successes were based on finding red flags that are 
universal in nature and do not need an intimate knowledge of the Chinese business environment. 
 
In this report, we have simply decided, to itemize a series of red flags that would point to fraudulent 
practices at ​Hailiang Education Group. 
 
It all starts at the underwriter, while there is plenty of capital available in both China and the US, 


Haillang Education was brought public in August of 2015 by​ Network 1 Financial. 





 Network 1 Financial Securities.   


What we do know is that ​Network 1​ has a history if multiple securities violations -

Network 1​ seems to be the new Maxim or Rodman Renshaw when it comes to Chinese IPO’s -

​Marcum Chairman Drew Bernstein happened to have been a board member 
and chair of the audit committee at old school Chinese RTO Orient Paper.

  ​Hailiang Education Group seems to be taking a page out of the many 
Chinese RTO we have seen and is ​Transferring cash to related 3​rd​ party which is 
owned by majority owner of HLG 
 


● “Increasing amount of cash deposited and increasing amount allowed to be deposited at 
Hailiang Finance – owned by Hailiang Group which is controlled by HLG’s majority owner Feng 


Hailiang” 


● 2017 Risk Factors section: “​As of June 30, 2017, the balance of deposits we had with Hailiang 
Finance amounted to RMB462.7 million (approximately US$68.3 million).

 ​Trying to take advantage of investor’s complacency, Hailiang has started to 
publish press releases with companies that are ambiguous in nature. 
 
Here is a partnership with Pate’s Grammar School Trading Company on 9/25/17

Pate’s Grammar School Trading Company was established just a week before on 9/18/17

 It shouldn't be surprising that 2 board members have resigned in the past 6 
months for personal reasons. 


On November 1, 2017, Mr. Ying Xin has notified the Board of his resignation as the Company’s principal 
general and Director, effective immediately.

What has changed since 2010-2011? 


Unlike many Chinese RTO’s, In a post-2011 environment both accountants and attorneys have forced 
companies like ​Hailiang Education Group​ to disclose the material weaknesses in their procedures.  
 
Citron has NEVER seen anything as bad as Hailiang. 
 


 “​We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of 
June 30, 2017 and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure 
controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2017.  
 


 “As a result, we may be subject to a number of risks, including increased risks that we have 
or may not file our financial statements and related reports with the SEC on a timely basis and that 
there are errors in our reported financial statements and material misstatements in our reports and 
other documents filed with the SEC.” 
 
“As a result, our management determined that our internal control over financial reporting and 


our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2017.” 





 “​However, although we have carried out measures to address the material weakness in our 
internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures has not fully 
addressed the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and ​we cannot 
assure you that these measures will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness identified in 
our evaluation or that we will not identify additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in the 
future​.” 
 


 “The absence of effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls 
and procedures increases the risk that we have not, or may in the future not, file our financial 
statements and related reports with the SEC on a timely basis, that there may be errors in our 
financial statements or material misstatements or omissions in our related reports and documents 
filed with the SEC.”

And finally, the F word…  








 
 
 
 
 
 
What is refreshing is there are no analysts that are trying to defend this opaque company. 
 
 


Conclusion 
 
This report is not a reflection on all Chinese companies, rather it highlights the many warning signs 
that Citron has noticed in our years of uncovering fraud in Chinese RTOs. There is one thing we 
learned during the Chinese RTO era…if it looks like a duck and quacks like duck- odds are it’s a duck.
