Executive Summary

Short LHCG: Spruce Point Sees 35%-65% 
Downside to $60-$90 per Share


• AFAM Appears To Be Contracting: Disclosures regarding acquired inorganic revenue imply that AFAM has severely underperformed both Company and sell-side 
expectations. We estimate that AFAM revenue is now contracting after it was first expected to grow 5-6% per year. Management appears to avoid reporting 
AFAM growth, or has cherry-picked unrepresentative metrics which superficially project the appearance of improvement.


• Management Jumping Through Hoops To Flatter Organic Growth?: Management excludes AFAM from organic sales even though it was acquired ~21 months 
ago. This omission inflates reported organic growth by ~500 bps, from less than 2% to ~7%. Selective divestments of underperforming locations also inflate 
reported organic growth. This has saved a key LHCG metric – one followed closely by sell-side analysts – from collapsing at the hands of AFAM headwinds.


• The Cause – Bungled Integration? Or Customer Reallocation?: AFAM throughput appears to have suddenly collapsed immediately after the deal’s closure, and
has since fallen more than 30% below pre-deal levels. Throughput at legacy LHCG locations has simultaneously expanded by close to 10%. Could AFAM’s apparent 
contraction be explained by the cannibalization (purposeful or not) of AFAM locations by legacy LHCG locations? If so, LHCG’s high single-digit reported organic 
growth is being supported directly by cutbacks at locations not yet included in the organic base, which will inevitably weigh on organic growth once they are in 
fact included (as they should be already). We also find that, after claiming that the integration would be extremely swift, management has since subtly pushed 
forward its integration timeline on an almost quarterly basis. Today, more than two years after management first stated that the integration was already nearly 
complete, it is still in the process of integrating AFAM into LHCG’s software, and had integrated only about half of AFAM locations by the end of last quarter. We 
harbor significant doubts as to the competence of LHCG management and the continued viability of its roll-up strategy given these apparent integration issues.


• Concerning Purchase Accounting Adjustments: Management appears to have gradually increased AFAM’s bad debt allowance from $27M to $65M, suggesting 
that nearly half of acquired AFAM receivables may be uncollectible. The post-M&A purchase accounting adjustment window may also be giving LHCG a chance to 
take effective asset write-downs which do not flow through the income statement, and, therefore, which do not hit earnings. This, combined with ~$67M worth 
of integration costs through ~2 years and counting, has destroyed over $100M of shareholder value for holders of LHCG, nearly 15% of the AFAM purchase price.


• We See 40%-60% Downside After Taking Into Account LHCG's True Organic Growth, Earnings, And Business Risks: LHCG remains a popular “buy” among 
analysts enamored by the Company’s seemingly-robust organic growth profile and runway for tuck-in M&A, particularly following an Oct 31 update to Medicare’s 
Patient-Driven Groupings Model which was broadly perceived to be supportive of continued industry consolidation. Even then, the average analyst price target 
implies only 3% upside from current levels. Why should investors own stock in a Company which, in our opinion, misrepresents its organic growth profile by 
500bps, and whose management cannot effectively carry out its strategy at large scale? We expect organic underperformance and disappointing earnings to 
result in significant valuation compression from LHCG’s current 20.6x ‘20E EBITDA multiple – an all-time high for the stock.


LHC Group (“LHCG” or “the Company”) is a roll-up of post-acute home health centers which, in Apr 2018, completed a transformative merger of 
equals with fellow home health services provider Almost Family (“AFAM”). The merger was pitched to investors as a highly-synergistic deal which 


would produce a company capable of consistent mid-single-digit organic growth. However, Spruce Point’s forensic analysis of Company filings 
suggests that, whereas AFAM was expected to grow annually at 5-6% following the deal, the business is now contracting. At the same time, 


management appears to have taken steps to obfuscate AFAM growth and to avoid including it in organic sales, despite the fact that the deal closed 
~21 months ago. With AFAM included in LHCG organic sales, as it should be, organic growth would fall from a reported ~7% to less than 2%. 


Meanwhile, surreptitious purchase accounting adjustments and questionable “one-time” acquisition-related charges have erased nearly 15% of the 
announced deal value. With LHCG’s true organic growth far below reported levels, and with management appearing to have serious problems 


integrating AFAM into LHCG, we question not just LHCG’s reported organic growth and adjusted earnings figures, but the continued viability of 
management’s roll-up strategy itself – and, consequently, the growth-driven narrative underpinning the bull case for the stock.

Naïve LHCG Bull Case vs. Spruce Point Findings


A close forensic investigation of LHCG’s underlying organic growth and true profitability profile leads us to have a far more bearish view on the 
Company than the bullish industry consensus, which remains blind to major issues with its performance, strategy, and management team.


Topic Favorable Street Perception of LHCG Spruce Point Reality Opinion


AFAM Performance
No serious irregularities beyond typical integration 
concerns


• AFAM sales appear to have contracted for three straight quarters


Organic Growth 
Performance


Market-leading organic growth in the high single-digits


• Management is inappropriately excluding acquired AFAM locations more than 
four quarters following the acquisition


• By excluding AFAM locations from its organic base, LHCG’s organic base excludes 
half of its “true” organic locations (and its worst-performing)


• Excluding AFAM locations allows management to report high single-digit organic 
growth, which would otherwise be below 2%


• Throughput among AFAM locations has collapsed, raising questions as to 
integration issues or cannibalization (purposeful or not)


Management
LHCG has a committed, high-quality management team 
successfully executing on a lucrative roll-up strategy


• Management seriously underdelivered on its initial integration timeline. It has 
since effectively admitted that its initial integration goals, and perhaps the 
acquisition itself, were too aggressive.


• Explicit attempts to manage numbers to preserve the image of strong organic 
growth raises serious questions as to management’s credibility.


• Integration failures calls into question viability of roll-up strategy


Strategy Creating Value 
for Shareholders?


LHCG is generating real value for shareholders, as FCF 
per Share has doubled since the AFAM merger


• Management makes questionable adjustments to FCF to present a superficially 
impressive image of earnings power and cash generativity


• Purchase accounting adjustments following AFAM acquisition suggests that the 
deal destroyed value


Peer Comparison and 
Valuation


LHCG is performing at least in line with Amedisys 
(NASDAQ: AMED), its most relevant peer, and therefore 
deserves a premium multiple to the industry average


• LHCG is underperforming its peer group and is not deserving of its premium 
valuation, which is currently at an all-time high due to optimism over future 
M&A

Organic Growth Vastly Overstated Due To 
Omission Of Almost Family


Whether AFAM’s poor performance can be attributed to mismanagement or underlying flaws, Spruce Point believes that management’s omission 
of AFAM from LHCG organic sales after the merger’s anniversary date presents a severely skewed view of LHCG organic growth.


Whereas management reports that LHCG has grown organic sales by 6.1% and 7.5% in Q2 and Q3 FY19, respectively, its true organic growth rate 
is less than 2% when AFAM locations are included in the organic sales base – as they should be, with the acquisition having anniversaried in 


April of this year. Spruce Point estimates that, by excluding the contribution of Almost Family locations from organic growth, LHCG has inflated 
its reported organic growth by close to 500 bps in both Q2 and Q3.

Note: No data available for AFAM for Q1 FY18. AFAM location count above includes a marginal number of other acquired locations.


A close analysis of LHCG’s financial statements reveals a sudden and growing divergence between throughput at AFAM locations and legacy 
LHCG locations. Immediately following the acquisition, home health episodes per location declined sharply among former AFAM locations, and 
have since fallen by 57 events per month (31%) from pre-deal levels. Meanwhile, average throughput among legacy LHCG locations has risen by 


18 events per month (9%). Why did AFAM throughput fall so significantly following the acquisition, and, crucially, why has it continued to fall 
even as management moves closer towards completing the integration?


Importantly, as of Q3 FY19, LHCG has more locations excluded from organic growth (292) – the vast majority of which are AFAM locations – than 
it has organic locations (263). Accordingly, the contraction in throughput at AFAM – which is excluded from REPORTED organic sales growth –


has a larger proportional impact on “TRUE” organic sales growth than does the increase in throughput at legacy locations. The result: “true” 
organic sales growth is far lower than management’s reported figure, which excludes more than half of its locations (and its worst-performing).

LHCG Organic Home Health Growth Is Not 
Representative Of Underlying Growth Rate


While LHCG reports levels of organic home health growth roughly on par with AMED, its closest peer, Spruce Point believes that LHCG’s organic 
home health growth figure is misleading as reported, and is not a meaningful reflection of underlying Company performance. Importantly, with 


management continuing to exclude AFAM from organic sales, LHCG’s organic base temporarily includes less than half of its total locations. 
Meanwhile, AMED’s organic base includes 99% of its locations, making its own reported organic home health growth figure a much stronger 


indication of sustainable sales growth. Including AFAM locations in LHCG’s organic home health growth calculation (as they should be) reduces 
LHCG organic home health growth in Q2 and Q3 2019 from 6.6% and 7.9% to 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively – far behind AMED’s reported figures.

representative of LHCG’s underlying performance. We believe that, in reality, LHCG is underperforming AMED by a significant margin.

Even after having spent over $1B on acquisitions and related costs since FY14, LHCG has shown no material growth in free cash flow per share 
since the end of FY15. Accordingly, we question whether management’s roll-up strategy has generated meaningful (or any) value for LHCG 
shareholders. Management reports an adjusted free cash flow figure which adds back acquisition and other related costs, but Spruce Point 


believes that these costs are core to the economics of a roll-up like LHCG and, as such, should not be ignored.

LHCG Trading Above Sustainable Levels, But 
Multiples May Correct In The Near Term


Spruce Point believes that LHCG’s lofty valuation is driven by a broad misunderstanding of Company fundamentals among analysts and 
investors: its core growth trajectory, earnings power, and FCF profile all remain clouded behind discretionary accounting maneuvers which have 
obscured its recent missteps from plain view. However, as the most impactful of these maneuvers will persist only through the end of FY19, we 


believe that LHCG’s multiples are likely to contract in coming quarters as investors gain a clearer understanding of LHCG’s true financial 
performance. A company growing at less than half the organic rate reported by management, and with half as much earnings power and FCF 


generativity as would otherwise appear given management’s aggressive add-backs, does not deserve such a generous valuation, and investors 
will reevaluate LHCG accordingly once its underlying economics are laid bare in FY20.


Source: Bloomberg, Spruce Point Research


Spruce Point sees little chance that these valuations will persist once investors gain a clearer view into LHCG’s organic growth and earnings 
power, and once they understand the extent to which management has struggled to execute on its roll-up strategy.

Setting The Stage: LHCG Investors Bullish On 
Industry Developments, But Ignoring Company-
Specific Challenges?


Recent industry developments have driven significant interest in the home healthcare space among thematic healthcare investors through the 
past several quarters. Many have grown bullish over industry-wide consolidation, with larger home health providers rapidly consuming smaller 
regional players. Their bullishness has only been reinforced by recent sector developments. In particular, on Oct 31, 2019, Medicare announced 
changes to its Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM), under which the reduction in home health reimbursements (4%) was not as onerous as 
initially expected (8%), and under which requests for anticipated payment (RAPs) were slashed from 80% to 20% of the final payment amount. 
Investors interpreted the former development as providing a degree of relief to the industry as a whole, but the latter as a potential source of 


working capital strain for smaller regional players, potentially driving accelerated consolidation among industry leaders.


Taken together, these developments have enhanced investor bullishness across the major home health players, LHCG included. However, as we 
will demonstrate throughout this report, Spruce Point believes that the bulls bidding up LHCG shares on industry-wide news are ignoring glaring 


company-specific problems under the hood at LHCG.

Pitch To Investors: Two Industry Leading 
Companies Merging Into One


On Nov 16, 2017, LHCG and competing home health provider Almost Family (AFAM) announced plans to conduct a $1.8B merger of equals, which 
was subsequently completed on Apr 1, 2018. The merger created what was anticipated to be a $1.8B revenue company with 781 total locations, 


and the largest U.S. home health provider by location count. The deal was pitched primarily as an opportunity to reduce combined costs by 
merging two companies which were uniquely aligned in their focus on home health services (versus other forms of post-acute care) – and, 


importantly, which both appeared to have positive growth momentum. However, after analyzing Company disclosures, Spruce Point finds that the 
momentum seemingly demonstrated by Almost Family either may not have been what it appeared or might have since dissolved.

“As I think about growth, so Keith, obviously, you guys have done a really good job driving very healthy organic growth and 
William and Steve have done the same thing and bolstering that with M&A and JV. So how does this change, given that 
you're going to go through an integration? I know you have an unlevered balance sheet and you alluded to that in your

perhaps even accelerating the growth profile. Our balance sheet is clean. The volume of inbound calls and interest that we're 
getting from hospital and health system partners, in particular, is -- continues to increase. So I don't see anything that would curtail 
that. And we're really excited about the new growth opportunities. And Steve I'm going to let you all take that.”

faster, lower risk, higher return profile doing this together than we could possibly do it separately.”

LHCG Disclosures Regarding Inorganic Sales 
Conflict With Initial AFAM Growth Estimates


LHCG discloses its aggregate inorganic revenue from all recent acquisitions in its quarterly MD&A. Our independent analysis of each of LHCG’s 
individual deals allows us to deduce the implied revenue contribution of AFAM alone. Our analysis suggests that AFAM has experienced material 


top-line contraction since the deal was completed in Apr 2018, from $205M in Q2 FY18 to $193M in both Q2 and Q3 FY19. This stands in stark 
contrast to management’s pre-deal estimates which projected AFAM sales growth of 5% in FY19 and beyond.

1.  Estimated total inorganic revenue contribution of all recent LHCG acquisitions (excluding AFAM)
2. Revenue from purchased locations that has been in service with LHCG for 12 months or less, including all legacy AFAM locations for the period after April 1, 2018, as disclosed in the MD&As of LHCG’s quarterly and annual SEC filings

Almost Family Appears To Be Performing Far 
Below Initial Estimates


It appears that Almost Family continues to underperform both management and Wall Street projections long after the deal was completed in Apr 
2018. LHCG management stated that it expected Almost Family to generate $850M of revenue through FY18, up 9% from FY17. Sell-side analysts 
expected Almost Family to generate $822M prior to its acquisition by LHCG, up 5% from the prior year. Management disclosures, however, imply 


that Almost Family underperformed both estimates, generating $803M in revenue in FY18 – up just 2.6% – and that, through the first three 
quarters of FY19, its sales have been in significant decline. This rapid reversal in AFAM performance following its acquisition by LHCG gives us 


serious concerns both for the underlying health of AFAM itself and for the quality of LHCG management.

Acquisition anniversary date 


Management Suspiciously Kicking The Organic 
Anniversary Date Down The Road


With the merger having closed on Apr 1, 2018 and anniversarying on Apr 1, 2019, Almost Family revenue should have been included in LHCG's 
organic growth calculations as of Q2 FY19. However, management surreptitiously amended its definition of organic growth in Q2 FY19 explicitly 
to exclude Almost Family locations from organic growth, citing “continued system integrations.” Spruce Point finds it extremely suspicious that 
LHCG would amend its organic growth definition to exclude the sales contribution of a single acquisition, however material, which is well past its 


anniversary date – particularly after management claimed adamantly that the Almost Family integration process would be swift. Is Almost 
Family’s slow growth a product of organic headwinds, a difficult integration process, overlapped locations, or some combination thereof? 


Regardless, Spruce Point finds management’s decision to exclude Almost Family from organic growth highly suspect.

Organic Growth Vastly Overstated Due To 
Omission Of Almost Family


Whether AFAM’s poor performance can be attributed to mismanagement or underlying flaws, Spruce Point believes that management’s omission 
of AFAM from LHCG organic sales after the merger’s anniversary date presents a severely skewed view of LHCG organic growth.


Whereas management reports that LHCG has grown organic sales by 6.1% and 7.5% in Q2 and Q3 FY19, respectively, its true organic growth rate 
is less than 2% when AFAM locations are included in the organic sales base – as they should be, with the acquisition having anniversaried in 


April of this year. Spruce Point estimates that, by excluding the contribution of Almost Family locations from organic growth, LHCG has inflated 
its reported organic growth by close to 500 bps in both Q2 and Q3.

Note: No data available for AFAM for Q1 FY18. AFAM location count above includes a marginal number of other acquired locations.


A close analysis of LHCG’s financial statements reveals a sudden and growing divergence between throughput at AFAM locations and legacy 
LHCG locations. Immediately following the acquisition, home health episodes per location declined sharply among former AFAM locations, and 
have since fallen by 57 events per month (31%) from pre-deal levels. Meanwhile, average throughput among legacy LHCG locations has risen by 


18 events per month (9%). Why did AFAM throughput fall so significantly following the acquisition, and, crucially, why has it continued to fall 
even as management moves closer towards completing the integration?


Importantly, as of Q3 FY19, LHCG has more locations excluded from organic growth (292) – the vast majority of which are AFAM locations – than 
it has organic locations (263). Accordingly, the contraction in throughput at AFAM – which is excluded from REPORTED organic sales growth –


has a larger proportional impact on “TRUE” organic sales growth than does the increase in throughput at legacy locations. The result: “true” 
organic sales growth is far lower than management’s reported figure, which excludes more than half of its locations (and its worst-performing).

LHCG Organic Home Health Growth Is Not 
Representative Of Underlying Growth Rate


While LHCG reports levels of organic home health growth roughly on par with AMED, its closest peer, Spruce Point believes that LHCG’s organic 
home health growth figure is misleading as reported, and is not a meaningful reflection of underlying Company performance. Importantly, with 


management continuing to exclude AFAM from organic sales, LHCG’s organic base temporarily includes less than half of its total locations. 
Meanwhile, AMED’s organic base includes 99% of its locations, making its own reported organic home health growth figure a much stronger 


indication of sustainable sales growth. Including AFAM locations in LHCG’s organic home health growth calculation (as they should be) reduces 
LHCG organic home health growth in Q2 and Q3 2019 from 6.6% and 7.9% to 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively – far behind AMED’s reported figures.

A Mismanaged Integration Process, Or Gaming 
Throughput To Boost Organic Growth?


What is the cause of the divergence in throughput between AFAM locations and legacy LHCG locations which is weighing on “true” organic 
growth? Perhaps a seemingly mishandled integration process has taken a heavy toll on AFAM, making it difficult for LHCG to maintain AFAM’s 


customer base or to replenish normal churn. Alternatively, we note that, of the 243 metro areas in which LHCG operated at the time of the 
acquisition, 39 (16%) overlapped with territories covered by AFAM. Could organic LHCG locations be cannibalizing AFAM locations which 


continue to be excluded from the reported organic base? Even worse, could LHCG management simply be re-designating former AFAM business 
as legacy LHCG business in territories in which both AFAM and LHCG were present?


“So, I guess, starting off, it's been nearly 2 years that you 
guys have acquired Almost Family. What are the 
lessons have you learned from that acquisition? And 
how do you see the M&A market going forward in the PDGM 
environment and what lessons can you take from the 
acquisition into that?”


- Anthony Makdessi – JP Morgan
“So I think lessons learned for me. I would say I have 
a more full appreciation for the value and not trying 
to do an integration of that size on a shoestring, 
but to have it well planned out and to bring in a third-
party to manage the process because that allowed us 
not to take our eye off the ball on our core business.”

Management Statements Appear Either To Hide 
AFAM Headwinds Or Reveal Gross Mismanagement


On its Q2 FY19 earnings call, management blamed the delay in including AFAM in organic sales on its slow integration into Homecare Homebase, 
a business management software platform designed for the home health industry. We find this curious given that, on its post-M&A conference 


call, management claimed that AFAM had already been integrated into Homecare Homebase. Management has since gradually backtracked from 
this statement, retreating from the claim that the integration was already complete to state that migrating AFAM onto LHCG's instance of 


Homecare Homebase would “require a few tweaks,” and finally admitting that the integration would draw out until year-end FY19. We find these 
explanations suspect given management’s enthusiastic claim that the integration would be swift precisely because AFAM was well-positioned for 
a swift transition into LHCG's software. Regardless, it appears either that (1) AFAM is in decline as a stand-alone business or (2) management is 
seriously mismanaging the AFAM integration. Neither explanation should give investors confidence in management or the combined business.


“So if you just think about Kanye West, bigger, faster, stronger, right, so we're delevering 
the balance sheet. This is going to be a straightforward integration. I don't want to 
get too far ahead of ourselves, but we've already integrated the home health 
agencies of Almost Family into Homecare Homebase, which is the same platform 
that's being used at LHC. So we're just that much further ahead. We're going to 
ultimately integrate the personal care operations into the platform that Almost Family 
uses. So that's going to go pretty well. We've got a great deal of experience doing that.”

LHCG M&A Call (Nov 16, 2017): “ALREADY INTEGRATED”

LHCG Q2 FY19 Earnings Call (Aug 8, 2019): “BY YEAR END”


“In summary, the quarter's results reinforce our growth thesis built on strong organic 
growth, differentiation in quality and patient satisfaction scores, the ability to move 
from cost to revenue synergies with Almost Family as we complete the Homecare 
Homebase integration by year-end, incremental margin improvement with additional 
levers yet to be pulled and significant momentum on the M&A front.”


- Joshua Proffitt – CFO & Treasurer, LHCG


LHCG Q1 FY18 Earnings Call (May 3, 2018): “a few tweaks…”


“The next thing that I would say is that even though that Almost Family is on 
Homecare Homebase, they have 3 different instances which are, of course, different 
than ours. And I've told people it's kind of like having the same dimensions of a home but 
the walls and the rooms inside of it, a little bit different. And so when we overlay our 
operating model, it's going to require a few tweaks, but we are sequentially getting to 
that point, so there's no flip of the switch.”


- Donald Stelly – President & COO, LHCG


LHCG Q2 FY18 Earnings Call (Aug 2, 2018): “through Q1”


“The rollout is complete, so Homecare Homebase is inside of the existing portfolio. My 
commentary was about a unified, what we're calling instance…. Homecare Homebase is 
the vehicle but the configurations of the workflow are not like the legacy LHC. The timing 
of that is probably going to go through Q1. But unlike in previous, we don't expect any 
margin decay as we do that. And so Josh's numbers that he's guided to incorporates that. 
And I think it will be upside when we announce our guidance next March.”


- Donald Stelly – President & COO, LHCG


Baird Healthcare Conference (Sep 5, 2018): “start January 1”


“We are through the initial phase of integration and now we are moving to converting 
everything to one instance of Homecare Homebase so that we can start January 1 
with everyone on the same platform. In 2019, I think we will be focused on field 
integration and getting everyone inside of our model.”


- Donald Stelly – President & COO, LHCG


LHCG Q3 FY18 Earnings Call (Nov 1, 2018): “second quarter”


“As for what is left to do in the integration, we have begun to convert Almost Family

last through the second quarter of 2019.”

Integration Performance Suggests Stunning 
Level Of Mismanagement


On its Q3 FY19 earnings call, management revealed that, prior to the third quarter, just 130 of Almost Family’s 240+ home health locations had 
been converted to LHCG's instance of Homecare Homebase. After Almost Family has been under the LHCG umbrella for over a year, why did it 
take management so long to convert only just over half of AFAM locations to LHCG's billing platform when it first claimed that the conversion 


would be extremely swift? Now claiming that 87% of AFAM locations have been integrated (as of the time of the Q3 earnings call), is management 
now rushing to finish the job?


LHCG Q3 FY19 Earnings Call: Nov 7, 2019


“In addition to the accelerated growth we anticipate from PDGM disruption in 
the marketplace that Keith discussed earlier, another significant incremental 
organic growth opportunity as we head into 2020 is, of course, our expected 
admissions acceleration from the Almost Family locations. In the 130 Almost 
Family locations fully converted to LHCG Group's instance of 
Homecare Homebase prior to the third quarter, we demonstrated 
sequential organic growth in home health admissions of 1.2% in the quarter 
as compared to the second quarter despite the fact that Q3 is typically a 
seasonally lower volume quarter than Q2.”


- Joshua Proffitt – CFO & Treasurer, LHCG

Why Is Management Being So Selective In Its 
Discussion Of Almost Family Growth?


Management disclosed growth at Almost Family in Q4 FY18, but abruptly ceased making any references to Almost Family growth in Q1 FY19, 
immediately preceding management’s explicit exclusion of AFAM from its organic growth calculations as the acquisition anniversaried in Q2. Not 
until Q3 did management again discuss growth at Almost Family in its integration updates, providing only a cherry-picked measure of quarterly


growth which ignored continued year-over-year top-line contraction. Spruce Point interprets LHCG's selective and inconsistent disclosure of 
AFAM performance as an indication that management is attempting to avoid providing a complete picture of AFAM growth.

Questionable Governance Over Financial 
Controls Raises Red Flags


Spruce Point finds it curious that LHCG’s CFO, Joshua Proffitt, is a lawyer by trade, and has no other professional or academic financial 
experience beyond a bachelor’s degree in accounting. We would expect a $3B publicly-traded company to have a CFO with a CPA, MBA, or other 


material financial and/or accounting experience. We also find it curious that he signs LHCG’s financial filings as the Company’s Principal 
Accounting Officer. Spruce Point believes that this responsibility should fall to an individual other than the CFO so as to provide better oversight 
over LHCG’s financial function, particularly as it is currently being run by an individual with no dedicated financial experience outside of LHCG.


Furthermore, we observe that, following the AFAM deal, C. Steven Guenthner – AFAM’s former CFO who, unlike Proffitt, does have a background 
in finance, and was a CPA – was designated LHCG’s Chief Strategy Officer following the merger. Would he not have been a better fit for the post-


merger CFO role? And would Proffitt, with a background in law and M&A, not have been a better fit for the CSO role? We wonder whether 
Guenthner was offered the CFO role at the time of the merger, and whether he declined out of a lack of interest in signing LHCG’s SEC filings…


A Lawyer By Trade Serving As CFO, and Signing LHCG’s SEC Filings as Principal Accounting Officer?


Why Didn’t Guenthner Become CFO Instead?


Spruce Point is concerned that the anomalies and obfuscations which we observe in LHCG’s filings may be the product of a weak financial 
function headed by an unfit CFO.

Location Divestitures Create Additional Avenue 
For Superficial Organic Growth


We are concerned that other actions taken by management have rendered reported organic growth even less representative of the underlying 
health of the business. We note that LHCG has divested of 73 locations (9% of total) since Jan 1, 2017. By divesting of underperforming locations 
and subsequently excluding them from organic growth calculations, management effectively erases the effect of underperforming locations on 
organic growth, thereby inflating its reported “same-store” sales growth performance. Of course, management also adds closure-related costs 


back to Adj. EBITDA, thereby sparing it from any earnings penalties for performing such maneuvers.

By jettisoning underperforming locations and 
subsequently excluding them from its growth base, 
management can present an inflated picture of its 


ability to grow sales from its existing base of 
locations


By adding costs associated with closures back to 
Adj. EBITDA, management avoids penalizing itself for 


eliminating underperforming stores


As LHCG regularly closes underperforming locations, Spruce Point believes that management should not add closure-related costs back to 
Adjusted EBITDA, as closure costs are a part of regular run-rate expenses.
27


Purchase Accounting Adjustments Raise 
Questions As To Health Of AFAM


At year-end FY17, Almost Family reported $153M gross and $126M net accounts receivable, respectively. However, following the acquisition, 
LHCG made incremental purchase accounting adjustments to the initial AFAM receivable balance for five straight quarters – right up until the 


deadline for such adjustments – slashing AFAM’S initial net accounts receivable balance to just $88M. At best, this suggests that 42% of Almost 
Family (gross) accounts receivable acquired in the acquisition may have been uncollectible (see below). At worst, we note that management 


could have used this tactic to preemptively “write down” the value of acquired accounts receivable, thereby avoiding potential future write-offs 
which could have weighed on Company earnings, while at the same time creating a bad debt “cookie jar” on which it could draw to offset 


aggressive revenue recognition in the future.

Spruce Point calls on LHCG management to explain these large and consistent purchase accounting adjustments to Almost Family’s accounts

AFAM’s aggregate bad debt expense over its final two years as a public company was reported as ~1.8% of net service revenue (on a pre-ASU 
2014-09 basis). However, when we add the apparent “bad debts” implied by LHCG’s subsequent purchase accounting adjustments to this figure, 


we find that AFAM’s “true” bad debt expense was at least 4.5% of net service revenue – nearly 2.5x the figure reported by AFAM.1


This appears to conflict with management’s confident response to an analyst’s concern that AFAM collections could be an issue.

“And then thinking about the big deals you did last year and now with Almost Family, are you expecting any --
I don't want to say issues or integration issues with billing and collections? Will it take a little bit of time?”


- Kevin Ellich – Craig-Hallum Capital Group
“No. We actually feel really good about that. There's -- I'll take Almost Family since it's the most current and pressing and 
the largest. They have a, as you would imagine being a public company, they had a very robust and sophisticated 
billing and collections back office support system up in Louisville and although over time, we'll be able to kind of take

Between LHCG's write-down of $56.2M of net tangible assets and its recognition of “one-time” acquisition-related costs totaling $66.7M (pre-
tax) to date, the Almost Family merger has, by our estimates, cost LHCG investors $104M of “hidden costs.”

GAAP EPS Non-GAAP EPS Delta


As is the case with many companies investigated by Spruce Point, LHCG shows an increasingly large spread between GAAP and Non-GAAP 
income. Since the beginning of FY18, one-time expenses associated with closures and mergers (almost exclusively AFAM) have ballooned. As 


acquisitions and closures represent normal on going expenses, we believe that GAAP income is a far better measure of LHCG’s economic reality 
than is LHCG’s non-GAAP net income measure, which has exceeded GAAP earnings by ~50% since 2018.

Widening Spread Between GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS


LHCG has added back AFAM-related 
M&A expenses for eight straight 


quarters, with the highest amount 
coming as recently as 3Q19


Why should investors continue to 
excuse management of these 


“acquisition” costs nearly two years 
after the deal was completed?


Closure-related expenses represent a 
normal, recurring cost for LHCG, which, 


like other home healthcare providers, 
must shutter locations from time to time.


They should not be added back as “one-
time charges.”
31


Even after having spent over $1B on acquisitions and related costs since FY14, LHCG has shown no material growth in free cash flow per share 
since the end of FY15. Accordingly, we question whether management’s roll-up strategy has generated meaningful (or any) value for LHCG 
shareholders. Management reports an adjusted free cash flow figure which adds back acquisition and other related costs, but Spruce Point 


believes that these costs are core to the economics of a roll-up like LHCG and, as such, should not be ignored.

LHCG Hitting FCF Targets Only With The Help Of 
Questionable Ad Hoc Adjustments


Spruce Point observes LHCG management falling into a worrisome pattern of hitting guidance only with the help of novel and questionable 
adjustments. For example, on its Q1 FY18 earnings call, management affirmed full-year FCF guidance of $110M for the combined business. 


When it came time to meet this guidance in Q4 FY18, management issued a new quarterly earnings supplement which included a proprietary 
Adjusted FCF metric, reflecting $50M of “one-time EBITDA adjustments.” Applying these adjustments to FCF, management hit its $110M FCF 
target exactly on the nose – but it failed to tax-adjust these pre-tax EBITDA adjustments before applying them to post-tax FCF. Whether this 


was a conscious and aggressive maneuver by management to hit guidance or simply an honest error, Spruce Point is concerned about the fact 
that LHCG’s ability to hit its forecast ultimately came down to this.


“I think in your presentation, you guys had stated $110 million of free cash 
flow. Is that still kind of the target?”


- Kevin Ellich – Craig-Hallum Capital Group “Yes, that’s right.”

Purchase Accounting Adjustments: Hypothetical EPS Impact


We are intrigued by the fact that, in Q2 FY19, LHCG’s preliminary allocation for its “Trade Names” intangible asset was reduced to $76.1M from 
an initial $116.7M. While trade name assets associated with AFAM were all designated indefinite-lived by LHCG, we wonder whether this 


designation was appropriate, particularly as management appears not to be using the “Almost Family” name as regularly. Had this $40.6M of 
reassigned intangibles instead initially been categorized as trade name assets with a useful life of 9 years – approximately equal to the average 


useful life of LHCG’s current definite-lived trade name assets, per its most recent 10-K – the resulting increase in amortization would have 
reduced LHCG EPS by ~$0.12 by our estimates. Interestingly, reducing the Company’s trade name asset by $40.6M and increasing full-year EPS 


by a hypothetical $0.12 allowed management to just hit its $3.55 EPS target for maximum executive compensation.

Potentially Misleading Performance Metrics Drive 
Valuation Multiples Out Of Line With Reality


Our work reveals that LHCG has grown its top line at only a 2.2% rate excluding growth from all acquisitions completed since the AFAM merger. 
This is a far cry from the high single-digit organic growth rate touted by LHCG management. Nonetheless, the market appears to buy into 


management’s bullish narrative with little reservation, as LHCG’s EV/EBITDA multiple has expanded by nearly twelve turns since the AFAM deal 
was first announced in 2017. We believe that this has inflated LHCG’s share price to a level far above what would otherwise be reasonable for a 


low single-digit organic growth company struggling to execute on a roll-up strategy.


Source:  LHCG and AFAM Filings, Spruce Point Estimates
(1) FY17 Revenues are pro forma for AFAM’s and other announced revenue contributions and reflect the presentation to conform to ASU 2014-09 for comparability purposes.   
FY 17 Revenues = LHCG FY17 GAAP revenues less bad debt expense + AFAM FY 17 GAAP revenues less bad debt expense + Announced LHCG Acquired Revenue from 1Q18 thru 3Q19 (excluding AFAM)

Spruce Point believes that LHCG’s premium valuation prices in misleading measures of organic growth and free cash flow which paper over 
emerging problems in management’s roll-up business model, and problems with the recent AFAM deal in particular.

Aggressive Insider Selling Accelerates Through 
AFAM Acquisition


LHCG insiders have sold the stock aggressively through the past four years, slashing their collective stake by over 50% over this time span. CEO 
Keith Meyers has been particularly aggressive in his selling, reducing his personal stake by 40% over the same period. Notably, in 2018 – the year 
following LHCG’s initial announcement of the AFAM acquisition – Meyers sold nearly one third of his remaining shares. Investors should be wary 


of the fact that insiders have increasingly chosen to limit their exposure to the stock even as analysts have grown progressively more bullish 
about the stock amidst industry-wide tailwinds.

LHCG Insider Ownership: Highlights
37


Holders of AFAM shares received 0.915 LHCG shares for each of their AFAM shares following the LHCG merger, leaving a number of AFAM 
insiders with large holdings of post-merger LHCG shares. However, not all of these AFAM insiders became LHCG insiders following the merger. 
Consequently, among previous LHCG and AFAM insiders (named employees and directors), three of the top five holders of post-merger LHCG 
shares were not insiders after the deal was completed, leaving them free to sell their LHCG shares without having to file with the SEC. Spruce 


Point is concerned that “effective” insider selling might have accelerated even more rapidly following the completion of the deal, as individuals 
with intimate knowledge of AFAM might have sold their shares without other investors’ knowledge.

Post-Merger LHCG Losing Credibility Among 
Institutional Shareholders


Large institutional shareholders who were among the largest owners of LHCG and AFAM stock prior to the merger have since sold most or all of 
their post-merger LHCG shares. Spruce Point believes that poor post-merger execution by LHCG management has cost the Company a degree of 


its prior credibility, turning off large institutional managers from holding LHCG stock.

Widespread Bullishness Ignores Weaknesses 
Hidden Underneath Superficial Growth


With all but two analysts rating LHCG a “buy,” the sell side is unsurprisingly exceedingly bullish on the stock. However, it assigns LHCG an 
average price target of $146, just 3% above current levels. Widespread bullishness for LHCG’s stock rests on the perception that management 


will continue to capitalize on a roll-up strategy with which Spruce Point detects overwhelming execution problems. We believe that this valuation 
is misinformed due to the market’s drastic misunderstanding of LHCG’s true organic growth, underlying EBITDA, and FCF profile, all reinforced 
by significant obfuscations and ad hoc adjustments. With the stock trading at both an all-time high price and all time-high valuation, we believe 


that the stock’s risk / reward profile skews significantly to the downside.

LHCG Improperly Trading Above The Average 
Valuation Of Its Peers


We believe that investors must reevaluate LHCG’s current valuation in the context of its true organic growth profile, and taking into account the 
apparent risks to management’s roll-up strategy. Trading at 21.0x EV/ 2020E EBITDA, LHCG shares are valued at a ~48% premium to peers on an 


EV/EBTIDA basis, against the industry average of 14.1x. Even then, we believe that this valuation is misinformed and based on LHCG’s 
misunderstood core growth trajectory, earnings power, and FCF profile. A company growing at less than half the organic rate reported by 
management, and with half as much earnings power and FCF generativity as management suggests, does not deserve such a generous 


valuation. LHCG’s apparent struggle to execute on its roll-up strategy only raises further questions as to the validity of the bull case and, 
accordingly, the rich multiple on the stock.

Spruce Point Sees 35%-65% Downside In
LHCG Shares


Given LHCG’s weak organic growth performance and poor FCF profile, Spruce Point believes that LHCG shares should be valued at a multiple 
more in line with lower-growth and lower-quality health service peers. We anticipate that, as LHCG inevitably rolls poor-performing AFAM 


locations into its organic growth base, investors will gain a clearer understanding of LHCG’s true organic growth, and valuation multiples will 
likely revert to its historical norm (~12.0x) from all time highs.

Broad investor misunderstanding of LHCG’s underlying economics have driven rapid multiple expansion on the back of perceived organic

organic growth in FY20, giving the stock considerable downside at current levels.
