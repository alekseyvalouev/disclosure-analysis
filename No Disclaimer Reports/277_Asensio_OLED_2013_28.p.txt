European Patent Office Issues Uncommon
Decision revoking Universal Display’s alleged
pioneering OLED patent.


Posted on November 22, 2013 by asensio.com


Munich, Germany, November 21, 2013. Today asensio.com, a


publisher of meaningful reviews of public company

Manuel P. Asensio, the founder of asensio.com, stated, “Others have

European Patent Office opposing UDC’s cornerstone key patents. A


high court trial with virtual finality in the entire European Union.
