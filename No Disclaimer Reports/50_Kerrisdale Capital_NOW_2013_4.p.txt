ServiceNow: Disaffected Customers Mark The Peak Of Its Hype Cycle
Jan. 9, 2013 8:30 AM ET10 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


In our first two reports, we argued that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the "Company") is
extremely overvalued. We offered a wide range of data points that helped us arrive at that
conclusion, including revenue growth deceleration, market size limitations, and
accelerated insider selling, amongst others. In this article, we'll provide additional
granularity on the wave of headwinds faced by the stock, including unrealistically high Q4
expectations, a tripling of the float in February, and valuation errors made by parts of the
sell-side analyst community. Additionally, we've included quotations from the ITSM peer
review website (helpdeskreport.com) and third-party independent experts that show that
ServiceNow has its fair share of dissatisfied customers. Once these customers begin to
voice their frustrations, this discontent could reverberate through the industry, making new
account wins become increasingly challenging.


We believe that ServiceNow's current valuation is reflective of a temporary frenzy rather
than fundamental risk-adjusted, discounted cash flow analysis. Regardless of NOW's
technology profile, the stock trades at a price that makes it an exceedingly risky
investment. We believe that a combination of overlooked option dilution, unrealistically
high earnings expectations, and lockup expirations could cause the investment community
to reconsider the medley of risks inherent in this momentum stock.


Many Wall Street Analysts Neglect Option Dilution in their Share Price Targets

As we first mentioned in our November 15th report, financial databases such as Capital IQ
and Bloomberg have neglected to include NOW's highly dilutive option pool in their market
capitalization figures. This has led some investors to mistakenly source incorrect valuation
figures when defending NOW's stock price. According to NOW's November 15th
prospectus, the Company has a 37.3m share option pool with a weighted-average
exercise price of $4.48 (page 7 of the prospectus). These options must be considered in
addition to 1.1m restricted stock units. At NOW's current price of $26.20 per share, the
Treasury Stock Method allows us to calculate a 30.9m share dilutive effect from the option
and restricted stock pools. These issuable shares must be counted alongside NOW's
125.3m (includes 0.2475m greenshoe) common shares, leading to a true share count of
157.3m and a current market capitalization of $4.1bn.


While we weren't completely surprised that some financial databases overlooked the
option pool, we're astounded to learn that numerous bulge bracket equity research
analysts appear to have made the same mistake. One of the most heavily cited figures in
the typical analyst report is the price target. In order to properly calculate a price target,
the analyst must first determine the proper diluted share count. After reading through the
sell-side reports on NOW, we noticed that about half of the analysts calculated their price
targets using only the common shares. As should be expected, this mistake has a material
impact on the price target. We've found that analysts using an incorrect share count have
an average price target of ~$40 while those that utilize a fully diluted share count have an
average price target of about $32.


Below is a summary of the seven bulge bracket equity research analysts, broken down
into the banks who included and excluded the significantly dilutive impact of options.

It is shocking that the analysts from Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup do not
appear to include the 30m+ additional shares from dilutive options in their market
capitalization calculations. Their share count calculations are off by nearly 25%. This is
inexcusable.


We have set up a website at www.facts-about-servicenows-total-share-count.com to
express our dismay. The current site is sparse, but we have high hopes for it. Inspired by
Bill Ackman, we hope to launch an activist campaign to get the equity research community
to properly calculate ServiceNow's total share count.


Considering that the 30.9m share effect from the options increases the market
capitalization by about 25% (30.9/125.3), it's logical that the difference in average share
price between the groups ($40 and $32) works out to about the same amount. As
management continues to dole out even more stock-based compensation to attract talent,
the option pool should only get larger. The Company has reserved an additional 11.6m
shares for future issuance under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 5m shares under the
2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (page F-26 of the Nov 15th prospectus). In the real
world, as opposed to ServiceNow equity research fantasyland, these additional options
will further dilute common shareholders.

During each quarterly earnings season, Wall Street and cloud software management
teams typically undergo a well-rehearsed dance routine. In the first act, management sets
financial expectations unduly low. Then, to everyone's apparent surprise, the company
serendipitously beats those original estimates. This carefully orchestrated performance is
meant to trigger a rowdy applause from the investor audience, presumably so that the
show's front row viewers, the venture capital firms, can quietly sneak out the door to
escape the long queues for the exits when the tragicomedy is over.


But, alas, the market isn't that naive. Increasingly, overhyped cloud IPOs are suffering
dramatic price declines even when earnings releases beat analyst estimates. NOW's most
recent quarterly report was a perfect example. NOW beat the consensus Q3 2012
earnings estimates by almost 4%, yet the stock fell over 10% the day after the October
24th release. The clearest explanation for this is that NOW's 16x 2012E revenue multiple
comes with a price: incredibly high expectations. Not only must NOW beat its guidance, it
must do so very convincingly. NOW reports its Q4 earnings on January 30th, 2013 and the
consensus revenue estimate is $70.6m (CapIQ). Failure to surpass these expectations by
a double-digit percentage could lead to another sharp price correction.

Deeper examination of this trend reveals a widespread disaffection for high-multiple SaaS
companies that only modestly beat Wall Street's revenue targets. Splunk
(NASDAQ:SPLK), a 'Big Data' SaaS software provider with a $3.4bn fully diluted market
capitalization (10-Q Q3 2012) and a 16x 2012 revenue multiple (Jan 31 year-end), beat its
third quarter revenue guidance by over 11%. That still wasn't enough for most investors;
the stock fell 6% over the two-day period after the earnings release.

Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is network security firm that also utilizes a subscription-
based revenue model. PANW boasts a $3.8bn market capitalization (10-Q, Oct 17th
prospectus) and a similarly rich valuation of 11x 2012E revenue (Jan 31st period end).
PANW's Q1 revenue results exceeded the consensus target, yet the stock still fell 5%.


A final example, though we've found more, is Bazaarvoice (NASDAQ:BV), a SaaS
business that provides an online analytics tool to examine online reviews, ratings, and
social commentary about a customer's brand. Before the earnings results, BV's share
price had already taken a beating as lock-up expirations, mounting earnings losses, and
overpriced acquisitions quickly led to a re-rating of BV's valuation multiples. But even after
a more than 50% price correction between October and late November, BV shares fell an

additional 5% after it reported in-line revenue results. After this 55%+ correction, BV now
trades at a more realistic revenue multiple of about 3.5x 2012E revenue (10-Q, Jul 17th
prospectus, CapIQ).

Momentum investors should take heed of these case studies and the unrealistically high
expectations embedded in NOW's current valuation. Combine this with a nearly
unprecedented near-term share lockup waterfall and even the most optimistic NOW bulls
could begin to have reservations.


An Avalanche of Share Lock-up Expirations could Nearly Triple the Public Float in
February


As if unrealistically high growth expectations aren't enough to warrant caution, NOW will
also experience headwinds from outsized lock-up expirations that begin just two days after
the January 30th earnings announcement. According to the schedule in the November
15th prospectus, 42.7m shares will be released just two days after the Q4 earnings
release (January 30th). This would more than double the public float. Just two weeks
thereafter, the lockup on another 47.5m shares expires. Even in the most bullish scenario
in which these shares are sold rationally over time, insider sales could create a long-term
headwind for the stock. In a more bearish scenario, any sign of panic can cause a
stampede for the exits as venture capital insiders rush to crystallize their already
astronomical gains, or as the market anticipates them to do so.

After the post-Christmas lockup expiration on December 26th, over 3.4m NOW shares
traded hands in a single day. Compare that figure to NOW's typical daily volume of 850k
and one can see how active lock-up days are for a stock. The selling pressure clearly had
an impact on the stock as NOW shares fell 5.4% on December 26th.


As we discussed in our previous reports, the venture capital firms Sequoia and JMI Equity
are the principal shareholders of the 90m shares set to free up in February. Instead of
selling shares directly and returning cash to the LPs, these VC firms could choose to
instead distribute their shares directly to the LPs. This was the tact taken by many of
Facebook's VC investors. However, a distribution could lead to rushed share sales as the
LPs unload the stock. This article from Fortune states the problem plainly, "Remember,
many LPs don't have in-house equity trading desks. That means that they are effectively
forced to liquidate shares immediately via a third-party broker." Such immediate selling
could have a much more negative impact on the stock than if JMI or Sequoia sold the
shares directly over an extended period.


The Market is Overlooking a Growing Collection of Customer Complaints


Beyond the financial headwinds and the potential mass exodus that may be triggered by
the lockup expirations, our diligence continues to confirm that ServiceNow's core Help
Desk product isn't as infallible as many long investors believe. The most bullish Wall
Street analysts would have investors believe that ServiceNow is head and shoulders
above the competition. But in reality, the NOW product has its difficulties just like the other
ITSM providers on the market.


We did not have to look far to find negative opinions of the NOW Help Desk software. If
one queries "ServiceNow review" on Google, the fourth result (after employee reviews and
a pair of generic spec sheets) leads to the website helpdeskreport.com. Based on the

"Unfortunately I have to agree with the people complaining about


performance. I know that my company is one of the so-called references of


Service-Now but let me say that the opinion expressed in that document is


not really shared by us who have to work with the system. It looks decent, it


is certainly better than the home grown system we used to have, it has all


required functionalities (though all a bit shallow and not always [too] well


thought of). BUT, performance is one big disaster! We often call it


Service-Impossible [emphasis added]."

Remedy [emphasis added]. They just aren't ready to handle organizations

"Service-Now was implemented in my company about a year ago. Everyone


on the field agrees it has been a complete disaster.


- Performance is generally poor and sometimes very poor. Users call it


Service-Later [emphasis added].


- This is probably the most user unfriendly system ever created.


- The database structure is so complex (read chaotic) that reporting is


extremely difficult to manage. After a year with Service-Now, most reports


still cannot be trusted.


I would summarize this review by saying that it feels like the people who


created Service-Now did so after reading an ITIL manual but never actually


worked in a Helpdesk environment. Otherwise, Service-Now would not be so


painfully awkward."

"For ServiceNow…the actual application itself is not particularly innovative…it's not

Rapidly emerging SaaS competitors could erode NOW's pricing power


"I don't believe [ServiceNow] will be able to maintain their price point over time just

for new capabilities and as new vendors come in and offer those … I think smaller


firms have the advantage (the Cherwells, the Hornbills of the world)…are more


nimble… And I don't think the whole 'go build it yourself' idea… makes sense."


The opinions of these industry experts converge on a few central themes, all of which
poke holes in NOW's seemingly impermeable valuation. Many customers prefer NOW
since it's a fully-customizable SaaS solution. But customization leads to more
cumbersome upfront implementation (both time and costs). Before the IPO, NOW would
shift this cost burden onto third-party partners, who helped absorb the workload. But now,
in order to fulfill Wall Street's sky-high growth expectations, NOW will increasingly bring
this work in-house. As NOW takes ownership of the implementation responsibilities, the
services should become more expensive for end-users, who have come to expect robust

coding assistance at a low price. These issues provide room for smaller, more nimble
SaaS competitors to encroach into NOW's customer accounts and intercept new contract
wins.


The Technology Hype Cycle Forebodes a Waning Interest in NOW


In our opinion, ServiceNow's Help Desk software is a perfect example of a product at the
peak of its hype cycle. Gartner, the well-regarded research firm, has an excellent chart
depicting a typical technology hype cycle. A typical technology launch can trigger
widespread publicity and investor excitement, leading to a 'peak of inflated expectations.'
Next, as forward-thinking industry participants realize that the technology isn't foolproof
nor are competitors wholly obtuse to change, the peak precipitously falls into a 'trough of
disillusionment.' Eventually, if the technology is proven out, it will plateau at a modest level
of productivity.


Gartner's Hype Cycle:


Source: Gartner.


By proving that demand for SaaS Help Desk software exists, NOW has inadvertently
encouraged BMC, HP, and CA to invest in SaaS products and incentivized capital inflows
to smaller ITSM peers. Cherwell Software, a well-regarded NOW competitor, received a
$25m growth equity investment from Insight Venture Partners in late November 2012. An
increasingly crowded marketplace will negate NOW's first-mover advantage and lead to a
lower visibility profile over time.


Google Trends provides anecdotal evidence that NOW's prominence in the marketplace
peaked with its heavily promoted IPO but has since diminished.
