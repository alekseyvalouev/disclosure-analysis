Aegerion Pharmaceuticals
(AEGR) Viability Threatened
As Regulatory, Legal And
Market Forces Close In
March 28, 2014 By GeoTeam


It’s not often that evidence gathered in one of our
investigations into a company that is not a classic pump
and dump or U.S. listed China Based company would lead
the GeoTeam to conclude that the subject company’s
shares could ultimately become essentially worthless. We
believe, however, that the risks facing Aegerion
Pharmaceuticals (AEGR) are of such gravity that we’re
considering that possibility. AEGR is a one-drug company
that sells JUXTAPID, a drug that can only be prescribed
under the strict and very limited guidelines imposed by the
FDA.


Company Background


Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug company, received
approval for and began selling JUXTAPID (aka, lomitapide)
in December 2012. JUXTAPID is an LDL-cholesterol-
reducing treatment for patients with Homozygous Familial
Hypercholesterolemia (“HoFH”). HoFH is an extremely rare
(widely believed prevalence of one-in-a-million population)
genetic lipid disorder usually caused by defects in the low-
density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptor genes, inherited from
both parents. Simply put, HoFH is a condition in which
normal mechanisms for clearing cholesterol from the body
don’t work, leading to fatty deposits under the skin and a
high risk of heart attacks. JUXTAPID is an effective drug in
the treatment of HoFH. However, patients taking the drug

face possible serious side effects that can lead to a buildup
of fat in the liver, a condition that may cause liver damage
and possibly death. Given the risks inherent in the use of
JUXTAPID, the FDA has approved the drug for adult
HoFH patients only.


AEGR Is Facing a Buzzsaw


JUXTAPID’s addressable market has been questioned in a
number of articles over the last few months . After
receiving approval, AEGR’s management changed their
tune and claims that the addressable market in the US is
4,500 patients and over 15,000 globally. Previously, during
the approval process, AEGR told the FDA the addressable
market for JUXTAPID was of one-in-a-million people or
approximately 300 patients in the US. In fact, the small
addressable market factored in the FDA’s decision.
Additionally, two recent European studies have found that
the addressable market is between 5 and 12.5 times less
than that claimed by AEGR. There is little question
management has tried to redefine the HoFH patient and
reach a far broader population than the JUXTAPID boxed
label allows. While previous articles on AEGR focus on
debating the merits of the market size we think the market
size debate is much more telling. We suspect that
management uses the higher population estimate that
inappropriate includes off-label prescriptions.


Regulators have taken note of AEGR’s actions and in
November 2013, the FDA issued a warning letter to AEGR
concerning public statements made by the Company’s CEO,
Marc Beer, claiming a broad array of off-label uses for the
drug. On the heels of the FDA’s action, the US Department
of Justice launched an investigation into AEGR’s marketing
practices and materials. What has not been thoroughly
discussed is that this was soon followed by anti-corruption
investigations by the Brazilian authorities into AEGR’s
selling practices.

We provide fresh evidence in this report that shows
AEGR’s management is not only promoting a far
greater addressable market than allowed but the
company is in fact marketing JUXTAPID off-label. We
do not think the market will ignore this reality now that the
FDA and DOJ have brought the issue center stage. Even if
AEGR escapes regulatory censure, shareholders will likely
find that AEGR’s avenues to a larger addressable market
will have been cut off by the EU requiring genetic testing
where possible, insurance companies taking a tough stance
on reimbursing non-HoFH patients and intense competition
from safer cheaper drugs. In fact, on the competitive front,
a BAML analysts’ survey found that 52% of physicians
expect PCSK9 inhibitors to be prescribed ahead of
JUXTAPID and the other current available treatment,
Kynamro, to address HoFH patients. The regulatory and
financial consequences of AEGR’s off-label product claims
and marketing practice could be devastating to the
company and its shareholders. Perhaps as a display of their
own concerns, in the past year, managers who are the
most informed about the business and its prospects sold
shares as their options were exercised, with some holding
no stock at all. In fact officers and directors as a whole
only own around 7% of the stock.


The Main Threats To AEGR’s Survival Are:


Management appears to have been reckless in its
promotion of JUXTAPID, at times disregarding patient
safety as per an FDA warning letter we have included
in this report. Additionally, note that Marc Beer
recently stated that they market to the 3,000
patients, which by definition would have to be mainly
to non-HoFH patients.
The FDA showed serious concerns over off-label use of
JUXTAPID during the approval process. With criticism
from the FDA detailed in its warning letter and

ongoing DOJ and Brazilian investigations any censure
could severely limit or even stop off-label sales.
EU label requires genetic testing wherever possible
which would stop all off-label prescriptions in Europe.
Insurance companies are refusing to reimburse the
annual cost ($235,000 to $295,000) of the drug for
non-HoFH patients and very few patients could afford
it themselves or even cover co-insurance.
Physicians will likely prescribe lomitapide to fewer off-
label patients due to regulatory scrutiny and potential
malpractice suits.
Significantly cheaper competitive drugs with less
severe side-effects are expected to be on market in
2016. We believe the new drugs will usurp AEGR’s
entire off-label (non-HoFH) market and take at least
part of its on-label market.
Genzyme, with much greater resources than AEGR,
continues to invest in expanding Kynamro, a drug that
currently competes directly with JUXTAPID.
Additionally, Isis, Kynamor’s developer, has managed
to reduce the painful injection site reactions which
were keeping some patients away.
AEGR’s on-label market is suffering from higher
dropout rates for patients that begin and later stop
therapy and newly disclosed non-starters being
patients prescribed the drug but do not begin therapy.
The US patent on JUXTAPID ends in 2015, although
AEGR has applied for an additional five year extension
but this remains a risk.


Brief Overview:


We will discuss what we see as a cavalier attitude analysts
and AEGR’s management have regarding the restrictions
placed on the drug’s usage as both admit that JUXTAPID is
being prescribed off-label. In fact, AEGR acknowledges that
this dangerous drug, intended for a very small fraction

adult population, is being prescribed off-label to
adolescents.


Apparently, analysts are failing to consider very probable
scenarios where AEGR will not be able to sell off-label,
whether due to the DOJ’s investigation, EU restrictions,
insurance reimbursement constraints or safer and cheaper
competition. But herein lies the problem; AEGR readily
admits needs to market JUXTAPID to a broader population
than currently permitted by the FDA to achieve and
maintain profitability. Once analysts are forced to face the
facts, probably due to FDA and/or DOJ actions, AEGR’s
business prospects and therefore price targets for its
shares will have to be sharply reduced. Sure, we get it.
Marketing drugs off-label is a common practice, but this is
a very different scenario. While a larger pharmaceutical
company may survive past regulatory fines and sanctions,
AEGR is a one-drug company so it’s do or die.


Furthermore, we will show that the FDA from the beginning
made it clear during JUXTAPID’s approval process that they
were very concerned that the drug would be prescribed off-
label. We will also show revealing excerpts from the FDA
letter which include several statements regarding how
marketing material “misleadingly suggest that JUXTAPID
lacks significant risks” and that the drug is being marketed
“for new uses for which it lacks approval.”


We are forced to ask ourselves; is management choosing
to accept the risks of fines and sanctions for the sake of
reaching as broad a population as possible before their
business becomes terminal?


Valuation: Lose-Lose Proposition


Based on the current stock price, the market is estimating
that AEGR would treat 1,800 patients per annum
worldwide . We believe that by 2016, AEGR will, at a2

maximum, treat 500 patients worldwide per annum, a 72%
revenue downside from current estimates. In a worst case
scenario regulatory sanctions could imperil the drug and,
therefore AEGR, ultimately in our opinion making
insolvency a very likely scenario.


If Management Won’t Hold AEGR Shares, Why Should
We?


AEGR’s managers, at least based on their share transaction
histories, also seem to have concerns about the company’s
future. Shortly after its IPO debut on October 25, 2010,
management owned around 52% of the stock. It’s now
over a year since AEGR received approved from the FDA to
market JUXTAPID. One would think that with sales of the
drug about to “take off “management would be adding to
their positions. Instead, they now only own around 7% of
the company. In a telling move, the company’s managers
have been selling shares as soon as their options are
exercised. In the past year managers who are the most
informed about the business and its prospects sold shares,
generating gross proceeds in excess of $16 million
including $8.6 million to CEO, Marc Beer.


Consider the following managers that recently exercised
options and immediately sold their shares:


Marc Beer, CEO. A display of leadership. Enough
said.


Mark Sumeray, Chief Science Officer, is in the unique
position of truly understanding the HoFH market from
the medical perspective. He should know better than
anyone else in AEGR whether the HoFH market is as
large as they represent to investors, yet he sells all of
his shares as stock options vest. If he truly believed
AEGR’s story regarding the expanded HoFH market
then wouldn’t he be holding his shares?

Craig Fraser, President of US and International
Supply, heads and monitors the launch of the
JUXTAPID in the US and international markets. Again,
he knows more than any other person about the
patients being added to the drug program and yet he
also sells all of the stock he has been issued. It does
not appear as though he puts much stake in the AEGR
story either.


The following chart summarizes stock options exercised
and shares sold and shares currently owned by officers and
directors during the period January 2013 – March 2014:


Supporting Evidence


AEGR’S Depends On Off-Label Prescriptions To Be
Profitable


While the prevalence of HoFH can be debatable, there is no
question it is extremely low. The population of HoFH
patients and addressable market really do matter for AEGR
and its investors. The company discloses in its 2013 10-K
that if they can only sell to qualified HoFH patients then
they will find it difficult to achieve or maintain profitability.
It is therefore not a surprise that AEGR has been
promoting its own internal estimates of addressable HoFH
market size to investors. The following chart graphically
displays the estimated number of HoFH patients AEGR
presented to the FDA and other estimates presented to
investors:


HoFH is traditionally believed to affect one person in a
million, as AEGR presented to the FDA during the approval

process. Two recent European studies have been published
that indicate that the HoFH market is potentially slightly
larger than previously thought but even those results do
not yield data that support AEGR’s market size estimates,
with the highest being about 17.6% of AEGR’s estimate.


AGER also believes as per presentation


A German study sponsored by AEGR found that there
were 95 HoFH cases in Germany. That implies HoFH affects
one person in every 860,000 people  and therefore
supports the consensus view of approximately one person
in every million. If we apply the German ratio to the US
market the number of addressable cases in the US would
increase from 313 to 360 cases. It’s important to
remember that the German estimate does not distinguish
between adult and pediatric populations so the portion of
the population AEGR can actually address would be less. In
any event, the true addressable population is far less than
AEGR’s estimated US adult and pediatric estimation of over
4,500 HoFH patients.


A second study being promoted by AEGR was published in
the European Heart Journal (“EHJ study”) in December
2013 . Unlike the German study, this article did not
survey the actual number of HoFH patients but instead
applied the assumption that since Familial
Hypercholesterolemia (“FH”) patients are under-diagnosed
then it is likely that HoFH patients are as well. Traditionally,
FH was expected to affect one person in every 500.
However, the study indicates that it could potentially affect
one person in every 200, a 2.5x increase. Applying these
findings to HoFH would mean the HoFH could affect one in
every 400,000. That ratio, when applied to the US
population, would indicate the maximum potential HoFH

population to be only approximately 790 people. Note that
this study included the total population regardless of age.


None of three views (FDA, German, and EHJ) are anywhere
near the 4,500 addressable patients in the US, including
pediatrics, that AEGR promotes to investors. The EHJ study
which estimated the highest prevalence of HoFH is still just
17.6% of AEGR’s estimate. No matter how you massage
the data to get the most favorable results, it is simply not
possible to come up with a credible estimate of individuals
with HoFH that matches AEGR’s assumptions.


AEGR openly admits that if the market is smaller than they
have led investors to believe then they will struggle to be
profitable:


“If the total addressable market in the U.S. and
the EU and other key markets are smaller than
we expect, then it may be more difficult for us to
generate revenues and to achieve or maintain
profitability .


The lack of approval to market JUXTAPID for the
pediatric HoFH population will limit our product
revenue potential, and may make it more difficult
for us to achieve or maintain profitability. “


AEGR Promotes JUXTAPID Story With Estimates Of A
Far Greater Population Of Hofh Patients Than The
Data Supports


Some investors might think AEGR is a bargain at current
prices. After all, the stock traded at around $100 last
November and is now around half that price (52 week
range: $36.63 – $101). Shares have fallen recently amid
several articles that questioned AEGR’s estimates of the
size of the addressable market for JUXTAPID, its only drug.

https://geoinvesting.com/aegerion-pharmaceuticals-aegr-viability-threatened-as-regulatory-legal-and-market-forces-close-in/ 10/44


The conventional wisdom and the estimate used by AEGR
management during the drug’s FDA approval process is
that the prevalence of HoFH is one person in a million
(approximately 300 US adult patients). Yet, post FDA
approval management has been promoting its own
internal estimate of the number of US adults with
HoFH to investors that is 10X this size. The greater
market size estimate is based on a much broader
application of the drug than approved by the FDA.
Astonishingly, even during a recent investor presentation,
AEGR management defined the addressable market using
criteria that was far broader than approved by the FDA.


AEGR’s management has been incorrectly claiming that
there are at least 3,000 HoFH patients in the US over the
age of 187,  based on a report from LEK Consulting
(“LEK”). More recently, they have commented that there is
an additional 1,000 to 1,500 HoFH pediatric patients . Note
that in 2011 management was estimating a much higher
pediatric HoFH population of 2,100 to 3,000 (between 75%
and 100% of the adult HoFH population size) .


LEK is a management consulting firm headquartered in
Boston . As per AEGR’s registration documents, LEK
estimates that there are 3,000 cases in the USA which is in
sharp contrast to the one in a million ratio AEGR presented
to the FDA in order to facilitate approval of JUXTAPID. The
following is from the IPO prospectus:


“In a report that we commissioned, L.E.K.
Consulting LLC, or LEK, an international business
consulting firm, estimates that, subject to,
among other things, product pricing and access,
there is a total addressable HoFH population in
each of the United States and, collectively,
Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and
Spain, which are referred to in this prospectus as
the European Union Five, of approximately 3,000

patients, or a combined total of approximately
6,000 patients .”


They changed their tune in the 2011 10-K, where the risk
factors now say that LEK’s 3,000 patient estimate includes
non-HoFH patients which are not approved patients for the
drug by the FDA:


“This consultant’s estimates, however,
included a segment of severe HeFH patients
whose levels of LDL-C are not controlled by
current therapies. These patients may be
phenotypically indistinct from HoFH patients.
JUXTAPID is indicated solely for HoFH. Our
prescribing information in the U.S. specifies
that the safety and effectiveness of
JUXTAPID have not been established in
patients with hypercholesterolemia who do
not have HoFH. We are not permitted to
promote JUXTAPID for any indication other
than HoFH. In addition, as part of the
prescriber authorization form under our
REMS program in the U.S., the prescriber
must affirm that the patient has a clinical or
laboratory diagnosis consistent with
HoFH.”


At the 5th Annual Canaccord Genuity Cardiovascular,
Diabetes & Obesity Conference and Corporate Presentation
in March 2011 ,15 AEGR finally presented the criteria that
LEK used in estimating the population size.


Notice this includes “Maximally treated LDL-C >300mg/dL”.
The exact same criterion was rejected by the FDA as it
would include severe HeFH patients. This totally shifts the

risk/benefit ratio and would require additional clinical
studies  so the FDA is perfectly clear that these patients
are not approved for JUXTAPID:


AEGR appears to disguise the rejection in the notes to the
financial statements. Instead they put the best possible
spin on the situation by stating that the FDA ‘may‘ require
a narrow diagnosis of HoFH and some of the patients with
the company’s definition of HoFH ‘may ultimately‘ not be
part of the HoFH population. We surmise that AEGR is
trying to spin the FDA’s position as somewhat flexible or
subject to interpretation.


“Finally, any final labeling may be approved with
limitations. For example, the FDA has stated that
a phenotypic HoFH definition of patients with
average fasting LDL-C greater than 300 mg/dL
on maximally tolerated lipid lowering therapy
closely resembles the severe refractory
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or
HeFH, population. The FDA or other regulatory
authorities may require a narrow diagnosis
criteria for HoFH which may reduce the
addressable population. As a result, some of the
patients who meet the phenotypic definition of
HoFH may ultimately be considered to be outside
the HoFH population, reducing the estimated
addressable patients, and it may be more difficult
for us to achieve or maintain profitability.” 


Contrary to what management tells investors, AEGR openly
presents to the FDA that HoFH is indeed a one in a million
disease, a far cry from the 3,000 adult HoFH patients in
the USA that they have been continuously promoting to its
investors. We understand why management would not

want to emphasize that AEGR is a one drug company
addressing a one in a million market. Below is a slide from
AEGR’s presentation to the FDA during the approval
hearings . The material in this presentation is in contrast
to the prospectus.


AEGR presented the correct definition of HoFH in their
presentation to the FDA during the approval process.
There does not appear to be any disagreement as to what
HoFH is here:


FDA Rejected AEGR’s Attempts To Broaden
Authorized Uses For JUXTAPID


AEGR did ask the FDA to expand the criteria to include
fasting LDL > 300mg/dL but the FDA refused since that
this would shift the risk: benefit ratio and would require
further trials. Even Dr Daniel Rader, the inventor of the
drug, recognized that the criteria should be kept the same
as the trial.


AEGR has not initiated the clinical trials that are required to
broaden the patient population that the drug can be
marketed to. They, like us, may conclude the trials would
be a waste of time and money given that there are a
number of additionally competitors expected to enter the
market in 2016 with drugs that address both the HeFH and
HoFH markets. For example, Amgen (AMGN) will be release
Evolocumab, which has not exhibited any safety risks  to

date and is significantly cheaper than JUXTAPID, costing
just $10-15k per annum  compared to JUXTAPID’s price of
$295k per annum. These drugs are expected to compete
with JUXTAPID in at least a third of its addressable HoFH
market.


Regulatory Risks Associated With Off-Label
Marketing


JUXTAPID can only be prescribed under the strict and very
limited guidelines imposed by the FDA. There is strong
evidence that suggests AEGR is marketing the drug to
patients outside the scope of its approval.


Management certainly has strong motivation to market its
only drug off-label. Indeed the very survival of AEGR
probably depends on management’s ability either get
approval to address a broader market or they have to sell
off-label, opening the company to fines, sanctions and
even withdrawal of the drug from the market.


Investors should note that the FDA has already rejected
AEGR’s attempts to broaden the authorized uses for
JUXTAPID. The FDA issued a warning letter concerning
management’s public statements concerning lomitapide
and the US Department of Justice launched an
investigation into AEGR’s marketing materials and
practices. What investors might not know, however, is that
more recently Brazilian government authorities began their
own investigation of AEGR’s sales practices to determine
whether its employees violated anti-corruption laws.


Perhaps most disturbing of all is that AEGR’s CEO Marc
Beer recently stated that they are marketing to 3,000
HoFH patients…

“We see the patients in this market — there’s
3,000 patients that we believe are out there
that we’re marketing to — this HoFH patient
— very severe patient — and the response from
the physicians to therapy has been positive”.


… which, based on the findings we have already presented,
include off-label patients, an action that the DOJ and
Brazilian government authorities are looking into.


As mentioned, marketing drugs off-label may to some
extent be common practice, but this is a very different
scenario. As we discuss in more detail later in this report,
the FDA made it clear during the approval process that
they were very concerned that the drug would be
prescribed off-label.


The FDA Takes Action Against Loose Talking CEO


The FDA imposed very specific label restrictions on the use
of JUXTAPID for good reasons and is well aware of the
likelihood that AEGR would be motivated to market
lomitapide off-label. Accordingly, the agency monitors
selling and promotional activities to ensure compliance.
Despite the scrutiny AEGR’s marketing of the drug is under,
statements by Marc Beer indicate a cavalier attitude that is
likely reflected in the company’s broader sales and
marketing activities. The FDA noted this behavior and
acted. In November 2013, it issued a warning letter
demanding the company’s management stop making
inappropriate claims regarding potential off-label uses for
the drug. Investors enthused by management’s
claims should be mindful that at the end of the day,
it’s the FDA, not AEGR that decides how the drug can
be used and therefore its addressable market. The
following excerpt from the FDA’s warning letter best
describes AEGR’s out of bounds promotion of lomitapide:

DOJ And Brazilian Government Authorities Launch
Investigations Of Selling And Marketing Practices
While Law Firms Line Up With Class Action Lawsuits


On the heels of the FDA’s warning, AEGR now faces a US
Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigation into its
marketing materials and practices. The DOJ investigation
will burden the company with extensive legal, time and
other costs as they comply with requests for information.
Adding to the company’s woes is that it was disclosed in its
Form 10-K filing that Brazilian authorities are investigating
whether AEGR’s employees have violated anti-corruption
laws selling lomitapide. Add to that a growing list of class
action lawsuits against the company and its officers. All
this indicates that AEGR’s promotional and
marketing issues appear to be systematic, not just
one-off slipups by a couple of its managers. Frankly, we are
amazed that the stock is still trading at an over $1.5 billion
market valuation despite what are far more than just
boilerplate risk factors facing the company.


Investors who believe that debating the size of the
potential HoFH market is nitpicking and that the only real
risk AEGR faces from the FDA and DOJ is just a fine and
slap-on-the-wrist should consider what management’s
claims really imply. They are allowing the use of a very
dangerous drug off-label. That drug can possibly
cause permanent liver damage and even death.


Comments by FDA panel members concerning the issue of
off-label marketing during the drug approval process, some
included in this report (seven paragraphs), were very
specific and, by the management’s public statements and
marketing practices, seem clearly justified. Following is one
of the quotes we found from an FDA voting committee
member:

Source: Food And Drug Administration Center For Drug
Evaluation And Research Endocrinologic And Metabolic
Drugs Advisory Committee, Wednesday, October 17, 2012


Any one or all of the FDA, DOJ and Brazilian actions could
result in material fines and sanctions, increased vigilance
to stop off-label sales or even forced withdrawal of the
drug from the market. One likely impact of all of this is
that previously misinformed doctors now aware of
the controversies and legal implications will be less
likely to prescribe JUXTAPID knowing that many
alternative drugs are right around the corner.
Additionally, the few insurance companies that did not
already reject off-label prescriptions are likely to now
tighten up reimbursement controls.


Readers should be aware that the issues facing AEGR are
not just due to overly enthusiastic statements about the
market potential for lomitapide. There is growing evidence
that the company, in an effort to reach a broader than
allowed market, has been tacitly allowing and even
encouraging the prescription of JUXTAPID off-label.
Management has publicly admitted as much. During the Q
IV 2013 conference call with investors Marc Beer
acknowledged the drug that can cause liver damage and
even death has been prescribed off-label to pediatric
patients, including children!


“Now, a physician can sign the attestation that
we do not have any clinical development on
pediatric, but they have to sign that and tell us
that they’re well aware and they’re educated that
we do not have clinical development on pediatric
patients. Because of acting that way as an
organization from a marketing and medical
affairs standpoint, obviously, we have very few

pediatric patients. So the vast majority of
our patients are adult.“


In other words, management is aware that the drug is
being prescribed off-label and they allow it to happen
despite the zero tolerance for exceptions the FDA imposed
when approving the drug intended only for HoFH adults. It
only takes one incidence of serious harm to a patient or
death to cause irreparable harm to the JUXTAPID brand
and AEGR’s reputation.


Analysts’ reports also indicate that AEGR has been notified
that doctors are prescribing the drug outside of the
FDA criteria. Recent BAML and Jeffries surveys have
found that physicians are prescribing the drug to patients
diagnosed under wider criteria, maximally treated LDL-
C>300mg/dL that the FDA rejected .


In our opinion, even if AEGR escapes with a fine and minor
sanctions, the company’s hopes to hold onto market share
seem slim. There are a number of competitive drugs in the
pipeline, some in late stages that could hit the market as
early as 2015, that have broader addressable markets and
lower risk profiles and costs than lomitapide. Potential
competitors include behemoth companies like Amgen,
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) and Pfizer (PFE).
Those companies have been targeting the PCSK9 gene that
controls the number of LDL receptors on cells responsible
for removing LDL from the bloodstream.


FDA Very Concerned About Off-Label Use Because Of
Dangerous Side-Effects


The FDA was well aware of the risk that AEGR would seek
to market JUXTAPID to a wider population of patients than
those diagnosed with HoFH. After all, there is certainly
strong economic incentive to sell more prescriptions of a

Given the concerns expressed by the committee, it is
abundantly clear that the FDA does not want JUXTAPID
prescribed outside HoFH adult population that they know is
extremely small and generally estimated to be around 300
to 400 individuals in the US. The risk of liver damage is
just too great.


The Usage Label And REMS Program Designed To
Restrict Access To The Drug


Based on the FDA’s comments above, strict guidelines have
been imposed on the use of JUXTAPID because of the risk
of hepatic toxicity (i.e. liver damage). Accordingly, the FDA
mandated that the drug can only be prescribed by doctors
that have signed up to the Approved Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program in order to avoid off-
label prescriptions. The REMS programs were created for
circumstances where the FDA has serious patient safety
concerns for an approved drug and wish to manage these
risks to patients . Due to the severity of HoFH and the
current lack of alternative drugs to address it, the FDA
decided that, for this extremely small group, the choice of
liver damage versus a heart attack meant the drug should
be approved. That approval, however, was very guarded
and use of the drug is highly restricted. Following are the
indications and usage label  for JUXTAPID.


As a further safeguard, the REMS Program is intended to
restrict access to the drug.

EU Approval Severely Limits Off-Label Use


The EU approval requires genetic testing wherever
possible so they are unlikely to access many more patients
than those from the one person in one million estimate.
This requirement will no doubt reduce AEGR’s international
revenue and profit projections.  See below:


Prior to receiving this approval requiring the genetic testing
wherever possible, AEGR had highlighted the possible risk
of this EU requirement posed on its abilities to achieve or
maintain profitability.


Additionally, the EU did not grant AEGR’s drug orphan
status and this could make it much more difficult for AEGR
to gain reimbursement approvals.


“As noted above, LOJUXTA was not granted
orphan drug status by the EMA and it may not be
eligible for such automatic exemptions or
waivers. Therefore, we may not be able to
provide all of the data required to obtain
pricing/reimbursement approvals in certain
EU Member States, which could result in
delays of pricing/reimbursement approvals
for LOJUXTA, LOJUXTA not obtaining
pricing/reimbursement approval at all, or
LOJUXTA obtaining approvals at less than
acceptable levels or with significant
restrictions on use or reimbursement“.


This is also coupled with spending constraints in EU
counties which would make the cheaper apheresis the

more desired treatment:


“The widespread use and availability of apheresis
as a treatment for HoFH in the EU, combined
with the lower cost of apheresis as compared to
LOJUXTA, may make it more difficult for us to
obtain commercially acceptable pricing and
reimbursement approvals for lomitapide in the
key markets of the EU and, even where
commercially acceptable approvals are obtained,
may limit the use of LOJUXTA as a treatment for
HoFH patients. “


AEGR has claimed that there are 3,000 potential patients in
the EU. We believe the genetic test requirement where
possible will stop off-label prescriptions, limiting the on-
label market to the low hundreds. Additionally, due to
monetary tightening, we expect that EU countries will seek
the cheapest form of treatment and once the cheaper
competitors are approved, AEGR’s EU market could be de
minimis.


Prescribing Physicians Required To Use Legally

Good medical practice and the best interests
of the patient require that physicians use
legally available drugs, biologics and devices
according to their best knowledge and judgment.
If physicians use a product for an indication not
in the approved labeling, they have the
responsibility to be well informed about the
product, to base its use on firm scientific
rationale and on sound medical evidence, and to
maintain records of the product’s use and
effects.”


Doctors Face Malpractice Liability As JUXTAPID Is
Being Prescribed Off-Label – Including To Children


Analyst reports indicate AEGR has been notified that
doctors are prescribing the drug outside of the FDA criteria.
At the Canaccord conference management said they had
463 prescriptions outstanding with the majority in the US.
If that’s true, alarm bells should be going off that doctors
are prescribing off-label since the number of prescriptions
exceeds the entire addressable market in the US. Simply
put, to reach 463 patients AEGR would have had to reach
every known HoFH patient in the US and then some. And,
that wouldn’t account for the fact that competing product,
Kynamro, would have surely been prescribed to some
patients.


“And at the time of our second-earnings second
quarter earnings call, we demonstrated that we
are off to a good, strong launch; and in fact, the
global prescriptions year to date at that point in
time are 463 scripts globally, the majority of
these in the United States. And while that’s also
very encouraging and a great start to the script
production, I will also note that it’s important to
not assume that every one of these prescriptions

is going to ultimately result in a patient on
therapy .”


BAML and Jeffries surveys have found that physicians are
prescribing the drug to patients diagnosed under wider
criteria, maximally treated LDL-C>300mg/dL that the FDA
rejected , :


Of particular note is that AEGR is finding it harder to get
patients from lipidologists, the specialists in the field being
targeted, than from cardiologists who appear to be less
cautious in prescribing the drug. This supports our view
that the drug is being overprescribed as doctors writing
these prescriptions either don’t understand or do not know
the limitations placed on the drug’s use by the FDA. It is
likely that AEGR marketing programs and tactics are strong
contributing factors to JUXTAPID’s being over-prescribed.


Question – Robyn Karnauskas: And as a follow-up, are
lipidologists not wanting to use the drug? And when you go
to Europe when you are developing trackers in Europe, are
you focused the tracker more on the cardiologists versus
lipidologists?


Answer – Marc Beer: So I would not say that lipidologists
are not willing to put them on the drug. We get a lot of
patients that come in from the lipidologists. I will say that
they have fewer patients in their practice. They tend to
study the patient longer and it takes them longer to put
somebody on therapy because I think that they are trying
a lot of different products at the same time.

The cardiologists not that case. The cardiologists tell us
that we are seeing 35 patients today, we are very
busy, we’ve got to get the patient out of harm’s way
quickly. We can’t make every patient a study and
they tend to put the patient on therapy quicker than
a lipidologist. But both are treating effectively and we are
getting good support. When I look at it city by city, we look
very carefully at the KOLs. We’ve got good support KOL by
KOL.


CEO Marc Beer’s additionally confesses he knows JUXTAPID
is going to non-HoFH patients:


“It also looked a little bit broader, and it showed
that if physicians do try to take this into the
severe HE population, that there’s somewhere
between 4,000 and 5,000 patients that could fall
into that category in their mind; now, again, yet
to be determined how they’re going to – what
percentage of that patient population they’re
going to use it in, but there’s a severe HE
population out there that some physicians
are going to try to use this product in, and
we’ll try to support their efforts of getting it
reimbursed, but not marketing to it. “


It gets even worse, Marc Beer states that the drug is being
prescribed to children as per the Q IV 2013 conference call
transcript below:


With increased regulatory scrutiny and the fear of potential
malpractice suits, doctors are likely to prescribe less
JUXTAPID to non-HoFH patients, especially children who
could be severely affected by the liver toxicity. It makes us

wonder what AEGR is telling the cardiologists, who lack the
same expertise as the lipidologists in this matter.


Not Your Garden Variety Risk Factors


AEGR’s recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2013, includes disclosures and risk factors
that should alarm investors. The disclosures regarding
challenges from the FDA, DOJ and Brazilian authorities are
not just boiler plate risk factors used as a means to cover
management should the worst case risks become reality.
In AEGR’s case there really are wolves at the door
that could ultimately torpedo JUXTAPID and even
bring the company down.


FDA Has Teeth And Its Actions Could Imperil AEGR


In late 2013, AEGR received a warning letter from the FDA
alleging that certain statements about JUXTAPID made by
the company’s CEO during two broadcast interviews on the
CNBC television show, Fast Money, promoted a claim that
JUXTAPID has an effect on cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality and that JUXTAPID is effective as a monotherapy.
These would be considered as unapproved uses.


The FDA’s warning letter should not be taken lightly.


“Failure to comply with the applicable U.S.
requirements at any time during the product
development process, approval process or after
approval, may subject a company to
administrative or judicial sanctions. These
sanctions could include, among other
things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending
applications, withdrawal of an approval,
imposition of a clinical hold, warning letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or

partial suspension of production or
distribution, injunctions, civil money
penalties, fines, refusals of government
contracts, debarment, restitution,
disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
Any agency or judicial enforcement action could
have a material adverse effect on us.”


DOJ’s Investigation Of AEGR’s Marketing Practices
Damage AEGR’s Image And JUXTAPID Brand


In late 2013 AEGR received a subpoena from the U.S.
Department of Justice, represented by the U.S. Attorney’s
Office in Boston, Massachusetts, requesting documents and
other information pertaining to the promotion, marketing,
and sale of JUXTAPID in connection with a government
investigation of the company’s practices.


“While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves,
we may not be able to resolve this matter
without incurring significant fines,
sanctions, or other consequences that could
have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, or results of
operations. Even if we can resolve this matter
without incurring significant penalties, responding
to the subpoena has been, and is expected to
continue to be, costly and time-consuming.
Moreover, this investigation could adversely
impact our reputation and the willingness of
physicians to prescribe lomitapide for their
HoFH patients, and may divert management’s
attention and resources, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.”

Government Authorities In Brazil Investigate
Whether AEGR Employees Violate Anti-Corruption
Laws With Prescriptions Of Lomitapide


Questions about AEGR’s business practices are not
restricted to the US. Apparently, the same business
practices that have the company in hot water and under
scrutiny of the FDA and DOJ also apply internationally.


“Our activities outside the U.S. or those of our
employees, licensees, distributors,
manufacturers, CROs, or other third parties who
act on our behalf or with whom we do business
could subject us to investigation or prosecution
under such foreign or U.S. laws. We are aware,
for example, that governmental authorities in
São Paulo, Brazil are conducting an
investigation to determine whether two of
our employees have violated anti-corruption
laws in connection with prescriptions of
lomitapide written in Brazil. …… If our
activities in Brazil or in any other country outside
the U.S. are found as part of this or any other
investigation to be in violation of any laws or any
other governmental regulations that may apply
to us, we may be subject to significant civil,
criminal and administrative penalties, damages,
and fines. In addition with respect to the
investigation in Brazil, we may experience a
reluctance of physicians to prescribe
JUXTAPID, or a delay or suspension in the
government’s ordering process, while the
investigation is ongoing, or if our activities are
found to have violated applicable laws. These
and other risks of international business
relationships may materially adversely
affect our ability to attain or sustain
profitable operations.”

The trifecta of the FDA warning and the DOJ and Brazilian
investigations of AEGR’s business practices could be
damaging to the JUXTAPID brand. Investors should be
mindful that these issues surfaced in late 2013 and
early 2014 so they did not materially affect Q IV
2013 operating results. Q I 2014 and beyond are an
entirely different matter.


Insurance Companies Are Not Going To Play Ball


Even if AEGR gets past the FDA, we don’t expect insurers
to easily pay up to $295,000 a year. In the past, insurance
companies have successfully defended suits against them
over not reimbursing off-label patients. We have identified
36 insurance policies that give some disclosure regarding
coverage of JUXTAPID. Here is a quote from the 2013 10-K
that highlights this boilerplate risk that is becoming a
reality:


“Our ability to meet expectations with respect to
sales of lomitapide and revenues from such
sales, and to attain profitability and positive cash
flow from operations, in the time periods we
anticipate, or at all, will depend on a number of
factors, including the following:


the willingness of insurance companies, managed
care organizations, other private payers, and
government entities that provide reimbursement
for medical costs in the U.S., the EU, Mexico and
Canada and in other countries in which we may
have or may receive approval to market
lomitapide, to provide reimbursement for
lomitapide at the prices at which we offer
lomitapide without requiring genotyping or
imposing any additional major hurdles to
access;”

As set out below, 11 of the 36 insurance reimbursement
documents we found did not have any details regarding
their criteria for authorization for the drug. Based on the
results we found from the remaining insurance documents,
only one was a positive for AEGR selling to both on and off-
label markets. The remaining 96% of the plans
demonstrate just how precarious AEGR’s position really is
and how difficult it will be for them to monetize not just the
off-label market but also its on-label market. Investors
should also be aware, that once the PCSK9 drugs are
released in 2016 the insurance companies may take an
even harder stand against AEGR’s JUXTAPID.


Of the 25 insurance remaining plans, we found the
following:


Four plans, 16%, did not cover JUXTAPID
Five plans, 20%, will only allow JUXTAPID if the
patient has tried and is intolerant to Kynamro, its
main competitor.
Nine, 36%, of the insurance companies require strict
compliance with the FDA’s HoFH definition and as such
would not reimburse doctors prescribing off-label.
Five plans, 20%, JUXTAPID was listed as a non-
preferred brand which means that since there is likely
to be an alternative preferred brand a copayment is
required. Given the cost of JUXTAPID we would be
surprised if patients could afford the drug under these
plans.
One plan, 4%, covered JUXTAPID but required
coinsurance since it is a non-preferred brands.
One plan, 4%, preferred JUXTAPID over Kynamro.


Additionally, with all nine of the plans that disclosed pre-
authorization criteria requiring the strict adherence to FDA
criteria, we believe that is likely that many of the plans
that did not disclose the criteria for reimbursement would
also require on-label use of the drug. Therefore, even if the

FDA and DOJ were not there to strictly enforce the FDA
criteria, the insurance companies will be the de facto
enforcers by simply not paying. The following chart details
our findings:


Our belief that insurance companies will not reimburse for
the use of JUXTAPID carte blanche is supported by the
BAML survey  which found that 18% of patients who
had been prescribed the drug had to drop out due to
a lack of insurance coverage.


As much as AEGR would like to get around the FDA’s highly
restrictive criteria, the insurance companies will not. At
nearly $300,000 per year as a lifetime commitment there
is simply too much money at stake. AEGR may be able to
help some patients get reimbursements for drugs
prescribed off-label but it is unlikely that they can achieve
this for all of them.


Competition Will Potentially Usurp The Entire Off-
Label Market And Part Of The On-Label Market


Competition is intensifying with larger and better financed
competitors that have either developed or are developing
drugs are likely to erode AEGR’s on-label and potential off-
label market. These drugs are cheaper and some are
significantly safer, based on current trials, with the PCSK9
inhibitors being the most attractive on both counts.


AEGR has found itself in a very unusual position for a
manufacturer of an orphan drug because there is another
drug Kynamro, produced by Sanofi Genzyme, that also has
orphan status and is targeting the same HoFH population.

Both drugs are specifically designed for a population that is
estimated to be just 300 cases in the US. There are
advantages and disadvantages to both drugs although,
possibly due to price ($176k vs. $295k) , we have found
that a number of insurance companies will only reimburse
the use of JUXTAPID if the patient can’t tolerate Kynamro
(RegenceRx, GHP Family, Boston Medical Centre and
KyHealth).


Analysts have argued that patients would prefer JUXTAPID
over Kynamro because they would rather not have an
injection which has caused painful reactions at the place
injected. Kynamro’s developers have recently announced
that they have identified why reactions were caused and
have remedied the problem, which could lead to patients
returning to use Kynamro . Additionally, analysts have not
considered that the difficult and laborious aphaeresis
process, still recommended to be used where possible with
JUXTAPID, is not recommended with Kynamro . Further,
these drugs are a lifelong commitment and JUXTAPID
requires sustenance of a more difficult diet regimen, with
less than 20% of energy coming from fat . JUXTAPID
patients have also suffered from serious stomach issues
which may make a lifelong commitment to the drug more
difficult to sustain and less assured. Kynamro is also
expected to gain market share as Genzyme continues to
invest substantially in the Kynamro opportunity , with
resources that AEGR do not have at their disposal.


With continued investment, insurance preference and
improved patient experience, we expect that Kynamro will
take a significantly larger market share than analysts
assume, challenging AEGR’s ability to hold market share.


More worrying is development of PCSK9 inhibitors by a
number of large pharmaceutical companies including
Amgen, a partnership between Regeneron and Sanofi,
Roche Holding AG, Pfizer and Alnylam in collaboration with

The Medicines Company (MDCO). These drugs are targeted
at treating hyperlipidemia, of which FH is one type. It is
expected that these drugs will be most effective for HeFH
patients but are also having a positive effect on some HoFH
patients. Once these drugs enter the market, expected to
be around 2016, they will threaten both AEGR’s on and off-
label markets since the drugs are substantially more
affordable and, based on trials to date, significantly safer.


Amgen, for example, is developing a PCSK9 inhibitor, AMG-
145/Evolocumab, which is expected to be released in
2016 . The drug was not expected to be effective in
treating HoFH patients. However, Amgen has recently
announced positive results in a Phase 3 trial on patients
with HoFH . Based on earlier results the drug has been
just as effective on some HoFH patients (three out of the
eight patients trialed) .


With an annual cost of AMG-145 being $10-15k  and no
severe side-effects (FDA had raised a general concern of
neurocognitive issues with other lipid-lowering therapies
but Amgen has not seen any signs for this in its trials so
far ), we expect that this will be the drug of choice for
patients and insurance companies wherever possible and is
likely to have a dramatic impact in reducing AEGR’s off-
label market and take some market share of the its on-
label market. The BAML analysts’ survey found that 52% of
physicians expect PCSK9 inhibitors to be prescribed ahead
of JUXTAPID and Kynamro – and that is just in the HoFH
space . Based on price and safety, it is likely to be the
drug of choice wherever it is just as effective as JUXTAPID
or Kynamro.


AEGR has already found that HoFH patients have already
been signed up for trials for these anti-PCSK9 drugs that
could gain approval by 2015.

“Some HoFH patients who might otherwise be
candidates for treatment with lomitapide are
committed to, or candidates for, clinical studies
of anti-PCSK9 antibodies or may be prescribed an
anti-PCSK9 antibody once approved. Based upon
the status of Phase 3 clinical programs, we
believe one or more PCSK-9 products could
receive approval as early as 2015. This may
make it more difficult for us to generate revenues
and achieve profitability.”


There are other potential non-PCSK9 inhibitor competitors
for the HoFH market including Anacetrapib, developed by
Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp (MRK), which is a fully enrolled
Phase III study expected to be completed in June 2014 .
There are few commercial details regarding the Merck-
sponsored drug but nevertheless it is potentially more
competition in a minute niche market. Even if AEGR
manages to have their drugs prescribed to non-HoFH
patients and somehow get them reimbursed they will still
be faced with significantly cheaper and safer competitors
with fewer and less severe side effects which will be
favored by both patients and insurance companies. All of
these factors are likely to dramatically reduce AEGR’s off-
label market and have a significant impact on its on-label
HoFH market as well.


On-Label Market Is Suffering From Increasing
Discontinuation Rates And A Meaningful Number Of
Non-Starters


At the end of Q II 2013, 463 patients were reported to be
in therapy. At the end of Q IV, that number declined to
430. That’s not exactly robust growth for JUXTAPID. The
flat to declining patient count probably reflects a greater
dropout rate than anticipated. Currently, 15% (vs. 10%
earlier estimate) of patients drop out after starting
treatment. Dropouts typically occur during the first month

or two of the commencement of treatment. Management is
confident they have enough data to assume the dropout
rate will hold steady at 15% going forward. We doubt that
is the case. What’s unknown is how patients tolerate
treatments and the strict diet regimen over time; most
active patients only began treatment within the last six
month. We don’t know how many patients are currently
using the drug or for how long. Also, we don’t think it is
plausible that insurance companies will pay the annual cost
for the drug ($235,000 to $290,000) over time particularly
with less expensive alternatives from competitors on the
horizon. Additionally, the BAML survey found that 26% of
patients dropped out due to adverse events, not to
mention the additional 18% drop out rate due to coverage
issues which were discussed earlier.


The clinical trials also had a higher dropout rate, 21%, due
to side effects59, as per the company’s disclosure to the
FDA below:


As per the QIV 2014 results, AEGR found that patient-
elected non-starts are more “meaningful” than assumed. A
greater number of patients than expected who were
prescribed, including some with insurance preauthorization,
elected not to start treatment. This issue surfaced in the
second half of the year, when patients were first being
brought onboard and AEGR started reporting revenues.
Management put a brave face on this issue by stating that
with more information/education, patients will sign up in
the future.


Increasing discontinuation and patient non-starts are
affecting AEGR’s small on-label market, so it’s not looking
good for AEGR and JUXTAPID no matter how you look at it.

The US patent will expire in February 2015. However, AEGR
has applied for an additional five-year patent term
extension under the Hatch Waxman law . We do not know
whether AEGR will receive the extension, which remains a
major risk.


What Investors Don’t Know Can Hurt Them


One of the red flags we noted during the Q IV 2013
investors conference call was a statement by CEO, Marc
Beer, that management’s goal is to provide top line
revenue results but not the lomitapide prescription and
patient metrics needed to understand the top line. The
following quote is from a transcript of the conference call:


“As you know, our goal has been to move away
from providing detailed lomitapide prescriptions
and patient metrics and shift focus to our top line
revenue guidance, with revenue results serving
as the best barometer of our business. We do
understand though, however, that the investor
desire to have more visibility into the business.
So I do not plan to go back necessarily to the
detailed metrics that we laid out in the first half
of ’13, nor do I plan on revisiting metrics for each
of our quarterly calls this year.”


Mr. Beer is basically saying that he understands investors’
desires to have more visibility into the business, but he’s
not going to give it? Further, he is not going to discuss
previously disclosed metrics and guidance. We are baffled
that investors and, for that matter, the SEC would accept
such a brazen attitude regarding the disclosure of data
essential for investors to have visibility into a business.
After all, the data regarding prescription and patient
metrics are readily available so why not disclose it? At a
minimum, investors should be able to track the number of

patients taking lomitapide, how long they have been on the
drug, the number of patients who began therapy and later
dropped out, the number of new prescriptions and how
many actually began therapy and how many elected not to
start. We can only surmise that disclosing this data is
uncomfortable for management because the drug and
business are not performing as planned and they do not
want to be held accountable for previous statements and
guidance. AEGR’s management might be more comfortable
not disclosing essential information but we as investors are
not.


Conclusion


AEGR is a one drug company. So goes JUXTAPID, so goes
the company. The evidence to date is that the drug is
floundering in the market. We have not included a
valuation analysis in this report because JUXTAPID is an all
or nothing proposition for AEGR. As stated earlier, the
current market price suggests that AEGR will treat 1,800
patients worldwide. As demonstrated throughout this
report, this scenario is highly unlikely since many of these
would be off-label prescriptions which face so many
independent challenges including, regulatory risk, EU
requiring genetic tests, insurance companies only
reimbursing on-label, increasing on-label competition and
cheaper safer drugs targeting both the on and off-label
markets. If AEGR survives one or two they are likely to be
hit by the others.


AEGR’s Chief Medical Officer, who should know more about
the HoFH market than anyone else, and their US and
International and Global Supply President, who should
know more about the sales aspect of the market than
anyone else, do not retain any stock they receive through
options grants and sell immediately as their options are
exercised. If they do not believe in the AEGR story, then
why do you?
