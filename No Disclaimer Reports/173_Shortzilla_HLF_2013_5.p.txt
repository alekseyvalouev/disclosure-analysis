On January 10, 2013, Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) held a conference for the purpose of
rebutting Pershing Square's allegation that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme.


In the January 10th presentation (immediately preceding the Q&A section of the
presentation) Amy Greene stated the following:


Before we open for Q & A I just want to make one statement to you all. Herbalife is a
company, as I've said before, that strives for transparency and as such we would like
to comment on a recent news article. We contacted regulators in connection with the
current situation and beyond that we will have no additional comment.


It is noteworthy that Greene omitted the identities of the regulators (note the statement
was that Herbalife contacted "regulators" as opposed to a regulator). Also, Green omitted
the material fact (as revealed February 19, 2013, when Herbalife filed and published it
10K 2012) that "the SEC's Division of Enforcementâ€¦requested information regarding the
Company's business and financial operations" until it filed and published its 10K 2012.


On February 19, 2013, Herbalife filed and published its 10-K for year ending December
31, 2012. Item 1A (RISK FACTORS) begins on page 25 and concludes on page 44.
Slipped into this section, on page 30, is the following:


From time to time, we receive inquiries from various government authorities
requesting information from the Company. Following December 2012 market events
and a subsequent meeting we requested with the staff of the SEC's Division of
Enforcement, the staff requested information regarding the Company's
business and financial operations. Consistent with its policies, the Company is
and will fully corporate with these inquiries. (Emphasis added)


From the unknown date that the SEC requested information regarding Herbalife's
business and financial operations until Herbalife revealed this material fact in its 10-K
2012 on February 19, 2013, Herbalife was in possession of material non-public
information.
