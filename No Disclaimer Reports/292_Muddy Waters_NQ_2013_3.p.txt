NQ: Maintaining <$1 price target 
 


Chinese Media Exposes Lies About NQ “Partnerships” 
 
It is beneficial for US investors to read Chinese media coverage of our NQ reports.  This 
update consists of English translations of four articles that have appeared in Chinese 
media in the past week.  There are two articles quoting certain of NQ’s purported partners 
(e.g., ZTE) as stating that NQ fabricated the partnerships.  One article covers the 
disappearance of NQ / FL Mobile’s games from the iTunes store.  One article is an IM 
exchange between Chinese investors and Chairman Lin.  (The host of the chat was 
Xueqiu.com, a Chinese investment site.)  Chairman Lin seems to take pain to avoid 
directly answering tough questions, such as those stating that NQ’s market share claims 
do not match with Chinese investors’ observations.  The articles also mention Chairman 
Lin’s (unverified) claim that NQ has sued Muddy Waters in China.   
 
The articles are: 
 


• NQ’s "Business Partners” ZTE, Huawei and Lenovo, Denied There Was Pre-
installation Cooperation, The Beijing News, Oct. 30, 2013. 


• NQ Accused of Unilaterally Fabricating Reports of Cooperation with ZTE, 
Money.163.com, Oct. 25, 2013. 


• FL Mobile: iOS Games Drop-off Issue Still Under Discussion, Sina Technology, 
Oct. 29, 2013. 


• NQ Mobile CEO Yu Lin: We have filed a lawsuit in China against Muddy 
Waters, and are considering organizing an anti-Muddy-Waters group, Caijing 
News, Oct. 29, 2013.

NetQin’s	
  “Business	
  Partners”	
  ZTE,	
  Huawei	
  and	
  Lenovo,	
  Denied	
  There	
  
Was	
  Pre-­‐installation	
  Cooperation	
  
	
  


Some	
  of	
  NetQin’s	
  alleged	
  business	
  partners,	
  such	
  as	
  mobile	
  phone-­‐related	
  
companies	
  ZTE,	
  Huawei,	
  Lenovo,	
  etc.,	
  claimed	
  to	
  have	
  no	
  pre-­‐installation	
  business	
  
with	
  NetQin	
  during	
  interviews	
  with	
  the	
  reporter	
  yesterday.	
  
	
  


After	
  NetQin	
  was	
  questioned	
  by	
  the	
  short-­‐seller	
  and	
  the	
  media,	
  some	
  of	
  
NetQin’s	
  alleged	
  business	
  partners,	
  such	
  as	
  mobile	
  phone-­‐related	
  companies	
  ZTE,	
  
Huawei,	
  Lenovo,	
  etc.,	
  revealed	
  they	
  have	
  had	
  no	
  pre-­‐installation	
  business	
  with	
  
NetQin,	
  during	
  the	
  interviews	
  with	
  The	
  Beijing	
  News	
  reporter	
  yesterday.	
  In	
  response	
  
to	
  this,	
  NetQin	
  expressed	
  there	
  must	
  be	
  a	
  misunderstanding	
  resulting	
  from	
  internal	
  
communication	
  problems	
  with	
  the	
  mobile	
  phone	
  companies.	
   	
   NetQin	
  has	
  adequate	
  
evidence	
  to	
  prove	
  it	
  is	
  genuinely	
  doing	
  pre-­‐installations	
  with	
  these	
  companies.	
  
	
  


NetQin	
  Said	
  It	
  Had	
  Been	
  Cooperating	
  with	
  Huawei,	
  Etc.	
  for	
  Years	
  
	
  


NetQin	
  Mobile,	
  Inc.	
  was	
  established	
  in	
  2005	
  as	
  a	
  mobile	
  phone	
  security	
  
software	
  company.	
  On	
  May	
  5,	
  2011,	
  NetQin	
  was	
  listed	
  on	
  the	
  New	
  York	
  Stock	
  
Exchange.	
  Before	
  that,	
  according	
  to	
  the	
  publicly	
  disclosed	
  data	
  by	
  NetQin,	
  the	
  
number	
  of	
  paid	
  users	
  was	
  6	
  million	
  people.	
  


	
  
On	
  October	
  24,	
  US	
  time,	
  short	
  seller	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  published	
  an	
  81-­‐page	
  


investigative	
  report,	
  alleging	
  that	
  NetQin	
  manipulated	
  data	
  on	
  turnover,	
  made	
  false	
  
market	
  share	
  claims,	
  and	
  overstated	
  the	
  number	
  of	
  paid	
  users.	
  According	
  to	
  the	
  
report,	
  the	
  number	
  of	
  NQ	
  paid	
  users	
  is	
  less	
  than	
  25	
  thousand	
  people,	
  which	
  is	
  
different	
  from	
  the	
  6	
  million	
  NetQin	
  claimed.	
  


	
  
On	
  the	
  afternoon	
  of	
  October	
  25,	
  Beijing	
  time,	
  after	
  NetQin’s	
  eighth	
  anniversary	
  


celebration,	
  when	
  interviewed	
  by	
  the	
  media,	
  NetQin	
  CEO	
  Henry	
  LIN-­‐Yu	
  said	
  NetQin’s	
  
users	
  are	
  comprised	
  of	
  three	
  pieces:	
  registered	
  users,	
  monthly	
  active	
  users	
  and	
  paid	
  
users,	
  and	
  that	
  many	
  of	
  the	
  reports	
  fail	
  to	
  differentiate	
  these	
  three	
  concepts.	
  Half	
  of	
  
NetQin’s	
  users	
  are	
  located	
  overseas	
  (whereas	
  half	
  are	
  in	
  China),	
  covering	
  over	
  150	
  
countries.	
  Currently,	
  there	
  are	
  370	
  million	
  registered	
  users	
  (excluding	
  FL	
  Mobile),	
  
120	
  million	
  of	
  which	
  are	
  monthly	
  active	
  users,	
  and	
  11.3	
  million	
  of	
  those	
  are	
  monthly	
  
paid	
  users.	
  There	
  are	
  two	
  main	
  sources	
  of	
  NetQin’s	
  users:	
  pre-­‐installed	
  mobile	
  


Page 3 of 18
phones	
  and	
  online	
  downloads.	
  In	
  the	
  meantime,	
  cooperation	
  exists	
  on	
  
pre-­‐installations	
  between	
  NetQin	
  and	
  mobile	
  phone	
  manufacturers	
  ZTE,	
  Huawei,	
  
Coolpad,	
  Lenovo,	
  etc.;	
  there	
  are	
  30	
  thousand	
  sources	
  on	
  the	
  Internet.	
  The	
  definition	
  
of	
  an	
  active	
  user,	
  according	
  to	
  NetQin,	
  is,	
  “NetQin’s	
  software	
  installed	
  by	
  the	
  user,	
  
which	
  is	
  able	
  to	
  connect	
  to	
  the	
  server”.	
  


	
  
While	
  Lin	
  participated	
  in	
  an	
  online	
  interview	
  yesterday,	
  he	
  again	
  stressed	
  that	
  


there	
  has	
  been	
  cooperation	
  on	
  pre-­‐installations	
  between	
  NetQin	
  and	
  a	
  number	
  of	
  
mobile	
  phone	
  manufacturers,	
  such	
  as	
  Huawei,	
  ZTE,	
  Lenovo,	
  Coolpad,	
  Gionee,	
  Oppo,	
  
etc.	
  over	
  the	
  years.	
  “In	
  the	
  coming	
  year,	
  there	
  will	
  be	
  almost	
  300	
  million	
  in	
  output	
  
volume	
  for	
  orders	
  from	
  Huawei,	
  ZTE,	
  Lenovo	
  and	
  Coolpad.”	
  Yet,	
  Lin	
  rejected	
  the	
  
request	
  of	
  “listing	
  the	
  cooperative	
  mobile	
  phones’	
  model	
  numbers”	
  from	
  Internet	
  
users.	
  


	
  
Many	
  Mobile	
  Phone	
  Manufacturers	
  Denied	
  the	
  Said	
  Cooperation	
  
	
  
Yesterday,	
  mobile	
  phone	
  manufacturers	
  ZTE,	
  Huawei,	
  Lenovo,	
  etc.,	
  told	
  the	
  


Beijing	
  News	
  reporter	
  they	
  have	
  had	
  no	
  pre-­‐installation	
  business	
  with	
  NetQin.	
  
	
  
ZTE	
  admitted	
  that	
  there	
  were	
  business	
  discussions	
  with	
  NetQin.	
   	
   However,	
  for	
  


reasons	
  including	
  the	
  pre-­‐installation	
  charge,	
  this	
  cooperation	
  never	
  happened.	
  Later,	
  
ZTE	
  developed	
  its	
  own	
  security	
  app,	
  “Mi-­‐Assistant	
  (掌心管家)”,	
  so	
  then	
  there	
  was	
  no	
  
need	
  to	
  pre-­‐install	
  NetQin’s	
  software.	
   	
   ZTE	
  has	
  never	
  had	
  business	
  cooperation	
  with	
  
NetQin	
  on	
  pre-­‐installations.	
  


	
  
A	
  related	
  person	
  from	
  Lenovo	
  also	
  indicated	
  that	
  Lenovo	
  has	
  its	
  own	
  “Safe	
  (乐


安全)”	
  product,	
  which	
  is	
  a	
  competitor	
  of	
  NetQin;	
  thus,	
  Lenovo	
  never	
  pre-­‐installed	
  
NetQin.	
  A	
  related	
  person	
  from	
  Huawei	
  also	
  expressed	
  that	
  Huawei	
  has	
  
communicated	
  with	
  NetQin,	
  but	
  has	
  never	
  had	
  formal	
  pre-­‐installation	
  cooperation	
  
with	
  NetQin.	
  Coolpad	
  expressed	
  it	
  has	
  not	
  cooperated	
  with	
  NetQin	
  on	
  
pre-­‐installation	
  for	
  at	
  least	
  two	
  years.	
  


	
  
Regarding	
  these	
  denials,	
  a	
  NetQin	
  contact	
  replied	
  this	
  must	
  have	
  been	
  a	
  


misunderstanding	
  resulting	
  from	
  internal	
  communication	
  problems	
  with	
  the	
  mobile	
  
phone	
  companies,	
  and	
  that	
  NetQin	
  has	
  adequate	
  evidence	
  to	
  prove	
  that	
  it	
  is	
  
genuinely	
  doing	
  pre-­‐installation	
  business	
  with	
  these	
  companies.

  promised

  that

  that	
  


night,	
  NetQin	
  would	
  announce

  Muddy

  accusation.	
  
Nevertheless,	
  as	
  of	
  the	
  time	
  this

  article	
  published	
  last	
  night,	
  NetQin	
  still	
  had	
  not	
  
announced	
  its	
  said	
  reply.	
  


	
  
Due	
  to	
  the	
  nonexistence	
  of	
  the	
  “strong	
  reply”,	
  investors	
  showed	
  hesitation	
  


about	
  NetQin’s	
  business	
  performance,	
  and	
  the	
  stock	
  price	
  continues	
  to	
  drop.	
  
	
  
On	
  October	
  28,	
  NetQin’s	
  stock	
  price	
  reached	
  a	
  low	
  of

  by

  a

  Now,

  is	
  seeking

  this

  there	
  


have

  that

  after	
  serious	
  
investigation,	
  and	
  does

  the

  a	
  more	
  concrete	
  message	
  on	
  their	
  


company	
  website	
  on	
  October	
  29.	
  Nevertheless,	
  as	
  of	
  the	
  time	
  this	
  new	
  article	
  was	
  
published	
  last	
  night,	
  NetQin	
  still	
  has	
  not	
  released	
  the	
  said	
  message.	
  In	
  addition,	
  Lin	
  
has	
  also	
  promised	
  that	
  NetQin	
  will	
  never	
  withdraw	
  from	
  the	
  market.	
  NetQin	
  strives	
  
to	
  be	
  a	
  hundred-­‐year-­‐great-­‐enterprise.	
  


	
  
The	
  Company	
  Published	
  Its	
  Accounts	
  As	
  Proof	
  of	
  Its	
  Strong	
  Business	
  
	
  
On	
  October	
  24,	
  US	
  time,	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  released	
  a	
  report	
  questioning	
  mobile	
  


phone	
  security	
  software	
  company	
  NetQin	
  about	
  the	
  fake	
  figures	
  from	
  turnover,	
  to	
  
the	
  number	
  of	
  paid	
  users.	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  claimed	
  in	
  the	
  report	
  that	
  at	
  least	
  72%	
  of	
  
NetQin’s	
  revenue	
  from	
  mobile	
  phone	
  security	
  products	
  in	
  China	
  is	
  manipulated,	
  and	
  
that	
  they	
  overstated	
  their	
  market	
  share	
  in	
  China.	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  also	
  pointed	
  out	
  
that	
  the	
  M&A	
  deals	
  made	
  by	
  NetQin	
  may	
  involve	
  corruption,	
  and	
  that	
  its	
  cash	
  
deposit	
  amount	
  may	
  be	
  fake.	
  


	
  
In	
  the	
  telephone	
  conference	
  convened	
  on	
  October	
  25,	
  Beijing	
  time,	
  NetQin	
  


made	
  a	
  verbal	
  reply	
  to	
  the	
  Muddy	
  Waters’s	
  report.	
  Lin	
  said	
  that	
  the	
  accusation	
  made	
  
by	
  Muddy	
  waters	
  was	
  completely	
  fabricated.	
  The	
  company	
  announced	
  that	
  the	
  
board	
  of	
  directors	
  has	
  formed	
  an	
  independent	
  special	
  committee	
  to	
  independently	
  
access	
  the	
  content	
  on	
  of	
  the	
  report.	
  The	
  committee	
  will	
  be	
  comprised	
  of	
  four	
  
independent	
  directors.	
  


	
  
In	
  addition,	
  to	
  prove	
  the	
  strength	
  of	
  the	
  company,	
  NetQin	
  published	
  some	
  


figures	
  of	
  major	
  time	
  deposits.	
  And,	
  NetQin	
  also	
  expressed	
  that	
  after	
  the	
  release	
  of	
  
the	
  results	
  of	
  the	
  3rd	
  quarter	
  of	
  2013,	
  and	
  after	
  the	
  blackout	
  period,	
  the	
  company	
  
will	
  carry	
  out	
  a	
  USD	
  35	
  million	
  stock	
  repurchase	
  scheme.	
  


	
  
NetQin	
  feels	
  very	
  sorry	
  about	
  the	
  stockholders’	
  loss	
  due	
  to	
  the	
  great	
  decline	
  of	
  


stock	
  price.	
  However,	
  the	
  loss	
  was	
  caused	
  by	
  the	
  defamatory	
  comments	
  made	
  by	
  
Muddy	
  Waters;	
  therefore,	
  NetQin	
  has	
  taken	
  legal	
  action	
  in	
  Beijing	
  to	
  sue	
  Muddy	
  
Waters	
  and	
  the	
  report’s	
  writer.

FL Mobile: iOS Games Drop-off Issue Still Under Discussion 


Sina Technology: Oct. 29 morning news. NetQin’s FL Mobile games were dropped off of 


the iOS system as Muddy Waters continued to short sell their stock. In its previous official 


response to this issue, FL Mobile says it is still under discussion. They have also revealed that 


they will compensate their business partners. So far, there is still no result from their discussion.    


Some of FL Mobile’s games cannot be used right now. A source speaking on behalf of the 


company revealed that executives are in talks with related partners and that they have started 


collecting evidence to take legal measures against Muddy Waters. Meanwhile, FL Mobile has 


announced the following measures to protect the interests of their users and partners:  


First, they apologize to all FL Mobile game players for the inconvenience and say they 


will make compensation in future games if players cannot currently play games normally or 


cannot add money to games.  


Second, they will try their best to protect the interests of their partners and proactively 


conduct talks and compensate them.  


Third, they will communicate with related partners, provide related explanations and 


documents, and restore some games back to normal as soon as possible.  


Fourth, they will collect related evidence on how they believe the short seller Muddy 


Waters conspired to attack them. FL Mobile reserves the right to take legal measures against 


responsible parties.

  At

  addressing	
  the	
  report	
  from

  In	
  his	
  response,	
  Yu	
  
mentioned	
  that	
  a	
  lawsuit	
  has	
  already	
  been	
  filed	
  in

  against	
  Muddy	
  Waters

and	
  he

Previously,	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  released	
  a	
  harsh	
  report	
  of	
  NQ	
  being	
  a	
  fraud	
  that	
  caused	
  
NQ	
  stock	
  to	
  fall	
  by	
  half.

How	
  does	
  NQ	
  define

  Do	
  we	
  have	
  to

  to

  Thanks!	
  
	
  
NQ

  You’ll	
  need

  and

  to

Pixiu	
  Chen:	
  What	
  is	
  the	
  expected	
  market	
  profit	
  for	
  NQ	
  this	
  year?	
  Why	
  did	
  Muddy	
  
Waters	
  say	
  that	
  the	
  company	
  was	
  a	
  “zero”	
  after	
  NQ	
  issued	
  its	
  convertible	
  bonds	
  
sale?	
  If	
  NQ	
  delists	
  itself	
  from	
  the	
  New	
  York	
  Stock	
  Exchange,	
  does	
  the	
  company	
  need	
  
to	
  pay	
  back	
  the	
  debt?	
  Or	
  do	
  we	
  not	
  need	
  to	
  worry	
  about	
  the	
  creditors	
  in	
  the	
  U.S.	
  
because	
  we	
  are	
  in	
  China?	
  What	
  other	
  business	
  does	
  NQ	
  plan	
  to	
  do	
  after	
  delisting	
  
itself?	
  
	
  
NQ	
  Yu	
  Lin:	
  NQ	
  will	
  never	
  quit.	
  We	
  are	
  not	
  planning	
  on	
  delisting	
  our	
  company.	
  Our	
  
goal	
  is	
  to	
  make	
  NQ	
  a	
  great	
  company	
  that	
  will	
  last	
  100	
  years!	
  
	
  
Duan	
  Jian:	
  I	
  have	
  three	
  questions.	
  First,	
  when	
  can	
  you	
  provide	
  the	
  proof	
  of	
  the	
  
company’s	
  savings	
  in	
  the	
  bank?	
  Is	
  the	
  $1.6	
  billion	
  at	
  the	
  Standard	
  Chartered	
  Bank	
  
from	
  the	
  convertible	
  bonds?	
  Second,	
  ZTE	
  Corporation	
  openly	
  denied	
  any	
  
collaboration	
  with	
  your	
  company,	
  and	
  requests	
  you	
  to	
  take	
  back	
  the	
  false	
  
statements.	
  What	
  is	
  your	
  explanation	
  on	
  this	
  matter?	
  Third,	
  your	
  company	
  has	
  been	
  
keeping	
  track	
  of	
  the	
  number	
  of	
  registered	
  users.	
  Could	
  you	
  tell	
  me	
  how	
  many	
  users	
  
NQ	
  has	
  now?	
  Also,	
  could	
  you	
  name	
  a	
  few	
  cell	
  phone	
  models	
  that	
  has	
  NQ	
  software	
  
preinstalled	
  and	
  are	
  still	
  available	
  in	
  the	
  market?	
  Thanks.	
  
	
  
NQ	
  Yu	
  Lin:	
  First,	
  we	
  have	
  already	
  made	
  all	
  the	
  bank	
  savings	
  public.	
  We	
  are	
  probably	
  
the	
  first	
  listed	
  company	
  globally	
  that	
  is	
  this	
  transparent.	
  Further	
  work	
  is	
  still	
  
ongoing.	
  The	
  $1.6	
  billion	
  in	
  the	
  Standard	
  Chartered	
  Bank	
  is	
  the	
  investment	
  money	
  
from	
  the	
  convertible	
  bonds.	
  	
  Second,	
  the	
  issue	
  with	
  ZTE	
  Corporation	
  is	
  a	
  
misunderstanding	
  by	
  the	
  media.	
  The	
  interviewee	
  does	
  not	
  have	
  enough	
  knowledge	
  


Page 11 of 18
of	
  the	
  collaboration	
  between	
  NQ	
  and	
  ZTE.	
  We	
  have	
  announced	
  the	
  global	
  
collaboration	
  with	
  ZTE	
  three	
  weeks	
  ago.	
  We	
  have	
  been	
  a	
  long-­‐term	
  strategic	
  partner	
  
with	
  ZTE.	
  This	
  will	
  be	
  clarified	
  today.	
  	
  
	
  
Hao	
  Duo:	
  Your	
  subsidiary	
  company,	
  FL	
  Mobile’s	
  games,	
  has	
  recently	
  been	
  removed	
  
from	
  the	
  Apple	
  App	
  Store.	
  What	
  is	
  the	
  reason	
  for	
  that?	
  When	
  do	
  you	
  expect	
  to	
  have	
  
the	
  games	
  back	
  to	
  the	
  App	
  Store?	
  Also,	
  Apple	
  has	
  improved	
  its	
  algorithm	
  against	
  
ranking	
  fraud.	
  	
  Will	
  this	
  affect	
  the	
  future	
  development	
  of	
  NQ?	
  
	
  
NQ	
  Yu	
  Lin:	
  Many	
  companies	
  (e.g.,	
  Tencent,	
  Baidu,	
  Renren	
  Network,	
  etc.)	
  have	
  
encountered	
  similar	
  problems.	
  Our	
  products	
  are	
  not	
  the	
  only	
  ones	
  being	
  removed	
  
this	
  time.	
  We	
  have	
  already	
  communicated	
  with	
  the	
  Apple	
  App	
  Store,	
  and	
  expect	
  to	
  
resolve	
  this	
  issue	
  in	
  three	
  weeks.	
  It	
  will	
  not	
  affect	
  the	
  future	
  development	
  of	
  our	
  
company.	
  We	
  are	
  very	
  optimistic	
  about	
  the	
  mobile	
  gaming	
  industry.

Jiu	
  Chen:	
  Among	
  all	
  the	
  allegations	
  from	
  Muddy	
  Waters,	
  the	
  key	
  one	
  is	
  about	
  the	
  
company	
  Yidatong	
  (YDT).	
  They	
  claimed	
  to	
  have visited 10 sites purportedly occupied 
by YDT, all of which were empty or did not exist. The management of NQ has released 
the address of YDT headquarters in a meeting. Could you release more information on 
the business of YDT, the locations of its individual sites, the number of employees at 
each location, and management background? This information is easily verified and very 
persuasive information, and would solve 80% of the current problems in my opinion. 
 
NQ Yu Lin: YDT is a service provider and provides mobile billing service, which is one 


Page 12 of 18
of the billing channels for NQ. We also have other payment methods such as 19pay and 
Alipay. For small bills, mobile billing services such as YDT are very easy options. For 
large bills, Shenzhoufu and Alipay are better. 
 
Danielz: NQ has 60% of the market in China, and millions of downloads from Google 
abroad. However, a lot of Internet users in China have never heard of NQ. I suspect it is 
not that well known overseas either. Does the company realize that there is a huge gap 
between the amount of installation and recognition? What is the cause of this gap, and is 
there any plan to solve this issue? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: Every company’s development is a process, just like a child growing up is a 
process. If our brand has the same reputation as Tencent, Baidu or 360, NQ should not 
have been only a $1 billion company, but a $10 billion company. In the early stage of our 
development, we put our emphasis on the investment of products, technology and sale 
channels. From this year on, we are strengthening our marketing, brand name, and 
communication with the capital markets. You need to allow time for a child to grow up.   
 
To_Dominic: Muddy Waters apparently has some misunderstandings on the savings of 
NQ. Could you answer the savings issue objectively, and directly respond to the issue 
regarding the paid users? For instance, you can list the models and the sale numbers for 
the top 10 paid cellphones. 
 
NQ Yu Lin: We have responded many times to similar questions before. To put it simply, 
NQ and many cell phone companies, such as Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, Coolpad, Gionee 
and oppo, have long-term collaborations on software pre-installation. The global market 
for Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and CoolPad alone is close to $0.3 billion next year. Our users 
are mostly in the Tier 2 – 6 cities, instead of the top tier cities where the investors live.  
 
Lao Yu: I heard that NQ has enough data in hand to respond the 81-page report. The 
response is only delayed due to some process difficulties. Could you elaborate on what 
the difficulties are? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: In the investors’ telecom last Friday, we made a lot of detailed responses, 
including answers to almost every question. We will organize the notes and release them 
on our IR website later today, for easy access by our investors. Currently, only the 
English version is available. 
 
Xudong Zhu: Thanks for all the answers! Could you tell me which city in China has the 
most registered NQ users? And how many users are there in that city? Thanks! 
 
NQ Yu Lin: The provinces with most users are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan.  
 
Lao Yu: You mentioned previously that NQ would file a lawsuit against Muddy Waters. 
When will that happen? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: We have already filed the lawsuit in China. We will file more lawsuits in 


Page 13 of 18
Hong Kong and in the U.S. later. We want to solve this issue through the legal process.  
 
Chao Wang: Search portals have become the focus of mobile competition now. At its 8-
year anniversary, NQ announced that it would build advertisement and search platforms 
in the future. Could you elaborate on the intention of this decision? What does NQ have 
to compete with international giants? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ aims to become the global mobile Internet platform company. We do not 
do business on mobilizing the Internet service, as that is the advantage of traditional 
giants in the field. We only design Internet services that are exclusively for mobile 
phones. This is the advantage of NQ being a mobile-only and mobile-first platform 
company.  
 
Si Ren: What is the business model of NQ? Are there any statistics on the activation rate 
of pre-installed mobile phones? Or is it all included in the number of users?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ has become a global mobile Internet platform company. Our income is 
from mobile security, games, advertisements, a mobile search engine, and service for 
mobilizing businesses. This year, mobile security is about 50% of the income; the others 
constitute the remaining 50%. In the next two years, with the fast development of the 
platform service, we will have a more balanced ratio of all 5 major businesses; each will 
range between 15% and 30%. NQ as a platform company will have a high growth rate 
and stronger anti-risk capability.   
 
Winwin20092010: When will the detailed and strong response to the report be out? Is NQ 
actively working on it? Do you plan on increasing publicity?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: In the investors’ telecom last Friday, we gave a lot of detailed responses, 
including answers to almost every question. We will organize the notes and release them 
at our IR website later today, for easy access by our investors. Currently only the English 
version is available. 
 
Horace: Do you have any word for the previous NQ shareholders? The huge loss this 
time is a huge hit on shareholders’ confidence in NQ.  
 
NQ Yu Lin: We are very sorry for the losses of our shareholders. However, the losses 
were caused by Muddy Waters’ false allegations and the induced panic among investors. 
We have already filed a lawsuit in Beijing against Muddy Waters and the author of the 
report.  
 
Xudong Zhu: You mentioned that NQ has collaborations with ZTE, Huawei, Coolpad and 
Lenovo. But the $0.3 billion you mentioned is the total market from these four cellphone 
companies. Could you give the details on the specific cellphone models that NQ 
collaborates on? (Previously in a telecom, the models NQ provided were mostly from 
Samsung. NQ claimed that these were the top 10 sellers.)

NQ Yu Lin: In the investors’ telecom last Friday, we made a lot of detailed responses, 
including answers to almost every question. We will organize the notes and release them 
at our IR website later today, for easy access by our investors. Currently only the English 
version is available. 
 
Luo Yin: There are no previously successful cases suing short-sellers. Why does NQ 
think it will succeed? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ has come a long way since the establishment of the company with $0.1 
million. We have the world’s best and most fighting team. Our team is very calm this 
time. We will solve any problem! We think it is the best time to invest in NQ.  
 
Lao Yu: In the 81-page report, Muddy Waters pointed out that your employees are 
farmers from Jiangxi Province, and are only good at farming. From what I gathered, 
Muddy Waters’ CEO, Carson Block, was in China from 1997 to 2008, trying to make 
some money. During the 10 years, he has experienced many difficulties. His plan to open 
a financial service company in China did not succeed in 1997, and he lost a lot in 2008 on 
his private storage company in Shanghai. His love for China gradually turned into hate 
after all these events, and he has been interested in killing the successful Chinese 
companies to expand business overseas ever since. Do you think this report has anything 
to do with Muddy Waters’ hate for Chinese companies?  Will you pursue justice for your 
employees? 
  
NQ Yu Lin: Who says farmers cannot program? Poor people can also have the Chinese 
dream! They are pointing at the CEO of one of our sub companies, Ruide.  The CEO 
himself will sue Muddy Waters for it. He is a computer science major college graduate. 
I’d say he has higher education than Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. 
 
Haitian Wang: How much is the cost for NQ to pre-install software on mobile phones? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: The price is changing with the market. This is confidential business 
information. It is about 1 - 2 RMB per user activation. 
 
Haitian Wang: Will the third quarter revenue increase substantially as predicted? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: Of course, we have already predicted that the third quarter revenue will be 
over $51 million.  
 
Youzi: You have been avoiding the real question. How many users does NQ have? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: In the investors’ telecom last Friday, we made a lot of detailed responses, 
including answers to almost every question. We will organize the notes and release them 
at our IR website later today, for easy access by our investors.  
 
Chao Wang: In the press release conference, NQ revealed that Bo Lin is a CEO who 
sleeps in the couch, and Dr. Shi is a CEO who eats fast food lunch boxes. Are other 


Page 15 of 18
employees the same as these two? Do your employees work as hard as those from some 
of the IT companies? What employee benefits do they have? Also, please take care of 
your own health. Don’t work too hard. 
 
NQ Yu Lin: All employees at NQ work very hard. Our efficiency is much higher than 
fellow companies in the same industry. Our principle is always hiring the best people, 
and providing the best environment. 
 
Lao Yu: I was at your company’s 8-year anniversary press release conference. It was 
proposed that the open platform, advertisement, and search service would make 15% of 
the revenue. Another business would make 25% of the revenue. Is there any concrete 
plan on how to promote these businesses? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: For example, we have over 3 million searches on our music searching service. 
The largest music search engine in the world, Shazam, has 10 million searches per day. 
We predict that our service will exceed Shazam and become the largest music search 
engine in the world. We have our own music radar client, which is also installed on the 
smart watches by Samsung. Also, a lot of music client cloud search such as kugou and 
tiantiandongting are using our music search service.  
 
Pegg: May I ask why Suhai Ji left his post? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: Suhai was invited to join another IPO company. He led NQ to successfully 
get listed while we were facing the difficulties from 315, and brought the company value 
to $1 billion. A lot of companies have invited him to be their CFO. We have invited KB 
to become our trusted CFO. KB was the managing director from the investment bank that 
contributed to NQ’s success.  
 
Lao Yu: Rumor has it that ZTE had a representative who denied collaboration with NQ, 
while at the same time NQ has already released the contract with ZTE to money.163.com. 
So the misunderstanding was caused by that one ZTE employee providing false 
information to the media. Since it damaged the reputation of NQ, will you take any action 
on that ZTE employee? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ believes in a company culture based on trust. We hope to build long-term 
trusting relationship with our partners and the media. I personally think it is very 
important to be tolerant. The more tolerant one is, the more successful his business is. 
 
Chao Wang: NQ is a mobile security company in transition to a mobile Internet company. 
What do you see as the biggest difficulty and challenge the company is facing right now? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: We already overcame the biggest difficulties and challenges over the last 1 to 
2 years. We currently have a very clear strategy and complete product line, based on NQ 
Live platform, mobile security, games, advertisements, services on searching and the 
mobile businesses.

Bujie Long: From this June to September, a lot of Chinese companies’ stocks have 
increased substantially. Why did Muddy Waters decide to challenge NQ?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ is a global mobile Internet company that is getting attention from more 
and more investors. We had 350 investors calling in the telecom last Friday, which 
demonstrated the attention NQ gets. It is inevitable to experience some difficulties and 
challenges in the process of building a great company. Companies such as Baidu, New 
Oriental, Focus Media Holding, and 360 all had similar experiences. 
 
Fu Sheng: Affected by the NQ case, all Chinese companies’ stocks had a fall on their 
share values when the stock market opened yesterday. What do you think of the influence 
of the NQ case?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: We hope that all listed Chinese companies in the U.S. will form an anti-
Muddy-Waters group, to fight against short-selling firms like Muddy Waters. It is hard 
for one company alone to fight with many short-selling firms, but will be a lot easier 
when we unite and support each other.  
 
Bake Xing: What is the cost for NQ’s overseas operation? Why it cannot be processed 
with level 1? Is it NQ’s fault or PwC’s fault? Or neither? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: This is misleading. Level 1 is for prices that can be proved through public 
channels. For instance, stock assets are Level 1. Fixed-term deposit is the safest and least 
risky way in China, but it is Level 2 in financial evaluation methods. 
 
Yangyang: Can you release the stock shares of everybody in the management team of NQ?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: Our founders have about 23%, plus options. The whole team holds over 40%. 
Our employees have over 22%, the highest among all Internet companies.  
 
Shuli: According to the 2012 annual report of NQ, your company has 283.4 million 
registered users until Dec 31, 2012, among which 164 million users (57.9%) are in China; 
The average active users are 97.7 million per month, among which 56.9 million (58.2%) 
are in China; The average paid users are 89 million per month, among which 59 million 
(66.3%) are in China. From these data, Chinese users are the majority of NQ’s total users 
and paid users. The Chinese market is the major market of NQ. However, people around 
me do not feel that they can support these data. What is your explanation on this? PS, the 
reason I listed these data is because a lot of NQ fans have been claiming that NQ’s main 
market is overseas, and stating that NQ has never mentioned that its market is mainly 
inside China. 
 
NQ Yu Lin: This is the third party report by SINO Market Research Company. Different 
reports have different definitions on market and research methods. This is the main 
reason for discrepancies in data. We suggest our users to read reports from SINO, Yiguan 
and iResearch to get a more complete and less biased opinion.

Shouzhen: I have two questions. First, is INMOTION SCV a product of NQ? It is very 
different from the main business area of NQ. Why does NQ not focus on mobile Internet 
security? Is it because NQ does not have enough confidence in the business model of 
mobile Internet security area? Second, it has been reported previously that NQ invited 
Jackie Chan to be the product spokesman. Is it true? The mobile Internet security field is 
a relatively new business. Your users were mostly born after 1980. Jackie Chan does not 
have a lot of supporters in this age group. What was the reason NQ invited Jackie Chan 
as spokesman?  
 
NQ Yu Lin: NQ platform is the result of deliberate thoughts of the management team, and 
is also our ambition to become the international giant in the mobile Internet company 
space. We have made solid progress toward our goal in the last two years. Last Friday, 
we revealed the future strategy for NQ in our 8-year anniversary event. We will post 
videos from the event online in the near future. All are welcome to take a look. I believe 
it will help the public to know NQ better. 
 
Abbey1991: I am using the GEAR watch from Samsung, but I cannot see any software 
from NQ. Could you explain this? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: Music Radar is there. It’s developed by a subsidiary company of NQ. 
 
Fengzi Zhang: You are too busy to respond to my question. I am waiting for the stock to 
go up.  
 
NQ Yu Lin: The Capital market is like the Pacific Ocean. There could be waves at any 
time. NQ will continue working for the best benefits for our users, employees and 
shareholders. The way to reward our investors is to keep a healthy long-term 
development on the core business of our company.  
 
Duoduo: I have a question from an American friend. NQ has a lot of very good partners 
such as China mobile and Samsung. Why can’t these partners come out to clear the lies 
from Muddy Waters? 
 
NQ Yu Lin: We have just announced our partnership with international mobile giants 
such as China mobile and Samsung. Muddy Waters is trying to make profit by generating 
panic among investors.
