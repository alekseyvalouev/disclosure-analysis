Summary

TRUP


A FOIA obtained from the State of California shows that an active
case/investigation into Trupanion is being pursued.


Importantly the FOIA also reveals that the company has hired a high powered
attorney who specializes in "Multi-State Litigation" for state licensing issues.


Trupanion has asserted that these investigations were spurred on by competitors or
"short sellers" - however - the timeline does not support the assertion that these
articles were causative.


The regulatory angle of the short thesis is NOT dependent on fines, instead I
expect that the investigations will result in new licensing requirements for TRUP -
which will slow growth.

The first article I wrote on NASDAQ:TRUP I cited that the company had a stratospheric
valuation and some regulatory concerns, which I view(ed) as a toxic brew for
shareholder value. On the heels of that article I posed a few simple questions to the
company about regulatory issues they might be facing, specifically:


Do you - or have you this calendar year - rewarded veterinarian clinics for points
"based off of certificates issued at your [the veterinarian] hospital"?


1.


THIS PROGRAM HAS SINCE BEEN CANCELED BY THE COMPANY2
.
Do you - or have you this calendar year - provided cash rewards to your territory
partners based off of the successful conversion of a new policy holder?


3.


INFORMATION ON THIS PROGRAM IS NOW SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER (addressed below)


4
.


Do you provide training to the veterinarians and their staff that they are specifically
NOT allowed to offer or comment on specific insurance products without being a
licensed agent?


5.


THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TRAINING IS NOT CLEAR
BUT THE REGULATORS SEEM INTERESTED


6
.


We now know that Washington and Colorado have open investigations into TRUP. The
Washington investigation alone was sufficient for me to gain confidence that the stock
would eventually trade below $10, as the increased burden of a rational regulatory
regime would slow growth and increase costs. An important assumption embedded in
the statement above is that regulators from other states would latch on to the
conclusions of the State of Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner (in a
previous report I highlighted that WA and CO represented 6.3% and 3.3% of revenue
respectively). Ultimately I think this would result in a multi-state litigation or settlement
requiring the company to:


Stop paying Veterinarians cash (or points redeemable for goods)1.


Get all territory partners licensed, and thus endure the cost associated with a higher
level FTE (TRUP would then have to compete with other licensed products and pay
scales)


2.


I assume all of this would be accompanied by a nominal fine that is not important to
the short case


3.

California Joins the Fray - 23.3% of Additional Rev at Risk


In the FOIA below you will see that on January 10th Gavin Friedman, General Council
and SVP of Regulatory, informed the State of California that TRUP had hired outside
council to handle "The Matter" GG 2017 00130 with the California Department of
Insurance. According to the company California represents 23.3% of revenue, bringing
the confirmed % of revenue under investigation to 32.9% (including WA and CO).

Who is Ms. Baysinger? She is a partner in the San Francisco office of Dentons who,
"has extensive experience in market conduct and sales practices (including multistate
examinations and investigations), licensing, regulatory approvals, electronic
commerce, transactional matters (including acquisitions, mergers and divestitures of
insurance and non-insurance entities), reinsurance, and product and market
development issues."


Source: Legal500.com


She may prove to be a particularly intelligent hire for the company given that in May of
2017 the State of California announced the appointment of Ken Schnoll as General
Counsel for the California Department of Insurance - previous to his state appointment
he also worked at Dentons US LLP.

Washington State Investigation Temporary Restraining Order


There are a few things we can learn from unpacking the nomenclature of this case
number.


Source: Based on our inquiries with state legal bureaus


Most importantly the case number suggests that this case began in 2017, which is really
only made significant by TRUP's own press release. Per the October 30th, 2018 press
release "Trupanion Provides Public Statement on Business Practices" TRUP claims:


"We believe that recent regulatory inquiries (in 2018) relate to complaints filed by
short sellers."


Unfortunately that's hard to believe as the Washington investigation began on June
12th, 2018 (my first post was August 16th, 2018) - even so the California "matter"
seems to have begun in 2017 suggesting that it both predates the attention the
company has garnered and is not covered by the short-seller statement. The addition of
outside council who specializes in multi-state litigation for insurance products may
suggest that the company is girding for additional coordinated action on the backside of
the Washington State investigation.


Earlier this month TRUP filed for a Temporary Restraining Order ("TRO") preventing the
release of four documents that had been handed over to the Washington State Office of
the Insurance Commissioner ("OIC"). It's unclear what aspect of each of these
documents would be offensive to the public and I don't understand what could be
proprietary about the Territory Partners Agreement given that the pay-scale was made
publicly available by the company via the brochure that I previously published.

I think it is safe to infer that the addition of California to the states that are investigating
TRUP presents a new and potentially significant risk to the business model. It's unclear
why this investigation hasn't been disclosed to investors or why it requires outside
council who specializes in multi-state insurance litigation. I continue to view the security
as high risk given the combination of its valuation and regulatory concerns. $10 seems
(~3x book) to be a very reasonable price for an insurance company that may have to
undergo significant alterations to its sales and marketing programs. I look forward to the
company providing clarification about this new "matter" during the upcoming earnings
call.
