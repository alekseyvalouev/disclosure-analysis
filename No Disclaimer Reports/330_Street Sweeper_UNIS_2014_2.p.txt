Unilife Corporation: How This Hypodermic Needle Company Keeps
Jabbing Investors
Feb. 28, 2014 9:45 AM ET5 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Federal investigators uncovered "recurring systemic issues" at Unilife Corp. (UNIS) and
voiced "concern over the firm's promotional materials," according to FDA records obtained
by TheStreetSweeper.


And despite the misconception that a key lawsuit has been dismissed, the company still
battles its fired vice president's federal complaint alleging UNIS duped shareholders and
broke FDA regulations, TheStreetSweeper has learned.


A huge pension system that owns shares of UNIS has also just filed litigation alleging the
company wastes shareholders' money.


Contentious issues pile up as the prefilled syringe company continues to try to answer an
ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.


TheStreetSweeper's investigation into those issues and others suggests that the
unprofitable Pennsylvania company hawking 90-cent syringes is worth just a fraction of its
roughly $450 million market cap.


Additional red flags whipping this Aussie-rooted company include:


1. Reality falls short of promotions


2. Lawsuit says CEO advises: "Deny everything"


3. Challenging contract agreements


4. Key product challenges


*FDA inspection report reveals problems


U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigators discovered "recurring systemic issues"
and voiced "concern over the firm's promotional materials," according to paper copies of
an inspection report obtained by TheStreetSweeper from the FDA.

Spurred by a consumer complaint, the FDA sent two investigators to York, a central
Pennsylvania community, to spend four days last spring investigating the Unilife
operations.


Alan Shortall, the chief executive, told analysts that the FDA had no findings and even
called the company's system "exemplary."


But the report indicates things did not go smoothly.


Investigators noted "significant weaknesses with respect to production and configuration
management of validation and verification (V&V) test articles."


These are among the issues listed by former vice president Talbot Smith in his
whistleblower lawsuit - a lawsuit that is still very much alive, though many people believe
otherwise.


The FDA investigators also wrote about "poorly documented" non-conforming lots.


Investigators noted, "We observed some evidence of vendor performance issues as
indicated by a relatively high level of in-process nonconformities …"


Investigators noted 26 complaints about UNIS products, including inability to deliver a 1
unit dose, rubber detached from a syringe and a spring popping out of a syringe plunger.


The agents were clearly dissatisfied with management's explanation for why a full
investigation was not done.


"(Another investigator) and I explained that there should have been a more reasonable
explanation and investigation into the cause of the complaint instead of saying that they
didn't have the product to examine," wrote the lead investigator.


During the closeout meeting with Mr. Shortall and three other employees, an investigator
said that the device history records "were full of NCRs," or non-conformance reports.
Since the records dealt with the company's discontinued legacy syringes, the agents didn't
press for further formal investigation of those products.


Investigators also told management that they were concerned about the company's
promotional materials targeting investors and shareholders, which were collected for
referral and "subsequent review by the Agency."


The company did not respond to TheStreetSweeper's request for an interview.

*Despite "absolutely incorrect" reports, UNIS still deals with a former executive's
eye-popping lawsuit.


A lawsuit by former vice president Talbot Smith alleges he was fired because he reported
regulatory violations to the feds. Based on the UNIS press release and reports in
publications, many investors assume this significant lawsuit was recently dismissed.


"Those reports are absolutely incorrect," said Mr. Smith's attorney Virginia Hardwick when
TheStreetSweeper brought those two reports to her attention.


"We stand by the allegations in the complaint," she said.


The securities fraud lawsuit that was actually voluntarily dismissed Jan. 8 was filed by
Byron Brandt, partially based on issues posed in a Forbes story.


The latest filing in Mr. Smith's case indicates the parties plan a conference call on April 17
to possibly schedule a settlement conference.


Mr. Smith's lawsuit contains issues of interest to investors as they try to assess the
company and its management:


1. The lawsuit says the company directed employees to run scrap through production lines
to make visiting investors think UNIS was churning out syringes when it was not. The
company has denied this ever happened.


However, TheStreetSweeper has sources close to the situation who have produced the
dates that employees participated in fake production runs and other details of these
"Potemkin villages."


2.The lawsuit also contains a complaint Mr. Smith filed with the UNIS board of directors
shortly before he was fired. It alleges Mr. Shortall directed employees to break into a
terminated research and development executive's car and steal his computer. We have
the police report - available here - showing a theft occurred. If this crime proves accurate
and is traced back to the company as Mr. Smith contends, it would speak unflattering
volumes about UNIS' culture and management's character.


3. Syringe production costs were about twice what Sanofi would be willing to pay,
according to the lawsuit. Mr. Smith, a Sanford University graduate, reported to fellow
executives that producing the Unifill syringes would cost about 90 cents apiece, yet UNIS
expected to charge Sanofi only 50 to 55 cents apiece. Mr. Smith claims that an employee
was subsequently told to create better-looking estimates.

The company denies those allegations and contends that its former vice president was
wrong and uninformed.


4. The company's answer to the lawsuit says the Sanofi deal sets prices at just over 94
cents for high volume supply.


Here is what Mr. Shortall said during the September 2013 Morgan Stanley Healthcare
Conference:


But what I can say is that I have said previously that we are expecting to get an average
price on the Unifill of around $0.90. We've already done one transaction which is
approximately at $1.50 per unit, and I still think that we can actually hit that target and
that's what we'll be aiming for.


So here it is in a nutshell: if the syringes cost about 90 cents to produce and sell for about
94 cents - or even $1.50 - UNIS is in a heap of trouble.


*Lawsuit: CEO tells ex-girlfriend "deny everything."


While the Smith lawsuit is more current, an earlier one is just as interesting to investors
sizing up the situation.


Mr. Shortall's ex-girlfriend, the mother of two young sons, sued him in 2006 for breach of
trust.


The girlfriend said she loaned Mr. Shortall a total of more than $47,000. He told her "You
will be a rich woman …" after investing in the company.


Mr. Shortall promised her 222,000 shares of the Australia-based UNIS predecessor,
Unitract PTY, in exchange for part of the cash he received, according to court records. The
judge determined those shares weren't transferred and ordered Mr. Shortall to pay her
$548,452.


Sometime after the couple split up, an Australian newspaper reporter Ben Hills was about
to run a story that portrayed Mr. Shortall's background from his time as a consultant to car
dealers selling car alarms, on through his association with three collapsed businesses. Mr.
Shortall attempted to handle the situation with less-than-honest finesse, according to court
records:


In about the middle of January 2004 the defendant rang the plaintiff and told her that there
would be a newspaper story published which would be critical of him. He said, "if Ben Hills
contacts you, you are to deny everything. I cannot transfer the shares to you now as

everyone is watching me." He also said to her "tell anyone who asks not to sell their
shares, the price will probably drop, but it will go up again."


*Reality falls short of promotions


The never-boring Mr. Shortall continues to heavily promote his company, frequently telling
investors how great the company is doing and emphasizing that the pipeline is "teeming."


And he consistently promotes the same contract again and again, to try to ameliorate bad
financial news.


During the May 9, 2013 earnings call, for example, Mr. Shortall said:


Thank you, Todd. Good afternoon and good morning to those in Australia. Before we
discuss the quarter, I am excited to tell you that we are getting ready to announce
our first major long-term supply contract for the Unifill syringe. This is a significant
multi-year commercial supply contract with a major pharmaceutical customer that
generates revenue immediately.


Almost everyone wanted to jump up and shout for what sounded like a brand-new,
exciting development (which sounded much like one announced five years earlier). This
time, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. wanted clarification amidst all the excitement.


Under the analyst's questioning, Mr. Shortall admitted the company had already disclosed
the contract and another one months earlier.


Before the Feb. 3 earnings call, the CEO claimed his company was "entering a period of
hyper-growth," with an upcoming "tsunami" of deals. He touted a dozen deals expected by
the end of 2013. But when it came time to face eager investors during the earnings call,
he couldn't name a single new deal.


Unfortunately, UNIS got only half-way to the year's goal of a dozen deals.


There are many other instances where hyped hopes and dreams simply failed to
materialize, though we'll mention just two more.


The company's 2008 letter to shareholders promised "the first commercial sale of Unifill
Prefilled Syringes to occur towards the end of 2010."


That hasn't happened. The company just signed its first supply contract but hasn't
executed on it four years after the commercial sales were expected to begin.

The letter also noted: UNIS ought to have the capacity to crank out 400 million units yearly
at the end of 2013.


That hasn't happened. The company's latest 10-K states the current capacity is 60 to 70
million units.


It's a company-killer, of course, if a business can't meet the manufacturing requirements of
customers. Analysts frequently question UNIS management on that issue, since they're
concerned that the company may not be able to crank out several 100 million units in time.


"We actually will have that equipment in place, in time, tuned, ready to go and fully
operational to cover that product coming off the line …. for any of our pharmaceutical
customers," Mr. Shortall recently said, adding that customers usually give UNIS about one
to two years to gear up production.


Should investors believe it?


In the FDA report obtained by TheStreetSweeper, investigators noted, "The firm is not
actively manufacturing any commercial product…" If the pharmaceutical companies
demand the production levels required to maintain their exclusive contracts, will UNIS be
able to meet that large demand even though it's never actually produced even the 60-70
million that the plant currently has the capacity to produce?


We recommend investors consider those comments and issues within the context of our
investigation.


*Recent agreements are good news for UNIS but fall far short of the hype.


UNIS announced Unifill product supply contracts with Sanofi and Hikma. UNIS described
this good news in the December filing this way:


These two contracts alone instantly position Unilife to become the second largest provider
of prefilled syringes in the world.


Sounds impressive except that the braggadocio leaves out the fact that "second largest" is
teeny. Again, in UNIS filings, the company admits that the syringe business is already
sewn up.


Industry gorilla Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) is one of five peers that have locked up 95
percent of the market. It could obviously squash UNIS like a cockroach.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2058353-unilife-corporation-how-this-hypodermic-needle-company-keeps-jabbing-investors 7/11


We are aware of five companies which specialize in the production and supply of glass
ready-to-fill syringes. These companies are BD, Gerresheimer, MGlas AG, Schott and
Nuova Ompi. We estimate the market concentration rate for these five companies to be
approximately 95%. We believe BD's market share to be in excess of 50%, as it has
supply relationships with most pharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing
organizations.


BDX reported $41 revenue per share and diluted earnings per share of $4.67.


But UNIS reported 9 cents revenue per share and a minus12 cents EPS.


*Contract and change issues pose red flags for the key product, Unifill.


Sanofi is in command of the arrangement with UNIS. The 150 million yearly Unifill order
mentioned in the press release is simply the amount Sanofi needs to buy if it wants to
maintain exclusivity.


When and if UNIS gets ramped up about four years after market entry, according to
company filings, the arrangement wouldn't be a slam-dunk. If there's a hitch or a company
like Becton Dickinson undercuts UNIS, it's an easy switch away from Unifill.


But there's a potentially even bigger red flag wrapping around the deal to possibly use
Unifill syringes to deliver Sanofi's anti-thrombotic drug Lovenox.


The Lovenox patent has expired and generic competition overall has already punched the
company in the nose, indicates Sanofi's recent half-year report, here.


Lovenox is down almost a full 15 percent.


So UNIS is putting a lot of faith in a drug that's plunged into an ongoing nosedive.


Also, a pharma company isn't necessarily stuck with UNIS just because it has agreed to
use limited numbers of its prefilled syringes in clinical trials. The FDA will allow the
company to switch to another brand of syringe.


"As with any marketing application, a sponsor may make a post-market change in
accordance with the application requirements," said an FDA spokeswoman in an email to
TheStreetSweeper.


"For example, typically post-market component changes require a prior approval
supplement," she said.

Couldn't Unifill easily be picked up by another pharma should something go awry with the
Sanofi deal?


No, not that easily. Unifill syringes are designed just for Sanofi, according to filings.
Though the Hikma deal involves Unifill, it sounds as though a similar Unifill deal is unlikely.
Federal filings state UNIS may not be able to satisfy the biocompatibility needs of other
companies. So potential customers with different manufacturing processes may be
unobtainable.


Check out this telling line from the filing about biocompatibility issues:


Such events may require design, material or process changes to our product, or restrict
our ability to enter into supply relationships with other pharmaceutical companies and
accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.


Auditors have warned of issues that "continue to raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern." So the last thing UNIS needs is more
of the operating/financial troubles noted in the company filing.


*Living like a king


So UNIS is losing millions and management is handing investors a minus 190 percent
return on their money.


But its executives are living like kings.


They can thank the CEO's brand of showmanship that puts P.T. Barnum to shame and
likely contributes to the lofty share price.


And they can also thank their compensation committee with its laugh-out-loud justification
for overpaying the folks running a company that can't seem to turn a dime in profit.


The lowest paid of the bunch is Mr. Shortall, who last year received more than $690,000,
compared with $6 million including unrealized stock awards the prior year.


Including hefty bonuses and stock, the other four officers last year received about $1
million apiece.


Even more stunning is what UNIS pays its directors.


Altogether, the directors earned a total of just over $2 millionin the last two years. For
attending a few meetings.

In that period, the unprofitable company generated just over $8 million in revenue.


So the non-employee directors handed themselves about 25 percent of the company's
revenues.


Each director's annual retainer fee alone jumped $10,000 to $35,000 last December. And
they'll get 35,000 UNIS shares yearly worth about $160,000 in today's market. All courtesy
of the shareholder-approved pay scale created by the three directors on the compensation
committee.


Just for attending a few meetings a year.


*How does UNIS explain this level of self-enrichment?


An entertaining piece of prose gently tucked into the SEC filings tells the tale of rationale.


The company justifies the executive compensation by comparing itself to the likes of
Natus Medical (NASDAQ:BABY) with its $700+ million market cap and $300+ million in
revenue last fiscal year and Exactech (NASDAQ:EXAC) with its $317 million market cap
and over $200 million revenue. Both profitable.


Compare those with UNIS, whose market cap is now over $450 million and revenue for
the year reached just $2.7 million . No profit.


It may get downright irritating when viewed in context with the following:


1. While directors were busy trying to justify being overpaid, auditors were busy combing
UNIS financials.


2. KPMG auditors wrote the following going-down-in-flames statement on UNIS:


3. "… the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and has limited cash
resources, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."


*"Excessive and wasteful" legal claims pit a huge pension plan against UNIS as it
struggles to continue as a going concern.


Indeed, efforts "to recover allegedly 'excessive and wasteful' compensation paid to the
non-executive directors since 2010," form the crux of the latest lawsuit filed against UNIS,
as disclosed in its 10-Q filing with the SEC as a "derivative complaint" or a lawsuit filed by
a shareholder seeking to enforce or defend a right/claim that the company has failed to
do.
