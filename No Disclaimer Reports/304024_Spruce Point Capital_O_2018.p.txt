Spruce Point Has Established A Short Position 
In Realty Income (NYSE: O), Sees 30% to 45% 
Downside For The Following Reasons


The Allure of Rising Magic Dividends: Realty Income (“O Realty” or “the Company”) promotes itself as “The Monthly Dividend 
Company®” and preaches “The Magic of Rising Dividends” – it even goes so far as to market itself differently to retail investors vs. 
sophisticated institutional investors. The Company is very dependent on issuing stock at inflated prices to fund its acquisitive
growth strategy, keep its cost of capital low, and consistently raise its dividend. The model has worked well for years when times 
were good, but we believe this magic cycle is about to break down as investors reassess O Realty’s growth profile amidst  
deteriorating tenant quality, rising interest rates, and a more volatile and discerning capital market backdrop.  


Deceptive Same Store Property Reporting:  Our forensic accounting work indicates that the true underlying economic performance 
of O Realty’s properties, as measured by Same Store Rents (SSR) are declining vs. the company’s promotion that it is growing. The 
Company disclosed its SSR growth rate of 1.2% in 2016.  Our industry normalized definition of same store property performance
suggests that that SSR declined by 0.8% in that period – an astounding 2.0% overstatement.  Once investors come to grips with our 
irrefutable conclusion, we expect a major revaluation in O Realty’s share price. There are ample case studies to show 40%-50% 
share price declines when investors revalue a REIT’s declining performance. For example, Wall Street has penalized a few REITs 
(DDR, BRX, KIM) that own retail properties where the same store growth profile has swung from positive to negative growth. We 
believe that O Realty is the next REIT that is going to be penalized for a deteriorating growth profile by investors.  


Dispositions And Vacancies Are Rising And Likely Aiding Occupancy And SSR Metric Inflation:   We believe that dispositions and 
vacancies are likely managed to cosmetically inflate occupancy and aid O Realty’s SSR metric.  We show dispositions on the rise as 
well as a larger percentage of property sales coming from vacancies.  These trends may indicate more competition from malls as 
well as the limited alternative use for many of O’s real estate properties.     


Investors Should Be Concerned By Background of Management and Audit Committee Oversight By Board: We find that O Realty’s 
executive management team is comprised almost entirely of ex-investment bankers, trained in the art of financial engineering. It
should, therefore, come as no surprise that O Realty could use financial magic to embellish its performance. We have little faith in 
the Company’s audit committee raising any objections or concerns about management’s practices. We find that the audit 
committee is comprised of a PGA golf professional, and former executives from Wells Fargo and KPMG, two of the most scandal-
ridden financial and accounting organizations in recent history. Given all the factors we have noted, it makes sense that insider 
ownership trends are at all-time lows, and lowest amongst its REIT peers.

Spruce Point Has Established A Short Position 
In Realty Income (NYSE: O), Sees 30% to 45% 
Downside For The Following Reasons


Tenant Quality Deteriorating As Retail Landscape Changes:  We conducted a deep dive into the tenant quality and find that O Realty has 
outsized risk exposure to drug stores, grocery stores and movie theaters -- three retail subsectors facing disintermediation.  Drug stores 
(O’s largest sector exposure) are consolidating their retail footprint (i.e. Walgreens purchase of +2,000 Rite Aid stores), while SSS 
performance at the store front is down. Even worse, headlines such as Amazon teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan to 
disrupt the healthcare business present a now tangible long-term risk that the traditional drug delivery value chain through a retail 
footprint could move increasing online. The Amazon risk extends also to the grocery store vertical given its recent acquisition of Whole 
Foods.  We believe that any retail transaction that is done repetitively and frequently (i.e. grocery and drug store) is ripe for online 
disruption, and therefore poses significant risk to the traditional brick and mortar chains and their related real estate profiles.  Lastly, 
movie theater trends (both box office sales and attendance) likely peaked in 2015, and theater chains are not expanding screens. Physical 
movie theater locations are at increasing risk of disruption as Hollywood and media companies (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu) are spending 
money to produce original content for their own “at home” media streaming offerings, and new releases that skip the movie theater 
completely.  


Interest Rate Tightening Cycle Another Major Negative Backdrop For O Realty:  We expect REITs such as O Realty to remain under 
pressure. Consensus expectations is that the 10 year treasury will surpass 3.0% by 1Q’19 and O Realty’s historical stock performance 
exhibits negative correlation with increases in interest rates.  We expect O Realty to underperform the REIT sector given our newly 
documented growth concerns and premium valuation enumerated below.  


Operating Metrics Have Deteriorated While O Realty’s Valuation Remains Sky High:  O Realty has lured a dizzying array of analysts to 
relentlessly promote its story, and make it the most expensive triple net lease retail REIT by a wide margin. Analysts see an average of 
18% upside to $59/share, yet seem to ignore glaring signs of weakness. Even Janet Yellen warned that commercial real estate prices are 
“quite high relative to rents.” O Realty has the lowest occupancy rate of 98.3%. If it had not sold 91 vacant properties since the beginning 
of 2016, the occupancy metric might be as low as 96.6%.  Furthermore, O Realty essentially has the lowest remaining lease term of 9.6 
years amongst its peers and the highest amount of leases expirations (7.8%) versus its peers over the next two years. In that context, we 
created a dividend sustainability index where we incorporate average remaining lease duration in order to assess O Realty’s sustainable 
dividend paying ability vs. prior year periods.  This index now stands at its lowest level since the beginning of our data set in 2005.  
Metrics like this can be an early warning sign that the underlying fundamentals are not as safe as they had been historically. We expect 
that once investors come to grips with the fact that O Realty’s true growth rate is negative, its multiple will re-rate in line with historical 
precedents, and its share price will decline by approximately 30% - 45% or $28 - $35 per share.

Entering a negative feedback loop:  We believe that O Realty is highly dependent on keeping its stock premium inflated 
to lower its cost of capital to pursue growth. However, we will illustrate that its growth is declining, which will leads to a 


lower stock price, higher cost of capital and lower investment spreads.

Peer Group Comparison


O Realty looks priced for perfection.   O trades at the highest multiple within their retail triple net lease peers.   As 
highlighted below, when the growth profile of a REIT begins to decline, the AFFO multiple compresses significantly.

Same Store Property Performance: What

We believe that the underlying economic performance of a REIT should encompass a “Same Store” metric for all 
properties owned regardless of whether they are occupied or vacant.  O Realty excludes vacancies from their same 


store pool. This is not standard industry practice as we find a majority of retail peers include vacancies.

A Closer Look At Vacancies And Releasing 
Activities Suggests Problems Lurking


Source: Company Filings and Supplemental Data


Re-leasing activity has declined. 
Does this indicate limited alternative 


use? Or have malls and shopping 
centers started to infringe on the 


typical box tenants?


% of vacancy sales from the available 
pool have increased


Tenant demands upon releasing are 
increasing -- the amount of capital 


required to release the same property 
is now 69% of year 1 rent vs. 0% in 


2014 and 2015


Vacancy trends indicate a tougher triple net lease environment for landlords.  Have the recent vacancies issue at malls 
begun to blead over to the stand-alone boxes?   Are malls and shopping centers now offering leases that typical triple 


net lease tenants cannot refuse?

Retail Tenant Risk


Amazon has been rumored to enter the pharmacy business (Bloomberg.com) and the Whole Foods acquisition implies 
that the expansion of the Amazon eco-system could pose secular risks to a significant portion of what historically has 
been deemed safe haven real estate assets for the triple-net lease space. We believe that any retail transaction that is 


done repetitively and frequently (i.e. grocery and drug store) will move online and poses significant threat to the 
traditional brick and mortar chains and their related real estate.

Walgreens Is O Realty’s #1 Tenant


Walgreen’s U.S. store foot print is suffering with SSS down since the end of 2015.  Further, we see looming risk from 
store closures from its recently closed deal to acquire 2,186 stores from Rite Aid. In October 2017, Walgreens 


announced a store optimization program where it will close approximately 600 stores.

Movie Theaters: 5.1% of O Realty’s Rent


Industry Box office and attendance trends are both suffering from systemic issues in the exhibitor business. The 
shrinking window where content can been seen exclusively in a movie theater versus at home has narrowed 


significantly.  Furthermore, some movies are released via an on demand device at the same time as the theater release.   
Perhaps, even more alarming Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook all are devoting more capital to original 


content.  We believe as these trends become more pronounced that they will pose risk to all of the movie theater 
chains, which have not been investing in new screen growth (bottom right chart).  Lastly, there is limited alternative 
use for movie theater real estate, so releasing to a new tenant will be challenging without significant capital outlays.

Insider Ownership Declining, While Passive 
Indices Buying A Red Flag


Insider ownership levels are at the lowest since inception, while index buyers such as Vanguard represent a disturbing 
trend of increased ownership. We suspect Vanguard might be taking O Realty’s SSR growth figures at face value and 


plugging them into their financial models to calibrate the share price. We hope our evidence suggesting declining SSR 
will help to correct the over-valuation issue.

Analyst Always Bullish, 
Still See 18% Upside In O Realty


O Realty’s bullish analysts point to its advantageous cost of capital, and relative balance sheet strength.  We believe 
that the analyst community needs to spend more time analyzing the core “organic” growth profile of the Company.  


We also believe that the underlying systemic pressures in some of its major retail sub-sectors needs to be a risk that 
investors are appropriately compensated for. We applaud Goldman Sachs for being the lone skeptic and below market 


price target on O Realty. We expect other brokers to follow with downgrades.

Peer Group Comparison


O Realty looks priced for perfection. O trades at the highest multiple within their retail triple net lease peers.  As 
highlighted below, when the growth profile of a REIT begins to decline, the AFFO multiple compresses significantly.  


Source: Bloomberg, Company Filings  and Spruce Point Estimates
(1)  For shopping centers, this metric is Same Property NOI; For the triple net lease retail, this metric is Same Store Rental Revenue
(2)  P/ AFFO for 2016 and 2017 is based on stock prices at 12/31/15 and 12/31/16, respectively.   2017 and 2018 P/ AFFO multiple is based on current stock prices

Peer Group – Triple Net Lease Retail


We question why the street is valuing O Realty at the highest amongst its peers when its occupancy, lease duration 
and near term lease renewals all reflect a status at the bottom of their peer group.  Further, we will show later in this 


presentation why the growth profile should be questioned.  


Highest Valuation
i.e. “most expensive”


Lowest Occupancy 
Second lowest duration of leases (by 0.1 years)
Most leases up for renewal in next two years


Lowest Insider Ownership

Spruce Point Estimates 30% - 45% Downside


We arrive at our price target by applying a range of AFFO multiples commensurate with precedent REIT stocks going 
into financial decline (DDR, Brixmor, Kimco)


The forward AFFO 
multiple compresses by 
an average of 7.0x for 


retail REITS that 
transition to a lower 
growth or negative 


growth profile
