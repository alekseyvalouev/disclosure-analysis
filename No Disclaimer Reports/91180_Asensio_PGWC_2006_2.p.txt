Meet PGWC’s Picture Perfect


CFO


Today, Pegasus Wireless Corporation’s (NASDAQ: PGWC


$5.23) announced that the Company’s President, Jasper


Knabb, will be ringing the ceremonial NASDAQ opening bell


in Times Square on Friday, July 21, 2006, at 9:30 AM Eastern


Standard Time.


Stephen Durland and Edward Celano oversee PGWC’s


�nancial reporting (asensio.com issued a separate report


titled “PGWC and Jasper Knabb: A Match Made In Penny-


Stock Heaven” about certain events in Mr. Knabb’s work


history).


Mr. Durland is Pegasus Wireless Corporation’s current Chief


Financial O�cer and a Director. Earlier, Mr. Durland’s


Certi�ed Public Accounting (“CPA”) �rm, Durland & Company,


was Pegasus and its predecessor’s auditor.


On March 29, 2006 the Public Accountancy Oversight Board


(“PAOB”) issued a report �nding that Durland & Company


failed in the Review of Audit Engagements including “to


identify, or to address appropriately, departures from GAAP


that related to potentially material misstatements in the


audited �nancial statements concerning (a) the accounting


for a business combination and (b) the reporting of earnings


per share and related disclosures in light of a stock split.”

Mr. Durland was Medical Makeover Corporation of America’s


(OTCBB: MMAM, $0.02) Chief Executive O�cer and a director


until his resignation on July 7, 2006. Much like Mr. Durland’s


involvement with PGWC, his involvement with MMAM began


when his �rm served as MMAM’s auditor.


In January 2004, Mr. Durland’s �rm resigned as MMAM’s


auditor stating it had “substantial doubt” about the MMAM’s


ability to continue as a going concern. After his own �rm’s


resignation, Mr. Durland became the MMAM’s acting CFO


and President, and Chief Accounting O�cer.


The PAOB incident was not Mr. Durland’s �rst brush with a


regulatory agency over questionable practices.


On April 08, 2002 Mr. Durland’s CPA license in North Carolina


was suspended for three years for the failure to pay


employee payroll taxes from March 31, 1996, through


September 30, 1998, totaling $235,529.97.


According to the North Carolina State Board of Certi�ed


Public Accountant Examiners, Mr. Durland’s license was


never reinstated.


Edward Celano joined PGWC’s board in early 2006. He is the


Chairman of the Audit Committee and director of PGWC. He


holds the same positions with SyntheMed, Inc (OTCBB: SYMD


$0.65), which was formerly called Life Medical Sciences. Until


April 5, 2000, Mr. Celano was a Director of Emerging Vision,


Inc. (“Emerging Vision”), which was formerly called Sterling


Vision, Inc.


Both Emerging Vision and SYMD were brought public by LT


Lawrence and Co. Inc., a brokerage �rm that along with its


Principals and President was barred from the Securities


Industry by the National Association of Securities Dealers on


February 28, 2000 for defrauding investors.

Interestingly enough, Mr. Celano’s distinguished ties to


SYMD and Emerging Vision are not disclosed in any of his


biographies included in PGWC’s �lings.


Three di�erent auditing �rms have audited PGWC’s �nancial


statements from its incorporation as Burrard Technologies,


Inc. in 2000.


Investors and policy makers may be justi�ably concerned


about the NASDAQ’s selection process for this ceremony,


and the NASDAQ’s diligence in reviewing the soundness of


the companies it allows to be featured on CNBC’ Squawk Box
