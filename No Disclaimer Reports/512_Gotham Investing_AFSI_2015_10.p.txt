Recently Uncovered Italian Regulatory Filings Raise More Red Flags
At AmTrust

Summary


Regulatory Filings Indicate AEL's Capital Buffer Is Less Than Implied in AFSI's 10-K.


UK Subsidiary AEL's Solvency Ratio Is Well Below Peers & Dangerously Thin.


AEL May be Under Scrutiny due to Public Actions Taken by Shorts and Former
Business Partners.


AFSI Has Been Silent Towards Critics, but Equity Issuance Validates Shorts'
Arguments.


Introduction:


Despite detailed, public criticisms of its accounting practices and capital position, AmTrust
Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI), has not addressed the allegations raised.


I have also questioned the capital adequacy of AFSI on several occasions, so when the
company issued 3 million shares of equity, which I believe validates my view. However, I
still believe AFSI is significantly under-capitalized.


I believe recently uncovered documents AmTrust filed with Italian regulators demonstrate
my point.


AmTrust Europe, Ltd. ("AEL") wrote policies that generated approximately $559.9 million
in gross premiums throughout Europe in 2013 (Source: AM Best Credit Report). AFSI's
lines of business in Europe include Legal Expense (NASDAQ:UK) and Medical
Malpractice (primarily in Italy).


Section I. Regulatory Filings Indicate AEL's Capital Buffer Is Less Than Implied in
AFSI's 10-K


AmTrust's 10-K (Footnote 22) implies that AEL has approximately 399% ($246.3 million /
$61.7 million) of the minimum amount of capital required by its regulatory authority.

However, AEL reports a rather different amount to Italian regulators -- just 143%.

2. Information about the financial position of the Company


The data on the financial position of the company listed below refer to the last
approved budget for all -of-year 2013. The amount of equity at 31/12/2013 and 202
million euro, of which the part relating to the share capital and amounted to 87.2
million euro* and the part related to the total capital reserves amounted to 116
million euro.


The index of solvency, reported to management and damage equal to 143 %
(this index is the ratio of the amount of the solvency margin is available and
the amount of the solvency margin required by law.


*Using the exchange rate for GBP/EUR of 1.22362, the prevailing rate as of the date
this was signed.


Since the 10-K clearly denotes statutory capital and statutory capital requirements, the
ratio should align for both sources.


Instead, the ratios for existing/required capital are so different that it raises more questions
about AFSI's true capital position -- with important implications in light of the NYDFS
conditions that are being phased in (3:1 Premiums-to-Surplus in this case) and the
risk of credit agreement violations (consolidated statutory surplus covenant).


Section II. AEL's Solvency Ratio Is Well Below Peers & Dangerously Thin


At 143%, AEL's solvency "cover ratio" is barely over half as adequate as the industry
average (276%) for Italian non-life insurance companies (over two-thirds of AEL's loss
reserves relate to their Italian Medical Malpractice business.

Even without the benchmark of its Italian peers, 143% seems quite low. After all,
"Regulatory Action Level Risk-Based Capital ("RBC")" is 150% in the U.S. In other words,
a U.S. insurer capitalized similar to AEL would be subject to strict oversight and a
corrective order.


Section III. AEL Is Under Scrutiny by AFSI's Critics and Former Partners


UK and Italian regulators likely have AEL (and AFSI) on their radars given two recent
direct communications from parties critical of AFSI -- short-sellers and their former
business partner, Trust Risk Group.


Short-Seller


AFSI critic, Alistair Capital, recently wrote a letter to the UK Prudential Regulation
Authority explaining why it believes AEL poses a risk to policyholders.


The primary concern expressed towards AEL appears to have been that AmTrust
International Insurance Ltd., or "AII" (AFSI's Bermuda subsidiary), AEL's primary reinsurer
does not have the wherewithal to meet its obligations.


Worse still for AEL, it appears AII have pledged all of its liquid assets to either creditors
(repo financing) or its U.S. subsidiaries (trust agreements).


Former Business Partner


AmTrust's former business partner in Italy, Trust Risk Group, has called Barry Zyskind
(AFSI's CEO)'s version of the dispute "'fantasy' and 'tricky words' to convince investors
that nothing was wrong."


Trust Risk Group's CEO, Antonio Somma did not stop there though -- he also enquired
with UK and Italian insurance regulators about the solvency of AmTrust. Given his
knowledge of the Italian Med Mal space and policies issued by AEL, he likely know more
about AEL's reserve position and prospects than most.


In addition, the legal proceedings in the UK and pending arbitration in Italy may pose a
risk to AFSI's capital position.


Conclusion:


Questions have swirled around AFSI's accounting practices and capital adequacy for at
least two years now.
