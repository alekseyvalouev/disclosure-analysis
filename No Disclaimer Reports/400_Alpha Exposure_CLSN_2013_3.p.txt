Celsion's Coming Dilution: 600% Dilution In Past 5 Years Is Not
Enough

Since we began publishing on Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN), we have highlighted
the difference between the hype Celsion has been selling investors and the stark reality of
their failed business. Even at $1.36/share (approximately 19% below the stock's price at
the time of our first report), we continue to believe Celsion is a compelling short with
nearly 50% downside from current levels to our unchanged target price of $0.73 per
share. In fact, Celsion's recent actions make us even more confident, and we wanted to
highlight them to investors.


Failing Celsion Continues to Mislead Investors


No one can deny that Celsion is in dire straits. Its share price languishes near 5-year lows.
Its main drug, ThermoDox, failed its pivotal phase 3 trial (here) and has no hope of near-
term regulatory approval. Celsion has no other late-stage products in the pipeline. Celsion
is also losing about $4 million to $5 million in operating income per quarter, which closely
approximates cash spend, as can be seen here in their first quarter results. The Company
is likely to burn through its $45 million of net cash rather quickly. On a per share basis,
Celsion is burning $0.07 to $0.08 of cash per quarter against a starting balance of only
$0.73 per share of cash net of debt.


As a result, Celsion has relied on heavily dilutive stock issuances to keep it afloat. Dilution
seems to be part of the Company's DNA as the share count has increased by 600% over
the past five year. Indeed, just this year since ThermoDox failed, Celsion has more than
doubled its share count, and it still needs to raise additional funds. The best way to
continue to do that is to sell hype, and we believe disparity between Celsion's latest filings
and press releases underscore just how desperate the Company is.


Faking The Good News


Celsion wants investors to believe that the prospects for ThermoDox are exciting,
particularly in China. On July 19th, Celsion touted in a press release that the Company
had signed a memorandum of understanding for future development of ThermoDox with
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, found here.

We read the press release multiple times and think it's just recycled news. While it is clear
that Celsion wants investors to believe this is a material positive development for the
Company, the truth is that significant portions of the press release were copied verbatim
from an old press release more than a year before on May 7, 2012, as seen here.


Whether or not the press release contained any substance or was even new, it did the
trick and Celsion's shares jumped from $1.22 to $1.42.


We think the PR is basically just meaningless hype. We know this because Celsion never
filed an 8-K for the press release or included a copy of the memorandum as an exhibit.
The SEC mandates that an 8-K be filed for "material definitive agreements entered into by
a company that are not made in the ordinary course of business," as per this SEC
document description found here.


CLSN has filed 8-Ks for every other transaction that was material. The fact that Celsion
did not file an 8-K proves this memorandum of understanding does not cross the threshold
for materiality. Why not? Because Celsion already filed an 8-K with the original press
release here more than a year ago.


We've seen these shenanigans before and it is never positive for shareholders. We
reported a similar situation by a speculative, hype-filled company called Uni-Pixel
(NASDAQ:UNXL) with regard to its manufacturing and supply agreement with Eastman
Kodak, as seen here. Since we reported on this, the shares of Uni-Pixel are down about
45%. We expect a similar result with Celsion.


Hiding The Bad News

While Celsion is touting irrelevant old news as being positive, the Company is hiding the
bad news from investors by filing 8-Ks without putting out corresponding press releases!
On July 22, Celsion quietly released an 8-K announcing approval for a reverse stock split,
found here. The reverse split could be anywhere from 2-for-1 or 9-for-2, as seen here. Any
investor should know that reverse stock splits are typically only done by desperate
companies under significant duress.


More importantly, as part of the reverse stock split, Celsion will increase the number of
shares the Company is authorized to sell from just 240k shares to anywhere from 34
million to 57 million more shares of stock!


The reverse split will allow Celsion to double or even quadruple the share count through
additional share issuances! As if 600% dilution over the past five years wasn't enough, the
Company's preparing to dilute shareholders by up to 4x all over again. Put another way, a
shareholder from five years ago might have as little as 4% of his original ownership stake
in the Company once it's done with this next round of dilution.


Now we know why Celsion issued the press release from July 19th: to pump up the stock
price and excite investors with breathlessly positive press releases that have no
substance behind them so Celsion can distract them from the real news - its intention to
sell shares in the future and further dilute shareholders.


Clear Bad Intentions


Celsion's intentions are crystal clear. Celsion is doing the reverse split solely to enable it to
raise more money.


Don't trust a company like Celsion. Its main drug does not work and has no near-term
hope. The management team is trying to raise money to keep their jobs at the expense of
shareholders. We repeat our $0.73 per share price target.
