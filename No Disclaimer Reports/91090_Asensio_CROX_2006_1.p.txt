Crocs insiders dump a whole


lot of croc on the public.


On February 9, 2006 Crocs Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX, $23.85) sold


11,385,000 shares to the public in an initial public o�ering


(“IPO”). The story was that CROX’s growth is just beginning,


and the company needed the money. Well, if that’s the case


why did insiders dump 6,435,000 of the 11,385,000 that were


sold to the public? After all, none of the money from the


insider stock sales went to the company and who better than


the insiders, who relatively recently bought their shares


anyway, to know what the future is likely to bring? This is a


very tricky question, particularly in the case of CROX with its


next to nil track record and a future that could easily entirely


disappear in a whi�.


According to the IPO prospectus CROX “began marketing


and distributing in the U.S., under the Crocs brand, a


footwear model that was manufactured by Foam Creations”


in November 2002 and then purchased Foam Creations in


June 2004 for $5.2 million and the assumption of $1.7 million


in debt. In order to raise the money to buy Foam Creations


and fund operations before the IPO, CROX sold 33,322,247


shares of its stock for an average price of $0.11 per share


from November 2002 to December 2005. It is no wonder


that about 120 investors who bought CROX stock before the


IPO sold 6,435,000 of their shares in the IPO. CROX actually


sold less shares than the insiders. In the IPO CROX only sold

4,950,000 shares. Many of the same shares sold to the public


at $21.00 per share by insiders were only recently purchased


by insiders at $0.11 per share.


This funky IPO, and CROX’s highly questionable market


valuation of approximately $899 million, is only part of what


makes CROX a croc of a stock.


CROX calls the plastic that it uses to manufacture its shoes


“croslit” and calls croslite “proprietary.” CROX claims that


protecting the croslite manufacturing process is important to


their business value and states in the IPO prospectus that


they “consider the formulation of croslite used to produce


our products to be a valuable trade secret.” Yet, even though


croslite is consistently referred to as proprietary, CROX


admits in the IPO prospectus that “Neither we nor Foam


Creations have attempted to seek patent protection for the


formula.”


Contrary to CROX’s double speak, Crocs are not


manufactured out of any proprietary materials, the style is


not new or unique, and identical shoes are widely available


at much cheaper price points and enjoy much larger


distribution channels than CROX. In fact, Target, Payless,


Shoeline.com, OldFriendSlipper.com, and Nordstrom’s all


carry shoes identical to Crocs, most at $9.99 a pair, which is


a substantial discount to CROX’s $29.99-$39.99 price range.


So similar is a version that sells at Nordstrom’s for $9.99,


that the shoes are marketed under the brand name


“Gators.”


Footwear News named CROX the brand of the year in 2005


but recently began questioning whether CROX “will beat


back the spate of knocko�s swamping the market.” Investors


who are buying CROX stock at $23.85, and therefore paying


almost $900 million for CROX’s fad business, can not a�ord


even the slightest hiccup much less a swamping of the


market.

CROX �led a lawsuit in January 2005 against Holey Soles


Holdings Ltd. in the Federal Court of Canada. CROX states


that “the complaint alleges trademark and copyright


infringement relating to the design of some of their shoe


models. We believe that we own all copyrights associated


with our Beach footwear model.” It is interesting that CROX


chose to qualify its claim to have rights with the word


“believe.” CROX can believe anything it wants, but its Holey


Soles adventure boomeranged.


In August 2005, CROX disclosed that “Holey Soles �led a


lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the


Southern District of New York. Holey Soles seeks a


declaratory judgment that we (CROX) do not have any valid


copyright or trade dress rights with respect to the design of


our footwear.” So, now it is CROX and all of its ludicrous


ownership claims that are on the defense.


It is interesting to note that CROX chose to sue Holey Soles


when they could have just as easily sued Target, Payless,


ShoeLine.com, OldFriendSlippers.com, or Nordstrom’s as


they all carry shoes identical to the CROX brand of products


and have much larger pro�les, and distribution than the


Holey Soles products.


We have to wonder how many investors that are willing to


pay $23.85 per share


for CROX have actually seen a pair of Crocs and those


available at www.oldfriendslipper.com, www.target.com,


www.payless.com, and www.Shoeline.com. It may well be


that the Crocs fad will last a little longer, and perhaps even


grow a lot more this year. But what is certain is that CROX’s


stock is grossly overvalued even if CROX’s operating


management, which has no prior experience with shoe


ventures, fashion or branding, is successful beyond their


wildest dreams. In fact, insiders eagerness to sell at the IPO


is indicative that their wildest dreams about the company


have been ful�lled.

As a point of comparison, it is also interesting to note that


CROX’s market capitalization is only slightly less than that of


K-Swiss, Inc.(NASDAQ: KSWS, $29.71) and Skechers, U.S.A.


Inc.(NYSE: SKX, $23.60), even though KSWS and SKX have


diversi�ed product lines and KSWS had sales of


approximately $508 million in 2005 and SKX had just over $1


Billion in sales in 2005. CROX had sales of $108.6 million in


2005.


CROX also has a larger market value than Deckers Outdoor


Corporation (NASDAQ: DECK, $38.38), which manufactures


and markets the highly-successful UGG boots that retail


from about $80 to $220 and have been hot for two years, as


well as the Teva outdoor lifestyle line which includes running


shoes and sandals that retail between $50-$90. CROX’s


market value is almost twice that of DECK’s market


capitalization, which approaches $500 million. DECK had


sales of about $264 million in 2005.


After a thorough analysis of the CROX brand name and


product, investors may want to sidestep buying in to the


stock hype this shoe manufacturer has created and pro�ted


from by selling insider stock to the public while telling


investors its stock isn’t ugly.
