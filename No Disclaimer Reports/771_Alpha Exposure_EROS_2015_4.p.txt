Eros: Revising Our TopCo Analysis

Summary


We made an error in our TopCo analysis of Eros and EIML. This does not negate
any of the other damning questions that remain unanswered.


Eros reported another quarter of negative free cash flow as well as increasing trade
and other receivables.


We have written a letter to the enforcement division of the SEC. A link to it is
provided in this article.


Eros International Plc (NYSE: EROS) ("Eros") reported its second quarter results on
November 17th, 2015. Following the release of its earnings, the company held a
conference call. Notably, Eros did not take any questions from investors and only took
questions from two sell-side analysts, one with Macquarie Capital and one with Wells
Fargo. Both of these companies were Joint Book-Running Managers on the latest Eros
International Plc's stock offering (Source). Furthermore, yet again, Eros reported negative
free cash flow as well as increasing trade and other receivables. Trade and other
receivables were $225.5 million at the end of Q2 2016 vs. $216.6 million at the end of Q1
2016. We continue to believe that the company is a scam and that the equity is worthless.


We are revising our analysis on Eros International Media Limited ("EIML"), the publicly
listed Indian subsidiary, relative to Eros International Plc, its holding company parent. We
defined "TopCo" as the entities that belonged solely to Eros and not to EIML. As can be
seen in the red box in the below organizational chart:

We made the mistake of including in our calculations the various inter-party transactions
that arise between EIML and TopCo under the relationship agreement. The inclusion of
these related party transactions caused our analysis to understate TopCo's revenue as
these transactions are eliminated at the parent-level. Excluding these related party
transactions, TopCo's revenue would be as follows:

Nonetheless, TopCo's days sales outstanding would still increase at a troubling pace if we
exclude these related party transactions as well as the related party trade balances.


In our third article, we estimated Eros' theatrical revenues based on the 132 films the
company claims to have released in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 in its 20-F filed with the
SEC (Source, see page 34). Since then, the company quietly added two films to the list,
Action Jackson in fiscal year 2015 and Siva Senai in fiscal year 2014 (Source, see latest
releases tab). Fortunately, we saved the movie list using WaybackMachine should the
company attempt to manipulate the films listed after we released our third Seeking Alpha
article (Source, see latest releases tab). We have shown the late addition of Action
Jackson below as an example.


Despite adding these two movies, we are still unable to come close to the company's
reported theatrical revenues based on the 134 films. Furthermore, we still believe revenue
from television syndication and digital and ancillary sources are even more egregiously
overstated based on industry comparables.

The red flags that we originally identified continue to exist. Investors should be concerned.
A brief review of these red flags includes:


Movie Count - The company provided a list of 64 and 68 movies for fiscal 2015 and
2014, respectively. Following our remark that the company was two movies short of its
reported numbers, two movies were added without notice. 26% of these films were
theatrically released prior to the fiscal year indicated.
Revenue - Based on publicly available sources, we believe theatrical revenue is
overstated by 95% and 49% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have now
included Action Jackson and Siva Senai in our theatrical revenue estimates as the
Company added these two films to their movie list subsequent to our third Seeking
Alpha article.
Revenue - The company's reported Television Syndication and Digital & Ancillary
revenues imply a 38-42% market share in fiscal year 2015. This is a far cry from the
20% implied box office gross market share based on their reported theatrical revenues
and the single-digit market share based on their theatrical gross box office according
to third-party sources.
Aggressive Accounting - The company changed its amortization period from 5 years
to 10 years which inflated operating profit by 176% during fiscal 2015. DSOs have
steadily increased from 139 days in fiscal 2012 to 277 days in fiscal 2015.
Capital spending - There has been no credible explanation for the $113 million
increase in capital spending during fiscal 2015. The additional information provided by
the company today, namely that 26% of the films that they purchased were purchased
post-theatrical release, makes the $276 million in investment during fiscal 2015 even
more incredulous.
CFO resignations - The CFO of Eros PLC resigned May 2015 and the CFO of Eros
International Media resigned November 2014.
Subsidiaries -The foreign subsidiaries are fueling the revenue growth, but the
reported revenues are not being collected, resulting in massive growth in receivables.
At one subsidiary, this receivable increase surpasses revenues for the period, an
accounting impossibility. More than 100% of revenue growth in fiscal year 2015 is
being earned in the UAE.
Auditor - The company hides behind Grant Thornton India LLP as the auditor.
However, Eros employs a local Indian auditor with only a few employees and no visible
website that uses a gmail email address. This very small accounting firm has audited
at least 9 subsidiaries in places as disparate as Mumbai, BVI, Mauritius, Singapore,
and the Isle of Man. The auditor recently resigned for at least one of these
subsidiaries.
