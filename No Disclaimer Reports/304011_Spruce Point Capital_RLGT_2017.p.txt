Executive Summary
4


Spruce Point Is Short Radiant Logistics 
And Sees 30% - 50% Downside


Similar to Echo, Radiant Is A Non-Accretive Roll-Up Strategy In The 3rd Party Logistics Space Showing Strains


• Radiant has completed 16 acquisitions since 2006 and has not demonstrated any cumulative net cash flow, a key measure of success


• Its largest acquisition of Wheels in 2015, has failed to hit expectations, and exposed Radiant to the transportation brokerage market, an 


area coming under extreme margin pressure from new technology entrants. Radiant levered up and diluted shareholders meaningfully


• Radiant’s GAAP / Non-GAAP financials are diverging at an alarming rate and it recently announced “organizational changes” (Warning: 


it had to hire a “Chief Commercial Officer” and its COO resigned) while suspending Sales and EPS guidance to investors for FY 2017


Questionable Management History Tarnished By Previous Accounting Scandal


• Radiant’s CEO Bohn Crain and first General Counsel Cohen were executives at Stonepath Group (AMEX: SRG / OTCBB SGRZ), which 


crumbled when it admitted financial and accounting irregularities tied to revenue overstatement / expense understatement. An SEC


inquiry commenced, allegations of fraud were made, and Stonepath was delisted, and faded to the pink sheets and insolvency


• Later, with a “reverse merger” from the shell of “Golf Two, Inc” the duo launched Radiant Logistics on the bulletin board in 2005


• The SEC has already questioned Radiant’s accounting, and it has made the scary disclosure that its margin method, “Generally results 


in recognition of revenues and purchased transportation costs earlier than the preferred methods under GAAP which does not recognize 


revenue until a proof of delivery is received or which recognizes revenue as progress on the transit is made.”


• Don’t expect Radiant’s minor league auditor named Peterson Sullivan to spot problems, Radiant pays them minuscule audit fees and


three Peterson employees (2 partners) have been cited in less than two years for professional misconduct by the PCAOB and SEC


Unattractive Capital Structure and Unfavorable Shareholder Policies


• Radiant’s expensive 9.75% perpetual preferred stock sucks cash flow from common shareholders; the Company will likely have to use 


its existing shelf registration to dilute shareholders again when the preferred first becomes callable at the end of 2018


• Radiant has a history of irrational dilution; eg. in July 2015 to pay down its credit facility costing just 3.5%, clearly its equity is cheaper!


• Radiant announced a 5m share buyback in Jan 2016, yet has repurchased just 91k shares. It could have bought back all the stock it 


wanted at $3/share or less but it didn’t – shareholders should be asking why?


• Key insiders have been selling. Notably, Radiant’s second largest shareholder / original executive Cohen sold all his shares in 2015 and 


now hides his association from Radiant on his biography. The Company’s new COO also sold his entire shares 1yr after joining


Unattractive Valuation And Limited Reason To Own The Stock


• With shares up nearly 85% in the past year, investors seem blinded to the fact that is recent cash flow is declining 20% YoY


• The market is expecting virtually no revenue growth from Radiant and has failed to take a close forensic look at the Company to identify 


issues that suggest further strain lies ahead. However, Radiant trades at an irrational premium to logistics peers


• We suggest valuing it on free cash flow multiple, which at a 18-24x would be worth approx. $3.00-$4.30/sh, implying 30-50% downside


We previously laid out our short on Echo Global Logistics (Nasdaq: ECHO) in Aug 2016, a highly promoted, but poor performing 


roll-up in the 3rd party logistics (3PL) sector. The share price has fallen by up to 30%. Spruce Point believes that Radiant Logistics 


(NYSE/MKT: RLGT), another 3PL roll-up story, is an even worse investment and much weaker company.

Management’s Questionable History

Questionable Background of Bohn Crain, 
Radiant’s CEO/Founder


Prior to starting Radiant Logistics in 2006, Bohn Crain was the EVP and CFO of Stonepath Group (AMEX: STG / 


OTCBB: SGRZ) from 2001-2004, a publicly traded logistics roll-up that failed spectacularly during his leadership


9/20/04: Stonepath Group Announces Intention to Restate 2003 and Q1-Q2 2004 Financial Statements


• Stonepath determined that it had understated its accrued purchased transportation liability and related costs of purchased transportation; it relied on 


trend analysis to estimate its costs of purchased transportation


• The Company concluded that the process did not accurately account for the differences between the estimates and the actual freight costs incurred. 


This allowed for the accumulation of previously unidentified costs of purchased transportation and an under reported liability for the accrued costs of 


purchased transportation.


• CEO Pelino seemed to back Crain: "The Company has also restructured its financial organization to have the senior financial staff of its Domestic 


Services and International Services operations report directly to Bohn Crain, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.”


11/17/04: Two Months Later, Bohn Crain Abruptly Resigns and Significantly More Financial Accounting Issues Emerge


• Revenue Overstatement: In the course of its review of the under accrual of purchased transportation costs, the Company also identified two revenue 


recognition errors within its Domestic Services which caused the Company to overstate its revenues by approximately $1.1 million during the first two 


quarters of 2004


• Net Income Overstatement: The Company also expects to report an additional $3,600,000 reduction in net income for the income tax effects of the 


estimated adjustments discussed above. These adjustments primarily affect the fourth quarter of 2003. At that time, a $3,000,000 adjustment was 


recorded representing a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the reporting of a deferred tax asset.


• Restructuring and Guidance: Stonepath implements a restructuring and a material charge is expected to negatively impact Q4’14 results. 


Stonepath decided to withdraw EBITDA and EPS guidance for 2004 and 2005


1/6/05: 10-Q Filing Reveals SEC Inquiry and Numerous Lawsuits


• SEC Inquiry: SEC conducted an informal inquiry to determine whether certain provisions of the federal securities laws have been violated in 


connection with the Company’s accounting and financial reporting. The SEC requested information relative to the restatement amounts, personnel at 


the Air Plus subsidiary and Stonepath Group, Inc. and additional background information from October 5, 2001 to December 2, 2004.


• Lawsuits: Crain and other executives named in 8 lawsuits alleging fraud, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets among other things


2/25/05: Amended 10-Q Reveals Even More Financial Errors During Bohn’s CFO Tenure


• Revenue Overstatement: 1) the Company identified a billing error in which the operating unit was invoicing one of its automotive customers at rates 


which had been approved by a customer representative who did not have the authority to do so; 2) Upon billing to a customer for certain capital 


equipment purchased in connection with the launch of a new distribution center for that customer, the unit recognized the revenue immediately rather 


than over the two-year life of the contract


• Expense Recognition: 1) Claims expenses from Q1’14 were shifted to and recognized in Q4’14, 2) Depreciation associated with the capital 


equipment mentioned above was depreciated over its useful life, rather than matching it to the life of the contract

Background on Stephen Cohen,  
Radiant’s First Executive and Board Member


Stephen M. Cohen was Radiant’s first General Counsel and Board member starting in 2005. He recently sold all his 


sizeable share holdings in 2015, and has removed his association with Radiant


• From 2000 - 2004, Mr. Cohen served as senior vice president, general counsel and secretary of Stonepath Group. Mr. Cohen’s 


tenure at Stonepath overlapped with Bohn Crain’s, during the period of financial misstatements and failure of Stonepath


• Mr. Cohen joined Radiant in Oct. 2005. He took no salary as part-time counsel, but received payments to his firm SCM Capital 


Advisers for legal and consulting services. He also owned 2.5m shares or 7.4% of Radiant according to early company filings


• Cohen started exiting his shares in July 2015 through a secondary issuance and as of the last proxy filed 10/6/15 has fully 


exited. The sale of the shares came notably after Radiant’s highly promoted Wheels acquisition early in the year


• Mr. Cohen is now partner at Fox Rothschild, and is the co-chair of the firm’s Public Companies Practice. Radiant used Fox 


Rothschild as its M&A legal advisor for the Wheels transaction, and as its securities lawyer in the transaction Cohen sold shares


Stephen M. Cohen Biography At Fox Rothschild


Despite acting as Radiant’s 


first General Counsel and 


Board Secretary, along with 


continuing to act as outside 


counsel through 2015, Cohen 


now omits any ties to 


Radiant, yet mentions 


Stonepath which failed

period. Has repurchased $50m of shares at 


above market prices


Radiant failed to buyback stock at $3/sh when it announced a 
buyback. It has issued expensive equity to pay back debt and 


saddled shareholders with an expensive preferred stock


Evidence of Overly 
Optimistic Stock Promotion


Has used an army of more than a dozen stock 
promoters that recently suggested stock was worth 


close to $30/sh


Has had difficulty attracting and retaining stock promoters, 
but a few have suggested its stock is worth $10/sh


Radiant bears striking resemblance to Echo Global Logistics, a company we were early to identify as a short. 


In our opinion, Radiant is a significantly worse investment opportunity and weaker company.

Spruce Point believes that evaluating a company’s long-term accounts receivables vs. sales growth is a reliable 


indicator to identify potential financial misstatement. Both financial metrics should track each other closely. ECHO and 


RLGT were founded in 2005 as asset-light logistics roll-up stories, and make for excellent comparisons. It’s evident 


from the charts below that Radiant’s financials have deviated meaningfully over time, and very significantly post 2015. 


We’re warning that Radiant’s 


recent financial performance 


and cash flow generation 


post the 2015 acquisition of 


Wheels should be viewed 


skeptically.

Strong Evidence Suggesting 
Financial Irregularities


The SEC weighed in years ago about Radiant’s revenue and expense recognition and warned that it was Non-GAAP.


The Company has ever since claimed its aggressive methods are “immaterial” – can this be trusted? Recall that bad 


“estimates” got Crain’s last company Stonepath Group in trouble


Source: SEC Comment Letter 7/16/09


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all 


material respects, the financial position of Radiant Logistics, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 


2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in 


conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our 


opinion, Radiant Logistics, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over 


financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—


Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial 


statements, the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update Number 2015-03, Interest-


Imputation of Interest, and Accounting Standards Update Number 2015-17, Income Taxes.

How Can Radiant’s Auditor Claim Its Financials Are In 


Conformity With U.S. GAAP?


SEC Comment Letter 


Slams Radiant’s Accounting


RLGT Warns About Its Accounting, Insists Immaterial Differences


As a non-asset based carrier, we do not generally own transportation assets. We do, however, 


own certain trailers and refrigerated trailers that we use in our business. We generate the majority 


of our air and ocean freight forwarding and freight brokerage revenues by purchasing 


transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to our 


customers. Based upon the terms in the contract of carriage, freight forwarding revenues related 


to shipments where we issue a House Airway Bill or a House Ocean Bill of Lading are recognized 


at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin. Costs related to the shipments are 


also recognized at this same time based upon anticipated margins, contractual arrangements with 


direct carriers, and other known factors. The estimates are routinely monitored and compared to 


actual invoiced costs. The estimates are adjusted as deemed necessary by us to reflect 


differences between the original accruals and actual costs of purchased transportation. This 


method generally results in recognition of revenues and purchased transportation costs 


earlier than the preferred methods under GAAP which do not recognize revenue until a 


proof of delivery is received or which recognize revenue as progress on the transit is made. 


Our method of revenue and cost recognition does not result in a material difference from 


amounts that would be reported under such other methods.

Growing GAAP v. Non-GAAP Disparity


Radiant’s Widening EBITDA vs. Adjusted EBITDA Radiant’s Widening GAAP / Non-GAAP EPS


Spruce Point warns that companies undergoing financial stress often times show an escalating divergence between 


GAAP and Non-GAAP figures. We observed this sign recently with out short recommendation on Echo Global. As can 


be seen from the charts below, Radiant’s Non-GAAP financials really started diverging heavily in 2016, a year after it 


acquired Wheels Group.

Radiant’s Largest Deal To Acquire 
Wheels Group Seems A Disappointment


Radiant (including Wheels) Has Generally 


Disappointed Expectations, Coming In At The Low End


Radiant Promoted Wheels As A New Platform To Reach 


The Brokerage Market To Complement Forwarding


Source: Deal Presentation, Jan 23, 2015


Note: Radiant’s deal press on Jan 20, 2015 said it expected $750m of revenues, thus 


it revised up its expectations


In January 2015, Radiant announced its largest acquisition on Wheels Group for ~$76m, a Canadian venture company 


(formed as a reverse takeover and logistics roll-up) that served both the US and Canadian markets (50/50%) with brokerage 


and contract logistics services. Radiant levered its balance sheet to 2.5x Debt/16E EBITDA and diluted existing 


shareholders by issuing 6.9m shares to Wheels owners. Radiant then issued a further 6m shares in July 15 to pay down 


debt. In our opinion, much like Echo acquired Command Transportation (May 2015) at the peak of the brokerage market, 


Radiant’s acquisition of Wheels also exposed it to the brokerage market near the peak and was ill-timed.


Actual Results


Revenues: $782.5


Adj EBITDA: $24.4

Unusual Margin Expansion In Brokerage


Source: Radiant Segment Financials 


Note: Fiscal year June 30th


Radiant suspended offering annual and quarterly guidance in Q4’2016 citing the uncertain brokerage market and 


excess capacity in truckload and intermodal. Yet, somehow Radiant has been able to improve margins in this segment 


while others in the industry cite margin compression. The only explanation cited by Radiant is “lower purchased 


transportation costs” – if true, how much longer can these benefits last.

In pushing Radiant’s stock up almost 85% in the past year, investors have narrowly focused on the Company’s 


highly Adjusted EBITDA and EPS, while ignoring its anemic top line growth, and plunging operating cash flow. We 


don’t believe Radiant’s recent performance is sustainable, as its comparisons become significantly more difficult in 


the next few quarters to show growth, while its end markets struggle with excess capacity and limited visibility. 


Cash flow will become increasing important as 2018 approaches and its credit facility matures.

Payouts To Partners Falling


If our strategic operating partners fail to maintain adequate reserves against unpaid customer invoices, or if we are unable to offset against commissions earned 


and payable by us to our strategic operating partners for unpaid customer invoices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.


We derive a substantial portion of our revenue pursuant to agreements with independently-owned strategic operating partners operating under our various brands. Under 


these agreements, each individual strategic operating partner office is responsible for some or all of the bad debt expense related to the underlying customers being serviced 


by the strategic operating partner.    (RLGT 10-K, p. 9)

RLGT’s bad debt is surging, and is a function of its strategic operating partner arrangements as noted in the 


Company’s Risk Factor below. We observe that Radiant’s commission payout to its operating partners has been 


declining. While this may have a short-term benefit to earnings, its long-term effect is reasonably quite bad since  


operating partners can generally terminate their agreements with Radiant at any point.

Spruce Point has successfully argued that the best way to evaluate serial acquirers is to look at free cash flow after 


acquisition costs. It is a particularly useful metric when evaluating asset-light industries where acquisitions consist 


mostly of people and relationships vs. PP&E. Radiant’s operating cash flows must be adjusted for its fixed 9.75% 


preferred payments (effectively debt-like interest costs) and payments to minority holders that flow through the 


financing section. We find that Radiant has burned a total of $51m in its lifetime – no evidence it has added any value.

New Technology and Competition Will 
Significantly Handicap Radiant 


Spruce Point was early to identify the effect that peer-to-peer technologies and big data would have on the old school 


3PL industry when we exposed ECHO and its technology “hype” - especially now that UBER Freight and Amazon 


Logistics are becoming a reality, margins for transportation brokerage are compressing. In our opinion, marginal 3PLs 


such as Radiant with scant technology spend stand little chance against well-funded start-ups and larger competitors.

Technology Spend For Asset-Light 3PLs


Like most 3PL’s Radiant boasts that its competitive strength is its technology. However, both Spruce Point and Radiant, warns that for serial 


acquisitive accompanies, the challenge of integrating various technology and IT systems can present major issues. Radiant goes so far as to add the 


following risk factor: “Our management information and financial reporting systems are spread across diverse platforms and geographies, and we 


depend on information provided by strategic operating partners and acquired companies, not all of which have systems that are compatible with ours.”

Auditor Concerns


Radiant is based in Washington state but boasts its national presence and that it should be treated and valued as if it 


were a recognized industry player. It has chosen a local auditor, Peterson Sullivan, to validate its financials. Peterson 


represents many speculative penny stocks and has recently been cited multiple times by the PCAOB for deficiencies 


in testing revenues – the most basic element of an audit! Ironically, Peterson does not list either transportation or 


logistics as one of its industry specialties on its website and charges Radiant a negligible audit fee. (1)

Radiant’s Mystery Engagement Partner

Under rules adopted by the PCAOB in December 2015, registered audit firms are required to submit Form AP, 


Auditor Reporting of Certain Audit Participants, to disclose the names of engagement partners and other 


accounting firms that participated in audits of public companies. We note that Radiant has failed to report its 


audit partner – is the mystery partner one of the recently sanctioned partners?

Promoter View of Radiant Logistics
vs. Spruce Point View


Stock Promoter View


• Growth opportunities through accretive acquisitions - Radiant has 


grown through acquisitions and plans to continue its strategy. 


Acquisitions are quickly accretive as it targets generally small agent 


based forwarding businesses that are generating ~$1M to $3M in 


annual EBITDA and pays 4x-5x TTM EBITDA.  Increase in its 


network size should improve economies of scale 


• Proprietary IT system should enhance operational efficiency - As 


competition in the industry increases, the demand for industry 


specific IT solutions will. Radiant has already set up a scalable IT 


platform which is SAP (NYSE: SAP) based.  Consequently, the 


Company has a competitive advantage vs. smaller competitor


Spruce Point View


• There’s hardly much evidence to suggest that Radiant has been a 


successful roll-up after a decade in existence. It has not generated 


any positive free cash flow after capex, preferred dividends, and 


deal costs. It is getting harder for Radiant to find small acquisitions 


and pay just 4-5x, and the Company’s own valuation of 11.4x 


unjustly rewards it for having created little value


• All 3PL companies say they have a “proprietary” tech. systems that 


gives competitive advantages. The reality is that Radiant’s small 


size and $3m technology spend is dwarfed by its public peers and 


new, well-funded, start-ups that have raised significant capital to 


invest in the next generation of logistics solutions


• A promotional statement which compares a $300m company vs. 


$11bn diversified giant. The reality is Radiant has failed to capture the 


same level of institutional support in 10yrs, and will likely never scale


• Unfortunately, it has also exposed Wheels to the truck brokerage 


market at exactly the wrong time – when margins have compressed 


and visibility has vanished. The deal came at a punitive cost to 


investors, and now Radiant’s financials are indicating strain


• Radiant has admitted that its recognition of revenues and expenses 


don’t conform to GAAP and are aggressive. We suggest looking at 


operating cash flow instead. Last quarter’s operating cash flow margin 


was just 6.0% near its lowest level in 7 quarters


• We’ve demonstrated the acquisition model doesn’t work, and modeling 


out a business to 2018 with no visibility is a challenge. Peers on avg 


trade at 8-10x EBITDA and 18-24x FCF, but Radiant trades at an 


irrational premium. By assuming a peer range it’s easy to see 30% -


50% downside


• Radiant is the next stock juggernaut like XPO Logistics circa 2012. 


Founded in October 2005. Bohn Crain (founder and CEO) has 


quietly been building an XPO-like company, but without the fanfare 


• The recent acquisition of the Wheels Group, Inc. (the company’s 


11th and largest acquisition) significantly expands Radiant’s scale, 


density, and service offerings and provides the platform for 


continued/accelerated growth in both the US and Canada.


• Expanding margins should follow: Using this calculation of EBITDA 


to net revenues, adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded from 


2.6% in F08 to 14.4% in F16


• Stonegate Securities (May 2017): Our acquisition analysis 


framework (trying to capture the acquisition model), applied to our 


F18 adjusted EBITDA estimate arrives at a valuation range of ~$7.50 


to ~$9.50 with a midpoint of ~$8.50.
28


Radiant’s Overvaluation To Peers Evident


Radiant trades at an undeserved premium to its peers and has sub-standard revenue growth. It is hard to justify an 


11.5x EV/2017E EBITDA multiple for Radiant being equal to Echo’s after we demonstrated it is an inferior roll-up.

We are highly skeptical of RLGT’s 
“Normalized” EBITDA being sold to value 
the Company given the rapid decline in 


sales and cash flow. For example, we 
don’t believe investors should add-back 
recurring deal and “transition costs” for 
RLGT’s non-economic roll-up strategy. 


However, even giving the Company the 
benefit of the doubt, and using a peer 


market multiple range of 8-10x we would 
expect approx. 20% – 40% downside
