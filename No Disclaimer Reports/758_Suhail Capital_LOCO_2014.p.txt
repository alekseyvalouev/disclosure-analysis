El Pollo Loco: PE 'Bust-Out', 20+ Years Of Failed Domestic Expansion,
Pre-IPO Window Dressing Make An Ideal Short
Top Idea | Aug. 20, 2014 5:00 AM ET119 comments
by: Suhail Capital


Summary


More like a ‘Pollos Hermanos’ than the Chipotle media comparison it is currently
getting.


20+ years of failed domestic expansion track record.


Two-year comp momentum is largely average check growth driven, and thus should
be heavily discounted.


Existing equity holders will be very motivated sellers at lockup expiry.


There should be ZERO bid for this stock anywhere north of $20.

Summary


I. Background & Introduction


source: El Pollo Loco website


Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975. After
expanding in Mexico the first US location opened in 1980 in Los Angeles, California. This
is when the journey of the publicly-listed El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) we see trading
as "LOCO" today began. After achieving notable success in the LA market, in 1983 the
US restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN). Juan Francisco
Ochoa and family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico (he went on to set
up a taco chain in Texas called 'Taco Palenque' and the 'Palenque Grill', both serving
Mexican cuisine with recipes similar to El Pollo Loco). American Securities Capital
Partners (ASCP) acquired El Pollo Loco in 1999 and sold it to current majority owner
Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005.


This brings us to the fanfare surrounding July 25th, 2014, the first trading day for El Pollo
Loco. On the first trading day the stock opened at $19 (from an IPO price of $15) and
closed near the day's high at $24. This prompted articles touting El Pollo Loco as "the

latest quick service/fast casual chain to emulate Chipotle's rapid growth." As you will see
later, this couldn't be further from the truth. The next 5 days of trading in El Pollo Loco
were truly epic in what appeared to be a high frequency trading game of hot potato,
combined with mini short-squeezes, combined with day traders gone mad. We think the
below charts and tables sufficiently convey the 'Loco-ness' of it all:

II. The Next Chipotle? Not even Close!


When El Pollo Loco filed to go public, we took a look at the chain knowing full well that any
Mexican-themed restaurant chain going public would draw surface comparisons to
Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). We figured that with Chipotle's recent operating and share price
momentum that this IPO might actually attract the momentum fast-money crowd that
eventually creates a good short regardless of the underlying business involved (much like
Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) during the SAAS euphoria in Q4 2013). What we
concluded after just one day's worth of research and analysis was that a deeper dive on
the name was not justified as there was NO WAY the market would buy this story, and this
is coming from individuals who are rarely surprised by just how stupid the market can be
at times. This is because even the most cursory look at El Pollo Loco leads one to
conclude this company has no business being compared to any restaurant chain growth
story, let alone Chipotle. Yet here it is a few weeks after going public trading at a higher
multiple than Chipotle, and garnering the type of market media attention bestowed on
growth story darlings. So, let's take a closer look.


El Pollo Loco vs. Chipotle:


Chipotle Store Count End of 1999: 37 Stores All in Colorado


El Pollo Loco Store Count End of 1999: 278 Stores in 4 States (CA, NV, TX, AZ) with
85%+ Los Angeles.


Chipotle Store Count End of 2013: 1,572 Across 43 States and D.C. as well as 16
International Stores in Canada, England, France, and Germany.


El Pollo Loco Store Count End of 2013: 401 Stores in 5 States with 88% of Stores in
California


Here is a detailed snapshot of key metrics at these two companies over the last decade:

As you can see from a historical analysis standpoint, these two companies couldn't be
more different. The only thing they have in common is that they both offer Mexican-
themed cuisine.


Ahh, but this is the story of the past, this stock is trading on what the future will bring.
Surely this IPO opens the door to significant domestic and subsequently international
expansion.


We seriously doubt that.


III. A Long History of Failed Domestic Expansion


El Pollo Loco is not some new hot restaurant franchise on the verge of massive domestic
expansion. They have a long history of trying and failing to meaningfully grow their brand
outside of the Southwest United States or for that matter, the core Los Angeles market.


Here are some of the most recent failed attempts to expand geographically across the
United States:


Chicago: 4 stores starting in 2005, all closed by 2012


Colorado: 1 stores starting in 2006, closed by 2011


Connecticut: 1 store opened in 2006, closed in 2012


Georgia: 9 stores starting in 2007, all closed by 2011


Massachusetts: 2 stores starting in 2007, all closed by 2010


New Jersey: 1 store 2009, closed in 2010


Oregon: 2 stores starting in 2008, all closed by 2011


St. Louis: 1 store opened in 2009, closed by 2011


Virginia: 3 stores starting in 2008, all closed by 2011


Vancouver, WA: 1 store opened in 2008, closed in 2009


That's ten states entered and exited between 2005 and 2012!


Here is what management has had to say about this:

5/23/2018 El Pollo Loco: PE 'Bust-Out', 20+ Years Of Failed Domestic Expansion, Pre-IPO Window Dressing Make An Ideal Short - El Pollo Loco H…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


As of March 30, 2011, we had 14 system-wide restaurants open in markets east of
the Rockies. Additionally, three stores (two franchise locations and one company
location) were closed in 2010 and four stores located east of the Rockies (all
franchise locations) were closed in 2011 in these areas due to low sales. Our
restaurants open east of the Rockies are experiencing a wide range of sales
volumes, and a majority of them have sales volumes that are significantly less than
the chain average due to the lack of brand awareness in the new markets.


Now here is an excerpt from one of their East Coast franchisees on his experience:


"That style of Mexican grilled chicken is very, very regional," said Ed Doherty,
president and chief executive of Doherty Enterprises. It originally secured the rights
to open as many as 30 El Pollo Locos in New Jersey and New York, but the
company decided not to go further with the concept after sales in North Bergen were
less than what they had hoped. To expand the concept, Doherty said, his company
wanted to see sales of $40,000 to $45,000 a week at the North Bergen El Pollo
Loco. Instead, it was doing about $25,000 a week. After a fire at the store two years
ago, the company sold the location to a Wendy's, which is doing more than double
the sales volume.


"It wasn't the location," Doherty said. "Wendy's is doing great."


And keep in mind this is not the first time El Pollo Loco has had a tough go of it
geographically expanding. In the late 80s and early 90s there were failed forays into
Florida, North Carolina, Hawaii, and even Japan.


Suffice to say, El Pollo Loco's repeated struggles to expand geographically are very
difficult to ignore. While discounting some of the failure to multiple instances of poor
economic timing, it is still hard to fathom the uniform nature of the failure. This is not a
case of one or two markets failing to absorb 20 to 30 units, but rather about every single
market failing to accept the brand at all. We have no doubt that if In-N-Out Burger (a chain
which literally has the same exact Southwest regional presence as El Pollo Loco) opened
in these same markets that there would be lines out the door, and that those first couple of
stores in each new geography would literally mint money.


Clearly, El Pollo Loco, despite its near ubiquitous presence in the second-largest
American city, has not developed the commiserate brand identity. Banking on that
drastically changing after two decades' worth of irrefutable empirical evidence requires
nothing short of a tremendous blind leap of faith.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


Well, then what about those solid pre-IPO comps?


IV. Dissecting El Pollo Loco's Pre-IPO Comparable Same-Store Sales


Anyone who has ever invested in restaurant franchise stocks knows how hypersensitive
the names can be to short-term comp sales numbers. One need only look at the recent
collapses of Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN) and Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) for fresh
examples of what happens when you slightly disappoint in this area. Mature brands
trading at close to 2x EV/Sales can quickly turn into 1x or less EV/Sales stocks, and for
hyped younger growth stories the 20x+ EV/EBITDA is quickly replaced by something a lot
closer to a 10x multiple. Thus, with El Pollo Loco trading at north of 30x EV/EBITDA and
5x EV/Sales, one has to be quite cognizant of their recent comps and what's driving them.


This goes without saying for any restaurant stock trading at such levels, but is even more
relevant for one that just went public. This is because there is a tendency to window-dress
a company before an IPO by pulling short-term levers that are typically not sustainable
and/or not in the long-term interests of the business model. This window dressing is most
common in businesses that have been around for a while, and especially common in ones
that have been passed around by PE firms. That being said, once you get to our review of
the ownership/financial history of this brand, you will understand why we pulled out the
microscope to look at their pre-IPO numbers.


We imagine that when the JOBS Act was passed that the sponsors did not envision it
being used to limit disclosures by companies that have been in business for over 30
years. That's what you get with El Pollo Loco. A company that has nearly two decades'
worth of accessible financial information, only ends up needing to disclose the results from
the last three years. Luckily for us, a company that has incurred this level of indebtedness
often has registered securities that require regular filings with the SEC, and that is
precisely the case with the El Pollo Loco. Combine these filings with a failed 2006 IPO
prospectus and a recent note exchange offer that you can go through, and you end up
with all the data you need to paint a complete picture. With that in mind, any discerning
investor looking at the last two years of pre-IPO comps within the context of the chains
broader comp trends over the last 15 years is going to raise a red flag and ask some
questions.


El Pollo Loco's company owned same-store sales have averaged 7% growth over the last
two years. This is a huge deviation from the 1.4% average over the preceding 11 years,
and jumps off the page when you see that traffic attribution in the comps has been
trending closer to 2%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


Why does it jump off the page?


1. El Pollo Loco reported some of the worst comps in their peer group in the recession. In
2009, they ranked 47th out of 50 QSR chains for year-over-year same-store sales.
Their combined 2009/2010 performance puts them at virtually the bottom of the entire
QSR 50 list. When you are looking for comp sustainability, you are trained to be wary
of what might be unusually easy comparable periods or sudden swings that look like
one-off/macro rebound driven numbers.


2. El Pollo Loco's store base shrunk throughout the reported pre-IPO comp period (412
stores end of 2010 to 401 at the end of 2013); store closures remove underperforming
restaurants from the store comp base. This is good news for short-term comps, but
again not a sustainable positive trend one expects to be leveraged going forward.
Furthermore, it is an explicitly bad sign for a chain whose stock is being valued at the
highest end of the future growth expectation range.


3. Large average check count increases for a non-growing regionally concentrated chain
tend to imply price increases. This is notable as price hikes are by definition not a
sustainable comp driver and also come with their own potential down the road trade-off
as customers may gradually look elsewhere for value. Furthermore, in El Pollo Loco's
case, this phenomenon is accentuated by the fact that 80% of their revenue is derived
from one state, and even within California is largely weighted towards the city of Los
Angles (we estimate in the 65-70% range). If your core demographic is Hispanic-
Americans in Los Angeles, investors are even more likely to discount comp growth that
implies significant price driven average check growth.


Now, #1 and #2 above speak for themselves, it is #3 where investors in El Pollo Loco
have not surprisingly been left in the dark.


The below excerpt is from Chipotle's recent Q2 Conference Call:


Overall sales for the quarter increased 28.6% to $1.05 billion, driven by the comp
and from new restaurant openings. Year to date sales were $1.95 billion, an increase
of 26.6%, including a comp for the year so far of 15.5%. The quarter comp was
primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic, along with an increase in our
average check, which includes a 2.5% benefit from our menu price increase rolled
out during the quarter. Average check in the quarter was up about 5% from last year
with half of this increase coming from the menu price increase and the rest of the
check increase coming from catering, an increase in the group size per transaction
along with additional sides such as Chips & Guac.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


As you can see, Chipotle clearly deconstructs their comp numbers. The 17.2% comp for
the quarter only includes a 2.5% benefit from price (note to Cramer: Chipotle's 17.2% and
El Pollo Loco's disclosed prelim 4.9%-5% Q2 comp are not "similar comps" as one chain
is experiencing 14% yr/yr traffic growth while the other is doing 1.4%!). This is not
something Chipotle just started doing because the market has been focusing on their
recent nationwide menu price hike; this is something they have always disclosed to
investors even when price increases have been more targeted.


El Pollo Loco does not offer this level of transparency in their prospectus even though EPL
Intermediate has offered it in past 10-Ks.


Here is how they define Comparable Restaurant Sales:


Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in the number
of meals sold and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift
in menu mix and/or higher prices resulting from new products or price increases.


The problem here is that when it comes to disclosing average check, they do not break
out the impact of menu price increases. For example, in their banner 2012 comp year, 6%
of their 8.6% increase in company owned same-store sales came from average check
growth. A number like that for a non-organically growing chain screams significant menu
price increases. Now, if this was a chain with a large national presence, deconstructing
these menu price increases would be a challenge, but you don't have that problem here.


Here are two photos we took a few days ago of an El Pollo Loco drive-thru menu in LA:

What you see above is El Pollo Loco's new menu, which is largely a reflection of where
management has decided to take the brand over the past couple of years. What should
jump out at you (if you are familiar with the brand) is the fact that the 'value' QSR element
has gradually been replaced by what looks more like a fast casual menu. Over the past
few years the "Dollar Menu" morphed into the "Value Menu", which is now being replaced
by the more value indifferent "Snack Menu".

Now we could show you plenty of photos illustrating this genesis, but deciphering the price
changes from multiple images from countless locations spread across several years is not
ideal. So we will try and keep it simple for you by sharing what our extensive research dug
up.


This link is from an El Pollo Loco menu circa summer of 2009. As you can see, when
compared to the prices from the drive-thru screen shots above, things have changed quite
a bit. Popular value items like the "BRC Burrito" and "Chicken Taco al Carbon" have seen
price increases of 65% and 69% respectively. The introductory 8-piece family meal has
increased in price by 14%, and the 10 piece by 17%. A 3-piece chicken leg and thigh
combo has increased by 27%, and the price of a small side has gone up by 44%. Now to
be clear the above photographed menu is new and is not reflective of the entire store
base, and 2009 is a little too far back for what we were looking for in terms of pre-IPO
comp insight.


A more relevant visual comparison would be this blogger's Jan 2012 visit and review (with
menu price photos) of an El Pollo Loco. At this specific restaurant, we verified that popular
value items, the BRC Burrito and the Chicken Taco al Carbon, increased in price by 29%
and 39% over the past two years. Meanwhile, the intro 8-piece leg and thigh family meal
increased by 13%.


Now setting aside these select comparisons, our more comprehensive research indicates
that the key takeaways here are that the low end (i.e. the value items) of the menu has
come up rather significantly over the past 2.5 years, and that the family meals, starting in
mid-2011, have seen 9-15% increases. Basically the intro 8-piece range has gone from
$15.99-$16.49 to $17.49-$18.99 with comparable hikes as you go up in family meal size.
The ability to track the changes on the family meals is actually quite helpful as
management does disclose that these meals accounted for a little less than a third of
company operated store sales. Thus, you can estimate that there is a 2.5-5.0% price hike
impact embedded in the last two years average check growth just from the pricing taken
on this part of the menu. As for other items, we can say that bowls and burritos have been
relatively stable over the past 2 years with a trend of new higher intro price point menu
items entering the total mix.


Overall, we came away from this exercise with the simple conclusion that pricing has been
a very relevant and likely dominant part of an already average check-dominated comp
stack. We also have concluded that management's decision to move towards a more
upmarket brand identity, as they seek to try and grow the brand again, risks alienating the
brand's core demographic and putting them head-to-head with much established healthy

fast casual chains. Basically, becoming more like Chipotle 15 years ago would have been
a good idea, but at this juncture it actually opens the door to that powerhouse making
inroads against you in your bread and butter market. When your bread and butter market
is literally one city, that is a pretty risky maneuver. Chipotle has never really fared too well
in LA because of all the Mexican options and the existence of the likes of El Pollo Loco
dominating the value/family element amongst the Hispanic community; if that were to
drastically change sometime in the near future, El Pollo Loco would quickly become a
candidate for liquidation or restructuring.

Well, if there is ever a private equity version of the hit series "Breaking Bad", El Pollo
Loco's story should be at the top of the list.


Sell tasty chicken out the front door while financial engineers behind the scenes cash in by
piling on debt to pay outrageous dividends, management fees and transaction fees.


The Bamboo Lounge 'bust-out' in Goodfellas is also a good analogy. Find a solid cash
flowing business, run up its credit to take supplies in the front door that are sold at 100%
profit out the back door, and then light a match to the place. When PE goes awry in the
restaurant business it's very hard not to think of the Goodfellas 'bust-out', as piles of cash
in the form of debt literally come in the front door and go out the back, with barely a cent
seemingly ever making its way into the operating business.


The History of the LBO Family Chicken Meal:


The 12-restaurant, Los Angeles-based El Pollo Loco that was acquired by Denny's in
1983 had the makings of what might have one day be today's Chipotle. The chain
expanded rapidly over the following seven years (almost exclusively in southern
California) to 200 units, and developed very strong brand equity. But thanks to the late
1980s junk bond-driven LBO boom (Coniston Partners' purchase of their parent TW
Services for $1.7 billion with $1.5 billion in high yield debt was the last great junk bond
deal of the 1980s), it spent most of the early 1990s as a neglected asset within the
portfolio of a large and financially burdened holding company. Consequently, over the first
half of the decade, El Pollo Loco's parent only managed to add 16 new restaurants. There
were also multiple non-focused failed expansions during this time that saw the chain open
and close in Florida, Hawaii, and even as far away as Japan. Not exactly how you grow a
restaurant franchise, but when you are that leveraged you take what you can get. Yet, a
remodeling program and a new strategy to target the lunch crowd in the mid-1990s
seemed to position El Pollo Loco for an era of renewed expansion. In 1996, their parent
company announced ambitious plans to expand the chain to 600 units by the end of the
decade. Of course the parent's bankruptcy filing the following year threw a wrench into
those plans. The huge expansion never materialized, and by the end of the decade a
decision was made to put El Pollo Loco up for sale.


Enter alleged savior/value creator, PE firm American Securities Capital Partners.


The El Pollo Loco that was acquired by ASCP for $128 million in cash at the end of 1999
($44 million in equity from ASCP and the rest in debt financing in the form of a senior loan)

Here is what they saw themselves bringing to the table in a joint presentation by Steve
Carley- El Pollo Loco CEO and Glenn Kaufman- Managing Director of ASCP:


Admittedly over the next three years they did seem to be making some progress putting
the chain back on the right track. They remodeled stores, upgraded IT systems and
improved overall operating efficiency while selectively expanding in the core market. And
yes, they reduced some of the leverage used to finance their acquisition.


Then at the end of 2003 it would appear they got bored or determined that El Pollo Loco's
future was limited to being a solid LA Mexican chicken chain whose cash flows were
better served being milked than reinvested in domestic expansion; $70 million in additional
debt was incurred, $50 million of that was paid out in the form of a dividend and $20
million was used to buy back preferred stock. El Pollo Loco ended the year with $133
million in debt. In 2004, we got more of the same. ASCP borrowed to pay themselves a
$37 million dividend. Then in 2005 ASCP decided to sell El Pollo Loco, but not before
another $11 million distribution was tacked on in the form of transaction fees. All in all, in
just over 5 years, ASCP took a company with $15 million in capital lease debt and $21
million in EBITDA and turned it into one with nearly $185 million in long-term debt and $33
million in EBITDA. If you run the numbers on the deal financing for the acquisition, fees,
and leveraged dividends cashed out, nearly every last cent of the indebtedness incurred
by El Pollo Loco effectively never made it into the business.

Now here is an excerpt from the PR ASCP put out after they agreed to sell El Pollo Loco
in 2005:


Through continued and long-term focus on operational investment and strategic
growth during its time with American Securities, El Pollo Loco has substantially
improved restaurant level operating performance while more than doubling the
company's profitability. "The heritage of our firm is in building great enterprises. We
are completely committed to working as partners with managers to build businesses
that are far better operationally, financially and competitively when we exit than when
we initially invested," added Mr. Kaufman. "Our El Pollo Loco experience is a perfect
example of our business philosophy."


Seriously? Now doesn't that post-sale case study slide about reducing this acquired
"Orphan's" leverage seem a bit ridiculous to you. If El Pollo Loco was an "Orphan" when
ASCP bought it from TW Services, it was an orphan with a new pair of shoes and no legs
by the time they sold them to Trimaran Capital Partners. A better analogy here would be
that ASCP acquired an orphaned chain, dabbled with nursing them back to health, only to
turn around and thoroughly 'bust them out' before they sold them off to somebody else.


During these five years of financial ingenuity, while El Pollo Loco was being used as a PE
ATM machine, Chipotle opened nearly 500 restaurants across the nation. One can't help
but wonder what El Pollo Loco would like today if all that debt had been used to fund a
gradual and laser focused expansion of the brand.


So, El Pollo Loco, whose biggest problem had been that it was stuck in the portfolio of a
restaurant holding company mired in junk bond mania debt, was now also buried in debt.


The solution: Why of course, another LBO to tack on even more debt, and hopefully a
quick flip IPO to save the day.


Enter Trimaran Capital, the current majority shareholder, which clearly had no intention of
holding onto El Pollo Loco for very long. Going back through SEC filings we found the
2006 S-1 for El Pollo Loco in which they were looking to raise up to $135mln for a
company with $260mln in debt and $36mln in EBITDA (according to 2005 numbers in the
S-1.) Note, this S-1 was initially filed just a few months after the closing of the acquisition
by Trimaran. So for them having this 'quick-flip' turn into a 9-year 'investment' was
definitely not part of their original game plan. Their timing was to put it mildly not very
good. Over their ownership period El Pollo Loco reported an aggregate net loss of $191
million. Their last profitable year was 2006, and for the last year the company earned

more than $1 million you have to go all the way back to 2003. And as if being the last PE
buyer in the door before the music stopped and a major recession appeared wasn't bad
enough, they got hit losing a trademark lawsuit to the original Mexican founder of El Pollo
Loco (they ended up settling for just under $11 million in 2008). Not exactly a pleasant
journey. In fact, it is a sheer miracle that they averted bankruptcy here. Just a look back at
their filings and you can see that as recently as August 2011 they were marking El Pollo
Loco at 30c on the dollar ($30 million equity value for the whole company). Yet now they
are sitting on a majority stake in a company that the market is valuing at $1.4 billion, and
an income tax receivable agreement that is worth some $40 million in distributions (to both
PE firms) going forward. This is a pretty remarkable turn of events to say the least.


So, what was the point of this trip down memory lane?


Well, to be clear, we wanted to set the record straight as far as current popular perception
of this name being some sort of hot 'story' stock. El Pollo Loco's last twenty years of
operating history are an absolute tragedy. This was a business with a lot of potential that
always seemed to find the wrong owners, and now after decades of missed opportunity it
is being dumped on the unsuspecting retail investor. Now, there is no doubt that
management has done an excellent job stabilizing the ship, especially considering they
have been operating with the financial equivalent of a noose around their neck. But that
does not obscure the fact that this is just about the furthest thing from an exciting growth
story, and that owning the shares at these levels is the equivalent of simply burning the
cash in your wallet.


VI. Valuation: What's it worth?


El Pollo Loco shares currently trade in excess of 30x EV/ 2013 ADJ EBITDA (Chipotle is
at 29x trailing and 24x consensus estimate for 2014).


Consider that multiple within the context of how long the brand has been around, the
missed opportunities to expand while PE played LBO hot potato with it, the subsequent
and very recent failed domestic expansion, the concurrent domestic metamorphosis of
Chipotle into a Mexican chain national powerhouse, and overall intense competition in
their very crowded niche. How many Pollo [fill in the blank] are there in the USA? We
counted at least 10 other regional chains including El Pollo Rico, Gordo, de Oro, Regio,
Inka, Primo, Campero, Feliz, Norteno and just plain El Pollo. The multiple is just plain
LOCO! When you further factor in El Pollo Loco's concentrated exposure to one city, a

menu that is pushing the outer limits of value for a brand with a core demographic that is
highly value conscious, and still somewhat limited balance sheet flexibility, a multiple north
of 10x EV/ ADJ EBITDA becomes completely indefensible.


At 10x EV/ADJ EBITDA the stock would be trading at $9.80 which implies over 70%
downside from current levels. This would put it on par with where recent food and
beverage IPO Potbelly is now trading. We think fair value for this business is still lower,
with a price close to $6/share in the coming 12-18 months not being out of the question.


$6 that must be some crazy sensationalist short-biased target, right?


To be clear that target is not even predicated on some sort of gloom and doom scenario.


Mature niche restaurant chains are very sensitive to short-term comps, and there is no
shortage of them trading at trailing EV/Sales multiples of 1x or less (Potbelly, Bloomin
Brands, and Red Robin Gourmet all trade at EV/Sales multiples of less than one).
Considering El Pollo Loco generated $315 million in revenue last year, a 1x EV/Sales
multiple works out to $3.50/share. Now Potbelly is interesting comp because it's a more
recent expansion story, IPO'd less than a year ago, operates 280+ company owned shops
across 18 states, had 20% shop level margins vs El Pollo Loco's 21% in 2013, and is
sitting on a much healthier balance sheet with net cash at 2x EBITDA vs net debt of 3.4x
ADJ EBITDA at El Pollo Loco. Yet Potbelly doubled from its offering price, traded
sideways for a few months, then slowly trickled back down to the offering price, and later
fell off a cliff after its third quarterly report as a public company on weaker-than-expected
comps. It currently trades at an EV/ADJ 2013 EBITDA of 8x and EV/2013 Sales multiple
of 0.96x. These multiples should give any El Pollo Loco investors pause, especially when
you factor in that Potbelly has been steadily growing their brand since 1995, and has not
experienced the type of significant geographic retrenchments El Pollo Loco has faced over
the years. However Potbelly has been weak of late, so let's look at a more mature
restaurant chain with better recent operating momentum.


Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK), which owns the 600+ unit Mexican themed Qdoba
chain, (as well as 2,200+ Jack In The Boxes) has been on a tear of late with shares up
60% over the last 12 months. The driver has been significant comp momentum at the
Qdoba chain recently, where comps as of the most recent quarter were up 7.5% year over
year, and year to date are up 500bps over 2013. Despite this recent run-up, the stock is
trading at EV/TTM EBITDA of roughly 10x. In fact, most of the successful established
national restaurant chains trade in this neighborhood. Panera (NASDAQ:PNRA), Bloomin

Brands, Wendy's (NYSE:WEN), McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), Red Robin Gourmet
(NASDAQ:RRGB), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) all trade at
roughly 11x EV/EBITDA or less.


The next step up comp wise is Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI) which has 20%+ mkt
share in the domestic chicken QSR segment, and thus makes for a solid comparable.
Popeyes trades at 14.5x EV/ TTM EBITDA. The chain sports EBITDA margins that are
nearly double El Pollo Loco at 31.7%, and grew revenue by 35% (only 2% of the chains
2,225 are company-owned) over the past two years. Their Net Debt to EBITDA clocks in
at 0.9x, and over the past three years they have on average returned 36% of EBITDA to
shareholders via buybacks. Furthermore, the Popeyes brand continues to grow both
domestically and internationally despite its large unit base. The global brand equity is hard
to ignore considering the brand was founded only two years before El Pollo Loco.


After Popeyes, the next chain worth looking at in the comp ladder is the very relevant
Fiesta Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:FRGI). FRGI, which operates two Mexican/Caribbean
themed chains in "Taco Cabana" and "Pollo Tropical", is about as close as you are going
to get to El Pollo Loco. The chains have a similar regional focus with Pollo Tropical's base
concentrated in Florida and Taco Cabana's in Texas. FRGI trades at an EV/EBITDA
multiple of 18x or 40% lower than El Pollo Loco. We believe the name is also an attractive
Chipotle-inflated Mexican chain stock short, but will concede that for now it provides a
more marketable surface level growth story. Pollo Tropical's 7% average same-store sales
growth over the past two years is 66% weighted to traffic vs El Pollo Loco's 37% traffic
weighting for a virtually identical company owned same-store sales two-year average.
Pollo Tropical's stores are also averaging 53% more in avg sales per unit, and exhibit 350
bps higher restaurant level margins. We'd also note that FRGI's largely company-owned
model has resulted in a much more controlled domestic brand expansion with no
significant failed retrenchments in recent years damaging brand equity, and thus remains
more open to future domestic franchising margin-expanding opportunities.


The last non-Chipotle chain in El Pollo Loco's valuation neighborhood is the 50x+ EV/ADJ
EBITDA multiple sporting and seemingly 'unique Mediterranean concept story' of Zoe's
Kitchen, ticker "ZOES". Zoe's, which has gone from 20 units to 100+ in the past five years,
is still growing its top line at close to 50%. But a 'fresh' concept chain and a small store
base with exceptional and consistent unit growth trends over five years is again the very
antithesis of El Pollo Loco.

We even fished around for private chicken chain comps during our research and came
across QSR behemoth Church's Chicken which was sold four years ago for an estimated
6x EBITDA.


There is another way to think about how to value this business other than looking at public
company comps. If you've had any experience valuing small regionally-focused private
service industry businesses or large franchisees of a healthy restaurant brand, El Pollo
Loco should be right up your alley. When you come across a regionally strong business
that has the characteristics of a finite/limited geographic expansion story, you don't want
pay more than 5x EBITDA. Ideally, you come across such a business and conclude you
can clean it up and significantly improve profitability and find a seller who is willing to part
from it for less than 3.5x. However, you'd be willing to pay up to 5x knowing there is plenty
of room to grow your value and effectively reduce your cost base. The exact opposite is
true if the business is being well-run or has in fact made some recent changes which
significantly improved operating profitability.


In such a scenario, you are more likely to discount the recently improved operating metrics
as what you are trying to buy is a cash cow and not a growth story. Essentially, if the
current owner has recently significantly improved operating profitability, you are going to
be much more stubborn with respect to your valuation ceiling. We like to think of El Pollo
Loco in the same way, but on a somewhat grander scale. This is not a hot growth "story"
brand or national/global scale play. At best, there might be room for some selective further
Southwest regional expansion, but for the most part the view here is that this is a more
mature regionally specific strong service brand. This puts the 10x+ EBITDA range out of
the question for it. Our acceptable range is going to be more like 5x-10x. The more
confident we are that they can significantly improve operating profitability, the more
comfortable we are with the higher end of the range. This is where the pre-IPO metrics
come into play. The 340 bps in restaurant contribution margin improvement, sizeable
average check growth, huge comp deviation from historical averages, new menu changes,
near 50% completed store base remodelings, 2013 debt refinancing, Second Lien Term
Loan paydown in conjunction with the IPO, and recent wave of underperforming store
closures are ironically all the things WE DON'T WANT TO SEE as buyers of a strong cash
flowing Southern California restaurant chain. Because what is there left for us to do but try
and turn it into a growth story, which as buyers looking at this regionally mature brand we
already have assumed it is not. If both parties are sharp, what you end up with here is a
stalemate. The buyer doesn't want to pay top dollar for a cash cow business that has just

gone through a thorough once a decade refurbishing, and the last thing the seller wants is
a prospective buyer who does nothing but remind him that he has put all this work in and
is selling here because he has accepted that meaningful expansion is not feasible.


This is the key issue with El Pollo Loco, and probably goes a long way to explaining how
the underwriters were able to price the IPO at $15. If you pro forma the hell out the name,
the stock priced at a seemingly reasonable P/E of 22x 2013 net income. That is a pretty
big leap from $16.8 million reported loss, and the close to $200 million in reported losses
incurred by the company since Trimaran bought it. Bankers love these types of IPOs
because they are essentially deleveraging turnaround stories that are partially contingent
on the IPO happening, and the huge deleveraging impact on reported results quickly
becomes the only thing investors want to talk about. The El Pollo Loco business couldn't
have been more ideally suited for this type of pitch. Between 2011 and 2013 revenues are
up 15%, operating income is up 56%, restaurant contribution margin improved by 230 bps,
ADJ EBITDA margins improved by 300 bps, and company-operated store average unit
volumes went from $1.6 million to $1.75 million.


These are impressive metrics to say the least, and that is the problem here. They are
literally so good that you are immediately forced to red-flag them. How are you growing
operating income 56% with 2.5% yr/yr growth in traffic? 230bps in restaurant margin
expansion is no joke for a mature chain with 67% of their stores in one city; are you not
testing the upper limits of pricing on your core Hispanic base in Los Angeles? What
happens to Average Store Sales Volume when stores doing 30-50% less than the core LA
base close down? What kind of restaurant chain goes from 6% D&A avg expense of total
revenue to 3%? When you answer all these questions, you should have no problem
figuring out that El Pollo Loco's impressive growth in metrics are not due to organic
growth. Instead, they reflect a cash-cow business pulling short-term levers in anticipation
of a sale. The fixed cost leverage that has been extracted here doesn't comport with a
growing franchise. El Pollo Loco has the labor, occupancy, depreciation, food cost, and
marketing spend cost structure of a very mature, one region-focused chain that is simply
milking its base. Start to expand - which by the way, they have failed to do when there was
much less powerful competition for their brand - and these savings being squeezed out all
go in the other direction. Start growing and lower average store volumes as you enter
markets further away from your core base or cannibalize your existing mature base with
new stores, more complex and costly distribution, expanding overhead, and much higher
marketing spend to build brand awareness are what you have to look forward to.

There are also regulatory issues to worry about like the July 1, 2014 12.5% California
minimum wage increase, and a further 11% increase coming at the end of 2015.
Considering that 88% of the store base is located in California, a 25% increase in payroll
over the next 18 months is going to be a very meaningful EBITDA headwind (again, nice
IPO timing). Put all this together and you start to appreciate why a discounted multiple is
warranted here. In our case we settled on 7.5x ADJ 2013 EBITDA or a 'fair value' of $6.10
a share for now.


Note there is nothing wrong with running this business the way it has been run.
Management has done what they needed to do over the past three years, and the
economic rebound obviously helped them out as well. Our concern with El Pollo Loco is
that between its LBO ownership history nightmare and its recent refurbishing a whole lot
of time has passed, and the competitive landscape is not what it used to be. Their core
demographic in Los Angeles has absorbed the pricing shifts thus far, but the risks have
gone up with respect to economic sensitivity of the chain and vulnerability to competition
from more upmarket brands as well as from the better positioned 'value' players. We have
not accounted for these risks in our 'fair value', but we are fairly confident that if a whiff of
evidence were to materialize indicating tiring of the brand in Los Angeles, 5x and not 10x
ADJ EBITDA will quickly become the ceiling.


Summary


1. El Pollo Loco was a hot franchise chain with amazing growth prospects 30 years ago.
Today it's still just an LA staple that is probably going to have to work very hard just to
maintain its grip on what it already has. Comparing it to Chipotle is like comparing a
highly touted draft pick from 20 years ago whose early career was marred by injuries
and poor coaching, and thus ended up being relegated to role player status, to Lebron
James today.


2. Chipotle's success which has buoyed the share price out the gate actually works
against them as far as future growth prospects go.


3. El Pollo Loco's pre-IPO comp numbers and margin expansion are somewhat
misleading. Significant price increases/menu mix shift into a rebounding economy
have been the driver, and thus should be heavily discounted by investors.


4. Setting aside what repeated failed domestic expansions implies about the brand's
future long-term growth prospects; the very recent nature of franchise expansion
failures across multiple states does not bode well for any future franchising in an
already competitive franchise marketplace.

5. The largest shareholder is a legacy PE fund in runoff mode that filed to take them
public no more than six months after initially acquiring them. At lock-up expiration their
holding period will have been just shy of ten years! The sheer fact that they avoided
bankruptcy and a complete wipeout of their investment is a miracle in and of itself. As
of a couple years ago, they were marking this investment at $0.30 on the dollar. We
imagine anything greater than $5/share feels like a victory to them at this point. With all
this in mind, we have no doubt they will be highly motivated sellers anywhere over
$10.


6. The income tax receivable agreement with the current shareholders is like pouring salt
on an open wound. It's just another way of structuring a $40 million IPO contingent
distribution kicker for the pre-existing shareholders at the expense of new investors.
The $10 million in cash interest expense savings from retiring the 2nd lien facility ends
up getting funneled back to the current PE owners in the form of cash tax savings over
the for the next four years. This is further evidence that this is a financially engineered
and abused orphan of a restaurant business, and not the next potential shining growth
star it's being portrayed as in the financial media.


7. Finally, the restaurant stock euphoria of the last 18 months is no longer a tail wind.
Red Robin, Bloomin Brands, Potbelly, and Noodles and Co have all recently
demonstrated just how quickly the market will punish the slightest dip in operating
momentum. Those looking for long exposure in this sector are better served nibbling
away at a solid growing brand like Panera that has spent the last year or two dealing
with its own operational hiccups and is trading at an attractive 8x EBITIDA multiple.
We think betting on them ahead of a potential rebound beats giving your money way in
this dressed up Chipotle piggy-back PE exit.
