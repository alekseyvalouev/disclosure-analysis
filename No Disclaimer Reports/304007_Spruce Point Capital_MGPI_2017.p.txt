Executive Summary
5


Quick Highlights: 


1. Rapid Whiskey / Bourbon Sales Growth, A Key Driver of MGPI’s Recent Earnings + Share Price Expansion Won’t 


Continue As A Result of Substantial New Capacity Growth


2. Diageo Is A Material Whiskey Customer Accounting For At Least 8% of Revenues, Its New Distillery Comes On-Line In 


2017; Best Case It Reduces / Eliminate Its Supply Contract With MGPI; Worst Case It Competes Directly Against It


3. MGPI Also Appears To Be Quietly Covering Up A Large Market Share Loss In the Gin Category Associated With 


Seagram’s. Investors Should Study Both The Gin and Vodka Market As Case Studies For What Can Happen To Whiskey


4. A Multitude of Other Contracts And A Key Ingredient Patent Expires in 2017 Which Significantly Increase MGPI’s 


Business Risk; Investors Are More Focused On The Alcohol Business, And Not Paying Close Attention


5. MGPI Has A History of Operational Disasters (Fires and Chemical Explosions) Which Could Harm Earnings


6. MGPI’s Foray Into Branded Liquor Sales Have Shown De Minimis Results, And Are Likely To Disappoint


7. MGPI Is Out of Cash, And Borrowing Heavily On Its Credit Facility, Funding Long-Term Construction With Short-Term 


Debt. It Must Turnover Its Barreled Whiskey or Face Severe Financial Strain


8. MGPI Quietly Restated 2015 Results of Related-Party Transactions Affecting Its ICP JV With Seacor (Another Public 


Company) Both Companies Financial Reporting Do Not Reconcile, Which Potentially Puts MGPI In Violation of Its 


Credit Agreement. MGPI Is Also Quietly Restating Sales Figures Tied To Customer Freight


9. Regulators Are Expanding An Audit Investigation of MGPI, Which May Result In Increased Taxes and Penalty Costs


10. Follow The Money Carefully: MGPI’s Largest Shareholder And Founding Family Entered A Stock Sale Program on 


Dec 21, 2016 – Around The Holiday Period When Things Were “Quiet”


11. Spruce Point Sees Approximately 60% – 70% Downside + Big Hangover Waiting For Investors Intoxicated By The False 


Hope of Future Gains. MGPI’s Valuation Will Revert To 8x-10x EBITDA From 14.5x Currently Once Reality Sets In

Pay Close Attention To MGPI’s Recent 
Accounting Warnings


Fiscal 
Year


Basis of Presentation and 
Principles of Consolidation


Use of Estimates


2016


The condensed consolidated financial statements 
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated in 
consolidation.


The financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period.  The application of certain of these policies places 
significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial 
reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters 
that are inherently uncertain.  For all of these policies, management 
cautions that future events rarely develop as forecast, and estimates 
routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment.


2015


The accompanying unaudited condensed 
consolidated financial statements of the Company 
reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal 
adjustments) which, in the opinion of the 
Company’s management, are necessary to fairly 
present the financial position, results of operations 
and cash flows of the Company.  All intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated in 
consolidation.


The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in

and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.

Taking a step back before reading our report, we believe investors should carefully evaluate the 


unusual changes to MGPI’s 2016 10-Q filings it made. We believe the Company is signaling 


accounting strain and issuing a subtle warning.  Look carefully at Note 1. Accounting Polices and 


Basis of Presentation. MGPI added a stronger cautionary statement suggesting its estimates may require 


material adjustment, and removed a statement that suggested its financials were fairly presented

Spruce Point Believes MGPI Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


MGP Ingredients (“MGPI” or “the Company”) Is A Commodity Ingredient and Alcohol Producer Now Being Spun As A Sexy 


Transformation Story Into A Premium Producer of Branded Whiskey and Bourbon


 MGPI is a simple story to understand. It operates two businesses: an ingredients business run from Kansas and an alcohol 


distillery in Indiana. Both of these facilities are old assets and prone to substantial operational hazards. Most recently, MGPI has 


experienced fires, work outages, and chemical disasters requiring the hospitalization of innocent people 


 MGPI’s shares have appreciated 1,000% since 2014 as investors have cheered the Company’s decision to hire new 


management, reprioritize its businesses away from commodity ingredients, and focus on “higher margin” premium alcohol 


beverages. MGPI has also recently benefited from a temporary, yet unsustainable, increase in earnings from its 30% joint venture


with Seacor (NYSE: CKH) called Illinois Corn Processing (ICP) 


 On the surface, the Company’s transformation strategy appears wildly successful. Its EPS has risen from a loss of ($0.29) in 2013 


to positive earnings of $1.50 per share in the LTM 9/30/16 period. Over the same period, sales have essentially been flat, but 


gross margins have expanded from 6.4% to 18.1% 


Spruce Point Believes Investors Should Be Cautioned Not To Extrapolate Recent Earnings Performance. We Believe There 


Are Numerous Business Risks And Cracks In The Growth Story That Are Not Being Adequately Discounted 


 The biggest aspect of the “bull case” surrounding MGPI is that it is a play on the explosive growth in consumer taste for whiskey 


and bourbon, and can transition to a branded producer. Investors fail to realize that MGPI is primarily a white-label producer that 


sells to other brands. One of its largest customers (which MGPI doesn’t adequately disclose) is Diageo, which owns the Bulleit 


brand. Diageo is close to completing its own Kentucky whiskey distillery that is expected to be completed in 2017. At best. Diageo 


reduces or completely eliminates up to 8% of MGPI’s sales, and at worst they start to directly compete in the bulk wholesale market


 There are now over 1,000 craft distillers for whiskey / bourbon in the United States. Just like Diageo, many of these distillers are 


constructing their own distilleries, which would reduce / eliminate their need to buy from MGPI. The rapid proliferation of new 


distilleries and brands in the market makes MGPI’s ability to brand itself all-the-more challenging. Based on our research, its recent 


tiny acquisition of George Remus whiskey and introduction of Metze’s Select (Metze being MGPI’s master distiller who recently 


departed) have had limited traction, and are nothing more than way out-of-the money call options. Many high profile liquor brands 


endorsed by celebrities and billionaires have failed in the past. There’s no reason to assume MGPI will have any success


 Because investors are so enamored with MGPI’s alcohol business, they are not paying attention to other material risks that loom 


large in 2017 such as: 1) key ingredient patent expiration, 2) collective bargaining agreement, 3) supplier agreements, and 4) added 


fines / penalties from a) recently expanded audit investigation by the TTB, and b) from the chemical explosion in 2016

Spruce Point Believes MGPI Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


Look To Struggles In the Vodka and Gin Market For An Indicator of What Can Happen in Whiskey / Bourbon


 Consumer alcohol preferences are inherently fickle and constantly changing. A few years ago, the craft vodka market exploded 


leaving established brands such as Smirnoff and Absolut to compete with new brands such as Kettle One, Grey Goose, Ciroc, 


and dozens of others. MGPI claims 25% vodka market share, but industry executives recently called the vodka market 


“saturated” and overall vodka organic growth is stagnant at just 1% as reported by industry bellwether Diageo


 MGPI also produces flavored and natural gin. The Company does not disclose revenues by product type, but from its recent 


investor presentation, the Company changed its market share from 65% to 35% share. This illustrates what can happen when a 


customer decides to shift production and reduce dependence on MGPI. Based on our research, we believe that MGPI has 


produced Seagram’s gin, and its owner Pernod Ricard has been shifting production to Arkansas away from MGPI


MGPI’s Barreled Whiskey Inventory Is Rapidly Rising, While Sales Are Declining, And Inventory Turnover Plunges


 MGPI’s whiskey inventories have risen from $11.1m in 2013 to $45.0m as of 9/30/16. During the same time period, its inventory 


turnover has plunged from 8.6x to 3.7x and its food grade alcohol sales are declining. MGPI says everything is fine and that it is 


spending $29m to expand warehouse storage. It started to disclose “premium beverage alcohol” sales in its press release in an 


attempt to show strength in this segment, but won’t stand behind the numbers and include them in the recent 10-Q


 MGPI’s free cash flow is sharply negative and it is borrowing heavily on its credit facility (funding a long-term asset with short-


term debt). MGPI also has no cash on its balance sheet and its credit facility is now 46% utilized. As a result, its financial profile 


is precariously stretched in what amounts to a levered bet that it can sell its existing whiskey inventory either under its own 


brand (a speculative bet we argue is likely to fail absent enormous investment in distribution/marketing) or in the open market 


 The Company tells investors it has the “potential” to sell its whiskey at 3x the current cost. It lists its whiskey as a current asset, 


but must age the product for three years. We believe it should be viewed as a long-term asset, and as a result believe MGPI’s 


current ratio (a measure of its liquidity) is significantly worse than it appears


 MGPI must turn its inventory and hope that it doesn’t decline in value because its credit facility and borrowing base depend on 


inventory valuation. We don’t believe investors should assume that management is correct, and its whiskey will magically 


appreciate 3x in value. Based on our recent channel checks, we believe there is an abundance of wholesale whiskey / bourbon 


available. We contacted Ultra Pure the #1 bulk wholesaler in the market. We found that prices have been largely stagnant since 


2014. Additionally, we sourced price quotes from J.B. Thome, another reputable broker and found no price differential between 


aged MGPI rye. As substantial new supply comes into the market, we would not be surprised to see prices begin to decline

We See 60% - 70% Downside Risk


MGPI’s Shares Are Priced For Perfection And Now Its Largest Shareholder Is Liquidating


 In our view, it is easy to refute the bull case. Investors are valuing its shares as if it already were the best branded alcohol 


producer in the world (greater than Diageo, Constellation and Brown-Forman) even though it has no firmly established brands. 


MGPI trades at a rich 2.5x, 14.5x and 29.0x 2017 street estimates of sales, EBITDA, and EPS, respectively. Optically, Its leverage 


appears conservative at just 0.8x Debt to EBITDA. But, in reality once its EBITDA and EPS start to decline, investors will focus


heavily on the fact it has zero cash and is utilizing 46% of its credit revolver


 MGPI has just two small sell-side analysts that tout its stock has 17% upside to $55/sh and seem confident it can compound its 


sales and earnings by at least 5% over the next two years, while expanding EBITDA margins by 170bps. Based on our price 


target of 60% - 70% downside, there’s a terrible risk / reward of owning shares at the moment 


 MGPI’s valuation multiple is stretched and trading near an all-time high. We believe that once it becomes clear that the whiskey 


market is saturated, MGPI is stuck with excess inventory, and its tiny brands fail to gain traction, investors will once again realize 


they own a mediocre commodity alcohol and ingredient Company, which would ordinarily be valued at 1x sales and 8x – 9x 


EBITDA. As a result, we see approximately 60% - 70% downside risk in MGPI’s share price to a range of $16 – $21 per share


 Insiders always know best so follow the money. It’s no surprise to us that the Seaberg family which owns ~28% of the Company’s 


common stock and 84% of the preferred shares (giving them Board control) recently entered into a stock sale program in late 


December to start liquidating a portion of its holdings


Warning: Related-Party Transactions and Revenues From Customer Freight Shipping Are Not Adding Up 


 Spruce Point always takes extra precaution to identify and evaluate related-party transactions when they occur at public 


companies. In the case of MGPI, we think investors should question its relationship with ICP, an entity which it owns 30% and 


produces ethanol related products with Seacor, another publicly traded company


 To our dismay, starting in Q2’16 we find that MGPI has been quietly restating purchase amounts from the JV in fiscal year 2015. 


These restatements, coincide with the period that both MGPI’s CFO abruptly resigned in May 2015 (he had been CFO since 2009) 


as well as its Randy Schrick who had been with the Company 42yrs in June 2015 (most recently served as VP of Production and 


Engineering). MGPI’s reported purchases from ICP are explicitly contradicted by Seacor. Seacor has generally reported less sales 


to MGPI than MGPI claims. We can understand why MGPI might report slightly higher purchases than Seacor (e.g. shipping 


costs), but don’t understand why in any case they would be reported lower as in 2014


 We also observe that sales figures related to customer freight costs are not adding up YTD, and being retroactively restated higher 


in 2015. Our concern about the validity of MGPI’s numbers could cause issues with its credit facility covenants

The Bear Case on MGPI
13


Bull vs. Bear Case


What The Stock Cheerleaders’ Say Spruce Point’s View


We believe a majority of the margin benefits have 
already been realized, well in advance of plan
• Mix of premium ingredients has already reached 


~86% and shift is being driven as much by 
deterioration of  industrial revenues as growth


• MGPI doesn’t disclose how much high margin old-
aged product is supporting current results


• Further expansion highly dependent on success with 
its own brand launch, which we believe is likely to fail


Apis Capital Dec 2015


“Margins will expand in coming years, driven by mix shift 
towards premium alcohol and ingredients products…”


Apis Capital Dec 2015 


“The company benefits from secular tailwinds in favor of 
whiskey – rye whiskey in particular“ and “Existing Business 
Growth with Significant Market Share and Sustainable Barriers.” 


No barriers to entry that capital investment cannot 
displace. Premium alcohol white label volume growth 
to temper or reverse as deep pocketed customers seek 
to distill their own product; the most notable is 
Diageo’s $110m KY distillery which could potentially 
jeopardize 8% or more of MGPI’s current revenue, and 
put more secondary supply into wholesale market. Apis Capital Dec 2015


“The real strategic win, however, appears on the balance 
sheet as “barreled distillate”. These barrels are filled with 
distillate, booked at cost, and owned by MGP for the aging 
process. In a sense, this is MGP’s “reserve” which they can 
access at any point after aging for 4 years. Aged barrels of 
distillate can sell for 3x the cost after ~4 years of aging.” 


What may have been true in the past, should not be 
assumed in the future. With substantial new distillate 
and storage capacity coming on line, we do not believe 
that it’s safe to assume whiskey prices will rise in the 
future. What if they decline? What if they have storage 
losses or more plant explosions? Our price checks 
suggest no premium for their aged product
14


Bull vs. Bear Case (cont’d)


What The Stock Cheerleaders’ Say Spruce Point’s View


Seeking Alpha Blogger “Cleshock” (MF Analyst)


“This story has a clean balance sheet, good free cash flow…”


MGI has zero cash on its balance sheet, 
borrowing heavily on its short-term credit 
facility to fund a long-term warehouse facility, 
and is free cash flow negative. 


Apis Capital Dec 2015 


“..additional upside exists if the company is able to 
successfully launch its own, branded whiskey.” 


• The success of proprietary brands to date has 
shown little traction


• MGPI hasn’t even disclosed how much market 
and distribution expenses are required to become 
a credible, national branded liquor co.


• Many well-funded and celebrity-backed alcohol 
spirits have failed


• MGPI’s foray into branded liquor products is at 
best a way out-of-the-money call option 


Craig Hallum Dec 2016 


“The company announced the acquisition of the George 
Remus Whiskey brand in an all cash transaction (terms not 
disclosed)… this acquisition is the first of potentially more as it 
develops of its own portfolio of premium spirits brands. .” 


Apis Capital Dec 2015


Comparable companies in the space are hard to find given the 
“whiskey pure-play” nature of MGP. However, a quick glance at 
gross margins at Brown-Forman, Diageo, Suntory, Pernod Ricard, 
Remy, among others, shows gross margins anywhere from 50-70%.


Have you looked at Castle Brands (AMEX: ROX)? 
MGPI will never be a Diageo, Brown-Forman, or 
Suntory (Jim Beam). The comparisons are 
meaningless in our opinion

Bull vs. Bear Case (cont’d)


What The Stock Cheerleaders’ Say Spruce Point’s View


Apis Capital Dec 2015


“Additionally, strong earnings growth combined with modest 
rerating towards its branded alcohol peer group offers 
substantial upside” 


The stratospheric rise in MGPI’s share price has resulted in 
it already trading at a premium to aspirational beverage 
peers.  The appropriate valuation multiple is as a 
commodity ingredient provider, not a branded beverage 
company


Once the whiskey bubble bursts, and MGPI’s braded 
liquor strategy clearly fails, investors will realize they own 
a mediocre ingredient Company, which would be valued
at 1x sales and 8x – 9x EBITDA


Seeking Alpha Blogger “Cleshock” (MF Analyst)


“…Good visibility, and limited downside (say earnings top out 
here at $1.50/yr and market gives them 20x, so a $30 
downside? ”


There is no visibility in MGPI’s commodity businesses. Also, 
many key contracts may be canceled and a patent expiry 
looms large in 2017. We see substantial downside especially if 
barreled whiskey inventory doesn't turn over, it spoils, or 
prices declines shrink its credit facility borrowing base, and in 
an extreme case, trigger mandatory debt repayment


Craig Hallum Dec 2016


“Our $50 price target for MGPI is based on 15.0x CY18 
EV/EBITDA on our estimate of $58.5M, in-line with Consumer 
Alcohol peers trading at 15.2x.”


SunTrust Dec 2016 


“We are raising our price target to $60 from $50 which equates 
to 14x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, at the low end of the mid-to-
high teens EBITDA multiples of other beverage companies…our 
EV calculation assumes $150M in barreled whiskey inventory 
(given it is a tangible product with an intrinsic value) which is 
subtracted from the company's equity value.” 


It doesn’t give us confidence that the analyst admits modeling 
errors in the same note. How can one ascribe 3x current value 
to whiskey inventory on the balance sheet at just $45m. 
Clearly, just taking management’s word of its future value not 
considering large supply increases coming, or the fact that 
bulk whiskey prices have not been increasing. Also MGPI has to 
reserve some of the whiskey for its own white label clients

Profit Driver Analysis Suggests A Difficult 
Road Ahead For MGPI’s Earnings Growth


Profit Driver Assessment Implication for Future MGPI Profit


Distillery Sales


Revenue drivers are: 1) Premium Spirits, 2) Industrial Alcohol, 3) Feed and co-
products, and 4) warehouse / storage revenues. Premium spirits will fail to hit 
expectations as acquired brands such as George Remus are slow to ramp, 
existing whiskey sales stagnate / disappear due to large supply increase. 
Warehouse revenue also disappoints as fewer customers require the service. 
Industrial alcohol: pricing conditions in the industrial alcohol industry have 
been difficult all year as this market is oversupplied. Distillers Feed: an 
overabundant co-product tied to corn prices may continue to decline in sales


Ingredients
Pricing headwinds expected to continue. Material starch ingredient Fibersym® 
comes off patent in 2017 and could lower margins


Input Costs


Principal distillery inputs are corn, rye, barley, wheat and ingredients flour. 
MGPI is very dependent on 2 suppliers for grain. If its financial condition 
deteriorate credit conditions could tighten. Most grain commodities remain 
oversupplied leaving a low risk of substantial near term price inflation


ICP JV
Profits peaked at $10.1m in 2014 and have been in steady decline. Recent 
contraction of industry wide fuel ethanol margins weighing on performance


Operating 
Expenses


Recent one-time, non-recurring benefits includes a legal settlement and a gain 
on sale of an asset – both totaling $3.4m. Chemical release likely to result in 
fines and increases in safety and operational improvement costs


Taxes
Effective tax rate declined from 34% to 31% due to an accounting change. This 
change is likely to hold constant next year and won’t drop the rate further

Overview of MGPI’s Old and Aging Assets


Both of MGPI’s assets are old and prone to operational disasters. In particular, MGPI is promoting its ability to leverage its 


Lawrenceburg distillery to gain share in the premium spirits market with a focus on whiskey and bourbon. The facility has a long history 


and was established in 1857 as the Rossville Union Distillery. Seagram and Sons acquired it in 1933. When Seagram’s folded in 2000, 


Diageo and Pernod Ricard split the beverage division, with Pernod taking the Lawrenceburg facility. Pernod sold it to CL Financial in 


2007 to form LDI. MGPI acquired LDI in October 2011 for the announced sum of $15m, although the actual payment was just $10.9m 


according to the 10-K. New and modern distillery capacity is rapidly entering the market while MGPI’s old assets are currently trading 


at a historic valuation multiple near 6x book value!

It’s hard to get excited to pay a premium multiple to own a Company with a history of operational disasters

that a potentially larger disaster completely incapacitates operations and has a material hit to earnings.

Craft Whiskey Market Becoming Saturated; 
Pop Out The Bubbly….


In Spruce Point’s opinion, the “explosive growth” in the craft whiskey market has now reached the saturation point. Thanks 


to the help of an ambitious whiskey blogger who has tracked the market, it’s easy to see there are now in excess of 1,000 


brands/distillers domestically (1).  According to a recent industry white-paper, “The Craft Distilling market is no longer in its 


infancy. The pioneers of the 90’s and 00’s yielded to the explosion in new entrants over the past few years. And now we are 


seeing some of those entrants departing. The next phase of the market will see increasing numbers of exits, even as the 


number of new entrants continues to grow.” This bodes poorly for MGPI’s fledgling new brands. Without substantial 


marketing effort and brand awareness, MGPI’s goals to establish a branded product faces substantial challenges.

White Oak Barrel Shortage Will Self Correct


A bottleneck that restricted the supply of domestic whiskey and bourbon has been a shortage of white oak barrels used 


for aging. In May 2015, a Wall Street Journal article highlighted the issue. However, like all supply/demand imbalances 


they eventually get corrected. In response to the shortage, current manufacturers are expanding production

Independent Stave Company Purchases Land in 
Western Kentucky Slated to Become the  
Company’s Sixth American Oak Stave Mill, 
Paving the Way for Future Expansion to ISC’s 
Barrel-Making Operations


MOREHEAD, Ky. (April 4, 2016) – American Stave
Company, a division of Independent Stave 
Company (ISC), is pleased to announce the 
acceptance of its offer to purchase 48 acres of 
land in Marshall County, Ky., where the company
plans to build a state of the art stave mill. Once 
operational, the new facility will become the sixth 
American oak stave mill in the family-owned 
company’s portfolio and the seventh overall, as 
ISC also owns a large stave mill in France. The
new mill is expected to create approximately 40 
new jobs in the Marshall County community.


Speyside Bourbon Cooperage


In mid-July, just eight weeks into 
operations, Speyside plant 
management and employees 
reached a production goal by 
crafting 500 high-quality, oak barrels 
in one shift. With a 200,000-barrel-a-

poised to meet the growing demand 
of distillers and looks ahead at

Laurel County Barrel Maker Planning $20m 
Expansion


To make bourbon, you have to have barrels, 
and Kentucky distillers need a lot of them. 
To accommodate that demand, East 
Bernstadt Cooperage in Laurel County is 
considering a $20 million expansion. The 
Kentucky Economic Development Finance 
Authority on Thursday gave preliminary 
approval for up to $2.1m in tax incentives 
for the $20.2m project. According to the 
economic development report, the 
expansion would include the construction of 
a new facility to increase barrel production. 
The project would create 75 new jobs with 
average hourly wages (including employee 
benefits) of $15.05. 


From industry heavyweight Brown-Forman: “The reduction in underlying net (other) sales was due primarily to declines 


in used barrel sales reflecting lower prices and volumes as a result of weaker demand from blended Scotch industry 


buyers and pricing pressures due to increased supply of used barrels in the market. (Source: 10-Q p. 24, filed 12/7/16)

Rapid Aging Technologies Changing the 
Whiskey Industry


Spruce Point has always favored looking for non-consensus short ideas where investors are under-appreciating the 


risk of technology disruption. In the case of the whiskey and aged liquor business, there are new entrants offering 


the same craft spirit experience, but produced in significantly less time than the traditional three year aging process. 


Others such as Time & Oak, are offering a new technology kit to allow for home aging.


Anything that reduces the aging time to bring new whiskey to market is bearish for supply.


Technology That Produces More Whiskey Faster – CNBC August 2015


“With more modern technology than what's used in the traditional whiskey-making process, Cleveland, Ohio-based distiller 


Cleveland Whiskey has refined a proprietary scientific method. But thanks to his experimentation, his current process takes about 


a week from the beginning of production to bottling and shipping, compared with the years it takes using traditionally methods”

Case Study: Whiskey Will Follow The US Vodka Market, 
Which Became Saturated From Hundreds of Entrants


MGPI investors would be wise to learn from the recent history of the Vodka market for insights into what may happen 


in the whiskey market. The explosion of premium brands such as Grey Goose, Ciroc, Belvedere, Tito’s and countless 


others led to a saturation and maturation of sales in the vodka category. Consumer alcohol preferences are inherently 


fickle and constantly evolving, so while whiskey preference may be strong today, when tastes change it will leave a 


glut of brands and supply with few buyers.


Over-saturation in the US vodka market is blurring category boundaries and damaging sales of established 


premium and super-premium brands.


According to Pierre Pringuet, CEO of Pernod Ricard, the influx of “hundreds” of new vodka brands over the past few 


years has negatively impacted sales of the group’s premium vodka Absolut.


Depletions in the US during the 2013/14 financial year came in at -2%, causing overall volume sales of the brand to 


decline 4%.


“Let’s be honest, we are not pleased with the performance of Absolut in the US,” Pringuet said during a presentation 


of the French drinks group’s end-of-year financial presentation. “The reality is that there are several hundred new 


entrants in the market. Basically 99% or more of these brands will not survive, but the problem is that they do take 


market share.


Diageo meanwhile has witnessed a similar effect on Smirnoff and Ciroc, both of which recorded volume declines in 


the US of 4% and 3% during 2013/14.


Ivan Menezes, CEO of Diageo, said earlier this summer: “In the US what did happen is you’ve had a lot of 


competitive entry; I think there are over 200 brands or items that came into the market in the last two years”

Diageo Is A Material Customer That 
Could Disappear Fast


Date Warning From MGPI’s Credit Agreement


2nd Credit
Amendment 
Amendment


Feb 27, 2015


"Material Contract" means, collectively, (i) any contract or other agreement (other than 
the Loan Documents), whether written or oral, to which any Loan Party is a party that 
involves payments in an aggregate amount of more than $25,000,000 or as to which 
the breach, nonperformance, cancellation or failure to renew by any party thereto 
would have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) each Existing Supply Agreement and (iii) that 
certain Distillate Supply Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013 between Diageo Americas 
Supply, Inc. and MGPI Indiana.


Warning: MGPI does not include a risk factor related to the loss of Diageo’s 


business in its recent 10-K. However, a note in its credit agreement (below) 


suggests it is a “Material Contract” with an aggregate amount of more than $25m or 


approximately 7.8% of LTM sales.


Completion of Diageo’s new distillery in Shelbyville, KY is expected soon. Diageo has stated its facility has capacity 


for 1.8m proof gallon (750,000 9-liter cases). (1) Compare this with MGPI’s estimated 2.3m case production of rye 


whiskey and bourbon in 2015, and you can see why Diageo may no longer need MGPI’s distilling capacity. (2) 


A contract termination or modification by Diageo could have a material adverse effect on MGPI.

MGPI May Lose Customers As They 
Increase Their Own Distilling Capacity


Industry sources suggest that MGPI’s key customers are Diageo, High West, Sagamore Spirit and Templeton Rye. (1)


Each of these customers (as well as Terresentia) are adding their own production capacity and storage which suggests they may


no longer need to do business with MGPI.


Customer Here’s What They Are Doing


Diageo


October 2015: Crews broke ground on the $115 million project in August 2014. Located on an approximately 300 acre site, the 1.8 
million proof gallon distillery is on track to be up and running by the end of 2016. Along with Bulleit® Bourbon, the facility will 
produce a number of current and future Diageo bourbon and North American whiskey brands. Bulleit Distillery is midway through 
completion. The first completed warehouse is already holding barrels of bourbon. The warehouse is expected to be full by mid-
October. A second warehouse is nearing completion, and ground was broken on a third warehouse in September. Each has a 
capacity of 55,000 barrels.


High West October 2016: Acquired recently by Constellation Brands. The High West portfolio sells approximately 70,000 cases annually.


Templeton Rye
October 2016: Templeton Rye to add distillery at Iowa facility. Video states, “the company actually contracted the distilling portion 
to a separate company in Indiana (aka MGPI).” The Iowa Economic Development Authority approved last week what’s reported to 
be $1.6 million in tax credits to help facilitate a $26 million expansion and renovation of Templeton’s existing operations. (source)


Sagamore Spirit


July 2015: “While Sagamore’s ultimate plan is to produce its rye entirely at the Port Covington facility, its first batch was made at LDI 
(now known as MGP Ingredients), an industrial-sized distillery in Indiana. It has been aging for years there and in Kentucky.”
April 2016: Under Armour Founder and billionaire Kevin Plank gets into the whiskey business. The hope is to open the 22,000-
square-foot facility by the first quarter of next year.  “We’re going to be build a world-class facility and you’re eventually going to see 
the size and the scope of it. We will be able to compete at the highest levels when we, as a team, are ready to get there.”  


Luxco


May 2016: Invests $30m in a Bardstown distillery for whiskey/bourbon. The campus will include an 18,000-square-foot distillery and 
visitors’ center with a tasting room and event space. Additionally, Luxco will construct up to six barrel warehouses on its 70-acre site 
off State Highway 245. Construction will begin in the coming weeks with completion planned by late 2017. Luxco currently contract 
distills its bourbon brands – Rebel Yell, Ezra Brooks and Blood Oath – through relationships with other distilleries (aka MGPI)


Terresentia


June 2016: Bourbon distillery will begin producing bourbon next month. A grain handling system installation project is wrapping up. 
Crews have been working on it since January. Once that's complete, the bourbon will start flowing. We're told bourbon that was 
distilled in Indiana ( MGPI?) and aged in rickhouses at the O.Z. Tyler Distillery is already being sold at most Owensboro liquor stores. 
TerrePURE Kentucky Distillers has spent around $25m buying and renovating the 130 year old distillery.

Substantial New Whiskey Bourbon 
Capacity Coming To Market


Competitor Here’s What They Are Doing


Bardstown 
Bourbon


September 2016:  New distillery located on 100 acres in Kentucky. The facility is 37,000 sqft and cost $25m. The distillery has a 
1.5m gallon capacity at the moment, but it can and likely will be expanded to 6m without disturbing the current design. 
October 2016:  Constellation brands takes a minority stake in Bardstown. Commercial production started in September and it 
recently announced that it was preparing to expand its current 1.5m proof gallon capacity


Heaven Hill


Feb 2016: The bourbon and whiskey producer expects to start construction on a $15.5 million distillery expansion in Louisville and 
a $13.2 million warehouse expansion in Nelson County this spring. Both projects should be completed by 2017. In Nelson County, 
Heaven Hill is also constructing two new warehouses that will hold about 55,000 barrels each — taking the company's storage 
capacity up to more than 1.2 million barrels total. 


New Riff 
Distilling


June 2016: Plans $12.5m expansion. New Riff currently is aging 4,000 barrels in brick warehouses near the Licking River. The 
expansion will add capacity for 28,000 barrels and build a restaurant and taproom adjacent to the storage facility, according to
documents submitted to the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority


Maker’s Mark
Feb 2014: Maker's Mark announced a $67 million expansion on Thursday to meet booming demand for the Kentucky bourbon 
known for its iconic red wax top. The distillery will add a third still — an exact replica of its existing mirror-finish copper stills — to 
its historic still house in Loretto, increasing capacity by 50 percent, and build new warehouses to age the bourbon.


Wild Turkey
Sept 2013: Celebrated the grand opening of its $43m Packaging Facility at its KY Distillery. Since purchasing the brand in 2009, 
Gruppo Campari investment has surpassed more than $100m. In 2011, the Company unveiled a US$50 million expansion at the 
distillery, more than doubling the plant's production capabilities. 


Jack Daniels
Feb 2016: Tennessee whiskey giant Jack Daniel's is set to make a $140 million expansion to its distillery in Lynchburg, according to 
Gov. Bill Haslam and state economic officials.


Four Hills
June 2015: $55m expansion plan: $34m for a duplicate column still and more fermenters at the Lawrenceburg distillery and $21m 
for four new warehouses at Coxs Creek outside Bardstown. With the second column still, capacity is scheduled to increase to 
about 8 million proof-gallons (about 11.2 million regular gallons), enough to fill more than 211,000 barrels a year


Sazerac
April 2014: Sazerac is to spend $71m expanding its Buffalo Trace, The Glenmore and Barton 1792 distilleries in an attempt to 
meet demand for bourbon


Chattanooga 
Whiskey Co


July 2016:  46,00 sqft facility with room to house 4,000 aging barrels of bourbon whiskey. Plans also include over 10,000 square 
feet of production space, over 2,000 square feet of office space where Chattanooga Whiskey will be headquartered, and over 
4,000 square feet of future event space.

Case Study: MGPI Quietly Lost Significant 
Market Share In The Gin Category


Pay close attention to MGPI’s recent investor presentation. In the past year, MGPI changed the layout of the key slide 


that promotes its market share in key distillery products. In particular, we find that MGPI’s share of Gin plunged from 


65% to 35% in one year. The Company has not disclosed the impact of this loss in any of its SEC filings. MGPI also 


reclassified its “US Whiskey” category as “Bourbon” – which now includes three items (Bourbon, Tennessee 


Whiskey and Rye) and allowed them to portray their market share growing by 1%.

Seagram’s is the #1 Gin by market share in the U.S. according to Statistica and owned by Pernod Ricard.


If you look carefully at the label, you will notice bottles list Fort Smith, Arkansas 


It is very likely that Pernod shifted production away from MGPI’s Lawrenceburg, Indiana distillery to Arkansas

MGPI Has Significant Business Risks Into 
2017 Not Being Discounted


Key Risk Discussion Potential Impact and Spruce Point Risk Assessment


Diageo 
Americas


Supply, Inc.


Distillate supply agreement signed July 1, 2013. MGPI 
obscures the importance of this agreement by not 
disclosing it in its 10K/Q as a material contract, but we 
found evidence that suggest it accounts for upwards of 
8% of revenues


Very High:  With Diageo nearly complete its new $110m Bulleit distillery in 
Kentucky, it may no longer need to purchase any distillate from MGPI. This 
could be a material loss to the Company. Diageo has stated its facility will have 
capacity for 1.8m proof gallon (750,000 9-liter cases). Compare this with MGPI’s 
671,000 case production of rye whiskey in 2015 and observe that Diageo would 
no longer need MGPI’s distilling capacity. A contract termination or modification 
by Diageo could have a material adverse effect on MGPI.


Fibersym® 
Patent


MGPI’s key patent rights to Fibersym® expire in 2017. 
The company markets one of its specialty wheat 
starches under the Fibersym® Resistant Starch series


High: MGPI faces competition in this market which could lead to diminished 
returns and lower margins. It describes Fibersym as “one of our more popular 
specialty starches.” MGPI would face increased costs to defend the patent 
which could result in a material adverse effect on its business post 2017


Grain
Supply 


Contracts


Most of MGPI’s grain requirements are purchased from 
two suppliers, Bunge Milling and Consolidated Grain 
and Barge (CGB) – both contracts expire on December 
31, 2017. These contracts permit MGPI to purchase 
grain for delivery up to 12 months into the future at 
negotiated prices, based on a formula using several 
factors


High: Potentially disruptive impact if MGPI’s financial condition were to 
deteriorate further in 2017. The Company has $56.8m of purchase order 
commitments related to raw material and packaging as of 9/30/16. Grain supply 
counterparties could potentially tighten credit to MGPI and/or require cash 
collateral or shorten contract duration. MGPI is currently utilizing 46% of its 
revolver and has $0 cash on hand as of 9/30/16 placing it in a fragile financial 
condition


Collective 
Bargaining 
Agreement


A collective bargaining agreement covering 56 
employees at MGPI’s Lawrenceburg facility expires on 
December 31, 2017.


Medium: ~20% of its workforce is covered by this agreement.  A work 
stoppage/disruption could have a material adverse effect on MGPI. MGPI has 
recently had operational issues and work hazards. These problems could 
potentially give its unionized workers cause for concern and want greater safety 
protections 


TTB Audit
In 2016, MGPI disclosed that the regulators at the TTB 
have expanded their audit of MGPI and there have been 
“clerical errors” and “storage losses”


Medium:  MGPI has suggested it will have to pay penalties and taxes but claims 
it won’t be ‘material’ – investors should exercise caution and skepticism


Source: MGPI Financial Filings


Spruce Point believes investors are underpricing the risks faced by MGPI in 2017, some of which could have a 


material adverse effect on its financial condition

MGPI Is Baiting Investors With Hope of 
Big Profits Selling Aged Whiskey


MGPI is investing $29m to construct new warehouse capacity to allow clients to store and age its whiskey 


products. It also believes its $45m of inventory can be sold in a few years at prices in excess 3x book value. 


The problem with this argument is: 1) Substantial new whiskey capacity is coming online,


2) New technologies are emerging that allow distillers to age whiskey in under 1 week, and 3) The ‘great 


barrel shortage’ which restricted supply is likely to taper as supply/demand rebalance


MGPI hypes ability to store whiskey and sell for 3x value Whiskey Sitting Within Inventory Is Surging….

MGPI Has Virtually No Pricing Power


Most of MGPI’s whiskey and bourbon sales are white-label, and go through the bulk wholesale market.


We contacted Ultra Pure the #1 U.S. based bulk alcohol supplier which we believe acts as a broker that purchases 


supply from distillers such as MGPI, and resells to other industry participants.


What we found via our research is that prices are virtually unchanged in over two years. 


Some more information that has come my way. 


This is obviously MGP's whiskey, but the 


offering came from a broker, Ultra Pure. The 


pricing is in gallons, but there's a 500-gallon 


(one tote) minimum.

MGPI’s Foray Into Branded Whiskey A Long-
Shot To Succeed, With Limited Traction


MGPI tells investors that it will be able to transform itself into a purveyor of premium spirits. 


To date, it has introduced three brands, but Spruce Point sees limited traction or success, and MGPI hasn’t 


provided investors with more information to evaluate its performance (sales/marketing spend), or articulate 


the costs of establishing a national distribution plan.  


MGPI Brand Observations On Why It Has Limited Traction


Till Vodka 
(introduced 


March 2016)


Craft vodka category already a crowded market. Described as “super premium” yet sells for just 
$25/bottle. Limited availability in Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri. The brand has just 140 
Twitter followers, which suggests lack of traction or limited marketing effort


Metze’s Select 
(introduced July 


2015)


George Metze, MGPI’s master distiller, mysteriously resigned in May 2016 less than 1yr after the 
brand was launched. According to the website, only 6,000 bottles were made and sold at 
$75/bottle = max sales of $450,000. As a review states, “At nearly $75 a pop, this bourbon will have 
to prove it’s worth the price tag.”


George Remus 
(acquired Nov 


2016)


Undisclosed purchase price. Sold to MGPI by three co-founders who created the product as a part-
time endeavor while working full time jobs at E.W. Scripps and Proctor & Gamble. Available in Ohio, 
Kentucky and Indiana. The brand has Just a few hundred Twitter followers which suggests limited 
traction or marketing effort. Available for $45/bottle. It’s stated that MGPI was supplying the 
whiskey and aging the barrels, so MGPI is really just acquiring the brand

examples of failures across all liquor categories. In particular, having a liquor brand backed by a deep-


pocketed billionaire, future president, or celebrity musician does not guarantee success. In the table below, 


we illustrate examples of failed forays into branded spirits.  We don’t believe MGPI has fully articulated to 


investors how much it has spent, and will commit to spending, to market and grow its three brands.

Limited R&D and Patent Expiration Risk


As a producer of commodity products and ingredients, MGPI has to constantly innovate to maintain a 


competitive advantage against its larger peers that have substantially more resources and can easily out-


spend it. MGPI holds very few patents, but as we highlighted earlier, its key patent rights to Fibersym® is 


set to expire in 2017 and could have a material adverse effect on margins.

A Terrible Business With No Margin For 
Error In the Whiskey Expansion Plan…


Cumulative Free Cash Flow of Just $1.5m Since 2012 Worrisome Rise in Credit Revolver Dependency


$ in mm $ in mm


Source:  MGPI SEC filings


MGPI has a weak financial profile that cannot fund its own growth. Its cumulative free cash flow since 2012 is just 


$1.5 million! As a result, MGPI is becoming more dependent on short-term revolving credit borrowings. It has made 


a bold bet that expanding its warehouse capacity to grow its whiskey business will pay off. If it fails to achieve its 


goals, the Company will be burdened with a record debt load and no cash on hand.

Warning: Inconsistencies Suggesting 
Potential Revenue Overstatement


As another subtle indicator of potential financial issues, we suggest investors look closely at MGPI’s 


revenue recognition disclosures of customer paid freight costs included in sales. The YTD 2016 results are 


not adding up, and 2015 results are retroactively being revised higher.


2016 Disclosures of Customer Paid Freight Costs Included In Sales

Sales include customer paid freight costs billed to customers for the quarters ended September 30, 


2016 and 2015 of $3,599 and $3,614, respectively, and $10,272 and $11,068 for the year to date periods 


ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Q3’16 10-Q, p. 8


2015 Disclosures of Customer Paid Freight Costs Included In Sales


Customer-paid freight costs are included in Sales and were $3,552 and $3,672 for the quarters ended June 30, 


2015 and 2014, respectively, and $6,951 and $7,162 for the year to date periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, 


respectively. Q2’15 10-Q, p. 9


Customer-paid freight costs are included in Sales and were $3,138 and $3,237 for the quarters ended September 


30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $10,088 and $10,400 for the year to date periods ended September 30, 2015 


and 2014, respectively. Q3’15 10-Q, p. 8


Notice the YTD 2015/2016 numbers

Warning: Inventory Turnover In Rapid Decline


With stagnant sales, MGPI’s inventory turnover has been falling for many quarters, and yet its gross margins 


are near record highs. The Company does not disclose how much older and higher margin whiskey may be 


sold off to support current margins. MGPI has also attributed recent gross margin increases to “plant 


efficiencies,” but then had a chemical hazard, which sent innocent people to the hospital a month later.

MGPI’s Liquidity Is Worse Than It Appears


MGPI states in its Annual Report the following in its discussion of inventory accounting: “Bourbon and 


whiskeys are normally aged in barrels for several years, following industry practice; all barreled bourbon 


and whiskey is classified as a current asset.”  But wait a second, how can an asset that is intended to be 


held for more than a year be classified as current? A current asset is generally defined as an item that can 


be converted to cash with one year. (1)  By adjusting MGPI’s balance sheet to remove the effect of long-term 


whiskey holdings, and include off-balance sheet purchase order commitments, we observe that its liquidity 


(as measured by its current ratio) to be significantly worse than it appears on the surface.

Something Doesn’t Make Sense To Us


Spruce Point doesn’t understand how MGPI’s distillery margins increased 310 bps YTD when its segment sales 


declined by 2.1%. The Company says the increase is from:  “the continuing shift in sales mix within food grade 


alcohol from lower margin industrial alcohol products to higher margin premium beverage alcohol products, a decline 


in input costs, and an increase in warehouse revenue.” Looking carefully, we find a speculative explanation in the 


press release, but MGPI cannot commit to put it in its 10-Q SEC filing…..why?


Source: MGPI Q3’16 10-Q, p. 25


Warning: Carefully notice 


that MGPI doesn’t put the 


break-out of “Premium 


Beverage Alcohol” in its 10-Q 


SEC Filing. Yet, in its Q3’16 


press release it boasts that 


industrial alcohol fell -22.9% 


YTD while premium 


beverage increased +16.7% 


Given the significant increase 


in margin, management 


should give more disclosure 


here.

Annual
Report


Here’s What MGPI Says Here’s What Seacor Holdings Says


2015
ICP’s net sales includes related party sales to MGPI 
of $40,787, $35,613, and $7,736 for 2015, 2014, 
and 2013, respectively. (10-K, p. 51)


During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the 
Company sold $38.9 million, $36.3 million and $6.6 million, 
respectively to the noncontrolling interest partner. As of December 
31, 2015 and 2014, ICP had accounts receivable of $2.4 million and 
$3.3 million from the noncontrolling interest partner.   
(10-K, p. 131)


2014


Includes related party sales to MGPI of $34,615 and 
$7,736 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 
2013, respectively.


During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the 
Company sold $36.3 million, $6.6 million and $44.8 million, 
respectively to the noncontrolling interest partner. As of December 
31, 2014 and 2013, ICP had accounts receivable of $3.3 million and 
$1.8 million from the noncontrolling interest partner. (10-K, p. 73)


MGPI’s reported purchases from ICP (its related-party JV where it owns 30%) are explicitly contradicted by the 


majority owner, Seacor (NYSE: CKH). Seacor has generally reported less sales to MGPI than MGPI claims. We can 


understand why MGPI might report slightly higher purchases than Seacor (e.g. shipping costs), but don’t understand 


why in any case they would be reported lower as in 2014.

Has MGPI Violated Its Credit Agreement?


Date Negative Covenant


2nd 
Amendment 


Feb 27, 2015


6.8  Accounting Methods. Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, modify or 
change its fiscal year or its method of accounting (other than as may be required to conform to 
GAAP).


6.10 Transactions with Affiliates: Each Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its 
Subsidiaries or Parent to, directly or indirectly, enter into or permit to exist any transaction with 
any Affiliate of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except for:


(e) purchases of Inventory by any Borrower from the Illinois Joint Venture so long as such 
purchases are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to such Borrower than would be obtained in an 
arm's length transaction with a non-Affiliate, and


The quiet restatement of figures without explanation for both a) MGPI’s related-party purchases from ICP, and 


b) Customer paid freight costs included in sales has Spruce Point worried about the potential that MGPI could 


be: 1) Misstating purchase figures from ICP at off-market prices to boost margins, 2) overstating revenues, or 


3) Making an undisclosed change in accounting method. Either scenario would be bad and is expressly listed 


as a Negative Covenant according to its Credit Agreement

Other Credit Implications


Key Credit Issue Terms and Conditions


Fixed Charges


"Fixed Charges" means, with respect to any fiscal period and with respect to Parent determined on a consolidated 
basis in accordance with GAAP, the sum, without duplication, of (a) Interest Expense accrued (other than interest 
paid-in-kind, amortization of financing fees, and other non-cash Interest Expense) during such period, (b) principal 
payments in respect of Indebtedness that are required to be paid during such period, including without limitation 
required all reductions of the Fixed Asset Sub-Line Amount, and (c) all federal, state, and local income taxes accrued 
during such period, and (d) all Restricted Payments paid (whether in cash or other property, other than common 
Equity Interests) during such period; provided, however, that solely for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge 
Coverage Ratio for determining compliance with Section 7.1 hereof, the amount of the September 2015 Stock 
Repurchase shall not constitute a Fixed Charge.


"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio" means, with respect to any fiscal period and with respect to Parent determined on a 
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, the ratio of (i) EBITDA for such period minus unfinanced Capital 
Expenditures made (to the extent not already incurred in a prior period) or incurred during such period, to (ii) Fixed 
Charges for such period.


Borrowing Base


(e)    Mandatory Prepayments.
(v)    Borrowing Base. If, at any time, (A) the Revolver Usage on such date exceeds (B) the Borrowing Base 
reflected in the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered by Borrowers to Agent, then Borrowers 
shall immediately prepay the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.3(f)(i) in an aggregate amount equal to 
the amount of such excess.


Investors should pay careful attention to MGPI’s credit agreement. It has a fixed charge covenant and requires 


mandatory pre-payments if the revolver usage exceeds the borrowing base. The covenant ratio would be 


impacted heavily if MGPI’s EBITDA declines (from possible customer losses we highlighted) or tax penalties 


increase (from the TTB audit). The borrowing base is increasingly being driven by MGPI’s barreled whiskey 


distillate. To the extent its whiskey value declines or ‘storage losses’ result in lost inventory, MGPI’s borrowing 


base would shrink and mandatory prepayment risk increases

Newly Disclosed TTB Audit Investigation 
Also Looks Negative


Date of
Disclosure


Expanded Disclosure Statements


10-K
Mar 10, 2016


“The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau ("TTB") performed a federal excise tax audit of the 
Company’s subsidiaries, MGPI of Indiana, LLC and MGPI Processing, Inc., for the periods January 1, 
2012 through July 31, 2015 and January 1, 2013 through July 31, 2015, respectively. The 
Company is in the process of addressing the preliminary findings of the TTB audit regarding 
clerical errors and support for storage losses. The Company is unable to determine the 
probability that additional excise tax and penalties will be owed and cannot reasonably estimate 
the amount thereof. However, the Company believes it is probable that a penalty may be 
imposed by the TTB as a result of certain TTB audit findings but it is unable to reasonably 
estimate the amount thereof. Management expects that the aggregate liabilities, if any, arising 
from such legal and regulatory proceedings, including the TTB audit, would not have a material 
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.”

Mar 12, 2015


“We are currently being audited by the TTB for the period from December 27, 2011 to November 
30, 2014. The outcome of this audit is unknown at this time.”


MGPI started to disclose an audit by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau (TTB) in 2015, 


and its recent 2016 disclosure suggests that the scope of the audit has increased to additional 


time periods. Furthermore, MGPI has acknowledged that “clerical errors” and support for 


“storage loss” will result in additional taxes and penalties. Are investors comfortable that these 


added costs won’t be material as management tries to suggest?

Valuation and Price Target

Bulls Have Aspirational Dreams MGPI Can 
Be Valued Like a Beverage Company


The bulls aspirational hopes are that MGPI will successfully transition from a commodity ingredient producer to a 


fully branded spirits company, and achieve a significantly higher multiple. As a result, they try to justify the current 


$50 price target on a multiple that MGPI doesn’t deserve. We believe its transition will fail miserably, and that 


investors will re-value it back in line with commodity ingredients peers at approximately 1x sales and 2x book value. 


The bulls also ignore the fact that MGPI’s common stock is subordinate to the preferred stock, which is controlled by 


the Seaberg family, and has special voting rights and controls a majority of the Board votes.

If You Want Whiskey/Bourbon Exposure 
Look At Castle Brands As A Comp….


MGPI’s valuation is more expensive than Diageo, Constellation, and Brown Forman, yet it has no proven and firmly 


established brands! Also, investors that want to make a pure-play investment in the whiskey/bourbon markets 


(without any manufacturing risks) could look at Castle Brands (AMEX: ROX).


While we are not recommending an investment in Castle Brands, it’s instructive to see that it trades at just 1.5x 


revenues and has over $65m of sales growing mid single digits. 


Compare this valuation to MGPI which is trading at 2.5x sales and has de Minimis branded sales but claims 


“premium beverage alcohol” sales are growing 16% but won’t certify it with figures in its 10-Q.

Spruce Point Intermediate View vs. 2017/18 Street View Spruce Point Intermediate Term Price Reference Ranges


Spruce Point believes that 2017/18 could be a major re-set year for MGPI’s earnings and valuation. We 


believe the biggest catalyst will be loss of revenues associated with Diageo and a normalizing expectation 


of profits associated with selling whiskey and bourbon. Additional headwinds on the horizon include the 


loss of sales associated with Fibersym® whose patent expires in 2017.
