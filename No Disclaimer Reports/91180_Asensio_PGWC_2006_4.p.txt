Is Pegasus indicted


Taiwanese collaborator


backing out?


On July 17, 2006 Pegasus Wireless Corporation (NASDAQ:


PGWC, $7.00) announced that its Board had approved a


“voluntary exchange” that will reduce “Pegasus’ issued and


outstanding shares by approximately 45 million.”


Judging from Pegasus’ long history of numerous


questionable and erratic transactions that at least twice


wiped-out its shareholders, Pegasus’ uninformed stock


promoter, the NASDAQ, who last week featured the


company as a growth stock, and PGWC’s shareholders,


should be greatly concerned about exactly what is being


exchanged and whose shares are going to be reduced.


PGWC went public in 2000 by raising $322,900 from a group


of 38 foreign individuals and two o�-shore companies.


Since then, Pegasus has twice issued stock for acquisitions,


only to have the acquired companies completely fail, and


then twice went inactive, including once as a result of an


alleged burglary; cancelled 7,125,000 shares owned by its


shareholders and paid them no consideration for their


cancelled shares; agreed to issue 9,000,000 shares and then


cancelled the agreement; issued 3,000,000 shares for an


acquisition and then voided the transaction; belatedly issued

3,623,088 shares to stockholders of an acquired company


that claimed they had been unable to get their certi�cates in


time; had shareholders of an acquisition return 381,000


shares of its stock after the deal was closed and even


e�ected a merger with another public shell.


These irregular transactions were audited by three di�erent


auditors, none of which are well-known to say the least.


These include an audit �rm owned by the company’s own


Chief Financial O�cer, who himself lost his CPA license in the


State of North Carolina.


These highly material, and equally questionable,


transactions a�ect both the assets and the ownership claims


that investors rely upon to value their shares. Without


reliable disclosures about such basic �nancial data on how


many shares are outstanding, who owns them and what the


company received in exchange for issuing these shares,


investors should be asking how can these PGWC shares be


allowed to trade, much less how could the NASDAQ allow


PGWC to ring the bell and promote such a company on its


website?
