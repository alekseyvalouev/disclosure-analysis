BLACK STORK RESEARCH 


INVESTMENT THESIS ON WOLVERINE WORLDWIDE (NYSE: WWW) 


We are short Wolverine Worldwide. Despite unusually warm winter, a looming disaster at Sperry brand 


and numerous accounting shenanigans, market has not adjusted expectations over the past quarter and 


remains overly optimistic about the company into 2020. In our view, the opportunity into earnings is 


highly asymmetrical. We see a high chance of missing Q4 revenue/earnings estimates, an impairment at 


Sperry and a weak 2020 guidance (many of the risks we mention pass into 2020). 


We discuss our thesis below: 


1) Unusually warm winter is bad for WWW's boots business. Boots are seasonally a large part of WWW 


sales in Q4 and Q1 as per management (Q3 2019 call):  


 WWW CEO Blake W. Krueger:  


o We think boot momentum is going to continue throughout Q4. But over the last several 


years, boots have also become an increasingly important item category for retailers and 


us in the first quarter. 


o And when we see comp sales up the way that they are in our own stores, the performance 


of Sperry boots, which obviously you know is an important category for us in the 


quarter, our Merrell stores are performing well, our eComm business is trailing ahead of 


plan a little bit. 


o We think boots are going to continue to be very important again in the second part of 


the year. 


Company's brands which have substantial boot business are Sperry (2nd largest brand), Merrell (the 


largest brand) and Wolverine (4th largest brand). Boots account for 45-50% of Sperry sales in the back 


half of the year as per sell-side estimates. Q4 2019 guidance is based on expectations of strong 


performance in boots category. 


2) Fashion risk has materialized at Sperry brand: duck boots are out of fashion this season (WWW's 


Sperry brand is one of two market leaders in this category).

8 OUTDATED WINTER BOOT TRENDS WE'RE DITCHING—AND WHAT WE'RE BUYING INSTEAD 


Ditching: Duck boots 


Buying: Thick-sole styles 


https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/outdated-winter-boot-trends/slide2 


The chart below (left chart) shows interest in duck boots scaled vs overall interest in boots as per Google 


trends - duck boots category started to lose mind share in early Nov 2019 - right after Q3 2019 earnings 


call. Consumer interest in “Sperry boots” (right chart) virtually copies dynamics of interest in “Duck boots”. 


Management’s projections did not account for this change in fashion trend.

“Sperry shoes” scaled vs “boat shoes” a key product category for Sperry brand. The dynamics shows

"Sperry shoes"/"Boat shoes" (13W 
average, yoy, US)

Recent weak performance of Sperry brand makes a massive impairment almost inevitable. This is what 


company disclosed in their 2018 10-K: 


If the operating results for Sperry® were to decline in future periods, the Company may need to 


record an additional non-cash impairment charge. The carrying value of the Company’s Sperry® 


trade name indefinite-lived intangible asset was $518.2 million as of December 29, 2018. 


WWW reiterated this disclosure in Q1-Q3 2019 reports. 


4) Unexpected departure of the President of Sperry Brand Tom Kennedy 5 days before WWW earnings. 


He was transferred from Sperry (company's 2nd largest brand) to Wolverine (company's 4th largest brand) 


in what looks like a demotion and was replaced with a person from outside the company. 


5) We note numerous accounting shenanigans designed to boost earnings in the short-term period. 


 Increased useful lives for Property, plant and equipment since FY 2015, which reduced 


depreciation expense and boosted earnings by $7.5M in 2018 and $8.8M in 9M 2019. 


 Reduced revenue reserves in 9M 2019 which boosted revenue/earnings by $6.5M; 


 Released $6.0M or LIFO reserve in 2017 and additional $4.6M in 2018 


 Reduced inventory write-downs in 9M 2019: 


o Disclosure on gross margin in MD&A section of Q3 2019 10-Q: The decrease in the first 


three quarters of 2019 resulted from unfavorable product mix and business model 


changes for certain international wholesale customers, partially offset by the acquisition 


of a distributor in Italy, a higher mix of higher gross margin consumer-direct revenue and 


reduced markdowns. 


 Reduced accounts receivable reserves which boosted earnings by $18.3M in 2018 and by $11.7M 


in 9M 2019. 


Below is the summary of accounting shenanigans employed by WWW:

* Depreciation expense for 9M 2019 is our estimate, as company does not disclose depreciation expense separately 


from Depreciation and amortization expense 


In our view, aggressive accounting techniques boosted operating earnings by at least 14% in 9M 2019 as 


compared to assumptions used in FY 2015. The actual impact could be larger as we do not know 


whether the company released LIFO reserve in FY 2019 or what was the impact of lower inventory write-


downs. 


Numerous attempts to hide deteriorating core business is further supported by frequent changes of 


business segments structure. Company reshuffled its business segments in Q1 2018 and once again in 


Q1 2019. 


Q1 2018: The Company’s portfolio of brands is organized into the following three operating 


segments, which the Company has determined to be reportable operating segments. During the 


first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Kids footwear business was realigned into the Wolverine

Boston Group and the multi-brand consumer-direct component is now reported within the 


other category. All prior period disclosures have been restated to reflect these new reportable 


operating segments. 


Q1 2019: The Company’s portfolio of brands is organized into the following two operating 


segments, which the Company has determined to be reportable operating segments. During the 


first quarter of 2019, the brands that were formerly aligned with the Wolverine Outdoor & 


Lifestyle Group and Wolverine Heritage Group were realigned into a new operating segment, 


the Wolverine Michigan Group. The change was to align our brands under key leadership to 


best support innovation and efficiency. All prior period disclosures have been restated to reflect 


these new reportable operating segments. 


6) Management is short-term oriented and puts a lot of pressure on employees to hit internal 


projections as per employee reviews on glassdoor.com and indeed.com. Such pressure to meet the 


numbers puts company at risk of accounting misstatements. 





Despite warm weather, a looming disaster at Sperry brand and numerous accounting shenanigans, market 


has not adjusted expectations over the past quarter and remains overly optimistic about the next year. 


As per Factset Q4 2019 revenue estimate stands at $613M vs management’s guidance of $615M. 


In our view, the opportunity into earnings is highly asymmetrical. We see a high chance of missing Q4 


revenue/earnings estimates, an impairment at Sperry and a weak 2020 guidance (some of the risks we 


mentioned pass into 2020): 


 Warm weather - weak sales of boots in Q1 2020; 


 Fashion risk at Sperry duck boots category continuing into 2020 (Q1 2020 and Q4 2020); 


 Market share loss by Sperry in its key category - boat shoe; 


 Management has high expectations for growth in China - announced a partnership with Chinese 


company Xtep in early 2019 with very ambitious plans for expansion. Given outbreak of 


Coronavirus, these plans for China will have to be reviewed/postponed.  


 We believe management has limited opportunities to keep boosting earnings through aggressive 


accounting practices.
