- The Wire, season 5 episode 84  
 
In the following excerpt of a June 2012 conversation, EDU president and CFO Louis Hsieh is either 
lying or demonstrating that he is being lied to.  As we show in this report, it is indisputable that EDU 
has an extensive franchising operation.  It is virtually certain that EDU has been consolidating the 
financials of its franchisees into its own financials. 
 
We encourage investors to listen to the recording of this conversation at

Q: “Do you franchise any of your stores?” 
 
Hsieh: “No.  No.  Our biggest asset, the reason our moat is so large is cause of our brand name.

Introduction 
 
New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (“EDU”) is lying to shareholders about its store 
growth and financial performance.  As is typical of many of the frauds we have witnessed in China, 
how EDU actually conducts its business differs materially from what it tells investors.  Inside China, 
EDU has an extensive and long-standing franchising operation.  We know this because we have 
listened to discussions between EDU and a potential franchisee.  Outside China, EDU’s president / 
CFO Louis Hsieh vehemently denies the existence of any franchising or financial sharing arrangements 
whatsoever.   
 
We have evidence that EDU’s franchising operation covers dozens of cities, including its original Tier 
1 markets, and that the franchising includes both POP Kids and traditional format stores.  However, 
EDU has never disclosed any information related to franchising.  It is virtually certain that EDU uses 
the front-end weighted franchise fees it receives to game its cash balance confirmation during its audit.  
It is also virtually certain that EDU consolidates its franchisees’ results as though they were EDU’s 
own.  This has a number of other implications for numbers reported since going public in September 
2006, including: 
 


• 37.0% revenue CAGR built on 29.1% store count CAGR from FY2006 to FY2011. 
•  Capital expenditures since going public of approximately $104 million. 
• 19.5% enrollment CAGR. 
• 41.0% teacher and 39.8% non-teacher employee count CAGRs. 


2 of 96
• 56.8% net cash balance CAGR.5 
 


How large is EDU’s franchise network?  The fact that EDU is lying about whether it has franchises – a 
fundamental aspect of its business model – implies that franchising is a big problem for EDU.  After 
researching EDU’s franchising for six months, including having chilling encounters with China’s spy 
agency, we have our baseline count of franchises; but, our count might understate the extent.  Therefore 
in this report, we are going to prove only that EDU is lying – that it is in fact franchising.  We will give 
EDU the opportunity to come to the market confessional and admit to investors what is really going on.  
Should we find any inaccuracies at that point, we reserve the right to publicly release more information 
on EDU’s franchise network. 
 
EDU’s financial statements for its Beijing operation are fraudulent because they show tax treatment 
that is impossible.  We have obtained a legal opinion from a PRC tax expert to this effect.  It is 
probable that the fraudulent financials have contaminated EDU’s SEC filings.  Interestingly, EDU’s 
2011 audit fee was 32% lower than in 2007, despite having increased its (purported) store base by 
195% during this time.6  Further, EDU’s 2011 audit fee was the lowest of its peer group (AMBO, XRS, 
XUE, and CAST)7 despite EDU’s purported operations being significantly larger than the others.  
Because the evidence of hidden franchising and fraudulent financials is overwhelming, it is probable 
that EDU will restate historical earnings.  It is also probable that EDU’s auditor, Deloitte, will resign.     
 
We see EDU’s historical reported gross margin of over 60% as being far in excess of what is possible.  
Our discussions with non-publicly traded companies indicated that store level gross margins (i.e., prior 
to allocating corporate overhead to the stores) in Tier 1 cities generally top out at 30%, and in Tier 2-3 
cities generally top out at 20%.  The limitations on gross margin have to do with when customers are 
actually available to take classes – generally only weekday evenings and weekend days.  During most 
of official business hours, capacity utilization is quite low.  There are therefore limits to how efficiently 
one education company can manage its utilization and thus its gross margin.   
 
Because of EDU’s obsession with store count, we suspect that relatively few of its stores reach the 30% 
margin levels in Tier 1 cities or 20% margin levels in Tier 2-3 cities.  During our fieldwork over the 
past six months, we observed some Tier 1 city stores that only offered classes one day each weekend, 
indicating that utilization is poor.  In other words, we feel that a number of EDU’s stores are there more 
for show than for profit. 
 
EDU has had an oddly symbiotic relationship with the other publicly-traded China education 
companies, most of which also seem highly questionable.  (See infra EDU and its Public Comps: Too 
Good to be True.)  The entire group generates a positive feedback loop of suspect financial 
performance for each of its members, with three of the four members reporting gross margins 
approaching 50%+.  We are skeptical though.  We found that TAL Education Group (NYSE: XRS), 
which shares pre-IPO investor pedigree with EDU and fraud blow-up Longtop Financial Technologies; 
and Ambow Education Ltd. (NYSE: AMBO) have a number of red flags as well.  The public company 
for which we have the greatest faith in reported financials is Xueda Education Company (NYSE: XUE). 
XUE reports overall gross margins of “only” 29.5% (after reporting significantly lower margins in

2011 fees.

prior years).  The reality is that the for profit education industry suffers from the competitive 
difficulties that afflict most businesses in China – low barriers to entry that spawn numerous copycat 
businesses, and result in greatly reduced margins due to commoditization of the product.   
 
Muddy Waters is not the first firm to conclude that EDU is committing fraud.  In November 2011, OLP 
Global LLC (“OLP”) released two reports to its clients that postulate EDU has overstated profits by 
over 50% between FY 2007 and FY 2010 by failing to eliminate intercompany transactions.8  EDU 
defended itself by pointing to its audited cash balances.  EDU’s November 20, 2011 press release 
response stated in part: 
 


“For OLP Global’s allegations to hold an indicia of credibility or logic, its report would need to 
demonstrate a US$137 million shortfall in New Oriental’s cash balance from the Company’s 
alleged overstating of net income…”9 
 


Understanding that franchise fees have most likely been disguised as company cash and consolidating 
results from franchisees would be a good start toward demonstrating the shortfall.  As Peregrine 
Financial Group showed us just last week, little more than an inkjet printer and P.O. box are needed to 
forge hundreds of millions of dollars of cash balances in the U.S.  Given EDU’s cash balance numbers 
are unreliable, it appears the Company needs another rebuttal.  Unfortunately, EDU did not attempt to 
rebut some of the more specific allegations in the OLP reports.   
 
We cannot reliably value EDU without more information.  In our view, it is probable that EDU will 
have a substantial restatement.  The evidence of significant wrongdoing is so compelling and will likely 
lead EDU’s auditor, Deloitte, to numerous other problematic discoveries.  We therefore think that an 
auditor resignation is probable.   
 
Perhaps the most twisted aspect of the EDU story is its corporate structure.  Because EDU is a VIE, 
EDU shareholders of course do not own the operating company – Chairman Yu does.  (See infra 
EDU’s VIE: All Hat and No Cattle)  The VIE structure provides a significant opportunity for 
management to abuse shareholders.  EDU’s VIE lacks many standard VIE investor protections, which 
we believe reflects management’s bad faith.  Even stranger, the schools the VIEs established do not 
actually belong to the VIE.  By PRC law, these schools “not requiring reasonable returns” belong to the 
government, with the assets (including retained earnings) belonging to the state upon windup.  EDU’s 
ultimate valuation should reflect that the Company structure is a VIE that consolidates schools 
ultimately belonging to the state.   
 
For retail investors who missed out on the opportunity to buy CDO-squareds while jealously watching 
Icelandic pension funds snatch them up, you can buy your very own piece of financial engineering 
through EDU shares.

EDU’s current franchising focus is on POP Kids stores.  Parents of young children are the least price-
sensitive market segment, and thus EDU’s brand is the most valuable in this segment.  (For discussion 
of the commoditization of EDU’s other store formats, see EDU and its Public Comps in China: Too 
Good to be True).  If one goes to the POP Kids “About Us” web page 
(pop.xdf.cn/about/201112/30998560.html), one will see information on how to “cooperate” with EDU 
(i.e. become a franchisee).  Below is the application process from the website.

“…in our franchise area, you are solely responsible for your own profits and losses. We won’t 
get overly involved in the daily operations and personnel management. If you want, we can give 
you some advises on staff selections. But we will not hire people for you…” 
 
“…The franchise fee is like this, the franchise fee is different depending on various regions. 
And it’s evaluated based on several factors, the average staff salary, the GDP, the economic 
environment, the future developments and the geographical location, etc. There is also an 
overall evaluation of the city. This is why there was an initial understanding and simple 
discussion over the phone. After that, there would be an overall evaluation of the city, including 
an evaluation of the future site selection, evaluation of your personal abilities, your degree of 
enthusiasm for education, and other major factors. Finance is also part of the criteria…” 
 
“No matter how many branches you open, it’s charged as one school. For instance, if you ace 
our preliminary examination, reexamination, final examination and defense, and if we do decide 
to give you the authorization, your first school would always be the standard regardless of the 
number of branches. New Oriental always charges fees based on the size of the first school.”

“…This certainly is the difference between joining a franchise and building your own business. 
This part will grow and develop into a system…” 
 “We sign the contract for three years. This fee covers three years only. After three years, we 
may raise or lower the fee based on your status. Because beginners only get authorized to teach 
the English subject, if they are doing a good job and want to have math and Chinese literature 
and language, they’ll need to pay extra.”  
 
“...A franchise school has different conditions and space for development. They’re not things 
that we have control over on our part, do you understand?...” 


 
Material Franchise Terms 
 
We viewed a POP Kids franchise agreement.  EDU’s franchising terms seem designed to perpetuate the 
EDU myth by maximizing store base growth to justify breakneck reported revenue and profit growth.   
Our analysis is that the franchise contract strikes the right balance for a company concerned far more 
with store base growth than with profits.   
 
The upfront amount EDU charges ensures that the franchisee has demonstrated some business acumen 
(by virtue of having access to such funds), and has some skin in the game.  Both of these factors lessen 
the risk that the franchisees fail to grow their store counts.  Further, EDU’s franchise agreement 
requires franchisees to open at least one new store per year, and penalizes them for not growing, 
despite such growth providing little (direct) financial benefit to EDU. 
  
EDU seems reluctant to use the word “franchise” in the agreement.  (It prefers the Chinese word for 
“cooperation”.)  However, the substance of the agreement is clearly that of a franchise.  The following 
are some of the terms from the franchise agreement.  A translation of the agreement is in the Appendix. 
 


• The franchisee pays EDU several types of upfront fees and a security deposit.  These fees are 
charged on a per-city basis,   


o The franchisee pays EDU a trademark license fee of RMB 600,000 to RMB one million 
for three years per city.  After the three-year period expires, then franchisees will pay 
approximately 5% of revenue annually. 


o The franchisee pays EDU a technical training support fee of RMB 80,000 per city per 
subject.  The available subjects are English, Chinese, and math.   


o The franchisee pays EDU a performance guarantee deposit (security deposit) of RMB 
100,000. 


• The franchisee is responsible for capital expenditures, operating expenses, and staffing.  This 
sharply calls into question the reported $49.1 million in capital expenditures and 5,928 part and 
full-time employees added in FY2011. 


• The franchisee owns all of the tangible assets and is responsible for the liabilities of the 
business.  Obviously, EDU does not own these stores. 


• The franchisee has the exclusive rights to own and operate POP Kids in a given city, and may 
only operate an EDU-affiliated education business within that territory.  This is a typical 
franchising provision. 


• The franchisee has rights to use the POP Kids and New Oriental trademarks subject to 
restrictions.  Mr. Hsieh has talked about not franchising in order to protect EDU’s brand.  
Evidently the brand is not as much of a consideration as EDU leads investors to believe. 


8 of 96
• The agreement penalizes franchisees RMB 100,000 if they do not open one new store per year.  
As previously mentioned, the trademark license fee is per city, not per store.  Therefore, the 
additional fees franchisees must pay to EDU for new stores are de minimis.10  


• Franchisees must open an initial store with a minimum size of 1,000 m2 (11,000 ft2).  Each 
additional store must be a minimum size of 500 m2 (5,500 ft2).11  In June 2012, Hsieh has said 
the following to an investor regarding EDU’s expansion strategy – in particular with respect to 
the 81 learning centers EDU claims to have opened in Q32012:  


 
“What typically happens, the pattern is, we go into a city, we’ll open up large learning 
centers first, fifteen hundred square meter ones.  Then we’ll open up five hundred to one 
thousand square meter ones in the, in the second sort of ring, you know second set of 
large schools.”     


 
Store base growth has always been the lynchpin of the EDU myth.  The following quotes illustrate its 
importance – and thus why EDU engaged in the risky behavior of seeking franchisees while concealing 
this side of its business from investors. 
 


“What [opening 81 learning centers in Q3 2012] should tell you guys is that our business is so 
strong in one-on-one and kids that we’re opening up a lot more centers than we normally 
would.” – Louis Hsieh to an investor in June 2012.   
 


How Extensive is EDU’s Franchising? 
 
We have evidence that EDU’s franchising goes back to before its IPO, is prevalent in Tier 1 cities, and 
includes numerous traditional (i.e., non-POP Kids) and POP Kids stores.  We are allowing EDU the 
opportunity to come clean on its franchising in response to our report.  Should we find that 
management is still not being truthful, we reserve the right to further discredit them.

II. Sharpen the Pencils, Cook the Books, No More Investors’ Dirty Looks 
 
EDU’s Beijing operation submitted financial statements to its PRC regulator that are highly likely to be 
fraudulent.  It is probable that these financials contaminated EDU’s U.S. filings.  Further, it is also 
virtually certain that EDU is consolidating its franchised stores as though they were its own.  The 
upfront fees EDU collects from franchisees are almost certainly used to help it game the cash balance 
confirmation portion of its annual audit.  SAIC financials for the EDU entities that collect licensing 
revenue from EDU’s stores declined from 2008 to 2010, which implies that EDU’s overall revenue 
decreased during this time, rather than growing at a reported CAGR of 33.7%.12  We believe that the 
quality of EDU’s audits is poor for two reasons.  First, EDU paid 31.9% less for its FY2011 audit than 
for its FY2007 audit, despite having 195% more stores.  (FY2007 was EDU’s first fiscal year end as a 
public company.)  Second, EDU is claiming tax exemptions that are clearly inapplicable.  These false 
exemption claims are a red flag that should have alerted Deloitte. 
 
EDU is a For Profit, but has Submitted Financials to its PRC Regulator, and Likely to Deloitte, that 
Claim Otherwise.  These Financials are Fraudulent. 
 
EDU’s PRC financials for its Beijing operation (the “BJ Operation”) are fraudulent because they claim 
an impossible tax treatment.  We have a legal opinion to this effect.  In our experience, fraudulent tax 
treatment is usually an indicator of fraudulent accounts, rather than the fraud endgame itself.  In other 
words, fraudulent tax treatment usually means there are far more accounting problems.  Beijing is one 
of the two largest contributors (in terms of cities) to EDU’s revenue and profit.13  According to the 
dubious financials, the BJ Operation generated $207.7 million of revenue in CY2011.  The financials 
show that the BJ Operation receives an exemption from corporate income tax (known as enterprise 
income tax, or “EIT”).  However, the BJ Operation really has no such EIT exemption.  The 0% EIT is a 
lie.  Financials reflecting this exemption are therefore falsified.  EDU submitted these financials to its 
local regulator, the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau (“CAB”).  It is probable that these financials 
contaminated EDU’s U.S. filings because EDU’s 20-F strongly implies BJ Operations has the 
exemption.   
 
Legal and tax framework applicable to EDU and the BJ Operation 
 
To understand why the BJ Operation’s financials are most likely fraudulent, one has to understand the 
legal framework for the for-profit education industry in China.  For profit education became explicitly 
legal with the Law on the Promotion of Privately-Run Schools (the “Private School Law”), which 
became effective in 2003.  China is a single party state, and education is an important means of 
ensuring control.  Therefore education is highly sensitive.  Further, China is a communist country that 
is not comfortable with the idea of profit seeking in every aspect of society.   
 
The Private School Law stated that there are two types of private (i.e. non-state) educational 
institutions: schools and operational training institutions.  The Private School Law states that it does 
not cover operational training institutions; and, that the government will formulate separate measures to 
govern such institutions.  However, the government never did formulate any separate measures.  Thus, 
the least ambiguous structure for a for-profit education business is to establish schools, which are 
subject to the Private School Law.

The Private School Law provides for two categories of privately-funded schools: “requiring reasonable 
returns” and “not requiring reasonable returns” (“NRRR”).  EDU interprets these categories as meaning 
for-profit and non-profit, respectively.  The problem with the interpretation is that non-profit (NRRR) 
does not mean the school is exempt from paying tax.  One of the essential differences between the two 
classifications is that the investors / promoters of NRRR schools do not retain ownership rights to the 
schools’ assets – the schools are essentially state property.  Under the law, when NRRR schools are 
wound-up, their assets belong to the state.  (China GAAP does not allow public companies to 
consolidate NRRR schools because of the effective state ownership of these institutions.) 
 
NRRR schools have two primary regulators, the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) and the Civil Affairs 
Bureau (“CAB”).  The MOE approves applications for schools and oversees them.  The CAB has 
general oversight of entities that are not corporate entities, and oversees their annual inspections.  
CAB’s role is similar to that of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) for 
corporate entities.   
 
EDU and most other school investors established NRRR schools. MOE seems to discriminate against 
applications to establish schools requiring reasonable returns because these schools would not 
ultimately belong to the state.  As a practical matter, it is therefore far easier to get MOE approval to 
start a NRRR school.  While the law contemplates that promoters would establish NRRR schools as 
acts of charity and benevolence, attorneys figured out that if the investors formed separate companies 
that provide services to the schools (e.g., trademarks, curricula, etc.), investors could transfer profits 
out of the schools and into corporate entities.  This is the structure that EDU uses for most of its 
schools.   
 
In EDU’s 20-F, it states that EDU has “restricted net assets” amounting to $285.8 million as of 
FY2011.14  This could refer – at least in part – to the assets still in the schools that EDU has not been 
able to get out via contract.  Regardless, Muddy Waters’s opinion is that the basis for consolidating 
NRRR schools is weak from an economic reality standpoint.  However, in this era of accounting 
fantasy with respect to VIEs (see EDU’s VIE: All Hat and No Cattle), there might not be anything 
improper with this consolidation under U.S. GAAP standards.   
 
NRRRs do not necessarily receive tax exemptions.  NRRRs may apply for EIT exemptions on their 
non-profit income.  However, they must still pay full EIT on their for-profit income.  The Private 
School Law provides that NRRRs will receive the same tax preferences that state schools do.  (Most 
state schools are exempt from EIT.)  In one sense, NRRRs do receive the same tax preferences as state 
schools…on their non-profit income.  The key question then is: “What constitutes non-profit income 
(versus for-profit income) for a privately-owned NRRR?” 
 
In Reality the BJ Operation Is Required to Pay EIT Because Its Revenue is Deemed “For-Profit”.   
 
The only possible reason why EDU’s Beijing subsidiary would not be paying Enterprise Income Tax is 
because it is not turning a profit.  PRC tax law makes it clear that no EIT exemption is available to the 
BJ Operation because its revenue is deemed “for-profit”.  We have obtained a formal legal opinion 
from a PRC tax expert stating this.  We confirmed with the BJ Operation’s tax collector that a) only 
degree-granting private schools are eligible for the EIT exemption, and b) EDU receives no EIT 
exemption.  EDU told a potential franchisee that all of EDU’s company-owned schools pay EIT.

The regulation Caishui 2004 [39], which was promulgated in 2004 and is still effective,15 enumerates 
the categories of educational institutions eligible for tax preferences.  The regulation mainly provides 
for tax preferences for schools that award officially recognized diplomas and their offshoots (e.g., 
training programs that such schools run).  Caishui 2004 [39] does not provide for any tax preferences 
for schools providing non-diploma education in foreign language or test preparation (or any other EDU 
program).  We provide a translation of Caishui 2004 [39] in the Appendix.  Therefore, despite having 
NRRR classification, EDU’s tuition income would still be deemed for-profit and subject to EIT.   
 
The Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) reiterated this policy in a 2008 reply to the Chinese People’s 
Political Consultative Congress.16  The MOF stated that NRRRs receive the same tax treatment as 
government-funded schools in that NRRRs’ income from tuition for officially recognized diploma 
programs would be exempt from EIT.  We provide a Chinese version and English translation of the 
MOF reply in the Appendix.  EDU’s schools are therefore all subject to EIT on their tuition and course 
material revenue.   
 
The BJ Operation pays EIT.  It is possible that in some smaller, remote cities EDU has negotiated 
special tax treatment (in contravention of the law).  Major cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, almost 
never grant such special treatment.  We have confirmed that Beijing has not granted an EIT exemption 
to the BJ Operation.  First, the Beijing tax bureau publishes lists of entities granted exemptions.  The 
URLS for those lists are in the Appendix.  No EDU entity is among the entities listed.   
 
Tax officials confirmed to us that BJ Operation pays EIT.  We first inquired whether or not an investor 
could establish a school there that provides courses similar to those EDU provides and receive an EIT 
exemption.  The tax bureau responded that the EIT exemption would not be available because it is only 
available to schools that award officially-recognized diplomas.  We then brought up EDU, saying that 
EDU has such an exemption.  The tax official stated that EDU pays taxes.   
 
Finally, an EDU employee who works in franchising told a potential franchisee that all EDU company-
owned schools pay EIT. 
 
However BJ Operation’s Financials Purport to be Those of a School with EIT Exemption During 2009 
– 2011, These are Fraudulent Financials 
 
NRRR schools must file audited financials annually with both the MOE and CAB.  NRRR schools use 
a different accounting system than do business entities, and a brief explanation is necessary to 
understand BJ Operation’s financial statements.   
 
Because NRRR schools technically belong to the state, there is no Shareholders’ Equity account.  
Rather, the equivalent account is Net Assets.  NRRR schools do not record Net Income – the equivalent 
account is Changes in Net Assets.  The NRRR school accounting system does not have a separate 
account for taxes – instead, taxes (including EIT) are included in the Other Expenses account.  The 
fraudulent CAB income statement for the years 2009 – 2011 is below.

16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People's_Political_Consultative_Conference  


12 of 96
The Other Expenses account should be at least 25% of income before Other Expenses.  The statutory 
EIT rate applicable to BJ Operation is 25%.  Because BJ Operation recorded less than 1% of income 
before Other Expenses in the Other Expenses account, it is clear that the income statement purports to 
be that of an entity with EIT exempt income.  There are no separate disclosures of EIT in the BJ 
Operation’s filings. 
 
A Slight but Telling Internal Inconsistency Supports the Conclusion that the BJ Operation’s Financials 
are Fraudulent 
 
There is an internal inconsistency in the CAB financials that supports the conclusion the BJ Operation 
filings are fraudulent by virtue of not having an EIT exemption, and thus should be paying EIT.  On 
page five, there is a field asking whether the filer enjoys any tax preference.  The BJ Operation 
(correctly) responded that there is no such preference (See the Appendix).  The absence of a tax 
preference wholly contradicts the income statement, which further shows that BJ Operation paid no 
EIT.   
 
It is Likely that EDU’s Auditor, Deloitte, Relied on the BJ Operation’s Financials in its Audit, and thus 
the Fraudulent Financials Have Contaminated US Filings 
 
We believe that the fraud in the BJ Operation’s financial statements has contaminated EDU’s U.S. 
GAAP accounts.  BJ Operation’s revenue numbers accord with EDU’s U.S. filing disclosures.  EDU’s 
20-F includes statements that indicate the BJ Operation has an EIT exemption.  Finally, if EDU did not 
prepare these accounts for U.S. filings, then for whom did EDU prepare them? 
 
The BJ Operation’s revenue in the CAB financials (approximately 30 – 35% of EDU’s consolidated 
revenue) roughly accords with EDU’s disclosures regarding the percentage of the revenue that EDU 
reports comes from Beijing.  EDU’s FY2011 20-F states that Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and 
Wuhan collectively accounted for approximately 50% of revenue.17  That percentage dropped from 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17 EDU FY 2011 20-F, p. 12. 


13 of 96
51% the prior year as EDU consolidates more stores from outside of these cities.  (FY2009 – 54%, 
FY2008 – 60%, FY2007 – 65%.) EDU CFO Louis Hsieh told investors in a June 2012 conversation 
that Beijing and Shanghai together account for approximately 38% of current revenue.  We believe that 
the BJ Operation’s CAB financials also consolidates some operations outside of Beijing, including in 
Shanghai – our fieldwork in Shanghai found that some Shanghai stores “belong to” the BJ Operation.  
Thus, the revenue reported in the CAB statements accords with EDU’s disclosures, making it likely 
that these financials are the basis for part of the U.S. filings. 
 
EDU’s 20-F strongly implies that Deloitte believes the BJ Operation is non-profit (emphasis added): 
 


The subsidiaries of New Oriental China, which were registered as private schools (the “school-
subsidiaries”), are subject to income taxes determined in accordance with The Law for 
Promoting Private Education (2003) where those school-subsidiaries registered as private 
schools not requiring reasonable returns (similar to a not-for-profit entity) are treated as public 
schools and are generally not subject to enterprise income taxes.18 


 
As we showed supra, it simply is not true that NRRR schools are generally exempt from EIT.  The 
following statement also from the 20-F strongly implies that the BJ Operation has an EIT exemption: 
 


As a result, preferential tax treatments for our schools vary among different cities. In some 
cities, our schools are subject to a standard enterprise income tax rate of 25% (which was 33% 
prior to January 1, 2008), while in other cities, our schools are subject to a 2% to 3% tax on 
gross receipts in lieu of the standard enterprise income tax or are exempted from the enterprise 
income tax. Among our schools in the four major cities from which we derived a majority of 
our revenues [Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan per page 12 of the 2011 20-F] in each 
of the past three fiscal years ended May 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, our school in Wuhan has 
been subject to the standard enterprise income tax, and our school in Shanghai has been subject 
to standard enterprise income tax rate since the beginning of 2007.19   


 
New Oriental Almost Certainly Consolidates its Franchises’ Results as its Own 
 
There are two reasons why it is virtually certain that EDU is consolidating the franchises.  First, the 
franchise contract is designed to give EDU cash and reports that assist with its audit needs, but don’t 
make sense from a legitimate economic perspective.  Second, with franchisee fee payments and 
enrollment data flowing into EDU’s system, Deloitte would be very sensitive as to whether the controls 
exist to separate them.  Because EDU’s SEC filings never mention franchising, Deloitte obviously has 
no idea that EDU franchises.  Thus, there are no internal controls to separate the franchising cash and 
data.  Without internal controls, it is a near-certain bet Management is consolidating the franchises. 
 
EDU’s franchise contract makes it probable that EDU is consolidating its franchisees’ financials – even 
though the franchisees, and not EDU, own the stores, assets, and cash flows.  EDU’s franchisees are 
required to provide their financials to EDU during EDU’s audit, and according to EDU’s fiscal year.  
EDU’s fiscal year for SEC reporting purposes ends May 31st.  The franchise agreement we viewed 
provides: 
 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18 EDU FY2011 20-F, p. 47. 
19 EDU FY2011 20-F, p. 48. 


14 of 96
“In accordance with Party A’s [EDU] fiscal year (beginning on June 1st and ending on May 
31st), Party B [the franchisee] shall provide an annual financial report and a report on the status 
of the school’s operations within 2 months of the end of the fiscal year.”20   


 
The franchise agreement also requires documents that EDU could give to Deloitte to establish 
ownership for audit purposes: 
 


“Party B [the franchisee] shall at the time of execution of this agreement provide to Party A for 
its review records and reports including a copy of the school’s registration certificate, a copy of 
the private non-enterprise legal person registration certificate, a copy of the certificate stating 
the organization’s code, a copy of the permit, a copy of the tax registration certificate, the 
capital verification report certificate, the school’s articles of incorporation, a photograph of the 
school, the organization’s organizational chart, name list of the staff and rules and regulations, 
etc.”21 


 
The fact that the franchisees have to provide the financials at all is suspicious. Franchisees pay a fixed 
upfront fee that covers the first three years of the franchise.  EDU does not collect any variable 
franchise fees during this time; therefore, it is not clear what EDU’s legitimate interest in receiving 
franchisees’ financials would be.  
 
Requiring franchisees to provide accounting through May 31st is unnecessarily burdensome, unless 
EDU is consolidating the franchises.  China law requires entities to operate on a calendar fiscal year for 
PRC audit/annual inspection purposes.  The June 1st through May 31st financial record requirement is 
awkward for franchisees because it would require them to provide un-audited financials for the period 
through May 31st.  It is therefore pointless for EDU to request these records according to its own fiscal 
year unless it is using these records for its own audit.     
 
EDU’s online enrollment system also plays a role in consolidating the results.  EDU announces its 
results before the deadline for franchisees to provide their documents.  However, the franchise 
agreement requires the franchisees to use EDU’s enrollment system to register students for courses.  
Thus EDU has a good look at the franchisees’ top lines before reporting.   
 


III. Revenue to Certain Subsidiaries Declined from CY2008 to CY2010, Contradicting EDU’s 
Reported Numbers.  


 
The declining revenues in EDU’s main WFOE subsidiaries’ State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce (“SAIC”)22 financial statements shows declining revenue from CY2008 to CY2010.23  As 
we explain in the VIE section, these two entities, Beijing Hewstone Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing 
Decision Education Co. Ltd., are the parties that enter into licensing agreements with EDU’s schools 
and learning centers.  Hewstone receives license fees for EDU’s trademarks.  Through CY2010, 
Decision received fees for teaching support, website development and use, and enrollment system use.  


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20 Section 3.1.3 
21 Section 3.1.2. 
22 SAIC is one of two primary regulators for corporate entities in China.  Every corporate entity undergoes an annual 
inspection, during which it submits annual financial information to SAIC.  SAIC places the financial information in the 
entity’s official file.  By law, SAIC files are available for inspection to any PRC-qualified attorney.  However, under 
China’s recent state policy of protecting frauds, these files have recently become harder to obtain. 
23 CY2011 was not available when we obtained the SAIC files. 


15 of 96
It would seem that because EDU reported overall revenue growth during this period, the two 
subsidiaries’ revenue would grow due to increased license fee revenue.  This was not the case though. 
 


 
 
As we discuss in EDU’s VIE: All Hat and No Cattle, it appears that EDU allowed four of the licensing 
agreements to lapse on January 1, 2011; therefore, SAIC numbers through CY2010 would capture the 
license revenue.  Due to China’s crackdown on due diligence research, we have not obtained files for 
all of EDU’s WFOEs.  However, EDU has not filed amendments to the licensing agreements, which 
leads us to conclude that the agreements have not been assigned to other entities, and thus all licensing 
revenue flowed to Hewstone and Decision.   
 
Some have criticized the use of SAIC financials as a means of detecting fraud.  Perhaps the most vocal 
criticism has come from Benjamin Wey of New York Global Group.24  New York Global specializes in 
bringing China companies to the U.S. markets via reverse merger.  The FBI raided Mr. Wey’s office in 
January 2012.25  In contrast, Muddy Waters sees significant SAIC filing discrepancies – particularly in 
the revenue line – as important indicators of fraud.   
 
Muddy Waters is not the first firm to note a discrepancy between EDU’s U.S. and SAIC filings.  OLP 
Global (“OLP”) cited declining revenue in EDU’s VIE entity, New Oriental China (“NOC”), to 
challenge EDU’s reported revenue and profit in OLP’s November 17, 2011 report.  As is typical (in our 
experience) of companies rightfully accused of fraud, EDU responded to the OLP report in a selective 
manner.  EDU chose to ignore the point about NOC’s deteriorating financial performance.  Because 
OLP’s report was circulated to a limited number of clients, the market was largely unaware of EDU’s 
selective response.

IV. Ghosts in the Machine: Internet Anomalies 
 
EDU’s reported internet figures do not support its growth story.  According to EDU’s investor relations, 
“Most of [the online courses] are used to complement the in-person classes.”  If that is the case, we are 
curious as to why EDU’s reported online subscriber base has flat-lined as its number of in-person 
enrollments has skyrocketed by 143.2% and the Chinese internet user base has increased by 294.3% 
over the same period: 
 


 
 
On top of the phenomenal reported learning center enrollment growth and rapid increase in internet 
penetration in China, EDU claims to have dedicated resources to expanding its online classes to an 
impressive course catalog to 4x what it was in 2006 by 2010 (for some reason, EDU reported a decline 
in FY 2011 to 1,000 online courses offered).  Despite what would seem like enormous wind in its sails, 
online subscribers per learning center enrollments have declined to less than half of what they were five 
years ago: 


 
 
We received purported online revenue figures from EDU’s IR.  These figures show strong growth over 
the past few years.  This revenue growth does not jibe with the lack of growth in paying online users.  
To believe these numbers, it would mean that EDU instituted substantial price increases in the face of 
declining enrollments.  For instance, in FY 2011, the number of paying online users declined by 25.6%, 


17 of 96
but revenue increased by 28%-- implying that the average paying user paid 72.1% more during FY 
2011 than during FY 2010: 
 


 
 
We also found a data point that seems to contradict EDU’s reported traffic in its 2006 prospectus 
(emphasis added): 
 


“Our technology platform is a combination of e-learning platforms, alumni platforms, content 
management systems, exam platforms, e-business promotion platforms and bookstore platforms, 
live Internet classrooms, as well as licensed speech recognition platforms…Currently, 
approximately 3,000 students can use our online systems at the same time.”26 


 
If EDU’s servers were only equipped to support 3,000 students at a time, how did they accommodate 
the 200,000 paying users that it claimed to have?  
 
Google Trends shows that traffic to koolearn.com, EDU’s online education website, has been 
consistently below 50,000 unique visitors per day, and has flat-lined/declined over the past few years, 
with a significant drop in FY 2010—the year EDU reported a record 71.1% increase in paying users27 
(yes, we know that only iResearch has that special something needed to measure internet traffic in 
China):

EDU’s Audit: You Don’t Get What You Don’t Pay For. 
 
EDU’s auditor since it went public is the troubled Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Shanghai (“Deloitte”).  
Deloitte has had a number of high profile audit failures in recent years.   
 


• It is currently adverse to the Securities and Exchange Commission in two litigations relating to 
the audits of China companies, and has the distinction of being the first foreign auditor against 
which the SEC has ever prosecuted an enforcement action.   


• There are likely a number of problem audit clients at other Big Four firms to be unearthed; 
however, Deloitte is leading the pack in this measure.   


 
There is an argument that companies in China are un-auditable because it is so easy to defraud the 
auditors.  Investors typically misunderstand auditors’ role – auditors are generally not attempting to 
ensure that financial statements are free of fraud.  In the China context, auditors focus on checking that 
the PRC GAAP accounts have been correctly translated into US GAAP.   
 
The crux of the anti-fraud portion of a typical audit is the cash balance confirmation process.  As last 
week’s Peregrine Futures fraud revelations show, all that one needs to fool auditors regarding hundreds 
of millions of dollars in cash balances is an inkjet and a P.O. box.28  In China, auditors will often 
attempt to verify the balances with individual employees of banks.  However, China’s banking system 
makes it shockingly easy for companies to defraud auditors regarding cash balances.  As Deloitte’s 
resignation letter to China MediaExpress Holdings Inc.’s (OTC: CCME) board makes clear, bank 
employees’ allegiance is easily purchased (Citron Research and Muddy Waters published exposés of 
CCME in January / February 2011: 
 


“Prior to its resignation, DTT raised the following issues (some of which may be considered to 
be disagreements) encountered during the audit, including: issues related to the authenticity of 
bank statements; a loss of confidence in bank confirmation procedures carried out under 
circumstances which DTT believed to be suspicious;…concerns over possible undisclosed bank 
accounts and bank loans;…”29 


 (Deloitte had already issued an unqualified opinion on CCME’s fraud) 
 
The letter also points to another large problem with China cash balance confirmations: it is relatively 
easy to rent balances for cash confirmation purposes.  After all, the cash balance lessors are well 
outside of the reach of U.S. law, so from their perspective, there is no downside to renting out balances.  
The ease with which companies can generate fake bank balances is possibly best illustrated by 
Duoyuan Global Water (PINK: DGWIY).  DGWIY was delisted from the NYSE on April 17, 2012, 
which followed the resignation of its entire audit committee on April 20, 2011.  In its resignation letter, 
the audit committee wrote: 
 


“…Once the Audit Committee commenced its work, progress was hampered because among 
other things, management: 
 
  •   failed to meet requested deadlines to provide all the requested documents to the review team; 
     


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

•   declined to permit the forensic auditor appropriate unfettered access to the financial data; 
       •   further delayed when follow-up information was sought by the review team and delayed the 


start of the forensic accounting work on the grounds that document gathering needed to be 
completed; 


       •   withdrew financial information from the forensic accounting team because the team was taking 
notes during its review work. 


 
After each of the above incidents (as well as other incidents), members of the Audit Committee, 
at the review team’s request, would spend significant amounts of time to resolve the impasse 
created by management. Each time management promised future cooperation; however, each 
time when the review team recommenced its work, full cooperation was not forthcoming and 
new issues would arise.”30 


 
Muddy Waters had already exposed DGWIY as a fraud on April 4, 2011.  Even for the most optimistic 
of investors, the audit committee mass resignation letter should have been proof positive that the 
company is a fraud.  Regardless, DGWIY managed to pump up its bank accounts for a verification 
performed by its special investigative committee of replacement directors.31  In an August 8, 2011 
press release, DGWIY reported: 


“…The Company's Special Investigation Committee (the "Committee") today announced that 
based on the available bank account statements, the Company's bank balances were 
approximately: 


(i) USD$24,362,243 plus RMB801,756,757(USD$122,286,126) equal 
to USD$146,648,369 on March 31, 2011, and 


(ii) USD$23,221,331 plus RMB683,530,316(USD105,409,872) equal 
to USD$128,631,203 on May 31, 2011. 


The Committee utilized the Company's existing eight (8) online internet banking facilities for 
the March 31 and May 31, 2011 RMB balances, and those internet bank balances were 
consistent with the bank statements.”32 


 
Cash balances can be faked in China through a combination of document forgery (forgery is so 
commonplace in China that street hawkers outside of the Shanghai railway station sell counterfeit tax 
invoices), compliant bank employees who will never be held accountable and whose monthly salaries 
are only several hundred dollars, and the availability of balances for rent.  China’s financial fraud 
economy is substantial –the largest in the world by far – and such balances are thus relatively easy to 
come by.   
 
As an example, Muddy Waters’s research director, Carson Block, was invited by a Shanghainese friend 
in 2007 to participate in a scheme at Bank of China (“BOC”) whereby toward the end of each week, Mr. 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

31 The previous directors on the committee, along with the committee’s former legal advisor, resigned on April 20 & April 
21, 2011. 
32 http://ir.duoyuan-hq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=230632&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1594164&highlight=

Block would have moved money into an account at a designated BOC branch in Shanghai.  He would 
have then been free to remove the money the following Monday or Tuesday.  For his efforts, he would 
have received weekly interest payments that would have exceeded 20% on an annualized basis.  Mr. 
Block surmised two things at the time a) for him as a white foreigner to have been invited to participate, 
the scheme must have been enormous; and, b) this program was likely designed to help BOC managers 
meet reserve requirements, which managers were otherwise unable to meet because they had illicitly 
extended too many loans (Mr. Block declined to participate). 
 
This is all relevant to EDU because as EDU adds stores, it adds bank accounts.  Typically, each store 
will have at least one bank account—often more.  The cash movements become more numerous, more 
complex and to and from more places, generating increasing amounts of paper records.  The 
opportunities for EDU to game cash balance therefore increase.  Despite EDU’s greater complexity 
calling for more audit firepower, EDU’s audit fees have decreased significantly since 2007, which was 
its first full year as a public company.  During this time, there was significant inflation in China of 
accountant’s salaries, so we assume that Deloitte’s cost per man-hour increased during this time.  For 
Deloitte to charge 1/3 less than in 2007 while auditing a network almost 3x as large, all while paying 
accountants more, is risky. 
 
If it is clear that on a standalone basis EDU is not paying for a quality audit. It is ever more obvious 
when comparing its peers.  EDU paid less for its 2011 audit than any of its US-listed peers, despite 
reporting significantly greater size and geographic reach.  (As we discuss in EDU and Its Public 
Comps: Too Good to be True, we think that financials of the other companies in this industry generally 
should be viewed with skepticism.)

Given that EDU is collecting sizable upfront fees from franchisees and obviously consolidating the 
franchises to some extent, EDU clearly has even more of an opportunity to game its cash confirmation 
process.  At the same time, it is underpaying for its audit. 
 
We call not only upon EDU shareholders, but shareholders of all China companies to review the audit 
fees the companies pay to ensure they are not paying the auditor to cut corners.  Appropriate audit fees 
are monies well spent.

What does chairman Michael Yu have in common with Mannie Fresh?  They both got everything in 
they momma name.  In the FY2011 20-F, it states that Michael Yu’s 26.4 million shares are owned by 
a BVI company in turn owned by his mother, called Tigerstep Developments Ltd.  The filing reads: 
 


“Mr. Yu disclaims beneficial ownership of all the shares held by Tigerstep Developments 
Limited.”34

We are not saying that Michael Yu is the most repugnant company chairman we have ever seen.  He is 
far from it.  We respect that he built a network of stores that has delivered a useful service to millions 
of customers, albeit while lying to attract the capital to do so.  Investors need to understand that 
Chairman Yu has a very pragmatic attitude toward business.

“During settlement talks in Washington, D.C., von Mayrhauser sat across from Yu.  ‘I 
remember his saying, ‘You’re going to lose, no Western company can win in Beijing.  Even if 
you win, you’ll only get $5,000,’’ Von Mayrhauser says.  ‘That pretty much ended the 
meeting.’”37 


 
The article mentions that ETS later agreed to license an online TOEFL exam to EDU (emphasis 
added): 
 
“Yu says ETS realized he ‘is not a vicious person’ and was only following standard Chinese business 


practices.”38

The Great Leap Backward: China’s Ministry of State [In]Security, EDU’s Dividend, and EDU’s 


VIE. 
 
In 2012, China made it state policy to protect its frauds by (in violation of its own laws) restricting 
access to government files.  Its domestic spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (“MSS”), also 
began a campaign of intimidation against individuals who do on-the-ground research to detect fraud.  
The MSS became aware that we were researching EDU at the end of March / beginning of April 2012.  
There is a very high probability that it informed EDU of this fact.   
 
On April 17, 2012, EDU announced a $0.30 per ADS special dividend to be paid September 29, 2012 
to shareholders of record on August 31, 2012.  This dividend announcement was unusual.  First, EDU 
chose its fiscal Q3 announcement as the time to announce its first dividend as a public company, 
despite having been public for 22 quarters.  (The announcement of a first-time dividend at Q3 numbers 
is a little odd for any company.)  
 
The second unusual aspect of this announcement is that EDU had previously been obstinate about not 
paying dividends, offering a series of questionable excuses for not paying one.  As recently as the prior 
quarter’s call (fiscal Q2), Louis Hsieh had said: 
 


“So, our U.S. dollar balance is not high.  So we study it each time, but there is no movement on 
that right now.  And as you know, there's also a withholding tax in China that looks like it's 
10% but when the companies actually go through the process, there ends up being a lot of other 
taxes and the amount goes up into the 20%s. And so the cost of dividends or repurchase – stock 
repurchases becomes overwhelming high unless you have a lot of U.S. dollars, which we 
don't.”39 


 
EDU’s history as a non dividend-payer was particularly vexing because EDU paid cumulative 
dividends per common share of its Cayman parent company of RMB1.56 before going public.  So EDU

finally chose to accord the same treatment to its post-IPO shareholders as it did to its pre-IPO 
shareholders—but only after the MSS found out that we were researching the Company. 
 
EDU’s dividend is returning capital that EDU raised from shareholders and therefore does not validate 
reported numbers.  It has become common for China companies suspected of fraud to declare dividends, 
which in the cases of companies such as China MediaExpress,40 is purely returning a portion of the 
money the companies raised.  As shown in the table below, the money EDU will be paying out for its 
special dividend is simply a partial return of capital it raised through its pre-IPO proceeds and two 
offerings.  The planned dividend therefore does not validate EDU’s historical reported numbers. 
 





 
 
In FY 2004, EDU’s cash flows were rocked by the RMB 100.0 million refund ($12.1 million) it had to 
pay to a “potential investor.”  The Prospectus sheds little light on the event, and a deposit of that size at 
that point in time suggests that the “potential investor” was considering acquiring a majority of, if not 
all of the company.  While we can only imagine what may have changed the investor’s mind, EDU had 
concurrent loans taken out for RMB 104.5mm in the same year, and did not fully pay down its debt 
until after its IPO. 
 
We believe that the dividend declaration was made to preempt a report from Muddy Waters that EDU 
knew would be damning to the Company’s credibility.  Michael, why are you running? 
 
We experienced the feeling of EDU attempting to preempt us again on July 11, 2012 – just one week 
ago.  We believe that on approximately July 9th, EDU became aware that we were looking critically at 
its VIE structure.  As we discuss in EDU’s VIE: All Hat and No Cattle, EDU’s VIE structure was – and 
still is – dangerous for EDU shareholders.  Interestingly, EDU chose July 11th, only six days before its 
scheduled earnings release to announce that it had “improved” the quality of its VIE structure.  Per 
yesterday’s announcement regarding the SEC investigation of EDU, EDU only became aware of the 
investigation on July 13, 2012.  Thus, EDU’s VIE press release seems to be related to our work, rather 
than that of the SEC.  Again Michael, why are you running? 
 
One of the purported strengthening measures EDU announced was to transfer ownership of the VIE 
company to Michael Yu.  The rationale in press release was that (emphasis added): 
 


“The Company believes that New Oriental China's equity interests should only be held by the 
shareholders whose interests are more closely aligned with those of the Company, and that the 
interests of Mr. Yu, who is the Company's founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, are 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

24 of 96
aligned with those of the Company, given the significant beneficial ownership Mr. Yu has in 
the Company and his continuing leadership position at the Company.” 41 
 


 
If Chairman Yu had significant beneficial ownership in EDU, he wouldn’t be Hood Rich Mike.  So 
which one is it?   
 
If you had trouble downloading this report, don’t blame us.  Last week, as we were finishing up our 
research on EDU, it appears that our server’s defenses against denial of service attacks were tested.  
The following is the graph of traffic to our server that we had never seen before: 
 


 
 
Since Google made it policy to inform Gmail users of “state sponsored” attempts to hack email 
accounts, Mr. Block has repeatedly seen the following notice in his Gmail: 
 


 
 
Despite our never having taken a public stand on China’s political issues, the CPC is clearly treating 
Muddy Waters as a threat, and is taking overtly hostile actions toward us – particularly as we closed in 
on releasing this report on EDU.  The combination of targeting all due diligence researchers while 
obstructing SEC and PCAOB investigations / inspections are also hostile actions, but they are directed 
against American investors at large.  
 
We titled this section The Great Leap Backward because we wanted to clearly make the point that 
fraud and corruption among publicly-traded companies from China is so widespread that the 
Communist Party of China (“CPC”) feels its has no choice other than to suppress revelations of the 
fraud.  According to the New York Times, auditors have resigned from 67 U.S.-listed China 
companies,42 and another 126 China companies have either been delisted or gone dark.43  As this report

42 We prefer the phrase “China company” to “Chinese company.”  “Chinese” is an ethnicity (or a language) and has nothing 
to do with the propensity to commit fraud.  “China” in this case refers to a country with a political and economic system that 
(contrary to the nature of the vast majority of its inhabitants) propagates fraud, corruption, and theft. 
43 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/business/in-china-inspecting-the-inspectors.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all

should illustrate, the problem listings still exist.  In other words, the scourge of China companies 
committing stock fraud is too large to actually be cleaned up.   
 
The CPC’s reaction to the tragic high-speed rail crash in 2011 was literally to bury the crashed train.  
There is a strong parallel between the crash and the crackdown on research.  The crash, like China’s 
public company fraud, cannot be solved.  Further, both are the indirect results of the rotting of China’s 
society that flows from the CPC’s unbridled corruption.   
 
It is an open secret that the official economic data the CPC publishes are products of fraud.  According 
to a U.S. State Department cable published by WikiLeaks, presumptive incoming premier Li Keqiang 
told U.S. officials in 2007 that China’s GDP figures are “man made” and “for reference only”, and 
advised focusing instead on other measures to gauge the state of China’s economy.44  Our message to 
the CPC and China companies is that if you want us and others to stop exposing fraud in China, then 
stop committing it. 
 
Foreign policy makers and businesses are typically of the view that we should engage with China on 
two separate tracks: economic interests and human rights.  We (Muddy Waters) were also once 
proponents of this view.  Our work over the past two years has taught us that lack of respect for human 
rights becomes lack of respect for economic rights.  Our message to investors is that human rights and 
economic rights are two sides of the same coin.   
 


EDU’s VIE: All Hat and No Cattle 
 
EDU’s VIE structure deviates widely from best practices and is among the most troubling we have seen.  
Among other problems, EDU took over five years to register the share pledge of its VIE, and only did 
so this May likely in order to preempt a critical report from Muddy Waters (see The Great Leap 
Backward).  Even worse, EDU evidently should have foreclosed on the pledged equity 17 months ago, 
yet did not.  The pledge is therefore cosmetic only.  Unlike best practices VIEs, such as Baidu, Inc. 
(“BIDU”), which attempt to place as much economic substance within the shareholders’ company as 
possible, EDU’s structure leaves most economic value in the hands of chairman Michael Yu.   
 
We believe that the arguably non-consolidatable structure was primarily designed to protect EDU 
Chairman Yu from shareholders, should he lose control of the public company.  This weak VIE 
structure is consistent with the Hood Rich methodology of placing assets that would be within reach of 
a functional court system (i.e., his shares in the public company which would be adjudicated in the 
British Virgin Islands) into his mother’s name.  On the other hand, the shares of the VIE would be 
almost impossible to wrest from Chairman Yu in PRC court or arbitration, so why wouldn’t he give 
them all to himself? 
 
As a refresher, a VIE (variable interest entity) is a way of allowing a publicly-traded company to 
consolidate operations that it does not actually own.    In the wake of the Enron collapse, the US 
required public companies to consolidate off balance sheet structures.  China companies quickly 
realized that they could use the post-Enron rules – specifically FIN 46 – to consolidate operating 
businesses that China law prohibited foreigners to own (e.g., internet businesses).  This consolidation 
was highly desirable for IPOs.45   


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
44 http://presscuttings.ft.com/presscuttings/s/3/articleText/61910386#axzz20kdRjjmn  
45 Commentators generally assume that consolidation was necessary for IPOs; however, we disagree.  A sounder alternative 
to VIEs would be a structure whereby the public company has truly independent management, reports only based on the 


26 of 96
A VIE structure creates the illusion that the shareholders own the underlying business.  In reality, 
management or their designees are the shareholders of the operating business.  The public companies 
(via their subsidiaries) have contracts with the operating businesses that are supposed to provide cash 
flows to the public companies, as well as controls that act as checks on the heavily conflicted 
managements.  For a more detailed explanation of VIEs, see www.chinaaccountingblog.com.46  
 
The following diagram illustrates the differences between a basic, conventionally-structured China 
public company and a basic VIE structure: 
 


 
There are best practices for VIEs that provide more shareholder protections from potentially rogue 
management.  The following is a description of the agreements constituting Baidu Inc.’s (NASDAQ: 
BIDU) VIE package, which reflects these best practices.  (Ironically, BIDU chairman / CEO Robin Li 
has been on EDU’s board since before EDU’s IPO)  BIDU’s IPO prospectus describes the public 
company’s ability to control the operating company in the following way (emphasis added): 
 


We [the public company] have contractual arrangements with Baidu Netcom [the operating 
company] and its shareholders pursuant to which…Through these contractual arrangements, we 
also have the ability to substantially influence Baidu Netcom’s daily operations and financial 
affairs, appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring shareholder approval…47 


 
As we will explain in this section, EDU has no such control of its operating company, which we 
believe is a deliberate attempt to protect Chairman Yu from shareholders, should he lose control of the 
public company.  BIDU’s VIE package consists of the following agreements:48 
 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cash flows it receives from the operating company, and is audited separate from the operating company.  Such (more 
prudent) structures would have had far less “sex appeal” in the IPO selling process than did the illusion of owning the 
operating business, and thus have not been used. 
46 This blog is highly critical of the use of VIE structures, which we largely agree with.  However, we are far more critical 
than he of auditors’ conduct in China.

BIDU: Technology Consulting Service Agreement and Business Cooperation Agreement.  These 
agreements provide that the public company’s WFOE49 subsidiary will provide key operating services 
to the operating company, including: 


• secondment of employees,  
• internet search services, and  
• internet advertising services.   


 
BIDU’s agreements reflect an attempt to place as much of the substance of BIDU’s business operations 
into the WFOE in order to decrease the standalone value of the operating company to BIDU 
management (should management go rogue).  This limitation of the value of the operating company is 
common to VIE structures.   
 
However, EDU’s WFOEs have very little business substance within them, which increases the 
temptation for EDU management to use the operating company to enrich itself.  Having little substance 
in the WFOEs makes it easier to walk away from the public company shareholders and keep the 
operating business.  It is troubling EDU’s VIE package would have been structured this way. 
 
Operating Agreement.  This agreement places a good deal of management substance in BIDU’s WFOE.   


• It requires BIDU’s operating company to appoint directors the WFOE designates.   
• BIDU’s WFOE receives the right to appoint the operating company’s senior executives.   
• BIDU’s operating company is prohibited from making material business decisions without the 


WFOE’s approval.   
• This agreement also provides cross-guarantees between BIDU’s WFOE and operating company 


that make it hard to sever BIDU’s operating company from the listco and WFOE.   
 
BIDU’s operating agreement therefore places a substantial amount of control over BIDU’s operating 
company in the hands of the WFOE, which is a subsidiary of the public company.  This is important 
because shareholders would eventually be able to take control of BIDU’s WFOE should management 
go rogue.  These controls therefore act as assurance that rogue BIDU management does not use the 
operating company for its own enrichment.  These controls represent best practices and are common to 
VIE structures.   
 
EDU has few such controls. 
 
Software and Other License Agreements.  BIDU’s WFOE owns key software code for BIDU’s search 
and advertising business.  It also owns the web domains for BIDU’s websites.  Under these agreements, 
BIDU’s WFOE licenses the code and domains to the operating company.  This is another way in which 
BIDU’s VIE package puts business substance into the company controlled by BIDU shareholders, and 
diminishes the standalone value of the operating company.   
 
Of course the main substance of EDU’s business is the learning centers, which are owned by the 
schools, which are owned by the VIE.  In this way, EDU leaves substantially all of the value in the 
operating company, which Chairman Yu now wholly owns. 
 
Proxy Agreement.  BIDU’s operating company shareholders agree to allow BIDU’s WFOE (via an 
individual the WFOE appoints) to vote for them on all matters.   


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
49 The acronym is pronounced “woofie.”  It means wholly foreign-owned enterprise, which has legal significance in China. 


28 of 96
EDU has no such agreement. 
 
Irrevocable Power of Attorney.  This effects BIDU’s proxy agreement by specifying the individuals 
who will vote on behalf of BIDU’s operating company shareholders.  It provides that the power of 
attorney shall terminate if the designated individuals cease their employment with BIDU’s WFOE.   
 
EDU has no such agreement. 
 
Equity Pledge.  BIDU’s operating company shareholders recorded a pledge at the State Administration 
of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) in favor of the WFOE over their equity in the operating company.  
(We do not have BIDU’s SAIC files, so we cannot confirm this.)  If BIDU’s operating company 
breaches its contractual obligations to BIDU’s WFOE, then the WFOE may foreclose on the pledged 
equity.  Such pledges are only enforceable if recorded at SAIC, which is the official register of such 
pledges.  It is common in VIE structures for the operating company shareholders to record such a 
pledge at SAIC.   
 
In contrast, EDU’s operating company shareholders did not record any equity pledge at SAIC until two 
months ago (after likely learning from the MSS that we were researching EDU).  As part of the VIE 
package, EDU had entered into an agreement to record such a pledge in the operating company’s 
internal shareholder registry.  The pledge was to secure EDU’s performance under four agreements 
with its WFOEs.   
 
The more important point though is that (registered or not), EDU has already proven that the pledge is 
cosmetic.  EDU evidently failed to renew three of the four agreements that the VIE share pledge 
purportedly secures.  These agreements have disappeared from its exhibits list after expiring on January 
1, 2011.  Yet, EDU has not foreclosed on the pledged security.  Thus the pledge truly is illusory.   
 
EDU’s cosmetic pledge agreement provides that the pledge is to secure the VIE’s performance (i.e., 
payments to the WFOEs) under the “Main Contracts.”  The pledge agreement defines Main Contracts 
as the: 
 


• Trademark License Agreement.  EDU has two trademark license agreements, but this 
presumably refers to the one between its WFOE Hewstone and the various schools.  This 
trademark license agreement – formerly exhibit 4.7 – expired on January 1, 2011 and was not 
renewed.   


• Website Development and Use Agreement.  This agreement – formerly exhibit 4.5 – also 
expired on January 1, 2011 and was not renewed.   


• Teaching Support Agreement.  This agreement – formerly exhibit 4.4 – expired on January 1, 
2011 and was not renewed. 


• New Enrollment System Development Agreement.  – formerly exhibit 4.6, but now 4.4 – is 
likely still in effect because it is still listed in the exhibits.   


 
EDU’s defense against a charge that it failed to enforce the pledge would be that it wrote the pledge in 
a way so as to allow the agreements to terminate without triggering the pledge.  The pledge agreement 
appears to allow EDU to amend the list of the agreements that are included in the Main Contracts 
(presumably including by deleting them).  Regardless, if that is the rationale for failing to foreclose, 
then the pledge is clearly illusory. 


29 of 96
Equity Option.  BIDU’s operating company issued BIDU’s WFOE an option to purchase its shares 
when it becomes legal for the WFOE to own the operating company.  The term of the option is 10-
years.   
 
EDU’s operating company also issued an option that allows the WFOE to purchase the operating 
company’s equity when it becomes legal to do so.  We do not expect the PRC government to make it 
legal for the listed companies to own either BIDU or EDU’s operating businesses anytime soon. 
 


EDU and its Public Comps: Too Good to be True 
 


“’I am in awe of New Oriental’s success in a marketplace that fractured, that difficult, that competitive,’ 
The Princeton Review’s Kanarek says.”50 


 
While EDU does deliver good education and training to its clients, we believe that actual profit margins 
are a good deal lower than EDU and most of its peers report.  The reality of business in China – 
particularly retail business – is that competition is far more deleterious to margins than most foreign 
investors perceive.  Once a given business model demonstrates success in a given location, virtually 
overnight there will be numerous competitors setting up shop to compete.  Their competitive strategy is 
usually to undercut prices.  The mass market in China is legendarily price-sensitive.  Everybody bleeds 
until enough of the players are washed out of the industry that margins recover somewhat, just in time 
for the same cycle to repeat itself.   
 
In the past decade, China has generally been awash in liquidity due to the accumulation of enormous 
capital and current account surpluses of recent decades, and inflation of massive credit and asset 
bubbles.  As a result, capital has often been allocated without due consideration for economic returns, 
which exacerbates the deleterious impact of competition beyond what would be the case in a more 
conventional economy.  We have long observed that China seems to be the land of six-month business 
plans as a result of these competitive forces. 
 
EDU has a strong nationwide brand in China, which is built on solid delivery of service.  However, that 
can only give you so much pricing power in this environment.  The reality is that most of EDU’s sweet 
spots are commoditized, particularly domestic and overseas test preparation, and adult English.  That is 
not to say that EDU’s loses much market share to fly-by-night operations.  Rather, there are enough 
operators that deliver quality services that EDU’s brand does not afford it much of a moat.   
 
We have observed that EDU’s course pricing is often not higher than that of its competitors.  Credit 
Suisse made the same observation in a November 2011 report, in which the analysts found that EDU’s 
pricing is comparable to, if not lower than, its competitors.51   
 


“Our primary ASP study on hourly rates of small classes in Beijing and a representative Tier 3 
city shows that the market perception of EDU having a price premium over competitors is 
wrong.”52

In a graph on p. 17 of Credit Suisse’s report, Credit Suisse noted that rather than pricing its services at a 
premium, EDU priced virtually all of its English classes below those of TAL Education, one of its 
primary competitors that is known for non-English courses.  We also found this to be the case most of 
the time following an internal study in which we compared EDU’s pricing of comparable classes with 
its competitors while controlling for confounding variables in EDU’s pricing.  This contradicts EDU’s 
frequent mention of its “premium pricing” in China to explain how it is producing 60% gross margins 
to investors: 
 


“So we’re like Wal-Mart but with a Tiffany price. So we offer one thing under one roof for 
them and so we’re doing the same thing now to K-12.”53 


 
The reason behind this can be attributed to the fact that, based on survey results published by Credit 
Suisse in the same report, EDU is at the bottom of its peer group of public companies for every single 
customer service metric.  We have approximated Credit Suisse’s graph below for your convenience: 
 


 
 
The only segment in which we perceive that EDU has a real pricing advantage is POP Kids.  Parents of 
young children are the least price-sensitive segment of for-profit education customers.  During 
discussions about opening a Tier 3 city franchise between a potential franchisee and EDU, the EDU 
representative indicated that the potential franchisee should expect to generate gross margins of 10-
15%. 
 
EDU’s VIP business gross margin seems to be greatly overstated as well.  Louis Hsieh claimed that 
VIP business gross margins reached 54% in FY2011.54  We had a conversation with a senior executive 
from Only Education, which we perceive to have greater brand strength in the Shanghai market than 
EDU does.  The Only executive stated that gross margins on VIP classes are 17% to 20%.  This 
executive is also one of the sources who stated that group classes in Tier 1 cities top out around 30%.

Louis Hsieh also commented that POP Kids gross margins are in the mid-50% range.55  As mentioned 
supra, a Tier 3 city POP Kids franchisee should expect to generate 15% to 20% gross margins. 
 
We are skeptical of the financials of several of EDU’s publicly-traded peers, specifically Ambow 
Education Holding Ltd. (NYSE: AMBO), ChinaCast Education Corp. (OTC: CAST), and TAL 
Education Group (NYSE: XRS).  The financials of Xueda Education Group (NYSE: XUE) are the 
most plausible of the group, and their financials indicate that companies in the industry are operating 
barely above break-even. 
 


• AMBO: has had two CFOs resign in the past year, has been accused by a former employee of 
financial impropriety, and posted a surprise Q1 2012 net loss vs. a profit the prior year despite 
reporting 22.1% growth in year-over-year revenue at the same time.   


• CAST: In March 2012, CEO Ron Chan was fired after being accused of refusing to allow 
Deloitte to certify ChinaCast’s books.  Follow his firing, Chan stole the company’s chops, 
business licenses, and accounting statements.  This prevented ChinaCast from engaging in any 
further business.  The company also announced that it was investigating the unauthorized 
transfer of ownership in two of its colleges, possible undisclosed related party transactions, 
possible undisclosed loans to third parties, and suspicious trading of CAST stock.  Chan issued 
a public letter to the board of directors, in which he accused (former dissident shareholder) Ned 
Sherwood of attempting to use his board position to control the company and “creating a hostile 
and terrifying atmosphere” and denied the claims that he had stolen the chops and licenses.  At 
some point, several burly men came into the Shanghai office of ChinaCast and carted off 
several computers from the finance department.  


• XUE: has had low or negative operating margins during the entire time it has been public and 
reported gross margins half as high as EDU’s VIP segment despite being in the same business 
XRS: EDU, XRS, and LFT share a common pedigree – they all received pre-IPO investment 
from Tiger Global Investment Consulting (Beijing) Co. Ltd.’s Ms. Xiaohong Chen.  XRS’s 
current CFO, Joseph Kauffman, was previously with EDU.56   
 


To be clear, for-profit education is definitely not the worst industry in which to compete in China.  
Because of the Chinese focus on educational achievement, good providers have an ability to separate 
themselves from the herd.  However, the top tier is somewhat crowded, and particularly in an 
environment in which employee salaries are increasing rapidly, we view it as wholly unlikely that mass 
market57 education companies are able to generate gross margins in excess of 50%.

57 An example of a non-mass market education company is Metro Education (www.metro-education.com), which focuses 
on a particular international accounting certification. We cannot attest to Metro’s financials, but industry sources indicate 
that its Shanghai store level gross margin can reach 45%.

Above are the gross margins as reported in their financial statements for EDU and some of its 
competitors.  
 
 


Conclusion 
 


The best thing we can say about EDU right now is that it is probably not “a zero” in the conventional 
fraud sense.  It has a real business, and might even overall be profitable.  However, there is clearly a lot 
to be found beneath the hood once the auditor starts looking (e.g., the likely consolidation of heretofore 
unknown franchisees’ results and upfront fees, and fraudulent PRC financial statements).  It is probable 
EDU will restate earnings, and probable that Deloitte will resign.   
 
Beyond the immediate issues of the franchising and fraud, EDU shareholders need to consider the 
value of their investment in this legal structure.  The first problem is that EDU is a weak VIE.  The next 
problem is that the VIE owns the productive assets through schools.  According to law, those schools 
and their assets really belong to the PRC government.  Investors should take heed that PRC public 
company GAAP forbids consolidating schools.

!
P.F.: I’d like to know what the New Oriental will provide us with, how much it will cost to join the 
franchise, and what services you will provide?  
EDU: The franchise fee is like this, the franchise fee is different depending on various regions. And it’s 
evaluated based on several factors, the average staff salary, the GDP, the economic environment, the 
future developments and the geographical location, etc. There is also an overall evaluation of the city. 
This is why there was an initial understanding and simple discussion over the phone. After that, there 
would be an overall evaluation of the city, including an evaluation of the future site selection, 
evaluation of your personal abilities, your degree of enthusiasm for education, and other major factors. 
Finance is also part of the criteria, you have a certain financial strength from doing real estate 
development for such a long time. But will you be able to full-heartedly devote yourself to education? 
These are all things we will take into consideration during our future investigations. If the preliminary 
examination says that you are quite qualified, we’ll have a set of forms for you to fill out.  
P.F.: What’s an estimated amount of the franchise fee? Let me know so I can have an answer for my 
boss.  
EDU: Oh, you’re not the boss? 
P.F.: No, I’m not the boss. But I’m in charge of all the investment projects under the name of the 
company.  
EDU: The franchise fee is not quite the same as the few things we just talked about. The franchise fee 
is about 600,000-800,000 yuan.  
P.F.: If we do this, when doing this, will you give us the entire city to work on or is it counted by 
locations? We’re in Taixing city right now... (Pause) 
EDU: No, the entire city... (call dropped)
