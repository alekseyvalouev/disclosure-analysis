Cable Car Presentation at the Clinical Lab Fee
Schedule Public Meeting 
This entry was posted in All Ideas  and tagged advocacy EXAS video  on July 19, 2015.


Disclosure: Short EXAS.


On Thursday, July 16, I presented Cable Car’s reconsideration request regarding code G0464 on the
Clinical Lab Fee Schedule before the annual Public Meeting at CMS. The slide presentation is now
available for download. You can view my prepared remarks and those of the other speakers on
Youtube [starts at 24:45] or in the player embedded below.


I will publish a further comment and rebuttal to Kevin Conroy’s presentation after the public comment
window ends in August.


I appreciate having had the opportunity to share my perspective with CMS.
