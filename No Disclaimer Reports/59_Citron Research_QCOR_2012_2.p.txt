QUESTCOR UPDATE: AETNA
DENIES NEARLY ALL
COVERAGE FOR ACTHAR
GEL


Aetna (NYSE: AET) drops coverage for
Questcor’s only drug, for indications now
generating 95% of Questcor (NASDAQ:QCOR)
revenues. 


HP Acthar Gel for multiple sclerosis and
nephrotic symdrome will not be reimbursed. 


   This is not insurance pushback:  This
is Insurance Denial.


One of the largest managed care providers in the
United States, Aetna has disclosed that after
studies and review of scientific literature, it finds
no proof of efficacy to substantiate reimbursement
for Achtar, except for Infantile Spasms (West
Syndrome).


Beginning Friday, September 14 Aetna will cease
to offer reimbursement for new patients to use HP
Acthar Gel, except for the rare indication of
infantile spasms.

Analysts have been defending QCOR over the past
week, with claims like this one made as recently as
yesterday by Oppenheimer :


“Despite recent speculation about payers
looking at Acthar reimbursement with
increasing scrutiny, based on comments
from management, we believe
reimbursement rates to be strong and
expect that to continue.”


This statement couldn’t be any more wrong if they
tried.  Further, it should be noted that Questcor
CEO Bailey sold another $2 million worth of stock
last week. 


In Aetna’s assessment of Acthar, we read the one
line that says it all:


 “Aetna considers repository
corticotropin experimental and
investigational for all other indications,
because its effectiveness for
these indications has not been
established.”


Aetna justifies the change in reimbursement
by saying:


“This CPB is revised to state that repository
corticotropin is considered not medically
necessary for corticosteroid-responsive
conditions because it has not been
proven to be more effective than
corticosteroids for these indications.”


Note these words from Aetna.  This was not a
decision made because of increasing prices, but
rather due to the absence of clinical evidence
proving the clinical benefit of Acthar.


“Aetna has reached these conclusions based
upon a review of currently available clinical
information (including clinical outcome

studies in the peer-reviewed published
medical literature, regulatory status of the
technology, evidence-based guidelines of
public health and health research agencies,
evidence-based guidelines and positions of
leading national health professional
organizations, views of physicians practicing
in relevant clinical areas, and other relevant
factors”


Aetna’s medical policy committee composed of
internal /external experts within a range of
specialties has now come to the same conclusions
as the leading experts in Multiple Sclerosis,
Nephrotic Syndrome, and Rheumatology from the
most respected institutions in the United States.
The sales ramp of Acthar has been nothing more
than an exploit of inefficiency in the healthcare
system, and is not backed by any clinical data to
prove its merits beyond the original study
supporting its use for Infantile Spasms.


As the managed care companies continuously
subject their medical loss ratios to intense scrutiny,
Citron expects United Healthcare, WellPoint, and
Humana to follow Aetna within the next 12
months, and drop Acthar for all indications except
Infantile Spasms.  Aetna will prove to have been
the “first domino” in the chain of health insurance
reimbursement decisions made by the majors. 


When it comes to operations, joint policies are not
uncommon to major managed care programs.  The
industry leaders tend to “vote together”, as they
most recently did with regard to the anticipated
Supreme Court ruling on the new National Health
Care Act:

They have little choice but to present a united
front with regard to Questcor.  Otherwise,
competing plans place themselves at a significant
disadvantage, having to pay expensive claims for a
treatment without clinical proof to justify the high
expense. 


Did you not expect this would happen eventually?


   Short-Sighted Time Horizon?


Citron previously noted that Questcor can’t be
surprised that their day of reckoning was coming. 
Every month when they present their prescription
data they reassure investors in their 8-K’s:


“Insurance coverage continued to remain
favorable for Acthar during June 2012.”


“Insurance coverage to remain favorable for
Acthar during July 2012.”


“Insurance coverage continued to remain
favorable for Acthar during August 2012.”


That is doublespeak for “keep your fingers crossed
— so far so good…”


What are they going to say next month?


When a company claims a “multi-billion dollar
market opportunity” entirely based upon on
insurance reimbursement, and has to resort to
disclosure framed within a month-to-month time
horizon, it reveals how fragile the business model
truly is.


Shareholders take note:


This decision from Aetna enables all managed care
providers to exit the business of overpaying for an
expensive legacy drug by placing the burden of
proof unequivocally on Questcor.  Acthar
reimbursement was not dropped because Aetna
asserts Acthar does not work.  Acthar was dropped
because there is no clinical data (except for
Infantile Spasms) that proves that it does work
(any better than steroids).

So will Questcor now submit Acthar to formal
clinical trials to satisfy the managed health care
providers?    I think we know that answer.


Was this any surprise?


In the company’s last 10-K, the company clearly
states:


“Acthar is a high priced drug and the sale of
Acthar depends in part on the availability of
reimbursement from third-party payors
such as private insurance plans. In the
United States, there have been, and we
expect there will continue to be, a number
of state and federal proposals that limit the
amount that private insurance plans may
pay to reimburse the cost of drugs,
including Acthar. We believe the increasing
emphasis on managed care in the United
States has and will continue to put pressure
on the price and usage of Acthar. In
addition, current third-party reimbursement
policies for Acthar may change at any time.
Such changes could include lower
reimbursement or the loss of insurance
coverage”


   Conclusion:


This is no longer an argument.  One of the
country’s largest managed care providers has
drawn the line — years too late in our opinion, but
never too late to deliver affordable and efficient
healthcare to the American people.  Citron
expected Questcor would face insurance
“pushback” this year, but we didn’t anticipate that
a managed care provider the size of Aetna would
just cut it off altogether.  No second line or third
line here:  no reimbursement, period. 


Over the past two months we have spoken to
numerous shareholders and analysts on Questcor. 
It seems as if everyone was in agreement that
Acthar was not the “wonder drug” management
claimed, but the sales channel and reimbursement
program was intact.

To that we responded, “It is never a problem, until
it’s a problem…”  Ladies and gentlemen, it’s
official:  IT’S A PROBLEM!
