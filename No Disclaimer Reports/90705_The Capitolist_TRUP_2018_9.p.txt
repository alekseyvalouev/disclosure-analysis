TRUP


The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is meeting in San Francisco
this weekend, Pet Insurance is on the agenda.


Additionally, the Property and Casualty Insurance Committee will be considering if
new regulatory changes are warranted.


It is my belief that BOTH Referral Laws AND Solicitation Laws will be discussed by
the Committee.


Trupanion prides itself on utilizing the Veterinarian Channel more than its
competitors - over half of all new policy holders come from the Veterinarian channel
making TRUP the most exposed.

What Could They Possibly Find That Would Yield The Need For Additional
Regulatory Activities?


This weekend in San Francisco the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
will be holding its Fall National Meeting. The Agenda (LINK) includes a presentation
titled, "Hear the Status of Pet Insurance White Paper — Warren Byrd (LA)". The
presentation will be held on Saturday, November 17, 2018 at 1:00 – 2:30 p.m.
Continental 6—Hilton—Ballroom Level.


The presentation will be brought forward to the NAIC's Property and Casualty Insurance
Committee By Mr. Byrd. Membership of this Committee includes regulators from the
following states: Illinois, West Virginia, Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida,
Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto
Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota.


Warren Byrd is the Deputy Commissioner of Lousiana's Department of Insurance within
the Office of Property and Casualty.


A more detailed agenda (LINK) highlights the point of the committee meeting is to:
"Review findings in the pet insurance white paper and consider whether any
additional regulatory activities are warranted, including the possibility of drafting
a model law or guideline."


I've painstakingly highlighted the referral law issues in past reports such as, "Trupanion:
A Moonshot Valuation With Lingering Questions". However, I have spent the last few
weeks looking at the solicitation laws and the activities surrounding them.


As a reminder in "Trupanion: A Soliloquy On Solicitation" I highlighted the State of
Washington's Definition of Solicitation: RCW 48.17.010 (14) "Solicit" means attempting
to sell insurance or asking or urging a person to apply for a particular kind of insurance
from a particular insurer.


Trupanion's own document on the topic (LINK) says the following


"Therefore, veterinarians or their staff, who are not licensed, may not directly ask or
urge a pet owner to apply for a particular kind of insurance from a particular
licensed insurer."

"Therefore, veterinarians or their staff, who are not licensed, may not go into
specific product and policy details about the coverage of any specific company."


NASDAQ:TRUP has repeatedly said that they do not ask veterinarians or their staff to
sell or solicit insurance, but it is clear that it is not just a few rogue veterinarians
recommending Trupanion. This effort is coordinated by the company. While we
examined the websites of animal hospitals across the country, we discovered the exact
same "recommendation" language used at clinics across wide geographies. Although I
can not prove that the "we recommend Trupanion" language came from the
company. It is certainly worth the regulators time to understand how the same
language finds itself supporting a single insurance carrier in multiple states.


Let's look at an example from a state with an active investigation, Washington:

Veterinarian, this time in Oregon:

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.

Trupanion is entirely focused on the Veterinarian sales channel - any inquiry into it
poses a stock specific risk that is unlikely to negatively effect the rest of the pet
insurance industry (as none of the rest of the players focus on the veterinarian sales
channel to the same extent). I'll be focusing on whether the committee pursues
observations about that particular sales channel and if they have discovered the same
number of irregularities on the internet as I have.


I reiterate my $10 price target - it seems unlikely that the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners will be unable to find the information that a simple google
search yields. Thus I expect the regulatory landscape to get increasingly difficult for
TRUP - the end result will be higher costs and slower growth in order to facilitate
compliance.


Professional sceptic - I live in the footnotes
