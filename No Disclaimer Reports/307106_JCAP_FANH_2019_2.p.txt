The Corruption Scandal 
Engulfing Fanhua
 ‣ We believe that Fanhua has been implicated in a 


corruption case in China that saw a close associate from 
PICC P&C sentenced to 11 years in jail. Fanhua has been 
specifically barred since 2017 from selling P&C insurance 
for the biggest insurer in China. We think reputable in-
surance companies are now very reluctant to work with 
FANH. 


 ‣ Fanhua has failed to disclose guarantees for trust 
plans issued to finance subsidiary China Finance Hold-
ings (CNF) and for other corporate purposes. CNF’s pro-
spectus shows $682 mln in funds raised from trust plans 
and a default rate of over 12%. Although it is unclear 
how much liability Fanhua, a minority shareholder, bears, 
the guarantees for loans underlying the trust are explicit.


 ‣ Fanhua’s core insurance business is generating 
meager earnings. Investment income and Fanhua’s share 
of sub-prime lending by subsidiary CNF provided 73% of 
2017 profit and 109% of profit in 2016. Yet these income 
streams are highly vulnerable to China’s teetering prop-
erty market.


 ‣ We believe the “521” share incentive plan violates 
SEC rules. The plan has never been registered with the 
SEC, though it is a securities offering. The plan provides 
forward guidance on revenue and stock price in viola-
tion of SEC Regulation Full Disclosure (Reg FD). We have 
made a submission to the SEC pointing this out.

Fanhua (FANH)


Pariah 
Fanhua is being treated as a pariah agency by major Chinese insurers. According 
to our interviews with Chinese insurance regulators, FANH was dropped as a sales 
agent for the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) because of a suspected 
corrupt relationship. PICC now lists 40 different sales agents through which it 
sells its product, but PICC explicitly bars Fanhua. PICC’s importance in China’s 
insurance industry can hardly be overstated. Before it dropped Fanhua, PICC rep-
resented 27% of FANH revenue. PICC works with dozens of third-party insurance 
vendors, including automobile dealerships throughout China. A regulator from the 
CIRC told us that Fanhua was the only legitimate third-party agent with which 
PICC refuses to do business.1


Fanhua still employs a family member of the former president of PICC’s P&C di-
vision, Wang Yingcheng,2 who was detained in February 2017, shortly before 
PICC unilaterally dropped Fanhua as a partner. Wang was sentenced last May to 
11 years in jail on corruption charges. “I believe the relationship between Wang 
Yincheng and Fanhua Group is improper,” said an official of the Chinese Insurance 
Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to J Capital on condition of anonymity. His com-
ments were echoed by other regulators.


In China, top executives of state-owned companies like PICC are government offi-
cials. The relationship between Fanhua and Wang Yincheng could conceivably put 
the company at risk under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.


The relation, apparently an older brother, of the corrupt PICC executive stepped down 
from one position at Fanhua but continues to be an executive of at least two Fanhua 
subsidiaries. Public records show that Wang Jincheng3 was chairman of the super-
visory committee of Fanhua Insurance Surveyors & Loss Adjustors Holding Co., Ltd. 


¹ Within a week of Wang’s arrest, PICC P&C had suspended all business with FANH. FANH disclosed the 
termination to investors on March 3, 2017. The company’s 6-K reads as follows [our emphasis]:


On March 1, 2017, Fanhua's subsidiaries were notified verbally by PICC P&C's local branches 
that PICC P&C was temporarily suspending its business cooperation with Fanhua on areas 
such as insurance agency, brokerage and claims adjustment because certain of PICC P&C’s 
senior management members were being investigated by the government. As a decade-
long business partner of PICC P&C, the Company was disappointed by this unilateral 
notice. However, the Company also understands that as a state-owned enterprise, it may 
be necessary for PICC P&C to take such precautionary measures as a result of internal or 
external investigation. At this stage, the Company is unable to predict when and whether 
the business cooperation with PICC P&C might resume. The Company plans to engage in 
ongoing dialogue with PICC P&C and urges it to resume their mutual business cooperation 
relationship as early as possible.

Fanhua (FANH)


but resigned roughly two months after his detention. He remains an executive of 
Guangdong Fanhua Fangzhong Investment Management Co. Ltd. and Shenzhen Fan-
hua Huahong Zhengda Insurance Claims Adjustment Shanghai Branch.


Fanhua’s entanglement with the disgraced Wang Yincheng is an open secret in 
China and has been reported in the Chinese press. An article in the respected finan-
cial magazine Caijing, published in February 2018, reported that a relative of Wang 
Yincheng worked for Fanhua. The text is as follows:


Translation: According to a public announcement from China’s Central Com-
mission for Discipline Inspection, Wang Yincheng managed to used the 
benefits of his position to generate a profit for his relatives’ business activ-
ity. Based on industry rumors, a relative within Wang Yincheng’s immedi-
ate family is the actual controller of Fanhua Group. On March 1 of last year, 
branches of Fanhua received oral notice from PICC stating that, due to an 
investigation of top management, [PICC] has suspended its agency, brokerage, 
and claims-adjustment businesses with Fanhua.


Insurance regulators we interviewed told us that Wang Yincheng has been close to 
Fanhua founder Hu Yinan since Hu’s early days in Shenzhen.


We know based on interviews with regulators and Fanhua staff as well as from coun-
ty records from Shanxi Province that the two Wangs are closely related, probably 
brothers, born four years apart in 1956 and 1960. It is common in China for broth-
ers to share a character in their names, in this case, “cheng,” meaning “becoming.” 
The older brother’s “Jin” means “gold” and the younger brother’s “Yin” means “sil-
ver.” In Chinese, the surname comes first. A third close relation, Wang Baocheng,4 is 
partnered with the Fanhua brother in at least three companies in Shenzhen that we 
believe may benefit the former PICC executive. The companies are Shenzhen Bishen 
Biotech, Shenzhen Yindong Investment, and Shenzhen Jingbao Investment.5 


We think the corruption case may be the reason behind Fanhua’s supposed dives-
titure of its P&C businesses, the Fanhua Times unit, to Beijing Cheche Technology. 
FANH also suddenly divested its insurance brokerage business, Bocheng, to a related

party, Liu Tingting, and divested 19 P&C insurance subsidiaries, most of them to 
another related party, Yang Lin. FANH then announced that it had made a “strategy 
change” from P&C insurance to life insurance, which we believe was done to avoid 
the potential disclosure requirement regarding Wang Yincheng’s case. We note that 
Lai Qiuping, a co-founder of Fanhua, stepped down shortly after Wang Yincheng’s 
detention.


From these events, we believe that FANH was involved in Wang Yincheng’s corrup-
tion case.  The timeline of these events looks like this: 


In addition to these legal woes, the CIRC announced in December that Fanhua’s 
claims adjustment company in Hainan Province had broken the law by inflating ex-
penses. Fanhua was penalized in Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Hubei in 2018 for legal vio-
lations. These fines have not been reported to U.S. investors in apparent violation of 
SEC rules. Possibly Fanhua racks up so many fines that it doesn’t remember to report 
them.


The Fanhua Times “divestiture”
In its response to our first report, Fanhua said that Yang Lin, currently the ultimate 
owner of 11 of the 19 companies that Fanhua claims to have sold to Cheche, and the 
Yang Lin who built Fanhua’s business in Neijiang, Sichuan, are two different people 
with the same name. This does not change the fact that Fanhua divested companies 
to its own related party and not to a third party as claimed. The Yang Lin who re-
ceived Fanhua’s largesse is chief executive of Beijing Baoping Science and Technol-
ogy Co., in which Fanhua is invested. He is a shareholder with Fanhua co-founder 
Lai Qiuping in a company called Xinzhiying Asset Management. He is owner of the 
shell company to which Fanhua transferred its Fanhua Times assets. And he has 
been intermediary for at least 15 Fanhua transactions. 


Undisclosed guarantees
Fanhua is partially responsible for guarantees issued to large trust plans that its 
employees are asked to sell to benefit the company. Just one trust issued in summer 
2017 raised ¥2.05 bln ($304 mln). Most of the funds come due before July this year.

Fanhua (FANH)


We cannot estimate how much debt Fanhua has guaranteed, but several Fanhua-
guaranteed trusts are listed on this website: http://www.fotic.com.cn/6952.html. 
CNF discloses that Fanhua is a “service institution” for its trusts but not that it has 
issued guarantees. The CNF prospectus provides translations of three trust plans. 
Buried deep down are these words: “In this trust project, subordinated trustor’s 
related party Shenzhen Fanhua United Investment Group Co., Ltd. as a loan service 
institution cooperates with the trustee to handle loan marketing, loan acceptance, 
approval, post-loan management, overdue collection and other concrete pre-loan, 
in-loan and post-loan matters.” (page 6/20, CNF prospectus)


Where the “profit” comes from
Fanhua’s core insurance sales business delivers very little profit; in fact, all the 
profit comes from line items that have nothing to do with insurance. Interest in-
come, investment income, and the company’s 21% share in the CNF sub-prime 
lending business provided 73% of profit in 2017 and 109% of 2016 profit—meaning 
that the company would have lost money without these ancillary income streams. 


But these items bear significant, under-appreciated risks. 


Fanhua holds 20.58% of the newly listed subsidiary, CNFinance Holdings, which 
provides home equity loans to mostly sub-prime borrowers. “We typically facili-
tate home equity loans to MSE [Micro and Small Enterprise] owners in the form of 
installment loans with a monthly contractual interest rate typically ranging from 
0.9% to 1.3,” says the company in its prospectus. That means about 15% per year.


Fanhua’s share in CNFinance provided the company with ¥108 mln in 2017, fully

slowed dramatically, and default rates on loans are rising. The types of second-lien

than 1% in December.


CNF discloses a fast-rising delinquency ratio, which they said topped 12% in Q3 
2018: “The delinquency ratio for loans originated by us increased from 5.38% as of 
December 31, 2016 to 7.17% as of December 31, 2017, 11.49% as of June 30, 2018 
and further to 12.07% as of September 30, 2018.” (CNF prospectus, page 29)


Investment income
“Investment income” is the most concerning portion of Fanhua’s statements and 
yet provides the highest yield, contributing ¥191 mln to Fanhua’s profit in 2017, 
43% of the total. The investment income represents a 7.7% return on Fanhua’s 
short-term investments, which are currently ¥2.5 bln. Assuming that these short-
term investments are actually real and recoverable—dubious, in our view—the 
high return suggests that the company has put its money into risky private in-
vestments that do not have an implicit or explicit guarantee. Wealth management 
products sold by banks are at best returning 4% currently. Here is a sample:

annual returns. In fact, the only products offering such a high return are products 
issued by related party Chengchuang. For example, the Chengchuang Yujin M&A

Fanhua (FANH)


Fanhua would have investors believe that the investment income derives from high 
bank balances sitting in money market accounts. The 20-F disclosure from 2017 
reads as follows:


Investment income represents income received from short term investments 
in collective trust products and interbank deposits. Our investment income 
increased by 66.4% from RMB115.3 million in 2016 to RMB191.8 million 
(US$29.5 million) in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to more 
high return short term investment products in 2017. (2017 20-F page 61)


But our interviews with Fanhua employees indicate that Fanhua may itself be 
managing customer funds. Employees described investment products that Fanhua 
offers for sale to its own employees. The company promises an annualized return 
of 7% on a six-month investment of ¥100,000 and 8% on ¥300,000.


“Fanhua definitely makes a return on its trusts,” said a Fanhua Insurance employee 
in Hebei Province, specifying that Fanhua earns a return, not just a sales com-
mission. Companies acting strictly as sales agents do not receive a return; they 
are paid only a commission on sales. The returns are 6.3-8%, the employee said, 
depending on the type of trust product. The highest yield comes from a consumer 
receivables derivative trust. 


Fanhua insurance agents are selling financial derivatives designed by company co-
founder Lai Qiuping. We visited the offices of his Chengchuang Investment Compa-
ny.7

Fanhua (FANH)


There, we obtained a list of 40 investment products that Chengchuang is selling to 
the public. Chengchuang staff emphasized that the whole Fanhua insurance sales 
network sells these products.


Fanhua insurance company sales staff confirmed that they sell these products. 
They also sell funds designed by another Lai company called Chengdu Chuangjia-
rui.8 A member of the sales team of Fanhua Lianxing told us that her team sells 
Chengchuang private equity and trust products, funds managed by Puyi Fund 
(55.5% owned by Lai Qiuping’s Chengchuang and 31.1% owned by Yang Lin), 
and Puyi Investment products (Fanhua Puyi Investment Management Co. Ltd. is 
83.78% owned by Fanhua executive Yu Haifeng and 15.4% owned by Fanhua).


Fanhua sales agents told us that these fund products represent a small portion of 
sales but a very high proportion of net income and sales agent commissions. The 
salespeople we interviewed commented that financial products generally require 
an investment of ¥1 mln, while insurance policies cost a few thousand, so even 
though the volume of insurance policy sales may be much greater, investment 
products represent a high proportion of sales in terms of value. The fund com-
panies and insurance sales agents generally share offices, making it easy for the

insurance agents to sell financial products. When an insurance client buys a fi-
nancial product, a fund company staff member will open an account for him or her 
and book the sale for the fund company, although the insurance agents receives a 
commission. Co-location and inter-changeability of offices and staff mean that fund 
sales have become an integral portion of the Fanhua business. Sales of investment 
products are highly vulnerable to China’s volatile business cycle. We think Fan-
hua’s insurance sales business has shrunk, and the company is desperately trying 
to make up for the deficit with these investment products. 


The product descriptions being offered to fund clients are vague in the extreme. 
Chinese readers can see the product list on the website of the Guangdong AMC; 
descriptions are limited to product names, such as “equity fund phase 1” or “M&A 
fund phase 10.” Most of the products are short-term, and all are described as pri-
vate equity funds. While this might look unremarkable to international investors, 
the impression is misleading: the bland descriptions hide bundles of very risky 
securities that, we believe, are mostly invested in Fanhua’s own business. That am-
plifies the risk of investing in Fanhua.


Returns claimed for these investment products are as high as 145%.

Fanhua (FANH)


“Fanhua is the owner of these trust products,” said a manager Puyi Wealth Man-
agement, in which Fanhua owns a stake and whose financial products Fanhua sells. 
“If there is a default, Fanhua will make the payment. But that won’t happen.”


Interest income
Fanhua’s interest income computes to 6% of its cash and restricted cash balance, 
a return that is much higher than any bank could be providing. As shown above, 
banks at most are offering 4.2% on investments locked up for a year.


Fanhua is a weak player that has built the company by acquiring sales agencies all 
over China. But those agencies have no good reason to affiliate with Fanhua un-
less Fanhua provides superior payment. Payments to executives, whether for equity 
shares in companies or via share incentive plans, create incentive for sales agencies 
to remain part of the Fanhua network. But Fanhua, in an effort to improve share 
price by claiming high profitability, hides those transactions.


Now Fanhua, having lost the bulk of its business, is trying to make up for its weak-
ness by wading into the riskiest portion of China’s property market. We believe 
investors should flee this risky company.
