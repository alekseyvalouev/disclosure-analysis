Spruce Point Reiterates 50%-60% Downside Risk 
In Mercury Systems Based On New Findings


Spruce Point finds evidence to suggest that Mercury Systems (Nasdaq: MRCY) could be one of the companies affected by the 


alleged Super Micro Computer, Inc. (Supermicro) hack, and can demonstrate recent actions taken by management to obscure 


the relationship. We believe the Street is structurally misunderstanding the magnitude of the revenue delays and cyber 


compliance costs that Mercury – a company presently without a Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) – will face going 


forward. Based on our expert calls, we expect that cybersecurity-related costs could mount to 10% of revenues. Given that 


management felt it necessary to hide its relationship with Supermicro, we believe that Mercury needs to disclose to investors


the materiality of its exposure to Supermicro components, the financial impact of any product changes/recalls/replacements, 


and its plans to ensure the “security” of its mission-critical products on a go-forward basis.


Exposure Emanating From “Technology Partner” Supermicro


 On October 4th, Bloomberg published an in-depth article highlighting how China infiltrated 30 U.S. companies by inserting a tiny chip 


into Supermicro motherboards. Navy systems were mentioned specifically as an affected target. Mercury Systems and two of its 


recent acquisitions – Themis Computers ($175 million / Feb 2018) and Germane Systems ($45 million / July 2018) – each sells 


servers and other related IT equipment containing Supermicro motherboards to the Navy and other military branches.


 Providing secure and resilient solutions to prime and government customers is the essence of Mercury's business. Mercury mentions 


the words “secure” and “security” over 100 times in its annual report.


 Mercury, Themis, and Germane all listed Supermicro as a “technology partner” on their respective websites until last week, when 


nearly all references to the relationship were abruptly and surreptitiously removed between October 8-9 without explanation.


 The existence of Supermicro motherboards in Mercury’s rugged servers presents difficult-to-quantify tail risks, but could force product 


recalls and expensive supply chain adjustments, among other costly actions. As a precedent example, the Navy placed restrictions on 


IBM’s BladeCenter server line in 2015 over supply chain security concerns, less than a year after Chinese IT hardware manufacturer 


Lenovo acquired IBM’s server business. (USNI Article)


Cyber Compliance Is Likely To Drag On Revenue Growth And Materially Increases Costs


 A recent GAO report entitled “DOD Just Beginning to Grapple with Scale of Vulnerabilities” highlighted how testers playing the role of 


adversary were able to take control of systems relatively easily and operate largely undetected. Based on conversations with industry 


experts, we believe that the requirements for winning government business will be (and are being) rewritten with an emphasis on 


cyber resilience and a much higher cybersecurity standard. We suspect that new contracts awards are likely to be delayed as a result.

Spruce Point Reiterates 50%-60% Downside Risk 
In Mercury Systems Based On New Findings


 Based on our research, Mercury appears ill-prepared to address these new requirements given its relative shortage of cybersecurity 


personnel, and the fact that both its long-time CIO and long-time CISO recently departed in August 2018. We estimate that Mercury 


could have to spend up to 10% of revenue on cyber-related costs going forward, or otherwise make a costly acquisition to comply with 


these new customer expectations.


 Mercury has quietly hinted at some of these concerns through subtle changes to its 10-K risk factors and safe harbor provisions, and 


through recent job postings in supply chain procurement and quality control.


 On October 8th, Mercury introduced “50 Models To Its Rugged Server Product Line”- could this be a tacit admission of problems?


Deteriorating Financial Metrics, Undisclosed Signs Of Strain, And Evidence Of Misrepresentation


 In our first report, we highlighted Mercury’s risk of losing its small business status for government contracts. Mercury lost this status 


earlier this year, which has coincided with rising inventories relative to backlog convertible to revenues in the next 12 months.


 Mercury’s gross margins have now fallen below its “low target” of 45%, and could compress further due to Defense Federal 


Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) compliance issues and potential product recall costs from the Supermicro fallout.


 Additionally, Mercury recently amended its credit agreement for a third time in late September 2018, but never disclosed that it had 


amended the agreement previously in December 2017, just as it began factoring accounts receivable. Factoring accounted for a 


substantial 43% of FY18 operating cash flow.


Mercury’s Irrational Valuation Multiple Could Materially Contract


 Mercury currently has the highest valuation in the Aerospace & Defense industry despite posting the sector’s weakest cash flow as a 


percentage of revenue and average organic revenue growth.


 Sell-side analyst see just 9.5% upside in its share price, but haven’t factored in complications arising from its Supermicro relationship 


and rising cyber compliance costs.


 Taking these issues into consideration, and discounting Mercury’s multiple to the industry average, we estimate 50%-60% downside.

Implications For Investors


Mercury’s stock has risen in recent months due to increased government defense spending and the accelerated speed with which 


contracts are being awarded. The Themis/Germane acquisitions appeared to position Mercury to benefit from $100m of additional


revenue (~16% of FY 2019E revenue). However, the Street is ignoring a host of fundamental red flags in Mercury’s filings, near-


term tail risks stemming from its relationship with Supermicro, and the longer-term implications of rising cybersecurity costs.


Potential 


Near-Term


Supermicro 


Implications


Potential


Long-Term 


Cybersecurity 


Implications


 Product recalls and any charges or costs to the income statement attributable to inventory obsolescence or rising 


warranty claims


 Costs associated with new product introductions to replace motherboards, including sales, marketing, and educating customers 


about the product changes


 Ability to hit near-term quarterly sales and earnings targets may suffer


 Additional margin compression due to increased long-term costs related to cybersecurity monitoring and supply chain auditing


 Mercury has neither the executives nor human talent in place to address the growing cybersecurity threat. Hiring of technical


IT talent and/or external consultants versed in cybersecurity will materially increase costs.


 Experts we have spoken to suggest costs could rise up to 10% of revenues due to emerging cybersecurity demands


 Ability to hit long-term financial targets may suffer and multiples may contract due to the business’ changing cost structure


 Loss of business relationships


 Shareholder lawsuits


We believe owning Mercury at the current price is a terrible risk/reward proposition. The average analyst price target of ~$56/share 


implies just 9.5% upside, when not a single analyst is questioning the implications of replacing a key technology partner. 


We believe Mercury remains the most expensive stock in the A&D sector with 50%-60% downside risk.


Red Flags 


From 


Mercury’s 


SEC Filings


 Additional language added to Mercury’s 10-K risk factors and safe harbor provision regarding cybersecurity, compliance costs


 Warranty accruals as a % of sales have rapidly declined, which could indicate future earnings overstatement


 Mercury finally lost its designation as a “small business” contractor


 Cash flow conversion remains anemic and increased in Q4 primarily due to inventory accounting changes made after our 


critical report, raising concerns that management pulled levers in a fleeting attempt to deflect longer-term challenges. In 


particular, Mercury resorted to factoring receivables in FY 2018 to pull forward cash flow.


 Gross margins continue to fall well below its 50% target; mgmt. blames recent acquisitions as having lower margins


 Mercury’s inventory and planned inventory purchases remain historically elevated relative to its next 12 months backlog to be


shipped. Next 12 months backlog to be shipped relative to total backlog is at its lowest level in 6 years.


 Insider ownership is at a record low, while insiders continue to sell post our critical report in April

• Mercury has suggested that its Themis / Germane business will add $100m of revenues, 
but with its recent removal of its tech partnership with Supermicro – which it says 
supports “short lead times” – there is bound to be slippage to revenue expectations


• Furthermore, we expect the added burden of having to comply with new DFARS 
regulations to delay contract awards. Mercury must now certify its cybersecurity 
requirements.


• Our worst case assumes Mercury achieves 85% of run rate revenues, and base case 
assumes 90% of its C4I rugged server expectations


• Mercury trades at 4x sales vs. the industry at 2x. Given serious security overhangs, 
Mercury’s multiple should compress to the industry average.

• Our industry expert with 30yrs+ experience working with major primes in contracting

to 10% of revenues to deal with new regulatory requirements. We model this as a 
worst case outcome, and 5% as base case


• In the event that Mercury acquires a cybersecurity company rather than develop

forward, as well as the delays in revenue contract award opportunities it will face in its high-growth “command, control, 


communications, computers, and intelligence” (C4I) segment – expected to be a $100m business. 


Mercury does not even have a CISO at present, and only recently replaced its departed CIO.

Prospect Of Supermicro Hardware Hack Has 
Potential To Spur Near-Term Industry Change


Military cybersecurity is still a nascent field, and some assume that it will take time for firms to integrate relevant 


technologies into their products, or to shift their supply chains away from at-risk sources. However, the prospect of a 


Supermicro hardware hack could force affected hardware providers to act on these threats within a very short 


timeframe, as authorities and the public have taken notice of the threat.

With public awareness of the Chinese hack story high, relations with China cooling, and military spending cycles 


accelerated under the Trump administration, it would be no surprise if the government encouraged domestic sourcing 


or other remedial actions for companies tied to Supermicro within a relatively short period of time, forcing companies 


like Mercury to bring forward their cybersecurity-related spending rapidly.

Though a weak Chinese smartphone market and 


slowing global PC demand were also responsible

IBM’s server business to a Chinese company were 


also cited as a reason for poor share performance

There is precedent for military branches to act on sudden, demonstrated supply chain risks in short order: in May 2015, 


seven months after IBM sold its server division to Chinese hardware manufacturer Lenovo, the Navy placed restrictions 


on purchases of IBM/Lenovo BladeCenter products, and initiated a search for a new server provider for its Aegis 


Combat System. The DoD continues to issue warnings regarding potential Lenovo M&A of U.S. military IT providers.

Supermicro Denial Not Believed 
By The Market Based On Share Price


Supermicro has denied allegations of a security breach, but the company’s share price suggests that the market is 


skeptical of management’s defense.1 According to Bloomberg, an independent security expert detected a Supermicro-


related hardware intrusion at a U.S. telecom company several days after concerns were first raised about Supermicro, 


but the hack was of a different variety than that described by the initial Bloomberg report.2


Coincidentally, Mercury’s CISO and CIO both left the firm in August 2018 – just before the story broke – and Mercury 


subsequently removed nearly all references to Supermicro from its website (see forthcoming slides).

Mercury Obfuscating Relationship With 
Supermicro After The Bloomberg Report 


Themis and Mercury’s relationship with Supermicro was so strong that it was listed as one of their nine 


technology partners. However, following the Bloomberg report, Mercury quietly removed Supermicro as a partner 


from its website.


Given that Mercury cites the relationship as allowing it to deliver solutions with “significantly shorter lead times 


while ensuring high levels of value and reliability,” the loss of Supermicro as a technology partner will, at a 


minimum, cause short-term – and perhaps long-term – disruptions to the business. Mercury needs to address the 


impact of the lost partnership with investors, in addition to the describing the remedies which it may have to 


undertake to address potential security risks in both existing inventory and servers in the field.

Are “New Products” Really Just A Disguised Product 
Recall And Admission Of Hacked Products?


Immediately after removing references to Supermicro on its website, Mercury issued a press release on October 8 


stating its plans to add over 50 models to its Enterprise Series rugged rackmount server product line. We find the 


timing of this announcement suspicious.


By visiting Mercury’s re-seller websites, we see that this series has historically incorporated Supermicro 


motherboards. Is this “new product launch” really a disguised recall meant to address the Supermicro threat without 


drawing attention to the issue?

Looking carefully, we find that Mercury first added a reference to changes in “cybersecurity regulations and 


requirements” in its safe harbor statement on its Q1’17 earnings release (October 24, 2017). Just days earlier, on 


September 26, the Chief Accounting Officer resigned.1 It is likely during this period that Mercury was conducting due 


diligence on Themis Computers, which it announced its intent to acquire on December 21.2

Mercury Does Not Have The Personnel To 
Manage Growing Cybersecurity Concerns


Richard Jaenicke, Mercury’s Director of Strategic Marketing and Alliances, gave a presentation at the Embedded 


TechTrends conference in January 2018 entitled “Trusted Computing: The Convergence of Trusted, Safe and Secure”. 


By the middle of 2018 after our initial report, Jaenicke had left his position at Mercury.1


Between Jaenicke’s departure and the loss of its CISO and CIO, Mercury appears to have very few (if any) well-tenured 


executives or employees with deep knowledge of or experience in the cybersecurity space.

Mercury Is Hiring In Exactly The Areas 
One Would Expect…


Just last week, on October 11, Mercury opened positions for “Supply Chain Manager” and “Senior Quality Manager”. 


What more evidence do you need that Mercury has deficiencies in this area and costs are rising?


We find the job description for “Senior Quality Manager” particularly interesting in light of the Supermicro news…


Source: Mercury Careers Website


This job is in Mercury’s rugged secure microelectronics 


division, which manufactures products containing 


Supermicro components


Management now concerned about the quality of 


suppliers following the Supermicro fiasco?


Looking for people to ensure compliance with new 


cybersecurity-related IT manufacturing regulations?


Need people to manage product recalls, etc. in 


response to discoveries of cybersecurity threats like 


the Supermicro issue?


Making a greater effort to ensure cybersecurity 


standards are met among manufacturers of 


componentry?

Newly Disclosed “Government Relations” 
Board Committee


Looking carefully, we find in Mercury’s proxy statement filed in September 2018 mention of a newly-created


Government Relations Committee – created in 2017, but not disclosed until late 2018.


The #1 committee priority stresses “identifying and evaluating global security…issues, trends, opportunities, and 


challenges that could impact our business activities and performance”.


Does the creation of this committee suggest challenges with government relationships or a lack of important 


government relationships in the cybersecurity space?

We Hope Mercury Made Accurate 
Reps/Warranties To Its Bankers…


On October 1, 2018 Mercury filed Amendment No. 3 with the SEC stating that it had expanded its credit facility to $750m, 


extended the maturity to Sept 28, 2023 and reduced its interest rate. It currently has $240m outstanding on the facility.


As part of this amendment, Mercury made certain reps and warranties including that “No Material Adverse Effect” had taken 


place since closing. Does removing Supermicro as a key technology partner qualify?

Mercury’s Credit Agreement Points To 
Financial Misrepresentation


Mercury has claimed that cash flow will be fine in FY19, yet it just increased the size of its credit facility from $400m to $750m. In 


the process, Mercury divulged more evidence of financial misrepresentation. Mercury stated that it Amended its Credit Agreement 


on Dec 21, 2017. However, it never made mention of this Amendment, which would have been a material event requiring an 8-K 


financial disclosure. Mercury also should have mentioned that its A/R factoring began on Dec 2017, but this was not disclosed 


until Feb 2, 2018 when the 10-Q was filed. Mercury’s FY18 operating cash flow is inflated by $18.8m (43% of total).

Artificial Boost To Earnings By 
Under-Accruing For Warranty Reserves?


The evidence suggests that Mercury has been aware of growing cybersecurity issues for some time, yet it has not been 


accruing for warranties in proportion to its growing revenues – especially from the Themis acquisition. In fact, 


warranty accruals as a % of revenues has declined every single year, even though Mercury states that “product sales 


generally include a 12 month standard hardware warranty”.


By under accruing for warranties, could Mercury be materially overstating its future EPS?

Mercury


CEO Aslett on Q4’18 Earnings Call:


• “Gross margin was affected by product mix, including an increase in customer-funded R&D and early-stage programs. The inclusion of Themis, 


which has lower gross margins as well as an inventory step-up associated with the Themis purchase accounting.”


• “Germane will be dilutive to our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in FY 2019, but accretive to fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS”


Mercury is now spinning excuses for gross margin contraction as related to acquisitions…while not quantifying 


any added costs related to the loss of its small business designation, DFARS compliance requirements, or potential 


recalls and/or new product costs related to replacing Supermicro as a technology partner.

Poor Risk/Reward When “Consensus” View Is 
That Everything Is Fine….


Analysts have not critically evaluated the impact of Mercury’s relationship with Supermicro and the increased exposure 


stemming from its recent acquisitions of Themis and Germane Systems. In short, analysts blissfully endorse the acquisitions and 


pencil both a new $100m revenue stream and future margin expansion without pushing back on management’s assumptions.

 “Mercury is building a C4I rugged server business. Mercury highlighted how its acquisition of Germane 


benefits from its FY18 acquisition of Themis, which the company views as a platform to build upon. The two 


entities have complementary rugger server portfolios and cover much of the C4I market with an expected 


~$100 mn in revenue. Near-term, the Germane acquisition is dilutive to company-wide profitability but 


Mercury should achieve cost synergies after integrating the units and believes the combined entity will 


reach the midpoint of MRCY’s adjusted EBITDA margin target in 2020”


 “Acquisition focus strengthens competitive and market position Mercury has completed a series of acquisitions 


since 2011 that have transformed the company’s focus and strategy. Specifically, the acquisitions have both 


positioned the company for greater growth in its target markets, and more recently positioned the company to 


drive margin improvement. For example, the Themis Computer and Germane Systems acquisitions created a 


$100M C2I business focused on rugged servers.”


 “Investor reaction to Mercury’s acquisitions has been positive as we believe the company has done an 


impressive job of successfully integrating companies into its operations over the course of years and 


leveraging the results.”


 “Germane Systems is a provider of rugged services and storage systems for command and control (C2I) 


applications. The transaction is $0.05 accretive on our estimates but dilutive to group margins. Themis 


increased MRCY's capability in common processing systems with a platform to pick up share in the C2I arena. 


The $5MM of run rate synergies are from cost synergies and potential product transformation”


 “On a market-relative basis, MRCY trades at a ~40% premium to S&P on FY2 PE, down from a 3-year average 


premium of 65%. MRCY trades at a 4.3% FY2 FCF yield vs peer average of 5.7%”

• Mercury has suggested that its Themis / Germane business will add $100m of revenues, 
but with its recent removal of its tech partnership with Supermicro – which it says 
supports “short lead times” – there is bound to be slippage to revenue expectations


• Furthermore, we expect the added burden of having to comply with new DFARS 
regulations to delay contract awards. Mercury must now certify its cybersecurity 
requirements.


• Our worst case assumes Mercury achieves 85% of run rate revenues, and base case 
assumes 90% of its C4I rugged server expectations


• Mercury trades at 4x sales vs. the industry at 2x. Given serious security overhangs, 
Mercury’s multiple should compress to the industry average.

• We layer in additional long-term costs for the new DFARS cybersecurity compliance

• Our industry expert with 30yrs+ experience working with major primes in contracting 
and compliance believes that companies like Mercury should be prepared to absorb up 
to 10% of revenues to deal with new regulatory requirements. We model this as a 
worst case outcome, and 5% as base case


• In the event that Mercury acquires a cybersecurity company rather than develop 
needed cybersecurity capabilities in-house, it would effectively be capitalizing the cost 
with no revenue benefit, and with incremental interest expense cost

Mercury does not even have a CISO at present, and only recently replaced its departed CIO.

Mercury Purged Its Website Of Supermicro 
References Almost Entirely


That Mercury cleansed its website of Supermicro references almost entirely such a short time after the hacking story 


broke is deeply concerning – both because it suggests that management is genuinely concerned about the security 


implications of the hack, and because management went out of its way to sweep its connection to Supermicro under the 


rug as quietly as possible.


If the product risk is real – as management’s actions suggest – it should have been disclosed, not swept away.
