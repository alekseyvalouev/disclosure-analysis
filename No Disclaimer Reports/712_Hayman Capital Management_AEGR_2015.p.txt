II. GROUNDS FOR STANDING UNDER 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(A). 


Petitioner certifies that the ‘135 patent is available for inter partes review, and 


that Petitioner is not barred or estopped from requesting an inter partes review 


challenging the patent claims on the grounds identified in this Petition.  No RPI has 


filed a civil action challenging the validity of the ‘135 patent, nor has any RPI been 


served with a complaint alleging infringement of the ‘135 patent more than one year 


prior to the filing of this Petition. 


The public interest requires ensuring monopoly privileges are not granted by 


an invalid patent, particularly because Juxtapid® sells for more than $900.00 per pill, 


and costs nearly $330,000 per patient per year.  (See CFAD Ex. 1024; CFAD Ex. 


1025).  Patentee and its licensee, Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have secured such 


pricing through FDA regulatory exclusivity and BMS’s lomitapide molecule 


patents, but cannot extend it with the obvious ‘135 patent.  


III. IDENTIFICATION OF CHALLENGE (37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)). 


Petitioner respectfully requests inter partes review and cancellation of claims 


1-10 of the ‘135 patent based on the grounds set forth in the table below:

Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966) (reciting four-factor obviousness test).   


In support of these grounds for unpatentability, Petitioner submits the expert 


declaration of Randall M. Zusman, M.D. to discuss the relevant field and art in 


general, and the factual and opinion bases for each of the Graham factors underlying 


Petitioner’s Grounds 1 and 2.  (CFAD Ex. 1002).  Petitioner also submits the 


declaration of pharmacokinetics expert Michael Mayersohn, Ph.D., on the specific 


dosing-related teachings.  (CFAD Ex. 1003).  Petitioner further relies on the Exhibits 


set forth on the concurrently filed Exhibit List, including the Pink Sheet 2004 (CFAD 


Ex. 1013), Stein 2004 (CFAD Ex. 1014), and Chang (CFAD Ex. 1015) references.  


Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 publications were not before the examiner during 


the substantive prosecution of the application leading to the ‘135 patent; patentee 


submitted those references in September 2013 only after receiving a second Notice 


of Allowance.  Chang was cited but never substantively discussed.  


IV. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT. 


The ‘135 patent claims are invalid.  They merely claim methods of using a 


known drug, to treat known medical conditions, for which the drug was known to be 


effective, with known dose-titration methods disclosed in the prior art.   


The ‘135 patent issued on December 31, 2013 from Application No. 


13/046,118 (the ‘118 Application) filed March 11, 2011, itself a continuation of
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


6 





Application No. 10/591,923 (the ‘923 Application) filed March 7, 2005.1  The patent 


recognizes hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are characterized by elevated 


serum levels of cholesterol (total and LDL-C) and lipids (e.g., triglycerides (TG)), 


which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  (CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 1:24 – col. 


2:3).  The ‘135 patent characterizes as inventive treating hyperlipidemia or 


hypercholesterolemia with drugs that inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer 


proteins (“MTP”), i.e., MTP inhibitors, by applying step-wise escalating dosing 


regimens.  (See id. at col. 7:11-24; col. 11:60 – col. 13:23). 


Administering anti-cholesterol drugs in step-wise escalating doses was 


standard practice with, e.g., statins, fibrates, and niacin.  (CFAD Ex. 1002 


(“Zusman”) ¶¶ 37-38, 40, 43-47).  Dr. Evan Stein specifically taught applying step-


wise escalating dosing to the MTP inhibitor implitapide to treat hyperlipidemia and 


hypercholesterolemia—facts published before the relevant filing date.  (See CFAD 


Ex. 1013; CFAD Ex. 1014).  Dr. Stein also disclosed the rationales for this dosing 


approach:  minimizing side effects, rendering MTP inhibitors marketable as adjunct 


therapy to statins; and treating patients not effectively treated by statins.  (Zusman, 


¶¶ 69-70, 103-04; CFAD Ex. 1003 (“Mayersohn”) ¶¶ 57, 59-60). 


                                           
1 Patentee cannot claim priority to its March 5, 2004 provisional application given 


the elements of the issued claims of the ‘135 patent.  (See Section V, below).
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


7 





The ‘135 patent’s named inventor, Dr. Rader, was a clinical investigator on 


the September 2003 implitapide studies Dr. Stein designed and led.  (CFAD 


Ex. 1020:8).  Dr. Rader filed his provisional application in March 2004.  But before 


then, two February 2004 publications (one by Dr. Stein and another by The Pink 


Sheet) had already disclosed Dr. Stein’s implitapide step-wise escalating dosing.  


(See Section IX, below).  Yet Dr. Rader initially claimed he invented step-wise 


dosing for all MTP inhibitors.  (See CFAD Ex. 1008:28-31).  As issued, the ‘135 


patent claims merely apply Dr. Stein’s step-wise escalating dosing approach to the 


MTP inhibitor lomitapide.  (See CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 19:42-67 (claim 1)).   


The ordinarily-skilled artisan required no great leap to apply Dr. Stein’s 


implitapide dosing regimen to other MTP inhibitors such as lomitapide.  (Zusman, 


¶ 33; Mayersohn, ¶ 27).  Lomitapide was a known, potent MTP inhibitor.  (See 


CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 5:47–col. 6:19; Zusman, ¶ 24).  The prior art taught 


lomitapide’s efficacy in vitro, in animal models, and in humans, and also taught 


lomitapide had clinical effects similar to implitapide.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 62-63, 96-99; 


Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18-19; see also CFAD Ex. 1015:563-66).  


 As detailed below, the published prior art disclosures and the skilled artisan’s 


motivation to apply step-wise escalating dosing regimens to MTP inhibitors 


(including lomitapide) with a reasonable expectation of success render independent 


claims 1, 9, and 10, and dependent claims 6-8 of the ‘135 patent obvious at the time
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


8 





of filing.  The additional elements found in dependent claims 2-5 merely reflect uses, 


targets, and results already known or inherent in the dosing method itself.  (Zusman, 


¶¶ 150-165; CFAD Ex. 1015:562, 565-66). 


For the reasons set forth herein, under 37 C.F.R. § 42.22(A), Petitioner 


requests Inter Partes Review and cancellation of claims 1-10.  Petitioner’s detailed 


statement of the reasons for the relief requested appears in Sections V-X below. 


V. THE ‘135 PATENT PRIORITY DATE IS MARCH 7, 2005; THE ‘915 
PROVISIONAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ISSUED CLAIMS. 


The ‘135 patent claims receive the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent 


Application 60/550,915 (“the ‘915 Provisional”) only if that application “describe[s] 


an invention, and . . . in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly 


conclude that [Dr. Rader] invented the claimed invention as of the filing date 


sought,” such that he was “in possession of” the invention.  See Lockwood v. Am. 


Airlines, Inc., 107 F.3d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Trading Techs. Int’l Inc. v. 


eSpeed, Inc., 595 F.3d 1340, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The ‘915 Provisional does not 


support the claimed dose ranges or the piperidine N-oxide derivatives.   


A. No Support for the Full Scope of the Claimed Dose Ranges. 


Independent claim 1 recites a step-wise escalating dose method where the first 


dose ranges from “about 2 to about 13 mg/day”; the second “from about 5 to about 


30 mg/day” and the third “from about 10 to about 50 mg/day,” with dose escalation 


at “about 1 to about 5 weeks.”  (CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 19:40–67).  Independent claims
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


9 





9 and 10 recite similar dosing steps, but change the timing of the dose escalation.  


(See id., col. 20:23 – col. 21:18).  The ‘135 patent’s specification lists various dose 


ranges and numbers of dosing steps for MTP inhibitors.  (See id. at col. 11:60 – 


13:29).  That section includes the particular dose ranges claimed (id. at col. 12:45-


51), but this language was conspicuously absent from the ‘915 Provisional, which 


focused on different dose-range combinations.  (Compare CFAD Ex. 1006:14-15).  


The claimed dose ranges are new matter.  (Zusman, ¶ 82; see CFAD Ex. 1007 


(“Demonstrative”)). 


While the claim terms need not appear in haec verba, the provisional lacks 


any equivalent description of the claimed subject matter.  The particular numerical 


ranges claimed (e.g., about 2-13 mg/day for the first dose) cannot be teased out of 


the multiplicity of dose ranges listed in the ‘915 Provisional, either expressly or 


inherently.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 83-90; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 76-103).  Nor can Patentee support 


the full scope of the claimed ranges merely by pointing to a species within, or a 


genus beyond, the ‘915 Provisional.  See Trading Techs., 595 F.3d at 1359 (skilled 


artisan must understand from the application “the genus that is being claimed has 


been invented, not just the species of a genus”) (citations omitted); Carnegie Mellon 


Univ. v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., 541 F.3d 1115, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (skilled 


artisan must visualize or recognize from the specification all members of the claimed 


genus).  Nor may Patentee support the claimed mg/day doses from the other dose
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


10 





amounts, sometimes expressed as mg/day, other times as mg/kg, found in the ‘915 


Provisional.  See Ex parte Zeying Ma & Yubai Bi, Appeal 2013-001589, 2014 WL 


1005343, at *3-*4 (P.T.A.B. January 27, 2014) (specification’s thirty-five 


embodiments across six tables omitted specifically-claimed ranges).  


Patentee’s specification deliberately added new matter reciting the claimed 


dose/range combinations to the ‘923 Application filed in March 2005, confirming 


the ‘915 Provisional lacked the “illustrative examples or terminology” or “blaze 


marks” skilled artisans require to identify and determine the particular genus 


ultimately claimed.  See In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 496 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Purdue 


Pharma, L.P. v. Faulding, Inc., 230 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Without 


the ‘915 Provisional date, the ‘135 patent’s priority date is March 7, 2005.  


B. In Addition, No Support for “the Piperidine N-oxide Thereof”. 


The ‘135 patent claims require using an MTP inhibitor that is either the 


illustrated compound (lomitapide), salts thereof, or “the piperidine N-oxide thereof.”  


(CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 19:40 – col. 21:18).  The specification lacks any example by 


structure, chemical language, synthetic process or clinical test showing a lomitapide 


“piperidine N-oxide” derivative.  The ‘915 Provisional nowhere uses the term, or 


presents by structure, a “piperidine N-oxide.”  The only discussion of “piperidine” 


compounds in the ‘915 Provisional beyond the proffered chemical structures is, “[i]n 


some embodiments the MTP inhibitors are piperidine, pyrrolidine or azetidine
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


11 





compounds.”  (CFAD Ex. 1006:11).  The ‘915 Provisional thus fails to adequately 


describe or support the claimed “piperidine N-oxide” lomitapide derivative or its 


therapeutic use.  


Patentee cannot rely on the many patents incorporated by reference in the ‘915 


Provisional’s specification, which encompass a massive genus of structures, to 


support a purported lomitapide piperidine N-oxide derivative.  See Novozymes A/S 


v. Dupont Nutrition Biosciences APS, 723 F.3d 1336, 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  


In Novozymes, the patentee’s provisional disclosed “a potentially enormous number” 


of structural variants with myriad combination possibilities at multiple structural 


locations.  Id. at 1343.  Like the ‘915 Provisional, Novozymes’ “did not point out the 


specific [structural] variants later claimed in the [issued] patent,” but gave “only 


generalized guidance.”  Id. at 1343, 1346.  The ‘915 Provisional’s generalized 


piperidine discussion never identifies an N-oxide “variant that actually satisfies the 


claims, nor is there anything to suggest that [patentee] actually possessed such a 


variant at the time of filing.”  Id. at 1348.  The ‘915 Provisional fails to adequately 


describe or support the “piperidine N-oxide thereof” limitation.  


Because the ordinarily-skilled artisan would not accept that Dr. Rader 


“possessed” treatment methods using piperidine N-oxide compounds of lomitapide 


at the time of filing, the ‘135 patent claims do not receive the benefit of the ‘915 


Provisional filing date.  The references presented below are therefore prior art under
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


12 





pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) whatever the priority date, and also under pre-AIA 35 


U.S.C. § 102(b) because, as shown below, they were published more than a year 


before the filing of the ‘923 Application.   


VI. SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE PRIOR ART. 


Subsections A and B below discuss the state of the art before March 5, 2003, 


while subsection C covers up to March 5, 2004.    


A. Elevated Serum Cholesterol and Lipid Levels Were Recognized 
Risk Factors For Cardiovascular Disease. 


Decades ago, doctors and scientists recognized hypercholesterolemia (high 


serum cholesterol levels) and hyperlipidaemia (high serum lipid levels) as key 


atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (“ASCVD”) risk factors.  ASCVD was and 


remains a major cause of premature mortality in the Western world.  (See Zusman, 


¶¶ 35-42; CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 1:24-25).  The field has been actively researched for 


decades; cholesterol- and lipid-lowering drugs are commonplace in the physician’s 


armamentarium and patients’ medicine cabinets.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 43-49). 


B. Known Drug Classes and Dosing Regimens Pre-March 2003. 


Fibrates, statins and niacin were known drug classes used with 


hypercholesterolemic patients to reduce lipid levels before March 2003.  (Id.)  Due 


to their side effect profiles, such drugs were frequently administered using step-wise 


dose escalation.  (See id. at ¶¶ 43-47, 65; see also CFAD Ex. 1021 (fibrate doses 


“individualized according to patient response” and “adjusted if necessary” at “4 to 8
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


13 





week intervals.”); CFAD Ex. 1021, (LIPITOR®, ZOCOR®, MEVACOR®) 


(recommending starting patients on the drug at low doses and titrating upward 


according to “patient response” at intervals of “4 weeks or more.”); CFAD Ex. 1021, 


(NIASPAN®) (drug dosed beginning “at 500 mgs qhs in order to reduce the 


incidence and severity of side effects;” after four weeks, the dose doubles; and after 


the eighth week the physician is to “titrate to patient response and tolerance” up to a 


maximum recommended dose of 2000 mg daily with the daily dose not “increased 


more than 500 mg in a 4-week period.”)).  


MTP inhibitors.  Microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins (MTP) play a 


central role in lipoprotein assembly.  They mediate triglyceride absorption from the 


intestine and lipoprotein secretions from the liver by linking lipids to apolipoprotein 


B (apoB).  MTP inhibitors reduce plasma levels of LDL-C, VLDL lipoproteins and 


chylomicrons.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 55-58; CFAD Ex. 1015:562-63).  By 2003, some 


MTP inhibitors had shown significant animal and human efficacy, including with 


subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (“FH”).  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 59-61; CFAD 


Ex. 1015:564-67).  But, administering MTP inhibitors as a monotherapy at higher 


doses—needed to achieve lipid-lowering effects comparable to statins—


unsurprisingly produced comparatively higher side effects, including liver-fat 


accumulation.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 64, 69; CFAD Ex. 1015:567). 


Chang highlighted three MTP inhibitors as having progressed to human
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


14 





clinical trials by 2003:  Pfizer’s CP-346086; Bayer’s 13-9952 (implitapide); and 


BMS’s 201038 (lomitapide).  Chang reported the three drugs had “similar efficacy” 


in clinical studies.  (CFAD Ex. 1015:566).  Chang also recognized that “MTP 


inhibitors have demonstrated impressive lipid lowering efficacy in clinical studies,” 


but also that “potentially significant adverse effects surround this mechanism.”  (See 


id. at 567).  Several drug companies looking at MTP inhibitors as monotherapy 


alternatives to statins had dropped their MTP inhibitor programs—including BMS 


with lomitapide.  (See id.; CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 8:27-30).  As Chang explained, those 


decisions were not because the drugs didn’t work; rather, “statins have raised the 


hurdles for successfully marketing MTP inhibitors, or any other future lipid lowering 


approach.”  (CFAD Ex. 1015:567) (emphasis added).  Chang concluded that “a 


readily managed therapeutic index will be critical for the progression of inhibiting 


MTP as a viable chronic lipid lowering therapy.”  (Id.)   


Combination therapy.  In November 2002 FDA granted Merck approval to 


market ezetimibe (ZETIA®), alone or combined with a statin, to reduce elevated 


total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B in primary hyperlipidemia patients, and in combination 


to reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial 


hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  (Zusman, ¶¶ 70-71; CFAD Ex. 1017:2; CFAD Ex. 


1022, (ZETIA®)).  Merck’s ZETIA® success renewed interest in MTP inhibitors.  


Shortly after ZETIA®’s approval, and at least by September 2003, Dr. Stein was
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


15 





pursuing clinical trials of implitapide for adjunctive therapy, combination use, and 


use in HoFH patients.  (See CFAD Ex. 1020:2-3, 8-9 (citing ref. D8)).       


C. The Content of the MTP Inhibitor Art Pre-March 2004. 


The literature resolved Chang’s concerns about managing MTP inhibitors’ 


therapeutic index for commercial marketing purposes, in: (1) a February 5, 2004 


presentation by Dr. Evan Stein discussing PPD, Inc.’s plans for the MTP inhibitor 


implitapide (Stein 2004); and (2) a February 16, 2004 Pink Sheet article—


“Bayer/PPD Implitapide Development Follows Zetia Model As Statin Add-On”—


reporting on Dr. Stein’s presentation and publishing his dosing strategy for MTP 


inhibitors (Pink Sheet 2004).  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 137-40, 142-43, 206, 208-11, 213-


15).  Dr. Stein acknowledged the marketing hurdles Chang noted, but taught 


ZETIA®’s success created an opportunity and model for MTP inhibitors.  (See 


CFAD Ex. 1013:1).  Dr. Stein’s publications also disclosed step-wise dosing of MTP 


inhibitors addressing Chang’s therapeutic index concerns.  (See CFAD Ex. 1014:37-


38; see also CFAD Ex. 1015:567; Zusman, ¶¶ 103-05, 110).  


In Section X below, Petitioner relies on Pink Sheet 2004 in view of Chang 


(Ground I), or Stein 2004 in view of Chang (Ground II) to demonstrate that claims 


1-10 of the ‘135 patent are invalid for obviousness.    


1. Pink Sheet 2004 is Prior Art. 


“The Pink Sheet” is a printed publication directed to the pharmaceutical and
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


16 





biopharmaceutical industries which provides “[u]p-to-date pharma/biotech news—


at your desk—from your trusted source for over 65 years.”  (See CFAD Ex. 1013:1).  


In addition to print and mail circulation, the Pink Sheet is available online and 


circulated in electronic format to subscribers, providing headlines and breaking news 


alerts with links to stories analyzing notable events, industry news, and trends.  (See 


http://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily; Zusman, 


¶¶ 106-07; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 23-24).  The Pink Sheet was and would have been 


reviewed and considered by persons of ordinary skill in the art.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 106-


07; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 23-24).  The Pink Sheet 2004 reference was published and dated 


February 16, 2004.  (See CFAD Ex. 1013; Mayersohn, ¶ 23).  There is thus no 


reasonable dispute that Pink Sheet 2004 is within the scope and content of the prior 


art under pre-AIA Section 102(a) irrespective of priority date.  It is also prior art 


under pre-AIA Section 102(b) since Patentee cannot claim priority to the ‘915 


Provisional.  (See Section V above). 


2. Stein’s 2004 Presentation – Published Before March 5, 2004 
and Again by At Least April 15, 2004 – is Prior Art. 


The February 5, 2004 Stein presentation was given (and webcast) at PPD, 


Inc.’s Analyst Day and publicized weeks beforehand.  PPD distributed a hyperlink 


for “all interested parties” to register for the event or the webcast.  (See CFAD Ex. 


1005:4).  Stein 2004 was targeted to financial analysts, investors, and skilled artisans 


interested in drug discovery and development; it was reported in The Pink Sheet, a 



http://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


17 





publication targeting the pharmaceutical industry.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 106-10; Mayersohn, 


¶¶ 23-25).  The presentation itself and the underlying slide set are each “printed 


publication” prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(a) and (b).   


To be a prior art “printed publication” under 35 U.S.C. § 102, “the reference 


[must be] made sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art before the 


critical date.”  See, e.g., Voter Verified, Inc. v. Premier Election Solutions, Inc., 698 


F.3d 1374, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Stein’s 


presentation and his underlying slides (later posted online) were two separate 


publications of Stein 2004 under the four-factor test used to determine whether 


“ephemeral” or transient presentations qualify as “printed publications”  under 35 


U.S.C. § 102.  See In re Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“[a] the 


length of time the display was exhibited, [b] the expertise of the target audience, [c] 


the existence (or lack thereof) of reasonable expectations that the material displayed 


would not be copied, and [d] the simplicity or ease with which the material displayed 


could have been copied.”). 


The Stein Presentation itself qualifies under Klopfenstein as Section 102 


prior art when presented.  Klopfenstein’s first factor (time displayed) focuses on “the 


opportunity of the public in capturing, processing and retaining the information 


conveyed by the reference.”  380 F.3d at 1350.  This factor confirms Stein 2004 was 


published, since a skilled artisan could have captured (or recorded), processed and
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


18 





retained the relevant material—including the material arguably of most interest to 


an ordinarily-skilled artisan: the “Proposed MTP Development Plan” describing the 


implitapide trials and dosing regimen.  (See CFAD Ex. 1014:36-38).  The Pink Sheet 


2004 captured and published the salient concepts—including the increased step-wise 


dosing regimen.  (See CFAD Ex. 1013). 


The second factor (expertise of the target audience) also confirms Stein 2004 


as a Section 102 publication.  “A reference, ‘however ephemeral its existence,’ may 


be a ‘printed publication’ if it ‘goes direct to those whose interests make them likely 


to observe and remember whatever it may contain that is new and 


useful.’”  Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d at 1351 (citations omitted).  PPD, Inc., through the 


Stein 2004 presentation, reported its plans to develop the MTP inhibitor implitapide 


(licensed from Bayer), which was a member of a promising new class of lipid-


lowering drugs with a new mechanism of action.  (See Zusman, ¶ 20 (skilled artisans 


were “particularly interested in drugs under development from a different drug class 


with a different mechanism of action”).  Implitapide was known in the art to have 


shown success in early clinical studies.  (See CFAD Ex. 1015:566).  PPD had 


publicized its Investor Day presentation for weeks, and provided a hyperlink for “all 


interested parties” to register for the event or the webcast.  (CFAD Ex. 1005:4).  The 


skilled artisan would have taken great interest in this presentation.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 


20-22).  Stein 2004 was targeted directly to skilled artisans and others interested in
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


19 





drug discovery and development, and was reported in The Pink Sheet, a publication 


targeting the pharmaceutical industry.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 106-10; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 23-


25).  The information was available “direct[ly] to those whose interests make them 


likely to observe and remember” what Stein offered that was “new and useful.”  See 


Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d at 1351.  


The third factor (expectation of copying) again favors finding Stein 2004 was 


a publication.  There is no evidence Stein or PPD intended to keep Stein’s 


presentation private; no expectation of privacy in a webcast presentation exists 


absent attempts to keep it private.  See Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d at 1351.  Finally, the 


fourth factor (ease of copying) favors Stein 2004’s publication.  It would have been 


simple for the skilled artisan to copy the relevant information from the Stein 


presentation.  The Pink Sheet did copy and distribute the step-wise escalating dosing 


regimen.  (See CFAD Ex. 1013).  Under Klopfenstein, Stein 2004 became a “printed 


publication” when delivered; it is Section 102 prior art to the ‘135 patent.   


The Stein Presentation Slides, once posted online for viewing/download, 


were a second, re-publication of Stein 2004.  Stein 2004’s slides meet Klopfenstein 


for all of the reasons discussed above for the Stein 2004 presentation.  And, PPD 


posted the Stein 2004 slides on a clearly marked, tabbed and indexed page (“PPD 


News and IR Presentations”) (see CFAD Ex. 1004:4-5) on a public website 


(www.ppdi.com) (see id.), making the presentation available for review or download

before the critical date by anyone with a browser and Internet connection.  Such an 


online document/recording is a Section 102 printed publication.  See Suffolk Techs., 


LLC v. AOL Inc., 752 F.3d 1358, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Voter Verified, 698 F.3d 


at 1380-81.   


Stein was available for download before March 5, 2004: Petitioner need not 


prove the specific date Stein 2004 became publicly available, only that in the 


ordinary course of PPD, Inc.’s business, Stein 2004 would have been accessible by 


the critical date.  See, e.g., In re Hall, 781 F.2d 897 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  Evidence of 


routine business practices may establish the performance of a specific act.  Id. at 899 


(doctoral thesis was “most probably” publicly available before the critical date based 


on the “library’s general practice” and “estimating the time it would have taken to 


make the [thesis] available.”).  Here, PPD, Inc.’s January 2004 press release for the 


February 5, 2004 Analyst Day stated that it would make Stein 2004 available online 


“shortly after the call for on-demand replay.”  (CFAD Ex. 1005:4).  This statement 


suggests that Stein 2004 was posted online for download within days of the February 


5, 2004 presentation, and thus well before March 5, 2004. 


Furthermore, the Internet Archives’ recorded images of the same “PPD News 


and IR Presentations” webpage on which Stein 2004 was posted show that PPD, Inc. 


had an established pattern and practice in 2003-2004, i.e., an ordinary course of 


business, of uploading presentations to its website for review and download within

2004.  See Hall, 781 F.2d at 899.  


 Thus, Stein 2004 became a printed publication on the day it was presented, 


but at least by the time it was posted to the PPD website “shortly after”—which per 


PPD’s own statement, custom and practice was “most probably” before the March 


5, 2004 filing date of  the ‘915 Provisional.  See Hall, 781 F.2d at 899. 


Finally, if there were any doubt Stein 2004 was published before March 5, 


2004, it was surely available for download no later than April 15, 2004, as captured 


by the Internet Archive.  (See CFAD Ex. 1004:4-5).  This information, coupled with 


the affidavit provided by the Internet Archive (CFAD Ex. 1004), also establishes 


Stein 2004 as a prior art printed publication.  Stein 2004 is prior art under at least 35 


U.S.C. §§ 102(a) and (b).  (See Section V, above).  


3. The Prior Art Taught Step-Wise MTP Inhibitor Dosing Over 
Seven Levels; the Rationale; and Expected Efficacy. 


As noted above, Chang seemingly left open the question of how to position 


MTP inhibitors to make them commercially attractive given the success of statins.  


Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 each answered this question by publishing PPD’s 


planned approach with the MTP inhibitor implitapide.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 69, 100-10; 


CFAD Ex. 1013, passim; CFAD Ex. 1014:19-45).  


Pink Sheet 2004 recognized Dr. Stein had identified a different way to view 


MTP inhibitors.  Rather than replacing statin therapy, artisans could follow the 


pathway established with ZETIA®: use them as add-on therapy in combination with
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


23 





statins.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 69, 77-78, 108; CFAD Ex. 1013:2).  This option was attractive, 


because ZETIA® had “come onto the market and obtain[ed] a significant market 


share.”  (CFAD Ex. 1013:2 (quoting Stein)).  As Stein 2004 noted, “Even 3% of [the 


lipid-reducing] Market is “Block Buster”.  (CFAD Ex. 1014:45). 


The Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 provide another reason to pursue MTP 


inhibitors: “even high-dose statins are ineffective or inadequate” for patients with 


homozygous and severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (“HoFH” and 


“HeFH”).  (Zusman, ¶¶ 50-54, 69, 102-04, 110; CFAD Ex. 1013:2 (quoting Stein); 


CFAD Ex. 1014:40-42).  Stein 2004 taught for HeFH patients (~500,000 in the U.S.), 


“current drug therapies lower LDLC about 50-60%, but about 50% of subjects still 


have LDLC higher than current treatment goals.”  (CFAD Ex. 1014:40).  For HoFH 


patients (hundreds in the U.S.) “current drug therapies lower LDLC about 30-40%, 


but seldom below 300-400 mg/dl,” with “‘heroic’ treatments such as LDL apheresis 


every 1-2 weeks, or liver transplantation.”  (Id. at 42). 


Both the Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 also taught an efficacy range MTP 


inhibitors could safely target, and market as adjunct therapy based on ZETIA®’s 


success producing about 18% to 24% LDL-C reduction over statin therapy alone.  


(Zusman, ¶¶ 69, 103, 108; CFAD Ex. 1014:33-34; CFAD Ex. 1013:2).  The Pink 


Sheet also published Stein’s guidance that the toxicity seen in previous MTP 


inhibitor clinical trials resulted from the high doses used to seek LDL-C reduction
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


24 





comparable to statins.  Those trials did not seek reductions in the ~20% range, which 


could be accomplished using lower doses.  (Zusman, ¶ 69, 108; CFAD Ex. 1013:2).  


Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 both identified the proposed implitapide dosing 


regimen designed to produce an expected additional ~18% to 24% LDL-C reduction: 


a starting dose of 10 mg daily; escalating by 5 mg/day every five weeks (e.g., 15, 


20, 25, 30, 35 mg) to a maximum dose of 40 mg/day.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 105, 110; 


Mayersohn, ¶¶ 58, 61; CFAD Ex. 1013:2; CFAD Ex. 1014:37-38).  The ordinarily-


skilled artisan would have reasonably expected this proposed dosing regimen to 


resolve Chang’s expressed concerns about managing an appropriate “therapeutic 


index” for MTP inhibitors.  (See CFAD Ex. 1015:567; see also Zusman ¶¶ 137-40, 


142-43, 206, 208-11, 213-15). 


As described below, the Examiner had neither Pink Sheet 2004 nor Stein 2004 


during the substantive prosecution of the ‘118 Application; patentee submitted those 


only after the second Notice of Allowance.  Chang was before the Examiner, but 


never substantively relied on.  Thus, the PTO was unable to fully evaluate the scope 


and teachings of the prior art on step-wise escalating dosing. 


VII. U.S. PATENT NO. 8,618,135 AND ITS FILE HISTORY. 


A. The ‘135 Patent Repeats Information Already Known to 
Ordinarily-Skilled Artisans.   


The ‘135 patent suggests it was surprising and inventive to discover “methods 


of treating a subject suffering from a disorder associated with hyperlipidemia while
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


25 





reducing side-effects” by administering “at least three step-wise, increasing doses of 


the MTP inhibitor.”  (CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 7:11-24; col. 6:65-7:3).  As noted above, 


this was Stein’s published approach for implitapide. 


The ‘135 patent concedes “MTP inhibitors, methods of use and preparation 


thereof are known to the art skilled,” including BMS-201038 (lomitapide).  (Id. at 


col. 8:5-6; 8:20-24).  It states a study in “the best accepted” HoFH animal model 


showed BMS-201038 “effectively reduced plasma cholesterol levels in a dose 


dependent manner” (id. at col. 6:9-10), with an ED50 value of 1.9 mg/kg, and a dose 


of 10 mg/kg “essentially normaliz[ing] cholesterol levels with no alteration in 


plasma AST or ALT.”  (Id. at col. 6:8-15).  This in turn indicated “MTP inhibition 


by BMS-201038 might be effective in substantially reducing cholesterol levels in 


patients with hoFH.”  (Id. at col. 6:16-19).  Chang reported this information.  


(Zusman, ¶¶ 96-99; see CFAD Ex. 1015:565 (“BMS-201038 also showed efficacy 


in the WHHL rabbit, demonstrating an ED50 value for total plasma cholesterol and 


triglyceride lowering of 1.9 mg/kg and a complete normalization of atherogenic 


apoB-containing lipoprotein particles at a dose of 10 mg/kg”)).   


The ‘135 patent recognized that HoFH patients were treated with statins plus 


ezetimibe (ZETIA®) as combination therapy, as Dr. Stein taught in the Pink Sheet 


and Stein 2004.  The patent characterizes the resulting total reduction of LDL-C by 


27% as “far from optimal.”  (CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 3:56-64).  The ‘135 patent asserts
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


26 





there was a “tremendous unmet medical need for new medical therapies for hoFH.”  


(Id. at col. 4:20-21).  Yet the ‘135 patent nowhere shows that its purportedly 


inventive lomitapide dosing regimen could or would reduce LDL-C levels by more 


than 27% in HoFH patients.  Indeed, patentee originally sought claims to at least 30 


or 50% reductions (CFAD Ex. 1006:25-28); issued dependent claims 3 and 4 only 


claim 15% and 25% comparative reductions—aligned with Dr. Stein’s implitapide 


targets and ZETIA®’s performance.  (See CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 20:3-11; Zusman, 


¶¶ 69, 103, 108. Cf. CFAD Ex. 1014:33-34; CFAD Ex. 1013:2).  


B. The ‘135 Patent File History. 


Patentee filed the ‘118 Application (CFAD Ex. 1008) leading to the ‘135 


patent on March 11, 2011 as a continuation of the ‘923 Application which led to the 


‘268 patent (filed March 7, 2005).  The ‘118 application’s original claims 


encompassed using any MTP inhibitor to treat “a disorder associated with 


hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia” with at least three step-wise increasing 


dose levels.  (CFAD Ex. 1008:28).  On March 4, 2013, in response to various 


rejections, the patentee limited independent claim 1 to treating hyperlipidemia or 


hypercholesterolemia, using “[lomitapide] . . .  or the piperidine N-oxide thereof,” 


added certain dosing ranges formerly found in dependent claims, and specified 


“wherein each dose level is administered . . . for about 1 to 5 weeks.”  The patentee 


also added application claim 26 (now issued claim 9).  (See CFAD Ex. 1009:2, 4).
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


27 





To overcome the § 103 rejection, patentee relied in part upon a declaration from Dr. 


William Sasiela, who noted that dosing patients with MTP inhibitors at a constant 


level creates significant adverse effects, and previous developers of MTP inhibitors 


had discontinued development.  (See id. at 7; CFAD Ex. 1010).  Sasiela also opined 


on alleged unexpected results produced by the claimed method.  (CFAD Ex. 1010:3).  


At that time, no one disclosed that Dr. Stein had already done step-wise dose 


escalation with implitapide, or that Dr. Rader had served as a clinical researcher 


for Dr. Stein during the implitapide trials.  On May 10, 2013, the PTO issued the 


first Notice of Allowance.  (CFAD Ex. 1011).  


After patentee submitted a Request for Continuing Examination (RCE) and 


another Initial Disclosure Statement (IDS), the PTO issued a second Notice of 


Allowance on September 3, 2013.  (CFAD Ex. 1012).  But three weeks later, 


patentee filed another RCE along with amendments and another IDS.  The 


amendments added what is now issued claim 10 (CFAD Ex. 1039:4-5), while the 


IDS enclosed prior art including Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004, and the European 


Opposition briefs.  (CFAD Ex. 1040:3-5).  


So, Pink Sheet 2004 and Stein 2004 took their places among the five columns 


of prior art listed on the face of the ‘135 patent.  Neither these references nor Chang 


2002 were substantively discussed during prosecution; the Examiner issued a third 


Notice of Allowance without comment.  (See CFAD Ex. 1041).

28 





C. The European Opposition Proceedings.    


On August 21, 2013, Dr. Evan Stein—the author of Stein 2004 and subject of 


Pink Sheet 2004—opposed a foreign counterpart to the ‘268 patent, European Patent 


1 725 234 B9 (“the ‘234 patent”).  (See CFAD Ex. 1020).  The Opposition asserted 


the ‘234 patent claims are unpatentable for various reasons, including obviousness 


over prior art including Stein 2004.  (See id., passim).  In the opposition Dr. Stein 


stated that the patentee, Dr. Rader, had been “a consultant and clinical investigator 


in clinical research projects with implitapide.”  (Id. at 2). 


In addition to Stein 2004, the Opposition cites excerpts from the implitapide 


clinical trial reports posted on www.ClinicalTrials.gov [reference D8].  (Id. at 2-3).  


It notes that the trials began in September 2003 and assessed implitapide as a 


treatment for “homozygous as well as heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia and 


hypercholesterolemia.”  (Id. at 8).  The Opposition states that the implitapide studies 


“were designed, conducted and guided by Dr. Stein, who included Dr. Rader, 


inventor of the opposed patent, as a consultant and one of the clinical investigators 


for these studies.”  (Id. (emphasis added)).  The parties settled.  


VIII. THE LEVEL OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART. 


A person of ordinary skill in the art as relevant to this proceeding would have 


had a high level of education (graduate and/or post-graduate degrees) in a pertinent 


discipline such as medicine, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics,
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


29 





or drug development and delivery.  Such a person with a medical degree (M.D.) 


would also have 3-5 years of experience treating patients in the 


cardiovascular/cardiac field, which would itself provide knowledge of dose-titration; 


dose-selection as balanced against side effects in individual patients; and 


developments in the clinical field.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 28-29, 32; Mayersohn, ¶ 26).  A 


non-M.D. would have a similarly advanced education, and the experiences and skill 


sets appropriate to their specialty.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 30-32; Mayersohn, ¶ 26). 


IX. CLAIM CONSTRUCTION STATEMENT (37 C.F.R. § 42.104(B)(3)). 


Under 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b), the claim terms of the ‘135 patent are presumed 


to take on their ordinary and customary meaning based on the broadest reasonable 


interpretation (“BRI”) of the claim language in light of the specification.  Petitioner 


proposes the following as at least included in the BRI:  


     • “A subject suffering hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia” includes humans 


and non-human mammals, e.g. rabbits.  (CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 11:31-32; Zusman, 


¶¶ 91-92). 


     • “effective amount” includes drug amounts improving any hyperlipidemia or 


hypercholesterolemia disease marker, or inhibiting MTP activity (including by as 


little as 10%).  (See, e.g., CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 8:66-col.9:2; Zusman, ¶¶ 91-92). 


    • “about” means approximately.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 91-92). 


    • “piperidine N-oxide thereof” is undefined by structure or chemical name within
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


30 





the ‘135 patent’s specification.  A general chemistry understanding of “N-oxide” 


upon a piperidine ring found in lomitapide requires adding an oxygen atom (O) to 


the nitrogen atom (N): .  (See CFAD Ex. 1019, col. 11:26-35, col. 124:20-56).  


The claims encompass this and other devisable piperidine N-oxides. 


  •  “Severe” hypercholesterolemia means a subject’s cholesterol values cause 


increased cardiovascular disease risks, and did not satisfactorily respond to initial 


lipid-lowering treatment.  (See CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 4:63-67; Zusman, ¶¶ 91-92).  


  • “control levels” must at least include, when applied to a particular blood 


component, “a level of a particular blood component” obtained from the subject 


either: (a) “in the absence of treatment” or (b) “receiving a placebo”; or (c) 


“receiving a different treatment,” including a subject receiving treatment “not 


including at least three step-wise, increasing dosages of an MTP inhibitor.”  (See 


CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 10:55-65; Zusman, ¶¶ 91-92). 


X. EXPLANATION OF GROUNDS FOR UNPATENTABILITY. 


To support institution, this petition for inter partes review must demonstrate 


“a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least one 


of the claims challenged in the petition.”  35 U.S.C. § 314(a).  Petitioner should 


prevail here because each element of ‘135 patent claims 1-10 are taught by, or would 


have been obvious over, the Pink Sheet 2004 in view of Chang; and Stein 2004 in 


view of Chang.  See 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


31 





Petitioner has analyzed the proper priority date (Section V), and the claims 


are obvious under any possible date.  The level of ordinary skill in the art was high 


(see Section VIII).  Petitioner’s cited references are prior art.  (See Sections V-VI).  


The ordinarily-skilled artisan had motivation to combine teachings from Pink Sheet 


2004 with Chang (Ground I); and Stein 2004 with Chang (Ground II) and reasonably 


expect success.  No non-obvious differences exist between either combination and 


the claimed subject matter; the claims are invalid.  


A. Ground I: Obviousness Over Pink Sheet 2004 in View of Chang. 


To issue the claims, the Examiner accepted representations in the Sasiela 


Declaration that MTP inhibitor development was discontinued due to side effects, 


so it was unexpected that MTP inhibitors could work as claimed.  (See Section VII, 


above).  Patentee’s representations were inaccurate, as shown by the cited prior art. 


The core issue is whether it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill 


to administer MTP inhibitors via an escalating dosing regimen falling anywhere 


within the claimed ranges to treat hyperlipidemia and/or hypercholesterolemia.  See 


Tyco Healthcare Grp. LP v. Mut. Pharm. Co., 642 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2011) 


(claims to dosing “6 to 8 milligrams” and “7.5 milligrams” of temazepam obvious 


given prior art teaching doses of “5 to 15 mg”).  “Yes.”  


As discussed above, the person of ordinary skill in the art had advanced 


degrees and experience with medical research.  (See Section VIII, above).  Chang is
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


32 





prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).  (See Section VI, above).  Pink Sheet 


2004 is prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) no matter which priority date 


applies; and prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because the ‘135 patent 


cannot benefit from the ‘915 Provisional.  (See Sections V & VI, above).       


1. The Claimed Lomitapide Escalating-Dosing Approach was 
Already Taught for Implitapide. 


The following claim chart (bold emphasis added) compares the ‘135 patent 


claims to the combination of the Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang.  There are no non-


obvious differences from the skilled artisan’s perspective:

Claim 1. A method of

hyperlipidemia or 


hypercholesterolemia,  






































the method comprising  


Pink Sheet 2004 discloses PPD sought to

hypertriglyceridemia.”  CFAD Ex. 1013:2. 
 


Patients “targeted for implitapide therapy will likely 


be the 5%-7% of high cholesterol patients that are 


statin intolerant, and the 10%-15% who are at high 


risk for cardiovascular disease and have not reached 


their LDL goals, Stein indicated.”  Id. at 2.

(See Zusman, ¶¶ 116-86, 261 (confirming each element and that the skilled artisan’s 


general knowledge renders dose escalation timing obvious)).   


 As described in the chart above, the Pink Sheet 2004 teaches a method of 


treating a subject suffering from hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia, the 


method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an MTP 


inhibitor (implitapide), wherein said administration comprises at least three (actually 


up to seven) step-wise increasing dose levels of the MTP inhibitors.  (See CFAD Ex. 


1013:2; Zusman, ¶¶ 110, 123, 126-27, 129-30).  The first dose level taught therein 


is between about 2 to about 13 mg/day, a second dose level is between about 5 to
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


38 





about 30 mg/day, and a third dose level is between about 10 to about 50 mg/day (see 


id.), and each dose level is administered to the subject for about 1 to about 5 weeks 


(CFAD Ex. 1013:2; Zusman, ¶¶ 110, 131-32, 135).  Lipid-lowering drugs generally 


were titrated upwards at intervals that ranging from 2 to 4 weeks or more.  (Zusman, 


¶ 47).  Thus, the claimed intervals fall within the known dose titration ranges already 


known for evaluating safety/tolerability.  Galderma Laboratories, L.P. v. Tolmar, 


Inc., 737 F.3d 731, 737-38 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (obviousness of prior art range).  


The Pink Sheet 2004 does not specifically disclose the MTP inhibitor 


represented by: [lomitapide], or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or piperidine N-


oxide thereof.  Chang teaches a method of treating a subject suffering from 


hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia using MTP inhibitors specifically including 


lomitapide (CFAD Ex. 1015:564-66, Zusman, ¶¶ 124-25, 133-34).  


The sole difference between Chang and subject matter encompassed by the 


claims is that while Chang disclosed lomitapide and its clinical activity as an MTP 


inhibitor, Chang did not expressly teach using lomitapide in an escalated-dose 


regimen.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 123-28, 133-34).  But Pink Sheet 2004 teaches the 


escalating-dose regimen not found in Chang.  (Id. at ¶¶ 129-32, 135).  The Pink Sheet 


2004 dosing regimen escalates the dose by the 5 week mark, which meets the “about 


1 to about 5 weeks”, “about four weeks”, and “about 1 to about 12 weeks” limitations 


in claims 1, 9 and 10.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 178-79, 184-85).
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


39 





A skilled artisan considering the teachings of Pink Sheet 2004 would also 


understand that the disclosed dosing schedule (5-week steps) is a conservative 


approach in a clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and tolerability.  (See Zusman, 


¶¶ 135, 180; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 66, 71).  They would also understand that acceptable 


results at the 4-week mark indicate that intervals shorter than 5 weeks (i.e. 4 weeks 


or less) would be acceptable.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 135, 180; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 66, 71).  


Indeed, dose-titration at 2-4 week intervals was established clinical practice for 


many cholesterol-lowering medications (see Section VI).  Finally, varying the timing 


of the dose escalation according to the patient’s clinical response represents obvious, 


routine optimization for persons of ordinary skill in the art; it has been practiced for 


many years with lipid-lowering medications.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 168, 175, 180, 185; 


Mayersohn, ¶¶ 20, 66, 71, 74).  


 “With every limitation of the asserted claims thus disclosed in the cited 


references, the question . . . becomes whether a person of ordinary skill in the art 


would have been motivated to combine those teachings to derive the claimed subject 


matter with a reasonable expectation of success.”  Bayer Healthcare Pharms. Inc.  


v. Watson Pharms. Inc., 713 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2013).   


2. Motivation to Combine Pink Sheet 2004 with Chang. 


“[A]ny need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of 


invention . . . can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


40 





claimed.”  KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420 (2007).  The ordinarily-


skilled artisan was motivated to combine the Pink Sheet 2004 with Chang, and vice 


versa.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 136-44; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 19, 46-48, 63-65).   


Chang identified three MTP inhibitors furthest along in clinical evaluation—


CP-346086, implitapide, and lomitapide— and taught each worked in humans and 


were similarly effective.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 96-99, 136-68; CFAD Ex. 1015:566-67).  


Chang recognized the problem with MTP inhibitors’ side-effect profiles:  they could 


not compete commercially with statins as monotherapy.  (See CFAD Ex. 1015:566-


67; CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 8:27-30).  Chang’s statement of the problem was 


motivation to look to other references for solutions.  See Bayer, 713 F.3d at 1375-


76.  As in Bayer, “the references in this case go beyond illuminating a known 


problem, they also expressly propose the claimed solution.”  Id.   


Pink Sheet 2004 reports Dr. Stein’s solution to the problem Chang articulated:  


follow the clinical model established with ZETIA®, and use MTP inhibitors to target 


(a) niche conditions like HoFH and (b) levels of clinical improvement acceptable for 


adjunct therapy (in the ~18-24% range), by using a lower dose starting at 10 mg/day, 


evaluating the dose every 4 weeks, then escalating stepwise by 5 mg/day every 4-5 


weeks to a maximum 40 mg daily dose.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 108-10, 139-43; Mayersohn, 


¶¶ 45-46).  As in Bayer, “the prior art’s direct recommendations to use [escalated 


step-wise] dosing regimens . . . would have motivated one of ordinary skill in the art
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


41 





to implement” the dosing regimen “for use with known” MTP inhibitors, including 


lomitapide, “as recited in the asserted claims.”  Bayer, 713 F.3d at 1376; see also id. 


at 1371 (a known “strategy to reduce side effects has been to reduce the . . . dose 


provided in each pill”).   


Likewise, the person of ordinary skill in the art reading Pink Sheet 2004 would 


have been motivated to identify other MTP inhibitors that would work for the same 


purposes and patients.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 93-95, 144; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 45-48).  A review of 


the literature—or any one of a number of basic electronic searches—would have 


readily led that person to Chang.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 93-95, 144).  Chang confirmed three 


MTP inhibitors had advanced to human clinical trials, and of the two performing at 


least comparably to implitapide, one was lomitapide.  (Id. at ¶¶ 97-98; Mayersohn, 


¶¶ 49-56; CFAD Ex. 1015:566-67).  Thus, the skilled artisan would have been 


motivated to combine the Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang teachings, and to apply the 


implitapide dosing strategy to lomitapide.  


At the very least, given these facts, lomitapide would have been obvious to 


try in place of implitapide.  See KSR, 550 U.S. at 402-03 (when “there are a finite 


number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill in the art has 


good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp”, and 


resulting success “is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and 


common sense.”); Merck & Co., Inc. v. Teva Pharms., USA, Inc., 395 F.3d 1364,
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


42 





1375 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (to find patentee’s “weekly-dosing idea non-obvious because 


it went against prevailing wisdom, the court must still explain why [patentee] and 


not [the prior art] should get credit for the idea” when patentee’s “idea added nothing 


to what came before”).     


Ordinarily-skilled artisans are also motivated to engage in routine 


experimentation to optimize the subject matter they study.  See Senju Pharm. Co. v. 


Lupin Ltd., 780 F.3d 1337, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (choosing 0.01% w/v EDTA for 


ophthalmic formulation was “not unexpected or surprising,” but obvious “product 


of routine optimization”).  This principle applies to any minor modification to 


Stein’s dosing regimen, e.g., increasing the dose “about” every two weeks, or 


“about” every four weeks, or “about” every two to four weeks, or “about” one to 12 


weeks as claimed rather than evaluating at 4 weeks and increasing the dose by the 


5-week mark.  To a skilled artisan, increasing the dose at five week intervals is 


increasing the dose at “about four weeks”  (Zusman, ¶¶ 135, 178-79, 184-85), and 


dose-titration of cholesterol-lowering drugs at two to four week intervals was and 


remains routine clinical practice.  (Id. at ¶¶ 43-47, 64-67).   


The claimed dosing intervals also reflect routine variation when applying the 


combined teachings of Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang (Id. at ¶¶ 168, 175, 180, 185; 


Mayersohn, ¶ 20, 66, 71, 74), and were thus obvious to the ordinarily-skilled artisan 


by March 2004.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 168, 175, 180, 185).  The other limitations of the
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


43 





dependent claims are also obvious for all the reasons set forth above (see pp. 32-39), 


and in the case of claims 3-4 are inherent results of the method of claim 1.  (Zusman, 


¶¶ 150-86). 


Having established the motivation to combine Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang, 


we next ask whether the skilled artisan would reasonably expect to succeed using 


lomitapide rather than implitapide in the Stein dosing regimen.  “Yes.” 


3. Reasonable Expectation of Success With Lomitapide. 


Reasonable expectation of success “does not require a certainty of success.”  


Medichem, S.A. v. Rolabo, S.L., 437 F.3d 1157, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (emphasis 


original).  To create a reasonable expectation, the prior art must provide enough 


guidance, parameters or direction to the skilled artisan (in light of their background 


and knowledge), versus merely general ideas or vague suggestions.  See id.  Here, 


the detailed teachings of Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang provide the ordinarily-skilled 


artisan a reasonable expectation of success that applying the Pink Sheet 2004’s 


dosing regimen to lomitapide would help patients in the manner claimed.  


For a skilled artisan reading Pink Sheet 2004, it would have been obvious to: 


identify other MTP inhibitors that performed at least comparably to implitapide in 


the clinic; use them in the escalating dosing regimen; and reasonably expect them to 


again work comparably to implitapide.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 145-48, Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18-19, 


48).  Chang identifies two other MTP inhibitors that had progressed into human
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


44 





clinical trials: the Pfizer compound CP-346086 and lomitapide [BMS 201038].  


(Zusman, ¶¶ 96-99; CFAD Ex. 1015:566-67).  Even if the skilled artisan had to 


choose between those two, lomitapide would have been preferred because it had 


been successfully tested in WHHL rabbits, the animal model for human HoFH.  (See 


Zusman, ¶¶ 97, 146; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18, 51-53; CFAD Ex. 1015:565).  One of 


ordinary skill would expect—based on the public data on implitapide in animals and 


humans, and lomitapide in animals—to be able to substitute lomitapide into the 


implitapide escalating dose regimen and achieve a working treatment method with 


no more than routine adjustments.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 145-48; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18, 54, 65).  


See Bayer, 713 F.3d at 1376; Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 464 F.3d 1286, 1295 


(Fed. Cir. 2006) (prior art creating expectation of “a general, albeit imperfect, 


correlation between a drug’s lipophilicity and its colonic absorptivity” supported 


motivation and reasonable expectation of success); McNeil-PPC, Inc. v. L. Perrigo 


Co., 337 F.3d 1362, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (combination obvious where “several 


other well-known antidiarrheals with simethicone had been described in the prior 


art”).  


The ordinarily-skilled artisan also would have a reasonable expectation of 


success with lomitapide at least because, as described above: (a) Stein pursued the 


identical approach with implitapide; (b) as MTP inhibitors, implitapide and 


lomitapide possessed a similar mechanism and degree of action (see, e.g., CFAD Ex.
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


45 





1015:562-64); (c) the existing lomitapide data suggested that it should be dosed 


similarly to implitapide; and (d) escalating step-wise dosing, adjusted to account for 


side effects at the claimed intervals, was routine clinical practice.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 43-


47, 59-67, 97-98, 103-05; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18-19, 47-54).  


As for the dependent claims, both the Pink Sheet 2004 and Chang taught using 


MTP inhibitors for severe hypercholesterolemia (claim 2).  (Zusman, ¶¶ 152-54).  


Claims 3 and 4 recite reductions of 15% and 25% in known markers for MTP 


inhibition activity, which fall within the ranges the prior art taught to target.  (Id. at 


¶¶ 155-62; Section VI, above).  The claimed reductions also result inherently from 


the treatment.  See Santarus, Inc. v. Par Pharm., Inc., 694 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed. 


Cir. 2012) (limitation was “an inherent property of the formulation, and an obvious 


formulation cannot become nonobvious simply by administering it to a patient and 


claiming the resulting serum concentrations”).  Claim 5’s oral dosing was known 


and expected to work; Chang teaches lomitapide and implitapide were designed as 


oral drugs.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 163-65).  The Pink Sheet 2004 teaches the fourth and fifth 


dose steps and amounts recited in claims 6-8.  (Id. at ¶¶ 166-76).  Finally, the degree 


of efficacy and severity of side-effects of MTP inhibitors are dose-dependent.  (See 


CFAD Ex. 1015:564-567; Zusman, ¶¶ 64-67; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 17-18, 51, 53-56).  So, 


starting with a lower dose was expected to reduce side effects.  This was the general 


practice and result with many lipid-lowering drugs, e.g. fibrates, statins and niacin.
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


46 





(Zusman, ¶¶ 64-67, 174; see Section IX, above). 


Given the above, there are no non-obvious differences between the claims and 


the prior art.  Further, as discussed below, the alleged secondary considerations of 


nonobviousness are weak at best, and cannot undermine or refute this strong 


showing of obviousness.  Subject matter encompassed by claims 1-10 would have 


been obvious when filed, so those claims are invalid. 


B. Ground II: Obviousness Over Stein 2004 in View of Chang. 


The central issue for Ground II is similar to that stated above for Ground I.  


The level of ordinary skill in the art (Section VIII) and the scope and content of the 


prior art (Section VI) are identical, so there is no need to repeat them here.  The 


February 5, 2004 Stein presentation (Stein 2004) is “printed publication” prior art 


under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(a) and (b) as set forth above in Sections V-VI.  


1. There Are No Non-Obvious Differences. 


The critical teachings of Stein 2004 are similar to the critical teachings of Pink 


Sheet 2004.  Yet Stein 2004 provides additional non-cumulative information.  For 


example, Stein 2004 goes into detail about the background of the art; the challenges 


faced by MTP inhibitors; Stein’s proposed solutions; the proven efficacy of

at 23-32).  To the extent the Board has any doubts about the motivation of the skilled 


artisan or their expectation of success from Pink Sheet 2004, Stein 2004 necessarily 


puts those doubts to rest.   


The following claim chart shows an element-by-element comparison between 


the ‘135 patent claims and the combination of Stein 2004 and Chang (bold emphasis

salt thereof or the piperidine 


N-oxide thereof. 





(See Zusman, ¶¶ 187-260, 262 (confirming each element, and that the skilled 


artisan’s general knowledge renders dose escalation timing obvious)). 


 As described in the chart above, Stein 2004 teaches a method of treating a 


subject suffering from hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia, the method 


comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an MTP inhibitor 


(implitapide), wherein said administration comprises at least three (actually up to 


seven) step-wise increasing dose levels of the MTP inhibitors.  (See CFAD Ex. 


1014:27-32, 37-38; Zusman ¶¶ 103-05, 194, 197-98, 200).  The first dose level 


taught therein is from about 2 to about 13 mg/day, a second dose level is from about 


5 to about 30 mg/day, and a third dose level is from about 10 to about 50 mg/day 


(CFAD Ex. 1014:37-38; Zusman ¶¶ 201-02), and each dose level is administered to 


the subject for about 1 to about 5 weeks (CFAD Ex. 1014:37-38; Zusman ¶¶ 201-


02).  Lipid-lowering drugs generally were titrated upwards at intervals of 2 to 4 


weeks, or longer. (Zusman, ¶ 47).  Thus, the claimed intervals fall into the known 


dose titration ranges already used to evaluate safety/tolerability.  See Galderma, 737 


F.3d at 737-38 (obviousness of prior art range).  


Stein 2004 does not specifically disclose the MTP inhibitor represented by 


[lomitapide], or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or piperidine N-oxide thereof.
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


53 





Chang teaches a method of treating a subject suffering from hyperlipidemia or 


hypercholesterolemia using MTP inhibitors specifically including lomitapide.  


(CFAD Ex. 1015:564-66; Zusman, ¶¶ 195-96, 199, 203-04).  


The sole difference between Chang and the claimed subject matter is that 


Chang did not expressly teach using lomitapide in an escalated-dose regimen.  


(Zusman, ¶¶ 194-99, 203-04).  But Stein 2004 teaches the escalating-dose regimen 


not found in Chang.  (Id. at ¶¶ 200-02, 205).  The Stein 2004 dosing regimen 


increases the dose by the 5 week mark, which meets the “about 1 to about 5 weeks”, 


“about four weeks”, and “about 1 to about 12 weeks” limitations in claims 1, 9 and 


10.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 252-53, 259).  Petitioner incorporates by reference the remaining 


discussion in Section X.A.1.   


2. Motivation to Combine Stein 2004 with Chang. 


The motivation to combine Stein 2004 with Chang corresponds to the 


motivation to combine set forth in Ground One.  (See Zusman, ¶¶ 206-16; 


Mayersohn, ¶¶ 19, 46-48, 63-65, 68-70).  Therefore, Petitioner incorporates by 


reference the analysis in Section X.B.2 about Chang’s teachings, the Pink Sheet 


2004 teachings also found in Stein 2004, and the motivation to combine them.  But 


additional Stein 2004 teachings further motivate the skilled artisan. 


For example, Stein 2004 reports that the U.S. “lipid lowering market is now 


the largest therapeutic segment at ≅ $16 to $18 billion.”  (CFAD Ex. 1014:7).  Stein
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


54 





also reports that market growth, while slowing, remained “in the double digits”, and 


“[a]s a class statins are by far the largest component with each percentage of market 


share worth ≅ $160,000,000 per year.”  (Id.)  Stein 2004 also clarified the nature of 


the market opportunity for MTP inhibitors as adjunctive therapy: “New therapeutic 


agents will be additive or complementary not competitive with statins or even 


existing agents.”  (Id.)  The size of this potential market would surely have motivated 


the skilled artisan–as would Dr. Stein’s proposed solution to managing side-effects 


by using known dosing techniques.  


Stein 2004 also provides additional detail about the clinical need for MTP 


inhibitors not explicitly noted in Pink Sheet 2004.  Stein teaches there is “[s]till large 


potential unmet need for additional, for [sic] even moderately effective (15-20%), 


LDLC lowering agents,” (Id. at 45), and taught how to satisfy that need.  (Id. at 22-


43).  The presentation touts the clinical potential for MTP inhibitors as a class, and 


motivates the ordinarily-skilled artisan to investigate further: “MTP inhibition offers 


the widest potential for reducing production of the atherogenic lipoproteins 


including chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, and LDL.”  (Id. at 45).  


Stein 2004 also would encourage the skilled artisan to reasonably expect 


success by teaching that applying stepwise escalating dosing will achieve the desired 


clinical targets with lower doses.  Stein 2004 confirmed the “[i]nitial ‘hurdles’ and 


expectations are modest and based on existing scientific data.”  (Id. at 44)
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


55 





(emphasis added).  Significantly, given Chang’s expressed concerns about an 


appropriate therapeutic index and marketing hurdles for MTP inhibitors, the skilled 


artisan would understand from Stein 2004 that the MTP inhibitor need only produce 


a modest result to justify pursuit.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 105, 210-14).  


All of these teachings in Stein 2004, as well as the detailed implitapide trial 


data in the presentation (CFAD Ex. 1014:23-32), provide additional motivation to 


the ordinarily-skilled artisan to pursue other MTP inhibitors which could work 


according to the plan Stein proposed for implitapide.  As noted above, that search 


would quickly lead to Chang and to lomitapide.  (Zusman, ¶¶ 93-95, 144).   


3. Reasonable Expectation of Success With Lomitapide. 


The analysis of the skilled artisan’s reasonable expectation of success when 


substituting lomitapide for implitapide in the stepwise escalating dosing regimen 


taught by Stein 2004 in view of Chang correlates to the Pink Sheet 2004/Chang 


combination analysis.  (See id. at ¶¶ 217-21; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 18-19, 48, 54, 65).  


Petitioner incorporates by reference here the “reasonable expectation of success” 


analysis in Section X.A.3 above.  But further Stein 2004 teachings confirm the 


reasonable expectation of success, including the implitapide trial data (CFAD Ex. 


1014:23-32) and Dr. Stein’s teachings that the success required need only be modest 


to justify pursuing MTP inhibitors.  (Id. at 44; Zusman, ¶¶ 105, 210-14).   


Given the above, there are no non-obvious differences between the claims and
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


56 





the prior art.  Further, as discussed below, the alleged secondary considerations of 


nonobviousness asserted during the ‘135 prosecution cannot undermine or refute the 


strong showing of obviousness.  From the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the 


art, claims 1-10 were obvious when filed.  They are invalid. 


C. Secondary Considerations Presented During Prosecution Do Not 
Rebut the Prima Facie Case of Unpatentability. 


An obviousness analysis must consider “secondary considerations” evidence 


when presented.  See Graham v. John Deere, 383 U.S. at 17-18.  Petitioner submits 


no substantial evidence of secondary considerations exists, but nevertheless 


addresses Patentee’s arguments raised during prosecution. 


With Petitioner having presented a strong prima facie case of obviousness 


(Sections IV-X.B. above), Patentee has the burden to produce secondary 


considerations evidence with nexus to the claims to refute that case.  See In re Dillon, 


919 F.2d 688, 692-93 (Fed Cir. 1990) (en banc).  Patentee cannot do so here.  See 


Wyers v. Master Lock Co., 616 F.3d 1231, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (secondary 


considerations “simply cannot overcome a strong prima facie case of obviousness”); 


accord Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Allergan 


v. Sandoz, 726 F.3d 1286, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2013).   


First, “where the inventions represented no more than ‘the predictable use of 


prior art elements according to their established functions,’ the secondary 


considerations are inadequate to establish nonobviousness as a matter of law.”
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


57 





Wyers, 616 F.3d at 1246 (quoting KSR, 550 U.S. at 417).  The prior art here taught 


each element of the ‘135 patent claims, and their predictable and expected results.  


See Senju, 780 F.3d at 1353 (routine experimental work was obvious).  


Second, the patentee argued during prosecution that the alleged “failure of 


others” to solve the side-effects problem, “unexpected results” from the claimed 


stepwise dosing regimen, and alleged “industry skepticism” were objective evidence 


of the nonobviousness of the ‘135 patent claims.  (See CFAD Ex. 1009:7-9; see also 


CFAD Ex. 1010:1-2).  None withstand scrutiny. 


No failure of others.  Dr. Stein’s solution for MTP inhibitor dosing—


escalating step-wise dosing—was already published.  This alone is fatal to patentee’s 


argument, because it precludes any nexus to the ‘135 patent claims.  Ormco Corp. 


v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1311-12 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Muniauction, 


Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318, 1327-28 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (nexus required to 


give substantial weight to secondary considerations evidence).   


Patentee’s related argument that “scientists and investigators of the failed 


[circa-1990s BMS lomitapide] trial, did not appear to arrive at any solution to these 


adverse events” is also wrong.  (CFAD Ex. 1009:8; CFAD Ex. 1010:1).  Those 


“others” were dosing lomitapide in the hope of competing commercially with statin 


drugs as monotherapy.  (See Zusman, ¶ 266; CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 8:27-30 (BMS 


decided side effects “made it unlikely that BMS-201038 could be developed as a
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


58 





drug for large scale use in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia”); see also CFAD 


Ex. 1013:2 (“‘None of them were looking at LDL reductions or cholesterol 


reductions’ as low as the 20% range, [Stein] said. ‘They didn’t consider that viable 


in terms of marketing.’”).  BMS’s decision to discontinue lomitapide development 


for economic reasons does not demonstrate scientific or technological obstacles to 


(or the nonobviousness of) the claimed invention.  See Orthopedic Equip. Co. v. 


United States, 702 F.2d 1005, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  Indeed, patentee’s proposed 


solutions—dose-escalation of lomitapide in combination therapy, treatment of 


HoFH and other niche diseases, therapeutic improvements in the 15-25% range, 


etc.—merely copy Stein’s prior art solutions.  (See CFAD Ex. 1001, col. 7:49-60; 


col. 10:35-42; col.11:33 – 13:62; Cf. CFAD Ex. 1013:2; CFAD Ex. 1014:7, 33-38; 


Zusman, ¶¶ 76-78, 267; Mayersohn, ¶¶ 72-73).  


No unexpected results.  The Sasiela Declaration asserts reduced side effects 


from the claimed escalating dosing regimen was a “surprising” and “unexpected 


result.”  (See CFAD Ex. 1010:2-3).  To the contrary, this was the natural result 


flowing from applying Stein’s escalating-dose method to lomitapide.  (Zusman, 


¶¶ 74-76, 265).  Before March 2004, ordinarily-skilled artisans would reasonably 


expect reduced side-effects to result from using lower initial doses of anti-


cholesterol drugs, including MTP inhibitors, in an escalating dosing regimen.  (See 


id. at ¶¶ 74-76, 265; CFAD Ex. 1014:31, 36-38; CFAD Ex. 1013:2; CFAD Ex.
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


59 





1021).  This is especially so given the known dose dependency of the cholesterol-


lowering effects of MTP inhibitors, and their gastrointestinal and hepatic side-


effects.  (See Zusman, ¶ 265; CFAD Ex. 1015:564-67).   


No skepticism.  Patentee argued skilled artisans were allegedly “skeptical” 


about the benefits of step-wise dosing for MTP inhibitors as shown by alleged 


teaching away in the references cited by the Examiner.  (See CFAD Ex. 1009:7-9).  


Any purported skepticism was resolved by the publication of the Pink Sheet 2004 or 


Stein 2004 references.  See Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 748 F.3d 1326, 


1330-31 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Indeed, Dr. Stein’s active pursuit and promotion of a step-


wise, escalating dosing regimen for MTP inhibitors in phase II clinical trials of 


implitapide confirms a lack of skepticism in the art.  (Zusman, ¶ 268; CFAD Ex. 


1014: 31, 36-38; CFAD Ex. 1013:2).  To obtain informed consent and ethically 


conduct Phase II clinical trials, researchers must reasonably expect some positive 


clinical benefit.  See 21 C.F.R. § 50.25 (2001); 45 C.F.R. § 46.116 (2001).  


Finally, Patentee did not argue “commercial success” before the Examiner; no 


lomitapide products were then sold.  Any such argument now would fail for at least 


these reasons: (a) there can be no nexus between the ‘135 patent claims and any 


alleged commercial success of success of Juxtapid®–lomitapide, its uses, and 


escalating step-wise dosing were all known in the prior art; (b) BMS blocking 


patents on lomitapide (as a compound) have protected Juxtapid® from competing
Petition for Inter Partes Review of USPN 8,618,135 
 


60 





lomitapide products; and (c) Juxtapid® has enjoyed regulatory market exclusivity 


since its 2012 approval.  See Merck & Co., 395 F.3d at 1377 (finding commercial 


success “not significantly probative” where others were “legally barred” from 


“commercially testing the [prior art] ideas.”).  But regardless of the commercial 


opportunity, the core of the obviousness analysis remains in the science.  Marketing 


challenges or the absence of an attractive commercial opportunity are not evidence 


of non-obviousness.  Businessmen not pursuing a path “for economic reasons is not 


the same as saying that it could not be done because skilled persons in the art felt 


that there was some technological incompatibility that prevented” the invention.  


Orthopedic Equip. Co., 702 F.2d at 1013.  


XI. CONCLUSION. 


The prior art and evidence presented show a substantial likelihood that each 


of the challenged claims of the ‘135 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103.  


Petitioner therefore requests that the Board grant this Petition for inter partes review 


and find the claims of the ‘135 patent are invalid. 


      Respectfully submitted,
