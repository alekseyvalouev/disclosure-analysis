RINO  claims  to  be  the  leader  in  selling  desulfurization  (“FGD”)  


and  other  environmental  equipment  to  Chinese  steel  mills.  It  


reported  2009  revenue  of  $193  million.  In  reality  its  revenue  is  


under  $15  million,  and  its  management  has  diverted  tens  of  


millions  of  dollars  for  its  own  use.  We  value  RINO  based  on  


the  cash  we  believe  remains  in  the  company  after  the  most  


recent  raise.


RINO’s  FGD  sales  (60%  to  75%  of  revenue)  are  much  


lower  than  it  claims.  We  found  that  many  of  its  customer  


relationships  do  not  exist.


Chinese  regulatory  filings  show  that  RINO’s  consolidated  


2009  revenue  was  only  $11  million,  or  94.2%  lower  than  it  


reported  in  the  US.  We  show  that  the  Chinese  numbers  are  


credible.


RINO’s  accounting  has  serious  flaws  that  are  clear  signs  of  


cooked  books.


RINO’s  management  is  draining  cash  from  the  company  for  


its  own  business  and  personal  uses.    The  management  is  in  


flagrant  breach  of  its  VIE  agreements,  which  require  it  to  


pay  income  to  RINO  (as  opposed  to  taking  it).


RINO’s  balance  sheet  has  an  astonishingly  small  amount  of  


tangible  assets  for  a  manufacturer.  Rather,  it  is  filled  with  


low  quality  “paper”  assets  that  balance  out  the  inflated  


earnings,  and  likely  hide  leakage.


RINO  is  not  the  industry  leader  it  claims  to  be  in  the  steel  


sinter  FGD  system  market.    Rather,  it  is  an  obscure  


company  in  a  crowded  field,  and  is  best  known  for  its  failed  


projects.    Its  reported  margins  are  two  to  three  times  what  


they  really  are.  Its  technology  is  sub-­par.

Valuation 


 
RINO is worth approximately $70 million ($2.45 per share), and falling.  In order to fund 
its own business (“VIE”), management has drained RINO of cash.  At the same time, 
management has failed to make required transfers of VIE’s profit to RINO.  RINO is 
therefore a shell company with at most $70 million in cash (raised, not generated) and 
recently acquired assets. 
 
We believe that RINO’s actual consolidated revenue (including VIE) is less than $15 
million annually – versus the $192.6 that RINO reports.  RINO’s actual profitability is 
marginal at best.  Therefore, even if management were transferring value from VIE to 
RINO (rather than the other way around), it would be a negligible addition to the cash 
position for valuation purposes. 
 
By most indications, RINO is attempting to make itself into a “real” company with its 
Changxing Island project.  However, we do not ascribe a value to the project because we 
doubt that it be successful.  (We of course have concerns that management will end up 
owning these assets as well.)  RINO’s management has not built or run a business of any 
scale.  Making a sizable investment in them seems more like a financial sinkhole than an 
opportunity for value creation.  Hence, the value of RINO decreases at it burns cash to 
further the project. 
 


Summary and Recommendation: 





We rate RINO International Corp. (“RINO”) a Strong Sell.  Its financial statements show 
substantially inflated revenues, profits, and assets.  Not only has RINO’s management 
failed to make required income transfers to the Company, but they have directed tens of 
millions of dollars from RINO into their wholly owned company. 
 
We discovered that RINO has fabricated a significant number of its purported flue gas 
desulfurization (“FGD”) system customer relationships.  Public domain information 
corroborates our findings.  FGD system sales are RINO’s largest revenue component, 
historically accounting for approximately 60% to 75% of reported revenues. 
 
RINO’s 2009 SAIC


1
 income statements show consolidated revenue of $11.1 million and 


a net loss, versus RINO’s reported $192.6 million revenue with net income of $56.4 
million.  While it is plausible RINO understates its SAIC revenue by a small amount, we 
are confident that it generates no more than $15 million in annual revenue.

D!


RINO’s value added tax (“VAT”) payment disclosures in its SEC filings greatly 
contradict its reported revenues, and are a clear sign of cooked books.  The discrepancies 
also suggest money leakage from the Company. 
 
RINO’s claim that it had no PRC income tax expense in 2008 and 2009 cannot be true, 
which also shows significant misstatements in its financials and lack of diligence by its 
auditor.  RINO’s explanations of its tax treatment are inconsistent with one another.  
However, they are consistent in misstating the PRC tax code.  (RINO’s auditor, Frazer 
Frost, has been involved in other high profile problem Chinese micro cap companies.) 
 
Because management is abusing the VIE structure.  We believe that RINO’s shareholders 
own only a shell company that still has some of the cash they contributed.  RINO’s CEO 
and chairwoman (the married couple who founded the business) are blatantly violating 
the VIE agreements by failing to make any required transfers of income to RINO.  
Instead, they have pulled out at least $35 million from the Company. 
 
RINO’s balance sheet has an astonishingly small amount of tangible assets for a 
manufacturer. Rather, it is filled with low quality “paper” assets that we doubt exist. 
 
RINO is not the industry leader it claims to be in the steel sinter FGD system industry.  
Rather, it is an obscure company in a crowded market, and seems best known for one to 
two failed projects.  Yet it claims gross margins of 35% to 40% on FGD projects, which 
are far in excess of those of the leading companies in the industry (generally less than 
20%).  Its circulating fluidized bed (“CFB”) FGD technology is sub-standard in the China 
FGD industry. 
 
While immaterial compared to their other sins, RINO management’s “borrowing” $3.5 
million to purchase a luxury home in Orange County gives insight to their character, as 
well as a window into the dynamics between management, RINO’s independent 
directors, and the Company’s auditor. 
 


Company Description 





RINO designs, sells, manufactures, installs, and services environmental protection 
equipment for China’s iron and steel producers.  Its products include flue gas 
desulfurization (“FGD”) systems, wastewater treatment systems, and anti-oxidation 
systems for hot rolled steel production. 
 
Because FGD systems historically have accounted for 60% to 75% of RINO’s revenue, 
we focus specifically on this line of business. 
 


RINO has Fabricated FGD Customer Relationships and Significantly Overstated 


Revenue. 


 
RINO has fabricated FGD customer relationships, and therefore significantly overstated 
revenue.  We spoke with knowledgeable people at nine of RINO’s purported customers.
!


K!


Five of the nine deny having purchased FGD systems from RINO.  It is likely that RINO 
fabricated a sixth customer relationship (Bao Steel) from this group as well.  Only three 
customers from the group confirm having purchased FGD systems from RINO.  
(However, as discussed in RINO’s Gross Margins are Improbable Relative to the Rest of 
the Industry – Particularly Because RINO is a Minor Player, has a damaged reputation, 


and Uses an Inferior Technology.  RINO’s Characterizations of its Position Within the 


Industry are Misleading, there are issues with one to two of these systems).  Because 
FGD historically represents approximately 60% - 75% of RINO’s reported revenue, these 
fabrications show that RINO is significantly overstating its revenue.   
 
The purported FGD customers we found that have not actually purchased RINO FGD 
systems are the Yueyufeng Steel Group (“Yueyufeng”), Yuhua Steel Co. Ltd (“Yuhua”), 
the Lai Steel Group (“Lai”), Chongqing Iron & Steel (“Chongqing”), Nanchang Changli 
Iron & Steel (“Changli), and most likely Bao Steel (“Bao”). 
 
Yueyufeng relationship is fabricated 


 
We confirmed that Yueyufeng is not an FGD customer, which means that 2009 revenue 
is at least $12.7 million lower than reported.  A RINO March 2010 investor presentation 
(“Investor Presentation”) claims that Yueyufeng is a significant FGD customer.


 2
  


However, when we spoke with Yueyufeng, our contact stated that it has only one FGD 
system, and that RINO was not the vendor.  The corporate website of Zhuhai Guangjing 
Environmental Co. Ltd. claims that it designed the FGD system.


3
  According to a local 


newspaper report, the Yueyufeng system uses a technology (wet, double alkali) that is 
different from those RINO provides.


 4
  The China Construction Project Bidding website 


shows that the contract had an initial value of RMB 26.5 million ($3.9 million), which 
means that the actual vendors that worked on the project received substantially less than 
RINO claims to have ($12.7 million).


5
   


 
Yuhua relationship is fabricated 


 
We confirmed that Yuhua is not an FGD customer.  RINO disclosed in its 2008 10-K 
(filed March 31, 2009) that it had installed an FGD system at Yuhua.


6
  However, our 


contact reported that Yuhua only has one FGD system, and that RINO was not the 
vendor.  Publicly available information on the project also contradicts RINO’s claim that 
Yuhua is an FGD customer.  According to the local government of Wuan’s record of 
environmental related projects, the expected completion date of the Yuhua FGD system 
is December 2009.

completed until this year.)  Therefore, at the time RINO falsely claimed to have installed 
the FGD system, it was close to one year away from completion (by another vendor). 
 
Lai relationship is fabricated 
 
We confirmed that Lai is not an FGD customer.  The Investor Presentation claims that 
Lai is an FGD customer.


8
  However, Lai has two FGD systems, and no work was 


contracted or sub-contracted to RINO.  Our contact at Lai is familiar with RINO because 
he heard that the FGD system RINO built for Jinan Iron & Steel was taken off line.  He 
stated, “[RINO’s] technology has no advantage beside not producing wastewater.” 
 
Chongqing relationship is fabricated 
 
We confirmed that Chongqing is not an FGD customer.  RINO’s 2009 Form 10-K states 
that RINO has installed an FGD system at Chongqing.


9
  However, our contact stated that 


Chongqing is currently building its first FGD system.  The vendors are Shanghai Liyi 
Environmental Protection Co., two Chongqing subsidiaries, and China Coal International 
Group.  Specifically, RINO is not a vendor. 
 
Changli relationship is fabricated 


 
We confirmed that Changli is not currently an FGD customer.  However, RINO’s 2009 
Form 10-K states that RINO had installed an FGD system at Changli.


10
  Changli is 


presently soliciting bids for its first FGD system, and RINO is among the companies that 
have presented proposals.   
 
Bao relationship is likely fabricated 


 
We think it is probable that RINO did not work on any FGD projects for Bao or its 
subsidiaries, despite its claim in the Investor Presentation to have done so.  We spoke 
with a senior Bao executive who was responsible for installing FGD systems on three of 
Bao’s sinters (including at a subsidiary).  The executive had never heard of RINO.  
Moreover, the technical opinion from a Bao engineer that the International Financial 
Research & Analysis Group


11
 provided (in RINO’s Gross Margins are Improbable 


Relative to the Rest of the Industry – Particularly Because RINO is a Minor Player, has a 


damaged reputation, and Uses an Inferior Technology.  RINO’s Characterizations of its 


Position Within the Industry are Misleading,) states that Bao never engaged RINO, nor 
would Bao consider using RINO’s CFB technology.

Confirmed FGD Customers 
 
Panzhihua Iron & Steel (“Pan Steel”) confirmed that RINO had built an FGD system for 
its smallest (180 m2) sinter, but that the system did not perform to expectations.  Our 
contact stated, “We are not satisfied with the technology because the desulfurization rate 
is lower than what we want." It is unlikely to engage RINO in the future.  It should be 
noted that Pan has formed a joint venture to produce FGD systems for other steel mills, 
and thus is a competitor. 
 
Jinan Iron & Steel Group (“Jinan”) confirmed that RINO built an FGD system in 2005.  
Our contact would not comment on the report that Jinan took the system off line because 
it was not performing well (see Lai relationship is fabricated).   
 
Hunan Lianyuan Iron & Steel Co. confirmed that RINO built a CFB system in 2009 for a 
360 m2 sinter.  RINO is building an ammonia FGD system (280 m2 sinter) for it now. 
 
We attempted, but were unable, to speak with knowledgeable people at the other 15 FGD 
customers RINO has disclosed in its 2008 and 2009 10-Ks and March 10, 2010 investor 
presentation.

RINO’s SAIC Financial Statements Show 2009 Revenue of $11 million. 





We believe that RINO’s SAIC financial statements are largely reliable.  The SAIC 
income statement (below) shows consolidated 2009 revenue of $11.1 million, versus 
$192.6 million in its SEC filings.

RINO’s Disclosures of the Value Added Tax (“VAT”) it Pays Greatly Contradict its Reported Revenues. 





The inconsistency between VAT and reported revenues highlights the accounting strains resulting from significantly cooking the 


books.  It may also disguise cash leakage from the Company.  RINO discloses in the notes to its financial statements the VAT it 


supposedly paid.  The VAT it pays implies that RINO revenues are significantly greater than what it actually reports.  However, the 


body of evidence does not suggest that RINO’s reporting is conservative.  Rather, RINO is overstating revenue.  In the PRC, almost 


all sales of goods are subject to VAT.  As RINO explains, it pays VAT of 17% on its sales.
15


  By dividing the VAT amounts from the 


notes by 17%, we arrived at the implied sales numbers.  The implied sales are significantly greater than reported sales quarter after 


quarter.

No Income Tax in 2008 and 2009?  Something’s Cooking 





As we detail on the next page, RINO’s SEC filings showing that it had no income tax 


expense in 2008 and 2009 cannot be correct.  (RINO should have paid income taxes of at 


least 15% in 2008 and 2009.)  We cannot comment on the exact implications of RINO’s 


misstatement.  In a general sense though, RINO is committing a complicated accounting 


fraud with a lot of moving parts.  When the difference between reality and reported 


numbers is great, it is easy to make mistakes.  Claiming zero income taxes in 2008 and 


2009 is one such mistake.  RINO has had four CFOs in three years, which increases the 


challenge of committing the fraud. 





There are two principal entities involved in the tax analysis: Dalian Rino Environmental 


Engineering Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (“VIE”), and Dalian Innomind 


Environment Engineering Co., Ltd. (“Innomind”).  VIE is RINO’s operating entity, but is 


owned by the Company’s CEO, Mr. Dejun Zou, and chairwoman, Ms. Jianping Qiu.  


(Mr. Zou and Ms. Qiu are married.)  Innomind is owned by RINO (i.e., the public 


company), and its purpose is purportedly to provide management services to VIE in 


return for 100% of VIE’s pre-tax income.  (See RINO’s Founders Have Failed to 


Transfer Income to the Company, and to Let the Company Operate out of the Facilities it 


Supposedly Leases.  What do RINO Shareholders Actually Own? for an in-depth 


discussion of the relationship between VIE and Innomind.)  Recall that according to the 


2009 SAIC income statements, VIE is the only RINO entity booking any revenue. 





The key takeaways from the following table analyzing RINO’s claimed tax treatment are 


1) Innomind has no applicable exemptions to its income in 2008 and 2009, 2) Even if 


VIE transferred income to Innomind via a management fee, VIE cannot deduct this 


expense from income; and, thus RINO (through VIE) would have paid income taxes.  


(Any income transfer other than a management fee would have to be conducted 


according to PRC “arms length” transfer pricing principles, which would also not allow 


VIE to reduce its taxable income to zero.)
!


"!
!


"#!


One interesting item is that when RINO claims in its more recent filings it is transferring 
VIE’s income to Innomind via a management fee, it states that it transfers 100% of VIE’s 
net income.  However, the agreement under which VIE is supposed to make these 
payments calls for payments of 100% of VIE’s pretax income.


16
  We suppose this is an 


easy mistake to make if one is not actually making any transfers, while simultaneously 
inventing tax treatments to further accounting fraud. 
 


RINO’s Founders Have Failed to Transfer Income to the Company, and to Let the 


Company Operate out of the Facilities it Supposedly Leases.  What do RINO 


Shareholders Actually Own?  (About $2.45 per Share and Falling) 


 
Excluding the funds raised in December 2009 and possibly assets acquired for the 
Changxing Island project, RINO’s shareholders own little to no productive assets and 
have received no benefit from the profits VIE purportedly generates.  RINO’s founders 
have failed to transfer $120 million in pretax income to the Company.  At the same time, 
the Company is supposed to be leasing production facilities from the founders’ company 
so that the Company can generate its own revenue.  The founders’ company however 
continues to generate substantially all business.  Accounting fraud issues aside, it appears 
that RINO shareholders own far less of value than they had assumed. 
 
RINO’s operating company did not go public directly.  Instead, RINO has an indirect 
form of ownership in the operating company.  RINO owns a PRC company (“Innomind”) 
that has a series of contracts with the operating company.  The operating company is a 
Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).

This is diagram of the ownership relationship between RINO, Innomind, and VIE.  Note 


that VIE’s owners are RINO’s CEO (Mr. Dejun Zou) and chairwoman (Ms. Jianping 


Qiu).  Mr. Zou and Ms. Qiu are married.  RINO’s shareholders own 100% of Innomind 


by way of a holding company. 




































































When RINO went public via reverse merger in October 2007, VIE had been carrying out 


all operations.  Innomind only came into existence in July 2007 in preparation for the 


reverse merger transaction.  On October 3, 2007, Innomind entered into a series of 


contracts that were designed to transfer all of the benefits of owning VIE to Innomind 


without actually transferring ownership.  Under the agreements, VIE and its owners (Mr. 


Zou and Ms. Qiu) agreed to: 





• Sell to Innomind substantially all of VIE's manufacturing equipment and tangible 


assets for RMB 2,250,343;  


• Lease to Innomind substantially all of RINO’s manufacturing plant and land at an 


annual rent of RMB 612,000; and 


• Pay to Innomind on a monthly basis whatever pretax profit VIE generates. 





Despite selling and leasing all of these assets to Innomind, Mr. Zou and Ms. Qiu’s 


company, VIE, is still carrying out all of RINO’s operations.  And it has not made any 


management fee payments to Innomind.  Thus, excluding the funds raised in December 


2009 and possibly assets acquired for the Chang Xing Island project with such funds, 


RINO’s shareholders own little to no productive assets and have received no benefit from 


the profits VIE purportedly generates.
!


"#!


The table below shows the VIE account balances.
17


  In order to determine the amounts in 
the rest of the company (“ROC”), we subtracted the VIE balances from those in the 
consolidated balance sheet.  We have highlighted the key operating accounts in yellow.  
Note also the VIE account in red font, the Payable to Rino International to be eliminated 
of $156.5 million.   





 
The current asset balance for ROC should largely consist of cash RINO raised on 
December 7, 2009.  (It raised a gross amount of $100 million.)  The preponderance of 
operating liabilities in VIE shows that VIE continues to carry on almost all of RINO’s 
operations.  
 
The most problematic account is the $156.5 million Payable to Rino International to be 
eliminated.  RINO’s reported cumulative pretax income from September 30, 2007 
onward is $120.0 million.  This payable shows that VIE never made the required 
payments under the Entrusted Management Agreement. Refer to RINO’s SAIC Financial 
Statements Show 2009 Revenue of $11 million in which we show the 2009 SAIC income 
statement for Innomind, which shows no 2009 revenue.  Had Innomind received the 2009 
management fees, it would have booked them as revenue.

"#!


There are two reasons why VIE has never made these payments.  The first is that the 
money simply is not there.  As this report shows, RINO has significantly inflated its 
revenue and profits.  The second reason is that to the extent VIE is profitable, Mr. Zou 
and Ms. Qiu want to keep the profits in the company of which they own 100%, rather 
than sharing with the shareholders.  
 
Even Worse, Innomind Appears to Have Provided VIE $35 - $40 million of 


Shareholders’ Money.  Because We are Skeptical of Much of the “Paper” in RINO’s 


Balance Sheet, These Funds Could Have Been Misappropriated. 


 
Because RINO does not own VIE, it has agreements with VIE designed to transfer 
money and value to RINO.  Beyond not honoring those agreements, the management is 
causing money to flow the wrong way – into VIE.  Innomind is lending money to VIE, 
which is highly improper and alarming because it would mean that VIE is actually taking 
money directly from RINO’s shareholders.  Approximately $40 million in raised funds 
have been paid into Innomind,


18
 yet according to SAIC financials, Innomind is nearly 


devoid of cash or any tangible assets.  Clearly, were VIE sitting on $120.0 million it owes 
Innomind, it would not need to pull $35 - $40 million more out of Innomind. 
 
The $36.5 million difference between the payable and the cumulative pretax income 
(discussed in the prior section) is likely due to VIE borrowing money from Innomind.  
 
The SAIC balance sheets we obtained through a reputable credit bureau show VIE’s 
Other Accounts Payable approximate Innomind’s Accounts Receivable plus Other 
Accounts Receivable.


19
  As of December 31, 2009, the approximate amount of these 


totals is $40 million.  Given the $36.5 million difference between US GAAP cumulative 
pretax income and VIE’s payable to Rino International, it is clear that roughly $35 
million to $40 million has improperly flowed from Innomind to VIE. 
 
The money that went into Innomind came directly from RINO’s equity raises.  Innomind 
was originally incorporated with $20 million in paid-in-capital,


20
 which RINO paid in 


following its $21.3 million (net) raise in October 2007.  Almost all of the money paid in 
had become receivables by December 31, 2008. In late 2009, Innomind applied to 
increase its capital to $80 million; and, has contributed a total of $40 million to date.  
(The additional $20 million would have had to come from the December 2009 equity 
raise.  By law, VIE would not have been able to contribute equity capital to Innomind.)  
Note below that Innomind ended the year with $40.7 million in receivables.  The 
December 2009 raise funded the increase in Innomind’s receivables.

The Amount of “Paper” Assets on RINO’s Balance Sheet is Implausible for its 


Business. 





For RINO, the problem with balance sheets is that they need to balance.  As RINO 


manufactures profits that inflate the equity side of its balance sheet, it needs to show 


corresponding increases in assets.  In China, determined companies are able to find ways 


of making fraudulent invoices, sales contracts, receipts, etc. relatively easily.  Buying 


forged paper is obviously less costly than investing in tangible assets.   





Auditors vary in their diligence in confirming the authenticity of the aforementioned 


documents.  There is an ongoing shareholder lawsuit against RINO’s current auditor, 


Frazer Frost LLP (formerly known as Moore, Stephens Wurth Frazer and Torbet, LLP), 


regarding accounting fraud with another Chinese company.
21


  Frazer Frost also failed to 


detect a material amount of unauthorized loans taken by the management of China 


Natural Gas, Inc (CHNG), despite the auditor having previously stated in CHNG’s Form 


10-K that CHNG had successfully implemented effective internal controls.
22








RINO manufactures custom products in production times measured in months, with the 


main input being steel.  It is a slow moving, asset and labor-intensive production process.  


Yet, quarter in and quarter out, RINO’s tangible operating assets are a small percentage 


of its overall operating assets.  The table below shows our calculations of RINO’s 


tangible operating assets over its total operating asset base.

 Note that we excluded cash because RINO recently completed a fund raise.  We also excluded intangible 


assets, which would include RINO’s land use rights, for comparison purposes.

We compared these numbers to two public companies that manufacture FGD systems, 


Fujian Long King Co. Ltd. (600388:CH) (“Long King”) and Zhejiang Fei Da 


Environmental Science and Technology Co. Ltd (600526:CH) (“Fei Da”).  FGD only 


accounted for 34.4% of Long King and 9.5% of Fei Da’s 2009 revenues, respectively.  


However, both companies are in the environmental protection equipment industry, and 


the majority of their products involve longer manufacturing times and a good deal of steel 


input.  Moreover, they each have a large number of customers that are state-owned 


enterprises, which would create similar payment delay issues. 
































RINO’s raw material balances have not grown in line with sales.  Raw materials are one 


of the best – if not the best – ways of gauging a manufacturer’s output.  Below is a table 


showing fiscal 2007 – 2009 contract revenues and year-end raw material balances.
!


"#!


We observe that even the 2007 raw material balance seems quite low for a company that 
generated $42.1 million dollars through a slow moving, asset and labor-intensive 
production process making custom built products.  Common sense dictates that a factory 
such as this could not run a just in time system.  The 2007 number becomes even more 
implausible by 2009.  In contrast, Long King and Fei Da generated 2008 and 2009 sales 
no more than 21x raw materials (versus RINO’s 2009 figure of 760x).
!


"#!


Given the Flow of Funds from Shareholders to VIE, We Suspect that a Portion of 


the Paper Assets are Covering Up Misappropriation. 


 
Below is the asset portion of RINO’s balance sheet over the prior three quarters.  Note 
how cash (much of which RINO raised in a $100 million offering on December 7, 2009) 
has declined by $46.5 million in six months.  During this time, certain paper assets have 
ballooned – notably costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted 
contracts (+$35.6 million), advances for inventory (+$30.3 million), and accounts 
receivable (+$10.6 million).   
 
 


The least believable account balance above is advances for inventory.  The advances for 
inventory are far too many times the raw material balance to be taken seriously. 





 
If RINO keeps only one day of raw materials on hand (highly unlikely given the 
customized nature of its production), it would have effectively prepaid 138 to 355 days 
worth of raw materials during the periods shown above.  If RINO keeps two days on 
hand, the number of days it prepays range from 276 to 710.  RINO claims to purchase 
93% of its raw materials from only two suppliers.


24
  With such onerous payment terms, 


we suggest it look for other steel suppliers.  There seem to be more than a few in China.

RINO’s Gross Margins are Improbable Relative to the Rest of the Industry – 


Particularly Because RINO is a Minor Player, has a damaged reputation, and Uses 


an Inferior Technology.  RINO’s Characterizations of its Position Within the 


Industry are Misleading. 





Based on RINO’s obscure position in the highly competitive steel sinter FGD production 


industry, its tarnished reputation, and sub-par FGD technology, it is a virtual certainty 


that RINO has been significantly overstating its margins. RINO’s portrayal of the 


industry, and its position within it, are far from the reality we discovered. 





In conducting our industry research, we spoke with four producers of FGD systems for 


the steel industry,
25


 reviewed a 2009 report on the desulphurization industry in China,
26





spoke with an academic who works for the China Iron and Steel Association and is 


familiar with the steel industry FGD market, reviewed a third party-provided report by a 


Bao Steel engineer on RINO’s CFB FGD system, reviewed seven articles on the market 


for steel sinter FGD systems in China, and spoke with nine steel mills that RINO states 


are customers.   





RINO’s gross margins are far in excess of those of the industry leader. 





RINO historically claims 35% to 40% gross margins on its FGD systems.  This is out of 


line with the industry.  Most producers generate 10% to 15% gross margins – Long King, 


which is one of the market leaders, recently reached 20% in the first half of 2010.  The 


table below shows the gross margin calculation for the FGD divisions of Fei Da and 


market leader Long King. 



































In one meeting with three FGD executives from an FGD producer, we mentioned that 


RINO generates 35% gross margins.  The result was comical.  Each face registered 


palpable surprise (not quite shock), which then became expressions of confusion as they 


turned to each other while asking “35?”  After a couple of seconds, the confusion 


subsided and was replaced with slight nods and barely perceptible grins.

RINO is an obscure company in its industry 


 
RINO is an obscure player in the steel sinter FGD system industry.  The FGD producers 
(i.e., RINO’s competition) with which we spoke were either unfamiliar with RINO, or 
stated that it is a small company.  At one meeting with an FGD producer, only one of the 
three division executives had previously heard of RINO.   
 
In contrast, the producers gave the same two names when asked to discuss the market 
leaders: Long King, and China City Environment Protection Engineering Limited 
Company.  Long King generated about $172 million in desulphurization system revenue 
in 2009


27
 (most of which was in the power generation industry).  Each producer 


mentioned other apparently formidable players in the industry; however, there was no 
consensus among the producers on these names.  However, RINO was not among any 
names they gave. Were RINO to have really generated the $116.4 million in steel sinter 
FGD sales it claims for 2009, it is improbable that it would have such a low profile 
among its competitors.  (It likely would have been far and away the highest profile and 
most successful company in the industry.) 
 
A senior executive for Bao Steel (which RINO claims is a FGD customer) who oversaw 
installation of three FGD systems at Bao is quite familiar with Long King.  Long King 
worked on one of the systems he oversaw.  The executive had never heard RINO’s name 
before. 
 
There are dozens of Chinese companies (possibly over 50) vying to produce FGD 
systems for steel sinters.  Most of these companies have pedigrees from the coal fired 
power generation industry, which started adopting FGD systems on a large scale in 1999.  
Many competitors have licensed their FGD technologies from Japanese and European 
companies.  Other competitors have licensed their technologies from Chinese 
universities.  In other words, RINO’s license from the Chinese Academy of Science is not 
unique or particularly advantageous. 
 
RINO: obscuring obscurity 


 
Investors can be forgiven for not understanding that RINO is an obscure company in the 
steel sinter FGD industry.  RINO has not been forthcoming about being in the middle of a 
crowded field. One example of RINO’s lack of forthrightness is a March 31, 2010 
statement that it believes it is the only company producing FGD systems for steel sinters, 
and that it has a two to three-year lead over potential competitors.


28
  Eight months earlier 


(August 9, 2009), Long King announced that it completed one of the largest steel sinter 
FGD projects ever in the world.  (It is for a 400 square meter sinter owned by a 
subsidiary of Bao Steel).


29
  Further, approximately 35 steel sinter FGD systems had been 


installed by the end of 2009
30


 with RINO having been involved in few of them.

While RINO’s obscurity may have escaped RINO, there seems to be growing awareness 


of this issue within the mainstream investment community.  Two recently released equity 


research reports highlight greater than anticipated competition as reasons for 


downgrades.
31








To the extent RINO has a reputation among steel mills, it is poor 





We received negative feedback on RINO’s work from one confirmed client and one 


fabricated client.  Panzhihua Steel confirmed that RINO built the smallest of its FGD 


systems (for a 180 square meter sinter).  The Panzhihua employee stated, “We are not 


satisfied with [RINO’s] technology because the desulphurization rate is lower than what 


we want.”  He further stated that Panzhihua is unlikely to engage RINO in the future for 


FGD projects. 





An employee from fabricated client Lai Steel Group stated “I’ve heard that the sinter 


built by RINO in Jinan has stopped running.  Their technology has no advantage beside 


not producing wastewater.”  We confirmed that RINO built one FGD system for Jinan 


Iron & Steel Group in 2005.  Jinan Iron & Steel Group refused to comment on RINO’s 


work.  





RINO’s technology is inferior to competing semi-dry technologies in the China market 





We reviewed a report provided by the International Financial Research & Analysis 


Group
32


 on an interview with a Bao Steel engineer who is familiar with RINO’s 


circulating fluidized bed (“CFB”) technology.  Based on our own work, we believe that 


the following report is accurate: 





Introduction 





The FGD industry expert (from here on referred to as “the expert”) is an engineer at 


Baosteel Group’s in-house research institute. We have kept the identity of the engineer 


anonymous per his request. With over 20 years of experience in the Chinese steel 


industry and close to 10 years of experience dealing with desulphurization related 


research and projects, he is an expert.  He personally participated in the development of 


Baosteel’s proprietary Jet Cyclone Tower desulphurization technology, which has been 


successfully utilized in three of Baosteel group’s completed FGD projects and stably 


operating for almost three years.   He was also actively involved in the planning, design 


and implementation of the three FGD projects.  The same technology is currently being 


implemented in two more FGD systems currently under construction at Baosteel.  





With intimate knowledge of the CFB method developed by the Chinese Academy of 


Science (CAS), the expert claims he is quite familiar with RINO’s CFB desulphurization 


method.  We showed him a description of RINO’s technology and flow-chart in the 10K

and were told this was the exact same technology from CAS.  He then showed us a 


detailed document about the CFB method received directly from CAS and claimed that 


this was a more updated version of RINO’s CFB. 





Specific issues with RINO’s CFB technology 


 
The expert assured us Baosteel has NEVER used RINO’s CFB method in any of its FGD 


projects and is very unlikely to use it in the future due to the following problems in their 


technology: 





1. Low sulfur reduction rate – RINO’s CFB method has a low sulfur reduction rate 


compared to the wet method, although the rate is already high among all other 


semi-dry methods.  With relatively high Calcium to Sulfur ratio of 1.4/1, the 


sulfur reduction rate can reach approximately 81%, greatly increasing the 


operating cost of the FGD.  It is also unclear how such technology performs on 


flue gas with very high sulfur content. 


2. High operating cost   


a. The required time for the CFB technology’s circulation process is long 


compared to the wet method. This is because it takes longer for the 


chemical reaction to take place under a semi-dry environment.  The 


result of a longer circulation process is the limited units (cubic meters) of 


flue gas desulfurized in a given time (an hour), in other words, the CFB 


method does not work well on a large size sinter with high flue gas 


output, such as Sinter #3 at Baosteel. 


b. In addition to the high calcium to sulfur ratio mentioned above, the 


desulphurization chemical agent used in the CFB method is CaO (a much 


more expensive chemical agent when compared to the limestone used in 


Baosteel’s Jet Cyclone Tower method) plus the utilization rate of CaO 


under this method is quite low.  Both factors lead to a higher operating 


cost of the system. 


c. The byproducts of the FGD system using RINO’s CFB method include 


CaSO3, CaSO4, CaO and coal ash in dust form and are all of little to no 


economic value. In contrast, Baosteel’s own desulphurization method 


produces gypsum as a byproduct, which can be sold to reduce overall 


operating cost. 


3. Upfront investment required is not necessarily low as claimed. 


a. Since the end byproducts are in dust form and hard to handle, separate 


dust reducing equipment is required as part of the overall system, 


increasing the total construction cost. 


b. The overall footprint of the FGD system is not necessarily small. 


4. Lack of a stable operational history – the expert stated that the Jet Cyclone Tower 


method based FGD had a three year history of stable operation. He has yet to 


hear of any RINO technology based FGD system operating stably for that 


amount of time.  One notable failure is the RINO installed FGD system at Jinan 


Iron and Steel Company (Jinan Steel) which was using CFB technology.  The 


lack of a stable operational history creates uncertainty with regard to RINO’s 


FGD system.

An engineer from a competitor who is familiar in a general sense with the Chinese 
Academy of Science CFB system stated that the system is problematic because it creates 
too much pressure.  He was not familiar with RINO. 
 
While immaterial compared to their other sins, RINO management’s “borrowing” 


$3.5 million to purchase a luxury home in Orange County gives insight to their 


character, as well as a window into the dynamics between management, RINO’s 


independent directors, and the Company’s auditor. 


 
Mr. Zou and Ms. Qiu borrowed “approximately $3.5 million” on December 7, 2009.


33
  


This is the same day that RINO closed its $100.0 million financing.
34


  Two days later the 
couple bought a luxury home in Orange County, CA assessed at $3.2 million.


35
  (The 


couple currently has it on the market for $4.0 million: http://www.redfin.com/CA/Coto-
De-Caza/31232-Via-Colinas-92679/home/5054824) RINO disclosed the “loan” for the 
first time in its 2009 Form 10-K, filed on March 31, 2010.  The home purchase is less 
well known.   
 
Some have publicly stated that the couple took the loan out of naïveté about the 
complicated restrictions of being a public company.  We doubt that.  Based on the 
timeline of events and haphazard means of accounting for this loan, we wonder whether 
the couple volunteered that they had taken this money; or, whether the auditor uncovered 
it just before the filing deadline.   
 
If the latter, it begs questions of whether involved parties met their fiduciary duties.  
Further to that, the manner in which the home was used to secure the loan presents 
questions.  Finally, RINO claimed that the couple repaid the loan by May 10, 2010; 
however, the home title was not re-granted to the couple by RINO until sometime 
between May 28, 2010 and August 18, 2010.   
 
We doubt that the couple was unaware it was improper to borrow / take money from 
RINO.  PRC Company Law article 149 clearly prohibits this action.


36
  Might they have 


been unaware of this prohibition?  We find that unlikely – stories of minority 
shareholders getting screwed by management borrowing / taking money from their 
companies abound in China’s newspapers and business circles.  We are comfortable that 
they understood their duty not to take money from the company.  They just didn’t care. 
 
The couple transferred ownership of the home to RINO International Corp. as security for 
the loan on March 22


nd
, 2010.


37
  This was just before the filing deadline, and makes us 


think that because they could have transferred it in the three and one-half months prior, it

was part of a rushed process.  We therefore infer that the loan was first disclosed / 
discovered just prior to the home transfer.   
 
The inconsistent manner in which the loan is discussed and accounted for in the Form 10-
K adds to our belief that the disclosure / discovery was shortly before the filing deadline.   
 
The notes to the 10-K state that Zou and Qiu borrowed “approximately” $3.5 million, and 
had repaid $300,000 by the time of filing.  However, the balance sheet netted the $3.5 
million against $494,614 RINO owed to the couple as of December 31, 2009


38
, showing 


a “due from shareholders” balance of $3,005,386.  On the other hand, the cash flow 
statement shows that during 2009, RINO made a “payment to shareholder” of 
$5,093,486, while showing “proceeds from shareholder” of $1,532,372, which produces a 
net amount of $3,561,114.  These inconsistencies indicate that there was a rushed effort 
to account for the funds. 
 
If the disclosure / discovery came over three months after the money had been taken, a 
key question is whether the independent directors believed that taking the money was a 
mistake made in good faith.  We may never know the answer, but the manner in which 
the couple secured the loan is unusual.  Rather than RINO merely recording a lien on the 
home, the couple actually transferred it by grant deed (without consideration) to RINO.  
We wonder whether the transfer was viewed as a way to mitigate the risk that the couple 
would sell the home before repaying the loan.   
 
Another peculiarity in the series of events is that RINO claimed the couple repaid the 
loan on May 10, 2010; however, RINO did not return full ownership of the home to them 
until later – and how much later is unclear.  The couple executed a loan agreement with 
RINO on March 31, 2010 in which they agreed to repay the loan in full on or by May 10, 
2010.  RINO agreed to return the home within three business days of receiving 
repayment.  RINO’s 10-Q states that the couple did in fact repay the loan by this date.  
However, on May 14, 2010, RINO executed a deed of trust with the couple, which means 
they mortgaged the home (with RINO as the lender).  Oddly, the deed of trust states that 
the loan amount is $3,500 (three thousand five hundred dollars).  If they had repaid the 
loan at that point, why did RINO refrain from outright granting the home back to them? 
 
On August 18, 2010, the couple recorded a grant deed that returned unencumbered 
ownership of the home to them.  The conveyance to them was notarized on July 16, 2010, 
but the date on the deed is May 28, 2010.  These differing dates again make us wonder 
whether the loan was actually repaid when RINO claims it was. 
 
As we wrote, the amount of money involved in the home transaction is relatively 
immaterial, but we wonder whether shareholders were denied an earlier opportunity to 
gain a better understanding of the people running RINO.
