3 Days

Summary


Latest Salvage Inventory sheet: ~275 Double Eagles, ~35 oz of gold dust/nuggets
and ~100oz misc small denomination coins, 89% LESS gold collateral vs May 19 –
June 12 recovery.


Clearly no trace of “army gold” cache: zero ingots salvaged for the first time (vs 2
tiny ones in prior month).


Based on Fifth Third Loan Agreement, incremental double eagles should allow an
additional cash draw on credit line of ~$275,000. Enough to fund OMEX operating
losses for 3 extra days.


Inventory facts contradict promotional management statements on recent
conference call. OMEX now insolvent and likely filing bankruptcy shortly unless
vague “marketing agreement” debt closes soon.


Strategy Shift? Unnecessary early credit line draw to inflate Q2 cash balance and
unprofitable SSCA efforts appear to be attempts to spite short sellers while impairing
shareholders and creditors.


The inventory sheet from the latest month of Odyssey Marine Exploration
(NASDAQ:OMEX) salvage has just been posted on the SS Central America court website.
The total recovery is approximately 400oz of gold coins, dust and nuggets with no ingots.
The items that can be borrowed on the Fifth Third $10mm credit line (Double Eagles and
Ingots) include ~275 double eagles with a face value of $5,500, a decline of 89% vs the
May 19-June 12 recovery period where $51,799 face value of double eagles and ingots
were recovered.


This recovery should allow OMEX to borrow an additional $275,000 ($1,000 per
double eagle) against the existing Fifth Third credit line which should be enough to fund
an additional 3 days of cash burn based on losses to date ($3mm/month = $100k/day
approx.). In total there should be a max credit availability of ~$7.25mm on this $10mm
credit line (net of $500k restricted cash).

Table of all monthly SS Centra America recovery reports so far, source Meson / court docs


"First of all, we have secured or negotiated a new loan agreement, the first $5 million of
that loan agreement we expect to come in, in the coming days or week, but probably this
month in the month of August.


Secondly, we've drawn down an additional amount on the bank loan facility that we
secured in the month of May, based on our cargo recovery results in recent weeks." - CFO
Philip Devine Q2 Conf Call Aug 11


On the conference call, the CFO was highly evasive of answering the question of how
much extra they were able to draw on the credit line, only saying they "drew an additional
amount." As it turns out, this amount must be only $275k or so, enough to finance a mere
few days of operational losses. Given you know the facts now about the second
statement, are you optimistic about the vague language of the first?


How does the fact of this new recovery square with recent statements by
management on the conference call?


OMEX Q2 Conference Call [Facts inserted by author]:


"The SS Central America project has gone through phases of high rates of valuable cargo
recovery and phases of lower recovery rates depending on which parts of the ships we're
working on….


The recovery rate in May and the first half of June was very significant. [FACT:
~$52,000 face value of gold recovered that month] The rate of recovery of valuable cargo
items slowed down in the period between June 15th and July 15th [FACT: ~$3,500 face
value of gold recovered this period] as we spent time moving large deposits of debris from
an area of the shipwreck believed to hold important artifacts effect and valuable cargo.
This was a planned and necessary step in carrying out a thorough archeological recovery.


These past weeks have again seen an uptick in recovery results coming from newly
explored areas of the shipwreck site. It was this renewed rate of cargo recovery that
allowed us today to draw down a further cash advance from our bank on our $10 million
credit facility." - CFO Philip Devine


"For the past week, we've had a substantial recovery success" - COO, Mark Gordon

"With a steady stream of gold coming up from the SS Central America, the Oceanica
project moving forward rapidly…" - CEO Greg Stemm, Q2 PR


Shareholders might be tempted to think that this "uptick in recovery results" in "newly
explored areas" might be comparable to the early results, right? FACT: Total gold recovery
declined over 80% from the May-June period to the most recent "uptick" month, and
declined 89% if only counting the gold eligible for collateral on the credit line, which is the
only gold that can produce immediate cash inflows to fund operations.


"the Oceanica phosphate project is progressing beyond our original expectations" - COO,
Mark Gordon


FACT: Oceanica EIA still isn't filed despite CEO Greg Stemm claiming "finished and will
be filed shortly" 10 weeks ago at June 4 AGM, locals are protesting including a Member of
the Senate


"we have just entered into a loan and long term exclusive marketing agreement which
provides up to $10 million in new funding" - COO, Mark Gordon


FACT: A Letter of Intent (LOI) is NOT an Agreement and the deal has not closed


"I am asking you to give your management team a chance to allow actual results to
influence your judgment as to whether OMEX is an investment you should buy, hold or
sell. I urge you to make this decision for yourselves based on real facts" - COO, Mark
Gordon


OMEX Now Almost Certainly Officially Insolvent


OMEX's Stockholders' Equity is now almost certainly negative: it was only $2.158mm at
the end of Q2 and losses have almost certainly exceeded this now given the $3mm/month
loss rate. Even using wildly optimistic accrual accounting, assuming a receivable (netting
expenses) booked at $2mm/month for work done at the SS Central America, a
$1mm/month loss (far better than has been achieved so far this year) leads to shareholder
equity being negative at the start of September.

Business Strategy Now seems Aimed towards Spiting Short Sellers Rather than
Shareholder (and Creditor) Value


Since last October 2013, we have said we want OMEX to increase its transparency with
shareholders. The harsh reality, we believe, is that once shareholders realize the full truth
about OMEX, they will realize that it has no prospect to be a viable business and the stock
will become worthless. Indeed, management appears aware of the issue, describing
themselves as an "easy target" for short seller commentary on the most recent conference
call. Had current shareholders invested their money instead in any of the OMEX-related
private entities (Neptune, Mako, Seagrass, etc.) their money would have been already lost
and no liquidity available to cash out. The fact that the stock still trades, allowing people to
exit at an astoundingly high $100mm market capitalization is an unusual opportunity
provided by public markets.


Unfortunately, it seems management has gone the other direction - rather than addressing
their "easy target" status by improving the business model, they are trying to sweep the
facts even further under the rug by changing their business strategy towards actions that
appear designed to spite short sellers (in the short term at least) while destroying
shareholder value - and we believe further impairing creditors in bankruptcy coming
shortly. In fact, OMEX even dedicated a solid paragraph in its most recent legal 10Q
document complaining about short sellers.
