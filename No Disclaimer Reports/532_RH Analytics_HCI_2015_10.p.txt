HCI Group: More Risk, Less Return

Summary


HCI's new takeouts mark a strategic shift toward high-risk low-return policies.


Expected loss ratios on HCI's takeouts are significantly higher than its existing book.


We expect reinsurance costs to increase and margins to be pressured.


We believe the new takeouts are unlikely to be profitable for shareholders long term.


The HCI Group (NYSE:HCI) announced two assumptions in Q4'14, one was completed in
December, the other is scheduled for February. In a previous article, we provided detailed
analysis of the December takeout and the substantial increase in risk marked by the
assumption of wind-only policies. Data obtained from the Florida regulator indicates that
the February takeout book is riskier still, with exceptionally high expected losses.


In recent years, investors have had the luxury of focusing on the possible returns
associated with homeowner's insurance in the Florida. Mild storm seasons have allowed
catastrophic risks to recede from view, becoming abstract probabilities rather than real
threats. The benign environment is allowing HCI to ramp-up risks significantly for minimal,
incremental profit potential, likely in attempt to maintain growth. With low margins under
the best of assumptions, we believe the new takeouts are unlikely to be profitable long
term.


The table below provides risk statistics from HCI's existing book as well as the two
takeouts.

For our analysis, we take the average of the low and high estimates generated by the two
hurricane models. For HCI's existing book, the average probable maximum loss or PML is
$1.1B. The average of the average annual loss to total insured value, AAL (Average
Annual Loss) to TIV (Total Insured Value), is 0.179%; and the average of the average
annual loss to in-force premium, AAL to premium, 21.1%.


The loss estimates for the new takeouts are significantly higher than those for HCI's
existing book. The AAL to TIV increases from 0.179% to 0.305% and 0.48%, respectively,
for the two takeouts. The AAL to premium increases from 21.1% to 40% and 57.4%,
respectively. That is, average annual losses for the February takeout are expected to be
an astounding $0.574 for every $1 in premium collected. The expected losses on the book
are 2.7x greater than HCI's existing book - a massive increase in risk.


Policies with such high expected losses are very expensive to reinsure and will likely put
downward pressure on margins. As an example, in a letter to the OIR (Office of Insurance
Regulation), HCI stated that reinsurance would cost 67% of premiums for the December
takeout. The February book has a higher loss to premium ratio; one would assume that
the cost of reinsuring the book would be higher on a stand-alone basis.


The table below depicts HCI's underwriting business model and estimates the profitability
of the new policies assuming high reinsurance rates.


More Risk for Less Return

In documents filed with the regulator, HCI estimated that 2014 reinsurance costs would be
28% of gross premiums. For our estimates of profitability for the new books, we assume a
reinsurance cost of 65%. Assuming zero losses, the pretax underwriting margin would be
10%; a 5% loss ratio leads to a very slim 5% pretax underwriting margin. Our margin
estimates are in line with HCI's forecasts for the December book provided to the OIR.
