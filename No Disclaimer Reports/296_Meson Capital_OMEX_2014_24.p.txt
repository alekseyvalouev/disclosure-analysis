Is More Dilution Coming Soon For Odyssey Shareholders?

Summary


OMEX Management is adamant in public statements that they do not need to raise
equity, yet their SEC filings make a more 'open' stance on the topic.


Over the last 12 months, shareholders have been significantly diluted both from
share count increasing and also from project level / subsidiary dilution.


Cash looks like it is about to run out very soon and all current projects are
encumbered.


SSCA monetization still hazy as court appeals go on: could be next "Black Swan"?
Oceanica public consultation this week will illuminate.


One year ago now we stated that we believe that within the next 12 months, Odyssey
Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) will be forced to file bankruptcy or raise equity and
dilute shareholders. There has not yet been a bankruptcy filing though shareholders have
been diluted and the company has significantly curtailed operations including shelving the
big commodity wreck program, the CEO resigned, and the Dorado Discovery 2nd ship has
been released.


The company has been able to raise some equity over the last 12 months, diluting
shareholders (discussed below in detail) but we believe there is much more dilution
coming soon if the company expects to avoid a bankruptcy filing.


Management Says They Don't Need to Raise Equity


Aug 15, 2013: "These results, along with planned monetization of mineral exploration
projects, put us in position to fund our scheduled exploration and recovery activities
through this year and most of 2014," said Greg Stemm


Since our report raising serious questions was posted Oct 31, 2013, management has
been highly explicit and adamant in public statements that they do not need to raise
equity:

Nov 7, 2013 FAQ:


"We have no plans for any OMEX stock offering in 2013 or 2014."


Q1 Conf Call May 2014:


"We believe that our cash on hand and these other cash sources will be sufficient to cover
our costs and pursue our planned projects for the rest of the year."


CFO: "Let me start of by making something very clear. We have no plans to do any equity
raise with Odyssey stock."


CFO: "All of the different scenarios have been envisaged, and all of them do not require
an equity raise for 2014. So that, I think that's clarified."


2014 AGM Q&A June 4, 2014


"We do not anticipate needing to undertake any equity raise in 2014."


Q2 Conf Call Aug 2014: Discussing new "Marketing Loan": "There is no dilution of
Odyssey equity, and we receive an immediate $5 million with an additional $5 million in
funding available to us in the coming months, based on attaining certain mutually agreed
performance targets"


"We are not facing any sort of imminent liquidity crisis and I'm confident we have the cash
and funding in place that will carry us through to our next significant monetization events"


"I'm asking you to give your Management team a chance to allow actual results to
influence your judgment as to whether OMEX is an investment you should buy, hold or
sell."


Getting a Different Picture from the Legal SEC Docs


All of the above quotes were made with the benefit of a "safe harbor" for forward looking
statements in press releases that are highly forgiving when it comes to making optimistic
statements from a legal perspective. Shareholders should always check the official SEC
legal documents to corroborate press release statements as making untrue statements in
SEC filings can have serious consequences, in contrast to press releases.

We may also have to revert to capital raises that include equity and/or convertible
debt to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated cash balance at
June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support approximately two
months of operations. â€¦


While we have been successful in generating cash inflows and raising the necessary
funds in the past, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in 2014
or the following twelve months.


Understanding What Dilution Means


To use a pie analogy: Dilution occurs when a slice of the pie (e.g. share of the total) you
hold becomes smaller. This can happen either by:


1) Making your slice "narrower" by directly increasing the number of slices: imagine the
size of a pie cut 10 ways rather than 6.


2) Making the slices "thinner" by introducing additional layers of slices below the surface
of the pie.


Three specific examples of dilution of shareholder value in the last 12 months:


1) $2.4mm of the 8% note which was partially repaid in cash but where OMEX issued
1.29mm shares to repay this note with stock in Q2 2014: "In 2014, we issued 1,290,155
shares of common stock, valued at $2,420,863" - 10Q Aug 2014


2) $2.5mm raised to sell a % of Oceanica to Mako Resources in January 2014


3) $5mm "marketing loan" Aug 2014 which includes giving equity of a subsidiary as
consideration (Details not yet disclosed except in 8K filed Aug 14: "As further
consideration for the credit facility, Odyssey assigned to the lender a portion of the shares

that Odyssey owns in an Odyssey subsidiary")


These actions sum up so that in addition to the share count increasing from 83,587,243 on
Oct 25 (Q3 2013 10Q) to 85,229,295 on July 21, 2014 (Q2 2013 10Q) = 1,642,052
increase of 2% making your slice "narrower", the share slices have been made thinner by
shrinking OMEX's ownership in its subsidiaries.


When Might Shareholder Dilution be Coming? Soon!


A company needs cash to fund payroll and other operations or it comes to a grinding halt.
So far, OMEX has been able to kick the can down the road with project level dilution but
we do not see how this could be possible going forward. All of OMEX's projects appear to
already have project level overrides or financing associated with them already and there
do not appear to be any unencumbered assets that could be borrowed against (the ship is
likely too old to get a loan against).


We also still don't know what subsidiary the most recent "marketing loan" was granted
shares in. We also know from on-the-ground sources that OMEX was attempting to raise
money for Oceanica in the UK this summer but was unsuccessful in doing so. The EIA
has been filed and there has been significant opposition to the project but much more
information will be available after the official public consultation in Mexico later this week.


Estimating When Cash Could Run Out


OMEX's Historical Operating Cash burn (Cash flow from operations + capex):


Q1 2014: $11.76mm = $3.92mm/mo


Q2 2014: $7.35mm (but accounts payables increased by $1mm) so cash burn would be
$8.35mm excluding this. $2.78mm/mo


(looking historically, the lowest it's ever been in the last decade on an annual basis is
about $1.5mm/mo)


Let's say an optimistic estimate is $2mm/month cash burn for Q3 and onwards and
pessimistic is $3mm/month.
