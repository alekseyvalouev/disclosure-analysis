TechTarget: Google's Panda Crushes Visibility
Jun. 19, 2014 1:38 PM ET7 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


For many companies, the adage applies: The more favorable the Google
impressions, the more traffic and the more revenue.


Substantial companies such as eBay, Demand Media and RetailMeNot suffered
losses in SEO visibility caused by Google's Panda algorithm updates – along with
stock value losses.


Unnoticed by the market, tiny TechTarget's SEO visibility and search traffic got
crushed by last month's Panda update.


Blinded by TechTarget's timing of a positive financial report with another public
offering, investors also overlooked an insider's recent indirect share sales worth $17
million.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) has peered into the gaping jaws of death.


And those jaws belong to… a Panda.


Not China's bamboo-chomping bear. Rather, it was Google's Panda update designed to
snuff out low-quality content from Google's top search results pages.


Many companies have suffered crushing declines in Google impressions caused by last
month's Panda update - and corresponding losses in stock value.


Now, TheStreetSweeper has found an overlooked Panda victim - TTGT.


Shares of the Newton, Mass. company - which is focused on drawing traffic to generate IT
leads - hit this year's high of $8.46 on June 10.


However, the market was unaware that weeks earlier, the company lost more than 33
percent in search visibility, according to a list of losers and winners.


With TTGT's significant decline in SEO visibility - which happened around the same time
of a 5-million-share secondary offering - we think the market has missed a crucial factor.

We believe the stock faces much more significant consequences than the 28 percent
stock value slashing endured by a peer company caught by Panda.


In a statement released to TheStreetSweeper, TTGT said organic traffic remains ahead of
last year.


"Our experience with the recent Google algorithm changes is consistent with what
we've seen on previous algorithm changes over the almost 15 years that we have
been in business. We operate over 100 websites, and in the immediate aftermath of
a algorithm change we see some sites traffic increase and others decline."


"On a broader point - our experience is that there is an enormous amount of
fluctuation after a major Google algorithm change."


TTGT went on to say that the company has adapted to the changes and has established a
successful track record over time in terms of how the changes play out.


Still, we're not sure why insiders have been selling. Regardless, investors may find various
viewpoints on TTGT HERE.


WHAT HAPPENED TO IMPRESSIONS?


Jealously guarding its top search market share, Google began using the code-named
"Panda" in 2011 to filter out poor content so that higher-quality content would rise in
search rankings.


Google's leader of the Webspam team, Matt Cutts, tweeted the launch of the Panda
update on May 20. Within days, many websites watched as the dreaded drop in organic
rankings turned into reality.


Digital coupon marketer RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) fell victim to Panda's 4.0 wallop,
according to Searchmetrics. SALE suffered a huge loss in its Google impressions and,
within days, a record decline in stock.


SALE plummeted over $8 - 28 percent - in just a few days. About three weeks later, SALE
still has not been able to climb back to its old high-flying $30 level.


Check the visibility loss for both TTGT and SALE, provided by the Searchmetrics Winners
and Losers analysis.


TTGT shows a greater than 33 percent decline in SEO (search engine optimization)
visibility (not visits), the exact percentage drop suffered by SALE.

"TechTarget just went overboard in pandering to Google," explained an analyst who
requested anonymity.


Compared with six weeks before Panda, SEO visibility (not visitors) dropped to about
86,000 from about 190,000.


This drop is no small thing for TTGT.


According to the May 25 prospectus that is part of its shelf registration of 5 million
shares, TTGT considers search engine ranking a key competitive advantage:


"Favorable Search Engine Rankings, Organic search-driven website traffic was up
35% in the first quarter… This is a testament to the power of our targeted content
model, which is the foundation of our data business."


So Panda took a swipe at the company's very foundation just as TTGT climbed to an EPS
of zero from a 4 cent loss the quarter before.


Though other factors may have had some influence, it appears that Panda has
accomplished its mission to uproot less impressive sites in its quest to improve visitors'
experiences.


Looking at the SALE chart and the TTGT chart - it's easy to see the spectacular drop in
SEO visibility for both companies in mid-May.

But something else jumps out when we compare TTGT and SALE stock price charts.
Though they experienced the same visibility decline, their stock prices are completely out
of sync. So the market recognized SALE's issues. But it has not recognized the very same
issues with TTGT, below:


SALE released a statement saying SALE "experienced some shift in rankings and traffic,"
adding that it is diversifying its traffic sources.


eBAY WRESTLES PANDA


That's not all. Panda's not-so-gentle paw also clamped down hard on the $62-billion
mammoth eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).


eBay's experience with Panda prompted comments like this one from
Business2Community:

"The decline in ranking has hurt eBay badly. However, since it contains hundreds
(of) thousands of pages, it is quite hard to tell what the future holds for the Internet
consumer-to-consumer corporation. Nevertheless, its popularity is bound to see
decline for a limited duration, during which eBay's traffic and sales would be affected
significantly."


eBay hasn't released a statement on the visibility report, possibly because about the same
time, eBay asked customers to change their passwords due to a cyber attack.


While there may be other factors at work, relevant charts appear to reveal what eBay
didn't. eBay's chart shows the major hit in SEO visibility and a stock decline that the
company - obviously a far healthier company than TTGT - has not been able to shake.


MAY 2013: PANDA CHEWS UP DEMAND MEDIA


Panda really began making its presence known last year, when the third major rewrite
offered webmasters a hand-wringing glimpse into the possible effects of algorithm
updates. That rewrite smacked many, including eHow.com, the star property of Demand
Media (DMD). The company depends on Google for more than half of its traffic, the 10-Q
states.


DMD's recent quarterly securities filing discloses the search engine algorithm changes
may cause


"fluctuations in the total number of Google search referrals to our owned and
operated and network of customer websites. In 2011 and 2013, the overall impact of
these changes on our owned and operated websites was negative primarily due to a
decline in traffic to eHow.com, our largest website."


DMD's recent Securities and Exchange Commission document continues:


"These changes have resulted, and may continue to result, in substantial declines in
traffic to our owned and operated websites."


The chart shows that the Panda hit marked the beginning of a stock value slide that
persists to the current day. Unique visitors declined to over 80 million from 125 million,
while revenues declined to $89.8 million from $101.1 million as operating losses rose.

TTGT is definitely insignificant compared with substantial companies like EBAY, DMD and
even SALE. But if Panda knocked the lights out of these companies, it's hard to imagine
what it will do to scrawny TTGT and its investors.


LIFE OR DEATH ISSUES GO BACK TO 2011


Companies seem to live and die on that old adage: The better the Google impressions,
the more traffic and the more revenue.


Only three years ago, DMD shares traded for an overly optimistic $26. The astonishing
stock slide to the current price of under $5 can be connected to those regular, sometimes
monthly, updates of the deceptively passive-sounding Panda.


People were eating up DMD's "how-to" website, eHow, in December 2010 with questions
like, "How to brew beer," or "How to fix a toilet," or "How to groom a dog." But no one
posed what might well be one of the most important questions to DMD's existence, "How
to avoid Panda."


Google was already aiming at spam-riddled, thin, aggregated content with weapons code-
named Panda, Penguin and Hummingbird.


Just three months after DMD ventured out with its IPO at $17 in January 2011, a rewritten,
soft-eyed Panda lay waiting at its doorstep. Teeth bared.


When Panda bit that April, DMD shares plummeted after an SEO software firm published
a report saying eHow had suffered a 66 percent decline in visibility on Google since that
Panda update.


DMD, much like SALE, issued a statement pooh-poohing the report, stating the company
had seen an impact but the decline was "significantly overstated." The company followed
up with a quarterly report showing an estimated 20 percent decline in search referrals.
However, the next quarter's report showed that was not quite right. Revenue had not
grown from its $79.5 million level, and the report concluded that Panda caused "a
substantial reduction in the total number of search referrals."


There's been no statement from TTGT, of course, since Panda's impact on the company
has been unknown - until now.


Word is that Google will continue providing Panda updates.

TTGT has gained investors' good graces by reporting improved guidance, a new product
and a better-than-expected $23 million quarterly revenue, plus a paltry $135,000 net
income after a loss. Generally, it's flying under the radar.


Market blindness toward TTGT's issues - combined with the release of a positive earnings
report the same day a public offering was kicked off - created an atmosphere that allowed
the smooth sale of millions of TTGT shares.


TTGT director Jay Hoag and others indirectly sold 2.8 million shares for $17 million as part
of the May public offering of 5 million shares - offered at a slight discount by Polaris
Venture entities and by entities of Technology Crossover Venture, managed by Mr. Hoag.
Selling shareholders, not TTGT, received the proceeds.


Those shareholders joined other insiders who may have been tipping their hand, as
they've sold multi-millions worth of TTGT in just the last six months. In fact, insiders have
sold and sold over the years, pocketing upwards of $63 million.


Yet, TTGT is largely ignored by analysts, sports a ridiculously generous $6 price target
and reports yearly revenue declines that have deepened since 2011. The operating
income of this company with the astounding $265 million market cap has consistently
dropped, to the point of losing $2.5 million in 2013.


Now, TTGT must try to overcome that seemingly gentle, doe-eyed virtual monster that has
chomped away at both search traffic and SEO visibility so vital to its business of delivering
customers.


The market has punished SALE, EBAY and DMD over their crushing Panda experience.


Google's Panda has TTGT locked in its virtual fangs. Now the market knows, and the end
result will be ugly.


Search traffic clearly suffered too under Panda. Note the similar declines in search traffic
in the charts below for TTGT and SALE, respectively.
