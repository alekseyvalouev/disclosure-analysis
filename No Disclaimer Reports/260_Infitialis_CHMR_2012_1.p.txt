Pay Per Click Ads Help This Houston Promoter Run 2 Simultaneous
Scams - Part 1: CHMR

Note: The accuracy of this article has been disputed.


After learning about the world of OTCBB scams and issuing our first piece of research on
Quest Water Global (OTCPK:QWTR) we thought we had experienced one of the nastiest
manifestations of micro-cap fraud. Here we had a company that was clearly setup to sell
shares to US investors at inflated prices by undisclosed persons residing offshore. Worst,
the story being sold to naïve investors was one of a humanitarian mission that would help
produce water from air to the impoverished in Angola.


Then we encountered Chimera Energy Corp. (OTC:CHMR) and Nova Mining Corp.
(NVMN.OB) two interrelated scams that combined have less than $130,000 in cash, no
physical office space, and negative shareholder equity that have been manipulated to a
combined market valuation nearing $200,000,000 by an unnamed Houston based stock
promoter.


Unfortunately the facilitator of these stock scams and many others like it is one of our
country's most innovative and respected companies: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) - through
their online advertising system AdWords. Without Google, scams like CHMR and NVMN
would never find their way to the portfolios of naive investors. Google is the trusted bridge
investors cross when searching for keywords that are relevant to their investment goals.
Keywords such as: "Safe investments", "Online Trading", and "Fixed Investments". Only
on the other side of this bridge are stock promoters who pay more than TD Ameritrade or
E*TRADE for the right to place their ads on top of Google's search results. Inexperienced
investors click these ads and eventually a few take the bait purchasing shares directly
from promoters for $1, $2, and even $3 a share having no idea that the shares being sold
to them were purchased for less than half a penny and that the company underlying these
shares has no inherent value.


We sincerely believe that Google executives are completely in the dark and don't fully
comprehend the destruction in wealth being facilitated by these ads. We remind Google to
refer to its Prospectus from 2004 where it stated "DON'T BE EVIL"

In our view Google should not allow non-registered firms to advertise any securities
period. Just as Google does not allow offshore gambling sites from advertising to U.S.
persons it should regulate the entities bidding on financial related keywords. A copy of this
report was forwarded to Google's Chief of Compliance. We recommend that readers who
share this view do the same.


In Part 1 of this report we will cover CHMR - a Company with one employee and tangible
equity of just $4,549 (not even enough to buy a 2003 Ford Focus) that is valued at
$120,000,000 with nearly $40,000,000 in free trading float shares being liquidated into
unsophisticated retail investors. Part 2 will cover NVMN and more details on the identity of
the man from Houston orchestrating these frauds through offshore companies in the
Marshall Islands.

Full Time Employees 1 - Charles Earl Grob, Jr. AKA Chuck Grob,


Age: 31


Corporate Offices


Chimera Energy doesn't have a physical corporate office. Instead they lease a virtual
office from ServCorp for $200 a month electing to use their address forwarding and virtual
phone number plan. We are puzzled as to why the perpetrators of this scam didn't elect to
choose the $305 a month plan which included access to a conference room. Surely even
promoters could make use of a physical conference room.


The Business


The most effective exercise in demonstrating to readers that CHMR is a scam is to review
its chronology from inception to now through the perspective of Charles E. Grob Jr. the 31
year old who is the only named employee in the company, as well as through the role of
the unnamed Houston promoter that owns the 20,000,000 free trading shares purchased
for $.0038.

December


21, 2011


Receives approval for his S1 from the SEC


January 6,


2012


Sells 5,000,000 free trading shares relying on the S-1 filed with the SEC to "third


parties" @ $.015 per share.


Here the roles split…


Charles Earl Grob Jr. Unnamed Houston Promoter


March 1, 2012 - As the sole CEO/COO/CFO and


Director, awards himself a salary of $2,500 a month.


April 2012 - Sets up a cloud server hosting


account with Rackspace in San Antonio


Texas. This account will be used to host


the websites and promotional referral sites


used in the scams CHMR and NVMN.


June 26, 2012 - Effectuates a 4:1 Forward Split


lowering his average cost to $.00025 and that of the


20,000,000 free trading float shares owned by the


unnamed Houston promoter to $.0038.


May 2012 - Hires an Indian web design


company to build the websites:


chimeraenergyusa.com, nova-mining.com,


zerowaterfracking.com,


foxmarketreport.com,


July 26, 2012 - Licenses a technology from a Chinese


company nobody has ever heard of for $5,000 a


month in a 4 page contract with no mention of any


patent numbers or description of the technology.


June 2012 - Produces a 2:29 minute long


promotional video full of sound bites and


generalities relating hydraulic fracturing.

or existence of this potentially world-


changing service.

July 30, 2012 - Puts out a sensational press release


touting a technology licensed less than 90 hours


prior as a "breakthrough" that will replace an industry


standard drilling technique employed by multi-billion


dollar energy companies for nearly a decade.


July 2012 - Sets up and funds a Google


AdWords account as well as accounts with


other online PPC (pay per click)


companies. Sets up and funds an account


with the Wall Street Journal online network


for display ads that will run on: WSJ.com,


Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com.


Initiates the distribution of the ads


coinciding with the first press release


issued by Charles Earl Gorb Jr. on July 30,


2012.


From August 1, 2012 - August 10, 2012 puts out 6


press releases in 8 trading days discussing everything


from how the recent drought makes his technology


even more attractive to how he plans on attending a


conference anybody with $475 can attend while


making sure to cram as many multi-national stock


symbols into the press releases like (NYSE:HAL)


(NYSE:SLB) (NYSE:ECA) and (NYSE:CLR) so that


naïve investors browsing those company's


financial news feeds might accidentally see these


releases and be duped into investing their hard-


earned savings.


July 30-Present - A blitzkrieg of display


and text ads is ultimately successful in


duping retail investors into purchasing


CHMR shares directly from the promoter.


During this period the promoter liquidates


some of the 20,000,000 shares that were


purchased for $.0038 at a minimum price


of $1.00 and as high as $2.00. From July


30th until August 10th over 5,288,000


shares of CHMR trade hands at an


average price of $1.55 for $8,218,000


worth of dollar volume.


Unfortunately the perpetrators of this scam have thus far rung the register to the tune of
over $8,000,000. That money has come from the brokerage accounts of hard-working
U.S. investors that were most probably new to the world of investing or were gullible
enough to believe that CHMR was a legitimate enterprise. As we explained in the opening
section of the report it is not entirely their fault as the path which led them to CHMR was
one they instinctively trust.

Even the most astute investors could fall for such an ad believing that the Wall Street Journal with its


impeccable reputation would at minimum scrub their advertising clients before allowing an ad on


their website. There is no doubt in our minds that Rupert Murdoch would have put an end to this


immediately had he known his most prized possession is being used as a tool to dupe investors.


Investors that are outraged should email their complaints to: wsj.ltrs@wsj.com


The Google Adwords Promotion


The WSJ network display ads were only a small component of the CHMR promotion. The
real heavy lifting was done through the Google Adwords platform. Here the unnamed
Houston promoter was able to leverage Google's search engine to target keywords that
would deliver the most relevant investors to his doorstep. Using SEO profiler we were able
to identify 7 different text ads used by the promoter:


These ads were displayed whenever a variety of keywords were typed by unsuspecting
googlers. While it is nearly impossible to know exactly what keywords were used with
SEO profiler we found at least 7:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/808601-pay-per-click-ads-help-this-houston-promoter-run-2-simultaneous-scams-part-1-chmr 7/18


The keyword selection should make any reader feel sick to their stomach. Picture a retiree
searching for "fixed interest savings" in this low yield environment only to be matched with
an advertisement for Chimera Energy. The retiree then proceeds to invest his/her savings
by purchasing shares of CHMR at $1.55 only to find the shares worthless several months
later. As we mentioned in the opener this is simply wrong and Google has to put an
end to it. They can no longer sit by while investors are being delivered to promoters like
sheep's to the slaughterhouse. Quality control must be employed before allowing anyone
to target investment related traffic. We recommend a simple rule requiring a firm to be
registered with the SEC as an investment advisory in order to recommend a security for
purchase.


While the majority of the PPC campaign was carried out via Google Adwords other websites like


Yahoo (YHOO) and Ask.com were also used by the promoters. These companies need to beef up


their quality control as well and refuse this type of business. In this screenshot we see text ads that


were displayed on other leading websites. These ads are still being displayed as of 8/13/2012.


The Smoking Gun


The smoking gun was discovered when we traced the IP Address of the server used to
host the website for Chimera Energy. Basically all web servers (which are nothing but
computers running software to serve web pages) are assigned unique IP addresses on
the Internet. If a web server is hosting a website, the IP address of that site will be the
same as that of the server. And if multiple domains are hosted on that web server they will
all have the same IP address which will again be the same as that of the web server.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/808601-pay-per-click-ads-help-this-houston-promoter-run-2-simultaneous-scams-part-1-chmr 8/18


Using CMD, we pinged the chimeraenergyusa.com website and found that the IP Address of the


web server was: 184.106.176.97


Next we used Bing to do an IP Search. The results are the websites being hosted on the
same web server as the IP address being entered:


A Coincidence? We think not. There are only 5 websites being hosted on this web server which


indicate that it's an exclusive server as opposed to a shared server with many independent sites. But


this one server hosts the sites of two publicly traded OTCBB companies: NVMN and CHMR, which


are both run out of virtual offices in Texas, started trading at or around the same time, and have had


the same type of display and keyword ads being plastered all over the internet.


As far as we are concerned the nail in the coffin in terms of connecting the promoters to
the companies is the fact that foxmarketreport.com and zerowaterfracking.com are both
hosted on the same servers as nova-mining.com and chimeraenergyusa.com. Fox Market
Report is a fake investment report website meant to appear as though it's related to the
Fox News Network. ZeroWaterFracking is a site used to refer investors to Chimera
Energy's main site. These sites act as conduits and refer even more traffic to each
respective company leading to more conversions (investors being duped into buying
shares). The promoters use these sites to monopolize the available space on the Google
Adwords system as one site can only take one spot. Two sites bidding the highest price
will take the top two spots. Two simultaneous scams with two referral sites will take up 4
spots meaning that every conversion results in a sale of worthless shares at artificial
prices.
