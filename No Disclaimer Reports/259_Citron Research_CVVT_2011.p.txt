CHINA VALVE
TECHNOLOGY
(NASDAQ:CVVT) —
DESTINED TO GET
DELISTED


You have to live under a rock not to know that there
is widespread fraud in the China RTO small cap
space.   There is no reason to even reiterate the
news coverage as the story has been �ogged over
and over.  There are, however, plenty of reasons to
look for the next company that will fall victim to
increased scrutiny.  Citron believes that this is an
easy one:  the case of China Valve Technology. 
(NASDAQ:CVVT)


Frazer Frost has become the poster child for bad
auditing of Chinese names.  They were just
sanctioned by the SEC for their lack of oversight of
China Energy

[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/33-
9166.pdf ] Frazer was also the auditor for the now
infamous, recently delisted RINO.  All of Frazer’s
clients have been forced to �nd new auditors,
which for the reasons described below, puts CVVT
in an untenable position — between a rock and a
hard auditor.

The fact that CVVT had one of the lowest corporate
governance scores (ranked 63rd out of 70
companies) on a recent Piper Ja�ray China
investment study and has had a revolving door of
CFO’s is not surprising in light of what we
discovered.  And worse, the company made three
acquisitions in 2009 and 2010, with some of the
most unimaginably bizarre disclosures we’ve ever
seen.


The company recently teased with news it was close
to �nalizing a “big 4” auditor – but hasn’t said which
one.  It is Citron’s opinion that there is no way the
company can pass an annual audit of any
reasonable professional scrutiny.  Citron believes
that the company will execute a secondary prior to
attempting to provide an audit for these
acquisitions.


Citron further predicts the company will get
delisted to the world of the pink sheets when it
inevitably fails to produce a credible audit of its
2010 acquisitions.


Case in Point


A year ago, if you asked “what’s the cleanest, best
disclosed example of a China RTO, the name
Tongxin (NASDAQ:TXIC) would invariably get props. 
This model truck body manufacturer with state-of-
the-art facilities was one of the �rst – and the
cleanest – reverse merger companies to list on
NASDAQ.  Yet, when the company hired a “big 4”
auditor to “get legit” in 2010, the auditor was unable
to produce the audit because of concerns over
related party participation in the acquisition
transaction.  When it failed to �le annual audited
�nancials, the company lost its listing, 85% of its
market cap, and now trades for 1.20 on the pink
sheets.


Our research reveals a picture of China Valve much
worse than TXIC — consistently misrepresenting
their business and more importantly their
acquisitions, which appear to be nothing more than
an instrument for insiders to extract money from
the company….so sit back relax and here we go….

Acquisition History of China Valves


China valves completed 3 major acquisitions in
2009 and 2010.


Able Delight – The Myth
The Company �rst reported its intention to acquire
the assets of Able Delight for 15 million USD on
January 12,.2010, a few weeks after closing a 22
million USD private placement.  The press release
described Able Delight as a leading producer of
valves. The transaction was completed on February
3rd, 2010.  In CVVT’s February 8-K, the assets
purchased in this transaction included 4.94 million
USD of Inventory and 10.11 million USD of PP&E.
….which seems simple enough.


But then something happened in November. 
Whether an SEC inquiry or pressure from the
auditors we don’t yet know, but the company
amended the 8-K and disclosed something closer to
the truth.


In the amended 8-K on November 18th, 2010, the
company reveals for the �rst time that Able Delight
was in fact a subsidiary of billion-dollar Watts Water
Technologies, (NYSE:WTS).  The SEC �lings of Watts
paint a very di�erent picture of the operating
pro�le of the company than described by CVVT. 
According to Watts’ 10-Q and 10-K, Able Delight
(Changsha) Valve lost 5.3 million USD in 2009. 
Worse, the subsidiary was under foreign corrupt
practices investigation and Watts shut it down as a
result of that.


However, under ownership of China Valves, we are
to believe an instant turnaround had happened. 
CVVT estimated the subsidiary to contribute 20.5
million USD of revenue, twice of the previously
reported revenue number by Watts, and 5 million
USD of net income, instantly turning around a 5.3
million USD loss in 2009….Good luck getting that
past an auditor.


Worse, we learn in the amended 8-K �led in
November that only 6.07 million USD was paid for
the “assets” of Able Delight to Watts (who �led that

they received 5 million) and an additional 8.93
million USD went to the owner of Able Delight,
purportedly for a list of other tangential expenses
listed as “(approx)’.  So who is this mystery owner
who received the bonanza?


Now this would get you “locked up” in the United
States: 
The November 8-K states the CVVT bought Able
Delight from a “third party” Qing Lu, and the
company lent Lu the money to buy the subsidiary. 
Yet what was not disclosed is that Qing Lu shares
the same residential address and co-owns the same
house as Bin Li, who’s the �rst cousin of Siping Fang
(Chairman of CVVT) and 34% owner of the
Company.


The address is 1165 Rugglestone Way — Check it
out yourself [http://www.city-data.com/fulton-
county/R/Rugglestone-Way-3.html [http://www.city-
data.com/fulton-county/R/Rugglestone-Way-3.html]


It is almost as if China Valve was trying to break a
record with how many securities laws can be
broken with a single transaction.  From misstating
ownership of a company, to an undisclosed related
party transaction, to in�ating revenue projections,
and lastly hiding the actual name of the business,
for this 4-in-1 disclosure failure … we tip our hats to
their management team!


The Acquisition of Hanwei Valves
In the asset acquisition of Hanwei Valves, we see
again that the Company did not do what it said in
its 8-K �led on April 9th, 2010. 
The “Asset Transfer Agreement” referenced in the
8-K �ling contains four parties:


Party A: Henan Tonghai Fluid
Equipment Co., Ltd.  (Subsid of China
Valve)
Party B: Shanghai Pudong Hanwei
Valve Co., Ltd.   (Acquired Company)
Party C: Shanghai Hanhuang Valve
Co., Ltd             (Owner of B)

Party D: Hong Kong Hanxi Investment
Co., Ltd.      (Owner of B)


In the Company’s 8-K �led on April 9th, 2010, it
clearly stated several points leading to the
conclusion that Party C and D, which owned Party B
(from which assets are acquired) are unrelated
parties.  But here is a document that tells us a
di�erent story. In another seemingly undisclosed
related party transaction, this document below
shows in fact that China Valve owned party C prior
to the acquisition.


Furthermore, the company presents this
transaction as an “asset sale” and goes as far as to
claim that Party C and Party D represent that the
tangible and intangible assets of Hanwei Valve
(including but not limited to land, buildings,
equipment and intellectual property) are not
subject to any collateral, pledge, lien or any third
party claims. Party C and Party D will take all
responsibilities arising out of any claims if the
representations are not accurate.  It further lays on
non-compete clauses…the whole 8-K can be read
here.

Yet we read as of today that CVVT did not in fact
buy just the assets but rather they bought the
whole company, which could easily include
undisclosed liabilities.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, when
you buy just the assets of a company, you do not
have to �le �nancials on the acquisition but when
you buy a full company, you are required to….so its
another auditing nightmare….good luck.  Below is
proof that China Valve now owns all parties B, C,
and D.


The Yangzhou Rock Acquisition
Yangzhou Rock was the smallest acquisition
transaction of the three, a mere 7.3 million USD.
Without diving into too many details, there are at
least two points of suspicion.


1.    Before even agreeing upon a price, China
Valves paid 6 million USD upfront for Yangzhou

Rock which simply makes no sense, unless of
course you had some “relationship” with the seller. 
2.    Like the other transactions, China Valves paid
for a mere 2.2 times PE for         Yangzhou Rock
which leads to the question:  Why would anyone
sell such a business for 2.2 times PE?


Unless of course the numbers are completely
�ctional as we saw in the example of Watts Water.


Through its own �lings and disclosure on the three
acquisitions it completed, China Valves has been
claiming an annualized 94 million USD revenue and
a blended gross margin of 43.4% on these three
acquisitions. They are simply too good to be true.
The words “too good” is not being used lightly here


Nothing about this company seems to make sense. 
·    They represent gross margins that are by far the
highest in a commoditized sector, yet they make no
investment for innovation:  their R&D Budget for
2010 is around $150K.


·    They compare themselves to Emerson, a
company 100 times larger, yet CVVT claims they
have twice the operating margins….good luck
explaining that to your new auditor.


·    They are able to buy a competitor at P/E of 2.


Who’s Minding the Store?
The SEC is currently wrestling an enormous and
intractable problem.  This entire wing of the market
has gone completely o� the regulatory rails. 
Disclosure failures that would result in immediate
stock halts and criminal actions are being
uncovered daily.


Yet, getting any jurisdiction for serious regulatory
e�orts in China is very problematic, even more so
with a holding company structure in yet a 3rd
jurisdiction, typical for China RTO’s.  (CVVT’s holding
company is in Hong Kong.)  Yet nothing of an
enforcement nature happens without the explicit
permission of the Chinese government.


So the SEC task force’s approach is to hold the US
counterparties accountable for these entities.

Before the analysts rush to defend these regulatory
quagmires, they are going to have to consider their
own vulnerability for being held accountable for
issuers’ practices that make such a joke of basic
disclosure rules.  A 2010 big 4 audit will not be as
easy to acquire as another no-name valves maker.


Conclusion:
This company needs substantial cash going forward
– which puts it in a cynical race between a
secondary and an audit.


Citron expects the secondary is going to win – and
there’s no safety valve for investors who are the
likely losers.  Consider the rush to close this
secondary in light of how di�cult it will be to
actually procure a real audit.  This is stu� that
would just never be permitted in US exchanges.


How sustainable is this picture?  Citron suspects it
ends with the color pink.
