GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH LLC 





Criteo SA (NASDAQ: CRTO):  


The True Fraudster in the Adtech Industry? 





 Gotham City Research was initially skeptical of the skeptics: how bad could Criteo be? 
 Aren’t all adtech vendors fleecing clients? Perhaps Criteo is the cleanest dirty shirt? 
 We tuned out other opinions, and conducted our own systematic analysis. 


The results surprised us. According to our analysis of websites using Criteo: 


 Over 50% of websites using Criteo are of suspect quality. 
 Criteos is NOT “just as bad” as its peers: Criteo is twice as bad. 
 This explains why Criteo refuses to disclose to clients where ads are placed. 





Criteo’s leadership responded to allegations of defrauding its customers, by taunting us on twitter: 





The above tweet was subsequently deleted. Criteo has not denied any specific claims found in the 
Method Media Intelligence Report, released last Friday. We infer that the MMI allegations are correct.

GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS: 


 Over 50% of Criteo’s revenues originate from suspect 
sources (e.g. clickbots, fake/low quality websites, etc). 


 Criteo takes credit for clients’ sales it did not contribute to, 
and in some cases, that never actually occurred. 


 Clients will leave or demand reimbursements from Criteo, 
due to brand safety & revenue misattribution concerns.  


 Sales & profits will decline because of Criteo’s behavior, 
leading to a 67%-77% decline in its share price.  


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OBSERVATIONS  


 49.9%-56.2% of Criteo ads seem to be displayed on 
suspect websites, per our analysis of 513,000+ websites. 


 28.7% of Criteos peers’ ads seem to be displayed on 
suspect websites, implying that Criteo is twice as bad. 


 963 malicious URLs/files have been detected/associated 
with Criteo domains/IP addresses. 


 400+ websites containing Criteo code may display content 
that violates Criteo’s Advertising Guidelines.  


 24%-33% of disclosed business partners/suppliers, have 
proven ties to click fraud, adware/malware/viruses, etc. 


 CRTO’s reported 2015 click through rate does not reconcile 
with the calculated product of its components. 


 A search for “Criteo malware” on the google search engine 
returns 326,000 search results. 


 Criteo’s business has barely changed since 2011 (95%-
100% of revenues is retargeting), yet CRTO presents itself 
differently every year (i.e. its business description). 


 Criteo’s revenue exposure to Apple was disclosed to be 
20% last week, not 8% as believed just weeks before. 


 A 5%-10% decline in Criteo revenue leads to a 29%-44% 
decline in net income, based on our calculations. 


 Apple, Facebook, Trade Desk, & Europe’s recent privacy 
enhancing initiatives seem harmful to business models 
that spy on users and stalk them wherever they browse.

Criteo is worse than its peers based on our study of its websites 


Criteo: the ”true fraudster in the Ad tech industry” or a better company than Google, Facebook, etc? 


On the one hand, Criteo, the ad targeting firm, portrays itself in investor presentations as a better 
company than Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba (though in a tiny footnote shown below, Criteo 
prefaces this claim with “based solely on Criteo’s qualitative assessment”)1: 





On the other hand, the Method Media Intelligence (“MMI”) report we released last week, details evidence 
that Criteo committed ad fraud against an actual and recent client2. The report seems to confirm what 
everyone else had long suspected – but couldn’t quite prove – about Criteo and its business practices.  


MMI is not alone in exposing Criteo: Harvard Business School Professor and ad fraud specialist, Ben 
Edelman, has been warning about Criteo since 20153 (note that Professor Edelman had warned about 
Blinkx plc, a notorious ad fraud company, for years before finally receiving vindication in 2014). One of 
Criteo’s direct competitors went as far as to call Criteo “the true fraudster in the Ad tech industry.”  4  


Who is correct? While the MMI report impressed us – parts of it reminded us of Ben Edelman’s Blinkx 
research – the report did not address the question of materiality: what percentage of Criteo’s 
domains/clicks/revenue are derived from suspect websites? In other words, what percentage of Criteo 
websites would its clients NOT want their ads displayed (recall, Criteo does not disclose where its ads are 
displayed, to its clients)? This is the central question, as Criteo charges its clients on a per click basis, 
without regard to the quality of the website or its traffic. The purpose of this first Gotham City Research 
report is to detail our systematic study of websites using Criteo, and its surprising results.
Page 6 of 19 
 


We believe Criteo is incentivized to drive fake traffic because more clicks = more revenue for Criteo 


How does Criteo get paid by its clients? What do they purchase from suppliers? Why is Criteo the only 
vendor amongst its peers paid on a click-based model?5 According to Shailin Dhar of Method Media 
Intelligence6: 


Since Criteo buys ad-space but sells clicks, buying on a CPM and selling on a CPC, this model 
naturally optimizes towards buying ads on sites with high click rates. Sites with relatively high 
CTR’s, however, are anomalous to normal web traffic patterns on the internet. 


Based on our investigation, the above description of Criteo’s business model appears to be correct. CRTO 
gets paid for clicks, so the company is incentivized to place ads on suspect sites, where fake traffic (and 
therefore fake clicks) are abundant. Criteo and its clients’ incentives seem misaligned: clients only want 
human clicks, whereas Criteo does not care, so long as clients are in the dark. So how bad is Criteo exactly?  


Over 54% of websites using Criteo are suspect – both currently and historically 


Gotham City Research evaluated several different service providers that collected and stored websites 
using Criteo (and their metadata). We found a database with information on nearly 1 million websites 
using Criteo and/or its peers’. According to our analysis, over 54% of the websites using Criteo are of 
suspect quality7: 





We detail our assumptions & approach underlying the study in the “What is a suspect website: our 
assumptions and methodology” section found in this report. 


We observed the following: 


 Over 50% of ‘live’ and historical websites using Criteo are suspect.  
 Clients would not pay to have their ads displayed on these websites, as these websites may pose 


reputational and brand safety concerns. 
 The data suggests that Criteo has failed to reduce its clients’ exposure to fake traffic and clicks. 





Is Criteo a beneficiary of ad fraud, perpetrator, or both? Criteo exhibits qualities of a repeat offender:  


“Criteo systematically buys adware injection inventory on the very sites where the advertisers 
already have reached the users on the advertiser’s own sites – I have caught this dozens of 
times for clients  each time Criteo apologizes – but each time they do it again” 8  


– Ben Edelman, Harvard Business School Professor

Over 50% of websites using Criteo are suspect versus 28% for its peers – Criteo is twice as bad 


The prevailing belief in the industry seems “everyone is doing it” – that is, all digital ad companies are 
benefitting from and/or committing ad fraud. Before conducting this systematic analysis, we thought so 
as well. To our surprise – the data indicates that Criteo is actually nearly twice as bad as its peers9: 





Observations: 


 Our results are within range of industry level estimates of ad fraud (our Criteo number is on the 
higher end of the range, whereas the peers’ average is in-within industry averages). See the 
“Industry estimates for fraudulent traffic: between 20% to 43%+” section for more information. 


 Our estimate of Criteo’s ad fraud exposure is similar to a competitor’s estimate. See “Criteo peer: 
54.8% of Criteo’s clicks have no attributable source” section for more information. 


 Criteo’s reliance on a click based model – a nonstandard practice vs its peers – may encourage 
the company to be more aggressive in attracting or being willfully ignorant of suspect traffic. 


 Criteo’s peers’ exposure to suspect websites is within a relatively tight 25%-33% range: 





”Criteo is the true fraudster in the Ad tech industry” 


Is the claim that Criteo is the “true fraudster” a fair claim? Is it backed by evidence? Let’s recap: 


 Over 50% of websites using Criteo are suspect versus 28% for its peers – Criteo is twice as bad. 
 Pattern of apologizing and repeating dubious business practices, as documented by Ben Edelman. 
 Meanwhile, Criteo makes sensationalistic claims about being better than Google, Facebook, etc. 
 Management seems more obsessed with intraday movements in its stock price than its clients10:

Clients can cut 50%+ spending on Criteo without hurting sales 


Criteo’s clients’ are not getting what they paid for (because they are not reaching humans) 


"Advertisers, and importantly their agencies, need to know where their advertising and their investments 
are actually going." – Jason Kint, President of Digital Content Next 


If over 50% of Criteo websites are of suspect quality, then its clients are not getting what they thought 
they were paying for. This means that they can reduce their spending on Criteo by over 50% without 
impacting their sales. Furthermore, we believe that clients could reduce their total spend to Criteo by well 
over 50%, if they were to only pay for the publishers/websites of their choosing. 


Gotham City Research is not making a mere theoretical claim: several large advertisers recently reduced 
digital ad spending by 40%-90% or more without negatively impacting sales. For example: 





Proctor and Gamble1 


 Proctor and Gamble’s digital ad spend dropped $140 million or 41% year-over-year, and sales still 
grew 2% over that same period, beating both analysts’ predictions and P&G’s competition. 


 P&G ran ads on 1,459 sites between January and May 2016, that number dropped to 978 sites in 
the same period in 2017 – a decline of 33% in sites featuring P&G ads year-over-year. 


 P&G ran ads on 712 of the same websites between 2016 and 2017, including Yahoo News, 
BuzzFeed and Reuters, among others. But it reduced spend on 560 of them, according to 
MediaRadar, a 79% drop in spending from 2016. 


 Proctor and Gamble has been vocal in demanding greater transparency from digital media 
suppliers. 


Unilever2 


 Unilever digital ad spend dropped 59% year-over-year between January and May of 2017 
compared with the same period a year ago. 


 Unilever is advertising on 11% fewer sites this year for a total of 540. For the sites where it ran 
ads during both time frames, it reduced spend by 57% on 155. 


 Unilever has been vocal in demanding greater transparency from digital media suppliers. 





% Reduction Impact 
ADVERTISER in Spend on sales


Proctor & Gamble -41% None
Unilever -59% None


Chase Bank -99% None
Restoration Hardware -100% None


Uber -100% None
Page 9 of 19 
 


Chase Bank3 


 Chase Bank had ads on 400,000 websites, and then reduced the number to just 5,000 sites.  No 
impact on sales. 


 Only 3% of the 400,000 sites led to activity beyond an impression.  
 Of the 3%, more than 50% were sites that Chase did not want to advertise on. 


Restoration Hardware4 


 Restoration Hardware found that 98% of its sales came from 22 out of 3,200 search words.  
 Of those 22 words, 21 words were misspellings of Restoration Hardware. 
 They cancelled spending on all 3,200 words. 


Uber5 


 Uber paid Fetch Media more than $82.5 million for its ad effort between 2015 and the first 
quarter of 2017. 


 When Uber suspended the mobile ad effort, they saw “no material drop in total installations” 
 Uber sued Fetch alleging ad fraud.  
 Uber says Fetch purchased nonexistent, nonviewable or fraudulent ads and concealed those 


facts from Uber. 


According to ad fraud expert Dr. Augustine Fou6: 


 “If you don’t have 100% measurement or very detailed reports…  you’re NOT getting what you 
paid for.” 


 “Ad Fraud diverts ad spend to fraudsters.” 


Of course, Criteo management prefers spending time heckling journalists rather than meeting the needs 
of its clients7:

Criteo peer: 54.8% of Criteo’s clicks have no attributable source 


One of Criteo’s direct competitors alleges that more than half of Criteo’s clicks are of suspect quality 


Through an extensive analysis of web logs consisting of more than 5.5 billion rows and 21 terabytes of 
data for 99 e-tail clients, one of Criteo’s direct competitors, Steelhouse, claimed the following1: 


 “More than half (54.8%) of Criteo’s clicks have no attributable source” which is “more than six 
times the industry average.” 


 Only 3.6% of Criteo’s “users” are responsible for 25% of its clicks. 
 “44.9% of Criteo’s apparent clicks are from users clicking the same advertisement within a 30-


minute period. 
 Additional comments: 





Criteo’s competitors’ claim that 54.8% of clicks have no attributable sources seems consistent with our 
finding that over 50% of websites using Criteo are suspect: 





Because Criteo’s peer made the above claims in the context of litigation, they should be considered with 
a healthy dose of skepticism. That being said, their findings, Gotham City Research’s findings, Method 
Media Intelligence’s findings, and industry level estimates – all align to similar estimates and conclusions.

Industry estimates for fraudulent traffic: between 20% to 43%+ 


External estimates validate Gotham City Research’s study of Criteo and its Peers 


Gotham City Research gathered recent industry estimates for ad fraud (as a percentage of total ad spend, 
or equivalent) and found them in line with our own calculations1:   





Observations: 


 The average of the industry estimates are close to our calculation of the percentage of suspect 
websites for Criteo’s peers 32% versus 29%: 








 Our estimate of over 50% suspect traffic for Criteo is higher than the industry average of 32%: 








 A 5%-10% decline in Criteo revenue leads to a 29%-44% decline in net income, based on Criteo’s 
operating leverage:2

Criteo is targeting less sophisticated clients & ARPU is declining 


Criteo is targeting less sophisticated clients because the bigger advertisers are catching on 
 


As we demonstrated earlier, the more seasoned advertisers are not only demanding greater transparency, 
but spending considerably less money on digital ad spend. We suspect that Criteo has and continues to 
struggle to attract and retain larger clients. Instead, it’s been focusing on less sophisticated, smaller 
companies, as validated by the decline in ARPU since 2014 (Average Revenue per User, i.e. Clients)1: 








Criteo’s SEC filings change in disclosures also points to targeting less sophisticated customers 


Since 2014 CRTO has been targeting less sophisticated customers, which they refer to as “midmarket 
customers”2:  


While we intend to grow our client base across all client segments, we expect midmarket 
customers to continue to increase their contribution in the mix of our total client base. 


 
In 2016 10-K CRTO explicitly stated that profitability could decline because of higher share of revenue 
from midmarket clients, which are less profitable than large clients:3 


2016 10-K:  
 
In addition, as our business expands, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability 
margin or to achieve our long-term profitability margin target. For example, our midmarket 
business is currently less profitable than our large client business, and, as a result, if the size of 
our midmarket business continues to grow as a proportion of our overall business, our 
profitability may be negatively affected. 


 -------------------- 
For example, the size of our midmarket business has grown significantly as a proportion of our 
overall business, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future. As our business shifts toward 
the midmarket segment, there are several additional risks to our business, including risks relating 
to the financial stability of our clients in the midmarket segment and our ability to collect from 
such clients. In addition, since our midmarket business is comprised of thousands of smaller 
clients which require significant resources to support, it is currently less profitable than our large 
client business.  


 -------------------- 
In addition, over time we have added an increasing number of midmarket clients that generate a 
lower revenue per client than large clients on average, and may continue to add a significant 
number of midmarket clients in the future. Therefore, there is not necessarily a direct correlation 
between a change in clients in a particular period and an increase or decrease in our revenue.

2014 20-F: 


We intend to continue growing our client base, both in the large client and the midmarket 
segments. During 2014, we invested significantly to capture the midmarket opportunity and 
intend to continue investing in this promising market segment.  
 
2015 10-K: 
 
We intend to continue growing our client base, both in the large client and the midmarket 
segments. During 2014 and 2015, we invested significantly to capture the midmarket 
opportunity and intend to continue investing in this promising market segment. In particular, we 
plan to expand our midmarket presence in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or 
EMEA, and Japan, as well as to launch midmarket operations in new geographies, including in 
South-East Asia and China. 
------------------- 
This growth in the number of clients using our solution has been driven by a number of factors, 
including our global footprint expansion, our continued development of large clients in the retail, 
travel and classifieds industry verticals, our strong commercial success with midmarket clients 
and our penetration into new industry verticals. We believe that our ability to increase the 
number of clients using our solution is a leading indicator of our ability to grow revenue over 
time. We expect to continue to focus our attention and investment on further growing our client 
base across all regions and client segments. While we intend to grow our client base across all 
client segments, we expect midmarket customers to continue to increase their contribution in the 
mix of our total client base.

Criteo has not disputed the claims found in the MMI Report 


Criteo has offered no response to any of the detailed allegations made by Method Media Intelligence 


Last week, we released Method Media Intelligence’s Criteo Report, which claimed1: 





Criteo has declined to directly address these criticisms. Perhaps this is because the company claimed last 
year2:  


“We make money only when our clients do, because our business model is fully aligned to 
driving their sales.” 


Criteo’s claim is clearly falsified by the Method Media Intelligence Report, as the retailer described in 
the report did not make money at all from the Criteo campaign.
Page 15 of 19 
 


When Which-50 asked Criteo about the above claims, they responded with the following meaningless 
response to Which-503: 


 “Whilst Criteo does not comment on individual cases, we would like to reaffirm that Criteo’s 
goal has always been to serve as a trusted partner and ensure a high quality, brand-safe 
environment for our community of more than 15,000 advertising clients. When advertising 
with Criteo, brand safety covers both the appropriateness of the site content and the integrity of 
the traffic the site generates. We are committed to detecting and combating fraud in digital 
marketing through numerous internal and external prevention methods.  


Our proprietary targeting and bidding engine has built-in detection of signals that indicate 
non-human activity. We have a dedicated operations team who constantly monitors the 
extensive reporting from our systems to pick up suspicious click activity which could indicate 
fraud. When such activity is uncovered we immediately reimburse affected clients. Criteo also 
employs a robust blacklist process to enforce our brand safety guidelines. Our publisher 
account teams regularly review advertiser performance metrics on publisher sites to spot 
suspicious trends, and terminate any sites that may be generating invalid 
traffic. Criteo continuously enhances its protection by adding any new fraudulent agents or 
suspect behaviour types to our detection tools. In addition, we are a member of TAG 
(Trustworthy Accountability Group) and work with leading third-party vendors to assess any 
additional protection they can offer to our own tools and processes to prevent fraud and non-
human traffic.”

What is a suspect website: our assumptions and methodology 


Real websites visited by real people tend to be recognizable 


How is one to define what a suspect website is? For the purposes of our study, we defined a suspect 
website as a website with an extremely high likelihood or certainty of fake traffic. Fake traffic means non-
human traffic. We mean websites that seem to be ”fraud sites” as shown below1: 





Filmvilag.org is an excellent example of highly trafficked fake Criteo website, full of only ads2:
Page 17 of 19 
 


Our Approach 


Given that we have defined and given an example of a ‘suspect website’, how then does one systematically 
determine what is and what is not a “suspect website”? After manually looking through many Criteo 
website, we determined that fake websites tend to have little to no information about themselves – like 
a filmvilag shown on the prior page. So we created a simple 17 factor model that only showed us Criteo 
websites with exactly zero out of the 17 factors, from the following categories3:  





Specifically, websites lacking all the following markers: 


 Social media presence   
 Contact information  
 Hiring/Employer information  
 Names of people tied to the website 
 Multimedia  
 Geographic information  


Comments: 


 We applied the same assumptions and methodology to Criteo as we did to its peers. 
 We used all available data for Criteo and its peers (e.g. 6 years’ of criteo data) 
 We assumed that if x% of websites are suspect, then x% of clicks are suspect, for all x. Same 


applies to revenue, as Criteo revenues are click based. This may be conservative, as there is 
evidence to suggest that click clustering, browser hijacking, etc. lead to nonlinear effects.  


 The sample size seems sufficient given that the peers’ exposure to suspect websites is within 
a relatively tight 25%-33% range. 


Observations:  


 Criteo appears closely linked to publishers that promote the spread of known malware. 
 Criteo links to and places ads on publisher sites that have millions of non-human visits. 
 Criteo links to and displays clients’ ads on publisher sites that contain content that appear to 


violate its own advertising guidelines.
