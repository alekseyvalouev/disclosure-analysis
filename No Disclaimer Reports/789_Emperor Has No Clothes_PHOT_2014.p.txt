Summary


PHOT shares are highly likely to be down 60-90% when trading resumes; with the
potential for a permanent drop..


There has been a variety of questionable insider share sales in the past few weeks..


Two members of management received compensation which represented ~24% of
2013 revenues, despite the company’s profitability deteriorating year-over-year..


One director has resigned from the board..


FINRA had previously warned investors about scams in the marijuana space; PHOT
is the fifth marijuana stock to be halted this year..


Summary


The purpose of this post is to set out relevant facts that should be considered in advance
of the Growlife Inc's (OTC:OTCQB:PHOT) resumption of trading on Apr 24, 2014. On Apr
10, 2014, PHOT was halted by the SEC for two weeks as a result of "questions that
have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of information in the
marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in PHOT's common stock".
This is only 15 days after Advanced Cannabis Solutions (OTC:OTCQB:CANN) was halted
on Mar 27, 2014 "due to a lack of current and accurate information concerning the
securities of Advanced Cannabis". It is my view that PHOT may fall 60-90% when trading
resumes and thereafter. This post further highlights that given questions with its financials,
poor capital allocation decisions and lost partnerships - that PHOT has concerns above
and beyond the SEC halt. The halt simply foreshadows greater underlying business
issues.


This article is important in the context of PHOT but also in the context of the broader comp
space. Recall that FINRA warned investors about potential stock scams in the marijuana
space in January 2014. PHOT's underlying business issues will hurt the momentum that
has been rich for cannabis players over the past few months. Given the shareholder base
of PHOT, on resumption of trading, there may be a significant amount of retail investors

that will be turned off from the marijuana industry. Consider the impact on PHOT's comps
whom may also be negatively impacted: Terra Tech (OTC:OTCQX:TRTC), Greengro
Technologies Inc (OTC:OTCPK:GRNH), Full Circle Capital Corp (NASDAQ:FULL),
Medbox Inc (OTC:MDBX), Nuvilex Inc (OTC:NVLX) and Advanced Cannabis Solutions .


PHOT shares are expected to drop between 60% and 90% once trading resumes


There have been at least four halts since the beginning of March 2014 in the marijuana
industry which include Advanced Cannabis Solutions , Citadel EFT Inc (OTC:
OTC:CDFT), Petrotech Oil & Gas Inc (OTC:OTC:PTOG) and Aventura Equities Inc
(OTC:OTC:AVNE).


It appears that a drop of between 60% and 90% is likely on Friday. Although, it is my
view that shares will trade at a 90% discount to its last trading price. This is because
PHOT's halt was the result of potentially manipulative transactions which is above and
beyond the accuracy and adequacy issues that its peers (CDFT, PTOG and AVNE) were
halted for. CANN's trading resumption (that resulted in a 38% drop in share price) is not
as relevant given the softer language used by the SEC compared to CDFT, PTOG and
AVNE ("due to a lack of current and accurate information"). PHOT specifically
acknowledges a drop is likely with its response to the halt "If history is any guide, there is
likely to be a negative impact to GrowLife shares when trading is allowed to
resume".


These halts also hurt the potential of the industry and its players as aforementioned.


There are a variety of "potentially manipulative transactions" that the SEC may have
scrutinized


In the last few weeks, there have been many questionable moves made by PHOT and its
management. The company paid select directors in shares at a significant discount to
trading prices. Two members of management received compensation which represented
~24% of 2013 revenues. To top it all off, insiders sold material amounts of shares and
major partners have walked away from PHOT. These underlying business concerns not
only highlight the potential reason for the halt but also put into question the long-term
potential of PHOT.

5/19/2018 Growlife: Why It Got Halted And What You Need To Know Before Trading Resumes On Friday, April 25th - Growlife Inc. (OTCMKTS:PHO…

On March 31, 2014, in conjunction with the release of its 2013 10-k filing, directors (Tony
Ciabatonni, Eric Shevin, Alan Hammer and Jeff Giarraputo) were paid two million shares
at a price of $0.02 per share which constitutes a ~97% discount to the then trading price
(of $0.58). How was a valuation that is over 90% below trading value established? How
can the company continue to grant shares to insiders at the same price for over a year
with material changes in the market and trading value of the underlying equity?


Tony Ciabatonni (Director), Eric Shevin (Former Director), Alan Hammer (Director), and
Jeff Giarraputo (Director) were the recipients of 500,000 shares each. Prior to receiving
these shares, Tony and Jeff had only 72k shares each. I note that the majority have these
shares were granted at $0.02 per share.


There is also questionability with regards to compensation and the health of the
company's financials. How appropriate is it that the CEO (Sterling Scott) and CFO (John
Genesi, who was only appointed mid-year in July 2013) were paid compensation of $1.1
million when the company only had $4.9 million of sales? This implies that two members
of the company were compensated ~24% of total revenue alone. Moving on to the
financials, the company lost $21 million in 2013 which is ten times its loss from 2012. I
note that warrant expense (of $7.0 million) and interest expense (of $5.3 million) were
both individually greater than 2013 revenues. With the company's financials deteriorating,
this hardly seems like a company with good capital allocation decisions or sound
financials. It is my view that these concerns will lead to a long-term negative drag for
PHOT and its business.


With a valuation of over $430 million (based on 865.1 million fully diluted shares
outstanding - from its 2013 10k), PHOT trades at just under ~90x 2013 sales. This is just
one of the many reasons that I think that the drop in PHOT's price on April 24th will be
justified, SEC halt or not.


Within the PHOT 2013 10-k, the company highlighted that four insiders had not filed form
3's on a timely basis. In addition, 11 of 15 insiders had not filed form 4's on a timely basis.

Only a few days later on Apr 1, 2014, Eric Shevin (Director) resigned from the Board.
Perhaps he was waiting to receive these shares before he departed? His resignation also
afforded him the ability to liquidate his holdings without any requirement to file insider
transactions. A director exiting the business is often a sign of bigger problems at play
within the business.


On Apr 4, 2014, the president of the company Robert Hunt sold 1.8 million shares:

You can see that the move from 15.7 million shares he held to 13.8 million in the matter of
a day (highlighted in red).


Not surprising that the CEO, Sterling Scott, filed the sale of 5.7 million shares for his wife
(Wedam Elisabeth) on Apr 9, 2014. Along with the recent director resignation, the sales by
Robert Hunt (President) and Sterling Scott (NYSE:CEO) may be signs of little long-term
value in the business.


One of the key aspects of PHOT's future potential related to its agreement with CEN
Biotech and RXNB. CEN had been approved to build a medical marijuana growing facility
in Canada which could produce 1.3 million pounds of dried marijuana annually. It is noted
that CEN is a subsidiary of Creative Edge Nutrition (OTC:OTC:FITX). On Apr 11, 2014,
both CEN Biotech and RXNB rescinded all agreements and terminated their relationship
with PHOT further hampering Growlife's potential at becoming a seasoned marijuana
player. PHOT's potential partners (CEN Biotech and RXNB) obviously realized, that the
shares they were to receive in consideration for the transaction (over 500 million shares
were to be issued in total), would be close to worthless when PHOT's shares resume
trading. The loss of this deal is a hard blow for PHOT in the medium-term.


On Apr 21, 2014, if PHOT did not have enough issues on its plate, Tripp Levy PLLC
announced a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of PHOT securities between
Nov 14, 2013 and Apr 9, 2014.


Conclusion


Despite responding to "thousands of investor inquiries by phone and email arising from
the trading halt", PHOT did not respond to a draft version of this post.


Based on current information, PHOT is likely to trade at a fraction of its valuation in the
medium to long-term. In terms of its comps, they will also be hurt with a less euphoric
retail investor base.


With all this potential adverse activity in close proximity, an SEC halt is starting to make
sense and PHOT's long-term potential is seriously in question. What was PHOT's
response to the SEC halt? "The answer is that we simply do not know". My response is
that once trading resumes, it is highly likely that the stock is going down…big.
