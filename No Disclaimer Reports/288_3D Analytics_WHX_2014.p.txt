(Editors' Note: This article covers micro-cap stocks. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


Introduction:


It is easy to estimate the value of Whiting USA Trust I (NYSE:WHX), and we strongly
believe it currently should be trading at around $2.30. Investors shouldn't pay much
attention to current yield, because WHX will trend towards zero until the trust terminates
on or around March 31, 2015. Consequently, we assign a sell rating on the stock with a
$2.30 price target.


Overview:


1. We exposed Gyrodyne Co. of America Inc. (NASDAQ:GYRO) as grossly overvalued,
and GYRO has lost almost half its value in the past month.


2. Citron Research called attention to WHX and Great Northern Iron Ore Properties
(NYSE:GNI), both of which are trusts that will liquidate in mid-2015. GNI has fallen
about 68 percent this year, and we expect WHX to do the same.


3. We are 100-percent certain WHX will trend toward zero until the trust terminates on or
around March 31, 2015. We expect the remaining dividends to add up to $2.30.


4. We strongly believe WHX is worth $2.30 (conservatively) and is likely to lose half its
value in the coming days.

GYRO has fallen almost 50 percent in less than a month:


On Jan. 6, 2014, we wrote an article for Seeking Alpha on Gyrodyne Co. of America Inc.
and initiated a sell rating on the stock with a $5.70 price target. Prior to that article's
release, the stock closed on Jan. 3, 2014 at $10.79. Immediately following the article's
release, the stock plummeted to $6 in less than a month. WHX is similar to GYRO in that
both securities are within a trust and both are liquidating. Just as we were highly confident
in our prediction that GYRO would lose half its value, we believe WHX will do the same
when investors realize the degree to which it is overvalued.


GNI has fallen around 68 percent in 2014:


Citron Research is a company noted for identifying and exposing greatly overvalued
stocks. Citron published an article on its web site on Jan. 24, 2011 calling attention to the
gross overvaluation of WHX. The article blames the overvaluation on investors relying too
heavily on computer dividend screens and trading based on the high yield while forgetting,
ignoring or failing to understand the fact the trust has a finite lifespan. The article
concludes that WHX should be priced at a value more in line with the remaining
distributions of the trust.


On Dec. 28, 2010, Citron also published an article calling attention to the gross
overvaluation of GNI, a trust structurally similar to WHX that pays a high dividend with a
finite lifespan. GNI is set to terminate in April 2015 and, like WHX, was trading at a gross
overvaluation to the value of remaining distributions. In 2014, Great Northern Iron has
fallen about 68 percent, putting it much closer to the fair value of its remaining
distributions.

WHX and GNI will terminate around the same time. GNI recently plummeted to a level
much closer to fair value, and we feel WHX will be next.


About the trust:


WHX is a statutory trust created in October 2007. Immediately before the closing of the
IPO, Whiting will acquire interests in certain oil- and natural gas-producing properties
located primarily in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Permian Basin and Gulf Coast
regions of the U.S. The net-profits interest will entitle the trust to receive 90 percent of the
net proceeds from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural-gas liquids
attributable to the underlying properties until the time when 9.11 MMBOE have been
produced from the underlying properties and sold. This amount is the equivalent of 8.20
MMBOE with respect to the trust's right to receive 90 percent of the net proceeds from
such reserves pursuant to the net-profits interest. WHX will pay a quarterly dividend
consisting of quarterly cash receipts of net proceeds minus fees and administrative costs.
This dividend will be paid until said 9.11 MMBOE has been produced, then will wind up its
affairs and terminate with zero remaining assets.

Worth zero when trust terminates:


With 100-percent certainty, WHX will head toward a zero! According to its own press
release dated Feb. 7, 2014, WHX estimates the trust will terminate on March 31, 2015. It
has no other assets and minimal cash. Therefore, WHX's value should be based solely on
the remaining cash distributions, which are estimated in the next paragraph.


Estimated value of the trust:


On Nov. 7, 2013, WHX announced 6.86 MMBOE (84 percent) of the trust's total 8.20
MMBOE had been produced and sold. On Feb. 7, 2014, WHX announced 7.12 (87
percent) of the trust's total 8.20 MMBOE had been produced and sold by the end the
fourth quarterly payment period of 2013. Unit holders of record as of Feb. 19, 2014 will
receive a distribution of $.55712 per unit. That will leave only 1.18 MMBOE still to be
produced, and WHX expects that production to be met by March 31, 2015. Shortly
thereafter, the trust would terminate. Using the most recent volumes, average sales prices
and net profits, for every .01 MMBOE produced, unit holders will receive $.021428 in
dividends. WHX expects a decline rate of approximately 12.6 percent from 2014 through
March 31, 2015, during which time cash distributions to unit holders may decline at a rate
