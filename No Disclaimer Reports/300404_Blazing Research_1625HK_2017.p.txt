Summary 


In this research report, we will present substantial evidence 


showing that most of the framework sales contracts 


disclosed by Flying Mining Limited (“Flying Mining”) to be 


highly suspicious. The identity and source of wealth of its 


largest customer is doubtful and it is very likely that the 


largest customer is effectively controlled by Mr. Lin Hui. We 


conclude that Flying Mining is not suitable for listing in 


Hong Kong.  





1. Suspicious Framework Sales Contracts 


We found that out of the five Flying Mining’s customers, 


four of them have a revenue far smaller than their promised 


purchase amount from Flying Mining. These customers 


have a minimal operating scale that cannot possibly support 


the disclosed purchase amount from Flying Mining. Marble 


is not a rare commodity and the relevant purchase amount 


is not large, and there is no commercial rationale to promise 


purchasing marble from Flying Mining in next two years. 


These irregular transactions account for 82.0% and 82.5% of 


Flying Mining’s expected revenue in 2017 and 2018 


respectively. 





2. Suspicious Largest Customer’s Identity and Source of 


Wealth  


The largest customer of Flying Mining, Xiamen Hefeng, was 


just incorporated at the end of 2016. The two shareholders 


of Xiamen Hefeng do not have any other operating 


businesses and their source of wealth is doubtful. This 


largest customer promised to purchase a large amount of 


marble from Flying Mining shortly after incorporation, and 


the commercial rationale of such action is doubtful. We 


believe that Xiamen Hefeng is effectively controlled by Mr. 


Lin Hui and Mr. Huang Zhongyi instead, and its sole purpose 


is to fabricate revenue for Flying Mining.

3. Physical Inspection of Xiamen Hefeng’s Registered Address Shows Evidence of Deceiving Sponsor 


We have visited Xiamen Hefeng’s registered address twice in the week of Oct 16 and Oct 23 


respectively. When we visited the office the first time, we found that Xiamen Hefeng seems to 


have a normal operation. But when we visited again in second time, we found that the door plate 


of the office has already been changed to another company called Xiamen Jinzhiyu Trading 


Company and no one is at the office. Xiamen Jinzhiyu Trading Company has no relationships with 


Xiamen Hefeng, showing that Xiamen Hefeng just borrowed office from other to deceive sponsor. 





4. Physical Inspection of Mr. Huang Jinyuan’s Residential Address Shows a Poor Economic Condition  


We found that the residential address of Xiamen Hefeng’s controlling shareholder, Mr. Huang 


Jinyuan, to be No. *, Fengchuigu, Longfeng Cun, Shuitou Zhen from Huji System. We appointed 


third-party inspectors to visit the place and found that the house is in an extremely poor condition 


with broken parts everywhere and the stair to second floor is blocked. It indicates that the 


economic condition of Mr. Huang Jinyuan is poor and cannot possibly own a company that makes 


over a hundred million of purchases. 





5. Xiamen Hefeng Is Effectively Controlled by Mr. Lin Hui, Mr. Huang Zhongyi and Mr. Huang Jianfu 


We further found out that Xiamen Hefeng is actually an empty company and the effective 


manufacturing factory is Fujian Nanan City Zhongtai Stone Limited, which is owned by Mr. Huang 


Jianfu. Mr. Huang Jianfu has countless relationships with Mr. Huang Zhongyi and they hold Fujian 


Panxing Group Limited together. We further confirmed that Mr. Hunag Jinyuan is not the effective 


controller of Xiamen Hefeng and Xiamen Hefeng is just an empty company established by Mr. Lin 


Hui and Mr. Huang Zhongyi to deceive Hong Kong Exchange. 





6. Minimal Amount of Cash and Bank Balance 


Flying Mining’s amount of cash and bank balance is minimal every year. The cash and bank 


balance of it is merely RMB 140,000, RMB 39,000 and RMB 753,000 respectively at the end of 


2014-2016. It is hard to believe a company with such scale can be listed on Hong Kong Main 


Board. 





7. Valuation Increased Over 12 Times in Just One Year 


Mr. Lin Hui transferred 5% shares of Flying Mining to his friend at a consideration of mere RMB 


2.5 mn at the end of 2016, indicating the valuation of Flying Mining to be merely RMB 50 mn at 


that time, which is similar to Flying Mining’s total investment in Leishoushan Marble Mine. If Flying 


Mining is successfully listed, its valuation will be as high as HKD 0.78 bn. We cannot understand 


the rationale of Flying Mining’s valuation to increase over 12 times in just one year, and believe 


the aim of above transfer is to circumvent the lock-up period of controlling shareholder. 





Our report shows that most Flying Mining’s expected sales is highly suspicious, and the 


operation scale of its disclosed customers cannot possibly support the promised purchase 


amount from Flying Mining. Moreover, our physical inspection shows that Flying Mining 


deceived sponsor deliberately and Mr. Huang Jinyuan to have a poor financial condition. 


The identity and source of wealth of its largest customer is extremely doubtful. The aim of 


share transfer prior to IPO appears to be circumventing the lock-up period only. Due to 


these numerous issues, we believe that regulators should start investigation in Flying 


Mining and reconsider Flying Mining’s suitability of listing.

Introduction 





Flying Mining is a marble mining and processing company in China, and submitted its listing 


application twice in 2017 Mar and Sep respectively. The sponsor is Guotai Junan, and the expected 


listing date is 2017 Oct 31. However, as Flying Mining received queries from regulators regarding 


the content of our report, it cancelled its IPO plan and refunded all amount to investors. 





We have sent our investigation result regarding Flying Mining to Hong Kong Exchange and SFC 


in the afternoon of Oct 30, one day prior to the expected listing date of Flying Mining1. We are 


glad that Hong Kong Exchange and SFC acted promptly to suspend the IPO of Flying Ming. To 


avoid Hong Kong Exchange and SFC being blamed for the cancellation and to allow investors to 


understand more about Flying Mining, we are now publishing this research report. Due to time 


constraints, we have just completed all our investigation on Oct 29 and therefore the version we 


sent to regulators on Oct 30 only contains Part 1 to 5. We have been further polishing this report 


in last two weeks. Please refer to this finalized version when responding.

These are the introduction of Flying Mining. In this report, we will investigative Flying Mining from 


multiple angles to discover the truth of its business, including the authenticity of its customers, 


background of customers’ shareholders, authenticity of its financial statement etc. We have 


conducted in-depth investigation in its customers and concluded that its largest customer’s 


business and shareholder’s background to be highly suspicious. We therefore do not 


consider Flying Mining to be suitable for listing in Hong Kong. If Flying Mining relaunch its 


IPO plan in the future, we suggest investors to read this report before making any decisions.

1. Suspicious Framework Sales Contracts 





Flying Mining has no revenue from 2014 to 2016, and has recorded a revenue of RMB 10,676,000 


from 2017 Jan to Apr. It disclosed that it has entered 9 framework sales contracts with five 


customers. To verify the authenticity of Flying Mining’s business, we retrieved the SAIC & tax 


filings of these customers but found most of them to be highly irregular, casting doubts on the 


authenticity of Flying Mining’s expected sales.

Xiamen Hefeng Dimension Stone Company Limited (“Xiamen Hefeng”) 





Xiamen Hefeng promised to purchase 1,000 m3 of marble blocks, 50,000 m2 of marble slabs and 


9,000 m2 of shaped stones from Flying Mining in 2017, and 1,800 m3 of marble blocks, 70,000 m2 


of marble slabs and 18,000 m2 of shaped stones from Flying Mining in 2018. Using the middle 


price in the price range disclosed on Pg. 189 of Flying Mining’s prospectus, Xiamen Hefeng will 


contribute to RMB 39,810,000 and RMB 71,429,000 of Flying Mining’s revenue in 2017 and 2018 


respectively, and is the largest customer of Flying Mining in both 2017 and 2018, accounting for 


more than 40% of Flying Mining’s predicted revenue based on framework sales contracts. 





We have therefore retrieved the SAIC & tax filings of Xiamen Hefeng. We found that it was just 


incorporated on 2016 Sep 22, and has not yet started any operations. It only has two 


employees at the end of 2016. Moreover, we found that the identity and source of wealth 


of its two shareholders, Mr. Huang Jinyuan and Mr. Zeng Ming, to be highly doubtful. We 


do not understand how a company established by a suspicious businessman can promise to 


purchase over a hundred million of purchase just shortly after incorporation. We will explain 


this in details in Part 2 to 5. 





The balance sheet of Xiamen Hefeng shows that it only has RMB 282 thousand of total asset 


at the end of 2016, with a mere cash balance of RMB 78,604. We do not think that a company 


with such a minimal operation scale can possibly purchase RMB 39,810,000 and RMB 71,420,000 


of marble from Flying Mining in 2017 and 2018 respectively, and we strongly suspect that Xiamen 


Hefeng is effectively controlled by Mr. Lin Hui and Mr. Huang Zhongyi instead of Mr. Huang 


Jinyuan and Mr. Zeng Ming to fabricate revenue for Flying Mining.

Bizhong United (Hangzhou) Company Limited (“Bizhong United”) 





Bizhong United promised to purchase 50,000 m2 and 70,000 m2 of marble slabs from Flying Mining 


in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Using the middle price in the price range disclosed on Pg. 189 of 


Flying Mining’s prospectus, Bizhong United will contribute to RMB 12,250,000 and RMB 


17,150,000 of Flying Mining’s revenue in 2017 and 2018 respectively. We have also retrieved the 


SAIC & tax filings of Bizhong United, and found that its revenue has been dropping every year. 


Its revenue decreased from RMB 13.6 mn in 2013 to RMB 1.0 mn in 2016. It only has several 


employees with a minimal amount of total tax paid, and recorded a loss every year. We do 


not understand the rationale of promising to purchase RMB 30 mn of marble slabs from 


Flying Mining when its 2015 and 2016 revenue is only RMB 2.6 mn and RMB 1.0 mn 


respectively. We do not think that these sales framework contracts have any commercial 


substances. For simplicity, we are only showing 2015 and 2016 balance sheet of Bizhong United 


here.

Quanzhou Gaoqi Dimension Stone Company Limited (“Quanzhou Gaoqi”) 





Quanzhou Gaoqi promised to purchase 28,000 m2 and 90,000 m2 of marble slabs from Flying 


Mining in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Using the middle price in the price range disclosed on Pg. 


189 of Flying Mining’s prospectus, Quanzhou Gaoqi will contribute to RMB 6,860,000 and RMB 


22,050,000 of Flying Mining’s revenue in 2017 and 2018 respectively. We have also retrieved the 


SAIC & tax filings of Quanzhou Gaoqi, and found that Quanzhou Gaoqi has no operation from 


2013 to 2015, and only has a minimal revenue of RMB 5.59 mn in 2016 and an insignificant 


profit. It only has 12 employees as of the end of 2016. We are highly suspicious that how 


Quanzhou Gaoqi can promise to purchase an amount that is much higher than its current 


sales from Flying Mining. 





According to the framework sales contracts, Quanzhou Gaoqi needs to pay a liquidated damage 


if it fails to make the minimum purchase agreed in any year. We do not think that a normal 


company will agree to such term and purchase at an amount that is much larger than the current 


sales. We have also consulted industry expert, who pointed out that marble is not any rare 


commodities and the purchase amount of Quanzhou Gaoqi is insignificant, therefore it can 


find numerous sellers in the market easily without making such promise in advance. We do 


not think that these sales framework contracts have any commercial substances. For simplicity, we 


are only showing 2016 income statement of Quanzhou Gaoqi here.

Fujian Nanan Xiangtai Dimension Stone Company Limited (“Nanan Xiangtai”) 





Nanan Xiangtai promised to purchase 1,000 m3 of marble blocks and 50,000 m2 of marble slabs 


in 2017, and 1,800 m3 of marble blocks and 90,000 m2 of marble slabs in 2018 respectively. Using 


the middle price in the price range disclosed on Pg. 189 of Flying Mining’s prospectus, Nanan 


Xiangtai will contribute to RMB 16,500,000 and RMB 29,700,000 of Flying Mining’s revenue in 


2017 and 2018 respectively. We have also retrieved the SAIC & tax filings of Nanan Xiangtai, and 


found that its revenue is significantly lower than the disclosed figures in prospectus (which 


is above RMB 50 mn). Its revenue dropped from RMB 37.28 mn in 2013 to RMB 22.19 mn 


in 2015, indicating a deteriorating business. Similar to Quanzhou Gaoqi, we do not 


understand why Nanan Xiangtai has to promise to purchase an amount similar or higher 


than its current sales level when it can easily find other suppliers in the market. We do not 


think that these sales framework contracts have any commercial substances. We suspect that 


in order to persuade Hong Kong Exchange and sponsor that these framework sales contracts have 


commercial rationale, Flying Mining colluded with Nanan Xiangtai to claim that its revenue is 


higher than RMB 50 mn so as to be classified as a “large-sized company” in prospectus. But the 


reality is that Nanan Xiangtai’s revenue has never met RMB 50 mn. For simplicity, we are only 


showing 2014 to 2016 income statement of Nanan Xiangtai here.

Quanzhou Xinxing Dimension Stone Crafts Company Limited (“Quanzhou Xinxing”) 





Quanzhou Xinxing promised to purchase 1,000 m3 of marble blocks and 50,000 m2 of marble slabs 


in 2017, and 1,800 m3 of marble blocks and 90,000 m2 of marble slabs in 2018 respectively. Using 


the middle price in the price range disclosed on Pg. 189 of Flying Mining’s prospectus, Quanzhou 


Xinxing will contribute to RMB 16,500,000 and RMB 29,700,000 of Flying Mining’s revenue in 2017 


and 2018 respectively. We have also retrieved the SAIC & tax filings of Quanzhou Xinxing, and 


found that its revenue indeed is much larger than its promised purchase from Flying Mining. 


However, this is the only customer of Flying Mining that has a decent operating scale and 


the amount of revenue generated from Quanzhou Xinxing is also limited. It does not change 


our conclusion that the majority of these framework sales contracts are highly suspicious.

We have already conducted thorough analysis on the five customers of Flying Mining, and 


found that except Quanzhou Xinxing, all other sales are highly irregular and do not seems 


to have any commercial substance. Such irregular transaction accounts for 82.0% and 82.5% 


of Flying Mining’s expected revenue in 2017 and 2018 respectively. After excluding these 


irregular business, the remaining revenue of Flying Mining is minimal and cannot reach the 


standard of a company listed on Hong Kong’s Main Board. We hope that Hong Kong 


Exchange and SFC to reconsider Flying Mining’s suitability of listing. The revenue of RMB 


10,676,000 recorded by Flying Mining from 2017 Jan to Apr comes from Quanzhou Gaoqi, Nanan 


Xiangtai and Quanzhou Xinxing. We have already shown that the revenue from Quanzhou Gaoqi 


and Nanan Xiangtai to be highly irregular and we will not repeat here.

2. Suspicious Largest Customer’s Identity and Source of Wealth 





As stated in our first part, we found that the identity and source of wealth of Xiamen Hefeng’s two 


shareholders, Mr. Huang Jinyuan and Mr. Zeng Ming, to be highly doubtful. Mr. Huang Jinyuan 


owns 90% shares of Xiamen Hefeng. Using the ID No. of Mr. Huang Jinyuan, we found that the 


only company he holds besides Xiamen Hefeng is Xiamen Fuxin Trading Company (“Xiamen 


Fuxin”), of which he owns 90% shares. We have retrieved the SAIC filings of Xiamen Fuxin, and 


found that it was incorporated on 2014 June 23, with no business since incorporation and 


only has three employees. It shows that Mr. Huang Jinyuan, at the age of 60, does not have any 


profit-generating businesses. It is hard to believe that the first company with real business owned 


by Mr. Huang Jinyuan manage to promise purchase over RMB 100 mn of products from Flying 


Mining within a few months of incorporation.

Mr. Zeng Ming holds 10% shares of Xiamen Hefeng. Using the ID No. of Mr. Zeng Ming, we found 


that the only company he controls is Xiamen Fengzhi Trading Company (“Xiamen Fengzhi”). Mr. 


Zeng Ming holds 51% shares of Xiamen Fengzhi. We have also retrieved the SAIC filings of Xiamen 


Fengzhi, and found that it has a minimal revenue and has never paid any tax. It records a loss 


every year and has only few employees. The total asset of it is insignificant and its operating 


scale is minimal.

Besides Xiamen Fengzhi, Mr. Zeng Ming also holds 10% shares in Xiamen Lixinde Environmental 


Technology Engineering Company (“Xiamen Lixinde”). We have also retrieved the SAIC filings of 


Xiamen Lixinde, and found that its revenue is merely RMB 2 to 3 mn with a loss every year 


and its operating scale is much less than the promised purchase amount of Xiamen Hefeng.

We have already shown that the background of the two shareholders of Flying Mining’s largest 


customer, Xiamen Hefeng. It is obvious that the controlling shareholder of Xiamen Hefeng is 


merely a nominal shareholder and has no real businesses besides Xiamen Hefeng. It defies 


common sense that Xiamen Hefeng, which was established by Mr. Huang Jinyuan, can 


promise to purchase large amount of products from Flying Mining shortly after 


incorporation. The minority shareholder of Xiamen Hefeng, Mr. Zeng Ming, also has no other 


businesses with a decent operating scale. It further shows that the source of wealth of Xiamen 


Hefeng’s two shareholders to be highly suspicious. It leads us to suspect whether Mr. Huang 


Jinyuan and Mr. Zeng Ming merely hold shares on behalf of Mr. Lin Hui and Mr. Huang Zhongyi 


so as to persuade Hong Kong Exchange to grant listing approval.

3. Physical Inspection of Xiamen Hefeng’s Registered Address Shows Evidence of Deceiving 


Sponsor 





We appointed third-party investigators to visit the registered address of Xiamen Hefeng, Unit 


01A, 3/F, 2nd Building, Free Trade Phase Square, Xiangxing Fourth Road, Xiamen Free Trade Zone, 


Fujian in the week of Oct 16. We found that Xiamen Hefeng seems to have a normal 


operation and we believe sponsor should also have visited this office during due diligence.

To further confirm the authenticity of Xiamen Hefeng’s business, we appointed third-party 


investigator to visit Xiamen Hefeng’s registered address again in the week of Oct 23, and found 


that the door plate of Xiamen Hefeng has already been changed to another company called 


Xiamen Jinzhiyu Trading Company (“Xiamen Jinzhiyu”) with no one at the office. Xiamen 


Jinzhiyu is owned by Mr. Hong Zujia and Ms. Zhang Baoyun, and has no relationships with 


Mr. Huang Jinyuan. It shows that Xiamen Hefeng just borrowed the office from Xiamen 


Jinzhiyu so as to handle sponsor’s due diligence. Xiamen Hefeng actually does not have any 


real businesses.

4. Physical Inspection of Mr. Huang Jinyuan’s Residential Address Shows a Poor Economic 


Condition 





To further confirm on our conclusion in Part 2, we have retrieved the details of Mr. Huang Jinyuan 


from Fujian Huji System. We found that Mr. Huang Jinyuan and his family lives in No. *, Fengchuigu, 


Longfeng Cun, Shuitou Zhen, Nanan City, Fujian2. 





Exhibit 25: Photo of Mr. Huang Jinyuan 


 
Source: Huji System 





We have therefore appointed third-party investigator to visit No. *, Fengchuigu, Longfeng Cun, 


Shuitou Zhen. We found that the house is in an extremely poor condition with broken parts 


everywhere. The stair between first and second floor is blocked and the second floor is 


inaccessible. This indicates that the economic condition of Mr. Huang Jinyuan is poor and 


cannot possibly own a company that makes over a hundred million of purchases.

5. Xiamen Hefeng Is Effectively Controlled by Mr. Lin Hui, Mr. Huang Zhongyi and Mr. 


Huang Jianfu 





Our third-party investigators have further communicated with the employees of Xiamen Hefeng 


during physical inspection, and were informed that Xiamen Hefeng is actually an empty 


company and the effective manufacturing factory is Fujian Nanan City Zhongtai Stone 


Limited. The legal representative of Fujian Nanan City Zhongtai Stone Limited is Mr. Huang 


Jianfu and Mr. Huang Jianfu owns 95% of the company, with the remaining 5% owned by Mr. 


Xu Quanfu.  





After further investigation, we found that Mr. Huang Jianfu and Mr. Huang Zhongyi hold Fujian 


Panxing Group Limited together (Mr. Huang Zhongyi holds 95% shares and Mr. Huang Jianfu 


holds 5% shares), and has numerous overlapping roles in many companies, showing that they 


have a very close relationship: 





Exhibit 27: Companies in which Mr. Huang Jianfu and Mr. Huang Zhongyi have overlapping roles

As disclosed by prospectus, Mr. Lin Hui is also the shareholder of Xiamen Panxing Import and 


Export Trading Ltd., and has a close relationship with Mr. Huang Zhongyi. All the above evidence 


show that Mr. Huang Jinyuan is not the effective controller of Xiamen Hefeng, but just a nominal 


shareholder directed by Mr. Lin Hui, Mr. Huang Zhongyi and Mr. Huang Jianfu. This further 


confirms our conclusion: The source of wealth of Xiamen Hefeng’s two shareholders is highly 


doubtful, and it leads us to suspect that Mr. Huang Jinyuan and Mr. Zeng Ming are only 


nominal shareholder who hold shares on behalf of Mr. Lin Hui and Mr. Huang Zhongyi so 


as to persuade Hong Kong Exchange in granting listing approval.

6. Minimal Amount of Cash and Bank Balance 





Flying Mining’s amount of cash and bank balance is minimal every year. The cash and bank 


balance of it is merely RMB 140,000, RMB 39,000 and RMB 753,000 respectively at the end 


of 2014-2016. It is hard to believe a company with such scale can be listed on Hong Kong Main 


Board. We do not understand how Flying Mining can maintain its daily exploration work with such 


a minimal amount of cash and we think that it is abnormal in commercial sense. Although Flying 


Mining may largely depend on funds from Mr. Lin Hui, Mr. Lin Hui should at least deposit more 


funds in Flying Mining’s bank accounts for daily operations if it was a normal business.

7. Valuation Increased Over 12 Times in Just One Year 





It has brought to our attention that the Flying Mining acquired Leishoushan Marble Mine at a 


mere consideration of RMB 2.18 mn in 2012, and the capital expenditure in the marble mine from 


2014 to 2016 is merely RMB 46,037,000 (2014: RMB 31,198,00; 2015: RMB 10,645,000; 2016: RMB 


4,194,000; Please refer to the “Purchase of items of property, plant and equipment prospectus” of 


its consolidated statements of cash flows on Pg. I-9 of Flying Mining’s prospectus). Therefore, 


the total cost of the mine is less than RMB 50 mn. 





Exhibit 29: Disclosure on Acquisition of Leishoushan Marble Mine 


 
Source: Flying Mining’s prospectus Pg. 144 





On 2016 Nov 24 (within one year before Flying Mining’s expected listing date), Mr. Lai Ching Hsun, 


a friend of Mr. Lin Hui, acquired 5% shares of Flying Mining from Mr. Lin Hui at a consideration of 


RMB 2.5 mn, indicating that the valuation of Flying Mining is merely RMB 50 mn, similar to 


the total cost of the mine we mentioned above. 





Exhibit 30: Disclosure on Mr. Lin Hui transferring 5% shares to Mr. Lai Ching Hsun 


  
Source: Flying Mining’s prospectus Pg. 125 





However, if Flying Mining is listed with the offering price of HKD 0.5 per share according 


to the original plan, the market capitalization of Flying Mining is as high as HKD 0.78 bn 


(around RMB 0.67 bn), 12 times higher than the valuation of Flying Mining one year ago 


or the total investment cost. We cannot understand how the valuation of Flying Mining 



http://www.blazing-research.com/

mailto:blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch
Website: www.blazing-research.com / Email: blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch 


can increase over 12 times within just a year. We believe that Mr. Lin Hui sold 5% shares to 


Mr. Lai Ching Hsun with the sole purpose of circumventing lock-up period such that Mr. Lai 


Ching Hsun can quickly dispose his shares after listing. As Mr. Lai Ching Hsun’s shareholding 


after listing is lower than 5%, no disclosure of interests is required and therefore can hide 


this disposal from public. 





Flying Mining has once explained that the mine reserve was not confirmed at the time of transfer, 


and Mr. Lai Ching Hsun has to bear substantial risks due to the uncertain reserve, therefore the 


valuation is relatively low at that time. According to the prospectus, Flying Mining has already 


appointed Gansu Geological Team to conduct geological exploration in 2015 Nov and the 


geological exploration was finished in 2016 Mar. If Mr. Lai Ching Hsun has concerns over the 


uncertainty of mining reserve, why not wait for the completion of geological exploration to 


determine a fair consideration before entering into the agreement instead of entering into the 


agreement in 2016 Jan hastily, just two months before the completion of geological exploration? 


As the geological exploration had already been finished by half in 2016 Jan, is it really possible 


that Mr. Lin Hui knows nothing about the sudden substantial appreciation of his mine’s valuation 


and continued to enter into the agreement? Why does Mr. Lai Ching Hsun need eleven months 


till the preparation of Flying Mining’s IPO to pay a mere RMB 2.5 mn? Is the date of entering into 


the equity transfer agreement really 2016 Jan 8?

Valuation and Conclusion 





We have already presented detailed evidence showing that the majority of framework sales 


contracts disclosed by Flying Mining to be highly irregular and have no commercial substance. 


The identity and source of wealth of its largest customers’ controlling shareholders is highly 


doubtful. The office of Xiamen Hefeng becomes empty immediately after Flying Mining passing 


hearing, just like an end of a drama. It will definitely set a record if a four-year drama with a cost 


of less than RMB 50 mn (“capital expenditure” accounts for most of it) could yield a Hong Kong 


Main Board’s “shell”. 





Based on the large amount of evidence we presented, we do not consider Flying Mining to be 


suitable for listing in Hong Kong, and therefore no valuation is needed. 





We believe that sponsor has conducted physical inspection on Xiamen Hefeng during due 


diligence and visited its registered address, but did not know that Flying Mining restored the 


registered address and returned the office to Xiamen Jinzhiyu shortly after visiting. We suggest 


Guotai Junan to carefully consider whether it is suitable to continue act as the sponsor of Flying 


Mining after taking our report’s contents into consideration. If Guotai Junan believe that the 


relevant issues can be resolved, we hope Guotai Junan to state the due diligence done in details 


and to confirm explicitly on the accuracy of the response in supplemental prospectus, such that 


we can have further response. 





In preparing this report, we have engaged various third parties to assist us (including but not 


limited to site visits). These parties worked independently of each other and were unaware of the 


nature of the final report. 





To us, it is of utmost importance to protect our sources and those who have assisted us. We are

sensitive nature. The information has been encrypted and stored properly. If we feel the safety
