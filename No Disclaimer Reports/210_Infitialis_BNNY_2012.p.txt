Annie's: Overstuffed And Ready To Drop

by: Infitialis


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in financial markets in an
effort to identify bubbles before they implode. Investors in industries deemed popular or en
vogue by the general public have a propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the
manifestation of valuation bubbles of companies in those industries. As the great Charles
Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they
go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly two
hundred years later, these words are still relevant, as even nowadays men find it difficult
to act against the herd while the herd goes mad.


Infitialis: Track Record of Exposing Fraud or Folly is Unmatched


After our MLNX exposÃ© delivered >40% returns and successfully called the top on what
was becoming a cult stock and hedge fund hotel, readers encouraged us to focus our
considerable resources on identifying similar NASDAQ or NYSE listed equities. As a
result, we have spent the last two months examining thousands of equities in search for a
company that shared the same characteristics as MLNX: overly hyped, mathematically
irreconcilable in its valuation and exhibiting abnormal insider selling demonstrating a clear
misalignment with shareholders.


Introduction


In this report, we will present our short thesis on Annie's, Inc. (NYSE:BNNY). Founded in
1989 by a wife and husband team to produce natural macaroni and cheese dinners for
New England communes, Annie's, Inc. currently sells organic packaged foods, including
macaroni and cheese, snack crackers, and fruit snacks. Annie's balance sheet resembles
that of an OTCBB micro-cap, with less than $15 million in cash and only $42 million in
tangible equity, while its market valuation has been bid up to a shocking $740 million -
reflecting a ridiculous multiple of 123 times 2012 Free Cash Flow of $6 million. In

other words, shareholders purchasing today would have to wait over a century for the
company to earn the equivalent of its current market value. We believe Annie's is
materially overvalued and its stock will shortly trade in the $10-$15 range once investors
realize that everything about the company smells like a nasty bruksch.


Fundamentals


The Bunny Business


Operating in a simple industry and producing less than $7 million in revenue in 1999,
Annie's was acquired in 2002 by Solera Capital LLC ("Solera"), a New York City private
equity buy-out shop, at an effective cost of less than $6.00/share. In preparation for
Solera's exit from the business, Annie's became a public company this spring after Solera
turbocharged its revenue growth in an unsustainable fashion over the last few years.
Solera originally filed to offer 5.0 million shares of the Company with a $14-16/share
range, the road show price-talk was subsequently raised to $16-18/share, and finally
priced the IPO at $19.00/share. BNNY's stock proceeded to rise by 89% its first day of
trading, and is currently up 116% from its IPO pricing, making it one of 2012's hottest
IPOs. BNNY's lead book runner on the IPO was JPMorgan. As documented in this WSJ
article, Solera had a special relationship with JPMorgan with JPM even being a limited
partner investor in the Solera funds that own BNNY! This connection may explain why
BNNY was allowed to go public with such a tiny float and the fawning sell-side equity
research provided by the underwriters after the pricing.


Of the 5.75 million Annie's shares sold in the IPO on 03/29/12, only 0.95 million were
primary shares issued by Annie's; the rest were insiders happily selling out at an
effective price of $17.67/share after the underwriting discounts and commissions.
The IPO transaction was clearly designed as liquidity event for Solera as net of offering
fees and expenses. The Company raised only $11.1 million to pay the $1.3 million
termination fee associated with the existing Solera advisory services agreement and fund
its future growth. Solera sold 4.4 million shares for net proceeds of $78 million, adding to
its previously earned management fees and dividends of approximately $30.0 million from
the Company, which has resulted in the recoupment of more than 100% of its
cumulative investment in Annie's of ~$80.0 million.

Unlike the Annie's IPO pricing and trading experience, on Thursday, 10/25/12, the
WhiteWave Foods Company (NYSE:WWAV), the producer of the branded Silk soymilk
and other organic products, was spun off from Deans Foods (NYSE:DF) at $17/share
after an initial price talk of $14-16/share. However, while WhiteWave shares opened at
$19.00/share on the first day of trading, they quickly slipped below the IPO price, closed
the day at $16.75/share, and have generally traded below the IPO price since; as more
than 28.3 million shares traded on the IPO day, it appears JPMorgan, the IPO stabilization
agent, was quite active in the market attempting to support the share price on the first day
of trading. While WhiteWave's product portfolio has produced a similar growth trajectory
as Annie's due to the same secular trends and the company has a much more robust
corporate infrastructure and management team, WhiteWave is valued at approximately
12.5x forward EBITDA versus Annie's extremely rich 28.7x multiple. As WhiteWave is now
publicly valued by the equity market and provides investors with another pure-play
exposure to the organic and natural food trend, we strongly believe the relative valuation
gap between these two firms will quickly narrow with Annie's trading to the downside.


Insiders Don't Believe in the Bunny, So Why Should You?


Year to date, Solera and other Annie's insiders have dumped in excess of $200 million of
shares into the market, which is more than 1.3x the Company's 2012 revenue! This is
not a business being "built to last" in Jim Collins speak; it is being manipulated for insiders
to blast out of! First, on 07/27/12, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan, the lead book-running
managers in the Company's IPO, waived the original 180 day post-IPO lock-up restriction
for the Company's common stock held by certain Annie's insiders and shortly thereafter
earned an additional $5.9 million in underwriting fees on the secondary share sale. This
premature waiver allowed Solera and selected insiders to deluge an additional 3.2 million
shares on public investors as Solera further reduced their ownership stake in Annie's to
less than 38.3%. Critically, while Solera was prematurely reducing its stake in Annie's
before the expiration of the original lock-up agreement, the private equity firm was
simultaneously attempting to market a new ~$1bn fund, despite the relatively
unspectacular overall return profile of its precedent fund, based on its success with the
Annie's investment. At the current share price, Solera still has approximately $270 million
of unrealized gains waiting to be crystallized through its ownership of 6.5 million Annie's
shares. As we explained, the cost basis of these shares is now zero, as Solera has
already recouped its investment in Annie's.

Next, Ms. Ann E. Withey, the original founder of Annie's and the current "Inspirational
President" of the company, took advantage of the 07/31/12 lock-up waived secondary
offering to sell a whopping 42.8% of her remaining stake in the company for gross
proceeds of $3.3 million, which is a significant payday for a commune-dwelling organic
farmer!


Next, on 11/01/12, Ms. Sarah Bird, "Senior Vice President - Marketing and Chief Mom
Officer," Mr. Mark Mortimer, "Senior Vice President - Sales/Chief Customer Officer," and
Mr. Lawrence Waldman, "Senior Vice President - Supply Chain and Operations" sold
95.8%, 100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively, of their existing equity positions in Annie's at
prices of $40.57-41.09/share.


Finally, just three days ago on 11/06/12, Mr. Lawrence Waldman, exercised his 10,000
options with a strike at $8.88/share and immediately sold the shares for $40.10, netting a
profit of $312,200.


With Ms. Ann E. Withey and other critical members of Annie's management team even
more economically checked-out of the Company's operations and share price success, it
is difficult to believe Annie's will be able to further grow the organizational culture that has
monetized the "green" movement over the last few years.


Numerous Business Risks to Current Market Valuation


There are multiple reasons why Infitialis believes Annie's is highly overvalued. First,
Annie's future product growth is severely limited by the current organic sourcing capacity
constraints as it takes in excess of three years for new organic farming capacity to come
on-line and be certified; this physical supply constraint will likely constrain Annie's future
revenue and margin expansion ability. While the organic food supply chain may eventually
reach equilibrium with current demand, in the near term, this supply imbalance tilts the
competitive advantage to producers as opposed to manufacturers and presents significant
execution risk for the Company's management team.


Second, Annie's is only a couple of steps removed from its roots as a commune start-up
relative to most NYSE-listed businesses. For example, the NYSE recently threatened to
delist the Company for its failure to properly notify the NYSE and investors of its annual
shareholder meeting as required by the exchange regulations. In addition, the Company
has only 85 employees and only recently acquired an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system to institutionalize the business planning and internal controls. Annie's plans
to hire aggressively (including sales, marketing, operations and finance teams), which
significantly constrains any hopes for meaningful margin expansion due to increasing fixed

costs. Annie's operational growing pains and managerial mistakes will likely continue into
the future based on the limited track record of the management team and operating
history as a public company.


Third, Annie's plans to take full advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements and
regulations for an "Emerging Growth Company" under the recent U.S. Congress JOBS
Act. The reduced disclosure and governance requirements of the JOBS Act legislation is
an unproven and potentially significant risk for public investors as it severely reduces the
securities regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, Solera held in excess of
50% of Annie's voting power as of the record date of 2012 annual meeting of stockholders
and then subsequently reduced its economic interest in the company to approximately
38.3% with the secondary offering of shares before the original lock-up expiration. Based
on this track record of trampling upon the rights of public shareholders, it appears there is
a continued possibility for the significant divergence between the interests of Annie's
insiders and public investors.


Fourth, Annie's operates a "capital light" business model and has outsourced ALL of its
product manufacturing and inventory logistics; Annie's clearly discloses "we do not own
any real property" in the footnotes of its SEC filings. While this operations model has
allowed the Company to historically generate impressive ROIC metrics relative to its
publicly-traded packaged food comps, this makes the business extremely susceptible to
third-party shipment delays, excessive price fluctuations for inputs, and potential food
safety issues. For example, in the quarter ended 09/30/12, Annie's purportedly missed out
on approximately $1 million in purported incremental net revenue opportunities because of
production planning shortfalls with its contracted manufacturers. If Annie's is truly
producing a "premium" consumer product worthy of a lofty price-point relative to
competing products, it seems the business should require significant control and
supervision over the production process; Annie's current share price does not allow for
any operational disappointments.


Product Problems


Annie's stated mission is "to cultivate a healthier, happier world by spreading goodness
through nourishing foods, honest words and conduct that is considerate and forever kind
to the planet." However, the stereotypical "upper-income suburban moms" that pay
premium prices for the Company's products are starting to realize the Annie's packaged
foods are really not that nutritionally different from traditional mass-market packaged
foods. For example, please compare the nutritional label information for the food products
(available via hyperlink):

Annie s Mac & Cheese vs. Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Original
Annie s Cheddar Bunnies vs. Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Goldfish


Surprisingly, the products are almost identical in standardized nutritional content, with
Annie's actually slightly worse for consumers by several key metrics. For more than
double the price, "upper-income suburban moms" are paying up for an "organic," but not
necessarily healthy, food option. Before adding butter/milk, the Annie's Mac & Cheese has
24% of the recommended daily sodium (and assuming the average consumer only eats a
single 1-cup "serving," which is less than 40% of a single Annie's Mac & Cheese box). A
single serving of 50 Annie's Cheddar Bunnies have 6g of fat, vs. 5g of fat in a serving of
55 Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Goldfish. As the nutritional information between these
"traditional" and "organic" packaged foods is very similar and suggests to the
ingredients/recipes/formulas of the competing products are very homogenous. Thus,
investors should question if Annie's really has a sustainable competitive advantage in the
packaged foods market by essentially swapping traditional flour and dairy inputs for
organic inputs, placing a whimsical "Rabbit of Approval" bunny graphic on a standard
cardboard box, and marketing it as a significantly differentiated product on grocery
shelves.


Even more problematic for Annie's future growth prospects is the fact its premium product
pricing will limit future market share adoption of its products. In the current economic
environment, how many additional packaged food consumers are willing to pay a premium
of approximately 63% over the cost of comparable options for Annie's packaged food
products?


Annie's Premium Pricing Comparison to Traditional Packaged Foods 


Finally, despite a market perception otherwise, Annie's ability to transfer its premium
pricing strategy to additional products has been less than perfect. In the quarter ended
09/30/12, sales in the condiments and dressings category decreased 8.0% on a quarter-
over-quarter basis due to slowing customer demand and competitor pricing promotions.
Moreover, Annie's breakfast cereals line of products, launched with great fanfare in FY11,
was discontinued in FY12 after struggling to gain sales channel traction and failing to
"meet growth objectives."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/994821-annies-overstuffed-and-ready-to-drop 7/15


Valuation


In our view, Annie's is worth less than $20 per share (an aggressive 2.5x LTM sales, 17x
LTM EBITDA) to an acquirer. This valuation reflects over 1.5x revenue and 9.0x EBITDA
on an aggressive forecast for FY15, assuming uninterrupted high teens revenue growth as
well as 140bps of EBIT operating margin expansion to 15.0% from 13.4% in FY12.


While Annie's is continuing to grow, it is starting to show signs of its core products being
tapped out. After the DMD and GMCR situations, investors should be hyper-vigilant for
momentum-based growth stories as they start to exhibit signs of cracking. Annie's heavily
promoted its mac & cheese segment last year, so the Company's revenue growth has
decelerated this year and the management team seems to be pinning investors' hopes for
future growth more in the newly launched frozen pizza segment. However, the mass
marketing of frozen pizzas via Costco and Target seems even more of a stretch from
Annie's professed core competency of healthy organic food. If consumers truly want to eat
a healthy and sustainable diet, they would be better served sourcing fresh vegetables and
ingredients from their local farmers market, versus eating an Annie's frozen pizza, even if
it supposedly contains organic ingredients.


For a comparable acquisition valuation metric, Smart Balance recently acquired Udi's, a
gluten-free specialist that also produces frozen pizza, for approximately 1.7x revenue
($103.0 million net purchase price for $60.9 million in revenue). Moreover, Udi's doubled
sales in the fiscal year prior to its acquisition, so appears to be at least as juicy of a growth
story relative to Annie's LTM revenue of $141m. In addition, a valuation at 1.7x revenue
implies approximately $14/share for Annie's, which happens to directly correlate with the
initial IPO filing range. Also, Smart Balance (SMBL) recently bought Glutino for 1.2x
revenue, which would imply just a $10 stock price for Annie's. Smart Balance attracted a
13-D filing from Gabelli and has risen considerably, so although it is likely trading at a
"half-in-play" premium, the firm is currently valued at approximately 1.9x revenue (pro
forma for the recent Glutino and Udi's acquisitions). Even if Smart Balance's equity
valuation doubles from the current market price, and one utilizes an implied sales multiple
of 2.8x, a non-dilutive acquisition values Annie's at approximately $22/share.


As per the illustrative discounted cash flow valuation below, even utilizing the aggressive
growth assumptions of continued double-digit revenue extension, operating margin
expansion of ~140bps to 15.0% (significantly higher than its historical results and peers in
a highly competitive industry) and minimal CAPEX spend arrives at an intrinsic equity
value of less than half the current market valuation. Because of the disconnect between a
reasonable DCF valuation for the company and the current share price, sell-side equity

analysts seem to be justify their lofty share price targets based on Annie's being a "a
possible takeout candidate (per CNBC, etc.)" and the purported "scarcity value in the
shares" [whatever that actually means].


Illustrative DCF Valuation - Assuming Continued Double Digit Sales Growth &
Margin Expansion


Moreover, because of the highly competitive nature of the packaged food sector, operating
margins generally remain range-bound in the upper single-digits to low-teens. Packaged
food producers must fight tooth and nail for shelf space at groceries and there are low
barriers to entry to prevent other manufacturers from cloning successful products made by
their peers. It will likely be difficult for Annie's to materially increase its operating margin
due to supply constraints for organic inputs, the Company's outsourced production and
logistics operational model, and the continued entrance of new producers with similar
products.


Conclusion:


Annie's insiders have been willing sellers at $14-16/share (initial IPO filing price-talk),
$17.67/share (IPO price), and $37.39/share (net secondary offering price) reaping over
$200 million while leaving the actual business with only $15 million to operate. Put
differently, the amount sold by insiders in one just year equates to over 50 years worth of
free cash flow. The math is irreconcilable; as such, we strongly recommend Annie's public
