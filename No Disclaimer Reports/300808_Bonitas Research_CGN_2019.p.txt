“Snow cannot hide the dead child”  - Old Chinese Proverb 
 


We believe that Best World is a fraud and that its Chinese sales are a fraction of what was reported to shareholders.  





On March 19, 2019, Best World International Ltd. (BB: BEST __ SGX: CGN) (“Best World” or the “Company”) 


disclosed to its shareholders that it hired PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) to conduct a limited, one-year independent 


review of its 2018 China operations.  We think Best World management purposely focused PwC’s investigation solely 


on 2018 in an attempt to both divert attention from, and ultimately further conceal, previously reported fake sales and 


profits from its China operations.   





PRC Filings suggest that Best World fabricated at least S$ 31 million of its reported 2017 sales to its “one major 


customer” (“Changsha Best”), an entity Best World management secretly controlled and exclusively created to be 


Best World’s off-books China counterparty.  Excluding fabricated sales to Changsha Best, we calculate that Best 


World overstated its 2017 net profits by at least 130%. 





Since January 2019 we have communicated with 24 separate Best World China member representatives (“Member 


Rep(s)”) and have conducted field visits to 12 BWL Lifestyle Centers (~36% of Best World’s listed franchisee 


locations) to better understand Best World’s sales model.   





Our findings suggest there exists very little end user consumer demand for DR’s Secret skin care products in China.  


In addition, evidence suggests that since the February 18, 2019 Singapore Business Times article (the “BT Article”), 


online vendors on both JD.com and Taobao.com appear to have artificially inflated their online review counts and 


transaction history to give a false appearance of online sales activity.   





We found that 8 of the 12 BWL Lifestyle Centers we visited did not sell individual products to non-members.  Our 


investigators commented that employees at BWL Lifestyle Centers disclosed and acted as though they were not 


accustomed to interacting with walk-in customers.  We laugh at this, but we were told by on-site employees at one 


BWL Lifestyle Center that we were their very first walk-in customer despite their lifestyle center being open since 


October 2017! 





As reward for their fraudulent scheme, Best World’s founders (the “Dora’s”) exponentially accelerated their 


combined annual take home pay by 20x in five years, earning less than S$ 2 million in 2013 to receiving S$ 40+ 


million in cash in 2018!  In the three years since implementing the scheme, the Dora’s collectively took home S$ 85 


million in cash, while Best World exited 2018 with its trade and payables balance at an all-time high of S$ 95 million 


and its receivables touching all-time lows at S$ 5.2 million.    








We are short Best World stock and believe its stock price will go lower.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 


Since 2007, Best World had sold its DR’s Secret branded skin care products in Mainland China. In 2015, Best World 


amended its China operations and exponentially increased reported annual sales from S$ 20 million in 2015 to S$ 145 


million by 2018.  Its China sales were extremely profitable, expanding its net profit margins from 5.4% in 2014 to an 


industry-leading 27% in 2018.

Evidence suggests that the only reason Best World achieved such reported financial success was because a 


majority of its reported profits were fabricated! 





PRC filings suggest that Best World fabricated at least S$ 31 million of its reported 2017 sales which artificially 


inflated Best World’s 2017 net profits by 130%. Excluding Best World’s S$ 31 million in fabricated profits, Best 


World’s 2017 net income margin would have been 10.5%.  While still at the high end of its competitor group’s net 


income margins, we think S$ 31 million of fabricated sales in 2017 is an understatement and Best World’s actual 


margins are more consistent with those of its stated China direct selling competitors in the mid/high-single digits. 





As reward for their fraudulent scheme, Best World’s founders Dora Hoan and Doreen Tan (the “Dora’s”) 


exponentially accelerated their combined annual take home pay by 20x in five years, earning less than S$ 2 million in 


2013 to receiving S$ 40+ million in cash in 2018!1

In this report, we present our opinion that Best World is a fraud and highlight the evidence we relied upon to support 


our conclusions.  Clearly, we believe the Dora’s are liars and will not voluntarily disclose the truth.  We encourage all 


investors and regulators to replicate and confirm our findings to expedite the truth-gathering process.  We speculate 


that the ultimate outcome of PwC’s review will be a downward restatement of Best World’s historical financial 


performance.  





We are short Best World stock and believe its stock price will go lower.

BEST WORLD OVERSTATED 2017 PROFITS BY AT LEAST 130% 
 


We think Best World management purposely focused PwC’s investigation solely on 2018 in an attempt to both divert 


attention from, and ultimately further conceal, previously reported fake sales and profits from its China operations. 





Best World’s DR’s Secret China skin care products are made primarily in the USA and Korea and must be imported 


into China by a licensed entity.  While Best World disclosed that its “import agents” (known as “export agents” pre-


2018) were all independent third parties who would independently distribute Best World’s China skin care products 


to end consumers in China, Best World’s 2016 and 2017 annual reports discreetly disclosed the reliance of its China 


business on its relationship with “one major customer” without disclosing details of its arrangement or the identity of 


the counterparty.   





PRC filings suggest that Best World fabricated at least S$ 31 million of its reported 2017 sales to its claimed 


independent “one major customer”, Changsha Best Commodity Trading Co., Ltd. (长沙百世特威日用品贸易有限


公司) (“Changsha Best”), an entity we believe Best World management secretly controlled and exclusively created to 
be Best World’s off-books China counterparty.   





We believe we have correctly identified Best World’s historical “one major customer” as Changsha Best.  Calls to 


Changsha Best were met by Best World representatives.  Changsha Best’s offices displayed BWL signage and acted 


as a demo hosting location for Member Reps.  As icing on the cake, Changsha Best disgorged all of its retained 


earnings since inception to Best World upon termination of its business with Best World in 2018! Clearly not the 


actions of an independent third party. 





Pictures from multiple side labels of Best World’s China skin care product boxes listed Changsha Best as a General 


Agent and Best World as Manufacturer. 2

2 We called Changsha Best in February 2019 who confirmed that Changsha Best was historically listed as the General Agent and 


going forward Best World (China) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (全美世界(中国)药业有限公司) (“BWL China”) was expected to be 


the entitiy listed as the General Agent on Best World China skin care product boxes, which corroborates the Company’s disclosures 


about its 2018 transition to its self-defined Franchise model.

The contact number listed on Best World’s China skin care product package for Changsha Best was “0731-89703663”, 


the same number listed as Changsha Best’s SAIC office phone number “0731-89703663”.   





We called this number on February 22, 2019, and the initial welcome automated message said “Thank you for calling 


Best World…”.  After the initial welcome automated message, we spoke with a secretary and inquired about Changsha 


Best name on the side of DR’s Secret skin care product boxes.  A secretary confirmed that Changsha Best operated 


under a branch of BWL China,3 and that the name change on the side of newer released boxes from Changsha Best to 


BWL China will not have any effect on Member Rep services or product quality, it’s purely cosmetic.  To us, the facts 


suggest that Changsha Best employees think of themselves as BWL China employees and that Changsha Best 


employees did not experience any structural operational changes in 2018. 





We can understand why Changsha Best employees think they work for Best World.  Changsha Best’s online job 


postings disclosed itself as being a branch of Best World Singapore.  In another job posting, Changsha Best was 


described as the predecessor of BWL China’s Hunan Branch.  In the third job posting, Changsha Best introduced itself 


as a Sino-foreign joint venture primarily engaged in international trade, import & export of cosmetics and dietary 


supplements, and that its parent company was listed on the main board of a foreign stock exchange.

In March 2019 we visited Changsha Best’s current and previous office locations.  We could not find any employees 


of Changsha Best at either of its addresses.  





Changsha Best’s current registered address with the SAIC office was updated on August 1, 2018: 长沙市开福区中


山路 589号开福万达广场 C区 3号写字楼 3211.  Changsha Best’s current address is a 40 square meter premise 


with some desks and chairs. Judging by the office contents and the amount of flyers piled up on the floor, the office 


appeared to have little use.  We were told by the property management desk that Changsha Best did rent this place but 


they are not doing business here.

We then visited Changsha Best’s previous registered address: 长沙市开福区金泰路 199号湘江世纪城富湾国际 6


栋 1001室.  On the tenth floor of this office building we found three units.  Rooms 1001 and 1003 displayed BWL 


signage and appeared to have floorplan layouts to facilitate product demos and showcases.

The third room on the tenth floor was room 1002.  We found the unit empty and sealed with an official PRC State of 


Administration Court Order Banner draped over its handles dated February 28, 2019.  While we cannot say with 


certainty, we consider the possibility that all three of the 10th floor units were occupied by Changsha Best, and that  


room 1002 was the previous administrative office for Changsha Best while the other two units on the 10th floor were 


BWL demo showrooms.   





If Room 1002 was Changsha Best’s operations office, was Best World management forced to transition its business 


in 2018 because Changsha Best was operating illegally?

Best World’s 2017 Annual Report disclosed that it generated China skin care sales of S$ 53 million and S$ 106 million 


in 2016 and 2017, respectively, which matched what Best World disclosed to sell to its “one major customer.” 4

PRC Credit Reports disclosed that in 2016 Changsha Best’s total costs of good sold (“COGS”) amounted to S$ 52.5 


million, nearly identical to the S$ 53 million Best World generated from China skin care sales to its one major 


customer.  We think this evidence further corroborates that Changsha Best is the correct identity of Best World’s one 


major China customer in 2016 and 2017. 





While Changsha Best’s 2016 COGS matched Best World reported sales to its one major customer, PRC Credit Reports 


disclosed that Changsha Best’s 2017 total COGS were only S$ 85 million, ~S$ 20 million less than the S$ 106 million 


Best World reportedly generated from its one major customer in 2017.

PRC Credit Reports disclosed that not all of the raw materials Changsha Best purchased were imported skin care

Changsha Best’s 2017 skin care product imports of S$ 74.6 million included inventory shipped but not yet paid for.  


As of December 31, 2017, Changsha Best reported an inventory balance of RMB 165 million (S$ 33.7 million) and 


trade payables of RMB 167 million (S$ 34.2 million), suggesting that Changsha Best had not yet paid for its reported 


inventory and that we are significantly understating Best World’s fabricated 2017 sales to Changsha Best. 





As evidence of further collusion between related parties, upon termination of its relationship with Best World, 


Changsha Best paid 100% of its accumulated undistributed profits since inception to Best World in the form 


of trademark fees in 2018!    





 
Source: : Financial Statements And Related Announcement For the 9 months ended 30 September 2018 – p. 1 





Prior to its 2Q’2018 transition from its Export Model to Franchise Model, Changsha Best continued to import for a 


few months, selling its remaining inventory and final 1Q’18 shipments from Best World.  Best World disclosed its 


2018 export sales were S$ 10.9 million.  If we add Best World’s 2018 export sales of S$ 10.9 million to Changsha 


Best’s 2017 inventory balance of S$ 33.7 million, we calculate that Changsha Best sold a total of ~S$ 44.6 million of 


inventory before shutting down its operations in 2018.   





If we apply Changsha Best’s 2017 net income margin of 4% to its S$ 45 million of sold inventory, we estimate 


Changsha Best generated ~S$ 2.8 million in net profits in 2018, bringing Changsha Best’s 2Q’2018 undistributed 


profits balance to S$ 10.2 million.

MINIMAL SALES AT BWL LIFESTYLE CENTERS 
 


Best World disclosed to investors that it did not own or operate either online or offline stores in China, instead leaving 


end customer sales and services expenses to be paid by its independent third party Member Reps.  Our on-the-ground 


fieldwork in March 2019 revealed this is simply not true.  





Among the BWL Lifestyle Centers we visited, two addresses were listed on the SAIC website as branch companies 


of Best World (China) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (全美世界（中国）药业有限公司) (“BWL China”) which is a 


subsidiary of Best World.  At the BWL Chongqing Qianjiang Lifestyle Center (重庆市黔江区生活馆) we were told 


by employees that its store expenses were subsidized by Best World’s regional headquarters in Changsha. 





As non-members, we were not able to buy individually sold products at 8 of the 12 BWL Lifestyle Centers we visited.  


Our investigators commented that employees at BWL Lifestyle Centers disclosed and acted as though they were not 


accustomed to interacting with walk-in customers.  We laugh at this, but we were told by on-site employees at 


Dongguan Humen Xiaojie Jiao Community Lifestyle Center (东莞市虎门镇小捷滘社区生活馆) that we were their 
very first walk-in customer despite their being open since October 2017! 





We found that multiple locations were not street-accessible, instead located in secured high-rise office centers with 


some locations closed during posted open operating hours.5 Only at one BWL Lifestyle Center in Guangzhou over the 


course of one week in the second half of March 2019 did our fieldwork investigators witness one Member Rep 


exchange money for product.6  We found multiple BWL Lifestyle Centers were used to host Member Rep meetings 


or product demos as opposed to operating storefront retail shops promoting the sale of DR’s Secret skin care products.  





We found that Changsha Tianxin Lifestyle Center (长沙天心区生活馆) was closed from March 20, 2019 to March 


22, 2019 (three consecutive business days) despite its normal operating hours listed on Best World’s website.

Investigators found employees at Dongguan Humen Xiaojie Jiao Community Lifestyle Center (东莞市虎门镇小捷

Employees told our investigators that this had never happended before, and that customers order and pay for products 


through existing Member Reps, not through the store.  However, keen to not pass up a sale, the employee started to 


explain and suggest that our investigator become a Member Rep at an initial purchase of RMB20,000+ claiming 


significant possible upside for successful Member Reps.  Our investigator was told that Member Reps could make 


between RMB10,000 to RMB100,000 a month depending on time and commitment levels towards new Member Rep

FAKE CUSTOMER ACTIVITY AT ONLINE SALES CHANNELS 
 


Evidence suggests that since the February 18, 2019 Singapore Business Times article (the “BT Article”), online 


vendors on both JD.com and Taobao.com appear to have artificially inflated their online review counts and transaction 


history to give a false appearance of online sales activity.   





A search for “皙之密” (Chinese name of DR’s Secret) on JD.com on February 18, 2019 listed online vendors by 
product sales rank.  Using the customer review counts as a proxy for transaction history, the top 4 listed products by 


sales had between 0 and 10+ reviews.  








 
Source: Search “皙之密” at JD.com on February 18, 2019 





Our follow-up search on April 10, 2019 revealed each of the top 4 DR’s Secret best selling products had changed, and 


that review counts for the newly listed products suddenly spiked from a new vendor, DR’s Secret Youshangda 


(“Youshangda”), who accounted for the most reviewed product on the list.

18 


Of the 600+ product reviews Youshangda boasted as of April 10, 2019, its first positive review comment was made 


on February 19, 2019, THE DAY AFTER the BT Article was published!   Below we highlight Youshangda’s 


earliest reviews found on pages 73-76 which revealed sequential reviews from the same accounts.  To us, these patterns 


suggest Youshangda was directed by Best World management to purchase fake reviews immediately after the BT 


Article was published to artificially inflate online store review counts. 





 
Source: Search “皙之密” at JD.com on April 10, 2019 





We found similar evidence of artificially inflated review counts on Taobao.com.  On April 23, 2019, we analyzed 


reviews from the best seller from October 26, 2018 (the date of the oldest review that we can access) to April 23, 


2019, and calculated number of reviews made before and after the BT Article. Not only did we find repetitive/ 


sequential reviews from same accounts suggesting fake reviews are included in the activity count, but also calculated 


a 6x acceleration in the number of reviews generated after versus before the BT Article was published.

We believe it is no random coincidence that new online stores with fake reviews appeared as top-selling vendors on 


JD.com and Taobao.com within days after the BT Article was published.  To us, this evidence suggests that Best 


World instructed its Member Reps to post fake reviews and generate fake transactions on Member Rep online stores 


in order to artificially inflate DR’s Secret online usage and popularity.   





We are not surprised by the lack of end user consumer demand for DR’s Secret skin care products in China.  An 


analysis of comparable Chinese consumer options revealed that DR’s Secret is the second-highest-priced branded skin 


care products, second only to the extremely successful and iconic CHANEL.7  We calculate that on average, DR’s 


Secret skin care products are priced more than 100% higher than widely-available competing consumer skin care 


products.  
 








We ask, who pays for DR’s Secret’s expensive and overpriced skin care treatments in China?  We found the answer 


to be Member Reps that wanted to get rich.

SALES TO MEMBER REPS, NOT CONSUMERS 
 


In general, we believe direct selling schemes are attractive to individuals looking for potentially lucrative multi-


generational payout incentive structures to recruit new Member Reps regardless of the product being sold.  An existing 


Member Rep told us that Best World’s most successful China Member Rep in 2018 took home an astounding RMB 


20+ million from Best World’s payout structure. We were extremely intrigued.  





As of the date of this report, we had communicated with 24 Member Reps in both Mainland China and Taiwan who 


were either listed as contact persons for interested franchisee parties on Best World’s website or who advertised DR’s 


Secret skin care products online.   





A China Member Rep sent us the following graphic to describe pricing and sales incentive structure for Member Reps 


in Mainland China.   





 
Source: China Member Rep 





Correspondence with Member Reps confirmed that bonuses paid to senior Member Reps for signing up a new Member 


Rep (“BM-Level Member Rep”) equaled 25% of the BM-Level Member Rep’s initial purchase amount.  Below is a 


written note we received from a Fujian-based Member Rep describing the initial fee and future compensation from 


having their own Member Rep network.

While every scam is unique, we could describe Best World’s China operations using multiple sales model synonymns: 


direct selling, multi-level marketing, pyramid, export agent, franchisee… Below is a list of common characteristics 


we found while conducting our fieldwork.   





1. New Member Reps make a high minimum threshold pre-paid purchase to become a BM-Level Member Rep.  
2. The entry fee to become a BM-Level Member Rep is similar in Mainland China and Taiwan. In Taiwan, the 


initial entry level purchase for a BM-Level Member Rep was NT120,000 (equivalent to RMB26,000). In 


Mainland China, the typical entry purchase was RMB20,000+. 


3. There is a referral bonus scheme which allows Member Reps to get paid a portion of the fees paid from new 
Member Rep sign-ups. 


4. Member Reps increase status levels if successful at recruiting new Member Reps.  Higher levels equate to 
additional incentive fees.  


5. Higher Level Member Reps are encouraged to build out Member rep networks with commission fees ranging 
from 2% to 6% of sales from seven generations of Member Reps. 





While Best World disclosed to investors that its Taiwan business is different than its China business, we found many 


similarities between Best World’s Taiwan and China operations.  Below are images taken from a Taiwan Member 


Rep’s online blog used to explain Best World’s Taiwan Member Rep incentive payout structure to new member 


recruits. 





To become a VIP customer and enjoy VIP discount 


prices, one must purchase products worth 2,000 
internal credits, equivalent to approximately 


RMB4,000, or a products set, and submit her ID to 


the company’s system; to become a Member Rep, 


one must purchase products worth of 10,000 
internal credits, equivalent to over RMB20,000. 





After becoming a Member Rep, one will procure 


the products at the same price as VIP customers, but 
Member Reps can accumulate credits to receive 


cash rebates worth 15% to 25% of her procurement 


amount (under 2,000 credits: 15%; 2,000-4,999 


credits: 20%; above 5,000 credits: 25%). If a 
Member Rep has her own agents (subordinate 


Member Reps), she receives commission on the 


sales of seven generations of subordinate Member 


Reps and an additional system bonus of 3%, etc., 


level by level.

Julie (alias) is a successful Taiwan-based, GD-Level Member Rep who was directed by Best World management to 


expand her business into Mainland China.  Julie joined BWL Taiwan in 4Q’17 and was helping with training, 


recruitment and management of Best World’s Mainland China business. According to Julie, Best World has arranged 


for successful Taiwan Member Reps to travel to Mainland China in an attempt to implement the same Taiwan sales 


model in China.   





Mr. Wong (alias) is another successful Taiwan-based, SD-Level Member Rep who has been a Best World Member 


Rep in Taiwan for many years.  Mr. Wong regularly comes to Mainland China from Taiwan to host training sessions, 


conduct product demos and recruit China Member Reps at the request of Best World management in order to replicate 


its Taiwan direct selling sales model in Mainland China.   





Both Mr. Wong’s and Julie’s descriptions of the Mainland China sales model and payout incentive structure matched 


the previous image we received from a China Member Rep.  In our review, regulations allow for direct selling in both 


Mainland China and Taiwan as long as the Company operates with relevant licenses or registers with the appropriate 


authorities.  We note, as of the date of this report, Best World had not yet secured a license to conduct direct selling 


for its skin care products in China. 8 





When we asked a Member Rep about the legality of Best World’s China operation without a direct selling license, the 


Member Rep informed us that Best World’s China operation was legal and sent us a picture circulated by Best World 


management to ensure Member Reps of Best World’s compliance with all rules and regulations. 





What the Best World Member Rep failed to notice is that Dr. Dora is holding BWL China’s direct selling license 


awarded in 2016 for its wholesale health and supplements business.  This license DOES NOT give Best World the 


authority to operate a direct selling sales scheme for skin care products nationwide, only licensed to sell health and 


supplements in Hangzhou City.   








                                                 
8 Best World was granted a Mofcom franchisee license in April 2018, which means BWL China can sign up franchisees.  There 


are thousands of companies holding this license, including restaurant chains, hotels, healthcare chains, clothing brands, 


pharmaceutical stores, etc.  This still does not solve Best World’s non-existent direct selling license issue.

We think the evidence suggests that Best World management is willing to lie to its Member Reps about its legal 


compliance and authorization to conduct business in China.   





We hope that our report helps to alert PRC regulators that Best World appears to be operating direct selling sales 


practices in China without a license, a topic of multiple ongoing current investigations of other various sales model 


schemes, including “Quanjian Group (权健集团)”9, “Infinitus Group (无极限集团)”10 and “Hualin Group (华林集

As reward for their fraudulent scheme, Best World’s founders Dora Hoan and Doreen Tan (the “Dora’s”) 


exponentially accelerated their combined annual take home pay by 20x in five years, earning less than S$ 2 million in 


2013 to receiving S$ 40+ million in cash in 2018!12

In the three years since implementing the scheme, the Dora’s have collectively brought home S$ 85 million in cash 


while Best World exited 2018 with its trade and payables balance at an all-time high of S$ 95 million and its 


receivables touching all-time lows at S$ 5.2 million.

We believe a few implentations helped the Dora’s in their fradulent scheme: these include new accounting standards, 


a changed auditor, and family members installed as managers of Best World’s China business.  





Best World’s 2018 accounting policy change resulted in the netting of certain distribution and trade expenses from its 


China operations from revenues, making it more difficult for investors to isolate the performance of Best World’s 


China operations.  











 
Best World 2018 Financial Statements – p. 15 





In many cases, we see fraudsters buy credibility. When Best World changed its auditor to E&Y in 2017, E&Y collected 


S$ 398,100 in non-audit service fees, 10x higher than any other year since 2010.   We ask, is today’s going rate for 


the E&Y branded pig lipstick only ~ S$ 398,100?!?

It also helps to have family in management positions to help with whatever books were required for Best World’s 


auditors. We find it telling that the Dora’s never disclosed to have family members in key manager positions until 


March 2015, when two of Dora’s family members were promoted to signatory positions of its China skin care business.  





Why would the Dora’s finally decide to put 2 different family members in charge of management responsibilities for 


processing Best World’s China operations in March 2015?  We suspect these family members to be facilitators in the 


Dora’s’ financial scheme.

everyone else, are entitled to our opinions and to the right to express such opinions in a public forum. We believe that the publication of 


our opinions about the public companies we research is in the public interest.

and we have based them upon publicly available evidence, which we set out in our research report to support our opinions. We conducted 


research and analysis based on public information in a manner that any person could have done if they had been interested in doing so.

and do your own homework before making any investment decisions. We are prepared to support everything we say, if necessary, in a 


court of law.
