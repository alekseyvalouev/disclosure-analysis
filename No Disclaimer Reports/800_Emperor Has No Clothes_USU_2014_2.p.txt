USEC Inc. - Still Disconnected From Reality

Summary


USU’s stock continues to ignore fundamentals and retains an over 80% likely
decline in value within the next day, or week if not.


Post reorganization, with convertible note holders taking the lion share of value,
equity holders will be left with less than 5% of the reorganized equity.


With the confirmation hearing set for today, USU’s chapter 11 bankruptcy should be
completed in short order.


There has been no news to change the story or fundamentals in recent months.


Revisiting my thesis


USEC Inc. (USU) continues to trade well above intrinsic value. I started to follow the name
and laid out my thesis in early July here. At the time, the stock was up 250% on no news
and not much has changed since then. With this bankruptcy process all but tied up with
the confirmation hearing set for today, the majority of the share value will fall to
noteholders. In this case, noteholders are set to receive 79% of the new equity, previous
preferred equity holders will receive 16% and the remaining minor component of 5% will
fall to current equity (as announced in the definitive agreement in March 2014).


Based on the August 18, 2014 press release, with support from 99% of noteholders and
both preferred equity holders, the confirmation hearing should be a mere formality.


It is my view that the stock continues to trade significantly above fundamental valuation
and that USU's stock will fall over 80%. This checks out based on simple math that I
provide below.

This effectively says if the current bond pricing is an indication of the value of the
company, which implies that the new enterprise value will be $196 million ($530 million x
37 cents on the dollar). If the new bonds trade at 60 cents on the dollar, which I deem to
be low, that would leave $96 million of value for the entire amount of the new equity ($196
million less 60 cents multiplied by $200 million new bonds grossed up by 79% which is
what noteholders are scheduled to receive). If current equity holders will receive 5% of
this, that will leave them with an 81% loss on their current investment (they will receive 5%
of the $96 million divided by 4.9 million shares). Current equity holders will receive $0.97
per share.


Timeline | Bankruptcy completed in the next two weeks


The confirmation hearing is set for today at 1pm in Delaware. Confirmation is often
imminent after this point but can take up to a week or two. This is all aligned with
management guidance of a bankruptcy by the end of summer or by September 18, 2014.


Conclusion | Irrational


With bankruptcy expected to be all but sewn up by the time the $530 million bonds are
due on October 1, 2014, the drop in equity value is expected in short order. Please review
my first article on USU for additional details on the company and the situation.


USU's stock is set to fall over 80%.
