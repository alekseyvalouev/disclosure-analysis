CSKI’s Chinese Financial Statements Contradict
Revenues and Earnings in SEC Filings


Posted on August 6, 2009 by Asensio.com


Today a website, www.waldomushman.com, published financial


statements filed with the China State Administration for Industry


and Commerce (“SAIC”) by subsidiaries of China Sky One Medical,


Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI). The site provides the SAIC filings in English


and the original Chinese. The site also published credit reports from


third-party agencies on CSKI’s subsidiaries, suppliers, and


customers. The credit reports present financial information from


SAIC filings.


For all of the entities involved, the revenues and earnings do not


reconcile with the financial statements filed by CSKI with the U.S.


Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)


According to CSKI’s SEC filings, the company only obtains revenue


through its China-based subsidiaries. The Chinese SAIC statements


and the credit reports presented on the website show that none of


CSKI’s subsidiaries reports revenues and earnings comparable to


those in CSKI’s consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC.


CSKI reported consolidated revenue of $49 million for 2007 in its


Form 10-K. CSKI’s main operating subsidiary, Harbin Tian Di Ren


Medical Science and Technology Co. (“TDR”), should account for


most of CSKI’s revenue, according to the CSKI 10-K. However, TDR


only reported 2007 revenue of only 9 million RMB, or about $1.3


million, to the Chinese government.


While CSKI reported 2007 net income of $15 million, TDR’s SAIC


filing only shows net income of approximately 7,000 RMB, or about


$1,000 (one thousand dollars).


TDR has not yet filed its 2008 statements with the SAIC. However, a


credit report shows that TDR’s revenue in 2008 was 6.9 million

RMB, or about $1 million. TDR shows a net loss for 2008 of -770


thousand RMB, or about -$112 thousand. By contrast, CSKI reported


consolidated 2008 revenues of $91 million and net income of $28


million.


None of CSKI’s other subsidiaries can apparently account for the


discrepancy in revenue. One subsidiary, Harbin First Bio-


Engineering Co., Ltd., shows 2008 revenue of 1.7 million RMB, or


about $249 thousand.


Likewise, none of the primary customers and suppliers cited in


CSKI’s SEC filings shows revenues capable of supporting a business


generating $91 million per year in revenue. For instance, CSKI


claims that one customer, Shanxi Xintai, accounted for 15% of sales


in 2008, representing about $13 million. A credit report for Shanxi


Xintai shows only 24 million RMB in revenue for 2008, or about $3.6


million.


The website referenced was constructed, and the documents on it


were obtained, by an individual investor working independently of


asensio.com. The investor states on his website, “I have come to


believe that China Sky One Medical is actively committing fraud.”
