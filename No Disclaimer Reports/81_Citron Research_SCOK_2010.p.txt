SINOCOKING
(NASDAQ:SCOK) FOLLOW
THE MONEY!


It is no surprise that Citron Research is not a big fan
of Rodman & Renshaw. A few years back Citron had
an epic battle with Rodman when  they placed a
stong buy recommendation on a company called
Home Solutions of America (NASDAQ:HSOA) that
Citron called a complete fraud.


Flash forward a few years later and Home Solutions
is now delisted —  yes, trading at 0.0006,  Its
o�cers were indicted for accounting fraud, exactly
as Citron reported. .

Here You Go


Now they’re back with a new girl — an ugly duckling
Chinese coal deal with an utterly improbably rise
and ridiculously unsustainable run-up on the
premise that $6 PIPE investors (plus warrants at
$12) with a six-month lockup have a bought “great
deal”.  It’s like a horse race with a donkey where the
donkey is started with a one-lap lead.


Citron �nds it inconceivable that Rodman isn’t
required to do a little more due diligence on these
things, and suggests that readers do what Rodman
doesn’t:  follow the money.  
“SinoCoking’s President, Chief Executive O�cer and
Chairman, Mr. Jianhua Lv, does not hold any shares
of Top Favour, however, Mr. Lv has the right to

potentially acquire up to 51% of Top Favour. On July
6, 2009, Mr. Jianhua Lv transferred his shares of Top
Favour to Honour Express Limited, a British Virgin
Islands international business company which is
solely owned by Mr. Shaohua Tan, a Singapore
citizen. As a result of the share issuance and share
transfer, Top Favour (BVI) has 10,000 ordinary
shares outstanding, 51% of which is held by Honour
Express Limited.”


Meet the Puppetmaster


Mr. Shaohua Tan appears to be a penny stock
jockey with �lings in GHII, JGBO. and LTUS.  He
operates BVI holding companies out of Singapore
with names like “Top Favour” and “Honour
Express”. 


Looking at �lings to try to gain a sense of his track
record, we �nd:


JGBO : a thinly traded  Chinese pharma covered

Then there’s BOPH, purportedly a Chinese
pharmaceutical, “quote unavailable”…


Tan was appointed Director and “Leader” of
Genesis Technology Group (OTCBB:GTEC)  in 2005
which was rolled into JGBO (NOTE: It is NOT the
current NASDAQ:GTEC.)

[http://�ndarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200502/ai_n9


Despite years of wild promises of future wealth
from international deals, Citron notes that the most
tangible outcome of all this furious burst of
business is ….. a lawsuit.


Further, Mr. Tan is reportedly the operator of
Genesis Equity Partners, LLP which was organized,
according to announcements �led by a plainti�
attorney,


” In 2006, Genesis Technology Group, Inc.
(GTEC), China West, LLC and Joshua Tan, a
director of Genesis, formed GENESIS EQUITY
PARTNERS LLC (GEP), a Florida limited liability
company, for the purpose of completing
private-to- public reverse merger programs
for Chinese companies. GTEC owned 51%,
China West owned 25% and Tan owned 24%
of GEP.”


He’s now the subject of at least $13 million in
arbitration claims for failing to close and deliver on
equity transactions, and for diluting its partners by
500% share issuance.


The plainti�?  Capital Research Group which
operates stock tout-for-free-shares site

for fraud by the SEC

You Own What?


What is undisclosed is the real terms by which Mr.
Tan and Mr. Lv acquired their interest in these
Chinese coking plants, which is only disclosed to be
in the form of “contracts” stated above.  
From recent �lings, we see : 


The following excerpts taken from �lings describe
the twisted relationships that give rise to the
ownership in these Chinese assets.


“Top Favour’s relationships with Hongli
Group and its owners are governed by a
series of contractual arrangements, through
which Top Favour holds and exercises
ownership and management rights over the
Hongli Group.  Neither Top Favour nor
Hongyuan owns any direct equity interest in
Hongli Group.  According to a legal opinion
issued by PRC counsel to SinoCoking, the
contractual arrangements constitute valid
and binding obligations of the parties to such
agreements, and are enforceable and valid in
accordance with the laws of the PRC.”


“Pursuant to the operating agreement,
Hongyuan provides guidance and
instructions on each Hongli Group company’s
daily operations, �nancial management and
employment issues.  In addition, Hongyuan
agrees to guarantee the performance of each
Hongli Group company under any
agreements or arrangements relating to its
business arrangements with any third
party.  In return, the owners of Hongli Group
must designate Hongyuan’s candidates as
their representatives on each Hongli Group
company’s board of directors, and Hongyuan
has the right to appoint senior executives of
each Hongli Group company.  Additionally,
each Hongli Group company agrees to

pledge its accounts receivable and all of its
assets to Hongyuan. “


“Under the equity pledge agreement, the
owners of Hongli Group pledged all of their
equity interests in Hongli Group to Hongyuan
to guarantee each Hongli Group company’s
performance of its obligations under the
consulting services agreement.  If a Hongli
Group company or the owners breach their
respective contractual obligations,
Hongyuan, as pledgee, will be entitled to
certain rights, including, but not limited to,
the right to vote with, control and sell the
pledged equity interests.  The owners of
Hongli Group also agreed that upon
occurrence of any event of default,
Hongyuan shall be granted an exclusive,
irrevocable power of attorney to take actions
in the place and stead of the owners to carry
out the security provisions of the equity
pledge agreement, and take any action and
execute any instrument as required by
Hongyuan to accomplish the purposes of the
agreement.  The owners of Hongli Group
agreed not to dispose of the pledged equity
interests or take any actions that would
prejudice Hongyuan’s interest.  This
agreement will expire two years from the
ful�llment of Hongli Group’s obligations
under the consulting services agreement.”

To which Citron observes, if (and when) something
goes wrong, and investors seek legal recourse with
regard to the actual pro�tmaking hard assets  …
GOOD LUCK!

better position the company to raise capital
from outside sources. “


This disclosure, made with a straight face, in the
wake of record �nancing amounts �owing like
rivers out of Chinese banks the last year or two to
support every conceivable venture needing capital
… but somehow accessing the US capital markets
by reverse merger “better positions the company to
raise capital from outside sources.” 


Conclusion


Sharesleuth.com correctly points out that investors
should heed a red �ag when any company,
especially one in a heavily commoditized industry,
and extra-especially if its Chinese based, projects
gross margins that are out of line with all its
competitors.


Add to that an incomprehensible shell ownership
structure, threaded through privacy and tax havens,
and you’ve got a recipe for a predictable outcome.


Cautious investing to all.
