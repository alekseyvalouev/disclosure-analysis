ConforMIS: Expert Confirms Significant Product Defects, FDA Data Implies CFMS
Patients 32 Times More Likely to Experience Adverse Events, Under Oath Surgeon
Says CFMS Product "Unreasonably Dangerous"


Highlights


Two (2) CFMS product defects identi�ed by orthopedic expert, member of 35+ market leader implant
design teams, calls CFMS knee implant "something you would have seen in the 1960s"


Under oath, CFMS a�liated surgeon says CFMS product "an unreasonably dangerous knee implant"


FDA data: CFMS patients 32 times more likely to have an adverse event compared to market leader


Surgeon survey reveals little love for CFMS key product, suggests product seen as a marketing gimmick


5 recalls in 7 years, further evidence that perception of CFMS superior technology is a myth


"Patient Speci�c" promotion: former CFMS surgeon says CFMS products not superior to competitors


FDA loophole allowed CFMS products to launch without signi�cant data to support product claims, now
after almost 12 years of operations, CFMS still has zero de�nitive data


CFMS promoted as maker of “3D printed implants,” only o�ers metal implants, �ne print says CFMS has
never 3D printed metal implants


History of product defects, recalls suggest CFMS is not capable of successful implementation of Direct
Metal Laser Sintering ("DMLS")


“Fits the Patient Exactly” and “Fits Right Every Time” promotions are false claims, among many others


Government intervention by way of A�ordable Care Act (“ACA”), and centralized purchasing power of
Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) are forcing implant prices down


CFMS management forecasts losses in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, totaling another $145 million


CFMS could have �led bankruptcy in August 2015 if not for the July 2015 IPO


CEO structured self-dealing through acquisition (buried in SEC disclosures), IP licensing deal, and
continues to siphon cash from CFMS through ongoing revenue sharing


CEO has very little "skin in the game," chose not to exercise $1.10 stock warrant in April 2013


Recent IPO lockup expiration, 30.1 million shares $10.98 cost basis (23% discount to current price) now
freely tradeable, �oat increased 319% to 39.55 million


Price target: $ZERO

By Contributing Editor: Jay Thompson, with signi�cant support from contributing editors, the "Ortho Expert"
and the "DMLS Expert"
 
Ortho Expert
 
A medical device industry specialist who served on 35+ orthopedic implant design teams for market leaders,
including Zimmer and Stryker, over a 30+ year career.  Played signi�cant role in development of new
standards of care for the industry that resulted in 15+ signi�cant issued patents.  Holds advanced degrees in
multiple �elds including molecular physiology.  He currently advises surgeons throughout the U.S. on the
bene�ts, drawbacks and improvements possible as they relate to products o�ered by every major orthopedic
device manufacturer.  We believe his experience quali�es him as an expert in the �eld in which ConforMIS,
Inc. ("CFMS") operates, namely the total knee joint replacement market. He is una�liated with CFMS. He has
not conducted business with CFMS in the past and has no plans to do so in the future. The Ortho Expert is an
acquaintance of Mr. Thompson. SkyTides has agreed to compensate him in exchange for his expert opinions
as they relate to CFMS products and the relevant competition.
 
DMLS Expert
 
A medical sales senior executive with 16 years experience in the precision tooling and manufacturing sector,
specializing in Direct Metal Laser Sintering ("DMLS").  DMLS is the most advanced form of 3D printing with
metal materials that is available today.  In 2013, the DMLS Expert's employer was the �rst company in North
Amercia to launch a custom metal implant design and manufacturing platform using DMLS for sales to
medical device manufacturers.  In 2016, his employer anticipates commercial launches of DMLS printed
components for various U.S.-based major medical device manufacturers.  We believe his experience quali�es
him as an expert in the �eld in which CFMS operates, namely the total knee joint replacement market. He is
una�liated with CFMS. He has not conducted business with CFMS in the past.  The DMLS Expert is an
acquaintance of Mr. Thompson.  He will not be compensated in connection with this report.
 
ConforMIS Product Issues
 
1. Two (2) Signi�cant Product Defects De�nitively Identi�ed by Medical Device Expert
 
1)  ConforMIS, Inc.'s ("CFMS") primary product "cleared" by FDA under 510(k) process
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") allows for certain medical device product o�erings to
enter the U.S. market without undergoing clinical studies as long as the products are determined to be similar
or substantially equivalent to other products currently o�ered in the market.

It appears the FDA was convinced that CFMS' primary product, the iTotal, was substantially equivalent in
design to other products currently o�ered in the market.  The FDA cleared the iTotal in January, 2011.  The

iTotal G2, which CFMS describes as a more advanced device, was announced in October 2012.  A visual
comparison of the iTotal and products it directly competes with in the marketplace is below.  Note the
obvious di�erences in the design of the portion of the device that is plastic.  The iTotal is the only device in
the comparison below that has a cavity or open space in between the left and right side of the device (the
"First Product Defect").  In addition to that, the iTotal is designed to allow for signi�cant di�erences in the
height of the left and right side of the plastic portion of the device (the "Second Product Defect").

2.)  Product Liability Lawsuit and First Medical Device Expert
 
On October 21, 2014, a litigation was �led against CFMS by a patient who had previously undergone surgery
to replace her left and right knees with the iTotal device (the "Product Liability Lawsuit").  The Product Liability
Lawsuit claims that within less than a year of each iTotal being implanted, both devices had failed and the
patient was no longer able to walk.  The patient alleges CFMS sold total knee replacement devices, i.e. the

iTotal, that are defective.  The patient had her left and right knees replaced with the iTotal implants.  Her
negative experience with the iTotal is described in detail.
 


 
Source: www.schmidtlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/conformis-knee-lawsuit.pdf
 
The primary focus of the Product Liability Lawsuit against CFMS relates to a high number of adverse events
that were reported to the FDA between October 2012 and March 1, 2014 that involved one of two issues. 
 
1. Spacer dislodgment
2. Tibia tray loosing
 


 
The lawsuit focuses on the allegation that CFMS knew of the First Product Defect and the Second Product
Defect and looked to the FDA for approval to make minor modi�cations to the design of the iTotal rather than
informing the public of the signi�cant adverse events patients with the iTotal implant were encountering. 
 
According to the Ortho Expert:

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 6/48


If the public was made aware of the full extent of these product defects they would invariably result
in yet another recall.  Worse yet, the design changes would likely be signi�cant enough to require a
halt of all surgeries with the iTotal for approximately 6-18 months while signi�cant design changes
were made to the iTotal and the newly re-designed implant went through the 510(k) process yet again.
 
On August 14, 2015, a medical device expert, Albert H. Burstein, PhD, was identi�ed in court records as an
expert witness on the patient's side.

It appears Mr. Burstein may testify on behalf of the patient regarding the product defects we have outlined in
this report.  We anticipate Mr. Burstein will explain details as to why the First Product Defect and the Second
Product Defect caused the iTotal to fail in both of the patient's knees.  It appears Mr. Burstein has an
impressive track record.  He holds 13 patents for orthopedic devices and was the co-inventor of a highly
successful knee implant o�ered by Zimmer.
 
We believe Mr. Burstein may have been the �rst "orthopedic expert" who identi�ed signi�cant product
defects in CFMS' iTotal.  His �ndings have been "�led under seal" with the court thus far.  We hope the seal is

removed soon.  If so, we believe there will be two medical device experts, namely Mr. Burstein and the Ortho
Expert, who will verify the iTotal product defects.
 
We also noted Dr. Terry Clyburn, who is a CFMS a�liated surgeon and performed the surgeries for the
patient, had some damning statements to make about the iTotal during his recent deposition.  Two speci�c
quotes from his deposition were of particular interest to us.

We believe this litigation is moving forward, expert witness lists have been �led by both parties as of last
month.  A trial appears as though it will happen sometime soon.  We also believe more lawsuits against CFMS
are forthcoming.  It is just a matter of time. 
 
The Ortho Expert stated:
 
Even a poorly designed knee implant could function and not necessarily fail for a period of up to a few
years.
 
We note that the �rst signi�cant sales of CFMS devices appear to have occurred in 2012.  It is now 2016.  The
iTotal is a poorly designed knee implant.  We believe the iTotal devices that have been implanted over the
past four (4) years are going to begin to fail at an even higher rate as time moves on.
 
3.)  The Ortho Expert identi�es and explains two (2) product defects in detail, both existed upon the launch of
iTotal in 2011, and both still exist today
 
As a member of numerous Total Joint design teams and after careful analysis of the overall design of
the ConforMIS Knee System it is apparent that there are major concerns with the design of the tibial
insert of their design (i.e. First Product Defect).  In the Orthopedic Implant Industry it is the
responsibility of the manufacturing company to have a very high knowledge base and manufacturing
capability to provide biomechanically sound designs and appropriate uses of the acceptable materials
for the implant.  When examining the tibial insert(s) of the ConforMIS Knee it is apparent that the
inserts have a signi�cant design �aw that would make the tibial inserts prone to early wear,
deformation and the potential of disengagement from the tibial base plate. An example of this has led
to a law suit (which has been included in this report).  The manufacturer (and the engineering
department) should have access to signi�cant data bases about the properties of UHMPE (Ultra High
Molecular Polyethylene) derived from over 50 years of studies, testing and clinical usage.  It has been
determined (without question) that UHMPE does not take shear forces and will wear quicker when
put in shear.  In addition if multidirectional shear forces are introduced (as in the ConforMIS Knee) the
plastic will also deform.  All Total Knee Replacements go through �exion and extension along with
rotation (called the screw home mechanism) which puts signi�cant shear between the metal femoral
component and the plastic tibial insert.  One of the major design goals is to minimize the shear forces
at this articulating junction.  The design that ConforMIS uses on their Total Knees does not accomplish
this design goal. 
 
The point of this information is that deformation of the plastic leads to disarticulations of the plastic
from the tibial base plate (as with what happened to the patient in the lawsuit) leading to the need
for revision surgery.  However, as signi�cant if not more is the shear forces put on UHMPE lead to
creating particulate matter that has huge negative rami�cations on the patients bone.  The

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 8/48


particulate matter is perceived by the patients bone as a foreign body so the body wants to get rid of
it.  Since the body can't distinguish what it is the body responds by producing Macrophages
(Osteoblasts) which destroy bone.  This process is called Osteolysis (destruction of bone) and should
be avoided in all ways.  The fact that ConforMIS utilizes a tibial insert design that is bifurcated and of
odd heights (i.e. Second Product Defect) is extremely disturbing when these negative outcomes are
very documented in the literature.  One can only assume there are other motives for this design,
particularly with the lack of documentation from ConforMIS of clinical results of their implants and
technology. 
 
Some credit should be given to ConforMIS for addressing a clever way to match implant sizing and
alignment (a worthy endeavor) however, including major design �aws in the �nal implant that will be
implanted into a patient for decades really presents a lot of questions and scrutiny - not to mention
the probability of many more lawsuits. 
 
4.) Product defects identi�ed within this report are signi�cant and represent potential "company killers"
 
CFMS is very likely insured against product defect litigations such as the one described within this report. 
However, it appears quite clear to us that the management team at CFMS will do whatever is necessary to
avoid another product recall - which would theorectically involve 30,000+ implants, or every implant ever sold
by CFMS.  First, a recall that large may not be entirely covered by insurance and could actually impact CFMS'
�nances substantially.  Second, a recall related to these two product defects would very likely require a
complete redesign of the iTotal.  This would mean that all CFMS operations would be shut down.  All CFMS
surgeons would be required to use a competing device rather then the iTotal while the redesign of the iTotal
was begin completed.  CFMS would again need to go through FDA clearance of the new iTotal design.
 
An a�liate of SkyTides spoke with a surgeon who previously experimented with the iTotal (the "Former CFMS
Surgeon").  The Former CFMS Surgeon speci�cally addressed how he feels surgeons typically react to
problems with new technology.
 
Surgeons don't really keep trying a new thing to make it work.  One bad experience is enough to just
stop.
 
Surgeons are e�ectively an extension of CFMS.  If surgeons do not see CFMS products as credible, reliable
and safe products and agree to use CFMS products then CFMS will not survive.  As outlined below in the
"adverse events" and "surgeon survey" discussions, CFMS is experiencing a high rate of adverse events
indicating a poor safety pro�le, and is clearly failing to penetrate the market of U.S. orthopedic surgeons.  A
massive recall and complete re-design of the iTotal would probably be the �nal nail in the co�n.  CFMS would
not be able to recover.  CFMS described its reliance on its surgeons in its SEC �lings.
 


 
2. Comparative Study of FDA Adverse Events
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates companies in the medical device sector.  In
connection with the preparation of this report, we reviewed the adverse events data in the FDA's
Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience ("MAUDE") database.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 9/48


 
There are numerous disclaimers associated with this database but the premise behind our use of this data is
based on a claim made in the Product Liability Litigation, "the medical device industry believes that adverse
event reports received from both physicians and patients are a major, and important, source of safety
information."  We agree with this statement fully and believe this data is a valuable resource to determine the
safety pro�le of medical devices.
 
The iTotal is CFMS’ "best selling product."
 


 
We searched for adverse events reported to MAUDE that related to the iTotal, and each of the devices o�ered
by the top �ve market leaders that compete with the iTotal.  We used speci�c key words and a speci�c
strategy to obtain the most reasonable raw data from MAUDE that we could then use to analyze adverse
events encountered by patients who received an implant such as iTotal and other competing products.  Our
speci�c key word searches, overall search strategy and results, are outlined in Appendix A to this report.
 
We have summarized the results of our adverse events comparable study as follows.  The Ortho Expert
explained the key �ndings:
 
In the real world, a patient choosing to undergo a total knee replacement surgery with a CFMS iTotal
implant has a 1 in 6 (i.e. 16.7%) chance of experiencing an adverse event.  The chance of an adverse
event occuring when using any other product by the four (4) competitors listed below decreases to a
range of 0.5% to 3.8%.  Adverse events with the iTotal are 32 times more likely (i.e. 191/6 = 32) than
with Smith & Nephew total knee products.

3. Surgeon Survey Shows Little Love for CFMS Primary Product, Seen as Gimmick
 
We determined there were 28,047 U.S. orthopedic surgeons.  In January 2015, the American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons (“AAOS”) produced an annual census entitled “2014 Orthopedic Surgeon Census.”  The
AAOS stated that there were 28,047 orthopedic surgeons on record with the AAOS.
 


 
We conducted a survey of orthopedic surgeons identi�ed by CFMS on its website during December 2015 and
January 2016.  The results of our surgeon survey are summarized below.
 
►  CFMS a�liated surgeons totaled just 311 out of 28,047 (1%) of all U.S. orthopedic surgeons. A complete list
of all 311 surgeons and the call sheet we used for each call is provided as Appendix B to this report.  We
presumed any surgeon using CFMS products would be listed on the CFMS website with all of the other
surgeons.
 
►  We spoke with personnel at the o�ces of 102 of the 311 surgeons, only 70 of 102 (69%) surgeons were
said to actually use CFMS’ primary product, the iTotal.
 
►  Only 17 of the 102 (17%) personnel said the surgeons preferred iTotal.
 
►  None of the 102 (0%) personnel said the surgeons used iTotal exclusively.
 
We also considered other facts we recently uncovered and came to the following conclusions. 
 
►  The �rst successful iTotal surgery occurred in 2011. Management said it would “rede�ne the category.” 
The media said it was a “revolutionary surgery.”  The iTotal was designed for the total knee replacement
(“TKR”) market.  The global TKR market is estimated to be $7 billion annually.  CFMS recently projected its

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 11/48


revenue at $64-$66 million or <1% of the TKR market (i.e. $66M / $7B = <1%) for 2015.  Simply put, almost 5
years later, the iTotal has failed to signi�cantly penetrate the TKR market and is a failure. 
 
►  A product that less than 1% of U.S. orthopedic surgeons use, and has less than 1% TKR marketshare
represents a �y that CFMS’ well-entrenched $ billion competitors will swat away.
 
►  We considered the fact that surgeons appear to be touting CFMS 3D printing in the media.  We see this as
a likely example of surgeons using iTotal to di�erentiate their surgical practice.  We also believe many of
these surgeons are being directly compensated either directly by CFMS or indirectly for their promotional
activities.  However, of the surgeons we surveyed, who are a�liated with CFMS, if only 17% of them preferred
iTotal and none of them use it exclusively, then many of the CFMS a�liated surgeons may be using iTotal as a
gimmick to generate business with patients.  The Ortho Expert concurred with our �nding.  It seems very
possible that iTotal is seen as a gimmick and is actually no more compelling to surgeons than any of the other
products on the market.  The Former CFMS Surgeon agreed that the iTotal is not superior to other products.
 
►  When we spoke with personnel at the o�ce of the most prominent CFMS key opinion leader, Dr. Gregory
Martin (the “KOL”), we were told he does not use iTotal exclusively for TKR surgery.  We were told the KOL
“also uses Depuy.”  We noted in a video interview and written transcript at www.conformis.com that the KOL
does not address his use of a product that directly competes with CFMS.  Why doesn’t the KOL use iTotal
exclusively?
 
Detailed results of our survey:

4. 5 Recalls in 7 Years
 
We reviewed the various recalls by CFMS.  We noted that there have been 5 recalls in 6 years.  CFMS had
recalls 1, 2 and 3 in 2009, 1 recall in 2012 and 1 recall in 2015.  CFMS’s CEO, Dr. Lang, has downplayed the
impact of recalls.  However, the reality is that CFMS has exhibited a pattern of ongoing poor execution. 
Ultimately, any suggestion that poor results, recalls, missed delivery dates, miscommunication or other issues
don’t negatively impact customer or surgeon relations is a hollow statement.  An overview of the various
CFMS recalls is below.
 


 
5. “Patient-Speci�c” Promotion Ignores Existence of Other Custom Knee Products
 
The narrative promoted by CFMS that they have a signi�cant technological advantage over large entrenched
market leaders generating many billions of dollars in annual revenues is a common narrative.  CFMS is yet
another small technology company making grandiose claims without de�nitive data to support those claims. 
According to a September 2015 report by EvaluateMedTech, the top �ve (5) global orthopedic device
companies are as follows:

CFMS promotes the iTotal as the “only patient-speci�c total knee replacement available on the market today.” 
Ultimately, the iTotal is a custom knee.  The Former CFMS Surgeon speci�cally addressed competing custom
products as follows.
 
Competitors have custom guide process which frankly is just another tack at the same
problem...Depuy and Biomet have custom cutting guides which is the same as Conformis.
 
We reviewed the product o�erings for each of these leading companies and determined that each of them,
with the exception of Medtronic, has a patient speci�c or “custom solution” for TKR.  Further, as the images
below show, using CT Scans and 3D imaging to improve the �t of knee implants is not something that is
unique to CFMS.  The reality is that everyone, or at least four (4) of the top �ve (5) market leaders, has similar
products.  The di�erence is that all of these competitors appear to envision their primary product o�erings,
the o�-the-shelf knee replacement implants, which were developed and continually improved over the last 50
years, as still being preferred in the marketplace.  Our surgeon survey results and the failed market
penetration of iTotal in general, support this view.  CFMS appears to be the only company that has decided to
forego the traditional knee or o�-the-shelf product category and focus 100% of its e�ort on a patient speci�c
or custom knee product.  CFMS has in e�ect picked a �ght with not one but at least four (4) goliaths in their
industry and has come to battle with claims of superior technology that can’t be de�nitively supported.  In our
view, every advantage appears to be held by Johnson & Johnson, Zimmer Biomet etc.  CFMS is but a �y, ready
to be swatted away by dominant market leaders.

6. No De�nitive Data After Almost 12 Years
 
We previously noted the iTotal was launched after clearing the FDA through the 510(k) "loophole."  Amazingly,
CFMS to this day still lacks de�nitive data after almost 12 years of operations.  We wonder if CFMS may not
completely believe it will be able to show de�nitively that its iTotal improves the patient outcome and is
“better” than competing products.

The Ortho Expert stated:
 
It is widely accepted within the healthcare �eld that the e�ectiveness of a medical device concept is
fairly meaningless until such concept is supported by credible independent clinical data that is
published in a peer reviewed orthopedic journal. I don’t see how any product in the orthopedic �eld
could ever become “best in class” without de�nitive data supporting the claim. The question is why
has CFMS been unable to produce de�nitive data?
 
Alternatively, assuming iTotal does in fact improve the patient outcome, CFMS may not survive as an entity
long enough, while competing against its entrenched, dominant competitors.  Additional substantial dilution
seems as though it will be necessary soon in order to keep CFMS alive.  Even still, news of de�nitive data may
come too late. 
 
We obtained a copy of a December 7, 2015 sell side report prepared by Cannaccord Genuity (the “Sellside
Report”).  The Sellside Report noted that “primary outcome” data from three clinical studies highlighted by
management would be available in “1H2017” and “Q4/18” respectively.  We are not sure of the clinical trial
design of these studies but if the past is any indication of the future, these clinical studies will be paid for by
CFMS, performed by CFMS a�liated (and therefore not independent) surgeons, and will not be publishable in
a leading peer reviewed journal.  In that instance, where the data is not presented in a leading peer reviewed
journal, the data is essentially useless.

7. 3D Printing Promotion
 
CFMS has been touted for its purported ability to “3D print” orthopedic joint replacements, speci�cally total
knee implants.  During its the initial public o�ering (“IPO”) process CFMS attempted to infer that its implants
were 3D printed.  The SEC realized this and slapped CFMS on the hands.
 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305773/000000000015030588/0000000000-15-030588-index.htm

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 19/48


 
It appears CMFS kept its 3D printing claims out of its SEC �lings.  We believe their roadshows and other IPO-
related activities must have made mention to its purported 3D printing capabilities as the narrative of the
CFMS IPO, in the media and between investors, was all about 3D printing. 
 
The “3D printing” narrative was trumpeted in the media during the IPO process in the summer of 2015.  Since
the CFMS IPO, references to 3D printing capabilities have continued on various media platforms.  Investors,
some of whom are prominent, have touted CFMS’ purported 3D printing capabilities as a primary reason why
they invested.  Surgeons a�liated with CFMS have conducted interviews with media outlets to promote their
a�liation with CFMS 3D printing capabilities.  Amazingly, the �ne print included within CFMS’ latest Form 10-Q
�led with the SEC on November 9, 2015, states “to date, we have not used 3D printing technology to
manufacture commercially the metal implants.”  CFMS does not o�er any implants that are not primarily
metal.
 


 
The Ortho Expert had the following thoughts on claims about CFMS technology being “3D printed.”
 
As highlighted in this report, the claims by Conformis surrounding the 3D printing topic are at least
very confusing.  They state point blank that they don't use 3D printing on their metal implants.  They
don't mention the plastic portion of the implant.  If they do 3D print the plastic portion this would not
be a signi�cant technical accomplishment.  This would mean that this technology is used only a total
of 30-35% of their knee components.  It appears the Conformis knee �ts all the criteria that is the
industry standard for "o� the shelf" TJA implants.  Their claim of some sort of design and
manufacturing supremacy has little and/or no merit.
 
CFMS reminds us of another public company that promoted itself as a 3D printing trailblazer.  Organovo
Holdings, Inc. (“ONVO”) was touted as a company with revolutionary 3D printing technology that would allow
it to print human tissue.  Investors �nally realized its claims were greatly exaggerated.  ONVO shares are
down from a high of $12.50 on October 15, 2013 to $2.16 as of January 8, 2016 – a decline of 83% (i.e. $12.50 -
$2.16 = $10.34/$12.50 = 83%).

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 20/48


 
It seems to us that once investors become aware that CFMS is not actually 3D printing its metal implants then
shares of CFMS will collapse.  We believe this collapse could occur more sharply than ONVO because CFMS
has actually admitted to its inability to 3D print its products.
 
8. DMLS – According to Management this is the Key to CFMS Pro�tability
 
CFMS plans to use direct metal laser sintering (“DMLS”) to 3D print its implants.  CFMS implants are made
primarily of metal.  We note that the “femoral component” of the iTotal is clearly made of metal.
 
 



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305773/000104746915004962/a2224663zs-1.htm

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 21/48


 
 
CFMS stated that it must manufacture its implants using DMLS in order to reach pro�tability.  We believe this
is true because CFMS is a small company.  CFMS' manufacturing of its implants, which are all custom, is much
more labor intensive and less pro�table than the entrenched market leaders who utilize economies of scale
to produce implants at extremely low cost and have the surgeons do the majority of the customizing of the
implant during surgery.  Ultimately, CFMS is so small as compared to the market leaders that it will not be
able to compete on a level playing �eld. It needs an advantage. That advantage is supposed to be DMLS 3D
printing.
 


 
 
Although we understand why CFMS would attempt to use DMLS 3D printing, it is our view that CFMS has
downplayed the signi�cant challenges it faces if it attempts to develop DMLS 3D printing of its implants.  The
DMLS Expert stated:
 
I do not believe a custom knee implant has ever been produced at commercial scale using DMLS 3D
printing.
 
DMLS 3D printing is not a “plug and play” technology whereby CFMS can simply buy DMLS machines and 3D
print its metal implants.  According to the DMLS Expert, DMLS 3D printing is highly dependent on the skill
level of the technician using the DMLS hardware and software.  There are a limited number of experienced
DMLS technicians in the world.  CFMS has to �nd the right personnel and keep them.  We don’t believe any
company, including CFMS, has ever produced a custom knee implant at commercial scale using DMLS 3D
printing.  We see little reason to believe that CFMS, given the product defect issues, current products failing in
the marketplace, 5 recalls in 7 years, a limited budget and a likely lack of any high quality experienced DMLS
technicians on sta�, will be the �rst company to achieve this signi�cant milestone.
 
Another issue with DMLS is that the technology uses sintering to “print” the metal.  According to the DMLS
Expert, this process produces metal parts with rough surfaces.  We are unsure how CFMS plans to polish and
smooth out the rough surfaces generated by the sintering process.
 
According to the Ortho Expert:
 
Smooth, pristine surfaces are required on the largest surface areas of the implant.
 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305773/000110465915077183/a15-18092_110q.htm%20%20CFMS

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 22/48


Further, we are unsure if this polishing and smoothing process will alter the accuracy level of the implant –
thereby negating the primary bene�t supposedly o�ered by CFMS technology.
 
Ultimately, we believe DMLS is cost prohibitive for CFMS – unless the CEO decides to dilute shareholders
again.
 
1)    Outsourcing
 
DMLS can be outsourced to contract manufacturers.  However, when we spoke with several DMLS contract
manufacturers in January 2016 it became clear to us that CFMS would never be able to outsource its DMLS
manufacturing.  DMLS is primarily used to 3D print a metallic product in mass quantity.  DMLS is not heavily
used nowadays for single prints of single-design 3D products whereby each product manufactured is unique
in its size and shape.  Each implant made by CFMS is unique in size and shape.  As a result of the need to size
and shape each implant, contract manufacturing can not o�er CFMS an e�cient and reasonable cost per
implant.  Outsourced contract DMLS manufacturing is prohibitive for CFMS.
 
2)    In-house manufacturing
 
In order to successfully 3D print its custom implants, CFMS must develop in-house DMLS manufacturing and
�nishing systems.  We envision CFMS facing signi�cant challenges if it attempts to use DMLS to 3D print its
implants.  First, CFMS explained that it plans to bring its current traditional machine manufacturing processes
in-house.  That in itself is challenging for any small company.  CFMS may fail or face setbacks in its attempt to
do this.  Second, CFMS will need to spend a signi�cant amount of capital to acquire DMLS hardware and
software.  A build-out of infrastructure will be necessary to allow for in-house manufacturing with DMLS and
�nishing systems.  The DMLS Expert told us that CFMS should purchase the EOS M290 (the “M290”).  This is
the most advanced DMLS machine that CFMS could purchase today.
 


 
3)    Even an in-house manufacturing platform using the M290 is prohibitive
 
The cost of the M290 is $700,000.
 
We know that there are software costs to consider as well and have been told those costs are approximately
$20,000 annually.  Infrastructure costs and buildout of the manufacturing area will also be costly.  However,
for conservatism’s sake we will only consider the cost of the M290 in our analysis below.
 



http://www.eos.info/eos-m290

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 23/48


 
This analysis suggests that if CFMS plans to meet its 2017 forecasted revenues using DMLS then CFMS would
have to purchase 76 DMLS machines costing at least approximately $53 million.  We estimate the software
costs, �nishing equipment and manufacturing area buildout will cost at least another $20 million,
conservatively.  All in, to meet its 2017 forecast using DMLS, CFMS would need to spend at least $73 million. 
As of the date of this report we estimate CFMS had approximately $128 million - see the "Valuation" section. 
We do not believe management would allocate 57% ($73/$128 = 57%) of its current capital for DMLS given its
current continuing losses and negative cash �ows – especially given that losses are projected by management
until at least 2019.  The only way to a�ord DMLS without jeopardizing the company's continued existence is to
complete another substantial capital raise.  We considered CFMS’ forecasted losses of $145 million for the
next four years and assumed conservatively that CFMS would need $100 million to realistically give DMLS the
best chance of success.  We believe management would only raise capital if it covered the losses for the next
four years of $145 million, the $100 million for DMLS, and a cushion of $100 million.  Ultimately we believe
CFMS should attempt a $345 million capital raise it if wants to actually commit to a DMLS platform.  However,
we are highly doubtful that the market will provide that level of capital at a reasonable valuation.
 
4)    CFMS tests of DMLS at its facilities could succeed but full commercial operations may not succeed.
 
Simply put, because each DMLS 3D print job is unique, CFMS can not run the same program within the M290
DMLS machine every time it runs a print job.  Each print job will require its own print program designed by
the technicians.  As a result of there being no "standard" print program that can be run over and over again
to print mass quantities of the exact same product, CFMS implants will have a higher risk of error each and
every time they are printed, as compared to standard mass-produced products.  The testing phase that may
resolve errors for standard print programs and will allow standard prints to be completed with very little
error.  The testing phase for CFMS printed products will only resolve errors for the particular print job
currently being tested.  The test and adjust process, or trial and error process as some call it, will continue
every time CFMS prints a product.
 
9. “Fits the Patient Exactly” and “Fits Right Every Time” Promotions are Obvious False Claims
 
CFMS and its surgeons suggest that the iTotal “�ts the patient exactly” and even say it “�ts right every time.” 
CFMS appears to operate within the TKR market based on this general premise that their devices are perfect
etc.  The thing is…as we explain further below, there is no de�nitive data to suggest �rst that iTotal is better
than competing products.  Claims that iTotal �ts “exactly” and “�ts right every time” are dubious at the very

least and may very well represent intentional misinformation propagated by CFMS.  We refer to these two
statements in this report as the Primary False Claim and Secondary False Claim, respectively.
 


 
The Ortho Expert responded to these claims as follows:
 
These claims are quite lofty and unrealistic.  It is well recognized that performing a total joint
replacement is considered to be a very high level of carpentry.  Many factors go into the successful
result of a TJA which includes the alignment and sizing.  To give credit to Conformis they have focused
in on very technical and important steps to theoretically improve clinical results. The concern for
these claims relates to stating that because of their technology "it �ts perfect every time".  The fact is
that the outcome they are professing is quite improvable if not actually impossible.  The mismatches
to an exact �t are numerous and will be detailed further in this report but issues in manufacturing
tolerances, mal-aligned CT scans, surgeon skill level and unrecognized pathology are indeed
challenges to this claim.  In addition there are multiple technical issues when using imaging as the
basis of your technology.  X-Rays, CT scans and MRI's are all prone to magni�cation, operator and
patient movement errors not to mention the possibility of software glitches.
 
Note: Additional commentary regarding false claims by CFMS is provided in Appendix C


to this report.


 
10. Surgeons Promoting CFMS Online Have no Track Record in Innovation
 
There are numerous innovative leaders in orthopedic devices.  We obtained a list of 28 orthopedic leaders
and noted that none of them are a�liated with CFMS’ iTotal.  We noted of the 28 orthopedic surgeons listed,
the CFMS “�nd a doctor” database at www.conformis.com provided the contact information for 2 of these 28
surgeons. We contacted Dr. Bugbee and Dr. Gomoll’s o�ces on or about December 29, 2015.  We asked the
surgeon’s personnel which TKR product the surgeon used.  Dr. Bugbee's o�ce did not identify Conformis as a
product they use.  Dr. Gomoll's o�ce stated that Dr. Gomoll does not do TKR surgery.  The leading innovators
in orthopedics appear to have shunned CFMS.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 25/48


 
We then reviewed the various online statements, Q&A sessions and videos on the CFMS website.  We
researched the surgeons quoted or otherwise presented on the website.  It appears to us that not one of the
various surgeons promoting CFMS products on its website have any signi�cant track record of innovation in
orthopedics or any other �eld.  We believe the surgeons on CFMS’ website are being compensated directly or
indirectly by CFMS.  As a result, we anticipate they will speak positively about CFMS.  We believe the lack of
involvement of prominent innovative orthopedic surgeons is alarming at the very least, considering the hype
surrounding the product, and lack of response from the leaders in the �eld.
 
Industry Issues
 
1. Total Joint Replacement Price Erosion
 
A number of market trends for total joint replacement ("TJR") have been negative for some time now.
 
The Ortho Expert stated:
 
There is not one trend I can think of in the TJR market that is positive news for CFMS or any other
company in the space right now.  These are dark days.  Price erosion of joint replacement implants
has been occurring since at least 2008.  I believe the trend actually started around 2005 but there
seems to be no veri�able data available to support that claim.  Either way, my research has indicated
CFMS is paid approximately $4,000 for its iTotal on average.  The CEO explained that CFMS is currently
o�ering iTotal at the same rate as o�-the-shelf products because that is all that Medicare will
reimburse.  Medicare does not consider iTotal to be a product worthy of a premium rate.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 26/48


 
2. Discounted Bundled Pricing
 
The top 10 orthopedic device manufacturers generated approximately $27 billion in sales in 2014.
 
 


 
 
According to the Ortho Expert, these companies each sell thousands of unique products to U.S. hospitals but
more importantly in this case, they sell a variety of products within all clinical disciplines that exist within
hospitals.  The broad and diverse product lines o�ered by these large companies provides hospitals with an
opportunity for one-stop shopping.  Hospitals are in constant crisis mode nowadays as the entire healthcare
system is being forced by the ACA to cut costs.  Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) and hospital
mergers are further centralizing the decision making and procurement processes.  The end result of the

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 27/48


hospitals being forced to cut costs, and the ACA and GPO pressure on costs, is that the average price per
implant CFMS and others can charge will continue trending down.
 
3. Medicare is Stressed, CFMS Survival Dependent on Proof of Superior De�nitive Data
 
Proof that CFMS products improve the patient outcome is critical – yet CFMS has no credible independent
clinical data to speak of. The Medicare and Medicaid systems (“Medicare”) are under increasing scrutiny as a
result of the “Pay-for-Performance” programs included within the A�ordable Care Act.  In addition, most TKR
surgeries are performed on patients who are covered by Medicare.  As a result, although it is well understood
that the potential patient population is increasing as the baby boomers age, this growth is not without
repercussions.  Medicare total costs are going up.  Savings must be found by decreasing per unit costs.  We
don't believe this environment suits CFMS.
 
The Former CFMS Surgeon stated:
 
The market for new implant vendors is not as robust as it has been because of pressure to use
preferred vendors with lower pricing.  Conformis thus has to be orders of magnitude better to justify
in this environment and it just isn't.
 
4. Construct Pricing – CFMS May Get Kicked out of Hospitals
 
Hospitals are being driven to not only cut costs but also to cut the number of companies the hospital
contracts with.  This e�ort is meant to simplify operations but ultimately it is causing hospitals to choose to
do business with larger companies with broader product lines.  Smaller companies such as CFMS are being
“kicked out of hospitals.”  The Former CFMS Surgeon con�rmed this trend and its direct implication on CFMS
operations.
 
Hospitals are moving towards preferred vendors w/better prices and no hospital has CFMS on that list.
 
CFMS Cumulative Losses $310+ Million, Losses Forecasted in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
 
Since 2004, CFMS has sustained cumulative losses of approximately $310 million. We noted wild swings in
gross pro�t % and net margin % that we believe are representative of a manufacturer that is struggling to
acquire marketshare in a mature sector, contain costs while competing against entrenched competitors and
implement in-house highly advanced manufacturing operations.  CFMS explained its recent poor results for
September 30, 2015 were due to the recall announced on August 31, 2015 and related manufacturing issues.
 
CFMS �nancial results for each period disclosed to the public thus far by CFMS are as follows.

IPO in Lieu of Bankruptcy
 
It is quite counter-intuitive but in this world we live in, a public o�ering can actually be a viable method to
stave o� bankruptcy.  This is something that management of the over-the-counter and pink sheet stocks of
yesteryear are well aware.  In many cases, a failing private company may have been organized with good
intentions and its management may have at one time been legitimate businessmen.  However, when forced
with a possible bankruptcy or a demise of some other nature, these good intentions are routinely dismissed
in favor of businessmen retaining some form of legitimacy.  In this case, speci�cally the case of CFMS and its
July 1, 2015 IPO, the management of CFMS were likely considering bankruptcy should their IPO not succeed. 
Through March 31, 2015, CFMS had raised approximately $320 million and generated losses of approximately
$282 million.  CFMS had approximately $23 million in cash at March 31, 2015 and had approximately $14
million in cash�ows used in operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Therefore, CFMS used
approximately $4.67 million of cash in operations per month during the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
At that rate, if the IPO had not been successful, CFMS may have run out of cash by August 31, 2015 and could
have been bankrupt today rather than being listed on the NASDAQ with a market value of just over $500
million.

We noted the various strong commentary CFMS has used in the public markets to describe their products
and technology in general.  In our experience, the tell-tale sign that a tech company’s tech is not as advanced
as they say it is, is when their R&D expenses are a low percentage of total operating expenses.  In this case,
according to the Sellside Report, CFMS R&D expenses will be approximately 21.7% (i.e. $17,638 / $81,245 =
21.7%) of total operating expenses for 2015.  CFMS is spending the majority of its cash on sales and
marketing activities.  Approximately 50.4 % (i.e. $40,983 / $81,245 = 50.4%) of CFMS total operating expenses
were spent on sales and marketing.  These ratios are not the signs of a successful, potentially dominant tech
company that CFMS envisions itself as.
 
Self-Dealing CEO Doesn’t Believe in CFMS Stock, Serial Capital Raiser


Dr. Lang wholly owns Vertegen, Inc. (“Vertegen”), a private company.  It appears as though he began his self-
dealing e�orts in April 2007 when Dr. Lang, being the founder of CFMS, appears to have caused CFMS to
enter into an agreement with Vertegen.  We reviewed CFMS’ public disclosures at www.sec.gov and noted the
following transactions that we believe are examples of self-dealing by Dr. Lang.
 
►  April 2007: Vertegen was paid $10,000 by CFMS 
►  April 2007: Vertegen was issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of CFMS common stock at $1.10
(the “Warrant”), shares and price adjusted for subsequent 2 for 1 stock split 
►  April 2007: Vertegen would receive a 5% royalty on all CFMS sales that utilized Vertegen intellectual
property (the “IP”), primarily related to spinal implants 
►  January 2008: Dr. Lang executed his �rst revenue sharing agreement with CFMS in which he was to be
personally paid a royalty on sales of CFMS products. 
►  September 2011: Dr. Lang executed an amended revenue sharing agreement with CFMS in which he was
to be personally paid a royalty on sales of seemingly every product CFMS sold at rates between 0.875% and
1.33% 
►  May 2015: Dr. Lang caused CFMS to execute an amended agreement with Vertegen such that Vertegen
would thereafter receive a 6% royalty on all CFMS sales that utilized the IP. 
 
Although it remains highly questionable if any intellectual property rights of any true value were received by
CFMS from Vertegen, what is most interesting to us is that Dr. Lang, as the sole owner of Vertegen appears to
have decided not to exercise the Warrant.

The exercise price of the Warrant was $1.10.  Dr. Lang allowed it to expire unexercised on April 10, 2013, less
then 3 years ago.  At the time, between 2013 and 2014, Dr. Lang was selling CFMS shares to investors at $8.00
per share.
 


 
We wonder why Dr. Lang did not see value in exercising the Warrant?  Did Dr. Lang not believe in his
company enough to exercise the Warrant and purchase shares at even $1.10?  He sold shares to investors at
$8.00 and pocketed $300 million for CFMS.  Over the years those same investors have acquired shares in
multiple o�erings that now have an average cost basis of $10.98.  All the while for some reason, Dr. Lang did
not believe in CFMS stock.
 
In addition to the Warrant, CFMS agreed to pay Vertegen $10,000 and would cover all patent �ling costs
associated with certain intellectual property Vertegen licensed to CFMS.  As of June 2015, it appears those
costs have now totaled $140,000.  In addition to these cash payments, CFMS still owes Vertegen a 6% royalty
on products sold by CFMS that utilize Vertegen patented technology for spinal products.  We note it is now 8+
years later and CFMS we’ve seen no sign of CFMS ever having developed any technology related to the spine. 
What was the business purpose of this transaction then? It seems the only rationale would be self-dealing for
the bene�t of Dr. Lang.
 
Dr. Lang is the founder of CFMS yet only owns 5.61% of CFMS.

Dr. Lang earned more compensation in 2014 from a revenue share agreement with CFMS ($578,810) then he
did from his base salary ($365,000).
 


  
 
We have never seen a NASDAQ-listed company maintain a compensation policy such as this – one that
rewards a company’s CEO for its top line growth and ignores any measure of pro�tability or other �nancial
metrics.  Dr. Lang is clearly con�icted in his daily decision making processes.  His own personal interests are
served by selling more products – at whatever sales price he can get away with. Its no wonder that CFMS
o�ers its products in the market at the same or similar price as o�-the-shelf products.  It is highly unlikely the
interests of the CFMS shareholders will align with Dr. Lang. 
 
We wonder if Dr. Lang’s revenue share compensation is clawed back when a recall occurs or does he retain
the compensation even though the products have been returned? Given Dr. Lang’s track record, we believe
he likely retains the compensation – at the expense of the shareholders.
 
It is clear to us that Dr. Lang is a self-interested individual that has no use for or belief in CFMS stock.  The
Vertegen Agreement, revenue sharing agreements and serial capital raising prove that.  Dr. Lang could have
sold the relevant IP owned by Vertegen to CFMS in exchange for equity.  He could have requested a share of
equity at the execution of the revenue sharing agreement or even equity awards based on revenue targets or
unit sales. He chose cash instead.  
 
We researched Dr. Lang’s track record. It appears he has never been involved in the development of any
medical devices other than those that CFMS o�ers.  We did note that he was previously involved with ViOptix
Inc. (“ViOptix”) and Imaging Therapeutics (“ImaTx”).

It appears ViOptix is still operating today – though it does not appear to have successfully raised capital in
several years and has not been acquired. As a result, we wonder if it is a successful company or not.  We
noted that Imaging Therapeutics Inc. was renamed ImaTx and acquired by CFMS in 2009.   
 


 
 
It appears approximately $753,000 of goodwill was generated as a result of the ImaTx acquisition.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 33/48


 
 
We are not sure if the business model outlined in the image above relates in any signi�cant way to CFMS such
that an acquisition of ImaTx would make business sense. What was the business purpose of this acquisition? 
We also noted that CFMS was organized in 2004. CFMS acquired ImaTx in 2009. It seems odd that 5 years
passed before CFMS decided it would make sense to acquire ImaTx. We wonder if Dr. Lang acquired ImaTx
for the sole purpose of ensuring that his track record with startups was not tainted.  Perhaps the easiest thing
to do if you want to hide a failed startup is to reorganize it and merge it into another startup.  We think this
may have happened with ImaTx – though we have no proof of this.  However, if it is true than this would be
yet another example of a management team that appears to make business decisions with no regard for the
common shareholder.  After all, Mr. Lang is at the least, a highly aggressive member of management looking
to siphon o� as much wealth as possible from CFMS.  It would hardly be surprising if he used CFMS capital to
hide the failure of a startup he previously ran.
 
In the absence of a plan to hide what appears to be a prior startup failure, perhaps Dr. Lang was only
interested in the compensation he received from CFMS in exchange for his ownership in ImaTx.  We searched
for any record of who received $753,000 in value as a result of the ImaTx acquisition but were unable to �nd
any records.  We will venture a guess…Dr. Lang received a large cash payout for the acquisition of ImaTx.
 
Obvious Transparency Issues
 
In our review of CFMS SEC �lings, we noted that management has chosen not to disclose well known
technological limitations associated with technology utilized by the CFMS platform.  For example, it is a well-
known fact that 3D printing involves an inherent error rate. Additionally, both CT scans and 3D printing,
especially DMLS 3D printing, require human interaction. As a result, human error is also inherent in the CFMS
manufacturing process.
 
Further, the Ortho Expert made an interesting observation:
 
A pre-operative CT scan should be accurate yes, but once the surgeon makes the �rst cut into the
patient’s remaining knee bones, which is necessary in order to secure an implant provided by CFMS or
any other provider, the accuracy of the CT scan/implant is immediately degraded as the �rst cut has
forever altered the patient’s remaining knee bone.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 34/48


We noted that CFMS does not disclose this inherent unavoidable error rate that is involved with the CFMS
surgical process. On that basis alone, in our opinion, securities fraud claims could be made.  However, we also
note that this inherent error rate also further con�rms that the Primary False Claim and Secondary False
Claim are in fact false claims.
 
Management has also elected not to disclose unit product sales, unit product costs and perhaps most
importantly, product returns – all of which we believe would severely damage the CFMS narrative given to
investors. CFMS acknowledges the importance of its product sales mix, as seen below, but chooses to omit
any disclosures about unit sales or unit prices.
 


We question whether each of the products o�ered by CFMS are actually pro�table on an individual unit
basis.  The fact that this information is not made available to investors in CFMS SEC �lings is in our opinion
highly questionable.  
 
The Ortho Expert also questioned the way product returns are handled with his comment below.
 
The KOL alluded to the fact a CFMS product may be delivered to the surgeon but may not ultimately
be usable by the surgeon if unexpected issues were encountered when the surgery was underway.
These issues could involve either or both soft tissue or bone. It is unlikely a surgeon would just cancel
the surgery since a revised CFMS device would not be available for several weeks. As a result, I believe
the CFMS device would be discarded and a competing Traditional Knee Replacement device would be
used instead. I wonder how often this “reject” occurs where CFMS products are discarded and
furthermore, who pays for the reject? Surely the patient will not be held responsible for this.
 
Yet again, the information discussed here is extremely important for investors to understand. The rate of
product returns/discarded products is a key indicator of the various measurements CFMS could use to
determine the true success rate that CFMS is achieving – both with patient outcomes and its own
manufacturing process. We wonder how CFMS believes it is reasonable to exclude this information from the
shareholders.
 
Dilution Appears Inevitable and Perhaps Imminent
 
We note CFMS had $139 million in cash as of September 30, 2015.  We noted that CFMS did not include any
forecasts of cash�ows in the Sellside Report.  We found this quite surprising given that cash�ow is perhaps
the most important factor to forecast for any manufacturer.  We wonder if CFMS has any cash�ow forecasts
or if management does not wish to share them because the truth is that $139 million is not enough cash. 
CFMS has big plans and talks a big game.  We believe they don't have the cash to execute on those big plans. 
We estimate that CFMS used $11 million in cash in Q4 2015.  We conservatively assume cash�ows used in
investing and cash�ows used in �nancing were $0 and $0 for Q4 2015, respectively.  As a result, we estimate
CFMS had $128 million in cash as of December 31, 2015, as follows.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 35/48


We anticipate CFMS will attempt to implement DMLS into its manufacturing processes in 2016. We believe the
costs to implement DMLS machines and other in-house manufacturing processes will be approximately $73
million during 2016.  We also expect CFMS to fully launch two new products in 2016, the iHip and the iTotal
PS, respectively.  We believe a conservative estimate of the costs to be incurred with these launches is $25
million.  We have estimated CFMS will incur half of the DMLS costs and half of the iHip/iTotal PS costs in the
�rst half of 2016, and the remaining costs in the second half of 2016.  Even though CFMS appears to be
adding signi�cant complexity to its business model and manufacturing systems in 2016, we are conservatively
estimating cash�ows from operations will not increase substantially.  We have estimated, as shown in the
chart below, that CFMS will run out of cash, using our conservative assumptions, at some point in Q3 or Q4 of
2016.
 


 
We caution investors that management will likely be forced to undertake an e�ort to raise capital that could
result in substantial dilution during 2016.  We estimated CFMS will run out of cash in Q3 or Q4 2016 if no
capital raise is completed by then.  We note CFMS appears to have a $10 million credit line.  We do not see
this line of credit as being signi�cant enough to impact this analysis.  We believe management would be wise
to avoid trying to raise capital when cash balances are approaching $0.  Therefore, we believe a raise will be
initiated in Q1 or Q2 2016.  However, we are doubtful CFMS will succeed in raising cash at a price per share
anywhere near the current stock price for the variety of reasons outlined within this report.

We see no value in the CFMS platform and related products.  The iTotal product defects appear not only real
but substantial.  It appears as though they will force CFMS to re-design their primary product.  The top
innovative surgeons appear to have no interest in CFMS. There is a reason for their lack of interest – we
believe it is because CFMS technology is based on a �awed technical premise and involves too many
complexities that could result in size and shape errors in the implant devices.  CFMS management have a
track record of overstating the bene�ts of their products.  They do a great job marketing the company and its
products - albeit with the use of many false and dubious claims.  Those skills de�nitely helped them get this
far.  However, we’ve seen this before.  We don’t believe it will end well.  The �rst iTotal surgery was performed
almost �ve years ago.  It was hailed as a product that would “rede�ne the category.”  It surely has not done so
and now appears to be generating adverse events at the highest rate in the industry, or at least among the
CFMS and the top four (4) competitors, excluding Depuy.  Furthermore, we believe the cost structure of the
product will never allow it to actually compete with o� the shelf standardized products.  Lastly, the writing is
on the wall.  The ACA is forcing the issue.  Smaller companies like CFMS are being discarded by the
marketplace.
 
We note CFMS had approximately 41.4 million shares outstanding as of October 30, 2015 and an additional 6
million shares were potentially issuable.  Therefore, CFMS had approximately 47 million shares outstanding
as of October 30, 2015 - on a fully diluted basis.  We refer to fully diluted share counts because the majority of
the options and warrants are currently "in the money."  In the short term we believe shares of CFMS should
trade at cash, which we estimated at $128 million as of December 31, 2015, or approximately $2.50 (i.e. $128
million / 47 million, rounded to nearest half dollar).  We note that this price target should decrease
substantially each quarter as a result of the continuing substantial losses and cash out�ows being reported
by CFMS.  Our target price is $ZERO.  We believe this will be reached by December 31, 2016 at the latest.
 
Free Trading Shares
 
CFMS’ shares recently dropped below the $15.00 IPO level.  We believe there are multiple reasons why short
term pressure exists on CFMS shares.  The CFMS IPO lockup expiration was on December 28, 2015, where a
total of 30.1 million shares just became freely tradeable – this is 72.7% of the outstanding shares and 291% of
the prior �oat. We believe the �oat has been incorrectly stated on several �nance sites but should have been
10.35 million shares as of December 27, 2015.
 


We note according to its July 1, 2015 prospectus, the cost basis of CFMS’ existing shareholders is $10.98. 
These shareholders were unable to sell their shares until December 28, 2015. 
 


 
We believe CFMS employees and the key shareholders previously noted within this report are well aware of
the product limitations and overall struggles CFMS has endured not only this year but since at least 2009,

when the �rst product recalls were announced. We expect many employees and key shareholders to attempt
to exit their positions in the coming weeks. Their attempts to exit could result in a dramatic downside move in
shares of CFMS.
 
Thus far, since December 28, 2015, we noted the daily volume of CFMS shares has increased.  However, even
assuming these investors were the only “sellers” of shares on the trading days since December 28, 2015,
there still remains 20.1 million shares available for these investors to sell.  These shares could all be sold as
the price of CFMS stock approaches $10.98.  We note the downside to $10.98 is approximately 19.9% as of
January 15, 2016.
 


However, we note that many of these investors that held these shares are substantial shareholders and may
be required to �le Form 4 and Form 13 upon the exchange or sale of any of their shares.  We note that no
Form 4 or Form 13 �lings have been made since December 28, 2015.
 


 
 
We also noted there are approximately stock options 4.3 million CFMS stock options (10% of current o/s
shares) fully vested + exercisable at approximately a $4.87 average price per share (64.5% downside from the
current stock price).  These option holders have signi�cant pro�ts, approximately $38.1 million (i.e. $13.71 -
$4.87 = $8.84 x 4.3 = $38.1), in these options.  As CFMS’ stock price declines the option holders, including the
CEO who holds a majority of these options, will be pressured into exercising and selling their stock.  This
could have yet another e�ect of increasing downside pressure on CFMS shares.

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 38/48


 
We also noted there are approximately stock options 0.8 million CFMS stock warrants (2% of current o/s
shares) fully vested + exercisable at a $10.28 average price per share (25.0% downside from the current stock
price).  These warrant holders have signi�cant pro�ts, approximately $2.7 million (i.e. $13.71 - $10.28 = $3.43
x 0.8 = $2.7), in these warrants.  As CFMS’ stock price declines the warrant holders, including the former
majority shareholders, who hold a majority of these warrants, will be pressured into exercising and selling
their stock.  This could have yet another e�ect of increasing downside pressure on CFMS shares.
 


 
Key Shareholders Have No Known Ties to the Medical Device Sector
 
We researched each of the 5% shareholders listed in the most recent prospectus �led by CFMS and found
none of them have any particular ties or known credibility within the medical device sector.
 


 
We noted Proci�c is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ("ADIA") – according to
SEC �lings by CFMS and others. We are not aware of any particular expertise the ADIA may have in medical

devices. Veron International Limited is a Hong Kong-based investment fund that appears to invest across a
broad mix of industries.  The website for Aeris Capital A.G. simply states that the �rm “acts as �nancial advisor
to the investment interests associated with a European family.” Dr. Muhlenbeck appears to be associated with
Aeris Capital AG.  He does appear to have some medical device experience.  Though, we noted his experience
appears to have been with private companies – none of which appear thus far to have developed successful
businesses.  Again, this investor hardly seems like a specialist in the medical device sector. The latest
prospectus �led by CFMS describes Stanhope Investments as “a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi
Investment Council.”  Similarly to the other investors listed here, we are not aware of any expertise the Abu
Dhabi Investment Council may have in the medical device space.  We were not able to �nd much information
about Tasik Temenggor Investments or its manager Fares Zahir.  We presume Mr. Zahir does not have
signi�cant experience in the medical devices sector.
 
We �nd it odd that CFMS appears to have been unable to secure signi�cant capital from U.S. institutional
investors or investors with known credibility within the medical device sector. For whatever reason, CFMS has
done well to attract investment from foreign investors who have either have no apparent expertise in the
medical device sector or appear to have had limited success in the sector to date.
 
Management's Pitch to Investors: The Bull Case
 
The Sellside Report focused on the following key themes as they relate to CFMS.  Our analysis is provided
subsequent to each “Pitch.”
 
Management Pitch to Investors #1: CFMS will not generate pro�ts in 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019 but will
generate 60%+ gross margins in 2019
 
The losses are about the only thing we noted within the Sellside Report that we agreed with.  CFMS will not
generate pro�ts any time soon.  An image of the forecasted P&L for CFMS is attached.  We noted several
questionable estimates and assumptions in this forecasted P&L.  Perhaps the most interesting thing we noted
is that the Sellside Report doesn’t seem to take into account the launches of iHip or iTotal PS and does not
seem to consider the integration of DMLS into the manufacturing platform.  Yes it is possible all of these costs
would be balance sheet items but either way CFMS, based on this forecast below, looks to run out of cash well
before 2019. It is interesting that the Sellside Report claims the outstanding shares will actually decrease in
2017-2019.  We'd enjoy hearing their explanation for that - or perhaps management could explain how they
will lose $145 million over the 2016-2019 timeframe and not raise additional capital (i.e. stock outstanding did
not increase in this forecast which suggests that CFMS will not raise capital between now and 2019).  If our
assumptions are used for the iHip, iTotal PS, and DMLS projects these �gures will change dramatically and
CFMS would run out of cash by the end of 2016.

Management Pitch to Investors #2: CFMS technology is “truly disruptive”
 
An associate of ours contacted the primary author of the Sellside Report on January 8, 2016, Mr. William J.
Plovanic, CFA.  Our associate asked Mr. Plovanic how he had determined CFMS technology was “truly
disruptive?”  Mr. Plovanic’s reply included references to his 20 years of experience in the orthopedic sector
and claims that he speaks with industry insiders every day etc.  Our associate also asked if Mr. Plovanic had
conducted any surgeon surveys or similar market research as it relates to CFMS.  Mr. Plovanic responded that
Cannaccord had done this work prior to the CFMS IPO.  He did not provide any further information.
 


 
Source: https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/william-plovanic
 
We noted that Mr. Plovanic appears to be successful in his stock ratings 44% of the time according to
www.tipranks.com.  We do not suggest that these rankings are 100% veri�able or should be viewed with a
high level of credibility.  However, we do note that Mr. Plovanic works on the sell side and CFMS is a former
and potential client for Cannaccord.  It surely is not his job to be critical Cannaccord clients – the exact
opposite is unfortunately the case.  The disclosures included with the Sellside Report tell the story clearly. 
Cannaccord global stock ratings are available for 933 companies.  Of those Cannaccord has a “buy rating” on
634 companies, or about 68% of them.  Cannaccord does not have a rating higher than their “buy rating.”  It
doesn’t seem to hard to impress Cannaccord.
 
Ultimately, we don’t believe Mr. Plovanic is as knowledgeable or experienced as the Ortho Expert. 
Additionally, we don’t believe he or Cannaccord itself has done as much research on CFMS as we have and
surely does not have any incentive to be critical of a potential investing banking client.  We don’t feel Mr.
Plovanic has solid footing in this case.  If CFMS technology was “truly disruptive” then surgeons, including
leading innovators, would be waiting in line at CFMS’ headquarters vying for a chance to work with such
groundbreaking technology.  They are not.  Also, what does Mr. Plovanic think about the product liability
lawsuit? It seems he doesn't believe that lawsuit is even worth discussing.  We'd enjoy understanding his
reasoning for that.

Management Pitch to Investors #3: CFMS technology is “di�erentiated both from a technological perspective
as well as a business model”
 
In our research we noted that 4 out of the top 5 medical device manufacturers had custom knee solutions. 
The primary di�erence between CFMS and the dominant market leaders appears to be CFMS’s 3D purported
printing capabilities.  Given that it appears as though CFMS is not capable of 3D printing its metal implants we
don’t see this being a “primary di�erence” at all.  Ultimately, the technology di�erences between all of these
companies is likely very small.  If one of them were able to successfully 3D print highly accurate implants then
this would change.  The CFMS business model is unique yes.  We don’t see that as being a positive however. 
CFMS is the only company we’re aware of that provides custom knee implants and does not provide o�-the-
shelf implants.  Given that o�-the-shelf knees still dominate the market (we estimate 90%+) and CFMS does
not appear to be the breakthrough technology management had envisioned, the lack of o�-the-shelf
products actually puts CFMS at a major disadvantage.
 
Management Pitch to Investors #4: The August 31, 2015 recall “did not impact the company’s positioning with
physicians and patients.”
 
We spoke about this previously in this report.  This statement is hollow.  A history of recalls will of course
impact CFMS’ positioning with physicians and patients.  We'll refrain from saying what we really think about
this but safe to say we see this management team as being "quite slick" - and no this is not a compliment.
 
Management Pitch to Investors #5: Gross margins are currently in the mid-30% range but “there is a clear
pathway to GMs in the mid-60’s over the next 3-5 years”
 
The ACA is designed to reduce pro�ts in the healthcare sector.  This is simple.  Even if CFMS were to somehow
develop clinical data that proved that CFMS implants are as good as management suggests, it would still be
up to the surgeons to adopt CFMS technology and premium pricing would not likely be more than 30% higher
than standard pricing.  Management has not rushed forward to develop data thus far.  Its been almost 12
years and no well regarded innovator in the orthopedic space has alligned with CFMS.  We are not sure they
will be motivated to do so in the future.  We �nd any suggestions that CFMS can double its gross margin in
the current environment to be based on biased assumptions that are do not appears to be supportable by
any formulaic methodology we are aware of.  We presume management is making the assumption that they
solve DMLS in 2017 or so.  That would be the only reasonable basis for the margins increasing that
substantially.  However, we think the chances of CFMS solving DMLS are quite low - and therefore the chances
of gross margins in the 60s is low.
 
Management Pitch to Investors #6: Bundled payment models are the trend, hospitals are looking for risk-
sharing arrangements, CFMS is well-positioned as a result of its “long term outcomes” and economic
e�ciency data”
 
The Ortho Expert was interested in this statement.  His response was as follows:
 
Bundled payment schemes are never good for small companies – no matter how you manipulate the
conversation.  Also, the “long term outcomes and economic e�ciency data” reference is based on the
presumption that CFMS clinical data is de�nitive.  It is not.
 
Management's Pitch to Investors #7: CFMS represents a “hat trick” whereby “(1) the hospital wins with cost
savings from shorter set up/break down times, short surgical times and a shorter length of stay (2) the
surgeon wins with shorter surgical times and happier patients; and (3) the patient wins with higher
satisfaction rates and greater functionality”
 
Again, this “hat trick” is based on the presumption that all of the good things CFMS says may be true about its
iTotal are actually true and are de�nitive.  As of today they are not.  We don't expect de�nitive data any time
soon, perhaps not even before 2020.

Management's Pitch to Investors #8: Clinical data is being developed to support adoption of CFMS knee
products
 
Yes and this data will not be available until 2017 and 2018.  We aren’t looking out that far.  CFMS may not be a
viable entity by that time.
 
We note that CFMS did not provide any disclaimer to inform the reader these statements are not supported
by any independent credible clinical data or that the statements are just opinions and are in no way based on
any factual reference or that it is not attributable to Conformis.
 
Appendix A - FDA MAUDE Comparative Study
 
We performed searches for adverse events reported to the FDA for CFMS' primary product, iTotal, and each
product currently o�ered by the top �ve market leaders in the TKR implant space.  We believe those market
leaders are Depuy, Zimmer, Stryker, Smith & Nephew and Biomet (although Biomet was recently acquired by
Zimmer). The actual top �ve market leaders may di�er as public reporting of revenues for total knee
replacement sales are not always reported by public companies (i.e. Depuy) and some private companies also
have a substantial presence within the market. 
 
Our searches were performed at the following link:
 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm
 
Our inputs and results were as follows:
 


 
The search tool limits results to 500 items per search in raw data format.  We attempted to obtain the longest
period of data as possible within the last two calendar years, in order to compare against each set of results. 
Depuy, Zimmer and Stryker had more than 500 adverse events in the last 12 months. Therefore, we were not
able to obtain 12 month data for those competitors.  Those results were extrapolated out to 12 months.  The
other competitors, including CFMS, had less than 500 adverse events in the 24 months ended December 31,
2015.  For those results we divided them by 2 in order to obtain a 12 month estimate of adverse events.  We
believe our adjustments to the raw data results obtained from the FDA MAUDE database represent a
reasonable estimate of the adverse events each competitor has encountered over a 12 month period.
 
Appendix B - Surgeon Survey

CFMS provides a web search tool to search for surgeons who presumably o�er knee replacement surgery
utilizing CFMS products.  http://www.conformis.com/�nd-a-doctor/  We attempted to utilize this search tool to
estimate how many surgeons perform surgeries with CFMS products.  We found that the design of the
website limits the number of surgeons listed in any search to approximately forty surgeons – no matter what
search terms are used.  We considered that this limitation may produce a smaller list of surgeons than
actually existed within the list of surgeons listed within this database provided by CFMS.  In order to mitigate
this possibility, we conducted a total of �fty searches utilizing the following inputs:
 
Address:     We input the names of each of the 50 states within the domestic U.S. marketplace 
Within:    We selected the largest range available, 10,000 miles
 
Our searches were conducted on December 10, 2015, December 13, 2015 and December 15, 2015
respectively. We note that many of the surgeons listed in the search results were duplications. These
duplications were not included in our list of unique names. The search results appeared to produce
overlapping results such that we believe each search within each state and/or searches within neighboring
states captured each and every surgeon listed within the database provided by CFMS.  However, we had no
direct access to a complete list of surgeons in the CFMS database.  As a result, our attempt to develop this list
from the search tool may have produced an inaccurate number of surgeons who are currently performing
surgeries using CFMS products.  Further, our searches occurred on three di�erent dates, and this report is
dated approximately a week subsequent to the date of the searches.  The exact number of surgeons
performing surgeries utilizing CFMS products as of the date of this report could vary as a result of timing
di�erences, among others.  Although, we do not have access to the complete list of surgeons maintained by
CFMS, we see no reason why any surgeon utilizing CFMS products would not want their name listed on the
CFMS website.  Additionally, we see no reason why CFMS would not list each and every surgeon performing
surgeries with CFMS products on their website.  As a result, we believe the results of our searches produced a
reasonable estimate of the number of surgeons who were performing surgeries with CFMS products on or
about December 15, 2015.
 
Market Survey Call Sheet:
 
There are 311 U.S. surgeons listed by CFMS at http://www.conformis.com/�nd-a-doctor/ who purportedly use
CFMS products.  On or around December 29, 2015, we contacted the o�ces of over 150 out of the 311 U.S.
surgeons.  In most cases we ended up speaking with either the surgeon’s surgical coordinator, the surgeon’s
medical assistant or a clinician in the o�ce. We asked a series of questions designed to understand if and
how these surgeons were using iTotal.
 
1)    Does Dr. ____ routinely perform total knee replacement surgery? 
2)    What brand name products does Dr. _____ use for total knee replacement surgeries? 
3)    Are these brand name products used exclusively for all total knee replacement surgeries?
 
If we were told a surgeon used iTotal then we asked if the surgeon preferred iTotal.
 
Appendix C - False Claims Supporting Evidence
 
Below are speci�c events, statements by CFMS or claims made by the KOL on his personal website and the
Ortho Expert’s response to each.  We are speci�cally noting each response by the Ortho Expert or speci�c
statements that contradict the KOL’s claim above.
 
1.    Product recalls.
 
On August 31, 2015, CFMS announced a recall for each of its four products that were on the market at the
time, the iUni, iDuo, iTotal CR and iTotal PS.  This recall was actually the �fth recall of CFMS products.  CFMS
products were recalled in 2009 (3 separate recalls), 2012 and now in 2015.  The chart below provides

skytides.com/article/conformis-expert-confirms-significant-product-defects-fda-data-implies-cfms-patients-32 44/48


summarized details of each recall.  A class action lawsuit is pending that alleges CFMS distributed products it
knew were faulty.
 
The Ortho Expert’s Response:
 
I explained previously that TKR surgeries are highly unlikely to achieve a 100% successful outcome. As
a result, describing iTotal as a product that “�ts right every time” or “�ts exactly” does not appear
reasonable. Further, when CFMS has issued 5 recalls in 7 years – all of which were due to product
defects – these claims appear invalid. These recalls directly support the assertion that the Primary
False Claim and Secondary False Claim are in fact false claims.
 
2.    A signi�cant contradiction by the KOL.
 


 
The Ortho Expert’s response:
 
This is a reasonable statement. However, this statement is a direct contradiction which supports our
claims that the Primary False Claim and Secondary False Claim are in fact false claims.
 
3.    The use of bone cement suggests CFMS knows iTotal is imperfect 
  
CFMS’s primary product o�ering is iTotal. We note in the “iTotal CR Surgical Technique Guide” provided by
CFMS that Step 6 to be completed by the surgeon includes several actions, one of which includes the
application of bone cement to various surfaces surrounding the implant. 
 
The Ortho Expert’s Response:
 
The reference to bone cement within the CFMS guide is perhaps the most telling sign that CFMS is well
aware that its implant will not �t perfectly and that bone cement should be used to both �ll gaps and
stabilize the implant. The suggested use of bone cement by CFMS is another reference that suggests
the Primary False Claim and Secondary False Claim are in fact false claims.
 
4.    CFMS products may be delivered but may not �t the patient.

this report is sourced from publicly available materials.  As of the date of this report we have not
communicated with management of CFMS, their shareholders or any other party directly associated with the

The Ortho Expert’s Response:
 
The KOL is referring to the fact that iTotal is not a con�gurable device. It can not be modi�ed like
Traditional Knee Kits can be once the surgery begins. This quote therefore suggests that CFMS is
aware that there is a chance that a CFMS knee kit will not �t the patient’s needs. This again suggests
that the Primary False Claim and Secondary False Claim are in fact false claims.
 
5.    The KOL makes numerous baseless claims about the potential of CFMS products.
 


The Ortho Expert’s Response:
 
This list of potential bene�ts is great – but none of these potential bene�ts have been proven – hence
his use of the word “potential” in each statement.

Very informative. Now I know I'm not crazy. I hate my ConforMIS knee. I am so much worse o� than before
the replacement! Fits perfectly my a@#!! I was an active 47 yo before this. I was told it was scar tissue, so had
a MUA . That did notice, then I was told I might need a revision!! If it �ts so well, as they claim. Why would I
need a revision??

No credibility. This unfounded, incorrect article was but out by investors that were trying to short sell the
ConforMIS stock. They make money if the stock does poorly. Look at their disclaimer. It should be criminal. If
you really want to look at ConforMIS, the only patient speci�c arthroplasty knee, look at credible journals.-The
Journal of Arthroplaty. ConforMIS rates lowest for adverse events and outperforms very system in function
and satisfaction.

What content in our report is incorrect? What is unfounded? We will gladly correct any errors though no
errors have been reported to us and it is now 16 months since our report was released. I think the CEO
being �red and the business deteriorating after our report was released seems to suggest our research
was spot on. You make some aggressive claims. Care to back them up with speci�cs and data that was
developed by someone that wasn't paid by Conformis? Do you have any expertise in this �eld at all? The
fact that you wrote this comment suggests you do not or perhaps you are intentionally misleading others.
