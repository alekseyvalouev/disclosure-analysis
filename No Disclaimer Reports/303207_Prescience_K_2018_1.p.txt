Kellogg Company (“K”, or “the company”) is substantially less profitable, more levered, and 
more expensive than it seems. We believe K will reduce or miss on 2018 guidance targets 
and cut its dividend or lose its credit rating. 


Prescience Point Research Opinions: 
• Not the Staple It Used to Be:  Kellogg management misjudged the structural decline 


in demand for sugary and processed foods as cyclical, at the same time 
implementing short-sighted cost-restructuring programs that have stripped K to the 
bone. Reversing these mistakes amounts to a costly destruction of shareholder value.    


• Even More Unhealthy than You Thought: Kellogg’s cost-cutting programs cannot be 
reconciled with its operating cash flows; forensic financial analysis reveals K has 
pulled forward >$1B of revenue from future reporting periods and artificially inflated 
margins & operating cash flow – overstating all three of the primary determinants of 
executive bonuses. 


• Kellogg Management Covered Their Tracks: By offering extended customer payment 
terms and switching its US Snacks business from a ‘sell-through’ to ‘sell-in’ model, 
Kellogg was able to offset steepening early payment discounts & stuff its channels. 
Kellogg has evaded investor scrutiny by covering its tracks with factoring and reverse 
factoring programs, thereby boosting cash flow from operations, suppressing days 
sales outstanding, and resulting in the illusion of high quality earnings.  


• Cluster of Sudden Executive Resignations, a Glaring Red Flag:  Sudden and peculiar 
departures of the CEO, CFO, and President of Kellogg North America – in the midst of 
one of the most expensive and complex restructuring efforts in company history – 
is a glaring red flag.  


• More Leveraged and More Expensive Than Meets the Eye – Based on our 
adjustments, which back out unsustainable boosts to K’s performance metrics, we 
find that K is trading at historically rich, and unjustifiable multiples of 20.4x NTM P/E 
and 14.2x EV/EBITDA.  We value shares at $39.50, representing 35% downside. Similarly, 
Kellogg’s adjusted leverage is 4.9x, in line with high yield CPG peers.

Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) 3 








Introduction: A Severely Malnourished Company  


We are short shares of Kellogg Company, the maker of Froot Loops, Pringles, Rice Krispies and other snacks and 
cereals. We believe the company is engaged in an unsustainable accounting charade to mask revenue and 
profit shortfalls and will be forced to choose between cutting its dividend and losing its credit rating; shares 
could fall 35%. 
 
Kellogg’s stated purpose is “to nourish families so they can flourish and thrive.” Unfortunately, when it comes to 
its business, the company has ignored its own mantra. Sales of Kellogg’s breakfast cereals and snacks have 
been falling for years as consumers move to healthier, less-processed alternatives. Instead of innovating and 
developing new products, it watched from the sidelines as competitors gained market share.  
 
To mask its deteriorating performance, Kellogg has instituted massive cost cuts and used accounting 
gimmicks and financial engineering to boost short-term sales and cash-flow numbers. These artificial 
performance enhancers have triggered tens of millions of dollars in bonuses for Kellogg’s executives while 
employees were systematically laid off. After doubling his compensation to $13 million in 2017, Kellogg’s then-
CEO, John Bryant, abruptly retired at the ripe old age of 52. 
 
We believe the chickens are about to come home to roost, and newly-installed CEO Steve Cahillane will need 
to lower expectations, cut the dividend or find a miracle new product in order to avoid being downgraded to 
junk. He has referred to 2018 as a “transition year,” which should give pause to any investor expecting positive 
results. 
 
Our analysis is based on a months-long deep dive into Kellogg’s business, which included forensic analysis of 
the company’s accounting and financial statements for the past decade, interviews with former employees 
and industry experts, and an examination of management’s own words on conference calls and in other public 
venues. 
 
We even spoke to the company directly, asking pointed questions of its Investor Relations department about 
some of the financial engineering and accounting changes we observed. IR admitted to us that many of the 
moves were “optical” in order to preserve the appearance of positive.  
 
At its core, the Kellogg story is one we’ve seen many times before in corporate America. An old and venerable 
brand fails to invest for the long-term in the face of material challenges to its core product line – namely sugary 
cereals and carb-heavy snacks. Kids and adults just don’t eat as much cereal for breakfast anymore despite 
Kellogg’s efforts to entice them with new products like Donut Shop Pink cereal and Pop Tarts Strawberry 
Milkshake. But Kellogg chose to cut costs rather than invest.  
 
“For more than 100 years we’ve been working to serve the world a better breakfast,” Kellogg says on its website. 
Truth is, they are serving the same thing while their customers have moved on.

K Pulled Forward Revenue & Is More Levered, Less 
Profitable, With Weaker Cash Conversion Than It 
Appears       


In recent years, we believe the Company’s reported financial statements have become dislodged from 
economic realities.  Specifically, we will explain why we believe:  
 


• Future-period revenue was pulled forward due to extended payment terms, changes to the 
Company’s distribution model, and potentially full channel inventory levels.  
 


• Sold and Securitized receivables and “reverse factored” payables should be included in the 
Company’s net debt and leverage ratio calculations given they are akin to short-term financing.  


 
• Comparable operating margin was inflated due to non-operating pension gains and the 


consistent addback of perpetual restructuring charges. 
 
• Operating cash flow and cash conversion is weaker than it appears due to unsustainable 


receivable and payable factoring programs.    
 
Adjusted financials suggest revenue, comparable operating margin, and operating cash flow were overstated 
After taking into consideration the Company’s Monetization Program, Securitization Program, Factoring 
Program, “sell-in” benefit from its new warehouse distribution model, one-time pension gain, and “non-
recurring” restructuring charges, we find: 
 


• K’s reported comparable net sales has been inflated for the last two years. 
 


• K’s reported operating profit margin was inflated by 140 basis points in FY 16 and 330 basis points 
in FY 17. 


 
• K’s reported operating cash flow was overstated by 23.7%.

Kellogg Pulls Forward Future-Period Revenue & Implements Several 
Receivable “Factoring” Programs to Suppress DSO 


Extended terms program implemented; receivable factoring program initiated to “mitigate” DSO impact  
In Q1’2016, Kellogg executed a discrete customer program to extend customer payment terms.  In addition, 
throughout FY 2016, Kellogg implemented several receivable sales programs to “mitigate” the net working 
capital impact from the extended term program.0F1 
 


During the quarter ended April 2, 2016, we executed a discrete customer program to extend customer 
payment terms.  In order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms, we entered 
into an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third 
party financial institution.   


(Q1’2016 10Q) [emphasis added]

Extended terms program may have been implemented in response to large customers pushing aggressive 
terms on to Kellogg 
Based on conversations with several individuals in the consumer packaged goods industry and analyst 
community, we believe Kellogg’s extended payment terms program may have been implemented to offset 
the income statement impact from aggressive terms from some of Kellogg’s largest customers (e.g. 
Walmart).  For example, a large customer tells Kellogg it can pay sooner but wants a large discount for doing 
so or it’s going to extend payments beyond its ordinary terms.  As a result, Kellogg then uses the same 
strategy on its own vendors.  In effect, Kellogg is able to conserve its income statement (i.e. not take a hit from 
accepting large discounts) at the expense of its working capital levels (i.e. accepting the extended payment 
terms from is own customers).  Alternatively, Kellogg could have also instituted the program to generate 
and/or incentivize additional purchases from customers.          
 
Extended terms can provide a transitory benefit to revenue growth  
Extending payment terms to customers allows a company to: 


 
• Pull forward future-period revenue, as customers are enticed to purchase more product/inventory 


than they otherwise and normally would  
 


• Eliminate early payment/pre-payment discounts  
 
Receivable factoring programs allow companies to show stronger operating cash flow and lower DSOs 
There are two primary benefits of a receivable factoring program: 
 


• Cash management – Collecting receivables earlier than normal (i.e. boosting reported operating 
cash flow) 


• Financial statement optics – Showing lower reported days sales outstanding (DSOs), as sold 
receivables are removed from the balance sheet 


 
Outstanding balances under receivable programs reach over $1.0 billion 
As illustrated in the table below, accounts receivable sold, but outstanding surged throughout FY 16 to nearly 
$1.0 billion.  At the end of 2017, receivables sold, but outstanding increased even further to $1.1 billion.

We believe securitizations should be treated as short-term financing 
According to credit ratings agency Fitch, receivable factoring can be viewed as an alternative to secured 
debt.  Fitch’s Corporate Rating Criteria publication on 03/23/18 says:: 
 


“Fitch views factoring essentially as an alternative to secured debt, whatever the level of recourse to 
the originator…Fitch will reverse the accounting treatment and adjust financial statements… 
 
Assets:  the relevant section of the balance sheet is increased by the outstanding amount of factored 
assets at the closing date.  
 
Liabilities:  the section “other debt secured” is increased by the same amount.   


(Fitch Ratings, Corporate Rating Criteria, 03/23/18) [emphasis added] 
 
Using Fitch’s methodology, we believe $1.1 billion of securitized receivables should be added to net debt.  
 
K’s Use of AR factoring is masking a massive deterioration in revenue quality, as indicated by a near-doubling 
of adjusted DSOs over the past two years 
In Q4’2017, DSOs were 41 days.  However, after adjusting for factored receivables, adjusted DSOs were 74 days, 
almost twice as high as reported DSOs.  Moreover, since 2014, reported DSOs remained relatively stable 
between 38 days and 41 days, while adjusted DSOs nearly doubled from 39 days to 74 days.

K is an extreme outlier among peers in terms of its DSOs, indicating desperation to keep sales afloat & revenue 
quality issues 
Historically, Kellogg’s DSOs have tracked above its peer group median.  However, since the implementation of 
its receivable programs in Q1’2016, Kellogg’s adjusted DSOs surged well above the peer group median.   
 
We believe this suggests: 
 


• Kellogg’s revenue quality is much weaker as customers pulled forward purchases to take 
advantage of extended terms (i.e. high probability of future revenue miss). 


 
• Channel inventory levels at Kellogg’s retail customers may be full. 


 
• Peers are not using receivable factoring programs to the same extent as Kellogg.

Extended terms programs entice customers to purchase more inventory than they ordinarily would 
Based on an interview with the Director of Strategic Merchandising and Pricing at a major Kellogg retail 
customer, 
 


• The customer took advantage of K’s extended payment term offering 
 


• Retailers generally prefer “just-in time” inventory purchases, but if the product has a longer shelf life 
(e.g. dry cereal, etc.), it will purchase more than it ordinarily would to take advantage of favorable 
terms 


 
• With terms program, customer was able to purchase product and “turn-it” before it had to pay 


invoice 
 


“The extended terms program, we have absolutely taken advantage of that.  One of the things that 
we prefer to do is to buy product and to turn it before we actually have to pay our invoices…there’s 
really no benefit for us to buy quantities of product that we can’t turn within a certain period of time.   
 
However, if there’s an – if – first of all, if we’ve got product that has a longer shelf-life, and dry cereal, 
packaged cereal, has a longer shelf-life, we have the option of taking advantage of special incentives 
to purchase more than what we would normally turn, knowing that we can push that product through 
the supply chain without having to pay anything on the product, at least until we have – until that 
product is actually sold through.”  


Director of Strategic Merchandising and Pricing, Kellogg Customer, 04/17/18 
 
Management touts improved working capital levels to investors, but metric doesn’t account for factored AR 
In its Q4’2017 Investor Presentation, Kellogg highlighted significant improvement in core working capital levels.  
However, the Company’s core working capital metric did not account for the sale of factored receivables.  
Given receivables sold, but still outstanding is greater than $1.1 billion, we believe it’s somewhat misleading for 
Kellogg’s management to tout improved working capital metrics.

Securitization program ended in late 2017 due to less customer interest and a change in presentation of 
proceeds  
In an 8K filed on 12/27/2017, Kellogg announced it would “wind-down” its accounts receivable securitization 
program.  The wind-down would commence on 12/29/17 and no new receivables would be sold into the 
program after 12/28/17.  The program was set to expire in July of 2018, but the Company decided to end it early 
due to:  
 


• Declining customer interest in its extended-terms program, and 
 


• Recent changes to accounting guidelines whereby (1) proceeds from securitizations would no longer 
be included in cash from operations activities, but rather cash from investing activities and (2) 
burdensome administration would be required from daily reconciliations of receivables sold and 
collected under the program.   


 
Declining interest in extended terms program and less securitizations suggests receivable unwind will start in 
FY 2018 
In our discussion with Kellogg’s Investor Relations department, we learned some customers previously in the 
securitization program will move to a new monetization program.  However, the net factored receivables (i.e. 
old monetization + new monetization – securitization) will be down in FY 2018 as the securitization program 
balance goes to zero (i.e. fully unwinds).  As the receivable program unwinds, we believe the unsustainable 
revenue benefit Kellogg realized over the last two years will start to reverse.  In addition, we believe “declining 
customer interest” in the extended terms program suggests customers may no longer want to purchase more 
inventory than required given potentially elevated channel inventory levels and/or customers would prefer to 
take advantage of early payment discounts.  In either situation, we believe the incremental revenue benefit in 
FY 2018 may be materially lower than in prior periods as the extended receivables/securitized receivables begin 
to unwind

Technically speaking, it will be a separate monetization program.  But yes, I mean what you'll see is the 
securitization program balance goes to zero and then the existing monetization program plus the 
new one, you know, together will go up by all the customers that are shifting over from the 
securitization.  Net, I think it will be down to be honest with you because enough customers have gotten 
off the extended terms program.   


Kellogg, Investor Relations, 04/11/18 
   
IR Contact reveals receivable programs helped Kellogg manage toward incentive plan Cash Flow metric 
In a discussion with Kellogg’s Investor Relations department, we learned one of the reasons the Company 
decided to securitize receivables was that the proceeds were included in cash from operating activities and 
helped the Company “manage” its Cash Flow bonus metric. 1F2  In other words, Kellogg could extend terms to 
eliminate early payment discounts and boost sales, securitize the receivables to eliminate the negative impact 
on reported DSOs, and present securitization proceeds in cash from operating activities to preserve operating 
cash “optics.”  But, now that securitization proceeds need to be reported as investing activities (i.e. no benefit 
to cash flow from operating activities), the Company eliminated the program.  
 


Under the accounting changes, we would no longer be able to net the securitization proceeds, out of 
the accounts receivable to keep up at the same DSO and the same cash flow operations.  Instead 
any proceeds from a securitization would now fall under cash for investing activities and therefore 
obviating the whole reason why we did it which was to keep our cash flow neutral. 
 
We have a metric Cash Flow that we publish, that we have bonus metrics tied to and when we did the 
extended terms programs, what we didn't want to happen was to have our Cash Flow disappear even 
though it might be optical, that's what investors look at, Cash Flow, which is our definition cash from 
operating activities minus capital expenditure.   
 
So if this securitization no longer helps offset the extended terms program receivables, then suddenly 
you're going to have a Cash Flow that just disappears, it's going to look at least optically like we have 
negative cash flow.  So that's what I mean by it.  I mean it's optical, but it's viewed.

“Reverse Factoring” Allowed Company to Delay Payments & Artificially 
Boost Cash Flow 


Company entered into “reverse factoring” arrangement in the beginning of 2014 
In 2014, the Company entered into an “accounts payable tracking system” arrangement (i.e. “reverse factoring” 
agreement), which allowed suppliers to sell payment obligations from the Company to designated third-party 
financial institutions.  Effectively, this allowed Kellogg to delay payments to its suppliers.  Moreover, Kellogg’s 
payment obligations to suppliers that utilized the program were now due to a third-party financial institution 
(i.e. bank), instead of the supplier.      
 


Beginning in 2014, the Company has an agreement with a third party to provide an accounts payable 
tracking system which facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and, if elected, sell to

designated third-party financial institutions, payment obligations of the Company.  Participating 
suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more payment obligations of the 
Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial 
institutions.  The Company’s goal in entering into this agreement is to capture overall supplier savings, 
in the form of pricing, payment terms or vendor funding, created by facilitating suppliers’ ability to sell 
receivables, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility. We have no economic 
interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial 
institutions concerning these services.  The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts 
due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under 
this arrangement.  


 Kellogg Q1’2014 10Q 
 
What is the accounting impact of a “reverse factoring” program & how does it benefit Kellogg? 
A “reverse factoring” program allows a company to: 
 


• Extend days payables outstanding (i.e. take longer to pay off current payable obligations). 
 


• Hold onto cash longer (i.e. report stronger operating cash flow) and/or use less debt to finance 
working capital, share buybacks, etc.  


 
Days payables outstanding more than doubled since program was implemented 
In Q4’2017, days payables outstanding (DPO) increased 21 days to 111 days, almost twice as high as DPO in Q4’2014 
(52 days).  Moreover, over the same period, outstanding obligations placed in the accounts payable tracking 
system increased $173.0 million to $850.0 million.

Should “reverse factoring” be treated like short-term debt?   
We think so, and so does Fitch and S&P.   
 
According to Fitch: 
 


Fitch would also adjust the debt for extension in payable days resulting from a reverse factoring 
transaction…The amount under the trade payable would as a result be owned by the issuer to the 
financial institution with a final maturity often significantly extended as compared to the maturity of 
the original payable.  For example, assuming an outstanding amount of confirming CUR100m, with an

Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) 13 








extension of payable days from 60 days to 180 days.  Fitch would consider that the 120 day extension 
is akin to financial debt and would add to financial debt 120/180 of the outstanding amount.   


Fitch Ratings, Corporate Rating Criteria, 03/23/18 
 
S&P applies similar treatment: 
 


If we believe that an issuer’s trade payable days are well beyond the range of what would be deemed 
normal trade terms for the industry, and the improvement to cash flow/leverage measures that 
results from the stretch in trade payables is deemed material, then we’d make an adjustment.  In the 
case of reverse factoring…we may make a debt adjustment for customer, if we believe that the trade 
payable days are well beyond the range of what would be deemed normal trade terms.   


S&P Global Ratings, RatingsDirect, Corporate Methodology: Ratios and Adjustments, 11/19/13 
 
 
We estimate $1.1 billion of accounts payable should be added to net debt 
Based on the Fitch and S&P methodologies of adjusting debt by “reverse factored” and/or materially extended 
payables, we estimate $1,120.8 million of accounts payable should be considered short-term financing and 
therefore included in net debt.

“Reverse factoring” is dependent on Kellogg’s credit rating; higher leverage ratio may negatively impact rating  
Under the “reverse factoring” program, the banks essentially use Kellogg’s credit (i.e. credit rating) as 
collateral for obligations placed into the accounts payable tracking system.  If Kellogg’s credit rating and/or 
leverage ratio deteriorates, it could be detrimental to the Company’s ability to run its payable tracking 
system.

Kellogg’s suppliers “angered” by the payable tracking system; only tolerated it because of low interest rates  
In an interview with a former Senior Packaging Engineer who worked at Kellogg for 15 years, we asked what 
suppliers thought of Kellogg’s accounts payable tracking system.  According to the former employee, suppliers 
were “angered” to have to wait longer to get paid and only tolerated it because interest rates are so low.  We 
believe a rising interest rate environment may complicate matters for Kellogg as customers could become 
even more “angered.”         
 


This, without a doubt, angered suppliers, but what could they do?  This was an idea come up under 
John Bryant that put a major strain on Kellogg and its suppliers as they had to wait 120 days to get 
paid.  But I think because interest rates were so low that it didn’t quite hurt them [the supplier] as much.  
As interest rates start to creep up, this program seems way less attractive to suppliers or they just will 
say no and not participate.

OCF Materially Benefited From Receivable & Payable Factoring Programs 


Cash flow screens may have missed the poor earnings quality at Kellogg 
Given accounting rules allowed for the inclusion of receivable and payable factoring proceeds in operating 
cash flow, we believe cash flow and/or cash conversion screening metrics for Kellogg may have appeared 
artificially good in recent periods (i.e. no red flags).  However, we believe adjusted operating cash flow metrics 
tell a different story.  Kellogg used unsustainable levers to pull forward revenue, inflate margins, and report 
“optically” good cash flow.      
 
FY 2017 operating cash flow may have been overstated by more than 23% 
In FY 2017, operating cash flow was $1,646.0 million.  After adjusting for movements in the Company’s accounts 
receivable and accounts payable programs, we estimate adjusted operating cash flow would have been 
$1,331.0 million, 23.7% below what the Company reported.

Change From “Sell-Through” to “Sell-in” Model Creates 
One-Time Revenue Benefit 


Shift from Direct Store Delivery distribution to warehouse model will impact ~14% of Company revenue 
In a Press Release on 02/08/17, Kellogg announced it would begin to exit its Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) network 
in Q2’2017.  The transition would include moving the DSD-distributed portion of its US Snacks business to the 
warehouse model already used by Pringles and the rest of its North American business.   
 


As we closely added US snacks business, it became clear that moving to retail warehouse distribution 
system offered the best path more profitable growth going forward.  This is a difficult decision in light 
of this near-term impact on the organization, but it is the right long-term decision.  (CEO Mr. John 
Bryan, Q4’2016 Conference Call, 02/09/17)

Source: 8K filing on 02/09/17   


 
At the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference on 06/03/17, Kellogg indicated 60% of its US snacks business 
goes through DSD.  Accordingly, we estimate 14% of Company revenue will be impacted by the DSD exit.

Warehouse model has earlier revenue recognition than the DSD model (“sell-in” vs. “sell-through”) 
In the DSD model, revenue is recognized when the product is shipped/delivered to the retail store (i.e. customer) 
from a supplier’s distribution center (i.e. “sell-through”).  In the warehouse model, revenue is recognized when 
the product is shipped (i.e. “sell-in”) to the retailer’s warehouse (i.e. customer).  So, from an accounting 
perspective, revenue is recognized earlier in the warehouse model.

Benefit from earlier revenue recognition and one-time “sell-in” benefit is not sustainable; lapping initial “sell-in” 
in H2’2018  
In a conversion with Kellogg’s Investor Relations department, the Company indicated US Snacks revenue was 
impacted by two key items in FY 2017.  First, the pull back of promotional activity “severely” hurt consumption.  
Second, the Company said lower promotional activity was “largely, but not completely” offset by the one-time 
benefit of shipments to customers to fill their warehouses.  While there may be some clear SG&A savings by 
switching to the warehouse model, the one-time “sell-in” benefit from building stock at retailers’ warehouses is 
not sustainable.  Moreover, the Company will lap these one-time benefits in back-half of FY 2018.      
      


During the sort of the end of Q2 and early Q3, we had two conflicting impacts.  One was we had to pull 
back on promotional activity severely so that hurt our consumption and, therefore, our net sales.   
 
The reason we had to do that was because we were asking our supply chain to produce above and 
beyond the current demand forecast and in the exact proportion of SKUs demanded by each 
customer, product that would be shipped to the customers' warehouses as their initial pipeline sale 
(ph).  So, the negative is the loss sales from pulling back on promotion.  That was largely but not 
completely offset by the one-time benefit of shipments to the customers to fill their warehouse.

Nielsen Data Suggests End Market Demand is 
Substantially Weaker than “Sell-In” and/or Channel is 
Stuffed 


Based on Nielsen US scanner data for Kellogg, we believe Kellogg’s reported North America revenue (i.e. “sell-
in”) is materially higher than actual end-market demand.2Fi  For example, Q3’2017 North America reported 
revenue declined 1.6% vs. a 4.8% decline based on Nielsen US scanner data, a 320 basis point difference.   
Moreover, Q3’2017 reported North America volume vs. Nielsen US scanner data volume diverged 540 basis 
points.  What could have caused the divergence?  We believe the reason may be twofold:  
 


• DSD to warehouse model change:  The shift from the DSD to the warehouse model provided a one-
time benefit to the US Snacks business.

• Stuffing the channel:  DSOs sky rocketed over the last couple of years as customers took advantage 
of Kellogg’s extended payment term offerings and purchased more product than they actually 
needed.

While volume data is not impacted by retail sales prices and the divergence suggests an even larger 
dislocation between “sell-in” and “sell-through,” to be conservative in our “sell-in” benefit estimates below, we 
used reported revenue growth vs. US scanner revenue growth.     
 
Revenue benefit from “sell-in” and/or channel stuffing accounted for approximately 1.1% of K revenue  
Based on the differences between K reported North America revenue growth and Nielsen US scanner data, we 
estimate FY 2017 benefited by $143.1 million (1.1% of Kellogg revenue) from either unsustainable “sell-in” and/or 
channel stuffing.

This is the largest divergence from US scanner data in over 7 years 
From Q1’2013 through Q3’2016, Kellogg reported North America growth and US scanner data tracked relatively 
in-line with each other.  However, from Q4’2016 through Q3’2017, reported North America revenue was 
substantially higher than US scanner data.  We believe the continued outperformance of reported growth vs. 
scanner data is the result of multiple years of using unsustainable measures (e.g. extended term programs, 
changing distribution model, etc.) to artificially enhance reported results.

Kellogg is the only peer to consistently report higher revenue growth vs. scanner data 
Since Q2’2014, reported Kellogg North America growth has always been above US scanner data.  At every peer, 
reported vs. scanner data is substantially more volatile (i.e. some quarters scanner growth is higher and vice 
versa).  We believe the consistent outperformance may be due to Kellogg’s extended terms program and/or 
recent “sell-in” benefit.  In either scenario, we do not believe it is sustainable in the long-term.

DSI Surges; Balance Sheet Inventory Levels May Be Building Due to Full 
Channel 


K says inventory may be elevated due to DSD exit 
In Q4’2017, DSI increased 5 days year-over-year to 60 days.  When we asked Kellogg’s Investor Relations about 
the increase in Q4’2017 DSI, the Company said there may be a little “distortion” in inventory due to the DSD exit 
and that it wanted to carry some extra inventory because it wasn’t sure what customers would do under the 
new warehouse program.   
 


There's a little bit of year-on-year, you're going to have a little bit distortion from the DSD exit just 
because of the fact that we wanted to carry some extra inventory because we just weren't sure what 
customers now that they control the inventory for the first time, what they were going to do.

DSI Suggests Balance Sheet Inventory is Elevated 


 
3M DSI = Average Inventory / 3M Sales * 91.25 
12M DSI = Average Inventory / TTM Sales * 91.25 


 
Kellogg’s DSI suggests it may have too much inventory on the balance sheet; increases risk of write-offs 
As we already discussed, we believe there is evidence to suggest the Company unsustainably benefited from 
(1) one-time “sell-in” due to the distribution model change and/or (2) channel stuffing.  Both of these items 
should have helped/reduced balance sheet inventory.  So, elevated balance sheet inventory not only 
exacerbates concerns about a full channel, but increases the risk of write-offs as Kellogg may be stuck with 
excess inventory (average life of boxed cereal is 6 to 8 months).  Alternatively, if the Company chooses to 
excessively discount excess inventory to move it off the balance sheet, margin will also be pressured.   


One off Pension Benefit Boosted Comparable 
Operating Income by 14% 


Pension gains moved from COGS & SG&A to Other Income (i.e. below operating income) 
In its 8K on 02/08/18, Kellogg indicated the adoption of the new ASU will result in moving the Interest Cost, Return 
on Assets, and Prior-Year Service Costs components of Pension & Post-Retirement expense out of Cost of 
Goods Sold (COGS) and Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses, and into Other Income & Expense.  
There would be no impact on the Company’s Net Income, on a shift between Operating Profit and Other Income 
& Expense.   
 
Pension adjustment is material to operating income, obfuscates underlying profitability  
The amount to be reclassed per the new ASU is $542.0 million (25.3% of FY 2017 GAAP operating income).  As 
related to Kellogg’s comparable operating income metric, it is defined to exclude mark-to-market 
adjustments for pension plans and Project K restructuring activities; but the Company does not appear to 
exclude “All Other” pension gains or losses.  Accordingly, we believe FY 2017 comparable operating income 
benefited from $268.0 million of pension gains that do not accrue to shareholders.  As a result, we believe “All

A Case of Recurring, ‘Non-Recurring’: Restructuring 
Charges Persist for 5 Years 


Restructuring charges account for over 10% of comparable operating income 
In FY 2017, restructuring and merger related charges were $268.0 million and accounted for 12.5% of 
comparable operating income.  This was the fifth consecutive year restructuring and merger related charges 
accounted for more than 10.0% of comparable operating income.   As a result, we believe these charges are 
material to Kellogg’s profitability.

If restructuring charges are recurring they should not be excluded from comparable operating income 


While the majority these costs are related to Project K, we believe excluding “non-recurring” restructuring 
charges that persist for more than five years does not accurately reflect the costs associated with running 
the business.  If a business needs perpetual restructuring, the costs should not be excluded as “non-
recurring.”  In addition, persistent restructuring charges provides the Company an opportunity to bucket 
normal recurring costs as “restructuring” and have then excluded from non-GAAP results.  An argument could 
be made that all recurring restructuring charges should be included in comparable operating income, but to

MGMT Running Kellogg For Short-Term Incentive 
Bonuses, Not Long-Term Success?   


Since 2008, Kellogg has undergone two large, back-to-back multi-year restructuring initiatives.  Based on the 
analyst commentary below, we believe some of the sell-side community was not impressed with the results 
from Kellogg’s K-Lean program and were skeptical about Kellogg’s ability to successfully implement a new 
restructuring program; Project K. 
 
2008 – 2011 (K LEAN) 
In 2008, the Company initiated K LEAN; a manufacturing initiative in certain US, Latin American, and European 
manufacturing facilities to optimize its manufacturing network, reduce waste, develop best practices across 
its global facilities, and reduce future capital expenditures (“capex”).  The K LEAN program ended in 2011. 
 
2013 – Present (Project K & Zero-Based Budgeting) 
In 2013, the Company initiated Project K; a four-year global efficiency and effectiveness program.  The 
program’s initiatives were to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing 
and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation.  Moreover, the Company 
highlighted the program would provide a number of benefits including an optimized supply chain 
infrastructure, the implementation of global businesses services, and a new global focus on capabilities.  
Concurrent with Project K, the Company implemented a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in its North 
America business in 2015 and it International business in 2016.             
 
Why did the Company undergo two consecutive cost restructuring programs?  Over the same time period, 
the Company’s named executive officers (NEOs) annual incentive compensation targets were based on 
Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) Operating Profit (50% weighting), AIP Net Sales (30% weighting), and AIP Cash Flow 
(20% weighting).  AIP Operating Profit and Net Sales exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, mark-
to-market adjustments, acquisitions, dispositions, costs associated with restructuring programs (e.g. Project K 
& K-Lean), and differences in shipping days.  AIP Cash Flow is operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  In 
addition, executive performance plan (EPP) target metrics under the Company’s long-term incentive plan 
(LTIP) have generally been based on a combination of net sales and EBIT or cumulative cash flow.  We believe

Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) 24 








the restructuring plans (and the exclusion of the associated costs) helped the Company achieve the largest 
AIP incentive metric; operating profit.

Were these programs effective?  Some analysts would say “no.” 


 
Analyst:  One last question on -- K-LEAN…do you feel again like the K-LEAN program maybe – hurt the 
assets more than it helped?  And do you feel now you have the right level of investment that you need 
to put in? 
 
CEO John A. Bryant:  How did we get ourselves in a situation that we're in and the need to reinvest even 
more money back into our supply chain in the back half of the year?...One [cause] was we did cut too 
many people from our facilities as part of the U.S. implementation of K-LEAN...And so I think a lot of the 
issues we have actually are in our U.S. network…I think K-LEAN cut too deep in the US network, and we've 
reversed direction on that and added people back into those facilities.   


Q3’2011 Conference Call, 11/03/11 [emphasis added] 
 


Analyst:  Obviously, K-LEAN was quite, in some respects, damaging to the company.  Why is this one 
different, and why should investors have faith that Project K is going to be a much better outcome 
than the challenges that K-LEAN ultimately resulted? 
 
SVP Alistair D. Hirst:  It is not just a supply chain initiative as we just laid out…The project gets its structural 
fixed costs in our under utilized asset base under the four years.  So that's where the big difference is 
to the previous K-LEAN initiatives, which really was a wide-ranging headcount reduction within the 
plants.  So this is very targeted to assets, to lines, and to plants, so while that's very difficult, it is the right 
thing to do to be driving our long-term growth.  So it is a very different point of entry from the previous 
initiatives that we've carried out as a Company.   


Q3’2013 Conference Call, 11/03/13 [emphasis added] 
 
Large and questionably successful restructuring programs helped Company reach bonus targets, but did it 
create value to shareholders?  
CEO compensation sine K LEAN ended in FY 2011 almost doubled, while nearly all operating metrics suffered.  As 
a result, we believe there is a huge disconnect between Company performance to create shareholder value 
and executive compensation.

New annual incentive target to focus on AIP Net Sales, at the expense of AIP Cash Flow 
In its Proxy Statement on 03/07/18, AIP performance metrics weights were changed for the first time in nearly 
a decade.  In 2018, AIP Net Sales will account for 50% of the AIP payout factor, previously it was 30%.  Based on 
our conversation with Kellogg’s Investor Relations, a “large chunk” of the AIP Cash Flow target will be added to 
the AIP Net Sales target: 
 


The annual incentive plan which is just our annual cash bonus, that has several metrics in it and for 
many employees but not all of employees but the ones who are more on the commercial side, for 
this year only, they are going to shift a large chunk out of the cash flow, the portion that was from cash 
flow and the add it to the net sales.

On 09/27/2017 Mr. Bryant decided to retire for “personal reasons” after seven years as CEO of Kellogg.  
However, he planned to remain as Chairman of the Board until 03/15/18.  Before his role as CEO, Mr. Bryant 
served as CFO and COO.  On 11/09/17, Mr. Bryant sold 190,000 shares for total proceeds of approximately $12 
million, over 60% of his beneficial ownership at the time of the sale.  Sell-side analyst commentary seems to 
suggest Mr. Bryant’s departure was not on his own volition.  In a note to clients, JP Morgan said: 


 
Mr. Bryant stressed that he is leaving on his own volition.  Given the suddenness of the announcement, 
many investors this morning have asked whether his retirement was his own choice.  Consultants we 
spoke with today who know the industry well indicated that the company was not happy with its 
performance and the board wanted to make a change… We also have fielded questions this morning 
from investors asking, “Why now,” in the middle of one of the biggest supply chain transitions we have 
seen in food.

• Input costs rising faster than anticipated. 
 


• Increased operating costs: external manufacturing, intra-network shipments.

Limited Capital Structure Flexibility Suggests K May 
Have to Choose Between Credit Downgrade or 
Dividend Cut 


Because Kellogg’s CFFO has been unsustainably inflated by factoring and reverse factoring arrangements, it 
is unreliable as a starting point for an assessment of cash available to cover dividends and debt obligations. 
As such, our assessment is based on adjusted EBITDA as the source of cash.  As seen in the table below, 
Kellogg has approximately $1,000.0 million to cover $784.0 million of dividends and $779.0 million of debt 
obligations.  Given estimated available cash is not enough to cover both, we think a couple different 
scenarios could play out: 
 


(1) Refinancing:  This may be the easiest option in the near-term, but the Company has 
already re-financed most of its higher interest rate debt.  So, we believe any incremental 
interest savings from refinancing may not be materially impactful.  Moreover, we believe a 
rising interest rate environment will be an additional headwind.  Lastly, even if refinancing

Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) 29 








was able to somewhat lower interest expense, it won’t necessarily reduce Kellogg’s debt 
levels.  So, Kellogg would essentially be in a similar situation as it is now; more levered than 
some realize due to its “reverse factoring” with potentially inflated EBITDA from 
unsustainable items.              
 


(2) Additional debt:  If Kellogg chooses to take out additional debt, we believe there is a risk 
that Kellogg’s credit rating may get downgraded; potentially below investment grade.  This 
in turn will negatively impact the ability for Kellogg to run its “reverse factoring” program 
and therefore extend DPO.  Meaning the operating cash flow benefit from extended DPO 
may be greatly reduced and/or eliminated.  In addition, any changes to interest expense 
and/or loan amortization schedules could negatively impact available cash even further.       
 


(3) Dividend cut:   Kellogg could choose to cut its dividend if the Company thought taking out 
additional debt would downgrade its credit rating.       


 
 
We believe any of the above actions or combination of actions could have a materially negative impact on 
Kellogg’s dividend and/or credit rating.

Credit rating agencies provide more clarity on why to include “reverse factoring” in total debt calculations 
As discussed earlier, in its Corporate Ratings Criteria publication, Fitch indicated it would adjust debt for the 
extension in payable days resulting from a reverse factoring transaction.  In its Corporate Methodology Ratios 
and Adjustments publication, S&P also indicated it would make a debt adjustment for a customer if the trade 
payables were well beyond the range of what would be deemed normal trade terms.  In December 2016, 
Moody’s put out a note to revise its cross-sector rating methodology that clarified that reverse factoring 
arrangements are an example of a non-standard adjustment.      
 


This revised cross-sector rating methodology replaces the version with the same name published on 
December 22, 2015. We have 1) clarified that capitalized interest is reclassified from investing cash flow 
to operating cash flow in the cash flow statement; 2) clarified that capitalized development costs, 
other than software, are viewed as an operating expense; and 3) clarified that reverse factoring 
arrangements are an example of a non-standard adjustment. No other changes have been made 
to the content of this methodology.   


Moody’s, Cross-Sector Rating Methodology, 12/21/16 [emphasis added] 
 
Although each of the big three credit rating agencies provided guidance and clarification on how to adjust 
for “reverse factoring” arrangements, none of the current debt calculations for Kellogg from any of the rating 
agencies appear to adjust for the Company’s “reverse factoring.”  We believe if the ratings agencies followed 
their own guidance, Kellogg’s “reverse factoring” would be considered short-term financing.  So, in our total 
debt calculations below, we have included our estimate of the amount of payables with extended DPO (i.e. 
“reverse factored” payables).        
 
Could Kellogg’s credit rating be downgraded? 
We acknowledge that credit ratings are determined by a myriad of factors beyond what is presented in the 
table below, but we also understand certain factors taken into consideration and adjustments made by 
credit analysts are subjective.

Based on discussions with credit analysts at large well known credit ratings agencies and their 
corresponding credit opinions, total debt/EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by the rating agencies to 
assess a company’s credit rating.  Accordingly, we estimate Kellogg’s FY 2017 adjusted total debt/EBITDA is 
4.9x.  Moreover, all of Kellogg’s peers with total debt/EBITDA ratio’s above 4.0x have non-investment grade 
credit ratings.  While a high total debt/EBITDA ratio does not instantly mean Kellogg’s credit rating should be 
downgraded, we do believe it corroborates the fact that Kellogg does not have a lot of capital structure 
flexibility.

Credit agencies anchor Kellogg’s future performance (and credit rating) to the Company’s guidance 
We spoke with a Kellogg credit analyst at one of the big well-known credit rating agencies and found it 
peculiar that future EBITDA expectations were very similar, if not identical, to Kellogg’s guidance.  As a result, 
we specifically asked the Kellogg credit analyst if future EBITDA expectations were anchored to the 
Company’s guidance and he confirmed.  See below for the relevant extract from our conversation:   
 


PP:  With regard to your EBITDA projections, it looks like they’re anchored to management guidance.  Is 
that accurate? 
 
Kellogg credit analyst:  You mean forward view? 
 
PP:  Yes.  
 
Kellogg credit analyst:  Yes   


 
As we already discussed, we believe there are material risks to Kellogg’s FY 2018 revenue and operating margin 
guidance.  If guidance is revised, we believe key credit rating drivers will also need to be adjusted.  So, not only 
do we believe current total debt calculations should be adjusted for the “reverse factoring,” but that future 
EBITDA expectations have material risk to be revised lower.          
 
What could happen if Kellogg’s credit rating is downgraded? 
A non-investment grade or junk rating for Kellogg’s debt could have the following impact: 
 


• Suppliers using K’s credit as collateral in the account payable tracking system may no longer be 
able to reverse factor the obligations (i.e. accounts payable tracking systems is dependent on 
Kellogg’s credit rating). In our view this would over time result in an unwind of Kellogg’s DPO to its 
historical norm, resulting in cash drain.

presciencepoint.com @presciencepoint 
 
 





  
Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) 32 








• Banks factoring K’s accounts receivable could end their monetization and factoring programs.  
 


• The company’s cost of capital and interest expense could increase. 
 
Two recent accounting blow-ups with large reverse factoring programs may be cautionary tales 
Carillion plc (CLLN.L) and Abengoa SA (ABG.MC) both filed for bankruptcy in the last two years after their debt 
loads became too difficult to manage.  Interestingly, both cases caught some investors off guard as balance 
sheet debt levels turned out to be much higher than expected due to massive “reverse factoring” 
arrangements.  While we may not necessarily believe Kellogg is heading down the same path, we do think 
these two situations provide a great example of how “reverse factoring” arrangements can obfuscate 
underlying financials and can occasionally catch investors flat-footed.          


Valuation 


The vast majority of sell-side analysts who cover K anchor their projections to K management’s guidance.  For 
example, the Wall Street consensus estimates for FY 18 non-GAAP earnings is $4.44 compared to K guidance 
of $4.47 at midpoint.  We believe this suggests analysts are not accounting for a range of one-time and/or 
unsustainable items that benefited K over the last three years.  In addition, only 1 out of 14 sell-side analysts 
covering K have discussed the working capital shenanigans that we presented in this report.  As a result, we 
do not believe current estimates properly take into account the potential negative ramifications these 
unsustainable items may have as they unwind.         
 
Price targets and conclusion 
On the surface, K appears to be trading at moderate (maybe even low) valuations relative to peers and 
historical levels; 10.8x FY 2018 EV/EBITDA and 13.5x FY 18 P/E.  However, we believe current enterprise value, 
EBITDA, and earnings do not reflect the true costs of K’s business.  By adjusting these items (as we have 
discussed herein), our price target is $38.82 based on FY 2018 adjusted EV/adjusted EBITDA and $40.22 based 
on FY 2018 price/adjusted earnings.  Accordingly, our blended price target is $39.52, reflecting $35.0 downside 
from the current price.

Some may consider Kellogg “cheap” relative to its historical valuation, but we think it’s a dangerous 
proposition given the issues discussed in this report  
Despite Kellogg trading at the low-end of its 5 year valuation range, we believe is material downside as, 
presented above in our price target estimates.  After adjusting debt, EBITDA, and earnings for the items 
mentioned above, we estimate K is currently trading at 20.4x NTM P/E and 14.2x EV/EBITDA.  Meaning, K is 
trading at the high-end of its P/E range and in the middle of its EV/EBITDA range.

Conclusion 


For a company in the consumer goods space, we believe Kellogg is far too complex. It is apparent to us that K 
management underestimated the structural decline in cereal and non-healthy snacks and thus turned to 
accounting gimmicks, down-weighting its products and Project K to “fix” their issues. These temporary 
measures would only go so far and while the firm has been on track to hit margin estimates based on these 
non-recurring gains, we believe the chickens will finally come home to roost in 2018 and beyond.  
 
We believe it would be wise for new management to take a “big bath” quarter to reset financials and 
expectations. Moreover, we imagine customers (now stuffed with over $1 billion worth of K’s products) will not 
be purchasing products from K until they have liquidated the excess. For Kellogg, this will result in a material 
headwind to sales in 2018 as retailers work through existing product. This weakness will persist until customer 
inventory levels are normalized, at which time Kellogg returns to its natural sales baselines (pre-accounting 
shenanigans). 
 
Strengthening our thesis is the abrupt departures of two high profile executives (John Bryant and Ronald 
Dissinger) at the culmination of their highly touted Project K strategy. Let us be perfectly clear with regards to 
Kellogg and the newly appointed Steve Cahillane. K is in dire straits; new management will not be able to turn 
around the company without facing many of the firm’s accounting issues. In fact, we expect things to get much 
worse for Kellogg as many of the short-sighted accounting gimmicks used will reverse over the next year.

Appendix  


Receivable factoring agreement background 


Receivable Sales Agreement (“Monetization Program”) 
In Q1’2016, Kellogg entered into a “Receivable Sales Agreement” whereby it could sell certain trade accounts 
receivable balances to a third party financial institution up to a maximum amount of $350.0 million.  Amounts 
sold would be de-recognized from the balance sheet.  In Q2’2016, the maximum amount was raised to $550.0 
million.  In Q4’2016, the maximum amount was raised again to $700.0 million.       
 


During the quarter ended April 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Receivable Sales 
Agreement”), to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party 
financial institution.  Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables 
resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The 
Receivable Sales Agreement provides for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving 
basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables that may be 
sold at any time is currently $350 million.   
(Q1’2016 10Q) [emphasis added] 


 
Securitization Program 
In Q2’2016, Kellogg established a $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization program for certain 
customers which will allow for extended payment terms.  In Q3’2016, the program was amended to increase its 
capacity to $400.0 million.  In Q4’2016, the program was amended again to increase its capacity to $600.0 
million.     
 


In addition to the discrete customer program above, we established a $200 million accounts 
receivable securitization program in July 2016 for certain customers which will allow for extended 
customer payment terms.  (Q2’2016 10Q) 


 
International Factoring Program 
In its 2016 10K, Kellogg also highlighted certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries would transfer accounts 
receivable balances of certain customers to financial institutions.  However, Kellogg did not specify the 
maximum capacity for these foreign transfers.

Background on DSD vs. Warehouse Model 


What is a DSD model? 
Accordingly to our conversation with the Director of Strategic Merchandising and Pricing at one of Kellogg’s 
large customers, a DSD model has the following characteristics: 
 


• Is generally used for high volume products 
• Requires a dedicated merchandising team that goes into individual stores and actually puts the 


product on the shelves 
• In some cases, the retail store doesn’t even manage a particular area of the store, it’s left up to the 


supplier (i.e. Kellogg) to stock the shelves  
• DSD models allow companies to “control their own destiny” 


 
What is the warehouse model? 
A warehouse model has the following characteristics: 
 


• Minimal to no merchandising staff that go into individual stores to place products 
• Inventory is shipped from supplier to retailers warehouse  
• The retailer stocks the suppliers product and places it on the shelves  


Background on Changes in Pension Accounting 
Standards 


Changes in the presentation of certain pension accounting standards 
In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) introduced an Accounting Standards Update 
(ASU Topic 715) to improve the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs.  The ASU 
requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other 
compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.  The other 
components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the 
service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations.
