TFS Corporation Limited (ASX: TFC / QIN) (“TFS” or the “Company”), which today rebranded itself as Quintis, claims to 


be the world’s largest manager of commercial Indian sandalwood plantations.  Indian sandalwood produces aromatic 


heartwood, which can be processed for use as timber and oil.  TFS is one of the last remaining publicly-listed agricultural 


Managed Investment Schemes (“MIS”), a dangerous Australian investment structure beset by bankruptcies, investor losses 


and fraud.  Other notable Australian agri-businesses which relied heavily on MIS investors, such as Timbercorp, Great 


Southern, Environinvest, Palandri Wines, Arafura Pearls, Australian Bight Abalone, and Forestry Enterprises Australia, 


collapsed amid allegations of fraud, misleading marketing or Ponzi-like behavior.  The collapse of these MIS companies 


resulted in over AU$ 2 billion in aggregate losses, mostly suffered by Australian investors. 





We believe that TFS will likely follow Timbercorp and Great Southern into ignominy and failure.  In our opinion, TFS’s 


model resembles such collapsed agricultural MIS companies and their Ponzi-like structure: TFS does not generate significant 


cash from sales of its sandalwood, which for the most part has yet to be harvested.  Instead, TFS is reliant on raising capital 


to plant new vintages, operate its business, make payments on its ballooning debts and pay off earlier investors.  Interest 


payments reached 50% of cash EBITDA in FY 2016, and total borrowing has increased by another AU$ 65 million so far in 


FY 2017.  Without access to the capital markets, TFS’s financial statements indicate it will struggle to service its debts, let 


alone repay them.   





We believe that once investors scrutinize TFS’s misleading forecasts, dubious marketing materials and questionable 


customers, TFS will lose the confidence of the capital markets it requires to survive.  Thus, we value TFS’s shares at AU$ 


0.00.   





1. TFS Business Model: Serial Capital Raising on Dubious Promises of Future Profits.  Sandalwood trees take 15-
20 years to grow, meaning producers must wait nearly two decades before realizing any cash flows from the sales of 


the aromatic heartwood.  Despite reporting revenues from establishment fees charged to investors in TFS-managed 


sandalwood plantations, the Company’s reported profitability is driven primarily by ‘non-cash gains’ from the upward 


revaluation of its biological assets (i.e., the trees).  In FY 2016, such non-cash gains from the revaluation of plantations 


accounted for 85% of the Company’s net profit.  Without cash receipts from harvesting and selling sandalwood trees, 


the Company is reliant on the capital markets to operate, plant new vintages and service its debts.  In total, we calculate 


that the Company has raised AU$ 1.4 billion in gross financing to date, with no end in sight.  Without the capital 


markets, TFS could not exist.  But as we will see, we believe that TFS has made a number of highly misleading 


statements and disclosures regarding its projected future cash flows. 





2. Ponzi-Like Marketing Materials.  One of the hallmarks of a Ponzi-scheme is the promise of quick, above-market 
returns, which in practice will be paid not from the sale of any product but with money raised from new investors. In 


this case, we discovered marketing material by a German institutional bank named Jaederberg & Cie (“JC”), which 


characterizes itself as an asset partner of TFS, in which JC offered project level investments in TFS’s vintages from as 


early as 2010.   





Inexplicably, JC’s marketing materials promise that investors in TFS’s plantations will be paid cash dividends starting 


two years after the initial investment, with a full payback of the initial investment promised within seven years 


of the investment date.  There is no possibility that any of such payments can come from the harvesting of sandalwood, 


because the trees are not ready to be harvested until at least 15 years after planting.  The only source of such future 


payments must come from funds raised from future investors (or the capital markets).  To us, this looks like a 


Ponzi scheme, because investors are promised quick, above-average investment returns which in practice will be paid 


not from the sale of a product but from cash raised from future investors.

3. Phantom Chinese Buyer?  One of the festering uncertainties in TFS’s business model is whether there will be a significant 


addressable market for sandalwood once its plantations are ready for harvest.  To allay such fears, in September 2016, TFS 
announced that it completed its first shipment under a “five-year agreement to supply 150 tonnes per annum of processed 


heartwood to China.”  Mysteriously, TFS did not announce the identity of this Chinese buyer, even though it had agreed to 
purchase the equivalent of USD 25 million in sandalwood from TFS per year (50% of TFS’s projected harvests), making the 


mysterious Chinese buyer TFS’s most valuable customer.   


 
a. A Richer Link?  Buried in TFS’s website, written in Chinese, the Company discloses that its exclusive distributor in China 


is an obscure firm named Shanghai Richer Link.  We think that the Company was coy about the identity of its Chinese 


customer because any modicum of due diligence reveals that, far from being a big distributor capable of purchasing such 
vast quantities of sandalwood each year, Shanghai Richer Link is a tiny commodities importer with minimal operations and 


a small balance sheet.    
 


• First, Shanghai Richer Link does not have an operating website.  Without a web presence, how could Shanghai Richer 
Link successfully distribute sandalwood?  





• Second, we called the telephone number for Shanghai Richer Link listed on the TFS website.  In a recorded phone call, 
when we asked the representative from Shanghai Richer Link whether it was the exclusive distributor of sandalwood 


in China for TFS, the representative claimed to be unfamiliar with TFS.  After asking a colleague, she stated that “we 


do not do that business anymore.”  We admit that we could have spoken to a clerical employee who may have been 
confused, but TFS claims on its website that Shanghai Richer Link is its sole and exclusive distributor for sandalwood 


in China – if that is true, why would the employees of Shanghai Richer Link be unfamiliar with the Company or deny 
doing business with TFS?     





• Finally, we reviewed publicly available SAIC filings of Shanghai Richer Link filed by the distributor with the Chinese 
government, which include its historical financials.  SAIC filings showed that in 2015, Shanghai Richer Link reported 
only AU$ 1.7 million in revenues, COGS of AU$ 1.4 million, and profits of only AU$ 25,433.  Likewise, SAIC filings 


showed that Shanghai Richer Link’s cash balance was tiny at CYE 2015 (AU$ 228,352), not even in the universe of 


being able to finance the purchase of 150 tonnes sandalwood from TFS, the equivalent of USD 25 million, per year.   





• Ultimately, it does not appear as if TFS’s highly touted Chinese buyer is capable of purchasing 750 tonnes of 


sandalwood over the next five years.  Rather, it appears to be a tiny importer with no web presence, minimal 


operations, tiny revenues, almost zero profits and a small cash balance insufficient to purchase sandalwood in 


bulk.  In our opinion, TFS has materially mislead investors by announcing that it presold 750 tonnes of sandalwood 
for ~USD 125 million over five years without disclosing that the supposed purchaser (TFS’s exclusive distributor in 
China) does not appear to have the scale, operations or cash to fulfill such a contract.   





b. Come on Eileen.  TFS’s Chinese website also directed buyers of sandalwood oil to contact Mrs. Jingyu (Eileen) Yang 
(“Eileen”).  Her firm, Yitan (Xiamen) Spices Co. Ltd. (“Xiamen Spices”), maintains a website referring to TFS as “our 


partner” and offering sandalwood oil for sale in China.  But SAIC filings reveal that Xiamen Spices reported no revenues 
in 2014 and 2015, and operating expenses of only AU$ 5,618 in 2015.  SAIC filings also indicate that as of December 


31, 2015, Xiamen Spices only had AU$ 6,527 in cash.  Like Shanghai Richer Link, it does not appear that Eileen or 


Xiamen Spices has the balance sheet, meaningful operations or experience to successfully move material amounts of the 
sandalwood oil.   





4. Forecasted Cash Flows Based on Ludicrous Assumptions.  The valuation of sandalwood trees is highly sensitive to a few 
key inputs, including future market price, yield and survivability. Given the length of time between planting and harvest, these 


inputs are inherently difficult to forecast.  In our view, TFS has used the long production cycle and esoteric sandalwood market 
to propagate ridiculously favorable assumptions to investors regarding the future profitability of its plantations.  It continues to 


raise money without accountability because nearly all of its trees have yet to be harvested, meaning it has yet to commercialize 


its product in any meaningful amount.  But accountability is coming.   
 


a. Undisclosed Related Party is the Source of Key Price and Demand Forecasts.  To support its unrealistic forecasts for 
the expected demand and future price of sandalwood, TFS’s marketing presentations rely on a key study by Incipient 
Capital.  But TFS fails to disclose that Incipient Capital, far from being an independent research firm, is a small Dubai-


based merchant bank which was the lead manager in raising $194 million in financing for TFS from 2009 to 2012.  TFS 
also fails to disclose that Incipient Capital’s founding partner, Phillip Shamieh, was simultaneously the CEO of a JV which 


was 49% owned by TFS from 2009-2014, when it was wholly acquired by the Company.  Shamieh claims on his LinkedIn 


page to have worked for TFS from 2009-2016.  Not only do such conflicts of interest undermine the credibility of the data, 
but we believe it is materially misleading for TFS to present critical forecasts to potential investors without disclosing that 


the source is a related party that works and raises money for TFS.

b. Unrealistic Price Forecasts.  The market for Indian sandalwood is thinly-traded and highly opaque, which we believe TFS 
exploits to mislead investors with absurdly optimistic forecasts regarding the future price of sandalwood.   





i. Indian Import Data Suggests Much Lower Prices.  Import data available from Indian customs records show that from 
2014-2016, the weighted average price of imported sandalwood oil was only USD 551 per kg, 80% less than TFS’s 


forecasted future price of USD 2,800 per kg. 


 
ii. TFS Artificially Inflates the Price of Sandalwood and Prevents Market Price Discovery.  Since 2014, each year, the 


Company has purchased MIS-owned sandalwood harvests at auction.  These hectares are managed by TFS but owned 
by its retail and institutional investors.  In theory, MIS-owned trees were supposed be sold at auction after harvest.  Instead, 


TFS raises money from the capital markets to buy the harvested trees.  In one case, it foolishly bragged that it paid 10% 


above the next highest bidder at auction.  In 2016, the Company admitted that it raised AU$ 60.5 million from the equity 
markets to purchase 221 hectares of MIS plantations from retail investors due to be harvested over the next five years.  In 


our view, this is Ponzi-like behavior.  TFS is using funds raised from new investors to buy out previous investors.  In 


doing so, the Company is bidding up the price of sandalwood at auction, thereby artificially inflating the price of the thinly-
traded commodity to justify its own ludicrous price forecasts.     


 
The Company claims it wants to increase exposure to sandalwood, but we suspect that it is purchasing older plantations 


to prevent sandalwood from hitting the open market in significant volume.  We believe that the purpose of buying 


out MIS investors upon harvest is to prevent the establishment of a market price for sandalwood, which we suspect 
would be well below the price used in the Company’s forecasts.   Our suspicion is that the Company is terrified of trees 


hitting the open market at an equilibrium price lower than TFS’s forecasted price, which would not only undermine the 


Company’s future promises of profitability and returns for investors, but would also force the Company to incur dramatic 
write downs in the valuation of its existing plantations. 


 
c. Dubious Yield and Survivability Assumptions.  TFS’s reported “profits” (from non-cash gains) and its marketing materials 


are both based on highly dubious assumptions regarding the heartwood yield and survivability of its sandalwood trees.  


 
i. Academic Studies Report Far Lower Yields.  Academic studies project yields between 4.0 – 6.8 kg per tree.  In FY 


2011, TFS told investors to expect a yield as high as 30 kg per tree, as high as seven times the yield projected by such 
academic research.   





ii. TFS’s Actual Yields are Much Lower than Forecasts.   In 2016, TFS admitted that its actual yields on harvested trees 
were 3.1, 4.9, and less than 9.7 kg per tree (for 2014, 2015 and 2016 harvests, respectively), far below the Company’s 


current forward projection of 19.8 kg per tree.  Actual survival rates from FY 2014 through FY 2016 were 32%, 38%, and 


70%, respectively, which also came in far below the Company’s forecast survival rates of 80-90%.  In addition, the 
Company alerted investors in FY 2016 that 9 of its first 12 vintages (75%) were not growing in line with the yield curve.   


 
iii. The End.  It is highly unreasonable for TFS to forecast a yield of 19.8 kg per tree when the Company’s actual yields are 


between 3-10 kg per tree, and 75% of its first 12 vintages are, by TFS’s own admission, falling behind its projected yield 


curve.  We believe that TFS’s financial statements should project an expected yield of ~10 kg per tree, which would 


be double the reported yield from academic studies and even greater than the Company’s maximum yield on prior 


harvests.  In our opinion, just this simple revision of its yield estimates to a more realistic assumption would cause TFS’s 


scheme to unravel.  First, the Company would be forced to take a write down on the value of its biological assets, a hit to 
its income statement which would correct for ludicrous previous upward re-evaluations.  Second, the Company would 


have to correct misleading cash flow forecasts in its marketing material, which rest on ridiculous yield assumptions.  This 
would make it much harder to raise money for new vintages.  In our opinion, the loss of investor confidence from this 


change in TFS’s forecasts would effectively cut off TFS from the capital markets.    


 
5. Officer and Director Turnover.  Companies engaging in questionable accounting practices or making misleading statements to 


investors often experience high turnover among directors and officers wary of liability or a tarnished reputation once the scheme 


unravels.  Here, the shoe fits, as TFS has experienced a high number of director and officer resignations in recent years. By our 
count, eight officers or directors have resigned since late 2011.  Many have done so after a brief tenure of two years or less.  The 


most notable resignation was Patrick O’Connor, who joined TFS as chairman in September 2013.  O’Connor lasted one year, 
resigning in November 2014.  At the time of his resignation, TFS said that O’Connor would remain on the board, but he resigned 


from his board position a month later.  We consider O’Connor’s quick resignation from both the chairmanship and the board is a 


significant red flag.  Ultimately, high director and officer turnover corroborates our investment opinion that TFS is a troubled 
company.

VALUATION 





TFS is so sensitive to any negative criticism that it unsuccessfully sued Taylor Collison, an Australian broker, in 2015 


because of a bearish analyst note.  In our years as short sellers, we have rarely seen a lawsuit over an analyst note, but such 


sensitivity and litigiousness indicates that TFS is weak and fragile.  No legitimate business would sue over criticism unless 


it was afraid that investors would discover its underlying business was not performing as advertised.  Happily, TFS lost the 


suit, and had to pay Taylor Collison’s legal fees.  





TFS relies on the capital markets for its existence.  It raises money not only to operate its business, but to fund the planting 


of each successive vintage of sandalwood trees.  As discussed in this report, we believe that the Company materially 


misleads investors regarding projected future cash flows by making unrealistic assumptions about the yield and 


survivability of its trees and the future price of sandalwood.   





For a long time, TFS could make misleading disclosures with impunity because the assets take so long to grow, there was 


no evidence to directly contradict the Company’s projections.  But that is changing.  The Company’s first vintages are 


finally coming to maturity, and predictably, yields and survival rates are well below TFS’s ridiculous projections.  


Moreover, the Company now must sell the harvested sandalwood – which we believe, based on the dubious character of 


the supposedly famous “Chinese buyer,” is proving much harder than anticipated.   





In other words, the scheme is unravelling.  The Company has tried to stop the bleeding by buying up early vintages ready 


for harvest (of course, with new money raised from investors), but that practice can only continue for so long.   





TFS is already heavily levered, burns cash at a torrid pace, and cannot function without access to the capital markets.  In 


2016, the Company burned AU$ 60 million in cash, up from AU$ 46 million the previous year.   





 
Source: Company Public Filings 





TFS’s cash flow statements show that the business burns so much cash that it needs to raise money every year to operate.  


As a result, its debts are mounting, and its interest payments are becoming a larger and larger burden.  TFS reported AU$ 


555 million in total financial liabilities as of 1H FY 2017.   





 
Source: Company Public Filings 


 
In FY 2016, TFS’s annual interest payments were AU$ 31 million, accounting for 50% of the Company’s reported cash 


EBITDA.  Such leverage is concerning because the Company’s long wait until it can harvest meaningful amounts of 


sandalwood. The only way that the Company can continue to pay interest on its debt is with new borrowing or project level 


financing, creating a vicious cycle.   





Every investor should do their own homework.  For our part, we calculate that TFS’s liabilities far exceed the value of its 


sandalwood plantations, and that once investors come to realize the misleading nature of TFS’s projections, TFS will 


struggle to access the capital markets.  At that point, we highly doubt that the Company will be able to fully repay its current 


investors, let alone continue to operate for the benefit of shareholders.   





Ultimately, we think this scheme comes to an end in bankruptcy court, much like other Australian agricultural MIS 


companies such as Timbercorp, Great Southern, Environinvest, Palandri Wines, Arafura Pearls, Australian Bight Abalone, 


and Forestry Enterprises Australia, etc.  Accordingly, we value TFS’s equity at AS$ 0.00.

SERIAL CAPITAL RAISING ON DUBIOUS PROMISES OF FUTURE PROFITS 





TFS operates the world’s largest collection of sandalwood plantations, grown primarily throughout the tropical regions 


of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.  The Company funds its plantations through project-


level financing from individual and institutional investors under a Managed Investment Scheme (“MIS”), a uniquely 


Australian investment structure that gives tax breaks for investing in various long duration asset classes, typically 


related to forestry or agriculture.   





Sandalwood’s commercial value is derived from the aromatic heartwood extracted from trees.  The heartwood is used 


in carvings and the oil derived from the heartwood is used principally in China, India and other countries for various 


medicinal, religious and aromatic purposes (such as incense and perfume).  Indian sandalwood has historically been 


grown in India, but due to illegal poaching and restrictions on private ownership and sale, supply in India has been 


declining over the last 30 years.        





The business is difficult because sandalwood plantations are long duration assets.  Sandalwood trees require 15-20 


years or longer to grow before they are harvested.  That means anyone investing in the planting of sandalwood trees 


must wait 15-20 years to realize any cash flows from the sale of the harvested timber.   





Moreover, sandalwood trees are parasitic and require a host tree to grow, making yields and survival rates difficult to 


predict.  As a result, predicting future cash flows from sandalwood trees is an opaque process which is highly sensitive 


to assumptions of future market price, yield and survivability of the trees.   





In our view, TFS uses all of the disadvantages of sandalwood growing (long grow times, thinly-traded end market, 


and unpredictable agricultural outcomes) to its advantage by making misleading forecasts to investors regarding the 


future cash flows from its plantations.  We believe that the Company relies on highly dubious assumptions, neatly 


packaged in marketing materials containing undisclosed conflicts of interest, designed to target unsuspecting 


investors.  But not only do such assumptions form the basis of the Company’s marketing materials, they are the 


foundation for TFS’s reported profits in its publicly filed financial statements.   





The Company’s income statement contains a line item for ‘other income,’ which consists primarily of ‘non-cash gains’ 


from the upward re-evaluation of biological assets (i.e., the trees).  In the following sections, we will discuss 


extensively why the Company, if anything, should be recognizing losses because the yield and survival rate of its 


plantations are coming in far below previous projections.  But for now, we want to point out that such ‘other income’ 


is non-cash, and based entirely on the Company’s (misleadingly optimistic) projections on its success in growing and 


selling sandalwood.  





In FY 2015 and FY 2016, such non-cash gains from the revaluation of plantations accounted for 127% and 85% of 


the Company’s net profit, respectively.

Without cash receipts from harvesting and selling sandalwood trees, the Company is reliant on the capital markets to 


operate, plant and pay off previous investors.  In total, we calculate that the Company has raised AU$ 1.4 billion in 


gross financing to date, with no end in sight:

It is critical for investors to keep in mind that the Company’s profits are not principally derived from cash receipts 


from product sales, but primarily from TFS’s highly questionable estimates of its expected cash flow from the future 


harvest and sale of its trees.  Without access to the capital markets, we believe that TFS would soon run out of cash 


and follow other MIS agri-business like Great Southern and Timbercorp into administration.  To keep the fund raising 


going, we believe that TFS engages in highly questionable marketing, the most egregious example of which we 


discovered in Germany.

PONZI-LIKE MARKETING MATERIALS 





One of the hallmarks of a Ponzi-scheme is the promise of quick, above-market returns, which in practice will be paid 


not from the sale of any product but with money raised from new investors.   





We discovered marketing material by a German institutional bank named Jaederberg & Cie (“JC”), which 


characterizes itself as an asset partner of TFS, in which JC offered project level investments in TFS’s vintages from 


as early as 2010.  The JC marketing materials check many of the boxes of a suspicious investment offering.  The JC 


marketing documents offering an investment in TFS’s sandalwood plantations promise to pay cash dividends starting 


two years after the initial investment with a full payback promised within seven years of the investment date.  


Because sandalwood trees take so long to grow, these payouts to investors must, by definition, come from money 


raised from future investors (or the capital markets).   





For example, in a marketing document for a project referred to as JC Indian Sandalwood 1, JC advises investors that 


although the project is expected to close in December 2011, investors can expect cash dividends of 20%+ in 2013/2014 


and a full payback of their initial investment by 2017/2018, seven years after the trees are planted and presumably 


a decade before they are harvested and can be sold:

According to its website, JC has closed two investment offerings in sandalwood plantations managed by TFS, referred 


to as JC Indian Sandalwood 1 and JC Indian Sandalwood 2.  It is currently in the process of marketing two further 


offerings (JC Eagle Park 4 and JC Sandalwood 5).

The subscription period for JC Indian Sandalwood 1 and JC Indian Sandalwood 2 closed in June 2013, and offered 


investors the opportunity to purchase an interest in three new plantations: Eagle Park, which was planted in Q3 2012, 


Elliot, which was planted in Q2 2013, and Sexton, which was planted in Q2 2013. 





Despite the fact that JC was marketing the chance to invest in three new plantations, the marketing documents 


promised payouts in year two, with a full pay-back of investor money by year seven.

There is no possibility that any of such payments can come from the harvesting of sandalwood because the trees were 


planted in 2012 and 2013, and would not be ready for harvest in such a short time.  The only source of such future 


payments must, by definition, come from funds raised from future investors (or the capital markets).   





JC and TFS show no signs of backing down from such practices.  In marketing materials for the investment referred 


to as JC Eagle Park 4, which is scheduled to close on June 30, 2017, JC offers investors the option of annual payouts 


of 5% or 10% of their investment per annum, starting two years after the initial investment.  In this case, investors are 


offered to purchase a stake in Eagle Park, a 4-year-old plantation, which would be harvested in 2028.

Again, if the trees cannot be harvested until 11 years after the investment, annual payouts to investors, beginning in 


year two, must come from money raised from future investors (or the capital markets).  Such early distributions cannot, 


by definition, come from the sale of the underlying sandalwood.   





That is why we liken TFS’s business model to a Ponzi scheme, because such marketing documents indicate that the 


Company (through brokers like JC) promises investors quick, above-average investment returns which in practice 


will not be paid from the sale of sandalwood but from cash raised from future investors.  Paying off old investors 


with money raised from new investors is the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme, and was exactly the pattern of behavior of 


other failed Australian agricultural managed investment schemes such as Great Southern.

PHANTOM CHINESE BUYER? 





One of the festering uncertainties in TFS’s business model is whether, when its sandalwood plantations finally come 


to maturity, there will be a significant addressable market for the end product.  Perhaps that is why TFS’s stock rallied 


in early 2016 when the Company announced that it signed a multi-year agreement to supply its harvested sandalwood 


to China at “prices broadly equivalent to US$ 4,500 per kg of oil.”  Together with existing contracts, TFS proudly 


announced that it had therefore presold 100% of its 2016 and 2017 harvests (over 300 tonnes).  Curiously, the 


announcement celebrating the contract conspicuously failed to mention the identity of the buyer that agreed to 


purchase such significant amounts of sandalwood.   





In September 2016, TFS followed up by announcing that it received US$ 2.25 million as full payment in advance for 


its first shipment of Indian sandalwood to China, scheduled to ship that fall.  The Company announced that subsequent 


deliveries were “expected to occur monthly.”  In this announcement, TFS clarified that it signed a “five-year 


agreement to supply 150 tonnes per annum of processed heartwood to China.”   





Again, mysteriously, TFS never mentioned the identity of the famous Chinese buyer.  This is a red flag, because this 


mysterious Chinese buyer is TFS’s most important customer, which supposedly contracted to purchase 150 tonnes 


per year of the Company’s harvested sandalwood for the next five years.  By our calculation, this is the equivalent of 


purchasing USD 25 million 1  in sandalwood from TFS each year, a massive undertaking which would require 


significant cash and a strong balance sheet.   





We think that TFS was coy about the identity Chinese buyer because any modicum of due diligence by investors 


would have reveal that the purchaser, far from being a big operation capable of purchasing such vast quantities of 


sandalwood each year, is actually a borderline-distressed commodities importer with minimal operations and a small 


balance sheet.   In our opinion, TFS has materially mislead investors by announcing that it presold 750 tonnes of 


sandalwood for USD 125 million over the next five years to China without disclosing that its exclusive Chinese 


customer does not appear to have the scale, operations or cash to fulfill such a contract.   





1) A Richer Link? 
 


Although the Company fails to mention the identity of its Chinese buyer in its press releases, buried on the TFS 


website,2 TFS discloses in Chinese that its exclusive distributor in China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan) is a 


little-known firm named Shanghai Richer Link, represented by Jerry Hou.

1 Calculated by multiplying 150 tons of heartwood by TFS’s claimed oil yield of 3.7%, which equals 5,550 kg of oil.  At the contract 


price of USD 4,500 per kg, the Chinese buyer supposedly agreed to buy USD 25 million in sandalwood per year from TFS for the 
next five years.  
2 On March 21, 2017, TFS updated its website and removed all Chinese distributor contact information, but the Company’s 


disclosures can still be viewed using the Wayback Machine.

Despite the size of the deal, and the importance of the customer, TFS appears keen to hide the identity of its Chinese 


buyer; because it only discloses that Shanghai Richer Link is its exclusive distributor in China at the bottom of its 


website (and in Chinese).   





Perhaps this is because a closer look at Shanghai Richer Link shows a small, troubled company, which does not appear 


to have an operating business or a balance sheet capable of buying 150 tonnes of TFS’s sandalwood per year from 


TFS.   





The first red flag is that Shanghai Richer Link does not have an operating website, unusual for a supposedly well-


financed importer of commodities.   Using the WayBack Internet archive, we discovered that its website was operating 


as late as March 2016 (around the time of the Company’s big announcement), but as of October 2016, when 


supposedly the first shipment of sandalwood was being delivered by TFS to its mysterious “Chinese buyer,” the 


website was (and remains) shut down.  





 
Source: Shanghai Richer Link Website (www.srlwood.com)  





This raises an obvious question: how can TFS’s sole distributor in China re-sell the Company’s product without even 


a minimal web presence?  How do Chinese firms wanting to purchase sandalwood find Shanghai Richer Link – a 


roadside billboard?  





In order to channel check the legitimacy of TFS’s (supposedly) biggest customer, we called the phone number for 


Shanghai Richer Link listed on the TFS website.   





On a recorded call, we asked if Shanghai Richer Link was the exclusive distributor for TFS.  The person who picked 


up the phone for Shanghai Richer Link seemed confused and was unfamiliar with TFS.  She turned to a colleague, 


asked “what is TFS?”  She then stated on the recorded call that “we don’t engage in that business anymore.”   





We admit that we could have spoken to a clerical employee who may have been confused, but TFS claims on its 


website that Shanghai Richer Link is its sole and exclusive distributor for sandalwood in China – if that is true, why 


would the employees of Shanghai Richer Link be unfamiliar with TFS or deny doing business with the Company?

Next, we reviewed the publicly available SAIC filings of Shanghai Richer Link which the distributor filed with the 


Chinese government, which includes its historical financials.  SAIC filings showed that in 2015, Shanghai Richer Link 


reported only RMB 7.8 million (AU$ 1.7 million) in revenues, COGS of RMB 6.6 million (AU$ 1.4 million), and 


profits of only RMB 120,020 (AU$ 25,433).   





In 2015, Shanghai Richer Link purchased less than AU$ 1.6 million of supplies, commodities or goods.  Why should 


anyone believe that it is capable of buying USD 25 million in sandalwood from TFS every year for the next five years?  


 
Source: Shanghai Richer Link SAIC Filings 





SAIC filings also showed that Shanghai Richer Link’s cash balance at the beginning of 2016 was tiny, RMB 1 million 


(AU$ 228,352), not even in the universe of being able to finance the purchase of 150 tonnes per year of TFS’s 


upcoming sandalwood harvests.   





We find it highly unlikely that Shanghai Richer Link, with the cash balances disclosed on its historical balance sheets, 


could ever afford to make such significant purchases from TFS.   





Shanghai Richer Link’s balance sheet even suggests that the distributor is almost in a distressed situation.  At CYE 


2015, it reported RMB 5 million (AU$ 1 million) in payables, which is four times the amount of cash on its balance 


sheet and 40 times its reported profits the previous year.

TFS Corporation Ltd. / Quintis│ ASX: TFC / QIN                          www.glaucusresearch.com 








Judging by Shanghai Richer Link’s income statement and balance sheet, it does not appear as if TFS’s highly touted 


Chinese buyer is capable of purchasing 150 tonnes of Indian sandalwood over the next five years.  Rather, it appears 


to be a borderline distressed business with no web presence, minimal operations, tiny revenues, almost zero profits 


and a small cash balance insufficient to purchase sandalwood in bulk.   





We believe that TFS has deliberately misled investors by announcing a giant contract in which it claimed to have pre-


sold 150 tonnes of sandalwood per year into China without disclosing the paltry operations and tiny assets of its 


exclusive Chinese distributor.   





2) Come on Eileen 
 


The Company’s Chinese website also mentioned another sales agent, Mrs. Yang Jingyu (Eileen) (“Eileen”), and 


directed any interested Chinese buyers to contact her to purchase sandalwood oil.  Our due diligence reveals that 


Eileen is the legal representative of a Chinese company called Yitan (Xiamen) Spices Co. Ltd. (“Xiamen Spices”).3 





The official website of Xiamen Spices suggests it also acts as a Chinese distributor for TFS, referring to TFS as “our 


company” and advertising the sale of large amounts of sandalwood oil:  





                                                             
3 In the last month, TFS appears to have dropped any reference to Eileen on its website.  But the website of Xiamen Spices still 


claims to be a TFS partner and reseller of sandalwood oil.

We reviewed the publicly available SAIC filings of Xiamen Spices and found that, much like Shanghai Richer Link, 


Xiamen Spices is a tiny business with limited operations.  





Founded in September 2014, Xiamen Spices reported no revenues in 2014 and 2015, and operating expenses of 


only AU$ 5,618 in 2015.  SAIC filings also indicate that as of December 31, 2015, Xiamen Spices only had AU$ 


6,527 in cash.   Below is a summary of the financials contained in Xiamen Spices SAIC filings.  See Appendix I for

Xiamen Spices, the Chinese operating entity affiliated with Eileen, appears to be a tiny company with almost no assets, 


expenses or operations.   





We highly doubt that either Xiamen Spices or Shanghai Richer Link can actually follow through and purchase the 


Company’s future harvests in the amount claimed by TFS (150 tonnes per year).  Rather, we believe that TFS has 


deliberately misled investors by announcing a grand and sweeping contract to sell into China without disclosing either 


the identity or the paltry operations and assets of its supposed Chinese customers.

FORECASTED CASH FLOWS BASED ON LUDICROUS ASSUMPTIONS 





The sandalwood agri-business is difficult because the plantations are long duration assets.  Sandalwood trees require 


15-20 years or longer to grow before they are harvested.  Moreover, sandalwood trees are parasitic and require a host 


tree, making growth challenging and unpredictable. 





The net present value of sandalwood trees is therefore highly sensitive to a few key inputs, including price, yield and 


survivability. Given the length of time between planting and harvest, these inputs are inherently difficult to forecast.  





In our view, TFS has used the long production cycle and esoteric sandalwood market to propagate ridiculously 


favorable assumptions to investors regarding the future profitability of its trees.  It continues to raise money without 


accountability because its trees have for the most part yet to be harvested.  But winter, as they say, is coming, and 


there is significant evidence to suggest that the Company’s projections are misleading and that its trees are worth far 


less than the Company tells investors.   





1. Undisclosed Related Party is the Source of Key Price and Demand Forecasts  
 


One of the key components of TFS’s marketing presentations to potential investors in its plantations is a slide 


forecasting the future demand for sandalwood.  This is obviously a critical foundation of the investment proposition 


because TFS advertises booming future demand for sandalwood, even though it expects to flood the market with the 


commodity.  In its 2016 presentation to investors, the only source of TFS’s critical demand forecast is a study by 


Incipient Capital, which TFS cites in very fine print at the bottom of its key slide.     





 
Source: TFS 2016 Project Level Finance Presentation 





But TFS fails to disclose that Incipient Capital, far from being an independent research firm, is a small Dubai-based 


merchant bank which, according to its website, was the lead manager in raising $194 million in financing for TFS 


from 2009 to 2012.

We believe that it is materially misleading for TFS to include a critical slide in its marketing presentations about the 


future demand for sandalwood and conceal from investors that the source of the data is an investment bank which 


profits from selling TFS’s sandalwood plantations to prosepctive investors.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.   





TFS also fails to mention that Incipient Capital is an undisclosed related party.  We discovered that Phillip Shamieh, 


co-founder and director of Incipient Capital, became the CEO and non-executive director of Gulf Natural Supply in 


2009.4  Gulf Natural Supply was a joint venture, 49% owned by TFS from 2009 until TFS bought the remaining 51% 


in 2014, making Gulf Natural a wholly-owned subsidiary.5  





In other words, the founding partner of Incipient Capital, whose research is cited as the only source for forecasts of 


future sandalwood demand in TFS’s 2016 marketing presentation, was not only the founder of an investment 


bank raising money for the Company, but was simulatenously the CEO of one of TFS’s JVs/subsidiaries from 2009 


through January 2016.  On Shamieh’s LinkedIn page, he claims to have worked for TFS from 2009-2016, the period 


during which TFS was using Shamieh’s Incipient Capital to raise money.

he was the founder and director of Incipient Capital, a Dubai-based bank which was raising money for TFS.  At the 


same time, Incipient Capital was the source of the key study of future sandalwood demand that TFS relies on in its 


marketing presentations to potential investors, without (to our knowledge) disclosing the relationship between TFS, 


Incipient, Wise-owl and Shamieh, which are deeply intertwined.   





We believe that it is materially misleading for TFS to present Incipient Capital’s key demand forecasts in its marketing 


presentations without disclosing such massive conflicts of interest to prospective investors.   





In addition, we suspect that TFS’s reported non-cash gains, which make up a major portion of the Company’s reported 


“profits,” must also rely on the study by Incipient Capital and the demand forecasts contained therein.  TFS’s forecasts 


are the basis for the upward re-valuation of its plantations, which ensures that at least on paper, TFS tells shareholders 


that it turns a profit.  Yet such reported profits rely on a study conducted by an undisclosed related party, which should 


undermine investor confidence in the sanctity of those figures.   





Unbelievably, this is not the only massive undisclosed conflict of interest in TFS’s marketing documents.  TFS 


marketing presentations also cite two other slides about the market price of sandalwood, the source of which is Dr. 


Anantha Padmanabha.

6 We find this key price chart in TFS’s presentation to be highly questionable.  The chart purports to show the fabulous 
prices attained at auction for Indian sandalwood, but buried in the fine print, TFS discloses that the prices shown are 


for wild Indian sandalwood, which has higher oil content than managed plantations.  The slide does not disclose 


historical auction prices for plantation sandalwood, except to note that in August 2015 it “achieved” a sales price of 


USD 123,000 per tonne.  This slide fails to give any context for the August 2015 price, whether it was (as we suspect) 


a market high, or in line with historical pricing.

Ultimately, we think it is highly misleading to market to potential investors on the back of critical price data and 


demand forecasts without disclosing the massive conflicts of interests between TFS and the sources of such 


information.  It makes the TFS marketing process look absolutely rotten.  Especially so if we scrutinize the highly 


dubious price forecasts which are so critical to TFS’s ability to attract shareholders, creditors and project level 


financing.   





2. Unrealistic Price Forecasts 
 


Sandalwood is a highly opaque, thinly traded market.  Estimating the trading prices of liquid commodities like gold 


or coal in 15-20 years is inherently difficult – estimating future prices of commodities which barely trade is near 


impossible.  In our view, TFS exploits this inefficiency to propagate absurdly optimistic assumptions regarding the 


future price of sandalwood to raise money from unsuspecting retail and institutional investors.   





For starters, even TFS’s internal model appears inconsistent.  In investor presentations to secure project level 


financing, TFS advertises a price of $4,500 per kg: 








Source: TFS 2015 Project Level Financing Marketing Brochure 





TFS states that it executed a forward contract with an initial price of US$ 4,500 per kg, but does not say anything 


about the details of this contract or whether the price is subject to change based on market conditions.  We reviewed 


the marketing brochure, and this appears to be the only price quoted in the presentation, which would lead a reasonable 


investor to conclude that this was the forecasted future price.   





But other TFS corporate filings, including the press release to announce 2015 earnings and the Company’s 2016 


annual report, use a forward price of US$ 2,800 per kg:

Source: Company Annual Report 2016 





This begs the obvious question: if the assumed forward price of sandalwood oil is USD 2,800 per kg, why are the 


Company project level investment brochures advertising a price of USD 4,500 per kg? We believe that at the very 


least, the Company’s projections should be internally consistent, and that project level brochures are highly misleading 


because they advertise a much higher price. 





This is supposedly the initial price for future deliveries under the Nestle contract.  But it is highly misleading to 


advertise the highest price for a product rather than the average price at which the Company values the entire 


plantation.  In the U.S., this is called cherry picking, and is strictly prohibited.  It arises in the context where a hedge 


fund or private equity fund advertises only its top performing investment and fails to disclose the overall performance 


of the total portfolio.  Yet this practice is just the tip of the iceberg.   





a) Indian Import Data Suggests Much Lower Prices 
 


Independent customs data suggests that the market price for sandalwood oil is far below the Company’s projections.  


Import data from India, a key sandalwood market, shows that 19,004 kg of sandalwood oil (all types) were imported 


into the country in 2016.  The weighted average price for such imports was USD 714 per kg, 75% below TFS’s 


forecasted future price of USD 2,800 per kg.   





This represents an increase over 2014 and 2015, when the average price of imported sandalwood oil into India was 


USD 457 and 529 per kg, respectively.   





 
Note: we take into account the imported batches with quantity over 100 kg.  


Source: 1. India's Sandalwood Oil Import Data 


2. Foreign exchange rate of USD/INR in 2014, 2015, 2016 





The weighted average price over the last three years (2014 – 2016) was USD 551 per kg, significantly below the 


Company’s projected future price.  India is one of the primary markets for sandalwood products, using the oil in 


incense and for religious and medicinal purposes.  The fact that India is importing sandalwood oil at prices well below 


TFS’s forecast price undermines the credibility of the Company’s forecasts.   





Such prices also portend badly for TFS because the sandalwood market is likely to be oversaturated.  The Company 


estimates that its harvests will be so large that the size of the sandalwood market will increase to twelve times its 


current size by 2025 (with TFS projecting that it will supply 75% of the demand).7  The basic rules of economics 


suggest that scarcity increases prices.  When available supply increases, why should investors expect the price to 


increase?  If sandalwood behaves like other commodities, a supply glut will force prices down, not up.

All this is to say that if sandalwood oil is being imported to India, the key market, for USD 551 per kg in the period 


from 2014 to 2016, we find it highly unlikely that the Company will receive five times this price when it floods the 


market with sandalwood in the future.8  





b) TFS Artificially Inflates the Price of Sandalwood and Prevents Market Price Discovery 
 


TFS exacerbates the problem of price discovery because the Company has been buying up its early vintages which 


have come up for harvest from retail MIS owners.  In our view, this artificially inflates the price of sandalwood and 


hinders price discovery by preventing harvested sandalwood from hitting the open market.   





In 2014, the Company stupidly bragged that it had bid 10% above the market price to buy its sandalwood from 


TFS-managed/MIS-owned plantations at an auction (the sandalwood was owned by retail MIS investors but the 


plantations were managed by TFS):  





 
Source: Company FY14 Full Year Results Presentation 





The Company bragged about paying 10% above the next highest bidder for sandalwood at auctions, but this seems 


like highly destructive and self-serving behavior.  Because TFS is reliant on the capital markets to finance its 


operations, we can safely infer that TFS, by buying out harvests from MIS investors, is essentially using new money 


from investors, shareholders or creditors, to pay off old investors.  This is reminiscent of Great Southern and other 


failed Australian managed investment schemes.    





Furthermore, the Company stupidly admitted that it was overpaying to buy out investors in its early vintages.  Why 


would it waste investor money by bidding 10% above the next closest bid?  





Our suspicion is that the Company is bidding up the value of sandalwood at such auctions to claim, in annual reports, 


project level disclosures and marketing brochures that the price of sandalwood is higher than it would 


otherwise be.

In 2015 and 2016, TFS continued to buy the harvested wood from TFS-managed plantations that were owned by MIS 


investors.  In 2015, the Company paid AU$ 123 per kg of heartwood, well above the 2014 price of AU$ 100 per kg.  


In 2016, the Company appears to have bid up the price again, stating that it bought all of the wood harvested from 


vintages owned by MIS investors at AU$ 131 per kg, a 6% increase over the previous year.

Keep in mind that TFS does not yet receive meaningful cash flows from the sale of sandalwood, because most of its 


trees have yet to be harvested.  So when TFS brags about bidding up the price of sandalwood and buying out MIS 


investors, it is doing so with money raised from new TFS investors, shareholders and creditors.  And this questionable

behavior is accelerating.  In 2016, the Company announced that it had used money raised from the capital markets to 


buy out previous high-net worth investors in its plantations: 





 
Source: 2016 MIS Buy-Back and Capital Raising Presentation 





In a supplemental disclosure, TFS admitted that it raised AU$ 60.5 million from the equity markets to purchase the 


221 hectares of retail grower interests due to be harvested over the next five years:  





 
Source: Company Annual Report 2016 





In our view, this is Ponzi-like behavior.  TFS is using funds raised from new investors to buy out earlier MIS investors.   





The Company claims it wants to increase exposure to sandalwood, but we suspect that it is purchasing older plantations 


to prevent sandalwood from hitting the open market in significant volume and avoid the establishment of a 


market price for sandalwood, which we suspect would be well below the price used in the Company’s forecasts.    





Our suspicion is that the Company is terrified of trees hitting the market and selling at a price materially lower than 


its internal valuations, which would not only undermine the Company’s future promises of profitability and returns 


for investors but would also force the Company to incur dramatic write downs in the valuation of its existing 


plantations.

Furthermore, each year, the Company has bid up the price of sandalwood.  Recall that in 2014, the Company bragged 


that it paid 10% more than the next bidder for the harvest, demonstrating that it was wasting investor cash to drive up 


the price of sandalwood, to its own benefit.  Although TFS does not provide details about the “auctions” held for MIS 


owned sandalwood trees in 2015 and 2016, the Company did pay a higher price each year.  Without details of the 


auctions it is impossible to know for sure, but we suspect that the Company was outbidding other bidders (if there 


were any) in 2015 and 2016 to drive up the price of the commodity.   





Sandalwood is so thinly traded that even a few price points can distort forecasts.  We suspect that the market values 


sandalwood at well below the Company’s projected price, and that TFS uses gimmicks like bidding up the price of 


the sandalwood at auctions to justify its own unrealistically optimistic projections. 





By artificially driving up the price of sandalwood, TFS does not have to revise downward its revenue forecasts (and 


does not have to restate its financials) due to lower-than-expected yields.  Rather, its absurd price forecasts, founded 


on its own practice of bidding up prices at auction, allow TFS to continue to appear “profitable” in its annual reports 


and continue to make ludicrous promises of future cash flows to prospective investors.   





3. Dubious Yield and Survivability Assumptions 
 


The other highly questionable assumptions underpinning TFS’s projection of future cash flows are the Company’s 


forecasts of heartwood yield and the survival rate of its trees.  These assumptions underpin both the Company’s 


marketing materials (upon which it relies to secure new “revenues” from establishment fees charged to successive 


rounds of new investors) and non-cash gains recognized on its income statement from the upward reevaluation of the 


value of the Company’s plantations.   





a. Academic Studies Report Far Lower Yields 
 


TFS’s heartwood yield forecasts deviate significantly from key academic studies, which project a heartwood yield of 


4.0-6.8 kg/tree for Indian sandalwood trees.  By comparison, TFS has told investors to expect a heartwood yield as 


high as 30 kg per tree, as high as seven times the yield found in independent academic studies.

tree at 12% moisture content to 6.8kg per tree at 25% moisture content

In 2011, TFS conducted a “trial harvest” and reported that its projected sandalwood yields broadly matched its 


forecasted yields of 25.0 kg per tree.  But investors should note that the trees in the trial study were harvested at age 


19-23, and not age 15, when the Company expects to harvest most of its plantations.  Moreover, few details were 


provided to investors regarding the trial study. Without more information, it is difficult to make heads or tails of this 


trial harvest, but we do not believe that a study conducted by a company with a massive financial incentive in the 


outcome is a persuasive authority when compared to independent academic studies. 





Independent studies also undermine the Company’s projected survival rate for its trees.  TFS projects an 80 to 90% 


survival rate for its sandalwood plantations.  Yet an independent report by Deloitte in 2013, stated that mortality rates 


were much higher, and that survival rates experienced by Elders Forestry over the course of eleven years were only 


40% on average.   





 
Source: Deloitte - Elders Independent Expert Report (2013) 





The Deloitte report notes that while Elders Forestry, like TFS, targeted an 84% survival rate at establishment, in 


reality, less than half of the trees survived to maturity.  





b. Internally Inconsistent and Arbitrary Yield Forecasts 
 


The valuable commodity in sandalwood trees is the aromatic heartwood.  In its annual report, the Company reports a 


forecasted weighted average heartwood yield for its plantations, which is an estimate of the amount of heartwood that 


the Company expects to extract from each sandalwood tree.   





To give investors an idea of just how arbitrary TFS’s forecasts can be, in the Company’s FY 2011 annual report, it 


estimated a weighted average yield as high as 30 kg per tree.9  Each year thereafter, as its plantations matured, TFS 


has revised downwards its weighted average yield assumption.  In FY 2016, the Company’s yield assumption dropped 


to 19.6 kg per tree.

The changing yield curve is a major red flag.  In FY 2011, the Company was marketing projects to investors based on 


a blended forecast of 27.5 kg per tree, only to systemically lower the yield once vintages came up for harvest.  In the 


first half of FY 2017, the Company reported a blended average yield of 19.8 kg per tree, 28% lower than in FY 2011, 


likely much to the chagrin of the investors who gave money for project level financing in FY 2011 or before.   





We think that the Company should have recognized losses from the downward revaluation of its forecasted yields – 


after all, future cash flows will be negatively impacted by lower than expected volumes.  But TFS never did, because, 


not coincidentally, as the Company lowered its estimated yields, it raised its estimate of the future market price of 


sandalwood. 





 
Source: Company Public Filings 





As discussed above, such future price forecasts are unreliable, prone to manipulation by the Company, and based on 


forecasts from a Dubai merchant bank raising money for TFS.  The weighted average yield reported in TFS’s annual 


reports is also inconsistent with its project level disclosures on the TFS website.  On the project level, the Company 


models that its trees will yield up to 15.7 kg of heartwood per tree, and survivability estimates as high as 90%.

We think it is odd that the Company forecasts a weighted average yield of 19.6 kg per tree when, on a per project 


basis, the highest yield estimate is 15.7 kg per tree.   Whichever projections you choose, weighted average or project 


level, there is ample reason to be skeptical of TFS’s projections.   





c. TFS’s Actual Yields and Survival Rate are Much Lower than Forecasts. 
 


More damming, TFS’s forecasts are also inconsistent with the yield and survival rate actually realized on TFS’s 


harvested vintages. 





In TFS’s 2016 management presentation accompanying its interim results, it disclosed that the actual yield on 


harvested trees in 2014 and 2015 has been 3.1 and 4.9 kg per tree, far below its consensus forward projection of ~19-


30 kg per tree.  Actual survival rates (32%-38%) also came in far below the Company’s forecast survival rates of 80-


90%.    


 
Source: Company Public Filings 





TFS disclosed that its most recent harvest (2016), the heartwood yield was less than 9.7 kg per tree, better than previous 


performance, but still 50% less than the Company’s current weighted average projections.

In addition, the following disclosure has begun to appear in project level accounts for TFS’s vintages in 2002, 2003, 


and 2005-2010:10 





 
Source: https://quintis.com.au/media/1594/tfs-2010_project-accounts_fy16.pdf 





Beginning in 2016, TFS included this disclosure in the documents for 9 of its first 12 vintages, meaning 75% of its 


first twelve vintages are not growing in line with the Company’s projected yield curve.  This disclosure was not 


included in prior years, indicating that such “deviations” from the projected yield curve are occurring as the trees 


mature.   





It seems highly unreasonable for TFS to be using a yield forecast of 19.8 kg per tree when the Company’s 75% of its 


first 12 vintages are by TFS’s own admission falling behind its projected yield curve.    





We believe that TFS’s financial statements should project an expected yield of ~10 kg per tree, which would be 


almost double the yield predicted by academic studies and higher than any yield TFS has achieved on any 


plantations harvested to date.   





If TFS revised its yield forecast to a more realistic figure, we believe that the Company would be cut off from the 


capital markets.  First, the Company would be forced to take a write down on the value of its biological assets, a hit 


to its income statement which would correct for ludicrous previous upward revaluations.  Second, the Company 


would have to correct misleading yield projections in its marketing materials, making it significantly more difficult to 


raise money for future plantations.  A revision of a simple, unreasonable yield assumption, and the Company’s 


financial statements and marketing materials would, in our view, completely unravel.

OFFICER AND DIRECTOR TURNOVER 





Companies engaging in questionable accounting practices or making misleading statements to investors often 


experience high turnover among directors and officers wary of liability or a tarnished reputation once the scheme 


unravels.  The director of a public company is usually a cushy job, so it is a red flag when they resign in droves.  In 


this case, the shoe certainly fits, as TFS has experienced an unusually high number of director and officer resignations 


in recent years.  








By our count, eight officers or directors have resigned since late 2011.  Many have done so after a brief tenure of two 


years or less.   





Perhaps the most notable resignation was Patrick O’Connor, who joined TFS as chairman in September 2013.  


O’Connor lasted one year, resigning in November 2014.  At the time of his resignation, TFS said that O’Connor would 


remain on the board, but he resigned from his board position a month later in December 2015.  We consider 


O’Connor’s quick resignation from both the chairmanship and the board is a significant red flag.  Ultimately, high 


director and officer turnover, corroborates our investment opinion that TFS is a troubled company.

VALUATION  
 


TFS is so sensitive to any negative criticism that it unsuccessfully sued Taylor Collison, an Australian broker, in 2015 


because of a bearish analyst note.  In our years as short sellers, we have rarely seen a lawsuit over an analyst note, but 


such sensitivity and litigiousness indicates, in our opinion, that TFS is weak and fragile.  No legitimate business would 


sue over criticism unless it was afraid that investors would discover its underlying business was not performing as 


advertised.  Happily, TFS lost the suit, and had to pay Taylor Collison’s legal fees.  





TFS relies on the capital markets for its existence.  As discussed in this report, we believe that the Company materially 


misleads investors regarding projected future cash flows by making unrealistic forecasts about the yield and 


survivability of its trees and the future price of sandalwood.  





For a long time, TFS could make misleading disclosures with impunity because the assets take so long to grow, there 


was no evidence to directly contradict the Company’s ludicrous projections.  But that is changing.  The Company’s 


first vintages are coming due for harvest, and predictably, yields and survival rates are well below TFS’s ridiculous 


projections.  Moreover, the Company now must sell the harvested sandalwood – which we believe, based on the 


dubious character of the supposedly famous “Chinese buyer,” is proving much harder than anticipated.   





TFS is already heavily levered, burns cash at a torrid pace, and cannot function without access to the capital markets.  


In 2016, the Company burned AU$60 million, up from AU$46 million the previous year.   





 
Source: Company Public Filings 





TFS’s cash flows show that the business burns so much cash that it needs to raise money every year to operate.  As a 


result, its debts are mounting, and its interest payments are becoming a heavy burden.  TFS reported AU$ 555 million 


in total financial liabilities as of 1H FY 2017.   





 
Source: Company Public Filings 


 
In FY 2016, TFS’s annual interest payments were AU$31 million, accounting for 50% of the Company’s reported 


cash EBITDA.  Such leverage is concerning because of the Company’s long wait until it can harvest meaningful 


amounts of sandalwood. The only way that the Company can continue to pay interest on its debt is with new borrowing 


or project level financing, a vicious cycle.   





Investors should of course do their own homework, but for our part, we estimate that TFS’s liabilities far exceed the 


value of its sandalwood plantations.  We believe that once investors come to realize the misleading nature of TFS’s 


projections, its questionable marketing materials and dubious Chinese “customers,” TFS will struggle to access the 


capital markets.  At that point, we highly doubt that the Company will be able to service its debts, let alone continue 


to operate for the benefit of shareholders.   





Ultimately, we think this scheme comes to an end in bankruptcy court, much like other Australian agricultural MIS 


companies such as Timbercorp, Great Southern, Environinvest, Palandri Wines, Arafura Pearls, Australian Bight 


Abalone, and Forestry Enterprises Australia, etc...

The collapse of these MIS companies resulted in over AU$2 billion in aggregate investor losses.  We believe that TFS

AS$ 0.00.
