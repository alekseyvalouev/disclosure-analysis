WHAT THE BANK SAYS VS
WHAT THE BANK DOES


  ** Post-publication afterthought:


 


To demonstrate just how stupid this is, if
this $400 million dollar non-collateralized,
personally guaranteed signature loan is to
be believed, it is Citron's belief that it would
be the largest single unsecured
signature loan ever issued by any bank.


Citron challenges anyone to document a
larger loan by any bank in any country in
the world on similar terms.


 


   It's official!  Well, sort of ….


Today Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) files
its latest document in the unfolding soap
opera of whether it can complete its private
takeover transaction announced last
October.


It includes a sizable boilerplate document
from China Development Bank purporting to
document the extension of a $400 million
credit facility that allegedly provides the

financing so the Chairman Tianfu Yang can
take HRBN private at $24 a share.


While the document appears really
impressive, it says almost nothing about
security for the transaction.  The entire
structure of the loan depends on the
personal guarantee of Chairman Tianfu Yang
and Ms. Luo Qian. 


Now we know banks in China in the past
have been loose with lending.  But a $400
million dollar loan based on a personal
guarantee, when they wouldn’t lend more
than $50 million (with a huge spiral pledge
of stock to collateralize it)  just six months
ago? 


We don't think so!  


In China, you can not get a $400 million
dollar loan because you know
someone.  But you can get a
commitment letter for a $400 million
dollar loan if you know someone.


   Nice and Simple


If this deal is so simple the Chairman can
just finance it with a simple signature loan,
why didn't he do it last fall when it was
announced?  He didn't need Barings, he
didn't need Morgan Stanley, he didn't need
Goldman Sachs, and he didn't need Bain. 
He didn't need 7 months of deliberations by
a "Special Committee".  It would be done by
now, and the stockholders would have been
delighted.


   Today’s Headlines in China


This week, China’s leading business
magazine, Caijing, publishes its cover story
on China stock frauds.

 In this article they quote me, Andrew Left,
editor or Citron Research, referencing my
work uncovering the many frauds among
Chinese companies with US stock listings. 
You might not be aware that I have been
writing on stock fraud for 10 years.  I
uncovered my first China stock fraud over 4
years ago (XFML).  Since then I have
covered 11 others.  All but 1 are down an
average of 80% from the time of first
publication.  One is halted, two have been
delisted, and one has seen criminal
indictment against management — with
many more to come, we suspect.


 


I am just getting warmed up.  Citron is now
asking the investing public to think out the
story of HRBN for yourself.  See if you come
to the same conclusions as regulators,
investors, grand juries, and media on the
prior opinions of Citron Research.


It is Citron’s opinion that  Harbin
Electric is deceiving the public.  If the
stock does not get halted for its
numerous SEC violations, we believe it
is at best a $5 stock.


   THIS IS NOT FINANCING…THIS IS A
CHARADE


THIS IS MISLEADING TO INVESTORS
AND IS AN ACT OF A DESPERATE
COMPANY.  Look at this simple timeline:

HRBN announces a $24/ share
buyout by the CEO and Baring
Private Equity — with no 8-K
filed and no terms attached.


Goldman Sachs Private Equity
Asia Group announced as
financial advisor to the
acquisition vehicle.


Nov 22,
2010


The company borrows $50
million from China
Development Bank.  In an odd
move, the bank does not
securitize the loan with
company assets, but rather
the Chairman’s stock – 7
million shares — $130 million
in stock – for a $50 million
dollar loan


Nov 23,
2010


Barings backs out of the
proposed management
buyout.


 Goldman Sachs’ Private
Equity Asia Group role revised
to “advisor to Chairman
Yang”.


Apr 15,
2011


Phone call between Chairman
and William Blair analyst – for
which an 8-K was
subsequently filed – because
Chairman stated he was
making a bid for the company
the following Monday –


No such bid was ever
made.

Company files 10-Q for Q1
2011, reporting drastically
compressed margins and
lowered earnings, and
reducing guidance.


May 12,
2011


SEC 13D filed, stating the
HRBN board received a formal
proposal – yet no 8-K was
ever filed with the
proposal terms.  It is in this
13D that we read about the
aforementioned alleged
financing, with no
documentation of terms of the
agreement.


 


And now today, we get a SC13D, and all it
says is that the Chairman proposes to
finance this transaction with …… drum
roll…..a signature loan! 


Now it is time for everyone to think….simple
common sense…the same common sense
that has guided Citron's reporting to be one
of the premier destinations for finding
information about deceptive China stocks.


 


At first we thought the financing was coming
from Baring, but it took them less than a
month to back away.  The company then
said they are working with Goldman Sachs,
who undoubtedly has access to capital at the
snap of a finger for a legitimate LBO, but
nothing happens there.  And here is what we
hang our hat on.


 


The alleged financing is now a commitment
letter for $400 million from China
5/18/2018 What the Bank Says vs What the Bank Does – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/what-the-bank-says/ 6/9


Development Bank, the same bank which
lent Chairman Yang $50 millon in
November.  Yet, this existing loan was not
made with the company, rather its proceeds
purportedly go to Chairman Yang’s
company, Tech Full, based in the Cayman
Islands and recently domiciled in Nevada.  It
is no more than a holding company that
holds stock. 


And now this new loan, 8 times the size,  is
supposedly based only on his personal
guarantee plus Ms. Luo Qian?


 


So let us see what has changed
between the first financing and the
second (alleged) with the SAME BANK.


 


China stock fraud has moved from the
blogosphere to front page of WSJ and
mainstream China and Hong Kong press.


Over 20 Chinese RTO’s have been
halted and/or delisted and only a few
have reopened.  Therefore anyone with
loans outstanding collateralized by shares
in any of these stocks is up the Yangtze
River without a paddle.


HRBN’s auditor has been disbanded after
being charged with fraud by the SEC.


The chairman of HRBN’s audit committee
(and also the chairman of the “Special
Committee” overseeing this deal) has
been sued for a fraudulent transfer by
the bankruptcy trustee of his former
employer.


The company has reported lower
earnings with negative cash flow.


It has come to the attention of the
investing world that HRBN’s SAIC
documents show substantial liabilities
never reported by its auditors in its SEC
5/18/2018 What the Bank Says vs What the Bank Does – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/what-the-bank-says/ 7/9


filings.


Baring Private Equity walked away from
financing the deal


The mighty Goldman Sachs was not able
to find financing for the deal


So the company is back to square one –
with the bank who lent them $50 million in
November. 


Now let’s assume for a moment that China
Development Bank does not have internet
and does not know how to read the news in
English or Chinese  and now has no idea of
how sentiment towards Chinese stocks has
changed in the intervening months.  Let’s
say they decide to stick to the same terms
as the original deal…


On the same ratio of his currently
outstanding $50 million loan, Chairman
Yang would be responsible for posting
over $1 billion in liquid marketable
collateral to borrow $400 million.  So
unless he owns an NFL team or the
Mona Lisa ….how in the world would
China Development lend $400 million to
a Cayman Island Company with no
assets or collateral? 


 


Mind you, that is under the best of
conditions.


 


In most LBO’s you cannot use stock as
collateral.  More importantly, the bank has
already made it clear that they have no
interest in the assets of the company as
collateral.


 


The bank is not in the business of making
bad loans…look at the hard-line deal they
5/18/2018 What the Bank Says vs What the Bank Does – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/what-the-bank-says/ 8/9


cut with HRBN last November under
circumstances far better than now.  If you
believe that the bank will lend $400 million
to a Cayman Islands company to buy
another company that they wouldn’t fund for
$50 million in better times, then I have a
large wall to sell you North of Beijing. 


   What Keeps a Banker Up at Night?


 There is an old adage: when you owe the
bank $1 million, you lose sleep.  But when
you owe the bank $50 million, then the
banker loses sleep.  With the amount of
Chinese RTO’s that have just ceased trading
altogether, no amount of collateral of shares
and Ambien can make this banker sleep at
night.   If this stock gets halted or breaks
below a certain price on a hard core
investigation … the bank could wipe out its
profits on billions of dollars of good loans
with one $50 million write-off.


By the way, as a funny footnote, China
Development bank was actually a client of
Longtop Financial, which is still halted.

[http://ir.longtop.com/index.php/content/content_p


What makes this whole sideshow interesting
is it seems that the company is doing
everything in its power to keep the stock
price up…in the initial loan agreement the
bank made it clear that if they believed their
$50 million loan was in peril, they would sell
stock and keep selling even if it means they
need more than the pledged 7 million
shares.  It is the belief of Citron that HRBN
is a struggling company doing whatever they
have to do in order to keep that share price
high enough.  Like the game of musical
chairs, when the music stops will the bank
have a seat?

  The Risks of Regulatory Attention


Further, Citron suggests the SEC and the
NASD are already having a hard look at the
practice of announcing "private buyout"
deals that lack material basis.  Numerous
currently halted China stocks are the subject
of bogus takeover announcements right
now. 


   Conclusion:


Don’t forget that after Chairman Yang gives
you his wink-wink nod-nod at the social
clubs throughout Harbin or on phone calls
with analysts — use your common sense.  If
you do not, you might end up on the wrong
side of the trade like the many other Citron
detractors of the past.


 


Cautious investing to all.
