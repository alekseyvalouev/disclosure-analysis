Everything 3D Systems Does Not Want You  
To Know About Their Business 





Price Target = $56 Immediately … Longer Term, Much Lower 
 


If you owned 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) over the last year, congratulations, you did well. 
Obviously, when we wrote about DDD last year, we underestimated the amount of 
media hype and market momentum, as well as the unwavering bull market stampede of 
2013. But during the past year, the 3D printing story has changed in decisive ways. 
Investors need to reassess this investment based on current operational results and the 
competitive landscape.  
 
It was just one week ago that Citron pointed out to the investment community how the 
bear thesis on BBRY was flawed. In contrast, this piece illustrates how the bull thesis on 
DDD is flawed beyond all measure.  
 


Note:  This is not a commentary about 3D printing or the additive manufacturing 
industry.  It is a simple eye-opening report on how the numbers do not and can 
never make sense for this market darling. The bottom line is, if you really want 
investment exposure to this space, Citron suggests you consider Stratasys 
(NYSE:SSYS), or maybe even H-P.  





Citron will present an irrefutable financial model that explains how unsupportable 
DDD’s current stock price is, to any analyst, CFO, or shareholder. 
 


After missing estimates two quarters in a row, DDD launched in November, blowing 
past all the analyst target prices. Instead of cautionary notes, some analysts blindly 
“chased the tape”, issuing target raise notes. But now the tone has changed. 
 
As 3D Systems prepares to report next month, management is already guiding 
expectations down toward another similar quarter of marginal profits and weak 
explanations. Management has just stated publicly:

“I want to repeat what I said in connection with the third quarter earnings call that we 
had and subsequently and actually expand on it that we're absolutely willing to tolerate 
temporary earnings compression and even a slight margin compression during this 
period of substantially accelerated growth rate and market share expansion.

With the stock still priced for exponential growth, Citron exposes the real 3D Systems.  
 


  The 3D Systems Avi does not want to talk about 
 


A Pile of Sticks Does Not Make a Tree 
 


If you own DDD shares, it shouldn’t surprise to you that the company is a rollup of 
dozens of acquisitions. Many of these synergize poorly, and most were bought for 2x 
revenues, while DDD is now selling for over 20x revenues. None of these companies 
control transformative technologies; the IP landscape for 3D printing is highly 
fragmented and not dominated by any company.  In fact, 3D Systems’ share is about 
20%, while one third of the company’s revenue is generated by service bureaus (3D 
printing’s version of Kinkos) – typically low-margin business with low barriers to entry. 
 
We must give Mr. Reichental credit for doing a wonderful job as a pitchman for 3D 
printing, employing exaggerated and sweeping generalities, invoking every hot 
buzzword in the culture. But these broad truisms do not and will not benefit 3D Systems 
as a company. His pitchman persona is more like that of a classic illusionist, who 
distracts the audience’s attention while the trick is actually being played on you. 
 
Note that despite management’s obvious stream of hype, there are three topics the 
magician never brings up, because anything he’d say would be an obvious lie. 
 


1) Never claims superior technology  
2) Never discusses competition in a realistic way. The illusion really breaks down if 


this topic comes up.  
3) Never acknowledges that 3D Systems’ consumer initiative is failing miserably. 


More on this below.  
 


With Avi as the frontman for 3D Systems, he wants you to think that he is the true 
expert in the industry. Citron introduces the real expert of the 3D printing  Industry. 
 


Do You Know More Than Terry Wohlers? 
 


Citron is as much an admirer of additive manufacturing as any other market observer. 
But it is foolish to attempt to evaluate the real business prospects of this industry 
without considering the great work of the highest-credibility pro in this space – Terry 
Wohlers, whose work we will cite to in detail in this report 
 
All sell side research, and even 3D Systems itself, relies on Wohlers’ in-depth analysis of 
the entire additive manufacturing industry.  
 
 


Terry Wohlers writes the Wohlers Report ( http://wohlersassociates.com/3D-
printing.html )  More than just the Bible of 3D printing, it is the New Testament as well 
as the Old Testament. For the last 27 years, Wohlers has been the single, universally 



http://wohlersassociates.com/3D-printing.html

http://wohlersassociates.com/3D-printing.html
Citron Breaks Down 3D Systems  January 24. 2014 Page 3 of 18 





recognized go-to expert on the entire competitive landscape of the 3D printing industry. 
Note that the facts and estimates in the Wohlers annual report are not just his opinions; 
rather Terry Wohlers compiles the input of 31 system manufacturers and 74 service 
providers in assembling his 2013 report. We can’t think of another industry where a 
single source has such a compelling handle on the entire scope of industry trends. 
 
In their report on 3D printing (which you will have to order for yourself), Wohlers stated 
investors were a bit overenthusiastic about stock price of 3D Systems – at the time the 
stock price was $30. As the price escalated throughout the year he later stated:

This is not coming from a stock market analyst.  It comes from the premier expert in the 
industry.

 3D Systems’ Ugly Little Secret Exposed:   
Their Consumer Product Sucks 
 


A year ago, in early 2013, the primary illusion Avi Reichental was peddling was that the 
consumer market for low cost 3D printers was about to explode. When we first covered 
DDD, we were warned that once the exciting new low-cost consumer product was 
released, it would quickly become the new “must have” item.   Now it’s a year later. 
What happened?  
 
The low-cost consumer 3D printer market has become a complete bust. Wohler’s 
accurately predicted earlier this year that the retail 3D printer market would flop.   
 


 
http://www.forbes.com/sites/rakeshsharma/2013/09/12/what-works-and-what-doesnt-in-3D-printing-a-talk-with-terry-wohlers/ 


 
This opinion is validated by operational results:  DDD’s material sales continue to decline 
over the last 6 quarters. So much for the razor/blade model.  


“However, a significant number of machines bought by hobbyists are also sitting idle. 
They generally print out a part or two and forget about it.”

Avi doesn’t want you to know that not only has the product sold poorly, but its few 
consumer-class customers do not even like the product. The reality is the company has 
become a non-consumer friendly business.  
 
Citron was considering posting links from 3D Systems own website to suggest readers 
see for themselves how utterly ridiculous their “mancave” and “3D family” videos are.  
http://www.3dsystems.com/mancave-3d-systems   


But instead of us editorializing, we will defer to online reviews. 
 
While 3D’s consumer product, Cubify has been offered for sale all year at Amazon.com, 
there are only 10 reviews – and they’re not favorable ones either: 
 
Amazon Reviews for Consumer 3D Printers: 


Brand Owner Reviews Ratings 5-Star 1-Star Ratio 5/1’s 


Cubify  3D Systems 10 2.6 2 4 0.50 


Makerbot Stratasys 48 3.8 25 9 2.77 
 


http://www.amazon.com/Cubify-Cube-Printer-Generation-SILVER/dp/B00B6RCLKI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389919242&sr=8-
2&keywords=cubify 
 


Compare these to the 48 Makerbot reviews (from Stratasys):  
http://www.amazon.com/MakerBot-Replicator-Desktop-3D-Printer/dp/B00BFZOVGI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389921569&sr=8-
2&keywords=makerbot 
 


The same gripes we read on Amazon spilled over to the “Cubify Sucks” Facebook Page. 
There are actually more ‘likes’ for Cubify Sucks than reviews for Cubify on Amazon. 
https://www.facebook.com/Dontbuycubify?ref=stream 


But when consumers reject the product, they can’t even return it. Far more consumer 
unfriendly than their competition, from 3D we read: 
 


 
 
Both Stratasys’s Makerbot and Formlabs offer at least some form of returns for 
consumer products ... but not 3D.  
 


The Competition They Really Do Not Want You To Know About  
 


If by some chance 3D Systems was just ahead of its time, and consumer-class 3D 
printers are about to erupt into the popular culture, there are numerous comparable 
printers and hundreds of off-price offerings coming from Asia and at much lower price 
points than Cubify. This trend was obvious to everyone at CES, and discussed in detail in 


“What's the return policy? 
 
“We don't provide refunds on Cube printers once they're shipped. If you 
encounter any issues with your printer, we are happy to repair it for free during 
the warranty period.”

Wohlers’ interviews with Forbes. 3D Systems has never discussed a plan to combat off-
price competition – heck, why ruin a good story? 
 


“Don’t You Get it Citron? 
It is not about the Consumer, the Real Business is Industrial !!!”… 
 


  What 3D Systems Does Not Want You To Know about 
Their Metal 3D Printing Business 
 


3D Systems would have you believe they invented the prototyping and specialty on-
demand manufacturing sector, and they are on the cutting edge of 3D metal printing. 
We focus on metal printing because it is on everyone’s mind – it’s “the sizzle” in 3D 
printing – and Avi has been misleadingly spinning the illusion of his company printing 
metal jet engine parts for years. 
 
In reality, industrial 3D printing  and prototyping have been a mainstream niche for over 
25 years, as a small, slow-growth (i.e. single-digit) slice of the manufacturing/industrial 
sector. But with technology evolving in direct metal processing (DMLS), the highest 
growth rates projected forward are in this specialty. 
 
3D Systems first and principal entry into metal additive manufacturing comes by virtue 
of their acquisition of Phenix Systems, a third tier player whose track record shows zero 
growth over the last four years. Four years of operating history for Phenix Systems is 
here:  http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/financials/financials.asp?ticker=ALPHX:FP  
 


In Phenix, we see:  
 Tiny Revenues:  Less than $10 million USD for each of the last 4 years 
 Negative Revenue Growth 
 Increasing Operating Losses 
 Purchased by 3D Systems for appx. 2x revenues 


 
So 3D Systems bought Phenix for less than $20 million in June 2013, and now they are 
suddenly poised to change the world?  
 


Here are comparative graphs from Piper Jaffray’s industrial survey of the 3D printing 
competitive landscape. This doesn’t look good for 3D Systems.  The survey reveals only 
their DMLS product line indicates the potential for exceptional growth in 2014.  Note 
how much better Stratasys looks by comparison.  This looks to us like the portrait of 
upcoming market share loss:

Citron Breaks Down 3D Systems  January 24. 2014 Page 6 of 18 











With the Phenix systems acquisition as of mid-2013, DDD finally has their own metal 3D 
printer, but now let’s consider how insignificant that branch of their business actually is.  
 
Citron points readers to the first week in January, when 3D Systems was introducing 
“Will I Am” as their “Chief Creative Officer”. Like any skilled illusionist, Avi was 
distracting the audience, while a serious competitor was making the magic. 
 
Meanwhile, during the same week, Mitsubishi was introducing a highly advanced metal 
laser sintering hybrid machine:  http://www.industrial-lasers.com/articles/2014/01/mitsubishi-
moves-into-laser-additive-manufacturing-with-matsuura-partnership.html

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/04/mitsubishi-entering-north-american-3-d-printing-ma.aspx 





Mitsubishi?  We didn’t even know they were playing!  Similarly, on the industrial front 
going forward, we are about to witness H-P and Epson both entering the industrial 
space.  
http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/09/epson-3D-printer-ces-2014/  
http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/12/hp_printer/ 
 


If all of that wasn’t enough, Wohlers discusses China currently making huge research 
investments in the 3D printing competitive landscape.  
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/01/china-advances-3D-printing-
manufacturing/3675057/  


 
Within the metal printing specialty, 3D Systems has no basis to claim they can grow their  
market share from here. Trying to fight Mitsubishi, H-P, Epson, and China on R&D, with 
Phenix Systems, is truly bringing a pea shooter to a gun fight.  DDD is now positioned as 
the 8th or 10th largest metal 3D Printer manufacturer. In fact, DDD’s Phenix division is 
smaller than:   ( This is not an exclusive list; there are probably even more by now )  
 


 EOS 
 Arcam 
 EXONE 
 Renishaw 
 Realizer 
 Concept Laser  
 SLM   





… all before we even begin to factor in Mitsubishi, Epson, H-P, and China, Inc.  
 
Yes, there were big headlines in November that GE was planning to “print” jet engine 
nozzles, but they already own $150 million of EOS machines. Phenix Systems?  Just 
looking, thanks …  
 


  Enough About The Business: Let’s Analyze the Stock 
 


It is obvious that the cult around 3D printing is more about the stock than it is about the 
underlying technology. Citron is appalled when we hear people compare 3D Systems to 
Tesla, when in reality the only thing they have in common is a high momentum stock.  
 


Whose turf is Mitsubishi invading? 
Based upon the limited information out at this point, it seems that Mitsubishi's 
main publicly traded competition will likely be Arcam and 3-D Systems , and, 
perhaps to a lesser degree ExOne.

With Tesla, a cult gathered around their product, and the enthusiasm spilled over into 
the stock. In DDD, it’s the other way around:  there is a cult around the stock, but it has 
not spilled over into the product. We have assembled a chart to illustrate why DDD is 
the anti-Tesla:  the only thing they have in common is momentum.  Yet these stocks 
could not be more different; we suggest investors need to understand the difference.

    What happens When a “Roll-Up” can no Longer Roll Up? 
 


Over the past 3 years, 3D Systems has acquired over 40 companies, and has become a 
2/20 type scheme. No, not the hedge fund 2/20, but rather a roll up strategy of 
acquiring a company for 2x revs, while promoting their stock, which is trading for 20x 
revenues. God Bless America!  
 
So when does it end?  The music stops when you can’t acquire any more.  As DDD has 
enjoyed its stock appreciation over the past year, the furious demand in the sector has 
simply taken all significant potential acquisition targets off the table – they have now 
become too powerfully incented to file their own IPO’s. Why would a Voxijet sell to DDD 
for $60 mil (2x revenues) when they can go public, and be blessed with a market cap of

$400 million?  This obstacle facing 3D Systems was identified, however gently (read 
between the lines), in a recent Canaccord note which explained:

canaccord-ipos-metals-and-services-in-2014/ 
 


This phenomenon is already unfolding. Consider DDD’s last four acquisitions:   
( Skipping the Xerox acquisition, in which all they acquired was the right to pay a 
development team – if Xerox had been able to spin out this R&D team into a public 
company, they surely would have done so. Only one problem: no source of 
revenue…none at all. )  
 


1)  September 10, 2013 – 3D Systems Acquires The Sugar Lab 
While this might sound futuristic, the Sugar Lab is nothing more than a husband and 
wife team working out of an apartment in East Los Angeles. They didn’t acquire a 
company – they acquired a relationship.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3D-systems-acquires-figulo-corporation-2013-12-04 


This appears to be nothing more than a little shop that prints ceramics. According to 
reliable sources, their annual revs were a miniscule $230K:

3) Dec 13, 2013 – 3D Systems Acquires Village Plastics 


http://finance.yahoo.com/news/3D-systems-acquires-village-plastics-161612578.html 
 


Village Plastics is nothing more than a plastic filament manufacturer/distributor running 
out of a small shop in Ohio, with annual revenues appx. $500K.

Meanwhile, there are over 150 commoditized plastic filament materials suppliers, listed 
here:  http://reprap.org/wiki/Printing_Material_Suppliers 





“Next year, in our view, promises to be a year when growing investment choices allow 
investors to explore different business models and do some additional work on 
understanding the space. This will be fueled by IPOs and broader sell-side coverage that 
will increasingly bring in European players (the leaders in metal) and pure-play service 
bureaus (presently the public service bureaus are captive within DDD and SSYS).”

http://www.3Dsystems.com/press-releases/3D-systems-acquires-gentle-giant-studios 
 


Here they are simply acquiring revenue with no synergies to their mainline business. 
Gentle Giant makes 3D molds for movies and is in the business of 3D printing 
collectibles: 





 
http://www.gentlegiantltd.com/Star_Wars_Collectibles_s/1.htm 





Great, so now along with the Justin Bieber Vibrator you can now get your custom Star 
Wars sex toys. It is just so ridiculous that we are discussing a $10 billion dollar company 
here. 
 
It is Citron’s opinion that the window of opportunity for making even marginally 
strategic acquisitions is closed. 3D Systems’ last four buys have been pathetic.  
Meanwhile, the supply of legitimate acquisition targets has now been completely picked 
over.

   Sharpen Your Pencils:   
What is 3D Systems REALLY Worth?    
 





Comparing DDD and SSYS Enterprise Values: 
 


 SSYS DDD 
Revenues 669.2 671.8 
Market Share of 3D Industry 
(installed base – See Wohlers chart below) 


38.9% 17.5% 


Total Enterprise Value 5,366.5 9,473.3 
Multiple of Sales 8.0x 14.1x 





(*)  Based on 2014 consensus estimates, per Bloomberg 
 


OK, so DDD has a better stock symbol and a more promotional CEO than Stratasys, but it 
lacks a category-dominating product in any industrial sector, and its consumer product 
Cubify is clearly inferior to Stratasys’ Makerbot.   
 


 
Note that SSYS controls far more of the overall market than DDD, on an installed 
systems basis, according to Wohlers. And they’re surveying out far better for 2014 than 
DDD. (see p. 6)  But even if we overlooked these unfavorable comparisons and granted 
DDD equivalent Enterprise Value to Stratasys, what would the DDD stock price be?  
 


Apply SSYS Enterprise Value to DDD 5,366.5 
DDD’s Net Cash 322.4 
DDD Market Cap 5,688.9 
Shares Outstanding  (millions) 102.78 


DDD Indicated Share Price $55.40 


“If DDD were to trade at the same forward multiple as SSYS, DDD’s 
stock price would be $49.00. ”
Citron Breaks Down 3D Systems  January 24. 2014 Page 12 of 18 





 
OK, so we get $55 per share value for DDD … right now, and that is only if all things 
were created equal. But they’re not equal … not even close.  Stratasys is a much better 
business, both in the mainline industrial sectors and facing the consumer.   
 
Stratasys lags behind 3D Systems in a couple of key areas. They have not ventured into 
Star Wars figurines, dolls, decorative cakes, or candy. The idea of valuing 3D Systems in 
line with Stratysys was suggested this week by Credit Suisse when they noted: 





   We believe a Stratysys comparison provides a 
credible Near-Term Target … What about Longer Term?   
 


This is a simple financial model that shows how utterly ludicrous DDD’s current stock 
price has become. 
 
This chart was presented by 3D Systems just this week, in their presentation at the 
Needham Conference. DDD uses Wohler’s 2021 estimated market size of $10.8 billion as 
a key reference point for their own revenue projections: 








So let’s pretend 3D Systems is able to accomplish the impossible: 
Maintaining their 20% market share of the industry, (they only have 17.5% in the above 
chart, but we will round up), fighting off all competition from the likes of HP, Mitsubishi, 


“The vast valuation gap does not appear justified.”

Epson, waves of startups and IPO’s as well as the Chinese competitors, despite its token 
R&D spend.  
 


Then they would generate revenues of $2 billion in 2021.  
 
Now we wave our magic wand, and grant them an over-the-rainbow 20% net income 
margin – the same as Apple and Google – and 4x the margin of Hewlett Packard 
(impossible we know, but we are playing make believe here) – they would generate 
roughly $400 million in net income. That’s if we also grant them a permanent tax 
amnesty because of their awesomeness. Let’s fantasize no stock dilution either, and 
assume they have the same share count as today. That would yield $3.67 EPS in 2021. 
 
Feeling very magnanimous, we only discount that figure back to today at 6%, and we 
will grant them a 20x multiple – twice that of Hewlett Packard. Then our stock price 


today would be: $46 a share.  
 
This easy-to-understand model demonstrates how utterly ridiculous the share price of 
DDD has become.  
 
Realistically, what will happen if they will lose any market share to competition?  They 
will be forced to dilute the stock to make increasingly desperate acquisitions. The stock 
will eventually collapse to single digits and eventually become like Commodore 
Computers. Remember them? They definitely had indisputable “first mover advantage” 
in home computers.  But they couldn’t keep up with competition, and ended up in 
bankruptcy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International 
 


   What Do The Analysts Have to Say About This? 
 


Citron observes that a runaway stock is close to getting to its top when the analysts’ 
work completely detaches from reality. 
 
Most analysts who have been covering the stock have gotten to the point where they 
just can’t push their targets any higher. Both JPM and Piper, who have actively covered 
DDD for over a year, are maintaining their price targets in the mid 60’s. Credit Suisse 
just this week noted the unjustified disparity between SSYS and DDD, but inexplicably 
couldn’t bear to touch on their own $90 target.  
 
But we would rather dedicate this section to the one analyst with the undisputed 
highest price target on 3D Systems: Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank, who might have 
given us the single most stupid comment ever spoken live on CNBC.  
 
Please, please, if it’s the only thing you do this year, listen to the first 30 seconds of this 
CNBC video:  It is the most awesome video you will ever see on 3D printing.

What?? I liked my Cubify so much, that I decided to spend $700,000 on an industrial 
printer for my garage?  
 


Does this make any sense at all?  Remember, industrial additive manufacturing mature 
industry with a 25-year historical timeline. It’s not like the legitimate manufacturing / 
prototype engineers across the land are suddenly going to have an epiphany that 3D 
Printers are useful for niche applications, because they played with a home unit that can 
print a coaster. Poor Terry Wohlers – he would have a cow if he saw this.  
 





Tell me More … Tell me More … Will they put up a Fight?  
A Quick Review of the Short Interest in DDD 
 
Earlier in the year, when Citron discussed 3D Systems, there was a short interest of 26 
million:  that was before their follow-on offering, which added appx. 7.1 million shares 
to the outstanding and float, and when the stock was 1/3


rd
 today’s price. As the table 


below indicates, in the fall the shorts capitulated in the name, and as of last NASDAQ 
update, the short interest in DDD is at its lowest point in over 15 months.

All this while the underlying story has actually gotten progressively weaker.  Citron 
believes the recent outsized run-up in the stock was caused by short sellers running for 
cover before Euromold, CES, and earnings … who would want to stand in the way of an 
over promotional-company in the face of those near-term catalysts?  Those events have 
now all come and gone. Citron thinks a lower short interest clears the path to a more 
reasonable valuation. 





   The Consumer Electronic Show: 3D Systems ‘Jump 
the Shark’ Moment  
 


This presentation at CES with Avi Reichental and Will.I.Am honestly competes with the 
stupidest statement ever uttered on CNBC. This has got to be the most ridiculous 
marketing vision ever spun to hype a stock to investors:   
 





 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=DOVbJ_NOeXM#t=299 (from 5:00 min ) 





“Now, with this partnership, the idea of a band touring and right next to the merch 
booth is a 3D printer, not just printing stuff that was designed yesterday, but 
capturing the audience, and printing the audience for sale because you were there, 
that’s amazing!  Think about making an object out of everyone who was there in the 
building that day, and actually printing the building that day!  All the things that 
change my world drastically … “

And this was not just a joke. We read further:

 Conclusion  
 


Yes, we have an excessively promotional CEO, right down to the black turtlenecks. But 
Avi’s fashion statement could be easily forgiven if he was blazing a trail to build a 
valuable company engineered to compete in a highly competitive, highly fragmented 
industry.  While Avi spins word pictures of revolutionizing manufacturing, medical care, 
biotech, entertainment, nutrition, and even education (and “politics” by 
“democratizing” manufacturing … whatever that means…), the real 3D Systems is 
extremely vulnerable to being eclipsed and marginalized in an increasingly challenging 
competitive landscape.  
 
Citron would not have revisited this stock without evidence of significant changes 
appearing in the fundamental thesis.  Further, we believe the consequences to the stock 
are far more imminent now, as the cracks DDD’s story gain higher visibility.  
 
The growing shortage of legitimate rollup targets is just one of their problems.  We’ve 
studied accounting critiques detailing how they torque their acquisition accounting to 
manipulate reported organic growth, and we’ve interviewed their sales channel to verify 
it.  For those reasons, we find 3D’s organic growth numbers neither credible nor 
sustainable.  The company responds by acquiring a hodge-podge of distractions, 
seemingly intended to impress an increasingly naïve investor base.  
 
We find the feedback of how management treats employees equally telling:  
http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/3D-Systems-Reviews-E2061.htm  
 
While we would rather avoid commenting on market timing, and focus our thoughts on 
the company’s underlying fundamentals, 2014 looks to us to be a painful year for DDD 
shareholders.  There are way too many points to discuss in this one report; we could 
have written 100 pages and still have more to say.  Citron will stay on top of this story.   
 
But once the halo wears off, people will see the naked emperor.  This is a company 
destined to fail on a long term basis.  It is not as much their fault, as the natural forces of 
the competitive landscape and the changing world we live in.   


“By contrast, will.i.am insisted that his is a real and authentic position at the 
company, not one just for show. Reichental said that he offered the position to the 
singer after having a series of informal conversations and brainstorming sessions in 
which they bandied about ideas. “

Under the sheets, 3D Systems is unavoidably a modestly-growing industrial supply 
company providing machines for industrial prototyping and dental implants.  But it is 
stitched to a low-margin service bureau business.  Needless to say, when the service 
bureaus are being compelled to buy inferior technology from their parent company, the 
music will stop soon enough. 
 
By no means was this piece meant to be disrespectful to Avi.  He has done the best he 
can with what he has.  His flamboyant showmanship has benefited shareholders, but 
smoke and mirrors only gets a company so far.  So whether or not they sign a deal 
tomorrow with Taco Bell to 3D-print my take out order, investors will soon have to take 
note of the real 3D Systems – its lunch is inevitably going to get eaten by the big boys.

 Post Script  
 


For giggles, a couple of thoughts left on the editing room floor:  
 


Below, 3D Systems tries to pitch consumers on the concept of 3D printing their own 
customized toys and dolls. You must watch a few minutes to realize how stupid it really 
is:  


 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjLS9QpjRfM 


 
A $10 billion company trying to convince consumers that a “must have” item is a device 
to print your own doll?   3D Systems has a larger market cap than Hasbro, and that is 
despite Hasbro having a competing 3D printer. Here’s a photo of it:  
 


 
 
Then there’s this video clip from “The Big Bang Theory”.  Rarely have we seen an entire 
short case summed up in a single sitcom clip.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsz9GUZv1IA 





So Is That All There Is? 
 


Consider that only about 1/3 of 3D Systems’ revenue is from sales of printing systems 
(32.7%).  Materials generates 24.8%, while service bureau revenue generates 30.8%.  
The balance (11.8%) is from software and consumer odds and ends.    
 
While materials and service bureaus both currently provide loft for 3D’s topline number, 
there are serious problems with both these components of 3D’s revenue mix, and it is 
impossible to sustain high multiples for either of these business sectors.  Citron could 
write another 15 pages on the trouble ahead.
