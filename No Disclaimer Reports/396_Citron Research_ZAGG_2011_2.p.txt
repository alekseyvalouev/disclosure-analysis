ZAGG: IS IT IN THE COVERS
BUSINESS, OR COVERING
UP ITS REAL BUSINESS?


Next month, August 2011, marks the 10th


anniversary of Citron Research researching and
publishing on the topic of stock fraud.  China
aside, Citron has uncovered and published more
actionable stories of stock fraud in the US markets
among domestic companies than any other
research journal or column online. 


 


   Lie with Dogs, Get Fleas


What really drew Citron's attention to ZAGG was
the 10-K of 3/25/2011, in which Randall Hales is
appointed head of ZAGG's audit committee.  This
is a move so egregious it absolutely made our eyes
pop out.


Indeed, Mr. Hales is well known to Citron… 


 


Introducing Randall Hales, audit committee
chairman of ZAGG


Mr. Hales is the former CEO, President, and
Chairman of the board of First Scientific.  The
claim to fame of First Scientific is that after the
post-September 11 anthrax scare, (FSFI) claimed

to be in the middle of testing “an anti-anthrax
bacterial crème”. 


http://www.stockpatrol.com/article/key/anthrax2
[http://www.stockpatrol.com/article/key/anthrax2]


What makes the anti-anthrax scam even crazier is
that according to the SEC the company’s principal
operating subsidiary was sold at foreclosure just
six months before they even pulled the anthrax
stunt…. and it was never disclosed.


This is the chosen new head of ZAGG's audit
committee? 


In uncovering fraud, one of our key indicators has
always been the pedigree and credibility of
management.   It is our study of management that
leads us to believe that ZAGG is committing
fraud on the investing public.  Go ahead and
sue, ZAGG, you will lose.   We continue our
discussion of management credibility below…but its
not off to a very promising start…


 


ZAGG is presenting an intentionally distorted
financial picture of its current business, playing
word games while flirting with outright fraud. 
Citron predicts that ZAGG will not experience the
explosive growth that management and the
analysts project for the future, and the retail
investors piling in now as its enterprise value
approaches $500 million will take huge losses as a
consequence. 


 


In the first Citron report on ZAGG, we focused on
cash flows, pointing out how real cash flow has
been declining while inventory has been growing
disproportionately to reported revenues.   These
metrics come from ZAGG’s reported financials to
date, revealing the company is not generating
cash, but rather burning it in increasing amounts. 
Their investment premise, parroted uncritically by
analysts, projects a glowing picture of the future. 
But this picture is directly contradicted by the

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-is-it-in-the-covers-business-or-covering-up-its-real-business/ 3/13


competitive factors inherent in ZAGG’s core
business.   


 


The heart of the issue therefore goes to
management credibility.   Therefore this report
covers three main points:


 


Reliability of reported revenues in ZAGG’s core
business, in light of adverse competitive factors


Analyst track record, and whether they are
worthy of investors’ trust in their
recommendations


Management credibility


   ZAGG’s revenues:  Can you take them
to the bank ?


ZAGG’s protective covers for cell phones and iPads
are sold through a variety of channels, but the
largest one by far is Best Buy.   Any Citron reader
can in fact wander into their local Best Buy and
observe a whole rack of SKU’s for ZAGG’s covers
for dozens of cell phone models.  These include hot
selling models as well as dozens of “last year’s
models” that have gone dormant, which is simply
the nature of the business.


 


If you ask a sales rep, you’ll find out,
unsurprisingly, that ZAGG sells some products for
the current “hot models”, and the rest are dead. 


 


Analysts and skeptics have focused on the status
of ZAGG’s revenues because of the huge number
of “dead” SKU’s on display at Best Buy.  Big box
retailers are notorious for highly one-sided, vendor
adverse return policies for inventory they carry. 
For example, Staples has an “open return” policy
on ZAGG’s products.  Yet ZAGG has steadfastly
insisted that Best Buy purchases are final and
cannot be returned.  This would imply vendor

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-is-it-in-the-covers-business-or-covering-up-its-real-business/ 4/13


market power for ZAGG which is available only to
Apple, and would be highly unusual for a gadget
accessory vendor. 


 


Speaking of Apple, Citron has no doubt that ZAGG
is selling some amount of covers for the currently
hot model: iPhone 2, plus accessories for the
iPad.   But it is clear from industry commentary
about Apple that it is selling huge quantities of its
own cover, and there are literally hundreds of
competitors for iPhone covers.

Comparative data points keep popping up to
increase the concern.   For example, just last
week, on 7/6, Skullcandy filed their S-1 to go
public.  As most ZAGG investors know, Skullcandy
is “the brand” in the headphone and phone case
market.   (Recent ZAGG acquisition Ifrogz can be
considered a generic competitor to Skullcandy.)  In
Skullcandy’s S-1, we read an interesting
disclosure:


 


"……….We have executed an open return program
with a major retailer allowing for an unlimited amount
of returns. Estimates for these items are based on
actual experience and are recorded as a reduction of
revenue at the time of recognition or when
circumstances change resulting in a change in estimated
returns."


 


It is the opinion of Citron that Skullcandy sells its
products subject to an open return policy because
it is simply required to do business with the big
box stores.

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-is-it-in-the-covers-business-or-covering-up-its-real-business/ 5/13


 


This relationship description is consistent with the
experience of numerous product vendors’ when
dealing with major chain retailers.   Yet ZAGG
claimed it could sell the same category of products
to Best Buy without any return contingency….until
they were forced to insert some more wiggle
words. 


 


Has ZAGG really orchestrated a better deal at the
major retailers than Skullcandy, a deal unique in
all the world of big box retail?  Or is management
not being forthright about its terms?  Remember,
this issue is large enough to trigger an accounting
restatement, and/or to wipe out all of ZAGG’s
reported profits.


 


Citron advises that investors assess the risks here
based on the company’s own words (from their
11/10/2010 conf call) :

“Q:  Okay and then just one last question and I don’t
want to be rude here or anything but would you please
address one more time your contract with Best Buy and
what their opportunity is to return product to you or
not.  Could you lay that out on the table one more time?


 


Brandon O’Brien – ZAGG Incorporated – CFO


Sure, as we have reiterated in the past.  Our contract
with Best Buy does not allow for any type of
return.  We do not have the ability to send products to
Best Buy more than they order.  So there is no way for
us to stuff that channel.  We are fulfilling the orders that
Best Buy sends to us on a weekly basis.  They get that

product.  That product is theirs then and there’s no
return rights on that.”


 


Just three weeks later, the company was obliged to
issue an 8-K, backpedaling on that claim, having
gotten so much flak that the claim simply wasn’t
credible.

On November 9, 2010, the Company conducted its
Third Quarter Earnings conference call.  Robert G.
Pedersen II, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
and Brandon T. O’Brien, the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer, participated in the call on behalf of
the Company.  During the question and answer portion
of the conference call, Mr. O’Brien was asked questions
about Best Buy’s right to return products sold by the
Company to Best Buy.  In response, Mr. O’Brien stated
that the Best Buy contract did not allow Best Buy to
return products to the Company.  As clarification to
Mr. O’Brien’s statement, the Company notes that
Best Buy can return products to the Company under
limited circumstances, including where products are
defective or for other similar customary reasons.


 


That wasn’t the only forced “clarification” either. 
In the same release, they were forced to “clarify”
statements made at the Merriman Investor
Summit Conference, reducing the claim of “millions
of dollars” of orders to just $1.5 million.


Merriman Investor Summit Comments


On November 15, 2010, Robert G. Pedersen II, the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Brandon T.
O’Brien, the Company Chief Financial Officer,
participated in the Merriman Investor Summit 2010 in
New York, New York.  Mr. Pedersen gave a
presentation regarding the Company and its



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1296205/000101376210002947/form8k.htm

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-is-it-in-the-covers-business-or-covering-up-its-real-business/ 7/13


prospects.  In the course of the presentation, Mr.
Pedersen discussed the introduction of a new product,
the ZAGGmate, for protection of the iPad device.  Mr.
Pedersen described the ZAGGmate product and its
features, its anticipated introduction date and
pricing.  Mr. Pedersen further stated that the Company
had received orders for “tens of thousands” of the
ZAGGmate product and that companies “like a Best
Buy” had ordered “millions of dollars” of the
ZAGGmate product.  It has now come to the attention
of the Company that some participants at the Merriman
Investor Summit 2010 and others who have listened to
a recording of the conference might have understood
Mr. Pedersen to say that Best Buy had ordered
“millions of dollars” of the ZAGGmate product.  As
clarification to Mr. Pedersen’s remarks, the
Company notes that as of November 15, 2010 it had
received initial stocking orders for $1,500,000 of the
ZAGGmate product from large, national indirect
channel partners.  In addition, as of November 15,
2010 the Company had also received ZAGGmate
product orders from other retail outlets, including on-
line retailers.


 


The company has been very evasive about the
details of their relationship with Best Buy.  The
funny thing is that Citron does not fundamentally
disagree with the company, we believe that Best
Buy only has the right to return product under
“certain conditions”.   So whether its a matter
of credits against future orders, expense deferred
forward, or whatever, there is a shell game being
played in here with loose language.  If ZAGG really
wanted to clarify this question, they should have
made their entire sales relationship with Best Buy
transparent.  It is Citron’s belief that they can’t – it
would force them into a financial restatement.


 


These restatements should be red-flag
concerns all investors.  It is Citron’s opinion
that they inevitably foreshadow another kind
of restatement – the bad kind.

   Analysts or Puppets?  Uncritical
Analysts Just Parroting Management
Claims


 


Two analysts cover ZAGG:  Northland Securities
and the new kid on the block, Jon Hickman, at
Ladenberg Thalmann. 


 


Northland, whose now notorious anointment of
CCME (now delisted) as its “Top Pick of 2011”, has
been very vocal about ZAGG, feeling the need to
issue a note and a reiteration every time anything
critical is stated in public about ZAGG.  But their
justification is just a hollow echo of management’s
claims.   They don’t say a word or provide any
independent assessment of the risk factors and the
troubling red flags surrounding management’s
actions and statements.  


 


It would be no surprise that Citron places zero
credibility in the work product that comes out of
Northland.  Recommending that investors buy
ZAGG at these levels, without even acknowledging
the major risk factors in the details of their sales
contracts or the quality and credibility of their
management, is malpractice.


 


Hickman just came over from a small firm MDB
Capital Group.  His 15 minutes of fame came in an
interview just 7 months ago, in which he delivered
more dogs than the Humane Society.

Honestly, these outcomes are exactly
representative of what Citron’s expects from
ZAGG.


At its core, the ZAGG pro-and-con argument
breaks down like this:  The bullish analysts take
their projections straight from the company’s
guidance.  The optimistic view is that revenues will
rocket higher — and all of the paper profits plowed
into inventory stockpiles so far have been built up
to prepare for this future.  The bull case also
stands on the premise that all sales to Best Buy

(by far their largest single customer) are final sales
with no refund or credit overhang.  Therefore its
posted revenues are clean, and its revenue growth
projects into a future which can be relied upon. 


 


The bear case, as reflected in the opinion of Citron,
is that the company is operating a terminal
business model and has not been forthright with
Wall St. on either revenues, inventory accounting,
or future business prospects. 


 


If you’re going to buy this stock, you are banking
on the bright future story, not its current assets or
current cash flows.  Therefore, the safety of your
capital will be entrusted to ZAGG’s management
team. 


 


   Introducing the ZAGG team


 


Top Dog


Let’s start from the top down.  The CEO of the
ZAGG is Robert Pedersen. As mentioned in the
widely read Worthless Pennies report, CEO
Pedersen was involved in many penny stocks over
the years.  Yet, Citron wants it noted that he was
not just passively involved, but while the CEO of
ZAGG was supposed completely fully dedicated to
his position with the company, he was
moonlighting orchestrating dodgy reverse merger
deals.  Below are the list of stocks and the relevant
dates he appears at the center of reverse merger
deals while he was the acting CEO of ZAGG.

The Face of Fraud


The public’s last line of protection in the soundness
of companies it invests in is the auditor.  It is the
audit committee that is responsible for all aspects
of the audit relationship.  Because of the red flags
regarding ZAGG’s inventory and sales policies, the
auditor and the integrity of audited financials going
forward is the fulcrum of the investment’s safety
and soundness. 


 


As mentioned in the previous report but cannot be
understated, late last year ZAGG committed
blatant securities fraud by not disclosing the

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-is-it-in-the-covers-business-or-covering-up-its-real-business/ 12/13


dismissal of the former head of its audit committee
Lorence Harmer until four months after the
event.  Clearly there were shenanigans involved;
ZAGG appears to have eaten a substantial loss
after having advanced $4 million in a related party
deal with the Chairman of its own audit
committee.  


 


On November 5, 2010, he resigned from ZAGG but
the company never filed a required 8-K
announcing the event.  To make maters worse, the
company then issued a 10-Q just four days later,
but made no mention of the resignation or a
replacement.


 


What were they hiding?  Why did they not want
the investing public, or their new auditors to know
the new head of the audit committee?  Here is
why.


That all becomes a little more clear once you
realize his replacement is the abovementioned
Randall Hales.  This choice is unspeakable from a
corporate governance standpoint.  And note that is
he works hand-in-hand with CFO Brandon O’Brien,
whose last public company went into liquidation
while he was CFO, with annual revenues barely
more than $1 million.


So these are the horses you are betting on when
you bet on ZAGG. 


 


   Hello Skullcandy, and a comment on
valuation.


 


Once public, Skullcandy will have 27.5 million
shares outstanding with management selling half
of their equity at IPO.  With a brand that is
growing over 100% a year and ttm revs of 160 mil
and strong management, Skullcandy would have
the same enterprise valuation as cash strapped
