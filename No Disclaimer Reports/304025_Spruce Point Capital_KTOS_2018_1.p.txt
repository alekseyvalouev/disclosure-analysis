Kratos Is Just Another Overhyped 
Robotics / Drone Company. Spruce Point Has 
Excelled Shorting These Types of Companies


Report Date(s) June 27 / Aug 18 / Sept 13 Nov 8, 2017


Criticism


Stagnant robotic and technology company 
with limited product innovation. Will come 


under severe product/price competition 
from new entrants. IRBT’s distributor 


acquisitions are defensive and continue to 
reflect its poor capital allocation. The share 


price surge in early 2017 would not be 
sustainable. iRobot is heavily promoted to 
retail investors who would suffer 20%-60% 


long-term downside risk


Stagnant UAV / drone company with limited 
product innovation, poor capital allocation, 


terrible governance and insider alignment with 
shareholders. AVAV’s extreme share price 


appreciation in 2017 would lead to 
disappointment along with its move into the 
consumer drone space. Heavily promoted by 


analysts and investor blogs as a “play” on drones, 
despite not being a leader in its industry. We 
estimate 30%-50% long-term downside risk


Successful 
Outcome


New competition (SharkNinja and others) 
stormed the market with lower price 
vacuum robotics, thereby pressuring 


iRobot’s margins.  Its share price crashed 
20% in Feb 2018 as its outlook missed lofty 


analyst expectations


AVAV’s share price plunged nearly 18% as its Q3 
earnings result all but assured it would miss full 


year targets. Its backlog shrunk QoQ and the CEO 
dodged answering specific questions about the 
progress of its new consumer drone business

Executive Summary
6


Spruce Point Believes Kratos (Nasdaq: KTOS) Is A 
“Strong Sell” With 40% - 70% Downside Risk


Terrible Business Through Multiple Reinventions Now Hyping Drones: Originally a dotcom darling named Wireless Facilities that IPO’ed in 
1999 with hopes of being the leading provider of outsourced services for wireless networks, the Company collapsed and later took a large 
accounting restatement when material weaknesses were revealed. Under new management, a name change to Kratos in 2007, and a 
divestment of businesses, the Company started focusing its efforts on products and solutions related to Command, Control, Communications, 
Computing, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (“C5ISR”). After failing to execute on these opportunities, Kratos is 
now promoting its billion dollar opportunities in unmanned systems (drones) in the hopes of finally turning the corner to sustain profits and 
free cash flow, both of which have been forever illusive for shareholders


After a reckless and failed acquisition spree from 2008-2012, Kratos teetered on credit default before divesting a key division to 


deleverage, and pivoting focus to hype its unmanned systems (aka drones) business. With its share price rising, and a wave of equity 


offerings, Kratos has made a remarkable come back. However, after a close forensic analysis, we question the legitimacy of Kratos’ 


success and its ability to hit its aspirational goals of $800m of revenues at 10% EBITDA margins. Given the propensity of Kratos to over-


promise and under-deliver, we do not believe it warrants its premium valuation. We see 40%-70% downside risk


Significant Value Destruction Through Wasted Mergers and Acquisitions: From 2008–2012, Kratos acquired ten businesses for nearly $1bn. 
These deals contributed an estimated $801m and $129m of sales and EBITDA (16.1% margin). Yet, recent results suggest $239m and $69m of 
sales and EBITDA losses, net of divestitures, and margins are a pathetic 7.2%. Kratos looks like an abysmal failure run by management adept at 
value destruction. Share dilution is +24% p.a. since the current management team took control, while cumulative free cash flow is -$25m. 
Leverage skyrocketed to >10x EBITDA, forcing it to initiate a strategic review process in 2015, which resulted in the divestment of its Electronics 
Products Division, allowing it to avert default. Kratos is now selling its Public Safety business at a depressed valuation of 0.5x and 6.5x 2018E 
sales and EBITDA (despite claiming it will generate free cash flow this year) and impaired more goodwill. Brace for additional disappointment.
Warning About Management History Associated With Past Scandal: Kratos is led by Eric DeMarco (CEO) and Deanna Lund (CFO) since 2003-
2004. These executives joined from Titan Corp, where DeMarco was COO and Lund was Titan’s Controller. Titan was a tainted defense 
contractor that in 2005 paid the largest fine in history (at the time) to settle criminal and civil charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act. Lockheed Martin aborted a takeover of Titan Corp after conducting its due diligence on this matter. According to shareholder 
lawsuit documents, Titan engaged in a scheme to inflate revenues and book fictitious receivables. Titan used “middlemen” and “private 
consulting companies” with ties to foreign government officials to secure business. The litigation says confidential witnesses claim DeMarco 
knew about the corruption and DeMarco was responsible for transferring funds to Benin, the African country involved. DeMarco was also 
allegedly the source of the “percentage of completion accounting techniques learned from the ‘Andersen school of accounting’ that allowed 
Titan to either overstate or prematurely state revenues at the company.” We note that Kratos CFO Deanna Lund  omits from her current 
biography that she worked at Arthur Andersen, the defunct auditor that collapsed after the Enron scandal. Management has placed another 
former financial partner from its Titan Corp days on the Audit Committee as an “independent” member, so we worry that adequate oversight is 
absent. Management owns virtually no stock and appears more focused on milking its cash compensation by reaping a large % of EBITDA
7


Spruce Point Believes Kratos (Nasdaq: KTOS) Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons:


Kratos Doesn’t Behave Ethically And Has A History of Association With Bad Activities: Engaging middlemen and private consulting companies 
to gain illicit business appears to be a notable tactic that has followed CEO DeMarco from Titan Corp to Kratos. Coincidence or not? Spruce 
Point uncovered an undisclosed corruption case late last year of a senior Kratos Director pleading guilty to conspiring with others (including an 
Army Colonel), and using a shell company OzTEK Research LLC to fraudulent obtain $20m worth of contracts over a decade from the US Army 
in Georgia. Ethical problems and government sanctions appear more the norm, rather than one-off lapses of judgement at Kratos; we have 
identified a disturbing pattern of problems associated with Kratos’ businesses over the years which investors need to strongly evaluate


The Bull Case On Kratos’ Drone Business Appears More Promotion Than Reality: With a newly adopted compensation clawback for financial 
misstatement in place by November 2015, Kratos ramped its promotion of its drone opportunity, while along the way conducting three dilutive 
equity raises. We believe its drone segment is an amalgamation of two legacy acquired businesses that are subscale and represent a meager 
1% of unmanned system market share and DoD government spending. Many of its hyped programs are experimental and high risk in nature, 
with no guarantee of commercial success, and not currently making money. Kratos has already stopped commenting on certain programs, 
including Gremlins and UTAP-22. Its most hyped program (LCASD) requires Kratos to front 82% of the capital. Kratos would like investors to 
believe the deal allows it to protect its IP, but in our view, it shows the Air Force’s desire to push the risk (and cost) to Kratos, while providing it 
a cheap abandonment option. We estimate Kratos has spent a meager $63m on capex and R&D for its drone ambitions since 2013. The only 
two pure play drone companies, AeroVironment and Parrot SA, have spent $255m and $365m, respectively, during the same period. Although 
each company operates in a different market segment for drones, Kratos touts its drones to be “high performance jet aircraft made of special 
composite materials”; this heightens our concerns that Kratos is materially underspending to become a credible unmanned systems player


Beware History of Failure To Meet Expectations, Cash Flow Struggles More Evident: Bulls are buying into Kratos story that it can reach $800m 
of revenues (pre PSS divestiture) at 10% EBITDA margin, while generating positive free cash flow. Our analysis of its ability to hit its financial 
targets (especially free cash flow) suggests investors should brace for disappointment. In addition to recent executive turnover in key positions 
(chief accountant, drone president, and CIO), Kratos quietly started disclosing a large loss accrual on contracts, rising 500% between 2015 and 
2016. Its business mix has deteriorated (declining backlog and highest % of fixed-price, high risk contracts in its history). Its historical backlog 
definition is very aggressive, so take it with a grain of salt. However, most alarming in Q3’17 Kratos materially increased its cash burn estimate, 
cut drone capex in Q4’17, has DSOs rising to multi-year highs, and unexpectedly sold its PSS segment at a depressed value to raise cash


Analysts See +29% Upside, A Terrible Risk/Reward Considering We See 40%-70% Downside: Kratos has among the highest valuation in the 
aerospace and defense sector (20x and 70x 2018E EBITDA and P/E), despite having weak margins, poor management that cannot prevent 
activities that run afoul of laws, suspect accounting that doesn’t depreciate corporate segment assets, and a history of failure. Its valuation is at 
a multiyear high, based on the hope that this time is different. Analysts are bullish, and some arbitrarily pencil in a few dollars per share for 
“future potential drone opportunities.” Many long-term fundamental Kratos holders have ditched the stock, leaving rules-based indices to buy. 
Valuing Kratos at a discount to peers on EBITDA, free cash flow, and book value we estimate 40%-70% downside ($3.15-$6.30/sh)

Kratos CEO DeMarco


Litigation brought against CEO DeMarco while an executive at Titan Corp suggested that confidential witnesses knew he played 


an active role in fraud and was the source of “the Andersen school of accounting” – a reference to the disgraced auditing firm, 


Arthur Andersen, where Kratos’ current CFO Lund worked (though she omits it from her biography).


The shareholder litigation case was settled for $61.5m and Titan paid $28.5m in FCPA fines.

Kratos is trading at peak valuation on the inflated belief that “this time is different” and that its aspirations in the

Kratos: A Long-Term Loser 


Long-term Kratos investors have been burned, but a repositioning of the Company as a play on unmanned aerial systems (aka 


Drones) has sparked a nearly 4x increase in its share price from 2015 – near all time lows. Investors should be very concerned that  


a clawback for financial misstatement was adopted right before its stock price increased, allowing the Company to raise nearly 


$350m of equity. During this period, its Chief Accounting Officer resigned, a Director was indicted in a $20m fraud by the 


Dept. of Justice and the Company made its first disclosure of a large contract loss accrual.

Kratos: A Business Model In 
Constant Transition


Prior to 2007 we were an independent provider of outsourced engineering and network deployment services, security systems 


engineering and integration services and other technical services for the wireless communications industry, the U.S. government 


and enterprise customers. In 2006 and 2007, we undertook a transformation strategy whereby we divested our commercial 


wireless-related businesses and chose to pursue business with the federal government, primarily the U.S. Department of 


Defense, through strategic acquisitions. On September 12, 2007, we changed our name from Wireless Facilities, Inc. (WFI) 


to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (Kratos). Our new name reflects our revised focus as a defense contractor and 


security systems integrator for the federal government, for state and local agencies, and certain commercial customers.


We are a specialized technology focused security business providing mission critical products, solutions and services for 


domestic and international customers, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. Our core 


capabilities are sophisticated engineering, manufacturing, technology development, system integration, and test and evaluation 


offerings for national security platforms and programs. Our principal products and solutions are related to Command, 


Control, Communications, Computing, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (“C5ISR”). We 


offer our customers products, solutions, services and expertise to support their mission critical needs by leveraging our skills


across our core offering areas in C5ISR.

leading technology, intellectual property, proprietary product and system company focused on the U.S. and its allies’ national 


security. Kratos is a recognized industry leader in the rapid development, demonstration and fielding of high technology systems


and products at an affordable cost. Kratos’ primary focus areas are unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave 


electronics, cyber security/warfare, training systems, missile defense and combat systems. We believe that our technology, 


intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers’ programs, platforms and systems, 


providing us with sole and single source positions with our offerings is a competitive advantage and high barrier to entry into our 


markets. Our work force is primarily technically oriented and highly skilled with a significant number of employees holding national 


security clearances. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and 


intellectual property based company in our industry

Evidence of a Challenged Business Model


Share Dilution Negative Cumulative Free Cash Flow Adj EBITDA Margin and Per Share


EBITDA per share (RHS)


This historical context for those new to the “evolving” Kratos story is abysmal.


The Company has diluted shareholders at a rate of 20%+ p.a. and has generated negative cumulative free cash flow 


throughout its public history. This has resulted in just $0.53 cents of “Adjusted” EBITDA per share to existing holders.

Kratos Appeared To Be Teetering on Financial 
Destruction Prior To Its Recent “Success”


Before Kratos’ magic stock rally began in 2016, and it divested its Electronics Products Division to Ultra Electronics in June 2015, 


the Board hired an investment bank to assist in a formal review of Kratos’ strategic alternatives. (1) 


The Company’s financial condition was deteriorating significantly with Net Debt / EBITDA > 10x and EBITDA interest coverage 


hovering around 1x. Kratos’ financial condition even caught the attention of the SEC, which started issuing comment letters 


about its line of credit and conditions of default in the event of a material adverse change. (2)

Negative Operating Leverage


Kratos has been touting for years that its investment in corporate infrastructure will provide leverage to expand 


margins. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. EBITDA margins have contracted 470 bps with cash SG&A margin 


up 320 bps. Recall that Kratos acquired 10 companies with an average EBITDA margin of 16.1% - what happened?

From Kratos in 2013 : “Capitalize on Corporate Infrastructure Investments. In recent periods, we have made significant investments in our senior 


management and corporate infrastructure in anticipation of future revenue growth. These investments included hiring senior executives with significant 


experience in the national security industry, strengthening our internal controls over financial reporting and accounting staff in support of public company 


reporting requirements, and expanding our backlog and bid and proposal pipeline. We will be allocating additional resources in our pursuit of new and larger 


contract opportunities, leveraging our increased scale and robust past performance qualifications. We believe our management experience and corporate 


infrastructure are more typical of a company with a much larger revenue base than ours. We therefore anticipate that, to the extent our revenue grows, 


we will be able to leverage this infrastructure base and increase our operating margins.”   Source: 2013 10-K, p. 9

Backlog and Revenue Mix Deterioration; 
New Disclosure On Loss Accruals


The quality of Kratos business has declined in recent years. We observe it just reported its highest quarter of fixed-


price contract revenue. These contracts carry the highest risk of reduced profit and financial loss. Meanwhile, backlog 


continues to decline while the book to bill ratio hit a low of 0.8x in 2017.

Warning; Kratos just started disclosing accruals for contract losses deep in its financial footnotes, and it rose 500% YoY: “On a portion of the fixed price-


completion contracts, revenue is recognized in accordance with Topic 605 using the percentage-of-completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to 


date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract. Estimates of costs to complete include material, direct labor, overhead, and allowable indirect 


expenses for government contracts. These cost estimates are reviewed and, if necessary, revised on a contract-by-contract basis. If, as a result of this review, 


management determines that a loss on a contract is probable, then the full amount of estimated loss is charged to operations in the period. As of December 25, 


2016 and December 27, 2015, accrued expenses included the accrual for losses on contracts of $17.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.” 10-K, F-8

Aggressive Backlog Presentation


Kratos has historically used a very aggressive definition of backlog to sell investors on its investment merits. Its 10-K proclaims one of 


its “Competitive Strengths” is its “Significant cash flow visibility driven by stable backlog”; yet, a close look at how it used to define 


Total Backlog, specifically the Unfunded Backlog portion, shows that it includes both the value of unexercised options and revenue 


estimates for types of ID/IQ contracts. While this presentation is not unprecedented, it is certainly the most aggressive definition.  


No surprise, KTOS will be restating backlog sharply lower to comply with AUS 2014-09 adoption.

Backlog Description


Kratos


Unfunded backlog reflects our estimate of future revenue under awarded government contracts and task orders for which either funding has not yet 
been appropriated or the expenditure has not yet been authorized. Our total backlog does not include estimates of revenue from government wide 
acquisition contracts (“GWACs”) or General Services Administration (“GSA”) schedules beyond awarded or funded task orders, but our unfunded 
backlog does include estimates of revenue beyond awarded or funded task orders for other types of indefinite delivery or indefinite quantity 
contracts based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. Unfunded backlog also includes priced options, which consist of the 
aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as a result of a customer exercising an option period that has been specifically defined in the 
original contract award.


AeroVironment
We define unfunded backlog as the total remaining potential order amounts under cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with multiple 
one-year options, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, or IDIQ contracts.


Mantech


We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenues from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to 
such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate 
of revenues for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established 
patterns of revenues.


CACI
We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue we have the potential to realize.  On unfunded contract work, 
including amounts based on the assumed exercise of options under such contract


SAIC
Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has 
not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any 
estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles


Cubic


The difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear CGD Services contracts. Funding for these contracts 
comes from annual operating budgets of the U.S. government and the options are normally exercised annually. Funded backlog includes unfilled 
firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer (Congress, in the case of 
U.S. government agencies). Options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised. In addition to 
the amounts identified above, we have been selected as a participant in or, in some cases, the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite 
delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. ID/IQ contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received


Lockheed 
Martin


Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the 
customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential 
orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. 


Northrup
Grumman


Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised 
contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is 
exercised or awarded. For multi-year service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only 
the amounts committed by the customer.

Kratos History of Regulatory Issues


Here’s What Kratos Says


Date Kratos Regulatory Sanctions


May 2007


The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained an 
emergency asset freeze against the former stock options administrator of San Diego-
based Wireless Facilities, Inc. (WFI – now Kratos), who was charged with defrauding 
the company and its shareholders by causing the unauthorized issuance and transfer 
of over 700,000 shares of WFI stock and stock options to himself and his wife.


July 2009


Indictment Charges Civilian Navy Employees and Contractors with Fraud and 
Bribery (FBI, San Diego) The indictment also charges Jackie Godwin, a former 
manager at Kratos Defense Security Solutions, Inc. (Kratos), a large San Diego-based 
defense prime contractor, who hired the subcontractors as directed by Gary 
Alexander according to the scheme. 


June 2012


Dept. of Labor Office of Federal Contract Compliance: Compensation data provided 
by Kratos for employees as of June 1, 2012, revealed that Kratos provided lower 
compensation to the minority, female employee when compared to the similarly 
situated non-minority, male employee 


Jan 2015


Sacramento Defense Contractor Agrees To Pay $2 Million To Settle Allegations Of 
Inflating Costs (Dept. of Justice, Eastern California) Composite Engineering Inc., a 
Sacramento-based subsidiary of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions that 
manufactures remote-controlled subscale aircraft for the U.S. military, has agreed to 
pay the United States $2 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False 
Claims Act by submitting inflated costs in connection with a 2007 contract, United 
States Attorney Benjamin Wagner announced today.


June 2017


Army Colonel and Others Indicted In $20 Million Bribery and Fraud Scheme Arising 
Out Of Fort Gordon, Georgia Dwayne Fulton, 58, an employee of Kratos was indicted 
for his alleged role to solicit and bribe an army official in exchange for rigging the 
award of$20m in US Army contracts to a minority owned business. According to a 
press release, Fulton was a Director of Kratos-MRD Adv Telecom Group in Augusta


Here’s What The Evidence Suggests

Are regulatory infractions just a cost of doing business at Kratos, or emblematic of a rogue corporate culture designed 


to inflate financial results at all costs for the benefit of insider enrichment?

Has Kratos Booked Illicit Revenues And 
Will It Restate Its Financials?


New Problem Identified By Kratos Solution:  Commit Fraud on America?


Source: Kratos 2014 10-K


Kratos recently included a risk factor warning that minority-owned and other small businesses sponsored by the SBA could disadvantage 


the Company. Isn’t it peculiar that a Kratos Director Dwayne Fulton recently pled guilty to scheme involving procuring contracts under the 


guise of a minority owned small business? How much illicit revenues has Kratos booked; will it restate its financials?


A preference for minority-owned, small and small 


disadvantaged businesses could impact our ability 


to be a prime contractor on certain governmental 


procurements.


As a result of the Small Business Administration 


("SBA") set-aside program, the federal government may 


decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders 


that qualify as minority-owned, small, or small 


disadvantaged businesses. As a result, we would not 


be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those 


programs and in general would be restricted to no more 


than 49% of the work as a subcontractor on those 


programs. An increase in the amount of procurements 


under the SBA set-aside program may impact our 


ability to bid on new procurements as a prime 


contractor or restrict our ability to recompete on 


incumbent work that is placed in the set-aside program.

Kratos Latest Hype: 
Unmanned Aerial Drones
24


Kratos Unmanned Systems (Drone) 
Business Hyped Despite Abysmal Results


There is ample evidence to suggest that Kratos’ Unmanned System (“US” or “UAV”) segment is a mediocre 


combination of acquired businesses. We remind investors that segment revenues are still below 2013 levels, and 


operating profits (still negative).

cost share contract awarded in July 2016. Included in the 2013, 2014, and 2015 operating losses for the US Segment are increased costs of $7.6 million, $3.1 million, and $5.7 million respectively, primarily related to 


certain retrofits necessary to address product design changes as well as due to a contract conversion adjustment on certain of our aerial platforms


2) 2014 assets revised down from $173.2m to $166.1m without explanation


Kratos Unmanned Systems segment: consists of its unmanned aerial system and unmanned ground and seaborne system businesses. Kratos lists 


properties in this segment in San Diego, Sacramento California, and Ft. Walton Beach, Florida


Growth by Acquisitions, Business Failure Evident:  We believe the majority of the US segment reflect the acquisition of Composite Engineering Inc 


(“CEI” acquired 2012) and the legacy Micro Systems Inc (acquired from Herley Industries in 2011. Note: Herley acquired Micro Systems in 2005). It was 


reported that CEI had $94m of sales in 2011 and Micro Systems had $14m in 2004. Thus, baseline combined revenues should be ~$108m. When the 


segment was formed in 2012, total revenues reported were $92.3m (-14.% lower)


Red Flags: 1) CEI was touted as generating 25% organic growth in 2011 at acquisition, yet by the time Kratos reclassified its segments in Q4’14 to show 


US segment performance, organic growth plummeted, 2) At least one CEI founder Amy Fournier has left the firm  3) According to Kratos pro forma filings, 


CEI spent nothing on research and development costs in 2011, which appears at odds with CEI being touted as an “industry leading” drone manufacturer, 


4) Recent reviews suggest CEI’s problems are indicative of a small company in over its head (a) “They have even been known to sell technology that has 


not been invented yet” (b) “Sometimes programs are underbid and understaffed” (c) “We often find ourselves out of depth (agreeing to contracts with not 


enough time or money to execute, planning, etc.).”  4) CEI settled with the Dept. of Justice (2015) on fraud allegations that it submitted inflated costs in 


connection with a contract

Kratos: A Fringe Player In Unmanned Systems


Our research suggests that Kratos is a tiny player in the field of unmanned systems, with approximately 1% share of 


industry revenues and contract awards as a percentage of the DoD budget for drone procurement, research, 


development and construction. Investors are paying an all-time high premium valuation to bet on Kratos, a perennial 


loser, that has been challenged to execute on many of its growth opportunities in nearly 20 years

b. FY 2017 10-K “The 2017 capital expenditures included approximately $13.2 million related to investments we are making in our US segment to build Company-owned tactical aircraft and

2013. During the same period, Kratos has spent approximately $63m. We believe much of the costs have circumvented

Kratos Portfolio of Speculative Projects


Kratos management is quick to talk big revenue figures as market opportunities for projects that are speculative in nature, with a 


low probability of receiving permanent funding. Management quickly issued equity in November 2016 after leading investors to 


believe there were billions of dollars worth of revenue opportunities in Q3 2016. Major primes compete against Kratos too.

Kratos is having to fund $33m of this project, with the government

Gremlin Opportunity Hype


CEO Hyping The Gremlin Opportunity:


CEO Demarco Q3’16:  “A second new UAV contract that Kratos received is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency or DARPA 
Gremlins program, a prime Phase I contract award of $3.9 million, which we are currently performing on and we just submitted our
Gremlins Phase II proposal last week. Phase I is currently scheduled to lead to a systems requirement review in the next few months, at 
which time DARPA plans to down select the two teams issuing contracts of approximately $20 million each for Phase II preliminary
system design. In mid-2018, DARPA is expected to hold the preliminary design review and one team will be selected for Phase III, an 
estimated $40 million contract concluding with flight test in 2020. The government has indicated that the price point for the Gremlin 
aircraft will be approximately $700,000 each for order quantity lots of 1,000 once in production which could be expected approximately 
three years from now. At these estimated production levels, we believe the potential market opportunity for Gremlin type aircraft is in 
the high several hundreds of millions of dollars up into billions of dollars”


CEO Demarco Q4’16:  “However, as you know, we believe that a key reason Kratos was selected as one of the four Gremlin prime Phase 1 
contract awardees was due to Kratos' industry leading position in designing, demonstrating, producing and fielding low cost high
performance jet UAVs in a short timeframe. And today, I'm truly more confident than ever that Kratos will be producing a UAV for the 
Gremlin's program.”


Only To Go Silent On It Later:


Sheila Kahyaoglu on Q2’17 Call : “And then last question, just on Gremlins, where are we there? Is it just in -- just the past days right now 
with the 12 months or any update on that would be appropriate I guess.”


CEO Eric DeMarco: “It is very competitive, I am sorry, I did not talk about it in the script and I am not talking about it anymore. It’s 
focus time. So, I apologize.”


Kratos has a history of touting great opportunities with large “potential” markets. This time around, it has been 


promoting the Gremlin opportunity, which is still experimental in nature. Kratos is just the subcontractor on the 


program to Dynetics, which is competing with General Atomics, ranked the 33rd largest federal contractor (1,2). 


Who do you think wins? 


1) General Atomics – DARPA contracts the company for Phase 2 of the Gremlins Program – March 2017


2) GSA Top 100 Contractors, 2016 (note: Kratos did not make the top 100 list)

Serious Management and 
Governance Concerns
31


Background on Management


Kratos’ CEO and CFO have questionable pasts while formerly at Titan Corporation. Furthermore, audit committee 


member Jane Judd also served at Titan as VP/Controller. We question how “independent” her judgement may be given 


her historical acquaintance with management (1)


KTOS Executive Biography According To Company What It Fails To Mention


Eric DeMarco / CEO


Prior to Kratos, Mr. DeMarco was the President 
and Chief Operating Officer of the Titan 
Corporation, which was later acquired by L-3 
(Source: Kratos Website)


1. Lockheed Martin backed out of acquiring Titan Corp after a criminal and civil 
investigation emerged regarding Titan’s oversees business dealings (Source)


2. SEC issued a Wells Notice to Titan an SEC investigation commenced (Source)
3. Titan paid a $28.5m fine to settle criminal and civil charges that it bribed the 


president of Benin (Source)
4. Shareholder litigation charges Titan with a scheme to inflate revenues and 


book fictitious receivables. Titan’s use of “middlemen” and “private consulting 
companies” with ties to government officials to secure business  (Source)


5. The litigation says confidential witnesses claim DeMarco knew about the fraud 
and DeMarco was responsible for transferring funds to Benin. He was 
allegedly the source of the “percentage of completion accounting techniques 
learned from the ‘Andersen school of accounting’ that allowed Titan to either 
overstate or prematurely state revenues at the company”


Deanna Lund / CFO


Deanna Lund has served as Chief Financial 
Officer for Kratos since April 2004. Prior to 
joining Kratos, Ms. Lund most recently served 
as Vice President and Corporate Controller for 
the Titan Corporation. Ms. Lund is a graduate of 
San Diego State University, where she received 
her Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting, 
magna cum laude, and is a certified public 
accountant. (Source: Kratos Website)


1. Mrs Lund was also named in the shareholder litigation at Titan Corp
2. Her biography omits that she worked at Arthur Andersen LLP, the accounting 


firm notorious for having audited Enron and its creative accounting that 
favored booking cashless profits (see reference above to the Andersen school 
of accounting)


1) Kratos Board member Jane Judd sits on the audit committee. She is described as “independent” according to the proxy statement. However, we note that 


Ms. Judd was Vice President and Corporate Controller of The Titan Corporation from April 1986 to May 1996.

Kratos CEO DeMarco


Litigation brought against CEO DeMarco while an executive at Titan Corp suggested that confidential witnesses knew he played 


an active role in fraud and was the source of “the Andersen school of accounting” – a reference to the disgraced Arthur 


Andersen firm where Kratos’ current CFO Lund worked (though she omits it from her biography).


The shareholder litigation case was settled for $61.5m and Titan paid $28.5m in FCPA fines.

Management has virtually nothing at risk and limited alignment with shareholders. 


The Compensation Committee and/or the Chief Executive Officer also 


retain the right to exclude extraordinary charges or other special 


circumstances in determining whether the objectives were met during any 


particular fiscal year and may decide to grant 100% of the targeted cash 


bonus award, even if the financial targets do not fall within the specified 


range, based upon an evaluation of business conditions, industry trends, and 


additional accomplishments achieved. Based on a 40/60 allocation of non-


financial and strategic achievements versus financial achievements for corporate 


executive officers, the Compensation Committee made the decision to grant 


100% of the non-financial achievements (or 40% of the targeted cash bonus 


award) and 66.7% of the financial achievements (or 40% of the targeted cash 


bonus award), for an aggregate 80% of the total targeted cash bonus award.

Management Terrible At Hitting Guidance


Management has shown limited ability to forecast its business accurately in the past few years. This gives us little 


confidence in trusting their longer term outlook. We note that management has proven terrible at forecasting its free 


cash flow, with the biggest misses from initial guidance.

Inability To Generate Free Cash Flow, 
Now Selling Assets At Depressed Values


Kratos raised 2017 revenue guidance twice, but could not increase its EBITDA forecast. In Q3’17 management significantly 


increased its cash flow burn guidance. The explanation was related to certain milestones in the unmanned systems and public 


safety business of $26-$28m expected to occur in Q1 and Q2 2018. Kratos touted its Q4 and full year results “exceeded” estimates, 


but digging beneath the surface everything is not rosy. We find that Kratos dramatically curtailed Unmanned System capital 


spending and unexpectedly sold its PSS division for $70m at a depressed valuation (0.5x  and 6.5x ‘18E Sales and EBITDA, 


respecitively) to raise cash, but still says it will generate free cash flow of  $12-$19m in 2018. Something doesn’t add up!

2) Per management guidance, adjusted for PSS divestiture which was forecast for 2018 to produce $140-$150m of sales and $9 - $12m of EBITDA. We note that Kratos’ EBITDA

Warning From Rising Days Sales 
Outstanding (DSOs)


Elevated DSOs signal cash flow collection issues. The problem is also suggested by an accounts payable specialist 


posting on the company review website Glassdoor. Kratos is now expanding discussion about DSO in its 10-K. 


Jan 19, 2017 from Accounts Payable Specialist: “They [Kratos] could 
never pay their bills during the time I was there. Terms were net 90 for 
every vendor expect ones like SDG&E, etc. It was stressful because of this, 
causing non stop credit holds, non stop emails from vendors wanting 
payment, statements to review that had months of bills entered but not 
paid. I couldn't wait to leave. The office supply area was completely bare 
and empty. It was hard to order supplies. Many temps would buy their 
own supplies and bring them in. Supplies such as inboxes, file folders, etc, 
that should have ben provided by the company” Source: Glassdoor

and for certain flight requirements that must be fulfilled on certain aerial 
target programs, or final billings which are not due until completion on 
certain of our large critical infrastructure deployment projects and large

Questionable Accounting Could Enable 
Segment Margin Misstatement


Spruce Point has concerns about Kratos’ accounting methods. For example, the Company reports assets, but not 


Capex, by business segment. However, when allocating depreciation and amortization it conveniently fails to attribute 


any portion to corporate activities, its fastest growing segment. Management cannot be ignorant on this issue, as the 


CEO and CFO came from Titan Corp, where they disclosed Capex and corporate depreciation and amortization (1). How 


can any investor have confidence in Kratos’ segment margins, when costs are clearly not being allocated correctly.

This Time Is Different Right?


Sell-side analysts have amnesia when it comes to Kratos and its ability to hit its financial targets. As we’ve noted 


previously, the Company’s inability to consistently hit targets should give analysts skepticism not to take management’s 


targets at face value. Furthermore, Kratos should not receive among the highest multiple in the industry. 


Analyst blindly pencils in 


KTOS’s ambitious 60% 


increase in EBITDA, though we 


have demonstrated its 


repeatedly failures to hit targets


So you award Kratos one of the 


highest multiples in the defense 


sector for below average 


industry margins, and highest 


risk revenue profile?

Irrational Valuation Expansion

Enterprise Value / Revenues Enterprise Value / Adj EBITDA Price / Book Value


Current investors are paying a significant premium to the Company’s historical valuation.


Spruce Point finds it difficult to justify Kratos’ valuation expansion in light of its history of disappointment, 


unproven drone opportunities, questionable business practices, shrinking backlog, and rising cash burn.

KTOS Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


KTOS is trying to position itself as a play on drones to justify its valuation relative to a limited universe of pure-play 


stocks such as AeroVironment, which Spruce Point previously profiled as a repeated loser. Wall Street is fixated on 


Kratos’ earnings “potential” of >100% growth in the next few years and give KTOS a commanding 20x and 70x 


EBITDA and P/E ratio.  Be warned: this growth is off a low EPS base, on highly adjusted figures, and will surely 


disappoint given Kratos demonstrated ability to poorly execute.

• Kratos’ premium valuation of earnings and EBITDA does 


not reconcile with its below average financial 


performance and mix of revenue quality


• The Company has the highest % of revenues from fixed-


price contracts, which are the riskiest contracts that 


expose Kratos to cost overruns. 


• Not surprisingly, the Company has often failed to 


generate cash flow and has below industry margins –


reflective of its inability to execute


• The Company and sell-side analysts have bought into 


Kratos’ dream that it can expand EBITDA margins to 


10%, but this remains entirely a “show me” story

Kratos’ current 2018E EBITDA multiple of 20x is 
ridiculously higher than its peers at 12x. We don’t 
trust management’s EBITDA figure to begin with 
given our documented evidence of accounting 
concerns (including not depreciating $126m of 


corporate assets). We apply a discounted multiple of 
10x – 12x EBITDA to reflect its below average margin 
profile, low revenue quality, and poor management

Kratos’ assets have historically traded between 0.7x 
to 1.4x. We could argue that Kratos should trade 


below book value because it continues to burn cash. 
Even giving Kratos the benefit of the doubt it can 


stop the cash bleed, and generate cash this year, we 
apply a 1.0x – 1.5x range

Kratos has offered 2018 free cash flow guidance of 
$12 to $19m. Giving it the benefit of the doubt for 
hitting this target, and applying a generous 20-25x 
multiple (commensurate with peers that generate 
consistent free cash flow, [Kratos does not]), we 


estimate almost 70% – 90% downside


$ in millions, except per share amounts


There is no way to justify Kratos’ inflated valuation.


Downside based on $10.50/share. Includes the impact of the PSS segment divesture which we assume sold for 1x book value


Note: Analysis does not factor in federal tax loss carryforwards of $390.7 million and various state tax loss carryforwards of $348.7 million. The federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to 


expire in 2020 and state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 in certain states
