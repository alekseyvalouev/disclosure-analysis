On this list, Focus Media is the 8th largest company in the world in this space.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: The mysterious case of the disappearing competitor: Focus Media edition

Peculiarly Focus Media is nowhere to be seen on this list (by the end of 2009 it should have risen to
fifth place). 
 
Focus Media is no longer mentioned in JCDecaux's 2010 and 2011 accounts. 
 
Why? 
 
Well I can think of two hypotheses: 
 
The first is that JCDecaux want to sustain their claim of being the biggest display advertising business
in China - a claim that is simply not tenable if they include Focus Media in the comparison. Moreover
they don't want to increase the credibility with advertisers of Focus Media and its products. After all
Focus Media has substantially outperformed JCDecaux in China - growing much faster and at much
fatter margins. 
 
An alternative hypothesis is that they don't believe Focus Media's numbers.

PS. I first found these lists when researching China Media Express. CCME supposedly competed with
JCDecaux in placing adverts on public transport (in CCME's case mostly buses including airport
buses). CCME however was a complete fraud and the stock now trades at 2c. Focus Media is
obviously real - their displays are widespread.
