LDK Writes Off Its Allegedly


‘Unusable’ Inventory


LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK $5.50) issued a release on


February 18th stating it expected to report a loss for the


fourth quarter, after taking an inventory writedown of $210


to $220 million.


In December 2007, asensio.com reported on a controversy


surrounding LDK’s accounting of its inventories. LDK’s


former controller, Charley Situ, alleged that the company


in�ated its inventory �gures, and that as much as two-thirds


of the inventory was “possibly unusable” raw material.


On December 11, 2007 Manuel P. Asensio sent a letter to


LDK’s legal counsel who chose the audit committee to


investigate the company’s inventory following Situ’s


allegations. The letter discusses irregularities surrounding


the investigation. To read the letter, click here.


An article in Barron’s from February 20th cites an analyst


opinion on the recently announced inventory write-down,


stating “Were it not for the overhang of this whistle-blowing


incident, LDK’s $210 to $220 million inventory write-down on


Wednesday would likely have been accepted as normal in


today’s market where solar PV wafers are facing rapid price


declines. However, investors were quick to notice that the


write-down amount matched closely the ‘two-thirds’
