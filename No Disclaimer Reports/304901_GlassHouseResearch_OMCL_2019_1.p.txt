Ominous Omnicell, Inc. (OMCL) Delays the Inevitable 























Who is GlassHouse Research? GlassHouse Research (GHR) is made up of former forensic 


accountants/analysts who have worked for prominent hedge funds on Wall Street, as well as 


boutique forensic accounting firms. Our purpose is to expose public companies that have been 


taking advantage of US GAAP as well as IFRS accounting for their benefit. We seek to find 


companies where GAAP (or even worse, non-GAAP) earnings are deviating from true economic 


earnings of the target firm. 


Overall, we search for evidence of a “culture of fraud” within public companies.

Initiation of Omnicell, Inc., (OMCL) with a Target Price of $35.50  


(59% downside) 
 


Significant declines in revenue and earnings await Omnicell as the company has 


obfuscated its financials by prematurely recognizing revenue in prior periods 


and failing to write-off legacy inventory.  
 


• Omnicell possesses one of the worst net AR positions we have seen within 


a public company. Concealed long-term receivables and declining deferred 


revenues lead us to believe the company prematurely recognized 


approximately $38.3 million in sales over the LTM. The company may need 


to restate financials based on the magnitude of these inauspicious trends.  





• OMCL grossly mismanaged its inventory and now carries a highly bloated 


inventory balance that needs to be written off as obsolete. We calculate at 


minimum, management needs to write-off over $23 million (22.4% of total) 


of obsolete inventory.  





• Anomalous surges in both capitalized expenses and prepaid commissions 


lead us to believe that the firm has accelerated the capitalization of normal 


expenses over the LTM. Our analysis points to $38.0 million in additional 


capitalized expenses that we believe should have been expensed. This 


represents a tailwind of $0.72 to TTM non-GAAP EPS (30% of non-GAAP 


EPS).  





• The lack of accounting experience among the CFO, audit chairman and 


audit committee present massive red flags to GlassHouse at a time when 


accounting gimmicks are highly prevalent at Omnicell.

Key Similarities Between Omnicell and Prior Exposed Companies 


GlassHouse juxtaposes both Omnicell and the past transgressions of other fraudulent 


companies. We believe that many of these accounting gimmicks listed below by prior firms 


may have been utilized by current Omnicell management. 


Key Characteristic Omnicell (OMCL) Similar Accounting Red Flag & Outcome 


Recognizing 
Revenue 


Prematurely 


Based on comments made by 


management and analysis of receivables 


and deferred revenues, GHR opines that 


Omnicell management has subjectively 


recorded revenue prematurely in the 


revenue recognition process. We believe 


the amount is highly material and will 


reverse in upcoming periods.  


A prior company researched by GlassHouse, 


Electronics for Imaging (EFII) reported similar 


trends with both AR and deferred revenues. 


Subsequent to our report, EFII needed to 


postpone and restate prior earnings as the firm 


reported issues with “assessments of the timing 


of recognition of revenue”. The stock dropped 


over 40% on this news on 08/03/17. 


Mismanagement 
of Inventory 
Accounting 


Management has tried to explain away 


the bloating of inventory on the balance 


sheet for the last three years with no 


reprieve in sight. DSI levels have now 


reached a 10-year high value of 89 days. 


We believe management procured excess 


inventory and will need to write-off 


millions of inventory in future periods. 


Medical device company and peer Natus Medical 


(BABY) reported similar spikes of inventory metrics 


with DSIs rising at an alarming pace. We opined 


that the company needed to write-off millions in 


excess inventory. A week after our report was 


released, BABY reported substantial reductions in 


gross margins due to “inventory reserve” write-


offs in Q4 2018. The stock dropped 11.2% on Q4 


2018 earnings. BABY is now down 22% since our 


report was released on 02/05/19. 


Unusual 
Capitalizing of 


Expenses 


Both the company’s capitalized software 
and prepaid commission accounts have 
skyrocketed over the past year. These 
expenses contain high subjectivity from 
management as these expenditures could 
either be classified as an asset or expense.  
 
Specifically looking at capitalized 
expenses, these expenditures circumvent 
the income statement and represent 
future heightened expenses that will 
pressure margins. Also, R&D costs have 
highly bifurcated from these trends 
leading us to believe management has 
decided to capitalize more costs than 
expense.  


Prior disclosed fraud, Winners Internet Network 
from the early 2000s, reported similar capitalized 
metrics as OMCL. Here the SEC accused the 
company of improper capitalization of software 
costs during a three-year timespan.  
 
Specifically, the SEC alleged that Winners 
improperly capitalized wages, payroll taxes, rent, 
travel, marketing, and consulting expenses that 
were purportedly associated with the 
development of their software. Furthermore, the 
costs were incurred after a certain date where the 
software was available for general release to 
customers. The firm’s stock price lost substantially 
all of its value after these fraudulent actions were 
revealed.

Omnicell Financials Are Set to Unravel in H2 2019 


 
The past two years in Omnicell’s (OMCL) history have been vital to management’s future 


growth plans as the company has introduced three major product lines; some that have 


replaced older legacy models. The XT series (decentralized pharmacy), XR2 (centralized 


pharmacy), and the IVX Workflow and Cloud product lines have been central to the recent run 


up in OMCL’s stock price as customers have been upgrading to the newer systems. However, 


while management is quick to paint a rosy picture of heightened sales and earnings as 


customers upgrade, our analysis points to something different happening at Omnicell. 





Based on comments made by OMCL management, investors are being led to believe that the 


company’s recent revenue and earnings gains stem primarily from organic sources. This 


sentiment has been reflected in OMCL’s stock price, which has almost doubled since the 


beginning of 2018. And while GHR does believe there is some merit to OMCL’s product lines 


within the healthcare industry, we opine that the company’s current stock price is highly 


inflated and has been based on faux revenue and earnings over 2018 & 2019.  





After going through countless filings, earnings calls and presentations, we believe that OMCL 


management has been using a variety of accounting gimmicks to turn around a company that 


previously reported depressed margins and earnings. Based on our extensive experience 


researching accounting frauds, we take issue with both the quantity and scope of financial 


engineering used by management over the past two years. Too many accounting anomalies 


took place on the income statement, balance sheet and within the footnotes for GHR to believe 


these actions were not purposeful in nature.  





When we analyze Omnicell’s accounts receivable (AR), inventory, and capitalized expense 


diagnostics, we find a company that we believe has been manipulating its accounting for 


significant gains to the income statement. However, in our experience, the manipulation of all 


these balance sheet accounts points to future share price degradation in upcoming periods as 


these issues tend to violently reverse.

Management’s Comments Regarding Receivables Spike Are Not Plausible 
 


Delving into the crux of our thesis when looking at OMCL’s accounts receivable (AR) balances, 


we believe that management has been recognizing revenue prematurely with respects to their 


performance obligations. We find this more concerning than a collectability issue, as this type 


of accounting concern ends up with material revenue shortfalls in future periods. Below, we 


detail OMCL’s unfavorable AR trends and how we believe this will impact revenue and earnings 


going forward:  





• In the latest period, current AR grew by 6.7% YOY to $203.5 million. As a result, Omnicell’s 


days-sales-outstanding (DSO)1 levels stood at 90 days and 88 days of 3M DSO and 12M DSO, 


respectively at Q1 2019. This represented an increase of 7.6% YOY from Q1 2018 (12M 


DSO). We view the current levels of 90 days to be extremely heightened from an absolute 


level as the firm is now waiting approximately three months to get paid on its products. 


Furthermore, we point out in the next section that the true DSO value actually lies much 


higher than 90 days when including long-term AR and factored receivables.  





• Looking at the long-term trend of DSO values, we see an inauspicious pattern of longer and 


longer receivables cycles at OMCL. Dating back to 2013, we see that the company 


consistently reported DSO values within historical and peer group ranges from 50 to 60 


days. However, since this time, DSO values have been on a consistent rise with very limited 


or inconsistent explanations given by management as discussed in the next section. To put 


things into perspective, the current DSO value of 88 days now lies 63% above the 2012 


ending balance of only 54 days (see Chart 1, Page 8).  





• Turning to ending AR balances, we find similar results when analyzing the firm’s AR-to-sales 


metrics. Three-month and 12M balances stand well above their five-year averages at 


100.5% and 25.2% respectively. Moreover, OMCL’s AR-to-3M sales ratio stands at the 


fourth highest ratio reported in any period over the past five years.  





• Management provides their own calculation of DSO values in every conference call that 


slightly differs from our calculation; however, the adverse trend still is highly apparent. In 


the latest period, management discloses a value of 93 days, the second highest value ever 


reported by OMCL, only to the 97-day value reported in Q1 of last year.  





                                                           
1 Three-month days sales outstanding (3M DSO) = Average total AR QOQ / 3M Sales * 91.25
GlassHouse Research 


6 | P a g e  
 


• For reference, the last time OMCL reported a DSO near these levels at 95 days in Q2 2015, 


the firm’s stock price drew down by 33% afterwards in H2 2015. Again, we believe OMCL’s 


current predicament lies in a much worse place today than in 2015.  





Hidden Long-Term Receivables Metrics Exacerbate OMCL’s Dire Situation 


 
Further diving into OMCL’s receivable footnotes, GHR finds more concerning metrics that 


suggest Omnicell will face material sales headwinds over the next year as it deals with billing 


issues. In addition to OMCL’s trade receivables which it stores under current assets, the 


company also stores both long-term sales-type leases and unbilled receivables in “Other Long-


Term Assets” on the balance sheet. Readers familiar with our work know we view these long-


term receivables as the worst forms of revenue quality out there as they carry the highest risk.  





• Illustrating this, we observe that sales-type leases and long-term unbilled AR currently stand 


at $19.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively, as of 03/31/19. When we add these figures 


to the current receivables balance, we find that the company is in a much worse position 


than they are leading on.  





• For example, we see that management is patting themselves on the back for reporting a 


bloated DSO metric of 93 days in the Q1 2019 earnings call. However, when we add these 


hidden receivables back into our 3M DSO metric, this causes the current value to surge up 


to 109 days in Q1 2019; this represents the second highest value ever reported by OMCL. 


Twelve-month DSO also hit an all-time high, increasing by 10% to 106 days in the period 


(see Chart 1, Page 8).  





• GHR finds it to be quite misleading by OMCL management to only report a DSO balance only 


using trade receivables. In fact, we point out that long-term AR is the riskiest form of 


receivable balance and it should without-a-doubt be included in their given metric to 


analysts. For example, if management wanted to conceal a poor DSO metric in any given 


period, management could subjectively move trade AR into “Other Long-term Assets” on 


the balance sheet to hide the unwanted receivables.  





• Unbilled receivables on a balance sheet specifically mean that the company recognized 


revenue, but has yet to invoice the client, directly contrasting from CFO Kuipers’ 


explanations detailed in the next section. GHR also wants to point out that ASC 606 


adjustments were not to blame for the rise in receivables either, as the pronouncement 


only impacted Omnicell’s AR balance by $819,000 on 12/31/17.
GlassHouse Research 


7 | P a g e  
 


• To make matters worse for OMCL, the firm is factoring its receivables, as evident in the 


footnote below from the 2018 10K. This balance has increased by 39.4% and 16.5% in 2017 


and 2018 respectively; far outpacing the recent rise in sales. We believe management may 


be factoring its receivables at a heightened pace to mask the firm’s already bloated AR 


balance. The problem with this is that the action is only transitory in nature and cannot stop 


the eventual rise in AR balance; plus the firm takes a loss on the sale of these receivables, 


pressuring margins. If we add these values back to AR, we calculate an astonishing DSO 


balance of 126 days at the end of 2018.2  


 
Sales of Accounts Receivable 





The Company records the sale of its accounts receivables as in accordance with accounting 


guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets. The Company transferred non-


recourse accounts receivable totaling $46.6 million, $40.0 million, and $28.7 million during 


fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which approximated fair value, to leasing 


companies on a non-recourse basis. Accounts receivable balance included 


approximately $10.6 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million due from third-party leasing 


companies for transferred non-recourse accounts receivable as of December 31, 


2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Chart 1: OMCL Long-Term DSO Trends 








Omnicell Management Continues to Move Goalposts and Gives Elucidations that Do 


Not Hold Water 
 


Dating back to 2014, then CFO Robin Seim stated that he believed the firm’s expected DSO 


range would lie between 65 and 75 days. Subsequently, when DSOs again began to trend out of 


line in Q3 2015, the newly appointed CFO Peter Kuipers echoed the same sentiment that OMCL 


would look to improve on this metric next period. 
 





Since Q3 2015, management has stayed fairly silent regarding the persistent rise in DSO and AR 


values. In fact, we find it quite misleading that management dodged questions regarding the 


heightened levels of DSO values in the latest quarter. Specifically, CFO Kuipers disclosed in the

"Going forward, we expect our DSO to be

- Omnicell CFO Q4 2014 Earnings Call


We generally expect DSO to be in the 65 to 75 days 


range. We review the collectability of our own 


receivables regularly and we do not believe the 


fluctuation of DSO are indicative of a change in our 


rate of bad debt.  


                                     -CFO Peter Kuipers
GlassHouse Research 


9 | P a g e  
 


Q1 2019 earnings call, “OMCL’s DSO value of 93 days were down four days from the first 


quarter of 2018. The decrease was mostly driven by strong collections.”  





GHR finds this highly disingenuous, as it is all Mr. Kuipers decided to say on the subject. We 


point out that the firm’s 93 days value is the third highest ever reported by the company, but 


apparently the company is patting themselves on the back for not being as bad as the 


disastrous levels of Q1 2018. Let’s not forget that the current value now stands 23 days above 


the firm’s self-reported target range for DSO values.  





So, what is going on with OMCL and their receivables? Management is quick to point out that 


this rise does not stem from a collectability issue and we at GHR tend to agree with them. 


However, our analysts at GHR actually believe that something more nefarious may be at play 


here. Dating back to 2014, GHR found eight instances of OMCL management blaming the firm’s 


ominous DSO balance on “timing of billing.” However, herein lies the problem for Omnicell and 


their argument that does not hold water to us or any accountant out there. In Q3 2018 for 


instance, CFO Kuipers explains that recent DSO value of 93 days at the time was due to the 


following: 


 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding for the third quarter were 93 days, up 7 days 


from the second quarter in 2018. The increase is mostly driven by timing of billing during 


the quarter. Based on our customer agreements, we largely invoice upon shipments. 


Generally, shipments and related billings in the last month of the quarter become revenue in 


the following quarter after installation is completed. The month of September 2018 was a 


record billing month. 





Kuipers, who is not licensed as a CPA in the U.S. and carries more of a FP&A work history, does 


not appear to give a valid explanation as to why the firm’s receivables balance continues to 


outpace sales period after period in the long term. Here, he states that billings become revenue 


in the quarter after installation is completed, but in previous statements he claims that they 


invoice upon shipment.  





These two statements conflict with each other and do not explain the recent rise in DSO values; 


in fact they would explain the opposite. If this statement from Kuipers was true, we would see 


AR values plummeting relative to sales. What Mr. Kuipers fails to understand is that when the 


firm’s AR balance (both billed and unbilled AR) continues to rise at an accelerated rate, it 


suggests that OMCL is recognizing revenue earlier on in the sales cycle compared to previous 


periods by jamming in sales at the end of the quarter.
GlassHouse Research 


10 | P a g e  
 


In fact, we point out that OMCL also carries unbilled receivables on its balance sheet. This form 


of AR is revenue that has been recognized in the period, even before the invoice has been sent 


out to the client! The transaction Mr. Kuipers is describing is more akin to deferred revenues, 


which would be stored as a current liability (recent deferred revenue trends do not suggest this 


is occurring in any way).  





Specifically, he is suggesting that the client receive shipment of the product and is invoiced, 


however NO revenue is recorded until installation is completed in the following quarter. Again, 


OMCL cannot debit (increase) AR unless revenue is being credited. Therefore, under this bizarre 


scenario Mr. Kuipers is describing, OMCL’s AR balance would actually be going down.  





A more likely scenario would be the following at OMCL: the firm has been recognizing revenue 


at an accelerated rate relative to historical norms at the end of each period (i.e. recognizing 


revenue prematurely), which would then cause the firm’s AR balance to spike to anomalous 


levels. Because the clients are being invoiced at a later point in time, they still pay within the 


60-day normalized timeframe, again not a collectability issue. However, the problem now lies 


within taking revenue from future periods to meet current estimates, and we all know how that 


ends up for companies that try this. Time and time again, management explains how the DSO 


rise is not attributable to collection/credit concerns. If we are to believe them, the only other 


explanation is that the company is recognizing revenue prematurely, leading to non-recurring 


gains to the top-line.   





Our thesis is further corroborated by statements made by CEO Randall Lipps when discussing 


the delayed rollouts of the XT series pharmacy in Q4 2017:  


 
Analyst 





First question, maybe you could give us an update on the implementations. It sounds like 


there have been a couple sticking points here the last couple of quarters. Obviously, when 


you've got a new platform rollout, such as XT, that's the software as well as the hardware, 


you would expect maybe a couple hiccups. But it seems to be these are dragging on a little 


bit. Maybe if you could provide an update on that front. 





Randall A. Lipps, CEO 





Well, I think there are a couple of dynamics that are changing, but one of them is the orders 


are getting very large. And therefore, the implementation pieces are getting very large. And 


so it's a little blockier, which is -- it's not a bad thing. But when somebody slows it down, it 


slows down a larger block of implementations. And the team has gotten better and better 


every quarter at setting up the installations and moving those forward. And I think that, 


certainly, for 2018, we have built in a plan that allows for more of these last-minute changes 


if we get them, just because backlog has backed up even a little more.
GlassHouse Research 


11 | P a g e  
 





So there's no individual reason why some of these accounts get pushed off. They're always 


for different reasons. But it's just that the size of some of these single installations are at the 


size that it does impact the revenue. 





Analyst 





One question, just in terms of the outlook and then a couple of housekeeping items. So first, 


we've seen 2 quarters in a row where you've had this issue with implementations. 


Understanding that it's difficult to sort of get the customer to move in the larger 


implementations, but do you think relative to your guidance for 2018, you've factored in 


some of these issues -- do you think you adequately reflected some of these 


implementation, if you want call them, challenges that you've had the last couple of 


quarters? 





Randall A. Lipps, CEO 





Definitely. We've shifted both our strategy with our customers, the way we've positioned 


particular Q1 to make sure that -- to be conservative in case something happens. I just think -


- I'm like you. The last 2 quarters, I said, "That's enough of this." And so this year's plan is 


built on not doing that anymore. 





While these delayed implementations fully corroborate our thesis, Mr. Lipps has stated that 


these implementation concerns have been fixed in later periods. However, in the latest 


earnings call we continue to see issues pop up: 
 


Randall A. Lipps, CEO 





The implementations are always a little bit longer in that sense in that we usually have to do 


some preparatory work and redesign maybe in a pharmacy to get some of those installs done.  





Based on these comments made by management that suggest that installation and 


implementation of Omnicell’s new products are taking longer than expected, we believe that 


management may have possessed high motivation to recognize revenue prematurely in order 


to meet revenue targets. As the evidence suggests, OMCL is not facing a collectability issue 


from its customers, therefore the only other explanation for the unfavorable receivable trends 


is management recognizing revenue in advance of meeting its performance obligations. This 


directly conflicts with CFO Kuipers comments about “timing” and “deferring” revenue on the 


income statement until the next period.

Deferred Revenues Suggest Lower Quality of Revenues 
 


When analyzing companies that have a spiking AR balance, we also need to make sure that the 


firm’s deferred revenue (DR) balance does not offset this rise with a rise of its own. If the firm is 


pulling in more cash in the form of deferred revenue, this usually alleviates most our concern 


for the AR increase. However, this is not the case for Omnicell. When we dive into the deferred 


revenue footnotes, we find a scenario similar to what management explained for their DSO 


increase above:  


 
Note 9. Deferred Revenues  


Short-term deferred revenues of $81.8 million and $78.8 million include deferred revenues 


from product sales and service contracts, net of deferred cost of sales of 


$11.1 million and $16.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 


respectively.  





The short-term deferred revenues from product sales relate to delivered and invoiced 


products, pending installation and acceptance, expected to occur within the next twelve 


months. 
 


 
A contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services for which we have received 


consideration, or for which an amount of consideration is due from the customer. Contract 


liabilities include customer deposits under non-cancelable contracts, and current and non-


current deferred revenue balances. Our contract balances are reported in a net contract asset 


or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.  


 
However, none of what Mr. Kuipers stated still makes any sense, as deferred revenues have 
been on a consistent downtrend relative to sales in the last five years. On top of that, we would 
expect a CFO of a company to know the difference between accounts receivable and deferred 
revenue, but based on his flawed explanations, we are not so sure at the moment. Below, we 
detail OMCL’s recent negative deferred revenue trends: 
 


• When analyzing both current and non-current DR balances, we find that DR actually 


decreased by 3.9% YOY to $100.4 million in Q1 2019. Again, from a quality of revenue 


standpoint, our analysts would like to see deferred revenues increasing, especially when 


relative to sales. When unearned revenues increase on the balance sheet, this added cash 


acts as a “down payment” by the client and virtually guarantees future revenues on the 


income statement. 





• Here we find the opposite impact has been plaguing OMCL. Relative to 3M sales, DR has 


decreased by 765 bps YOY to 49.6%, representing a five-year seasonal low for the company. 


This compares unfavorably with the five-year seasonal average of 60.2%. Longer-term
GlassHouse Research 


13 | P a g e  
 


metrics report similar discouraging trends with DR falling by 156 bps YOY to 12.4% relative 


to 12M sales.  





• Days-of-deferred revenues (DDR)3 also reported material degradation by falling 10.3% 


(9.1%) YOY to 43 days (44 days) as referenced on Table 2, Page 14. Both figures represented 


a new five-year low for the firm. Ouch.  





• As stated above, our analysts like to judge net receivables and deferred revenues trends to 


get a full picture of the firm’s quality of revenues. In most cases, we expect to see 


companies with a net balance near $0 or negative, as the firm’s deferred balance is above 


AR. This was the case for Omnicell in the years preceding 2013, suggesting strong quality of 


revenues.  





• In Omnicell’s case, net AR reached its third highest absolute level (only to Q3 & Q4 2018), 


increasing by 17.4% YOY to $143.0 million. This absolute value stands at an extremely high 


level for the company, especially when we see that this balance stood at a negative $1.3 


million only four years ago.  





• As one would expect, relative to quarterly sales, net AR jumped by 391 bps to 70.6%, 


representing the second highest ratio recorded in any period. Twelve-month net AR-to-sales 


reported a similar increase of 140 bps to 17.7%. Make no mistake about it, these are 


absolutely terrible net figures reported by OMCL and very rarely seen to this extent in our 


experience.  





• Overall, the continued increase of receivables coupled with the deterioration of unearned 


revenue metrics lead us to believe that the quality of OMCL’s recent sales is at extremely 


low levels. Based on our experience, we expect to see a material drop off of revenues in 


future periods as a result. This is corroborated by the excerpt above detailing contract 


liabilities as being “customer deposits under non-cancelable contracts”.  





• To quantify the impact that recognizing this revenue earlier relative to historical standards 


has had on performance, we can reverse engineer OMCL’s net AR balance using the firm’s 


net DSO value reported in Q1 2018 (47 days). As a result, we calculate that OMCL 


recognized an astonishing $38.3 million more in revenue (also pure margin gains) over the 


TTM. This considerable figure also translates to a tailwind of 72-cents in EPS over the last 


year, or 30.2% of non-GAAP EPS!

GHR Believes that Omnicell Mismanaged Inventory Levels and Needs to  


Write Off Approximately $23.3 million of Excess Inventory  
 


In our extensive history researching frauds and earnings management within public companies, 


one of the strongest indicators lies within concurrent spikes within both receivables and 


subsequently inventories as we see here with Omnicell. What this suggests is that delays or 


implementation issues leads to management recognizing revenue prematurely (i.e. rise in 


DSOs), and thus causing a spike in days-sales-of-inventory (DSI). 





When screening all public companies for significant rises within both DSO and DSI metrics, we 


find Omnicell’s extended rise (both DSO and DSI) from 50 to 90 days to be one of the worst 


within all public companies. Management has been regurgitating the same old reasoning of 


building up inventory for future sales dating back to 2016. However, GHR believes something 


more nefarious is at play here as we think management has quietly been writing-off inventory 


in recent periods. Similar to our last short, Natus Medical (BABY), it appears that analysts are 


completely blind to the highly growing balance of inventory on the company’s balance sheet, as 


inventories have been rarely discussed in recent conference calls. In this regard, we understand 


that Omnicell has come out with three new significant product lines. However, we find the 


material rise in inventory to be a gross mismanagement of inventory levels dating back to 2014.  





Diving into Omnicell’s inventory diagnostics, GHR finds an excess of accounting concerns which 


all point to the fact that OMCL has: 1) grossly mismanaged its inventory procurement in recent 


years and/or 2) refusing to write-down their obsolete inventory in order to keep margins 


artificially healthy. With prior revenue and earnings metrics waning in 2016 and new product 


lines coming out in 2017 and 2018, we believe that CEO Randall Lipps and CFO Peter Kuipers 


were highly motivated to increase sales/margins and may have resorted to these accounting 


gimmicks in order achieve this. Overall, our research has pointed to OMCL’s new product lines 


previously being pushed onto hospitals, GPOs, and customers to the point where they are 


stuffed with products and hesitant to procure any more inventory; especially when dealing with 


implementation issues. To make matters worse, it appears that management’s visibility into 


future buying trends of its customers were highly inaccurate based on comments from 


management and inventory trends dating back to 2016. 





Thus, with only unfavorable options on the table for OMCL, we believe our inventory analysis 


puts a time catalyst of OMCL’s share price decline (within one-to-three quarters). Below we 


detail OMCL’s unfavorable recent inventory metrics:
GlassHouse Research 


16 | P a g e  
 


• Similar to OMCL’s prior receivable balances, the company actually carried normalized levels 


of inventory dating back to five years ago. And similar to the spike in AR, we find a 


concurrent rise in inventory with the never-ending explanation of more sales coming in 


future periods. Illustrating this trend, we report that Omnicell reported a typical days-sales-


of-inventory (DSI)4 balance between 50 and 60 days dating back to 2014. However, since 


that time, DSIs have risen in a stair-step fashion all the way to near 90 days level (see Chart 


3, below).  





• While the current 3M DSI balance is slightly down on a YOY basis, the 89-day value is the 


third-highest value ever reported in any quarter by the company going back over 10 years. 


For reference, the five-year seasonal average for Omnicell’s DSIs stand at 74 days. Twelve-


month DSIs actually increased by 10.4% YOY to 89 days at 03/31/19, representing a new 


five-year high and dwarfing the average of only 70 days.  





• OMCL’s inventory-to-quarterly-sales metric also portrays a harbinger for future margin 


compression as this metric currently stands at 51.3% at the end of Q1 2019; the third-


highest value ever reported. Inventory-to-12M-sales follow a similar pattern standing at 


12.9%, well above the five-year average of 11.1%.

Distinct Inventory Metrics Show that Omnicell’s Needs to Impair Excess Inventory  
 


• As explained in the next section, GHR wondered if OMCL was procuring more of its XT and 


CBM series on top of XR2 and IVX units to build for future sales. When analyzing OMCL’s 


future sales figures and their history, the numbers do not point to this being the case. Using 


consensus sales estimates for future periods, we can analyze inventory relative to future 


sales to see if these figures are historically within norms for Omnicell.  





• After interpreting our analysis, we actually found that metrics were hazardously high for the 


firm. Even as analysts predict low-double-digit growth for Omnicell over the next year, there 


appears to be an excess of current inventory built on the balance sheet that will not subside 


in future periods. Relative to forward 3M and 6M sales, we find that inventory stands at 


48.5% and 22.2%, respectively, as of 03/31/19. Both values stand well above historical 


norms for the firm, thus deflating any future demand for OMCL’s current inventory levels. 


For example, just four years ago in Q1 2015, these metrics stood at only 29.4% and 11.0%, 


respectively, much lower values that indicate future demand may not be there. 





• Even when judging OMCL’s current inventory versus bookings (i.e. expected future sales), 


the company’s metrics still appear to be highly outsized relative to history. Illustrating this, 


we see that this ratio now stands at 14.1% at the end of 2018. While this amount is off the 


five-year high of 16.9% reached in the prior year, it is still well above historical values of 


8.8%, 11.9%, and 12.7% reached in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.  





• Based on our expertise, GHR believes that there are only two possible outcomes in this 


scenario: 1) Omnicell will attempt to maintain its price points on its products, resulting in 


decreased sales and future impairment risk of its inventory and/or 2) the company will need 


to discount its products significantly in order to move inventory and avoid warehousing & 


transporting costs. Our overall thesis based on these figures suggests that the launch of 


the XT series and other new product lines have not produced the sales expected by 


management when they obtained their current inventory levels. Furthermore, based on 


the significant inventory rise, OMCL management has yet to write these obsolete models 


off the balance sheet.  





• Further corroborating our thesis, we turn to the firm’s accounts payable-to-inventory ratio. 


As of 03/31/19, this ratio currently stands at its lowest value ever recorded, at 37.0%. This 


ratio has declined substantially over the past two years, as it is down from a recent high of 


65.4% reached in Q2 2017. This divulges to us that management has actually been
GlassHouse Research 


18 | P a g e  
 


decreasing its inventory purchases over the last five years. As management constantly 


touts building inventory for future sales, this metric tells us the opposite is occurring.  





• Exacerbating OMCL’s inventory problems, management also resorted to transferring some 


of its inventory into property, plant, and equipment, according to the 2018 10K.  This is the 


first instance GHR can find where management chose to transfer some of its inventory into 


PP&E (see below). While from an absolute standpoint, the balance is not highly significant 


at $2.03 million, it does reveal to us other avenues management is willing to go down to 


conceal inventory problems on the balance sheet. We will continue to monitor this account, 


as we expect management may continue to transfer inventory into PP&E at heightened 


levels in the future.  








• To quantify the impact that declining to impair these inventories has had on earnings, we 


can reverse engineer Omnicell’s inventory balance using the firm’s five-year DSI average of 


70 days. As a result, we estimate that OMCL should have written-off $23.3 million of their 


inventory in the latest year to match a historical balance for the firm. This impact would 


result in a $18.2 million after-tax loss over the TTM, or $0.44 of EPS.

Chart 4: Omnicell Accounts Payable-to-Inventory Ratio 











Failing to Write-Off Obsolete Inventory Will Be a Significant Headwind for Omnicell 
 


With Omnicell rolling out a collection of new product lines to its customers in recent years, our 


analysis has led us to believe that two outcomes are occurring: 1) OMCL’s new product lines 


have not been selling at the rate management initially thought they would and 2) OMCL’s 


legacy products have not been written-off to reach normalized levels. Judging from excerpts 


from prior earnings calls and OMCL’s current inventory levels, we believe both outcomes have 


concurrently taken place with Omnicell now facing an ominous future, as it will need to unwind 


the slow moving and/or obsolete inventory on its balance sheet.  





Furthermore, GHR will refute the point that due to OMCL currently being in an upgrade cycle, 


this would explain the recent rise in DSI balance. In fact, we would expect the opposite to be 


true. For example, the last time Omnicell reported a significant upgrade cycle was with the G4 


automated pharmacy in 2013 and 2014. Throughout this period, DSIs reported a tight range of 


only 55 to 59 days throughout those quarters. These values were well within historical and peer 


group standards in the midst of a major product line upgrade.   





Viewing data on Chart 3 on Page 16, we can see how DSIs have been growing in a stair-step 


fashion dating back to 2015. With the appointment of CFO Peter Kuipers within the same 


timeframe, we do not believe it is a coincidence that DSI levels have risen so sharply. As a

result, margins may have been artificially protected, as Mr. Lipps and Mr. Kuipers obstinately 


refused to write-off obsolete inventory.  





Our first acknowledgement by management that inventory metrics started to come out of line 


was in the Q2 2016 earnings call with CFO Kuipers stating: 


 
Inventories were $74 million, up around $2 million from last quarter, mostly for our built-in 


inventory for installs and deliveries in the third quarter. 





However, after this statement, we found that inventory metrics never normalized to historical 


values when the “future sales” occurred over the next year. While, yes, sales did increase over 


the next year (with the help of the Aesynt acquisition’s sales), we would have expected OMCL’s 


DSI values to normalize into the 50-to-60-day range. This did not occur. In fact, starting in Q1 


2017, management exclaimed in nine consecutive earnings calls that the recent inventory bloat 


was “primarily driven by an inventory build for future quarter installs.”  





Based on our analysis above, we believe this explanation is a road to nowhere and that 


heightened write-offs are inevitable. Estimated future sales and bookings estimates still show a 


very bloated inventory balance that will need to be written off unless a miracle causes sales to 


rise significantly above estimates. With our receivables’ analysis showing that management 


cannot even understand simple AR/sales journal entries, why should we believe them in this 


instance? Management has had 10 periods in order to get their inventory metrics under control 


and it just continues to spiral higher.  





In the Q4 2018 earnings call, management discloses the specific new product lines that have 


driven the inventory increase: 


 
Inventories at December 31, 2018, were approximately $100 million and relatively flat from 


the prior quarter and up 5% from last year, as we are ramping up production of the XT 


Series, XR2 and IVX Workflow 





According to the firm’s 2018 annual report, however, we find an excerpt relating to obsolete 


inventory that may be a harbinger of more unfavorable inventory trends to come: 


 
Medication Adherence. Cost of revenues increased by $10.1 million for the year 


ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase 


in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 


31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and $2.1 million of excess and 


obsolete reserve for slower moving inventory.
GlassHouse Research 


21 | P a g e  
 





Here, we believe the crux of our inventory thesis lies with legacy inventory gathering dust in 


warehouses of OMCL (G4 pharmacy, RobotRx, etc.). The continued drop off of accounts 


payable-to-inventory ratio suggests that a decline in inventory procurement has not mitigated 


any inauspicious DSI trends as it continues to rise.  On top of that, with management disclosing 


that it has started to write-off inventory, GHR believes it is only the tip of the iceberg until we 


see DSIs normalize into the 50-to-60-day range. Curiously, management does not disclose the 


firm’s excess obsolescence reserve in the firm’s annual report. Being in the highly 


transformative medical device industry, we find it bizarre that a company this size would not 


disclose any metrics regarding their obsolescence reserve.  





To conclude, let us leave the reader with a major statistic that details Mr. Kuipers’ tenure as 


CFO. During his tenure as CFO, Omnicell’s DSI metric has increased by 31 days (or 53.4%), 


from 58 days to 89 days. Given management’s somewhat broken record of “building for future 


sales,” we find it highly peculiar that no analysts want to ask the tough questions relating to the 


never-ending build of inventory on the balance sheet.   





Management’s aforementioned statements of “timing issues” and “building for future sales” 


speak to both a mismanagement of inventory levels and revenue that has been pulled forward 


to meet sales/earnings estimates. Again, while management may cosmetically enhance sales 


and earnings through these accounting gimmicks for a short period of time, these actions are 


not sustainable in the long-term and point to a decreased demand for their products. GHR 


believes that over the next year, most investors can expect a large drop off in revenues as the 


previous non-recurring revenue gains disappear.
GlassHouse Research 


22 | P a g e  
 


Capitalized Software Deviates Considerably from R&D Trends 


In addition to our revenue recognition and inventory concerns, we find that management 


pulled yet another accounting lever over the past two years to greatly increase operating 


margins. As stated above, we believe management was facing the pressure of three 


consecutive years of declining margins (2014-2017), and therefore chose to use accounting 


gimmicks to turn it around.  





Miraculously in 2018, both non-GAAP gross and operating margins increased by 210 and 370 


bps, respectively. While management was quick to boast about their non-GAAP operating 


margin being above 15% (a long-term goal for OMCL), we believe it was disingenuous of 


management to not explain the primary reasons for it on the same Q4 earnings call. However, 


buried in the firm’s 2018 10K, we see why the company reported decreased R&D costs: 





Research and Development 





Research and development expenses decreased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 


2018 as compared to year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in research 


and development expenses of $3.9 million in our Automation and Analytics segment, offset by 


an increase in research and development expenses of $0.7 million in our Medication Adherence 


segment and an increase of $2.0 million in corporate-related research and development 


expenses.  





The decrease in the Automation and Analytics segment was primarily attributed to 


several research and development projects reaching capitalization stage during the 


period ended December 31, 2018 as we are allocating additional resources to software 


projects, resulting in lower research and development expenses.  








While this excerpt may appear to be fairly innocuous in nature, we believe that the accelerated 


capitalization of software costs over the past two years provided a material boost to EPS. Again, 


these are nothing more than subjective calls by management (as to when a project reaches 


certain production stages) to reduce expenses at their discretion.  





This action is eerily similar to the accounting case study on the Winners Internet Network fraud 


in the early 2000s. Here the SEC accused the company of improper capitalization of software 


costs during a three-year timespan.5 Specifically, the SEC alleged that Winners improperly 


capitalized wages, payroll taxes, rent, travel, marketing, and consulting expenses that were

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18652.htm
GlassHouse Research

purportedly associated with the development of their software. Furthermore, the costs were 


incurred after a certain date where the software was available for general release to customers.  





In laymen’s terms, Winners’ management capitalized its costs on the balance sheet, therefore 


circumventing the income statement and making margins look better than they actually were. 


But this game cannot be played forever and will violently reverse when these capitalized 


expenses come off the balance sheet at a heightened rate.  





Without diving too much into the accounting minutiae, we will contextualize how OMCL 


management is able to use ASC 985-20 to its advantage to cosmetically enhance earnings. 


Under this pronouncement, management needs to make subjective calls in order to determine 


whether expenditures are to be classified as normal expenses (R&D costs) or capitalized 


expenses (capitalized software). The key aspect of this pronouncement is that management 


needs to make a call regarding whether internal generated software has reached “technological 


feasibility.” Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program 


design or, in absence, completion of a working model.  





So why do we at GHR believe that Omnicell is engaged in similar acts as Winners? Based on the 


highly anomalous figures disclosed by the company and research of the firm’s software product 


offerings, we believe their recent reported earnings figures are too good to be true.  
 


• Omnicell’s capitalized software balance (stored in “Other Long-term Assets” on the balance 


sheet) has skyrocketed over the past year. This is concurrent with R&D expenses stalling on 


the income statement for no apparent reason. In the last four periods, capitalized software 


(CS) has spiked by 30.1%, 41.9%, 47.2%, and 57.2% YOY, respectively. In contrast, R&D costs 


have reported YOY decreases in three of the last four periods (see Chart 5, Page 25).  





• The contrast is even more apparent when judging CS versus revenue trends. Prior to 2018, 


this ratio of CS-to-3M sales ranged between approximately 15% to 20%. However, in 2018, 


something changed drastically, causing the ratio spike to a recent high of 31.9% as of Q1 


2019, or 1,233 bps above the trailing five-year seasonal average of 19.6% (see Table 3, Page 


25).  





• Looking at longer-term trends for Omnicell, the company’s CS-to-12M sales ratio rose by 


250 bps YOY to 8.0% as of Q1 2019. This ratio also reached a new recent high and stood 260 


bps above the five-year average of only 5.4%.
GlassHouse Research 


24 | P a g e  
 


• To quantify this impact, if GHR uses the 5.5% prior year’s CS-to-12M sales ratio as a 


baseline, GHR calculates that a standard capitalized software balance should stand at $44.5 


million on the balance sheet. Therefore, ceteris paribus, OMCL would have reported $20.2 


million more in R&D expenses over the TTM. Flowing through to earnings, this translates a 


highly material 38-cent benefit to the bottom line for OMCL over the TTM. In other words, 


16% of non-GAAP EPS over the TTM was based on this unsustainable benefit alone. 





• Even if OMCL management had grounds to capitalize these significant amounts of expenses 


for valid reasons based on product life cycles, this 38-cent gain to EPS is highly transitory 


and will not reoccur in 2019. In fact, this prior one-time gain will now act as a material 


headwind as OMCL will have to make up this gain in future periods.  





• At worst, management needed to turn around margins after three dismal years of declines 


and turned to financial engineering in order to mislead investors/analysts. At best, however, 


even if the increase in these balance sheet accounts were 100% organic, the total increase 


in margins and EPS ($0.38, 16% of non-GAAP EPS), will not reoccur in 2019. Thus, the 


previous gains will now act as substantial headwinds for 2019 earnings.

Change in Expense Recognition Policy Drives 14.1% of TTM Earnings  
 


Continuing with the theme of heightened expense deferrals and capitalized expenses, GHR 


found another interesting balance sheet item swelling over the past year in “Prepaid 


Commissions.” With the full retrospective adoption of ASC 606 as of 01/01/18, we find that 


Omnicell reclassified prepaid commissions as a non-current asset and adjusted its amount by 


$25.8 million on that date. The company now carries two balances of prepaid expenses, one as 


a current asset and one as non-current prepaid commissions.  





Prior to the adoption, we can see below how OMCL classified both assets in the footnotes 


(2017 10K):  


 
In addition, the footnotes discussed its prepaid commissions in the following excerpt from the 


same filing:  


 
Commissions 


Sales commissions are incremental and directly related to customer sales contracts in which 


revenue is deferred. These commission costs are accrued and recorded in prepaid expenses 


upon execution of a non-cancelable customer contract and subsequently expensed in the period 


of revenue recognition. Commission expense was $19.4 million, $22.0 million and $13.7 million 


for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 


respectively. 





However, accompanying the adoption of ASC 606, Omnicell seems to have changed their 


commission expense recognition policy that appears to defer costs to future periods. OMCL
GlassHouse Research

provides the following excerpt below detailing their new expense recognition policy with 


respects to prepaid commissions (Q1 2018 10Q):  
 


Contract Costs 


The Company has determined that the incentive portions of its sales commission plans 
require capitalization since these payments are directly related to sales achieved during 
a time period. These commissions are earned on the basis of the total purchase order 
value of new product bookings. Since there are not commensurate commissions earned 
on renewal of the service bookings, the Company concluded that the capitalized asset is 
related to services provided under both the initial contract and renewal periods.  


The commission expenses paid as of the consolidated balance sheet date to be recognized in 
future periods are recorded in long-term prepaid commissions on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.  





As trained CPAs, we take issue with OMCL’s expense deferrals in this new policy and believe 


the previous policy is more in-line with GAAP, even when accounting for ASC 606 and the new 


five-factor performance obligation model. However, putting that issue aside, the end result 


will remain the same… heightened capitalized expenses on the balance sheet will unwind 


violently in future periods, crushing margins.  





• At the end of 2018, prepaid expenses and commissions (AKA “prepaids”) jumped by 


85.4% to $66.8 million as the firm changed their expenses recognition policy ($20.7 


million of prepaid expenses and $46.1 million in prepaid commissions). Relative to 3M 


and 12M sales, the increase pushed these ratios up to 31.6% and 8.5%, respectively, as 


of 12/31/18, both near their five-year high.  





• In Q1 2019, these ratios declined slightly, however still remained near their respective 


maximums at 30.0% and 7.5%. To put this in perspective, we see that the average 3M 


ratio only stood at 16.2% in the five years before this expense policy was changed.  





• We find similar results when the level of prepaids is measured against total operating 


expenses. For instance, OMCL’s prepaids balance stood at 26.8% relative to 3M OpEx in 


the Q1 period, which is almost double the value that was reported before the policy 


change. Again, analyzing longer-term patterns, prepaids standing at 6.8% of 12M OpEx 


also doubled their pre-policy value of only 3.5%.  





• To quantify the rise in prepaid expenses and commissions relative to earnings, we 


calculate that if Omnicell would have kept the prepaid-to-12M sales ratio constant at its 


five-year average of 5.3%, the company would have to reduce its EPS by $0.34 over the

28 | P a g e  
 


TTM. This EPS value also equates to 14.1% of TTM non-GAAP EPS. Thus, if Omnicell 


would have expensed commissions at the normalized rate of the past, over 14% of 


earnings would have vanished.  





• Again, we want to point out that regardless of whether the change in expense 


recognition policy has merit or not, the end result will be the same. Absent similar 


growth in revenues, margins will decline as these costs must ultimately be amortized 


against earnings in future periods.  





• Our final note on these capitalized expenses (both prepaid commissions and software 


costs) is that these expenses remain extremely subjective under management’s 


discretion to either expense or capitalize these balances. Based on numbers alone, 


these metrics appear to be highly anomalous and are not normally seen in most public 


companies to this extent. We find it to be very disingenuous that management did not 


divulge the benefit of these two items in any conference calls when discussing the 


recent turnaround in margins, when they obviously played such a large part.

Management Gets Rich Off Manipulated Earnings Numbers 


 
Both CEO Randall Lipps and CFO Peter Kuipers received generous compensation packages over 


the past two years as the firm’s stock price surged in value. Mr. Lipps’ total compensation grew 


by 25% and 24% (to $6.3 million) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The CFO, Peter Kuipers grew his 


compensation by an astonishing 72% and 57% (to $2.5 million) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 


The salaries of both these C-Suite executives stayed fairly constant while stock grants and non-


equity incentive plans drove most of the gains.   











Diving into the firm’s proxy reports we find that the “non-equity plan compensation” aspect for 


both these executives stem from performance targets relating to bookings and, you guessed it, 


“non-GAAP earnings.” For both Mr. Lipps and Mr. Kuipers, their respective non-equity 


compensation more than doubled in 2018 to the highest amount ever received by each executive 


($1.22 million for Mr. Lipps and $530,000 for Mr. Kuipers).

Below we disclose the excerpt regarding performance goals for 2018 listed in OMCL’s 2018 proxy:  








Specifically, looking at the quarterly profit targets, it was disclosed that OMCL management was 


able “to meet or exceed the applicable profit target set by the committee” in every period of 


2018. GHR is quick to point out that OMCL did not reach any of the quarterly or annual profit 


thresholds, even based on non-GAAP earnings figures. Although, we believe the Board excluded 


certain undisclosed expenses in order for management to reach their profit goals and ensuing a 


bonus for each period (OMCL reported non-GAAP earnings of $84.6 million versus the target of 


$98.9 million). 





Sustainable Earnings Vastly Differs from Manipulated Earnings 
 


On top of missing profit goals in 2018, but still receiving their full bonus, we believe earnings 


figures would have been in a much worse position (and that the Board would have declined to 


provide management with a bonus) if accounting gimmicks were not used to enhance earnings in 


2018.
GlassHouse Research 


31 | P a g e  
 





We at GHR believe the company’s sustainable economic earnings can be better estimated using 
the accounting adjustments made in the previous sections. Adjustments made for OMCL’s 
anomalous net receivables, inventory, capitalized software, and prepaid commissions need to be 
made in order to strip out any financial engineering gains. Thus, we believe management 
possessed high motivation to enhance earnings after depressed results reported by OMCL in prior 
years. 
 
Below are the adjustments made to come to our sustainable EPS figure:

OMCL Audit Committee Along with CFO Kuipers Have Limited Accounting Experience 
 


When diving into the backgrounds of OMCL’s audit committee, comprised of James Judson (64), 


Joanne Bauer (63), and Gary Petersmeyer (72), we are shocked to find out that no one within this 


group has received any type of accounting training throughout their college or work history. We 


would expect the Audit Chairman, James Judson, to possess some accounting training, however 


we find that he only served in a few CFO roles for very short timeframes. His background stems 


from a BS in industrial management from Purdue and an MBA from Indiana University. Although 


the Omnicell Corporate Governance Committee believes differently stating:  


 
The Corporate Governance Committee believes that Mr. Judson's financial and operational 


expertise in executive level financial positions at a rapidly growing, global, publicly-traded 


company provides the Board with valuable insights into the financial operations of the 


Company and financial matters generally. The Corporate Governance Committee believes 


that Mr. Judson's knowledge of the Company and its accounting practices as Omnicell's 


former Interim Chief Financial Officer is especially valuable as Chairman of the Audit 


Committee.  


TTM Ended: Q1 2019 


Stated non-GAAP EPS $2.40 


  Net Receivables Adjustment -0.72 


  Inventory Adjustment -0.44 


  Capitalized Software Adjustment  -0.38 


  Prepaid Commissions Adjustment -0.34 


Sustainable EPS   $0.51
GlassHouse Research

While we would always hope for the audit committee chairperson to come from public 


accounting as a CPA due to the complexity and dynamic environment that is GAAP accounting, 


even an accounting degree would somewhat suffice in this position.  





Ms. Bauer’s and Mr. Petersmeyer’s backgrounds are also not up to par to effectively serve on this 


important committee at Omnicell. Specifically, Ms. Bauer appears to have come from a Marketing 


and Management background with no listed accounting experience. Also, Mr. Petersmeyer 


received his BA in Political Science and a MAT (for teaching) and MBA from Harvard– again, no 


relevant accounting experience.  





We find it peculiar that OMCL failed to choose one CPA with any accounting experience for its 


Audit Committee and selected a CFO with limited accounting experience. While the Board may 


believe that these members and Mr. Kuipers are performing well with the recent uptick in 


earnings, we beg to differ. We find a company that has manipulated earnings by 79% over the last 


year, on top of a CFO that has incorrectly disclosed or maybe misled how the firm’s receivables 


balance has spiked in recent years. We believe a more seasoned Auditing Committee with 


relation to accounting experience would have asked OMCL management the tough questions 


over the past year, such as: 





1) Why have the total DSO balance crossed above the 100-day mark to 109 days without any 


end in sight for the continued rises? You disclosed that you expected DSOs to have a 


target of 65-to-75-days, what has changed? 





2) If revenue is being deferred into future quarters as you say in the Q3 2018 earnings call, 


how can receivables & DSOs be spiking upwards from an accounting standpoint? A 


receivable increasing suggests that revenue has been recognized at that time, which 


conflicts with your statement. 





3) You first brought up inventory being built for future sales back in Q2 2016, why haven’t 


DSI levels normalized since that timeframe? With the recent uptick in inventory 


obsolescence write-downs, what is the materiality of writing off more obsolete inventory 


in future periods? 





4) Why have capitalized expenses spiked on the balance sheet concurrent with declines in 


R&D expenses?  





5) Why did you change the expense recognition policy regarding commissions? With prepaid 


commissions rising drastically because of it, how will this impact margins going forward?

Red Flags Are Set to Violently Reverse for Omnicell in 2019 


 
The bull case regarding Omnicell’s stock price revolves around the following tenants that we 
believe the sell-side community has misunderstood:  
 


1) Analysts believe that recent gross and operating margin increases are sustainable and will 
be able to maintain the long-term targets of 50% and 15%, respectively.  


2) Analysts believe the recent uptick in sales growth is fully attributable to the success of XT 
pharmacy and that the new product lines XR2 and IVX solutions will provide future 
increases of bookings/sales.  


3) Analysts believe that a stated organic growth target of 8% to 12% annually is attainable 
for the long-term.  


 
Regarding the above items, we have gone step-by-step to debunk many of these flawed 
reasonings for investors and analysts. Based on our analysis, we believe that much of the recent 
sales growth was attributable to prematurely recognizing revenue. With respects to expanded 
margins, we believe this was achieved by consciously deciding not to write-off what we believe to 
be legacy and impaired inventories on the balance sheet. 
 
Furthermore, we believe that margins were greatly enhanced by the heightened capitalization of 
normal expenses in recent periods. This is apparent from the recent surges in both the company’s 
“capitalized software” and “prepaids commission” balances. Basically, the only way that Omnicell 
has been able to keep non-GAAP operating margins near their stated goal of 15% is through Mr. 
Lipps’ and Mr. Kuipers orchestrated accounting games with inventories, receivables, capitalized 
software, and their prepaid expenses. As such, we believe Omnicell’s stock price will decline 
precipitously over the next twelve months as these accounting gimmicks reverse. Furthermore, we 
highly doubt that the sell-side community fully comprehends the magnitude of accounting 
headwinds that OMCL will face over the next year.  
 
For our valuation, we decided to use a hybrid approach using all EV-to-sales, EV-to-EBITDA and 
FWD P/E metrics to arrive at our fair value. When analyzing the firm’s sustainable values, we made 
adjustments to revenue, EBITDA and earnings figures that have been detailed throughout this 
report. Furthermore, we applied peer group multiples among all the valuation metrics to arrive at 
our calculated stock price.6 We then used an amalgamation of all these three figures to arrive at 
our estimated fair value for Omnicell. Basing our valuation on adjusted TTM sales of $769.0 
million, adjusted TTM EBITDA of $57.7 million, and our sustainable EPS value of $0.51, we believe a
