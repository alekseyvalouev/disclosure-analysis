WHY CITRON BELIEVES
THIS DEER HAS A TARGET
ON ITS HEAD


Every day someone asks Citron, “So which Chinese
RTO is the next to go?”  As we properly called China
Media Express, and have publically stated and
stand by our opinion that China Biotics is a
complete fraud, we can’t help but add that Deer
Consumer Products (NASDAQ:DEER) might become
the next casualty of the Chinese RTO markets.  The
similarities between CCME and DEER will be
explained in this editorial piece.


Just like CCME — Growth too good to
be true
DEER’s business is the manufacture and wholesale
distribution of small electric kitchen appliances for
household use.   This business is highly competitive
worldwide, and especially  in China, where there are
literally dozens of manufacturers of products such
as juicers, blenders and rice cookers.   The company
sells both to domestic markets, and private labeled
products for export.   Deer is just another one of
the smaller players in the Chinese low end kitchen
appliance market.


Yet, DEER’s �nancial results would have us believe
that the company’s domestic business has grown
over 400% year over year, with increasing gross

margins, accomplished with minimal to no
expenditure on advertising, and no evidence of
expenditure on representatives at the retail level
to support sales.


Deer reports operating margins 46% higher than
its strongest competitor, which is over 8x DEER’s
size (Joyoung).  Nonetheless, a recent article in
Chinese business news shows the di�culty in
turning pro�ts in the China small appliance market.

02/01165232303.shtml]


So just like CCME, we see a company with
stratospheric growth, reporting a return on equity
that is not consistent with other publicly traded
companies in its space.  Furthermore, we see
margins that are not consistent with the rest of the
industry.


Must Give a “Little” Respect
Citron �rst read about DEER Consumer Products
after reading the work of blogger Alfred Little.  We
have to give credit where credit is due, as Little has
done a de�nitive piece of work on this company.

problems-with-deer-consumer-products
[http://seekingalpha.com/article/258731-the-
problems-with-deer-consumer-products]


In response, the company attempted to distract
investors from the business operations and instead
focused on a questionable land purchase that was
researched by Little.  Citron does not even want to
address this issue.  We also will not address the
hidden subsidiary / related party allegations by
Little.  Land purchase or not, we believe the
company is not being honest about their underlying
business.


Common Sense, People … Chilling
Similarities to CCME

For those of you who remember Citron’s initial
report on CCME, an initial red �ag was the lack of
internet presence for a company that was
supposedly doing gangbuster business.  We see the
same thing with DEER.  Alfred Little did a series of
channel checks that you can believe or not believe
(we tend to believe), but here is something that
cannot be denied.  Here’s a channel check anyone
can do without visiting dozens of department
stores in China:  A simple check on the website
Taobao, the consumer part of Alibaba, lists the
rankings of small kitchen appliance makers in
China.

cat=TR_CFJD&level3=&show=brand&up=false&ad_id=&am_


If you notice…Deer is ranked #51 in their “Attention
Index”.  By comparison, BBK, the company that
exited the business because of low margins and
competition in the aforementioned article, ranked
#17.  To take it a step further, we can observe the
number of transactions on DEER products.


If you go to this page, you will see that Taobao
actually lists the amount of products sold in a
recent period.  http://s.taobao.com/search?

For Deer, the top selling item only sold 9 and most
items have sold 0.  Does that sound like a company
who is growing domestic sales by over 400% year
over year?  Compare this to Joyoung, who has sold
thousands of their items per week.

Yet, as mentioned above we are to believe that
DEER has an operating margin that is 46% greater
than Joyoung.

Does this make any common sense?


As a funny aside, we encourage you to listen to this
video of Ben Wey where he refers to DEER as the
“world largest manufacture of juicers and blenders”
  (1:09).

The Writing Is On the Wall!
In a time where every day there seems to be
another Chinese RTO stock that is imploding, the
SEC has �nally taken notice and established a task
force to �ght fraud.


http://www.businessinsider.com/sec-in-massive-
probe-of-chinese-reverse-mergers-that-have-cost-
investors-billions-2010-12
[http://www.businessinsider.com/sec-in-massive-
probe-of-chinese-reverse-mergers-that-have-cost-
investors-billions-2010-12]


The SEC is looking for, “Individuals with direct
knowledge of the investigation say the SEC is
focusing on stock promoters, investment bankers,
auditors and law �rms that have been active in
recruiting Chinese companies to U.S. stock
exchanges and raising capital for those companies
by selling new shares”


Unlike any other of the recent RTO implosions,
DEER actually gives us a group of people who work
together as an actual “network”.


It is no secret that Benjamin Wey from New York
Global Group is the “mastermind” behind this
whole operation.  So it appears to Citron that Wey
stacked the deck by putting in his auditor and his
Audit Committee Chairman.


Auditor Goldman Kurland & Mohidin, LLP (GKM)
and Audit Committee Chairman Arnold Stalo� serve
several of the same New York Global clients.  GKM
audits include Bodisen Biotech (BBCZ, -95% from its

high), Agfeed Industries (FEED, -90%), Smartheat
(HEAT, -78%) and most recently Cleantech (CTEK.PK,
already -52% from its high and delisted from
NASDAQ on March 1, 2011 for a serious disclosure
violation related to a December �nancing).


Arnold Stalo�, DEER’s audit committee chairman, is
also the audit committee chairman of FEED, HEAT,
and CTEK.


And speaking of audits and the committee that is
supposed to oversee them, …. what does a small
audit shop in Encino, California know about
auditing a kitchen appliance manufacturer in China?


In a world where legitimate Chinese RTO’s are the
outliers, what is to make us think that DEER will not
face the same destiny as Bosiden and Cleantech: 
DELISTED.


Flashbacks of CCME?
One of the telltale signs of China Media Express
doing something “funky” is when the CFO bought $1
million worth of stock, the same day it was “sold” by
an insider.  We still do not know whether this
transaction took place or was it something that just
looked good on paper.  Similarly, it was always odd
that management was selling their stock at a
signi�cant discount to market, when their business
seemingly looked strong.  Citron labels these as
“questionable transactions.”  Just like CCME, here is
a list of questionable transactions in DEER stock
that we believe will eventually be a trail of bread
crumbs for regulators.   The following is a list of
transactions that do not pass the smell test:


1.       We are supposed to believe the Ben Wey’s
sister, Tianyi Wei bought 2.2 million shares (over 6%
of the company) in the open market and this
transaction has nothing to do with Ben Wey.  It is
the belief of Citron that this transaction was not as
it appeared to be and the truth will come out
eventually (maybe in a CNBC episode of American
Greed?)


2.      The transactions of Chairman He Ying are
troublesome and just not believable.  We are
5/18/2018 Why Citron Believes This DEER Has a Target on its Head – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/why-citron-believes-this-deer-has-a-target-on-its-head/ 6/7


supposed to believe that even though he owns 8
million shares of DEER, he actually purchased 
250,000 shares in the open market, right after
Little’s article was published?  That transaction is as
nonsensical as the 2010 transaction, when he
bought over $10 million of stock on the same day
that another o�cer sold $10 million worth of stock.


Citron believes that there are shady dealings in the
stock of DEER which has been evidenced by the
trading activity of the stock as well as the insider
transactions.  Citron’s opinion is that each of these
transactions has an untold story, one which
involves papered transactions, and “support” of the
open-market stock price of DEER – which amounts
to market manipulation.


Threats to Sue Shortsellers
Just a month before its stock was halted, China
MediaExpress stated its board has authorized
engagement of “outside counsel and other
consultants” for advise on countermeasures against
the two reports.  (Citron and Muddy Waters)  
http://news.ichinastock.com/a/1297091345896.html
[http://news.ichinastock.com/a/1297091345896.html]
. 
“THE COMPANY CATEGORICALLY DENIES THE
ALLEGATIONS MADE IN THESE PUBLICATIONS.”


Similarly, DEER seems to be preoccupied with its
threat to “shoot the messenger” – without even a
detailed response to the numerous highly detailed
concerns raised by published research, as they
have already �led suit against Al Little.  Well, DEER, I
am a citizen of the United States, and if you choose
to sue me, I welcome the opportunity to see you in
court and defend my position.


Conclusion


Sue Me….I KNOW I AM RIGHT.
