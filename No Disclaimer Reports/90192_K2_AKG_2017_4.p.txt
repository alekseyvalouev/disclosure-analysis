Asanko’s Nkran Pit Is About To Close Up


This is what’s left at Nkran as of October 25, 2017
(Remaining pit bottom outlined in BLUE):


• In Short: This is Asanko’s primary ore source, it’s
where the ‘pay dirt’ has been coming from


• By our estimates, there’s only ~1 month of mining left
from here


This is what we perceive to be Asanko’s attempted
pushback to re-open the pit (shaded in BLUE):


• In Short: This is what they need to mine down to get
back to the good stuff…


• It’s taken them ~6 months to get it down to here from
surface, and they have a long way left to go yet


It appears that Asanko is going to lose the Nkran Pit for
some time

The Bottom of Nkran Is Shrinking by ~10,000m2 Per Month Leaving ~1 Month Remaining 


May 18, 2017 Jul 18, 2017 Oct 25, 2017


71,000m2 49,000m2 19,000m2


• In the previous 5 ¼ months, mining has reduced the mineable surface area at the bottom of Nkran by ~52,000m2


• Nkran is shrinking by approximately 10,000m2 per month, and there’s only 19,000m2 of surface area remaining


• The pit cannot be mined down to 0m2 (We estimate the pit can be mined to a minimum surface area of +/- 7,000m2), therefore we
estimate there is only 1 month of mining remaining at Nkran’s pit bottom at current mining rates

Asanko Has Been Mining The Pushback For 6 Months And Only Made A Minor Dent


~170m From

~55m Progress

~63m Progress

This appears to be Asanko’s current pushback progress:
(outlined and shaded in BLUE)


• They started mining the pushback ~6 months ago (April 2017)


• So far, it appears they have made it less than 1/3 of the way to the
current pit bottom


• In our view, with the pit base nearly mined out, we expect Nkran to
close at the bottom before Asanko can reach a major ore zone in their
pushback


• In the interim, we expect Asanko to lose Nkran as the primary ore
source and to begin processing low-grade stockpiles to fill the
balance

Why is Asanko Attempting What Looks To Be An Overly Skinny Pushback?

Asanko’s Pushback appears to only be ~30,000m2 in surface
area:


• We find it unusual that Asanko is proceeding with what
appears to be such a narrow pushback:


• Nkran has been losing ~10,000m2 per month;
• It has lost well over 50,000m2 from the bottom of the


pit in the past 6 months;
• In the same 6 months while the pit has closed in,


Nkran’s pushback has only made it down a fraction of
the pit’s total depth;


• And we perceive the majority of its accessible ore to be
contained within its lower benches


• What will a pushback of ~30,000m2 really accomplish, and
how does that fit into a sustainable mine plan unless Asanko
expects the pit to suddenly become much more productive
than it has been per vertical meter of mining?


Which brings us to Asanko’s Reserve Model

Something Is Odd About The Ounces Per Vertical Meter In Asanko’s New Nkran Model

Something’s Odd About Asanko’s New Nkran Reserve Model…


From Asanko’s Jun 5, 2017 DFS Presentation:


Cut 1 is the current pit bottom that is nearly mined out


Cut 2 is the first pushback

Something’s Odd About Asanko’s New Nkran Reserve Model…


~93m 
vertical


~36m 
vertical


Asanko’s reserve model appears to imply that the concentration
of ounces per vertical meter will spike dramatically once they
get beneath their current pit cut - We are highly skeptical:


• This is Cut 1:
• It’s the current pit bottom that we expect Asanko to


finish mining out in the next month
• It is expected to yield ~225koz* of mined gold upon


completion
• At ~93m of vertical drop, that implies an average of


only ~2,400oz/vertical meter


• This is Cut 2:
• It’s the cut that the current pushback appears to be


working on


• It appears to afford Asanko only ~36m in additional
vertical drop from Cut 1, 40% of Cut 1’s total descent


• Asanko has disclosed that this cut contains 5.2Mt of
ore which, when applying Nkran’s reserve grade of
1.91g/t, suggests it is expected to yield ~319koz


• That implies an average of ~8,900oz/vertical meter


If Cut 2 involves mining down ~60% less meters than Cut 1, how is it
expected to suddenly yield ~42% more mined ounces than Cut 1?


These numbers are rough, but the scale of the discrepancy suggests
Asanko’s model likely estimates a large increase in average ounces per
vertical meter beneath Cut 1


*Q1 mined gold of 59,000 + 166,000 remaining in Cut 1 as of Q1 end (Mgmt guidance)

History Rhymes


• When we published our initial report on June 28, 2016, we were critical of Nkran’s Reserve Estimate


• Specifically, we noted that their Feasibility Study and Reserves depended on an apparent belief
that the orebody would suddenly become dramatically more productive than the previous miner
had found it to be as soon as they got beneath their historic pit


• Put Simply: Nkran’s Reserves, mine plan, and economic viability appeared dependent on a belief
that the future of the orebody would suddenly become significantly more productive per vertical
meter than its past


• It’s been well over a year since we published our initial thesis on Jun 28, 2016, and Asanko has a new
block model, a new Feasibility Study


• And yet once again, we perceive evidence of a Reserve Model, a Mine Plan, and Economic Viability
of their flagship asset dependent on an expectation that the future of Nkran’s orebody (Cut 2 and
beyond) will suddenly become significantly more productive per vertical meter than its
present/past (Cut 1).


• We aren’t surprised to see the rate of gold per vertical meter that Asanko has been achieving in
Cut 1. It is inline with our initial expectation for the asset back in 2016. Cut 2 and beyond are
not… and our expectations for Nkran’s orebody have not changed.
