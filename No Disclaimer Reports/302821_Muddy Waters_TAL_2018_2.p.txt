Peiyou offline enrollments appear 
to be declining YoY

Peiyou Q3 2018 Disclosures


• Total enrollment YoY +91.7%
• Total revenue YoY +62.4%
• Online ASPs ~40% lower than offline in quarter
• Offline ASPs experienced YoY “high single digit” 


growth


We use a common-size model to show how this data 
implies YoY offline enrollment decreases

1. Common Size the Data


Enrollment 100.0
ASP 100.0


Revenue (Enrollment x ASP) 10,000.0


Enrollment 191.7
ASP "high single digit" growth


Revenue (Enrollment x ASP) 16,240.0


FY2017 Q3
Total Peiyou (All of Which Was Offline in FY2017 Q3)


FY2018 Q3
Total Peiyou (All of Which Was Offline in FY2017 Q3)

2. This Gives Us Two Equations


e_off + e_on = 191.7
e_off * (100 + g_offASP) + e_on * ((100 + g_offASP) * .6) = 16,240


e_off  = Peiyou offline enrollment
e_on  = Peiyou online enrollment
g_offASP = Peiyou offline growth rate percentage


5
3. Insert a “High Single Digit” Offline 
ASP Growth Rate and Solve for e_off
• If g_offASP = 6.0%, then offline enrollment declined 4.5%


• If g_offASP = 7.5%, then offline enrollment declined 9.9%


• If g_offASP = 9.0%, then offline enrollment declined 15.1%

Why Didn’t TAL Disclose Online / 
Offline ASP Ratio on the Q4 Call?
• We think it’s because our analyst sent a similar 


version of this model to TAL IR for comment prior to 
the Q4 call 


• We never received a response
• Until that time, our and analyst and IR had been 


actively dialoguing

Our next report will detail why we 
believe TAL has fabricated Peiyou
results
