AMA Editorial and New Lawsuit a Must Read for Investors…and Patients. 
 
Citron reaffirms its $300 price target on Intuitive Surgical  
 


Journal of the AMA study plus a devastating new lawsuit expose the dark secrets 
behind the dramatic rise in robotic surgeries….and foretell its end. 
 
This is not a story of shorts vs Intuitive Surgical , this is a story of the American Medical 
Association, the Affordable Health Care Act, and tort law vs Intuitive Surgical. 
 
The headline news surrounding Intuitive Surgical yesterday was the publication of a study by the Journal of the 
American Medical Association funded by the National Cancer Institute, proving surgeries summarizing data that 
gynecological surgeries with the Intuitive Surgical robot cost thousands of dollars more, without reducing 
complications compared to standard less-invasive (laparoscopic) surgery.

Citron calls to readers' attention not only the study, but  the significance of the editorial written about the 
study that was also published in Journal of the AMA.  It is the editorial that explains the future contraction of 
earnings for Intuitive.

Here are some pivotal excerpts of the editorial:  
 





Such consumer-directed advertising is not without merit if it uses 
consumer awareness to advance underused medical discoveries 
that benefit the popula tion. However, when the innovation being 
advertised is of questionable advantage, direct-to-consumer 
promotion may only fuel unnecessary utilization.  Consumer adver- 
tising of expensive devices should be subjected to the same 
scrutiny as that of new and expensive medications.

Jason Wright, a gynecologic oncologist at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, conducted 
the study that was published.  Dr. Wright stated in the above article: 
 


Inefficiency in health care delivery can trace some of its roots to 


the use of new and expensive interventions for conditions where 


other effective treatment options already exist. Evidence-based 


medicine and comparative effectiveness research (CER) can help 


ensure the optimal treatment for a given class of patients by 


reducing the influence of non- clinical factors 


The United States is embarking on an unprecedented era in 


support of evidence- based medicine. The Patient-Centered 


Outcomes Research Institute was created under health care 


reform to move the field forward and will have significant 


resources.  


n. 





 The results of this study could inform the development of medical 


payment policy, that is, the set of decisions made by public and 


private payers about whether to cover a procedure or service or, if 


covered, how to manage its utilization. 





In the absence of additional research or decreases in price, the path 
taken by the medical and payer community should be one of 
caution. At a minimum, manufacturers might begin by voluntarily 
restricting their promotional activities. Public health entities could 
consider exercising greater oversight over claims that appear on 
websites.

This million-dollar question is answered in pleadings filed just two weeks ago in the 
state of Washington that completely blows the cover off of Intuitive Surgical.  
 


YOU MUST READ THIS CASE:  
Intuitive Surgical:  COMPLETELY EXPOSED 
 
While there are many injury lawsuits currently in the courts against the company, attorney Richard Friedman 
from Seattle Washington has meticulously documented the history of marketing tactics used by Intuitive, which 
provide the most complete answer to date to Dr. Wrights $20 billion question.   Atty. Friedman represents the 
estate of Joelle Taylor, the widow of Fred Taylor, who went to Harrison Hospital to get a routine prostatectomy, 
which caused his death. 
 
This comprehensive body of information has just appeared in the public domain because attorney Friedman did 
not want the court to absorb the information in “piecemeal fashion”.   So for the first time, the investing public 
as well as the medical community, can see, with the benefit of discovery and depositions, how Intuitive positions 
its robotic surgery to hospitals and doctors, and how it trains surgeons to use its products.   It is Citron's opinion 
that the company's overly aggressive sales strategy is going to lead to devastating backlash.  
 


Citron believes that every investor, patient, and most importantly hospital must read this case, 
which lays bare exactly how Intuitive Surgical has manipulated the healthcare system in the United 
States to generate profits for a procedure that has been deemed to have “no medical benefit to 
alternatives”.   
 
As expressed in our earlier reports, one of Citron's main contentions about Intuitive Surgical was the inadequate 
training of physicians:  how in the hands of the wrong surgeon the da Vinci machine transforms from a surgical 
tool to a dangerous weapon.   Intuitive has always tried to distance itself from training; we now read how it 
committed to the FDA that it would be responsible for training doctors, but that Intuitive has systematically 
acted to circumvent that requirement.  All of this will quickly become a major barrier to finding new 
adopters/customers for its robotic surgery machines. 
 
What we now read is that Intuitive has known all along of the dangers of the da Vinci.  Nonetheless, it and has 
financially incentivized its sales force to ignore those dangers at the cost of patients to “shove” the procedures 
down the throats of its customer base.  While Citron recommends that every Intuitive investor read this entire 
case (a carefully footnoted 95 pages) , here are just a few important excerpts:  


 
[ Link to Entire Court Filing ]  


 “The major concern is that the robotic procedure really didn’t show 


a lower complication rate yet it was substantially more expensive,” 


Wright said. Why the robot took off so fast “is the million dollar 


question.”

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
Damon  Daniels, the lSI sales rep who gave Dr. Bildsten the "Clinical Pathway", admitted that he would 
tell the surgeons, and wanted those  surgeons to believe,  that  the  Clinical  Pathway  would  ensure  the  
surgeon's success in becoming a proficient robotic surgeon. 
_______________________________________________________________________________ 
lSI assumed a duty beyond those imposed by statute upon manufacturers:  it  assumed a duty to train 
with reasonable care.  lSI's  disclaimers to the contrary do nothing more than create a genuine factual 
dispute as to the assumption of the duty and its scope. 
 
The declaration of William Scott Helton, M.D. states that the lSI training program applied to Dr. Bildsten  
"incomplete and potentially unsafe ...  Further, to suggest that any surgeon could be 
adequately trained to perform any type of major surgery using the da Vinci surgical 
system after only the level of training proposed is unfounded and unsupported by any data,  a leap of 
faith, potentially unsafe, and irresponsible.'" 
_______________________________________________________________________________ 
A jury could reasonably conclude that the mistakes he made in this robotic procedure were a result of 
the poor training and lack of warnings he received from lSI.  Indeed, that is the conclusion Dr. Bildsten 
has reached: 
 
I was not told by lSI that, especially for surgeons with no prior laparoscopic experience doing 
prostatectomies, this was very unlikely until I accomplished 100 or more robotic surgeries. Had I been 
informed of that fact, I would not have performed da Vinci surgery on Fred Taylor. 
_______________________________________________________________________________ 
ISI'si founder,  Dr.  Fred  Moll,  personally presented information to the Panel, which asked numerous 
questions about the learning curve  and training plan for surgeons who would use the robot.  Dr. Moll 
assured the Panel that lSI had specific, concrete plans for training on the device: 
 
"I am probably not the right person to do that, but it is at the top of our mind and we will have very 
clear plans for introducing a training protocol together with the sale of this device


.[48]
 


 
Dr. Moll later added that lSI took training "very seriously," and even regarded training as "one of the 
keys to both clinical and commercial success.’49


 
' The Panel advised that the robot was "approvable with 


conditions. 
50


   One of the conditions was training: "The sponsor needs to provide a comprehensive 
training program for the users .of this device."


51
  





________________________________________________________________________________ 
As explained   by  Suzanne  Parisian,  M.D.  -  a former  FDA Medical   Officer  and instructor at the 
FDA's  "staff college"  -  lSI was required to provide  no less than the rigorous  training  program 
described  in its submissions.  
 
In fact, Parisian explained,  the only way  a product  like da Vinci  could have  been  cleared  via 
Premarket Notification was with a commitment   for "adequate physician training". 


177
 


________________________________________________________________________________ 
In November 2000, only four months after receiving its first surgical clearance, lSI hired Gene Nagel to 
take over (among other things) its surgeon training program.  Nagel was not a  physician or an educator.  
His college degree was  in marketing  and operations management. 


195
  After college, he had spent 


thirteen years as a salesman, first on behalf of two wineries, and then at a medical device company.
196


   
He then spent two years as a manager at the device company, "teaching the salespeople how to sell.  


197
Citron Research on Intuitive Surgicql  Feb 21, 2013 Page 5of 7 
 


When he joined lSI in 2000, he had never had any higher education in the fields of education 
198 


or 
"medical related subjects.  


199
 


________________________________________________________________________________ 
With respect to Phase One, lSI  did not,  under Nagel, provide a 70-question exam followed by specific 
"feedback" and remediation from an "instructor."  Rather, the entirety of Phase One [training] … was 
simply a video that was less than one hour long and a ten question quiz.


208
 Moreover, this quiz was 


impossible to fail because, when a trainee selected an incorrect answer, the online program would 
simply prompt the trainee to choose a different answer.


209
 When the trainee finally selected the correct 


answer, only that correct answer would be recorded in the test taker's  final score.
210


 For this reason, 
every test-taker receives a perfect score at the end of the exam.


211
    


 
Notably,  no urologist has ever failed lSI's  "certification" course.


236
   Nor is there any indication  that  any  


other surgeon has failed any  of the other  phases  of  lSI's  training program. 
237


 
________________________________________________________________________________ 
[ Editor's note  CSR/ CSM are ISI sales staff:  Clinical Sales Representatives / Managers]  
 
These CSMs even required the CSRs to read new sales books each quarter.


286 
The book for the fiscal 


quarter in which Fred Taylor's surgery occurred was called "Hardball Selling" 
287


 
________________________________________________________________________________ 
Importantly,  other than the training they received at lSI, these CSRs had no medical or  educational 
training.  Damon Daniels, the CSR who worked with Dr. Bildsten, for example, had a 1995 business 
degree.


294
   Nor has any other member of lSI's sales force yet deposed in this case had any prior medical 


or educational training.
295


 Nonetheless, lSI expected these CSRs to be able to successfully challenge 
reluctant surgeons to convert previously scheduled open surgeries into robotic surgeries.


296
 As one lSI 


Clinical Sales Director put it to a group of CSRs over whom he had direct authority: 
 
We've all invested a lot of energy into developing our Equal Clinical Stature skill sets. It is now a matter 
of putting all of that practice to action. Be proactive in finding cases to convert. Be prepared to challenge 
each trained surgeon every time you see a lap or open case. Be unsatisfied with the thought of ending a 
day without a converted case.


297
 


 
"Converting," in this context, means finding a scheduled operation that a surgeon has decided 
to do without a robot, and convincing him against his initial judgment, to operate with the da 
Vinci. 
 
Instead, lSI actually minimized the danger that new robotic surgeons posed to patients 
by teaching its CSRs to pressure hospitals to adopt only minimal credentialing and privileging 
requirements.   
________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 (2) outright  telling the hospitals that  their  proposed   credentialing requirements were too high, even 
if that proposed requirement was as low as five proctored surgeries.


306
'" 


________________________________________________________________________________ 
"Behind every successful robotic surgery program is not only  a great deal of effort, but also a strong 
partnership with Intuitive Surgical....     With this in mind, we would like to be closely involved in the 
development and execution of your program. 


347
 


…  the CSRs would "never" tell the surgeons   that the CSRs had a financial incentive to make sure that 
the surgeons actually performed procedures on humans with  the robot.


348
  Likewise, the CSRs would
Citron Research on Intuitive Surgicql  Feb 21, 2013 Page 6of 7 
 


not tell the hospital steering committees that the CSRs "would be compensated based on the number of 
procedures done with the robot.,,


349
     Rather, lSI's  sales force learn to portray itself as entirely 


altruistic:   "Everything we do is for the benefit of the patient.,
350


 
________________________________________________________________________________ 
… … 
After the first meeting, O'Connor privately "expressed  some doubt about the potential quality" of 
Harrison's  robotics program to Carson. 


382
    Carson reminded O'Connor  "not to communicate any bias 


against Harrison" because "Hospitals like Harrison are our future. 
383


 
He warned  O'Connor  that his concerns  "shouldn't   extend beyond  you and me.  


384
 


________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
The toolkit included numerous marketing resources that would allow lSI to help the hospital market da 
Vinci surgery to nearby patients.


399 
  Included in these resources were lSI brochures designed to tell 


potential patients: "Your doctor is one of the growing number of surgeons worldwide who's been 
successfully  trained in providing leading-edge treatments such as da Vinci Prostatectomy ,


400
 


________________________________________________________________________________ 
A traditional open prostatectomy in the hands of an experienced surgeon would take 2.5 hours.


416
 ISI 


trained its sales persons to tell surgeons who were reluctant to adopt da Vinci that "most da Vinci  
surgeons today perform quality radical prostatectomy procedures in less than two hours." Dr. 
Bildsten's  first two robotic procedures took 9.5 and 7.5 hours respectively,


417
despite the fact 


that both patients were relatively easy patients." 
418


 
… … 
lSI  had trained Damon Daniels to believe that Bildsten had learned "all  necessary skills" to perform da 
Vinci Prostatectomy.  It had trained and authorized Daniels to "partner" with surgical teams ''to review 
and select appropriate cases."   It had financially incentivized Daniels to try to convince surgeons to 
perform every prostatectomy with the robot.   
________________________________________________________________________________ 


 
Intuitive Surgical is going to defend itself on Wall Street, in the popular press, and the courts by claiming that 
robotic surgery complication rates are low, and comparable to manual laparoscope.  Citron disagrees that this is 
a valid defense.   Nobody is going to be suing laparoscope makers for encouraging surgeons to perform surgeries 
with inadequate training, and for unleashing a massive marketing campaign targeted at consumers to drive 
demand for this type of surgery, despite data showing that for its two main high-volume surgical procedures, 
outcomes are not better than alternatives, yet costs are higher.   
 
This problem is serious, systemic, and going to have massive repercussions in the health care and 
reimbursement system in the years ahead.

   Conclusion 
Our one regret is that Citron Research is the primary journalistic outlet that has exposed this story.  This story is 
beyond important and is a complete object lesson in how profits can displace best practices in health care.  This 
story is begging for a 60 Minutes-type expose to bring it to the awareness of the public and the medical 
community.   The bull case on the stock rests on the words of Dr. Mario Leitao a consultant for Intuitive, who 
stated to Bloomberg, “the study results won’t change how often he uses the device.   It is like asking a jet fighter 
pilot to go back to a World War II airplane because it is cheaper.” 
 
EXACTLY!  How long does it take to become a jet fighter pilot and what happens to an F-18 in the hands of a 
single engine Cessna pilot?? -  Crash and Burn.   More importantly, knowing what we know now, how many new 
F-18s can you sell with these warnings?    Unfortunately, Mr. Taylor's analogy places him on the wrong side of 
the argument.
