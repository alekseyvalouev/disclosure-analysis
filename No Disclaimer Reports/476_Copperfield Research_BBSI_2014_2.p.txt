BBSI: Tick-Tick
Boom
Oct. 29, 2014 9:19 AM ET9 comments | Includes: Barrett Bâ€¦


After the close on 10/28/2014, BBSI reported a net loss of $5.27 per share,
driven by an $80 million pretax increase in workers' comp reserves. In our
previous report "Barrett Business Services (NASDAQ:BBSI): A Tick-Tick-
Ticking Time Bomb" we highlighted the systematic overstatement of earnings
due to persistent under accruing of workers' comp reserves. We also
highlighted the consistent trend of prior period adjustments, which in our
opinion, blatantly violated U.S. GAAP accounting rules. The result of the
accounting irregularities was a further overstatement of earnings. BBSI's $80
million pretax charge effectively wipes out the past five years of pretax
earnings. Further, the charge represents a 70% increase in workers'
compensation reserves compared to Q2'14. Said another way, our thesis that
BBSI has been writing economically unprofitable business (despite reporting
accounting profits) over the past few years, now appears incontrovertible.


As we highlighted in our original report, most of BBSI's sell-side analysts had
minimal insurance experience. As such, it our understanding the sell-side has
been relying on management's commentary to shape responses to our original
report. We believe the sell-side has been suggesting to institutional clients that
a charge between $5 and $10 million was a possibility. Considering the $80
million bombshell BBSI just dropped, it is understandable that the previously
promotional analysts may feel slightly misled. Further, in no way, does this
charge reset past mistakes.


Demonstrating management's condescending treatment of the investment
community, they provided an "adjusted EPS" figure that excludes the all-
important reserve charge. Make no mistake, the reserve charge reflects a
true-up for years of pre-tax earnings that were overstated. To "adjust" out the
most important and volatile cost of BBSI's business is akin to a utility
excluding its cost of generating electricity.

Even more disturbing, management provided a 12-month revenue outlook that
included high single-digit same store sales growth, despite apparently having
minimal basis to conclude the business they are underwriting is even
profitable. It is clear to us that this management team has limited visibility
into its insurance exposure. Management's suggestion that they will continue
to grow exposure despite having no ability to ensure that exposure is even
profitable, unequivocally tells us BBSI management is more concerned with
investor perception than right-sizing its future liabilities.


On top of the catastrophic reserve charge is BBSI's disclosure that "several
quarters" of "normalized" claims data will be necessary to "provide a clearer
indication of potential liability." Despite a previously unimaginable $80 million
charge, BBSI management appears to be confessing that future reserve
increases may still be needed. The culmination of all of this "sudden" bad
news appears to be BBSI's disclosure that it has entered into
discussions with its bank to "meet the liquidity needs of the
company." Based on our analysis, much of which was shared in our original
report, we would not be surprised if BBSI had insufficient cash to collateralize
its business with ACE. By extension, we believe the $80 million charge (with
more seemingly to come) could result in ACE re-evaluating its fronting
arrangement with BBSI. Despite the concerning statement regarding liquidity,
BBSI still had the audacity to buy a token amount of stock, for reasons we can
only guess are perception-based.


After the $80 million reserve charge, BBSI's shareholders' equity has been
reduced to a paltry $4.80 per share, while tangible equity declined to a
NEGATIVE $13.4 million. While we look forward to hearing their strategy to
address any liquidity challenges, it is our opinion that BBSI may ultimately
require a distressed equity raise.


It seems clear to us that management was very much aware of the
implications of its reserve deficiencies. Between its "pro-forma" report, token
buyback, completely irresponsible growth projections, and "off-line"
discussions with sell-side analysts, our guess is that many investors will see
through the ruse. Unfortunately, investors were not given the opportunity to
sell after-hours. Past earnings reports had been released by BBSI
approximately 10 minutes after the market had closed (4:10 PM ET). Perhaps
a mere coincidence, but with a high probability of pissed-off analysts and
