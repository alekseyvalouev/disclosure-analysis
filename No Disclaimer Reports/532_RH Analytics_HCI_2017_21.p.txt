HCI Group: $2.8M Gift To Mr. Patel, Courtesy Of Compensation
Committee

Summary


Paresh Patel continues to be quite well-paid despite the dramatic decline in
company earnings.


Mr. Patel likely failed to qualify for a performance-based bonus, but was awarded
cash and stock anyway.


The compensation committee awarded Mr. Patel $1.25M in cash and $1.56M in
stock despite what appears to be a failure to meet financial goals.


2016 was a very good year for HCI's CEO, if not its shareholders.


The cash bonus for Paresh Patel, the HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) CEO declined to $1.25M
in 2016 from $4M in 2015. At first glance, this may appear to be a small triumph for
shareholders, but it is not. Examining details reveals that the $1.25M cash award was only
part of the $2.8M in additional compensation awarded to Mr. Patel. Given company
performance, the cash and stock awards look more like gifts than bonus compensation for
excellent performance.


An 8-K on 12/30/16 announced management bonuses, including Mr. Patel's. It seemed an
unremarkable event until we read an article on the topic in the Tampa Bay Business
Journal. The headline reads "Tampa insurer cuts bonus for CEO". It quotes the filing in
explaining the bonuses: "the compensation committee gave considerable weight to the
company's expected net income in 2016 as compared to 2015". Our interpretation of this
is "earnings are declining a lot, therefore, we are going to buckle down pay executives
less", which would make sense given the -55.7% collapse in net income for the nine
months of 2016 to $24.4M from $54.8M in the prior period.


The article made us wonder if HCI's compensation committee was, indeed, getting tough
with executive pay in light of rapidly declining earnings. Alas, our analysis shows that it is
not the case. The get-tough language masks what looks like a give-away, at least in the
case of Mr. Patel. Examining HCI's 8-Ks associated with bonuses illuminates why.

Mr. Patel's 2015 cash award of $4M was made "pursuant to a performance-based cash
bonus plan", according to the 12/14/15 8-K. The plan was outlined in an 8-K earlier in the
year on 1/28/15, and stated that Mr. Patel would be entitled to a cash bonus of 3.25% of
EBITDA provided that HCI met the performance goal of $75M in EBITDA for the year
ending November 2015.


There was a noted shift in language between the 2015 and 2016 bonus announcements.
The 12/30/16 8-K states that Mr. Patel was awarded a "discretionary bonus" of $1.25M as
opposed to the "performance-based bonus" in 2015. The bonus plan for 2016 was
outlined in an 8-K on 2/4/16. It stated that Mr. Patel was entitled to a performance-based
bonus of 3% of EBITDA if the performance goal of $75M in EBITDA for the period was
met.


In all likelihood, Mr. Patel did not meet the performance goal, thus was not entitled to a
performance-based bonus, which would explain the shift to the discretionary bonus. The
dramatic downward trajectory of performance over the last year indicates as much. It is
shown below.


Financial Summary


Source: Company filings and estimates


2015 roughly corresponds with the period and EBITDA used to calculate Mr. Patel's bonus
for that year. The number indicates that Mr. Patel would have qualified for a performance
bonus even if EBITDA for the 2016 period declined -38% to $75M from approximately
$122M. It's an interesting world where a 38% decline in EBITDA is considered an
achievement to be rewarded. Even then, the nine-month figures for 2015 and 2016 show
that EBITDA collapsed -47.2% thus far in 2016, suggesting that even that low bar was not
met.

We don't view the $1.25M discretionary bonus as a cut, but rather something of a gift,
given that Mr. Patel probably did not qualify for a performance-based bonus. It appears
as if the compensation committee created a 'discretionary' bonus ex post facto to
give Mr. Patel something after he failed to meet his performance goal for the year.


But that's not all.


On 1/7/16, HCI announced that the compensation committee awarded Mr. Patel 40,000
shares of stock and options to purchase 110,000 shares at $40. The options could expire
worthless, but the stock is currently valued at $1.56M. It looks like another gift from the
compensation committee to Mr. Patel.


The stock award was made pursuant to the 2012 omnibus incentive plan, which gives the
compensation committee "the authority to determine the compensation" of executives and
make equity awards. The discretionary bonus plus the stock award take Mr. Patel's
non-salary compensation to over $2.81M. 2016 turned out to be a terrific year for Mr.
Patel, if not for his shareholders.


The article from the Tampa Bay Business Journal was technically correct in that Mr.
Patel's cash bonus declined from $4M to $1.25M. However, citing the compensation
committee's faux tough language and calling it a cut is a misunderstanding or
mischaracterization of the events. In our view, getting a $1.25M bonus after missing
targets while presiding over a -55% decline in earnings is a very generous gift. Add to that
the $1.56M stock award and Mr. Patel has a pretty sweet deal, particularly in light of the
poor financial results.


Last June, the Tampa Bay Business Journal wrote an article titled Tampa attorney wins
another stint on HCI board, despite shareholders vote, pay practice concerns. The article
notes that the board member was installed despite that "most shareholders did not vote
for his reelection". It also noted that Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that
HCI shareholders withhold votes for all board nominees due to pay practices and
shareholder rights issues. We wrote about the topic here: HCI Group: Is Management
Disregarding Shareholder Votes?


As it happens, that Tampa Attorney referenced in the article is Martin Traber, who is,
according to HCI's 2015 10-K, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee. We suspect
the company's wrangling with corporate governance watchdogs may not be over.
