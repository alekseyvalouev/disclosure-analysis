First, it contains the following convincing statement (1): 
 
The transaction was doubtlessly a great success for all shareholders because it laid the expected 
successful foundation for the digital transformation and subsequent positive share price 
performance of the last three years.

This statement is inserted within the narrative simply to justify the decision without addressing 
its legitimacy.  
 
Second, at no point is the issue of Müller and Dirk Ströer’s personal profit from these 
transactions addressed. This is a conspicuous omission. 
 
Third, the multiple references to the knowledge and participation of the board(s) in these 
decisions provides little comfort in light of the highly questionable composition of the board and 
the previously avoided topic of their “proper independence”.  
 
Fourth, the extreme brevity of their response (below) to the allegations surrounding the timing of 
three key employees and Board members leaving. The timing of these departures and their 
conjunction with the freeXmedia deal leaves little room for any other reason than they disagreed 
with the transaction. What did they disagree with? How were they treated for disagreeing? Why 
have no details been provided for why they left?  
 
The claim by Muddy Waters Capital that two officers resigned from office in connection with the 
transaction in December 2012 is false. 
 
How so? What alternative explanation can you provide to the extremely circumspect timing of 
their departure? Does this response eliminate doubt, or increase it?  
 
Extreme brevity is also an indicator in the following statement: 
 
There is also no link between the appointment of Mr. Vilanek to the supervisory board and the 
acquisition of freeXmedia; freeXmedia was only a smaller part of the entire Ströer Interactive 
transaction. 
 
How so? What alternative explanation can you provide to the extremely circumspect timing of 
the transaction, his rapid appointment to the Board and eventually ascension to Chairman? In 
general, where there is smoke there is fire.  
 
The abundance of circumstantial evidence is hard to ignore. In light of specific allegations the 
honest person will provide very detailed responses that eliminate doubt because they know the 
facts are on their side. The brevity and limited factual content of the above responses serve only 
to obfuscate and not clarify the events in question.

Ströer Insiders’ Self-Dealing Goes Beyond freeXmedia.  
 
Ströer SE:

There is no self-dealing as suggested by Muddy Waters Capital and no transaction wrongly 
declared as being disadvantageous to Ströer. 
 
All related party transactions are presented to the supervisory board for approval in advance in 
accordance with Ströer's longstanding internal governance rules; the board of management and 
supervisory board members involved disclose any conflicts of interest and refrain from voting. 
Furthermore, all such transactions are subject to an annual review to verify that they were 
carried out at arm's length and properly processed.  
 
This example demonstrates that the board of management, supervisory board and major 
shareholders examine related party transactions with particular care and place the highest 
requirements on corporate governance and compliance. 
This also applies to MediaVentures as a client of Ströer SE & Co KGaA: We accept all orders 
that add value regardless of whether an employee is a shareholder provided that they comply 
with our general terms and conditions and that they are not to the detriment of the Company. 
The volume of business from MediaVentures accounts for less than 1% of our consolidated 
revenues. It is reviewed every year by our auditor to verify that it is properly executed and 
conducted at arm's length terms and was presented to the supervisory board when the orders 
were placed and whenever there was a change. 
 
The same applies with regard to Ströer SE & Co KGaA's business relationship with SAW under 
the marketing agreement with SAW, which allows Ströer SE & Co KGaA to market SAW 
advertising faces. This transparent contractual relationship of Ströer SE & Co KGaA was 
already explained in detail in the IPO and presented transparently in each annual report. Most 
recently, SAW expanded its portfolio in Berlin by some 1,000 traditional billboards. This 
transaction is in the interests of Ströer SE & Co KGaA as Ströer SE & Co KGaA had already 
announced at the time of the IPO that it no longer intended to invest in traditional billboards, but 
rather only increase its marketing reach in the area of traditional billboards existing at the time 
of the IPO by way of marketing orders from third parties (such as SAW). 
 
Regarding the expansion of our portfolio in the out-of-home segment, Ströer SE & Co KGaA 
exclusively focuses on modern backlit and digital advertising media and has not invested in 
traditional billboards for more than five years. 
 
This response, although very lengthy, is noteworthy for what is omitted. In this section MWC 
makes multiple specific allegations (see MWC Report). People and companies are called out by 
name – family ties, circular cash flow, significant insider stock transactions, and a foundation 
associated with an insider are provided. These issues, if addressed at all are done so in very 
broad terms. Again, few vindicating facts are provided to remove doubt. 
 
In the following sections (X, XI, and XV in particular), the pattern continues. Ströer SE offers 
extremely general and broad responses to very specific allegations, side-stepping the harder 
issues and focusing on trivial details. Their selective responses are often padded with convincing 
statements designed to bolster trust in their processes. Repeated references to the processes of the 
board(s), lawyers, and outside reviews are designed to convince rather than convey. When asked 
to explain an extreme jump in profit in the Infoscreen area, Ströer SE simply states, “On

principle, we do not make any detailed statements on margins or on the profitability of individual 
products, product groups or entities.” This stands in stark contrast to Udo Müller’s comments on 
22 April, “But if you want to have information, surely you will get it from us.”  
 
 
Summary 
 
The management of Ströer SA have displayed multiple behaviors associated with deception. 
Their rebuttal, ostensibly designed to increase confidence in their actions and methods has 
achieved the opposite. Primarily, they have failed to insert clear facts which unequivocally 
eliminate the viability of the allegations made against them. In the majority of their replies they 
focused on insignificant details and avoided the harder core accusations entirely. Many of the 
significant facts and issues raised by the MWC Report have gone un-addressed and demand 
further explanation. In light of the data sampled in this analysis, the following assumptions are 
highly probable.  
 


• Ströer SE’s management has exercised excessive influence over the Board(s) to 
approve questionable transactions. 


• A dysfunctional culture exists on the Board which appears to be dominated by the 
will or personality of the founding members. This poses a risk to investors. 


• Ströer SE’s management has stretched the ethical boundaries of their financial 
reporting and methodology to paint a better picture of company performance. 


• Müller and Dirk Ströer have designed and executed multiple complex transactions 
to obfuscate their personal profits, and they are particularly concerned about the 
allegations made in Section VIII of the MWC Report.
