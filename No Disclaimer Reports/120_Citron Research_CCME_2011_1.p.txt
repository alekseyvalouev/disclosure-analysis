CITRON RESEARCH
REPORTS ON CHINA MEDIA
EXPRESS (NASDAQ:CCME)


The China Reverse Merger stock that is
“Too Good to be True”


Every investor protection website, from the SEC on
down, posts this advice for investors:  “If it sounds
too good to be true, it is…” Looking back on major
frauds like Bernie Mado�, the most common
expression of regret from duped investors is
framed just this way.  Yet the “too good to be true”
story is always tempting — especially so for those
who haven’t been burned yet.


China Media Express (NASDAQ:CCME) operates a
very simple business.  They claim to be the largest
television advertising operator on inter-city buses
and airport express buses in China.


Management claims the company has grown faster
and produced more cash �ow than any other US
listed Chinese media company over the last 4
years.   In spite of having spent a mere fraction of
what competitors have on infrastructure, CCME has
purportedly grown pro�ts from $2M to to its
recently raised guidance of $85M expected this
year, on revenues of $200 million.   Over the last 8
quarters, CCME reported generating $95 million of
cash �ow after all CAPEX and for-cash acquisitions.  
If true, this ROI would be one of the highest in the

world, and a complete outlier in the Chinese
advertising market, generating even more pro�t
than giant Focus Media, and outpacing all of their
competition by a landslide, despite their smaller
footprint.   There is only one problem:  No One in
China Has Ever Heard of Them.  It is Citron’s
opinion that if this company were operating in
the United States, the stock would have buckled
long-ago over the lack of transparency in its story.
 
The perpetual burden of the short seller is “how can
you prove a negative?”  The internet has created
new approaches to that conundrum.   It wasn’t so
easy �nding public information on “sewage waste-
water treatment” in China , (that being the investor
catastrophe that was RINO), or  getting speci�cs on
a business model with such a broad name and
scope as “China Energy Savings” (ditto CESV).   So
when both companies turned out to be frauds,
shareholders’ due diligence failures could be
understood.
By contrast, advertising on mass transit in China is
an extremely well-known and highly visible
business.  Therefore, there is no excuse for a lack
of proper due diligence on CCME.
Does anyone know how to use
Google or Baidu??
.
If you simply go to Google or Baidu and put in the
Chinese names for the three principal public media
advertising operators in China, you will �nd a
plethora of local media coverage about them in
their native Chinese language.  Articles range from
new routes, partnerships, and industry information.
巴士在线  – Bus-online
世通华纳 – Towona
华视传媒  -VisionChina
Yet, if you Google or Baidu 中国高速频道 for CCME
or 福建分众传媒, CCME’s operating company, you
will see not one article written on their operating
business.  There is vacuum of local media coverage
of the company.  So we are supposed to believe
that the most pro�table advertising company in
China is just unknown to the Chinese people?
CCME — The Phantom Company

http://citronresearch.com/citron-research-reports-on-china-media-express-nasdaqccme/ 3/8


. 
The clearest example of the “phantom” CCME is an
87 page report prepared by Analysis International
on the Chinese Outdoor LCD Screen Market for the
year 2010.   Every major real player in the space is
mentioned…not just the top three, but the top ten! 
And guess who is missing?  CCME is not mentioned
anywhere in the doc.
http://wenku.baidu.com/view/7a59ad51ad02de80d4d84011
[https://wenku.baidu.com/view/7a59ad51ad02de80d4d840
.
Then there was a recent article written in January
2011 about 360 media , the largest live trading
platform for outdoor media in China.  In it, they
discuss all of inter-city bus advertising and again,
with no mention of CCME.    Covered entities are
Towona, Bus-Online, and Vision China Media.

[http://news.cnfol.com/110121/101,1587,9211427,00.shtml]
.
This one is from China Business Intelligence, which
mentions every player in the space and again…no
CCME:

[http://chinabizintel.com/industry-updates/public-

OK … just one more.  This one is from CNTV, China
Network Television, which mentions everyone in
the “bus media space”….no CCME.

So CCME is a black box, a company that does not
appear on its industry’s radar, beyond their stock
symbol.  A simple trip to the CCME website does
not reveal much, either for investors or potential
business partners.   If you go try to get a rate card,
you get nothing.

It appears to Citron that CCME’s entire website is
intended solely to reinforce the real business of
CCME — which is pushing the stock.   All of this
non-disclosure on their site and in �lings is in stark
contrast to the colorful investor presentations that
proclaim clients and partners that we read about in
no other places except investor presentations.

Contrast this to the real companies in the bus ad
operating space. Below are the sites of Vision, Bus-
online, and Towona.  All 3 show either:  routes, rate
cards, media mentions, and advertising partners on
both client and agency side.  While apparently
dwarfed in size by CCME’s reported �nancial
results, each of these competitors have legitimate
and documented relationships with large scale
advertisers and bus operators as identi�ed
throughout their sites.

How can CCME generate three and a half times the
revenue per screen of its competitors?  CCME has
roughly 55-60K displays; VISN has appx 120,000
screens.  In Q2, 2010. VISN’s total revenue was $31
million and CCME generated $53 million from less
than half the screens.  Remember that VISN
operates bus advertising in major metropolitan
areas, compared to CCME, which claims inter-city
buses between 2nd and 3rd tier markets.    That is
what the company wants investors to believe.


The Cover-up
.


The company’s attempted to add some clarity to
their story at its recent investor day.   Out of all the
people who could have spoken positively about the
company, they chose a representative from
Shanghai Apollo Culture Corp.  上海阿波罗文化艺术
公司, 张旭东.   Here is the video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tli7AI2r9Io
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tli7AI2r9Io] .  
In reality Apollo is nothing more than a 2 person
shop that can barely pay their bills and had annual
revenue of $330K RMB (yes $60K US Dollars), as
stated in this article below.


http://www.51jms.com/news/137195.htm
[http://www.51jms.com/news/137195.htm]
The lack of disclosure extends to the last two press
releases about the actual business from CCME that
announce two sizable contracts , but no
counterparties … in typical CCME fashion.

Debunking The “Alleged”
Government Deal.
.
In the �lings we read that CCME has become the
“sole strategic partner for “an entity a�liated with
the Ministry of Transport”.  In reality the deal is with
the (Transport Television Audio Video Center)
TTAVC.  This is not an “exclusive with the

government”, but rather with a Production
Company with government a�liation and should
have no authority over directing local bus
advertising.  Better yet, if you go to the website of
TTAVC and look under a list of companies who they
work with, CCME is noticeably absent.   Neither can
you �nd CCME operating subsidiary anywhere on
the site of the TTAVC.
http://www.jtbtv.com/worktogether.php
[http://www.jtbtv.com/worktogether.php]
.
Citron notes that CCME has further confused the
story for the US Investor to think that they have an
exclusive with the Government for inter-city buses.
 That is just a lie.  We are not saying there is no deal
with this production company, just that it does not
appear to be signi�cant enough to be written
anywhere except some corporate �lings.

No Substantial Analyst Coverage
.


It appears that CCME might be a darling for college
kids and bloggers (retail), but the analysts know
better.   Ask yourself this question:  How could the
fastest growing advertising company in all of China,
with industry leading margins and pro�t, not even
get a proper analyst to believe this crazy story?


The two analysts who cover CCME are Global
Hunter and Northland.  Global Hunter, a small new
�rm, has been a long time banker of Chinese RTOs
and even had a $20 target on RINO.  
http://www.streetinsider.com/New+Coverage/Global+Hunte
(RINO)+at+Buy/5998411.html
[http://www.streetinsider.com/New+Coverage/Global+Hunt
(RINO)+at+Buy/5998411.html] .


As for Northland Securities, as a professional
courtesy, the editor of Citron phoned analyst
Darren Aftahi yesterday, to see if they knew
something Citron didn’t.  After a nice conversation,
Darren admitted the possibility that China Media
could be a fraud.  Furthermore, Citron believes that
Northland and its analyst have become mere
cheerleaders for the stock, as this morning they

recommended their clients “buy on weakness”
without considering the doubts of their own analyst
or having the bene�t of all available information.   It
is Citron’s opinion that urging clients to buy without
considering important concerns just now surfacing
is like encouraging people to drink the Kool Aid
without �nding out �rst what’s in it.


By contrast, Focus Media, while larger in top line
but lower operating income, is covered by: 
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, CSFB and Deutsche
Bank.  More alarming are Vision China Media and
AirMedia which are a fraction of CCME’s pro�tability
and market cap, yet are covered by JP Morgan, BOA,
and Oppenheimer.
The moral of the story is that short sellers are not
the only ones who are aware of the problems with
CCME.  It has become a stock for the “sucker retail
investor”….sorry to say, but true.
Not only have the mainstream analysts and local
media ignored CCME, but none of the other
Chinese advertising companies list CCME as a
competitor in their SEC �lings.   These include
Focus, AirMedia, and Vision China Media.  That
leaves this company a complete mystery to
everyone except its fervent shareholders.
They Got the Big Mac, We Got the Big
Mick.
.
In order to add to the confusion over the story and
possibly to further themselves on someone else’s
reputation, we would like to point out something
very odd.  In Chinese, the name of the CCME’s
operating corp. is “Fujian Focus Media” — Fujian
being the province they are domiciled.   Focus
Media is the largest and most respected advertising
company in China.   To make your name so similar
would be as if someone were to open a software
company in New York and called it “Microsoft New
York”.  This does not seem like behavior of a
company that wants to build a brand, but rather a
company opting for deception instead of brand-
building.

In preparing this report, Citron has come across a
plethora of information pointing to CCME being a
fraud.   These include but are not limited to:  SAIC
documents, Credit Rating Agency Documents, fake
awards and accolades, quotes from industry
professionals, and more �nancial analysis than this
company even deserves.  The purpose of this
report was to look at CCME using simple common
sense to understand that the company does not
exist at the scale that they are reporting to the
investing public.  We are not saying that they do not
operate any buses, but if you believe that the
company operations are truly re�ected, or even
close to their stated �nancial disclosures, than you
must go to Taco Bell for some �let mignon.
