In 2018, Prescience Point published two research reports (the “Initiation Report” and the “Q3 18 Update 
Report”) on Kellogg Company (“K”, or “the Company”).  We predicted K would be forced to (1) reduce FY 18 
guidance and (2) cut its dividend or else lose its credit rating.  Part one of our thesis was proven correct 
when K slashed its FY 18 adjusted EBIT and earnings growth guidance in Q3 18.  Moreover, after Kraft Heinz’s 
(“KHC”) recent disastrous results and dividend cut, we are even more convinced that it’s only a matter of 
time before K follows suit as K is less profitable and more financially strained by comparison.  K’s new 
disclosures and persistent deceptive tactics reinforce our expectations for more pain to be inflicted on 
K shareholders.  We believe K (1) will be forced to cut its dividend or lose its credit rating and (2) will miss 
and/or need to reduce FY 19 guidance.   
 


Prescience Point Research Opinions: 
 
• KHC’s recent debacle should terrify K shareholders; K is in much worse shape but has been able to 


hide behind aggressive financial engineering: On 02/21/19, KHC announced (1) very poor Q4 18 results 
and FY 19 guidance, (2) a dividend cut, (3) a $15.4 billion impairment, and (4) receipt of an SEC 
subpoena.  In response, KHC shares traded down over 27.0% and it was put on negative credit watch 
by S&P.  We believe K will share the same fate as it is not only less profitable and more financially 
strained than KHC but has weaker corporate governance and has concealed severe deterioration 
using accounting gimmicks.  K’s premium equity valuation and better credit ratings relative to KHC 
are unwarranted.           
 


• Guidance for strong second-half in FY 19 is setting shareholders up for more disappointment: K 
continues to kick the can down the road while management is still not being forthright with 
shareholders. Sell-side analysts continue to anchor expectations to K’s overly optimistic guidance, 
setting investors up for more disappointment, especially as accounting excesses “un-wind.”       
 


• New Risk Factor confirms “un-wind” of DSO & DPO build will wreak havoc on performance: K added 
a new Risk Factor in its FY 18 10K that corroborates the working capital “un-wind” will lead to a financial 
reckoning.   


 
• K is not the dividend stalwart shareholders believe it to be; cash is extremely tight and risk of a 


dividend cut or credit downgrade is high and rising:  K doesn’t generate enough cash to cover 
dividends and short-term obligations.  As a result, we believe K’s recently announced asset sales 
are not opportunistic, but necessary to fund buybacks, pay dividends, and shore up the balance 
sheet.   


 
• Shares are trading at an unjustifiably high valuation:  Based on our adjustments, K is trading at 15.4x 


NTM P/E and 12.7x EV/EBITDA vs. KHC at 11.1x and 10.6x, respectively.  Further, K’s adjusted leverage ratio 
of 4.4x remains in-line with high yield CPG peers.  We reiterate our K price target of $39.50.  Shares 
still have ~30% downside.

Thesis Update: Kellogg has Temporarily Avoided the Same Fate as Kraft 
Heinz by Concealing Fundamental Deterioration with Aggressive 
Financial Engineering 


We remain short shares of Kellogg Company with high conviction.  Kellogg’s Q4 18 results and FY 19 guidance 
did little to assuage any of our concerns.  In fact, we believe shareholders may be in for another disappointing 
year as the working capital “un-wind” discussed in our prior reports continues and profit growth is pushed out 
to FY 20 at the earliest - just as we predicted. 
 
In addition, we believe Kraft Heinz’s recent atrocious results/guidance and dividend cut are a harbinger of more 
pain for Kellogg shareholders, as Kellogg is substantially less profitable and more financially strained.1  For 
comparison: 
 


• Kraft Heinz is over 50.0% more profitable  
 


• Kellogg’s DSOs are ~3x higher 
  


• Kellogg’s DPO is ~15.0% higher 
 


• Kellogg’s self-proclaimed “Best-in-Class” working capital is actually worse in each of the last three 
years 


 
• Kellogg’s Audit Committee has minimal to no accounting/finance experience or educational 


background  
 


• Kellogg has a higher credit rating despite an equivalent adjusted leverage ratio  
 


• Kellogg trades at an ~40.0% premium to adjusted FY 19 P/E 
 
All said, we are not trying to minimize the issues at hand for Kraft Heinz or to pour salt on its wounds, but rather 
to underscore how serious problems are for Kellogg.  Over the last several years, we believe it’s evident Kraft 
Heinz benefited from unsustainably low SG&A levels that certainly had negative implications with respect to (1) 
relationships with its customers and (2) neglect of marketing certain brands and/or product categories.  
However, we find it hard to believe Kraft Heinz’s profitability would need to be cut by one-third (to be in-line with 
Kellogg’s profitability) to remedy these issues.  Despite clear problems at Kraft Heinz, we believe Kellogg is still 
in much worse shape.         
 
There were also several notable items since our Q3 18 Update Report that further corroborate our thesis that 
Kellogg shareholders are in for a drawn out and painful period, ultimately ending with a dividend cut or loss of 
investment grade credit rating.  Specifically: 
 


• New FY 18 10K Risk Factor related to extended terms for customers and suppliers confirms reversal of 
DSO and DPO build will wreak havoc on performance

• Kellogg’s deceptive behavior continued as it (1) claimed FY 18 cash was “roughly even” with pre-
recasted FY 17 cash flow despite a negative differential of 16.3% and (2) continued to tout improved 
working capital performance without acknowledging its receivable factoring program 
 


• Kashi impairment could be forthcoming as excess fair value diminished and FY 18 disclosure does not 
agree with FY 17  
 


• Capital structure remains under pressure as Kellogg’s liquidity for dividends and short-term 
obligations is beyond tight  
 


We reiterate Kellogg’s recent results indicate the financial reckoning we predicted in April 2018 is upon us and 
gaining speed.  We continue to believe Kellogg is substantially less profitable, more levered, and more 
expensive than meets the eye.

Kellogg is Less Profitable than Kraft Heinz, Significantly More Aggressive in 
its Accounting, & Has More Questionable Expert Oversight   


On 02/21/19, Kraft Heinz reported Q4 18 results and provided FY 19 guidance that were both well below 
expectations.  In addition, Kraft Heinz announced (1) it would reduce its quarterly dividend by 36.0% from 
$0.625/share to $0.40/share, (2) a non-cash impairment of $15.4 billion related to the Kraft and Oscar Mayer 
trademarks and US Refrigerated and Canada Retail reporting units, and (3) it received a subpoena from the 
SEC in October 2018 associated with an investigation into the Company’s procurement area (including 
accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls).  In response, Kraft Heinz shares plunged over 27.0%.   
 
In our Initiation Report nearly a year ago (April 2018), we predicted Kellogg would need to cut its dividend or 
risk losing its investment grade credit rating.  After Kraft Heinz’s recent disastrous results and dividend cut, we 
are even more convinced that Kellogg will need to follow suit as Kellogg is in much worse financial shape.  
Indeed, our original thesis has already begun to unfold; Kellogg shareholders should be terrified as they could 
share the same fate. 
 
Kellogg is substantially less profitable than Kraft Heinz  
It’s no secret Kraft Heinz has industry leading margins driven by its now infamous Zero-Based-Budgeting (ZBB) 
tactics.  However, some might find it surprising Kraft Heinz’s profitability was over 50.0% higher than Kellogg’s; 
even more surprising when you consider Kellogg instituted its own ZBB initiative in FY 15 and spent the last 
decade in a perpetual state of “restructuring” to improve margins.

So, why the huge margin disparity? 
 
The majority of the divergence stems from selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) cost leverage.  Kellogg’s 
SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue are roughly 2x higher than Kraft Heinz’s.  We believe Kraft Heinz’s 
atrocious Q4 18 results and FY 19 guidance are evidence that its SG&A levels may have been unsustainably 
low and certainly had negative implications with respect to relationships with its customers and neglect of 
certain brands and/or product categories.  However, we find it hard to believe Kraft Heinz would need to

double its SG&A spend to remedy its indiscretions.  In other words, despite clear problems with Kraft Heinz’s

Kraft Heinz may have factored receivables, but Kellogg is in a league of its own; Kellogg’s adjusted DSOs are 
~3x higher  
Pre-factoring (Kellogg started in Q1 16), Kellogg’s DSOs were consistently in the mid-30 range.  Kraft Heinz 
stopped its US factoring program in Q2 18 and its smaller International program in Q3 18; DSOs in the back-
half of FY 18 were in the high-20s.  While Kellogg may have inherently longer collection periods than Kraft Heinz 
(perhaps due to its smaller size and less leverage with customers), it’s hard to find a plausible explanation to 
justify DSOs that are ~3x higher.

Kellogg and Kraft Heinz were both able to extend DPO in recent years, but Kellogg was much more aggressive  
Since FY 14, Kellogg has used a reverse factoring arrangement (or “payable tracking system”) which allowed 
suppliers to sell payment obligations from Kellogg to designated third-party financial institutions (i.e. banks) 
and thereby extended Kellogg’s DPO.  Kraft Heinz was also able to extend its DPO, although not to the same 
extent as Kellogg.  In its FY 16 10K, Kraft Heinz indicated changes in accounts payable were favorable due to 
payment term extensions from vendor renegotiations.   
 
While Kraft Heinz took advantage of longer payment terms to its suppliers as well, we believe there is a 
nuanced, but important difference.  According to Kraft Heinz’s disclosures, we believe it was able to 
renegotiate with suppliers instead of having to use a reverse factoring arrangement.  Consequently, Kraft 
Heinz payment obligations remain due to its suppliers rather than a bank; Kellogg’s reverse factored payment 
obligations are due to a bank, not the supplier.  Perhaps more important, is the fact Kellogg was much more 
aggressive in unsustainably extending its DPO.  Since Q1 16, Kellogg’s average DPO was 93 days vs. Kraft Heinz’s 
81 days (~15.0% higher).

Kellogg’s self-proclaimed “Best-in-Class” working capital appears to be a farce; Kraft Heinz’s was better in 
each of the last three years   
Since FY 16, Kraft Heinz’s adjusted working capital levels bested Kellogg’s on both an adjusted and reported 
basis.  We have two takeaways: (1) Kellogg is less efficient with its working capital than Kraft Heinz and (2) 
Kellogg’s “Best-in-Class” and “industry leading” proclamations are simply untrue.

Heinz’s Audit Committee includes a former CFO, hedge fund executive, and a private equity executive.  Not to 
mention Mr. Warren Buffet was on the Board of Directors until the spring of 2018.   
 
Based on the significant amount of accounting irregularities we have identified at Kellogg, we are extremely 
concerned the intricacies and nuances may not be fully understood by an Audit Committee without requisite 
experience and expertise.  Moreover, if a misstep of this magnitude and an SEC Subpoena related to 
accounting policies, procedures, and internal control can happen under the watch of experts at Kraft Heinz, 
how much worse could it be for Kellogg?  It’s a recipe for disaster.

on 02/22/19, S&P revised Kraft Heinz’s outlook to negative from stable (Kellogg’s outlook is stable) on 
“weakening credit metrics” after Kraft Heinz reported Q4 18 results.2  We believe Kellogg warrants the same 
level of scrutiny from the credit ratings agencies, if not even more, as Kellogg’s accounting excesses dwarf 
those at Kraft Heinz.

Kraft Heinz’s shares and valuation multiple were rightly hit after its disastrous results.  However, by 
comparison, Kellogg is still substantially less profitable and significantly more exposed to the negative 
implications of massive accounting excesses.  Based on our conservative estimates, Kellogg is currently 
trading at a ~40.0 premium to Kraft Heinz’s FY 19 P/E and a ~20.0% premium to FY 19 EV/EBITDA.  We believe this 
premium is completely unwarranted.

New Risk Factor Confirms Our Prediction the Reversal of DSO & DPO Build

In our Initiation and Q3 18 Update Reports, we discussed Kellogg’s extended terms and reverse factoring 
programs at length and the negative repercussions the “un-wind” will have on revenue growth and cash flow.  
In Q4 18, factored receivables and adjusted DSOs continued to trend lower, consistent with our prior 
expectations.3  In short, we continue to believe customers are sitting on too much channel inventory and no 
longer want to purchase more inventory than required (i.e. utilizing extended term options).  Instead, we 
believe customers want to take advantage of early payment discounts which will continue to negatively 
impact Kellogg’s revenue and profitability.  In Q4 18, DPO remained unsustainably high.  We continue to believe 
this will reverse course in the intermediate term and negatively impact cash flow.           
 
In its FY 18 10K, Kellogg added a new Risk Factor that specifically addressed the negative working capital 
implications if the Company’s extended payment term arrangements for customers and/or suppliers were 
reversed (i.e. “un-wound”). 
 


We utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party 
financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital. If the extension of 
payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation, our ability to 
maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted. 
 
Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major 
acquisitions and other significant transactions.  We utilize third-party financing programs to offset the 
negative impact of offering extended customer payment terms.  In addition, in combination with 
extending supplier payment terms, structured payables programs are available to our suppliers 
which enable suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter bilateral agreements to sell Company 
payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. 


 
Changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these third party financing programs less 
attractive to the financial institutions purchasing trade accounts receivables and Company payment 
obligations thereunder and these financial institutions may seek to terminate their participation. In 
the event of such termination or if our extended payment terms are reversed, our ability to effectively 
manage core working capital could be adversely impacted. 


(FY 18 10K) [emphasis added] 
 
Kellogg started its reverse factoring program in the beginning of FY 14 and its receivable factoring program in 
FY 16.  So, why was this Risk Factor just added now?  
 
We suspect it’s due to substantially less interest by customers and vendors in Kellogg’s extended term 
arrangements.  Moreover, we can’t stress enough that Risk Factors are somewhat of a proxy for a legal 
disclaimer to investors; Risk Factors are used to address risk and uncertainties that could materially adversely 
affect a company’s business.  In other words, if the share price tanks, a company can point investors to its Risk 
Factors and say “see, we warned you this could happen.”      
 


FY 19 EBIT Guidance Flat (As We Predicted); Guidance for Strong Second-
Half is Setting Investors Up for Disappointment   


In our Q3 18 Update Report, we predicted “FY 19 operating profit growth will be well below initial expectations 
and any hope of profit growth will be pushed into FY 20 at the earliest” 
Kellogg’s FY 19 guidance confirmed our prediction; profit growth will have to wait until at least FY 20.

Kellogg guided for adjusted operating profit to decline in the first-half of FY 19 but be offset by growth in the 
second-half.  We have seen this story before.  Heavily weighted back-half growth can be inherently 
problematic; everything must go right in order to just meet guidance.  We believe Kellogg’s second-half 
growth guidance is overly optimistic and remain concerned sell-side estimates anchored to Kellogg’s 
guidance are not appropriately discounting the havoc the receivable “un-wind” will have on revenue growth 
and profitability.

Kellogg Continues to be Disingenuous with Investors 


In our prior Reports, we specifically called out multiple instances were Kellogg appeared to be disingenuous 
and, in some cases, even misleading to investors.  For example: 
 


• Touted improved and Best-in-Class” working capital levels without accounting for factored 
receivables 


 
• Removed working capital slide from Investor Presentations as soon as the reported metric started 


to deteriorate  
 


• Contradictory commentary regarding FY 18 guidance reduction and previous re-iterations 
 


• Eliminated North America business unit-level disclosures  
 
In Q4 18, the mischievousness continued.  Kellogg shareholders should be extremely cautious as this type of 
behavior is a hallmark example of a company trying to hide something.   
 
Slide 9 of Kellogg’s Q4 18 Investor Deck contained two very misleading statements 
First, FY 18 cash flow of $958.0 million was “roughly even” with pre-recast FY 17.  Second, improving core working 
capital.  We will debunk each below.

Kashi impairment could be forthcoming; FY 18 10K fair value disclosure doesn’t agree with FY 17 10K  
In its FY 17 10K, Kellogg indicated it had $207.0 million of goodwill related to Kashi and the percentage of excess 
over fair value was “approximately 30.0%.” 
 


We have $207 million of goodwill related to our Kashi reporting unit, which was primarily a result of 
establishing Kashi as a separate operating segment in 2015, which required an allocation of goodwill 
from our U.S. Snacks operating segment.  The 2017 fair value of the Kashi reporting unit was estimated 
primarily based on a multiple of net sales and discounted cash flows.  The percentage of excess over 
fair value was approximately 30%.  The use of modestly different assumptions in the valuation could 
have resulted in an impairment. 


(FY 17 10K) [emphasis added] 
 
In its FY 18 10K, Kellogg indicated its excess over fair value was only 12.0%, well below the reported level in FY 17.  
However, more peculiar is the fact the FY 18 disclosure stated FY 17 excess over fair value was 9.0%, not 30.0% 
as disclosed in the FY 17 10K.    
 


The Company has $207 million of goodwill related to the Kashi reporting unit, which was primarily a 
result of establishing Kashi as a separate operating segment in 2015, which required an allocation of 
goodwill from our U.S. Snacks operating segment.  The 2018 fair value of the Kashi reporting unit was 
estimated primarily based on a multiple of net sales and discounted cash flows.  The percentage of 
excess over fair value was approximately 12% and 9%, in 2018 and 2017, respectively, using the same 
methodology on a year-on-year basis. 


(FY 18 10K) [emphasis added] 
 
Both the FY 17 and FY 18 10K indicated the estimated fair value was primarily based on a multiple of net sales 
and discounted cash flows but provided no further discussion as to specifics.  We hypothesize Kellogg may 
have updated its valuation multiple and/or discount rate for Kashi in FY 18 to adjust for a weaker outlook, 
thereby resulting in a lower excess fair value vs. the original FY 17 disclosure.  Consequently, we believe 
weaker-than-expected Kashi performance could suggest an impairment may be forthcoming.

Capital Structure Remains Under Pressure, Kellogg is Still Significantly 
More Leveraged Than It Appears 


Liquidity for dividends and short-term obligations remains extremely tight 
The only adjustment we made to FY 19 consensus EBITDA was a 50% addback of Project K/restructuring 
charges.  We continue to believe this estimate is extremely conservative.  So, even with conservative 
estimates, Kellogg’s liquidity for dividends and short-term obligations is beyond tight.  We continue to believe 
it’s highly probable run-rate EBITDA could be materially lower as accounting excesses reverse.

K is still significantly more leveraged than it appears  
Nearly all of Kellogg’s peers with net debt/EBITDA above 4.0x have non-investment grade credit ratings and/or 
are on negative credit watch.  We continue to believe Kellogg’s adjusted net debt/EBTIDA of 4.4x suggests it 
may soon join its non-investment grade peers.  Again, while a high net debt/EBITDA does not mean Kellogg’s 
credit rating should be instantly downgraded, we do believe it corroborates the fact that Kellogg has limited 
capital structure flexibility.

Restructuring charges adjustment 
In our Initiation Report, we argued excluding “non-recurring” restructuring charges that persist for more than 
five years does not accurately reflect the costs associated with running the business.  If a business needs 
perpetual restructuring, the costs should not be excluded as “non-recurring.”  In addition, persistent 
restructuring charges provide the Company an opportunity to bucket normal recurring costs as 
“restructuring” and have them excluded from non-GAAP results.  An argument could be made that all 
restructuring charges should be included in comparable operating income (and EBITDA), but to be on the 
more conservative side, we only included 50% of the restructuring charges in our adjusted EBITDA metric.
