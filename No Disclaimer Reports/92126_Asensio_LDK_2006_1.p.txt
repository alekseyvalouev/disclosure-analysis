Issues far larger than LDK.


LDK Solar Co. Ltd’s (NYSE Symbol: LDK) stock fell $20.10 to


$51.65 from yesterday’s intra-day high of $71.75. The


company has 111 million shares outstanding. LDK has lost


approximately $2.2 billion, 28%, of market value in two


trading days.


During today’s trading session Piper Je�rey issued a report


stating “LDK’s �nancial controller recently left the company;


some concerning allegations raised – may pressure stock


and reveal better entry point. Allegations from Former


Controller: We have con�rmed that the LDK �nancial


controller recently left the company. We are also aware of


the former controller’s allegations of poor �nancial controls


and a 250MT inventory discrepancy, allegations were made


to both the SEC and the external auditor KPMG. We have


spoken to the LDK CFO about these claims and have found


no reason/proof to dispute management’s claim of 100MT of


polysilicon in inventory/WIP. News of the departure may


pressure the stock near term.”


At December 31, 2006 LDK had $132.6 million in Inventories


and Prepayments to suppliers. These numbers were


included in the May 2007 prospectus for LDK’s Morgan


Stanley IPO. At June 30, 2007 LDK reported inventory and


prepayments to suppliers of $303.7 million. Su�ce to say


that LDK’s earnings are entirely dependent on the valuation

technique and accounting policies used to create these two


numbers.


The June 30th numbers were not �led as part of a customary


Form 10Q quarterly statement. They are found in two single


sheets attached to a August 1, 2007 press release. There is


no cash �ow statement, management’s discussion and


analysis of �nancial results or an o�cer’s certi�cation.


Apparently LDK plans to treat its shareholders similarly in


the third quarter.


LDK has been reporting far greater margins and lower


expense ratios than its established peers despite being


essentially a recent start-up. This is particularly alarming for


a company that buys the same commodity its peers buy,


converts the commodity and then sells it to the same market


using essentially the same processes. This clearly raises


questions of exactly where and how LDK di�erentiates itself


so dramatically from its peers.


Piper Je�rey claims to “have found no reason/proof to


dispute management’s claims” without any mention of how


well they looked. It also stated that the controversy may


reveal a “better entry point.” The recommendation contains


no discussion about a normalization of margins or write-


downs, or even a question about valuation.


Piper’s analyst rating is OUTPERFORM. I could be wrong but


does that mean the entry point Piper refers to is to short


LDK stock on a bounce?
