Apparent Connections To A Convicted Stock Promoter: Another
Chapter In The Organovo Saga
Apr. 1, 2015 12:46 PM ET164 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


We believe Organovo has ties to a convicted stock promoter named Howard Appel.


Howard Appel has allegedly been involved in numerous pump-and-dumps and
served prison time for securities fraud and money laundering in 2008.


Howard Appel is currently a person of interest in recent law enforcement actions.


We believe Howard Appel and his associates were top holders of ONVO before it
IPO’ed.


We believe ONVO is a compelling short.


Much has been written about Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) and its shortcomings. Richard
Pearson showed that Organovo's 3D liver tissue is not unique, that competitors are more
advanced than ONVO, and that the market opportunity for liver assays is incredibly small
("A Very Detailed Look At Organovo"). Another has highlighted Organovo's gross
overvaluation compared to peers and shown that ONVO should be valued at $2.09 per
share or less ("My View on Organovo (Over-)Valuation"). Lastly, highly-respected short
seller Citron detailed how it believes Organovo was the subject of a stock promotion from
a Japanese boiler room that sent the shares up in late 2013 ("Citron Issues URGENT
Trading Warning to the Public").


We view this fundamental material as quite negative, and company results since these
articles were published have done little to change our opinion.


Even though shares are down from the highs of last July, the market value of the stock is
more than $350 million for a company that in its last quarter lost $7 million on just
$160,000 of revenue. How does one keep a stock like this kited for so long?


In the course of our due diligence, we have discovered connections between Organovo
and a convicted felon who has been associated with numerous financial frauds and stock
promotions, and has served prison time for felony crimes. We are sharing our findings
here today.

Introducing Howard Appel, Convicted Felon


Who is Howard Appel? Howard Appel is a well-known stock promoter with a long history
of defrauding investors.


For the past quarter century, Howard Appel has been associated with numerous stock
promotions, share price manipulation schemes, and acts of securities fraud, some of
which are documented here (start at page 10) and here (start at page 18). Howard Appel's
infractions date from at least 1989 when Appel's brokerage firm, Bailey, Martin, and Appel,
was fined $50,000 and suspended by the National Association of Securities Dealers
("NASD") for stock manipulation (NASD Disciplinary Actions December 1989, see section
titled "NASD sanctions Bailey, Martin and Appel, Inc., of Philadelphia and four individuals
for artificial pricing and excessive markups in Northgate Industries Penny Stock"). In 1991,
Howard Appel was "barred from association with any member of the NASD in any
capacity." This was due to Appel's participation in another fraudulent scheme to sell
securities to public customers at unfair prices (NASD Disciplinary Actions August 1991,
see page 5 in the PDF).


Over the next 15 years, Appel was alleged to have taken part in numerous small cap stock
promotions, including Florida West Airlines (WSJ article here) and Net Value Holdings
(aka Stonepath Group) (link here). Howard Appel has also been closely associated with
failed companies like Eastwind Group, Commodore Holdings, VDC, Osage Systems,
Aviation Holding Group, and NAL Financial Group. Howard Appel's connections to these
companies are documented in the Net Value Holdings lawsuit (Start at "Panzo's
Relationship with Appel" linked here). In each of the companies, Appel was involved in
insider dealings and all of the companies either went bankrupt or later experienced severe
financial distress.


As the years progressed, Howard Appel's actions eventually led to his serving time in
prison. In 2004, Howard Appel was charged by the United States in the Eastern District of
New York with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money
laundering in relation to a stock manipulation scheme (United States v. Howard M. Appel,
Case No. 1:04-cr-00505-JG). Howard Appel pled guilty to both counts and was sentenced
to 1 year and 1 day in prison and 3 years of supervision. Appel served prison time from
June 2008 through April 2009.


Amazingly, he remains active today. He is currently under investigation by the New York
District Attorney for another stock promotion ("Subpoena Sought In Penny Stock Probe").
Appel is also currently the subject of a lawsuit concerning the Latitude Solutions

bankruptcy where he is alleged to have perpetrated another pump-and-dump scheme
(Amended Latitude Solutions Fraud Complaint).


It should be noted that all of the companies that we have identified as being associated
with Howard Appel have either defaulted, gone bankrupt, or experienced severe financial
distress.


Organovo's apparent link to Convicted Stock Fraud Promoter Howard Appel


We have reason to believe that Howard Appel was one of the key participants who
brought Organovo public notwithstanding the fact that his name is not found in the
company's SEC filings.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 4/42


In ONVO's S-1 Registration Statement from July 5, 2012 (see section "Selling Security
Holders"), DIT Equity Holdings is listed as ONVO's 4th largest shareholder.


There are no footnotes provided in the ONVO S-1 that show who ultimately controls DIT
Equity Holdings, LLC or any of the other non-individual holders.


The lack of footnotes to identify control persons of non-individual owners is unusual so we
went digging. We found that DIT Equity Holdings, LLC was listed as a top 10 shareholder
in the January 2014 S-1 for Matinas BioPharma Holdings (see section "Selling
Stockholders") (OTCQB:MTNB). A similarly named investor named DIT Equity Investors,
LLC is also listed as a top shareholder in Matinas. We think they're connected.


What is interesting about the Matinas S-1 is that it was prepared by the same investment
banker as those who prepared the ONVO S-1. And yet Matinas' S-1 contains the
footnotes that are standard to such documents, while the ONVO S-1 does not.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 5/42


Guess who owns DIT Equity Investors, LLC. The footnote states, "Howard Appel is a
natural person with voting and dispositive power over the shares held by DIT Equity
Investors, LLC."


So Howard Appel clearly controls DIT Equity Investors, LLC.


But what about DIT Equity Holdings, which is the entity that held shares in ONVO?


The footnote for DIT Equity Holdings, LLC states, "Kyung Won Lee is a natural person
with voting and dispositive power over the shares held by DIT Equity Holdings, LLC."


We looked up Kyung Won Lee and found that he is closely tied with Howard Appel
through two companies: Rms Advisors and Fac Enterprises, both of which are
incorporated in the state of Nevada.


Rms Advisors:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 6/42


Fac Enterprises:


We also found a reference to a similarly named DIT Equity Holdings, Inc in the Latitude
Solutions lawsuit(1) against, among others, Appel, that states, "DIT Equity Holdings, Inc.
is closely affiliated with and effectively controlled, either through ownership or managerial
or operational control or otherwise, by Appel."


We think the connection between Organovo and Howard Appel is clear, and believe there
is strong evidence to demonstrate that Appel has been involved with ONVO from early on
before it IPO'ed through DIT Equity Holdings, LLC.


More Howard Appel Connections


Furthermore, at least one known associate of Howard Appel was also a top shareholder of
ONVO. According to the S-1, FEQ Realty, LLC was the 11th largest shareholder in ONVO.
Again, the control person of FEQ Realty is not noted in the ONVO S-1. We were able to
find the owner of FEQ Realty through other SEC filings. As seen in Exhibit 2.2 of the
February 14, 2012 8-K filing by Rio Bravo Oil (OTCQB:RIOB), Ernest Bartlett is President
and Managing Member for FEQ Realty, LLC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 7/42


Ernest Bartlett's connection to FEQ Realty is further supported in Exhibit 10.3 of the May
4, 2012 8-K filing by Virtual Piggy (OTCQB:VPIG).


Ernest Bartlett has his own past of legal troubles. He was fined and permanently barred by
the NASD in 1989 (NASD Disciplinary Action September 1989, see page 6 in the PDF).


He was also sanctioned along with Appel in the 2013 Cease and Desist order by the
Arkansas Securities Department for violating various provisions of Arkansas Securities Act
related to the Bamco debenture default. In the 2015 Latitude Solutions lawsuit, Bartlett
was noted as being a close associate of Howard Appel. Bartlett's relationship with Appel
goes back to 1997 when both were co-defendants in a securities suit filed in California,
Pacific Aid Venture, et al v. Max E Bobbitt, et al.


Also important to note, Howard's sister Vicki Appel was 7.5% owner in VPIG before its
IPO through Capital Growth Trust, as seen in this footnoted 2008 S-1 filing (see section
"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners, Management, and Directors"). We
believe this shows how Howard Appel and his associates work through many different
entities.

We also note that VPIG, a company with its own sordid history, revealed in its 2014 10-K
filing (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings) last week that it had received a subpoena from the
SEC regarding unusual trading activity in VPIG's stock.


Together, FEQ Realty and DIT Equity Holdings held a combined 1.6 million shares of
ONVO, which would have made them the 3rd largest shareholder of ONVO pre-IPO. This
leads us to believe that Appel and Bartlett were involved together as major shareholders
in ONVO.


Lack of Shareholder Disclosure by ONVO


Lastly, we think it's interesting to note that Organovo did not disclose the names of the
beneficial owners of the entities listed as shareholders in its S-1. There wasn't a single
footnote explaining any of the holdings of ONVO's 189 pre-IPO shareholders. Identifying
the owners of pre-IPO shareholders, in addition to relationships between executive
officers and investors, is common practice.


We looked at a number of recent biotech IPOs; all of them disclosed the owners behind
the entities that held shares. We highlight two of them below.

We believe that these footnotes provide important information regarding potential conflicts
of interests, the nature of the shareholdings, and disclosure of the ultimate beneficiaries of
the shares.


We find it curious that Organovo did not disclose the ownership information. Perhaps it
was because it did not want to reveal an association with a convicted felon.


Conclusion: ONVO is a short


We are strong believers in the adage, "The fish rots from the head down." In Organovo's
case, we believe that we have found compelling evidence that it is closely associated with
Howard Appel as well as individuals associated with him who have also been indicted
and/or convicted for financial fraud. This just adds further evidence to us that Organovo is
a stock that should be avoided by buyers and shorted by sellers.
