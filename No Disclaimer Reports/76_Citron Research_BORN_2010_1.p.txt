CITRON RESEARCH
COVERS CHINA NEW
BORUN (BORN)- IS THIS
COMPANY ALL WET???


We are going to keep this sweet, simple and to the
point.  China New Borun (BORN) is a producer of
corn-based alcohol for baijiu liquor in China. 
Basically, the sell a commodity … nothing real sexy. 
In June of 2010 they lowered the pricing of their IPO
by a whopping 40% from initial estimates of $12-14
and sold 5.5 million shares at $7.  The stock
immediately broke syndicate and spent the
summer in the $5 range.


According to the company and its supporters, it is
not just your run-of-the-mill corn based alcohol
producer.  They have created a new mousetrap, a
secret sauce if you wish, called the “wet process”
which according to their prospectus, “has led to a
consistently higher yield of edible alcohol from
corn.  The Holy Grail of Baijiu.  This is the sizzle of
the company.


The “wet process” is so important to them that they
listed it in their prospectus as one of their top
competitive strengths:


“E�cient Production Technology” 
Our production management professionals
have independently developed the Borun Wet
Process for the production of edible alcohol.

Based upon our knowledge of our industry
and our ongoing patent application, we
believe that compared to the dry milling
process used by other producers in China, our
Borun Wet Process has a higher production
yield and consumes less energy and water
due to our higher degree of waste energy
recovery. Our wet process also enables us to
produce corn germ, which generates an
additional stream of revenue compared to
producers utilizing the dry milling process.

This advanced process must really be something! 
As a recent IBD article about BORN mentioned,


“Borun says its proprietary wet-process
production method consumes less energy and
water than the typical dry-milling process used
by other edible alcohol producers in China. It
also results in higher yields and generates
added revenue streams from byproducts.”

So we are told that BORN has basically
revolutionized the distilling business — in China! 
(Set aside for the moment that fermenting and
distilling of grain into alcohol is the world’s oldest
industrial process…)   How much did this cost
them?  Please read your prospectus, I swear we
could not make this up if we wanted to.


Research and Development


 
We spent approximately RMB79,200
($11,602.9), RMB120,000 ($17,580.1) and

RMB201,600 ($29,534.6) during the �scal
years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and
2009 and RMB150,400 ($22,034.0) during the
three months ended March 31, 2010,
respectively, on Company-sponsored
research and development activities,
including, without limitation, all activities in
respect of our in-house developed Borun Wet
Process, as determined in accordance with US
GAAP.


Yes, you read the correctly they have spent $80,000
US dollars in 3 1/4 years.  What could they have
really done? C’mon we believe that McDonalds
spent more than $80,000 deciding that Thousand
Island is the secret sauce on the Big Mac … and they
didn’t even need to apply for a patent.


Conclusion 
Yes, we can ask the obvious questions about
corporate structure and book value which are as
warped as many Chinse small cap names.    Not to
mention raising money at �re-sale discounted IPO
prices while supposedly having huge cash balances
in the bank.   We could discuss the apparent
discrepancies between tax documents �led in China
and SEC documents … but we will leave that for
another time and place.    In simple form, if you tell
Wall Street that your company should have a
premium because you have a better mousetrap,
and you want us to believe it, at least make sure
you spent some cheese to create it.
