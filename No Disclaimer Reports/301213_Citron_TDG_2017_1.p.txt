Could TransDigm be the Valeant of the 
Aerospace Industry? 





Wall Street:  Be Careful!  President Trump has become to 
Aerospace what Hillary was to Pharmaceuticals 





Congratulations to the 45
th


 President of the United States of America -- Donald Trump. 
 


President Trump has promised to end the long-standing, infuriating tradition of “sticking 
the US Government with tab”.  He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft 
a pillar of his transition into office.  
 


President Trump has already met with the both Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who have 
promised to lower the prices for Air Force One and the F-35 fighter jet program.  These 
lower prices will no doubt trickle down to subcontractors. 
 


While Boeing and Lockheed Martin have been the "poster children" of this policy 
initiative, everyone in the aerospace industry knows that one company stands out when 
it comes to egregious price increases foisted on the government:   
 


TRANSDIGM  (NYSE:TDG) 
 


TransDigm's business model is to aerospace as Valeant was to the pharmaceutical 
industry. TransDigm acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires 
employees, and egregiously raises prices.  This business model has made them a 
dominant supplier of airplane parts to the aerospace industry while burdening its 


balance sheet with sky-high debt load:  in fact, 6.5x EBITDA leverage.   
 


TransDigm’s single largest customer is the Department of Defense, followed by Boeing 
and Airbus. 
 


On December 12, then President-Elect Donald Trump told America: 
 





  Donald J. Trump  @realDonaldTrump  12 Dec 2016 
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and 
will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

NOTE:  Boeing and Lockheed gross margins are 13.6 % and 10.91% 
respectively. 
 


TransDigm boasts gross margins of 54.5% selling airplane parts to our 
government. 
 


But you can argue that Boeing and Lockheed are OEM's, while TransDigm is a parts 
supplier.  Fair point.  So next we compare TransDigm to its peer group.  This analysis 
shows how much of a gross outlier it has become with regard to the amount of money it 
is making off the U.S. government.

So how does TransDigm rack up such outsized margins??   
 


Citron has sifted through the Haystack Gold database,  the leading defense parts and 
logistics management system, reviewing historical prices of over 50,000 aircraft parts.  
The price differentials from pre-acquisition and post-acquisition, when TransDigm 
acquired their prior manufacturers, are there for all to see.

Citron acknowledges The Capitol Forum  for assembling just a small snapshot of the impacts of this game.  
 
The TransDigm business rests on the dangerous acquire/leverage/price-raise maneuver 
that has become too eerily familiar on Wall Street. After watching Valeant's stock go 
from 250 to 15, Wall Street learned a lesson about operating leverage.

So Where is TransDigm’s Stock With a bit of Scrutiny? 
 


Citron starts with Wall Street's consensus model for TransDigm. Using the 
analysts numbers who base their models on raising prices,  Citron gets to a 
valuation of $166 a share if they are merely pre-empted from further price 
raises … this has nothing to do with rolling back any prior ones.   
 


The ugly underbelly of TransDigm's business is that aggressive year-over-year price 
increases are the only thing shielding TransDigm from revealing negative organic growth 
of close to -10%.  Any combination of U.S. Government pressure and/or OEM's pressing 
on their own supply chains will expose their business to actual gross revenue 
contraction and a devastating cut in EPS, followed by multiple contraction. 
 


This Model Changes Nothing Except Zero Price Increases!

Consider this:  If TransDigm were to operate with the same EBIDTA 
margins as HEICO, their next closest competitor on EBITDA margin, which 
is still double that of the rest of their peer group, its EPS falls 85% and the 


stock is $40 a share.  We do not even project the margin compression 
that would be inflicted on TransDigm if, and when, they experience this 
type of pricing pressure.  That would tank the share price to even lower 
levels.

Citron adds that our commentary of "firing employees and raising prices" is not just 
Citron's narrative, but is also the subject of lawsuits of companies TransDigm has 
acquired.  Organic growth goes down, profits go up. TransDigm was sued in 2011 by the 
seller of Dukes Aerospace for raising prices, cutting head-count aggressively, and 
causing Dukes to get pushed out of programs that required future R&D.

How the Government Can Easily Crack Down on 
TransDigm 
 


The obvious response to this Citron criticism would be that the government can't do 
anything about TransDigm's pricing policies. If that were the case then why would 
Boeing and Lockheed BOTH agree to lower pricing in the context of just a single 
presidential meeting? 
 


The truth is that the government has already been down this road -- scrutinizing the 
price gouging perpetrated by TransDigm.  It now simply has to enforce what it already 
knows is wrong.  Just to show that the mechanism for a Government crackdown is 
already in place, here are excerpts from a Dept. of Defense Office of Inspector General 
audit in 2006:  
 


"In his lawsuit, Huffman said that unbeknownst to him, TransDigm pursues a 
financial strategy of slashing costs and increasing prices at acquisitions in order to 
increase profits on each sale and boost the stock price of the Cleveland aerospace 
company. 
 


"Because TransDigm is focused on margin and earnings growth, not revenue 
growth, it was a fraudulent inducement to plaintiffs to enter into an earn-out 
agreement with revenue growth as the measure," the lawsuit contends. " 


Note:  In the past 18 months, nothing has fundamentally changed for Valeant as a 
company, beyond a torrent of negative news coverage. Their pharmaceuticals are 
still sold worldwide. Bausch and Lomb is still the premiere name in eye care. What 
has really changed is the stock price. Wall Street is now forced to deal with the 
company’s inability to raise prices while being burdened with extreme debt levels.

For example, on contract SPO740-04-C-4647, the DSCC contracting 
officer purchased 578 oil pump assembly housings (NSN 2990-01-
259-0589) used on the F-15 fighter aircraft at a unit price of 
$3,663.36 in December 2003. The unit price for the item, in March 
2002, was $2,132.82; thus, the unit price increased 71.8 percent in 
21 months.  
... 
The Director also commented that supply chains have been asked to 
report on the suitability of reverse engineering TransDigm items.

TransDigm's Audit-Defeat Department at Work  
Here are some of the ways TransDigm thwarted this excessive cost audit.  
 


You have to ask yourself if these kinds of stonewalling tactics would work in the Twitter 
era, against the force of a fierce cost-cutter and bullshit-cutter-through-er.   
 


From the same audit report, we read:  
 


 
http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/FY06/06-055.pdf 





• TransDigm does not provide informal cost breakdowns or cost 
data for small purchases (2 instances).  


• TransDigm is unable to provide a cost breakdown for orders 
under $100,000 (2 instances).  


• TransDigm no longer offers cost breakdowns.  


• TransDigm does not provide cost data for purchases under 
$550,000.  


• TransDigm considers this item proprietary and commercial and 
will not provide any cost breakdown.  


• TransDigm accepts the Government counteroffer instead of 
providing a cost breakdown.  


• Due to the total dollar value of the request for quote, an informal 
cost breakdown cannot be prepared at this time. The prices quoted 
are based 16 on TransDigm’s current material costs, labor, 
overhead, and general and administrative rates, which have been 
audited by the U.S. Government.  


• TransDigm is unable to provide informal cost breakdowns due to 
limited accounting resources.  


• TransDigm’s quote is based on increases in material and labor 
costs. Material has escalated 12 percent while labor and overhead 
has increased close to 12 percent.  


• TransDigm did not respond to the request (6 instances).  


• TransDigm stated it is not the company’s policy to give cost data 
(2 instances).  


• TransDigm offered a lower unit price only if that price is found fair 
and reasonable by the contracting officer.

Citron asks if TransDigm investors riding the gravy train of highly leveraged profits based 
on a “price jacking” strategy even know the U.S. Office of Inspector General runs a 
"Department of Defense Hotline" for pricing complaints?  We think this entire report 
plus the spreadsheet attachments should make a good submission….we did it with 
Valeant.

   The TransDigm/Philidor Moment    
 


The easiest way for the government to encourage competitive bidding would be to audit 
the bidding process.  They will find how TransDigm has been able to use the guise of 
multiple shell distributors, who have no pricing power, to make a bid seem competitive 


when in reality they are all shills for TransDigm -- this will be addressed in 
future reports.   TransDigm has perfected the sole source model that understands 
government thresholds that avoid scrutiny- FOR NOW.

Every TransDigm investor should read the company's own disclosures from its 10-K.  
They are a chilling forecast of their inherent business vulnerability under an 
administration seeking to save money by creating better deals for the U.S. Government.  
Note from these disclosures, that the U.S. Government already has enormous power 
and leverage in its relationship with TransDigm:  
 





https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1260221/000126022116000107/tdg2016-09x3010xk.htm 





We are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment 


and services to the U.S. Government. 


Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. 


Government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. 


These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: 
 


• suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of 


procurement laws or regulations; 


•terminate existing contracts; 


•reduce the value of existing contracts; and 


•audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. 


On contracts for which the price is based on cost, the U.S. Government may review our 
costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on 
the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and 
fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing 
regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible 
assets, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may 
not be subject to reimbursement. 
 


Most of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government for its 
convenience without significant notice. Termination for convenience provisions provide 
only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on 
the work completed prior to termination. 
 


Furthermore, even where the price is not based on cost, the U.S. Government may seek to 
review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable.” Our 
subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review. Such a review could be costly and 
time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively 
manage the business. As a result of such a review, we could be subject to providing a 
refund to the U.S. Government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby 
our prices would be based on cost or the DOD could seek to pursue alternative sources of 
supply for our parts. Any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue 
from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and 
buying organizations of the U.S. Government. 
 


Moreover, U.S. Government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional 
operation requirements, which do not apply to entities not engaged in government 


contracting. Failure to comply with such government contracting requirements 
could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s results of operations.

There are other important macro headwinds facing TransDigm that are evident today 
These are some but not all of the issues: 


 TransDigm’s profitability will be severely impacted by high-profile supply 
initiatives by Boeing (Partnering for Success) and Airbus (SCOPe+).   


 The emergence of PMA (Parts Manufacturing Authorization) - allows for the 
approval and manufacturing of “generic” parts, which can be 40%-80% cheaper 
than the OEM after-market parts. 


 TransDigm will have difficulty finding larger acquisitions that they need to 
materially impact revenue growth (A key Valeant dilemma) 


 Their product mix is overly dependent of older airplane platforms that are at risk 
of being retired  





    Conclusion  
 
President Trump:  Do you know when your 757 plane “Air Trump” is down for a day and 
you wondered why a replacement air filter, valve, pump or coffee maker cost $20,000?  
The reason was TransDigm.   
 
While you are looking to Boeing and Lockheed, the easiest way to drain the swamp in 
the aerospace industry can be relegated to shine some sunlight on:  TransDigm.
