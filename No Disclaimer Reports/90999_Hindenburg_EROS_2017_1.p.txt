Summary: Eros International (NYSE:E�OS)
Eros claims to be “well-capitalized” yet plans a shelf o�ering. The company also sold


shares of its key Indian operating subsidiary the very day of its earnings release.


The company reiterated a claim from early April that it is in advanced stages of


negotiations for a debt re�nancing deal, yet it still has no deal in place.


The company is facing spiking �nancing costs which are +463.6% q/q; Short-term debt


and contractual obligations due within one year stand at $262 million.


Past accounting questions appear to have intensi�ed.


Eros announced a near doubling of its content library, yet we �nd zero CY 2017 movies


“Recently Added” to its ErosNow website.

Eros Earnings Review: An Abundance Of

Much of the market seemed focused on Eros’s top line and bottom line miss and how the


results tarnished the company’s growth story. Despite those important takeaways, we believe


the full story is signi�cantly worse.


Asset Sales and a Potential Shelf O�ering Spell
More Liquidity Issues


A key bullet point from the earnings release (http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?


c=201012&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2289848) focused on Eros’s supposedly strong capitalization:


Not including the $40 million set aside for the (revolving credit facility), Eros has over


$112 million of cash on balance sheet, availability under existing lines of credit and


access to capital markets and the company remains well-capitalized and able to


invest in future growth.


Despite the self-proclaimed clean bill of health, the company’s actions, subsequent statements,


and reported debt and o�-balance-sheet obligations seem to con�ict with the notion that the


company is adequately capitalized. In particular, the company suggested it is seeking more


capitalization options. In the earnings release, it stated:


…we are in advanced stages of negotiations for a debt re�nancing deal as well as


expect to �le a shelf for a potential capital raise soon after this earnings.


We can’t help but notice that in early April


(http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170403005724/en/Eros-International-Extends-


Revolving-Credit-Facility), the company similarly stated it was “in advanced stages of executing


multiple long-term re�nancing options” after a failed bond o�ering


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-31/bollywood-�lmmaker-said-to-win-debt-


reprieve-after-failed-deal) and a temporary extension of its revolving credit facility. With debt


maturities looming and without a �nalized deal in place, we believe the company is short on


time and short on options.


Even more telling, the aforementioned equity and re�nancing alternatives are being explored


despite the company’s rapid selling of shares in its key Indian operating subsidiary, Eros


International Media Limited (EIML). The most recent sale of EIML shares occurred the very

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
same day of the annual release, July 28th, suggesting a current and ongoing need for liquidity.


Based on Eros’s recent share disposition �ling (http://www.bseindia.com/xml-


data/corp�ling/AttachHis/879D32D6_10C3_48BF_8EB6_A7D549E9320F_092438.pdf) with the


BSE and recent sales reported to the NSE


(https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/bulk.htm)/BSE


(http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/stockreach_insidertrade_new.aspx?


scripcode=533261&expandable=2), Eros owns approximately 45.32% of unencumbered shares


in EIML and has pledged but retained voting rights over another 16.20% of the company. This


compares to the company’s last annual release


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152016000992/ex8-1.htm) where it


reported a 74.4% unencumbered stake in the operating subsidiary. It is unclear whether these


sales and share pledges are expected to continue.


If the above weren’t troubling enough, the maturity wall of debt and short-term contractual


obligations suggests a high need for near-term capital:


The company’s $85 million revolver is due September 30 . Eros stated that it has “set


aside approximately $40 million to pay (the RCF) down further”.


Eros’s total short-term debt stands at over $180 million.


Eros’s unrecorded contractual obligations due in “less than 1 year” stand at $81.2 million,


with total unrecorded contractual obligations of $292.9 million.


Eros’s “trade and other payables” increased by over 84% to $120.1 million from $65.2


million in the preceding year, suggesting a signi�cant near-term liquidity burden payable


to the company’s suppliers.


In short, the company exhibits signs of an ever-tightening liquidity situation with no clear


solution in hand.


Spiking Financing Costs


The e�ects of this liquidity situation have also seemed to manifest in the form of increased


�nancing costs. From the company’s most recent �ling:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net �nance costs increased by 463.6%


$6.2 million (sic), compared to $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31,


2017. In �scal 2017, net �nance costs increased by 115.0% to $17.2 million, compared


to $8 million in �scal 2016, mainly due to lower income from �nancing activities and


increased borrowing costs.


Part of the increase in �nancing costs can be explained by new debt, such as a new senior


Term Loan secured by a pledge of shares of EIML, carrying an interest rate of 13-14.25%. In


other cases, we see that pre-existing debt has been renegotiated at higher rates. For example,


in this release, we learned for the �rst time that the interest rate on the revolving credit facility


has moved signi�cantly higher to “LIBOR + 7.5% and Mandatory Cost” compared to a rate of


“LIBOR + 1.90% – 2.90% and Mandatory Cost” in the previously reported period.


Such “tightening screws” are indicative of the rising costs and stricter covenant terms that


generally result from pushing out maturities to try and buy a company more time to pay o� its


debts. We intend to carefully monitor for any new debt issuance or repayments at the


company and its subsidiaries as the debt scenario evolves over time.


Eros Television: A New Related Party Emerges


The latest �ling discloses that Eros received a $6.4m short-term loan from Eros Television,


which is cited as a “related party”. We �nd it odd that Eros Television sits outside the Eros


corporate structure. Per Indian �lings, Eros Television is a subsidiary of Eros Energy Singapore


Pte Ltd:

Eros Energy Singapore has multiple subsidiaries that all appear to be related to the energy


space, except for Eros Television. Per Eros Television’s Directors Report


(http://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/20161122-directors-report) dated November


2016, we see that the entity generates 100% of its sales from the “Media and Entertainment


Industry”, making it an apparent anomaly in the Eros Energy corporate structure:

advances, per the Eros Television audit report

2016:

If the above wasn’t odd enough, perhaps the greatest indication of potential irregularity is that


Eros derives a substantial portion of its revenue through television syndication. Per the annual


release, revenues from television syndication were a rare bright spot in the company’s results,


representing a year-over-year increase of 22.1% to $88.0 million from $72.1 million from the


year prior.


Until recently it was not even clear to us that Eros insiders controlled a related-party television


business that sits outside the Eros corporate structure. We would be very interested to know


the amount, if any, of the television syndication revenue that Eros generates from dealings with


related-party Eros Television.


Questionable Revenue, Again


The company reported a severe drop in revenues in India, Europe, and North America. Despite


these across-the-board declines, the “Rest of the World” segment revenues increased


substantially; an increase of over 56% on a year-over-year basis:


The explanation provided by the company for the leap in RoW revenues is as follows:


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
…mainly due to decreased theatrical revenues from the �lm mix o�set by increased


catalogue revenues and accelerated catching up on sales held back in the


second half of �scal 2016.


For some context, the company was previously faced with questions about its historically large


Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) metric that, in part, stemmed from uncollected “high margin”


catalogue revenue. The company responded in FY 2016


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152016000992/eps6885.htm) by


deciding to “forego a portion of its potential catalogue revenues that have relatively longer


payment cycles, in order to improve days’ sales outstanding.”


As noted by research boutique GeoInvesting (https://geoinvesting.com/eros-whistle-blower-


eros-potential-fraud/), that explanation appears to defy common sense. High margin sales are


the best kind of sales. Choosing to forego high margin business as a means of temporarily


improving a balance sheet metric seems to be nonsensical.


We �nd the language in this release on “accelerated catching up on sales held back” to be


similarly bizarre. It appears as if the company can simply turn on and o� its “high margin”


catalogue sales at will. We �nd it curious that these sales seem to take place with such �uidity


and that they appear heavily in the “Rest of the World” segment; the least speci�c customer


category consisting of largely opaque jurisdictions.


Notably, the company also claims in the most recent March quarter to have generated over


60% of its total revenue in “Rest of the world”.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/31/912443-15014768052302713_origin.png)


Again, as noted by the folks at GeoInvesting, India has 1.25 billion citizens while there are only


an estimated 16 million total Indian ex-pats living abroad across all regions. While Bollywood


entertainment can certainly have appeal with anyone, one would think that such appeal may

apply at least somewhat proportionately across one or several other regions of the world such


as Europe and North America. Instead, we are led to believe that growth is shrinking in India,


Europe, and North America, while exploding elsewhere.


Questionable Receivables, Again


The company’s trade receivables balance increased to $226.8 million from $169.3 million from


a year ago, again due largely to “signi�cantly higher catalogue sales”.


Using the updated trade receivables balance and the annual revenue number, we calculate a


DSO of 327 days. That metric is extremely high by any measure, but we believe the ex-India


DSO to actually be much worse.


Eros’s key Indian subsidiary (EIML) had a DSO of approximately 97 days in its last fully reported


�scal year. Given that India accounts for a substantial proportion of the company’s total


revenue and has skewed the overall DSO downward, we can surmise that the DSO on revenue


coming from outside India is likely signi�cantly higher than 327 days. The implication is that


Rest of the World sales seem to be particularly troublesome to collect on. We wonder why.


The company’s release added that it collected over $25 million of �scal 2017 trade receivables


post balance sheet. While this was touted as an accomplishment, we view collection of only


11% of the previously outstanding trade receivables in the roughly four-month interim period


as a reinforcement of the company’s continued collection issues.


Eros’s Movie Library


In the annual release �led on Friday, the company announced that “Eros’ library for digital �lm


rights stands at over 10,000 �lms.” According to conference call transcripts


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4091897-eros-internationals-eros-ceo-jyoti-deshpande-q4-


2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single), CFO Prem Parameswaran stated, “By the end


of the �scal year we had added 5,000 digital titles to the roster of �lms available on ErosNow.”


We �nd the new 10,000 metric to be somewhat confounding. On the ErosNow website


(http://erosnow.com/playlist/1006864/recently-added), there are zero “Recently Added” movies


for calendar year 2017 and only 22 movies for calendar year 2016 as of this writing. Similarly,


we checked every genre category (http://erosnow.com/movies/genres) and found zero movies


for calendar year 2017 and only 36 movies for calendar year 2016. We wonder, how old are the


5,000 additional digital titles and where can they be found?

http://erosnow.com/movies/genres

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The apparent doubling of the company’s �lm library also occurred despite its “intangible asset-


content” line item only increasing by 13.8% from the previous year ($904.6m from $795.1m).


Similarly, the company’s cash �ow line item for “Purchase of intangible �lm rights and content


rights” dropped 17.8% on a y/y basis, to $173.5 million from $211.3 million.


We have a hard time understanding how the company nearly doubled its library while


seemingly failing to update its ErosNow o�ering with meaningful 2017 and 2016 content, failing


to record a signi�cant increase in the value of content assets, and failing to spend a


commensurate amount on the new library titles. We seek clari�cation on speci�cally what was


purchased.


What is the Story with the Movie Slate?


The MD&A section of the earnings release attempted to address various liquidity-related


concerns by discussing the �nancial strength of the company. One statement in that section


suggested that a large amount of money had been invested in the �lm slate. Speci�cally:


Over $200 million is already invested in the ongoing slate.


The implication seemed to be that the initial outlay could mitigate the company’s near-term


cash demands and give the company a chance to harvest its past investment.


Despite the stated $200 million past investment, the conference call transcript sent a


potentially con�icting message; the company acknowledged that the �lm slate would be


“quieter” for the next two quarters and that it had not “thrown money to buy” an external slate.


Rather, it claimed to be developing movies in-house, which would take longer:


The �rst two quarters will be quieter, because this is a self built up slate and not really


something that we have just thrown money to buy. So the �rst two quarters will be


quieter than the – it will be more back ended.


On the same call, the company suggested that the slate was not fully funded and still ramping


up:


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We are targeting pending $200 million to $225 million this year on new contents as


we ramp the slate and continue to bulk up our digital content o�ering.


In other words, although a supposed $200 million had already invested in the ongoing slate,


the company expects to put another $200 million to $225 million in this year. Given all of the


past and planned investment, one might expect the outcome to be an aggressive roll-out of a


large slate. Instead, we are told the outcome is a quiet couple of quarters and promises of a full


slate in the latter half of the year and in the future.


ErosNow or ErosNever?


We are placing ErosNow at the bottom of this piece because we believe that placement


corresponds most accurately to its relevance at this time. ErosNow’s paying subscribers were


announced as being “tripled” over the course of the year; a sensational headline. When pressed


for speci�cs on revenue and cash �ow on the conference call, however, CFO Parameswaran


noted that ErosNow had generated only $14 million in revenue for the entire FY 2017.


ErosNow, therefore, represents only about 5.5% of reported FY 2017 revenue.


Despite the limited top-line contribution, the company noted that “nearly 50%” of the digital


�lm rights are owned in perpetuity, in an apparent e�ort to reinforce the long-term value of


ErosNow and the content library. In the company’s 20-F �ling, we �nd a more optimistic


version, that “over 50%” of the library is held in perpetuity. We seek clari�cation on exactly what


proportion of the company’s digital rights are owned in perpetuity.


Perhaps the confusion arises due to the recent large increase in the company’s perpetual


library. From the company’s 20-F �ling, the company states:


We have acquired most of our �lm content through �xed term contracts with


third parties, which may be subject to expiration or early termination. We own


the rights to the rest of our �lm content as co-producers or sole producer of those


�lms.


In other words, if Eros produced or co-produced the �lm, it owns the rights in perpetuity.


Otherwise, the rights may expire on a �xed term. The acquired content accounts for “most” of


its �lm content.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
From the company’s previous 2016 20-F �ling, we see that a substantial proportion of the


content expired prior to 2020:


From the company’s latest 2017 20-F �ling, we see a very di�erent picture:


Now, we �nd that Eros’s perpetual �lm content has increased markedly in the “Regional


Language Films” category, jumping from 31% last year to 55% this year. Regional �lms also


comprised a greater proportion of the total library, increasing to 65% from 57% a year earlier.


We would be interested to hear from management how the stated addition of 5,000 titles at


seemingly low relative cost managed to achieve such a substantial altering of the library


expiration dates.


Conclusion


We have numerous accumulated questions about Eros, and frankly, we are past the point of


having con�dence that they will be adequately answered. We believe Eros’s issues could be


terminal for the public listed company within 3-6 months, if not sooner. We believe the


combination of (i) hard-to-explain accounting questions (ii) short-term borrowings coming due


(iii) spiking �nancing costs (iv) sales of key assets (v) worsening top and bottom line metrics,


and (vi) a tarnished story all continue to make Eros a ticking time bomb for investors.
