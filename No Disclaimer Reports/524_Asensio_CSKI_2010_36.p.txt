Auditor Sued for Securities Fraud in Preparation
of CSKI Financial Statements


Posted on March 9, 2010 by Asensio.com


A private investor has filed a lawsuit against the auditor of China


Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI), alleging “fraudulent


misconduct” and violation of securities laws for failing to correct


CSKI’s “materially false” financial statements. Click here for a copy


of the complaint.


The complaint states, “…MSPC became aware of the fact that the
CSKI Financial Statements were materially false and misleading


and its unqualified opinion with respect to them was baseless.


Despite becoming aware of these problems, and despite having a


duty to correct the information that it knew to be false which had


been disseminated into the market via the 10-K, MSPC failed to issue


corrected statements or withdraw its support from the CSKI


Financial Statements.”


CSKI’s auditor, Moore Stephens, P.C., has been the subject of a


previous asensio.com report, which details the involvement of the


firm in the First Jersey Securities scandal in the 1990’s. The SEC


censured Moore Stephens and one of its current principals in 1999.


The complaint against Moore Stephens provides evidence of


material inaccuracies in CSKI’s audited financial statements,


specifically concerning patent claims. CSKI’s 2008 10-K claims that


CSKI holds seven patents. The 10-K’s audited financial statements


show CSKI’s patents having a value of $15,093,718 at December 31,


2008. A year earlier, on December 31, 2007, the patents’ value was


only $1,599,814, according to the 10-K. The list of patents provided


in the 10-K entail items such as “bag design patent,” “box design


patent,” and “Endothelin-1 patent relating to anti-tumor


technology.”

An investigation by a Chinese law firm found that there was only


one valid patent registered for CSKI or any of its subsidiaries,


according to a report prepared by the firm dated February 10, 2010


and attached to the complaint. The patent is for a box design and


belongs to Heilongjiang Tianlong Pharmaceutical (“Tianlong”), a


company which CSKI acquired on April 3, 2008, according to CSKI’s


10-K. The application date for the Tianlong patent is April 2, 2008,


which was the day before the reported closing date on CSKI’s


acquisition of Tianlong, and the application was not granted until


April 2009.


The report notes that there is a record of a patent application made


by Harbin Tian Di Ren Medical Science and Technology Co., CSKI’s


main operating subsidiary. The application was made in 2004, but


has not been approved. The report states, “[W]e expect this


application is abandoned or is still pending.”


The complaint concludes, “…the CSKI Financial Statements were
inaccurate in several material respects, including the fact that they


reported that CSKI or its subsidiaries owned seven patents in China


supposedly worth $15,093,718, when in fact it did not own any


patents. As a result of this material misstatement, the assets of CSKI


were substantially overstated in the 10-K.”


According to the complaint, the plaintiff in the case sent a copy of


the Chinese law firm’s investigation report to Moore Stephens and


asked the firm to revise its unqualified opinion in CSKI’s 2008 10-K.


The complaint states, “To date, MSPC has not responded to this


request, either privately or publicly, nor has it taken any action to


inform the public of its flawed opinion and of the fact that the CSKI


Financial Statements are materially false and misleading.”
