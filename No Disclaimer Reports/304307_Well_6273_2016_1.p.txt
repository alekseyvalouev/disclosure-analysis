SMC	(6273):	


Puncturing	the	Myth			 	 	 	 	 	
	


Strong	Sell	
Target	Price:	JPY4,484	-	JPY15,145	(51%-85%	downside)	


	
	
Abstract	
o We	 believe	 SMC's	 cash	 balances	 to	 be	 substantially	 less	 than	 the	 company	


claims.	
o Exploiting	 intracompany	 trading	 between	 consolidated	 and	 unconsolidated	


subsidiaries,	 and	 undisclosed	 related	 party	 transactions	 among	 other	
questionable	accounting	techniques	SMC's	has	not	only	masked	the	true	status	
of	 its	 inventory	and	cash	balances	but	also	concealed	evidence	of	deteriorating	
business	fundamentals.		


o We	have	uncovered	evidence	in	several	SMC	subsidiaries	of	conflicts	of	interest,	
related	 party	 transactions	 and	 extremely	 questionable	 accounting	 practices,	
which	we	believe	to	be	just	the	tip	of	the	iceberg.	


o We	expect	massive	write-downs	on	SMC	inventory	as	a	result.	
o We	question	SMC's	margins	in	Japan,	which	we	believe	to	be	far	lower	than	what	


the	company	reports.	
o SMC’s	use	of	a	small	auditor,	with	a	history	of	fraudulent	clients,	underscores	our	


belief	that	SMC’s	audited	financials	cannot	be	relied	upon.		
o Additionally,	 SMC's	 chairman	 has	 pledged	 most	 (if	 not	 all)	 of	 his	 shares	 as	


collateral	to	Resona	Bank.	
o Strict	 centralized	 control	 and	 a	 problematic	 corporate	 culture	 has	 allowed	 this	


activity	to	go	on	unreported	for	years.

Summary	
	


“Shareholder	and	Investor	Understanding	and	Support		
	
We	will	strive	to	promote	fair	and	transparent	business	management,	and	disclose	
necessary	corporate	information	timely	and	appropriately	unless	otherwise	
restricted	by	laws	to	obtain	understanding	and	support	from	our	shareholders	and	
investors.”	
	
SMC	Group	Principles	of	Corporate	Activities2	Section	3	


	
	
SMC	Corporation	(6273:JP),	is	a	JPY2tn	market	cap	company,	which	manufactures	
pneumatic	control	equipment	for	factory	automation.	We	believe	SMC	Corp	has	
‘fake’	cash	and	dramatically	overvalued	inventory	on	its	balance	sheet	as	a	result	of	
inflated	margins	if	not	other	undisclosed	losses.	These	questionable	accounts	have	
been	enabled	by	the	severe	lack	of	oversight	from	their	tiny	audit	firm,	Seiyo,	who	
has	been	auditing	SMC’s	accounts	since	the	industrial	firm’s	IPO	in	1987.	We	note	
that	SMC	Chairman	Takada	and	friends	have	pledged	over	100	billion	yen	of	their	
stock	to	Resona	Bank	for	loans	for	unclear	purposes.	We	rate	the	stock	a	strong	sell	
with	maximum	downside	of	85%,	which	would	be	equivalent	to	4,484	yen.	
	
We	strongly	encourage	additional	existing	and	former	employees,	suppliers,	
contractors	or	customers	who	have	concerns	about	misconduct	at	the	company	to	
raise	their	concerns	with	either	the	authorities	in	their	respective	countries,	the	
media	or	Well	Investments	Research	in	order	to	improve	transparency	and	corporate	
governance.	We	are	happy	to	assist	you	in	that	process.	Our	contact	details	are	on	
our	home	page3.	
	
History	of	Fraudulent	Clients	at	Auditor	means	SMC’s	audit	cannot	be	relied	upon	


	
• SMC	claims	to	have	revenue	of	over	JPY462bn,	72	subsidiaries	across	the	


globe	and	more	than	18,000	employees.	SMC	expects	shareholders	to	believe	
Seiyo	Audit	Corporation	is	able	to	conduct	an	effective	audit	on	the	
company.	Yet	not	only	is	Seiyo	a	tiny	Tokyo	firm	which	until	July	2016	had	
just	16	certified	public	accountants,	but	some	of	its	accountants	also	have	a	
checkered	history	of	auditing	companies	that	have	committed	fraud.	


• Seiyo	appears	to	have	a	complete	lack	of	independence	from	SMC;	it	
operates	out	of	the	same	small	office	building	as	SMC	subsidiaries	and	the	
first	four	digits	of	Seiyo’s	phone	number	–	6273	–	even	match	SMC’s	stock	
ticker!

• SMC,	in	theory,	could	easily	have	hired	a	global	Big	Four	auditor	to	audit	all	of	
its	subsidiaries.	Instead	it	has	appointed	very	small	local	auditors	in	almost	
every	jurisdiction	we	checked.	This	further	raises	the	scope	for	abuse	of	its	
accounts.	


• SMC	subsidiaries	change	auditors	every	couple	of	years,	which	is	in	itself	a	
red	flag.	When	SMC	installed	“reputable	auditors,”	such	as	Baker	Tilly	at	its	
UK	subsidiary	in	2012,	the	auditor	found	“material	errors”	in	accounts	that	
were	completed	by	their	predecessor,	a	small	audit	firm	ECL.	Yet	somehow	
ECL	was	later	reinstated	as	the	auditor	for	SMC’s	UK	entity.	


• Many	subsidiaries’	accounts	contain	restatements	and	transfer-pricing	errors,	
which	further	underscore	doubts	that	Seiyo	is	in	any	position	to	audit	reliably	
SMC’s	accounts.	
	


Questionable	large	share	pledge	gives	incentive	to	falsify	accounts	


	
• SMC	chairman	Yoshiyuki	Takada	holds	his	SMC	stake	in	a	variety	of	vehicles,	


including	TON	Finance,	a	Dutch	investment	entity	that	owns	5.11%	of	SMC.	
According	to	Dutch	regulatory	filings,	all	of	the	shares	held	by	TON	have	been	
pledged	to	Resona	Bank4,	SMC’s	main	bank.	This	is	equivalent	to	approx.	
JPY110bn	in	collateralized	shares	yet	these	loans	strangely	do	not	appear	on	
TON	Finance’s	balance	sheet.	


• Pledging	shares	incentivizes	management	to	fraudulently	increase	the	stock	
price	in	order	to	avoid	margin	calls	on	the	value	of	the	loans	they	have	taken.		


• Moreover,	we	have	found	TON	Finance’s	Dutch	filings	contradict	Japanese	
disclosure	and	raise	further	questions	over	the	nature	of	these	pledges.	


	
We	believe	cash	position	is	a	lie	


	
• At	least	JPY81.7bn	of	cash	might	not	exist.	Using	2014	as	the	base	year	with	


the	most	disclosure,	we	identified	the	cash	balances	of	almost	all	SMC	major	
subsidiaries	and	yet	we	could	not	account	for	JPY81.7bn	in	cash,	almost	25%	
of	SMC’s	total	cash.	


• In	2014,	interest	income	at	SMC’s	Chinese	subsidiaries	and	the	Japanese	
parent	were	higher	than	that	claimed	for	the	entire	group.	If	the	Chinese	and	
Japanese	accounts	are	accurate,	then	either	the	rest	of	SMC’s	cash,	~	JPY190	
billion,	is	being	deposited	at	significantly	negative	rates	or	the	cash	simply	
does	not	exist.

http://www.kabupro.jp/edp/20090128/S0002B8M.pdf

• We	are	suspicious	of	the	JPY49.4bn	cash	held	at	SMC	Manufacturing	
Singapore	where	the	Company	Secretary	is	married	to	a	partner	at	the	
auditing	firm	RT	LLP	(until	2016)	and	the	audit	is	completed	within	10	to	13	
days	from	the	year	end.	The	same	audit	firm	generally	takes	two	to	three	
MONTHS	from	year	end	with	the	audits	of	its	other	clients.		


• There	is	no	way	to	ascertain	the	cash	balance	at	SMC	Japan,	but	with	auditors	
like	Seiyo	there	is	a	real	possibility	that	this	amount	is	inflated.	


	
SMC	is	hiding	inventory	write-downs	


	
• We	think	around	JPY55bn	of	inventory	write-downs	should	be	expected.	SMC	


retains	an	extraordinary	high	amount	of	inventory	compared	with	peers.	
Analysts	seem	convinced	by	SMC’s	explanation	that	it	maintains	the	
inventory	to	provide	any	machine	part	a	client	requests	no	matter	how	old	
the	machine.	However,	interviews	with	former	employees	and	a	review	of	
subsidiary	accounts	indicate	that	between	10-53%	of	inventory	should	be	
written	down,	which	would	amount	to	between	JPY19bn	and	JPY91bn.			
	


Too-good-to-be-true	margins	in	Japan	


	
• The	primary	driver	of	SMC’s	profitability	has	been	an	incredible	40%	rise	in	


the	Japanese	business'	operating	margin	since	2013.	Given	sales	prices	have	
been	decreasing	roughly	2%	a	year	-	based	on	SMC’s	own	statements	-	it	is	
perplexing	for	competitors	and	other	observers	how	SMC	has	managed	to	
achieve	this.	


	
Playing	games	with	Payables?	





• Further	questions	are	raised	by	SMC’s	payables	of	over	USD550mn;	the	vast	
majority	of	which	were	to	Resona	Kessai,	a	factoring	company	owned	by	
Resona,	when	SMC	last	disclosed	its	payables	breakdown	in	Japanese	back	in	
2013.	We	are	skeptical	any	supplier	would	factor	their	receivables	at	a	
discount	when	SMC	purports	to	pay	them	within	20	to	70	days.		


	
	
Unconsolidated	subsidiaries	allow	for	potential	abuses	


	
• SMC	consolidates	just	46%	of	its	subsidiaries	by	claiming	the	remainder	are	


immaterial.	This	large	swathe	of	non-consolidated	subsidiaries	could	allow	
SMC	to	book	sales	to	non-consolidated	subsidiaries	as	revenue	or	use	these	
entities	to	hide	losses	and/or	debt.	The	scale	of	this	non-consolidation	is	
unique	to	SMC	and	at	best	highly	aggressive.
6	


	
Nepotism	and	centralized	control	can	enable	management	to	commit	fraud	


	
• SMC	has	a	culture	of	nepotism	and	its	90-something	chairman	exhibits	a	


dictatorial	management	style	where	other	opinions	are	not	welcome.	
• Shareholders	should	be	very	worried	that	Yoshiki	Takada,	the	chairman’s	son	


and	president	of	SMC	Corp.	of	America,	will	take	over	from	his	father	as	our	
research	in	the	Americas	suggest	the	business	there	is	on	the	cusp	of	a	major	
structural	decline.	


• Based	on	interviews	with	former	employees	and	competitors	in	the	US,	we	
understand	Yoshiki	Takada	has	employed	and	elevated	friends	and	family	to	
executive	roles	in	the	company.	We	understand	that	without	subsidies	from	
Japan,	SMC	USA	would	be	unprofitable	and	that	unqualified	management	has	
alienated	the	US	sales	force	leading	to	an	exodus	of	their	best	sales	staff.	
Market	participants	expect	SMC	USA	market	share	to	suffer.		


	
Undisclosed	related	party	transactions	


	
• There	are	a	number	of	SMC	entities	in	Europe	which	are	not	owned	by	SMC	


but	by	Sjoerd	Nauta,	a	long-time	business	associate	of	the	chairman.	These	
entities	work	directly	with	SMC	subsidiaries	and	co-own	the	European	Central	
Warehouse,	which	creates	further	room	for	abuse.	Under	Japanese	law,	
related	party	transactions	must	be	disclosed.		


	
We	believe	stock	price	should	fall	by	85%	at	maximum	


	
• We	believe	once	SMC	appoints	a	reputable	audit	firm	with	global	reach,	


there	will	be	significant	material	restatements	to	its	accounts	and	it	is	highly	
likely	the	TSE	will	designate	SMC	as	a	“security	on	alert”	with	the	potential	
for	delisting.	


• Stock	prices	of	Japanese	companies	where	significant	accounting	problems	
have	been	uncovered	have	typically	fallen	precipitously	in	the	wake	of	a	
scandal.	We	believe	a	similar	fate	awaits	SMC	and	think	85%	downside	at	
maximum	is	appropriate.

Full Discussion 
 
 
SEIYO 
SMC has used the same external auditor since the group listed in 1987, a 
small local Tokyo firm called Seiyo Auditing Corporation (“Seiyo” and 
formerly known O.Yu). As demonstrated below, Seiyo does not have the 
adequate capacity or skill to give an opinion that SMC’s financial statements 
are presented fairly in all material aspects and most certainly appears to 
lack any independence from SMC. 
 
Until February 2011, Seiyo’s  predecessor was O.Yu Kyodo (gECH7D]), 
but virtually rebranded as Seiyo5 following an accounting fraud at a client. 
Moreover, this was not an isolated incident as Seiyo has had associations 
with other listed companies with accounting issues. Until its merger in July 
2016, Seiyo had just 16 certified public accounts and just 13 listed clients. 
	





 
 
Outside of SMC, Seiyo has no large listed clients of note with Seiyo’s next 
largest listed client being ASKA Pharmaceutical (4514:JP) with a market 
capitalization of just approx. JPY5bn (less than 3.0% of SMC’s!). Moreover, 
while SMC’s annual audit fee of JPY58mn is roughly twice that of Seiyo’s 
other listed audit clients, SMC’s revenue is on average 13x larger and 
market cap is ~140x larger with close to 9x more group entities than the 
other publicly traded clients.  
																																																								
5	For	examples,	http://www.kk-takachiho.jp/investor/docs/20110513idou.pdf	


and	http://ke.kabupro.jp/tsp/20110215/140120110215037114.pdf
8	


 
Thus, the fee seems extremely low given SMC’s scale and complexity, which 
casts doubt on how much audit work Seiyo is actually performing.   
In fact, SMC disclosure clearly states Seiyo does NOT audit its major 
consolidated subsidiaries; this is troubling as a number of SMC’s major 
consolidated subsidiaries are audited by other small local auditors with 
some audited by firm’s who are clearly conflicted, as is the case with SMC 
Manufacturing Singapore. 
 
What Seiyo does seem to have in abundance though is association with 
companies tarnished by accounting issues, especially those involving related 
party transactions; and suspect overseas transactions and cash balances. 
	


 
FOI 
FOI Corp. was a semiconductor production equipment company that listed 
on the start-up TSE Mothers market in November 2009. Within less than six 
months of its IPO it was suspended from trading after it was found to have 
grossly overstated sales. FOI claimed to have booked 11.9bn yen in revenue 
for the twelve-months ending March 2009, when in reality sales were just 
200mn yen6! 
 
It did this by overstating overseas income – FOI booked fictitious sales to 
overseas manufacturers then used loans from overseas banks at the end of 
each period to give the impression money had been collected. The auditors 
for FOI were… Seiyo, or O.Yu as it was then known. As the transactions 
were overseas, O.Yu/Seiyo did not, or could not, verify these payments.  
 
Even assuming Seiyo was unaware of this overstatement in sales it would be 
hard for competent auditors to ignore the comedic make-up of FOI’s 
financials. For example, receivables were 81% of FOI‘s balance sheet in the 
only 10-K (Yuho) FOI ever filed. This was equivalent to 2.3x annual sales 
based on the annual run rate for the 9-month period from April-December 
20097.  
 
By definition current assets are those that can be converted to cash within a 
year, so that more than a year of sales were tied up in receivables was 
inherently dubious for any auditor to sign off on.  
 
Following the FOI scandal the two signatory auditors at Seiyo/O.Yu –  
Tomotaka Hasumi (~� vM)and Yoshiaki Nakagawa (4R >_) – left the 
firm.  
 
Unsurprisingly, O.Yu ended up having to rebrand itself as Seiyo and a 
number of clients left Seiyo in the wake of this scandal… but not SMC.

TRIIS 
One could argue FOI was an isolated incident, however, evidence suggests 
the contrary.  
 
Also in 2009, Takahiro Furukawa (GRMN) a statutory auditor8 for Triis Inc 
(4840:JP) was ousted from the company at the behest of company president 
Hitoshi Ikeda (lrK) after complaining to the board about a number of 
unrecognized losses on investment securities the company was hiding and it 
was engaging in questionable related party transactions9.  
 
Ultimately, Furukawa went to court and successfully sued for wrongful 
dismissal. Triis was and remains a client of Seiyo/O.Yu to this day. The 
auditors signing off on Triis accounts at the time were Shunya Nakaichi  (4
S ?6) and Toshiaki Matsubuchi (do ^a)10. Both auditors seem to 
remain with Seiyo today11. 
 
Evidently, Seiyo is unable to audit these small entities, how can investors 
trust them to audit one of the largest corporations in Japan with 72 
subsidiaries worldwide? 
 
 
M&A – TURNING A NEW LEAF? 
In July 2016, Seiyo merged with another auditing firm called Kudan (5ju
em9). Kudan - like Seiyo - has had clients embroiled in accounting 
scandals. In Kudan’s case the client was Riso Kyoiku (4714 JP). 
 
Tutorial school operator Riso Kyoiku was discovered to have overstated net 
income by 5.6bn yen over the six-year period from 2008-201412. This 
effectively meant ALL the net income over the period was bogus. 2008 was 
when Kudan became Riso's auditor. 
 
Kudan was the subject of an FSA investigation in 2014 and was heavily 
censured for a lack of adequate controls and poor internal leadership13. As 
with FOI, the three audit partners that were responsible/signed off on the 
audits for most of the period have since left the firm. 
 





8	Statutory auditors or Kansayaku (ueZ) are a Japanese board position 
somewhat analogous to a supervisory board member or non-executive 
director in western companies.

THERE’S SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE ACCOUNTS. WHO YOU GONNA 
CALL? 
As easily Seiyo’s largest listed audit client, SMC holds substantial influence 
and power over Seiyo to get its way. One other interesting point to note is 
Seiyo’s office phone number: 6273-365014.  The first four digits are 
identical to SMC’s ticker code: 6273:JP.  We do not believe this is a 
coincidence - it is possible to choose your phone number in Japan, and it 
can be perceived as a sign of loyalty to one’s client. Indeed, O.Yu Kyodo had 
a different phone number before becoming Seiyo so the composition of 
SMC’s auditor’s new telephone number is uncanny. 
 


 
Source: Seiyo Website 
 
The auditors who signed off on FOI and Riso Kyoiku’s books may no longer be 
at the firm but given the history of involvement in at least three companies 
with suspect accounts, investors should ask themselves:  
 
Are you confident that Seiyo has either the capacity from a manpower 
and technical perspective to conduct a satisfactory audit of such a large 
company? 
 
 
CO-LOCATION OF AN SMC SUBSIDIARY IN THE SAME BUILDING AS SEIYO… 
Allegiance to the Takada family is a key criterion in promotion at SMC, and 
Seiyo’s unusual phone number raises potential questions over external 
auditor impartiality.  
 


																																																								
14	http://www.seiyo.or.jp/contact/
11	


We also draw reader’s attention to the co-location of one of SMC’s 
subsidiaries - Toyo Warehouse and Transportation (cn��@VfW<w) -	
in the same small office block as Seiyo. 
 
Toyo is a CONSOLIDATED subsidiary, yet despite being three floors above 
Seiyo it is NOT audited by Seiyo. According to its corporate registration, it 
appears Toyo has NO auditor at all. In fact, we have confirmed from a 
member of the JICPA (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants) 
that Toyo is audited by an SMC employee and a former employee of Resona 
Bank. 





 
Based on information submitted to Teikoku Databank, SMC rescued Toyo in 
August 1990 at the introduction of Resona Bank (then Kyowa Bank). SMC 
Chairman Takada then became president of Toyo in October 1990 and in 
March 1991 SMC’s then CFO Jiro Shirai (originally from Resona) became 
president until June 2003. He was then succeeded by Kojiro Okada another 
SMC and former Resona employee. Additionally, Toyo’s number two 
executive Mitsuo Miyakawa (OR3q), also appears to be from Resona. 
 
Interestingly, there are another two entities on the same floor as Toyo: 
IntelCasa ($0*.%2&) and NSM. IntelCasa appears to be a 100%-owned 
subsidiary of Toyo, according to Teikoku Databank.
12

Japanese corporate registry filings show the representative officer for 
IntelCasa is also Toyo’s President - Kojiro Okada (QrU8�). As eye-
catching is one of IntelCasa’s business purposes in its corporate registrar: 
Accounting/Book-keeping agents (<�7D;�h).   
	





Source: IntelCasa Corporate Registrar 


 
We believe the presence of Toyo Warehouse in the same office-block as 
Seiyo should raise investors’ eyebrows over Seiyo’s purported independence. 
Investors may want to ask themselves or SMC management: 


1. What is important enough about Toyo that every president of this 
consolidated subsidiary has either been a senior SMC board member 
and/or hailed from SMC’s main bank? 


2. Why is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company co-located in 
the same building as the Seiyo yet NOT audited by them?  


3. Indeed, why does Toyo appear to have NO auditor at all? 
4. What is the real purpose of IntelCasa? If it engages in book-keeping 


and accounting services, whose financial records is it preparing?? 
	





OVERSEAS AUDITOR QUALITY 
Auditor quality at SMC’s overseas subsidiaries - similar to the Japanese 
parent and Seiyo – is “unorthodox”. Not only are accounting policies 
BETWEEN SMC’s local auditors inconsistent but they frequently retroactively 
restate numbers with little to no explanation15.  
 
This clearly makes trusting subsidiary numbers simply as standalone entities 
problematic. These restated numbers are then aggregated to provide 


																																																								
15	See	Appendix	B	for	examples
13	


consolidated accounts without any disclosure on subsidiary restatements we 
think is deeply concerning. Unsurprisingly, consolidated figures also mask 
serious inconsistencies and raise questions about the underlying economics 
of SMC’s business and it is highly unlikely that Seiyo ask any questions. 
 
 
AUDITOR CHURN 
In the past six years SMC has used and then dropped EVERY big four auditor 
at least once from one of its global subsidiaries, and then often switched to 
a much smaller local auditor16. 
 
For example: 


• In the Philippines SMC’s subsidiary moved from KPMG to an auditor 
called Sison Corillo Parone & Co. 


• In Malaysia SMC Pneumatics Malaysia and Shoketsu Engineering both 
dropped KPMG in favor of Kreston John & Gan. 


• In FY03/2012 SMC Pneumatics Finland swapped out of PWC in favor of 
BTF Finland. 


• In FY03/2010 SMC Manufacturing Singapore dropped Deloitte and 
moved its audit to local audit firm RT LLP (then called LTC), which 
like Seiyo has a track record in auditing companies with colorful 
financial histories. 


• In the UK SMC’s subsidiary moved from Baker Tilly (a large local UK 
audit firm) to ECL Howard Watson Smith. Baker Tilly found “material 
errors” in accounts previously done by ECL. Yet somehow ECL was 
still reinstated as the auditor for the UK. 





 
We would also note that the UK subsidiary does not appear to have filed an 
auditors resignation notice with regards to this auditor change in 2015 at 
Companies House in the UK (the UK regulatory body), which is in violation 
of the UK Companies Act of 2006. We think it would be best to file this 
paperwork soon… alternatively, a curious investor could access this 
paperwork via use of a Norwich Pharmacal court order in the UK. 
 
Given the large global manufacturing platform SMC apparently runs surely it 
makes much more sense to have one large global auditor manage the audits 
of ALL of the group’s subsidiaries? 
 
What is the rationale for a large multinational manufacturer continuously 
dropping a big four name in favor of smaller auditors like BTF or Sison 
Corillo Parone & Co. with no real global footprint? 
Why not use Ernst & Young instead, for example, everywhere? E&Y is a 
global auditor just like SMC is meant to be a global manufacturer. 
SMC has already used all of the big four somewhere in the world at least

once, so it must be familiar with their operating abilities and their global 
capabilities.  
 
Failing that why not use Baker Tilly or Grant Thornton?  
	


Both operate internationally: 
• Baker Tilly already audits SOME but not all of SMC’s European 


operations (and crucially it no longer audits SMC’s operations in the 
UK where the auditor has its strongest presence)  


• Grant Thornton audits SOME but not all of SMC’s Asia ex-Japan 
operations.  


• Why not have either of them audit ALL the subsidiaries? 
It would make audit communication much smoother and increase 
transparency among the group….  
 
Unless of course, this is not something SMC is interested in. 
 
In fact, we think the situation in Singapore underscores the degree to which 
financial information is kept separate at various subsidiaries and makes it 
very difficult for any executives outside of a small coterie close to the 
Takada family to gauge the actual financial health of the entire group.  
 
In a city-state of 5.7mn people SMC operates two subsidiaries we know of, 
the pair are located less than a ten minute WALK from each other and yet 
they use different auditors!

SMC Manufacturing Singapore 
In 2015, SMC Manufacturing Singapore held approximately JPY49 billion of 
cash, 12% of SMC’s total cash balance. So it is of particular concern that this 
subsidiary raises questions over how much auditing is being done at some of 
SMC’s overseas entities and the undisclosed conflicts of interest that pepper 
the group. In fact, in this instance, the audit is completed at an unusually
15	


fast pace, a partner at the audit firm is married to the subsidiary’s company 
secretary and the auditor has a history of auditing frauds.  
 
The entity was even audited by Deloitte until FY03/2010, then the company 
changed to a local firm LTC, which subsequently changed its name to RT 
LLP.  
 
Much like its Japanese counterpart Seiyo, RT has a remarkable capacity as a 
small auditor to attract a certain type of client more than usual. Investors 
who got defrauded investing in the spate of S-Chip (Singaporean-listed 
Chinese equities) frauds may be familiar with RT’s previous incarnation LTC.  
 
LTC audited New Lakeside Holdings. In 2010 LTC had to admit that its audit 
opinion for FY2009 at the Chinese apple juice maker could “no longer be 
relied upon” due to fraudulent misrepresentations by the company17. 
 
RT had the honor of becoming the auditor of Singaporean-listed nylon and 
textile producer China Sky Chemical Fibre (CSCF:SP) in July 2015. After 
coming out of a four-year suspension China Sky Chemical Fibre’s shares were 
once again suspended in August 2016 after the board needed to assess 
“whether the company was able to operate as a going concern” after 
Chinese banks launched lawsuits against the company. 
 
Meanwhile in September 2016 a major shareholder of Malaysian-listed Multi 
Sports Holdings called for an investigation into the China-based shoe 
manufacturer after the company failed to submit its accounts on time. The 
auditors are… RT. 
 
 
SMC investors also may be heartened to know though that while RT needs 
more time to verify expenditure and bank balances at Multi Sports Holdings 
the auditor has without fail managed to file SMC Manufacturing’s accounts 
within 10 to 13 days of the end of the financial year EVERY year since it was 
appointed. For a complex audit on a manufacturing entity that conducts 
both cross-border and intra-company trade, significant transfer pricing 
issues and runs with significant inventory levels we think this is highly 
concerning.

Our due diligence in Singapore has also revealed significant conflicts of 
interest at the subsidiary: the Corporate Secretary of SMC Manufacturing, 
Sonia Ramchand Jagitiani, appears to be married to Ramchand Nanikram 
Jagtiani18 who until July 2016 was a partner of RT LLP (SMC Manufacturing’s 
auditor).  
 
Being husband and wife is a huge conflict of interest and raises serious 
questions over the validity of the accounts and the cash balances.   
 
Of course, it would be a conflict of interest for a company secretary to be 
married to the partner of the accounting firm that audits it. SMC 
Manufacturing Singapore and SMC Corp. being ethical companies would 
probably want to disclose this to investors… Especially as SMC 
Manufacturing’s accounts say they have one of the largest cash balances 
within the entire SMC group and investors would not want a repeat of Multi 
Sports Holdings where RT needed time to verify the cash balances.  
 
We have yet to find this disclosure.   
	


It is worth noting that E&Y were recently fined over US$ 9 million for an 
inappropriate relationship between an auditor and an audit client19.

PLEDGED SHARES – A TON OF THEM OUT THERE 
Investors should also be aware of a widely underappreciated filing with 
regards to TON Finance’s stake in SMC. In January 2009 TON20 (a holding 
vehicle for SMC Chairman Takada) disclosed in September 2008 - the day 
after Lehman Brothers collapsed - it had pledged up to ALL of it 3,836,200 
shares (5.11%) of its SMC as loan collateral with Resona Bank. (Note this 
disclosure is NOT posted on SMC’s IR webpage.) The purpose of the loans 
was not divulged and nor are they accounted for on Ton Finance’s balance 
sheet. 
 
Additionally, our findings demonstrate management cannot be trusted when 
it comes to filing accounts as there is a significant discrepancy between 
what was filed in Japan and what has been filed in the Netherlands.   
 
Japanese disclosure rules for pledged shares require mandatory filings only 
when the pledgor’s total stake is above 5.0%, so it is unclear if other 
insiders and their investment vehicles below this level may also have 
pledged their shares as well. Additionally, based on discussions with 
lawyers, we understand pledgers must disclose if the level of shares they 
have collateralized changes by more than 1.0% of the total outstanding 
shares in a company, and if the loan contract changes or expires. 
 
We would note insiders have a history of pledging shares as collateral to 
Resona and other lenders. For example, MYSTAR Ltd., an investment vehicle 
for SMC stock held by former president and chairman Susumu Omura & 
family, also collateralized at least part of its SMC stake21. 
 
Dutch and Japanese regulatory filings22 indicate TON sold down 392,700 
shares sometime between April-December 2013. As this is below 1.0% TON is 
not required to file an update on pledged shares outstanding. 
 
However, TON’s Dutch regulatory filings appear to contradict the level of 
shares it actually pledged. Until December 2013 TON had pledged just 37.8% 
of its stake in SMC, or 1.45mn SMC shares, and by 2014 it had pledged all of 
its 3.4mn SMC shares.

As can be seen in the extracts below, in Ton Finance’s FY13 accounts Ton 
had pledged 1,450,000 shares, however, in their FY14 accounts, it states

that it had pledged 3,443,500 in both FY14 and FY13 and no reason is given 
for this restatement, raising further questions of the reliability of the 
financial statements prepared for SMC’s management.  
 


 
Source: TON Finance 2013 Dutch Regulatory Filings 
 


 
Source: TON Finance 2014 Dutch Regulatory Filings 
 
Here are some questions investors may want to ask management, 
specifically Chairman Takada: 


1. Are the Dutch regulatory filings correct or are the Japanese filings 
correct? 


2. If the Dutch filings are correct then why did TON disclose a pledge in 
Japan for 100% of its shares in 2008 and why did TON not disclose an 
increase in pledged shares in 2014? This would be a violation of 
Japanese disclosure laws. 


3. If the Japanese disclosure is correct why did TON file incorrect 
financial statements with the Dutch authorities for six years? 


4. What is the actual volume of share’s pledged by TON as loan 
collateral and how has this changed over time? 


5. What have the proceeds of these loans been used for? It does not 
appear to be on TON’s balance sheet 


6. Who holds the voting rights for TON Finance’s SMC shares? Resona 
Bank or TON Finance?  


7. Have any other insider/management investment vehicles also pledged 
their SMC shares? If so, which ones, why and by how much? 


 
Regardless, we do not think it is a positive sign that Chairman Takada’s 
largest investment vehicle has collateralized its ENTIRE stake in SMC 
against a loan with Resona, or that other insiders also collateralized their 
stakes.  


AT LEAST JPY81.7 BILLION OF CASH MIGHT NOT EXIST 
We have obtained almost all the local filings for SMC’s major subsidiaries 
and have found that in conjunction with the other subsidiaries we managed 
to find documentation for, we are missing JPY81.7 billion of cash… and we 
think there is a strong chance that this cash may not exist.
19	


 
As can be seen in the above table, we have not managed to obtain financials 
for SMC USA, SMC Hong Kong, SMC Taiwan or SMC Brazil. Nevertheless, we 
believe we have captured the majority of the cash and it is highly unlikely 
that the remaining major subsidiaries have maintained cash balances

20	


equating to anywhere near the missing JPY81.7 billion for the following 
reasons: 
 


1. We understand from industry observers, that SMC USA may not be 
even profitable without creative accounting and subsidies from the 
parent. Additionally, they have spent significant cash on an onsite 
hotel for employees and visiting businessmen. 


2. SMC Brazil is also unlikely to hold significant amounts of cash as the 
South American countries have barely been profitable over the last 
few years. 


3. We understand from competitors that SMC Hong Kong’s revenues 
were in the HK$50 million to HK$75 million over the last six years and 
net profit likely to have ranged between HK$5 million to HK$8 
million. These results are unlikely to produce any significant cash. 


4. SMC Taiwan has, according to analyst reports 23 , sales in 2016 in 
Taiwan of US$83 million. Applying a similar margin as Korea 
(approx.14.3% in 2016) operating profit would be approximately 
US$12 million (JPY1.4 billion) which again makes it unlikely that 
Taiwan has a significant cash pile. 


 
We therefore believe at least JPY81.7 billion of SMC’s cash does not exist 
and this assumes the large cash piles at the parent level and at SMC 
Manufacturing Singapore are both real despite them having auditors who 
lack independence and have questionable clients.          
 
Further support of the cash not existing is our analysis of interest income.  
Local Chinese filings show that the cash deposits earn an average yield of 
approximately 8.4% and the Japanese Parent’s accounts show a yield of 
1.0%. The total interest income from these accounts is approximately 
JPY6.1 billion yet the consolidated interest income is only JPY5.4 billion24. 
This implies that the remaining cash throughout the rest of the world, 55% 
of the total balance, amounting to approximately JPY188 billion is earning a 
negative yield of -0.4% which is nonsensical.   


																																																								
23 Nomura analyst report on SMC 25 November 2016 
24 Since FY03/2014 SMC only discloses parent-level interest AND dividend income as 
opposed to breaking them out separately. However, the historical figures showed dividend 
income to be tiny and we believe most of the total today to still be mainly coming from 
‘interest’ income than dividends for the parent.
21

Based on these findings, we believe that SMC’s cash is materially overstated 
which is not surprising considering the lack of oversight by Seiyo, an auditor 
that had just 16 certified public accountants and a history of being unable 
to verify overseas transactions at clients, such as FOI. 
 
 
SMC INVENTORY – A PERENNIAL MYSTERY 
SMC has always held inventory levels vastly above those of peers - the 
Company says their strategy is to have sufficient finished goods on-hand to 
supply customers quickly. Consolidated financials show an average of 316 
days over the past eight years, yet somehow its peers seem to make do 
with only an average 116 days – i.e. SMC carries over 2.5x the industry 
standard! Based on consolidated disclosure the company somehow 
makes minimal obsolescence charges or provisions to these huge levels of 
stock. Normalizing the days turnover and assuming the excess is obsolete 
would lead to a potential write-down of up to JPY100bn of inventory.

Based on disclosure in its Yuho, SMC has started to disclose its inventory 
write-down in 2009 and this has averaged roughly 1.5% per annum of gross 
inventory levels, we estimated the write-downs from prior years from the 
deferred tax assets, and this means that approximately 11% of gross 
inventory has been impaired over the period. However, as is standard with 
SMC, subsidiaries’ disclosure tells a very different story. 


 
When SMC put its Filipino subsidiary (SMC Pneumatics Philippines) into 
receivership in 2003 following a dispute with management PWC made the 
entity write down 43% of its inventory25. This is a significant write-down 
considering claims that these goods could just be sold to another entity and 
reused unless they truly were obsolete and were kept at an inflated 
valuation on the balance sheet. 


 
Source: SMC Pneumatics Philippines Regulatory Filings 2003 


 
Meanwhile, its British auditors have continuously tightened inventory 
impairment rules. Inventory more than two years old is written down by 
more than 90% and the subsidiary has taken provisions against 40% of its 
inventory since FY03/2012. Again this clearly demonstrates that SMC’s 
inventory does become obsolete and in the case of the UK appears to 
become obsolete at a rate of approximately 5% per annum, over 3x the rate 
of obsolescence at the consolidated level.

Furthermore, our own enquiries in the US with former staff suggest 
approximately a quarter of American inventory should be immediately 
impaired and attempts to liquidate dead inventory were not even able to 
generate 10 cents on the dollar. 
 
We have also found inventory build-up in Korea without any incremental 
increase in sales or Costs of Goods Sold. As can be seen in the table below, 
inventory has almost doubled since 2013 but with little result in sales 
growth. Normalizing these inventory days would suggest a 52% write-down. 
It is worth noting that SMC has been in trouble in Korea for anti-competitive 
behavior with unfair price-cutting. SMC Corp are expected to be fined 
11.66% of their net income for the next five years26. Dramatic price-cutting 
and a rapid build-up in stock raises the likelihood of significant 
obsolescence. 
 
Based on these disclosures and comparisons with competitors, we think 
SMC needs to provision for anywhere between JPY19bn to JPY91bn in 
inventory impairments with Y55bn a conservative level for provisioning 
after accounting for amounts already written-down.

GROUP TRANSACTIONS AND INVENTORY WRITEDOWNS 
Not only do there appear to be non-disclosed related party transaction 
occurring SMC also seems to have soft spot for intra-group transactions as a 
way to avoid taking inventory write-downs of any scale.  
 
Back in FY03/2013 SMC Manufacturing Singapore’s P&L had an unusual line 
item called ‘other operating expenses' for SGD1.8mn. Ordinarily we would 
let such a small sum of money slide, however, in SMC’s case we believe this 
is indicative of the cavalier attitude the company has towards correct 
accounting procedures.  
 


 
Source: SMC Manufacturing Singapore FY03/2013 Regulatory Filings 
 
Far from being a mere expense, buried away in footnotes it transpires the 
SGD1.8mn was an inventory write-down, the bulk of which occurred in the 
“cylinder category”. According to the subsidiary’s footnotes, cylinders have 
historically been very unprofitable for SMC Manufacturing Singapore, from 
FY03/2010 to FY03/2013 this segment had AT LEAST negative 100% gross 
margin… i.e. the implication is these were being sold for 50% or more below 
CoGs!
25	


 
Source: SMC Manufacturing Singapore Regulatory Filing Footnotes 
 
Suddenly in FY03/2014 cylinder sales spike and there is a huge improvement 
in gross margin (albeit still negative, just not nearly as horrible). This was 
then followed up with some rather eye-catching disclosure in FY03/2015,  
"The Company reversed $428,480 (2014: $734,137) of a previous inventory 
write down in FY2014. The Company has sold all the goods that were 
written down to its ultimate holding company in Japan and related 
companies in Singapore at original cost. The amount reversed has been 
included in “other operating income” 
 
Given cylinders had racked up negative gross profit roughly equal to sales in 
the prior three years this implies Manufacturing would have had to have sold 
cylinders at prices more than double what they sold them at previously. It 
also suggests over half of cylinder sales in FY03/14 were an intragroup 
transaction specifically to writeback most of a write-down. Indeed, in 
FY03/15 write-backs almost exactly match cylinder segment sales and gross 
profit is almost zero, implying nearly all sales were done at inflated prices 
to reverse writedowns! Thus by FY03/2015 Manufacturing Singapore had 
written back 2/3 of the writedown. Interestingly, after writing back most of 
this write-down SMC Manufacturing Singapore then ceased production of 
cylinders, according to its FY03/2016 accounts.	
 
If one is able to sell products at inflated prices via intra-group sales this 
implies by round-tripping or shuffling inventory to one’s heart’s delight one 
NEVER has to book a writedown. 
 
We think this raises much broader questions about inventory impairments 
across the group. After all, if SMC is prepared to fight tooth-and-claw to 
reverse SGD1.8mn in inventory write-downs via suspect inter-party 
transactions what does this say about the entire inventory pile?
26	


 
 
QUESTIONABLE MARGINS IN JAPAN 
SMC generates the majority of revenue and profit in Japan, rather than at 
its overseas operations.  
 
Despite revenue being flat to slightly down from FY 03/2008 there has been 
a giddy 1900 basis points of operating margin expansion in Japan. Moreover, 
this performance comes AFTER removing all company internal transactions, 
and is not due to FX as Japan revenue primarily comes from third parties 
and these sales are generally matched through its domestic production 
base. 
	














In short, we have yet to find any long-established company in the factory 
automation business that has managed such amazing margin improvement. 
 
How is this possible? 
1. Could Japan be moving profit around via transfer pricing to improve tax 
efficiencies?  
Perhaps, but Japan has one of the highest corporate tax rates globally so 
this would be odd.

2. Could the parent be making its overseas subsidiaries pay increased 
royalties thus boosting Japanese profitability without any concomitant rise 
in domestic revenue? 
Possibly, but this should be captured in the internal 
transactions/eliminations line.   
 
 
RESONA KESSAI SERVICE  
The Parent account payables are extremely puzzling if one digs back into 
SMC’s historical Teikoku filings. Up until FY03/2013, SMC used to disclose in 
its Japanese filings SMC Parent’s largest holders of accounts payable. 
Resona Kessai was ALWAYS the largest annual holder of SMC Parent accounts 
payable - generally holding 66-80% of total consolidated accounts payable.  
Resona Kessai Service is a 100%-subsidiary of Resona Holdings, SMC’s main 
bank and former employer to most of the key financial executives at SMC.

SMC’s Yuhos from FY03/2004 to FY03/2013 also reveal Resona Kessai had 
acquired accounts receivables against the SMC Parent held by one of SMC’s 
trading partners/counterparties. These factoring transactions presumably 
led to the large payables outstanding held by Resona Kessai. 
	





With regards to accounts payable held by Resona Kessai, Resona Kessai took 
over accounts receivables against SMC Parent held by one of SMC’s counter-
parties.

This seems strange; companies typically factor receivables at a discount as a 
way to raise cash quickly, yet SMC supposedly settles ALL its account 
payables within 70 days and as fast as 20. The Company is also meant to be 
a high quality credit (local ratings agency R&I has an AA rating on SMC). One 
would have thought external suppliers to SMC would be comfortable running 
receivables against the parent rather than needing to factor these balances 
through Resona Kessai at a discount. We also note, that the continued 
fluctuation in the accounts payable indicates that this was not a one-off 
factoring but an ongoing business relationship which makes the matter even 
more bizarre.  
 


 
 
Furthermore, based on the latest Teikoku report from 2015 SMC’s top two 
listed suppliers are Sakagami Seisakusho and Yokogawa Electric (6841:JP). 
Both these companies were included in SMC’s breakout of its top accounts 
payable counterparties and ran accounts payables no larger than JPY750 
million in any given year!
29	


 
Source: SMC Parent’s 2015 Teikoku Databank Filing. 
 
That squares against accounts payables consistently north of JPY25bn yen 
held by Resona Kessai. Resona Kessai’s payables balance appears FAR TOO 
large to represent ONE supplier to SMC. Indeed, we doubt whether this 
balance could even represent multiple external suppliers given its sheer size 
and the details on suppliers in the Teikoku reports. 
 


	
						Source:	Resona	Kessai’s	Teikoku	Databank	Filing.	








Source: Resona Kessai’s 2016 Teikoku Databank Filing. 
 
Finally, if we assume SMC parent’s payables balance with Resona Kessai has 
remained at approximately JPY33bn then this would be around 10% of
30	


Resona Kessai’s total current assets as of March 2016. Resona Kessai notes 
they have 300 factoring clients, so for one client to be approximately 10% of 
their business would be very significant. Yet, Resona Kessai makes 
absolutely no mention of its relationship with SMC despite this… in fact, we 
have checked Resona Kessai’s Teikoku reports back to 2008 and cannot find 
any mention of client concentration risk LET ALONE mention of SMC. We 
find this puzzling. 
 
Attempting to rationalize how Resona Kessai has factored the scale of the 
receivables it did and become the largest holder of parent payables is thus 
problematic. There is one more notable aspect about Resona Kessai; it 
obtains 100% of its financing from Resona Bank and Resona group 
companies. However, if its factoring assets become uncollectible (i.e. they 
turn into NPLs), Resona Kessai does not have to repay its loans on these 
assets back to Resona Bank. In effect, Resona Kessai bears NO risk on its 
factoring business – Resona Bank bears it all. Assuming SMC has, or had, the 
level of payables its Seiyo-audited accounts said it did then effectively 
these Kessai’s payables are akin to Resona bank loans to SMC. 
 
Investors may want to ask the company and Resona Holdings: 


1. Who did Reson Kessai buy the receivables from? 
2. Does, or did, this have any impact on how expenses have been 


recognized? 
3. How did Resona Kessai get to be such a large holder of SMC Parent 


payables? 
4. Why did SMC stop disclosing this detail in FY03/2013? 
5. Is it still the case Resona Kessai holds so many payables? If so, 


why? 
6. Why did a counterparty, or counterparties, feel compelled to 


factor their receivables to the SMC parent if SMC is such a high-
quality credit and settles payables fast? 


 
 
TO CONSOLIDATE, OR NOT TO CONSOLIDATE?  
In keeping with SMC’s unusual attitude towards auditors, the company’s 
disclosure on consolidation strikes us as not only substandard but also open 
to abuse given an unusually large and growing amount of non-consolidated 
subsidiaries. 
 
Consolidation is required when the parent has significant ownership and 
control of a subsidiary. While there is some scope for interpretation over 
what exactly constitutes significant ownership and control, it is accepted 
that ownership of more than 50% requires consolidation. In instances 
where equity ownership is between 20-50% and the parent company has the 
ability to exercise significant influence then equity method accounting is 
normally used. Moreover, disclosure is required on non-consolidated 
subsidiaries and equity method affiliates.  
 
However, the yardstick by which SMC consolidates entities is whether a
31	


subsidiary’s results are “material” - or not to the overall group accounts. 
While SMC is not alone in doing this, it IS extremely unique among its peers 
in Japan in ever expanding its non-consolidated entities and failing to even 
properly disclose the names of its consolidated entities! 
 
We believe this accounting treatment makes its consolidation policy ripe for 
abuse. 
 
The following graph shows how the number of disclosed SMC subsidiaries, 
particularly non-consolidated ones, have been increasing over time - hitting 
39 last financial year.   
 
	


 
Source: SMC Annual Reports & Yuhos 
 
This underscores a major flaw with the consolidated accounts; by non-
consolidating an ever-increasing number of entities on unclear grounds 
external investors simply have no idea what the real performance of the 
whole group is. 
Indeed, none of its peers has such a staggeringly high level of non-
consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
NAME No. of Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries 


FY03/2016 


THK (6481:JP) 1 
CKD (6407:JP) 1 
Nabtesco (6268:JP) 0 


SMC (6273:JP) 39 
 
 
We think there is a high likelihood the burgeoning number of unconsolidated 
subsidiaries is being used to mask intra-group sales and covertly push these 
into the consolidated group accounts. Due to the jumble of different
32	


auditors used globally not all of SMC’s overseas operations break out intra-
group sales. However, SMC Italia S.p.A’s accounts provide the most detailed 
breakdown of group companies and thus a snapshot of intra-group 
transactions seen through the lens of the Italian subsidiary.  
 
While non-consolidated subsidiary sales dropped to less than 1% in 
FY03/2016 it is noteworthy that between FY03/2012 to FY03/2015 they 
were averaging around 6% of overall sales. Applied to the consolidated 
group this would suggest that JPY91.1bn over the period could be 
consolidated to non-consolidated transactions! 
 
Similarly, the task of understanding what is going on inside the company’s 
consolidated accounts is made even harder as SMC stopped providing a full 
list of consolidated subsidiaries from FY03/2013_. Investors in both Japanese 
and English are now merely left with a list of SMC’s “major subsidiaries” - of 
which there were 17 last financial year. It is therefore impossible now to 
even to know exactly which entities are going into the consolidated 
accounts!  
 


 
 
Source: SMC English Annual Report 2016 
 
This strikes us as a system wide open to abuse, particularly considering that 
even when SMC provided investors with a detailed roll call of consolidated 
entities it had a questionable track record of adding and dropping 
subsidiaries from consolidation with little to no disclosure – such as was the 
case with SMC Pneumatics Philippines, Shoketsu Finance BV and PT SMC 
Pneumatics Indonesia.  
 
 (While one can amalgamate SMC’s Yuho organizational chart and its major 
subsidiaries list to create a fuller list of consolidated subsidiaries there are 
still five consolidated subsidiaries whose names are now unknown. Are 
these still Advanced Pressure Technology, SMC Pneumatics (N.Z.), SMC 
Manufacturing (Aust.) Pty., SMC Pneumatics (Ireland), and SMC Industrial 
Automation CZ s.r.o. as was the case back in FY03/2012?) 
 
Furthermore, SMC is extremely unusual among Japanese companies in 
failing to disclose the full roster of its consolidated subsidiaries. CKD, 
Nabtesco, and THK ALL provide a comprehensive list of their fully
33	


consolidated subsidiaries in their Yuhos. And it is nothing to do with the 
amount of consolidated entities that SMC has - in FY03/2016 THK had 
EXACTLY the same amount of consolidated subsidiaries as SMC and still 
provided an exhaustive roll call of ALL these entities in its FY03/2016 Yuho.  
 
Given a large swathe of undisclosed consolidated and non-consolidated 
subsidiaries, an investor has no way of knowing if someone is shuffling 
subsidiaries in and out of consolidation at a whim, or how much inventory, 
payables or even debt some of these entities actually carry.  
 
We think SMC needs to come clean and show investors in detail how it 
chooses to consolidate its entities, a full roster of what these entities 
have been over time - just like other Japanese companies do - detailed 
disclosure on its unconsolidated subsidiaries and if these subsidiaries are 
involved in related party transactions.  
 
 
SMC Pneumatics Philippines 
We think the events surrounding SMC Pneumatics Philippines (“SMC 
Philippines”) underscore how problematic arbitrary deconsolidation - and 
consolidation - of subsidiaries at SMC can be. SMC Philippines was a 
consolidated subsidiary until FY03/2004 and then suddenly fell out of the 
list.  
 
Filipino regulatory filings indicate that SMC Philippines posted PHP153.7mn 
in sales and a net loss of PHP96.3mn for FY03/2003, or JPY353.5mn in sales 
and a net loss of JPY221.5mn. 
 
More worrying though was on March 10th 2003 an injunction, a temporary 
restraining order and an order for receivership status were filed by SMC 
Philippines and certain foreign stockholders (which we assume ultimately to 
be the Japanese parent) against the then Company President and General 
Manager. 
 
Three weeks later on April 1st 2003 SMC deconsolidated SMC Philippines, 
however, the first mention of this was not for another 13 months when SMC 
filed its Q4 FY03/2004 results and Yuho. 
 
During those 13 months SMC decided to permanently cut-off deliveries of 
goods to SMC Philippines, filed a petition for the involuntary dissolution of 
SMC Philippines and for damages against the President and General 
Manager; and a Filipino court then put the company into receivership.  
 
While SMC Philippines was by no means a large entity all these events strike 
us as material events and worthy of at least one or two lines of explanation. 
Instead, investors received the most cursory of disclosure "the Philippines 
was deconsolidated " when in fact is was being wound up! 
 
With even LESS disclosure today over the make-up of the group, how
34	


confident can investors be that the consolidated accounts reflect the 
economic reality of the business? 


 
 
SMC Pneumatics Indonesia 
PT SMC Pneumatics Indonesia (“SMC Indonesia”) was de-consolidated from 
group accounts in FY 03/2007 on the basis of immateriality to consolidated 
financial statements. Nonetheless, SMC Indonesia is actually a 100%-owned 
subsidiary of SMC Pneumatics (SEA) PTE LTD (“SMC Pneumatics Singapore”), 
a consolidated group subsidiary. Questionable methods were then used to 
reverse write-downs on a ‘dormant’ and “unconsolidated” entity (Indonesia) 
that clearly flowed back into and helped a consolidated subsidiary.  
 
In FY03/2011 despite SMC Pneumatics Singapore explicitly stating that SMC 
Indonesia was dormant, and thus had no statutory audit requirements the 
auditor – Philip Liew & Co. – still managed to allow SMC Pneumatics 
Singapore to write-back SGD600,000 on a SGD2.9mn write-down it had 
booked on the entity! 
 
 


 
Source: SMC Pneumatics Singapore Financial Statements FY03/2011 
 
With no active business it is hard to see what triggered a reversal of an 
impairment loss. SMC Pneumatics Singapore continued to book write-backs 
in FY03/2012 for SGD1mn although given the poor disclosure it is unclear 
which subsidiary this came from. Then it booked a SGD1.3mn write-back for 
Indonesia in 2016, although at this point in time SMC Indonesia was 
functioning again as a subsidiary. 
 
Not only do we think the logic for some of these write-backs is questionable 
but it also shows how easy it is for the company to push entities off balance 
sheet but then use unquantifiable valuation gains and write-backs on them 
as sources of profit that flow back into consolidated accounts!  
 
Moreover, it is eye-catching that related party sales at SMC Pneumatics 
Singapore picked up significantly from FY03/2012 onwards and now 
represent 16% of revenue – without which headline revenue would have 
actually fallen. Unfortunately, it is unclear from SMC Pneumatics Singapore 
disclosure if these related party sales are to non-consolidated or 
consolidated SMC subsidiaries. But at the very least it is indicative of
35	


deteriorating third–party demand.

CORPORATE CULTURE 
Despite being a listed company for nearly 30 years SMC’s culture is still 
totally dictated by the personality and vision of its founder and chairman 
Yoshiyuki Takada. The Company is effectively a family run business where 
people with views that conflict with the Chairman are systematically 
removed.  
 
Takada family members hold key management roles: the chairman’s son - 
Yoshiki - runs the Americas and Edward August Neff (Takada’s son-in-law) 
having held senior roles at SMC is now CEO of SMAC, a US-based company 
owned by SMC.  
 
Our own enquiries with former employees have revealed a culture of 
nepotism where connections and loyalty to the Takada family is often more 
central to career promotion. For example, in the US numerous market 
participants have informed us friends and family of Kelley Stacy, a close 
confidant of Yoshiki Takada who started out as a secretary at SMC, occupy 
senior management roles.  
 
It is widely reported across different job bulletin boards in Japan that 
Yoshiyuki Takada’s management style verges on dictatorial and divergent 
opinions are not welcome.

Our own investigation into SMC Corporation of America (“SMC USA”) paints a 
similar picture and we think is likely to create serious operational 
challenges for the company going forwards unless senior management 
(primarily SMC USA President Yoshiki Takada and his number two Kelley 
Stacy) is able to engineer a change in culture. Interviews with former 
employees and market participants have revealed aggressive cuts to sales 
staff bonuses and introduction of GPS tracking systems in salespeople’s 
phones and cars has triggered an exodus of staff, left remaining workers 
demoralized and hurt productivity. 
 
• The CFO in the US is competent, “but he is also 'asked to dance' every so 


often by the founder's son and leadership team” 
• The Japanese management accounting system at SMC “is opaque and 


allows the highest level managers to keep tight control over information” 
• We understand also that president Takada is not onsite in Indiana most 


of the time instead preferring to spend his days in California and Hawaii.  
• It is also noteworthy that a person who appears to be Kelley Stacy’s 


husband - Barry Stacy - is the Chief Operating Officer of Flodraulic Group

E40742_P3.htm
38	


, a large SMC distributor. Such a relationship could offer potential for 
abuse including, early revenue recognition, and channel stuffing etc. 


 
Furthermore, interviews with former employees further substantiate 
questionable ethics and management capabilities: 
 
• “The US division is mired in unethical business practices” 
•  “I could write a book or even a movie because it’s so absurdly managed.  


There are a handful of people in key places that keep it running but 
from the top down, it’s an embarrassment of an organization.  It is 
unbelievable that a company of that size can make their way through.” 


• “Ethically I think they have some challenges in the US.  If you talked to 
anybody about their US efforts, I’d be shocked if you got something 
different in that vein.” 


• “From the standpoint of conflict of interest, there are some personal 
conflict of interest practices going on.  I’ll just put it that way.” 


 
Barring a reversal in strategy we think SMC USA is setting itself up for 
serious erosion in its market share. According to one expert, SMC USA is 
living off the market share created by all the salespeople who have left due 
to cuts in bonuses and the installation of the GPS tracking system. These 
experts now work for some of SMC’s competitors and believe that the US 
operation has become a train wreck and losing market share. They have also 
spent significant capex on building an onsite hotel for employees and 
business visitors with one distributor visiting the US operation and stating “It 
looks like the kids are running the candy shop”. 
 
Based on our inquiries we question if the current management team is 
capable of backtracking on and grasping the implications of previous 
missteps. A former C-Suite executive at one of SMC’s major subsidiaries 
described the situation to us as “what Takada said was law – there was no 
criticism allowed.”   
 
In short, SMC is Chairman Takada’s show. We believe a culture of 
nepotism and unwillingness to accept constructive criticism from staff 
has led to serious structural issues that have for years been masked by 
highly dubious accounting practices. 
 
 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Given how opaque the internal workings of SMC are the company needs to 
explain fully to investors not only what entities are consolidated but if any 
of the group entities (consolidated or not) are engaging in related party 
transactions. 
 
We think the group’s European Central Warehouse (ECW), is a case in 
point.
39	


Before we delve into the ECW though we think a quick detour to understand 
the byzantine structure of SMC’s operations in the Benelux countries is 
necessary. 
	


HOLLAND & BELGIUM 
A casual reader of SMC’s website may get the impression that SMC 
Pneumatics N.V./S.A. (“SMC Belgium”), SMC Pneumatics B.V.  (“SMC 
Holland”) and the ECW are part of SMC proper. In fact, page 19 of SMC’s 
own corporate guide 30misleadingly goes as far as to present Belgium and 
Holland as overseas subsidiaries.  
 


  
Source: SMC Corporate Guide 
 
However, these Benelux entities are NOT part of the consolidated group. 
Dutch and Belgian regulatory filings show SMC Belgium, SMC Holland and at 
least part of the ECW belong to a separate Dutch business owned by Nauta 
Holding B.V. (“Nauta Group”).  
 
Based on a corporate video by the Group and website31 - the head of Nauta 
Group - has been doing business with Japanese toolmakers, including SMC, 
since the 60s.

when describing what SMC Pneumatics BV itself does, his description was 
that they are a “wholesale company for a couple of small companies and 
doing book-keeping as well.” Dutch regulatory filings show B.L. van Zuilen 
signs TON Finance, Shoketsu Finance BV’s and SMC Holland’s  accounts as 
their “Finance Manager”. Bas van Zuilen’s LinkedIn profile35 shows he is 
listed as the Finance Manager at SMC Holland and SMC Belgium – both Nauta 
Group companies.

Technically, as neither SMC Belgium nor SMC Holland is an SMC Corp. 
subsidiary any sales to these two are third party sales and would be off-
balance sheet.  
 
HOWEVER, the overlap of directors (Sjoerd Nauta), finance managers (Bas 
van Zuilen), and co-location of SMC Corp subsidiaries, investment vehicles of 
SMC senior management (TON Finance) and the former largest holder of SMC 
parent receivables (Shoketsu Finance) at the registered address of the 
Nauta Group clearly shows SMC Corp and the Nauta Group ARE RELATED 
PARTIES. 
Yet SMC’s own disclosure in Japanese and English MAKES NO MENTION of 
such related party transactions.

We think this is highly problematic from an accounting perspective, 
especially when trying to understand how SMC deals with inventory in the 
ECW, of which there is zero disclosure.

smc.com and smcpneumatics.be) shows both sites to be managed by 
the NAUTA GROUP via its 100%-owned subsidiary SMC Belgium as 
opposed to SMC proper. Indeed, R. Van de Pal appears to be an IT 
manager at one of the Nauta Group subsidiaries, according to 
Linkedin37.

This strongly implies the ECW is managed by SMC Belgium, NOT by SMC 
proper. 
Is inventory delivered into the ECW thus property of/or managed by SMC 
Belgium, an off-balance sheet entity, or does it remain on balance sheet 
with the SMC Group?  
Given the huge size of the ECW a substantial swathe of inventory may be 
unaccounted for in consolidated accounts. We think SMC needs to clarify 
this.  
 
3. The ECW layout/structure is very irregular and a casual observer may 
wonder why the site was designed in such a fashion.

Belgian land records for the ECW show the site is actually co-owned by both 
the Nauta Group AND SMC Corp. through SMC Logistics Europe further 
underscoring the related-party issues with the site.

We think this land sharing is extremely unusual, how is inventory 
accounted for in different parts of the ECW?  
Why did SMC Logistics Europe NV acquire a small subsection of the Nauta 
Holding land in 2013?
47	


VALUATION 
 
Based on how pervasive the accounting issues are we think SMC’s stock 
should trade anywhere between 50% to 85% lower than current levels 
resulting in a target price range of between JPY4,484 and JPY15,145. 
 
Our extremely wide price range reflects how difficult it is for an external 
investor to value SMC’s business in light of how the inherent flaws in the 
company’s accounts are and the significant scope for SMC to have 
manipulated its accounts.  
 
We can say with confidence though: 
A) We do not believe SMC should be an approx. JPY2trn market cap business 
that trades at 25x earnings, and 12x EV/EBITDA when sales and margins 
cannot be trusted, and book value is likely overstated.  
B) The market has NOT react well to large-scale corporate scandals, 
especially those involving accounting issues and corporate governance 
failures. 
 
The following is a list of some of Japan’s largest corporate scandals and the 
impact on their stock price in the year following the scandal coming to 
light: 
 


1. In 2005 Kanebo Ltd restated four years’ worth of earnings which had 
been inflated by about JPY210bn. Kanebo executives had colluded 
with its auditors ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers38; three of the 
auditors were found guilty of conspiracy39. The stock price fell nearly 
75% before the company was delisted as a result of the scandal. 


2. Olympus’ stock price dropped over 80% following the exposure of 
JPY117.7bn of investment losses it had concealed. 


3. Toshiba Corp’s stock price dropped 60% as details of its JPY151bn 
accounting manipulation were uncovered and the company remains 
on the TSE’s ‘watch list’. 


4. IHI Corp’s stock likewise fell over 60% in the year following its 
restatement of a JPY15.8bn profit to a JPY4.6bn loss in March 2007. 


5. Long Term Credit Bank of Japan’s stock price dropped over 70% when 
it was discovered that it had underestimated bad loan reserves by 
US$4bn in 1998. 


6. Yamaichi Securities went bankrupt after they had been hiding 
US$2.5bn in losses in paper companies.

guilty-of-conspiracy.html
48	


7. Livedoor Co’s stock collapsed 90% in the four months after it was 
revealed that they were fraudulently boosting their stock price 
before being delisted. 


 
We think Kanebo may be the most instructive case. Kanebo’s auditors 
(ChuoAoyama  PwC) signed off on accounts they knew were forged40.  In the 
cases above, investors experienced declines in stock prices of at least 70% 
and in Kanebo and Livedoor cases, the stocks were delisted. The average 
downside within a year each of these scandals breaking was 85.4%. Applying 
this to SMC results in a target price of JPY4,484. 
 


 
 
Alternatively, we think applying a 15% operating margin to SMC’s business is 
probably more reflective of the economics of the business. (AirTac has 
higher OPMs versus peers but operates with fewer Stock Keeping Units 
resulting in a more streamlined and efficient production process.) Assuming 
SMC sales forecasts for FY03/2017 are accurate and not fabricated, we 
calculate operating profits of JPY 69bn and apply a tax rate of 29%, based 
on the weighted average of the last three years, to calculate net profits of 
JPY49bn.

We do not think SMC deserves to trade at a premium 25x multiple versus 
peers, applying the industry average P/E of 21x to JPY49bn results in an 
expected price per share of JPY15,145/share, a downside of 50%. We would 
also note that our calculation does not take into account possible inventory 
writedowns and other impairments the company will likely incur.

APPENDIX B – SUBSIDIARY RESTATEMENTS 
 
Before we dissect Manufacturing Singapore accounts a brief primer on 
Advance Purchasing Agreements (APA) may be necessary… 
 
Advance Purchasing Agreements (APA) are agreements between companies 
and tax authorities covering tax treatment of intra-group transactions - 
otherwise known as Transfer Pricing - over set periods of time. These are 
complex legal and taxation issues, but the basic idea is these agreements 
prevent companies booking profits in tax-havens etc. to evade tax. One 
generally accepted rule is intra-group transactions should be conducted as 
arms-lengths transactions - a rule of thumb Singapore also effectively uses.  
 
In the past 13-years Manufacturing Singapore appears to have fallen afoul of 
Transfer Pricing agreements with the Singaporean Inland Revenue at least 
three times!  
 
**** 
In FY03/2004 Manufacturing Singapore’s filings revealed it had to restate 
FY03/2003 accounts due to an APA issue and the Inland Revenue Authority 
of Singapore reduced income tax chargeable to the company – i.e. 
Manufacturing Singapore wasn’t as profitable as its accounts said.  This 
resulted in a reduction of aggregate profit of SMC Manufacturing of SGD 59.6 
million for the years March 31, 1992 to March 31, 2001!  Then-auditor 
Deloitte wrote down retained earnings by that amount net of a tax refund 
due to the subsidiary.   
 
However, more bizarre was a write up in receivables while the nebulous 
‘other payables’ line item on the balance sheet blew out by a factor of 25x 
to SGD 62.1 million from SGD 2.5 million! Despite this revision to receivables 
and a significant retroactive bump in payables, cash and fixed deposits 
somehow were left unchanged in the restatement!  
 
Typically transfer pricing among consolidated subsidiaries should only 
affect taxes – so that both receivables and payables underwent such a 
heavy restatement while the cash balance was untouched looks very 
strange. In fact, a skeptic may even think it looks like a wily attempt to 
prevent a contraction in the balance sheet and maintain a stated cash 
level…
53	





 
Source: SMC Manufacturing Singapore Regulatory Filings. 
 
Far from being the end of the matter, in FY03/2008 SMC Manufacturing 
Singapore once again revealed huge adjustments due to transfer pricing! 
 “During the financial year, the company was notified by the Competent 
Authorities of Singapore and Japan on agreement reached regarding the 
Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) leading to certain adjustments relating 
to financial years ended March 31, 2002 to March 31, 2010." 
 


 
Source: F03/2008 SMC Manufacturing Singapore audited financial statements 
 
Once again cash balances, and fixed deposits were untouched while the 
suitably vague “Other receivables and prepaid expenses” got revised and
54	


Accounts/Trade payables soared to SGD103.1mn from SGD11.4mn while 
Accumulated profits/retained earnings was cut from SGD432.9mn to 
SGD355.7mn.  
Does this mean then Manufacturing Singapore’s cash balances are not 
actually from earnings but are effectively borrowings from suppliers, most 
likely the Japanese parent? 
Only SMC can really explain that and by this point investors probably won’t 
be too surprised to hear there was no disclosure in the consolidated 
accounts about the Singaporean tax debacles. 
 
We contacted the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, while they were 
unable to provide third parties with details of their rulings, we were told 
the restatements may have been due ”to records not being kept properly” 
and were to do with transfer pricing.  
 
To our amazement, Manufacturing Singapore APA issues still have not been 
settled! Disclosure in the FY03/2011 states the reason clearly 
“adjustments have resulted in a reduction of aggregate profit of the 
Company. On March 28, 2011, the Company renewed these APA for the 
period from financial year ending March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2015." 
The most logical explanation is that a large part of Manufacturing 
Singapore’s sales are NOT arms-length transactions and are therefore 
subject to this adjustment. As of its FY03/2016 filings, Singapore 
Manufacturing was attempting to extend its APA adjustment and still making 
large adjustments to its gross profit as a result. 
Moreover, as the APA adjustment is made prior to gross profit it would 
suggest that either the price for CoGs or actual unit prices in sales are not 
reflective of proper market prices

Indeed, SMC seems to run into transfer pricing issues frequently – in June 
2016 it actually disclosed(!) JPY6.6bn in additional taxes in Korea and 
another JPY1.6bn in additional taxes in Japan.  
 
Investors should not only insist SMC hire a big four auditor who is capable 
of conducting a full global audit but also demand the new auditor also 
review SMC’s tax affairs as the company has persistent issues with 
transfer pricing.

56	


APPENDIX C: UK RESTATEMENTS: A BAKER’S DOZEN 
 
Nonsensical retroactive restatements and contradictory operating metrics 
are not limited to Asia-Pacific, halfway around the world in Europe curious 
investors can dig up the UK company accounts to find them shot to bits with 
similar discrepancies and auditor changes. Even by SMC’s standards, the UK 
accounts have undergone heavy and continuous financial plastic surgery. 
 
There are at least: 
1. Two versions of the FY03/2009 accounts done by a small British 
provincial auditor - ECL Howard Watson Smith. 
The original FY03/2009 numbers and then a restatement in FY03/2011 that 
cut GBP2.25mn off (or nearly 10%) book value and instead suddenly created 
a Deferred Tax Liability of GBP2.25mn instead! That in itself should make 
investors question the quality of book value at the firm. 
2. THREE versions(!) of the FY03/2010 accounts: the ECL ‘original’ of 
that year, one attempt by ECL to correct the books in FY03/2011 and 
then another stab by Baker Tilly in FY03/2012 when they first audited 
SMC Pneumatic’s UK books for the first time. 
 
Baker Tilly’s audit ended up wiping out roughly another 10% of book value 
versus ECL’s original effort although somehow the restatements, just like in 
Singapore never affected the company’s cash balances! Baker Tilly 
reassuringly noted “material errors” in the previous year’s accounts under 
ECL. Even more conspicuous were liabilities blowing out by more than 25% 
against ECL’s original depiction. 
 
Which numbers would you like to believe? Take your pick…
57	


 
Source: SMC Pneumatics UK Ltd. Regulatory Filings FY03/2010-FY03/2012 
 
3. Two versions of the FY03/2011 accounts: the ECL ‘original’ of that year 
(in which it ironically first restated the FY03/2009 and FY03/2010) accounts 
and Baker Tilly’s attempt in FY03/2012. 
 
In keeping with SMC’s best-in-class disclosure policy there were no mentions 
of these material errors and ongoing restatements at the UK subsidiary, 
despite the operation being labeled a ‘major consolidated subsidiary’ by 
SMC. 
 
Observant investors may notice a few other interesting things about SMC 
Pneumatics UK’s financial affairs: 
a) When the UK subsidiary changed auditors to Baker Tilly in FY03/2011 
from ECL the Financial Director at the UK business also resigned. 
b) In the FY03/2014 accounts the UK subsidiary said it would propose a 
resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly as its auditor. Thankfully for investors’ 
peace of mind, SMC UK decided to switch back to ECL Howard Watson Smith 
in FY03/2015 at a new reduced rate of GBP25,000 (ECL was paid GBP42,760 
in audit fees for their last audit in FY03/2011). One would hope that 
investors are getting their money’s worth. 
  
We're still waiting on the UK subsidiary to file an auditors resignation notice
58	


with Companies House in the UK (the UK regulatory body) over this. Failure 
to file is a violation of the UK Companies Act of 2006. We think it would 
be best to file this paperwork soon… alternatively, a curious investor or 
journalist may want to access this paperwork via submitting a Norwich 
Pharmacal court order in the UK against the company. 
 
This bears repeating…  
If this is the way overseas subsidiaries audit their books how confident 
can one be in the integrity of the consolidated numbers? 
Why does SMC not use a globally recognized auditor across all its 
subsidiaries?
