Data set limited by favorable recent year trends


Low interest rates


Improving liquidity


Rising home prices


Strong economic environment


Product innovation


No payment shocks in existing data because borrowers have been able 
to refinance


Performance of securitizations benefited from required and voluntary 
removal of troubled loans


Rating Agencies assume limited historical correlation (20%-30% for sub-
prime) will hold in the future


When the credit cycle turns, correlations could approach 100%


What’s Wrong with Rating Agency Models?
14


Liquidity for ABS depends on CDO Performance

sub-prime mortgages

Poor returns for BBB / Equity CDO investors will have over 
100:1 impact on demand for securitizations of primary assets
What Has Securitization 
Wrought?
16


Business Strategy: Lend & Hold


Local S&L lends to local Home Owner


Lender has direct knowledge of borrower


Lender profits from performance of loan over time


Borrower plans to pay down mortgage over time


High transaction costs


Mortgage Lending in the Old Days
17


Originator 
“Mortgage.com” or “1-800-MORTGAGE”
Models-based issuance, questionable actuarial data


ABS
Originator recognizes income upon loan sale or securitization
Bank earns fee for underwriting ABS


CDO
Rating Agency arbitrage allows CDO originator to book profit at 
closing
CDO Manager makes nominal investment, receives recurring fees


CDO Buyers / Insurers
Ultimate risk holder relies on ratings; minimal visibility to underlying credit


Mortgage Lending Today: Lend & Securitize
18


Moral Hazard:  Everyone is paid 
up front, including the rating agencies, 


except for ultimate holder of risk


Mortgage Lending Today: Lend & Securitize
19


Rating Agencies as De Facto “Regulator” 


Source: Bear Stearns
20


Rating Agencies Are NOT Regulators


Rating Agencies are for-profit businesses
Earn fees for writing opinions


Rating Agencies have adverse incentives
Only paid if and when financing closes; ratings “shopping”
“Fairness opinion” where only paid if determined to be fair
More issuance = More fees
Structured Finance is over 40% of revenues with fees ~4x that of
traditional debt ratings


Rating Agencies have conflicts of interest
Concentrated customer base, sources of fees (Bond Insurers)
Guarantors offer lucrative career path for agency executives


Rating Agencies have reputational risk with structured finance ratings
Slow to adjust credit opinions
21


Rating Agencies Claim No Liability for Being Wrong


Distinction “…between investment advisers with a 
fiduciary relationship to their clients and those who simply 
publish impersonal commentary on some aspect of a 
security…investors [might] mistakenly assume that a 
credit rating represented advice as to whether they should 
buy, sell or hold a security, or that they could rely on a 
credit rating agency as fiduciary, neither of which is true.”

24


Already Happening in Sub-Prime


Defaults have been higher than rating agency predictions


Rating Agencies have begun to adjust models and downgrade tranches
Tighter standards for securitizations / CDOs
Acknowledging likelihood of higher than expected correlation


Lack of new ABS CDOs dramatically reduces demand for new mortgages


Banks pulling warehouse lines 


Originator bankruptcies / exiting business (~50 in last 15 months) 


Home price depreciation predicted by National Association of Realtors


Upcoming payment shock will make things worse
Borrowers can’t refinance because of tighter standards
Rising inventories and smaller pool of qualified buyers reduces 
value and liquidity of properties

Who’s Holding the Bag?
35


Who’s Holding the Bag?


First losses borne by BBB and equity investors in CDOs / 
securitizations


Combined position represents only 5-10% of total collateral


At ~9% losses, all capital through BBB is worth zero 
Moody’s currently estimating 6-8% cumulative losses for 2006 sub-
prime issuance—higher than initial expectations


Senior tranches typically guaranteed by Bond Insurers 
Bond Insurers sell credit protection on senior tranches of ABS 
& CDO securitizations


Bond Insurers and CDO Buyers perceive low risk and accept 
nominal yield
36


Who’s Holding the Bag?


Financial Guarantors are unique counterparties


They don’t put up capital.  They simply sign their name


One of few counterparties in derivatives market not 
required to post collateral on decline in value of contract


Only counterparties not required to post collateral even in 
the event of a downgrade in their credit rating

How Does MBIA Account for Wider Spreads?


Supposed to mark to market any losses on derivatives 


MBIA provides protection by selling CDS on CDO tranches


MBIA’s CDO guarantees are held to maturity and do not trade


With no market price, MBIA “marks to model”


MBIA’s internal model incorporates rating agency inputs


Rating Agencies have not downgraded senior tranches, 
therefore MBIA has not recognized any MTM losses
47


Wider CDO Spreads Will Impair Capital Base


If exposures were marked to market, slight movements in credit 
spreads would impair or eliminate MBIA’s capital base

Accelerated Revenue Recognition


MBIA’s current methodology accelerates revenue recognition 
and inflates book value


MBIA recognizes deferred premium revenue on an accelerated basis


Company claims that the appropriate method for recognizing 
deferred premium revenue is in proportion to “the expiration of 
related risk”


MBIA insures discrete, not continuous risks


MBIA effectively guarantees a stream of payments. Therefore, risk 
expires only when payments are made


New FASB Proposal, dated 4/18, requires MBIA to recognize 
revenue in proportion to risk expiration (scheduled payments), 
not the passage of time
52


MBIA Current Methodology vs. FASB Approach


Example 1: 5-year $500mm, 5% coupon debt issuance, amortizing 20% annually.  


Allocation of Premium by Year
Year 1  Year 2  Year 3 Year 4 Year 5


Premium Revenue Recognized as % of Total
Proposed Methology 21.7% 20.9% 20.0% 19.1% 18.3%
Current Methodology 45.7% 25.7% 15.7% 9.0% 4.0%
Difference -23.9% -4.8% 4.3% 10.1% 14.3%
53


Impact of FASB’s Revenue Recognition Decision


Cumulative write-down of book value


Increased leverage ratios and lower ROE 


Reduced earnings power


Reduced earnings growth rate


Adverse impact on contribution of new business


Higher P/E and book value multiples at current price
54


Moody’s Interpretation of FASB Change


“…would result in a significant deceleration of the earnings 
pattern typically seen among guarantors under existing 
accounting policies, and reduce shareholders' equity due 
to the cumulative effect adjustment necessary at adoption 
… the accounting change could result in a reduction of 
shareholders' equity in excess of 10% for some firms, with 
a similarly significant impact on GAAP net income."


Wallace Enman
Moody's Senior Accounting Analyst 


4/19/2007
55


Moving the Goal Post


Enhanced uniformity in reporting may nevertheless result in 
some guarantors' reported financial statements appearing 
stronger or weaker relative to peers than under current 
reporting standards. The implementation of the proposed 
guidance would alter reported financial leverage, coverage 
ratios and profitability metrics going forward, and as a result,
Moody's may adjust certain rating metrics to recognize the 
effect of these accounting changes on its overall 
methodology.


Moody’s Press Release
4/19/2007
56


Ongoing Fraud Investigation


Independent Investigator reviewing improper transfers of value 
from MBIA Insurance to Holding Company


In search of growth, MBIA aggressively expanded into non-traditional, 
high-risk asset classes such as defaulted property tax liens


As the value of the tax-lien portfolio deteriorated, the Holding Company 
advanced capital to meet margin calls and avoid recognizing losses


Holding Company improperly transferred losses to Insurance 
Subsidiary by causing it to guarantee bonds backed by tax liens at 
inflated valuations


MBIA has led the market to believe that investigations are 
behind them.  Independent Investigator will release initial 
findings this summer.
57


Is MBIA Prepared?


How is MBIA preparing for the deterioration in credit markets?


December 2006: Received permission from NYSID and paid $500M 
special dividend from Insurance Subsidiary to Holding Company


February 2007: Announced largest share repurchase program in 
company history ($1 Billion)


April 2007: Received permission from NYSID and paid yet another 
$500M special dividend from Insurance Subsidiary to Holding Company

Risk is Hidden in Guarantor Portfolios


Moral Hazard in the Structured Finance process combined with a 
flawed Rating Agency function has overstated credit quality for 
hundreds of billions of dollars of guaranteed bonds


Guarantors have no margin for error


Massive on- and off-balance sheet leverage


Exposure to risky, untested categories


Negligible reserves


Aggressive and fraudulent accounting


Credit Market participants believe they have transferred risk to AAA-
rated Financial Guarantors


Guarantors’ counterparties are unsecured and have no right to 
collateral even in the event of a downgrade 


When losses hit, these guarantees will have no 
value, and counterparties are left holding the bag
60


Our Recommendations


Insurance Subsidiaries are effectively insolvent in our view and
need to be recapitalized


Holding Companies must fund capital shortfall at subsidiaries


Dividends from subsidiaries to holding companies should be terminated


Removal of Executives Responsible for Fraudulent Activity
Current CEO of MBIA supervised failed investment in tax lien business 
and subsequent scheme to hide losses
Executives appear to have made false and misleading statements to 
analysts and investors


MBIA Insurance subsidiary needs independent Board of Directors
Conflict of Interests: Holding company is extracting capital from 
insurance subsidiary to fund share repurchases and special dividends
Independent Board is needed to ensure that transactions between 
holding company and insurance company are done on arms’ length 
basis
