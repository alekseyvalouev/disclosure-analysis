Celadon	Group:	Troubling	Information	About	The	JV	With	Element	And
19th	Capital	Is	Revealed
Jan.	30,	2017	10:25	AM	ET10	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Management	appears	to	have	used	the	19th	Capital	redemption	as	a	vehicle	to
significantly	inflate	CGI’s	profits	and	unfairly	enrich	itself	at	the	expense	of	CGI
shareholders.


Even	worse,	management	may	have	inappropriately	used	$26.1mm	from	CGI’s
balance	sheet	to	pay	for	this	redemption.


Management	appears	to	have	significantly	misrepresented	many	other	aspects	of	its
JV	with	Element	as	most	of	the	terms	seem	much	too	favorable	to	CGI	to	be	true.


The	Company’s	questionable	personnel	decisions	is	another	red	flag.	Several	key
finance	and	senior	management	positions	at	CGI	are	filled	with	unusually
inexperienced	individuals.


CGI’s	liquidity	situation	continues	to	deteriorate.	Also,	with	these	new	revelations,
the	chances	of	an	SEC	investigation	may	have	increased.	Thus,	I	maintain	my	price
target	of	$0.


Author's	Note:	I	intend	to	submit	the	contents	of	this	article	as	an	addendum	to	my
whistleblower	complaint	with	the	SEC.


What's	At	Stake?


The	activities	of	Celadon	Group	("CGI"	or	the	"Company")	(TICKER:	CGI)	and	its	potential
wrongdoing	is	a	matter	of	great	public	interest	to	the	investment	community.	CGI	is	a
publicly	traded	company	on	the	NYSE	with	a	market	capitalization	of	more	than	$235mm,
with	many	name-brand	institutional	investment	firms	such	as	Wellington	Management
Company,	Blackrock	Fund	Advisors,	and	T.	Rowe	Price	holding	14.0%,	7.1%	and	5.2%,
respectively,	of	its	outstanding	shares	(as	of	9/30/16).	The	clients	of	these	firms	include
many	ordinary	and	non-sophisticated	retail	investors	who	have	vouchsafed	their	life

savings	into	investment	funds	and	retirement	funds	managed	by	these	institutions.	In	my
professional	experience,	the	methods	and	activities	of	CGI	are	putting	these	investments
and	retirement	funds	at	significant	risk	for	loss.


Executive	Summary


Note	#1:	In	this	article,	the	term	"JV"	refers	specifically	to	the	newly	formed	JV	between
CGI	and	Element	announced	on	December	30 ,	2016.


Note	#2:	For	those	who	are	not	familiar	with	all	of	the	parties	and	entities	involved	in	the
CGI	story,	I	would	recommend	reading	Appendix	-	Section	1	prior	to	reading	the	Executive
Summary,	as	well	as	the	remainder	of	this	article.


Note	#3:	For	those	who	are	not	familiar	with	the	high-level	terms	of	the	JV,	I	would
recommend	reading	Appendix	-	Section	2	prior	to	prior	to	reading	the	Executive	Summary,
as	well	as	the	remainder	of	this	article.


On	December	30th,	CGI	announced	in	a	press	release	that	it	had	finally	consummated	its
proposed	JV	with	Element	Fleet	Management	("Element").	A	big	component	of	the	bull
case	for	CGI	has	been	built	around	the	closing	of	this	JV.	However,	based	on	the
information	that	I	have	uncovered,	I	believe	this	transaction	will	prove	to	be	the	Company's
and	management's	undoing.


In	this	article,	I	will	provide	evidence	which	strongly	suggests	that	management	used	the
19 	Capital	redemption	to:	(1)	inflate	CGI's	profits;	and	(2)	unfairly	enrich	itself	at
the	expense	of	CGI	shareholders.	I	will	also	disclose	evidence	that	management	may
have	inappropriately	used	cash	from	CGI's	balance	sheet	to	pay	for	this
redemption.	If	true,	then	management	has	in	my	view	committed	an	unlawful	act	that
shows	no	regard	for	shareholders.


Furthermore,	management	appears	to	have	significantly	misrepresented	many	other
aspects	of	the	JV	to	the	investment	community.	Another	issue	which	I	have	uncovered	is
CGI's	troubling	personnel	decisions.	More	specifically,	many	of	its	key	senior
management	and	finance	positions	are	filled	with	unusually	inexperienced
individuals.	Finally,	the	Company	also	appears	to	have	liquidated	most	or	all	of	its
equipment	in	order	to	consummate	the	JV.	Therefore,	its	ability	to	sell	equipment	to	keep
itself	afloat	is	limited.


In	my	view,	CGI	shares	are	"uninvestable."	Based	on	the	overwhelming	evidence	that
management	inflated	CGI's	profits	from	the	19th	Capital	transaction,	the	chances	of	an
SEC	investigation	may	have	increased.	Also,	if	management	has	inappropriately	used

CGI's	cash	to	redeem	19th	Capital's	shareholders,	additional	investigations	are	likely.
Based	on	its	current	run-rate	cash	burn	of	~$80mm,	I	continue	to	expect	the	Company
to	declare	bankruptcy	within	the	next	six	months.	Thus,	I	reiterate	my	price	target	of
$0	for	CGI	shares.


19 	Capital	was	structured	with	significant	conflicts	of	interest:	As	disclosed	in	its
December	2016	proxy,	CGI	management	held	a	significant	amount	of	Class	B	shares	in
19th	Capital.	This	presented	a	troubling	conflict	of	interest	because	management	was
incentivized	to	maximize	19th	Capital's	profits	(and	the	value	of	its	B	shares)	potentially	to
the	detriment	of	CGI	and	its	shareholders.


This	threat	is	compounded	by	the	fact	that	19th	Capital	was	largely	controlled	by	CGI
management.	For	example,	several	key	executives	of	CGI,	including	its	CEO	and	COO,
were	also	executives	at	19th	Capital.	Suspiciously,	19th	Capital	was	operated	out	of	the
same	office	building	as	Quality.	Thus,	it	is	a	reasonable	conclusion	to	say	that	CGI
management	had	almost	free	reign	to	run	19th	Capital	as	it	saw	fit.	Unfortunately,	it
appears	that	management	chose	to	run	19th	Capital	in	a	manner	that	allowed	it	to	line	its
pockets	at	the	expense	of	CGI	shareholders.


19 	Capital's	equity	value	increased	an	unusually	large	amount	in	a	short	period	of
time:	Prior	to	consummating	the	JV,	the	previous	Class	A	and	B	shareholders	of	19th
Capital	were	redeemed	with	cash.	CGI	claimed	in	its	January	6th	8K	filing	that	its	stake	in
19th	Capital	was	worth	$7.1mm	at	redemption.	This	represented	a	$5.1mm	or	255%
increase	from	the	$2.0mm	investment	it	made	in	September	2015.


Based	on	the	value	of	CGI's	stake,	19th	Capital's	implied	equity	value	at	redemption	was
$26.1mm.	This	represented	a	$20.1mm	or	235%	increase	from	the	initial	$6.0mm	that	was
invested	by	CGI	and	Larsen	MacColl	Partners.	Thus,	based	on	the	information	provided
by	the	Company,	19th	Capital	generated	$20.1mm	of	profits	from	its	Quality	equipment	in
just	~1.25	years.	This	exponential	increase	in	value	is	miraculous	in	the	context	of	the
current	market	environment.


Management	appears	to	have	fabricated	the	value	of	19 	Capital:	The	value	of	CGI's
stake	in	19th	Capital	at	redemption	contradicts	its	own	financial	reports.	CGI	reported	that
its	19th	Capital	stake	was	worth	just	$2.4mm	as	of	9/30/16.	This	is	almost	$5mm	less	than
the	$7.1mm	it	claims	to	have	received	from	the	redemption	just	three	months	later.


Furthermore,	confidential	sources	in	the	truck	leasing	industry	emphatically	told	me	that
19th	Capital	could	not	have	possibly	earned	such	large	profits.	Also,	given	the	historically
sharp	decline	in	used	tractor	prices	at	the	time,	19th	Capital	almost	certainly	should	have

taken	a	loss	from	the	decline	in	its	equipment	value.


For	these,	as	well	as	many	other	reasons,	19th	Capital's	equity	value	should	have	been
virtually	worthless	at	redemption,	leading	me	to	the	conclusion	that	management	appears
to	have	fabricated	the	value	of	this	entity.


By	seemingly	overstating	19 	Capital's	value,	management	inflated	CGI's	profits
and	enriched	itself:	Management's	motivation	for	inflating	19th	Capital's	value	appears	to
have	been	two-fold.	First,	it	was	able	to	inflate	CGI's	profits	by	$7.1mm.	The	Company
should	have	likely	realized	a	$2.0mm	loss	from	the	write	down	of	its	investment.	However,
by	inflating	19th	Capital's	value,	it	was	able	to	report	a	$5.1mm	gain	instead.	This	provided
CGI	with	some	much-needed	incremental	cushion	under	its	debt	covenants.


Second,	management	pocketed	millions	of	dollars	by	inflating	19th	Capital's	value.	As
shown	in	the	table	below,	management	collectively	owned	27%	of	19	th	Capital's
outstanding	B	shares	(includes	B	shares	of	the	management	teams	of	CGI,	Quality	&	19th
Capital).	Thus,	management	personally	pocketed	around	$5mm	from	the	redemption
when	it	probably	should	not	have	received	anything.


Management	may	have	inappropriately	used	CGI	cash	for	the	redemption:	In	its
December	30th	press	release	announcing	the	JV,	CGI	claimed	that	19th	Capital	paid	for
the	redemption	with	pre-existing	cash	on	the	balance	sheet.	However,	this	does	seem
possible	given	that	19th	Capital	was	likely	a	loss-making	business.


So	how	did	19th	Capital	obtain	the	cash	needed	to	complete	this	transaction?	It	is
possible	that	management	paid	for	the	19th	Capital	redemption	with	$26.1mm	of	cash	that
belonged	to	CGI	shareholders.	Thus,	management	appears	to	have	used	CGI	as	a	piggy
bank	to	enrich	itself,	as	well	as	other	19th	Capital	owners,	at	the	expense	of	CGI
shareholders.	This	type	of	behavior	by	management,	if	true,	would	most	likely	be	unlawful
if	not	a	significant	breach	of	fiduciary	duty.

Many	other	aspects	of	the	JV	appear	to	have	been	misrepresented:	Unfortunately	for
CGI	shareholders,	the	19th	Capital	scheme	represents	just	the	tip	of	the	iceberg	in
regards	to	my	concerns	over	the	JV.	From	my	analysis,	I	have	identified	numerous	red
flags	which	indicate	that	CGI	has	misrepresented	many	other	aspects	of	its	JV	with
Element.	These	red	flags	include	the	Company's	claim	that	it	had	miraculously	disposed	of
its	Quality	equipment	at	book	value.	This	also	includes	the	apparent	attempts	by
management	to	hide	Element's	contribution	to	the	JV	from	the	investing	public.


CGI	has	filled	key	finance	and	senior	management	positions	with	inexperienced
individuals:	In	addition	to	my	concerns	over	the	JV,	I	have	also	discovered	a	number	of
red	flags	related	to	the	Company's	personnel	decisions.


The	biggest	big	red	flag	I	have	identified	is	that	numerous	key	finance	and	senior
management	positions	at	CGI	are	filled	by	unusually	inexperienced	individuals	given
industry	standards	and	in	comparison	with	peer	companies.	This	further	adds	to	the
concerns	over	the	Company's	accounting	methods	and	places	further	doubt	on	its	ability
to	recover	from	the	current	downturn.	Provided	in	the	table	below	are	numerous	examples
of	the	inexperience	of	key	personnel	at	CGI:


The	Company's	liquidity	situation	has	further	deteriorated:	At	this	point,	it	appears
that	the	situation	at	CGI	has	become	unsalvageable.	For	starters,	the	Company	continues
to	burn	cash	at	an	alarming	rate.	Based	on	information	provided	in	its	January	6th	8K
filing,	it	appears	that	CGI	generated	a	FCF	loss	of	~$20M	in	Q2	2017.	This	represents	a
FCF	loss	of	~$80mm	on	an	annualized	basis.	Moreover,	following	the	consummation	of
the	JV,	the	Company	has	little	to	no	equipment	remaining	that	it	can	sell	for	liquidity.
Finally,	lenders	have	decreased	their	commitments	to	CGI	from	$300mm	to	$250mm	and
to	this	point	have	not	renegotiated	covenants.


Thus,	based	on	its	current	cash	burn	and	limited	means	to	raise	cash,	the	Company	likely
only	has	a	few	months	remaining	before	it	becomes	insolvent.

The	risk	of	a	formal	SEC	investigation	seems	heightened:	Finally,	the	chances	of	an
eventual	SEC	investigation	appears	to	have	increased,	given	that	these	are	precisely	the
kinds	of	activities	that	the	SEC	routinely	investigates.	CGI	management	may	have	shot
itself	in	the	foot	with	the	19th	Capital	redemption	as	the	evidence	of	profit	inflation	from
this	transaction	appears	obvious.	Also,	if	true,	management's	inappropriate	use	of	CGI
cash	to	pay	for	the	redemption	would	be	an	unlawful	act	leading	to	additional
investigations.


Section	1:	Quick	Background	on	the	Story	So	Far


Over	the	past	six	months,	I	have	published	several	articles	on	CGI	(	here,	here,	here	and
here),	highlighting	a	number	of	red	flags	related	to	the	Company's	financial	reporting	and
business	practices.	Based	on	my	analysis,	I	concluded	that	the	Company	was	using
irregular	accounting	methods	to	inflate	its	profits	and	mislead	investors.


The	strongest	piece	of	evidence	that	I	previously	disclosed	in	support	of	that	conclusion
was	a	recent	September	2016	tractor	swap	between	Quality	and	Stoops	Freightliner
("Stoops"),	a	large	truck	dealership	located	in	the	Midwest.	Based	on	the	evidence	I
obtained,	and	weighed	against	acceptable	accounting	practices,	the	tractor	swap	should
have	resulted	in	a	large	loss	for	CGI	in	Q1	2017.	However,	for	some	reason,	CGI	did	not
include	this	transaction	in	its	financial	statements.


In	doing	further	research,	it	appears	that	things	have	continued	to	deteriorate	for	CGI,	and
its	investors	are	at	an	even	higher	risk	than	previously	reported…


Section	2:	A	Summary	of	the	19 	Capital	Scheme


On	December	30th,	CGI	announced	that	it	had	consummated	its	proposed	JV	agreement
with	Element.	I	believe	that	CGI	management	has	grossly	misrepresented	many	aspects
of	the	JV	to	shareholders.	Most	of	the	terms	of	this	transaction	make	little	sense	and	seem
much	too	favorable	to	CGI	to	be	true.	That	being	said,	I	will	lead	off	my	discussion	of	the
JV	by	focusing	on	the	most	concerning	aspect	of	this	transaction:	the	redemption	of	19th
Capital's	shareholders.


Just	prior	to	the	JV	consummation,	19th	Capital,	an	entity	jointly	owned	by	CGI	and
Larsen	MacColl	Partners,	was	dissolved.	As	part	of	the	19th	Capital	dissolution,	the
existing	Class	A	and	B	shareholders	of	19th	Capital	were	redeemed	with	cash.
Unfortunately,	based	on	my	analysis,	I	believe	that	management	has	committed
unlawful	actions	in	order	to	complete	the	redemption	of	19 	Capital's	shareholders.


A	summary	of	the	troubling	aspects	of	the	redemption	are	provided	below:

CGI	appears	to	have	fabricated	the	equity	value	of	19th	Capital.	My	analysis	indicates
that	the	equity	value	of	19th	Capital	was	worthless	at	redemption.	However,
management	valued	the	equity	of	this	entity	at	$26.1mm.	This	represented	a	335%
increase	from	the	initial	$6mm	invested	by	CGI	($2.0mm)	and	Larsen	Maccoll	Partners
($4.0mm)	in	September	2015.
By	overstating	19th	Capital's	value,	CGI	appears	to	have	inflated	its	profits	by	$7.1mm.
If	the	Company's	stake	in	19th	Capital	was	likely	worthless,	it	follows	to	reason	that	the
Company	should	have	reported	a	$2mm	loss	from	the	write	down	of	this	investment.
Instead,	management	reported	a	$5.1mm	gain.	This	further	calls	into	question
management's	questionable	accounting	practices.
Also,	by	inflating	19th	Capital's	value,	management	was	able	to	pocket	millions	of
dollars.	The	management	teams	of	CGI,	Quality	and	19th	Capital	collectively	owned
27%	of	19th	Capital's	B	shares.	As	a	result,	these	same	people	pocketed	more	than
$5mm	from	the	redemption.
The	most	concerning	aspect	of	this	transaction	was	how	CGI	management	obtained
the	cash	needed	to	consummate	the	redemption.	Based	upon	information	I	received
from	multiple	sources,	including	an	individual	who	claims	to	be	a	current	CGI
employee,	it	appears	that	this	cash	came	directly	from	CGI.
Based	on	point	#4	above,	it	appears	that	management	took	money	that	rightfully
belonged	to	CGI	and	funneled	it	into	19th	Capital	to	pay	for	the	redemption.	If	true,	key
management	used	CGI	as	a	piggy	bank	to	enrich	themselves,	as	well	as	other	19th
Capital	owners,	at	the	expense	of	CGI	shareholders.
Also	if,	as	I	suspect,	management	used	$26.1mm	of	the	Company's	cash	to	pay	for	the
redemption,	then	this	transaction	has	destroyed	a	significant	amount	of	value	for	CGI
shareholders.	Thus,	it	appears	that	management's	behavior	and	the	Company's
situation	are	much	worse	than	what	I	described	in	previous	articles.


Section	3:	19 	Capital's	Troubling	Management	and	Ownership	Structure


In	this	section,	I	will	discuss	the	troubling	management	and	ownership	structure	of	19th
Capital.	CGI	management	owned	a	significant	amount	of	Class	B	shares	in	19th	Capital.
As	a	result,	there	appeared	to	be	a	troubling	conflict	of	interest	where	management	was
incentivized	to	maximize	19th	Capital's	profits	potentially	at	the	expense	of	CGI
shareholders.	This	worry	was	compounded	by	the	fact	that	19th	Capital	was	largely
controlled	by	CGI.	Thus,	CGI	management	had	almost	free	reign	to	run	19th	Capital	for	its
own	benefit.

The	background	on	the	formation	of	19th	Capital	has	to	be	examined	here.	In	September
2015,	CGI	partnered	with	Larsen	MacColl	Partners	(a	private	equity	firm)	to	form	a
financing	entity	called	19th	Capital.	The	primary	purpose	of	19th	Capital's	establishment
was	to	provide	another	dedicated	buyer	for	Quality's	purchased	trucks.


19th	Capital	was	initially	funded	with	a	$2mm	equity	contribution	from	CGI	and	a	$4mm
contribution	from	Larsen	MacColl.	Based	on	their	respective	contributions,	Larsen	MacColl
was	given	66.7%	ownership	of	19th	Capital's	Class	A	shares,	while	CGI	was	given	the
remaining	33.3%.	In	addition	to	Class	A	shares,	incentive	units	were	distributed	to	various
parties	in	the	form	of	Class	B	shares.


Due	to	concerns	over	how	19th	Capital	was	structured,	CGI	received	a	significant	amount
of	pushback	from	some	shareholders	when	this	entity	was	initially	setup.	In	fact,	according
to	at	least	one	analyst	who	covers	the	Company,	shareholders	were	so	concerned	that
they	engaged	in	a	proxy	battle	with	management	(contact	details	redacted):


The	pushback	from	shareholders	is	not	surprising.	As	I	just	mentioned,	19th	Capital	was
structured	in	a	way	that	presented	potential	conflicts	of	interest	for	CGI	management.	To
help	illustrate	this	point,	I	have	provided	below	an	ownership	diagram	of	19th	Capital:


As	highlighted	in	the	above	diagram,	management	collectively	owned	27%	of	the
outstanding	B	shares.	Note	that	19th	Capital	was	largely	managed	by	executives	of	CGI.
Thus,	19th	Capital	management's	B	shares	have	been	included	in	this	total.

Class	B	shares	were	entitled	to	a	portion	of	19th	Capital's	profits	above	a	return	threshold.
The	specific	manner	in	which	the	Class	B	shareholders	were	compensated	was	described
in	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	19	of	CGI's	latest	proxy	filing:


"Generally,	any	distributions	are	paid	first	to	the	Class	A	members	up	to	an	amount
equal	to	their	respective	capital	contributions,	plus	a	Class	A	preferred	return	of	12%
per	annum	of	their	respective	capital	contributions,	then	to	the	Class	B	members	in
accordance	with	their	percentage	interests."


To	summarize	the	above,	Class	A	shareholders	(Larsen	MacColl	-	67%,	CGI	-	33%)	were
entitled	to	any	capital	distributions	up	to	a	12%	annual	return	threshold.	Any	amount	of
19th	Capital's	profits	above	the	12%	threshold	are	then	distributed	to	Class	B
shareholders.	As	an	example,	if	19th	Capital	purchased	$100	worth	of	trucks	and
generated	$50	of	profit	from	these	purchases,	$12	($100	of	purchases	*	12%	return)
would	go	to	Class	A	shareholders	while	the	remaining	$38	($50	of	profit	-	$12	Class	A
return)	would	be	split	amongst	the	Class	B	shareholders.


Because	it	owned	a	large	portion	of	the	profit	interests,	CGI	management	was
incentivized	to	maximize	the	value	of	19 	Capital	potentially	at	the	expense	of	CGI
shareholders.


Compounding	this	worry	was	the	large	degree	of	control	that	CGI	had	over	19th	Capital.
For	example,	19 	Capital's	management	team	was	comprised	of	several	CGI
executives.	As	disclosed	in	a	September	2015	8K	filing,	this	included	Paul	Will	(CGI
CEO)	and	William	Meek	(CGI	COO):


"Messrs.	Will	and	Meek	will	serve	as	two	of	the	managers	of	19th	Capital."


In	addition	to	Mr.	Will	and	Mr.	Meek,	I	learned	that	there	are	at	least	two	other	CGI
employees	who	simultaneously	served	as	executives	at	19th	Capital.	One	source	who
claims	to	be	a	current	CGI	employee	sent	me	the	following	message	(contact	details
redacted):

Based	on	his	Linkedin	profile	(found	here),	Mr.	Chasteen	served	as	President	of	19th
Capital	while	also	holding	the	title	of	President	of	International	Business	at	CGI.	Mr.
Zoeller's	Linkedin	account	appears	to	have	been	deleted,	so	I	could	not	confirm	his
background.


Another	indication	that	19th	Capital	was	largely	controlled	by	CGI	is	the	fact	that	19
Capital	shared	the	same	office	building	as	Quality.	On	their	corporate	website	(	here
and	here),	both	19th	Capital	and	Quality	listed	the	same	address	for	their	headquarters
(9702	East	30	th	Street,	Indianapolis,	IN).


Because	CGI	and	19th	Capital	are	so	closely	intertwined,	CGI	management	had	almost
free	reign	to	use	19th	Capital	at	its	will.	As	discussed	above,	there	was	a	great	deal	of
concern	amongst	investors	that	management	would	use	this	free	reign	to	enrich	itself	via
its	B	shares.	This	concern	appears	to	have	been	warranted.


Section	4:	The	Curiously	Large	Profits	of	19 	Capital


When	reading	the	January	6th	8K	filing	describing	the	JV,	the	biggest	red	flag	that	jumped
out	at	me	was	the	following:


"Under	the	Redemption	Agreement,	the	Company	received	the	following
consideration:	(i.)	approximately$4.6	million	in	cash,	and	(ii.)	the	right	to	receive
approximately	an	additional	$2.5	million	in	restricted	cash	when	the	restrictions
lapse."


As	described	above,	CGI	claims	that	it	received	$7.1mm	of	cash	($4.6mm	upfront,
$2.5mm)	from	the	redemption	of	its	33.3%	and	25.0%	ownership	stakes	in	the	Class	A
and	Class	B	shares,	respectively.	This	represented	a	return	of	255%	on	the	initial
investment	it	made	in	19th	Capital	at	inception	(September	2015).	My	immediate	reaction

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 11/38


to	this	claim	was	disbelief.	How	did	CGI	manage	to	make	such	a	large	return	on	its
investment?	It	did	not	seem	possible	that	19th	Capital	could	have	increased	its	equity
value	by	such	a	large	amount	under	such	difficult	market	conditions.


Based	on	the	return	that	CGI	received	on	its	investment	in	19th	Capital,	I	calculated	the
implied	equity	value	of	19th	Capital:


As	shown	above,	based	on	the	$7.1mm	that	CGI	received	from	its	$2mm	investment,	the
implied	equity	value	of	19th	Capital	at	redemption	was	$26.1mm.	Thus,	in	the	span	of
1.25	years,	19 	Capital	generated	a	net	profit	of	$20.1mm	and	increased	its	equity
value	335%	from	$6mm	to	$26.1mm!


Further	adding	to	my	disbelief	was	the	following	disclosure	from	the	Company's	press
release	announcing	the	JV:


"The	former	owners	of	19th	Capital	(including	Celadon's	former	Class	A	and	Class
B	interests)	were	redeemed	using	pre-transaction	cash	of	19th	Capital…"


According	to	the	above	statement,	the	shareholders	of	19th	Capital	were	redeemed	using
pre-existing	cash	on	the	balance	sheet.	So,	not	only	did	19th	Capital	manage	to	generate
a	$20.1mm	profit,	but	it	also	managed	to	accumulate	$26.1mm	of	cash	in	a	little	over	a
year.


The	point	that	readers	should	take	away	from	this	section	is	that	19th	Capital's	equity
value	and	cash	balance	increased	an	unusually	large	amount	in	a	short	period	of	time.
This,	in	turn,	allowed	CGI	and	other	shareholders	in	19th	Capital	(including	management)
to	realize	a	substantial	gain	from	the	redemption.

CGI's	claim	that	19th	Capital	earned	$20.1mm	in	such	a	short	period	of	time	is	simply
absurd.	Based	on	the	evidence,	it	appears	that	19th	Capital's	profits	and	equity	value	were
fabricated.	In	fact,	according	to	my	analysis,	19 	Capital	was	actually	a	loss-making
business.	Thus,	its	equity	should	have	been	worth	considerably	less	than	$26.1mm
and	was	most	likely	worthless.	I	have	listed	below	a	number	of	reasons	why	I	believe
such:


First,	and	most	damning,	the	exponential	increase	in	19th	Capital's	equity	value	directly
contradicts	the	information	in	CGI's	financial	statements.	The	following	is	from	the
Company's	reported	balance	sheet	on	pg.	5	of	its	Q1	2017	10Q:


As	highlighted	above,	the	Company	was	valuing	its	stake	in	19th	Capital	at	$2.4mm	as	of
9/30/16.	This	is	almost	$5mm	less	than	the	$7.1mm	valuation	it	claims	to	have	received	at
redemption	just	three	months	later	(12/30/16).


Also,	consider	that	a	$2.4mm	valuation	for	CGI's	stake	translates	to	an	implied	equity
value	of	$7.4mm	for	19th	Capital.	Thus,	the	claim	that	19th	Capital	was	worth	$26.1mm	at
redemption	implies	that	its	profit	in	just	three	months	(from	9/30/16	to	12/31/16)	was
$18.7mm!	This	does	not	seem	possible.


Second,	a	source	who	claims	to	own	a	sizable	truck	leasing	business	told	me	in	no
uncertain	terms	that	19th	Capital's	claimed	profits	are	not	possible	(contact	details
redacted):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 13/38


Third,	19th	Capital	only	purchased	$119.3mm	of	equipment	from	Quality,	with	most	of
these	purchases	occurring	in	Q4	2016	and	Q1	2017.	Generating	a	$20.1mm	profit	on
such	a	small	asset	base	in	such	a	short	period	of	time	does	not	seem	plausible	or
possible.


Fourth,	used	tractor	prices	have	declined	significantly	over	the	past	year.	Therefore,	19th
Capital	should	have	experienced	a	significant	loss	from	this	decline	in	asset	value.


Fifth,	as	disclosed	on	pg.	66	of	its	FY	2016	10K,	CGI	recognized	a	$2.3mm	gain	from	the
sale	of	$58.8mm	of	equipment	to	19th	Capital.	The	remaining	$60.5mm	of	equipment
purchased	by	19th	Capital	was	purchased	at	book	value.	This	means	that,	overall,	19th
Capital	paid	a	premium	to	book	value	for	its	equipment.	Thus,	it	cannot	claim	that	its	gains
were	the	result	of	a	discount.


Sixth,	Element	has	experienced	massive	losses	from	its	Quality	portfolio	over	the	past
year.	Given	this	fact,	it	is	highly	unlikely	that	19th	Capital's	Quality	portfolio	could	have
been	so	hugely	profitable	over	the	same	period.


Seventh,	it	appears	that	19th	Capital	was	charging	a	well	below	market	rate	to	its	lessees.
A	couple	months	ago,	I	received	a	bearish	report	on	CGI	that	was	written	in	late	2015	by
someone	involved	in	the	truck	leasing	industry.	I	have	posted	the	first	two	pages	of	his
report	(with	contact	details	and	certain	information	redacted)	here.

In	his	report,	he	noted	that	Quality	was	leasing	new,	$140K	tractors	for	$200	less	per
month	than	what	his	company	was	charging	for	a	used,	$50K	tractor.	Given	the	difficulties
that	his	business	was	having	turning	a	profit,	he	was	puzzled	as	to	how	Quality	could
charge	so	much	less	and	still	make	the	economics	work.


Lastly,	it	does	not	appear	mathematically	possible	for	19th	Capital	to	have	generated	the
profits	it	is	claiming.	Provided	below	is	my	calculation	of	the	monthly	lease	rate	19th
Capital	would	have	to	charge	to	achieve	$20.1mm	of	profit:


Assuming	conservative	expenses	and	100%	tractor	utilization,	I	estimate	that	19
Capital	would	have	to	charge	its	lessees	$5,322	per	month	per	tractor	to	earn
$20.1mm!	Assuming	a	more	realistic	utilization	of	60%,	the	required	monthly	rate
would	be	even	higher	at	$8,661.	Obviously,	these	are	not	realistic	rates	in	any
environment.(Note:	I	have	provided	a	more	detailed	calculation	of	the	above	P&L	in
Section	3	of	the	Appendix.)


To	further	illustrate	my	point,	I	have	calculated	19th	Capital's	profits	based	on	the	current
rate	it	appears	to	be	charging.	Quality	charges	around	$2,300	for	a	2016	model	year
tractor.	This,	by	extension,	means	that	19th	Capital	is	likely	charging	a	similar	rate	to	its
lessees.	(As	a	refresher,	Quality	manages	the	leasing	program	for	19th	Capital.)

Assuming	the	same	expenses	as	in	the	prior	table	and	a	monthly	rate	of	$2,300	per
month,	I	have	provided	my	estimate	of	19th	Capital's	net	profit.	As	shown	below,	in	both	a
100%	and	60%	utilization	scenario,	19th	Capital's	revenue	does	not	even	exceed
$20.1mm,	much	less	its	profits.


Section	6:	19 	Capital	as	a	Vehicle	to	Inflate	Profits	and	Enrich	Management


So,	what	would	motivate	CGI	management	to	fabricate	the	equity	value	and	profits	of	19th
Capital?


First,	by	doing	so,	management	was	able	to	pocket	millions	of	dollars	from	the
redemption	of	its	B	shares	in	19 	Capital.	In	addition	to	this,	by	seemingly	inflating	the
value	of	19th	Capital,	CGI	was	able	to	recognize	a	gain	instead	of	a	loss.	This	will	provide
a	boost	to	the	Company's	upcoming	Q2	2017	results	and	some	much-needed	covenant
relief.


So	just	how	much	money	did	management	pocket	from	this	transaction?	Quite	a	bit.
Collectively,	the	managements	teams	of	CGI,	Quality	and	19th	Capital	owned	27%	of	the
Class	B	units.	As	I	calculated	in	Section	3,	I	estimate	that	Class	B	shareholders	received	a
total	of	$19.2mm	from	this	transaction.	Based	on	this	amount,	I	calculated	how	these
proceeds	were	divided	amongst	the	Class	B	shareholders:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 16/38


As	highlighted	above,	CGI,	Quality	and	19th	Capital	management	received	$2.7mm,
$1.7mm,	and	$0.8mm	respectively.	Thus,	in	total,	management	received	$5.2mm	from	this
transaction.	That	is	a	substantial	amount	of	money	to	split	amongst	a	few	people.


For	example,	the	following	is	a	breakdown	of	how	much	Paul	Will	(CGI	CEO),	William
Meek	(CGI	COO)	and	Bobby	Peavler	(CGI	CFO)	pocketed	from	the	redemption:


As	shown	above,	Mr.	Will,	Mr.	Meek	and	Mr.	Peavler	collectively	pocketed	$1.9mm
from	the	redemption!	Given	how	short	19th	Capital's	operating	history	was,	this	is	an
absurd	amount	of	money.


The	amount	that	management	was	able	to	inflate	CGI's	profits	from	the	redemption
was	also	significant.	CGI	realized	a	$5.1mm	gain	from	the	redemption	of	its	ownership
stake	in	19th	Capital	($7.1mm	redemption	-	$2.0mm	initial	investment).	However,	based
on	the	analysis	I	provided	in	the	previous	section,	it	appears	the	Company's	entire
$2.0mm	investment	in	the	entity	should	have	been	written	off.	This	write	down	should
have	resulted	in	CGI	realizing	a	$2.0mm	loss	instead	of	a	$5.1mm	gain.


Thus,	I	believe	that	management	has	overstated	CGI's	profits	from	the	redemption	of	its
19th	Capital	stake	by	as	much	as	$7.1mm.The	fact	that	management	has	likely	used	the
redemption	as	a	vehicle	to	inflate	its	profits	is	not	surprising.	As	I	discussed	at	length	in
previous	articles,	I	believe	that	management	has	consistently	misrepresented	its	financial
performance	to	investors	over	the	past	year.


Section	7:	Where	Did	19 	Capital's	Cash	Come	From?th

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 17/38


Unfortunately,	I	also	believe	that	CGI	management	inappropriately	took	cash	from
CGI's	balance	sheet	to	pay	for	the	$26.1mm	redemption	of	19 	Capital.	If	true,	this	is
a	concerning	breach	of	fiduciary	duty	and	a	significant	destruction	of	shareholder	value:
$26.1mm	represents	11.5%	of	the	Company's	current	market	capitalization	of	$227.1mm
(as	of	1/27/17).


The	evidence	in	support	of	my	conclusion	is	listed	below.


First,	19th	Capital	likely	did	not	have	much	(if	any)	cash	on	its	balance	sheet	to	pay	for
the	redemption.	As	a	refresher,	in	its	December	30th	press	release	announcing	the	JV,
CGI	claimed	that	19th	Capital	paid	for	the	redemption	with	pre-existing	cash	on	its	balance
sheet:


"The	former	owners	of	19th	Capital	(including	Celadon's	former	Class	A	and	Class	B
interests)	were	redeemed	using	pre-transaction	cash	of	19th	Capital…"


The	above	claim	does	not	seem	even	remotely	possible.	Based	on	my	analysis	in	Section
5,	19th	Capital	was	likely	a	loss-making	business.	Therefore,	it	does	not	seem	possible	it
could	have	accumulated	such	a	huge	amount	of	cash.


Second,	according	to	multiple	sources,	Quality	was	frantically	liquidating	equipment
toward	the	end	of	2016.	They	noted	that	Quality	was	telling	vendors	this	equipment	had	to
be	purchased	before	January	1 ,	2017.	One	individual	also	noted	that	Quality	was	so
desperate	that	it	was	"begging"	vendors	to	buy	its	equipment.	The	fact	that	the	Company
was	giving	vendors	a	deadline	of	January	1st	is	very	telling:	it	indicates	that	cash	was
needed	to	close	the	JV	which	was	consummated	on	December	30th.	I	have	provided
more	detail	on	this	third	point	below.

be	a	current	CGI	employee	(contact	details	redacted):

The	fact	that	CGI	was	scrambling	to	raise	cash	from	equipment	sales	by	January	1st
simply	makes	no	sense.	The	reason	is	that	the	Company	claims	to	have	netted	$57.8mm
of	cash	from	the	JV	consummation.


Based	on	the	large	amount	of	cash	it	netted	from	the	JV,	CGI	clearly	should	not	have
needed	to	raise	cash	before	the	end	of	the	year.	Let	me	make	that	point	one	more	time
with	emphasis…THERE	WAS	NO	NEED	FOR	CGI	TO	RAISE	CASH	BEFORE	THE	END

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 19/38


OF	THE	YEAR!	This	inconsistency	between	the	Company's	actual	behavior	versus	what
was	disclosed	in	the	JV	agreement	sends	up	an	immediate	red	flag.


So	why	was	CGI	desperately	raising	cash	before	the	end	of	the	year?	Based	on	the
January	1st	deadline	it	was	giving	vendors,	I	see	no	logical	reason	other	than	this	cash
was	needed	to	consummate	the	JV.	More	specifically,	this	cash	was	likely	needed	to	fund
the	$26.1mm	19th	Capital	redemption.


Third,	CGI	appears	to	be	the	only	logical	source	for	the	cash	needed	for	the	redemption.
The	only	other	party	involved	in	the	19th	Capital	redemption	is	Larsen	MacColl	Partners.	I
cannot	imagine	that	Larsen	MacColl	is	so	generous	/	stupid	that	it	would	willingly	give
away	millions	of	dollars	for	the	benefit	of	CGI	and	its	management	team.	Said	more
simply,	Larsen	MacColl	had	no	incentive	to	give	19th	Capital	cash.


There	was,	however,	plenty	of	incentive	for	CGI's	management	team	to	use	cash	from
CGI's	balance	sheet	to	pay	for	the	redemption.	These	reasons	have	been	discussed	at
length	in	this	article	(i.e.	inflating	CGI's	profits	to	avoid	a	covenant	breach,	lining
management's	pocket).	Thus,	by	applying	common	sense,	it	seems	possible	that	CGI
supplied	19th	Capital's	cash.


Lastly,	an	individual	who	claims	to	be	a	current	CGI	employee	agreed	with	my
assessment	that	the	cash	for	the	19th	Capital	redemption	most	likely	came	from	CGI's

Section	9:	A	Request	for	Management


Given	all	the	serious	issues	I	have	raised	about	the	19th	Capital	redemption,	I	think	that
CGI	management	needs	to	provide	more	clarity	to	the	investing	public	about	this
transaction.


This	includes:	(1)	providing	information	on	how	19th	Capital	realized	such	a	large	profit;
and	(2)	clarifying	the	source	of	cash	for	the	redemption.	This	disclosure	should	include	a
detailed	P&L	and	cash	flow	statement	for	19th	Capital,	as	well	as	a	table	or	diagram
outlining	the	sources	and	uses	of	cash.	Ideally,	these	documents	would	be	verified	by	an
independent	third	party.


I	made	repeated	calls	to	the	offices	of	Larsen	MacColl	Partners	in	an	attempt	to	learn
more	about	the	19th	Capital	redemption.	I	spoke	briefly	with	Chris	Davis,	a	partner	at	the
firm.	He	was	unwilling	to	provide	me	with	any	further	details.


Section	10:	Most	of	the	Terms	of	the	JV	are	Too	Good	to	be	True

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 22/38


Unfortunately	for	CGI	shareholders,	my	concerns	over	the	JV	do	not	end	with	the
redemption	of	19th	Capital.	As	I	will	discuss	in	this	section,	I	believe	that	most	of	the
terms	of	the	JV	are	much	too	favorable	to	the	Company	to	be	true.	Almost	every
aspect	of	this	transaction,	as	outlined	in	the	8K,	miraculously	worked	out	in	the	favor	of
CGI.	Based	on	the	fact	that	almost	nothing	about	this	deal	adds	up,	it	is	hard	to	trust
anything	CGI	management	disclosed	about	the	JV	terms.


In	order	to	consummate	this	deal,	CGI	had	to	dispose	of	$162.5mm	of	Quality	equipment,
redeem	its	19th	Capital	ownership	and	contribute	$100mm	of	net	assets	to	the	JV.	The
gain	or	loss	from	each	of	these	transactions	is	provided	below:


Quality	Equipment	Disposal:	No	gain	or	loss	due	to	sale	at	book	value
19th	Capital	Redemption:	$5.1mm	gain
$100mm	Net	Contribution	to	JV:	No	gain	or	loss	due	booking	of	$100mm	minority
investment


Based	on	the	above,	CGI	was	able	to	actually	report	a	$5.1mm	gain	from	the	JV
consummation!	On	top	of	this,	the	Company	claims	that	it	actually	netted	$57.8mm	of
cash,	primarily	from	the	sale	of	equipment	to	Element.


The	fact	that	management	was	able	to	work	out	such	advantageous	terms	is	miraculous
considering	the	tough	situation	they	were	in.	The	Company	was	in	a	very	weak	negotiating
position	due	to	the	large	amount	of	lease	shortfall	payments	it	owed	to	Element	on	an
ongoing	basis.


Thus,	in	addition	to	misrepresenting	the	19th	Capital	redemption,	I	believe	that
management	has	materially	misrepresented	a	number	of	other	aspects	of	the	JV	to	the
investment	community.	Listed	below	are	several	red	flags	in	support	of	this	conclusion:


Red	Flag	#1:	$50mm	Equipment	Purchase	by	Element	Does	Not	Add	Up


In	its	press	release	announcing	the	JV,	CGI	disclosed	that	it	had	sold	$50.0mm	of
equipment	held	for	sale	to	Element	at	book	value:


"…Celadon	received	approximately	$50	million	in	cash	proceeds	from	the	sale	of
equipment	associated	with	the	Quality	business	at	net	book	value	for	use	by	the
joint	venture…"


This	claim	by	CGI	is	hard	to	believe	for	a	number	of	reasons.
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Troubling Information About The JV With Element And 19th Capital Is Revealed - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 23/38


First,	it	is	hard	to	believe	that	Element	would	want	to	continue	investing	in	a	money	losing
business.	It	is	clear	that	purchasing	trucks	from	Quality	has	been	a	losing	proposition.
Over	the	past	year,	CGI	has	paid	over	$100mm	of	reserve	liability	and	lease	shortfall
payments	to	reimburse	Element	for	its	losses.	Also,	the	used	truck	market	is	not	expected
to	recover	for	several	years	because	of	a	huge	inventory	hangover.	Given	these	facts,
Element's	additional	equipment	purchase	makes	no	sense.


It	is	even	harder	to	believe	that	Element	would	actually	purchase	equipment	from	CGI	at
book	value.	The	reason	is	that	Element	could	have	simply	purchased	tractors	in	the	open
market	at	a	much	lower	price.


Based	on	a	significant	amount	of	evidence,	the	book	value	of	CGI's	tractors	is	significantly
inflated	relative	to	their	market	value.	It	is	well-known	that	used	tractor	prices	have
collapsed	over	the	past	year.	In	addition	to	this,	CGI	does	not	depreciate	any	of	its
equipment	held	for	sale	that	is	unleased.	The	following	disclosure	is	from	pg.	52	of	the
Company's	FY	2016	10K:


"Leased	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	is	depreciated	during	months	the
assets	are	under	leases."


"Revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	is	recorded	at	the	lower	of	carrying	value	and	fair
market	value	less	costs	to	sell.	The	Company	also	ceases	the	depreciation	on
these	assets."


According	to	an	analyst	that	covers	CGI,	around	40%	of	Quality's	equipment	was
unleased	as	of	November	2016.	Therefore,	it	is	likely	that	a	large	portion	of	the	equipment
Element	purchased	was	depreciated	at	a	lower	than	standard	rate.	This	further	adds	to
the	inflated	nature	of	CGI's	book	value.


Finally,	as	I	discussed	in	my	previous	article,	Quality	recently	completed	a	large	tractor
swap	with	Stoops.	Despite	the	value	destructive	nature	of	this	swap,	CGI	did	not	take	any
write	downs	on	the	book	value	of	its	equipment.	This,	once	again,	adds	to	the	disconnect
between	book	value	and	market	value.


I	can	only	think	of	two	possible	reasons	to	explain	CGI's	claim	that	Element	purchased	this
equipment	at	book	value.	Either	(1)	Element	is	so	generous	or	stupid	that	it	was	willing	to
engage	in	an	obviously	uneconomical	transaction	or	(2)	CGI	is	misrepresenting	what
actually	happened.	Given	that	Element	is	a	large,	multi-billion	dollar	company,	I	think	the
second	scenario	is	much	more	likely.

Red	Flag	#2:	Purchase	of	Deferred	Sale	Assets	at	an	Inflated	Value


In	Q4	2016	and	Q1	2017,	19th	Capital	purchased	equipment	from	CGI	with	a	book	value
of	$60.5mm.	19th	Capital	was	not	willing	to	immediately	pay	full	book	value	for	this
equipment.	Instead,	to	reduce	its	risk,	19th	Capital	only	paid	$45mm	of	cash	upfront	and
asked	CGI	to	guarantee	the	lease	payments	on	this	equipment	for	a	period	of	around	4
years.	Once	this	was	fulfilled,	19th	Capital	agreed	it	would	then	pay	the	remaining
$15.5mm	($60.5mm	book	value	-	$45.0mm	upfront	payment).


Basically,	19th	Capital	was	not	willing	to	pay	book	value	for	Quality's	equipment	without
CGI	taking	on	a	great	deal	of	the	lease	payment	risk.	With	this	in	mind,	consider	the
following	disclosures	from	the	Company's	January	6th	8K	filing:


"With	the	closing	of	the	Transactions,	$6.7	million	of	the	remaining	consideration
was	received	relating	to	the	6/30/2016	transaction	and	$7.6	million	of	the	remaining
consideration	from	the	9/30/2016	transaction	was	contributed	to	19th	Capital."


As	described	above,	CGI	claims	that	19th	Capital	paid	them	$6.7mm	and	$7.6mm	to	settle
the	Q4	2016	and	Q1	2017	transactions,	respectively.


CGI's	claim	that	19th	Capital	agreed	to	pay	them	a	total	of	$14.3mm	to	settle	the	$60.5mm
of	deferred	sale	assets	makes	little	sense.	As	I	just	discussed,	19th	Capital	structured
these	transactions	so	that	it	would	not	have	to	pay	full	book	value	until	after	it	received	a
guaranteed	amount	of	payments	over	multiple	years.


Given	that	there	has	been	no	recovery	in	truck	prices,	I	am	puzzled	as	to	why	19th	Capital
would	suddenly	change	its	mind	and	agree	to	pay	full	book	value	without	this	guarantee.
As	discussed	in	Red	Flag	#1,	the	book	value	of	CGI's	equipment	is	clearly	inflated	by	a
significant	amount	compared	to	market	value.


So,	once	again,	it	appears	that	the	Company	somehow	found	another	sucker	to	pay	full
price	for	its	overvalued	equipment.


Red	Flag	#3:	CGI's	Equipment	Contribution	to	the	JV	also	Valued	at	Book


CGI	claimed	that	it	had	disposed	of	its	entire	amount	of	Quality	equipment	in	connection
with	the	JV	consummation.	The	following	breakdown	of	how	this	equipment	was	disposed
is	from	the	8K	filing:
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Troubling Information About The JV With Element And 19th Capital Is Revealed - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 25/38


Of	the	$162.5mm	of	disposals,	$21.9mm	and	$34.6mm	was	related	to	the	deferred	sale
assets	purchased	by	19th	Capital.	As	discussed	in	Red	Flag	#2,	the	Company	was	able	to
unload	this	equipment	at	book	value.	Another	$50.0mm	was	sold	to	Element.	As
discussed	in	Red	Flag	#1,	this	equipment	was	also	sold	at	book	value.


Finally,	as	highlighted	in	the	above	table,	CGI	contributed	the	remaining	$56.0mm	directly
to	the	JV.	Based	on	information	in	the	8K,	the	Company	was	once	again	able	to	receive
book	value	for	this	equipment	contribution.


The	willingness	of	Element	to	value	CGI's	equipment	at	a	significantly	inflated	price	is	hard
to	believe.	Element	is	a	part	owner	of	the	JV,	so	it	is	not	clear	why	it	would	agree	to	value
the	$56.0mm	equipment	contribution	at	far	above	market.	This	is	in	addition	to	the	$50mm
of	equipment	that	it	directly	purchased	from	CGI	at	an	inflated	value.	Thus,	it	seems	that
Element	is	acting	in	CGI's	best	interests	rather	than	their	own.


Overall,	this	further	adds	to	my	doubts	about	whether	management	has	truthfully
represented	the	terms	of	the	JV	to	the	investing	public.


Red	Flag	#4:	CGI	Somehow	Avoided	a	Write	Down	on	Its	Minority	Investment	in	the
JV


CGI	is	carrying	its	minority	investment	on	its	balance	sheet	at	the	same	value	as	its	equity
contribution	to	the	JV	($100mm).	Therefore,	CGI	did	not	realize	a	loss	from	this
contribution.	The	fact	that	the	Company	did	not	incur	a	write	down	is	hard	to	believe	for	a
few	reasons.


First,	the	$100mm	of	net	assets	it	contributed	included	$63.6mm	of	equipment	(net	of
$14.3mm	of	liabilities).	This	equipment	was	held	at	book	value.	As	I	have	discussed,	the
book	value	of	the	Company's	equipment	is	significantly	inflated	relative	to	its	market	value.
This	by	itself	should	have	resulted	in	a	write	down	from	the	marking	of	this	equipment
contribution	to	fair	value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 26/38


Second,	CGI	owed	Element	a	significant	amount	of	lease	shortfall	payments	which
exceeded	$60mm	on	a	run	rate	basis	(based	on	Q4	2016).	This	JV	was	formed	to	get	rid
of	this	payment	but,	in	exchange,	Element	would	have	demanded	some	form	of
compensation.	Thus,	at	a	high	level,	the	JV	formation	should	have	resulted	in	an	expense
or	write	down	for	the	Company.


Third,	the	bulk	of	the	contributions	to	the	JV	from	both	CGI	and	Element	was	in	the	form	of
equipment.	The	distinction	being	that	Element	contributed	both	equipment	and	associated
debt,	while	the	Company's	contribution	was	debt-free.


The	contribution	from	Element	likely	does	not	have	any	equity	value	and	may	even	have
negative	value,	because	Element	finances	its	equipment	purchases	entirely	with	debt.
Based	on	the	low	utilization	of	its	equipment,	combined	with	the	recent	decline	in	tractor
values,	it	is	likely	that	the	equipment	contributed	is	under	water.


The	combined	effect	of	the	above	three	points	should	have	resulted	in	a	large	write	down
for	CGI	from	the	JV	consummation.	So,	the	Company's	decision	to	value	the	minority
investment	at	$100mm	appears	to	be	overly	aggressive	and	inconsistent	with	GAAP
principles.


Red	Flag	#5:	CGI	Appears	to	be	Intentionally	Obfuscating	Element's	Contributions


The	disclosures	provided	by	CGI	in	its	January	6th	8K	filing	regarding	Element's
contributions	to	the	JV	are	unusually	vague.	Also	unusual	is	the	fact	that	its	press	release
announcing	the	JV	did	not	make	one	single	mention	of	Element's	contribution.


Based	on	this,	it	appears	that	the	Company	is	trying	to	mislead	the	investment	community
about	what	Element	actually	contributed.	For	example,	consider	the	following	disclosures
provided	in	CGI's	latest	8K	filing:


"Element…contributed	an	amount	equivalent	to	$100.0	million	in	cash	of	equity	to
19th	Capital,	which	was	applied	against	the	outstanding	principal	balance	of	the
Term	Loans	(as	defined	below)	as	part	of	a	prepayment	made	on	the	Closing	Date
and	settled	on	a	net	basis…"


"In	consideration	of	the	foregoing,	19th	Capital…received	certain	term	loan	financing
from	Element."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 27/38


The	above	statements	are	so	vague	and	confusing	that	they	could	be	interpreted	in	a
number	of	different	ways.	For	example,	in	the	first	quote	provided	above,	it	is	stated	that
Element	contributed	"an	amount	equivalent	to	$100.0	million	in	cash	of	equity."	Does	this
mean	Element	contributed	$100mm	of	cash,	or	did	they	contribute	assets	equivalent	to
$100mm?


Also,	in	the	second	quote	above,	it	appears	that	Element	contributed	a	term	loan	to	the	JV.
However,	there	is	a	troubling	lack	of	detail	regarding	this	term	loan	from	Element.	Was	this
term	loan	simply	debt	that	was	attached	to	the	tractors	it	contributed?	Or	was	this	a	new
term	loan	that	provided	fresh	capital	to	the	JV?	What	was	the	size	of	this	term	loan?
Nothing	is	clear.


As	another	example,	I	have	once	again	included	the	following	disclosure	from	CGI's	press
release:


"In	addition	to	closing	the	joint	venture,	Celadon	received	approximately	$50
million	in	cash	proceeds	from	the	sale	of	equipment	associated	with	the	Quality
business	at	net	book	value	for	use	by	the	joint	venture."


The	above	disclosure	is	highly	confusing.	The	phrase	"the	sale	of	equipment…for	use	by
the	joint	venture"	is	not	very	direct.	It	could	mean	the	JV	purchased	the	equipment…or
perhaps	some	other	party	purchased	the	equipment	and	allowed	the	JV	to	use	it?


CGI's	8K	filing	does	not	provide	any	further	descriptions	of	this	sale	to	Element.	Instead,
the	only	reference	to	the	$50mm	equipment	sale	was	provided	in	the	following	table:
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Troubling Information About The JV With Element And 19th Capital Is Revealed - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 28/38


Based	on	the	above	table	provided	in	the	8K,	it	seems	that	Element	directly	purchased	the
$50mm	of	equipment.	However,	beyond	this,	there	is	no	additional	detail	on	this	purchase.
Was	this	purchase	for	Element's	own	fleet	or	did	they	contribute	it	to	the	JV?	Again,
nothing	is	clear.


Section	11:	Concerns	Over	CGI's	Troubling	Personnel	Decisions


CGI's	unusual	personnel	decisions	is	another	point	of	great	concern.	To	be	more	specific,
numerous	key	finance	and	senior	management	positions	at	the	Company	appear	to	be
filled	with	people	that	are	highly	inexperienced	by	industry	standards.	Based	on	this	deep
operational	issue,	I	believe	the	chances	of	the	Company	recovering	from	the	downturn	in
its	business	is	even	more	remote.


Provided	below	is	list	of	some	key	employees	at	CGI	who	appear	to	be	unusually
inexperienced	for	their	respective	positions:


As	I	highlighted	in	red,	some	of	the	items	in	the	above	table	are	hard	to	believe.	For
example,	the	current	Director	of	Finance	(who	reports	to	the	CFO)	is	Kathryn	Wouters.
She	appears	to	have	been	around	24	years	old	when	she	was	promoted	to	this
position!	As	another	example,	George	Chasteen	served	as	President	of	19th	Capital	and
is	also	the	President	of	International	Business	at	CGI	(as	discussed	previously).	Mr.
Chasteen	was	promoted	to	his	current	position	at	CGI	when	he	was	only	around	24
years	old	as	well.


Certain	members	of	CGI's	senior	management	team	are	also	unusually	young.	Based	on
the	year	that	they	graduated	from	college,	both	Eric	Meek	(CGI	COO)	and	Bobby	Peavler
(CGI	CFO)	appear	to	be	in	their	mid-30s.	Also,	as	highlighted	in	the	above	table,	both	Mr.
Meek	and	Mr.	Peavler	graduated	from	the	same	small	college	(Franklin	College)	in	the
same	year.	I	found	this	fact	to	be	quite	unusual.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 29/38


It	appears	that	the	Company's	troubling	practice	of	consistently	promoting	highly
inexperienced	individuals	extends	to	mid-level	positions	as	well.	One	confidential	source
who	claims	to	be	a	current	CGI	employee	sent	me	the	following	(contact	details	and
certain	information	redacted):


The	inexperience	of	management	is	so	unusual	that	the	public	has	taken	notice	in	finance-
related	social	media:


The	following	message	was	posted	by	someone	on	StockTwits	in	November	2014
(username	redacted):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 30/38


The	following	message	by	a	user	on	Twitter	noted	that	CGI's	CFOs	over	the	past	three
years	were	all	in	their	30s	(username	redacted):


As	is	well	known,	CGI's	business	is	severely	distressed	and	dangerously	close	to
insolvency.	The	fact	that	so	many	inexperienced	individuals	fill	key	positions	at	the
Company	inspires	little	confidence	in	its	chances	of	recovery.


As	is	also	well	known	by	this	point,	CGI's	highly	irregular	and	questionable	financial
reporting	methods	is	another	point	of	great	concern	for	shareholders.	The	fact	that	some
of	the	key	people	in	charge	of	its	financials	(i.e.	CFO	of	CGI,	CFO	of	Quality,	Director
of	Finance	of	CGI)	are	only	a	few	years	removed	from	college	only	increases	this
concern.


Section	12:	The	Situation	at	CGI	Appears	Unsalvageable


The	situation	at	CGI	has	clearly	deteriorated,	and	given	the	accounting	and	finance
questions	raised	above,	a	formal	SEC	investigation	as	well	as	a	bankruptcy	filing	by	the
Company	appear	to	have	increased.


In	my	opinion,	the	evidence	of	profit	inflation	from	the	redemption	is	so	egregious
and	obvious	that	it	may	not	escape	the	eyes	of	the	SEC.	Also,	if	management	has
siphoned	$26.1mm	from	CGI	shareholders	to	pay	for	the	redemption,	this	could	result	in

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 31/38


additional	investigations.


Note	that	this	does	not	even	take	into	the	value-destructive	tractor	swap	that	CGI
management	seemingly	did	not	properly	account	for	in	its	financial	statements.	It	also
does	not	take	into	account	the	other	evidence	of	irregular	accounting	I	have	pointed	out	in
previous	articles	(i.e.	mismatches	in	working	capital	changes,	large	disconnect	between
net	income	and	FCF,	etc.).


In	addition	to	the	increased	risk	of	a	possible	formal	SEC	investigation,	the	Company's
sources	of	liquidity	also	continue	to	diminish	rapidly.	Even	after	the	JV	consummation,	the
Company	still	has	a	limited	amount	of	cushion	remaining	under	its	leverage	ratio
covenant.	The	JV	allowed	CGI	to	reduce	its	revolver	balance.	However,	this	incremental
reduction	in	debt	will	be	largely	offset	by	a	projected	year-over-year	decline	in	EBITDAR,
as	the	trucking	market	remains	extremely	soft.


Worse	yet,	it	appears	that	CGI's	lenders	have	started	to	play	hardball	with	them.
When	a	business	runs	into	liquidity	and	covenant	issues,	often	times	lenders	will
renegotiate	covenants	if	it	is	optimistic	about	a	chance	of	recovery.	This	has	not	been	the
case	for	CGI	to	this	point.The	Company	has	not	yet	renegotiated	its	4x	leverage	ratio
covenant	or	other	covenants	to	a	more	lenient	threshold.	In	addition	to	this,	the	lenders
reduced	their	commitments	from	$300mm	to	$250mm.	This	commitment	reduction	was
disclosed	in	its	January	6th	8K	filing	on	the	JV:


"On	December	30,	2016,	the	Company	entered	into	the	Amendment	with	the	Agent,
Wells	Fargo	Bank,	N.A.,	and	Citizens	Bank,	N.A…	The	Amendment	consented	to
the	Transactions	and	reduced	the	Aggregate	Commitments	under	the	Credit
Agreement	by	$50.0	million…"


In	addition	to	having	limited	borrowing	capability,	CGI	does	not	appear	to	have	much	if
any	assets	left	to	sell	for	additional	liquidity.	Provided	below	is	a	breakdown	of	CGI's
total	equipment	held	for	sale	and	owned	PP&E	(excluding	capital	lease	equipment)	as	of
Q4	2016.	I	have	provided	Q4	2016	balances	rather	than	Q1	2017	since	owned	PP&E	was
not	disclosed	in	CGI's	Q1	2017	10Q.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 32/38


As	shown	above,	as	of	Q4	2016,	CGI	owned	just	$353.4mm	of	equipment	(excludes
PP&E	from	capital	leases).	Now,	consider	the	following	list	of	equipment	transactions	that
the	Company	has	completed	since	then:


September	2016:	Completed	a	large	tractor	swap	with	Stoops	which	I	estimate
destroyed	at	least	$20mm	of	value.
December	2016:	Desperately	liquidated	equipment	before	the	end	of	the	year	to
seemingly	fund	the	$26.1mm	19th	Capital	redemption.
December	2016:	Disposed	of	$162.5mm	of	equipment	in	connection	with	the
consummation	of	the	JV	transaction	(includes	equipment	sale	to	Element,	settlement
of	deferred	sales	to	19	th	Capital,	and	equipment	contribution	to	JV).


In	total,	the	above	three	transactions	should	have	reduced	the	market	value	of	CGI's
equipment	by	around	$208.6mm.	It	should	be	noted	however	that	this	represents	the
market	value	that	was	disposed	of	and	not	the	book	value.	As	I	have	discussed	at	length,
the	book	value	of	CGI's	equipment	appears	to	be	significantly	inflated.	Based	on	this,	the
book	value	of	the	disposed	equipment	was	likely	well	in	excess	of	$208.6mm.


Thus,	most	if	not	all	of	the	$353.4mm	in	remaining	equipment	(valued	at	book)	at	the	end
of	Q4	2016	has	likely	been	liquidated.	As	a	result,	in	addition	to	its	limited	borrowing
capability,	it	appears	that	Company's	ability	to	raise	cash	via	asset	sales	is	also	very
limited.


This	is	highly	concerning	for	shareholders	because	CGI	continues	to	burn	a	substantial
amount	of	cash	each	quarter.	In	its	January	6th	8K	filing,	the	Company	noted	that	it
reduced	its	revolver	balance	by	$38.2mm	from	$158.2mm	in	Q1	2017	to	$120.0mm	in	Q2
2017.	Based	on	the	$57.8mm	the	Company	netted	from	the	JV	consummation,	this
implies	that	CGI	generated	a	FCF	loss	of	$19.6mm	($57.8mm	-	$38.2mm).	Thus,	despite
not	making	any	lease	shortfall	payments	in	Q2	2017,	the	Company	is	still	burning	almost

$80mm	of	FCF	on	a	run-rate	basis.	Given	its	alarmingly	high	cash	burn	rate	and
diminishing	sources	of	liquidity,	the	odds	of	CGI	declaring	bankruptcy	within	the	next	few
months	appear	quite	high.


My	Interaction	with	the	Company


I	would	like	to	note	that	my	recent	attempts	to	contact	CGI's	investor	relations	team	have
been	unsuccessful.	If	I	receive	a	meaningful	response	from	management	in	regards	to	the
issues	raised	in	this	article,	I	will	provide	an	update	in	the	comments	section.


Conclusion


If	CGI	management	has	inappropriately	used	cash	for	the	19th	Capital	redemption,	this
story	has	evolved	beyond	something	even	more	concerning	than	financial
misrepresentation.	Based	on	this	and	the	other	additional	red	flags	I	have	identified	in	this
article,	I	believe	that	CGI	shares	are	"uninvestable."	I	reiterate	my	price	target	of	$0.	Thus,
I	recommend	shorting	CGI	shares	or	selling	shares	if	you	are	an	existing	shareholder.


Appendix


Section	1:	An	Overview	of	the	Parties	and	Entities	Involved	in	this	Story


I	have	provided	below	a	description	of	the	various	parties	and	entities	involved	in	the	CGI
story.	I	believe	this	background	information	will	be	helpful	for	readers	who	are	not	as
familiar	with	the	Company.


Quality	Companies:	Quality	is	a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	of	CGI.	Quality	was	formed	by
CGI	to	perform	three	primary	functions:


First,	Quality	buys	tractors	and	related	equipment	in	bulk,	leases	the	tractors	to
independent	drivers,	and	then	sells	this	leased	equipment	for	a	profit.	Since	its	formation,
the	vast	majority	of	Quality's	leased	equipment	has	been	purchased	by	two	parties:
Element	and	19th	Capital	(more	detail	on	these	parties	provided	later	in	this	section).


As	part	of	its	purchase	agreement	with	both	Element	and	19th	Capital,	Quality	guaranteed
the	lease	payments	on	the	equipment	that	was	purchased.	For	example,	if	a	driver	failed
to	make	a	$500	lease	payment	to	Element	or	19th	Capital,	Quality	would	pay	$500	to
make	up	this	shortfall.	These	lease	shortfall	payments	exceeded	$60mm	on	a	run-rate
basis	(based	on	Q4	2016).	Since	Quality	is	a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	of	CGI,	this	means
that	CGI	was	on	the	hook	for	these	payments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 34/38


The	second	function	of	Quality	is	to	provide	lease	management	services.	These	services
include	tractor	leasing,	driver	recruiting,	lease	payment	remittance,	maintenance	and	other
services.	The	tractors	that	Quality	manages	includes	all	of	the	equipment	that	it	sold	to
19th	Capital	and	Element.


Finally,	in	addition	to	buying	and	selling	leased	tractors	in	bulk	for	profit,	Quality	also
handles	all	the	sale	and	purchase	activities	of	the	equipment	that	CGI	uses	in	its	own
fleet.


Element	Fleet	Management:	Element	is	a	large,	multi-billion	company	based	in	Toronto,
Canada.	Element	describes	itself	as	a	global	leader	in	the	fleet	management	industry	with
a	focus	on	cars	&	light	duty	vehicles,	medium	&	heavy	trucks	and	material	handling
equipment.


Since	2014,	Element	has	purchased	a	total	of	$740mm	of	leased	equipment	from	Quality.
Due	to	the	sharp	downturn	in	the	used	tractor	market,	Element	has	not	purchased	any
leased	equipment	from	Quality	since	the	end	of	Q2	2016	(quarter	ended	12/31/15).


19 	Capital:	19th	Capital	is	an	entity	formed	in	September	2015	by	CGI	and	Larsen
MacColl.	CGI	and	Larsen	MacColl	invested	$2mm	and	$4mm,	respectively,	in	this	entity	at
inception.	In	return	for	this	initial	investment,	CGI	received	33.3%	ownership	of	the	Class
A	shares,	while	Larsen	MacColl	received	the	remaining	66.7%.


The	primary	purpose	of	19th	Capital's	formation	was	to	provide	another	buyer	for	Quality's
leased	equipment.	It	was	formed	in	response	to	Element's	decision	to	halt	its	purchase	of
equipment	from	Quality.	This	decision	by	Element	left	Quality	without	a	dedicated	buyer
for	its	equipment.	From	inception	(September	2015)	to	its	redemption	prior	to	the	JV
consummation	(December	2016),	19th	Capital	purchased	a	total	of	$119.3mm	of	leased
equipment	from	Quality.


Section	2:	A	Summary	of	the	JV	Transaction


On	December	30th,	CGI	announced	in	a	press	release	that	it	had	consummated	its	joint
venture	agreement	with	Element	Fleet	Management	("Element").	A	week	later,	on	January
6th,	the	details	of	the	JV	were	released	in	an	8K	filing	with	the	SEC.


At	a	high	level,	the	JV	transaction	can	be	summarized	in	three	parts:	(1)	CGI's	contribution
to	the	JV,	(2)	Element's	contribution	to	the	JV,	and	(3)	net	cash	received	by	CGI.	A
description	of	each	of	these	three	components	of	the	transaction	is	provided	below:


CGI's	Contribution	to	the	JV

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 35/38


In	its	8K	filing	describing	the	JV	transaction,	CGI	provided	the	following	summary	of	its
contribution	to	the	JV:


In	total,	CGI	contributed	$100mm	of	net	assets	to	the	JV.	This	included	$36.4mm	of	cash
($35.3mm	+	$1.1mm),	as	well	as	$63.6mm	of	net	equipment	($77.9mm	of	equipment	-
$14.3mm	of	equipment	loans).


Element's	Contribution	to	the	JV


Based	on	the	information	provided,	it	seems	clear	that	Element	definitely	contributed	the
following	to	the	JV:


All	of	the	equipment	purchased	by	Element	from	Quality
All	of	the	debt	associated	with	the	contributed	equipment


Unfortunately,	beyond	the	contribution	of	equipment	and	associated	debt,	it	is	almost
impossible	to	determine	what	else	Element	provided.	Consider	the	following	disclosures
provided	in	the	8K	regarding	Element's	other	contributions:


"Element…contributed	an	amount	equivalent	to	$100.0	million	in	cash	of	equity	to
19th	Capital,	which	was	applied	against	the	outstanding	principal	balance	of	the
Term	Loans	(as	defined	below)	as	part	of	a	prepayment	made	on	the	Closing	Date
and	settled	on	a	net	basis…"


"In	consideration	of	the	foregoing,	19th	Capital…received	certain	term	loan	financing
from	Element."


The	above	statements	are	highly	confusing	and	lacking	in	detail,	and	could	be	interpreted
in	a	number	of	different	ways.	The	press	release	announcing	the	JV	is	not	very	helpful
either	because	it	curiously	makes	no	mention	of	Element's	contribution.	Thus,	as	just
stated,	it	appears	almost	impossible	to	determine	what	else	Element	provided	to	the	JV
beyond	equipment	and	associated	debt.	This	is	discussed	in	more	detail	in	Section	10.


Net	Cash	Received	by	CGI


In	its	8K	filing,	CGI	provided	the	following	breakdown	of	the	net	cash	it	received	from	the
transactions	related	to	the	JV:
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Troubling Information About The JV With Element And 19th Capital Is Revealed - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 36/38


Basically,	CGI	received	cash	in	two	separate	stages:


In	the	first	stage,	CGI	received	$43.1mm	prior	to	the	consummation	of	the	transaction
($4.6mm	+	$6.7mm	+	$31.8mm).	Of	the	$43.1mm	in	total	cash	received,	$35.3mm	of	this
cash	was	contributed	to	the	newly	formed	JV.	Therefore,	on	a	net	basis,	the	Company
received	$7.8mm	of	cash	from	closing	the	JV.


In	the	second	stage,	CGI	received	$50mm	of	cash	from	the	direct	sale	of	equipment	to
Element.	Thus,	in	total,	the	Company	claims	to	have	raised	$57.8mm	from	the
transactions	related	to	the	JV.


In	regards	to	ownership	structure,	CGI	and	Element	each	own	49.99%	of	the	newly
formed	JV	with	certain	members	of	management	owning	the	remainder.


It	should	be	noted	that	the	above	summary	of	the	JV	does	not	entail	all	of	the	elements	of
this	transaction.	There	were	a	number	of	intermediate	steps	which	had	to	take	place	in
order	to	consummate	the	JV.	This	includes	redeeming	the	existing	Class	A	and	B
shareholders	of	19th	Capital,	settling	CGI's	receivable	related	to	its	lease	shortfall
payments	to	Element,	and	settling	CGI's	loans	related	to	its	deferred	sale	assets	($30mm
loan	in	Q4	2016	+	$15mm	loan	in	Q1	2017).	More	detail	on	these	intermediary
components	of	the	JV	transaction	are	provided	in	this	article.


Section	3:	Monthly	Lease	Rate	Required	for	19th	Capital	to	Achieve	$20.1mm	of	Profits


The	first	step	in	estimating	the	monthly	lease	required	for	19th	Capital	to	achieve
$20.1mm	of	profits	is	to	calculate	the	average	number	of	months	that	it	owned	its
equipment:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040641-celadon-group-troubling-information-jv-element-19th-capital-revealed 37/38


As	shown	above,	based	on	the	timing	and	amount	of	its	purchases,	19th	Capital	has
owned	its	equipment	for	a	weighted	average	of	9.9	months.


The	next	step	is	to	calculate	19th	Capital's	estimated	expenses:


It	should	be	noted	that	I	have	used	very	conservative	assumptions	for	my	expense
estimates.	For	example,	I	have	assumed	an	annual	depreciation	rate	of	15%	which	is
likely	too	low	due	to	the	decline	in	tractor	prices.	Also,	I	have	assumed	$4,500	-	$6,000	of
annual	maintenance	expenses	per	tractor.	Typically,	annual	maintenance	costs	for	a
tractor	are	around	$12,000	-	$16,000	(as	per	industry	sources).

Finally,	putting	it	all	together,	I	have	provided	below	my	estimate	for	the	monthly	rate	19th
Capital	would	have	to	charge	to	achieve	a	$20.1mm	of	profit:

compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is
mentioned	in	this	article.
