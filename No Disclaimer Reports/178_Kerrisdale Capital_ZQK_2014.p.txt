Kerrisdale Capital Management is wagering against retailer Quiksilver, its founder Sahm
Adrangi said at a conference on Thursday.


The investment manager, who often talks publicly about its “short” positions against a stock,
said that he believes the brands at Quiksilver, which cater to surfer and skating cultures, are
fading from style and declining.


“Once fashion changes, there really is no going back,” Mr. Adrangi said while speaking at a
gathering hosted by the New York Society of Security Analysts on Thursday.


A representative for the Huntington Beach, Calif. company wasn’t immediately available for
comment.


The company in March announced its revenue had fallen more than expected in its quarter
ended in January, with all three of its major brands, Quiksilver, Roxy and DC, posting falling
sales.


Kerrisdale is a small New York hedge fund. Mr. Adrangi also mentioned his firm remained short
electric car maker Tesla Motors, a position about which he has spoken before.


Meanwhile, on the same panel on shortselling, Whitney Tilson said he had followed money
manager David Einhorn and started shorting athenahealth Inc.


Mr. Tilson, who said he is currently short some 45 stocks, called Mr. Einhorn’s presentation at a
conference Monday “air tight” and thought athenahealth could fall to $14 a share.

The stock was recently down six cents to $107.79 after falling nearly 18% following Mr.
Einhorn’s presentation.


Mr. Einhorn said the electronic healthcare records company was more of an outsourcing firm
than a cloud-computing investment, in making his case its valuation was unwarranted.


On Thursday, athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Einhorn
didn’t understand his company’s business, and that his company’s top shareholders were
unshaken by Mr. Einhorn’s presentation.
