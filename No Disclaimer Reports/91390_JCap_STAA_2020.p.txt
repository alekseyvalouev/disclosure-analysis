STARR Surgical (STAA)


Less Than Meets the Eye


We think that STAAR Surgical has overstated sales in China by at least one-third, or $21.6 mln. That would mean that all of the 
company’s $14 mln in 2019 profit is fake. 


A single Chinese distributor accounted for 43% of STAAR’s total sales 
and 71% of its growth in 2019 and over half in Q2 this year. In the 
2019 10K, STAAR reports: “One customer, Shanghai Langsheng [sic], 
our China distributor who sells in to China and Hong Kong, accounted 
for more than 43% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2019.” 1 


1  The proper spelling of the distributor is Lansheng.

Unfortunately, the Chinese numbers (which are not audited 2) are unre-
liable.


STAAR makes Implantable Collamer Lenses (ICLs) to correct severe 
myopia. ICL surgery is about three times as expensive as the more 
common LASIK procedure, and high out-of-pocket costs tend to dis-
courage all but the most myopic. 


Ex-China, STAAR sales growth has been unremarkable, yielding a 5% 
CAGR for the last decade, and profit has mostly been elusive despite 38 
years in business.


But China sales show a 37% CAGR over that same period. That growth 
has driven up the share price.

STAAR Surgical  STAA


After extensive research into STAAR’s worldwide operations, with a focus 
on China, we have concluded that STAAR China sales are overstated by 
about 33%. Fake sales come at 100% margins and therefore translate di-
rectly into profit. That means that the roughly $21.6 mln in overstated Chi-
nese sales in 2019 represent 152% of total company profit. In other words, 
without the fraud that we believe pervades the China business, STAAR is 
losing money. 


We have conducted over 75 interviews, visited company sites in China 
and Switzerland, and reviewed financial statements and other government 
documents for STAAR’s distributors and customers in China. We will show 
that sales of STAAR’s ICLs are dramatically overstated. 


The overstated sales
We offer four types of evidence: 


 ‣ Financial statements of the largest Chinese client, Aier Eye Hospital, 
indicate that those clinics bought only about half as many lenses as 
STAAR’s distributor claims. Aier represents about half of China sales 
and 25% of total sales, according to our interviews.


 ‣ Public data show that the value of lenses exported from Switzerland, 
the source of all product STAAR sells in China, is far lower than the 
reported sales.

 ‣ In interviews, Lansheng’s Tier 2 distributors told us how many lens-
es they sell, and the numbers suggest a lower volume than claimed. 


 ‣ Inventories, PPE, and manufacturing activity do not appear to sup-
port large annual volume growth.


The biggest client not so big
STAAR has not said much to investors about its largest client, Aier. It has 
posted a public notice in some Aier clinics stating that Aier has been the 
largest ICL partner each year since 2015.


We spoke to a dozen people familiar with STAAR’s sales in China, and they 
agreed that the STAAR sales numbers assume that 65,000-75,000 lenses—
half the volume sold in China--were sold to Aier Eye Hospital Group (300015 
SZ) in 2019. 


But Aier’s public financial statements indicate that its purchases from 
STAAR should be no more than 41,192 lenses, 43% fewer than our inter-
viewees told us.


Based on Aier’s 2019 annual report and our interviews with Aier manage-
ment, we estimate that Aier performed at most 20,596 ICL surgeries in 
2019. This is based on Aier IR, which told us that 15-20% of “refractive sur-
gery” revenue comes from ICL implants—we took 17.5% of Aier’s reported 
refractive surgery revenue for 2019. IR also told us that the ICL surgeries 
cost about ¥30,000. Based on those two data points, we calculate 20,596 
ICL surgeries in 2019. If all the surgeries involved two lenses, then STAAR

sold at most 41,192 lenses to Aier in 2019, not the 65,000-75,000 that Lan-
sheng and STAAR China told us. 


Our interviews with Lansheng and Aier procurement found that Aier pays 
an average of at least $585 per lens, and Lansheng receives a roughly 17% 
commission on the Aier sales. For 41,192 lenses, that would mean $20.2 
mln in revenue to STAAR in 2019, not the $32.4 mln that would represent 
half of China revenues.


The notice above, posted in an Aier clinic in Beijing, reads “As a division of Staar Surgical AG in 
Greater China, STAAR Optical Equipment Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. hereby verifies that 
Aier Eye Hospital Co. Ltd. has been Staar Surgical’s largest global partner for the implantation 
of ICL lenses for five years running, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.” | Photo by J Capital

Aier has ample means to obfuscate its lens purchases. We learned in an 
interview with an Aier executive that the company has a subsidiary at a 
non-existent address in Tibet that is dedicated to processing purchases of 
STAAR lenses. This company, called Shannan Youshi (”Improved Vision”) 
Medical Equipment Co. Ltd., pays STAAR for lenses and takes payment 
from the Aier hospitals, with little scrutiny of accounts; Tibet is notorious 
for providing operational opacity to companies.


We asked a photographer to visit the premises, but the address does not ex-
ist. We telephoned the registered phone number, and it was a non-working 
number.


Aier reported impressive growth in revenue from refractive surgeries in 
2018 and 2019, but the growth was well below what STAAR reported in 
revenue growth for China. In 2018, Aier reported 46% growth in refractive 
surgeries compared with STAAR’s report of 88% growth in China revenue, 
and in 2019, Aier reported 26% growth, against STAAR’s report of 41% 
growth in China.


Even before the Covid-19 crisis, our interviews with Aier doctors and Lan-


Aier reported 2019


Est revenue from ICL procedures (mln RMB) ¥617.88


Average surgery price ¥30,000 


Est number of surgeries 20,596 


Est number of lenses (@2 per surgery) 41,192 


Aier average lens price in USD $585 


Est commission to Lansheng 16%

sheng formers indicated slowing growth in sales. A former business man-
ager at Lansheng told us in August 2019: “Aier demand is flattish. People 
are much more interested in LASIK. People feel nervous about having an 
implant.”


In Q1 2020, Aier reported that its revenues dropped by 27% YoY and profit 
declined by 73%. Most clinics across China were closed for elective pro-
cedures from late January through March. Yet STAAR reported that its 
China ICL unit sales for the quarter rose by 7% year on year. We checked 
with two distributors to see whether they had stockpiled inventory, and the 
answer was no. Nor is there inventory at hospitals. “Public hospitals do not 
carry inventory,” one of the distributors said to us. 


Aier executives told us that 10 of their hospitals do carry inventory, but 
Aier’s financial statements indicate that inventory was flat in Q1 2020 on 
Q4 2019. That means the 7% reported growth is unlikely.


The plug
STAAR compensates for this sales inflation, we believe, with the market-
ing budget, which was $45.5 mln in 2019, 30% of sales. We spoke with 
sales and marketing executives in China, in the U.S., and in Europe as well 
as with former C Suite executives, and none could identify promotional 
spending nearing $45.5 mln a year. These executives, including longtime 
regional sales directors, told us they estimate that the company spends no 
more than a couple million dollars on marketing. Local marketing costs 
are borne by the distributors. 


Instead, according to a highly placed former executive, STAAR inflates 
sales and then balances the “income” by marking up marketing costs. Ac-
cording to a former executive, marketing “subsidies” may be around one-
third the stated value of the lens, so that the distributor buys the lens at 
$300 but STAAR books the sale at $450 and in order to hide the phantom 
revenue allocates the $150 to marketing. This means that STAAR is able to 
toggle sales at will using its marketing budget.


STAAR’s marketing budget is completely out of proportion to its costs. 
STAAR supports conferences and doctor training, but in China, we could 
identify maximum $500,000 annually in training expenses. We purchased 
a credit report on STAAR China and found that that company paid out just 
$127,698 in marketing expenses in 2019. Yet China represented 43% of 
STAAR’s sales in 2019.

China sales volumes fall short
We interviewed both Lansheng and its sub-distributors about their sales 
volumes. When we totaled up the numbers they gave us in interviews, we 
found volumes fell short of what they would have to be to rack up $64.8 
mln in sales. Based on the prices Lansheng pays STAAR for lenses—which 
we have confirmed with STAAR formers—the company should have sold 
129,000 lenses in 2019. But we counted only 70,050 in total, including the 
41,000 we estimate Aier purchased.


Lansheng has eight Tier 2 distributors. Two of those are shell companies as-
sociated with STAAR and Lansheng staff that do not appear to have staff. The 
other six companies each estimated 2019 sales volumes for us in interviews.

The largest Tier 2 distributor is Shanghai Leyue Optical Equipment Co. 
Ltd., which was set up by former STAAR China sales staff. According to 
Lansheng, Leyue sells 20% of the lenses consumed in China and is the 
agent for Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. The principal 
owner, Pan Jie, is former regional sales director for STAAR according to 
three of our interviews, and company Independent Director Liu Juan, pic-
tured above giving a talk at a STAAR event in 2016, is former China direc-
tor for STAAR.


But our visit and calls indicate that the company does not have any real op-
erations. When we called, the person answering the phone refused to iden-
tify the company. We asked to speak with a salesperson and were refused. 
The receptionist refused to provide us with an address or product brochure. 
When we visited the registered office location, the company’s name was 
nowhere to be seen. A different company called Shanghai Chengwei Inte-
rior Decoration Co. is at the same address. The office does display a poster 
showing the STAAR EVO lens.


The second shell-company distributor is Shanghai Qinghong Trading.

Henan, and Hong Kong. Government documents show that Qinghong is 
owned by Lansheng’s chairman, Zhang Jian. We were unable to find any 
staff for this company. The company telephone is the same as that for Lan-
sheng Resources, as is the website. The company office does not look like it 
belongs to a major medical distributor.


Missing exports from Switzerland
All product shipped to international markets is shipped from a STAAR 
facility in Nidau, Switzerland, which mostly repackages products made in 
STAAR’s Monrovia, California factory. Lansheng, which accounts for 100% 
of China sales, imports all STAAR ICLs from Switzerland. But Swiss re-
cords showing exports of implantable contact lenses to China indicate sales 
far lower than those claimed by STAAR. 


Swiss export records4 show just $23.5 mln in exports of implantable con-
tact lenses to China for 2019, compared with STAAR’s reported China sales 
of $64.8 mln. The exports to Hong Kong are de minimis, so the gap cannot 
be explained by gray-channel imports through Hong Kong or by the mar-
gin Lansheng makes.

The figure likely understates STAAR sales in China due to issues of catego-
rization or tariff “minimization.” 


The Swiss statistics do not provide a precise estimate of China sales, but 
they do support our view that sales are lower than claimed. We found sup-
porting evidence by visiting the Nidau facility, where activity seems too 
slow to support the company’s contention that 88% of its total product is 
shipping from that location. 


Our investigator visited STAAR’s facility in Nidau and offices under con-
struction a few minutes away in Brugge. He spoke with employees and 
people in the neighborhood estimated that about 20 people work in manu-
facturing, packing, and shipping for STAAR on the site. This compares 
with 45 staff reported for STAAR Nidau in an article that appeared in 
Switzerland’s Neue Zürcher Zeitung in 2000, when STAAR was renting the 
same premises.5 In other words, STAAR staff in Nidau has declined over a 
20-year period.

Underwhelming manufacturing levels
We think STAAR may be producing fewer lenses than it claims. Invento-
ries have actually declined over five years despite a 95% increase in in-
come. The dollar value of work in process has declined 6% in five years, 
falling every year except 2018. They have not disclosed changes to the 
method of classification for inventory.


Because prices were dropped significantly in 2015-16, according to our 
interviews, volume must have increased even more than the 95% realized 
in income growth. Yet there is no build-up of raw materials, no staff addi-
tions at the Collamer plant in Aliso Viejo, and no bottlenecks in production. 
Executives say that the STAAR process is expensive, with material costs of 
at least $50 per Collamer “button” going into the lens and with high levels 
of waste, so increased production should lead to higher raw materials and 
work in process costs.

Considering the very steep ramp up in sales, and the manufacturing time of one 
to two months, work in process has barely budged during the last four years.


The company did report a sharp rise in works in process in Q2, but raw 
materials declined, and finished inventory was flat.


A weird stasis has long applied to inventories.

STAAR Surgical  STAA


This flat pattern is remarkable, because in several conversations with pro-
duction executives at STAAR, we have learned that the lens-production 
process takes about six weeks start to finish and requires a lengthy period 
of baking the lenses. Rapid growth in production, therefore, would neces-
sarily entail a build-up in works in process. 


STAAR formers have told us that they have not seen the increase in manu-
facturing activity that would support the reported 41% sales growth. No 
one, including former managers who worked within STAAR’s manufactur-
ing facility in Monrovia, can say what the unit production volume is.


STAAR’s secret sauce is its own patented raw material, a bio-compatible 
mix called Collamer. The material is produced in a facility in Aliso Viejo, 
California. This facility employs about 20 people, according to our inter-
views, and has not expanded either equipment or personnel in two decades. 
Although STAAR is adding to its production facilities in both California 
and Switzerland, no additions are planned in Aliso Viejo.


Taxes
STAAR’s cash taxes have remained puzzingly flat over the last five years 
despite the company’s move from losses to profits and a near tripling of 
profit in 2019. We consulted with tax specialists in Switzerland and the U.K., 
but they could not think of a reason why STAAR’s cash taxes would not 
have risen.


VAT: The company has reported no growth in VAT receivable over five 
years despite very significant growth in sales in international markets 
where VAT returns are accrued. VAT receivable declined from $724,000 in 
2015 to $713,000 in 2019 even though international sales had grown over 
that period by 188%.

Return volumes fall short
We learned in interviews that doctors order duplicate lenses in between 
30-100% of surgeries. They almost always return one pair unused. Yet we 
counted 33 lenses returned each month during the busy season from a 
distributor who claims to be selling 24,000 per year. With that volume, the 
distributor should be returning at least 600 lenses per month.


Inventory levels as reported by distributors are well below what would be 
required to support 138,000-150,000 annual lens sales in China. All the 
Tier 2 distributors together told us they had about 1,000 lenses in invento-
ry, and Lansheng formers told us that company generally holds about 1,500 
lenses. Distributors told us that hospitals do not hold inventory. A few Aier 
hospitals hold some inventory, but interviewees said those inventory levels 
were in the hundreds.

STAAR Surgical  STAA


ICL sales for slow growth. This contrasts with STAAR’s assertion that 
China’s market is in hyper growth.


Cash
STAAR’s Q2 report showed that the company earned almost no interest on 
its large cash balance of $116 mln—just $20,000, versus $216,000 in Q1 
despite holding more cash. This is a net number, but debt is tiny, at $1.3 
mln. The company in May 2020 issued a shelf offering, which is odd, since 
STAAR is sitting on more than 5x as much cash as it ever had prior to the 
secondary offering in 2018. We are hesitant to accuse any company of mis-
leading investors about cash balances, but this is not right.


Who is Lansheng?
Curiously, STAAR reports a “hybrid distribution” model in China and yet 
100% of China sales are attributed to its distributor, Lansheng.


The chairman of Lansheng, Zhang Jian, bought the medical-equipment 
piece of a state-owned enterprise in 2008. At that time, STAAR had just 
entered China through a distribution agreement with a company called 
Hangzhou Guochang Trade. The Hangzhou company brought sales from 
from $2.9 mln in 2009 to $8.4 mln in 2012. Then STAAR took back dis-
tribution. In Q4 2015, STAAR gave up on doing direct sales and handed 
import and distribution to Lansheng. In the same quarter, STAAR signed a 
“strategic cooperation” with Aier.

Shortly after signing with STAAR, Zhang Jian spirited the STAAR distri-
bution business into a separate company registered in the British Virgin 
Islands. He used that BVI, called Visiontec, to establish a Shanghai shadow 
company whose English name is the same as Lansheng’s. Although the 
two Lanshengs are owned by the same person, they are not the same com-
pany, but STAAR has never made a new disclosure.


BVI company shareholder lists are confidential. Creating a shadow com-
pany with offshore ownership could enable Lansheng owners to engage in 
offshore currency and share transactions.

Ways and means
There are several strategies STAAR appears to use to balance out overstated 
revenue and profit. One strategy is an inflated marketing budget. Another is 
R&D. We believe STAAR’s R&D expenditure, $25.3 mln in 2019, is dramati-
cally overstated. After interviews with former STAAR executives throughout 
the research and clinical operations and an estimate of the cost of the current

clinical trial, we believe that actual spending on R&D may be around $5 mln. 
Another $3.2 mln is recorded in R&D as stock-based compensation expense. 
We think more than $15 mln could simply be invented and another way for 
the company to reconcile inflated sales.


On the R&D budget, we conducted interviews with two highly placed former 
R&D executives and with two other former employees working in R&D at 
STAAR. They estimated total internal spending on R&D at less than $5 mln. 
As for how much R&D has been contracted out, one of the executives said: “I 
would say none.”


That leaves clinical trials to drive budgets, but the costs there also do not ap-
proach the more-than $20 mln booked annually. We walked through the costs 
with an R&D executive at a competing company who runs trials. This execu-
tive estimated that the biggest cost for trials consists of payments to surgeons 
and agreed with our high-end estimate of $20,000 per patient for surgery a 
follow-up, plus a $100 payment to the patient.


“To run a clinical study of the type the FDA would require could be $1-2 mil-
lion a year and could be $2-3 million a year plus some follow-up,” one former 
executive told us.


Remediation for the quality problems identified by the FDA in 2014 would 
have been included in the R&D budget and could have cost up to $3 mln a 
year between 2014 and 2018 on the high end, according to a former executive.


STAAR’s biggest trial, seeking approval of the EVO lens in the U.S., is recruit-
ing 333 subjects. We estimate that fees to surgeons and patients and manage-
ment costs over a two-year period for this trial might be roughly $10 mln.


The table below displays all the clinical trials that STAAR has reported to 
clinicaltrials.gov since 2010.

Lansheng formers estimated 2,000-3,000 lenses returned per year. At Lan-
sheng’s price, 2,500 returned lenses would be valued at about $1.2 mln. 


Suspicious H1 volumes
Asia was gut punched by Covid-19, but STAAR reported growth. As usual, 
the company relied on China for the bit of good news it had to offer. In Q2, 
China distributor Lansheng accounted for 53% of sales and 57% of trade 
receivables. For the first half, STAAR said that Chinese unit sales rose by 7% 
and revenue declined by 2.7%, suggesting sharp discounts. In fact, sev-
eral eye clinics told us that they were discounting ICL surgery, usually by 
about 15%.


But we interviewed 19 doctors, distributors, and marketing platforms that 
promote eye surgery. They said that the number of ICL procedures in China 
from January through June had declined by around 50-60%. Chinese clin-

ics were closed for at least two months, sometimes more. 


In May, we spoke with a Lansheng former who is in regular touch with for-
mer colleagues. This former executive estimated that Q1 sales were down 
30% YoY in terms of volume and that Q2 would be more or less flat with Q2 
2019.


Hospitals echoed this decline. “We did not perform any surgeries in April 
through June,” said a medical assistant at a large public hospital in Chengdu.


“In the second quarter, our ICL procedures were 60% of what they were 
last year,” said an eye surgeon in Lanzhou.


A doctor in Beijing told us that elective procedures at his hospital were 
down by at least 50% in May due to quarantine rules for patients coming 
from outside the city, while additionally, patients without urgent medical 
conditions were reluctant to go to hospitals. A current Lansheng employee 
estimated that Q1 sales had dropped by at least one-third. 


“In Q1 this year, we sold about 1,000 lenses—that’s a drop of more than 
50%,” a Beijing-based distributor told us.


“This year from January through April we really didn’t do any [ICL surger-
ies]” an eye surgeon at a major Beijing hospital told us. In 2019, this hospi-
tal saw 7% growth in ICLs.


If the growth that STAAR reported came from packing channels with in-
ventory, the inventory is not with Lansheng. Inquiries with Lansheng and 
STAAR employees indicated that Lansheng in H1 was carrying substan-
tially less than its usual inventory because of concerns that the coronavi-
rus would make the lenses unsaleable. A Lansheng former also said that 
STAAR was worried that receivables could go unpaid. 


Lansheng represents 100% of sales in China. If both sales and inventory 
were down, it is impossible that China sales grew. 


The coming decline
In the Q2 call, STAAR offered a rosy outlook, saying that Q3 would see at 
least 20% sequential growth and double-digit growth year on year. Mason 
said that China in July had “on several days, hit implantation records.”


Our hospital interviews indicate that July did have much higher volumes 
but that these were make-up volumes for May-June.

STAAR Surgical  STAA


One of the largest Aier hospitals, occupying four floors of a shopping cen-
ter in Beijing, told us that ICL surgeries were down 33-50% “during the 
pandemic” but had recovered in July to about the same level as July 2019. 
Another clinic said that volumes had doubled over July 2019 but had been 
sharply down in the first half.


“In May, the hospitals started gradually to get back to normal, and this led 
to explosive growth in July,” a Lansheng Tier 2 distributor told us.


“In April through June, we didn’t do any surgeries,” a hospital in Chengdu 
told us. “In July, numbers grew 20% compared with July last year.”


We do not believe the summer months will make up for lost business in 
the first half.


We spoke with 19 eye hospitals and distributors that purchase from STAAR 
about their sales volumes in 2020 versus 2019. Six refused to disclose sales 
volumes. Two said their businesses had returned to normal volumes by 
May. The remaining 11 were seeing dramatic declines in implant surgeries 
and expected the full year would be significantly lower than last year.

Audit
Technically, STAAR has a very small operation in China, relying on Lan-
sheng to do sales, and does not need to be audited in China. But STAAR 
derives 43% of its revenue from the Chinese market and has a large mar-
keting budget that is presumably dedicated to China.


Interestingly, our interviews showed that STAAR does not have an ERP in 
place; its IT system consists only of the Online Calculation and Ordering 
System (OCOS)6 used by doctors to choose the right size and magnification 
for a patient’s lens. The actual ordering is done in batches by emailed Excels 
and in phone calls. Lansheng says that they order the commonly used mag-
nifications in batches rather than ordering specific lenses for specific proce-
dures. Lansheng built its own inventory management system in 2018, but its 
sub-distributors generally use a manual system for inventory management.

Blurring the picture for investors
STAAR has a pattern of lying to investors and regulators. The company 
paid out $10.7 mln to settle two separate class-action lawsuits over a de-
cade: both of the lawsuits alleged that STAAR hid from investors deficien-
cies found by the FDA in STAAR’s management processes.7 Court and 
FDA records show that the company got trial subjects to backdate consent 
forms, ignored counter indications, “lost” documentation, could not find (or 
refused to disclose) the password to the ordering system. In one lawsuit, 
a STAAR executive said the company instructed her to provide false in-
formation to the FDA.8 Like other the lawsuits against the company, this 
was settled out of court, and details are unavailable. But we spoke with an 
employee who worked in quality control until mid-2019, who told us that 
the company continues to “hide things for audits.”


The company’s lawsuits could fill their own 10K:


 ‣ November 2000: Former employee Kirtida Patel sued the company, 
alleging that management had instructed her to withhold informa-
tion from the FDA and had lied to the FDA. 


 ‣ December 2000: A shareholder derivative suit alleged self-dealing 
and waste of assets by directors.


 ‣ October 2001: Novastaar Investments, LLC sued to win the right to 
inspect records pertaining to $6 mln in loans to directors, service 
contracts paid to companies owned by directors, $24 mln in asset 
write-offs, defaulted loans, and other transactions.


 ‣ June 2007: the company was warned by the FDA for failing to re-
spond to adverse events from clinical trials. The FDA advised that 
STAAR hire an independent auditor. The company declined to take 
that step. The FDA later told STAAR that its response was “inad-
equate.”

STAAR Surgical  STAA


 ‣ February 2015: The FDA issued a letter containing 10 “observations” 
focusing on the need for improved procedures, processes and docu-
mentation and broader environmental monitoring. A quality inspec-
tor we spoke with who worked at the Monrovia facility told us that in 
late 2019, procedures will have not been improved.


 ‣ 2015: Two activist shareholders demanded changes to the board to 
address chronic losses and what they said was the company’s in-
ability to exploit growth opportunities in China. No changes were 
made, but STAAR appointed Lansheng as its distributor in China and 
growth accelerated.


 ‣ June 2016: Kevin Forestal filed a stockholder derivative complaint 
claiming that STAAR disseminated misleading statements to inves-
tors and engaged in unjust enrichment.


Executive compensation
We find company compensation to be out of proportion to results. Despite al-
most unbroken losses through 2017, top executives took option awards worth 
$9.7 mln in 2016-19 and total compensation averaging $1 mln per year.


Lansheng enabled STAAR to end a history of losses that had been broken 
just twice since 1995, and the black ink helped double compensation for 
CEO Caren Mason and other members of the executive team. STAAR’s 
targets for executive bonuses and share compensation incentivize overall 
revenue and profit growth (or a reduction in losses). In 2019, Mason made 
$3.6 mln in cash and share options, an increase of 38% over 2018 compen-
sation of $2.6 mln

Share compensation in 2019, $11.6 mln, was equivalent to 82% of STAAR’s 
2019 net income. In Q1 this year, despite losing money, STAAR still issued 
$2.9 mln in new stock-based compensation.


Management has impeccable timing when it comes to share sales.


 ‣ On June 14, 2018, Director William P. Wall and two other insiders 
were awarded shares. On August 1, the company raised guidance. On 
August 20, Wall sold 5,000 shares. 


 ‣ Between November 14 and December 13, 2019, five insiders sold 
shares. On January 2, 2020, longtime investor and activist Broad-
wood Capital sold a block of 41,220 shares.


 ‣ On March 18-20, 2020, six insiders acquired shares. On May 6, 
against all Covid-19 odds, the company announced strong growth in 
Q1. On May 11-15, the same six insiders sold shares.
