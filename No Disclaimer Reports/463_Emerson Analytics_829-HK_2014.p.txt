The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 
 September 2, 2014 
 
 





Shenguan Holdings (Group) Limited (HK:00829) has been doctoring its books since its October 2009 


IPO when it raised Rmb1.2bn from the Hong Kong market. 





1. Hidden raw materials costs 


The core raw material for collagen sausage casing production is cattle inner skin. Our research and 


investigation show that Shenguan consumed 70,000 tons of cattle inner skin in 2013. With an average 


price of Rmb7,200 per ton (VAT included), total cost of cattle inner skin amounted to Rmb430.8m last 


year, and that alone exceeded the Rmb295.5m total raw materials costs reported by the company. 





We reckon that total raw materials costs actually amounted to Rmb662.7m with total cost of sales at 


Rmb1,054.3m, the latter being 53.5% higher than that reported by the company. We believe Shenguan 


simply removed some costs off its books to dress up its financial performance, as in the Longtop case. 





2. Charging the biggest client a premium price 


Our analysis shows that Shenguan’s sales to its largest customer during 2006-08 were priced at an 


average 41.3% above those to all other customers. This is just absurd. The company’s overall average 


selling price is at least 13% below the reported. 





3. Phony sales to Zhongshan Defu 


Shenguan claimed in its IPO prospectus that Zhongshan Defu, controlled by a connected person, was one 


of its top five customers accounting for as much as 12.8% of sales in 2006. Zhongshan Defu’s business 


registration information shows that its cost of sales was way below the revenue claimed by Shenguan.

4. Incredibly high margins 


Shenguan has reported very high EBIT margins that averaged 53% in the last few years, much higher 


than the 18% or so enjoyed by two global giants Viscofan Group and Devro PLC. Its gross margin at 55-


60% was also a lot higher than the 25-40% reported by Liuzhou Honsen, a smaller Chinese competitor. 


This is just too good to be true. 





As the company is in such an obscure business with no other Chinese listed peers, analysts and investors 


who loathe doing their own research simply take the management’s word for granted. Now, our 


investigations and research show that in 2013, Shenguan inflated its revenue by at least 10-15% and hid 


part of its raw materials costs (the actual cost is about 124% higher than the reported amount). This 


bloated its EBIT margins from our estimated 19.8% to a reported 52.4%. 





5. Other irregularities 


There are a number of irregularities in Shenguan’s accounts. First, the international auditor Ernst and 


Young only audits the Hong Kong holding company subsidiaries. All Mainland operating subsidiaries 


were audited by an infamous Chinese firm, Shenzhen Pengcheng, during the IPO process. Second, 


average monthly wages have been declining in the last two years, which is down right impossible in 


China where wage inflation has been in double-digit during the last few years. Third, the R&D expenses 


are so big (13% of revenue) as to be ridiculous and impossible to fit into the cost analysis.  





6. “Subsidy” recovery and the truth of high dividend ratio 


Why do the controlling shareholders led by chairwoman Zhou Yaxian want to dress up Shenguan’s book 


by under-reporting raw materials costs? By presenting a rosy picture, they obtained a high valuation that 


yielded a Rmb1.2bn net proceeds, and then enriched themselves through three “legitimate” channels. 


They sold a tiny stake in the principal operating subsidiary to the listco after the IPO at an exorbitant 


valuation, they disposed of some shares in the listco barely a year after IPO, and they paid a generous 


dividend which mostly ended up in their own pockets. These three paths have so far generated 


Rmb1.94bn, which we believe far exceeds the Rmb1.66bn of costs that the company has under-reported. 





Looking at the controlling shareholders and the listco as an organic whole, we can see that they have 


pocketed Rmb1.71bn since 2009 by paying public shareholders merely Rmb0.44bn. This is the truth 


about Shenguan’s high dividend payout ratio. 





7. Valuation 


Even if one would generously accord Shenguan the same valuation in terms of P/E multiple, the stock 


should trade at about HK$1.1 per share compared with the current HK$2.8.

Introduction 
 
Over the last six months, we have spent much time and resources analyzing Shenguan. 





We contacted all collagen sausage casing manufacturers in China to get to understand the production 


process, use of raw materials and the economics of the industry. We visited Shandong Crown Collagen 


Casing Co., Ltd (山东冠华胶原肠衣有限公司), Zibo Longbao Biological Food Co., Ltd (淄博龙宝生物食品有


限公司), Zhongshan Baidefu Casing Co., Ltd (中山市百德富肠衣有限公司) and Handan Dike Collagen 


Casing Co., Ltd. (邯郸帝科肠衣有限公司) in person, and we had a telephone conversation with Liuzhou 


Honsen Collagen Casing Co., Ltd. (柳州宏升胶原蛋白肠衣有限公司). 





We visited several leather factories to understand how raw skin is turned into limed skin for use in the 


manufacture of collagen sausage casings. This helped us to ascertain the cost of cattle inner skin for 


casing manufacturers such as Shenguan. 





We spent much time and effort to identify the two most important cattle inner skin suppliers (together 


they account for more than 50% of the use) to Shenguan, even though the company wants investors to 


believe that it relies on a large number of small suppliers for its cattle inner skin. We have no doubt that 


we have a good grip on Shenguan’s cattle inner skin consumption and costs. 





We diligently prowled through all documents published by Shenguan since its 2009 IPO, and we found 


that its average selling price to its largest customer was significantly higher than that for all other 


customers. 





We examined State Administration of Industry and Commerce documents of Zhongshan Defu, one of 


Shenguan’s top five customers in 2006-07, and found proof that the reported sales were non-existent. 





Through all these efforts, we now have a better understanding of Shenguan, its operations and its 


financials than any bank, analyst or investor. 





This is not a statement of opinion. It is a statement of fact.  





Below, we present our findings and analyze the true profitability of Shenguan.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

Shenguan was listed on the Hong Kong stock market in October 2009 as China’s preeminent supplier of 


edible collagen sausage casing products with by far the largest market share and apparently very high 


margins. While the IPO prospectus issued in September 2009 was fairly detailed and included all kinds of 


statistics, over time the company’s disclosure has deteriorated and by 2012 the company ceased to 


disclose some of its key operating metrics. That, in our experience, is a sure sign of trouble. 
 
 


Part 1. Analysis of Cost of Cattle Skin 
 


The core raw material for collagen sausage casing production is cattle inner skin. The total cost of cattle 


inner skin obviously depends on consumption volume and unit price, which are discussed below. 
 





1.1.Consumption Volume of Cattle Inner Skin 





The consumption of cattle inner skin obviously depends on the production and sales volume of sausage 


casings. 





The following exhibit shows leather-making process. After a series of steps involving soaking, liming and 


meat removal, raw skin is turned into limed skin, which can then be used for the manufacture of collagen 


sausage casings. 





 
Exhibit 1 – Processing Cattle Skin

1.1.1. Estimation of 2012-2013 collagen sausage casings volume 





Before 2012, Shenguan had always disclosed sales volume and production capacity of its collagen 


sausage casings. For some reason, from that year onward, Shenguan no longer discloses such figures.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

Without any official production and/or sales figures, we can only make an educated guess based on the 


year-on-year growth rates in Shenguan’s cost of sales, raw materials costs, energy and utilities costs and 


packaging material costs. 





 
Exhibit 2 – Estimation of 2012 Sales Volume Growth 





Year end Dec 31 (Rmb k) 2011 2012 YoY growth 


Cost of sales 571,709 689,255 20.6% 


Raw materials & consumables 234,652 312,780 33.3% 


Water, electricity and coal 138,051 166,462 20.6% 


Packaging materials from Wuzhou Junye 18,147 22,162 22.1% 


Our estimate 
  


25.0%

In the above table, Wuzhou Junye represents Wuzhou Junye Trademark Printing Material Co., Ltd., a 


connected party of Shenguan. The data come from the disclosure on connected transactions in the annual 


reports. 





It can be seen that in 2012, Shenguan’s sales volume should have grown more than 20% from the 2011 


level. We believe a 25% sales volume growth estimate is not far off the mark. 





According to the 2013 annual report, sales volume rose slightly on the 2012 level. We shall therefore put 


the 2013 sales volume growth at just 1%. 





The following table shows Shenguan’s collagen sausage casings sales volume from 2006 through 2013, 


based on the company’s official data for the first six years and our educated guess for the last two.

1.1.2. Estimates of cattle inner skin consumption 





Now that we have an estimate for the 2013 sales volume, what was the consumption of cattle inner skin 


that year? Obviously, this depends on how many meters of collagen sausage casings can be produced 


from a ton of cattle inner skin. The key variables include the production process, the quality of the

The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

machinery used, the technological standard, the diameters and the thickness of the sausage casings, 


among others. The diameters of the casings are the single most important factor in the length of casings 


that can be produced from a ton of cattle inner skin. What we are talking about is obviously the output for 


the average of various diameters of casings produced, rather than for a particular diameter. 





To obtain the data, we visited Shandong Crown and Zibo Longbao. We were comfortable that the 


conversations were not biased against anyone, certainly not Shenguan. 





Our conversations with Shandong Crown and Zibo Longbao were taped secretly. To protect the safety of 


the interviewees, we will not make public any audio recording in which they reveal evidence of 


Shenguan’s lies or exaggerations. Retaliation by Chinese companies against whistleblowers has been well 


documented by the media (for one example, check out www.publiccompanyprisoner.org). We are, 


however, sharing such audio recordings as well as the interviewees’ names, positions, contact telephone 


numbers and dates of meeting with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong. 





Shandong Crown is the second largest Chinese supplier of collagen sausage casing after Shenguan. The 


two companies participated in the setting of Chinese national standards for collagen sausage casing. 





 
Evidence 1 – English Transcript of Shandong Crown_Output Per Ton.mp3 


 
Emerson investigator: With one ton of cattle skin how many meters of collagen sausage casing can you 
 produce? Do you have the statistics? 
Shandong Crown: One ton of cattle skin, right? 
Emerson investigator: Yes. 
Shandong Crown: We will need to add additives and ingredients so that the weight is certainly more than a 
 ton. If you start with a ton of cattle skin you'll get about 60,000-70,000 meters of collagen 
 sausage casing. 
Emerson investigator: 60,000-70,000 meters, right? 
Shandong Crown: Yes, 60,000-70,000 meters. 
Emerson investigator: Is this the average number or is this for a specific diameter? 
Shandong Crown: Average.

province.

Summarizing the above two conversations, we can arrive at the following. 





 
Exhibit 4 – From Cattle Inner Skin to Collagen Casings 
 


 
 
Source: Emerson Analytics 








Shenguan is the training ground of the Chinese collagen sausage casing industry. Other manufacturers tap 


Shenguan for their core technicians, and use similar production process as Shenguan with a similar level 


of technology. In six months of investigations, we have not found any evidence that Shenguan’s products 


are on average of smaller diameter than those of other manufacturers. We are therefore convinced that 


data provided by Shenguan’s competitors can be applied to Shenguan itself. 





If a ton of cattle inner skin can produce about 60,000-70,000 meters of collagen sausage casings, then 


Shenguan would have used about 61,053-71,228 tons of cattle inner skin in 2013, based on our estimate 


of 4,273.7 million meters of sales volume, as shown in the following table, 








4,273,700,000meters / 60,000 meters per ton = 71,228 tons

1.1.3. Consumption volume according to cattle skin supplier 





In p.91 of its IPO prospectus dated September 30, 2009, Shenguan said that for the years ended 31 


December 2006, 2007 and 2008 and the six months ended 30 June2009, it purchased cattle inner skin 


“from 15, 26, 37 and 32 different suppliers, respectively. Over 85% of these suppliers of cattle inner skin 


are operated on an individual basis”. 



http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2009/0930/LTN20090930014.pdf

This implies that the company relied on a large number of small suppliers for its cattle inner skin. 


However, the company has not made any additional disclosure on its suppliers since its listing. 





Our investigations, on the other hand, reveal a totally different picture. Our investigators have 


successfully identified two key suppliers of cattle inner skin to Shenguan. One of them supplies about 


12,000 tons of cattle inner skin to Shenguan every year (we’ll call it inner skin supplier number 1 or ISS1 


in short). The other supplies more than 25,000 tons a year (we’ll call it inner skin supplier number 2 or 


ISS2). Both have been doing business with Shenguan for many years. 





Detailed information about these two companies has also been provided to SFC, listed as Evidence 


3:ISS1_Info.mp3 and Evidence 4:ISS2_Info.mp3, but is not supplied here for security reasons. 





ISS1 told our investigator that Shenguan’s demand for cattle inner skin was about 70,000 tons a year. 





 
Evidence 5 – English Transcript of ISS1_Total Cattle Skin Volume.mp3 


 
Emerson investigator: For such a large plant as Shenguan, does it need 100,000 tons a year? Shouldn’t be as 
 much as 100,000 tons, right? 
ISS1: No, it’s only 70,000 tons. 
Emerson investigator: About 70,000 tons? 
ISS1: Yes. 
 


Source: Emerson Analytics 








Thus, one can see that the consumption of cattle inner skin calculated from collagen sausage casings sales 


volume is not that different from the consumption that we unearthed in our investigations. 





We’ll now base our analysis of Shenguan on the 70,000 tons of cattle inner skin consumption as provided 


by ISS1. 








1.2. Analysis of Cattle Inner Skin Price 


 
1.2.1. Whole piece or small pieces of skin? 





There is some price difference between a whole piece of cattle inner skin and small pieces of skin. Before 


we discuss the unit price of cattle inner skin we need to ascertain what kind of skin is used in Shenguan’s 


collagen sausage casings production. 





In its 2013 annual report, Shenguan says that it has begun to use whole pieces of cattle skin for its 


production. In p.9, it says that “in order to maintain better quality assurance and achieve production cost-


effectiveness, the Group started switching to larger pieces of cattle skin for raw material during the Year”. 


Then in p.11, it says that “… the extensive use of whole pieces of cattle inner layer skin, which has been 


proved to be more cost efficient …”.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

According to our understanding, most other collagen sausage casings manufacturers in China now use 


whole pieces of cattle inner skin for their production. Shandong Crown, the second largest manufacturer 


as we have mentioned previously, is one of them. The English transcript of the relevant audio recording 


of a conversation with our investigator follows: 





 
Evidence 6 – English Transcript of Shandong Crown_Whole Piece of Skin.mp3 


 
Emerson investigator: I mean can you use the inner skin of the head and neck (to make collagen sausage 
 casings)? 
Shandong Crown: No, no. We use whole skin. 
Emerson investigator: A whole piece of inner skin? 
Shandong Crown: Yes, yes. 
 
Shandong Crown: Shenguan is the biggest. 
Emerson investigator: Right. According to your understanding, do they use the whole piece of skin? 
Shandong Crown: They use the whole piece. 
Emerson investigator: The whole piece of inner skin? 
Shandong Crown: Yes.

ISS1 also confirmed to us that the company began to use whole pieces of inner skin from 2013. 





 
Evidence 7 – English Transcript of ISS1_Whole Piece of Skin.mp3 


 
Emerson investigator: When did Shenguan begin to use whole pieces of inner skin? 
ISS1: Last year. They made this requirement last year. 
Emerson investigator: Oh! They began using whole pieces of skin last year? 
ISS1: They wanted some breakthrough in quality. 
Emerson investigator: Whole pieces of skin are more expensive? 
ISS1: Whole pieces of skin are definitely more expensive.

1.2.2. Peer companies’ cattle inner skin price 





We asked some collagen sausage casings manufacturers for their cattle inner skin price on an anonymous 


basis. Shandong Crown and Zhongshan Baidefu told us their average price was about Rmb7,000 per ton 


in July.

Emerson investigator: What was the average price of cattle inner skin last year? 
Shandong Crown: It’s now a bit more than 7,000. 
Emerson investigator: Oh, more than 7,000? 
Shandong Crown: Yes, yes.

Zhongshan Baidefu is another collagen sausage casing manufacturer and is located in Guangdong 


province. Its core technical staff came from Shenguan. The following is a transcript, in English, of our 


conversation with its staff on cattle inner skin price:

Zhongshan Baidefu: We’re paying about Rmb7,000. 
Emerson investigator: How much? 
Zhongshan Baidefu: Rmb7,000.

1.2.3. Shenguan suppliers’ prices 





We have also asked Shenguan’s cattle inner skin suppliers for their prices. 





According to ISS1, their price was about Rmb7,000 per ton as of July. 





 
Evidence 10 – English Transcript of ISS1_Skin Price.mp3 





Emerson investigator: Your supplies to Shenguan now, how much are you charging them? 
ISS I: Rmb7,000 per ton. 
 


Source: Emerson Analytics 








The other supplier ISS2 told us their price was Rmb7,200 per ton (Evidence 11:ISS2_Skin Price.mp3). 





We use Rmb7,200 rather than Rmb7,000 per ton in our calculations because of the following reasons: 





- The prices from comparable companies are buyers’ prices which tend to be lower; 
- Shenguan buys much more from supplier ISS2 than from ISS1, and ISS2 quoted a price of 


Rmb7,200 a ton;
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 14 


- We checked cattle inner skin prices during June and July, the hot summer months when prices 
tended to be lower due to seasonal factor. That is to say, Rmb7,000-7,200 a ton are probably the 


lowest price for the year. The full year average price should be a bit higher.  








1.3. Cost of Cattle Inner Skin Analysis 





Based on our previous analysis, Shenguan used about 70,000 tons of cattle inner skin in 2013. With unit 


price at Rmb7,200 per ton inclusive of a 17% value-added tax (VAT), the total cost of cattle inner skin for 


Shenguan amounted to about Rmb430.8m, as shown below.

During our investigations, we have found another piece of evidence that supports our analysis that 


Shenguan spent about Rmb431m last year on cattle inner skin. This comes from industry peers’ 


assessments that Shenguan's overall unit cost is about Rmb0.25 per meter. They also admit that their unit 


costs are higher than Shenguan’s because the market leader enjoys a better economy of scale. They also 


noted that there’s no way their unit cost would be double that of Shenguan.

Shandong Crown: Shenguan’s unit cost is about Rmb0.25 per meter. 
Emerson investigator: Rmb0.25? 
Shandong Crown: If all our production lines are running, our unit cost can be about Rmb0.27. If we are 
 running fewer lines, then it’s Rmb0.29 or Rmb0.30.

Based on the unit cost and estimated sales volume discussed above, we believe Shenguan’s cost of sales 


in 2013 should have been about Rmb1,068m. 





In addition to raw materials costs, Shenguan’s cost of sales includes utilities (mainly water, electricity and 


coal), employee costs (salary and benefits) and other costs. 





Assuming that the company does not lie about its costs other than raw material costs, its total raw material 


costs in 2013 should have been Rmb676.9m, as shown below.

Shenguan’s raw materials for the production of collagen sausage casing products include cattle inner skin, 


other auxiliary materials such as glycerol, lime and cellulose, and packaging materials. 





The company has never disclosed its total cattle inner skin cost or the proportion of that cost to total raw 


material costs. We tried to clarify this issue with Ng Yuk-yeung, Shenguan’s financial controller, in July, 


but Ng declined to discuss anything with us, saying that he was due to attend a meeting. 





Subsequently, we found on the Internet an article published August 2, 2012 on Guangxi Daily, the official 


daily newspaper of Guangxi province, which is where Shenguan is based. According to the article 


(http://www.gxrb.com.cn/html/2012-08/02/content_713736.htm) retrieved on July 21, 2014, “the company 
bought cattle inner skin worth more than Rmb420m during 2008-2011”. 





This Rmb420m of cattle inner skin cost equals to about 65.1% of total raw materials costs during the 


period, as shown in the following table:

1.4. Summary of Cost 





The above two paths suggest that Shenguan's cattle inner skin cost was about Rmb431-440m in 2013. 


This was considerably more than the total raw materials cost of Rmb295.5m as disclosed by the company. 





To be conservative, we use the smaller number, Rmb430.8m, in our calculations. This means total cost of 


sales in 2013 should have been Rmb1,054.3m, about 53.5% higher than the disclosed amount, as shown 


in the following table:

Shenguan reminds us of Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd (LFT.N), a US-listed Chinese company 


which collapsed after Citron Research publicly accused it of committing fraud. Longtop’s insiders shifted 


its labor costs off the company’s books to an undisclosed related party, making Longtop’s performance 


stunning by comparison to its competitors. We believe that something similar may be happening with 


Shenguan.

Part 2. Analysis of Shenguan’s Average Selling Price 
 





2.1. The Unusual Premium Paid by Major Clients 





In addition to the problems with its raw materials costs as we have analyzed above, we also have grave 


doubts over Shenguan’s revenue. 





According to the company’s IPO prospectus, Shenguan’s average selling price (ASP) rose from Rmb0.39 


per meter in 2006 to Rmb0.41 in 2007 and Rmb0.44 in 2008.  





The IPO prospectus also discloses in p.101 that Shenguan’s single largest customer (which was 


Shuanghui Group, the largest meat products manufacturer in China recently listed on the Hong Kong 


stock market as WH Group (0288.HK), even though the prospectus does not actually name the company) 


accounted for 13.9%, 19.9% and 37.8%, respectively, of its total revenue during 2006-08. This implies 


that the company sold Rmb24.7m, Rmb51.7m and Rmb171.5m, respectively, of collagen sausage casings 


to its largest customer during the period. During the period, the corresponding sales volume was 49.2 


million meters, 88.5 million meters and 319.1 million meters, respectively, according to p.149 and p.153 


of the IPO prospectus. 





The following table presents the revenue, sales volume and ASP of Shenguan’s largest customer and all 


other customers. We can see that during 2006-08, ASPs of Shenguan’s largest customer were 33.4%, 53.0% 


and 37.4% higher, respectively, than the ASPs of all other customers. Average premium of 2006-2008 


was 41.3%.

This is clearly not a normal phenomenon. Generally speaking, large customers always enjoy some

discounts and in any case will not be paying a higher price for the same products. 





Perhaps Shenguan was selling something different to Shuanghui, some superior quality collagen sausage 


casings? The answer is NO! Shenguan’s collagen sausage casings are classified into two categories, first 


class products (which make up the bulk of sales) and sub-standard products (which are much cheaper). 





In fact, Shuanghui’s sales executive indicated to our investigator that Shuanghui’s prices are much below 


average, as demonstrated below. 





 
Evidence 13 – English Transcript of Shenguan Sales.mp3 


 
Emerson investigator: Is this Shenguan Holdings? 
Shenguan sales executive: Yes. 
Emerson investigator: I’d like to ask, what’s the price per meter of your sausage casings. 
Shenguan sales executive: What’s your diameter? 
Emerson investigator: From 18-23(mm). How much is 21? 


Shenguan sales executive: 0.54，with tax. 
Emerson investigator: That’s your first class product, right? 
Shenguan sales executive: Yes, first class product. 
Emerson investigator: Are you mostly selling first class products or do you have other classes? 
Shenguan sales executive: If you need first class products then I’ll send you first class products. If you want 
 sub-standard products I’ll give you sub-standard products. Sub-standard products 
 are priced different. 
Emerson investigator: How much is that? 
Shenguan sales executive: They are 40% off. We only have first class products and sub-standard products. 
Emerson investigator: Is that your lowest price? 
Shenguan sales executive: That’s our price. Everyone is the same. 
Emerson investigator: What about Shuanghui? 
Shenguan sales executive: Shuanghui? If you can reach the volume of Shuanghui I’ll give you the price of 
 Shuanghui. 
Emerson investigator: I can’t reach Shuanghui’s volume. 
Shenguan sales executive: Normally all our customers are given this price, except for a few special customers.

2.2. Estimate of Actual ASPs 





So, what is the real ASP actually achieved by Shenguan? 





According to Shenguan’s sales executive, except for a few special customers everyone buys at the same 


price. We assume that only the biggest customer enjoys a certain discount. This assumption is the most 


advantageous to Shenguan. During the 2006 to 2008 period, the proportion of sales volume to the largest 


customer rose from 10.8% to 14.0% and finally 30.6%. For simplicity’s sake we assume that this 


customer enjoyed a 10% discount throughout that period. We believe that it would not be unreasonable 


for a leading customer with a 10% share to enjoy a 10% discount, and that a 10% discount would be 


rather small for a customer with a 30% share. In other words, our assumptions are advantages to 


Shenguan.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 19 


If we assume that all the sales volume figures during the period were accurate and that the sales revenue 


(and hence ASP) numbers for all other customers were also accurate, and if we further assume that the 


largest customer’s ASPs were always 10% below those for all other customers, we can arrive at the actual 


sales revenue generated by the largest customer. 





According to our calculations, the actual ASP in 2008 was about 13% below the number disclosed by 


Shenguan.

After Shenguan was successfully listed on the Hong Kong market, it stopped disclosing details with 


regard to its single largest customer or major customers. It is therefore not possible to analyze the 


company’s actual ASPs for subsequent years in a similar manner. Experience tells us that this is a bad 


sign. 








2.3. Phony Sales to Zhongshan Defu 





Our skepticism with Shenguan’s sales does not stop at the ASPs for the largest customers. According to 


p.101 of Shenguan’s IPO prospectus, Zhongshan Defu was one of Shenguan’s five largest customers for 


the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. During 2006-08, Shenguan’s sales to Zhongshan Defu 


amounted to Rmb22.9m, Rmb28.8m and Rmb10.3m, respectively, representing approximately 12.8%, 


11.1% and 2.3% of the total. 





Zhongshan Defu was established on Aug 29, 2006 and was owned as to 90% by He Xiangji (何祥吉), a 


connected person at the time of the IPO. Our investigations into the business registration information of 


Zhongshan Defu suggested that Shenguan’s sales did not actually exist. Please see appendix for details of 


Zhongshan Defu’s business registration information.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 20 





In 2006, Zhongshan Defu achieved sales of merely Rmb1.8m. The IPO prospectus suggests that it bought 


Rmb22.9m of sausage casings from Shenguan in that year. How could a company with merely 


Rmb500,000 of registered capital buy such a large amount of sausage casings in merely four months? 


And how could its procurement amount to 12.7x of its sales in that year? 





In 2007, much the same happened. In 2008, Zhongshan Defu reported sales of Rmb13.3m on cost of sales 


of Rmb12.2m. While both figures were higher than the sales claimed by Shenguan, there was still a high 


degree of exaggeration. It is simply impossible for the cost of collagen sausage casings to amount to 84% 


of Zhongshan Defu’s cost of sales. 





Did Zhongshan Defu stock up all the collagen sausage casings that it bought from Shenguan? That’s also 


not possible. One can see from the following table that Zhongshan Defu’s total inventory never exceeded 


8% of the sales claimed by Shenguan. 





 
Exhibit 13 – Zhongshan Defu Key Financial Data 





Year end Dec (Rmb k) 2006 2007 2008 


Sales revenue from Zhongshan Defu claimed by Shenguan 22,900 28,800 10,300 


Sales revenue reported by Zhongshan Defu 1,807 7,325 13,308 


Cost of sales reported by Zhongshan Defu 1,679 6,655 12,199 


Inventory reported by Zhongshan Defu 1,227 2,287 651 
 


Sources: Shenguan, Zhongshan Defu SAIC Filings 








One can therefore confidently conclude that sales to Zhongshan Defu claimed by Shenguan were largely 


phony. 





If the sales revenues to the largest customer and another major customer disclosed by Shenguan in its IPO 


prospectus are exaggerated, one must doubt the integrity of the company’s financial statements 


throughout the years. 





We fully expect Shenguan to challenge our accusation regarding Zhongshan Defu by saying that business 


registration information is not publicly available and that it has no idea of Zhongshan Defu’s financial 


performance.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

Part 3. Other Abnormal Circumstances 
 





Based on our earlier analysis of Shenguan’s costs, sales revenues and average selling prices, one can see 


that the company’s financial statements are seriously flawed from 2006 through 2013. There are other 


abnormal circumstances with its financial statements, which we’ll discuss below. 








3.1. Did Ernst and Young Really Audit? 





Ernst and Young was the auditor who signed off the accountant’s report in Shenguan’s IPO prospectus 


and all subsequent annual reports. However, buried in small prints in p.I-3, in note 2 to the cover letter, in 


reference to Wuzhou Shenguan, the principal operating subsidiary, is this: 





 
Exhibit 14 – Ernst &Young Disclaimer in Shenguan IPO Prospectus 








Source: Shenguan IPO Prospectus 








In fact, all PRC registered subsidiaries were audited by Pengcheng! Ernst and Young only audited or 


reviewed companies registered in Hong Kong and BVI. But these were all holding companies with no 


real businesses.  





Shenzhen Pengcheng is a “famous” auditing firm. In May 2013, it had its securities business permit 


revoked by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Finance Ministry for its failure to 


perform due diligently in the IPO of Yunnan Green-Land Biological Technology Co Ltd (002200.SZ).  





Subsequent to Shenguan’s listing, Ernst and Young’s audit coverage further narrowed to exclude all BVI 


and some Hong Kong subsidiaries. For the 2009 annual report, just a few months after listing, E&Y only 


audited three Hong Kong subsidiaries, one of which was dormant. This has remained the case through the 


2013 annual report. However, Shenguan has not disclosed the identity of the auditor(s) for other 


subsidiaries after its IPO. 





 
Exhibit 15 – Note 16 to Shenguan’s 2013 Accounts 


 
Source: Shenguan 2013 annual report 








We regard this as a highly unusual arrangement. Shenguan is not a huge organization with dozens or even

 22 


hundreds of subsidiaries that have had a long relationship with other auditors. In late 2004, when the 


original state-owned Wuzhou Protein Factory was auctioned off and reorganized into a Sino-foreign joint 


venture (which would later become the listco), there might or might not have been an audit. Many 


companies (Chinese included) with existing audit relationship are willing to hire a new international 


auditor for their IPO and replace their old auditors.  





 
Exhibit 16 – Ernst & Young’s Audit Scope 








Source: Shenguan 








In Shenguan’s case, there is only one operating subsidiary that really matters, and it remains off limit to 


the international auditor even to this day, more than four years after the IPO.  





Given the disrepute of Shenzhen Pengcheng, does E&Y really know what’s going on inside Shenguan’s 


Mainland China operations? If it didn’t audit the Chinese subsidiaries, did it ever visit them? Why should 


any one have any confidence in this kind of audit?
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins

3.2. An Outrageous Acquisition 





Shenguan made an outrageous acquisition in mid-2011 to benefit its controlling shareholders and recycled 


31.3% of the IPO proceeds back to the controlling shareholder and her associates. The company 


announced on June 1, 2011 that it had agreed to acquire the entire share capital of Wuzhou Xiansheng 


Collagen Technologies Advisory Services Company Limited (梧州市先盛膠原蛋白技術諮詢服務有限公司) 


for Rmb372m. 





The acquisition was a connected transaction because Shenguan’s chairwoman held 35.6% of Wuzhou 


Xiansheng. However, as each of the relevant ratios (the size of the acquisition/target relative to the listed 


company in terms of asset, profit, revenue, equity capital and consideration) was less than 5%, the deal 


was a discloseable transaction that did not require shareholders’ approval. 





Wuzhou Xiansheng was set up in May 2006 with a registered capital of Rmb500,000. Zhou Yaxin, 


Shenguan’s controlling shareholder and chairwoman, was the major shareholder with a 72.4% stake, 


while six other individuals held 4.6% each. Three of them would later become Shenguan’s executive 


directors. The other three remained unconnected persons under the listing rules. In March 2008, He 


Xiangji of Zhongshan Defu bought 36.8% from Zhou at par value of the share capital. 





According to Shenguan’s announcement, Wuzhou Xiansheng’s main business was to provide consultancy 


services in respect of collagen and other biotechnologies, in addition to holding a 3% stake in Wuzhou 


Shenguan, the listco’s principal operating subsidiary. 





With regard to advisory services, did Wuzhou Xiansheng ever engage in any connected transactions with 


the listed company? The IPO prospectus and subsequent annual reports do not include Wuzhou 


Xiansheng in any discussions on connected transaction. Did it ever advise Shenguan’s competitors in 


collagen and other biotechnologies businesses? 





According to Shenguan’s June 2011 acquisition announcement, Wuzhou Xiansheng achieved net profit of 


Rmb75.8m in 2009 but only Rmb8.5m in 2010. We know that Shenguan’s principal operating subsidiary 


was (and still is) Wuzhou Shenguan, which in turn held (and still holds) 100% of all other group 


subsidiaries. This implies that all of the listco’s minority interest is Wuzhou Xiansheng’s share in 


Wuzhou Shenguan’s profit.

Exhibit 17 – Wuzhou Xiansheng’s Profit Analysis

   contribution from Wuzhou Shenguan 25,040 16,844 


   other businesses 50,800 -8,355 





Sources: Shenguan acquisition announcement, Emerson Analytics estimates 








If the profit attributable to minority shareholders reported by Shenguan was exactly the same as Wuzhou 


Xiansheng’s share in Wuzhou Shenguan’s profit, then we can see that in 2009 Wuzhou Xiansheng was 


doing some excellent businesses that generated about Rmb50.8m of net profit. But in 2010, Wuzhou 


Xiansheng’s fortune turned for the worst – its other businesses generated a loss of about Rmb8.4m. That’s 


a whopping Rmb59.2m downturn into the red! What happened? What sort of advisory business would 


generate Rmb50.8m of profit one year and Rmb8.4m of loss the next? What else did it do to deserve such 


misfortune? Could it ever regain its former glory in subsequent years, after being sold to Shenguan. 





The Shenguan acquisition announcement says that the acquisition price of Rmb372m was arrived at after 


arm’s length negotiations between Shenguan and Wuzhou Xiansheng’s shareholders, half of whom (in 


terms of both number of persons and percentage interest) were buyers and sellers at the same time. In any 


case, it said the price was determined “with reference to 3% of the average of the market capitalization of 


the Company from April 2011 to mid of May 2011”. 





On the surface, that seems a fair valuation method. However, as we have shown above, Wuzhou 


Xiansheng’s other businesses just reported a loss in 2010. The listco was therefore buying Wuzhou 


Xiansheng at about 44x historical P/E. That’s expensive by almost any benchmark, especially given that 


nothing is known about Wuzhou Xiansheng’s other businesses. 








3.3. Steadily Declining Staff Cost 





The following table shows Shenguan’s employee benefit expenses, director’ remuneration and headcount 


for the 2010-2013 period. The footnotes indicate the page numbers for the corresponding items in the 


company’s 2013 annual report. 





In the following table, average monthly wage = (Employee benefit expense - directors' remuneration) * 


1,000 / (simple average headcount) / 12. For example, in 2013, average monthly wage = (132,591 - 


11,428) * 1000 / ((4000 + 3900) / 2) / 12 = Rmb2,556 per month.
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 25 


According to our calculations, in 2012 and 2013, Shenguan’s average monthly wage fell 9.3% and 17.5%, 


respectively, from the year-ago levels. In two years, average wage fell 25.1% to Rmb2,556 a month from 


Rmb3,414 a month. 





During the past few years, China’s average wages have consistently grown at double-digit rates every 


year. Shenguan claimed that it had been doing roaring businesses but managed to reduce its average 


monthly wage substantially. This is totally unbelievable!

3.4. R&D Costs Included in Cost of Sales? 





The following table shows Shenguan’s research and development (R&D) costs from 2006 through 2013. 


We can see that the company’s R&D budget has grown rapidly over the years. In 2012, the company 


spent as much as Rmb215m in R&D to account for whopping 13.1% of sales! Is it a pharmaceutical 


company? Most food and beverages companies spend less than 1% on R&D. Even Apple Inc. (AAPL.O)

However, in 2013, the company did not disclose such an important cost item. When one compares the 


2012 and 2013 annual reports, one can see that the 2012 figure is completely omitted in the 2013 annual 


report.

Exhibit 20 – Shenguan Note 6 in 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports 








Source: Shenguan annual reports 








R&D costs are presented in the item “Note 6: Profit Before Tax” in the notes to the accounts of 


Shenguan’s annual reports, and are deductible from revenues in the consolidated statement of profit and 


loss and other comprehensive income. Normally, R&D costs are included in administrative expenses. 


According to p.141 of Shenguan’s IPO prospectus, “administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries 


and benefits for our management and administrative staff, depreciation of PP&E used for administrative 


purposes, amortization of technical know how, office supplies expenses, lease expenses, and other 


miscellaneous expenses”. We can see that R&D costs are not part of administrative costs. In any case, the 


Rmb215.6m R&D costs in 2012 far exceeded the Rmb81.2m administrative expenses in the same year. 





If R&D costs were not part of administrative costs, were they part of cost of sales? If yes, that was a very 


strange accounting treating. In 2012, Shenguan reported total cost of sales of Rmb689.3m. After taking 


out Rmb215.6m of R&D costs, Shenguan’s manufacturing cost would have come to Rmb0.112 per meter 


of collage sausage casing, 60% lower than those of its competitors. Obviously this is impossible. 





It baffles us why Shenguan bothers to make up its R&D spending because it doesn’t really fit anywhere in 


the income statement. Perhaps the company wants to impress investors that its super-high margins could 


be explained by unusually high R&D spending? We are convinced that it has gone too far in fabricating a 


“sexy” story. 








3.5. An Absurd Industry Ranking by www.chinacasing.cn 


 



http://www.chinacasing.cn/
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 27 


Shenguan claims in p.88 of its IPO prospectus that, according to the ranking published by China Meat 


Association (中国肉类协会), it was the largest manufacturer of edible collagen sausage casing products in 


China from 2006 to 2008 based on such criteria as total assets, revenue, market share and market 


reputation4. 





The IPO prospectus also claims that China Sausage Casing Net (中国肠衣网) (www.chinacasing.cn) was 


one of the official websites of China Meat Association, a not-for-profit national organization registered 


with the Ministry of Civil Administration (中国民政部)
5
. 





So, what is China Sausage Casing Net and is it really related to China Meat Association? 





If one is willing to spare a few minutes for this website, http://www.chinacasing.cn/index.htm, one will 


see that although it seems to provide a lot of information, there is actually little substance behind. For 


example, the “Interviews with Officials”
6
 column consisted of only 10 items, three published in 2013, two 


in 2011, one in 2005 and four in 2004. It rather looks like a website run by an amateur who’s busy with 


other things and have little time to take care of it. 





We checked with China Meat Association, and its staff confirmed that China Sausage Casing Net was not 


its affiliate. The audio clip, Evidence 14:CMA_Chinacasing.mp3, is not exhibited here but has been 


provided to SFC. 





The IPO prospectus says in p.67 that “the information extracted from the China Sausage Casing Net (中国


肠衣网) for disclosure in this prospectus is not commissioned by our Company, and can be accessed by the 


public free of charge”. Towards the top of the home page on www.chinacasing.cn one can see a list of 


rankings. The rankings for collagen sausage casings can be found in the following webpage: 


http://www.chinacasing.cn/hy50q.asp?cid=%C8%CB%B9%A4%B3%A6%D2%C210%C7%BF. In this 


page are rankings from 2005-2013 except for 2009, which is blank. A casual perusal reveals that the 


rankings for 2006-2008 are exactly the same, while those for 2010-2013 are also exactly the same. The 


only difference between the first batch (the 2006-2008 lists) and the second batch (the 2010-2013 lists) is 


the number two-ranked company. In the first batch it was a Beijing company, and in the second batch it 


was a Tianjin company. All through those years, none of these companies moved up or down the rankings 


at all. The Tianjin company simply jumped into number two out of nowhere in 2010, when the Beijing 


company disappeared without a trace. The rankings seem to be tailor-made for Shenguan. 





We searched the registration information of China Sausage Casing Net (www.chinacasing.cn), and found 


that it was registered by an individual named He Zhonghua, as shown below. This person is associated 


with 81 other domains. 





This is clearly an amateur website run by a private citizen who may well be a crook. The website then 


publishes some phony rankings which include irrelevant entities and show only one change over a seven 


year period (skipping 2009). The rankings (for 2006-2008) then made its way into an IPO prospectus that 


helped a company raise Rmb1.2bn! How did the professional advisers do their due diligence?

Part 4. Financial Analysis and Valuation 
 
 
4.1. Ridiculously High Margins 





As we have seen, Shenguan has been concealing its costs and inflating its revenues for years. As a result, 


it has been reporting absurdly high margins when compared with industry peers. 





Globally, there are two international giants in collagen sausage casings. Devro PLC (DVO.L) is a UK-


based company. Its revenue in 2013 was about one-third bigger than that of Shenguan. Viscofan Group 


(VIS.MC) is a Spanish giant almost four times the size of Shenguan, as shown in the following chart. 





 
Exhibit 22 – Revenue of Comparable Peers 








Sources: Company annual reports 








In terms of EBIT margins, during the 2010-2013 period, all three companies had very stable margins, 


though Shenguan’s were about three times better at around 50% while the other two were generally at the 


mid- to high-teens. This is totally incredible.

Exhibit 23 – EBIT Margins of Comparable Peers 








Sources: Company annual reports, Emerson Analytics estimates 








Although no one Chinese collagen sausage casing manufacturer is publicly listed, we have managed to 


find some information about Liuzhou Honsen when it was taken over by Qinghai Gelatin Company 


Limited (000606.SZ) in 2012. As one can see from the following table, Shenguan’s gross margins are 


much higher than those of its competitors. 





 
Exhibit 24 – Gross Margins of Comparable Peers 





Year end Dec 31 2009 2010 2011 


Shenguan (00829.HK) 61.1% 60.6% 61.9% 


Devro (DVO.L) 29.8% 33.6% 37.3% 


Liuzhou Honsen 10.7% 26.1% 23.3%

Note: Data for Liuzhou Honsen can be found in p.10 of http://www.cninfo.com.cn/finalpage/2012-03-
08/60640486.PDF 
 


Liuzhou Honsen may be much smaller than Shenguan but it is difficult to believe that their gross margins 


can be so different. Devro is quite a bit bigger than Shenguan and therefore a long way bigger than 


Liuzhou Honsen, Its gross margins are moderately better than those of Liuzhou Honsen but much inferior 


to Shenguan’s. The gap is just too big to be credible.

4.2. Estimating Historical Real Profitability 





We think that the company had been doctoring its books since day one, when it first entertained the idea 


of going public. The evidence? The consistently high gross margins, which fluctuated between a low of 


52.5% in 2007 and a high of 61.9% in 2011. 





The following table shows our attempt to reconstruct Shenguan’s actual profitability by eliminating its 


inflated revenue and fully recognizing its raw materials costs over the years.

* Our estimates
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 32 





Earlier, we have shown that Shenguan’s ASP was actually 4.5%, 8.2% and 13% below the reported level 


during 2006-2008, respectively. The price gap mounted steadily mainly because the largest customer 


accounted for an increasingly large proportion of Shenguan’s sales volume, from about 10% in 2006 to 


more than 30% in 2008. In subsequent years, Shenguan ceased to disclose sales volume to its major 


customers, but still revealed that sales revenue to the biggest customer accounted for 30-40% of total. To 


keep it simple, we’ll assume that the actual ASP (or what we’ll call adjusted ASP in the above table) held 


stable at 13% below the reported number during 2009-2013. On this basis, Shenguan has probably 


exaggerated its sales by about Rmb966m during the eight years from 2006-2013. 





There was no change in the sales volume. This assumption is advantages to Shenguan, because we are 


ignoring the issue of phony sales to Zhongshan Defu (and possibly other customers). 





On the cost front, we have earlier shown that the actual raw materials cost was about 124.3% of the 


number reported by Shenguan for 2013 (see Exhibit 10). We’ll use this ratio to adjust all raw materials 


costs during 2006-2013, and assume that all other cost items were accurate. In aggregate, Shenguan’s 


controlling shareholders have probably shaved some Rmb1.66bn of costs off the company’s income 


statement. 





We also adjust Shenguan’s profit tax by referring to the effective tax rate reported by the company. This 


results in a smaller tax charge due to the higher actual cost base and hence lower earnings before interest 


and tax (EBIT). 





In aggregate, Shenguan has exaggerated its profit by about Rmb2.14bn during the 2006-2013. 





Using 2013 as an example, the main differences between Shenguan’s reported numbers and our estimates 


are shown in the following table. Our calculations suggest that Shenguan’s 2013 net income was probably 


about Rmb290.3m or 62.4% below the Rmb771.3m reported by the company. 





 
Exhibit 26 – 2013 Profitability (Shenguan Reports Vs Our Estimates) 





Year end Dec 31 (Rmb m) Shenguan’s Report Our Estimates Difference(%) 


ASPs(Rmb/meter) 0.387 0.337 -13.0% 


Revenue 1,654 1,439 -13.0% 


Cost of sales -687 -1,054 53.5% 


 - Raw materials & consumables -295 -663 124.3% 


Profit attributable to equity holders 771 290 -62.4% 
 


Sources: Company annual reports, Emerson Analytics estimates 
 


Based on our estimates, Shenguan’s EBIT margin was 19.8% in 2013, still better than those of Devro and 


Viscofan but less than half of the 52.4% reported by the company. As shown in the following chart, our 


estimated EBIT margin for Shenguan is more in line with the international norm.

Exhibit 27 – 2013 EBIT Margin Comparison

4.3. Recovery of “Subsidies” and the Truth of High Dividend Ratio 





Our analysis above clearly demonstrates that Shenguan’s actual profitability in 2013 was easily 60% 


below that reported by the company. 





At this point, the fundamental question must be asked: Why are the controlling shareholders “subsidizing” 


minority shareholders? They haven’t significantly reduced their stake in the company, so what do they 


gain? And even if the company’s profit margins are too good to be true, does the high dividend payout 


ratio suggest that it has real money in the banks? 





To be honest, we cannot answer such questions on behalf of the controlling shareholders. However, we do 


know one thing, controlling shareholders are not philanthropists when it comes to dealing with minority 


shareholders. 





Let’s go back to where the story began, when Shenguan raised Rmb1.2bn in its October 2009 IPO. If the 


company were to reveal its financial performance truthfully, that is to say, a profit merely 30% of the 


purported numbers, the IPO would not have been attractive and the company certainly would not have 


been able to raise Rmb1.2bn. After the listing, the market value of the shares and the presence of minority 


shareholders have allowed the controlling shareholders to recover their “subsidies” through various 


means. 





We have shown earlier, in section 3.2, how the controlling shareholders swapped their residual 3% stake 


in the principal operating subsidiary for a staggering Rmb372m not even two years after the IPO. From
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 34 


what we can see, there are at least two other ways the controlling shareholders can recover their 


“subsidies” to minority shareholders. 





Barely one year after the IPO, on October 20, 2010, Shenguan announced that its controlling shareholders 


had agree to sell 69.77m shares in Shenguan to a number of investors at HK$8.60 each, raising a total of 


HK$600m or Rmb515m based on the October 2010 month-end exchange rate of HK$0.8587 to Rmb1.00. 





We do note that in the last couple of years the major shareholder and chairwoman Zhou Yaxin has bought 


a few million Shenguan shares at the market. This is really insignificant compared to her stock sale in 


2010, not just in terms of volume but also in terms of price. 





The 2010 share disposal and the 2011 stake sale gave Rmb887m to the controlling shareholders without a 


dent to their tight grip on the listco. There is yet a third path for them to recover their “subsidies”, and that 


is through dividend payment. 





For a company growing at a whopping 57% compound annual rate (during the 2006-2010 period), a 44% 


dividend payout ratio in 2010 was indeed quite generous. Subsequently, payout ratio has been maintained 


at rather high levels of 41-65%. As can be seen from the following table, controlling shareholders have 


collected Rmb1.05bn in dividends since listing. 





 
Exhibit 28 – Shenguan Dividend Analysis 





Year end Dec 31 (Rmb m) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total 


Shenguan attributable profit 326.1 513.5 689.3 748.2 771.3 3,048.3 


Dividend declared 67.3 226.9 279.5 413.0 500.2 1,486.9 


   minority shareholders 18.6 63.0 83.5 123.2 149.3 437.6 


   controlling shareholders 48.6 163.9 196.1 289.8 350.9 1,049.3 


Payout ratio 20.6% 44.2% 40.6% 55.2% 64.9% 48.8% 





Sources: Shenguan annual reports, Emerson Analytics estimates 








The following exhibit shows Shenguan controlling shareholders’ money trail. Over the years, they 


“subsidized” listco’s manufacturing costs to the tune of some Rmb1.66bn. However, they have so far 


collected about Rmb1.94bn by selling a tiny stake in Wuzhou Xiansheng, disposing of listco shares and 


collecting their share of dividend. 





Looking at the controlling shareholders and the listco as an organic whole (the red box in the following 


chart), we can see that they have pocketed Rmb1.71bn since 2009 by paying public shareholders merely 


Rmb0.44bn. This is the truth about Shenguan’s high dividend payout ratio.

 35 


 
Exhibit 29 – Recovery of Controlling Shareholders’ “Subsidies” 








Sources: Company annual reports, Emerson Analytics estimates 








4.4. Valuation 





Our analysis above clearly demonstrates that Shenguan’s actual profitability is easily 60% below that 


reported by the company. 





If we generously accord the company the same valuation in terms of P/E multiple, the stock should trade 


at about HK$1.1 per share compared with the current HK$2.8. 





Our judgment on Shenguan is more lenient than that on China Lumena New Materials, which we said 


should be delisted. As shown in our report published on April 1, 2014, China Lumena simply made up a 


whole load of non-existent businesses and siphoned away billions of dollars from the company. 





A few final words. 





If the controlling shareholders have been “subsidizing” minority shareholders by paying for part of the 


raw material costs out of their own pocket, they have by now more than made up their costs by collecting
The Thick Skin of Shenguan’s High Margins 


 36 


Rmb1.94bn through various channels and still control a listed company that could not possibly have 


raised anything near Rmb1.2bn in its IPO in 2009. 





But all schemes of deception must end one day. The question is how. The really smart guys will wind it 


down slowly before the s--- hits the fan, and the greedy ones (i.e. the ones who think they are very smart) 


will act too late so that it all end in tears. We are not sure how Shenguan will end, but there are signs that 


it is winding down after it reported two consecutive years of single-digit growth in 2012 and 2013, with 


interim profit declines in both 1H13 and 1H14. 





But are they fast enough? Or are we faster?
