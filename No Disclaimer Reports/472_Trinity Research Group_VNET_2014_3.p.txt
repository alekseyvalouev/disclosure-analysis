Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group
Sep. 17, 2014 9:30 AM ET62 comments
by: TrinityResearch


Summary


VNET co-founders Chen Sheng and Zhang Jun (CEO and former COO) directly and
indirectly control numerous related parties that have not been disclosed to the SEC.
We count 16 such.


Eight (8) members of VNET’s executive team and one (1) former employee are legal
representatives, directors, managers or supervisors of these companies. None of
these relationships have been disclosed.


Some of these companies have engaged in undisclosed transactions with VNET or
VNET’s disclosed related parties.


VNET co-founders indirectly control and therefore personally benefit from a related
party that competes with VNET. This violates the non-compete clause of any
standard employment contract enforced as a governance.


All these insider activities put into question the credibility of VNET’s management
and its board of directors, who we believe are not upholding their fiduciary duties.


1. The SEC's Related Party Disclosure Requirements


The SEC requires disclosure of related parties and related party transactions for all
companies listed on a US stock exchange such as 21 Vianet Group ("VNET"). The SEC
defines a related party as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 2/25


Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 57, Related Party Disclosures,
paragraphs 2 through 4 [AC section R36.102-.104], contains the disclosure
requirements for related party relationships and transactions. The glossary of that
Statement [AC section R36.406] defines related parties as follows:


Affiliates of the enterprise; entities for which investments are accounted for by the
equity method by the enterprise; trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension
and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of
management; principal owners of the enterprise; its management; members of
the immediate families of principal owners of the enterprise and its
management; and other parties with which the enterprise may deal if one party
controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from
fully pursuing its own separate interests. Another party also is a related party if it can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting
parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the
transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.


2. VNET's Undisclosed Related Parties


VNET's latest 20-F for fiscal year 2013, makes various related party disclosures on page
F-63.


Exhibit 1: VNET's 2013 related party disclosures
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 3/25


We call to your attention the five related companies highlighted in Exhibit 1, all of which
were sold to allegedly unrelated "third parties":


1. 21 Vianet Beijing Intelligence Energy System Technology ("21V BJ")
2. Ningbo 21Vianet Information Technology Co., Ltd ("21V NB")
3. 21Vianet Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd ("21V FS")
4. Tianjin Yunlifang Technology Co., Ltd. ("Tianjin Yunlifang")
5. 21ViaNet Engineering Technology Services Co., Ltd ("VEE")


Footnote 1 of the 20-F states these five companies are to be considered unrelated after
their sale. Since we found inconsistencies between SAIC and SEC filings for VNET in our
first report we were naturally suspicious and investigated these companies' SAIC
registrations. We also ran a search on the SAIC database for all companies either directly
or indirectly controlled or otherwise affiliated with VNET or a VNET insider.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 4/25


We were not surprised to find the fingerprints of VNET's co-founders all over many
allegedly unrelated third parties. Other than VNET's VIE aBitCool Beijing Limited and its
holding company aBitCool Limited, our SAIC search returned 21 companies that either by
name, ownership or indirect control showed ties to VNET, its affiliates or their agents.
Exhibit 2 charts the legal corporate structure of these 21 companies (we suspect there are
even more we did not find). Screen shots of the SAIC registered ownership information for
the key companies highlighted below are included in the appendix.


Here are the highlights.


Chen Sheng and Zhang Jun are VNET co-founders (the "Co-Founders"). Chen
Haiying, Chen Li and Chen Wang (note the common last name "Chen") as well as Ye
Jiaxin ("Ye") are allegedly unrelated third parties
The blue arrows designate current ownership/control, while the dotted red arrows
designate ownership/control through 8/15/2012, when ownership was transferred to
third parties. The gold dotted arrow designates control of investments
The blue company is a principal operating entity of VNET and is consolidated
The green companies are disclosed related parties
The yellow companies are controlled by the Co-Founders directly or Chen Li and Ye,
the only shareholders of BCM, a related party company per the 20-F[1]

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 5/25


Since Chen Li and Ye are by definition related parties to VNET, how can the
companies they control not also be related or at the very least be under the influence
of VNET's co-founders?
The white companies are very likely to be related parties although no information in the
20-F makes them obviously so (as is the case with the yellow companies)


The first thing to note is that Chen Li and Ye are agents of the Co-founders. The 2013 20-
F identifies BitCoolMedia Group Limited ("BCM") as a related party controlled by VNET's
Class B Common stock holders [2], a class that only the co-founders control, with Chen
Sheng as the majority shareholder. SAIC filings (see Appendix) show Chen Li and Ye as
the only shareholders of BCM.


The problem is that Chen Li and Ye are not disclosed in any SEC filing and the various
companies they control (most of the yellow ones) either directly or indirectly through
holding companies are also not disclosed in any SEC filing. This is a major problem. It is
not just a governance red flag, it is also against the very spirit of SEC's insider and related
party disclosure regulations.


For example, Chen Li directly controls Beijing Xienshitong Technology ("XEST"), which is
not disclosed. Chen Li and Ye together control Beijing Wanwei Huoju Network Technology
("WWHJ"), also not disclosed. Their control of WWHJ gives them indirect control of four of
the five companies (21V BJ, 21V NB, Tianjin Yunlifang and VEE) that were allegedly sold
to unrelated "third parties" per the 2013 20-F. (Although we were not able to find the fifth
company in the SAIC database, we expect that company too is controlled by an agent of
the co-founders but may not have been registered with the SAIC.)


Now look at the dotted red arrows from the co-founders to WWHJ. WWHJ was a disclosed
related party to VNET until the 2012 20-F, where the co-founders disclosed a sale of their
shares to "third parties" [3]. Who were those third parties? None other than Chen Li and
Ye Jiaxin, WWHJ's only shareholders.


VNET would have you believe WWHJ and five other formerly related parties were sold to
completely unrelated third parties, but it sure looks like they were all transferred to agents
of the co-founders, does it not?


The obvious questions you might be asking are the same ones we would like to ask
VNET's board of directors. Why are these yellow companies (and possibly more we did
not find) not disclosed to the SEC as related parties? Why are agents of the co-founders
not disclosed by name in the 20-Fs and are instead referred to as unrelated "third
parties"? Who else is involved in these undisclosed activities?

We could only find an answer to that last question.


3. VNET's Executive Team Members Are In on It Too


As we investigated the SAIC filings for all the companies in Exhibit 2, we found that
members of VNET's executive team are quietly moonlighting in various roles at VNET's
allegedly unrelated parties. We have summarized the affiliations below in Exhibit 3 and
included SAIC screen shots in the appendix.


Exhibit 3: Management Team Members' Roles in Companies Allegedly Unrelated to VNET


All but four of the 21 companies in Exhibit 3 we identified as related, related but not
disclosed or otherwise highly suspicious have an official of some sort from VNET's
management team. Eight members of VNET's management team and one former
employee are involved.


4. Undisclosed Transactions


Since all 21 of the companies listed in Exhibit 2 are in the data center industry, and most
are suppliers to companies like VNET, the opportunity for conflicts of interest is quite high.


4.1 Yunlifang



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17/29409765-14109328070561705-TrinityResearch_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 7/25


Consider the case of Tianjin Yunlifang, one of the five companies that was sold to "third
parties" in 2013. Yunlifang, according to its own website is a manufacturer of computing
cubes used to build data centers. Yunlifang is 100% owned by 21 Vianet Engineering
Technology Services, which is controlled by Chen Li and Ye, agents of VNET's co-
founders.


Yunlifang's website shows at least three projects that resulted in transactions with VNET,
such as the building of the Beijing Yizhuang and Foshan data centers.


Exhibit 4: Yunlifang's Website Shows Undisclosed Transactions with VNET

5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 8/25


Yunlifang's website shows at least three projects that resulted in transactions with VNET,
such as the building of the Beijing Yizhuang and Foshan data centers.


In the press release above, Yunlifang announced that it took two months to manufacture
and build nine 52U container computing cubes for VNET subsidiary 21Vianet Anhui
Suzhou Technology Co., Ltd. in Suzhou, Anhui province. The project started on October
2012, two months after VNET's co-founders transferred their direct control of WWHJ,
which controls Yunlifang, to their agents Chen Li and Ye Jiaxin. The timing of the transfer
was certainly convenient if the intent was hiding the project from scrutiny as a related
party transaction.


Why are these transactions not disclosed to the SEC? Why did the founders transfer
control of WWHJ right before this major project? Why is it OK for VNET to do business
with an undisclosed party controlled by its co-founders without investors knowing the
exact terms of every transaction?


4.2 Beijing Xienshitong Technology ("XEST")


Another notable case of a clear conflict of interest is XEST. As we know from Exhibit 2,
XEST is controlled directly by Chen Li, one of the co-founders' agents who holds over
50% equity interest.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 9/25


Pages F-48 and F-49 of the 2013 20-F disclose an RMB 100 million investment in
Yizhuang Venture Investment Fund by 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. (one of
VNET's principal operating entities [4]).


Exhibit 5: VNET's Disclosed Investment in Yizhuang


Although Yizhuang Fund is not disclosed as a related party, at least the investment, which
is material and as large as most of VNET's past acquisitions, is disclosed. What is not
disclosed is that Yizhuang Fund is controlled by Yizhuang 21Vianet Venture Capital
Investment Center LLP ("YVVC"), an undisclosed related party.


Exhibit 6: SAIC filing of Beijing Yizhuang 21Vianet Venture Capital Investment Center LLP


VNET also failed to disclose that YVVC went on to invest in XEST, a company that is
controlled by Chen Li. In other words, VNET used shareholder capital to make a material
investment in a fund that then invested in a company (not disclosed as a related party)
controlled by an agent of the co-founders.


Why was this clear conflict of interest not disclosed?

5. Undisclosed Ownership of Directly Competitive Company


As bad as all that seems for VNET's governance, it gets worse. As Exhibit 2 shows,
VNET's co-founders directly control two undisclosed related parties: aBitCool Network
Technology and aBitCool XiaoWei Network Beijing ("XiaoWei"). One of them, XiaoWei,
controls SH Guotong Network, a company disclosed as a related party (see Exhibit 1) that
operates an MNS business.


There are two major governance problems with that. First, SH Guotong competes with
VNET's MNS subsidiaries. Below is a screen shot of a recent bandwidth reseller auction
run by China Mobile that shows two competitive bidders for China Mobile's business:
VNET and SH Guotong.


Exhibit 7: SH Guotong Competes with VNET in Bandwidth Reselling


No CEO or COO should ever own an undisclosed interest in a company that competes
with the very company they are allegedly running in the best interest of shareholders.
Making matters worse is that the business they control is an illegal one that is not allowed
to resell bandwidth it purchases from state-owned fixed line telcos China Telecom and
China Unicom [5].

6. Conclusion


The byzantine corporate structure of interrelated companies in Exhibit 2 appears to have
been set up to obfuscate VNET co-founders' effective control in companies with which
VNET does business. These relationships and the transactions with VNET have not been
disclosed to American investors through SEC filings, but those with the ability to do some
research through the SAIC can verify these relationships.


Moreover, VNET's co-founders have implicated half a dozen senior employees of VNET in
their undisclosed insider activities, using them as officers of their undisclosed companies.
These are senior employees who investors expect to be single-mindedly focused
professionally on running VNET.


As if that were not enough, the co-founders also control a business that is directly
competitive to VNET's MNS subsidiaries. Like VNET's MNS business, this competitive
undisclosed related party is not licensed to resell bandwidth and is therefore operating
illegally.


That all of the above represents atrocious governance not fit for a public company listed
on a US exchange is one matter. It is quite another that such atrocious governance is in
direct violation of the SEC's disclosure laws. We urge the regulators and E&Y, VNET's
independent auditor, to investigate these findings immediately and take appropriate
corrective action.
