China Finance Online Response To GeoInvesting Report Falls Flat

Summary


On Thursday, China Finance Online (JRJC) responded to our critical report by
claiming that it contained numerous errors of facts.


The response fails to prove we made any factual errors, and actually affirms our
findings that Chairman Zhao resigned from his positions at three key JRJC VIE
subsidiaries.


A Chinese media article out by Tencent the day after our report supports the
conclusions we’ve drawn.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


On Wednesday, we released an article titled "China Finance Online: CEO Resigns from
Key Posts in China Amid Anti-Corruption Probe," which pointed out:


The most current SAIC records show China Finance Online (NASDAQ:JRJC)
Chairman and CEO Zhiwei Zhao suddenly resigned from his positions at three key
Chinese VIE subsidiaries of JRJC over the past few months.
This development had not been disclosed by management. Additionally, Zhao was
also mysteriously absent from JRJC's March 23, 2015 fourth quarter earnings
conference call.
Chinese media reports exposing the detention of JRJC independent director
Rongquan Leng prompted JRJC to announce his resignation, without addressing his
alleged detention.
Chinese media reports also indicate serious legal troubles for associates of Zhao, who
himself is reportedly not allowed to leave China.
Ling Wang, a former long-time JRJC director and associate of Zhao, fled China in
2014, leaving his company indebted to JRJC for $25 million.


That article is available here and we encourage reading it in its entirety.

On Thursday, China Finance Online issued a "Rebuttal to Short Seller Article" in which it
claimed that the "Geoinvesting report contains numerous errors of facts," without actually
proving that any of the facts presented in our report were untrue.


JRJC's "rebuttal" actually affirms many of the key facts supporting our findings, as follows:


1. JRJC did not deny that Chairman and CEO Zhiwei Zhao resigned from management
positions at 3 key VIE subsidiaries. Zhao's resignations, in our opinion, are extremely
negative events that investors would not consider to be a "normal course of action."
Unless, such action was, in fact, a response to serious legal problems faced by Zhao.


2. JRJC did not deny the media reports that Zhao is in legal trouble.
3. JRJC confirmed that Zhao was not on the last conference call, citing health reasons.
4. JRJC provided no evidence (photos, interviews, public appearances) that could easily


confirm that Zhao is free to run the company since the December 2014 conference
call.


5. JRJC claims Zhao has never been subject to travel restrictions. However, a new report
by Tencent Prism dated June 4, 2015 claims that Zhao has not traveled since a
December 6, 2014 flight from Shanghai to Beijing. The article also claims that Zhao
requested an extended vacation from working at JRJC. Chinese media reports thus
continue to contradict claims made by JRJC.


6. JRJC did not deny that Rongquan Leng found himself in serious legal trouble and was
detained.


7. JRJC did not deny that Ling Wang got into serious legal trouble and fled China.
8. JRJC disputed the related party issue regarding the Langfang project, but without


providing any evidence.
9. JRJC pointed out Zhao's purported $7 purchase of JRJC shares from IDG when the


stock was below $3 (actually at $1.93 on November 2, 2011, the day Zhao entered into
the purchase agreement). Investors can judge for themselves the likelihood that such
a fantastical purchase premium had any real economic substance, or was possibly
contingent upon other undisclosed factors.


JRJC's rebuttal hardly deserves any further analysis, but we did take a closer look at one
key point that states:


… Mr. Zhiwei Zhao remains the CEO and Chairman of the Company. The changes of legal
representatives and management positions in affiliate companies are a normal course of
action. This happens in many companies. Geoinvesting's reading and analysis aimed to
feed into their speculation that Mr. Zhao is in legal trouble.
