TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert regarding Cool Holdings (AWSM)! 
Cool Holdings (AWSM), we believe, may be at the beginning of a pump-and-dump effort. 
The company is driving stockholders’ investments to slaughter with regurgitated, deceptive, bo
claiming an unbelievable opportunity with a $1 trillion company. 
The stock shot to record highs this week as stockholders bit on the promotions.

In light of those facts, consider these curiously timed events: 


 September 10th, Cool is REGISTERED TO SELL $25 million worth of stock. This looming shelf of sto
 Three days later, Cool settled debts by issuing officers and a race car driver about 600,000 sh

The company is all about promotions, so let’s begin there.
