ServiceNow: Insiders Dumping Shares Indicates Overvaluation

As detailed in our previous article and full report, we believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW
or the "Company") is grossly overvalued. Our research indicates that growth will become
incrementally more challenging, as much of the 'low-hanging fruit' (i.e. BMC's dissatisfied
customers) has already been captured, the limited ITSM market size places a ceiling on
the Company's revenue potential, and SaaS alternatives to NOW emerge in the ever-
changing ITSM sector. Should revenue growth continue to slow, we think that investors
will begin to recommit themselves to a more sober valuation, given ServiceNow's current
$5bn market capitalization versus $239m of 2012E revenue.


Our concern with NOW's stock price appears shared. Two weeks ago, ServiceNow's early
investors began selling NOW shares well ahead of their original lock-up schedule.
ServiceNow's June 2012 IPO Prospectus disclosed a lock-up agreement that prevented
insider sales until December 26th. But on November 9th, six weeks ahead of the original
lock-up expiration, ServiceNow waived these lock-up commitments and allowed insiders
(primarily JMI Equity, a 50% shareholder) to sell 14.2m shares at $28.00 (Nov 15th
Prospectus, Nov 20th Press Release). That equates to approximately $400 million worth
of NOW shares that were dumped on the public markets by insiders.


In addition to the large insider share sale, ServiceNow itself diluted existing shareholders
with the issuance of 1.9m new shares (Nov 20th Press Release). We question the
intentions of this dilutive offering since the Company already had $256.5m of cash as of

Q3 (10-Q), seemingly more than enough to fund organic growth. We think the capital raise
was a sign that management itself believed the stock was overvalued, and wanted to raise
capital at inflated prices before the stock price declined to more rational levels.


This combination of insider sales and fresh equity fundraising activity could encourage
investors to shift their attention towards grounded fundamental analysis rather than the
amorphous hype that currently envelops the stock.


Growth has Slowed since NOW was Priced at $10.20 in February 2012


Just nine months ago (February 21st), NOW sold 2.45m shares at $10.20/share to
Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm (page 70 of Nov 15th Prospectus). Greylock's
investment has appreciated from $10.20/share in February to $32/share today for an
annualized return of over 200%. Yet, between February 2012 and today, NOW's revenue
growth has declined materially. The Company was growing revenue at 21% sequentially
when the $10.20/share investment was first made. Today, NOW is only growing revenue
at 9% sequentially, based on guidance in the Q3 earnings report, yet the stock has
appreciated to over $30/share.


Sources: NOW's IPO Prospectus, Nov 15th Prospectus, Reuters, and Q3 earnings report.


This trend is not sustainable. In fact, NOW shares fell 12% after its Q3 earnings report
when it announced sequential Q3 growth slowed to 13%. Should the Company continue to
decelerate in 2013, we expect NOW's valuation to quickly revert to a valuation multiple
more in line with its peers.


Precedent Transactions Show that a Buyout is Unrealistic at this Price Level

Some investors may disregard ServiceNow's nosebleed valuation multiples, arguing that
the Company might one day be a takeover target. This thesis, while highly speculative, is
probably the result of a few widely publicized SaaS deals such as SAP's $3.5bn
acquisition of SuccessFactors, an HR management firm. Yet, SuccessFactors had LTM
revenue of $292 million in the quarter prior to its buyout (see 10-K and 10-Q here), which
infers an EV/LTM revenue multiple of 12x. This itself is extraordinarily rich acquisition
price, and numerous analysts including S&P criticized SAP for overpaying, but that
multiple is still nearly half of NOW's current 22x EV/LTM revenue valuation multiple. Prior
to the acquisition, SuccessFactors had grown revenue by 55% over the last twelve
months. Since the multiple paid should be related to growth, let's apply this relationship to
NOW's growth to compute a theoretical buyout price. In the chart below, we provide
valuation multiples of selected precedent transactions in the SaaS space. Other deals
used in our analysis include Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) $1.9bn acquisition of Taleo, IBM's
$440m acquisition of DemandTec, and Oracle's $1.6bn acquisition of RightNow.


Sources: 10-K/10-Q filings (Taleo, DemandTec, SuccessFactors, RightNow) and
Bloomberg consensus estimates.


In the final column above, we've compared LTM revenue multiples vs. growth rates over
the same period. Using the average of the two highest-growth deals (these are most
comparable to NOW's growth), the figure of 4.98x tells us that for every 5% of growth, a
SaaS buyout can be awarded one turn of revenue. Using this logic, then a growth rate of
30% would be worth a 6x LTM revenue multiple, 40% would translate to 8x, and so on.


We can use the 5% rule-of-thumb to approximate ServiceNow's 'M&A' value under various
growth scenarios. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has guided to a revenue
range of $69 - $71m. If we use the mid-point of that range ($70m), ServiceNow will grow
by about 8.8% QoQ or 45% on an annualized basis. If we charitably assume that NOW
beats this guidance and grows at 50% through 2013, this translates to an LTM revenue
multiple of 10x. As shown below, this equates to a NOW 'M&A' price of only $17.50/share.

In our opinion, the M&A upside scenario does not exist for ServiceNow at its current price
level.


As a final point, we do not believe that ServiceNow is an attractive acquisition target at its
current share price due to the limited market size of the ITSM sector. Whereas
SuccessFactors, Taleo and RightNow addressed large market opportunities, NOW's end
market is more restricted in comparison.


NOW Insiders Sold Shares Ahead of Original Lock-up Expiration


Beyond our very genuine valuation concerns, we think that the hasty sale of 14.2m shares
by insiders ahead of an originally disclosed lock-up date betrays a lack of confidence in
the stock. According to ServiceNow's IPO prospectus, the vast majority of its shareholders
were originally subject to a 180-day lock-up. As a group, these holders represented 106.2
million common shares, or roughly 87% of the outstanding common stock as of the IPO. A
remaining 2.5m shares were subject to a lock-up until February 21, 2013. But just as
investors were leaving their desks for the weekend on November 9th, ServiceNow filed an
amended S-1 to push forward their first share sale by over a month.

This sudden modification of the lock-up structure does not inspire investor confidence.
Investors should ask themselves: why were insiders so eager to sell $400 million of NOW
shares that they could not wait another month for their lockup to expire. After all, JMI first
invested in ServiceNow in 2005 - after 7 years of backing NOW, what's the big deal about
waiting another 40 days? Our interpretation is that JMI and other insiders know full well
that NOW is wildly overvalued and its shares are unlikely to remain at current prices much
longer. As such, we believe these insiders were so eager to cash out that they could not
even wait until December 26th to sell down their stakes.


NOW Continues to Dilute its Existing Shareholders


While the secondary offering that closed on November 20th was predominantly used as a
conduit to allow insiders to sell their shares before the lockup expiration, the equity
offering also raised new capital for ServiceNow. Specifically, NOW sold 1.9m newly issued
stock at $28/share, or more precisely, $26.88 after the underwriting discount, which
equates to about $49.9m in proceeds (pg 30 of Nov 15th prospectus).


We believe that this freshly dilutive equity issuance is yet more evidence that ServiceNow
is highly overvalued. ServiceNow hardly needs the newly raised capital. As of its Q3
quarter-end, the Company had $256.5m of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.
Over the last nine months, the Company's cash flow from operations minus capital
expenditures has been roughly breakeven (10-Q Q3 2012). Given the large cash balance
and the fact that NOW is not burning cash at a material level, it seems that the cash was
not raised for any near-term business purpose. Rather, we believe that management
viewed NOW's stock as overvalued and wished to raise capital at an inflated valuation
before the share price declined to a more realistic level. The offering suggests that
management believes that NOW stock is rich even at $26.88.


A Final Way to Examine Valuation


When we compare NOW's valuation multiple to other disruptive SaaS providers, many of
which we believe are highly overvalued themselves, it sticks out as an outlier. For
instance, NOW's CY12E and CY13E revenue multiples are double those of RP, ET or
CRM.


Yet, long holders may argue that NOW has brighter growth prospects, so as a final
analysis, let's examine NOW's expected growth from now to 2015, and consider the
company's valuation multiple based on those 2015 figures.

Analysts currently estimate 2014E and 2015E revenue for NOW to be $525m and $662m.
We find this hard to believe given the recent revenue growth deceleration trends. In Q4
2012, the company forecasts sequential revenue growth to be 9%. If we assume 9%
sequential revenue growth in 2013, 7.5% sequential growth in 2014 and 6% sequential
growth in 2015, which equate to 47%, 36% and 29% overall annual sales growth rates in
2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, we only get to $615m of 2015 revenue, not $660m.


Of course, this assumes that NOW executes on its growth targets. We believe this is a tall
order, given the material revenue growth deceleration experienced in the past few
quarters. Given its limited market opportunity, the high switching costs between product
offerings, and the regular entry of competing products, we believe that ServiceNow's 7% -
10% sequential quarterly growth is unsustainable. Also, as we discussed in our previous
report, we believe that NOW's addressable IT Help Desk market is only $1.5bn - $2bn.
Going further, Gartner predicts that only 50% of IT companies will move to a SaaS model
by 2015. This cuts NOW's addressable market in half. Should we accept the consensus
scenario that NOW captures over half of this $1bn addressable SaaS IT Help Desk market
in just two years, we believe that at that point, NOW would have significantly limited
additional growth opportunities.


Yet even if NOW does achieve analyst targets, the stock still trades at 7.5x 2015E
revenue. In comparison, salesforce.com is projected to grow 34% in the twelve months
ending January 31, 2013, and yet it only trades at 7.5x revenue today. So if we assume
NOW should trade at 7.5x revenue in 2015, which equates to the current ~$32 stock price,
and discount that back by a 15% discount rate to today, we get to a stock price of only
$21.


Conclusion


No matter how much one believes in ServiceNow's product and management's ability to
execute, the stock itself appears highly overvalued by almost any metric. Revenue growth
has slowed sequentially in each of the first three quarters in 2012, yet NOW's stock price
has risen from $10.20 in February (Greylock transaction) to $32.63 today. This inversely
proportionate relationship between growth and value is simply unsustainable. Once
investors come to terms with NOW's limited growth prospects, NOW shares could quickly
fall from their stratospheric 20x 2012E revenue multiple to one more in-line with their ITSM
and SaaS peers. Investors seeking a buyout similar to SuccessFactors or Taleo will also
most likely be disappointed. The revenue multiples of these deals suggest that NOW
would be lucky to earn a 10x LTM revenue price, implying a ~50% drop from the current
share price.
