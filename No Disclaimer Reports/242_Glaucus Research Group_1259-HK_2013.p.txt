this report.  


PRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED (“Prince Frog” or the “Company”) is 
a People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) based producer of childcare products that raised RMB
536mm in a 2011 Hong Kong IPO. In this report, we present Nielsen retail sales data, a PRC 
government survey on consumer brand awareness, public tax records, and SAIC filings that, in our 
opinion, all independently indicate that Prince Frog’s actual sales are less than 25% of the figures
reported in the Company’s public filings.  We expect trading in the Company’s shares to be halted 
and its equity to be worth between HKD 0.74 to HKD 0.98 per share.      


1. Nielsen Data Indicates Sales are less than 25% of Reported Figures.  According to Prince 
Frog investor relations, the Company’s sales in its most important product category, 
children’s moisturizing lotions (ages 4-12), were RMB 723mm (46% of total revenues) in 
2012.  After a distributor markup, implied 2012 retail sales in the category must be at least 
RMB 1.205 billion for Prince Frog’s reported figures to be true. But according to 
independent data available from Nielsen (http://www.nielsen.com/), the total retail sales of 
Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing lotion products in 2012 were only RMB 135mm.


a. Euromonitor Sourcing Data About Prince Frog from … Prince Frog: The Company
claims that market share data provided by Euromonitor independently validates the 
Company’s reported sales.  Not so.  Whereas Nielsen relies on electronic point-of-sale 
data from retailers to estimate sales, Euromonitor relies on sales data provided by 
Prince Frog.


b. Previous Euromonitor Report Indicates that Prince Frog Sales are Less than 25% of 
Reported Figures. A 2012 Euromonitor report on baby and child specific products, 
excerpts of which are available online, not only directly contradicts the latest 
Euromonitor sales data for Prince Frog but also suggests that Prince Frog’s sales are less 
than 25% of the reported figures.     


2. PRC Government Survey: Prince Frog Not Even Top 8 in Brand Awareness.  Prince 
Frog claims to be the #1 brand in children’s lotions and the #2 brand in children’s bath and 
shampoo products.  However, when the Chinese government surveyed a random sampling of 
13,500 Chinese consumers across 30 cities for the 2013 China Brand Power Index, the survey
found that less than 7% of consumers sampled were aware (unprompted) of Prince Frog’s 
brand, meaning that Prince Frog did not even place in the Top 8 brands in the Baby/Child 
Bath and Moisturizing category.

3. PRC Government Tax Records Indicate Net Income a Fraction of Reported Figures.  
The Zhangzhou government publishes an annual list, available to any investor online, 
recognizing local businesses that pay over RMB 10mm in taxes.  Prince Frog, whose 
headquarters, production base and sole PRC operating subsidiary are based in Zhangzhou, 
claims to have paid over RMB 10mm in taxes every year since 2008.  Yet Prince Frog
appears on the government’s list only once (in 2012) and is conspicuously absent every year 
from 2008 through 2011, suggesting that it has paid far less in taxes than it claims in its public 
filings. 


4. Customer SAIC Filings Indicate Sales are less than 25% of Reported. According to 
Prince Frog’s 2012 annual report, its top five customers accounted for 14.2% of sales, or 
RMB 223mm (an average purchase amount of RMB 45mm per customer).  Even if we make 
the generous assumption that Prince Frog accounted for 75% of all products purchased by 
such customers, the SAIC filings for four of these top five customers (including the largest 
customer) indicate an average 2012 purchasing activity from Prince Frog of RMB 11mm, 
which would amount to only 24% of the purchases implied by the Company’s reported 
financials.


5. Reported Financials Covered in Warts.  Other clues that Prince Frog is more frog than 
prince are suspicious statistical outliers in the Company’s reported financials.  


a. Reported Sales Grew Seven Times Faster Than Industry.  Prince Frog’s reported 
sales grew ~700% from 2007 to 2012, a period where the industry reportedly grew only 
~100%.  Such financial performance appears to be, in our view, too good to be true. 


b. 89% ROIC Simply Lacks Credibility.  Prince Frog reported an average 89% internal 
ROIC from 2008 to 2012.  This is simply not credible when compared with the ROICs of 
its domestic and international peers, such as 39% for Shanghai Jiahua (SH: 600315), 16% 
for Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and 22% for Pigeon Corp (Tokyo: 7956).


c. Inventory Turnover Rate Suspiciously Fast.  Prince Frog reported inventory turns of 
25 days in 2012, which was at least twice as fast as the inventory turn rate of its peers (70 
days for Shanghai Jiahua, 61 days for Procter & Gamble, and 67 days for Pigeon Corp).  
Either Prince Frog, a much smaller company by comparison, has achieved a level of 
operational efficiency far in excess of these global leaders, or Prince Frog’s actual sales 
and cost of goods are significantly less than reported.  We think the answer is obvious.  


6. Valuation. In December 2012, Johnson & Johnson acquired 100% of Elsker, a close
competitor of Prince Frog, for RMB 650mm, or 1.3x trailing 12 months sales of around RMB 
500 million.  Based on the evidence presented in this report, we believe that Prince Frog’s 
true total sales figure is no higher than RMB 393mm for 2012 (25% of reported).  A 1.5x 
multiple on what we estimate to be the Company’s true sales figure would imply a valuation 
of HKD 749 million, or HKD 0.74 per share.


The preponderance of the evidence, in our opinion, indicates that Prince Frog fabricated the 
vast majority of its sales; therefore we strongly doubt the existence of its HKD 0.97 per share 
cash balance.  However, if we made the generous assumption that shareholders could recover
25% of Prince Frog’s reported onshore cash, our valuation would increase from HKD 0.74 to 
HKD 0.98 per share.

ONCE UPON A TIME


PRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD (“Prince Frog” or the “Company”) (HK: 1259) is 
a PRC-based producer of childcare products (e.g., moisturizing lotion, shampoo, and toothpaste) that 
raised RMB 536mm in a July 2011 Hong Kong IPO.1  Prince Frog’s brand is built around an animated 
series based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the princess and the frog, in which a spoiled princess 
makes a Faustian bargain with an ugly frog only to find that, upon kissing the animal, the frog has 
metamorphosed into a handsome prince.  


The irony of a company based on a fairy tale accused of significantly exaggerating its sales figures should 
not be lost on investors.  In May 2013, a Chinese blogger publicly questioned the veracity of Prince 
Frog’s reported sales and concluded that Prince Frog was not, contrary to the Company’s claims in its 
IPO Prospectus, the #2 brand in children’s lotions and body wash behind Johnson & Johnson.  The 
market seemed to credit the upstart blogger, and the Company’s stock price fell by as much as 20%, 
reflecting doubts about the authenticity of its financials.  


According to the Prince Frog fairy tale, a spoiled princess reluctantly befriends a frog that magically
transforms into a handsome prince.

www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


Prince Frog responded, pointing out that the blogger failed to distinguish between the Company’s sales in 
the children’s category (4-12 years old), supposedly its primary segment, and the baby category (0-3 
years old), which the Company claimed was less significant.  The Company also (correctly) pointed out 
that the mysterious blogger did not provide independent evidence to corroborate his investment thesis. 
The controversy intrigued us, so we decided to investigate the blogger’s thesis and evaluate the 
Company’s response.   


We found a frog masquerading as a prince.  


In this report, we present compelling evidence, including Nielsen retail sales data,2 a brand awareness 
survey conducted by the Chinese government, publicly available tax records, and customer SAIC filings, 
each of which, in our opinion, independently indicates that Prince Frog’s actual sales are less than 25% 
of the sales figures that the Company reported to investors and regulators in its IPO Prospectus 
and subsequent public filings.


Prince Frog will no doubt attempt to rebut our investment thesis by arguing that Euromonitor data 
independently validates the Company’s reported sales.  Investors should not be so easily fooled.  As we 
discuss in detail below, Euromonitor relies on self-reported sales data provided by Prince Frog to 
estimate Prince Frog’s sales and market share, whereas Nielsen’s figures are derived from electronic 
point-of-sale data (checkout scanners) from Chinese supermarkets, hypermarkets, and drug stores (places 
where Prince Frog claims that 90% of its products are sold).  The Nielsen data is therefore, in our view, a 
far more credible estimate of Prince Frog’s true sales figures.      


Ultimately, we believe that Prince Frog has materially overstated the scale and profitability of its business 
to investors and regulators, and, in doing so, violated Hong Kong securities laws.  Given the 
preponderance of the evidence, we value the Company’s shares at HKD 0.74 to HKD 0.98 per share.

December 31, 2012 for the China total market. (Copyright © 2013, The Nielsen Company).

NIELSEN DATA


Independent retail sales data from Nielsen, the globally recognized leader in independent market research,
indicates that Prince Frog’s actual sales in its best-selling product segment are only a fraction of the 
Company’s reported figures.


1) The Clock Strikes Midnight


At a recent conference, Prince Frog investor relations reported sales of RMB 723mm in 2012 (46% of 
total sales) for children’s moisturizing lotions (ages 4-12), which is not only Prince Frog’s largest 
category by sales, it is also its most profitable.3


Because Prince Frog sells its products to distributors at 45%-60% of the retail price,4 the retail value of 
Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing lotions must be between RMB 1,205mm and RMB 1,607mm in 
2012, for the Company’s reported financials to be true.5  


                                                  
3 Prince Frog 2012 Management Presentation. 
4 Prince Frog Investor Relations.
5 We calculate the implied retail value of Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing lotions in 2012 by dividing the Company’s 
reported sales to distributors (RMB 723mm) by the percentage of the retail value accounted for by Prince Frog after the retail 
channel markup (which Prince Frog’s investor relations representative disclosed at a recent public investor forum).  The 
calculation is: RMB 723 / 60% = RMB 1,205mm; RMB 723 / 45% = RMB 1,607mm.
7 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


Similarly, Prince Frog’s IPO Prospectus claimed that the retail value of the Company’s 2010 sales within 
China’s children’s moisturizing lotions category was RMB 527mm, compared with RMB 550mm for 
China’s leading brand, Johnson’s Baby. The following table, taken directly from the Prospectus, shows 
the Company’s claimed spot (2nd) in the competitive landscape of the children’s moisturizing lotions 
market at the time of its public offering in 2011.6


Recognizing the need for a truly independent source of retail sales data, we engaged globally recognized 
research firm Nielsen (www.nielsen.com) to provide us with the same category sales (children’s 
moisturizing lotions in China) for both Prince Frog and Johnson’s Baby in the PRC. Below is a cover 
letter from Nielsen, on the firm’s letterhead, summarizing its retail sales data:

In the following table we compare the Nielsen data of Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing lotion sales 
with the figures reported by the Company.  The discrepancy is obvious. 


Nielsen data puts the total retail value of Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing lotion products at RMB 
135mm in 2012, which is 81% less than Prince Frog’s reported sales to its distributors (RMB 
723mm) and 89% less than the minimum RMB 1,205mm in 2012 retail sales required if the 
Company’s reported financials are true.  


Likewise, Nielsen data shows RMB 80mm in total retail sales of Prince Frog’s children’s moisturizing 
lotions in 2010, which is 85% less than the total retail sales of such products reported in Prince 
Frog’s Prospectus for 2010.

2) The Accuracy of the Nielsen Data


Many factors indicate that the Nielsen data accurately captures Prince Frog’s reported sales in the 
Company’s key product category.       


a. SKU Coverage is Comprehensive


Nielsen’s data set tracks sales for 74 Prince Frog SKUs in the children’s moisturizing lotion category.  
The Company’s investor relations representative told analysts that of Prince Frog’s ~300 total SKUs, it 
has “over 70” in the children’s moisturizing lotion segment, making us confident that Nielsen is capturing 
sales data for the correct SKUs.  


b. Store Coverage is Comprehensive


Nielsen’s scanner data captures retail sales that come through electronic points-of-sale within Chinese 
mainland supermarkets, hypermarkets, international chains and drug stores, where according to Company 
investor relations, ~90% of Prince Frog’s products are sold.7 Nielsen also claims that its data tracks sales 
at traditional grocery stores, general stores and soft drink & ice cream shops where the remaining ~10% 
of Prince Frog’s childcare products are supposedly purchased.  The following slide from Nielsen’s power 
point deck explains their tracking methodology: 


Source: Nielsen.


                                                  
7 Prince Frog Investor Relations recently told investors at a public conference that in 2012, regional supermarket chains
accounted for 60-70% of the Company’s sales, and that international chains and hypermarkets in first tier cities accounted for 
24% of sales.  If true, then at most only 6-16% of sales occurred at “mom and pop” stores.
11 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


c. Geographic Coverage is Extensive


Nielsen’s geographic coverage is also extensive, covering the provinces home to 157 of the 173 
distributors (91%) listed by Prince Frog in its 2011 Prospectus.  The following graphic, pulled from 
Prince Frog’s IPO Prospectus,8 shows the location of the Company’s distributors, which are heavily 
concentrated in the central, southern and eastern provinces.

www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


Compare Prince Frog’s map of its distributors above to the following graphic, which shows Nielsen’s 
geographic coverage.


Source: Nielsen.


The comparison reveals that Nielsen’s data covers the provinces in which 91% of the distributors listed in 
Prince Frog’s Prospectus are located. Nielsen’s coverage area also includes the first, second and third tier
cities in the central and coastal provinces which, according to the Company, have accounted for the bulk 
of Prince Frog’s growth since its IPO.  Ultimately, Nielsen covers all but the most remote areas of China, 
where stores are likely to have much less meaningful sales.

www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


3) Euromonitor Data about Prince Frog Is Sourced From … Prince Frog


Prince Frog will no doubt attempt to rebut the Nielsen data by arguing that Euromonitor data 
independently validates the Company’s reported sales and market share in the children’s moisturizing 
category.  The Euromonitor reports are presented in Prince Frog’s public filings as an independent and 
authoritative endorsement of the Company’s sales figures, almost as if Euromonitor is a security blanket 
to which investors might cling if they doubted the authenticity of Prince Frog’s growth story.  


There is good reason, however, to believe that the data for Prince Frog in the Euromonitor reports is fairy 
dust.  The 2013 Euromonitor report, entitled “Baby and Child-Specific Products in China – Category 
Analysis,” can be purchased by any investor through the firm’s website (available here) (the “2013 
Euromonitor Report”).  


In the appendix of the Euromonitor report and in the ‘sources’ tab on the accompanying excel spreadsheet
(excerpted below), other than a handful of trade associations which we believe provide non-company 
specific data, the only sources listed by Euromonitor are the subject companies, including Prince 
Frog and Prince Frog affiliates Shuangfei Daily Chemicals Co Ltd and Shuangfei Daily Use Chemical 
Products Co. Ltd.

We reached out to a Euromonitor sales representative to inquire about the firm’s methodology.  The 
representative explicitly confirmed, in the email below, that Euromonitor reports such as the one included 
in Prince Frog’s Prospectus are compiled from self-reported data obtained from the subject IPO 
company.  The correspondence could not be clearer. 


In its own words, Euromonitor estimates Prince Frog’s market share by relying on sales data provided
by Prince Frog, which renders the Euromonitor data significantly less credible than retail sales data from 
Nielsen that is built from electronic point-of-sale data generated by independent third parties.

www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


Investors should also note that the bankers, including the Sole Global Coordinator (CCB International 
Capital (CCB)), the Sole Bookrunner (CCB), the Joint Sponsors and the Joint Lead Managers (CCB and 
CIMB Securities HK Ltd (CIMB)), did not independently verify the data underlying the Euromonitor 
report as part of their IPO due diligence process.


The bankers relied on Euromonitor, but Euromonitor relied on sales data provided by Prince Frog to 
estimate the Company’s sales figures and market share.  By comparison, Nielsen’s figures are derived 
from independent point-of-sale data (such as checkout scanners) from Chinese supermarkets, 
hypermarkets, and drug stores (where Prince Frog claims 90% of its products are sold).  The Nielsen data 
is therefore, in our view, a far more credible estimate of Prince Frog’s true sales figures.      


4) Previous Euromonitor Report Indicates Prince Frog Sales are Less than 25% of Reported


A previous Euromonitor report on baby and child specific products not only further undermines the 
credibility of Euromonitor’s sales data but also indicates that Prince Frog’s sales are less than 25% of its
reported figures. 


An online blog has published excerpts (available here) of a Euromonitor report on Baby and Child 
Specific Products dated May 10, 2012 (the “2012 Euromonitor Report”), almost ten months after Prince 
Frog’s IPO. It reports that in 2011, Prince Frog’s retail sales in the baby and child specific category 
(listed in the pie chart below under its pre-IPO predecessor company, Shuangfei Daily Chemical Co. Ltd.) 
were only RMB 334.9mm (a meager 6.9% market share).

Incredibly, between the post-IPO years 2012 and 2013, Euromonitor appears to have retroactively 
restated Prince Frog’s historical 2011 market share and retail sales data for the baby and children’s 
category. The following table compares the 2013 and 2012 Euromonitor Reports and highlights the key 
differences.

Not only does the total 2011 market size for the baby and child-specific products increase from RMB 4.9 
billion to RMB 7.3 billion from the 2012 to the 2013 Euromonitor Report, but also Prince Frog’s 2011 


RMB 334mm to RMB 1,077.3mm from document to document.  To be clear, such 
data was historical and should therefore have been consistent from one report to the next.  


What makes the discrepancy all the more fascinating is that Euromonitor lowered the market share for 
every other brand between the 2012 and the 2013 reports except Prince Frog, who’s market share 
increased from 6.9% to 14.7%.    


We believe that the massive discrepancy in Prince Frog’s historical sales not only further discredits the 
accuracy of Euromonitor’s sales data; it also supports our underlying investment opinion. 


According to the retail sales data from the 2012 Euromonitor Report, depending on the amount of the 
distributor markup, Prince Frog’s implied sales are between 16% and 22% of the reported figures for the 
children’s personal care segment.  We can calculate Prince Frog’s implied sales in the children’s personal 
care segment because Prince Frog’s investor relations discloses that the Company sells its products to 
distributors at 45%-60% of the retail price.  The following table sets forth our calculation:


The Euromonitor post-IPO historical data, prior to its retroactive restatement, corroborates the Nielsen 
data and is another independent data point to support our investment thesis that Prince Frog sales are less 
than 25% of reported.


5) China Reality Research Report Also Corroborates Nielsen Data


The market has recently been abuzz with talk of an August 2013 study by the bespoke research 
organization, China Reality Research (“CRR”) (a division of CLSA), which, according to certain 
investors and sell-side analysts,9 supposedly validates Prince Frog’s reported sales figures.  However, a 
closer look at the study reveals that CRR’s data suggests just the opposite conclusion.  


                                                  
9 CLSA released a note to its clients on August 24, 2013, claiming that the CRR study confirms Price Frog’s strong positioning 
in the market and concludes (as part of its ‘Buy’ recommendation) that there is “nothing wrong with this frog.”  We respectfully 
disagree.

What pundits preaching the merits of the CRR study fail to realize is that there is an enormous difference 
in sales between the #1 or #2 brand (as the Company claims to be) and the #4 brand. 





The table above is taken directly from the Company’s Prospectus and shows that the #4 brand in the 
children’s moisturizing lotions category (Pipedog) reported RMB 107mm in retail sales in 2010.  


If CRR’s survey of retailers is correct and Prince Frog is actually the #4 brand, Prince Frog would have 
retail sales for this category of roughly RMB 100 million in 2010.  Assuming an industry growth rate of 
44% between 2010 and 2012 (the growth rate projected by Euromonitor), the #4 brand in children’s 
moisturizing lotion would therefore be expected to have retail sales of approximately RMB 145mm in 
2012. 


Recall that the Nielsen data indicates that the retail sales of Prince Frog’s products in the children’s 
moisturizing lotions category were RMB 135mm in 2012, which is almost exactly what we calculated in 
the previous paragraph to be the expected sales from the #4 brand.  In other words, far from validating the 
sales figures provided by the Company, CRR’s data from retailers corroborates the accuracy of the 
Nielsen data and provides further evidence that the Company’s sales are only a fraction of their reported 
figures.

PRC GOVERNMENT SURVEY: PRINCE FROG NOT EVEN TOP 8 IN BRAND AWARENESS


In its 2013 Interim Results Management Presentation, Prince Frog claimed to be the #1 brand in the 
children’s moisturizing lotions category (with a 30% reported market share) and the #2 brand in the 
children’s bath and shampoo category (with a 17% reported market share).


However, a survey by the Chinese government measuring brand awareness among Chinese consumers 
found that less than 7% of consumers sampled were aware (unprompted) of Prince Frog’s brand, meaning 
that Prince Frog did not even place in the Top 8 brands in the Baby/Child Bath and Moisturizing 
category in any of the last three years.


The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC (“MIIT”) publishes the China Brand 
Power Index (“China Brand Power Index”) each year, which compiles the results of an extensive survey 
conducted with the help of a bevy of numerous government bodies, including the National Development 
and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Science and Technology of the 
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council Development 
Research Center.


To create the China Brand Power Index, the MIIT surveyed a random sampling of 13,500 Chinese 
residents across 30 cities. The details of the MIIT survey can be found on a government website 
(available here), a translated screenshot of which we include below: 


Source: http://www.chn-brand.org/c-bpi/cbpiInfo.aspx


In order to be listed on the China Brand Power Index, at least 7% of consumers surveyed must be aware 
of a brand ‘unaided,’ which is Madison-avenue jargon meaning that a customer must be able to name the 
brand without prompting when asked to name consumer products in a specific category.  This is 
different from ‘aided’ brand awareness, where the consumer is asked to identify the brands of which he or 
she is aware from a list provided by the surveyor.

Prince Frog does not appear on the China Brand Power Index for products in the Baby/Child 
Bathing/Moisturizing category in 2011, 2012, or 2013, suggesting that Prince Frog controls far less 
market share than it claims in its public filings.    


Below we have included translated screenshots of the China Brand Power Index, available online, for the 
last three years.  Notice that Johnson & Johnson dominates the rankings each year and that the China 
Brand Power Index includes many of Prince Frog’s competitors (e.g., Pigeon, Yumeijing and Haiermian) 
who are supposedly far behind Prince Frog in sales.

As expected, Johnson & Johnson ranked first in the China Brand Power Index every year.  In 2013, an 
impressive 92% of consumers surveyed named Johnson & Johnson unaided.
23


www.glaucusresearch.comPRINCE FROG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED|HK: 1259|


By contrast, Prince Frog claims be the #1 or #2 brand in the children’s moisturizing and bath product 
categories.  Yet it did not even qualify for the China Brand Power Index in any of 2011, 2012 or 2013, 
despite the fact that many of its competitors (who supposedly sell far less than Prince Frog) made the list.  


We have confirmed that Prince Frog was included in the survey but did not make the lists because it 
failed to meet the ‘unaided’ awareness threshold.  That is, less than 7% of the respondents surveyed could 
recall Prince Frog’s brand when asked, unprompted, to name brands within the Baby/Child 
Bathing/Moisturizing category.  


The methodology for the survey underpinning the China Brand Power Index is far sounder than the CRR 
survey.  To create the China Brand Power Index, the MIIT surveyed 13,500 randomly selected Chinese 
residents across 30 cities.  By comparison, the CRR report relied on conversations with only 242 
parents in the PRC for its conclusion that Prince Frog ranked second behind Johnson & Johnson in brand 
awareness. 


More importantly, the China Brand Power Index measures ‘unaided’ brand awareness, meaning that 
government surveyors asked Chinese consumers to recall brands without any prompting and without 
giving the consumer a list of brands.  By contrast, the CRR survey appears to have measured ‘aided’ 
brand awareness, meaning that CRR surveyors prompted consumers with a list of brands that included 
Prince Frog or simply asked a consumer if he or she was aware of Prince Frog.  Obviously, ‘unaided’ 
brand awareness is far more coveted than ‘aided’ brand awareness and much more indicative of a 
powerful brand.


Further, the China Brand Power Index survey sampled consumers from a broad array of cities, including 
major cities in regions where Prince Frog supposedly dominates:

The China Brand Power Index, a government sponsored survey, discredits the results of the CRR brand 
awareness study and indicates that Prince Frog controls far less market share than the Company claims.

TAX RECORDS


Publicly available tax records, published on a government website, the website of a local business 
association and in the local newspapers, also suggest that the Company is paying far less tax than it 
claims in its public filings.  According to the Company’s IPO Prospectus, Prince Frog’s headquarters, 
production facilities, and only PRC subsidiary are located in the city of Zhangzhou, Fujian Province: 10

10 In 2008 and 2009, the Company recorded sales through affiliate Fujian Shuangfei, which also does not appear on the 
government’s list of taxpayers in such years despite purportedly paying RMB 27.7mm and 30.4mm in 2008 and 2009, 
respectively.

Since 2008, the Zhangzhou government (www.zhangzhou.gov.cn) has recognized the top tax paying 
companies in its city by including their names on a list, published on the government website and on the 
website of the Zhangzhou Enterprise Association.  For example, the following announcement, available 
on the government’s website, recognizes the 143 Zhangzhou businesses that paid over RMB 10mm in 
PRC taxes in 2010.

The Zhangzhou government lists break out the top tax paying businesses for each calendar year into the 
following tiers: companies which paid over RMB 100mm in tax (Tier 1), companies which paid between 
RMB 50mm and 100mm in tax (Tier 2) and companies that paid between RMB 10mm and 50mm in tax 
in any given year (Tier 3).  If Prince Frog’s reported financials are true, the Company should be on the 
Tier 3 list (i.e., a business that paid at least RMB 10mm in tax) in every year since 2008: 


Yet Prince Frog does not appear on any of the Zhangzhou government’s taxpayer lists from 2008 through
2011, and only appears on the Tier 3 list in 2012.  For convenience, the following table provides a 
hyperlink to the list of major taxpayers (sorted by tier) for each year from 2008 through 2012. 


The government’s annual lists of the top local taxpaying businesses are hardly obscure.  Every year, the 
local newspaper, the Minnan Daily, publishes the list in print and on its website to honor the top 
Zhangzhou businesses, making Prince Frog’s absence even more conspicuous:

Interestingly, Prince Frog appears in Tier 3 in the 2012 list.  This does not mean that the Company paid 
its reported RMB 48mm in taxes in 2012, just that it paid more than RMB 10mm.  However, its 
appearance in 2012 does suggest that if the Company were paying as much in taxes as it claims in its 
public financials, it would have made the Tier 3 list every year since 2008.  It did not. 


Prince Frog’s conspicuous absence from the list of Tier 3 taxpayers in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 
indicate that, contrary to the statements of cash flows in its Prospectus and subsequent annual reports, the 
Company did not pay over RMB 10mm in PRC taxes in any of those years. 


Furthermore, the publicly available taxpayer lists from the Zhangzhou government corroborate the 
Nielsen data and provides further evidence that the Company is vastly exaggerating its reported sales and 
profitability.

CUSTOMER SAIC FILINGS


Prince Frog sells its products to distributors in the PRC. According to Prince Frog’s 2012 annual report, 
its top five customers accounted for 14.2% of sales (RMB 223mm).  This breaks down to a required 
average purchase amount from each of its top five customers of RMB 45mm in 2012.  Prince Frog does 
not disclose the exact amount of sales to its customers, but Prince Frog investor relations disclosed the 
identity of the Company’s top five customers at a recent investor conference.  


We reviewed the publicly available SAIC filings for four out of five of the Company’s top customers, 
including Prince Frog’s top customer, Chengdu Shuxiu Trading Company Limited (“Chengdu Shuxiu”).  
These SAIC filings contained financial statements from which we calculated the level of purchasing 
activity for each such customer (measured by COGS plus the change in inventory).11


Because Chengdu Shuxiu is Prince Frog’s top customer, its total purchases should at the very least be 
greater than RMB 45mm, which is the average amount sold to each of Company’s top five customers in 
2012.  


However, financials from Chengdu Shuxiu’s SAIC filings, excerpts of which are available in Appendix I, 
show that in each of the past three years, the Company’s top customer has purchased less than the 
required average.

Chengdu Shuxiu’s SAIC filings show that, even making the generous (and probably erroneous) 
assumption that 75% of the distributor’s purchases are from Prince Frog, its purchasing activity in each of 
the last three years was ~60% of the required amount for an average top 5 customer. 


The SAIC filings for three more of the Company’s top five customers12 (excerpts available in Appendix I)
further support our investment thesis. Even if we project that sales increased by 50% in 2012 for both 
customers for which only FY 2011 SAIC filings were available (Nanchang Honglilai and Xinjiang 
Jundali), the average purchasing activity from four of Prince Frog’s top five customers in 2012 was 
only a fraction of the annual purchases required for the Company’s financials to be true.  


Assuming that Prince Frog accounts for 75% of its customers’ purchases, which seems a generous 
assumption, then the Company’s sales to four of its top five customers appear to be only 24% of the 
amount required for Prince Frog’s reported financials to be accurate.  


More significantly, customer SAIC filings corroborate the taxpayer lists and the Nielsen data, with each 
piece of evidence independently suggesting that Prince Frog’s actual sales are less than 25% of the 
reported figures.  


                                                  
12 Prince Frog investor relations stated that there is very little change in its top customers from year to year, so we believe we are 
safe in assuming that since both Nanchang Honglilai and Xinjiang Jundali were top five customers in 2012, they are were also 
top five customers in 2011.

REPORTED FINANCIALS COVERED IN WARTS


There are also a host of other clues in the Company’s reported financials suggesting that Prince Frog is 
more frog than prince. 


1) Reported Sales Grew Seven Times Faster than Industry


Prince Frog’s reported sales growth is so meteoric that it defies credibility. In the following graph, we 
compare Prince Frog’s reported sales with the industry growth rate and our estimate, based on Nielsen 
data, tax records and customer SAIC filings, of Prince Frog’s actual sales from 2007 to 2012. 


The comparison reveals that Prince Frog’s sales purportedly grew ~700% during a period where the 
industry, according to Euromonitor, grew at a rate of only ~100%. Significantly, our estimate of the 
Company’s sales growth rate over the same period closely matches the ~100% industry growth rate.  In 
our opinion, Prince Frog’s reported rate of sales growth deviates so significantly from the industry growth 
rate that the Company’s performance appears too good to be true.

2) 89% ROIC LACKS CREDIBILITY


Second, Prince Frog reported an average 89% internal ROIC between 2008 and 2012.  Although this red 
flag was mentioned by the Chinese blogger who (without much evidentiary support) questioned the 
veracity of Prince Frog’s reported figures, we believe it bears mentioning again because this princely rate 
of return is simply not credible compared with Prince Frog’s domestic and international peers, such as 
Shanghai Jiahua (SH: 600315), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Pigeon Corp (Tokyo: 7956), which 
boasted an average ROIC of around 26% during the same period.


   Source: Company filings.


If the Company’s ROIC figures are to be believed, Prince Frog has so revolutionized the consumer 
products industry that it should be the subject of Harvard Business School case studies for decades to 
come, and business gurus from around the world will descend on Fujian to learn the frog’s secrets.

3) Suspiciously Fast Inventory Turnover Rate


Prince Frog reported inventory turns of 25.3 days in 2012,13 which was more than twice as fast as the 
inventory turn rate of its peers (e.g. 70 days for Shanghai Jiahua, 61 days for Procter & Gamble, and 68 
days for Pigeon Corp). 


Such a fast rate is another significant red flag. It simply does not sound credible to us that Prince Frog
could turn its inventory every 3.5 weeks. Either Prince Frog, a much smaller company by comparison, 
has achieved a level of operational efficiency far in excess of these global leaders, or Prince Frog’s actual 
sales and cost of goods are significantly less than reported.  Based on the preponderance of the evidence
presented herein, we think such purported operational efficiency is a mere fable.

VALUATION


We believe, based on the evidence presented in this report, that Prince Frog’s sales are less than 25% of 
the reported figure.  Assuming a good portion of those fabricated sales, when restated, fall directly to the 
bottom line, Prince Frog could be hard pressed to turn a profit. However, with no visibility on the 
Company’s true net income, we cannot say that Prince Frog’s equity is worthless nor can we offer any 
opinion on the value of the Company’s shares as a multiple of earnings.  


A proper dissection reveals a frog, not a prince


That said, in December 2012, Johnson & Johnson acquired 100% of Elsker, a close competitor of Prince 
Frog, for RMB 650mm, or 1.3x trailing 12 months sales of around RMB 500 million.  Based on the 
evidence presented in this report, we believe that Prince Frog’s actual total sales figure is no higher than
RMB 393mm for 2012, or 25% of the reported figure.  A 1.5x multiple on what we estimate to be the 
Company’s true sales figure would imply a valuation of HKD 749 million, or HKD 0.74 per share.


For investors who bought Prince Frog’s fairy tale growth story, we fear that there will be no happy 
ending.  We believe that the yield would be minimal from any attempted recovery of PRC onshore cash 
from Prince Frog’s balance sheet because creditors would have to prevail against entrenched and 
connected insiders by litigating in China’s byzantine and arbitrary judicial system.  According to the 
Company’s 2012 annual report, Prince Frog has already spent 93% of its IPO proceeds on marketing, 
capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes.  


The preponderance of the evidence indicates that, in our opinion, Prince Frog has fabricated the vast 
majority of its sales; therefore we strongly doubt the existence of its HKD 0.97 per share cash balance.  


valuation would increase from HKD 0.74 to HKD 0.98 per share.
