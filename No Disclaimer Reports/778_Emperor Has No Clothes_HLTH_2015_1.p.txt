Nobilis: About To Fall From Nobility, Part I, 65%+ Downside
Oct. 9, 2015 10:00 AM ET153 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


Surgical center roll up with a management team having experience with prior roll ups
losing 90%+ of shareholder value; defunct roll up and Nobilis have the same
chairman, 3 CFOs,


Insiders have cashed out more than $50 million in the year-to-date period (~9% of
current market cap).


Accounting red flags: 4 CFO changes in a handful of years, along with recent auditor
resignations; potentially overstated revenues; newly acquired acquisitions with
Accounts Receivable issues.


Questionable marketing, with paid studies touting inappropriate success rates for its
medical procedures.


The company is significantly overvalued, and appears to be guiding for unachievable
targets; 65%+ downside in current stock price.


Nobilis | A Brief Overview


Nobilis (HLTH, TSX:NHC) (formerly known as Northstar Healthcare) is a roll up of
ambulatory surgical centers and medical services companies. The company owns surgery
centers in Texas and Arizona, and provides marketing and management services for its
own as well as third-party facilities. Nobilis has acquired various surgery centers, where it
uses its marketing engine to refer procedures to doctors who perform surgeries at these
facilities. The plan is for this marketing engine to drive growth at owned and acquired
facilities. One of Nobilis' key acquisitions included the rights to AccuraScope, which is a
spine surgery that offers patients a very short recovery time versus traditional procedures.


"The Emperor Has No Clothes" has a solid track record, and Nobilis' stock is likely
to drop in a similar style

Fear the Roll Up | Roll Ups Rarely End Well, and Nobilis' Version is a Disaster
Waiting to Happen


Roll ups have a recurring pattern of being bad stock market investments. The strategy
sounds appealing to investors as an acquiring entity goes out picking up businesses and
putting them together with the promise of significant synergies and cost reductions.
Investment banks and their analysts love roll ups as well, as the constant stream of
acquisitions provide continuing opportunities for transaction advisory and financings
related to paying for them, both of which all add up to rich fees.


For investors, roll ups are not nearly as attractive. Acquisitions give the impression of
growth, even if the actual businesses are not growing, or even in decline. Management
can continue to pay themselves handsome wages as top line expansion continues to
reinforce the market excitement about the company's underlying "growth" story. Even the
traditional earnings measures of the most conservative value investors can be distorted by
all the opportunities in merger accounting to shift expenses and pad post-acquisition
results. Synergy realizations are rare, and are more often than not unlikely to be realized.


A Team with Well-Catalogued Experiences of Failure


Management teams of public companies often give comfort to investors in their stocks by
listing a history of successes at prior companies and with experience in the underlying
industry. As a result, stockholders can hang their hats on the likelihood of success based
on management's skills and history of success. Nobilis' management does not follow this
pattern, as it has no successes, as far as I can see, that resulted in any creation of
shareholder value.


One would expect to see a recurring pattern in the backgrounds of a management team
for a medical company to have lots of like experiences in the medical industry. But Nobilis
has a different pattern. Instead, we see a common background in a company called Acro
Energy Technologies.

Acro was not a successful medical company that trained future leaders of the industry.
Instead, it was a failed company in the solar industry. But while it was not in the actual
business of medicine, it was a roll up. And a great example of why roll ups are such a
dangerous animal for investors.


Current Nobilis chairman of the Board, Harry Fleming, was Acro Energy's founder and
chairman. He tells us all about his plan for Acro in a July 2009 interview. Harry explained
that "a couple of years ago, we formed a shell, and we took it public on the Toronto stock
exchange. The reason we did this, we wanted a vehicle to roll in other integrators
throughout the country."


After noting that he didn't really have any background in the solar industry, he confidently
stated: "we saw an opportunity. We think it's really going to take off even more than it has
the last two years. And the market's really being driven by the Chinese panel
manufacturers that are day-to-day driving down prices, which really is going to make this a
mainstream product starting in the year 2010".


He further exclaimed: "and we can really take advantage of what we see is going to be a
just tidal wave of business as we hit the year 2010. So we want to get as big a footprint as
we can to really take advantage of the huge increase in business that we're seeing".


The tidal wave did not work out like Harry expected, as we see that in February 2013,
Acro Energy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. And investors were not the only ones who
suffered in this roll up. A poster claiming to be a former Acro Energy employee responded
to Harry's 2009 interview by saying: "Harry Fleming is a disgrace to the state of Texas…If
you are contemplating doing any business with Harry Fleming, my only words are... don't
do it" (Source: The BusinessMakers).

In the case of Nobilis , the company has guided to having picked up undervalued and
bankrupt assets. But with this management team and these assets, this story is likely to
end very badly. However, the reality is that these assets were undervalued and bankrupt
for a reason. If the underlying acquisitions are garbage, accumulating various acquisitions
just yields a larger pile of garbage (Source: Bloomberg).


Out of the above noted acquisitions, Athas is the largest, and will be well documented
throughout the rest of this report. The Victory Plano & Healthcare acquisitions come from
a bankruptcy on the back of inability to collect accounts receivable, and Nobilis seems just
as unlikely to change this reality. The third largest acquisition, First Nobilis, was formerly
public and fell over 80% due to lawsuits against the company.


Nobilis (NHC, HLTH) is the Same Story as Acro Energy, and is Likely to Follow in the
Same Failed Footsteps


We have already seen the striking overlap of management between Nobilis and Acro. But
the similarities go even further. Just like Acro, Nobilis is based in Houston, Texas. And just
like Acro, it listed on the Canadian exchange, despite having no business operations in
Canada. And just like Acro, Nobilis chose Calvettii Ferguson & Wagner, a small
accounting firm with limited public company experience, to be its auditor. But the one
minor difference is that unlike Acro, Nobilis jumped on the scene with a bang.


In May 2007, Nobilis (named Northstar Healthcare at that time) went public with a ~$150
million IPO. Just like Acro Energy, Nobilis was planned to be a roll up, although this time it
chose ambulatory surgical centers as the place to find a new "tidal wave of business".
Donald Kramer started out as the CEO of Northstar, and showed every bit as much talent
as Harry Fleming. With fresh investor money burning a hole in his pocket, Kramer quickly
purchased 55% interest in the Palladium for Surgery and 60% in Medical Ambulatory
Surgical Suites. It is pretty interesting to note that Palladium was an asset that was

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 5/68


already partially owned by Kramer, so he basically paid both himself and his partners a
significant sum of money using shareholder cash (there has got to be some kind of related
party issue here, but we will get to that in a moment). But just as fast as they were
purchased, Northstar's two acquired assets were performing poorly, and the stock price
followed suit. Inside a year and a half, Northstar wrote off $131 million of the acquired
assets (through a hit to goodwill and intangibles).


This was followed by Kramer being kicked to the curb from his CEO position. He was also
concurrently served with a lawsuit by Northstar. Presumably afraid of the suit, Kramer
participated in an emergency financing by Northstar (easy, as it had no other shareholder
demand for its shares) and regained control of Northstar. And, of course, he immediately
squashed the lawsuit against himself and sold the remaining portion of Palladium into
Northstar, which shortly thereafter went bankrupt (Source: TheStreet). Suffice to say that
Kramer proved very adept at making money for himself, even if his shareholders did not
fare as well. In the end, Northstar's share value fell over 90% the first time Kramer was at
the helm (the stock price achieved highs of $19.26, before trading below $1; Source:
Bloomberg).


Unlike Acro, Northstar had enough money to stay alive (barely), but due to declining sales,
the stock languished below $1 for five years, and management was in need of a miracle.
Fortunately, they found someone in the miracle business.


Selling Miracles | Enter Lawrence Rothstein and Athas

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 6/68


Our story now turns to anesthesiologist Lawrence Rothstein. In 2001, he lost his medical
license for the first (but not the last) time: "Rothstein's medical license had been
suspended by the state of Ohio in 2001, medical board records stated, after his arrest for
possession of cocaine. It was reinstated after he underwent rehab and attended AA
meetings". (Source: The Dallas Morning News)


Despite his obvious affinity for the pharmaceutical side of medicine, Rothstein proved to
be amazingly energetic, and decided to pursue advances in surgery. Although not actually
a surgeon, he developed a minimally invasive spine surgery, which was ultimately
trademarked as AccuraScope. This procedure offered patients a treatment that seemed
miraculous. The procedure involved entry through the base of the spine with an
endoscope, followed by moving up the spinal canal to work on disks and burn off nerves
with a tiny laser; it did not cut through muscle or bones like traditional back surgery, and
thus, had greatly reduced recovery time. Further, since it involved using a laser, it naturally
sounded advanced. These features resonated as a very marketable product. The allure of
the outpatient procedure made it quite marketable and was soon discovered by someone
else in the miracle business, Joe Sam Bailey.


Joe Sam Bailey was a Baptist preacher who claimed to have a Ph.D. in theology (but from
an unaccredited university). Joe heard about Rothstein's miracle procedure and went to
visit and observe the magic. He quickly understood the marketing potential of the
procedure and phoned business partner Chris Lloyd to tell him the good news. Bailey,
Lloyd and Rothstein soon formed a company called North American Spine.


North American Spine performed no surgeries, but took a cut for focusing on the
marketing of the surgery. The company marketed this using online ads and celebrity
endorsements. It also used seminars, led by Joe Sam Bailey, to convince patients that this
miracle surgery would cure their chronic back pain quickly and with very little pain or
recovery time. Once potential patients were hooked, North American Spine would refer
them to anesthesiologists and "pain management specialists" to perform the surgery.
While the sales pitch of cured chronic back pain was easy, the reality could be very
different.


Normally, spinal surgery is performed by orthopedic surgeons who specialize in the
musculoskeletal system, or by neurosurgeons who specialize in the nervous system. Both
of these specialties require years of training and experience with the components that
make up the very complicated and highly vulnerable spine. Yet, other doctors, such as
anesthesiologists, have pursued this area of practice and have capitalized on the promise

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 7/68


of a simple-sounding surgery to relieve pain. From the early stages of the emergence of
these procedures, prestigious institutions, such as the Mayo Clinic, have warned of the
risks involved: "At Mayo Clinic, we don't use or recommend laser spine surgery".


Other sources describes issues with the procedure as follows: "Complications stemming
from the Accurascope DND include but are not limited to permanent nerve damage, pain,
weakness, numbness, paralysis, and incontinence". Whilst using this surgery, Rothstein
accumulated over 40 malpractice lawsuits against him. He settled lawsuits at $5 million
and $1.4 million where "judgment [was served] after a jury found he performed a surgical
procedure that permanently maimed a patient". The $5 million judgement was settlement
where the patient suffered brain damage.


After settling a few lawsuits, Rothstein inevitably disappeared, but not before filing for
bankruptcy to avoid having to deal with his remaining malpractice suits. He also lost his
medical license for a second time, and this time for good, on April 9, 2013 (Source: State
Medical Board of Ohio). The document justifies revoking his license, because "from in or
about 2002 to in or about April 2009, you undertook the care of Patients…you
inappropriately utilized laser endoscopic technique, performed procedures that were not
medically indicated and/or were clinically contraindicated, and/or failed to provide
appropriate follow-up care".


The Big Sale | Athas Sold for 26x its Prior Price


Despite the fall of AccuraScope's developer and founder, North American Spine's two
other founders were undeterred. Though their entity, Athas, had purchased North
American Spine's facility for a measly $1.3 million, they were able to sell Athas to
Nobilis for $34 million less than 24 months later. North American Spine has
relationships with physicians and facilities, and refers patients through its marketing
channel to both physicians and facilities. No sale of a questionable spinal procedure to a
patient who does not need it could ever be as impressive as the sale of Athas for 26x the
price it was valued at less than 24 months earlier (note that there appears to be no major
change in financials or operations over this time). Nobilis shareholders may have been
deceived (or maybe just desperate) in this transaction, but the dynamic marketing duo of
Lloyd and Bailey were able to pull off another miracle, but as you would expect, only for
their benefit.


And despite the departure of Rothstein, problems with AccuraScope continue to be
reported. In a September 11, 2015 article, we learn about a family that is suing North
American Spine for their father's death as a result of a surgery at its facility, where spinal

fluid leaked through his body to his brain. Here is a key expose which illustrates just how
bad North American Spine is. In summary, it appears that North American Spine might be
overcharging for its surgeries, and the article further demonstrates that patients' lives are
being ruined, but surgeries continue to be performed by anaesthesiologists (not surgeons,
which appears wrong given the experimental nature of the surgery, and its very
questionable results). The company has been sued on the basis that "There has been no
reliable testing of [the] surgery to show that it is a medically valid procedure, nor what the
associated complication rate is". Online reviews of this experimental surgery are
questionable, at best, and some describe it as terrible (Source: ComplaintsBoard). The
results of the AccuraScope surgery have not changed even with other doctors performing
the surgery.


Not only was Chris Lloyd rewarded with a very large payout from Athas (at the cost of
Nobilis shareholders), he was even given the position of CEO in the new company so he
could continue the roll up strategy created by his new friends Harry Fleming and Donald
Kramer, both of whom relinquished their positions in Nobilis as quickly as they could. Chris
has continued his marketing strategy at Nobilis, and the stock price of is thriving for now.
Despite this reprieve, the fundamental basis of the company seems very shaky, and I think
this too shall pass. The first sign of this is key insiders selling one-third of their holdings in
the year-to-date period.


The Little Sales That Are Not So Cute


At North American Spine, Joe Sam Bailey would hold seminars touting his education
(Ph.D), in addition to touting AccuraScope success rates, despite his unaccredited
education in Theology and questionable success rate data. An extract from a lawsuit
against the company illustrates that North American Spine exaggerated success rates -
Nicholas Vanderburg (Plaintiff) vs. Defendants (Riverview Health, Lawrence Rothstein,
Steven Rothstein and Dayton Laser Spine), paragraph 40: "Thereafter, on or about June
23, 2009, Nicholas Vanderburg contacted North American Spine and received information
for his review. During his telephone conversation, Vanderburg was assured that the
procedure was safe, he would have no down time and it was about one hundred (100%)
effective".


First and foremost, per this source, the company itself appears to have stated that
success rates are difficult, as the studies are difficult: "as with other types of minimally
invasive spine surgery, no such trials have been done for the AccuraScope. 'Doctors don't
like to do them,' Wells said. 'Secondly, those are massively expensive." Now, there are
multiple holes to poke in this statement, the first of which is that if trials have not been

done, how does Nobilis continue to put out success rates? Further, if studies have not
been done, would it not be in Nobilis' interest to sponsor a study? Now, if it has not, does
that imply that the company is scared of the results or unwilling to find out?


However, Nobilis continues with the Athas style of publishing success rates. As of its April
7, 2015 press release, the company said: "Medical research has shown that the
AccuraScope procedure has an 82% success rate and saves patients an average of
$23,190 in out-of-pocket costs over 5 years by reducing expenses including medical visits
and medications." In this article written by Doug Swan, he references five studies that
North American Spine previously used as sources: one was written by Rothstein and a
related doctor, another was once again written by a doctor related to North American
Spine (Dr. Kenneth Alo), the third is of current trends in the industry, the fourth is a Korean
report which Dr. Alo was once again linked to, and the final study had nothing to do with
North American Spine-like procedures. This all begs the question of how Nobilis is still
standing by the 82% success rate noted in the April 7, 2015 press release.


Once again, Doug Swanson catches North American Spine with misleading statements,
given the company claims to have been vetted by a major university, when in fact, it was
not. See the following quotes: "Last year, North American Spine sought to have a judge
stop a Florida woman from complaining about the AccuraScope procedure on a website.
In its petition, the company said the AccuraScope is 'the only minimally invasive procedure
vetted by a major university (Louisiana State University) establishing both the procedure's
efficacy as well as its overall cost savings'... This was a reference to Erich Richter, who
formerly taught at LSU. He disputes the company's assertion. 'It is not vetted or
approved by LSU,' he said. 'There was no study by LSU.' Nor has there been a study
by West Virginia University, where Richter now teaches".


But not to worry, although Athas was acquired for its marketing prowess, it was missing an
integral piece, and that was resolved on April 29, 2015, when Nobilis entered into an
agreement with Renew Spinal Care. Renew Spinal is effectively a marketing firm and run
by Joe Sam Bailey. "Nobilis is excited to work with the innovative marketing team at
Renew. Renew currently operates in Texas and Florida as it contemplates expansion into
strategic markets nationwide,' said Chris Lloyd, CEO of Nobilis".


Who is paying for this?


For a surgery that is supposed to cost $25-30k, it is pretty unbelievable that there are
cases where it has cost $94,000 and $90,176 in certain cases, especially for an outpatient
procedure, which typically lasts 45 minutes. A Bloomberg article also highlights that a 45-

minute surgery by an anaesthesiologist cost $95k in some cases - seems a little
excessive, if you ask me. And this patient's surgery had poor results, just like the rest, as
they exclaimed "this has just devastated my life".


From what I have found, most of the big insurance companies do not cover
AccuraScope or similar minimally invasive spine surgeries. See the following quote from
the previously linked Dallas Morning News article, where neither Aetna nor Blue Cross
cover it: "Some insurance plans cover treatments such as the AccuraScope - and other
types of minimally invasive spine surgery - partially or not at all. Aetna, for example,
considers the AccuraScope-type procedure to be 'experimental and investigational'... An
Aetna policy bulletin says the effectiveness of such measures is unproven and may entail
'significant risk' of injury and infection... An Anthem Blue Cross insurance policy statement
classifies the procedures as 'not medically necessary'". I have also spoken with Humana
(NYSE:HUM) - the company indicated the surgery is experimental and not covered.


Here is a blog post from just under 2 years ago, which flags various issues:


"I had a consult with this North American Spine for what is essentially percutaneous
laser discectomy on a herniated disc. This is a 15 k procedure I found out at other
practices throughout the country. They want to bill my insurance company 35k for a
regular discectomy and also inquired about acupuncture and other non related
surgical procedures. Then they said they have $900 administrative fee if I get the
procedure. They said insurance doesn't cover this fee and its their own fee. I asked
what it was for and they only could state for administrative fee".


One part of the excitement surrounding Nobilis' stock relates to growing the mix of in-
network surgeries, but this is odd, given insurance already appears to be skeptical of the
surgery. Additionally, one of its recent acquisitions, Victory, was shut down because of
shift to in-network and the resulting inability to collect on accounts receivable that it was
owed by insurers. On June 12, 2015, the Victory CEO said, "'Unfortunately, as out-of-
network providers, we came under attack by large insurance carriers. Even though we
were able to execute in-network agreements with three large insurers, the extreme
slowness and lack of payment from the carriers constrained liquidity significantly. We have
responded by reducing expenses and changing our facilities to provide fewer services and
kept our emergency rooms open. Unfortunately, now we have no other choice except to
sell our facilities with the intent of remunerating secured and unsecured creditors alike". It
appears that Nobilis' strategy has substantial risk.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 11/68


Considering that major insurers are not insuring this procedure, yet somehow, per the
Dallas Morning News article, "Her total bill was $94,514. Harrison's share of that was
$9,500. Insurance paid some of the rest", and the July 31, 2015 review here, "You give
them your Insurance they call and say, You Qualify", it appears that the company is getting
it through insurance somehow - I just cannot see how. Perhaps the secret sauce of the
"marketing engine" is really just the ability to get normally not insurable procedures
reimbursed by insurers. And it is easy to see the results, as Nobilis' Revenue per
Procedure is dramatically higher than that of its competitors (even with a significant year
over year drop). There competitors include Amsurg Corp. (NASDAQ:AMSG), Surgical
Care Affiliates Inc. (NASDAQ:SCAI), United Surgical Partners (formerly USPI) and
Surgery Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) (Source: Company Filings).


This issue is corroborated by the Athas financial statements, which state that
"Approximately 10% of the Company's patient volume consists of cash paying ('selfpay')
patients without any reliance on third-party support." But how is it possible that insurance
is paying for this if they do not allow it? Per my review, Aetna (NYSE:AET), Anthem Blue
Cross (NYSE:ANTM) and Humana do not insure AccuraScope or similar procedures; so,
who exactly is insuring this? How is it being put through insurance? Is there risk of not
being paid by insurers?


Somebody is Definitely Getting Paid


In 2014 alone, three individuals were paid $8.4 million. When you consider this in context
of the entire Nobilis company posting a net income figure of $3.6 million, the number
becomes pretty troubling. The key takeaway is that Kramer, Lloyd and Fleming took home
2.3 times what shareholders could (they were paid $8.4 million, compared to net income
of $3.6 million). What is even more weird is that Chris Lloyd (new and current CEO) only
officially became involved with the company on December 1, 2014, when Nobilis

purchased Athas - so, if Chris was only working at the company for 30 days (of which
some would be holidays), did he really deserve total compensation of $1.9 million. Does
this imply that on a run-rate basis, Chris could have made over $20 million in 2014?
Something appears amiss?

A Big Valuation and a Big Supply of Shares to Sell


Current valuation: Even with the most bullish of expectations, Nobilis is still overvalued,
despite the retreat of its stock price in the last few months. If the company achieves the
very debatable guidance that it has laid out, it will still be valued at 12x 2015E EBITDA.
The following table illustrates how significant Nobilis' valuation is. There is no way a
glorified marketing engine deserves any of these multiples.

10-Q)


More shares for management: It is important to note that the company has a mostly
unnoticed 3.8 million shares that are virtually certain to be granted, but are currently not
included in analyst reports (most analysts have shares outstanding in the low-70 million
range), Google Finance (below 70 million shares outstanding) or Bloomberg (71 million
shares outstanding). If valuations are kept constant at $519 million market capitalization,
this would imply a stock price of 5% lower ($519 million market cap / 77M shares
outstanding). Note: 77M shares comes from 70.9M o/s from the company's latest 10-Q,
additional 3.8M aforementioned, 3.7M in-the-money options with average strike of $2.13).


Insider sales: Key insiders, including the former CEO and CFO and new CEO, have sold,
on average, 11% of their total holdings year to date.

This implies that insiders have sold over $35 million of stock this year alone (equivalent to
at least 6% of the company). Chris Lloyd and his fellow Athas founders have cashed out
an additional $15 million ($3 million on closing of the deal, and an additional $12 million of
debt that was paid back with the GE Capital financing). This implies that insiders have
sold at least $50 million this year. If Chris is really excited about being CEO of Nobilis, why
has he cashed out such significant amounts of money this year?


Peculiar last financing: On April 21, 2015, Nobilis initially announced a $40 million offering,
with $35 million in gross proceeds for the company and $5 million for insiders (Donald
Kramer, former CEO, and Harry Fleming, current chairman). However, once initial
indications confirmed the market's appetite for a Nobilis offering, the offering was
expanded to raise $70 million - now, I will be the first to agree that this is pretty normal.
However, there were multiple issues with the details of this offering for anyone who
decided to read through the minutiae. First, the entire incremental amount of capital being
raised, $30 million, was for shares being sold by insiders Donald Kramer and Harry
Fleming. In addition to this, Nobilis would attach warrants to all shares sold by Donald and
Harry, and this appears to have happened at no additional cost to them. In the end,
Donald and Harry sold 3.8 million shares for $34.3 million.


Nobilis' overly optimistic guidance: Although the company's guidance is highlighted above,
I wanted to poke some holes in its likelihood. One example of the current team's prowess
in providing financial guidance can be observed in its commentary on share-based
compensation guidance. During its Q1 2015 earnings call: "[Question] Sheila Broughton,
Analyst: Do you have any kind of guidance on looking ahead where we should think of
share-based comp on a quarterly number?... [Answer] Andy Chen, Chief Financial Officer:
No, actually right now, we basically have accruing expenses all of those share-based

compensations on the annual basis. So we don't expect to have any more increase
unless, there is other new senior staff joining us. So at this point, the current number is
pretty much steady." Q1 2015 share-based compensation was $2.8 million. Anyone who
took the effort to check if Andy Chen's guidance was correct, with share-based
compensation staying steady going forward, would have learned that the Q2 2015 share-
based comp was over 120% higher than that in Q1 2015, at $6.2 million for the quarter.


Per the Q2 2015 conference call on August 14, 2015, CEO Lloyd gives us some pretty
vague insight into how Nobilis comes up with its guidance through discussion of its
forecasted budgets, "we're dealing with millions of page views, thousands of inquiries, you
kind of get a predictability based on statistics. So you can kind of look forward and
understand what the budget will hold". Normally, if we were talking about a technology
company, I would understand utilizing page views to help drive forecasts. First off, the
company provides no details as to how page views have progressed or changed over
time. But even more important is that we are talking about medical procedures, and it is
unlikely that Nobilis is able to forecast 2016E guidance based on page views today. It is
important to note that Nobilis' guidance will get a little better with the Victory acquisitions
this year, but only from a top line perspective as we have described with roll ups. In the
end, what is important is that the company is driving profitability, and I do not think that
Nobilis will drive profitability, given the accounting issues that it has, potential
overcharging, the various lawsuits that are outstanding and all the issues in this report
(Source: Q2 2015 financials, which drive the run-rate numbers).


In addition to the above, I challenge any shareholders to call management or Investor
Relations of Nobilis to ask how they attain comfort over their guidance for 2016E. More
likely than not, you will not be able to get any rational response as to why Nobilis'
management expects such significant improvements in both revenue and EBITDA.
Instead, you are more likely to get a response like the following, which Chris said during
the companies Q4 2014 conference call: "Because we're in such a hyper growth mode,
trust me, we're scratching our head to try to give you guys the best information to
showcase how well we're doing because we are doing very well". Does this mean that
Chris Lloyd, the former accountant who started North American Spine in 2009, after over
six years in this business and having a background in accounting, is unable to provide any
color as to how he has come up with his overly optimistic guidance. Color me skeptical.


Target valuation: Based on the fundamental business issues that I have described, along
with overly optimistic guidance with low likelihood of success, it is my view that the
stock could trade down to $1.85/share, which would represent a generous 12x 2015E

EBITDA multiple, based on Q2-2015 run-rate EBITDA levels ((12x multiple x $13.1M
EBITDA less $14M debt) / 77.2M shares). My target price, thus, implies a 65%+ downside
in the current stock price.


Are Nobilis' Financials Any More Reliable Than The Company's Surgical
Procedure?


Any roll up with multiple mergers is going to lead to some complicated accounting. And
Nobilis takes this even further with many subsidiaries and partial ownership of entities.
Appendix A shows Nobilis's complicated organization, with 31 different entities and
multiple ownership percentages. All this for a company that brought in only $49 million in
revenue last quarter, for a shockingly low revenue per entity of less than $2 million. And of
all the accounting firms to audit that complexity, which one did Nobilis pick? None other
than tiny Calvetti Ferguson, with a total of 38 professionals. Barely more than the number
of entities it audited at Nobilis. And the company's CFO situation inspires no more
confidence. Since 2010, Nobilis has changed CFOs four times (Source: Bloomberg,
Company Filings).


In August, Calvetti resigned as auditor. This follows closely after the last CFO change in
July. A new CFO and a new auditor are now charged with figuring out all the complicated
arrangement and deals built up over the years. While this does not guarantee that any
problems will be found, it definitely increases the uncertainty.


Even my outsider's review of Nobilis' financial statements uncovered some potential
issues. Per the organization chart or the following statements, "The Company assigned
100% of its equity interest in MSID to NHC ASC - Dallas, of which the Company owns
35% as a result of syndication... In November 2013, the Company sold 15.1% of its
ownership interest in the Kirby Partnership to existing physician limited partners,
effectively decreasing the Company's ownership interest to 25%" - so this means the
company owns 35% of MSID and 25% of Kirby. However, it appears to be fully
consolidating both entities. The effect of this would be to inflate revenues so that the
growth story appears better than it really is (Source: Nobilis' latest 10-K).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 17/68


If the company were to proportionally consolidate revenues, its 2014 revenues would be
meaningfully lower by $36 million for a total of $44 million, as reflected in the following
adjusted chart (Source: Nobilis' latest 10-K).


It appears that Nobilis does not have control over these two subsidiaries. Also, if $44
million is the right number for revenue for 2014, then revenue growth is 44%, not the
astronomical 161% the company reported. It is noted that Nobilis retains the benefit of
fully consolidating FNH and FNSC in the chart above.


Conclusion | A Potential House of Cards


Nobilis has no accolades which would cause me to believe that the company can be one
of the few successful and sustainable roll up strategies. Instead, it has a history of poor
management with two prior roll ups that resulted in over 90% losses to shareholders (Acro
Energy and Northstar Healthcare from 2007-2010). Fundamentally, Nobilis is very unlikely
to make bullish guidance, yet management is extremely well paid and sells stock
relentlessly. One of its primary marketed experimental procedures (AccuraScope) has
questionable insurability, unsubstantiated success rates, lack of recognition from any
institutions (insurance, university or medical bodies) and a poor history, with patient lives
being ruined. And to top it all off, the company's accounting situation appears unstable
and vulnerable. This report is part I of a potential multi-series write-up, as Nobilis' depth of
issues runs deep.
