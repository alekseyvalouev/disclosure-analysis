"Things Gained Through Unjust Fraud Are Never Secure”               -   Sophocles


|


CHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED (“Minzhong” or the “Company”) is a 
Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”) based producer of fresh and processed vegetables.  In our 
opinion, Minzhong closely resembles Chaoda Modern Agriculture (SEHK: 0682) (“Chaoda”), 
another Fujian-based vegetable producer that has been halted since September 2011 under 
widespread allegations of fraud.  We believe that Minzhong, like Chaoda, has so significantly 
deceived regulators and investors about the scale of its business and its financial performance that 
we expect trading in its shares to be halted and its shares to be worthless.    


1. Fabricated Sales.  Publicly available filings indicate that Minzhong fabricated sales figures 
to its top two customers. 


a. Top Customer Incorporated After The Track Record Period.  Corporate registry 
records show that a Taiwan-based food distributor, which was supposedly Minzhong’s 
largest customer in the pre-IPO track record period (2007-2009), was only 
incorporated in November 2009, suggesting, in our view, that Minzhong simply 
fabricated the sales figures in its Prospectus.  


b. SAIC Filings Indicate Faked Sales.  SAIC files show that Minzhong’s second largest 
customer, which purportedly accounted for RMB 142 million in sales in 2009, had zero 
revenues and zero COGS in 2009. 


c. Undisclosed Related Party. Minzhong reported in its Prospectus that its top customers 
were independent third parties. But SAIC filings show that Minzhong’s second largest 
customer was not only co-founded by Company Chairman Mr. Lin Guo Rong but that 
Lin Guo Ping, who served as a legal representative of a Minzhong subsidiary, 
simultaneously served as the supervisor of the Minzhong customer.  It appears that 
Minzhong failed to disclose such material connections to investors. 


2. Top Supplier’s Business License Revoked pre-IPO.  SAIC filings show that Minzhong’s 
largest supplier during the pre-IPO track record period, which purportedly accounted for 18% 
of the Company’s total purchases in 1Q2010 and was the Company’s primary source of 
mushroom spores (reportedly its best selling product), was deregistered and stripped of its 
business license for violating PRC law in February 2010, a mere two months before 
Minzhong’s April 2010 IPO.  In our opinion, the implication of this deregistration is that the 
supplier was not a major operating business and that Minzhong fabricated payments to its 
largest supplier.


3. Attempted Cover Up? After a wave of accounting scandals and de-listings among other S-
Chips in early 2011, it appears that Minzhong doctored the historical financials of certain 
subsidiaries in their respective SAIC filings to make them appear consistent with Minzhong’s
Singapore-filed financials.  Prior to the apparent cover up, SAIC filings suggest that 
Minzhong’s assets and earnings were a small fraction of what the Company claimed in its 
Singapore-filed financials.

4. Suspicious Capital Expenditures. S-Chips and US-listed reverse mergers engaging in fraud 
often overstate reported capital expenditures to mask fake sales on the balance sheet. In FYs 
2011 and 2012, Minzhong claims to have spent around RMB 1.2 billion on the construction 
of a new industrial park in Putian.  Yet SAIC filings show an increase of only RMB 203
million in PP&E during the same period.  More suspiciously, the industrial park was not 
pledged as collateral for the Company’s bank loans; instead, Minzhong’s creditors sought 
personal, unsecured guarantees from the Company’s Chairman and its suppliers.  We believe 
that this is further evidence that Minzhong vastly overstated its capital expenditures.      


5. Reinventing the Wheel.  The Company’s business model is as old as agriculture itself, yet it 
so vastly outperforms other fresh produce growers that its reported financial performance 
defies credibility. 


a. EBITDA.  Minzhong’s reported EBITDA margins on fresh produce, its most 
profitable segment, averaged an absurd 66% during the past five years. 


b. Ballooning Receivables.  The Company’s receivables have skyrocketed of late, 
despite the fact that its credit terms have not changed.  We believe that the
persistent and unexplained growth in receivables is caused by the need to 
account for fake income on the balance sheet.    


c. Negative Free Cash Flow.  Since its IPO, Minzhong has generated negative 
free cash flow of RMB 1 billion. Much like other S-Chips which have been 
delisted under suspicion of impropriety, the Company relies on debt or equity 
financing as its primary source of cash generation.


6. Valuation. As of March 31, 2013, Minzhong had approximately RMB 1.1 billion of onshore 
liabilities outstanding, including bank loans and trade payables due to unsecured onshore 
creditors in the PRC.  In a liquidation scenario, the holders of onshore liabilities have 
historically taken priority over offshore equity holders. Because we believe that the Company 
has significantly overstated its sales and its capital expenditures, we doubt the authenticity of 
its reported receivables, cash balance and PP&E. Given the limited offshore assets available 
for seizure (cash denominated in USD, SGD, or Euro was limited to RMB 8 million as of 
6/30/2012) and the difficulty recovering onshore assets (property and equipment) from 
alleged fraudsters under China’s byzantine judicial system, we put a price target on 
Minzhong’s shares of SGD 0.00.

MAGIC MUSHROOMS


CHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED (“Minzhong” or the “Company”) is a Fujian-
based agricultural business that cultivates and processes vegetables in China for sale to produce 
distributors in the PRC.


Minzhong Annual Report 2012
5 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Minzhong’s business model is similar to that of Chaoda Modern Agriculture (SEHK: 0682), another 
Fujian-based agricultural company whose market capitalization peaked at ~HKD 33 billion before it 
collapsed under allegations of rampant fraud by Next Media (translation here, original Chinese language 
document is available here).  This led the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to suspend trading of its shares and 
initiate regulatory proceedings.  Trading of Chaoda’s shares has been suspended since the allegations 
surfaced, virtually wiping out its shareholders.1


Like Chaoda, we believe that Minzhong has made numerous material misrepresentations to investors, the 
Singapore Stock Exchange (“SGX”) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”).  


Investors do not need to perform our level of due diligence to believe that Minzhong is rotten, as even a 
simple reading of its financial statements requires the suspension of disbelief.  Chaoda appears to be the
only competitor whose reported EBITDA margins on the sale of fresh produce even come close to the
Company’s reported figures. Other major accounting red flags abound, including ballooning receivables
and the Company’s negative cumulative free cash flow since its IPO.


The most convincing evidence comes from publicly available filings from local offices of the State 
Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) in China and the corporate registry in Hong Kong, 
which in our opinion show that Minzhong faked sales to its top two customers, fabricated payments to its 
largest supplier, inflated its capital expenditures by up to RMB 1 billion to hide fabricated profits on its 
balance sheet, and tried to cover up its accounting improprieties by doctoring its historical SAIC 
financials.  


The writing may already be on the wall.  Minzhong’s two cornerstone IPO investors (who together, at one 
time, held over 30% of the outstanding shares of the Company) have sold all of their shares in the past 12 
months.   New investors, such as Indofoods, are, in our opinion, the victims of an elaborate and 
sophisticated financial hoax.  


Ultimately, we believe that Minzhong has materially overstated the scale and profitability of its business 
to investors and regulators, and, in doing so, violated a number of Singapore’s securities laws.  Like Hong 
Kong regulators with Chaoda, we believe that Singapore regulators will halt trading of Minzhong’s shares 
pending a full investigation into the Company.  


                                               
1 Chaoda’s board of directors has stated that it hopes to obtain permission to resume trading on April 2014.

FABRICATED SALES TO ITS TOP CUSTOMERS


Evidence indicates that Minzhong fabricated sales to its top two customers, suggesting that the Company 
overstated revenues in its IPO Prospectus by at least a third during the track record period. According to 
the Prospectus, the following were Minzhong’s largest customers during the track record period (FY 
2007-1Q 2010):2


1) The Customer That Didn’t Exist?


According to the Prospectus, Hong Kong Yifenli Trading Co. Ltd (“Hong Kong Yifenli”), a Taiwan-
based food distributor, was supposedly Minzhong’s largest customer during the track record period from 
June 2006 to September 2009.  


However, according to publicly available records from Hong Kong’s Companies Registry,3 excerpted 
below, Hong Kong Yifenli was only incorporated on November 6, 2009.  Note that the Chinese name of 
Hong Kong Yifenli (香港一分利贸易有限公司) in the certificate of incorporation below is an exact 
match to the Chinese name listed in the Company’s Prospectus.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


This begs the obvious question of how Hong Kong Yifenli could be Minzhong’s biggest customer from 
June 2006 to September 2009 when it apparently did not exist prior to November 2009!


In addition, we could not find any trace of Hong Kong Yifenli being registered in Taiwan, its purported 
base of operations.4  Nor could we find any evidence or records of the customer’s existence online.  
Combined with the certificate of incorporation above showing that Hong Kong Yifenli was incorporated 
long after it was purportedly buying vegetables from Minzhong, in our opinion, the preponderance of the 
evidence indicates that the Company simply fabricated its sales figures to its best customer in its 
Prospectus.  


2) SAIC Filings Indicate Fake Sales


According to the Prospectus, the Company’s second biggest customer during the track record period was 
Putian Daziran Vegetables Produce Co., Ltd. (“Putian Vegetables”), which purportedly accounted for 
RMB 142 million in sales in FY 2009 (13.4% of Minzhong’s total revenue that year).  Similarly, for Q1 
2010 (July-Sept 2009), according to the Prospectus, Putian Vegetables comprised 13.6% of Minzhong’s
sales (RMB 30.3 million).

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Yet publicly available SAIC filings (excerpted below) show that Putian Vegetables had zero revenues,
zero COGS and a net profit of RMB 6,083 in calendar year 2009. The absence of any COGS 
indicates that Minzhong’s supposed customer did not purchase any goods from Minzhong (or anyone 
else) in 2009.
9 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Putian Vegetables’ SAIC balance sheet, excerpted below, corroborates this conclusion. The 2009 SAIC 
filings show that Putian Vegetables had inventory of RMB 53,217 as of January 1, 2009, which remained 
unchanged as of December 31, 2009.  This is consistent with the SAIC income statements, which showed 
that Putian Vegetables had zero COGS in that calendar year.
10 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Similarly, according to 2010 SAIC filings, Putian Vegetables had zero revenue, zero COGS and a net 
profit of RMB 6,743 for the calendar year 2010, indicating that it did not buy any vegetables from 
Minzhong in that calendar year.
11 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


On the balance sheet side, again, SAIC filings show that there was no change in the customer’s inventory
balance from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010, consistent with zero COGS and the conclusion that 
Putian Vegetables was not buying vegetables from Minzhong during this period, even though the 
Company told investors in its Prospectus that Putian Vegetables was its second largest customer at the 
time of its IPO.
12 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


We believe that SAIC filings show conclusively that Putian Vegetables was not buying any vegetables 
from anyone (let alone the Company) in 2009 and 2010.  In our opinion, this indicates that Minzhong
fabricated its reported sales to this customer during the track record period.


3) Undisclosed Related Party


According to the Company’s Prospectus, its top customers were independent third parties. However,
SAIC filings show that Minzhong’s Chairman and founder, Mr. Lin Guo Rong, co-founded 
Minzhong's second largest customer, Putian Vegetables, in 1997.  Chairman Lin’s signature even 
appears in the SAIC filings (excerpted below).

13 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Rather than appearing like an independent third party, the above filing shows that Putian Vegetables was 
co-founded by Minzhong’s Chairman.  According to the same filings, Chairman Lin resigned in 2002 
from his position, but he is not the only undisclosed connection.  


SAIC filings also show that Mr. Lin Guo Ping (Chinese: 林国平) was appointed as supervisor of Putian 
Vegetables in September 2007 for one year until his resignation in September 2008.
14 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


This should alarm investors because the same Lin Guo Ping, the putative supervisor of Minzhong’s 
second largest customer, appears to have simultaneously served as the legal representative of the 
Minzhong subsidiary, Sichuan Minzhong Organic Food, from 2007 to 2010, as shown in the following 
excerpt of the subsidiary’s SAIC filings.
15 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


Lin Guo Ping, who served as the legal representative of a Minzhong subsidiary from January 2007 to July 
2010, simultaneously served (Sept. 2007- Sept. 2008) as the ‘supervisor’ of Putian Vegetables during the 
period in which Minzhong was reporting significant sales to that customer. Minzhong stated 
unequivocally in its Prospectus that none of its top customers were related parties, whether the interest 
was direct or indirect.5  


    
We believe that it is a violation of Singapore securities laws for Minzhong to fail to disclose that one of 
the Company’s legal representatives simultaneously served as the supervisor of its second largest 
customer during of the track record period.   We also believe that such undisclosed related party 
connections corroborate the evidence (discussed above) that Minzhong fabricated sales to its second 
largest customer.

TOP SUPPLIER’S BUSINESS LICENSE REVOKED BEFORE IPO


Chengdu Shufeng Agriculture (“Chengdu Shufeng”) was listed in Minzhong’s Prospectus as the 
Company’s largest supplier during the pre-IPO track record period, purportedly accounting for a total of 
RMB 161 million of purchases during that time (and 17.8% of Minzhong’s purchases during 1Q 2010):6


However, filings show that the Chengdu Dayi District SAIC office revoked Chengdu Shufeng’s business 
license, deregistered it, and ordered the supplier to turn over its official seal to the government on 
February 2, 2010, two months before Minzhong went public.

Below we have provided our translation of the Penalty Decision Notice:


Chengdu Dayi Administration For Industry and Commerce
Administrative Penalty Decision Notice


Cheng Industry and Commerce City Department Letter [2010] No. 156


Party: Cheng Du Shu Feng Nong Ye Development Co., Ltd. 
Legal Representative (Person in Charge): Li Xuefeng


Identified: The party failed to submit business inspection for more than two consecutive years in 
accordance with the regulations, which violates the provision of Article 67 of “Regulations of the 
People’s Republic of China on Administration of Registration of Companies.” According to the 
provision of Article 76 of “Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Administration of 
Registration of Companies,” our bureau decides to revoke its business license. The party has to 
hand over the business license and official seal to our bureau within 15 days of receiving the 
“Penalty Decision Notice.” After the business license is revoked, liquidation team organized by 
the shareholders is responsible for liquidation of the party’s claims and liabilities. 


Before making the penalty decision, this bureau has informed the party about facts, reasons, basis 
on the intention to make the administrative penalty according to the laws, and the legally entitled 
rights for representation, defense and hearing. 


If the party disagrees on this penalty decision, the party may request Chengdu Administration for 
Industry and Commerce for reconsideration within 60 days of receiving the “Penalty Decision 
Notice,” or initiate legal proceedings at People’s Court of Dayi County within three months 
according to the laws. 


February 2, 2010


Article 67 of the Administrative Regulations Governing the Registration of Companies (available here: 
http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/argtroc660/#9), requires PRC companies to file annual 
inspections, typically consisting of basic financials and business information, with the local SAIC office. 


The above Penalty Decision Notice states that the SAIC office revoked Chengdu Shufeng’s business 
license after the company failed to file annual inspections with the office for “more than two 
consecutive years” (i.e. for at least calendar years 2008 and 2009).  According to SAIC filings, Chengdu 
Shufeng remains deregistered and it has not had the legal authority to operate a business since February 
2010.  


We find it highly unlikely that a supplier receiving RMB 161 million in just over two years would allow 
its business license to be revoked for failure to submit routine filings and financial statements to its local 
SAIC office.  Chengdu Shufeng was supposedly the largest supplier of mushroom spores to a soon-to-be 
public company.  Its sales to Minzhong were supposedly increasing at the time of the IPO.  Chengdu 
Shufeng had every incentive to maintain an operating business, yet it allowed its status to be revoked a 
mere two months before Minzhong’s IPO. 


We believe that the revocation of Chengdu Shufeng’s business license prior to the IPO indicates that 
Minzhong was simply fabricating the amount of payments to its largest mushroom-spore supplier in order 
to deceive bankers, investors and regulators about the scale and profitability of its mushroom business;
which was and continues to be the most important produce segment in the Company’s growth and 
profitability forecasts.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


In addition, SAIC filings show that Chengdu Shufeng was incorporated on April 6, 2006, only two 
months before the beginning of Minzhong’s FY2007: 


This is suspicious because it appears that the Company’s largest supplier was incorporated solely for the 
purpose of Minzhong’s track record period (June 2006 – September 2009).  Supposedly a thriving 
mushroom spore supplier, Chengdu Shufeng was incorporated two months before the beginning of 
Minzhong’s track record period and had its business license revoked two months before the 
Company’s IPO.  


We believe that this evidence supports a clear narrative: Chengdu Shufeng was not a thriving mushroom 
spore business; rather it was established to create a paper trail for Minzhong’s IPO and allow the 
Company to fabricate purchases from its largest supplier to artificially inflate the scale and profitability of 
its business.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


ATTEMPTED COVER UP


SAIC filings also suggest an attempt by the Company to cover its tracks after a wave of S-Chips 
collapsed under the weight of accounting scandals and impropriety.  


We suspect that this ham-fisted attempt was motivated by a wave of S-Chips scandals in early 2011.  
Trading in the shares of China Hongxing Sports, Sino Techfibre, China Gaoxian and Hongwei 
Technologies was suspended in the first half of 2011 under the suspicion of accounting fraud.  The frenzy 
of scandals and trading halts cast a pall on S-Chips and sent shares of PRC-based, SGX-listed companies 
plummeting. 


In 2011, while this torrent of accounting scandals threatened to engulf Minzhong, SAIC filings show that 
the Company switched local accountants and appears to have doctored the historical balance sheets and 
income statements of certain subsidiaries to make their SAIC financial statements more consistent with 
the Company’s Singapore-filed financials.  Luckily, SAIC offices preserved the original 2010 filings, 
which indicate not only that Minzhong vastly exaggerated the scale and profitability of its business, but 
also that the Company attempted to cover up its historical results at a time when scandals threatened to 
embroil the S-chip market. 


1) Sichuan Minzhong


The 2010 SAIC filings (available in Appendix I) of Sichuan Minzhong Organic Food Co., Ltd. (“Sichuan

Sichuan Minzhong was not the only subsidiary whose SAIC financials appear to have been doctored amid 
the wave of S-Chip accounting scandals in 2011.  


2) Putian Minzhong


SAIC filings of Putian Licheng Minzhong Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“Putian Minzhong”), 
another key Minzhong subsidiary, tell the same story. The subsidiary’s 2010 SAIC filings (available in 
Appendix I) show that in 2010, it had only RMB 1.5 million in assets, RMB 88,804 in retained 
earnings and RMB 87,539 in net income.  


Yet according to Putian Minzhong’s 2011 SAIC filings, the beginning balances on its balance sheet 
(which should obviously be identical to the ending balances from December 31, 2010 found in the 2010 
SAIC filings) show that total assets were RMB 1.44 billion and retained earnings were RMB 864 
million.  The increases came from two new categories of assets, “other receivables” and “total intangible 
and other assets.”  The 2011 SAIC filings also stated that 2010 net income was RMB 194 million, which 
was more than a 2000-fold increase over what auditors stated in the 2010 filings. In the chart below we 
compare the income statements and balance sheets from Putian Minzhong’s 2010 and 2011 filings.

As with Sichuan Minzhong, the Company changed Putian Minzhong’s auditor responsible for preparing 
its SAIC filings in 2011.  This auditor change accompanied almost a 1,000-fold increase in the historical 
total assets and a 9,600-fold increase in earnings of the operating subsidiary for the 2010 calendar year.  


Sinopipe Holdings Ltd., another troubled S-Chip whose shares have been halted since March 2012, first 
came under scrutiny when its auditors discovered “significant discrepancies between the audited PRC 
GAAP financial statements of certain PRC subsidiaries for previous financial years filed with the local 
PRC authorities and audited PRC GAAP financial statements provided by management…”  We believe 
that similar discrepancies appear in Minzhong’s records.


We believe that the subsidiaries’ SAIC files provide compelling evidence that the Company doctored its 
SAIC files in 2011 to make the financials of its operating subsidiaries appear more consistent with the 
Company’s Singapore-filed financials.  In our opinion, management most likely got scared by the wave of 
S-Chip accounting scandals and figured that the spotlight would soon fall on the Company. We believe 
that the Company’s auditor, Crowe Horwath, has a duty to investigate the major discrepancy in the 
SAIC filings and should refrain from signing off on any financial statements of the Company until 
management provides a satisfactory explanation.  We suspect none will be forthcoming.

SUSPICIOUS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES


Companies fabricating sales and profits face a problem: they must account for the fake receipts on the 
balance sheet.  Otherwise, an auditor would easily discover that the cash balance fails to match the 
amount of fabricated receipts.  This is why companies engaging in fraud often overstate reported capital 
expenditures. 


In fiscal years 2011 and 2012, Minzhong claims to have spent RMB 1.2 billion on the construction of the 
Putian New Industrial Park (“Putian Industrial Park”). The following screenshot is from the FY2011 
annual report and shows RMB 814 million in expenditures on the Putian Industrial Park in that fiscal year 
alone.  This expenditure increased the Company’s reported property, plant and equipment by 204% to 
RMB 1.1 billion at the end of FY 2011.

24 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


The Company’s Singapore-filed financials state that the capital expenditures continued in FY2012. 
According to the Company’s FY2012 management presentation, the “[i]ncrease in PPE from RMB 
1,113.9 million to RMB 1,832.0 million was mainly due to the addition of Phase 1 (operational) and 2 
(construction in progress) of the New Industrial Park.”  The following screenshot from the 2012 Annual 
Report shows the purported increase in PP&E.  


In aggregate, Minzhong purportedly spent at least RMB 1.2 billion in capital expenditures on the Putian 
Industrial Park.  


But SAIC filings suggest that these expenditures were massively exaggerated, presumably to hide 
fabricated profits. According to the Putian local government website (www.putian.gov.cn), the Putian 
Industrial Park belongs to Minzhong subsidiary Fujian Minzhong Organic Food Co., Ltd. (“Fujian 
Minzhong”):8

SAIC filings reveal that as of December 31, 2011, Fujian Minzhong only had RMB 223 million of 
PP&E (includes fixed assets and construction in progress), versus RMB 118 million on December 31,
2010, an increase of only RMB 105 million during the calendar year 2011.  


Likewise, as of December 31, 2012, Fujian Minzhong only had RMB 321 million of PP&E (including
fixed assets and construction in progress), representing an increase of RMB 98 million during the 
calendar year 2012.
27 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


PP&E figures from Fujian Minzhong's calendar year 2011 and 2012 SAIC filings, when added together, 
state that the subsidiary only added RMB 203 million of PP&E! This suggests that Minzhong overstated 
its capital expenditures by over RMB 1 billion, which, in our opinion, makes sense, because the 
Company had to find a way to hide fabricated profits on its balance sheet and could not simply tell its 
auditors or investors that it was sitting on RMB 1 billion in cash.
28 
 












































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA MINZHONG FOOD CORPORATION LIMITED | SGX: K2N    BB: MINZ|


The collateralization of Minzhong’s debt provides further corroborating evidence supporting our opinion 
that Minzhong inflated its capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2012, Minzhong’s balance sheet showed 
RMB 616 million in bank borrowings.  


Strangely, these borrowings are secured by less than RMB 50 million of PP&E9 and RMB 3 million10 of 
land use rights: 


Why would a bank loan RMB 616 million to the Company and not require such debt to be secured by a 
supposedly brand-new RMB 1.2 billion industrial facility? 


Stranger still, the loans are also secured by personal guarantees from the Chairman, a supplier, and even a 
so-called ‘non-related party:’11


Such pledges and guarantees are highly suspicious.  Why would a bank accept a guarantee from a 
supplier, the Chairman, and a non-related party to secure a loan when there was supposedly RMB 1.2
billion in gleaming PP&E to serve as collateral?  Creditors almost always prefer hard assets to backstop a 
loan over the promises of individuals and other companies (which are typically not secured by a lien or 
mortgage on real property, equipment or tangible assets).   


In our opinion, the conclusion is obvious: the banks could not secure the loans with the Putian Industrial 
Park because Minzhong grossly exaggerated its value.  Falsifying capital expenditures to hide fake profits 
is a recurring practice among S-Chips committing fraud – we believe that the glove fits Minzhong snugly.

REINVENTING THE WHEEL


Many investors may come to the conclusion that Minzhong is fabricating its financial statements without 
the amount of due diligence that we performed. In an industry with massive fragmentation among 
Chinese farmers, we should not expect one grower (without enormous economies of scale) to 
significantly outperform its peer group.  


Yet Minzhong’s key EBITDA margins for fresh produce are so far superior to its peers, including
Chaoda, that its reported financial performance simply does not pass the smell test. 


1) EBITDA Margins


Minzhong's business is comprised of two segments: the processed foods segment, which includes 
processed vegetables, frozen vegetables, and beverages, and accounted for 62% of the Company’s FY 
2012 revenues, and the fresh produce segment which accounted for 38% of FY 2012 revenues ("Fresh 
Produce Segment").  Despite comprising a minority of sales, the Fresh Produce Segment reportedly 
accounted for 65% of the Company’s FY 2012 EBITDA.  


The Chinese vegetable farming comps are a motley crew of troubled companies: trading of Chaoda’s 
shares have been suspended since 2011, Le Gaga's (Nasdaq: GAGA) close links to Chaoda has caused its 
stock price to drop 61% below its IPO price and lose virtually all trading volume, and China Green 
Holdings (HK: 904) is the subject of a formal SFC inquiry.  Yet Minzhong's Fresh Produce Segment
EBITDA margins are by far the best at an absurd 60%.  Laughably, Minzhong claimed its 2007 and 2008 
EBITDA margins on its Fresh Produce Segment exceeded 80%. 


It appears that the publicly listed competitor that came closest to Minzhong’s reported ~60% EBITDA 
margins on growing fresh produce in China was Chaoda.

Minzhong grows vegetables.  How can it possibly have generated such EBITDA margins (90% in 
FY2007, 80% in FY2008 and 63% in FY2012) in its Fresh Produce Segment? 


Minzhong's pretax margins on fresh vegetables should be inherently low because: a) unprocessed 
vegetables are the ultimate commodity; b) according to the Prospectus, Minzhong's fresh vegetables are 
sold exclusively within the PRC, where vegetables are generally cheap and plentiful, and c) Minzhong 
appears to have several middlemen between their fresh vegetables and the end consumer. 


According to a Macquarie Research report dated November 10, 2010:


Minzhong appears to lose ~4% to a pre-processing agent that washes and sorts ~70% of its fresh produce 
volume.  Those products might then be bought back by Minzhong and sold to a distributor.  In our 
opinion, an unusually high EBITDA margin for a business model that sells to various middlemen before 
its commoditized product reaches consumers is a major red flag.

2) Ballooning Receivables


In our view, Minzhong’s skyrocketing receivables are further evidence that the Company is fabricating 
sales.  Much like inflated capital expenditures, ballooning receivables are often a convenient way to hide 
fake receipts on the balance sheet.   An enormous receivables balance was a telltale sign of impropriety at 
China Medical Technologies, a former NASDAQ-listed Chinese company that was delisted after we 
brought to market evidence of fraud (full report available here).

Minzhong's collection policy is 30 to 90 days (average 60).  In FY2012, the Company's past due accounts 
grew rapidly, yet were deemed to be "not impaired."


Source: Company 2012 annual report.


The Company’s explanation for why these accounts were not impaired is because 97% of the receivables
belong to customers that are "currently making regular payments on the receivables." 12   Yet, the 
Company's average days receivables continued to accelerate through 3Q2013.


Note: Day Sales Outstanding calculated as per page 13 of Company 2012 annual report.


We think the most likely explanation for the jump in receivables is that the Company has fabricated sales 
and needs a place to stash fake receipts on its balance sheet.

3) Negative Free Cash Flow


Investors should expect companies with 60% or higher EBITDA margins to also accumulate free cash 
flow, but not Minzhong.  Since its IPO, Minzhong has accumulated negative RMB 1 billion in free cash 
flow.  Even excluding its purported RMB 1.2 billion investment in capital expenditures associated with 
the Putian Industrial Park, cumulative free cash flow is negligible.  The poor quality of Minzhong's 
earnings is another major red flag indicating that the Company’s income statement does not reflect the 
economic reality of the underlying business.


The chart above shows that despite the Company’s reported profitability, it has not generated free cash 
flow since its IPO.  Much like other S-Chips whose shares have been either delisted or suspended under 
suspicion of impropriety (e.g. China Sky Chemical Fiber and Celestial Nutrifoods), the Company relies 
on debt or equity financing as its primary source of cash generation.


VALUATION


We believe that the SGX will quickly verify the evidence presented in this report and halt trading of 
Minzhong’s stock before any more investors are hurt.  We also believe that regulators will thereafter 
delist the Company for what in our opinion are pervasive misrepresentations to regulators and investors.   


There is a wealth of evidence to support our opinion that Minzhong has vastly exaggerated its sales and 
the size of its business.  We also believe that the Company has inflated the size of assets such as its 
receivables and the value of its property, plant and equipment.  After all, if a company is booking fake 
sales, such receipts must be accounted for on the balance sheet. 


As of March 31, 2013, Minzhong had approximately RMB 1.1 billion of onshore liabilities outstanding, 
including bank loans and trade payables due to unsecured onshore creditors.  In a liquidation scenario, the 
holders of onshore liabilities take priority over shareholders.

Investors in Singapore capital markets are already sadly familiar with the difficulty of recovering 
anything from Chinese-based companies whose shares are halted under investigation for fraud (e.g. 
FerroChina).  Singapore lacks an extradition treaty with China, leaving management beyond the reach of 
local authorities and creditors alike.  


Given the limited offshore assets available for seizure (cash denominated in USD, SGD, or Euro was 
limited to RMB 8 million as of 6/30/2012) and the difficulty recovering onshore assets (property and 
equipment) from alleged fraudsters under China’s arbitrary judicial system, we put a price target on 
Minzhong’s shares of SGD 0.00.
