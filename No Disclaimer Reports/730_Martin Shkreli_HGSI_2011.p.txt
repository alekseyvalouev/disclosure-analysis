Human Genome Sciences: Slow Benlysta Launch Results In Good
Short Candidate

Human Genome Sciences (Nasdaq: HGSI) has a market cap of $2.4 billion. Its main asset
is Benlysta, a newly approved lupus drug. Because HGS shares half of their gross profit
from Benlysta with partner GSK, it is more appropriate to think about the “Benlysta market
cap” of roughly $5 billion. WK sales data last month suggest monthly sales of $5 million for
this asset. At a run rate of $60 million annually, this is a product trading at 83x sales. Even
if the run rate increases substantially from here, as it did with the Remicade in its early
years, this early base is much lower than expectations.


My modeling suggests a global peak sales estimate of $750 million, with fair value for
HGS at $7 per share, or 40% downside. I think my peak sales and value estimates are
generous to HGS. This product is simply not efficacious enough. Drugs like Remicade,
Enbrel, Humira are “night and day” differences for their patients. Benlysta is much more
like Provenge, where the medical community is skeptical of relevant efficacy as the data
sets for both drugs suggest a modest benefit. Physicians will use their discretion as to
which patients may benefit most from Benlysta.


Lupus is a highly symptomatic disease where unless a flare is prevented or the severity
lessened, patients and physicians aren’t served. Benlysta doesn’t seem to do either,
instead it seems to provide a very small benefit in a highly variable disease. Lofty sales
estimates rely on Benlysta patients remaining on Benlysta, an unlikely to occur scenario
as the large patient copay and insurance pressures limit “perpetual” revenue drugs from
patients who are not clearly benefitting. I could see revenue for Benlysta peak soon and
then begin to decline sequentially as patient time on drug shrinks.
