GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS 


 Aurelius’ shares are worth no more than €8.56 per share, 
implying at least -88% downside to its current share price. 


 Aurelius may face similar scrutiny as Philip Green did in the 
UK, who was accused of systematically plundering BHS. 


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 


 We were unable to reconcile 43% - 100%+ of Aurelius’s 
reported earnings to the sum of its subsidiaries’ earnings. 


 2015 contingent liabilities, as calculated by the sum of its 
parts, seem understated by 46% or more. 


 Aurelius’ income from negative goodwill accounts for over 
120% of 2011-2015 earnings.  


 Similarly high levels of negative goodwill preceded a 
permanent -95%+ collapse in the share price of Arques AG, 
whose business model seems identical to Aurelius’. 


 Aurelius claims to be a “good home for companies” yet 
nearly 60% of portfolio companies entered insolvency 
after Aurelius sold them, per our review. 


 Our estimate of NAV is 80%-90% lower than Aurelius’ 
unaudited and DCF-based NAV. 


 Aurelius has never received an unqualified audit opinion 
on its audited financial statements. 


 CEO Dirk Markus, a former Finance executive of Arques is 
also the CFO of Aurelius, according to Hauck & Aufhauser. 


 Aurelius’ executives sold €169 million of shares in 
December 2016 (40% or more their stake) at €52.5 per 
share. The prevailing market price was €59 that day. 


 Aurelius has been accused of illegal conveyance (and 
found guilty in some cases) in its business dealings 
(Einhorn case, EDS case).  


 Aurelius “abstains” from providing negative goodwill-
related disclosures “because it believes that they can lead 
to economic disadvantages.”

INTRODUCTION 


Upon first glance, Aurelius (“AR4”) seems like a truly exceptional investment company. Since December 
31, 2006, Aurelius’s share price has appreciated at more than 2x Berkshire Hathaway’s long-term rate1: 





Gotham City Research has found very few investors with the ability to sustain an annualized rate of growth 
exceeding 20% - let alone 40%. So we were curious: what is the secret to AR4’s rapid rise?  Is it sustainable? 
And why does AR4’s rate of growth in its book value lag far behind its share price’s rate of growth? After 
all, Berkshire’s book value and share price growth have converged, long-term. 


The following preliminary findings led us to believe that Aurelius’ share price would converge to its 
reported Net Asset Value (or lower) implying a 33%-50% decline in the share price: 


 Aurelius' CEO was an Arques AG executive, whose share price crashed -95% years after he left. 
 Aurelius does not have an independent CFO. Dirk Markus is CEO & CFO according to one broker.2 
 None of Aurelius’ audit reports, since going public in 2006, are unqualified. Its NAV is unaudited.3 


We dug deeper and experienced a major research breakthrough when we conducted google searches for 
“Arques fraud”. Based on what we uncovered, we wondered: is the story of Arques’ rise and fall, a 
roadmap to Aurelius’ story – past, present, and future? Why did Arques’ shares & profits collapse? Why 
have neither recovered since 2007? Has Aurelius engaged in the same patterns of behaviors, in recent 
years, as Arques did immediately before Arques’ earnings and share price crashed? 


Gotham City Research believes that, yes, Aurelius is engaging in behaviors that resemble Arques’ 
immediately before the latter’s earnings and share price collapsed. For example: 


 43% - 100%+ of Aurelius’s 2012-2015 reported earnings seem suspect, based on our inspection. 
 Aurelius’ income from negative goodwill has risen dramatically over the last few years, and now 


accounts for over 120% of 2011-2015 earnings – levels that Arques reached prior to its collapse. 
 2015 contingent liabilities, as calculated by the sum of its parts, seem understated by 46% or more. 
 Aurelius claims to be a “good home for companies” yet nearly 60% of subsidiaries entered 


insolvency after Aurelius sold them (often to suspect buyers). 
 Despite its considerable size, Aurelius has chosen not to register its shares at a regulated stock 


exchange. Instead, Aurelius shares are merely quoted on the unregulated Freiverkehr, which 
reminds us of AIM where Quindell was listed and MAB where Gowex was listed.  


Gotham City Research believe that Aurelius is, indeed, an exceptional investment company – but for all 
the wrong reasons.

Arques & Aurelius: Same Questionable Model, Same Destiny? 


The CEO of Aurelius is a former Arques Executive and Arques’ Long Term Share Performance is a Disaster 


CEO Dirk Markus, a former finance executive of Arques AG, founded Aurelius soon after departing Arques 
in 2005. It is believed Markus’ newly founded investment company was a knock-off, even competitor, of 
Arques. Both companies have been accused of suspect – even illegal – business practices. Arques’ shares 
crashed within a few years after Markus departed. Arques (now renamed Gigaset AG) shares have never 
recovered1: 





Given that both Arques’ and Aurelius’ business models have been plagued by serious accusations of 
controversial behavior – e.g., squeezing cash out of its acquired companies2 – we wondered: 


 Were there warnings signs at Arques prior to the collapse in its shares – for example, suspect 
accounting and business practices – that immediately preceded the crash in Arques’ stock price?  


 Has Aurelius engaged in the same patterns of behaviors in recent years, as Arques did 
immediately before Arques’ earnings and share price crashed? 


A rapid rise in & high levels of income from negative goodwill, preceded the crash in Arques’ share price 


In the case of Arques, there were at least the following warning signs that came before its shares collapsed: 


 100%+ of Arques 2004-2008 earnings derived from “income from negative goodwill”3, generally 
a very rare & non-recurring source of income for most companies (it turns out Arques was an 
outlier among outliers, as it alone seemed to account for 40% of all such transactions among 
German issuers, according to Corporate Ownership & Control/Volume 12, Issue 2, Winter 2016 – 
Frequency of and Reasons for Bargain Purchases – Evidence from Germany). 


 The DPR – The German Accounting Supervisory Agency –  carried out a review of Arques’ financial 
statements and determined nine accounting mistakes; BaFin asked Arques to publish DPR’s 
determinations immediately4. 


 Arques’ CEO Peter Low sold EUR 80 million in shares in early 20075. 
 Arques’ earnings and share price both collapsed after negative goodwill peaked in 2007.
Page 7 of 68 
 





Aurelius: Similar Warning Signs? 


Gotham City Research believes Aurelius currently exhibits the same patterns as Arques did immediately 
before Arques’ earnings and share price crashed. Take for example, negative goodwill6: 


 Aurelius’ income from negative goodwill has grown rapidly in recent years, just as Arques’s did 
before its shares and earnings collapsed 





 
 Aurelius’ preliminary 2016 EBITDA has declined -44% year over year 





 Aurelius’ management sold €169 million of shares recently at a large discount to market7 - On 
12 December 2016, Aurelius posted disclosure updates to its website that showed the 
management team had sold 8 million shares at EUR 52.5 per share (market price was EUR 59).   


How many shares does Aurelius’ management currently own?  


Due to its quotation on the Freiverkehr – where Aurelius management was previously not required to 
disclose their share dealings – it is unclear whether or not management sold shares between December 
2014 & July 2016. If we assume management sold no shares between December 2014 – July 20167:  





If we assume management sold shares between December 2014 – July 2016, at the same rate they sold 
shares in 2013-2014, then Aurelius’ management would hold far few shares than widely believed:

Germany’s DPR complained about Arques’ accounting. Do Aurelius’ financial statements add up?  


Recall that Germany’s DPR had reprimanded Arques for its 2004 accounting, and Bafin asked the company 
to publish DPR’s determinations immediately: 


The DPR had carried out a review of the 2004 financial statements of Arques Industries AG, listed 
in the SDAX, after the media had repeatedly reported alleged overvaluations of individual balance 
sheet items. The DPR complained of nine accounting errors, and BaFin asked the company to 
publish the errors immediately. – Handbuch Anti-Fraud-Management: Bilanzbetrug erkennen - 
vorbeugen – bekämpfen by Stefan Hofmann 


Gotham City Research believes that like Arques’, Aurelius’ accounting is suspect. For example, we were 
unable to reconcile 43%-100%+ of Aurelius’s consolidated earnings to the sum of its subsidiaries’ earnings8: 





What might explain the accounting irregularities shown above? Possible explanations: 


 Aurelius’ consolidated earnings are materially incorrect and misleading. 
 Aurelius’ subsidiaries are in fact, loss-making in 2015, and therefore, Aurelius recognizes no 


income from its subsidiaries’ operating activities in 2015.  Furthermore, the sum of its subsidiaries’ 
P&Ls lead to losses, over the entire 2012-2015 period. 


This might explain why Aurelius’ other income, e.g. negative goodwill, accounts for over 100% of its 2012-
2015 consolidated profits. Maybe Aurelius’ operating income = zero (or less than zero). As the accounting 
irregularities shown above are quite large – exceeding 100% in several instances – Aurelius’ accounting 
warrants close scrutiny.  


We raise some of the adverse ‘possible explanations’ above, because we have identified additional 
accounting irregularities in Aurelius’ and its subsidiaries’ financial statements, as described in the next 
section.

Are 43% - 100%+ of Aurelius’s reported earnings suspect? 


There is No Shortage of Accounting irregularities: Do Aurelius’ reported figures even add up? 


If Aurelius is currently following the same path as Arques did just before the latters’ shares (and earnings) 
collapsed, what other Aurelius-related warning signs might be present? For starters, Aurelius’ accounting 
problems seem even worse than presented in the prior section, for the following reasons:  


 Aurelius reports EUR 64 million in 2015 contingent liabilities yet the sum of individually reported 
contingent liabilities exceeds EUR 94 million, per our calculations.  


 This is especially concerning, as Arques’ solvency was threatened by risks arising from contingent 
liabilities. This validates our suspicion that Aurelius exhibits the same risks as Arques. 


 We have identified at least EUR 25 million of accounting irregularities related to depreciation & 
amortization. 


 The reported ‘change in cash and cash equivalents’ figure for 2015 differs from the calculated sum 
of its components, by 5.6%.  


 9 of Aurelius’ UK subsidiaries’ earnings and equity figures do not match with the corresponding 
subsidiaries’ Companies House filings. 


 We were unable to reconcile at least EUR 13 million of UK subsidiaries’ earnings and/or equity 
figures to the corresponding figures provided in Aurelius’ annual report 2015.  


 Aurelius claims that its subsidiaries’ “equity and profit/loss figures are the same figures as those 
presented in the local financial statements” in footnote 2 of its list of subsidiaries.  





Can Aurelius be trusted? Or is Aurelius hiding something?  


There are plausible explanations for some of the accounting irregularities we identified. For example, 
some of the more minor accounting errors we identified appear more careless than malicious. See the 
appendix for information on these minor errors.  


The question is: why does there appear to be a pattern of accounting irregularities, big and small? After 
all, Aurelius is Dirk Markus’ company. And Dirk Markus was a member of Arques’ Executive Board until 
2005, in charge of Finance (in fact, a Bloomberg news article referred to Dirk Markus as Arques’ CFO)1. 


The DPR complained about Arques’ 2004 accounting and we find problems with Aurelius’ accounting 
today. As they say: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”  


Is Aurelius’ accounting understating, hiding, and/or obfuscating the true risks to the business model?  


Is Aurelius “a hospital for sick businesses where we help to cure them” as CEO Dirk Markus claims, or is 
Aurelius more like Sir Philip Green, who allegedly “systematically plundered” BHS, as its owner,  (and has 
recently apologized and agreed to pay GBP 363 million)2?
Page 10 of 68 
 


Aurelius contingent liabilities don’t reconcile, they may be understated by 50% and off balance sheet 


The Contingent liabilities numbers disclosed in the notes to the financial statements do not reconcile with 
the calculated sums in 2014 and 2015, although they seem to reconcile in years prior to 20143:  





Risks arising from contingent liabilities threatened Arques with insolvency 


The potential understatement of contingent liabilities is a material risk factor for Aurelius, as has been 
demonstrated with Arques’ implosion:  


 In 2007 (and prior years), Arques’ auditor does not mention contingent liabilities as a risk factor 
to solvency. 


 In 2008, Arques’ auditor mentions that contingent liabilities would be a risk factor to solvency. 
 In 2009, Arques’ auditor mentions that contingent liabilities is a risk factor to solvency. 


In 2008 Arques’ auditor introduced the following “if, then” contingent liability-related warning – which 
was not present in the prior years4: 


In accordance with our professional obligations, we draw attention to the comments regarding 
financial obligations made by the company in the section entitled "Report on opportunities and 
risks" in the Combined Management Report. Attention is drawn to the fact that, should the 
guarantees and payment assurances issued by ARQUES Industries AG be executed or claimed in 
close succession and in larger amounts, this would pose a threat to the continued existence of the 
parent company and the Group. Furthermore, we draw attention to the comments regarding the 
threat to the continued existence of the tiscon Group that are made in the section entitled 
"ARQUES Group and subsidiaries" in the Combined Management Report. This would be the case if 
the restructuring measures that have been initiated are not implemented successfully and the 
parent company does not provide financial support."

group's ability to continue as a going concern is threatened by risks which are described in the 
sections entitled "Financial risk" and "Risks arising from contingent liabilities" in the "Report on 
opportunities and risks," which is contained in the combined management report. This report 
includes comments to the effect that potential liquidity shortages and the possible claiming of 
contingent liabilities represent a threat to the continued existence of the parent company and the 
Group. Furthermore, we refer to the fact that the ability of two subsidiaries to continue as a going 
concern is threatened by risks which are described in the "Report on opportunities and risks,* 
which is contained in the combined management report. 





Aurelius’ Filings and Subsidiaries’ Filings Do Not Reconcile  


Given our past success in identifying accounting irregularities in UK financial statements (see our Quindell 
report), we reviewed Aurelius’ UK subsidiaries’ local filings, and found the following differences between 
the local filings’ figures and Aurelius’ subsidiary-level figures6: 





 Aurelius’ 2015 annual report was signed by auditors on March 17, 2016.  
 Only 1 UK subsidiary, TFHC, among the 15 we reviewed had its financial statements signed by 


their respective auditors, by that date7.  
 These accounting irregularities we’ve detected between Aurelius’ UK subsidiaries’ local filings 


and Aurelius’ annual report validates the accounting irregularities we discussed earlier (as 
shown below):

Is Dirk Markus Both the CEO and CFO of Aurelius? 


Let’s suppose that Aurelius’ financial statements are materially inaccurate and misleading. Aside from the 
potential technical signs (as discussed in the prior section), what are some of the softer signs that would 
signal that something is amiss with Aurelius’ accounting? Gotham City Research believes that Aurelius 
offers the perfect conditions for suspect accounting – worthy of a novel – for the following reasons: 


 Aurelius has no independent CFO. In fact, Aurelius has had no independent CFO since 2012.  
 There is reason to believe Dirk is both CEO and CFO of Aurelius.  
 Dirk Markus CEO and CFO(?) lives in London, despite the fact Aurelius & its employees are based 


in Germany.  
 Aurelius’ auditor does not provide an unqualified audit opinion, which is unusual. 
 Aurelius’ Net Asset Value is unaudited. Aurelius does not measure and evaluate the performance 


of its investments on a fair value basis. Its NAV is “marked to model”, not “marked to market”. 
 Despite growing both in size and complexity over the last 8 years, Aurelius has not used a top tier 


auditor since 2009.   
 In 2009-2010, Aurelius changed its auditor from Deloitte and Touche to Susat & Partner (Later to 


merge with third-tier firm Warth & Klein). 
 Notably, the English version of Aurelius’ 2008 annual report does not include an Auditor’s Report, 


but the German version does. We have seen similar inconsistent disclosures in the case of Let’s 
Gowex, where the Spanish filings and English filings offered inconsistent information. 


 Dirk was responsible for finance and restructuring at Arques until 2005. One news source refers 
to Dirk as “CFO” of Arques. 


 The DPR carried out a review of Arques’ 2004 financial statements – Dirk Markus was still at 
Arques in 2004 – and determined nine accounting errors; BaFin asked Arques to publish the errors 
immediately. 


 Aurelius shares are quoted on Germany’s open market exchange, equivalent to the UK’s AIM, 
Spains’ MAB, and the US pink sheets/OTC, i.e. where there may be insufficient regulatory 
oversight. 
  


Aurelius’ has not had an Independent Chief Financial Officer since 2010 


Aurelius had a CFO up to 2012, named Ulrich Radlmayr. Aurelius has not replaced him since 2012. Rather, 
the company “divided the responsibility among three executive board members” according to its AR 20121:  


For personal reasons Ulrich Radlmayr did not renew his Executive Board contract that expired on 
30 June 2012. His areas of responsibility were divided among the remaining three Executive Board 
members. 
 


Prior to joining Aurelius as CFO, Radlmayr graduated from law school2 and practiced law; it is not clear 
whether or how he had the right skills or qualifications to oversee financial reporting, accounting, and/or 
audit of Aurelius (or any company).
Page 14 of 68 
 


Even more peculiar, Radlmayr was concurrently a partner at a law firm while CFO at Aurelius:3  





Brokerage house Hauck & Aufhauser actually refers to Dirk Markus as Aurelius’ CEO and CFO:4  





Weak – maybe compromised (or non-existent) – internal controls?  


According to an article titled Holding CEO and CFO Roles Is a Tightrope Act, companies should not have its 
CEOs hold the role of the CFO at the same time: 


The CEO & CFO roles are definitely distinct, so holding one would likely make a person ineffective 
in the other. “The CEO’s job is to drive the business forward,” Reiner says. “They’re either very 
sales-oriented or operations-oriented, depending on the nature of the business.” Someone with a 
CEO mindset & responsibilities would likely miss some of the details on the financial side. 


From a governance perspective, having one person play both roles will also “shortcut” the 
decision-making process, Reiner says. In addition, internal controls would likely be weaker5. 


Aurelius uses lower-tier auditors:  


One would think that without a fully dedicated CFO, that at least Aurelius would spend some money to 
hire a substantial auditor. Rather, Aurelius uses the 10th largest auditor in Germany, Wart & Klein Grant 
Thornton.  In fact, Aurelius has not used a top-tier auditor since 20096:
Page 15 of 68 
 





Aurelius has not had a top-tier auditor since 2009, despite growing in size and complexity since then 


In 2010 Aurelius changed auditors from Deloitte & Touche GmBH to SUSAT & Partner. Aurelius has not 
had a top tier auditor since 2009, despite its apparent growth as a company.  





The company did not provide an Independent Auditor’s Report in its AR 2009 (English version)  


The English versions of the AR 2008 and AR 2010 clearly provide an auditor’s report; the AR 2009 in 
English does not provide an auditor’s report:7

Aurelius’ Audit Opinion is Qualified 


Aurelius’ auditors pointed out that Aurelius did not disclose information required by IFRS standards, and 
therefore issued a qualified – as opposed to the typical unqualified – audit opinion9: 


Excerpt from Auditor’s report (page 237 of AR 2015): 


With the exception of the following qualifications, our audit has not led to any reservations: In the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements, the disclosures required under IFRS 3.59 ff. and IFRS 
8.23 with respect to the nature and financial effects of business combinations are not presented or not 
shown separately and the material non-cash items of income are not disclosed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements for each reportable segment. 





Aurelius refuses to provide disclosures per IFRS 3.59 as it can lead to “economic disadvantages” 


Aurelius’ auditors pointed out that Aurelius did not disclose information required by IFRS standards, and 
a footnote from Aurelius’ AR 2015 (page 224) states that Aurelius chooses not to provide disclosures 
related to “bargain purchases” (i.e. negative goodwill), “because it believes that they can lead to economic 
disadvantages for future company acquisitions or company sales”10: 





But the disclosures set by IFRS 3.59 seem both non-onerous and particularly important for the purpose of 
evaluating Aurelius’ financial condition11:  





We believe that the specific disclosures required to meet the above requirements are critical to assessing, 
understanding, and monitoring Aurelius’ financial condition. Without these disclosures, investors are left 
to simply trust management12:
Page 18 of 68
Page 19 of 68 
 


Aurelius withholds basic disclosures even as smaller peer Bavaria Industries AG provides clearer ones 


Aurelius’ disclosures do not seem consistent with other industry operators’ disclosures. For example, in 
the case of Bavaria Industries AG, Bavaria discloses a very clear EBIT before the dissolution of negative 
goodwill. Furthermore, Bavaria continues with the disclosure of how much profits are derived from 
ordinary operations, and how much is derived from extraordinary sources of income:13

Aurelius lists its stock on the “Freiverkehr”: perhaps to avoid regulatory or legal scrutiny?  


Although Aurelius is large enough to justify listing its shares in regulated exchanges, the company chooses 
to list its stock on the “Freiverkehr”, that is the “Open Market”. Based on our review of the Freiverkehr, it 
reminds us of:  


 The AIM in the UK (where Quindell was listed). 
 MAB in Spain (where Gowex was listed). 
 OTC/Pink in the US (where many stock frauds are listed). 


Perhaps more notably, Aurelius actually aimed for this less transparent listing in 2012, when it moved 
from Frankfurt to the Freiverkehr14. In light of all the problems we’ve identified in this report (and the 
red flags discussed in this section specifically), we feel that the company may avoid a traditional share 
listing, so that it can avoid the spotlight.  





CEO Dirk Markus lives in London but Aurelius is based in Germany 


Seeing that Aurelius is more of a people-intensive business versus a capital-intensive one (e.g. industrial 
companies), this arrangement whereby the Founder/CEO/MaybeCFO Dirk Markus lives in London while 
Aurelius’ employees are based in Germany, seems like a recipe for a future Harvard Business School case 
study – and not for good reasons:15

Does Aurelius deliberately hide and destroy unfavorable press releases from the past?  


Gotham City Research discovered Aurelius had a prior website, that was deleted and replaced by the 
current website. Under the current website, some of the older press releases seem to have been 
deleted. Thanks to the Wayback Machine, we reviewed the differences between the old Aurelius 
website and the current version. We highlight the following: 


 
 Aurelius only includes news starting from 2008, despite quoting its shares since 2006. We 


were unable to find Aurelius press releases that pre-date on its current website.  
 Aurelius seems to have removed unflattering press releases. We were unable to locate the 


following Aurelius press releases on its current website (they are available via the wayback 
machine archives):16 


 5.09.2008AURELIUS participates in Arques Industries

Does a “good home for companies” lead to 15 insolvencies? 


How do Aurelius and CEO Dirk Markus manage to:  


 Present itself Aurelius as a “good home for companies” (Berenberg Bank claims that only four 
portfolio companies have gone out of business)1. 


 Claim: “we run a hospital for sick businesses where we help to cure them.”2 


Even as: 


 15 out of 26 of Aurelius’ former portfolio companies entered into insolvency soon after Aurelius 
sold them to suspicious buyers, some whom seem to have direct ties with Aurelius. 


 Aurelius seems to under-invest in its portfolio companies.  
 Aurelius has been accused of siphoning funds out of its portfolio companies.3 


The Aurelius Business model: Does Aurelius make money at the expense of its portfolio companies 
employees, pensions, etc? Is Aurelius the next Arques or Philip Green BHS? In this section we show why 
Gotham City Research believes Aurelius is not a “good home for companies”. 


On one hand Aurelius AG frequently claims to be a “Good Home for Companies”4: 








In fact, citing how effective Aurelius is purported to be, Berenberg Bank, in a research note dated October 
2016 claims5:  


“Aurelius and its team of turnaround specialists are very experienced and have a long-term 
track record. Since inception of the company, only four portfolio companies have gone out of 
business” – Berenberg Bank 





Insolvency is the rule, not the exception  


Most of Aurelius’ subsidiaries bankrupt after Aurelius sells them to buyers, many who seem tied to AR4:6  





We don’t believe that a “good home for companies” would lead to such a high percentage of 
insolvencies.

Of the 15 former Aurelius subsidiaries that became insolvent, the following were sold to dubious buyers 
and/or buyers that appear connected to Aurelius7: 





The above-mentioned buyers/beneficiaries include: 


 Former and/or current directors of Aurelius’ subsidiaries; 
 Persons and/or entities with other ties to Aurelius; and 
 Dubious entities and persons. 


Some of the above mentioned buyers or their beneficiaries seem to be related parties as defined below8:  





Why would Aurelius sell to related or closely connected parties or other dubious buyers? More likely 
than not, Aurelius sells subsidiaries to such buyers so that Aurelius can technically claim that their 
portfolio companies did not enter into insolvency under Aurelius’ ownership. 





We find additional evidence that Aurelius obfuscates the nature of its business transactions, by examining 
a more recent transaction, involving Getronics-IDS.

Aurelius claimed recently to have sold Getronics Group to a “strategic investor” SEP9: 


“On October 5, 2016 Getronics Group, a subsidiary of Aurelius, sold its German subsidiary 
Getronics-IDS to the Strategic Investor SEP as part of its efforts to sharpen its focus. Getronics-IDS 
generates revenues of around EUR 90 million per year. The parties have agreed to keep silent 
about the purchase price.” 


Financial markets participants tend to use the term “strategic investor” to refer to investors that are 
operating companies – such as a Coca Cola, Bayer, etc. – as opposed to investment companies, such as 
KKR, Blackstone, etc. 


SEP does not appear to be a “strategic investor” – in fact, that representation seems quite deceptive: 


 The exact name of the acquiring entity – which Aurelius did not provide – is SEP Holding 7 Ltd.10 
 SEP was incorporated on 12th August 2016 –  a little over 1 months before this transaction.11 
 The company is based in 37 Rhewl Lane, Gobowen, Oswestry, Shropshire, UK, Post Code: SY10 


7XA. Based on satellite images, the “office” looks like a rural village 


SEP Holding 7 Ltd – Location seems more like a scene from “The Hobbit” than the home of a strategic 
investor12
Page 27 of 68 
 


SEP and Aurelius are connected through Rick Chilvers and Sven Stoecker: 


 The two officers of “strategic investor SEP” are Rick Chilvers and Martin Wildman13 
 Sven Stoecker was/is a managing director Aurelius’ subsidiaries14: 


 Managing director of Getronics IDS Gmbh since Aug 2016 
 Managing director of brightONE Consulting Gmbh since Jul 2016 
 Managing director of BrightONE GMBH since Jun 2016 


 SEP’s Rick Chilver and Sven Stoecker are long-time friends (+16 years)15 





Does Aurelius change the names of its failing/failed entities to obfuscate poorly performing subsidiaries? 


Aurelius refers to itself as a “good home for companies” even though its subsidiaries bankrupt at a ~60% 
rate after they are sold. Aurelius sells to suspect buyers, referring to them as “strategic investors.”  


There is little to no mention of bankruptcies in Aurelius’ filings, a curiosity given that most of its portfolio 
companies enter insolvency after they are sold. Aurelius may frequently change the name of its poorly 
performing subsidiaries to conceal failure. Take for example, Blaupunkt Technology16:

Aurelius presents itself as an investment firm, with a “long-term investment horizon”17: 





Aurelius’s claims of “operational focus” & “long-term investment horizon” seem contradicted by its claim 
of “fast recovery of investment”, implying they recoup 50% of their initial capital within 1 year18:  








Yet Aurelius under-invests in its portfolio companies: Aurelius seems like terrible home for companies 


Aurelius’ cumulative capital expenditures lag far behind cumulative depreciation & amortization:19 





In fact, if Aurelius were siphoning off cash and other resources from its portfolio companies – resources 
that were intended to be used to simply maintain the businesses – then the reality would be far worse 
than presented in the table above. Not only would Aurelius be insufficiently spending money on capital 
expenditures, it would be removing muscle tissue from the bone – rather than trimming fat – from its 
portfolio companies.

Aurelius’ Business: a publicly-traded version of Philip Green?  


How does Aurelius manage to:  


 Present itself as a “good home for companies” (Berenberg Bank claims that only four portfolio 
companies have gone out of business). 


 Claim: “we run a hospital for sick businesses where we help to cure them.” 
 Claim operating profits from portfolio companies as a source of “value creation” 
 Pay dividends, buyback shares, and reward its management team handsomely. 


Even as: 


 15 out of 26 of Aurelius’ former portfolio companies entered insolvency soon after Aurelius sold 
them to suspicious buyers (some resembling undisclosed related parties). 


 Over 100% of Aurelius’ net profits originates from ‘other income’; other income is typically 
considered non-operating income.  


 Aurelius’ subsidiaries cumulatively generated 2012-2015 of -€5 million net losses per note 75. 
 Over 100% of Aurelius’ 2015 net profits are non-cash income, and working capital and/or other 


non-recurring sources of cash account for more than 100% of 2015 cash flow from operations. 
 Aurelius 2015 cash flow from operations generated -€24 million in outflows, before changes in 


working capital. 
 Aurelius issued EUR 166 million convertible debt even as management quietly received EUR 169 


million of proceeds from the sale of least 40% of their stake in Aurelius’ shares.  





Based on the above, Gotham City Research believes that asset stripping, NOT reaping nor patiently 
growing its subsidiaries’ operating profits, is a key value driver of Aurelius’ business, as it was for Sir Philip 
Green (i.e. his ownership of BHS):1 





Philip Green’s return on his BHS investment looked good…until it didn’t. Aurelius’ business & its “return 
multiples” look good as well…before calculating the true risks/liabilities. We first examine Aurelius’ true 
business model, contrary to how the company presents it; then we will examine the risks.

Aurelius presents its business model in the following manner: 


 Note how Aurelius refers to ‘operating profits from portfolio’ as if it had a stable base of portfolio 
companies with recurring profits (why else mention “DCF” below)2 








Aurelius claims that operating profits from portfolio is a value driver; however the sum of the 
subsidiaries’ profits – as disclosed in the notes to Aurelius’ Annual Report – come up as losses!3 





If Aurelius’ actually reports losses from its subsidiaries, how does it generate income? 


Other income accounts for over 100% of net income; other income is not considered operating income 


How does Aurelius claim to generate operating income from its portfolio companies, when more than 
100% of Aurelius’ earnings originate from “other income”?4

Page 31 of 68 
 





Contrary to how Aurelius presents its value drivers, other income – according to all definitions we 
reviewed – is considered income from non-operating activities5: 


1. Income derived from transactions not involved in daily operations of a business.   
2. Income for a company that comes from anything other than its ordinary operations.  





Aurelius’ Other income consists mostly of negative goodwill, deconsolidations, and other income:6
Page 32 of 68 
 


 Most of other income – income from negative goodwill, deconsolidations, and discontinued 
operations –  are typically considered non-operating and non-recurring in nature. 


Income from Negative goodwill has not proven to be a sustainable driver of value, as the Arques and 
BHS cases show. 


Arques’ negative goodwill income vanished after 2008, suggesting sustained negative goodwill income 
might is not a sustainable driver of income for Aurelius:7 





Negative Goodwill is a rare Phenomenon: Arques (and Aurelius) are statistical outliers among outliers 


We were unable to find any company more similar to Aurelius than Arques. Among listed companies in 
Germany, Arques accounted for 41% of all negative goodwill transactions, from 2005-2008, according to 
Corporate Ownership & Control/Volume 12, Issue 2, Winter 2016 – Frequency of and Reasons for Bargain 
Purchases – Evidence from Germany):8 





Seeing that Aurelius’ recent negative goodwill levels, and rapid rise, mirror Arques, we deduce (coupled 
with Dirk Markus’ involvement with both Arques and Aurelius) therefore, that the Arques case is the 
correct comparison. 


Gotham City Research’s thoughts on Aurelius’ Negative goodwill (bargain purchase)  


The ability to regularly report negative goodwill income implies one of the following or their combination: 


a) The management has exceptional ability to find and acquire assets below their fair value; 
b) Transactions are not conducted on an arms-lengths basis; 
c) Inappropriate valuation of assets and/or liabilities at point of acquisition. 
d) Negative goodwill may not account for future risks  


In our view if a) were true, sellers to Aurelius at some point would adjust their prices upwards, or new 
buyers would emerge as such arbitrage opportunity would be eliminated for Aurelius, given that it is a 
public company and provides a lot of information on its activities. However, looking at the size and 
dynamics of negative goodwill income in recent years this “arbitrage opportunity” not only has not been 
closing, but on the contrary – it has been widening, which generally contradicts to the principles of market 
economy. Also, b) and c) and d) suggest that the negative goodwill accounting masks the hidden buildup 
of risk. Thus some combination of b) and c) seems more likely.

How exactly Does Aurelius Make Money?  - CEO Dirk Markus’ View 


On one hand, you have CEO Dirk Markus who claims Aurelius is like a hospital for sick businesses:9  


We run a hospital for sick businesses where we help to cure them. And like in a real-world hospital 
once in a while a patient might die. That is normally not the doctor's or our fault but that it’s the 
prior condition of the patient that causes that. 





On the other hand, Aurelius has been accused – and in some cases, found guilty of – illegal or improper 
business conduct, including illegally withdrawing money, fraud related to non-payment of suppliers, etc.10  


Aurelius has been ruled guilty in the following cases: 


 Einhorn – Germany’s Supreme Court ruled that Aurelius illegally withdrew funds from Einhorn, 
a former portfolio company. 


 EDS Group – Aurelius found guilty of tort in French courts for its improper management of 
the EDS Group  


Open cases: 


 MS Deutschland – Aurelius faces a EUR 50 million claim that the company improperly 
withdrew cash from the proceeds of a bond issuance.   


 Mode & Preis – The Mannheim state prosecutor has charged M&P’s management with 11 
counts of fraud (non-payment of suppliers).   


Are these judgments and accusations isolated case? Or are these & similar behaviors – raiding pension 
funds, siphoning cash, and/or asset stripping from its portfolio companies – a core part of Aurelius’ DNA?  





How exactly Does Aurelius Make Money?  - Gotham City Research’s view 


We believe Dirk Markus’ characterization of Aurelius’ business is incorrect for the following reasons: 


 “once in a while a patient might die” – actually, nearly 60% die (see prior section). 
 “We help to cure them” – If a real-world hospital and doctors were extracting non-vital organs 


from its patients, then selling them for profit, would they be “helping to cure” its patients? 
 “normally not the doctor's or our fault but that it’s the prior condition of the patient that causes 


that.” – If a real-world hospital and doctors were extracting non-vital organs from its patients, 
selling the organs for profit, released its patients, and 60% of its patients shortly thereafter die 
from organ failure…who would be at fault?  





We illustrate what we believe to be a critical (but not only) driver of Aurelius’ business in the next page 
with a “theoretical example” of how Aurelius makes money.
Page 34 of 68 
 


How exactly does Aurelius make money? – Theoretical Example 


1. Investment firm (“SlaughterCo”) buys a loss-making company (“SheepCo”) for some token 
amount, EUR 1 million. 


2. The old owner of SheepCo leaves EUR 50 million in cash on the balance sheet; the cash is intended 
to fund SheepCo’s pension fund obligations of EUR 50 million. SlaughterCo books “negative 
goodwill” income, a non-cash source of income. 


3. SlaughterCo extracts EUR 50 million out of SheepCo over 3 years, under the guise of “dividends”, 
“consulting fees”, “restructuring fees”, etc. SlaughterCo books positive cash flow from these 
extractions, even as SheepCo’s profits may be non-existent, declining, or even losses. 


4. Meanwhile the pension fund obligations remain with SheepCo and SheepCo is on the verge of 
bankruptcy.  


5. Seeing that there are no resources left for SlaughterCo to extract from SheepCo, SlaughterCo sells 
SheepCo to a friend for EURO 1. 


6. SheepCo quietly files for bankruptcy under SlaughterCo’s friend. SlaughterCo can technically claim 
that SheepCo did not go bankrupt under its ownership. 


7. A few years later, UK Parliament launches an investigation into SheepCo’s failure and seeks EUR 
50-150 million from SlaughterCo. 


If Aurelius were to generate cash flow from asset stripping, pension raiding, and/or siphoning its 
subsidiaries, what would Aurelius’ cash flow statement look like? 


Aurelius’ 2015 cash flow from operating activities is actually negative before changes in working capital 


If Aurelius were to generate cash from stripping its subsidiaries, this is exactly what we expect to Aurelius’ 
cash flow statement should look like:11 


 2015 Operating cash flow is negative before working capital adjustments; 
 Working capital capital e.g. trade receivables and other liabilities, inventories, and ‘other items of 


the Statement of Financial Position’ are the sources of cash.
Page 35 of 68 
 


Aurelius is Unique (unless compared against Arques and Philip Green BHS): 


While raiding a pension fund or overstating assets is not unheard of in the private equity world,12 





Aurelius appears unusual when compared against other investment firms (except when compared against 
Arques or Philip Green BHS)13: 


 Changes in working capital as a share of revenues is much larger for Aurelius, than for peers. 








 Other income both as a (1) share of Revenue and (2) Net income is much larger for Aurelius than 
other, more traditional peers.

Aurelius’ Total Returns: Profits before the bad stuff? 


Anatomy of a Blowup: The returns looked great, ex ante 


In 2000, Sir Philip Green purchased BHS for GBP 200 million. In subsequent years, Green extracted GBP 
580 million out of BHS, in the form of dividends, rental payments and interest on loans1, just as we believe 
Arques and Aurelius have with their portfolio companies.  


Philip Green’s returns on his initial investment looked great – nearly 2x return on his investment – ignoring 
ethical, legal, and risk-related consideration. 


In early 2015, Philip Green sold BHS for just £1. Within months, BHS filed for bankruptcy. Later in 2015 
Members of Parliament opened an investigation into Philip Green. As of early 2017, Philip Green agreed 
to pay £365 million to settle the investigation.  


Philip Green’s 2x return on investment, declined to nearly zero. Here is his pro forma payoff diagram: 





Aurelius’ return profile look great…before the risks are considered or incurred. 


Aurelius’ shares (including dividends) have generated +41% annualized returns since 2006:2 





Warren Buffett – one of the greatest long term investors in the world – has generated over 20% annualized 
returns over several decades, through his Berkshire Hathaway vehicle. Notably, Berkshire’s annualized 
share price growth has been remarkably consistent with its annualized growth in book value per share. In 
contrast, Aurelius’ annualized book value per share growth rate is only a tiny fraction of its annualized 
share growth rate. Unsurprisingly, brokerage houses who cover AR4 seem to require “new paradigms” to 
valuation (e.g., applying a multiple on Aurelius’ cash balance3) to justify Aurelius’ stock price.

Aurelius’ Claimed Total Return Multiples: Profits before Costs (?) 


On one hand, Aurelius boasts of a 9x total return multiple on its portfolio companies’ exits, and implies 
that the company recoups 50% of any initial outlays of cash within one year:4 








Based on our careful examination of Aurelius’ accounting, its business, its peers, and management 
comments, Aurelius reminds us of an insurance company that boasts of its revenues – gross written 
premiums – without mentioning the risk that the insurer needs to pay out to policy holders in the event 
of some catastrophic event for the policyholders (i.e. an insurable event). Take for example: 


The “Total return” on Wellman does not reflect the risk of a contingent liability 


In 2011 Aurelius sold Wellman – Aurelius claims a total return of EUR 29.33 million – or 6.8x total return 
multiple on ‘peak exposure’ of EUR 4.3 million.   


Gotham City Research believes that Aurelius’ representation of its ‘total return’ on its Wellman dealings 
omits EUR 22 million contingent liability that Aurelius is the sole obligator of. These contingent liabilities 
were initially held by Residuum Beteiligungs GmbH, formerly Wellman-related entities, that became 
retroactively merged into Aurelius. Despite investors’ and/or brokers beliefs to the contrary, 
Wellman/Residuum is an example of a past portfolio company whereby Aurelius is the sole obligator of 
its contingent liabilities.
Page 38 of 68 
 


Aurelius sold Wellman to Indorama, and retained some Wellman related entities on their books (re-
naming them ‘Residuum’):5 








In 2012 Residuum was retroactively merged into Aurelius AG. Aurelius AG became “sole obligated party” 
under the guarantees issues previously by Residuum, as shown below:6
Page 39 of 68 
 


Residuum Ltd remained consolidated through 2013 by Aurelius:7 





In AR 2015 A still discloses contingent liabilities related to Wellman, sold in 2011:8 








Contingent liabilities matter for reasons beyond the Wellman/Residuum example 


 Recall the Contingent liabilities accounting irregularities discussed earlier (i.e. they may be 
understated by 46%)9  





 Arques’ failure and its auditor’s escalating disclosure regarding the risks that contingent liabilities 
posted on Arques’ going concern from pre 2007 to 2009. From a causation perspective, there is 
precedent for failure or near-failure as a result of contingent liability risk. 


 There may be other Residuum/Wellman-like situations.

What investors and/or brokers believe about Aurelius’ liability 


According to Commerzbank diagram shown below, Aurelius SE Co. KGaA does not have liabilities, 
guarantees to portfolio companies:10 





 
The Commerzbank research report continues by claims that “the risk is limited EUR 25,000.   


 
The Aurelius Group is a holding company with a multi-level structure. The operating subsidiaries are 
held by intermediate companies below the level of the parent company. This structure effectively 
contains the risks of the individual operating companies. Aurelius is a public limited liability company 
regulated under European law managed by the executive board, which would personally act as liable 
general partner. 
 
When acquiring a company, Aurelius establishes a holding company as a special investment vehicle set 
up as a GmbH in Germany, which minimises the risk for Aurelius if something goes wrong with the 
acquired company. In the event of a problem, the risk is limited to €25,000 and the only significant 
loss to Aurelius comes from the loss of what they paid for the company.  
 
Since the average purchase price paid by Aurelius is only €10m against an equity position of €537m at 
year-end 2015, the risk from any one investment is minimal. Some 10% of deals Aurelius makes even 
include an added cash payment from a vendor who is interested in a professional company turning the 
distressed company around. The debt in the balance sheet is mostly held at the individual company level 
and is non-recourse to Aurelius. Aurelius is able to put an acquired company into bankruptcy or 
liquidation with no impairment to the holding 
company where most of the cash is held. 
 
In order to prevent insolvency of the holding company, Aurelius does not sign a profit-and-loss transfer 
agreement, or cash-pooling-contract, with its subsidiaries. 


The Wellman/Residuum situation described earlier seems to contradict the above claims, as Aurelius 
sold Wellman, but Residuum – the liability related to Wellman – remains with Aurelius.

The Philip Green BHS Risk: What happens if the chickens come home to roost? 
 
Below, as we show in red, Aurelius has made money from companies that later became Insolvent:11 


 
EDS Group = Quelle  


 
Philip Green made money from BHS, the company later became Insolvent, and Philip Green had to pay 
back nearly all his profits extracted from BHS:12 








 
Did Aurelius make money at the expense of Scherpe, EDS Group WVC, KTD Aythea, Mode & Preis, 
Channel21, BCA, Sit-up – and these companies’ employees, creditors, suppliers, and other stakeholders? 
 
We ask these questions because, Philip Green was accused of extracting money out of BHS, and BHS 
encountered problems after Philip Green sold BHS. Philip Green repaid nearly all his BHS profits, many 
years after he extracted those funds out of BHS. This seems a real risk – more a matter when versus 
whether – when it comes to Aurelius’ business.

Aurelius and evidence of covering its tracks: What does Aurelius have to hide? 


Gotham City Research discovered Aurelius had a prior website, that was deleted and replaced by the 
current website. Under the current website, some of the older press releases seem to have been 
deleted. Thanks to the Wayback Machine, we reviewed the differences between the press releases 
Aurelius reveals to the world today, and the press releases Aurelius chooses to hide:13 


 
 Judging by the press-release section of the old website, it operated until May 2014.   
 In the new website, Aurelius only includes news starting from 2008. Older news is no longer 


available on the website. 
 The sale of Grillo to Nettle (dated 19 Sep 2007) and other news stories involving Aurelius’ less 


successful deals, may interest current shareholders. 
 


In addition to pre-2008 articles being unavailable on Aurelius’ current website, some press 
releases from 2008-2010 were excluded from the current website as well. Based on what was 
excluded, it’s hard not to conclude that Aurelius hand selected these to hide. 


We have listed the press releases we found most prominent, below:  


 5.09.2008AURELIUS participates in Arques Industries  
 11.03.2008Primondo sells Spezialversandhaus Mode & Preis to AURELIUS 
 10.01.2008Joint press release of Balda AG, KS Plastic Solutions GmbH and AURELIUS AG

Net Asset Value: is AR4 worth no more than €8.56 per share? 


Aurelius’ Unaudited Net Asset Value: Garbage In, Garbage Out? 


Gotham City Research believed Aurelius’ negative goodwill-related accounting practices were its most 
peculiar…until we examined Aurelius’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”). Given that Aurelius’ portfolio companies 
are described by Dirk Markus as “sick businesses” that they are seeking to cure, and most of Aurelius’ 
historical subsidiaries entered into insolvency after Aurelius sold them, we believe that a discounted cash 
flow approach to NAV is inappropriate.  


Based on our calculations, EUR 11-12 per share is a more realistic estimate of Aurelius’ NAV (see the 
appendix for more details), not the EUR 43 per share unaudited NAV Aurelius provides. The following 
considerations lead us to be skeptical of Aurelius’ NAV and shape our approach:  


 We calculate that the “organic growth” of Aurelius’ NAV components is -4.4% (i.e. the NAV 
components as of September 2016 that have remained on the portfolio since December 2014 
have declined in value by -4.4% since December 2014). 


 We estimate that Aurelius’ NAV has been artificially boosted 33%+ by a reduction (implemented 
effective the 2015AR) in its discount rate used to calculate NAV from 5.7%-11.9% to 4.2%-9.3%. 


 Discount rate seems low for companies that even Dirk acknowledges are “sick patients”. 
Venture and distressed companies receive higher discount rates for good reasons. 


 Aurelius provides an NAV that is not audited by its auditor; Aurelius’ unaudited NAV does not 
conform to fair value reporting requirements. 


 Aurelius’s NAV is almost entirely based on DCFs which seems dubious for valuing 
distressed/near-bankrupt companies. We think the approach is particularly strange considering 
Aurelius’ cash flows seem highly dependent on working capital (as discussed earlier).  


 Aurelius does not factor in an illiquidity discount it its NAV components, which in practice would 
reduce their marked to model values by 20%-30%.    


Gotham City Research believes AR4 is worth no more than €8.56 per share for the following reasons: 


 We believe Aurelius’ business model is not sustainable in the long-term. As a result, we believe 
shares will follow a path not dissimilar to Arques AG, Philip Green BHS. 


 Therefore, we believe AR4’s share price will converge to its tangible book value per share less 
contingent liabilities (don’t forget, book value per share has only grown a paltry 4% per annum 
versus 40%+ per annum in its share price), implying -80-90% downside from currentl levels.  


 The risks discussed earlier in this report –e.g., risk related to Aurelius’ suspect accounting, 
business model, etc – serve as the basis of our opinion. 


 Change in corporate structure1 – Aurelius recently changed its legal form into a partnership 
limited by shares; this change allows management to preserve their control even if they elect to 
sell all their remaining shares (if they have any). As such, we believe AR4 shares merit a corporate 
governance discount consistent with non-voting right share classes.

Gotham City Research Believes Aurelius’ Q3 2016 NAV is closer to €8.5 per share, not €43.4 per share2 











We provide the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate the above figures in the Appendix.

Aurelius’ NAV components that have remained in the portfolio since December 2014 -4.4%  


The NAV components below denoted in white have remained in Aurelius’ portfolio since 2014. We 
estimate the weighted-average rate of decline of those components, as of September 2016 to be -4.8%:3 





The above calculation seems to suggest that Aurelius has not been successful at operationally improving 
the value of these companies. We believe it may also suggest: 


a) The portfolio companies themselves were selling off assets (which would undermine claims that 
portfolio companies are developed); 


b) Aurelius’s portfolio companies have lost value (among those remaining in the portfolio since 
2014); 


c) Previous NAV was overstated 
 


Because the above methodology only applies to the components that meet the duration criterion, the 
above analysis is not fully conclusive. However, none of the above scenarios seems to validate Aurelius’ 
long-term viability. Therefore, the whole premise of a DCF-based NAV seems dubious.

Reductions in the Discount Rate Artificially boost NAV – Aurelius’ NAV may be boosted 33%+  


In Aurelius’ AR 2015, the company reduced the discount rates used to calculate NAV from 5.7%-11.9% to 
4.2%-9.3% or by 1.8% on average compared to the end of H1 2015. The reduction in discount rates may 
have boosted NAV by over 33%:  





We arrive at our 33% boost to NAV by calculating what a change in the above-mentioned discount rates 
will have on a stream of EUR 100 cash flows, growing at the growth rate Aurelius’ provides for its NAV DCF 
disclosures: 








We incorporated Aurelius’ comments about DCF assumptions:4 





2014 


“The valuation is carried out using a discounted cash flow model taking into account the budgets of the 
Group companies for the next three years (2015-2017). The growth rates assumed for this detailed 
planning period have been set uniformly at a conservative 0.5 percent. The weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC) used for the underlying discounting rates was calculated as of December 2014 on the basis 
of individual peer groups, totaling between 5.7 and 11.9 percent.”5

Aurelius’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) is an unaudited NAV 


Aurelius elects not to comply with the conditions set out in IFRS10.27; that is, Aurelius elects not to be 
treated as an “investment entity.” Consequently, Aurelius’ investments are not measured on fair-value 
basis, viz., its NAV is not audited:6  





Aurelius clearly places its Net Asset Value section, in the table of contents of its AR 2015, before the 
sections that are audited:7
Page 48 of 68 
 


Aurelius’ auditor specifies which statements they audited (we don’t see “We have audited NAV”):8
Page 49 of 68 
 


Aurelius’ NAV calculation is marked-to-model, a 20%-30% Illiquidity discount seems warranted 


Given that Aurelius’ unaudited NAV is DCF-based, not fair value-based, an illiquidity discount should be 
applied to simulate what would happen if Aurelius had to liquidate its stakes.  Based on Aswath 
Damodaran’s comments below, it seems Aurelius’ assets may require discounts of at least 30%:9

Net Asset Value Calculation 


 
Gotham City Research believes that valuing Aurelius’ companies on a DCF “going concern” basis seems 
inappropriate given (I) how many subsidiaries have historically entered insolvency (after Aurelius sells 
them). And (II) Aurelius’ cash flow seems sourced largely from working capital and/or sale of non current 
asets. Additionally, the applicable discount rates for start-ups and distressed companies are rightfully very 
high (multiples higher than the ones Aurelius uses), leading to a risk of “garbage in, garbage out” with 
DCFs of high risk companies.  
 
We nevertheless sought to estimate Aurelius’ unaudited NAV components and calculate what a more 
realistic, fair-value oriented NAV might look like. Our NAV calculation included the following assumptions: 
 
Key Assumptions: 
 


1. Earnings from local filings – We obtained earnings figures from the local filings. Most filings were for 
the fiscal year 2015; some were for 2014/2013 (as filing requirements vary by jurisdiction). Based on our 
evaluation of each subsidiaries’ filing, we made an assessment of what normalized earnings might look 
like, for the purpose of valuing each subsidiary.  


2. Loss-making companies – Companies with a track record of loss making do not merit NAVs beyond 
token sums. Based on our assessment of the marketplace. If Aurelius seeks “bargain purchases” we 
assume market participants are as well.  


3. Private market-oriented multiples – We arrived at implied deal/value multiple(s) based on Aurelius’ 
more/most successful exits, and applied this against earnings per local filings.  We felt that this approach 
was appropriate, as companies that truly turn might be recognized in the market place. 


4. Liquidity discount –In some cases where we felt it was appropriate, we applied a liquidity discount, in 
order to simulate realistic market conditions.  


5. Sum of the Parts versus Combined NAV Approaches – We (i) estimated NAV based on the individual 
NAVs of Aurelius’ companies and then (ii) estimated a NAV that treated the sum of the individual 
companies’ earnings as if it were company. Our NAV is result of this blended approach.  


6. Risk-adjustment factor – Given some of the highly controversial allegations (and actions) against 
Aurelius and/or its portfolio companies, as well as against Arques, Philip Green / BHS,  we applied a risk 
adjustment factor to quantify this effect. We were conservative and assumed the deduction should not 
exceed contingent liabilities.

Allegations against Aurelius’ Business Model  





1. In its article about Aurelius German newspaper Handelsblatt mentions that according to 
rumours real business model of Aurelius is squeezing cash out of the acquired companies. 


2. Source: http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/management/aurelius-ein-mann-fuer-die-
schwierigen-faelle/3011448.html  


3. “If a company no longer has a future, the modern pirates of the economy come into play: 
Restructuring companies such as Aurelius, Bavaria or Arques are entering, rebuilding and 
slaughtering. In the end, some companies are left with nothing” Capital magazine (dated August 
2009), published an article on A and its peers SOURCE: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20120123121337/http://www.capital.de/div/100023620.html  


4. This article further supports our thesis that Aurelius acts as a liquidator (at least quite often) at 
the expense of creditors (translation from French). http://www.leparisien.fr/orleans-
