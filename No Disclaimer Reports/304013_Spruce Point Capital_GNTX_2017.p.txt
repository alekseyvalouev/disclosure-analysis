About Spruce Point Capital Management


Spruce Point Capital Is An Industry Recognized Research Activist Investment Firm Founded In 2009


• Founded by Ben Axler, a former investment banker with 16 years experience on Wall Street


• Ranked the #1 Short-Seller in the world by Sumzero after a comprehensive study of 12,000 analyst recommendations dating 
back to 2008 (March 2015)


• Ranked the #13 Most Influential FinTweeter on Twitter according to Sentieo analysis (Dec 2016)


Track Record of Identifying Financial Schemes In The Auto Sector


* Reported produced by Prescience Point of which Spruce Point’s founder was a contributing author
Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Short-selling involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of infinite loss potential. Please see Full Legal Disclaimer at the front of the presentation.


Report Date 1/15/14 (Prescience Point)* 7/13/17


Company Promotion Best of breed recycled auto part distributor 
capable of effecting a roll-up strategy and producing consistent 


double digit revenue and EPS growth


Best of breed mirror “technology” company with world-leading 
gross margins capable of consistent double digit growth, achieving 


90% market share, and effecting shareholder friendly policies


Our Criticism LKQ is an ineffective roll-up by a management team with a 
history of financial failure (Waste Management / Discovery 


Zone). LKQ is caught in a gross margin squeeze being masked 
by relentless acquisitions, and aggressive inventory accounting 


open to significant management judgement. 
Its move to Europe is an implicit acknowledgement of waning 


domestic growth


Gross margins likely overstated by 2x through inventory and capex
overstatement. CEO/Founder has stacked the Board with former 
insiders, internally promoted finance/accounting individuals, and 


former external auditor as Audit Committee chair to prevent 
detection of the financial scheme. Product test and newly released 
FOIA evidence exposes Gentex’s misstatements. Dividend growth is 
substantially below potential (if you believe the financials) and the 


share repurchases are mostly to offset dilution


Successful Outcome Gross margins have declined from over 47% to 39%
The Company’s successive acquisition in Europe and 


domestically have failed to boost its share price. LKQ’s 
multiples have contracted significantly. Its CFO was replaced 
(Feb 2015) and its CEO recently stepped down (March 2017)

Spruce Point “Strong Sell” Opinion On Gentex, 
Sees 40% – 80% Near Term Downside


Gentex (Nasdaq: GNTX) is a supplier of dimmable mirrors for the auto and airline industry. Its products are commoditized and 


require nothing more than plastic moldings, mirrors, chemicals, printed circuit boards, and other inputs such as compasses. Its 


financials suggest it to be a wildly profitable company, yet our forensic analysis uncovers numerous red flags to suggest otherwise.


A Story Too 
Good To 
Be True


Gentex’s IPO in the early 1980s is littered with red flags. Its dimmable mirror was a carrot to bail out its struggling smoke 


detector business, and its management put no capital at risk. Gentex’s success has defied all the odds: it now commands a 


$5bn market cap and claims >90% market share. Its lead IPO underwriter and banker, OTC Net founded by Juan Carlos 


Schidlowski, was a notorious penny stock promoter who was later charged by the SEC and fled the country


Signs of 
Earnings 


Over-
statement


Gentex’s 40% gross margins are vastly superior to all global auto suppliers and are likely overstated by 2x. We believe it’s 


aggressively leaving costs in inventory (inventory growth is 3x revenue growth) while inflating capex through nonsensical 


projects (e.g. its North Riley Campus is 90% over initial budget). We commissioned a product tear down by IHS, an 


automotive expert, to examine its components. In our view, Gentex’s rhetoric pertaining to its mirror’s level of proprietary 


components and vertical integration is likely exaggerated. We also have documented proof of capex misstatement


Irregular 
Financial 
Policies


Despite margins and profitably that dwarfs auto supply peers, Gentex policies that are touted as shareholder friendly are not


what they appear. Its dividend growth has been well below the rate of its reported free cash flow growth, which is likely 


overstated, and its share repurchases are mostly to offset dilution. Gentex has amassed an abnormal amount of cash on its 


balance sheet, and has irregular Level I and II classifications. We believe Gentex has shunned M&A to avoid outside 


scrutiny. The only acquisition of note in its history was of HomeLink, a related-party deal where we find issues


Governance 
Weaknesses


Gentex was audited by Arthur Anderson (Enron + WorldCom auditor), and its former Michigan partner has sat on Gentex’s


Audit Committee as chairman for 14yrs. Gentex’s audit fee is by far the lowest in the auto supply industry. Its 


Chairman/CEO is 74yrs old and no longer participates in conference calls, yet keeps a tight grip on its financials by having 


to approve invoices over $5k. The Chief Accounting Officer acts functionally as the Treasurer and signs checks, a major 


financial control red flag. Insider ownership declines every year and is just 2.5%. The only executive getting special 


bonuses is the Chief Accounting Officer

Spruce Point “Strong Sell” Opinion On Gentex, 
Sees 40% – 80% Near Term Downside


In addition to material concerns about Gentex’s financials and credibility of management, Spruce Point believes 


investors will also have to look beyond myriad fundamental challenges on the horizon


Key Modules 
are in Decline


Our field research indicates that SmartBeam revenues (10% of total sales)  are already in decline as cost of traditional 


driver assist packages continue to come down in price and OEMs look to avoid redundancies.  HomeLink now faces 


competition for the first time from a comparable Magna product and various phone apps with additional functionality.


SAAR Decline 
& 


De-Contenting 
Cycle


The past cycle of surging auto sales, high levels of affordability and the gradual digitalization of the auto user 


experience presented the ideal backdrop for Gentex.  We believe the current dynamics of the used car market have 


set the stage for a dramatic reversal in auto sales and affordability.  We believe that reduced affordability will lead to 


de-contenting, magnifying the challenge of the downturn for Gentex.


Full Display 
Mirror (FDM) Is 
A Big Problem, 
Not the Answer


Gentex’s moat historically has been the auto-dimming feature of its mirrors. The fact that the FDM functions primarily as 


a display, rather than a mirror, makes the auto dimming feature almost irrelevant. This opens up the FDM product to a 


much wider range of competitors, including display suppliers attempting to make mirrors and traditional mirror 


companies that have strategically partnered with display companies.  We believe that Ficosa (Panasonic) will be offering 


their own version of the FDM at a 50% haircut to the Gentex FDM price of $200.  Gentex’s inability to rely on an auto 


dimming premium and reliance on Kyocera as a display supplier will limit margin and their ability to compete on price.


Long-term 
Viability of 
Mirror in 
Question 


The convergence of the connected car and assisted driving are rapidly reshaping the technology user experience of the 


automobile, particularly vehicle navigation.  We believe that the future of vehicle navigation is cameras, sensors and 


displays, not mirrors. Over the past several years’ multiple world class technology companies (e.g., Samsung, 


Panasonic, Intel, Google) have entered the space via strategic investment and acquisition of existing auto navigation 


suppliers.  All of these players are focusing their efforts on the user experience and to date almost all of them are focused


on Heads Up Display (HUD) or the center console.  Gentex appears to be on an island, having not forged any strategic 


partnerships of meaning to date and linking their future to the likely ill-timed near-term solution of the FDM.

Spruce Point “Strong Sell” Opinion On Gentex, 
Sees 40% – 80% Near Term Downside


We believe Gentex offers a terrible risk/reward. Gentex investors believe it to provide growth at a reasonable price (GARP) 


while trading at 7.5x and 14.5x ‘17E EBITDA and P/E and 10% EPS growth. However, our view is that its cheapness is a 


function of its precarious position in a cyclical auto industry about to turn, its potential to be displaced by new technology, 


and its high risk of financial misstatement. Listen carefully to the Bofa/ML analyst who has an $11 price target
7


Capital Structure and Valuation 


$ in mm, except per share figures


Gentex’s valuation looks “cheap” and appeals to many GARP investors. Analysts expect sustained 7-8% 


sales growth and 8-10% EPS growth in the coming years. These expectations rest of the tenuous 


assumption that Gentex’s financials are fairly stated and that the auto cycle and mirror use can be sustained. 


We adjust Gentex’s financials for below market revenue growth, and normalize its margins for the extreme 


capitalization of expenses and overstatement we have documented in this report. 


Source: Gentex financials and Wall St. and Spruce Point estimates


Note: Our estimates are at the midpoint of our normalized gross margin range of 20-30% vs. Gentex’s reported at 40%


1) Gentex’s credit agreement has a $150m revolving credit facility and $150m term loan due Sept 2018. Its covenants require total leverage under 3x and that its 


financials be stated in accordance with GAAP.


2) We give Gentex full credit for its cash and securities, despite warnings signs of irregular classifications between Level I and II securities.

Key Findings


• Evidence of aggressive capitalization 


of costs through ballooning inventory 


and inflated capex


• Unusual cash management policies 


and recent signs of financial stress


• Evidence of material misrepresentation 


of its business to the SEC and Michigan


• Evidence of capex misrepresentation at 


North Riley expansion


• Evidence of env’t violations/issues


• Gentex claims to produce most of the 


product in house. Results of teardown 


show that most of the significant 


component cost drivers are externally 


supplied components that are neither 


complex, nor proprietary. 


• Finance / accounting dept. in disarray 


after the CFO departure in 2013


• Aggressive capitalization policies


• Gentex’s future is in question as tech 


companies become Tier I suppliers

Gentex’s Financial Scheme In One Chart


Gentex’s financial scheme can be seen clearly in the chart below which shows cumulative growth of sales, accounts, 


receivables and inventory. In the long, run these three financial metrics should converge to grow at the same rate. 


This can be seen by looking at large auto supply peers such as Magna and Autoliv. The fact that Gentex’s inventory 


growth has outpaced sales and receivables by 3x over the long-run should be a major red flag. It suggests that 


Gentex is aggressively capitalizing costs within inventory to enable earnings overstatement.

Incontrovertible Evidence of Capex 
Inflation Direct From Gentex


Source: 2015 Annual Report, p. 12 Filed 2/23/2016


Inaccurate Statements Made In SEC Filings 


Consistently Say 250,000 sqft


Internal Gentex Email Stating 350,000 sqft, Chief Legal 


Officer Scott Ryan Copied on Email


“In 2014, the Company began 


construction of a 250,000 square-


foot manufacturing and 


distribution facility located in 


Zeeland, Michigan. The total cost of 


the project is expected to be 


approximately $45 - $50 million and 


will be completed in 2016. The 


building will be operational for 


distribution of products during mid-


2016, and the production phase will 


begin in early 2017. This project will 


be funded from cash and cash 


equivalents on hand.”


Here is proof that Gentex inflates capex. An internal email dated Feb 2, 2016 explains the North Riley facility as 


350,000 sqft. Less than 3 weeks later, Gentex continued to state in its SEC filings that the facility is 250,000 sqft in 


its 10-K. The square footage is inflated by 40%. We will also show its construction cost ballooned >90%.

Incontrovertible Evidence Gentex Caught 
Telling Lies To U.S. Gov’t Regulators


Response Date Here’s What Gentex Tells The SEC


Feb 2, 2015


“As noted, the resources in the Automotive Segment are shared resources that apply equally to all of the product lines in the segment. 
For example, the Company’s automotive sales team members are responsible for selling all of the automotive products the 
Company offers, to their assigned customers. The Company does not have automotive product line focused sales teams.”


“Similarly, the Company’s manufacturing processes utilize consistent technology, assembly lines, and equipment to build all of the 
products that we make, including the various advanced features (i.e., other product lines) that go into our mirrors.”


“All of the automotive products that the Company offers are sold to the same class of customer and have the same methods of 
distribution”


June 17, 2015


“The Company has assessed whether or not, pursuant to ASC 280-10-50-40, disclosure of revenues for each product line or group of 
similar products is required, and has concluded that disclosure of each product is not required because the products within the 
Automotive Segment exhibit the same or very similar characteristics (i.e., the nature of the products, the nature of the production 
processes, the type or class of customer, the distribution methods for the products, and the nature of the regulatory environment) 
and are grouped into the Automotive Products segment and disclosed appropriately. 


As set forth in the Company's February 12, 2015 response, as well as in discussions with the Staff, the Company does not track and 
present individual product line information since resources are not allocated based on product lines and each of the product lines in the 
Automotive Products Segments are similar in that they: are included in mirror or module products; are produced from shared resources 
(including engineering, production, sales, and administration); and do not have product line managers (as the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker is the Automotive Segment manager). Given the foregoing, and the fact that virtually all customers of this group of similar 
products in the Automotive Segment are automotive OEMs or Tier 1 suppliers, the Company believes its Automotive Products 
Segment rather obviously involves a "group of similar products," as contemplated by ASC 280-10-50-40. In fact, the Company's 
customers commonly dictate changes among the Company's product lines with minimal notice to the Company.”


In 2015, Gentex received comment letters from the SEC with questions about segment reporting disclosure. Pay close 


attention to its responses to the SEC for its justification as to why it should not disclose more financial information 


about its automotive product lines (interior / exterior mirrors and HomeLink). 


Its main arguments are that production, sale, and distribution of both interior and exterior mirrors are the same.

A newly released document from Gentex to the Michigan Environmental Department contradicts management’s

Undisclosed Environmental Violation 
And Continuing Concerns

Gentex makes no mention in its SEC Filings of environmental risks to its business, and does not disclose that it has

from the regulators about Gentex’s environmental situation.

Potential Credit Agreement Violations


Gentex’s Credit Agreement (8.1.16)


Given the evidence of material misstatement about Gentex’s business model, its North Riley Campus capex 


expansion, and its environmental compliance situation, we believe it is in potential violation of its credit agreement


Keeping of Records and Books of Account. “The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary of 


the Borrower to, maintain and keep proper books of record and account which enable the Borrower and 


its Subsidiaries to issue financial statements in accordance with GAAP and as otherwise required by

High Level Indicators of Financial 
Malfeasance At Gentex
17


Stacking Gentex Up To Our Financial 
Malfeasance Playbook


Spruce Point has a history of identifying financial malfeasance and fraud dating back to our 2010-2011 work in exposing Chinese 
reverse merger takeovers.  The story line for these companies typically went something like this.  A company in a rather 
commoditized space is miraculously able to deliver industry defying profit margins.  These atypical profit margins were often
associated with balance sheet distortions necessary to legitimize the phantom profits.  This almost always resulted in some level 
of abnormalities and deception as it pertains to cash management. Gentex’s financials appear simply too good to be true and 
there is strong potential that its profits are being materially overstated.  


Key Metrics How Gentex Corporation Stacks Up


Road to IPO • Many financial schemes have non-traditional routes to going public (e.g. Chinese reverse mergers)
• Gentex IPO’ed as a penny stock through a broker who plead guilty of fraud and fled the country


Margins • Gentex reports ~40% profit margins, double those of their average automotive supply peer set


Balance Sheet • Inventory growth is wildly disconnected from sale / accounts receivables and has never been written down
• Capex is roughly three times that of peers and irrational that Gentex claims it needs to do everything in 


house, even going so far as claiming it needs its own power plant


Cash
Management


• Cash balance is irrationally high at 33% of total assets
• Irregular and unusual classifications of Level I and II securities
• Dividend growth well below free cash flow growth and share repurchases mostly to offset dilution
• Chief Accounting Officer has check signing abilities, an internal control weakness


Questionable 
Related-Party Deals


• The structuring of the HomeLink acquisition (excessive cost and languishing performance) post the close are 
highly suspicious


Management • Financial and accounting leadership is inexperienced and lacking advanced qualifications
• Management has made conflicting statements to the SEC and the State of Michigan in regards to its business

Gentex’s Sordid IPO History


Source: SEC In The Matter of Juan Carlos Schidlowski, May 1994


Gentex’s history is marked by controversy. At IPO 79% of sales came from a single, undisclosed source. Its IPO was 


managed by OTC Net Inc, a small broker of penny stocks based out of Colorado. OTC’s founder, Juan Carlos Schidlowski, 


was sanctioned by the SEC and he fled the country. For good measure, his partner, Joe Pignatielo was known in penny 


stock circles as “the Pig” – Many if not all of OTC’s penny stocks failed, yet Gentex has grown into a wild success and a 


$5bn market cap. Did Gentex just defy all odds, or perpetuate a financial scheme that has duped investors for decades?

Gentex’s Success:  A Story Defying All 
Odds, Appearing Too Good To Be True


1) Fred T. Bauer Oral History Interview, Hope College, June 21, 1994


2) Biography of Fred Bauer on Gentex’s website


3) Gentex’s recent 10-K just states, “Fred Bauer has held his current position with the Company for more than five years.”


According to current CEO Fred Bauer’s oral history, Gentex’s IPO came out of necessity. (1) Its smoke detector business 


struggled, and its prospectus disclosed a lawsuit where it didn’t have adequate insurance coverage, and which could have 


caused a material adverse effect. The story of the auto dimming mirror appears to have been a carrot dangled to investors to 


bail out a business teetering on potential insolvency:


“For Gentex, the worst crisis came in the late 70's. The company had a smoke detector product line that was struggling. We really only sold 


to one customer. Within six months of my entering the company, that customer threatened to quit using our product. It almost ruined the 


company. That was a monumental crisis. The original product of Gentex was a smoke detector to save lives in case of fire. It was sold for 


residential use, primarily for mobile homes.”


How did Bauer get involved with Gentex and the automotive story? Bauer prefaces his responses to both questions by 


saying, “The story there is a little complex” and “It’s kind of a long story” – signs of a man wanting to avoid digging into the past.


What’s clear is that Bauer public biography on Gentex’s website and in recent SEC Filings, omits key details: (2)(3)


• Bauer and a few associates owned 50% of Integrity Design Company (IDC), a joint venture with Donnelly Mirrors to develop 


the dimming mirror. IDC was Bauer’s main focus until approximately a year before Gentex’s IPO


• It doesn’t appear Bauer and his colleagues put any capital at risk into the venture. Donnelly funded just $620,000 towards the 


development of the day/night mirror prior to IPO, and ceded an option to purchase their 50% stake for no cost to IDC


• Donnelly wanted to be the exclusive distributor, and receive a royalty on sales, with other royalties also going to Bauer and


associates. The royalties didn’t have to be paid in the event there was no net profits to the Company


From there on, the rest is history. With no capital at risk, Bauer has created a $5bn company. For an industry that has made 


Bauer a multimillionaire many times over, and allowed him to create an automotive product with sustainable gross margins 


double the average industry average, Bauer seemed outright pessimistic in 1994: (1) 


“Really automotive is one of the most difficult markets. I would not advise someone to start a business in the automotive industry today. 


The best businesses to go in are the ones that you can start small and work your way up.”

• Spruce Point has had numerous successes identifying financial 


scheme by evaluating abnormal financial performance per employee


• In the case of Gentex, we observe that its 40% gross margins are 


nearly 2x the global average in the automotive supply industry


• When viewed in the context that Gentex makes commoditized mirrors 


with fairly low technology enhancements such as remote control 


garage door openers, compasses, and cameras, Gentex’s sustained 


financial outperformance seems highly unlikely


• Gentex also has to contend with the brutal requirements of OEMs 


demanding price reductions of 2-3% per annum, which is a relentless 


headwind to overcome. There are limits to supply chain costs savings 


that Gentex can implement (significant cost components come from 


suppliers), yet its gross margins and gross margins per employee are 


near record highs

Magna vs. Gentex


Gentex Gross Margin vs. Donnelly (Pre-Magna Acquisition)


Source: SEC Filings


• Donnelly and Gentex were engaged in litigation years ago, but in Q4 1996 the parties reached a patent and licensing settlement. 


Donnelly continued to actively develop newer and more advanced electrochromic technologies for the automotive market (2)


• To this day, Magna Mirrors is based in Holland, Michigan approximately 5 miles down the street from Gentex’s Zeeland location. 


According to Magna’s website, its products increasingly incorporate sophisticated electronic functions. Magna produces 26m 


interior mirrors and 28m exterior mirrors annually worldwide. Gentex shipped 26m interior and 10m exterior mirrors in 2016 (3)


• While Magna does not provide segment information on its mirror business, on a consolidated basis its gross margin was 14.6% 


in 2016, while Gentex continues to report gross margins close to 40%


• Gentex’s ability to preserve its gross margin is even more remarkable in light of the annual 2-3% pricing reduction OEMs expect 


it to achieve, and imposed in long-term contracts (4)

Donnelly Gentex


Gentex’s closest competitor is Magna Mirrors, formerly Donnelly Corp, which was acquired in June 2002. (1) 


As we previously discussed, at its beginning, Gentex worked with Donnelly to develop the dimmable mirror. 


While both companies essentially use the same technology, Gentex’s gross margins are more than 2x higher.

Gentex’s Financial Scheme In One Chart


Gentex’s financial scheme can be seen clearly in the chart below which shows cumulative growth of sales, accounts, 


receivables and inventory. In the long, run these three financial metrics should converge to grow at the same rate. 


This can be seen by looking at large auto supply peers such as Magna and Autoliv. The fact that Gentex’s inventory 


growth has outpaced sales and receivables by 3x over the long-run should be a major red flag. It suggests that 


Gentex is aggressively capitalizing costs within inventory to enable earnings overstatement.

Gentex began disclosing an inventory reserve amount for the first time in 2010 after the financial crisis. 


The Company has never disclosed an actual inventory write down.


This is surprising even during the 2013-14 period when Gentex lost Rear Camera Display (RCD). (1)


Now that SmartBeam, a product estimated to be 10% of total revenue,  appears to be under-pressure, 


will Gentex write-down any inventory? (2)


Source: Gentex financials


1)  “Gentex expects sales of rear camera displays to dip, despite new mandate”, Mbiz 5/11/2014
2) (a) Mark Newton (Q4’14) “SmartBeam; our second largest advanced electronic application is SmartBeam, and in 2015 it will continue to be, growing at a faster 


rate than our overall corporate average.” 
(b) Mark Newton (Q1’15) “And for us, SmartBeam, we have identified publicly quite a bit lately that it is one of our primary growth drivers for the business now 
and going forward in the future. For us, the SmartBeam ADAS represents 10% of our business.” 
(c) Note: Mark Newton, SVP, resigned from Company and Board on 7/22/15
(c)   CFO on SmartBeam (Q4’15) : “On the SmartBeam side what we've continued to see is, there has been quite a few new launches on that front, and we don't 
see anything materially changing with our SmartBeam business in 2016 versus what we've seen over the last several years”
d)  CFO on SmartBeam (Q1’17): “In other words, as forward driver assist systems take off and start to become higher volume it does create a bit of a headwind 


for the business and we're looking for new ways to try to offset those losses in those lower segments or in those emerging markets.”

Classic Capex Financial Schemes


Date
Company / 


Ticker


Arthur 
Andersen 
Auditor


Financial Scheme


3/26/02 Waste Mgmt / WM Yes Improperly capitalizing a variety of expenses


11/5/02 WorldCom / WCOM Yes
Manipulated its financial results in two ways. First, WorldCom reduced its operating expenses by 


improperly releasing certain reserves held against operating expenses. Second, WorldCom improperly 
reduced its operating expenses by re-characterizing certain expenses as capital assets


5/28/04 HealthSouth / HLSH No


HealthSouth also capitalized a variety of miscellaneous
operating expenses, describing them in the fixed asset system in ways that


did not correspond, or in some cases even bear any discernible relationship,
to the nature of the costs incurred


9/15/08
Italian American 


Pasta / AIPC
No


Following AIPC’s IPO in 1997, AIPC did not have adequate systems for measuring the internal plant 
labor and other costs used on capital projects. Instead of implementing a suitable system, AIPC 


adopted a practice of capitalizing without support internal labor and other costs used on the projects. 
Under this practice, internal costs capitalized were not identified specifically and segregated from 


ordinary operating expenses and AIPC lacked compensating internal controls. 


6/2/10 Diebold / DBD No
Among the fraudulent accounting practices used to inflate earnings and meet forecasts were: 1) 


improperly delaying and capitalizing expenses and 2) writing up the value of used inventory


8/6/15 Miller Energy / MILL No
Inflating values of oil and gas properties; Miller Energy overstated their value by more than $400 


million, boosting the company’s net income and total assets


6/28/17
Penn West Energy


/ OBE
No


Fraudulently moved hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses from operating expense accounts to 
capital expenditure accounts. This alleged fraudulent movement caused Penn West to artificially 


reduce its operating costs by as much as 20 percent in certain periods, which falsely improved 
reported metrics for oil extraction efficiency and profitability


History is rife with examples of companies using aggressive capitalization schemes to overstate earnings. Gentex 


was audited by Arthur Andersen from inception until its dismissal in March 1999. (1) Some of the largest corporate 


accounting scandals, including Enron and Sunbeam, were overseen by the defunct auditor.


Quote From Former Gentex Accountant: “The capex limit at Gentex is $5,000.00 so anything over that limit needs to be capitalized”

Certain auto suppliers disclose total square footage of their manufacturing, research and distribution

PP&E is very likely overstated by 2-4x.

1) Never fully disclosed other than the expectation that its expected cost rose from $12m to $13m


2) Initially the Gentex said “In November 2002, the Company announced plans to expand its manufacturing operations in Zeeland, Michigan, with the construction of another automotive 


mirror manufacturing facility which is scheduled to open in 2005. The Company plans to invest approximately $100 million over a 5-year period for land, the facility and 


manufacturing equipment to meet the Company's future automotive production needs.” (2002 10-K, p. 9) And later: “During 2003, the Company also announced plans for a new 


corporate office facility linking the fourth manufacturing facility with its existing corporate office and production facility. The Company plans to invest approximately $40-45 million for 


the new facilities during 2004 and 2005. (2003: 10-K, p. 10). And then, “During 2003, the Company also announced plans for a new technical office facility linking the fourth 


manufacturing facility with its existing corporate office and production facility. The Company plans to invest approximately $35 - 40 million for the new facilities, primarily during 2005 


and 2006” (2004: 10-K, p. 10). Finally, “The Company completed the construction of this facility and the new technical center in 2006 at a total cost of approximately $38 


million, which was funded from its cash and cash equivalents on hand.” (2016 10-K, p. 13) 


3) The project has been revised four times $45-$50m (2015 10-K), $55-$60m (Q3’16 10-Q) and now $60-$65m (2016 10-K)


Gentex’s major capital expansions have been grossly misestimated. Its recent North Riley campus 


expansion has been revised four times, and now 90%+ over estimate.

In addition to gross capex cost miscalculation for the North Riley expansion, Gentex cannot seem to get its 


capacity estimates correct. Notice carefully, it dramatically revised its estimates of capacity expansion lower from 


10 to 15 million interior and exterior mirrors to just 8 to 9 million


Where did all the money go if not for production of mirrors?

Incontrovertible Evidence of Capex

Inaccurate Statements Made In SEC Filings

Internal Gentex Email Stating 350,000 sqft, Chief Legal 


Officer Scott Ryan Copied on Email


“In 2014, the Company began 


construction of a 250,000 square-


foot manufacturing and 


distribution facility located in 


Zeeland, Michigan. The total cost of 


the project is expected to be 


approximately $45 - $50 million and 


will be completed in 2016. The 


building will be operational for 


distribution of products during mid-


2016, and the production phase will 


begin in early 2017. This project will 


be funded from cash and cash 


equivalents on hand.”


Here is proof that Gentex inflates its capex. An internal email dated Feb 2, 2016 explains the size of the North Riley 


facility as 350,000 sqft. Less than 3 weeks later, Gentex continued to state in its SEC filings that the facility is 


250,000 sqft in its 10-K. The square footage is inflated by 40%.

Example: Chemistry Lab


In 2011, Gentex told investors it needed a new 60,000 sqft chemical facility. We think the reason is likely it needed to 


pad its capex. To illustrate, Gentex underestimated the cost of project. The property records list the construction value 


at $7.4m vs. $11.5m reported to investors. Local sources indicate that the production, lab and test equipment cost just 


$1.38m (1) – leaving almost $3m unaccounted for. The lab is big enough for >300 people, yet we can find just 7 people 


listing chemistry as a job function on Linkedin and records show 8 employee parking spots constructed. (2) 


Sources now suggest that Gentex’s new North Riley Campus gives it even more chemical lab space for R&D (3). 


As dimmable mirrors get displaced with cameras, its chemical manufacturing abilities could be worthless.

Primary Evidence To Support 
Capex Irregularities


Here is more evidence of poor capital expenditure tracking by Gentex. The email from Gentex’s Environmental Health 


and Safety manager to Michigan DEQ illustrates that the Company has not even tracked equipment related to the 


Chemistry lab in the correct property address. Instead of using the proper 220 Riley St. facility, Gentex says it was 


tracking emission units at the 675 N. State St. facility.

Undisclosed Regulatory Violation; Gentex Cites 
Hardship To Produce Capex Documentation


Gentex claims hardship in producing documentation related to 


capital projects.  It’s hard to believe they don’t maintain 


electronic records or spreadsheets to track capital spending. 


This is just more evidence to support our belief that Gentex’s 


capital expenditure programs are poorly managed 


Source: Michigan DEQ


Gentex makes no mention in its SEC Filings of environmental risks to its business, and does not disclose that it has 


received violation letters from state regulators. Gentex’s hardship claims to produce records of capital expenditures 


support our view that its programs are dubious.

More Excuses Making Little Sense


Source: Freedom of Information Request, Michigan Economic Development Corp.


According to Gentex, tracking employees to work locations is an administrative burden because as 


equipment moves so does its employees. In our site visit to Gentex, we did not see substantial movement of 


employees around campus. Gentex does provide limited biking options for employees moving between 


campuses. According to its 2015 Sustainability report, it purchased 20 bicycles and installed six bike racks to 


facilitate employees moving between campuses. (1) However, Gentex reported total employees of 4,757 at 


year end 2015, which puts in context how little resources are needed to facilitate employee movement.

Resource Usage Growing Slower 
Than Mirror Shipments


Zeeland reports the city’s biggest water and electricity users in 2016 vs. 2007 and Gentex is listed amongst the city’s 


largest consumers. From 2007-2016 Gentex reported total unit shipments from 15.2m to 36.2m (+137%). This 


impressive shipment growth was accomplished by increased electricity and water usage of +69% and +112%, 


respectively. Both resources usage increases were lower than the rate of shipments which suggest either 


improvements in operational efficiencies, or overstatement of production shipments.

Capex Absurdity To An Extreme…..


Source: Ottawa County and 2013 Comprehensive Annual Report


“Poised for development is Gentex Corporation’s 


North Riley Campus in Zeeland Township 


(automotive supplier). All of the internal roads and 


municipal water & sewer lines have been 


constructed within the vacant 140-acre site located 


in the northwest corner of Riley Street and 88th 


Avenue. Gentex will soon start constructing 


the first of four manufacturing/distribution 


centers and a central power plant on the new 


campus. The construction of Gentex’s facilities 


will occur in phases over about a ten-year period. 


At completion, it is anticipated the new 


facilities will comprise about one million 


square feet of manufacturing space. The total 


private investment is expected to be 


approximately $465 million. When the new 


facilities are completed, they will be staffed by an 


estimated 2,928 new Gentex employees.” 


Gentex’s capital expenditure scheme has gone so far that it discussed building a central power plant on 


its campus with Ottawa County, Michigan. Spruce Point can identify very few companies that believe 


they need strategies to deal with energy input – Google Energy being one. (1)

Aggressive Cost Capitalization Strategies


Gentex has been evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” since 


its announcement in 2014 (1). However, it just recently disclosed in its latest 2016 10-K that its adoption 


could impact the accounting of certain customer contracts under long-term supply agreements. (2) 


Curiously, the Company now admits that certain costs could be affected in addition to revenues.


This new disclosure certainly begs the question: Has Gentex been aggressively capitalizing tooling costs 


as a way to inflate its earnings? Its competitor Magna warns of increasing pressure to absorb these costs 


from OEMs, so the incentives for Gentex to aggressively capitalize these costs appear to be increasing. 


Gentex’s New Disclosure of Accounting Changes Impacting Costs:


“The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply the modified retrospective approach. The 


Company has continued to monitor FASB activity related to the new standard and is currently assessing existing contracts with


customers as a part of determining the potential effect the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. The 


Company currently anticipates that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 could impact the accounting treatment of certain 


contracts, as well as pre-production engineering, development and tooling costs related to products manufactured for our 


customers under long-term supply agreements.”   2016 10-K p. 24


Magna Discusses Pressures To Absorb Engineering, Design and Tooling Costs: 


“We face ongoing pricing pressure from OEMs, including through: long-term supply agreements with mutually agreed price 


reductions over the life of the agreement; incremental annual price concession demands; pressure to absorb costs related to 


product design, engineering and tooling and other items previously paid for directly by OEMs; pressure to assume or offset 


commodities cost increases.”   Magna 10-K p. 3


Former Gentex Accountant Quote: “Most tooling at Gentex is capitalized because they are well over the capex limit of $5,000.00”

Related-Party Acquisition: HomeLink


Spruce Point has repeatedly warned about related-party acquisitions (iRobot, Caesarstone, Sabre) and their ability 


to allow management ways to manipulate financials. In the case of Gentex, we believe investors should be highly 


skeptical of its expensive related-party purchase of HomeLink from Johnson Controls in 2013. The mundane 


product addition allowed Gentex to bolster gross profit margins by 1% - 1.5%. We believe the deal was necessary to 


forestall margin pressure and keep Gentex’s financials inflated.


We Estimate Gentex Paid 6x Sales And 12x EBIT For HomeLink, A Business That Would Later Grow Low Single Digits. In 


The Process, Gentex Saddled Its Balance Sheet With Nearly $700m of Goodwill and Intangible Assets


• On September 27, 2013, Gentex completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) related 


to JCI’s wireless vehicle/home communication HomeLink business. Prior to the acquisition, JCI supplied HomeLink products and 


was a licensor of HomeLink to Gentex, which allowed for incorporation into Gentex’s rearview mirror products, that are installed


in automobiles


• The aggregate purchase price for the Business paid at the closing was approximately $700m


• In connection with the acquisition, Gentex borrowed $275m comprised of $125m under its revolver, and $150m term loan


• The balance was funded with cash on hand and sale of investments


• The HomeLink acquisition was done to secure Gentex’s current customers and product offerings in HomeLink mirrors and to 


enable and expand its capabilities beyond the mirror. HomeLink, a vehicle-based control system that enables drivers to remotely 


activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting, security systems, entry gates, and other radio frequency 


convenience products, has been integrated into Gentex' automatic-dimming rearview mirror products and sold by Gentex in the 


marketplace for over 10 years, where it was previously a licensee of the technology


• Once fully integrated, Gentex expected that its annual revenue would increase in the range of $125 million to $150 million per 


year. It also estimated that its gross profit margin would be positively impacted in the range of 1% - 1.5% on a consolidated basis 


• Gentex further expected that once the integration is completed, its pro forma operating expenses would be in the range of the


company's historical operating expenses as a percent of sales. Based on these estimates and expectations, it forecasted the 


addition of HomeLink to be accretive to profitability and earnings per share, and a growth driver for the business overall

HomeLink Sales Growth Forecast 
Mismanagement


David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division


Okay. And then, the one last item here. If we look at HomeLink, can you talk about what the performance of HomeLink has been since you purchased it? The relative growth rate, new 


business wins, any additional color in that regard?


Steven R. Downing


Sure. Like we said when we made the acquisition, we weren't going to provide product-specific financials. But what we have been talking about and communicating is when we made the 


acquisition, we gave that revenue range of $125 million to $150 million. We've been running at the high end of that range over the last few quarters on an annual run rate. And what we would 


say is that the profitability in that information that we provided in post-acquisition and follow-up in the public communication, we've been pretty consistent with that financial performance. And 


so it's been in line, just slightly ahead of the gross profit margin as well


David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division


And would you think going forward that, that grows at the same pace as the mirror -- as your auto-dimming mirror business?


Steven R. Downing


Yes. In fact, one of the things we talked about is we thought we could get that to a low double-digit growth rate in terms 


Source: Q2’14 Earnings Call


Steven L. Dyer - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division


It's Steve. Maybe I missed this, but could you detail maybe the contribution from HomeLink in the quarter and how you see that playing out in Q1? And then maybe, maybe anecdotally any 


seasonality you expect to see with that business?


Steven R. Downing


Well, I think we previously talked about what our guidance was for HomeLink going in, $125 million to $150 million a year, and things were consistent with that going forward, so it was about a 


50-50 split of increase in our revenue's growth, being organic growth, and then the HomeLink contribution and we see that playing out in the first quarter as well.


Steven L. Dyer - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division


Okay, great. And in general, would you expect that business to grow faster than sort of your existing -- the core business, or slower, or any commentary there?


Steven R. Downing


Well I think -- well, like what we've kind of publicly disclosed previously is, our goal is to obviously grow that business at the same rate as our core business. Historically, that's always 


been somewhere in the kind of 8% to 10% range, and we're working very hard to try to find ways to make sure we grow that at near double digits. If you look at yet -- the second question is 


the seasonality part of HomeLink. We don't view HomeLink as having any more seasonality than what our core business does. So I mean, in essence, if you look at our core business, 


HomeLink itself should trend on the same type of path as the mirror business itself. So there shouldn't be any significant differences in the seasonality of HomeLink versus our core business.


Source: Q4’14 Earnings Call


Gentex gave very little color in the following quarters post acquisition about the drivers of HomeLink’s performance. 


When pressed for details from analysts, the Company suggested double digit growth, and then moderated its 


language to 8-10%. The following slide will illustrate, that when finally disclosed in segment reporting, actual growth 


came in at 25% and then plunged to low single digits the following years.

supports our concerns of financial control issues)


HomeLink Consolidated 


(Pre-Acquisition)


Only after intense questioning by the SEC did Gentex agree to break-out HomeLink revenues in its segment 


reporting footnotes in its 10-K (1). Gentex did not provide quarterly contributions to its consolidated results from 


HomeLink over the following year post acquisition, and refused to answer questions on its conference calls (2). 


This is contrary to best reporting practices.


How did sales spike 25% only 


to decline to low single digits?


Recall that at deal announcement (July 2013), Gentex said Homelink would add $125 to $150m in revenue. However, in its 


first full year it disclosed $170m, or $20 to $40m more than planned. Gentex has never completely explained what to 


attribute this significant source of upside


Why significantly more than 


$125-$150m guidance?

HomeLink’s “Assets” Inflated 2x?


Property records warn that the transaction was a 


“not a good sale” – the sale price is approximately 


50% of the value marked on the books of Gentex 


as “real property” at $1.06m – records show it as 


an empty storage unit.


Marking up personal 


property? Did Gentex 


determine that machines, 


desks and hardware were 


undervalued?

Gentex said the terms of the agreement would include, “HomeLink assets, intellectual property, testing facilities, and the 


talented employees who manage and support the business, for a purchase price of $700 million.” (1) Our property records 


search uncovered just a single empty warehouse acquired marked “Not a Good Sale” according to the city of Holland.

Undisclosed Mexican 
Manufacturing Property


A recent article in Automotive News entitled “A savvy plan for the Trump era, Automation allowed Gentex to 


close global plants” is eye-opening insofar as Gentex reveals it had a Mexican manufacturing facility from 


the HomeLink acquisition. (1) This asset was never properly disclosed in any 10-K Annual Report SEC 


filing under the “Properties” section or in the deal press release. 


The purchase agreement vaguely referenced Mexican Assets (2)


Gentex says it has closed two foreign plants, yet never disclosed any restructuring charge, severance, or 


asset disposal or write-down charges. 


“In recent years, Gentex closed its two foreign plants in low-wage Mexico and China and 


consolidated all production into a single factory complex in western Michigan. The Zeeland 


plant now produces self-dimming mirrors, garage door openers and everything else in the 


Gentex product catalog for global markets.”


“The Mexican plant had aging equipment, and Gentex concluded it would be impossible to 


boost output without hiring more workers. Instead, the company installed new production 


equipment in Zeeland”

The Real HomeLink Killer


According to our research, while Gentex used to have the sole solution for the auto OEMs to integrate a garage 


door opener, that is no longer the case. Magna recently entered the market, and is known for undercutting prices 


to compete with Gentex. Additionally, there are a variety of universal garage door opener applications compatible 


with cell phones on the market and offering other features. (e.g. mygarageopener)

Irrationally Managed Cash and 
Investments on Gentex’s Balance Sheet


Spruce Point has significant concerns about Gentex’s management of its cash and investment portfolio. There 


appears to be significant unutilized capital on the balance sheet. As an asset that currently yields almost nothing, it 


doesn’t make sense why the Company carries an abnormally high percentage. We find abnormally high cash balances 


and nonsensical capital management strategies with many of the Chinese scams we exposed in the 2010-2012 period.

Cash as % of Liquid Assets Keeps Growing Cash To Total Assets Vs. Peers


Gentex’s abnormal cash policy can also be seen from a benchmarking analysis. Absent its Japanese peers, which 


notoriously hoard cash and offer low dividend payouts, Gentex has the most cash to assets among auto suppliers. Visteon,  


the only other outlier, is likely carrying a higher cash balance given its history of bankruptcy and need to carry greater 


liquidity. Visteon also has 63% of its cash in foreign markets, and may not be able to efficiently reduce its balance due to tax


considerations. Gentex reports just $7.9m of cash at foreign subsidiaries in its last 10-K.

Who Is Gentex’s Treasurer Managing Cash?


Spruce Point is concerned that Gentex does not have a Treasurer. Cash management forms part of treasury’s core 


functions. Best corporate practices also dictate separation of financial duties. In particular, investors should worry 


that Kevin Nash, Gentex’s Chief Accounting Officer who records transactions, is also an authorized check 


signatory. All of Gentex’s automotive supplier peers have named Treasurers, why doesn’t Gentex?

Close Look At Cash And Investments


A close look into Gentex’s investment portfolio shows significant cause for concern. 


For example, notice that Gentex puts Certificate of Deposits (CDs) as a “Level 1” asset. CDs should be Level 2 


assets because they are not actively traded like stocks. For example, Apple classifies its CDs and time deposits as 


Level 2 (Source: 10-Q. p. 9). Google classifies time deposits as Level 2 (Source: 10-Q, p. 12)


Also observe that Gentex classifies short-term mutual funds as Level 2 and long-term mutual funds as Level 1


Mutual Funds are actively traded, with quoted prices, and marked-to-market daily. There should be no reason why 


Gentex is marking mutual funds as Level 2.

Gentex’s Dividend Policy Not As 
Generous As It Appears


Gentex is quick to point out its dividend policy as a shareholder friendly measure. However, the growth rate of the 


dividend has vastly lagged the Company’s diluted EPS and free cash flow growth. Management could either 


significantly boost the dividend or enact a special dividend, yet it has chosen not to. 


Either management is being too conservative with its dividend policy, or its cash and cash flows are 


not as robust as they appear.

Gentex’s Share Repurchase Policy 
Not As Friendly As It Appears


Gentex is quick to point out all of its share repurchase programs over the years, and that it has repurchased over 


$750m. However, what Gentex does not tell investors is that it has issued over $500m worth of equity. Therefore, on 


a net basis, Gentex has really only repurchased $250m of stock, a less meaningful amount than advertised.

Low Wages: The #1 Employee Complaint 
Among Glassdoor Reviews


Pros: Growing but is slowing down


Cons: Base pay is below market average. Using bonus' and stock to "offset" that but the stock has been worthless for 
years.


"Good but a lot of politics“  (Jan 2017)


Cons: A bit lower salaries that are made up by the stock and bonuses.


“Engineer“  (Oct 2016)


“Engineer“  (Aug 2016)


Cons: The pay is lower than competitors, and talented engineers often leave and make 15-20% more elsewhere 
(although this can potentially be offset by bonuses and stock options)


The single biggest con about working at Gentex from employee review site Glassdoor is its low base 
wages relative to the industry. Why can’t Gentex pay market wages? 


Gentex is highly dependent on motivating and rewarding its employees by propagating its share price. 
Given that technology is fundamentally driving changes in its industry, 


We believe Gentex will be challenged to recruit talent to Zeeland, Michigan

Gentex Management Structure


Executive / Age Biography Spruce Point Concern


CEO:
Fred Bauer / 74


• Chairman / CEO / Co-Founder of Gentex
• Bauer hides from his biography that he and a few 


associates owned 50% of Integrity Design Company 
(IDC), a joint venture with Donnelly Mirrors to 
develop the dimming mirror. IDC was Bauer’s main 
focus until a year before Gentex’s IPO


• 1998 Ernst and Young Master 
Entrepreneur of the Year


• Bauer appears removed from being CEO, he has not been participating in recent 
earnings conference calls (does he not want to be on record?)


• Promotional “feel good” video to make the CEO seem like a good guy, when in 
reality there is strong potential his Company has been covering up years of financial 
misstatement


• Spruce Point has previously warned to be skeptical about E&Y award winners; many 
have often been exposed as frauds (see Ametek, slide 48)


• Bauer should split his Chairman / CEO role, and consider retirement at the age of 75
• He has consistently surrounded himself at the Board with long-time employees and 


associates
• According to sources, Bauer personally signs off on invoices >$5,000, which could 


be an indicator that suggests his desire to conceal ongoing financial misstatements


Chief Accounting 
Officer: 
Kevin Nash / 42


• Joined Gentex in 1999 as a Senior Accountant and 
has held various positions at Gentex with increased 
responsibilities including Accounting Manager, 
Corporate Controller and Director of Accounting. 


• Unusual for a company of Gentex’s size to have the Chief Accounting Officer as a 
named executive


• Appointed upon abrupt departure of previous CFO Steve Dykman in 2013
• Nash frequently speaks on conference calls, which is also unusual
• No substantive experience outside of Gentex
• Does not have a CPA, instead his bio promotes the CMA “certification”
• In addition to having control of accounting, Nash also has check signing abilities


SVP/CFO:
Steve Downing / 39


• According to his biography, he joined in 2002 as a 
financial analyst after working for an undisclosed 
“private company executing activity-based cost, 
price modeling and control for financial 
statements” 


• Before being appointed CFO, he was Director of 
Commercial Management and oversaw cost 
accounting, forecasting, strategic partnerships and 
new business. 


• Relatively young to be CFO of a Company of Gentex’s size
• Limited substantive experience outside of Gentex
• Was promoted to SVP with added responsibility of business development and 


sales, an unusual combination that shows he is not spending all his time on 
financial management


• Does not have an MBA or an advanced degree/certification


Spruce Point is concerned that Gentex’s financial and accounting leadership is inexperienced, lacking advanced 


qualifications, and may not be willing to question the authority of its aging founder.

$17,500, respectively.


In addition to the above Performance Plan payments, the Board of

Special Bonuses Given Two Years In A Row To The Chief Accounting Officer Look Suspicious


Base Salary Increases Among Named Executives The Highest For the CFO and Chief Accounting Officer


Gentex’s management team is relatively young, and works alongside the founder who is significantly older. The Chief 


Accounting Officer, who is not a CPA but rather a CMA, has been with Gentex since 1999. It’s unusual that the Chief 


Accounting Officer also be a named executive, particularly for a company of Gentex’s size. We also observe that his 


base pay is rising faster than the other executives, and he was granted two unusual special bonuses recently

James Wallace 74 2007 Lead Independent Director


Spruce Point has serious concerns about the structure of Gentex’s Board and its ability to detect potential financial 


misstatement. The CEO holds the combined Chairman role and has stacked the Board with allies and former insiders. The Audit 


Committee Chairman, Gary Goode, was formerly the head of Arthur Andersen’s Grand Rapids, MI office. Arthur Andersen 


(Enron’s auditor) used to also audit Gentex, but was dismissed in March 1999 (1). He is joined on the committee by Fred Sotok, 


an 82 year old former executive who has been on the audit committee since 2001. 


Spruce Point believes Gentex should impose: 1) A split of CEO and Chairman roles,  2) Mandatory retirement for Board members 


above the age of 75, and 3) Require rotation of committee members at least every 3 years. 


These practices would provide shareholders better protection against the potential for financial misstatement and fraud.

Like many of our prior successful short sale campaigns, we find that directional changes of total insider ownership are

Abnormally Low Audit Fees


Gentex’s audit fees are extremely off-market and the lowest in the automotive supplier space in an absolute and 


relative sense. Gentex reports over $1.6 billion of revenues, yet paid just $462k in audit fees. Either they are just 


extremely good at negotiating fees, or investors should question if a full and complete audit is truly being 


conducted. Furthermore, investors should take notice that Gentex recently included an “Audit-Related” fee for the 


first time for unspecified “accounting matters with the annual audit”


Note: Gentex described audit-related fee as “principally consist of consultations 


concerning accounting matters associated with the annual audit”

Product Tear Down


Spruce Point commissioned IHS to conduct a product tear-down of a Gentex Mirror (GENK33453) which included 


the dimming feature, high definition display, compass and HomeLink.


Our main research object was to estimate the level of proprietary features in the product and the difficulty level  


competitors would have to replicate the product.

In Our Opinion, Gentex’s Claims of Proprietary 
Nature of Its Mirrors Is Misleading


The teardown indicated that the overwhelming majority of components from a cost perspective are sourced from 


3rd parties.  This suggests that to offset the annual 2-3% OEM price reductions for this product, Gentex has to 


continuously pressure suppliers for reductions, a factor that is mostly out of their control. The significant costs 


associated with display doesn’t likely bode well for margins as Gentex tries to grow its Full Display Mirror.

Pressure At SmartBeam


SmartBeam, estimated to produce $155-$165m of annual sales (10% of total revenue), was once a big growth 


driver for Gentex.  Now it growth will be flat/down and Gentex under pressure to replace its former darling.


SVP Mark Newton (Q4’14) “SmartBeam; our second largest advanced electronic application is SmartBeam, and 
in 2015 it will continue to be, growing at a faster rate than our overall corporate average.” 


SVP Mark Newton (Q1’15) “And for us, SmartBeam, we have identified publicly quite a bit lately that it is one of 
our primary growth drivers for the business now and going forward in the future. For us, the SmartBeam ADAS 
represents 10% of our business.” 


Mark Newton, SVP, resigned from Company and Board on 7/22/15


CFO on SmartBeam (Q4’15) : “On the SmartBeam side what we've continued to see is, there has been quite a 
few new launches on that front, and we don't see anything materially changing with our SmartBeam business 
in 2016 versus what we've seen over the last several years


CFO on SmartBeam (Q1’17): “In other words, as forward driver assist systems take off and start to become 
higher volume it does create a bit of a headwind for the business and we're looking for new ways to try to 
offset those losses in those lower segments or in those emerging markets.”


Analyst Hoselton: So net-net, SmartBeam revenue is probably going to be flat to down in some amount is that 
a fair statement?


CFO Response: “Yes I would say over the next year that's probably an accurate trend.”

Don’t Expect Full Display Mirror
To Offset SmartBeam Loss


Some bulls believe Gentex’s Full Display Mirror (FDM) to be a material driver to future earnings, but so far it has 
failed to deliver any material contribution, and management is stringing a long-tail ramp. We believe Panasonic’s 


acquisition of Ficosa will be a major strategic headwind for FDM and expect the price Gentex charges of $200 could 
be cut in half based on our conversation with an industry expert. 


• The Gentex full display mirror is a rear vision system that uses accustomed externally mounted video camera and a mirror integrated 


video display to optimize a vehicles rearward view. 


• This new Gentex rear vision system consists of a hybrid full display mirror and accustomed Gentex designed camera engineered 


specifically for automotive vision. The mirror offers bi-modal functionality. In mirror mode, the product functions as a standard electrical 


rear-view mirror.


• According to Gentex, the full display mirror began production in the fourth quarter of 2015.


• Management has not offered regular updates about how many mirrors have shipped other than at launch


CFO Downing Q4’15:  “So, really in 2015 we really shipped I think like 150, maybe 200 mirrors – full display mirrors at the end of 2015. And 


that product really just starts ramping this year. It's not going to be material to the business in 2016 or really even in 2017 for that matter. So 


it's really that you're talking about two to three vehicles in the 2016-2017 timing that are going to be executing full display mirror. That's 


really an 2018 and beyond growth story for the company.”


And later, management would push out the timeline even further:


CFO Downing Q2’16: “And what we said is kind of in that 2019 time period or 2020, if we weren't doing 0.5 million units or so of this 


product we'd probably be disappointed with that performance.”


• Even assuming Gentex hits its far off target of 500,000 units and gets a $200 ASP at a 40% margin, it’s an incremental $100m of 


revenues and $40m of gross margin


• We don’t believe that Full Camera Display will ramp fast enough to alleviate the headwinds caused by SmartBeam and its eventual 


displacement and we expect competition to vastly cut prices. For example, we believe Panasonic and Ficosa will drive significant price 


deflation in this product


1) CFO Q3’14: Margins would be in-line with corporate profile


2) 3/21/17: Panasonic acquires additional shares in Ficosa to speed technology synergies

The Unanticipated Fallout From FDM


Some bulls believe Gentex’s Full Display Mirror (FDM) to be a material driver to future earnings, but so far it has 
failed to deliver any material contribution.  We believe the FDM is the first step in a long path towards auto-dimming 


mirror obsolescence and reduced Gentex margins.


Gentex’s has historically been the only high quality supplier of auto-dimmable mirrors available to OEMs.  This 


fact alongside of a steady product release cycle, that included some proprietary IP, has allowed Gentex to 


charge premium pricing and command premium margins.


Conceptually the Full Display Mirror (FDM) is a camera/display system packed inside of a rearview mirror that 


can double as a traditional mirror for failsafe purposes.  Given the primary function of the device is a digital 


display, the relevance of auto-dimming is de minimis 


The limited relevance of the auto-dimming feature invites new competition in the FDM space from two groups 


of competitors


 Automobile display suppliers who are willing to attempt to build standard mirrors


 Standard non dimming mirror companies sourcing displays from third parties


Our field work indicates that Ficosa (Panasonic) is presently in the market with their own version of the FDM 


at a 50% discount to the Gentex FDM.


Given that Gentex sources screens from 3rd parties, their ability to compete on price and drive margins will 


likely be limited

Recent Warnings From Gentex’s Q1’17


Issue What Gentex Says Spruce Point Issue Our Interpretation


Move to 
Accelerate 


Debt 
Paydown


CFO Quote (Q1’17): “Yes exactly, and the reason why primarily it’s a 
variable rate debt today obviously there are speculation or what those 
rates are going to look like. We feel like we are in a better position to 
go ahead and pay that down and then if an acquisition presents itself, 
obviously we can always kind of reschedule or re-up a new borrowing to 
cover that new target.” 


Gentex currently has in place an interest 
rate swap of $150m to convert its variable 


rate debt to fixed payments protect it against 
rate increases, so its explanation is a 


diversion from reality


Gentex wants to pay down debt fast
while it still has cash flow available 
before its business worsens and its 


stuck with a large debt load


Tax 
Provision 
lowering 
effective
tax rate


Q1’17 (10-Q): The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three 
months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 is 
primarily due to favorable discrete items that impacted the Company's 
tax provision in the amount of $5.6 million, of which $3.8 million was 
related to a change in tax method and $1.8 million was related to the 
adoption of ASU 2016-09 during the most recently completed quarter…”


Earnings quality is lower when companies 
start making vague changes to tax methods


This is the first time we’ve seen
Gentex play with its effective tax rate 


in order to manage its EPS higher. 
This further supports our view that 


problems lurk on the horizon


ASU 2014-19 
Revenue 
Adoption


Q1’17 (10-Q): The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter 
of 2018 and apply the modified retrospective approach...The Company 
currently anticipates that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 could 
impact the accounting treatment of certain contracts, as well as pre-
production engineering, development and tooling costs related to 
products manufactured for our customers under long-term supply 
agreements.” 


Gentex has been evaluating ASU 2014-19 for 
three years and is now disclosing it may have 


an impact on costs. The accounting 
implementation relates to revenue 


recognition


Gentex appears to be capitalizing or 
deferring costs to inflate its earnings. 
Investors should not be surprised if 


Gentex makes a restatement or 
earnings charge


Freight Costs 
In SG&A


Q4’16 Press Release (Jan 2017): “Operating expenses during the 
quarter were higher than anticipated primarily due to premium freight 
charges and travel costs associated with the aforementioned raw 
material shortages, as well as foreign office expenses which were 
impacted by unfavorable exchange rates.”


Q4’16 Conf Call (Nash): Admits that premium 
freight costs to secure raw materials were 


included in SG&A


This accounting maneuver bolsters
our concern about gross margin 


overstatement. We believe costs of 
securing raw materials should clearly 


increase COGS, not SG&A


Recent signs pointing to future earnings contraction and accounting issues have emerged. In Q1’17 Gentex said it expects sales 


for Q2 and Q3 to be at the low end of the range of its annual guidance, but that Q4 will return to the high. Based on clues left by 


management, we think investors should brace for disappointment.

Gentex Is Quietly Expanding And 
Acknowledging More Competition


Annual Report Notes on Competition


2016 


The Company is the leading manufacturer of electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirrors in the world, and is 
the dominant supplier to the automotive industry. Competitors for automotive rearview mirrors include Magna 


International, YH America, Inc., BYD Auto Company, Murakami Kaimeido Company, Steelmate, Tokai Rika Company, 
Ningbo Kingband, Peak Power Automotive, and Beijing Sincode. The Company also supplies electrochromic 


automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to certain of these rearview mirror competitors


2015

International, YH America, Inc., BYD Auto Company, Murakami Kaimeido Company, Steelmate, Tokai Rika Company, 
Ningbo Kingband, and Beijing Sincode. The Company also supplies electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview 


mirrors to certain of these rearview mirror competitors.


2014


The Company is the leading manufacturer of electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirrors in the world, and is 
the dominant supplier to the automotive industry. Competitors for automotive rearview mirrors include Magna 


International, Samvardhana Motherson Reflective, Murakami Kaimeido Company, Ichikoh Industries, Tokai Rika 
Company, and Grupo Ficosa International. The Company also supplies electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview 


mirrors to certain of these rearview mirror competitors.


Prior To 2013


While the Company believes it will retain a dominant position in auto-dimming rearview mirrors for some time, one 
other U.S. manufacturer (Magna Mirrors) is competing for sales to domestic and foreign vehicle manufacturers and is 


supplying a number of domestic and foreign vehicle models with its hybrid or solid polymer matrix versions of 
electrochromic mirrors. In addition, two Japanese manufacturers are currently supplying a few vehicle models in 


Japan with solid-state electrochromic mirrors. There are a small number of Chinese domestic mirror suppliers that 
are marketing and selling auto-dimming rearview mirrors, in low volume, within the domestic China automotive 


market. However, the Company believes that these Chinese domestic mirror suppliers do not currently meet global 
automotive grade specifications.


For years, Gentex only acknowledged that Magna was a main competitor, 


with a few other “unnamed” Asian competitors of lower threat. 


We observe that most recently, Gentex is now expanding its list of competitors disclosed in its 10-K.

Gentex Faces An Uphill Battle in China


Gentex frequently cites mirror and HomeLink opportunities in China, but has produced limited results to date.  
Spruce Point believes that both of these opportunities are limited given regulation, perceived commitment to the 


market, low cost substitutes and the nature of parking in China.


The Myth That HomeLink Will Succeed In China:


• There are not many home garages in China, let alone homes. The average dwelling size is 646 sqft  (2)


• Parking is fragmented with each housing compound having its own proprietary system and guards


• Entry almost always requires waiting for the guard’s assistance 


1) Auto News, May 29, 2017


2) Source


• Gentex closed its assembly plant in China without an SEC disclosure (1)


• Chinese government requires that domestically made autos must include 


at least 75% locally made content OEMs are likely to require the mirror 


to be installed in China to meet localization standards


• Existing competitors (Magna, Murakami, Ichikoh, etc.) have large 


manufacturing presence and sales forces talking to Chinese OEMs


• The market is also flush with aftermarket solutions (photo to left) from 


Wand Jiarui (Wonder Auto) and Tencent that are being promoted by 


garages and sell for approximately 200 RMB (~$30.00) 


Rearview Mirror Available In China for ~$30.00


SVP Newton (Q1’14): “We continue to have increasing success in our applications in China as another area for us in this.”


CFO Downing (Q3’14):  “So if you look at the potential for HomeLink in China, plus HomeLink in some expanding markets, that's probably a year or 


more out. And so for us, it's one of the growth opportunities that we can see on the horizon for the next several years in terms of our product roadmap.”


CFO Downing (Q1’15): “One of the things we've been working on is introducing HomeLink in the China market, and that includes getting compatibility


in place with the garage door industry and the active control industry in China. And over the next several years, we believe there's a lot of opportunity 


for HomeLink penetration to grow in the China market.”

Looming Auto Slowdown Creates 
Headwinds On The Horizon


• As a primer to this section of our report we would encourage our readers to view the following blogs and 
sell side research reports:


 Daniel Ruiz’s excellent blog “Blinders off Blog” / Twitter account (blog, twitter)
 BAML Auto Team’s “Are we there yet?.. Yes, and heading into the summer of our discontent” 
 Morgan Stanley Auto Team’s “Auto industry may soon face an unprecedented buyers strike” (CNBC)


• The production and sales pricing of new automobiles globally is a function of interconnected factors 
including auto credit, buyer incentives, dealer motivations, used car values, trade cycles and the health of 
the rental car market.  Most of these factors are derivatives of used car prices.  


• These factors tend to feed off one another in a vicious cycle.  As a result, the US auto sales cycle has been 
very volatile historically and routinely experiences peak to trough gain/losses of 20-45%.  


Q: “…How would you recommend that we think about what would guide towards the low-end of 
that range and toward the high-end of that range?” – Analyst, Matt Stover SIG


A:  “I think the bigger – the single biggest issue that will affect that is overall production levels, 
but also the macroeconomic environment. So one of the things we talk about, not only in the 
number of vehicles that are produced, but what segment of vehicles are produced and then 
beyond that what price point are those vehicles selling at. So, one of the early indicators of a 
recession for us that we look for is what is the average content, what is the average sell price of 
the car itself.” (our emphasis)  Steve Downing Q4 16 Earnings Call

Looming Auto Slowdown Creates 
Headwinds On The Horizon (Cont’d)


 The financial crisis provided the perfect set of conditions for the largest trough to peak sales gains (+68%) since 
the 1970s.  High used car prices enhanced owner’s equity, resulting in a shortened trade cycle, that increased 
new car sales velocity.  Strong used car pricing also raised lease residual values.  High residual values reduced 
the amount required in lease payments by the lessee allowing for the lease of higher priced cars on the same 
budget (mix).  Interest rates were also at record lows and captive finance arms were flush with capacity.


 Several of the underlying factors that supported the record number of auto sales (and prices) had reached 
extreme levels by 2016 and have since begun to reverse course. There are now early signs and warnings that 
US sales could fall precipitously over the next four years.  


 Gentex’s revenue growth has historically been a function of vehicle production levels, product introductions 
and take rates.  The Company in recent years has provided guidance as a spread (typically +5-10%) over IHS 
light vehicle estimates.


 BAML predicts that the coming trough in US sales and production will be around 13 million (-25% drawdown 
from 2016) in 2021.  They estimate that the OEMs will be about break even at this production level and that 
suppliers’ earnings will be cut by 40%


 Gentex’s earnings in the intermediate term are poised to be significantly challenged by headwinds in 
automotive production, mix, and price at the same time that they are likely to face additional margin 
compression from new competitors and product substitutes (see page 90: Better Alternatives to the Mirror

The Volatile Nature of the US Automotive 
Sales / Production Cycle


Source: WardsAuto InfoBank, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates


The financial crisis represented the largest drawdown in auto sales during the modern era and set the table 
for an unprecedented boom.  However, the pendulum appears to have swung to far and sewn the seeds for 


another meaningful correction.

Mapping Out The Impending Auto Sales, 
Price And Mix Declines


Used vehicle pricing continues to decline as supply in 
the used car space accelerates.


As supply continues to increase materially, used car 
prices will move down meaningfully.  SUVs and Light 
Trucks won’t be spared from this decline.


Increase Off Lease Volume          Increase Used Cars Supply           Decrease in Used Pricing         Reduced Trade-
In Values & Increased Monthly Payments            Reduce Affordability             Reduction in New Car Sales


Off Lease Volume Drives Used Car Prices Lower


Consumers will potentially be surprised to find that they 
have small or negative equity in their existing vehicle.


This will result in a longer trade cycle and either higher 
monthly payments going forward, a shift down into 
lower trim models or opting to purchase a used car 
instead of new 


Reduced Trade-In Value Results in Trading Down


Used Car prices as a percentage of New Car prices have 
been near historic highs (48% according to Manheim) 
and are starting to revert


A reduction in the spread to more normalized levels 
would further increase the demand for used cars, 
barring further OEM new car concessions


Used Cars Become an Attractive Substitute


Captive lenders reduce capacity going forward, given 
existing exposure on their books to residual values, and 
at the same time interest rates will tick up. 


Tighter credit conditions will result in buyers looking at 
less expensive trims or used cars


Credit Access and Terms Will Tighten

Better Alternatives To The Mirror 
As a Car Technology Platform
90


Better Alternatives 
To The Mirror As A Platform


As a primer to this section of our report we encourage our readers to view the following pieces of research:


 PWC’s Strategy & report entitled “Connected Car 2016: Opportunities, Risk, and turmoil on the way to autonomous 
vehicles” (Report)


 McKinsey & Company’s report entitled “How the convergence of automotive and tech will create a new ecosystem” 
(Report)


 Oliver Wyman report entitled “Automobile Related Startups Mature” (Report)


• The Gentex “story” is predicated on packaging allegedly high margin technologies into the mirror.  In a best case 
scenario for Gentex, the mirror evolves to become a hub or “module” for vehicle navigation


• We view the majority of existing technologies in its mirrors (e.g., compass, HomeLink, vehicle integrated toll payment) 
as all relatively low tech and commoditized, which shouldn’t command much in the way of margin. We believe the 
historical premium is largely attached to the perception of Gentex’s dominance in auto-dimming and engineering


• Gentex’s Rear Camera Display (RCD) and recently released Full Display Mirror (FDM) are arguably its first foray into 
somewhat more sophisticated digital technology.  Not surprisingly, they will soon face a wholly different set of 
competitors than they have in the mirror 2.0 space


• Our IHS commissioned teardown results indicate that Gentex’s screens are sourced from Kyocera, so there is nothing 
proprietary or differentiated in the display.  Spruce Point’s market research indicates that Gentex’s camera isn’t 
meaningfully differentiated from other high end solutions (“co-development” with Ambarella) and that they are likely 
to face fierce competition from other optical companies if the industry moves in the direction of cameras

Better Alternatives To The Mirror 
As A Platform (cont’d)


• Spruce Point is also of the opinion that the mirror as a display module is likely to be displaced in the 
intermediate to long-term by Heads-Up Display (HUD) and Augmented Reality HUD.  This is where all of 
Gentex’s high tech peers are placing their chips


• These sophisticated and well funded technology companies (e.g., Samsung, Panasonic, Google, Nvidia, Intel) 
view the digitalization of navigation as a sub component of the larger mega trends of the connected car and 
autonomous driving.  These organizations have meaningfully entered the navigation display space via 
acquisition of cameras, sensors and display


• Gentex appears willing to concede the HUD space (baring reference to a single electrochromic patent) and 
place all of its chips on the Full Display Mirror.  This is a major strategic bet that investors will need to become 
comfortable with, because the range of Gentex outcomes associated with limping into HUD aren’t generally 
attractive


• The fact that Gentex has not received bids to date reflects either the companies insistence on the mirror as 
the destination, the fact that most of the industry is interested in differentiated sensors, cameras and display 
capabilities or that Gentex would prefer not to open up its books


• It is clear to Spruce Point and BAML’s Automotive Analyst, that the emergence of these large players suggests 
that the competitive intensity in the space will pickup materially and margins will come under pressure
92


Key Quotes From Analysts And Consultants


“In our view, the solid growth that Gentex once enjoyed is likely to be challenged by increasing competition and potential substitute 
products. In fact, the NHTSA ruling requiring all new vehicles in the US have rear camera displays (RCDs) by May 2018 could 
accelerate the path towards the ultimate replacement of automotive mirrors by cameras. At the very least, the existence of a 
potential replacement profit will likely drive meaningful pricing and margin pressure for Gentex.”  (our emphasis)
6/15/2017 John Murphy, Autos & Car Manufacturers Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch 


“Today, 70 percent of global connected service sales come from premium brands. By 2022, that number will fall to 50 percent, at 
the expense of falling margins. Although connected services will generate sales of US$155 billion, most of this value will be offset 
by falling sales from legacy features such as navigation, entertainment, and safety systems. These trends will contribute to a 
squeeze in profits for OEMs and suppliers. Higher R&D expenses will not convert into higher overall sales. On the supply side, by 
2030, profits available to traditional automakers and suppliers may drop from 70 percent to less than 50 percent of the industry
total. The balance of $120 billion may be captured by new entrants, including suppliers of new technology, mobility services, or
digital services. Many of today’s manufacturers and suppliers lack the skill, agility, and boldness to turn their companies digital 
quickly enough to take advantage of this change. (our emphasis)
PWC’s – “Connected Car 2016: Opportunities , Risk, and turmoil on the way to autonomous vehicles”


The deals are taking automakers beyond their familiar partners, such as component manufacturers and dealerships. It is also 
notoriously hard to forecast the return-on-investment in digital technologies. But automakers need the new digital technologies, and 
they cannot develop them all themselves – especially given the imperative to integrate them fast. And digital innovation arises from a 
fast, experimental culture that is not to be found in much of the car industry. (our emphasis)
Oliver Wyman - “Automobile Related Startups Mature”


No single player is likely to dominate any part of such a horizontally organized, complex value chain by itself. But many of the new tech 
entrants are well positioned to take the lead in the software-focused parts. For each part of the ecosystem, there might be room for 
only a few winners, since few players will be able to invest the resources necessary to reach scale. (our emphasis)

Gentex’s Display and Camera 
Capabilities Aren’t Differentiated


As part of our deep dive into Gentex,  
we hired IHS Markit to conduct a 
detailed product teardown of a 
Gentex rear display mirror.  The 
teardown identifies all of the 
product’s component parts.  The 
analysis indicates that Gentex relies 
on Kyocera Corp to provide the 
mirror’s display.  There is nothing 
differentiated about this component.  


Based on our field research, there 
isn’t any indication that Gentex’s 
camera is meaningfully differentiated 
technology


• To ensure video quality, Gentex leaned on a “co-development” with 
Ambarella to develop DSP based video processing solution.  The 
“partnership” can’t be that meaningful given that it isn’t disclosed in either 
companies financials 


• At 19th Annual Needham Growth Conference, Ambarella CEO mentioned 
that they have begun shipping Systems on Chip (SoC) directly to 
automotive OEMs.  This results in Ambarella having the ability to 
disintermediate Gentex over time.  (Motley Fool)

BMW’s Mirrorless Car Concept


Source: BMW Shows off mirrorless car at CES, Jan 6, 2016


Rear View Mirror Replaced With Camera Side Mirrors Replaced With Cameras


Some of Gentex’s customers such as BMW are already testing concept cars where cameras replace mirrors.


In countries such as Japan, laws have already been changed to allow auto companies to replace mirrors w/cameras, 


whereas the US is seen adopting the standard in 2018, and China is expected to join in the coming years (1) 


As camera’s replace mirrors, we believe Gentex’s competition base will increase significantly.

PWC Sees Future Supply Side of the Connected 
Car Requiring Scale and Diverse Skillsets  


The technology for these driver assistance and safety systems is quickly evolving 
from discrete warning and assistance features to more comprehensive, 
integrated, and connected systems. Technology, hardware, and software players 
are entering the market and are helping to accelerate these developments, 
either by transferring their technologies from other industries to automotive or 
by starting new companies to focus on specific new technologies for future 
vehicle applications.


For example, Nvidia, a leading maker of microchips and systems for visual 
computing, got its start making graphics chips for the gaming industry, and then 
branched out into automotive in the 2000s. Its powerful Tegra X1 chip can 
process images from various data sources, such as cameras, radar, and laser 
imaging, and enable machine learning for automotive systems. Companies like 
Nvidia leverage their years of experience in their fields to gain a foothold in 
automotive and quickly reach a high degree of scale and maturity.


This makes it almost impossible for OEMs and traditional suppliers to develop 
competing technology on their own, and as a result, many of them must access 
such technologies by other means. In 2015, for example, automotive supplier 
Continental acquired ASC’s Hi-Res 3D Flash Lidar business and its technology for 
using laser beams to measure distances to cars and other objects on the road, 
expanding its portfolio of sensor technologies. In 2015, Delphi made a strategic 
investment in Quanergy with the goal of jointly developing a low-cost Lidar 
system, a core technology needed for mass-market autonomous vehicles. And 
Valeo signed a technology cooperation agreement with Mobileye, also in 2015, 
to develop front-facing camera systems and sensor fusion. (Sensor fusion is a 
technology that analyzes data drawn from a variety of sensors and other 
monitoring sources to provide more comprehensive insight — for example, using 
multiple cameras to simulate depth perception).

Major Technology Heavyweights 
Strategically Going After the Space


Gentex wants to position its mirrors as a location for housing technology (e.g., garage door openers and E-Z 
passes), yet conveniently excludes any of the serious players in the tech laden camera / display space as 
competitors.  Based on our conversations with an industry consultant we believe that Gentex will increasingly be 
competing with tech companies entering the automotive display space.  As cars continue to become more digital 
and connected, expect to see other tech giants throwing their hats in the ring.

Gentex’s analysts are divided between “Buy” and “Neutral” recommendations, and have an average price 


target of approximately $20.75 per share, suggesting 12% upside. None of the analysts have critically 


analyzed the Company’s off-market gross margins with enhanced due diligence such as a product teardown 


or FOIA requests. We also do not believe the analysts are discounting the potential for permanent product 


displacement of mirrors. We expect a substantial re-rating lower in the share price.

101


Pay Attention To The Bofa/ML Analyst


“Are we there yet?..Yes, and heading into the Summer of our discontent” - June 15, 2017 


“Our $11 price objective on GNTX shares is based on a P/E multiple of roughly 8x a 


blended average of our 2018e & 2019e estimates, which is consistent with an 


EV/EBITDA of around 4.5x. This is below the company's historical range, which we 


believe is warranted given the US/NA cycle is now entering a downturn, in our view, 


which should pressure profits across the automotive value chain, including for GNTX.   


In addition, we believe an 8x P/E multiple, in line with the supplier average, is 


more appropriate than GNTX's 25x long-run average P/E given increasing RCD 


competition and the potential displacement of the rear-view mirror in lieu of 


camera based systems.”


Kudos to Analyst John Murphy for making a prescient call on Gentex, and putting a price target of $11 


(or >40% below market) on its share price. Murphy’s call is based primarily on industry cycle dynamics 


and the heightened risk of its product being displaced. 


When you layer on top of this call, our forensic analysis suggesting severe financial misstatement, 


the $11 price target looks all the more realistic.
102


Gentex Trading On Inflated Financials, 
And Belief Its Product Won’t Be Displaced


Gentex trades at a slight premium to peers on its P/E and a significant premium to peers on its revenues. This is 


premium is unjustified relative to its below average earnings growth expectations, and high likelihood of financial 


misstatement causing upwards of 50% overstatement of earnings.

We normalize Gentex’s inventory 
assuming it should have grown in line 
with sales and accounts receivable. 


This gets us to a $120m inventory over-
capitalization, which we tax-effect at 


32%, we estimate. We believe Gentex’s 
multiple should be at the low end of 


peer ranges to discount 1) its high risk 
of financial misstatement and 2) the 


risk of ultimate product displacement

Nobody in the auto supply industry is 
capable of achieving 40% gross margins 


similar to Gentex’s reported results. 
The global industry average is 20%. We 


give Gentex the benefit of the doubt 
and make this our lower bound 


estimate. We also apply the same P/E 
multiple range as above


$ in millions, except per share amounts


We arrive at our price targets by adjusting Gentex’s earnings for evidence of overstatement through aggressive 


inventory capitalization methods designed to bolster reported gross margins.

Recap of Short Thesis


Interior/Exterior Mirrors Come With Disadvantages And May Become Made Obsolete: 


Side mirrors increase drag and reduce fuel efficiency, while interior mirrors can block forward field vision, and 


backward vision can be obstructed by headrests, passengers and cargo 


Automotive Technology Revolution Underway, Where Does Gentex Stand: Autonomous driving and 


connected car trends call into question Gentex’s vision of the mirror as the future car technology platform. As 


cameras and other technology dominates car necessities, Gentex’s competitive universe will broaden (example: 


Samsung/Harman, Panasonic/Ficosa). Its core competency of mirrors may be deemed irrelevant


Gentex’s Management Has A Credibility Issue: Questionable IPO history that its CEO would rather avoid. 


Documented inconsistencies made about its business organization to regulators, and proprietary claims made 


about its product easily refuted by product teardown analysis. Questionable related-party HomeLink deal


Evidence Mounting of the Auto Cycle Ending and Gentex Playing Defense: New auto sales are slowing, while 


used car prices are declining. Auto suppliers are particularly exposed to industry corrections. Gentex is already 


signaling a slowdown of SmartBeam, its former growth driver, making tax rate adjustments to bolster EPS, and 


accelerating debt reduction while cash flows remain positive


Evidence of Capex + Inventory Inflation Explain Its Outlier 40% Gross Margins: Documents show inflation of 


Gentex’s recent $60m+ North Riley Campus, with costs 90%+ overestimate, square footage inflated 40% and 


capacity below plan. Long-term Inventory growth of 3x vs. sales and accounts receivables a major red flag


Significant Governance Concerns: CEO is also Chairman and has stacked the Board with allies, including two 


entrenched audit committee members, one with ties to Arthur Andersen, not likely to question the status quo. 


Insider ownership in decline with large CEO stock sales below current prices. Beware of negligible audit fees


40% to 80% Downside Risk:  Gentex’s valuation assumes it can sustain high single digit growth, and fails to 


account for the high potential for financial misstatement and its product eventual displacement. Listen carefully to 


the analyst at Bofa/ML with an underweight and $11 price target
