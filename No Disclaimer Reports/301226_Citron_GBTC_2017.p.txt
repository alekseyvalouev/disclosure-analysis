Last week, Citron Research put out a tweet about the
Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC)
that discussed its net asset value/share price.


We believe it is important to clarify this point, and at
the same time, illustrate more risks in owning this
trust.


As of the writing of this article, here is what the math
behind GBTC looks like:


BEING GENEROUS,
GBTC SHOULD TRADE
AT A 10% PREMIUM TO
NAV: $500
For Immediate Release -September 5, 2017


The 70% premium is 80%
higher than the historical


Last Friday, Andrew Left
from Citron was on CNBC,



https://citronresearch.com/
NAV premium of 46.8%
of the GBTC, which was
already ridiculous.


as respected CNBC
commentator Guy Adami
asked, “Can the same
argument (against the
GBTC) be made with GLD
for Gold??

bitcoin-trust.html   (Click to 2:15)


His answer should make every GBTC investor slam the
sell button.


While GBTC is trading between 70-
90% above the NAV of its holdings,
GLD is at .0028%!  Yes, you are reading
that correctly.


Here is a list of what other commodity
trusts are trading: GBTC:  70-90%
(depending on whether Bitcoin cash is
distributed as a dividend or not)


Instrument Premium
to NAV


SPY 0.0015%


GLD 0.0280%


IAU (ishares gold
ETF)


0.0360%


SLV 0.0100%


PPLT (Platinum) 0.1340%


Paladium

THE WIDOW MAKER
Unlike the other ETF’s, which are actually a rational way to own the underlying
commodity, this should make any GBTC shareholder shit in their pants.


GBTC cannot even get insurance on their holdings, as per their last SEC filing, June
30, 2017.


As stated in the last SEC filing:


“We have been advised that our Custodian did not renew its insurance
coverage.  If our Custodian fails to adequately insure the bitcoins in its
custody, this may negatively impact our ability to operate and an investment
in the shares.”


https://www.otcmarkets.com/financialReportViewer?symbol=GBTC&id=176856


At the time, Bitcoin was trading at $2,200.  If they couldn’t get insurance at $2,200
per coin, they definitely can’t get it at $4,200.


The quarterly filing goes on and states directly:


“There is a risk that some or all of the Trust’s bitcoins could be lost or stolen .
bitcoin transactions are irrevocable.  … Stolen or incorrectly transferred
bitcoin may be irretrievable.”


https://www.otcmarkets.com/financialReportViewer?symbol=GBTC&id=176856


This whole vehicle can go to ZERO if there is a: Rogue employee, Computer Error, or
Successful System Hack. The filing also warns insurance has become “Unavailable
for our Custodian.”


IF SOMETHING IS SO DANGEROUS
THAT IT UNINSURABLE, DO YOU
WANT TO OWN IT?  WORSE, DO YOU
WANT OWN A FUND THAT OWNS IT,
WHILE PAYING A PRICE 70% HIGHER
THAN WHAT THE UNDERLYING ASSET
IS ACTUALLY WORTH?
