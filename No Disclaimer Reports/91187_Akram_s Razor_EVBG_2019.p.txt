EVBG


Everbridge reported a headline beat yesterday combined with an equal tiny raise
against the backdrop of a notable miss in billings. This is normally concerning for
any high multiple stock.


Management compounded the matter further with Q3 guidance including revenue
from an acquisition announced Friday that is still not fully closed. This is a red flag.


Everbridge valuation compared to SAAS peers is now well above the range and
stock needs to rerate 25-30% lower. I will be adding to the short on the open.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4282181-short-everbridge-no-excuses-in-saas 2/7


I shorted some Everbridge over the past few weeks. I got familiar with this name during
my work on Twilio and Pagerduty, and frankly during my due diligence felt this was a lot
more services than software as far as SAAS names go. Nothing to really strongly dislike
about the biz, but it was on my radar in case the valuation ballooned. The main reason
for my interest was because one of its main growth aspiration products was in the now
increasingly crowded Oncall/IT Alerting space (see Pagerduty thesis if you want my take
there). That combined with the possibility that the SAAS momentum crowd would pile
into the name in a typical late cycle waterfall fashion was enough to put it on the radar.
Anyway, as I’m constantly evaluating a certain part of my SAAS short exposure to
exploit quant inefficiencies in the sector, Everbridge’s 50% appreciation over the past
few months moved it near the top of my list.


At my current cost basis I am short Everbridge at roughly 5% discount to the EV/Sales
multiple Twilio was trading at two weeks ago despite Twilio organically growing at pretty
much twice the rate and carrying a similar profitability profile. I also was effectively
getting some exposure to the Oncall competition thesis I’ve been playing in Pagertduty
in a name whose core biz is growing in the high teens. I kind of viewed that as
optionality on a disappointment in billings in the next quarter or two. The short also
provided some pair appeal to me in case Twilio got much cheaper and I wanted to
hedge out my exposure in a market neutral manner.


If your not that familiar with Everbridge, this is what a revenue snapshot of the business
looks like.


Everbridge 2016 2017 2018


Total Revenue $76.8ml $104.3ml $147ml


Mass Notification $66ml $77.1ml $91.1ml


Non-Mass Notification $10.8ml $16.9ml $42.7ml

Not exactly the type of numbers you’d associate with a 22x trailing EV/Sales stock. The
core mass notification biz has grown 18% and 17% the last two years. Overall revenue
has been boosted by other products including population alerting, safety connect, CEM,
IT Alerting, and visual commander. If you are not familiar with Everbridge, this does
initially seem like a lot to digest product wise but in reality there is decent overlap here.
Everbridge is no doubt faring well in their niche of critical event alerting monitoring. A
theme that comes constantly to mind every time there is a mass shooting or natural
disaster. The bull case on it is this is secular and assumes that things like the EU’s
Electronic Communications Code Directive will also drive demand for their public
alerting products. I’m really not going to disagree with that, again this is more of a
services biz with low margins. Like I could own it 5x sales and maybe even 10x forward
sales in a growthy phase, but I’m not paying Twilio/Atlassian/Workday multiples for this.
And really you just need to look at the multiples they are paying to acquire revenue to
grasp this.


January 2017- Acquired IDV for $21.3ml-operational visualization software threat
assessment (their VCC product).IDV’s proforma disclosed revenue for 2016 was
$10.3ml, so they paid 2x sales.


2018- 3 acquisitions for $36.2ml consideration. The notable one here was Norway
based Unified Messaging Systems (UMS) for $31.9ml. This is now their population
alerting product. In the 2018 10-k, Everbridge discloses that their 2018 acquisitions
contributed 9% of net revenues or $13.2ml. So they paid 2.6x revenue.


Aug 2, 2018- They acquired threat intelligence firm NC4 for $83ml in cash and
stock. More on this in a second as it came oddly one day before earnings and thus
raised some red flags for me.

Now, I’m not going to fault Everbridge for paying 2x sales and selling stock at 10x-20x
sales. If investors can’t drill down into a space and understand a services businesses
like this, it’s not their fault. And as I’ve seen many crazy inefficiencies in SAAS
valuations over the past year that can only be explained by quantitative driven
approaches driving most investing in the sector, I can see the value in maintaining an
overall growth rate in 30%+ range with complementary product tuck in deals. However,
the future expected margin profile here is not exactly like your typical SAAS if you build
it profits will rain in story. Like the NC4 business, which I’m familiar with, they just bought
is not high-tech. This is a bunch of bright college grads on alternating 12-hour shifts
sitting in a room filled with televisions monitoring the news and Twitter for incidents, and
then churning out threat assessment analyst reports. You don’t pay huge sales multiples
for this type of revenue. And their most compelling non-mass notification businesses
(Safety Connect/ IT Alerting-I estimate at 20% 2018 revenue) have plenty of
competition. So yeah, this felt like a good feeler short.


As I’ve stated in the past, I don’t like shorting only on valuation. The feeler short element
was enough to get me into the name, and the SAAS wars theme and the fact that
Everbridge Oncall pricing has to head south was an added boost. But what I really liked
about this short was that the growth dynamic into this quarter as far as SAAS names go
looked transitory. So, short of a notable beat and raise, I thought that the multiple would
come in some. Nothing fancy, but still worth the exposure. Then on Friday in the midst of
all the Pinterest hoopla and market mayhem Everbridge announced their biggest
acquisition to date. Suffice to say I found this odd. Why not wait till earnings on
Monday? Then I read this sentence at the end of the PR…


“While the largest business component has been closed, additional components
are not expected to be closed until the end of the third quarter.”

So, a partially closed acquisition one day before earnings, that to me was a red flag.
Anyone trading SAAS names into earnings knows the recurring nature of subscription
revenue typically means 95% of a quarter is covered. So, the delta to move a stock with
the visibility management has when they guide is extremely small. Outright headline
revenue misses just don’t really happen. Shorts are really about dollar based retention
trends, bookings, and how small the relative beat/raise is relative to historical trends.
With Everbridge announcing a partially completed deal on Friday, the revenues from this
would help offset any other softness in their organic revenue that would show on their
headline guidance. Has the SAAS space gotten that conditioned to the market
behavior?


You be the judge…..


Consensus estimates for Everbridge Q3 guidance were $51.4ml, and for the full year
$198ml. Everbridge guided to $51.45ml and $198.7ml. The Q2 beat of $400k was the
lowest beat Everbridge has had as a public company, and this dates back to when the
quarterly run rate was less than $20ml. So, on a historical trend basis this is the
definition of a disappointment for a high multiple name. Basically, as far as SAAS names
go things were clearly a lot softer than management expected in the quarter. And the
one place where you can’t hide that is in deferred revenue. In 2017, EVBG deferred
revenue increased 7.5% sequentially from q1 to q2. In 2018, EVBG deferred revenue
increased more than 15% from q1 to q2. This year deferred revenue was slightly down
from Q1. So, calculated billings missed big in the quarter, and that was obvious from the
press release. This stuff happens from time to time to any good business so not the end
of the world, but when you have a short-thesis on some potential bookings softness
because competitive dynamics may have recently changed a bit for one or two of their
products this is a different story.


Then the conference call started…..


They had this to say about guidance and the NC4 deal:

The acquisition includes NC4's risk center and emergency operations center solutions,
as well as the NC4 brand, but does not include NC4 cybersecurity, our law enforcement
solution. Given that certain components of the transaction will not be finalized until the
end of the third quarter and that purchase accounting cannot be completed until then,
we will not be updating our guidance for the acquisition until our third quarter call. That
said, as we indicated in our press release last week, we expect the transaction to be
accretive to non-GAAP financial results within 12 months.


Now, let me turn to our outlook for third quarter and our increased guidance for the year.
We had a solid first half and are optimistic about the second half of the year. Our outlook
for the rest of the year includes a minimal contribution to revenue for known NC4
contracts, most of which will be recognized in Q4. At the same time, we started incurring
expenses related to NC4 this month, which are also considered in our guidance.


This is odd to say the least as far as SAAS names go. They are not updating guidance
till purchase accounting complete which is normal, but then they are including revenue
from "known NC4 contracts" in the current guide?? Most of which will be recognized in
Q4? So, there is some in q3 as well?
