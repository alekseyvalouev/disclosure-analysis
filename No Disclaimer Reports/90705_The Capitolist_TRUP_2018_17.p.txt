TRUP


In a previous report I highlighted that Synchrony Financial (SYF) had purchased
Pets Best for what looked like a significant discount to where Trupanion is trading.


A second acquisition from an equally savvy buyer, White Mountains (WTM) gives
us even more details about the true valuations that financial buyers are willing to
place on pet insurance.


The result of some simple math yields a 70% decline for Trupanion's value in the
eyes of intelligent financial buyers.


On April 1st, NSM Insurance Group (a self described leader in the development,
implementation, marketing and underwriting of industry-specific insurance programs)
bought Embrace Pet Insurance.

Embrace Pet Insurance is a Cleveland based pet insurance company that had 110,000
beneficiaries at the end of 2017 (according to Today Veterinary Business) - if we
assume that the company grew with the market (at roughly 15%) they should have been
servicing ~126,500 beneficiaries at the end of 2018.


NSM Insurance Group is a subsidiary of White Mountains Insurance Group (WTM) and
a brief perusal of the WTM 10k reveals that NSM spent $73 Million on the Embrace
acquisition.


The Combination of the ~126,500 pets and the known purchase price of $73 million
yields a price per pet of $577.08, which is significantly lower than the $2,368.55/pet that
TRUP is currently valued at.

This comports nicely with the assumptions I used in my previous report when Pets Best
was purchased a few months prior. As a reminder my previous report titled, "Trupanion:
Industry M&A Comp Puts $9 Price Target On The Stock" I showed how significant the
downside might be in NASDAQ:TRUP. In fact those assumptions put an implied value of
$9.03/share on the subscription business - which now look lofty after reading the WTM
form 10k.
