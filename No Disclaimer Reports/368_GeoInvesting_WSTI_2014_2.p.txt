Windstream Technologies
(WSTI) – Response to SEC
Concerns Seemingly
Insufficient
July 2, 2014 By stoup


On 7/1/2014 we published our article on WSTI, part of our
findings were that:


The SEC sends letters regarding disclosures that investors
can review by observing “upload” filings on a company’s
SEC page. The SEC has been sending WSTI (pre and post-
reverse merger) letters asking for clarity on disclosures.
There have been two relevant SEC “upload” letters after
WSTI’s reverse merger:


September 16, 2013 – SEC requested answers to 26
questions
October 28, 2013 – SEC requested answers to 11
questions


A common characteristic that exists in the stories of
companies that we believe are pump and dumps are
attempts by management to portray a sense of legitimacy
by associating the company with recognizable
names/enterprises.


WSTI’s filed its first 8k regarding its reverse merger on
5/28/2013.  On 8/16/2013 and on 10/2/2013 the company
filed amendments to this 8k which contained a screenshots
of IKEA.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution


WindStream is planning to outsource both the
installation as well as ongoing maintenance of
installations as required. As a result of the
interest in renewable energy solutions, we
believe that there is a ready network of wind
power installer and maintenance providers who
can accommodate the Company’s installation
requirements on an ad hoc basis. As the
Company continues to scale, we will explore the
cost benefit of creating an “in house” resource to
manage installations and maintenance.


In the SEC letter on 10/25/2013 , the SEC  issued the
following statement:


“We note your response to comment 12 in our
letter dated September 13, 2013 and your
response that the amendment has been revised
to remove the reference pictures. We also note
that your amendment includes a picture of IKEA.
Please discuss whether you have any agreements
with such company or revise to remove the
picture.”

5/23/2018 Windstream Technologies (WSTI) - Response to SEC Concerns Seemingly Insufficient | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/windstream-technologies-wsti-response-to-sec-concerns-seemingly-insufficient/ 3/4


Since this SEC inquiry  on 10/25/2013,  the company has
 filed multiple  8k/As  relating to its reverse merger:


11/1/2013 8k/a pg 12


12/6/2013 8k/a pg 12


Yet it appears that none of them offered an explanation or
commentary on whether or not WSTI has any agreement
or relationship with IKEA.  Yes, the picture is still
present in these filings. Furthermore, there have been
no additional amendments filed since 12/6/2013 that
pertain to the reverse merger .
