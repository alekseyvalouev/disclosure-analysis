We Are Short Shares of Globalstar, Inc. (GSAT) 


 GSAT is the #4 largest Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) firm, selling voice and data 
products in the niche market for satellite phones and similar devices 


 $3.6B market cap, $4.1B EV, ~$88mm LTM revenues 


 Only purported justification for outrageous valuation: TLPS / spectrum “asset” 


 Bulls believe that TLPS, upon approval, will be worth billions of dollars. The reality is 
that TLPS, upon approval, will be worthless: 


 TLPS merely provides one additional licensable channel in 2.4GHz, when there are already 


25 channels available for free, such that any network engineer using modern technology and 


best practices can solve co-channel interference, or “Wi-Fi congestion”, in even the highest-


density environments 


 TLPS will never be commercially viable, and the concept has been dismissed by virtually 


every subject-matter expert we’ve spoken with 


 Outside of TLPS, Globalstar’s spectrum is worthless, due to specific characteristics 
unique to GSAT’s frequencies 


 GSAT is deeply indebted and will likely violate its financial covenants 


 Kerrisdale estimates an equity FV of $0, or 100% downside

Warning: Spectrum Stories Have a Way of Not Coming True  


GSAT bulls had better hope that this time is different
GSAT and Its Spectrum: An Introduction
Page 8 


Spectrum 101: Some of the Basics 


 Wireless communications use specific chunks, or “bands”, of electromagnetic 
spectrum to send signals 


 Spectrum utilized by a variety of users, including radar, GPS, TV broadcasting, etc. 


 Frequencies expressed in millions or billions of cycles per second (MHz or GHz)
Page 9 


Spectrum 101: Cellular and Wi-Fi 


 Cellular phone service and Wi-Fi both use a variety of bands to transmit signals 


 Bands defined by a specific range of frequencies (i.e. “700MHz band”) 


 Often further subdivided into “blocks” or “channels” 


 Spectrum can be “licensed” (exclusive to the licensee) or “unlicensed” (public) 


 Example: AT&T holds the license to the 700MHz B block in the New York area 


 Wi-Fi uses unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4GHz “ISM” band and 5GHz “U-NII” bands 


 The Federal Communications Commission determines who gets to use which bands 
of spectrum and for what purposes 


 The FCC regularly changes the conditions under which different users utilize different bands 


of spectrum, with the goal of maximizing public good 


 i.e. FCC revoked Lightsquared’s ability to use its spectrum, because it interfered with GPS 


 When the FCC devises rules on how spectrum may be used, it issues a “Notice of Proposed 


Rulemaking”, requesting comments from all interested parties 


 No one “owns” spectrum 


 The FCC has enormous discretion to modify and revoke licenses
Page 10 


Spectrum 101: A Brief History of Satellite Spectrum 


 In the late 1990s, numerous Mobile Satellite Services (“MSS”) firms emerged to 
provide satellite phone and data service 


 The FCC gave MSS carriers free spectrum to use for mobile satellite services 


 These companies invested billions of dollars to launch satellites into space, but 
realized too late that “terrestrial” mobile service (e.g. Verizon) superior to satellite 


 Virtually all MSS carriers went bankrupt in early 2000s 


 Satellite phones became a niche product used only by customers who were out of the range 


of cell phone coverage areas, like drillship crewmen, mountain climbers, etc.  


 Disappointed by the prospects for their satellite operations, MSS carriers began 
lobbying the FCC to allow them to re-purpose their spectrum for terrestrial usage 


 In midtown Manhattan, where no one would use a satellite phone, MSS carriers asked the 


FCC to allow them to use their spectrum to provide cell phone or broadband coverage, 


utilizing land-based base stations (i.e. cell towers) instead of satellites 


 FCC faced a dilemma: 


 The problem: Terrestrial cell companies like AT&T and Verizon paid for their spectrum via 


auctions, whereas MSS carriers were given their spectrum for free 


 The solution: Allow MSS to re-purpose their spectrum on earth for terrestrial usage, but 


require them to maintain their satellite operations 


 MSS carriers were required to maintain spare satellites, provide coverage in all 50 states, etc.
Page 11 


GSAT's Spectrum 


 GSAT is the exclusive licensee to the following spectrum for terrestrial usage: 


 7.775 MHz of spectrum between 1610 MHz and 1617.775 MHz  


 This spectrum resides in the same band as LightSquared’s spectrum, which as we’ll 


discuss later renders this spectrum relatively worthless for terrestrial purposes 


 11.5 MHz of spectrum between 2483.5 MHz and 2495 MHz 


 This is the spectrum which forms the underpinning for GSAT’s valuation 





 2003 


2008 
 


The FCC created framework of conditions under which MSS carriers like 


GSAT could re-purpose their satellite spectrum for terrestrial purposes 
 


The FCC authorizes GSAT to lease its spectrum to its newly created 


partner, Open Range Communications 


2010 Open Range was a complete failure and FCC revoked GSAT’s right to use satellite spectrum for terrestrial usage, until it came up with a better idea
Page 12 


GSAT’s Better Idea 


2011 


2012 


2012 


2013 


2014 


DISH buys two defunct MSS companies (Terrestar and DBSD) 


out of bankruptcy 


FCC grants DISH’s request to convert the acquired spectrum to 


fully terrestrial use and waives requirements to maintain satellite 


business 


In November 2012, GSAT petitions the FCC to allow it to use its 


spectrum for cellular usage, like DISH, and for a new offering 


called Terrestrial Low-Power Service (“TLPS”)  


FCC disregards GSAT’s request to re-purpose satellite spectrum 


for cellular usage, but issues Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 


(“NPRM”) on TLPS, soliciting comments from interested parties 


Comment period for NPRM closed in June 2014, and the public 


currently awaits the FCC’s next actions on the topic
Page 13 


GSAT’s Spectrum in Context (to Scale) 














 The GSAT spectrum story has quietly evolved over time 


 Originally: turn red into blue (ie. Open Range, 2012 FCC petition) 


 Now: turn red into gray (TLPS is a paid Wi-Fi channel) 


 (Very different propositions, yet bulls use the same comps)

A Closer Look Into TLPS
Page 17 


What Is GSAT’s TLPS Concept? 


 If the FCC authorizes Globalstar’s “Terrestrial Low Power Service” (TLPS), GSAT 
would use its spectrum to create a new “channel” for Wi-Fi transmissions 


 What is TLPS?  


 TLPS is a Wi-Fi channel composed of GSAT’s licensed spectrum (between 2483.5 MHz and 


2495 MHz) and a neighboring unlicensed band (between 2473 MHz and 2483.5 MHz) 


 GSAT would not have exclusive access to neighboring band 


 Shared with traditional Wi-Fi, Bluetooth devices, etc. 


 TLPS is nothing more than one exclusive, licensable Wi-Fi channel 


 Unfortunately for Globalstar, there are 25 other free Wi-Fi channels already available (3 in 


2.4GHz and 22 in 5GHz), with potentially more on the way  


 As we’ll demonstrate, 25 channels are more than enough to provide fast Wi-Fi in even the 


highest-density Wi-Fi deployments
Page 18 


Why Does GSAT Say We Need TLPS? 


 Below are excerpts from GSAT’s FCC filings and website: 


 “The Commission’s terrestrial low power rules would deliver substantial and immediate 


benefits to consumers… by almost immediately expanding the nation’s wireless broadband 


capacity and alleviating the worsening Wi-Fi traffic jam in the 2.4 GHz band. Accelerating 


Internet usage and resulting congestion have diminished the quality of Wi-Fi service at 


high-traffic “hotspots,” and Wi-Fi has become an unreliable way to access broadband in 


many urban environments.” 


 “TLPS would deliver substantial public interest benefits by adding to the nation’s supply of 


broadband spectrum, helping to alleviate the worsening Wi-Fi traffic jam, and expanding 


wireless broadband capacity for American consumers.” 


 “The nation is out of Wi-Fi spectrum. The proliferation of Wi-Fi devices together with mass 


consumer adoption has resulted in a "Wi-Fi Traffic Jam" with more data being transported 


over Wi-Fi than any other medium. Most consumers encounter the "Jam" when attempting 


to download mobile content in densely populated settings such as airport terminals, 


apartment buildings, school campuses, or a favorite coffee shop located on a busy street 


corner.” 


 Globalstar makes it clear that the main thrust of TLPS is to alleviate “congestion” and 
“traffic jams” in current Wi-Fi deployments 


TLPS supposedly solves the Wi-Fi congestion epidemic
Page 19 


What Benefits Does TLPS Not Offer? 


Companies already provide private, national and fast networks without TLPS 


 Creating a “private” Wi-Fi network 


 Wi-Fi networks are generally already private! Authorized users only 


 Creating a “national” Wi-Fi network 


 Has nothing to do with licensed vs. unlicensed spectrum 


 US cable co’s (e.g. Comcast) already building out huge hotspot footprints with 


existing technology and spectrum 


 Large Wi-Fi networks already popular in Europe (Fon, The Cloud…) 


 (Who would pay for all the equipment? Where would it go?) 


 Creating a “lightning-fast” Wi-Fi network 


 Maximum speed would be no better than existing 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (e.g. 802.11n) 


 Maximum speed would be substantially lower than next-gen Wi-Fi (802.11ac) 


 (802.11ac exclusive to 5GHz, would not work with TLPS) 


 Faster service only relative to a highly congested network

Is Wi-Fi Congestion Actually a Major Problem? 


GSAT paints a dire picture of the Wi-Fi status quo… 


 GSAT and its promoters: of course it is!

Is Wi-Fi Congestion Actually a Major Problem? 


 If Wi-Fi congestion is so bad, how do you explain the new SF 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium: 


























 “Levi's will offer free Wi-Fi, which allows all 60k+ fans to simultaneously connect. Its 
Wi-Fi infrastructure is designed to be 30 times faster than any other stadium” 


(bit.ly/49ers-60kfans) 


 In home opener, 30k+ of 71k fans at stadium connected to the Wi-Fi network, with 
peak usage of 19k fans just before kickoff 


 One commentator estimated: “40,000 people could live-stream a movie over the 
Internet while watching a football game.” (bit.ly/40k-livestream)

Expert Views on TLPS, Part 1 


“If it [the TLPS proposal] went through, no one would care.” 


 —head of wireless/mobile advisory firm 





“The people you are talking to are full of it. Unlicensed [spectrum] is 


nowhere near exhaustion…On top of that, FCC is bending over 


backwards to give us tons of additional spectrum.” 


 —senior technical leader at top mobile-networking firm 





“If performance is the issue, why aren’t we moving to 5 GHz? … This is 


somebody’s engineering solution looking for a business problem to solve 


that doesn’t understand how these things actually are regulated.” 


—engineer and former voting member of Wi-Fi standards body
Page 27 


Expert Views on TLPS, Part 2 


[Q. Do you think there’s a big [Wi-Fi] interference issue?...Does that sound like 


a real business problem to you?] 


“The answer to that, and how I advise clients, is “no.” Interference is the direct 


result of not understanding how to design the environment to achieve the 


operational parameters which you’re trying to have implemented. If you don’t – 


for example, if you don’t design to the right signal-to-noise ratio, you’re going 


to have interference. If you do…you don’t have a problem. I’ve been designing 


networks for 30 years, and when we’re doing mission-critical wireless designs 


this isn’t a problem. So when did this just start coming up? This is 


marketing…At 5GHz I’ve got 26 different channels, and we’re not seeing any 


issues being able to move throughout those bands anywhere. And even if I did 


have adjacent channel interference or capability issues, proper design of the 


signal-to-noise ratios and the transmit power associated with the access point 


is how we fix those problems…. So there are a lot of tools that we’ve always 


used to be able to solve these problems. If you don’t use the tools, then yeah, 


you can create a bad network. Geez, I can create a bad Ethernet network too! 


… Interesting thought process, but mostly marketing fluff.”

What is a Wi-Fi “Channel”? 


 A Wi-Fi channel is a band of spectrum frequencies, typically 20MHz wide, across 
which Wi-Fi signals are transmitted between “access points” (i.e. routers) and “user 


devices” (i.e. smartphones, laptops, etc.) 


Internet signals come in through 


wired cable / fiber provided by Time 


Warner, Verizon FiOS, Comcast, etc. 


Modem 


Wi-Fi “access points” 


transmit signals to and 


receive signals from user 


devices 


Wi-Fi signals are transmitted from Access Points to 


User Devices across a “channel”, which is a 


~20Mhz band in the electromagnetic spectrum  


“User devices” include 


smartphones, tablets, 


laptops, etc.
Page 29 


Graphic Representation of GSAT’s TLPS Concept 


 The 2.4GHz unlicensed band is used by Wi-Fi. In the U.S., users predominantly 
transmit signals on channels 1, 6, and 11 


 TLPS would be a 4th non-overlapping channel (called channel 14) between 2473MHz 
to 2495MHz, and would be exclusive to GSAT and its customers

What Exactly is Wi-Fi Congestion? 


 Wi-Fi congestion is more commonly called "Co-channel interference” 


 Co-channel interference results when there are too many signals on a single channel 


 The issue: too many devices trying to share a single channel in a single location 


 Too many users on one access point or too many access points sharing a channel 


 Wi-Fi signals follow a ‘politeness protocol’  APs / user devices scan channels to see 
if there are other signals on channel before transmitting 


 Wi-Fi’s Politeness Protocol = LISTEN BEFORE YOU TALK!!!  


 Many signals on channel  APs / user devices keep waiting and waiting  slow speeds 


If multiple access points 


are all using the same 


channel, and many user 


devices (i.e. 20+) are 


utilizing substantial 


bandwidth at the same 


time on that channel, co-


channel interference can 


cause slow Wi-Fi

How Do You Solve Co-Channel Interference? 


 Unlike cellular signals, Wi-Fi signals travel short distances:  


 Wi-Fi signals typically travel ~100 feet, whereas cellular 


signals travel 1+ mile 


 If access points are 300 feet from each other, they won’t 


necessarily detect each other 


 A channel can comfortably handle ~30 user devices

Channels 


 There are 25 different channels that can be used 


 3 in 2.4GHz, 22 in 5GHz 


 Because Wi-Fi signals travel short distances, access points 
can be placed far enough away from one another such that 


channels can be re-used 


 Power of access points can be turned down and artificial / 
natural barriers utilized to further prevent channel overlap

Channel Reuse, in Picture Form 


 Below is a 1-6-11 channel reuse pattern 


http://blogs.aerohive.com/blog/the-wireless-lan-training-blog/wifi-back-to-basics-24-ghz-channel-planning 


 As Wi-Fi has become more popular, it’s become obvious that deployments would 
benefit from having more than 3 channels to reuse. The solution? 5 GHz!
Page 39 


Illustrative Example: Access Points in an Auditorium 


 Below is an illustrative example of access points in an auditorium 


 Each circle refers to an access point’s range, and the numbers in the circle refer to 
the 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels on each access point 


 A typical access point can easily handle 20-100 user devices
Page 40 


Examples of Channel Re-Use Wi-Fi deployment 


 By deploying numerous access points that each have limited ranges, and having 
access points utilizing different channels, and benefitting from the fact that each 


access point can typically handle 30+ user devices, “Wi-Fi congestion” is a problem 


that’s solved routinely by network administrators all over the world 


 Because access points can have limited ranges, power levels can be reduced, and 
barriers can be utilized to block signals, channels can be re-used many times in the 


same environment 


 Examples 


 We spoke with the network administrator of a major university, and in their main 


library, the university deploys 26 access points which utilize ~12 channels in both 


2.4Ghz and 5GHz, and provide Wi-Fi services to peak usages of 2,000 students 


 At Interop Las Vegas, 68 APs provided service to a maximum of 1,496 concurrent 


users (http://www.theruckusroom.net/2014/06/a-wi-fi-gamble-at-interop.html) 


 Fashion Institute of Technology: network of 1,000 802.11ac APs serving 10,000 


students along with faculty, staff, and a museum with 100,000 annual visitors 


 Sheraton Gateway LAX: 802 guest rooms (500,000+ square feet), covered with 48 


APs

5GHz Provides 22 Channels! And that Will Increase in the Future! 


Regulators are pushing to make 5GHz Wi-Fi spectrum even more abundant 


Source: Andrew von Nagy, “Going Beyond RF Coverage: Designing for Capacity,” from wirelessLAN Professionals Summit 2014 


 5 GHz provides more than enough channels for IT professionals to deploy Wi-Fi in 
even the most high-density, high-use environments 


 Many high-density environments only use 8-12 channels, because they don’t even 
need the remainder 


 The FCC is studying the addition of another ~12 channels in the future

Page 42 


Statistics on 5GHz Usage Today and In the Future 


 5GHz is widely used today, and its use will increase in the future 


 Examples 


 At the Mobile World Congress, 58% of devices at the 2014 Mobile World Congress 


used 5GHz (mobileworldcapital.com/en/article/457) 


 At the Cisco Live 2014 conference, 60% of wireless devices used 5GHz and 80% of 


wireless traffic was transmitted over 5GHz (bit.ly/1vVotoO) 


 At a major sporting and concert venue in Vegas, 5GHz usage was 40% in 2013, 50% 


at beginning of 2014 and ~80% today 


 Commentary 


 “We heavily rely on band select to place as many devices as possible on 5Ghz where 


more channels are available.” –Joe Rogers, Associate Director of Network 


Engineering at University of South Florida (bit.ly/joerogers) 


5GHz is widely used today, and will only be more widely used in the future
Page 43 


5GHz in Practice, in the Words of a Practitioner 


 Below is an excerpt from DigitalAir Wireless Networks, an IT consultancy based in 
the UK, in their “A Quick Guide to 5GHz in the UK” 


Wi-Fi Practitioners are flawlessly deploying Wi-Fi in many high-density settings 


To demonstrate why 5GHz is pretty awesome; imagine 500 people in a single room together all using 


wireless devices. Now lets take an enterprise level access point capable of sensibly handling 50 clients 


on its 2.4GHz radio. With 3 of these in a single room (channels 1, 6 and 11) you have no channel 


overlap and the capacity for 150 clients. But what about the other 350 you ask? Well no problem, lets 


change these 3 access points for dual radio 2.4/5GHz access points. Now each 5GHz radio can take 


on 50 clients too... that results in 300 clients now being looked after by the network. But wait, there are 


still 200 clients not being looked after... The problem is we have used the 3 non-overlapping 2.4GHz 


channels so can't really use them again as it is a single room with no walls to attenuate the signal. 


Have no fear though! This is where the larger number of usable 5GHz channels comes in handy. By 


adding another 4 access points which only have their 5GHz radios switched on you can now handle all 


500 clients and haven't reused any channels anywhere in the room (3 access point radios on 2.4GHz 


and 7 radios on 5GHz). Hurrah! 





Now the above is just a simple example, and assumes that all the devices being used are dual band 


devices that support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Also, in reality with some clever design incorporating a 


mixture of cleverly placed directional access points, the right power levels and various other tricks of 


the trade you may be able to re-use some of your 2.4GHz channels without it being too detrimental but 


hopefully you get the idea.

5GHz Wi-Fi Makes Channel Planning Even Easier 


 Metageek (major producer of Wi-Fi network-analysis tools for IT professionals) 


“The 5 GHz band…is relatively empty” 


5 GHz: “no danger of 


sharing a channel”
Page 45 


Automatic Channel Selection 


 Thus far, we have focused on high-density managed networks with multiple access 
points provided by the same provider 


 What about environments comprised of multiple different parties each utilizing 1 or 2 
access points? 


 i.e. What about co-channel interference in a busy Manhattan street with a McDonald’s, 


Starbucks, Burger King, Pret a Manger, and other parties each with their own access point? 


 Access points utilize automatic channel selection algorithms to scan the surrounding 
area and select channels that are being unused or underutilized 


 i.e. If neighboring access points are utilizing channels 1 & 6, access point selects channel 


11 


 Even the most basic Linksys routers have auto channel selectors: 











 Enterprise access point makers like Ruckus have sophisticated auto channel 
selectors like ChannelFly, that dynamically change channels as usage ebbs and 


flows between different APs: www.ruckuswireless.com/technology/channelfly

Bad Wi-Fi Has Many Possible Causes 


 On average Wi-Fi performs well, but (of course) performance varies 


 Many reasons for bad performance that TLPS can’t address, e.g.: 


 Legacy devices on the network (esp. 802.11b) 


 Low-quality AP or controller hardware 


 Slow backhaul (e.g. old DSL connection) 


 Too many users per access point 


 Badly chosen access-point locations (e.g. placed near barriers) 


 Huge improvements possible with no new spectrum: 


 Starbucks switching to Google/Level 3 for in-store Wi-Fi 


 Expected speed improvement: 10x 


 Aruba Networks field test in Hong Kong university environment 


 “Band steering” toward 5GHz doubled average throughput 


 60% of devices achieved speeds >10 Mbps, up from 20% w/o band steering 








Bad Wi-Fi typically does not have anything to do with “congestion”

Access Point Manufacturers Are Urging Increased Use of 5GHz 


 Access point manufacturers are guiding enterprise users to maximize usage of 5 
GHz and minimize usage of 2.4 GHz: 


Don’t Use 2.4 GHz!! 


“ The multimedia-grade residence hall must use the 5 GHz band as the primary service band for 


students. Using the 5 GHz band as the primary band may be a mindset change for some 


network administrators. However, we must stop thinking of “offloading” the 2.4 band (which 


implies that 2.4 GHz is primary). Instead, we must think of the 2.4 GHz band as the “legacy” or 


safety-net band to provide service to those devices that are not capable of using the extra 


capacity and speeds of 5 GHz. 


The 2.4 GHz band has only three to four low-capacity channels available, and it will never scale 


to deliver high-capacity services. However, the 2.4 GHz band plays a vital role, which is to 


“bridge the gap” and allow legacy and low-speed devices to communicate within the microcell 


infrastructure… Smartphones are easily capable of overwhelming 2.4 GHz channels, so it is a 


good idea to partition their traffic on a separate band.”

 Aruba Networks: “Adaptive Radio Management” (ARM)  “No more RF interference” 


 “ARM’s band steering feature encourages dual-band capable clients to stay on the 5GHz 


band on dual-band APs, freeing up resources on the 2.4GHz band for single-band clients” 


 “Band steering reduces co-channel interference and increases available bandwidth for dual-


band clients, because there are more channels on the 5GHz band than on the 2.4GHz 


band” 


 Ruckus Wireless: “5 Ghz – The Key to Client Density” 


 “[T]he 5 GHz band has much more capacity. Depending on a specific nation’s regulations 


there may be as many as 23 non-overlapping channels available in the 5 GHz spectrum!”

We design for 5-gig exclusively. The 2.4 is an afterthought. … No one 


writes for 2.4 anymore because it’s stupid. The only reason, only only only 


reason, for 2.4 is if you have a device that’s so old it can’t use 5-gig.  





If you call me four years from now and say, “I’ve got this cool idea about 


2.4,” I’d say, “What are we doing in 2.4? We stopped using that years 


ago!” 





I would strongly recommend that Globalstar just give it up and put [the 


spectrum] back in the public domain… but then their investors wouldn’t get 


any cash. But I don’t think they’re going to get any cash anyway!

Cisco: TLPS “Nothing More Than Paid Wi-Fi Offering” 


TLPS is simply one licensable Wi-Fi channel 


Behind Globalstar’s new moniker, TLPS will be nothing more than a 


paid Wi-Fi offering using the legacy IEEE 802.11b/g/n amendments – an 


offering that is only possible because of the happenstance that 


Globalstar’s MSS spectrum is adjacent to the unlicensed commons. … 





While Globalstar has claimed TLPS will offer higher data rates than 


traditional Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz, the Commission should note that Globalstar 


is not proposing here any technological advancement. To the 


contrary, Globalstar’s plan is built around use of the legacy IEEE 


802.11b/g/n amendments. To the extent that Globalstar’s TLPS may offer 


higher speeds, it will simply be because fewer users will be willing to 


pay Globalstar for the privilege of using its spectrum and thus fewer 


users will be sharing Channel 14 compared to other 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 


channels.

Wi-Fi Band with the amazingly unsuccessful business model of Clearwire 


to totally not go bankrupt this time. Globalstar will offer a “terrestrial low-


power service” (TLPS) which it will offer to lease out to people or 


otherwise make money by giving people WiFi they could get for free, but 


make them pay for it. According to Globalstar, TLPS will be infinitely 


superior to cruddy old WiFi because it is “licensed” and therefore “carrier 


grade” and therefore people will totally pay gajillions for this even though 


the thing they like about WiFi is that it’s free and they don’t have to deal 


with a wireless carrier.

Spectrum Valuation
Page 85 


In Response to 2012 Petition, FCC Only Considered TLPS 


 In November 2012, GSAT petitioned the FCC to authorize its spectrum for (1) 
cellular usage, like DISH, and (2) for TLPS, a Wi-Fi like service 


 The FCC disregarded GSAT’s request to re-purpose its satellite spectrum for cellular 
usage 


 Current rulemaking is considering converting GSAT’s spectrum to “Wi-Fi” spectrum, 
NOT cellular spectrum 


 Cellular and Wi-Fi spectrum are highly different from one another, in numerous 
ways, and should be valued very differently
Page 86 


Wi-Fi and Cellular Bands Should be Valued Very Differently 


 The FCC imposes different power restrictions on different bands of spectrum, and 
this is a subject of intense debate in FCC rulemakings 


 The FCC is concerned about licensees of bands interfering with co-licensees of the same 


band, or with neighboring bands 


 Example: AT&T and Sirius fought for more than a decade on power and usage restrictions 


in AT&T’s licensed spectrum in 2.3GHz. Ultimately, AT&T agreed not to use the 10 MHz of 


its 20Mhz of its spectrum that neighbors Sirius’s spectrum, to appease Sirius and FCC 


 TLPS = Terrestrial Low-Power Service 


 Wi-Fi / TLPS signals must be transmitted at much lower power than cellular signals 


 Wi-Fi, and TLPS, power emissions are capped at 4 watts (36 dBm) whereas cell 
towers can typically transmit up to 1,640 watts (62 dBm) 

















Vs. 


Low-Power Wi-Fi 


Access Points 


Higher-Power Cellular

Page 87 


Low Power Means Much Higher Deployment Costs 


 Low power  signals have short range  more “base stations” needed per unit area 
 higher deployment costs 


 Conventional cell towers can transmit at 400x TLPS’s maximum allowable power level 


 National coverage using ~2.4GHz cellular spectrum: tens of thousands of base stations 


 National coverage using Wi-Fi / TLPS: hundreds of millions of access points 


 Too expensive, so one provider will ever offer ubiquitous service 


 The power limits imposed upon GSAT’s spectrum in 2.4 GHz render it worthless 


 Neither cellular providers like Verizon or AT&T nor spectrum aggregators like DISH 


Networks would be interested in spectrum with such onerous power restrictions 


 Likewise, if tech companies like Google, Microsoft or Amazon wanted to purchase 


spectrum for a new innovative use, they would purchase spectrum that does not have 


onerous power restrictions

Why Did FCC Snub GSAT's Request to Use Spectrum for LTE? 


 The FCC never specified precisely why it did not entertain GSAT’s request to utilize 
its spectrum for cellular purposes 


 We believe that the FCC anticipates tremendous difficulties and complications in re-
purposing GSAT’s spectrum for cellular usage: 


Rationale 


Reason 1 High power in GSAT’s 2.4GHz band could cause interference to Wi-Fi 


Reason 2 GSAT must share its spectrum with numerous licensees on TV 


Broadcast Auxiliary Services (BAS) Channel A10 


Reason 3 1.6GHz band is way too close to GPS 


We don’t think GSAT’s 2.4GHz band will ever be authorized for cellular usage
Page 89 


Globalstar Has the Wrong Neighbors 


Like LightSquared, GSAT is much less important than its spectral neighbors 


 GSAT’s 2.4GHz band neighbors unlicensed band used for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, 
microwave ovens and many other devices 


 Given the importance of Wi-Fi and other unlicensed users in 2.4GHz, the FCC would 


likely be highly concerned that potential GSAT cellular signals would cause 


interference to lower-power signals of unlicensed users, including Wi-Fi, at 2483 and 


below 


 FCC has been willing to entertain GSAT’s TLPS proposal because, given its low 


power levels, it likely poses only a modest threat to existing Wi-Fi

The FCC’s View on Interference Issues 


Unlicensed bands = Very important, GSAT Cellular = Not important at all 


 Below is a nuanced discussion of the FCC’s general views on interference issues by 
spectrum users from telecom expert Howard Feld: 





 
FCC’s engineers on spectrum issues are extremely conservative. Indeed, 


I have often argued they are too conservative. This is not because they 


are in the pay of the incumbents, but because they recognize that making 


predictions about possible interference is not nearly the precise science 


that people like to think it is.  So the FCC’s engineers tend to err well on 


the side of caution when setting interference limits. From an engineering 


standpoint, it is easier to loosen interference restrictions later if you were 


too conservative than try to mitigate interference if you were too 


optimistic… The FCC generally tries to balance competing interests, 


taking into consideration things such as how important (economically and 


politically) is the existing service and how useful (from the FCC’s 


perspective) would the new service be.

A Comparison of DISH's Neighbors and Globalstar's Neighbors 


 To better understand why DISH was able to convert its spectrum to cellular 
spectrum, but Globalstar could not, we need to examine the neighboring bands to 


Globalstar’s spectrum: 





DISH’s spectrum neighbored 


either empty bands, other 


cellular providers, or federal 


agencies that were flexible 


about resolving any 


interference issues 





GSAT’s spectrum neighbors 


unlicensed bands that are 


highly used by many different 


types of devices, many of 


which, like Wi-Fi, operate at 


powers much lower than 


cellular signals

Page 92 


What is Globalstar’s 1.6GHz Band Worth? 


GSAT’s spectrum at 1.6GHz is likely worthless 


 Analysts and longs that we have spoken with agree that the 1.6 GHz band is unlikely 
to be worth anything 


 LightSquared precedent renders GSAT’s 1.6GHz spectrum unusable 


 As with the bankrupt LightSquared, GSAT’s uplink band is very close to GPS frequencies 


 Serious interference concerns preclude non-satellite use cases (as even bulls concede) 


 Thus any value that exists resides in GSAT’s 11.5 MHz of 2.4GHz downlink spectrum 


Lightsquared has offered 


to relinquish its spectrum 


at 1545.2-1555.2 for 


terrestrial use given the 


problematic GPS 


interference 


US regulatory agency NTIA 


released letter on July 1 discussing 


how govt engineers at Department 


of Transportation expressed 


numerous concerns over 


Lightsquared using this spectrum 


for terrestrial cellular 


Like 1545-1555, GSAT’s 


16MHz in 1.6 GHz 


neighbors GPS. Even 


Lightsquared’s L-Band at 


1626-1660, which is even 


further from the GPS bands, 


continues to raise numerous 


interference concerns
Page 93 


GSAT Cellular Signals Would Interfere with Co-Licensee BAS 


 GSAT’s license is “co-primary” with ~60 licensees who use the TV Broadcast 
Auxiliary Services (BAS) Channel A10, which operates from 2483.5 to 2500 MHz  


 These broadcasters use Channel A10 primarily for electronic news-gathering (ENG), 


deploying mobile news vans to obtain footage remotely and transmit back to headquarters 


 Examples include ABC affiliate in New York (WABC) and FOX affiliate in LA (KTTV) 


 Low-powered Wi-Fi service may not threaten these A10 licensees, but high-powered 
LTE service clearly would 


 GSAT’s previous partner, Open Range, caused numerous instances of interference 
with BAS A10 operators throughout 2010-2011
Page 94 


Interference Issues with GSAT's Co-Licensee BAS A10, Part 2 


 Licensees exist in key metro areas, including New York, Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, DC, Philadelphia, and Detroit 


 Map below shows the many large areas where Ch A10 licensees are legally entitled 
to interference protection:
Page 95 


Why a "Globalstar LTE" Band Would Never Be Acquired 


 Additional features of the Globalstar LTE band would make GSAT’s spectrum 
unappealing to cellular acquirers 


Rationale 


Reason 1 Onerous power restrictions  deployment costs too high 


Reason 2 Acquirer would likely have to finance the re-location of BAS Channel 


A10 users to another frequency 


Reason 3 Unusable 1.6GHz renders the 2.4GHz spectrum unpaired 


Reason 4 GSAT’s extremely close proximity to Wi-Fi will likely cause “self-


jamming” in resulting smartphones, as well as interference from Wi-Fi 


Reason 5 Acquirer would inherit and have to maintain money-losing satellite 


business 


Reason 6 High frequency 2.4GHz spectrum far less valuable than lower 


frequency spectrum 


Reason 7 With neighbors on either side, GSAT LTE would remain a thin 10MHz 


band forever 


Way too many headaches for 10MHz of unpaired high frequency spectrum

LTE Technical Problems: Self-Jamming 


 Smartphones are already 
jam-packed with many 


different radio systems

 Very easy for LTE radio

LTE Technical Problems: Interference from Wi-Fi

 Looks like you have full bars, but you’d miss 


incoming phone calls 


 Difficult and frustrating for user to assess 


 Already a struggle for bands like Sprint’s in

 LTE receivers are exquisitely sensitive 


 Even when complying with regulatory limits, 


Wi-Fi signals still sound “loud” to LTE 


devices 


 GSAT’s band much closer to Wi-Fi than 
similarly problematic band 


 Challenges thus much worse

For Argument's Sake… 


 We’ve discussed how the FCC has rejected Globalstar’s proposal to authorize its 
spectrum for cellular usage, and we’ve discussed why its spectrum is unlikely to ever 


be considered for cellular usage 


 But hypothetically, if it was, what would it be worth? 


 Even if Globalstar’s spectrum was authorized for cellular usage, GSAT is still 
massively overvalued 


 As we will demonstrate in the following slides, even if GSAT’s spectrum were 


authorized for cellular usage, which we strongly believe it never will be, the stock 


would still be ~5x overvalued! 





Even with cellular approval, GSAT would have 80% downside
Page 100 


How Much Does Spectrum Cost, Anyway? 


GSAT bulls apply precedent pricing arbitrarily… 


 How do you compare the price of, say, the 700MHz A Block license covering 
Honolulu to the AWS-1 B Block license covering Bangor, Maine? 


 A common pricing metric: dollars per MHz-pop 


 Normalizes for 1) bandwidth (in MHz) and 2) covered population (for regional licenses) 


 A recent example: 


 At an FCC auction in February, DISH bought all 176 regional licenses to the AWS H Block 


(1915-1920/1995-2000 MHz) for $1.564B 


 Bandwidth = 10 MHz (5 MHz uplink, 5 MHz downlink) 


 Population = 312,846,492 (US population per FCC, based on 2010 decennial census) 


 Dollars per MHz-pop = $1.564B / (10 MHz x 312.8mm people) = $0.50 


 But what is the “right” $/MHz-pop value to apply to GSAT? 


 Bulls cite an array of precedents covering a wide range of values – from ~$0.20 to ~$2 


 Often take some average (say, $1+) 


 Example: One sell-side target price assumes $1/MHz-pop but considers values as low as 


$0.25

What is GSAT's Market-Implied Spectrum Value? 


 After subtracting an estimated value for the satellite business, we can determine the

 Low-frequency radio waves are more able to penetrate through barriers 


 Better coverage inside buildings

Not a Fan of Models? Just Look at the Best Available Comps… 


GSAT’s own argument: Clearwire & MSV are the best comps 


From a utility perspective a lot of our spectrum abuts Clearwire and 


Sprint’s spectrum and so it is functionally equivalent. Another swath of our 


spectrum abuts MSV and is functionally equivalent there. So again it is 


not clear to me why we would have a spectrum value which was 


substantially different than others.

 Is unlikely to ever be considered for cellular usage by the FCC 


 Would require an acquirer to re-locate BAS Channel A10 licensees 


 Exists in the high frequency 2.4GHz band 


 Would require exquisitely engineered antennae to prevent self-jamming 


 Would receive interference from Wi-Fi 


 Is chained to a money-losing satellite phone business

How Much Do People Value “Better” Wi-Fi Anyway? 


Even industry leaders have struggled to monetize Wi-Fi 


 GSAT bulls must believe that “better” Wi-Fi via TLPS is very valuable 


 Either users pay for it themselves, or someone pays for it on their behalf 


 Either way, users have to ascribe great value to a potentially slightly better Wi-Fi 


experience in certain high-utilization areas 


 Inherently implausible! 


 Few people are willing to pay for Wi-Fi today 


 Example: Boingo (WIFI) 


 Firm with greatest demonstrated ability to monetize Wi-Fi 


 Network (incl. roaming partners): >1 million commercial hotspots worldwide 


 Subscribers: 300,000 (y/y growth rate: -4%) 


 LTM revenue: $112mm 


 Enterprise value: $225mm

Congestion in Practice, Part 3 


 Review by RWTH Aachen and University of Colorado Law School Researchers 


“There is currently no evidence for pervasive Wi-Fi congestion” 


This work was motivated by the many claims that Wi-Fi is congested. We tried 


to understand what this claim might mean, and to test if it was true. We 


discovered that there are many ways to characterize wireless congestion, no 


unanimity on how to characterize service degradation, and little research about 


the connection between congestion and degradation. We concluded that there 


is as yet no hard evidence that congestion is rising to the level that would justify 


regulatory action. 





…The main lesson from this article is that congestion claims are indeed 


like the Emperor’s missing robes. It appears that excessive load is quite 


rarely observed, and very seldom well documented. Where the appropriate 


investment is made in infrastructure, as at the Super Bowl or well-run 


conference venues, lack of spectrum is not the binding constraint.

Bulls Underestimate the Challenges of Rolling Out TLPS 


 GSAT says:  “Globalstar could implement TLPS almost immediately” 


 But what does “implement” mean? 


 Necessary process: 


1. Manufacture TLPS access points 


2. Deploy these TLPS access points 


3. Develop customized “network operating system” to manage APs 


4. Convince original equipment manufacturers (e.g. Apple, HTC, Lenovo) to ask the 


FCC to permit them to update user devices to access Channel 14 


5. Receive FCC approval for individual device models 


6. Get users to accept software updates 


 Does this really sound like something that could happen “almost immediately”? 


 And how will access point manufacturers, user device makers and others be 
convinced that all this is worth their time, effort and investment?
Page 123 


TLPS Logistical Hurdles Clear from GSAT’s Own Filings 


TLPS requires hardware and software that don’t yet exist 


 GSAT, May 5, 2014: access points = newly manufactured equipment 














 GSAT, June 4, 2014: access points need to be centrally managed 


 “Such control is critical to the commercial success of this managed service” 


 But the network operating system (NOS) doesn’t actually exist yet 


 Development still in very early (“Request for Information”) stage:
Page 124 


Equipment Authorization: A Big Potential Headache, Part 1 


For existing devices, GSAT initially sought “permissive change” treatment… 


 GSAT petition, November 2012: device makers will use “permissive change” filings 
for existing devices 


 Permissive change = less burdensome process than full re-certification
Page 125 


Equipment Authorization: A Big Potential Headache, Part 2 


…but the FCC (provisionally) said no 


 FCC NPRM, November 2013: certification, not permissive change! 





























 Cisco rubs it in, May 2014: 


 GSAT claims it can use permissive change, but: 


 “As recognized by the NPRM, Globalstar is wrong.”
Page 126 


Equipment Authorization: A Big Potential Headache, Part 3 


The NPRM would require manufacturers 


to physically re-label each individual TLPS user device! 


 GSAT to FCC, June 2014: please reconsider! 











The Commission…whether by interpretation, waiver, or rule change, should 


enable original equipment certification grantees to obtain permissive change 


authority to upgrade existing consumer devices for Channel 14 operations. … 


As described in Globalstar’s comments, the re-certification of all consumer 


devices receiving the TLPS software update would likely be an extended 


process and impose substantial and unnecessary costs on consumers, 


manufacturers, and the Commission. Original grantees would be required to 


submit certification filings that include all the exhibits typically required for a new 


approval. Telecommunications Certification Body (“TCB”) or Commission 


approval of these new certification requests could take at least several 


months, and then grantees would have to attach new FCC ID labels to 


every single consumer device that receives the software update. This 


lengthy and burdensome process could discourage manufacturer participation 


in TLPS and impede the development of this service.
Page 127 


Equipment Authorization: A Big Potential Headache, Part 4 


Even “permissive change” suffers from a chicken/egg problem 


 Even less burdensome “permissive change” filings could be challenging 


 Only original “grantees” can request permissive change, not GSAT 


 Example: iPhone 5 on T-Mobile’s network 


 Sep 2012: iPhone 5 released; no T-Mobile model 


 Apr 2013: T-Mobile announces first ever T-Mobile iPhone 


 T-Mobile commits to buying billions of dollars’ worth of devices 


 Apple’s FCC filings make clear that T-Mobile iPhone is just the AT&T iPhone with a 


software change, authorized via “permissive change” filing 


 Yet Apple choose not to make the filing until it had struck a deal with T-Mobile 


 GSAT must convince device-makers that TLPS is worth the effort 


 But TLPS only works if there are available access points!
Page 128 


Equipment Authorization: A Big Potential Headache, Part 5 


Firmware changes are risky, and TLPS isn’t worth the hassle 


 GSAT bulls argue that a mere firmware update will make existing user devices 
TLPS-capable 


 But firmware updates are dangerous!

History Lesson: The Open Range Misadventure, Part 1 


Open Range was GSAT’s first attempt at spectrum monetization 


 TLPS is not Globalstar’s first attempt to monetize its spectrum 


 In 2007, Globalstar asked the FCC to let it lease its spectrum to a newly created 
company, Open Range Communications 


 Open Range would provide 4G WiMAX to customers in underserved rural areas
Page 130 


History Lesson: The Open Range Misadventure, Part 2 


From the same management that’s now bringing you TLPS 


 Open Range was a complete failure: 


 GSAT could not meet FCC’s requirements to provide coverage in all 50 states, keep spare 


satellites, etc.  FCC suspends GSAT’s terrestrial authority 


 Open Range was destined for failure 


 Open Range woefully undercapitalized 


 WiMAX became a failed concept 


 Open Range targeted rural customers; CLWR failed even in urban areas 


 Execution failures: self-interference issues, poor network quality 


 Open Range only had a thin band of high frequency spectrum to work with 


 Open Range partially funded with gov’t-guaranteed debt, cost taxpayers $73m
Page 131 


Just Ask Yourself… 


 In a world where: 


 Unlicensed Wi-Fi, when available, is already superior to cellular service 


 Free Wi-Fi is offered by more and more businesses and venues 


 5GHz Wi-Fi is supported by all new devices and will enable far faster peak speeds 


than 2.4GHz 


 <1% of the US population has demonstrated any willingness to pay a dime for Wi-Fi 


access, let alone faster Wi-Fi once they have access 


 The notion of unmanageable spectrum congestion is belied by the widespread 


success of Wi-Fi deployments in stadiums, universities, businesses, etc.

GSAT’s Satellite Operations Do Not Support Its Debt Load 


Absent the spectrum story, GSAT equity is worthless 


 Sell-side valuation of satellite business: 


 7.5x EBITDA multiple (arbitrary) 


 $45mm of EBITDA 


 2014 H1 annualized level: ~$18mm 


 Thus price target assumes 2.5x increase in satellite-related EBITDA 


 Result: $338mm EV 


 Net debt excluding in-the-money convertibles: $545mm 


 Implied equity value excluding terrestrial uses of spectrum: zero

Iridium’s Recent Equity Raise: A Noteworthy Precedent  


GSAT may be forced to raise equity 


 2013: Iridium announces publicly that it’s off track on its near-term financial 
covenants and will “need modifications” 


 Same guarantor as GSAT: COFACE 


 May 2014: Iridium amends COFACE facility and re-strikes covenants 


 Condition: raising “at least $217.5 million through the sale of equity securities” 


 Why shouldn’t GSAT get the same treatment?
Page 141 


But…FCC Approval! 


Logically, FCC approval is not a positive catalyst 


 Some GSAT bulls believe FCC approval of TLPS will be a big “catalyst” 


 But all of our analysis already assumes FCC approval 


 GSAT is dramatically overvalued even with approval 


 Without TLPS approval, hard to argue GSAT equity is worth anything 


 GSAT bulls already assume very tight FCC timeline (Q4?) 


 Possible, but FCC has a lot on its plate, e.g. … 


 Two pending auctions (AWS-3 in 2014 and 600MHz in ~2015) 


 Rulemaking for 3.5GHz small-cell band  


 Net neutrality (hundreds of thousands of public comments)
Page 142 


Conclusion 


GSAT is overhyped, overvalued, and insolvent, with 100% downside 


 Globalstar short thesis is simple: 


 TLPS is worthless 


 Globalstar’s spectrum has negligible value in any other non-TLPS use case 


 Globalstar’s satellite business is worth less than its debt 


 Therefore, Globalstar equity is fundamentally worth zero 





 Dreamy spectrum narratives tend to end badly 


 Clearwire 


 LightSquared 


 ICO/DBSD 


 TerreStar 


 Solaris
