7/10/2019 KGJI: A 'Fraud School' Success Story - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/kgji-fraud-school-success-story/ 2/20


Background:


The boom of Chinese companies that conducted reverse mergers to
populate U.S. exchanges long-ago unraveled in a wave of fraud that
left investors with massive losses. Marketwatch’s Francine Mckenna
wrote in a July, 2016 article, that “More than 50 U.S. listed Chinese
companies were either delisted or halted from trading in 2011 and
2012 based on claims of fraud and other violations of U.S. securities
laws.” After the fraud boom, the article explains that Nasdaq
enhanced its due diligence practices to scrutinize listings:


That is why we were surprised to learn that Kingold Jewelry
(NASDAQ:KGJI), a Chinese reverse merger that has awarded
hundreds of thousands of shares to dubious stock promoters,
continues to have a NASDAQ listing. This year, hyperbole and gold-
driven promotional narratives have sent shares surging from less
than $0.50 to a high of $2.80. The company recently �led an $80
million shelf offering and implied last week that it will soon raise
fresh capital.


Before deciding to send additional millions overseas, we believe that
U.S. investors deserve to have the facts. As part of our due-diligence,
we obtained thousands of pages of Chinese-�led documents related
to Kingold and its undisclosed a�liates.


Our research has uncovered a typical mix of Chinese reverse-merger
characteristics: business claims that defy logic, fabricated SEC
�lings, false company statements, and undisclosed related party
transactions. We think it is obvious that Kingold is a dramatically
smaller company than it claims to be but, even worse, documents we
obtained from the People’s Bank of China show that Kingold has
made undisclosed asset pledges (primarily to the Chairman’s


“Once Nasdaq noticed that many of these reverse
merger companies shared promoters, directors, audit
�rms, and other professional services �rms, we started
analyzing the network”

shareholders equity. We are also concerned by very recent Chinese
media coverage regarding Kingold’s potential involvement in the
Shanghai stock market trading activities of related parties.

Kingold Was Touted By The Chinese “Fraud School” As a Success
Story


Muddy Waters, a research �rm that has exposed many Chinese
frauds, authored a White Paper on the organized network that
brought numerous fraudulent companies onto U.S. exchanges. The
presentation and research paper, Frauducation, cited a 2012 Chinese
Today’s Fortune article that discussed an investigation into a Chinese
“fraud school.” The article (translated into english) describes a
“systematically criminal” platform:


the “fraud school” is a small investment bank and
�nancing counseling company. It uses a network of
accounting �rms and law �rms based in HK and US to
jointly operate to present “trash” enterprises as fast-
growing and huge-pro�tmaking super stars, thus
catching the foreign investors’ eyes, gaining private
funding, and subsequently going public in the
US….After that, they will keep coaching the �rm on
producing falsi�ed reporting documents in order to
make it keep “growing” with the eventual goal of listing
on a primary exchange (i.e. NYSE or NASDAQ) and
collect even more money from US investors.

While the investment bank leading the fraud school was not
speci�cally named in the article, the research paper highlighted the
likelihood of it being a Hong Kong out�t named Chief Capital.
Although Chief Capital’s website has since been deleted, we found
Wayback Machine archives showing that KGJI was featured as one
of Chief Capital’s many “Success Stories”:


Source: Wayback Machine. June 6, 2011 capture.


Of the eight U.S. “classmates” pictured above, Kingold is the only
company still trading on U.S. exchanges. Chief Capital’s alumni have
left western investors with severe losses and have included high
pro�le frauds such as RINO International (OTC:RINO) (below).

Kingold had originally attempted a Chinese IPO but was rejected by
the Chinese Regulatory Commission on account of “abnormally rapid
revenue growth.” A month later, Kingold engaged Chief Capital and
subsequently completed a 2009 U.S. reverse merger. Chief Capital
(in the below pro�le) states it facilitated this process by providing
substantial audit assistance to Kingold. The �rm even issued a press
release congratulating their “client”, KGJI, on a successful NASDAQ
listing.

The Frauducation white paper also examined the audit �rm of Jimmy
C.H. Cheung & Company. Cheung was the earliest auditor of record
for RINO and audited ChinaCast (OTCPK:CAST) which, according the
SEC, was a “massive” fraud. We discovered that Cheung also
performed audit work for Kingold. In a 2010 comment letter, Kingold
assured the SEC of its compliance with U.S. GAAP and named
Cheung as helping implement Kingold’s �nancial reporting system:


Source: 2010 SEC Comment Letter


Kingold’s �nancial statements include “clean” audit opinions signed
by Friedman LLP, a �rm that has earned millions from auditing a
variety of discredited and/or fraudulent US-listed Chinese companies
such as: Advanced Battery Technologies (here), China Natural Gas
(here), and SinoCoking Coal (here). Our research indicates that
Friedman’s audits of Kingold have also failed.


Kingold’s Business Claims Defy Logic


The business model Kingold presents to investors is very simple.
The company manufacturers gold jewelry out of a single high-tech
factory in Wuhan and the product is then sold to distributors and
retailers. Revenues come from a combination of what KGJI calls
“branded” production (in which Kingold crafts gold into jewelry) and
“customized” work (in which the customer supplies the gold and
Kingold charges a fee to refurbish it).

denied having any involvement with.)


Importantly, Kingold’s business clearly requires hand-craftsmanship
that limits its scalability. Kingold itself admitted this in its Chinese
prospectus issued as part of the company’s failed IPO attempt. In
that document, Kingold stated that its then-current annual
production capacity was 8 metric tons of gold and that it would need
to have 500 total employees to increase that production to 20 metric
tons.

Since that time, Kingold’s reported revenues have grown by 10x from
$109 million in 2008 to over $1 billion dollars annually. The
company’s claimed gold manufacturing volumes have surged from
14 metric tons to 60 tons. In the most recent quarter alone, Kingold
claims to have sold over 20 tons of gold jewelry– an amount greater
than the entirety of the company’s stated 2010 annual capacity.


This means that, magically, Kingold has tripled its capacity and
grown its revenues by over $750 million USD by adding only 68
employees since 2009.

to PP&E. During the entirety of 2015, Kingold invested a total of only
$67 thousand dollars in PP&E (to support over $1 billion of claimed
revenues). This disproportionate lack of investment (along with
Kingold’s own Chinese promotional video) completely undermines
the promoted notion that Kingold possesses state of the art
manufacturing technology.


In short, Kingold’s believers must explain how a manufacturingshort
business can experience exponential production growth without any
meaningful incremental inputs of either labor or capital. We see two
possibilities; either Kingold is a communist manufacturing miracle,
or the company has fabricated its SEC �lings.


Chinese Documents Demonstrate That Kingold’s SEC Filings Are
Fabricated


The previously cited Today’s Fortune article explained that after
obtaining a U.S. listing, the fraud school:


We obtained older documents that Kingold publicly �led with the
Chinese State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”)
and contain �nancials through 2012. (Note: Afterwards, many
companies were no longer required to report �nancial information to
the SAIC on a go-forward basis.)


In the SAIC �lings, pre-tax pro�ts are a mere 20-30% of the totals
Kingold has reported to the SEC. The documents also reveal that
Kingold understated its liabilities in SEC reports by a factor of as
much as 10x while vastly overstating its book value.


will talk to the long-term cooperating
accounting/auditing �rms to make sure that the fake
�nancials pass through the auditing process smoothly,
and that perfect audit reports will be issued for those
companies. They will make sure those auditor reports
seem very reliable.

This is not the �rst time that the integrity of Kingold’s SEC �lings has
been called into question. In 2011, a Seeking Alpha author
discovered that:


1. Chinese State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) �lings
showed that Kingold’s reported revenues and pro�ts
amounted to only 29% and 14% of what the company
respectively reported to the SEC.


2. One of Kingold’s large Chinese shareholders was offering to
sell its shares at a much lower price than NASDAQ market
prices. The shareholder’s listing included Kingold �nancials
(audited by a �rm named Wuhan Tianli) that reported
substantially lower revenue and net income totals than
Kingold reported to the SEC.


In a subsequent open letter to shareholders, Kingold’s Chairman, Jia
Zhihong, declared that Wuhan Tianli (the auditor of the �nancials in
question) had never performed audit work for Kingold. The Chairman
stated that:


The Chairman’s statement to Kingold’s shareholders is false. SAIC
documents �led by Kingold speci�cally name Wuhan Tianli as a
Kingold auditor and even include the national photo ID cards of the


Tianli has never been Kingold’s auditor in the PRC, or
anywhere else, nor have they ever had access to our
books or records. The idea that Tianli performed an
audit of Kingold without the Company’s knowledge and
without visiting or contacting me or the Company is
impossible and absurd.”

opinion, acts to completely undermine the Chairman’s credibility as
well as the integrity of the company’s public statements to investors.

privacy concerns.


In light of these previous discoveries and the Chairman’s in�uence in
Wuhan (Chairman Zhihong is a former military o�cial), we
anticipated that Kingold’s more recent chinese �lings would match
the SEC numbers. We obtained tax �lings that Kingold made with the

SAT from 2013-2015 and, as expected, reported revenues and pro�ts
closely followed Kingold’s SEC �nancials.


However, in our opinion, both the SEC & SAT �nancials display
signi�cant irregularities. Although Kingold sells its product to
distributors and retailers, Kingold reports having de-minimus
accounts receivable (The 2014 SAT �lings, for example, imply a
stratospheric Receivables Turnover Ratio of 2,200 times). Even if we
were to take the company at its word that it operates in an entirely
cash business, the �nancials show that very little cash accumulates
and that inventory turns over slowly–a combination we �nd highly
suspect.


Similar to the older SAIC �lings, Kingold’s SAT �lings also report
signi�cantly higher liabilities (and lower book values) than what the
company reports to the SEC.

We have no idea how many sets of books Kingold keeps or what the
“correct” numbers are, but we think it is obvious the company is
dramatically smaller than its SEC �lings claim. Even worse, we have
become concerned that undisclosed transactions have impaired or
even eliminated shareholder’s equity.

Three Kingold-a�liated individuals are involved in undisclosed
related party dealings and have overlapping business interests with
one another:


Jia Zhihong (贾志宏) : Is the co-founder of Kingold and the
current Chairman. Although Chairman Zhihong has told
shareholders he doesn’t have any other businesses, we
discovered that the Chairman is involved in many other
companies including Wuhan Kangbo Biological Technology
Co. Ltd (“Kangbo”).


Chen Wei (陈炜) : A longtime shareholder of Kingold and is
listed in documents as being the equivalent of Kingold’s head
of R&D at some point. He is the legal representative and
majority shareholder of Wuhan Lianfuda (which Kingold has
falsely depicted as an “unrelated party”).


Hu Qiao (胡乔): Is entrusted as the legal representative for
KGJI’s Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) (See here
for a background on the VIE structure and the importance of
the WFOE for western shareholders). Hu Qiao is also the
legal representative for Kangbo and several other companies
with overlapping interests.


Kingold’s SEC reported liabilities (primarily consisting of byzantine
layers of debt) have exploded from $204 million at the end of 2015
to over $1.3 Billion as of September 30, 2016. Kingold’s SEC �lings
state that this debt has been used to �nance purchases of Gold,
causing promoters to argue that KGJI shares are “one of the
cheapest ways to own gold in the world.”

KGJI Total Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YCharts


The company has told investors that it is purchasing gold in
anticipation of looming jewelry demand from the long-awaited
completion of its Jewelry Park (its �rst direct retail location). Based
on our investigator’s visit to the construction site, we �nd it farcical
to believe that Kingold will sell anything remotely close to $1 Billion
USD of gold from this single location in Wuhan.


We obtained a Kingold credit report provided by The Peoples Bank Of
China (“PBOC”) and those documents tell a far different story:

Source: Capture of PBOC Credit report above with amounts listed in units
of 10,000 RMB. Below section includes our translation of the table and
conversion into absolute amounts in both RMB and USD.


The PBOC documents reveal that Kingold has made $1.5 Billion RMB
(roughly $225 million USD) worth of undisclosed guarantees and
asset pledges primarily for the �nancial bene�t of related party
companies.This amount exceeds the entirety of the 2015
shareholders equity that Kingold reported to the Chinese SAT.


Roughly $150 million USD of this total consists of assets Kingold has
pledged (presumably gold) for the bene�t of Wuhan Kangbo
Biological. Shockingly, Chinese SAIC documents �led by Kangbo
irrefutably demonstrate that Chairman Zhihong has had substantial
involvement in Kangbo and even co-founded the company (through
his interest in Hubei Zhicheng Biological). Furthermore, Kangbo’s
current Legal Representative is Hu Qiao, the very individual
responsible for safeguarding Kingold shareholder’s WFOE.

of Kingold. We also learned that Kingold and Lianfuda share the
same registered address: Te 15 Huangpu Technology Park, Jiang’an
District, Wuhan City (but a visit by our investigators found that this
address does not exist).

The �nancial nexus between Kingold, Lianfuda, Kangbo, and other
a�liates of the Chairman has become highly relevant for Kingold’s
shareholders.

We are concerned by recent Chinese media reports of Kingold
having potential involvement in the Shanghai stock market trading
activities of related parties.


Several weeks ago, the Chinese media wrote articles (here and here)
about trading irregularities in a Shanghai-listed company named
Wuchang Fish (600275.SH). The articles stated that Chinese
regulators discovered that Lianfuda had acted in concert with
a�liates to accumulate a sizeable position as part of a potential
attempt to gain control of the company. The media also reported
that Lianfuda does not have enough registered capital to support
such a transaction leading to speculation that others were “behind
the scenes”.


That speculation has centered speci�cally on the potential
involvement of Kingold Jewelry and Chairman Zhihong as the
undisclosed �nancial source of the transactions. Our English
translation of one of the media articles (which we have made
available here) states that:


Chinese media reports indicate that there continue to be far more
questions than answers. However, it is clear that an elaborate web of
interconnectivity exists between Chairman Zhihong and individuals
involved with Kingold on one end, and entities associated in the
trading of Wuchang Fish on the other.


While a detailed exploration of these complex entanglements is
beyond the scope of this report, we are not comforted by Kingold’s
abrupt decision to cancel its customary U.S. quarterly earnings call
just weeks after the media reports �rst emerged. We also �nd it
troubling that Kingold now appears poised to attempt another U.S.


a NASDAQ listed company Wuhan Kingold Jewelry Co
Ltd (KGJI.NASDAQ) may also involve into this [the
trading of Wuchang Fish]…the key is the Chinese
concept stock Kingold Jewelry and Jia Zhihong and
Chen Wei behind the scene

earlier this year.


We encourage investors to conduct their own due diligence into
these factors before sending additional millions overseas.
