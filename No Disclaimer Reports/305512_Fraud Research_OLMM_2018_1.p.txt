OneLife	Technologies:	Caveat	Emptor	For	This	Alleged	Boiler	Room
Stock	Promotion

by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


Summary


Surge	in	trading	volume	and	share	price	attributed	to	a	stock	promotion	campaign	by
Equity	Mark	Capital,	and	online	reports	allege	boiler	room	tactics.


OTCMarkets.com	just	added	the	dreaded	"Caveat	Emptor"	designation,	noting	a
public	interest	concern	with	the	company.


+$100	million	market	cap	with	zero	sales	and	less	than	$25,000	in	assets.


Important	conditions	of	a	share	purchase	agreement	still	not	met.


Shares	of	OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	(OTCPK:OLMM)	have	increased	by	as	much	as
86%	during	2018	after	months	of	inactivity.	Although	the	Company	has	issued	several
press	releases	in	recent	weeks,	we	believe	that	the	primary	reason	why	this	pre-revenue
company	with	less	than	$25,000	in	assets	now	boasts	a	market	cap	exceeding	$120
million	is	because	it	is	the	subject	of	a	questionable	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign
containing	alleged	boiler	room	tactics.


OTCMarkets.com	just	added	the	"Caveat	Emptor"	designation	to	OLLM	after	the	closing
bell	on	March	8th	2018,	presumably	due	to	the	current	promotional	campaign	that	we
outline	in	this	report.


Furthermore,	we	have	uncovered	specific	conditions	of	a	share	purchase	agreement	that
the	Company	has	failed	to	meet	that	may	preclude	it	from	transferring	any	assets	from
One	Media	Enterprises	to	OneLife	Technologies.

We	have	raised	our	concerns	to	the	issuer	by	email	to	the	email	address	listed	on	their
website	seeking	clarification	but	unfortunately	we	have	not	received	a	response.


Recent	Company	News


In	our	opinion,	none	of	the	Company's	recent	announcements	are	significant	enough	to	be
the	primary	factor	for	the	recent	surge	in	share	price:


OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	Signs	Exclusive	Technology	Deal	with	E2	Performance
OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	to	Seek	Listing	on	OTCQX	Best	Market
OneLife	Technologies	Highlights	Acquisition	of	Chinese	Tech	Developer	Yinuo
Technologies	Ltd.	and	Related	IP	for	Wearable	Medical	Trading	Devices
OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	Highlights	Sensation	Wearable	Medical	Tracking
Technology
OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	Outlines	Mission	to	Bring	Mobile	Medical	Data	Innovations
to	Global	Healthcare	Sector


About	OneLife	Technologies


OneLife	positions	itself	as	a	mobile	medical	hardware	and	software	company	through	its
recent	share	exchange	agreement	with	One	Media	Enterprises,	Limited.


The	Company's	website	lists	two	physical	products	that	do	not	appear	to	be	available	for
sale:


The	Sensation


A	wearable	device	targeting	the	health	and	medical
markets	created	for	users	who:


Have	health	problems
Are	aging	or	elderly
Have	cognitive	disabilities
Are	not	interested	in	being	connected	with	more
complex	mobile	"wearables"


The	Tricorder


A	portable	device	that	captures	medical	vitals	including	blood	pressure,	heart	rate,
ECG/EKG,	SpO2,	and	temperature.	The	device	is	meant	to	communicate	with	the
Sensation	through	a	Bluetooth	connection.

Although	OneLife	Technologies	lists
both	of	these	products	on	their
website,	there	are	several	reasons	to
believe	that	OneLife	wouldn't	be	able
to	brand	and	market	these	products
as	OneLife:


Red	Flag	#1:	Terms	With
Angelfish	Investments	PLC


The	Company	signed	numerous	financing	agreements	with	Angelfish	Investments	PLC
dating	back	to	2013	when	it	did	business	as	privately-held	One	Media	Enterprises	Ltd.
(OME)	beginning	with	this	initial	debenture	agreement.


Although	OneLife	Technologies	references	Angelfish	Investments	PLC	in	SEC	filings,	it
fails	to	fully	disclose	the	specific	conditions	that	Angelfish	requires	to	be	met	in	order	for
OneLife's	acquisition	of	OME	to	be	binding:


1.	Completion	of	the	Acquisition
2.	OneLife	having	entered	into	arrangements	for	the	raising	of	at	least	$5	million	in	equity,
debt	or	other	funding;	and


3.	The	receipt	by	Angelfish	of	the	first	installment	of	$200,000	within	sixty	days	of	the
Agreement


Although	it	has	been	over	sixty	days	since	Angelfish	disclosed	these	conditions	on	their
website,	OneLife	has	not	announced	having	met	conditions	(2)	and	(3)	above	nor	has	it
ever	fully	disclosed	these	conditions	in	S.E.C.	filings.


Why	is	this	so	important?


"Until	the	obligations	under	this	Agreement	have	been	met	in	full,	OME	has	agreed	not
transfer	any	of	the	business	and	assets	of	OME	to	OneLife	or	any	other	third	party."
SOURCE:	Angelfish	Investments	PLC


In	other	words,	until	OneLife	Technologies	enters	into	arrangements	to	raise	$5	million
and	pays	back	Angelfish	Investments	PLC	the	first	$200,000	tranche	of	the	$1	million
payable,	they	cannot	transfer	the	business	and	assets	of	OME	(including	the	Sensation
and	the	Tricorder)	to	OneLife.

Interestingly	enough,	Amazon.com	(NASDAQ:AMZN)	still	lists	two	watches	by	seller	One
Media	and	not	OneLife	and	even	the	company's	domain	name	(onelifetc.com)	still	lists
whois	information	for	the	registrant	organization	as	One	Media	Partners	Inc.	and	not
OneLife	Technologies.


(Editor's	Note:	the	ICANN	whois	info	above	has	been	modified	to	highlight	the
Organization	Name	and	to	remove	contact	details.	The	original	image	is	available	here)


Red	Flag	#2:	Default	Status	With	Nevada	Secretary	of	State


OneLife	Technologies	was	incorporated	in	the	State	of	Nevada	on	January	9,	2014.
However,	a	quick	search	on	the	Nevada	Secretary	of	State	website	indicates	that	the
company's	status	is	in	default	with	a	business	license	that	expired	on	1/31/2018.

At	the	start	of	2018,	OLMM	shares	barely	traded.	In	fact,	during	the	first	trading	week	of
2018,	a	total	7,700	shares	were	traded.	Since	then,	the	share	price	and	trading	volume
have	both	soared:


Although	the	Company	has	issued	several	press	releases	during	the	past	few	weeks,
none	appear	material	enough	to	justify	the	recent	surge	in	trading	activity.	Rather,	we	are
convinced	that	the	unusual	activity	in	recent	weeks	is	primarily	attributed	to	a	questionable
stock	promotion	campaign	that	involves	telephone	calls	and	high-pressure	boiler	room
practices	similar	to	the	ones	featured	in	the	Wolf	of	Wall	Street	movie.


The	EquityMarkCapital.com	website	hosts	a	file	containing	a	legal	disclaimer	disclosing
that	it	expects	to	receive	$50,000	per	week	for	"continuing	coverage	of	the	current
selected	public	company	mentioned	in	our	promotional	emails":

A	growing	number	of	online	investors	are	reporting	telephone	calls	and	emails	from
representatives	of	Equity	Mark	Capital.	Below	is	a	sample	email	touting	OLMM	stock	that

Take	note	that	OLMM	is	the	stock	being	featured	in	the	email	and	the	final	line	of	the	email
reads:	"Please	read	our	disclosure	here"	where	it	goes	on	to	disclose	that	they	expect	to
be	compensated	$50,000	per	week	by	a	3rd	party.


Past	Boiler	Room	Stock	Promotions


Although	past	performance	may	not	be	indicative	of	future	results,	to	date	the	stocks	that
we	have	previously	reported	on	have	followed	a	similar	pattern	after	their	promotional
campaign	ends.	Take	a	look	at	the	how	the	three	other	penny	stocks	performed	after	they
were	subjected	to	promotional	boiler	room	campaigns:


Tactical	Services,	Inc.	(OTCPK:TTSI)

TTSI	was	part	of	an	alleged	boiler	room	stock	promotion	back	in	the	Fall	of	2017.	After
rising	from	$0.70	to	$1.09	over	sixteen	trading	days,	shares	collapsed	by	as	much	as	97%
in	four	trading	days.

STVA	(formerly	HOMR	prior	to	a	name	and	ticker	symbol	change)	was	also	subjected	to	a
boiler	room	stock	promotion	in	the	Fall	of	2017.	The	stock	climbed	from	about	$1.00	to	a
high	of	$2.02	over	seventeen	trading	days	and	then	collapsed	by	as	much	as	98%	in	four
trading	days	before	finally	being	suspended	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission,
citing	recent	promotions,	unusual	and	unexplained	market	activity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4155017-onelife-technologies-caveat-emptor-alleged-boiler-room-stock-promotion 10/11


RETC	was	allegedly	subjected	to	a	boiler	room	promotion	in	the	summer	of	2017.	The
stock	climbed	from	about	$1.00	to	a	high	of	$2.61	over	twenty	trading	days	during	the
summer	of	2017	before	collapsing	by	over	98%	in	6	trading	days.


When	EquityMarkCapital.com	domain	name	was	registered	on	10/13/2017,	the	default
domain	name	system	name	servers	were	set	to	NS1.HOSTROYALE.COM	and
NS2.HOSTROYALE.COM,	two	name	servers	controlled	by	an	obscure	domain	and	web
hosting	provider	HostRoyale	Technologies	Pvt	Ltd.	Oddly	enough,	a	domain	name
allegedly	used	in	conjunction	with	the	TTSI	stock	promotion	(FinancialMarketsReport.com)
can	also	be	traced	back	to	HostRoyale	name	servers	along	with	domain	names	containing
the	HOMR	ticker	symbol	(HOMRUrgentReport.com)	and	the	RETC	ticker	symbol
(RETCInvestorAlert.com).


Conclusion


As	we	have	outlined	in	our	past	eleven	articles,	when	penny	stocks	are	subjected	to	stock
promotion	campaigns,	it	never	ends	well.	The	short-term	volatility	and	price	surges	are
attributed	almost	entirely	to	the	high-pressure	sales	tactics	of	stock	promoters	as	opposed
to	company	news	releases	and	when	the	promotional	campaign	ends,	the	stock	crashes.
Boiler	room	stock	promotions	like	the	current	OLMM	campaign	are	among	the	most

brazen	campaigns	and	are	often	the	riskiest.	As	we	have	outlined	in	this	report,	past
penny	stocks	subjected	to	boiler	room	stock	promotions	have	resulted	in	substantial	short-
term	losses	and	can	even	result	in	trading	suspensions.


We	expect	OLMM	to	be	no	exception.	In	the	short-term,	the	nature	of	the	current
promotional	campaign	puts	the	company	at	imminent	risk	of	a	steep	drop	especially	in	lieu
of	the	recent	Caveat	Emptor	designation.	In	the	long-term,	considering	the	Company's
historical	inability	to	generate	sales,	the	less	than	$25,000	in	assets	according	to	the	most
recent	quarterly	report	and	a	financier's	conditions	of	the	share	purchase	agreement	still
not	met,	we	believe	that	the	outlook	for	OneLife	Technologies	Corp.	is	grim.


Disclosure:	I/we	have	no	positions	in	any	stocks	mentioned,	but	may	initiate	a	short	position	in	OLMM	over	the	next	72
hours.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than
