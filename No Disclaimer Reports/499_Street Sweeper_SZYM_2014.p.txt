Solazyme: It Isn't Easy (Or Profitable) Being Green

Summary


Historic drought and fires affect sugar cane heartland, multiplying production
problems for SZYM’s Brazil plant. Slashed prospects expected to extend into next
year.


Biofuels business performs spectacularly poorly, driving stock prices from roughly
$25 down to 25 cents in three years for three other companies. Niche presents
similar risks for SZYM.


Sudden, quiet departure of president, engineering vice president and director/audit
committee chairman in recent weeks foretells significant troubles for SZYM.


Fund whittles ownership, while company insiders sell more than half-a-million shares
in just the last two months, indicating a lack of faith in the company.


SZYM accumulates $384 million in losses, yet five executives and directors last year
received princely sum of $10.5 million in stock and other compensation. CEO alone
got almost $3.5 million.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Trouble is blowing the lids off the petri dishes at Solazyme (SZYM), where the company
has fruitlessly toiled for 11 years at turning sugar and algae into profit.


The San Francisco, Calif. oil-maker's income statement and analyst estimates are already
steeped in red.


It battles increasing net losses (note that besides Sephora and other stores, SZYM also
unfortunately hitched its wagon to badly aging J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) which traded
~$30 then, ~$7 now) as SZYM produces "green" wrinkle cream from algae.


SZYM also faces a massive string of red flags poised to smother its effort to create
renewable oils and chemicals for various markets from its sugar-fed algae.


Plant shutdown likely dings oil production effort

SZYM first pushed out some commercial oil and drilling lubricant in May from a small area
at Brazil's Moema Plant that the townspeople call "the annex." CEO Jonathan Wolfson
understandably trumpeted the event resulting from a joint venture with Bunge, yet warned,
"We have work ahead … establishing consistent production and reliable supply and from
there we'll turn to the ramp up process."


But production and supply problems already appear to be damaging that ramp-up. Layoffs
occurred when the annex lurched to a temporary standstill while a cranky boiler was
repaired, according to our source located near the plant in the sugar cane heartland in
Sao Paulo, Brazil.


SZYM on Oct. 9 offered the sketchiest plant update, describing production of only "modest
quantities" of commercial oils, warning:


… downstream processes at Moema require further optimization and are not yet
operating on a fully integrated basis. This is an area of significant focus and ongoing
improvement."


So this suggests the plant is not scaling up according to expectations.


Indeed, some analysts remain nervous about SZYM's future, with Piper Jaffray leading the
pack with its issued "Underweight" rating, writing:


… a lack of visibility into the scale-up at Moema in terms of committed contracts,
timelines, and general plant operations underscore our Underweight thesis."


The analyst also complained about "very limited visibility/obfuscation into tangible
productions metrics" and added:


High variable costs and fixed cost absorption should start to ramp quickly at Moema,
against limited volumes during the plant start-up. We believe that, ultimately, low
sales volumes and high fixed costs will beget poorer than expected economics in an
effort to secure volumes."


Credit Suisse wrote more gently last week about giving SZYM a "neutral" rating and
estimating a $1.66 loss per share this year, while Piper Jaffray raised the expected net
loss to $1.93.

Historic drought, fires build more uncertainty


The sugar cane crop that serves as SZYM's feedstock has been hit by massive fires and
the worst drought in 100 years.


Sugar industry group Unica reports the two factors have already substantially cut the cane
plantings and harvest for the 2014-2015 season.


With Bunge and other sugar and ethanol companies already cutting costs against losses,
an industry spokesman said next season's crop will suffer significantly. Sugar production is
expected to be slashed by about 3 million metric tons.


Those hits can only be expected to hold SZYM's foot off the accelerator at the plant at
least until sometime after the sugar cane harvest next year.


Advanced biofuels business performs poorly


SZYM's biofuels effort also stands ready to disappoint investors, judging by three
companies that have turned and run away from this business. They are Kior ($20 in 2011,
now ~7 cents, unable to commercialize biofuel, delisted), Gevo ($25 in 2011, now ~29
cents, tried biofuels but returned to ethanol) and a company TheStreetSweeper warned
about, Amyris ($32 in 2011, now ~$3, now focused on perfume oils).


The stock chart tells the story:


SZYM has managed investor sentiment so the stock hasn't yet been smashed. But we
expect the screws will be tightened now that the company is expected to produce.


Goodbye president, hello trouble


These three sudden, quiet departures throw more red flags at SZYM's future:

1. SZYM president and director, David Cole, jumps out with a golden parachute worth
$844,000 to consult for SZYM for $20,000 per month.


2. Engineering vice president, Mark Warner, hired to design SZYM plants worldwide and
build out commercial scale success, left in September to join another company called
Impossible Foods, according to LinkedIn. But SZYM didn't bother to tell investors.


3. Long-time director/audit chairman Ann Mather resigns, effective "prior to the end of
2014." She is a board member of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and a
company TheStreetSweeper recently warned investors about, Glu Mobile
(NASDAQ:GLUU).


Whether these execs and directors were shown the door or found it themselves because
of Brazil plant problems or something more or less ominous, we are unsure.


But we are sure it amounts to bad news.


Fund, insiders selling like crazy


Braemar Energy Ventures was a big holder of SZYM in 2013, with an ownership of about
8.2 percent of the shares.


But now Braemar has apparently lost faith in the stock and has recently sold more than 2
million shares, whittling down its ownership to just 4.99 percent of the company.


That seems to be the unfortunate trend with insiders because they have done nothing for
a long time but sell, sell, sell SZYM.


In the last two months alone, officers and directors have sold a jaw-dropping 500,000-plus
shares. The chief executive Mr. Wolfson led the charge by selling almost 275,000 shares.


SZYM loses multimillions, pays executives multimillions


Investors shouldn't make the mistake of taking a quick glimpse at SZYM's finances and
thinking, "Well, at least they've got some cash."


That $285 million in cash and short-term investments is mostly due to a massive debt
load, including recent additions from private and public offerings. Besides, the company is
burning that up in about $20 million chunks each month.


The company has accumulated $384 million in losses.
