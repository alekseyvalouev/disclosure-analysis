Focus Media's Explanation Comes Up Short: Part 2, The Theater
Count

Focus Media Holding's Ltd. (NASDAQ:FMCN)


Before being caught short with its LCD inventory count (see prior article), Focus Media
claimed in 2008 to have over 27,000 theaters in its movie theater network. (here) Muddy
Waters Research called them out on that one too: there were unfortunately less than
1,600 urban theaters in all of China that year ‒ which puts FMCN's count off by only …
about … 25,000. (here) Focus Media recently submitted an amended filing, explaining that
they were not really talking about theaters, but …


Prior to 2009, we calculated the size of its movie theater network by calculating the
number of screens on which each of its advertisers had purchased advertising and
then summing the screen count for each advertiser to produce an aggregate number
of screens. (Amended SEC 20-F)


My answers to this are No and No and No.


1) No. The original statement was very clear,


As of December 31, 2008, we had rights to lease advertising time on screens in
27,164 movie theaters in cities across China. (SEC 20-F, 2008)


and:


The increase is primarily due to … (3) increased leasing costs associated with time
we rent on movie theatre screens as a result of an increase in the number of
theaters we leased in our network from 10,930 in 2007 to 27,164 in 2008. (SEC 20-
F, 2009)


2) No, the movie count for 2008 ‒ "27,164" ‒ persisted beyond 2008. What are we
supposed to believe? That they changed the calculation method "prior to 2009" but
continued using the number, "27,164," one month before 2011? The filing date of the
above amended 2009 20-F was December 10, 2010. If the method of calculation changed
prior to 2009 why not mention that change in the 2009 20-F? "Prior to 2009"? I couldn't

even find a mention of the new method of calculation prior to 2012? Let me put this softly.
It would be a statement against myself not to hold out the strong possibility that this
"change of methodology" was a result of being exposed by Muddy Waters' Research.
(Filing detail)


3) No matter how recklessly we twist the two statements to force reconciliation, 27,164 is
just too big of a number. We can't use it without suffering an irreconcilable contradiction
between the two statements. Let me show you what I mean:


What could the number "27,164" refer to?


We're not talking about theaters, because there were only 1,545 Urban Movie theaters in
all of China in 2008. We're not talking about screens because there were only 4,097
Urban Movie screens in all of China in 2008. (See: A Critical Failure in the Focus Media
Story.)


So what does that number represent?


Focus Media offered us an answer, but only if we forget that Focus Media had ever
mentioned theaters or screens. We must accept a very convoluted explanation that the
number, "27,164," only refers to "purchased advertisements." It's the only way the math
can work. But why such a confusing explanation? The words "theaters," "screens,"
"network," "advertisers," and "purchased ads" were spread out in the passage as a five-
year-old would spread green peas on his plate to fool Mom into thinking he had finally
eaten some. In the end, the peas are still on the plate and Mom hasn't been fooled: What
happened to the 27,000 theaters Focus Media claimed in 2008? … or in the document
filed one month before 2011? (SEC Amendment #4, 20-F filed December 10, 2010, "Filing
Detail" link above.)


Assets were misrepresented. There is no middle ground here. Who was supposed to
know that "theaters" were not concrete things, but transactions? What did investors think
they were buying? How was an investor really supposed to value a network of 27,000
theaters in 2008? If that number was not correct, where did the revenue come from for
those years? How many other numbers have to be corrected? Have we carried into 2012
"contributions" to equity from non-existent businesses?


Focus Media claimed to have refuted Muddy Waters Research. That's well said, but
anyone can say that. For example, I can claim that I have refuted the equation two plus
two equals four, but I cannot demonstrate that claim. This point is worth underscoring: a
refutation is demonstrated, not merely declared.
