CTE’s “Unique” Technology Used in Two Past
Penny Stock Promotions


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


SinoTech Energy Limited (NASDAQ: CTE $2.80) claims to be


involved in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) services in China, and


claims to use a technology that is “high tech” and “completely


unique,” according to CTE’s most recent earnings conference call.


However, CTE’s purported EOR technology has actually been used


in two US penny stock promotions, one (Click here to see a report


titled “CTE’s Unsubstantiated Intellectual Property Claims.”) of


which led to an SEC action for securities fraud. In both cases, the


technology failed to develop meaningful sales or earnings, and both


companies abandoned use of the technology.


CTE’s IPO prospectus does not disclose the existence of any issue or


potential dispute pertaining to the ownership of or past litigation by


the SEC arising from performance claims of the patents that CTE


claims to have licensed.


CTE calls its technology “lateral hydraulic drilling” or LHD. It relies


upon patents developed in the 1990’s by Carl Landers (US Patent


#5413184, 5853056, and 6125949). In its SEC filings, CTE references


the Landers patents as its “Base Patents.” The Landers patents were


also used and promoted by Blast Energy Services, Inc. (OTC: BESV


$0.04), f/k/a Verdisys, Inc., and Maxim TEP, Inc., which is now


known as Conquest Petroleum, Inc. (Pink Sheets: CQPT $0.065).


The SEC brought an action against Blast Energy in 2006 for


securities fraud related to Blast’s promotion of its technology based


on the Landers patents. 


The SEC stated that Blast Energy made misleading disclosures and


false revenue claims and promoted the Landers patents as “a


leading technology,” when it was in fact only a “prototype.” The SEC


also noted that the patents’ license “became available after the

entity attempting to commercially deploy the technology dissolved


in bankruptcy, and no established oil and gas companies bid for the


technology.” Blast Energy, two of its officers, and one director all


settled charges with the SEC. To see SEC’s litigation on this matter,


click here and here. Blast Energy’s CEO Daniel Williams was


permanently prohibited from acting as an officer or director of a


public company. The fact that this patent has been related to


fraudulent companies in the past and is now associated with CTE,


and that CTE is also purported to use the above patent should


concern investors.


Blast Energy bought a license to use the Landers patents for $2.75


million in 2003, and by 2005, Blast had apparently abandoned the


lateral drilling services business, and sold its Landers-patents


license to Maxim TEP for $1.3 million in 2005. Maxim not only


licensed the Landers patents, but Maxim bought the patents


outright from Landers himself in 2006 for $4.75 million. Within


three years, however, the supposed value of the patents apparently


declined dramatically. Maxim sold the patents in 2009 for only


$250,000. To see a chart analyzing the transfer of the patent click


here.


Industry surveys show that no major oil services firm uses the


Landers technology. In fact, the technology is used only by a few


small, private companies. (See Maple Group Presentation).
