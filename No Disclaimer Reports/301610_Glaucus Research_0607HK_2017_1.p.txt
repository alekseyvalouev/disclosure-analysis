HKD 56.4 billion

We believe that Fullshare Holdings Ltd. (HK: 0607) (“Fullshare” or the “Company”), a 2013 reverse merger, is 


one of the largest stock manipulation schemes trading on any exchange anywhere in the world.  In our opinion, 


Fullshare resembles Tech Pro Technology (HK: 3823), Huishan Dairy (HK: 6863), and Hanergy (HK: 0566), 


schemes whose stock price collapsed in spectacular fashion.   





In this report, we present independent evidence from intraday trading patterns indicating, in our opinion, that 


Fullshare’s share price has been manipulated.  We believe that insiders have used the smokescreen of a rising 


stock price to secretly transfer some of the Company’s most valuable assets to the chairman and his family.   





Fullshare is supposedly a commercial and residential property developer, but this business is tiny compared to its 


market capitalization.  In FY 2016, Fullshare generated a paltry RMB 132 million in EBIT from continuing 


operations, meaning it currently trades at 431x recurring operating profits.  This is a ludicrous valuation.  Even if 


we ignore all evidence of corruption or embezzlement, Fullshare’s operating business is so insignificant that if 


we value Fullshare at the median multiple for HSCIPC companies (either on an adjusted P/E or adjusted P/B 


ratio), we would expect Fullshare’s stock price to decrease by 70-80%.  However, given the evidence of multiple 


undisclosed related party acquisitions and dispositions, we believe that Fullshare’s management displays such a 


blatant disregard for shareholders and Hong Kong securities rules that the Company is simply uninvestible. 





1. Intraday Trading Patterns Indicate Stock Manipulation.  We analyzed intraday trading patterns and found 
that just like Hanergy and Tech Pro, the inexplicable appreciation of Fullshare’s stock price is due to unusual 


gains posted in the final hour of trading.   





a. Fullshare’s Stock Price Rises Inexplicably in the Final Hour.  If an investor bought and held Fullshare’s 
stock from November 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017, it would have generated a loss of -34%.  But if an 


investor bought Fullshare’s stock at the beginning of the last trading hour and sold at the close of the trading 


day (and reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Fullshare’s stock would have 


returned an inexplicable 76% over that same period!  The difference between the returns in trading 


Fullshare’s stock with a last-hour trading strategy and a buy-and-hold strategy was 110% over this period.  


This staggering difference is highly unusual when compared to other Hong Kong stocks, and in our opinion, 


strong evidence of manipulation. 





b. Manipulation of Zall’s Stock Artificially Inflates Fullshare’s Reported Income.  Fullshare’s operating 
business is immaterial.  Rather, 108% of Fullshare’s FY 2016 net income was derived from unrealized 


gains due to the appreciation in the stock price of its 2015 investment in another Hong Kong listed 


company: Zall Group Ltd. (“Zall”) (HK: 2098).  The year that Fullshare invested in Zall, Zall was a deeply 


troubled company: it was not in compliance with its debt covenants, its revenues declined 48% and it was 


losing RMB 1.4 billion in cash from its operations.  Yet almost as soon as Fullshare purchased 8.2% of 


Zall and Zall received 4.8% of Fullshare,  the stock prices of both companies began to mysteriously soar.  


An analysis of the intraday trading pattern of Zall’s stock also shows strong evidence of manipulation.  If 


an investor bought and held Zall’s stock from November 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017, it would have 


generated a loss of -9%.  But if the same investor bought Zall’s shares at the start of the last hour and sold 


at the close of the trading day (and reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Zall’s stock 


would have returned a staggering 58% over that same period.  Such an unusual pattern of stock price 


appreciation in the final hour of trading not only suggests that Zall’s stock is being manipulated, but that 


the appreciation of Zall’s stock artificially inflates Fullshare’s reported income.

c. Poised to Crash.  Because of the significant cross-holdings between the two companies, the manipulation of 
Fullshare’s and Zall’s stocks has the perverse effect of enabling each company to recognize unrealized gains, 


which artificially inflates their respective net income, sending each company’s stock higher still.  As a result, 


both Fullshare’s and Zall’s share prices wildly exceed the value of their respective underlying businesses.  


Worryingly, Fullshare and Zall appear to have pledged their cross-holdings as collateral to take out short 


term loans.  This creates a highly unstable situation where banks hold two absurdly overvalued stocks as 


collateral.  If share prices fall, which inevitably they must, banks may be forced to sell the shares held as 


collateral to secure their loans.  This will cause the share prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more.  


In our opinion, this is the exact scenario which caused a sudden, dramatic collapse in the price of Tech Pro 


and Hanergy’s shares.   





2. Secret Dispositions of Valuable Assets and Subsidiaries to Undisclosed Related Parties.  In our opinion, Fullshare 
has used to smokescreen of its rising stock price to transfer many of the Company’s most valuable assets and 


subsidiaries to entities which are secretly owned by or connected to the chairman or his family.   





a. Highest Profit-Margin Subsidiary Secretly Sold to Chairman’s Brothers.  In June 2016, Fullshare sold 
Fullshare Green Building and its subsidiaries (together, the “Green Energy Group”) to a supposedly independent 


third party, Jiasheng Construction Group Co Ltd (“JCC”), for a total consideration of RMB 240 million.  Fullshare 


Green Building was the Company’s only material subsidiary in its Green Building Services segment, which 


boasted a 44% profit margin and accounted for 63% of Fullshare’s FY 2015 operating profits.  Fullshare said 


that JCC was an independent third party, yet SAIC filings reveal that Fullshare’s chairman’s brothers were major 


shareholders of the buyer.  In sum, we believe that Fullshare sold its only material subsidiary in its highest profit-


margin segment to an undisclosed related party at a significantly discounted price.  In our opinion, this transaction 


represents a brazen violation of shareholder rights and (we presume) Hong Kong securities laws.  This alone 


justifies a significant regulatory investigation and renders Fullshare simply uninvestible.   





b. Property Development Business Too.  On November 27, 2015, Fullshare sold a property development and a 
parcel of land to a supposedly independent third party, Nanjing Dongzhou, for RMB 524 million.  SAIC filings 


reveal that prior to the transaction, the buyer’s parent company (Nanjing Yuanqing) secretly pledged all of 


Nanjing Dongzhou’s equity to Jiasheng Property Development Company Limited (“JPD”), an entity owned in 


part by Fullshare’s chairman, in exchange for a RMB 152.6 million loan.  This loan was sufficient to make the 


initial payment on the acquisition.  Put simply, SAIC filings reveal that an entity owned in part by the chairman 


secretly financed the acquisition of a property development and land from Fullshare.  SAIC filings also 


reveal that immediately prior to the transaction, Nanjing Chuang Su Investment (“Nanjing Sue”), another entity 


which we believe is secretly connected to or controlled by the chairman, acquired control of the buyer’s parent 


company.  We therefore infer that Fullshare’s chairman was the ultimate beneficiary of the transaction, but routed 


it through a complicated web of interconnected entities to mask his role in the transaction.   





c. Chairman’s Brother Secretly Financed Another Disposition.  In June 2015, Fullshare sold its subsidiary, 
Jiangsu Fullshare Property Ltd (“Jiangsu Fullshare”), for RMB 467 million.  The Company claimed that the buyer 


was an independent third party.  However, SAIC filings show that prior to the acquisition, Fullshare’s chairman’s 


brother lent the buyer 81% of the cash necessary to acquire Jiangsu Fullshare from the Company.  Given that 


Fullshare failed to disclose this secret related party involvement, and that the chairman’s brother appears to have 


financed the transaction, we infer that the chairman or his family were the ultimate beneficiaries of the deal.  In 


our view, this is yet another example of assets being secretly looted by the chairman or his family to the detriment 


of shareholders.  





d. Marine Business Also Secretly Sold to JCC.  In December 2016, Fullshare acquired 74% of China High Speed 
Transmission Equipment Group Co., Ltd (“CHS”), listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the ticker 


(HK: 0658), for a total consideration of RMB 10.9 billion.  Consideration was paid in Fullshare’s stock.  Three 


months later, CHS sold its marine equipment business for RMB 607 million.  Fullshare did not reveal the 


identity of the buyer, but claimed that it was an “independent third party.”  However, SAIC filings revealed 


that the buyer was JCC.  This was the same related party to which Fullshare sold its highest profit-margin business, 


the Green Energy Group, in June 2016.  The chairman and his brothers were longtime employees and shareholders 


of JCC.  The chairman’s private conglomerate not only discloses a long-term partnership with JCC, but also 


guarantees JCC’s bank loans.  In our opinion, the evidence indicates that this was another example of insiders 


secretly selling assets and businesses from the publicly listed vehicle to entities controlled by or connected to the 


chairman or his family.

e. Singapore Sling.  In December 2016, Fullshare sold its 51% equity interest in a Singapore joint venture, Fudaksu 
Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the “Fudaksu JV”), to Chinafair Investment Limited (“Chinafair”), for cash 


consideration of RMB 120 million.  As usual, Fullshare claimed that the buyer was an independent third party.  


The evidence suggests otherwise.  Chinafair’s directors serve as the general manager, executive director and board 


supervisor of Nanjing Saiteng, which according to Fullshare Trade’s website, is a subsidiary of Nanjing Fullshare 


Industrial Holding Group Co. Limited, the chairman’s privately owned conglomerate (“Fullshare Private”).  


Furthermore, Chinafair’s directors are also the shareholder, legal representative, chairman, director, and general 


manager of Fullshare Leisure Agricultural, a company which represents to job applicants that it is also subsidiary 


of Fullshare Private.  Very little information is disclosed regarding the assets or business that were sold, but given 


that Fullshare concealed the related party nature of the disposition, we suspect that the transaction was at a price 


highly dilutive to the Company’s shareholders.   





3. Undisclosed Related Party Acquisitions.  We have also uncovered instances where Fullshare acquired businesses 
or assets from parties secretly connected to or controlled by its chairman or his family.  Like undisclosed related party 


dispositions, we believe that these undisclosed related party acquisitions signify a complete disregard for shareholder 


rights and Hong Kong securities laws and call into question the value of the acquired assets.  





a. Tianyun Hustle.  In October 2014, Fullshare bought 80% of Nanjing Tianyun for RMB 500 million, supposedly 
from an independent third party named Tonglu.  Yet according to SAIC filings, Tonglu was only incorporated 


three months before the transaction.  Shortly after it was formed, Tonglu acquired Nanjing Tianyun from an entity 


owned by Fullshare’s chairman’s brother.  Fullshare claimed to have acquired Nanjing Tianyun at a major 


discount, and recognized RMB 238 million as a non-cash “gain on bargain purchase” in its FY 2014 financial 


statements.  Such gains would, even under normal circumstances, look dubious.  Why would a seller transfer an 


entity to Fullshare at below its market value? But in this case, such gains are even more suspect, because records 


show that the chairman’s brother owned Nanjing Tianyuan before selling it to the Company through a newly-


formed shell entity.  Are investors really supposed to believe that the chairman’s family sold an asset to the public 


Company at a price significantly below its market value? We think not.   





b. Zhonghe Hustle.  In September 2016, Fullshare bought 35% of Nanjing Jiansheng from a claimed independent 
third party, Nanjing Zhonghe, for RMB 17.5 million.  Yet SAIC filings show that the chairman’s brother was a 


shareholder and sole legal representative of Nanjing Zhonghe until July 2015.  At that point, he transferred it to 


another entity, which we believe is also secretly connected to the chairman and his family.  We think the evidence 


clearly indicates that the chairman or his family secretly sold the asset to the public company.  In our view, the 


fact that Fullshare concealed such connections suggests that shareholders were ripped off. 





Valuation.  In this report, we present intraday trading data which indicates, in our opinion, that both Fullshare’s and Zall’s 


share prices are being manipulated upwards in the final hour of trading.  Because of the significant cross-holdings between 


the two companies, such manipulation has the perverse effect of creating significant unrealized non-cash gains from the 


appreciation of their respective stock prices.  In FY 2016, gains from the appreciation of Zall’s stock accounted for a 


staggering 108% of Fullshare’s net income.  Such gains, by artificially inflating net income, in turn artificially inflate each 


company’s respective stock price.   





In our view, this perverse cycle has caused the stock price of Zall and Fullshare to soar.  Evidence suggests that both 


companies then pledged their respective cross-shareholdings to take out short term loans.  This creates a highly unstable 


situation where banks hold two absurdly overvalued stocks as collateral.  If share prices fall, which inevitably they must, 


banks could be forced to sell the shares held as collateral to secure their loans.  This will cause the share prices to fall further, 


prompting banks to sell more.  In our opinion, this is the exact scenario which caused a sudden, dramatic decrease in the 


price of Tech Pro’s, Huishan Dairy’s and Hanergy’s respective shares.   





In this report, we also present evidence that Fullshare has used to smokescreen of its rising stock price to transfer many of 


the Company’s most profitable assets to entities which are secretly owned by or connected to the chairman or his family.  In 


our years of examining Hong Kong stocks, we have never seen as many undisclosed related party transactions as we have 


discovered with Fullshare.  Such transactions evince a complete disregard for Hong Kong securities laws and shareholder 


rights and render Fullshare’s stock simply uninvestible.   





Fullshare is so overvalued that even if we ignore any evidence of corruption, we would expect a 76% downside in Fullshare’s 


stock price.  Investors do not typically give credit for non-recurring, one-time gains, especially if they occur outside of the
4 





Fullshare Holdings Ltd. │ HK: 0607                         www.glaucusresearch.com 





core business.  If we adjust Fullshare’s income statement to remove such gains, we calculate that the Company’s earnings 


from its continuing operations were only RMB 303 million in FY 2016.   





As a basis of comparison, Fullshare is included in the Hang Seng Composite Properties and Construction Index (“HSCIPC”) 


along with 105 other Hong Kong listed companies.  The median Hong Kong company in the HSCIPC trades at a multiple of 


11.8x price to trailing twelve months earnings from continuing operations.  If Fullshare simply traded at the same multiple 


for TTM earnings from continuing operations as the median company in the HSCIPC, it would imply a share price of HKD 


0.21 per share.   





Nor does the inclusion of any recent acquisitions make Fullshare’s share price look any more appropriate.  If we give full 


credit to Fullshare’s 74% investment in CHS, at CHS’s current market capitalization, it adds only HKD 0.47 per share to 


Fullshare’s valuation.   





Accordingly, even including the value of CHS, if Fullshare traded at the median multiple of earnings for other HSCIPC 


companies, Fullshare’s stock would be worth only HKD 0.68 per share, implying an 76% downside in the Company’s stock.   





Measured on a price to book ratio, Fullshare’s shares appear similarly overvalued.  We calculate that on an adjusted basis, if 


Fullshare simply traded at the HSCIPC median, it would be valued at HKD 0.97 per share, a 66% downside from its current 


price.1   





But of course, we think that Fullshare should trade far below an index median, given the evidence presented in this report of 


ubiquitous undisclosed related party dealings and the unusual intraday trading pattern of its stock.  Applying a 20% corruption 


discount yields a Glaucus valuation of HKD 0.55 per share (on an adjusted P/E multiple) or HKD 0.77 (on an adjusted P/B 


multiple). 





    
Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 


Note: Both valuation methodologies give full credit to Fullshare’s interest in CHS. 





Ultimately, in this report, we present evidence that the Company’s stock is manipulated and that its chairman and his family 


have engaged in a number of undisclosed related party transactions to loot the Company’s best businesses.  Such behavior 


by the Company’s inner circle is so reprehensible and untrustworthy that we believe that Fullshare is simply uninvestible.

INTRADAY TRADING PATTERNS INDICATE STOCK MANIPULATION 





Fullshare Holdings Ltd (“Fullshare” or the “Company”)’s operating business went public in December 2013 via a 


reverse merger on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Since then, Fullshare’s market capitalization has grown at a 541% 


CAGR from HKD 287 million to a high of HKD 76 billion in 3 years!  Despite a 264x increase in market capitalization 


since the reverse merger, Fullshare’s cash flows from its recurring operations (before working capital adjustments) 


has increased a paltry 28%.2   





Fullshare went from losing over RMB 1.1 billion in 2014, to generating RMB 3.1 billion in net income in 2016, which 


on paper appears to be an impressive trajectory.  Yet dig deeper and such reported profits are not generated from any 


operating business or recurring source of revenues, but derived primarily from unrealized non-cash gains from the 


appreciation of an investment in another public company: Zall Group Ltd. (HK: 2098) (“Zall”).   





In April 2015, Zall issued HKD 781 million in stock to Fullshare’s chairman Ji.  At the time, Zall was so heavily 


indebted that it was not in compliance under the debt covenants of a USD 100 million convertible bond issuance to 


Pacific Alliance Group.  The proceeds from the issuance of stock to Fullshare’s chairman helped Zall pay off these 


bonds and presumably avoid a default on this debt.   





In June 2015, Zall acquired a 4.8% equity interest in Fullshare for HKD 1.35 per share.  In November 2015, Fullshare’s 


chairman Ji sold his stake in Zall (869 million shares, 8.2% of total shares outstanding) to Fullshare at a price of HKD 


1.2 per share, for a total consideration of HKD 1.04 billion.   





Far from being an attractive investment, Zall was and remains a deeply troubled company.  The year of Fullshare’s 


investment, Zall lost RMB 1.4 billion in cash from its operations.  From FY 2010 to FY 2016, Zall lost a total of RMB 


6.5 billion in cash from operations.  





 Zall’s Cash Losses from Operations 


 
Source: Zall Annual Reports 





Nor did Zall show any signs of improvement.  The year that Fullshare invested, Zall’s revenue declined 48% and Zall 


was unable to generate enough EBITDA from its operating business to even cover its interest payments.   





Zall’s Interest Payments to EBITDA Ratio

Note: EBITDA=Profit from operations before changes in FV of investment properties +Depreciation &

As one would expect from a deeply troubled company, Zall’s failure to generate profits or cash from operations 


resulted in non-compliance with the debt covenants on a substantial portion of its borrowings.

In 2015, Zall’s revenues fell by 48%, its continuing operations resulted in huge cash losses, and Zall was unable (and

Zall was not in compliance with its debt covenants, and presumably the only reason it was not thrown into bankruptcy

Since then, share prices of both Zall’s and Fullshare’s stocks have mysteriously surged, despite little justification for 


such appreciation from their underlying businesses.  The share prices of Fullshare and Zall jumped 466% and 519%,

Some might counter that both stocks have appreciated in price due to increased profitability.  However, these profits 


are predominantly non-cash gains from the appreciation of each other’s stock price.  In FY 2016, unrealized gains 


from Fullshare’s investment in Zall represented 108% of Fullshare’s net income.   





Fullshare's Gains from Appreciation of Zall’s Shares 


 
Source: Fullshare 2015 and 2016 Annual Reports 





Similarly, Zall has booked non-cash gains from the price appreciation of Fullshare’s stock. In 2016, Zall booked over 


RMB 1.1 billion in unrealized non-cash gains from its 680 million share investment in Fullshare’s stock, accounting 


for 54% of Zall’s total net income last year.     





Zall's Gains from Appreciation of Fullshare’s Shares 


 
Source: Zall 2015 and 2016 Annual Reports 





The appreciation of Fullshare’s and Zall’s respective stock prices is so detached from the fundamental value of their 


operating businesses, that in our opinion, the likely explanation for the surge in their stock prices is market 


manipulation.  





Evidence of manipulation can be found in intraday trading patterns, particularly the appreciation of a company’s stock 


in the last hour of trading.  Gains throughout the trading day, over time, should be uniform.  Yet market commentators 


such as the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have pointed out that other Hong Kong stocks which were 


likely stock manipulations, such as Hanergy and Tech Pro (which Glaucus exposed in a report published July 2016), 


posted unusual gains in the last hour or minutes of the trading day.  





For example, the Wall Street Journal reported that in the year before March 2016, “Tech Pro’s stock returned 43%. 


But if an investor had bought shares an hour before trading closed, sold them at the end of Hong Kong’s trading 


session, and then reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner, the return would be a remarkably high

791%.” The same pattern of unusual gains in the last hour of trading, which was indicative of market manipulation in 


Tech Pro and Hanergy, is evident in the trading of Fullshare’s shares.   





Bloomberg maintains intraday trading data for Hong Kong securities for the past 140 trading days.  Manipulated 


stocks are typically manipulated upwards in the last hour of the trading day.  So we compared the returns generated 


from two different trading strategies over the period from November 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017.  First, we 


calculated the returns if an investor simply purchased the shares on day 1 of the period and sold them at the end of the 


period.  We refer to this as the buy-and-hold strategy.   





We compared this to the returns of a last-hour trading strategy.  With the last-hour trading strategy, we modeled 


the compounded returns if, each day, an investor bought the subject stock at 3:00 pm (Hong Kong time), sold the 


stock an hour later at the close of the market, and then reinvested the proceeds in the same manner the following day.    





As is evident in the table below, for Hong Kong’s top 15 traded stocks (measured by highest average dollars traded 


over the last six months), there is little difference in an investor’s returns between a buy-and-hold strategy versus a 


last-hour trading strategy.  In the period from November 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017,4 the median return for an 


investor who bought and held Hong Kong’s most actively traded stocks was 7.8%.  A last-hour trading strategy for 


those same stocks would have generated a median return of 3.5%.

Note: Trading Data for the Period from Nov. 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017. 





For the top 15 stocks trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by dollar volume, there was little difference in the 


median returns over this period between a buy-and-hold strategy and a last-hour trading strategy.  This is what we 


would expect for non-manipulated stocks.  Indeed, our analysis shows that investors were punished in 9 of 15 cases 


with lower returns for only trading the last hour, as opposed to buying and holding throughout the same period.   





But the results were much different for Fullshare, and its largest investment, Zall.  Over the same period, a buy-and-


hold strategy of Fullshare’s stock would have resulted in a loss of -34%!  By comparison, a compounded last-hour 


trading strategy for Fullshare generated returns of 76%! That is the equivalent of 72 bps per trading day. The 


difference between the returns for a last-hour trading strategy and a buy-and-hold strategy was a staggering 110%.

Similarly, Zall’s shares experienced a decline of -9.0% over the same period, but if an investor used a compounded 


last-hour strategy to trade Zall’s shares, the return would have been a highly unusual 58%. 





Put another way, a last-hour trading strategy in Fullshare’s stock generated 21x the amount of returns than the median 


return for the last-hour trading strategy of Hong Kong’s top 15 actively traded stocks.  Just like in Hanergy and Tech 


Pro, we believe that this trading pattern of highly unusual gains in the final hour of trading is indicative of stock 


manipulation.   





A comparison of the intraday returns for the top 30 Hong Kong listed companies in the HSCIPC index5 shows a similar 


anomaly in the trading of Fullshare’s and Zall’s stocks.

difference was -9.7%, indicating that in the majority of examples, investors were worse off if they traded only the last 


hour of each trading day.  Yet for Fullshare and Zall, the last-hour trading strategy generated 110% and 67% greater 


returns, respectively, compared to simply buying and holding over the same period.   





We think that the intraday trading data clearly shows that like Tech Pro and Hanergy, trading in the shares of Fullshare 


and Zall (its biggest source of profits) are manipulated.  The significant cross-holdings between Fullshare and Zall 


allow each company to generate massive non-cash gains, and since such gains are a significant portion of each 


company’s reported net income, it creates a cycle of artificial stock price appreciation.  Conversely, without such 


gains, we believe that each company’s respective profits and stock prices would plummet.

Alarmingly, both Fullshare and Zall appear to have pledged each other’s stock as collateral for bank loans in 2016. 


Fullshare’s 2016 Annual Results Announcement discloses that it pledged RMB 2.46 billion worth of its held-for-


trading financial assets as collateral for loans. We note that Fullshare’s holdings of Zall stock is valued at RMB 5.1 


billion, accounting for 93% of its total financial assets held for trading, therefore the RMB 2.46 billion in pledged 


shares must be predominantly Zall stock (if not all Zall stock).

As highlighted below, bank loans payable within one year or on demand is the only category that increased by a large 


enough magnitude to include the RMB 2.46 billion in newly pledged assets, so we can infer that the Company’s shares 


of Zall are pledged as collateral for short-term loans which are due either on demand or within the year.

Similarly, Zall disclosed that it pledged all of its 680 million shares of Fullshare (equivalent to RMB 2.2 billion) as 


collateral for bank loans in 2016.

Evidence indicates that Fullshare has pledged its shares in Zall as collateral to secure short term loans, just as Zall has 


pledged its shares in Fullshare as collateral to secure short term loans.7  This is a recipe for disaster.  If the price of 


either stock declines, banks holding Fullshare or Zall’s stock as collateral will be forced to sell off the shares, further 


forcing down the prices of the respective stocks.  This further devalues the collateral, forcing banks to sell more stock. 


In our view, if either stock drops, both stocks are at risk of a sudden collapse, just like Tech Pro.

7 Zall does not disclose the term of the loans obtained in exchange for its pledge of Fullshare’s stock, but its financial statements 


indicate that such borrowings were short term loans (due within 1-2 years) because that is the only category of indebtedness 


which increased in a sufficient amount in FY 2016.

We suspect management is aware of this dynamic, and note that Zall’s co-chairman Mr. Yu Gang and Executive 


Director Mr. Cui Jinfeng both unloaded a material portion of their personal holdings of Zall starting from December 


2015, while the shares still have value.

Fullshare’s stock has risen so high, a decline is inevitable. Fullshare’s operating business is tiny, producing minimal 


recurring cash flows from a series of undistinguished property developments in China.  Despite a 264x increase in 


market capitalization since the reverse merger, Fullshare’s cash flows from its recurring operations (before working 


capital adjustments) has increased a paltry 28%.   





Fullshare is not a professional investor, and has no discernable experience or expertise in picking stocks.  But in our 


opinion, its experience with Zall generated so many gains (which we believe were due to the manipulation of Zall’s 


share price), that we believe Fullshare will try to do something similar again.  





As of FYE 2016, Fullshare had established substantial investments in ten other publicly traded companies.  We only 


have access to intraday trading data for the Hong Kong listed companies, but in at least three other cases, the intraday 


trading patterns show the unusual gains in the last hour which are indicative of stock manipulation.

We think that Fullshare is trying to fool the market with such investments as they did with Zall, generating a pattern 


of unrealized gains with investments in publicly traded stocks, which in at least three other cases highlighted above, 


generate unusually high returns in the last hour of trading.  We think that Fullshare may use such investments to inflate 


its reported profits, thus further inflating its own share price.  What is the end goal of such a scheme?  





In this report, we present evidence that suggests management has engaged in material undisclosed related party 


transactions to benefit the chairman and his family at the expense of shareholders.  As such, we believe Fullshare is 


simply uninvestible.

SECRET DISPOSITIONS OF VALUABLE ASSETS TO UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTIES 





In our opinion, Fullshare has used to smokescreen of its rising stock price to transfer many of the Company’s most valuable 


assets and subsidiaries to entities which are secretly owned by or connected to the chairman or his family.   


1) Highest Profit-Margin Subsidiary Secretly Sold to Chairman’s Brothers 
 


On June 29, 2016, Fullshare sold Fullshare Green Building Group Company Limited, (“Fullshare Green Building”) 


and its subsidiaries (together, the “Green Energy Group”) to a supposedly independent third party, Jiasheng 


Construction Group Co Ltd (“JCC”), for a total consideration of RMB 240 million in cash.   


This transaction was odd for several reasons.  First, in the Company’s FY 2015 annual report, Fullshare disclosed that 


Fullshare Green Building, also known as Fullshare Lujian, was the only material subsidiary involved in its Green 


Building Service segment.  Although Fullshare admitted that seven other subsidiaries were involved in this segment, 


it stated that they were immaterial to the Company.

Fullshare Holdings Ltd. │ HK: 0607                         www.glaucusresearch.com 





Green Building Services was Fullshare’s highest profit-margin segment.  During the time that Fullshare owned the 


Green Energy Group (FY 2015 and 1H 2016), the Company’s Green Building Services segment operated at a 35% 


profit margin, compared to a measly 10% profit margin from Fullshare’s property development segment.  


  
Source: Company Annual Reports 


Note: 1. In 1H 2016, Fullshare’s Health equipment & service segment generated net losses. 


2. This table compares only operating business segments. 


Although its Green Building Services segment accounted for only 9% of the Company’s revenues in FY 2015, because 


it was so much more profitable than the property development segment, it accounted for 63% of Fullshare’s FY 2015 


operating profits.8   


As discussed extensively in this report, Fullshare’s market capitalization and share price are completely unjustifiable 


in light of the Company’s tiny operating business and its lack of recurring operating profits.  So why would a 


Company starving for recurring profits dispose of its only material subsidiary in its highest profit-margin 


segment?  


We believe that the answer is simple: Fullshare secretly sold the business to entities connected to its chairman for a 


discounted price.  Fullshare stated in both its 2016 interim report and the disposal announcement that the buyer of the 


Green Energy Group, JCC, was an independent third party.  








Source: Fullshare Green Building Group Disposal Announcement 


However, SAIC filings reveal that Fullshare’s chairman’s two brothers owned 29% of JCC, the supposedly 


independent buyer, at the time of the transaction.9

SAIC filings indicate that the chairman’s brothers were significant shareholders of JCC, the supposed independent 


buyer of Fullshare’s highest profit-margin business, from at least 2013 through the time when Fullshare sold JCC its 


key business segment.10  In our view, this is obviously a major violation of shareholders’ rights and presumably a 


material breach of Hong Kong securities rules.

Green Energy Group Disposal 





A simple search of the filings shows that Fullshare sold its highest profit-margin segment to a company connected to 


its chairman, and lied about it by telling shareholders that the buyer was an independent third party.   


There is also reason to believe that Fullshare sold its chairman’s brothers the Green Energy Group at a price below its 


market value.  Fullshare acquired Fullshare Green Building (formerly known as Jiangsu Ruiheng Construction 


Company Limited) in December 2014, for RMB 200 million.  In May 2015, the Company spent RMB 28 million to 


purchase Nanjing Fullshare Energy Management Company Limited and three other entities from a private company 


owned by the chairman.11  These entities, which we refer to collectively as the Green Energy Group, were eventually 


disposed to JCC.   





In 2014, prior to its acquisition by Fullshare, the Green Energy Group lost RMB 11 million.  A year later, the Green 


Energy Group generated RMB 40.8 million in profits.

Fullshare essentially sold the Green Energy Group for the same consideration for which Fullshare acquired it, despite 


the fact that the Green Energy Group had transformed from an unprofitable operation to the Company’s highest profit-


margin segment.   


We also reviewed the publicly available SAIC filings for Fullshare Green Building (the primary subsidiary in the 


Green Energy Group), which confirmed that it was worth substantially more when it was sold to Fullshare’s 


chairman’s brothers than when it was acquired by the Company.  SAIC filings12 showed that compared to the year 


before, in 2015, Fullshare Green Building’s revenues increased 9.4x! Profits increased a staggering 89.1x in the 


year before it was sold, suggesting Fullshare Green Building was worth substantially more at the time it was sold to 


the chairman’s brothers than it was when the Company acquired it.

Fullshare Holdings Ltd. │ HK: 0607                         www.glaucusresearch.com 








When the Company purchased Fullshare Green Building, it generated immaterial revenues and was barely profitable.  


When it secretly sold Fullshare Green Building to an entity owned in part by its chairman’s brothers, it was the 


Company’s only material subsidiary in its highest profit-margin segment.  In our opinion, the Green Energy Group 


was clearly worth substantially more at the time of disposition, meaning the chairman’s brothers were essentially 


embezzling Fullshare’s best assets from the public company at a substantially discounted price.   


Furthermore, Fullshare sold the Green Energy Group to its chairman’s brothers at 6x trailing twelve months operating 


profits (RMB 240 million / RMB 40.8 million in profits).  Given that Fullshare currently trades at 431x EBIT from 


recurring operations, secretly selling businesses to its chairman’s family at 6x is highly dilutive to shareholders.  If 


Fullshare Green Building was sold at the same multiple of operating profits as Fullshare currently trades, it would 


have been sold for RMB 17.6 billion! 


Ultimately, in our opinion, SAIC filings show that Fullshare secretly sold its highest profit-margin business to its 


chairman’s brothers for a massive discount.  This alone warrants a full regulatory investigation, and renders the 


Company simply uninvestible.   


2) Property Development Business Too 
 


This was not even the only time that Fullshare secretly sold a business to the chairman or his family.  On November 


27, 2015, Fullshare sold 100% of the equity of two property development subsidiaries, Jurong Dingsheng Property 


Development Company Limited (“Jurong Dingsheng”) and Jurong Dasheng Property Development Company Limited 


(“Jurong Dasheng”) (collectively, the “Jurong Twins”), to Nanjing Dongzhou Property Development Limited 


(“Nanjing Dongzhou”) for RMB 524 million.  





Source: 2015 Annual Report, p.166 


In the disposition announcement, the Company claimed that the buyer of the Jurong Twins, Nanjing Dongzhou, was 


an independent third party.

Fullshare sold the Jurong Twins to Nanjing Dongzhou in November 2015.  SAIC filings show that in August 2015, 


Nanjing Dongzhou’s sole shareholder at the time, Nanjng Yuanqing, pledged 100% of Nanjing Dongzhou’s equity to 


Nanjing Jiasheng Property Development (“JPD”), an entity owned in part by Fullshare’s chairman, for a loan of RMB 


152.6 million.

Chairman’s Ownership of JPD

Nanjing Dongzhou purchased the Jurong Twins after its sole shareholder pledged its equity to JPD in exchange for a 


RMB 152.6 million loan.  In essence, SAIC filings indicate that Fullshare’s chairman was a shareholder of an entity 


that secretly financed the purchase of the Jurong Twins from the Company.

Given that he financed the transaction, it cannot be a stretch to presume that Fullshare’s chairman was the ultimate 


beneficiary of the sale.  But there is more.   


a) A Boy Named Sue 
 


On November 23, 2015, just four days before the completion of the transaction, an entity called Nanjing Chuang Su 


Investment (“Nanjing Sue”) acquired Nanjing Yuanqing, the parent company of the buyer, Nanjing Dongzhou.   


We believe that Nanjing Sue is an undisclosed related party, connected to and likely controlled by Fullshare’s 


chairman.  First, SAIC filings reveal that as of June 2013, Nanjing Sue rented office space from Nanjing Fullshare 


Industrial Holding Group Co. Limited (a company privately owned by the Company’s chairman) (“Fullshare 


Private”),13 for RMB 50,000 per year.  The lease was for five years, meaning that Nanjing Sue was still operating out 


of the chairman’s property when it secretly acquired a controlling interest in the Jurong Twins.

Second, SAIC filings show that Nanjing Sue’s board supervisor is an individual named Xing Jiuhong.

investment holding company which is 99.9% owned by Fullshare’s chairman.

Third, according to a bond prospectus filed by Fullshare’s chairman’s private conglomerate (which we refer to as 


Fullshare Private), Nanjing Sue borrowed around RMB 937 million from Fullshare Private in 2014, and borrowed 


RMB 588 million from it in 2015.   


Fullshare Private Loans to Nanjing Sue

interest income reported on such loans in Fullshare Private’s bond prospectus. 


Fullshare Private 2016 2nd Bond Prospectus 


 
Source: Fullshare Private 2016 2nd Bond Prospectus, p. 140  





Nanjing Sue borrowed hundreds of millions of Chinese yuan from Fullshare Private, which was more than enough 


money to finance its subsidiary’s secret purchase of the Jurong Twins for RMB 524 million from the Company.   


Given that Nanjing Sue leases offices from Fullshare Private, borrows hundreds of millions of yuan from Fullshare’s 


chairman, and shares a board supervisor with another of his entities, we believe that Nanjing Sue is related to, and

most likely controlled by, Fullshare’s chairman.  Coupled with the evidence he financed the transaction through secret 


loans to the buyer, we infer that the chairman was the undisclosed beneficiary of the sale of the Jurong Twins.   


Disposal of Jurong Twins to Undisclosed Related Party 





The structure of the transaction benefited the buyer, who only had to put down RMB 52 million, 10% of the total 


consideration at the time of the sale.  The remaining consideration was to be paid 120 business days after the 


completion of the transaction.  The amount borrowed by Nanjing Yuanqing from the chairman’s JPD (RMB 152 


million) was easily enough to cover the entire initial purchase payment, and the amount borrowed by Nanjing Sue 


(RMB 587 million) from the chairman’s Fullshare Private was more than enough to cover the rest of the purchase 


price.   


In our opinion, this is simply another example of the chairman or his family secretly looting assets from the publicly 


traded Company.  That such related party connections were concealed indicates that this transaction was very likely 


to the detriment of Fullshare’s public shareholders.

3) Chairman’s Brother Secretly Financed Another Disposition 
 


On June 25, 2015, Fullshare sold Jiangsu Fullshare Property Limited (“Jiangsu Fullshare”) to Nanjing Shanbao 


Investment Management Limited (“Nanjing Shanbao”) for RMB 467 million.  Fullshare recorded a RMB 79 million 


non-cash gain on the disposal.  Fullshare claimed that the buyer, Nanjing Shanbao, was an independent third party.

100% of the equity of its subsidiary, Lianyungang Shunfeng Property Development Company Limited (“Shunfeng”) 


to Nanjing Jiangong Group Co., Ltd (“Nanjing Jiangong”) in exchange for a loan of RMB 378 million.  Nanjing 


Jiangong, which secretly financed the transaction, is more than 50% owned by Fullshare’s chairman’s brother.

Jiangsu Fullshare Disposal 





SAIC filings make it clear that the chairman’s brother secretly loaned 81% of the money that the buyer needed to 


acquire Jiangsu Fullshare, which held the rights to three potentially lucrative property developments in Jiangsu.  Given 


that the Company failed to disclose this secret related party involvement, and that the chairman’s brother appears to 


have put up the money for the purchase, we infer that the chairman and his family were the ultimate beneficiaries of 


the transaction.   


4) Marine Business Also Secretly Sold to JCC 
 


On December 5, 2016, Fullshare acquired 74% of China High Speed Transmission Equipment Group Co., Ltd 


(“CHS”), listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the ticker (HK: 0658), for a total consideration of RMB 


10.9 billion.  Consideration was paid in shares of Fullshare.  It did not take long until Fullshare was up to its old tricks.   





On February 23, 2017, CHS entered into a sale and purchase agreement to dispose its 100% interests in subsidiary 


Nanjing High Accurate Marine Equipment Co., Ltd (“Marine Equipment”) for a total consideration of RMB 607 


million.  Fullshare did not reveal the identity of the buyer, but claimed that it was an “independent third party.”     





 
Source: 2016 Fullshare Annual Result Announcement, p.42 





However, publicly available SAIC filing revealed that the buyer of Marine Equipment was JCC, the same related party 


to which Fullshare sold its highest profit-margin business, the Green Energy Group, in June 2016.

Rather than an independent third party as Fullshare claimed, JCC has deep historical ties to its chairman and his family.

of JCC as far back as 1999, when JCC was called Nanjing Jiangnan Construction Company.14

Even though the chairman’s brothers sold their shares of JCC in November 2016, we think the evidence shows that 


JCC remains an undisclosed related party, given the longstanding connections between Fullshare and JCC and the fact 


that the chairman’s Fullshare’s Private guarantees JCC’s debts.  The numerous overlapping connections are 


summarized in the diagram below.  


 
Source: SAIC filings and company public filings 


Ultimately, we think it highly suspicious that after Fullshare took control, CHS sold Marine Equipment for RMB 607 


million without revealing the identity of the buyer.  SAIC filings show that the buyer, far from being an independent 


third party as the Company claimed, was JCC, an entity with lasting and entrenched ties to Fullshare, its chairman and 


his family.   


Fullshare’s affinity for selling assets to JCC shows no signs of abating.  In December 2016, Fullshare sold its 100% 


equity interest in Guangzhou Fullshare Healthcare and its subsidiary to JCC for cash consideration of RMB 55 million.  


Typically, Fullshare told investors that the buyer was an independent third party, even though, in our opinion, JCC is 


far from independent.  We believe that this is yet another example of insiders secretly selling assets and businesses 


from the publicly listed vehicle to entities controlled by or connected to the chairman or his family.

In December 2016, Fullshare sold its 51% equity interest in a Singapore joint venture, Fudaksu Pte. Ltd. and its 


subsidiaries (the “Fudaksu JV”), to Chinafair Investment Limited (“Chinafair”), for cash consideration of RMB 120 


million.  As usual, Fullshare claimed that the buyer was an independent third party.  The evidence suggests otherwise.   


The corporate registry records of Chinafair, a Hong Kong holding company, list Mao Zhengping, Chen Yu and Yang 


Wen-Ta as its directors. 








Source: www.icris.cr.gov.hk 


Publicly available SAIC filings reveal that Mao Zhengping is currently the executive director and general manager of 


Nanjing Saiteng Trading Company (“Nanjing Saiteng”).  SAIC filings also state that Chen Yu, another director of 


Chinafair, is the board supervisor of Nanjing Saiteng.

In sum, SAIC filings, a corporate website and online job postings indicate that Chinafair, the supposed independent 


third party which purchased the Fudaksu JV from the Company for RMB 120 million, is an undisclosed related party 


with a multitude of connections to Fullshare.  Chinafair’s directors are the general manager, executive director and 


board supervisor of Nanjing Saiteng, which according to Fullshare Trade’s website, is a subsidiary of the chairman’s 


Fullshare Private. Chinafair’s directors are also the shareholders, legal representative, chairman, director, and general 


manager of Fullshare Leisure Agricultural, a company which represents to job applicants that it is a subsidiary of 


Fullshare Private.   


Fullshare has provided virtually no information to investors about its initial investment or the assets, financial 


performance or operations of the Fudaksu JV.  Fullshare invested RMB 100 million in the Fudaksu JV in February 


2016, but without more details, it is difficult to analyze whether it was sold to a party connected to the chairman’s 


conglomerate at below its market value.  But given that Fullshare concealed the related party nature of the transaction, 


we suspect that like other undisclosed related party dispositions, the transaction was at a price highly dilutive to the 


Company’s shareholders.

UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY ACQUISITIONS 


We have also uncovered instances where Fullshare acquired businesses or assets from parties secretly connected to or 


controlled by its chairman or his family.  Like undisclosed related party dispositions, we believe that these undisclosed 


related party acquisitions signify a complete disregard for shareholder rights and Hong Kong securities laws and call 


into question the value of the acquired assets.  


1) Tianyun Hustle 
 


On October 15, 2014, Fullshare bought 80% of the equity of Nanjing Tianyun Real Estate Development Company 


Limited (“Nanjing Tianyun”) from Nanjing Tonglu Asset Management Limited (“Tonglu”) for RMB 500 million.15  


In the acquisition announcement, Fullshare stated that the sellers were independent third parties.    


 
Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0905/LTN20140905929.pdf  


Yet SAIC filings suggest that the primary seller, Tonglu, was a newly-formed shell entity secretly connected to the 


chairman’s family.  According to SAIC filings, Tonglu was incorporated on July 15, 2014, just three months before it 


sold Nanjing Tianyun to the Company.   


 
Source: SAIC filing

from Nanjing Jiangong, which is more than 50% owned by Fullshare chairman’s brother: Ji Changbin.

To summarize.  In July 2014, an entity majority owned by the chairman’s brother transferred Nanjing Tianyun to a 


recently incorporated shell entity (Tonglu), which turned around and sold it to Fullshare for RMB 500 million only 


three months later.  





In our view, this was clearly an undisclosed related party transaction.  We believe that the chairman’s brother sold 


Nanjing Tianyun to the public company, but so as to conceal the family’s involvement, routed the RMB 500 million 


transaction through a newly-formed shell entity.    


This calls into question the value of the acquired assets.  After all, why would the company hide the related party 


nature of the acquisition from shareholders if it was a fair deal? 


There is another wrinkle.  Fullshare told shareholders it acquired Nanjing Tianyun at a large discount to its market 


value.  Specifically, Fullshare claimed in its FY 2014 annual report that the net asset value of 80% of Nanjing Tianyun
40

was RMB 738 million.  By only paying RMB 500 million to acquire the equity, Fullshare recognized RMB 238 million 


as a non-cash “gain on bargain purchase” in its FY 2014 financial statements.  


 
Source: FY 2014 Company Annual Report, p. 115. 


Even without the evidence that this was secretly a related party acquisition, such “gains on bargain purchases” are 


dubious.  Why would a seller sell an asset at below its net asset value?  


But in this case, it is even more suspect, because records show that the chairman’s brother owned Nanjing Tianyun 


before selling it to the Company via a newly-formed shell entity.  Are investors really supposed to believe that the 


chairman’s family sold an asset to the public company at a significant discount to the market price? We think not.   


The gain on the purchase of Nanjing Tianyun was RMB 238 million, which was significantly higher than RMB 94 


million in recurring operating profit reported by Fullshare in FY 2014.16  Not only does the undisclosed related 


party acquisition merit a full inquiry, but we doubt whether any related gain on purchase recognized on the transaction 


was legitimate.  In our opinion, not only is this evidence of an undisclosed related party transaction, but we believe 


that dubious non-cash gains were used to artificially inflate Fullshare’s FY 2014 earnings.  


2) Nanjing Zhonghe 
 


On September 27, 2016, Fullshare bought 35% of Nanjing Jiansheng Real Estate Development Co Ltd (“Nanjing 


Jiansheng”) from Nanjing Zhonghe Shiye Investment Development Company Limited (“Nanjing Zhonghe”) for RMB 


17.5 million.  As per usual, Fullshare claimed that the seller, Nanjing Zhonghe, was an independent third party.

However, publicly available SAIC filing reveals that Ji Changrong, brother of Fullshare’s chairman, was the 


shareholder and sole legal representative of Nanjing Zhonghe until July 2015, when he transferred his shares to the 


entity Nanjing Sue.  As discussed above, Nanjing Sue leases office space and borrows hundreds of millions of Chinese 


yuan from the chairman’s Fullshare Private.  Nanjing Sue also shares a board supervisor with another entity owned 


by the chairman.  We therefore infer that Nanjing Sue is an undisclosed connected party.

Not only was this an undisclosed related party transaction, it was also more substantial than it originally appeared.  As 


stated in its acquisition announcement, Fullshare is required by the terms of the acquisition agreement to pay initial 


development costs no less than RMB 45.5 million on top of the acquisition price.  It makes the total cash cost of this 


transaction RMB 63 million.

Fullshare fails to disclose many details regarding the financial condition, operations or value of its interest in the 


Nanjing Jiansheng JV, so we are left to speculate as to the motivation behind selling it to the public company.  We 


suspect that the chairman (or his family) wanted to get out of the investment in the Nanjing Jiansheng JV, so he (or 


they) secretly sold it to the public company so that public funds would be used to pay for the related development 


costs.

VALUATION 


In this report, we presented independent intraday trading data which indicates, in our opinion, that both Fullshare’s 


and Zall’s share prices are being manipulated upwards in the final hour of trading.  Because of the significant cross-


holdings between the two companies, such manipulation has the perverse effect of creating significant unrealized non-


cash gains from the appreciation of their respective stock prices.  In FY 2016, gains from the appreciation of Zall’s 


stock accounted for a staggering 108% of Fullshare’s net income.  Such gains, by artificially inflating net income, in 


turn artificially inflate each company’s respective stock price.   





In our view, this perverse cycle has caused the stock price of Zall and Fullshare to soar.  Evidence suggests that both 


companies then pledged their respective cross-shareholdings to take out short term loans.  This creates a highly 


unstable situation where banks hold two absurdly overvalued stocks as collateral.  If share prices fall, which inevitably 


they must, banks may be forced to sell the shares held as collateral to secure their loans.  This will cause the share 


prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more.  In our opinion, this is the exact scenario which caused a sudden, 


dramatic decrease in the price of Tech Pro and Hanergy’s shares.   





We presented evidence that Fullshare has used to smokescreen of its rising stock price to transfer many of the 


Company’s most profitable assets to entities which are secretly owned by or connected to the chairman or his family.  


It appears as though Fullshare is a classic case of insiders looting a public company of its best assets.  In our years of 


examining Hong Kong stocks, we have never seen as many undisclosed related party transactions as we have 


discovered with Fullshare.  Such transactions evince a complete disregard for Hong Kong securities laws and 


shareholder rights and render Fullshare’s stock simply uninvestible.   





Nor can investors expect any help from the chairman’s private conglomerate, Fullshare Private.  An October 2016 


bond prospectus issued by Fullshare Private shows that the conglomerate is heavily levered.  In the first half of 2016, 


Fullshare Private reported an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 13x.17 








Fullshare Private Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio

Note: EBITDA in 1H’16 is annualized 





Even more worrisome, Fullshare Private admits that RMB 8.5 billion of this debt is due by the end of 2017, despite 


the fact that the conglomerate reported 2016 annualized EBITDA of only RMB 1.5 billion and a cash balance of only 


RMB 1.4 billion.

Although Fullshare Private is ostensibly a heavily indebted real estate company, its balance sheet is light on fixed 


assets and heavy on receivables.  As of its last publicly available financials, receivables comprised 46% of total assets 


and 147% of its book value.  











                                                           
17 We include payables in the calculation because for the most part they appear to be longer term repayment obligations.  Fullshare 


Private disclosed RMB 9.7 billion in payables, and it does not appear that Fullshare Private has the cash balance or expected cash 


inflows to pay off such obligations in the short term, thus for the purpose of financial analysis, we believe it is fair to consider such 


payables a long term financial liability akin to indebtedness.    Even without including payables, Fullshare Private’s debt/EBITDA 


ratio is 7.1 for 1H FY 2016.  By any metric, the conglomerate is heavily levered.

The point is that any Fullshare investor looking to the chairman’s private company for rescue will be waiting in vain, 


as Fullshare Private is heavily levered, and does not appear to either possess or be able to generate the cash required 


to repay its long term financial liabilities, let alone bail out the public company.   





Fullshare is so overvalued that even if we ignore any evidence of corruption, we would expect a 76% downside in 


Fullshare’s stock price.  Investors do not typically give credit for non-recurring, one-time gains, especially if they 


occur outside of the core business.  If we adjust Fullshare’s income statement to remove such gains, we calculate that 


the Company’s earnings from its continuing operations was only RMB 303 million in FY 2016.  Meaning that 


Fullshare currently trades at a ludicrous 160.4x trailing TTM earnings from continuing operations!

As a basis of comparison, Fullshare is included in the Hang Seng Composite Properties and Construction Index 


(“HSCIPC”) along with 105 other HK listed companies.  The median Hong Kong company in the HSCIPC trades at 


a multiple of 11.8x price to trailing twelve months earnings from continuing operations.   





If Fullshare simply traded at the same multiple for TTM earnings from continuing operations as the median company 


in the HSCIPC, it would imply a share price of HKD 0.21 per share.   





Nor does the inclusion of any recent acquisitions make Fullshare’s valuation any more appropriate.  Fullshare acquired 


74% of Hong Kong listed CHS in December 2016, meaning that going forward, CHS and its subsidiaries will be fully 


consolidated into Fullshare’s financial statements.  If we give full credit to Fullshare’s 74% investment in CHS, at 


CHS’s current market capitalization, it adds only HKD 0.47 per share to Fullshare’s value.18   





Accordingly, even including the value of CHS, if Fullshare traded at the median multiple of earnings for other HSCIPC 


companies, Fullshare’s stock would be worth only HKD 0.68 per share, implying an 76% downside in the Company’s 


stock.19

*2016 Average Exchange Rate: RMB 1 = HK$ 1.17 





Measured on a price to book ratio, Fullshare’s shares appear similarly overvalued.  The median company in the 


HSCIPC trades at a multiple of 0.78x its book value.  Fullshare appears to trade at 1.86x its book value, but this is 


deceiving.  Zall is a struggling shopping mall developer which admits that it is not in compliance with its covenants.  


We believe that Zall’s shares have risen so high because of manipulation and are thus ludicrously overvalued.  


Therefore, in calculating Fullshare’s book value, we believe it is appropriate to remove the Zall shares from its balance 


sheet.   





We therefore calculate that Fullshare trades at an absurd 2.31x its adjusted book value.  If it simply traded at the 


HSCIPC median, Fullshare would be valued at HKD 0.97 per share, a 66 % downside from its current price.   





                                                           
18 We express no opinion regarding the valuation of CHS.   
19 Glaucus calculations are based on the price of Fullshare’s stock at the close of trading on Friday April 21, 2017, of HKD 2.88 


per share.

But of course, we think that Fullshare should trade far below an index median, given the evidence presented in this 


report of ubiquitous undisclosed related party dealings and the unusual intraday trading pattern of its stock.  Applying 


a 20% corruption discount yields a Glaucus valuation of HKD 0.55 per share (on an adjusted P/E multiple) or HKD 


0.77 (on an adjusted P/B multiple). 





    
Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 


Note: Both valuation methodologies give full credit to Fullshare’s interest in CHS. 





Ultimately, in this report, we have presented evidence that the Company’s stock is manipulated and that its chairman 


and his family have engaged in a number of undisclosed related party transactions to loot the Company’s best 


businesses.  Such behavior by Fullshare’s inner circle is so reprehensible and untrustworthy that we believe that the 


Company is simply uninvestible.
