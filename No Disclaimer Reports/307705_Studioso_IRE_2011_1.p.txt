Bank	of	Ireland	ADRs	Ridiculously	Overpriced	vs.	London	Listed
Shares
Jul.	28,	2011	4:16	PM	ET64	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


Bank	of	Ireland’s	NYSE-listed	ADRs	(NYSE:IRE)	have	been	trading	at	a	significant
premium	to	the	bank’s	London/Ireland	listed	shares	(symbol	BKIR.L)	since	late	2010.
There	does	not	seem	to	be	any	legitimate	reason	why	IRE	is	trading	at	a	much	higher
price	than	BKIR.L.	This	article	will	show	that	in	order	for	IRE	shares	to	move	to	parity
with	BKIR.L,	the	stock	should	fall	by	about	$0.90	or	58%.


In	other	words,	investors	are	paying	$0.90	more	for	IRE	than	they	would	pay	for	the
equivalent	stock	in	London.


Share	price	calculation	–	background	information


BKIR	shares	are	denominated	in	Euro	and	not	British	Pounds.
IRE	ADRs	are	denominated	in	US	Dollars.


The	ratio	of	ADRs	to	London	listed	shares	is	1:4.


Share	price	calculation	as	at	11.30am	New	York	time	on	Thursday	28	July	2011


BKIR	(ask)	in	EUR 0.110


EUR/USD	exchange	rate 1.4311


IRE	(bid)	in	USD 1.53


To	convert	BKIR	to	a	theoretical	IRE	equivalent:


0.110	EUR	*	4	(number	of	London	shares	for	each	ADR)	=	0.440	EUR


0.440	EUR	*	1.4311	=	$0.6297


Therefore	the	theoretical	IRE	share	price	is	about	$0.63


But	at	that	time,	the	prevailing	IRE	bid	in	New	York	was	$1.53.

Price	difference	between	the	two	securities:


$1.53	–	$0.63	=	$0.90


0.90	/	1.53	=	58.84%	decline	required	for	IRE	to	reach	parity	with	London	listed	shares	of
BKIR.L.


0.90	/	0.63	=	1.4298	
IRE	is	overvalued	by	142.98%	when	compared	to	BKIR.L.


How	long	has	this	overvaluation	been	in	place,	and	why?


The	BNY	Mellon	web	page	for	IRE	ADRs	states	“Bank	of	Ireland	Group	–	Books	Closed
for	Issuance”	on	3	December	2010.	This	means	that	it	was	no	longer	possible	to	submit
BKIR.L	shares	and	request	IRE	ADRs	in	exchange.


According	to	our	calculations,	the	difference	between	the	prices	of	BKIR.L	and	IRE	was
less	than	1%	on	3	December.	Following	this,	when	conversations	(from	BKIR.L	to	IRE)
were	no	longer	possible,	the	premium	widened	quickly,	and	reached	50%	on	20
December	2010.


The	following	table	shows	the	wild	and	unexplained	fluctuations	in	the	IRE	share	price
when	compared	to	the	BKIR.L	equivalent:

Fundamentals	of	IRE	and	downside	price	target	–	no	higher	than	$0.78


Bank	of	Ireland	recently	underwent	a	recapitalization	by	raising	billions	of	EUR	of
additional	capital.	It	sold	additional	common	stock	at	0.10	EUR	per	share,	and	completed
a	debt	for	equity	exchange,	with	the	conversion	of	debt	priced	at	0.1156	EUR	per	share.


In	the	week	ended	1	July	2011,	when	many	global	stock	markets	rallied	by	over	5%,
BKIR.L	barely	budged,	and	did	not	go	higher	than	0.126	EUR.


It’s	unlikely	that	the	BKIR.L	price	(which	should	influence	the	underlying	value	of	IRE)	will
rise	beyond	0.13	EUR,	due	to	the	‘anchoring’	of	the	share	price	to	the	rights	issue	price
and	the	debt	for	equity	exchange	price.


Furthermore,	due	to	the	ongoing	problems	in	Greece,	Ireland,	Portugal,	Spain	and	Italy	it’s
hard	to	see	the	EUR/USD	going	above	1.50.


Using	a	maximum	price	of	0.13	EUR	for	BKIR.L	and	maximum	price	of	1.50	for
EUR/USD,	the	maximum	fair	value	for	IRE	can	be	calculated	as:


0.13	EUR	*	4	*	1.50	=	$0.78.


However	it	should	fall	lower	than	$0.78	if	the	EUR/USD	stays	below	1.50	and/or	BKIR
stays	below	0.13	EUR.


What	are	buyers	of	IRE	thinking?


It’s	fair	to	assume	that	if	it	was	possible	to	convert	BKIR.L	shares	to	IRE,	then	this
premium	would	quickly	disappear,	as	investors	wanting	to	buy	IRE	cheaply	could	just	buy
BKIR.L	and	then	ask	BNY	Mellon	to	convert	these	to	IRE	ADRs.


In	any	case,	one	wonders	what	the	buyers	of	IRE	at	$0.90	and	above	have	been	thinking
in	the	last	seven	months	–	they	could	have	purchased	the	shares	at	a	much	lower	price	in
London.	Using	the	prices	at	11.30am	(New	York	time)	on	Thursday	28	July,	IRE	was

trading	at	$1.53,	compared	to	the	London	equivalent	of	0.110	EUR	*	4	*	1.4311	=	$0.6297.
This	represents	a	premium	of	$0.90	for	no	apparent	reason.


Does	the	same	price	discrepancy	also	apply	to	AIB?


Until	recently,	the	price	of	Allied	Irish	Bank	(AIB)	shares	in	New	York	closely	followed	the
price	of	AIB.IR	shares	in	Ireland.	However	today	(Thursday	28	July)	AIB.IR	shares
declined	by	14%,	and	the	New	York	listed	ADR	(AIB)	rose	by	2%.	Thus	it	appears	that	AIB
is	starting	to	trade	at	a	premium	to	AIB.IR	in	a	similar	manner.	In	a	future	article	we	will
analyze	the	price	discrepancy	of	AIB.IR	shares	compared	to	AIB	shares.
