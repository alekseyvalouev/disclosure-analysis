Summary


Short Ideas Consumer


STS reported a massive, unexpected Q3 backlog decline of 22% yoy. We believe
this signals an earnings peak for the company.


The glut in used trucks appears to be finally having an impact on their business.
The used truck market may remain oversupplied for up to four years.


Margins are also nearing peak post a restructuring and margin improvements will
be more difficult going forward.


We now anticipate Q4 revenue and earnings to decline on a yoy basis. 2017
earnings look to be flattish at best.


STS is trading over 8x peak EBITDA vs a historical average of 6.65x. We expected
approximately 40% downside to shares before this morning's slide. 20% or more
downside remains.


We are pleased to announce a "flash alert" short thesis on Supreme Industries, Inc.
(NYSEMKT:NYSEMKT:STS). Before this morning's move, STS was overvalued by
approximately 40% and still remains approximately 20% overvalued.

We have been working on this report for some time now and had considered releasing it
on Monday of this week but decided against doing so in front of Thursday's earnings
release. We were anticipating a strong third quarter and that's just what Supreme
Industries has delivered. We also expected a somewhat soft Q3 backlog. The
magnitude of the Q3 backlog weakness caught us off guard though. Backlog of $58.1mil
was down 22% year-over-year (yoy) and substantially weaker than we anticipated.


Initially we felt STS was a short based upon valuation, heavy insider selling, and near
peak margins & earnings in the midst of what amounts to the middle of a recession in
the rest of the trucking industry. Our call was that while STS had escaped the decline
that the rest of the trucking industry is currently undergoing, at some point in the not-to-
distant future it would also catch up to STS. Today appears to be that day. Initially we
felt STS could continue growing, albeit at a far slower rate, in 2017. Based on the new
backlog data and management's comments we now believe Q4 earnings will be down
yoy. We also believe 2017 earnings will likely be flattish vs. 2016 and possibly
down. STS was expensive before. Now it looks like valuation is off the charts.


The stock has been up close to 170% this year and volume has been much higher than
in previous years. A stock that historically traded less than 10k shares a day less than a
year ago is regularly trading 3, 4, 500k shares per day in 2016. One day in June of this
year it traded over 1.3mil shares. We believe that there are a couple of factors that have
pushed STS into nosebleed territory outside of improved earnings. It appears that
investors have discovered STS after many years in obscurity. In an economic
environment with anemic growth, STS has stood out as company with high growth in the
right place at the right time.


The vast majority of the trucking industry is seeing very difficult times that started in mid
2015. Most of the slowdown has impacted the Class 8 heavy-duty tractor market. STS
isn't in the Class 8 market. They make truck bodies for light and medium-duty trucks, or
the Class 2-7 market. Body types include cutaway van bodies, Spartan service bodies,
cargo van bodies, refrigerated (reefer) insulated bodies, stake bodies and box truck
bodies. On the truck bodies they often install liftgates, cargo-handling equipment,
customized doors, bumpers, ladder racks and other equipment. They also make
specialty vehicles including armored vehicles. Major customers include Ryder
(NYSE:R), Penske and Budget.

This portion of the industry has been far stronger than Class 8, driven by increasing
leasing trends and local delivery. Additionally STS has benefited from expanding
margins post a restructuring and low return asset disposal that wrapped-up in early
2014. Since then margins and earnings have been on the rise and had really caught fire
in just the past couple of quarters. STS also has been growing its sales force. This has
led to further improvements in revenue as sales reps have been ramping over the past
couple of years. This year STS is set to post all-time record earnings near $1.18 per
share vs. $.76c in 2015.


Our guess is that transportation investors have recently been hiding out in STS. On the
surface it made sense, especially if you got in back in February. While the rest of the
transports are suffering with little or negative growth, STS has seen explosive earnings
growth over the past year approaching 100% in the past couple quarters in a seemingly
insulated category. There aren't many other pure play ways to invest in the medium-duty
truck market either. On top of that they pay a small regular dividend and special
dividends on occasion so it's a draw for the dividend investor as well. Of course, most
dividend plays are extremely overvalued at this point and we'd also throw STS into that
category.
All of these factors appear to have combined to make STS a momentum investors
dream: a small-cap company with strong revenue growth, improving margins, explosive
earnings growth and a dividend to boot. Couldn't get any better than that, right? That's
exactly the problem. STS is now priced for perfection on peak earnings. It's as if
suddenly everyone forgot that this is an industrial cyclical company. STS is not a
recurring revenue company, they're not a high margin software company and they are
not even a consistently growing restaurant. STS is a highly cyclical industrial company
with highly cyclical earnings. When it comes to cyclicals, a good rule-of-thumb is that
once everything looks like it is going perfectly and the future couldn't look any brighter,
that's when you sell. Based on Q3 backlog, it looks like the party's over for STS. Look
out below.


Heavy Insider Sales:


You know who didn't forget this an industrial cyclical company? Insiders. Our interest in
STS began when we noticed insider selling had become particularly heavy in 2016. It's
often said that when an insider buys it's safe to assume they think the stock is cheap but
when they sell you can't really know why. It could be that they are selling for tax
purposes, diversification or due to personal needs that are unrelated to the stock price.
From a surface level that's a fair argument, but if you take a closer look often you can
glean more meaningful information.


Having thoroughly reviewed insider sales at STS we're of the opinion that they are
selling because they believe the stock is overvalued. Out of the 12 members on the
board, 10 have sold shares this year. Of the remaining two that did not sell, one joined
the board this year and only has 204 shares. Specifically in 2016 insiders have been
heavy sellers of STS in comparison to other years. To date they have sold over 800k
shares this year compared to current holdings of 2.9mil shares by board members and
executive insiders. That equates to 23% of their holdings since the beginning of the
year.
It's also important who sold and what their relationship is to the company. The CEO,
CFO and VP of Operations have all sold stock this year. The two largest insider
shareholders of STS by far include Chairman Herbert M. Gardner and Executive VP and
Secretary William J. Barrett. After selling about 205k shares this year Gardner holds
near 909k shares. Barrett has sold over 360k shares in 2016 and currently holds over
1.6mil shares.


Herbert M. Gardner and William J. Barrett have a very long history with STS. In fact,
they brought the company public in 1984. At the time both of them were investment
bankers at Janney Montgomery Scott in New York. They were looking to make an
acquisition with a fully funded shell company when they met Supremes' founder, Omer
Kropf. Kropf was a hard working high-school dropout that started Supreme in 1974 and
had built the business to $28mil. They bought him out, brought the company public via
the shell and started putting the cash to work expanding the business.


Mr. Gardner and Mr. Barrett have been on the board from the very beginning. Mr.
Gardner has been Chairman throughout the company's history. They both have
extensive, intimate knowledge of the company and the cyclical nature of the business.
We believe the sudden increase in stock sales this year says a lot about their current
opinion of STS valuation and it's not good if you happen to be long.

In addition to insider sales, the top two largest institutional shareholders have also been
selling stock as can be seen in the chart above. Fidelity started the year as a 6.5%
holder and has since sold their entire position according to their latest 13F filing. The
sales by Fidelity add to the selling trend but we believe the sales by Wilen Investment
Management are even more telling. Wilen is a hedge fund with approximately $200mil in
AUM run by James R. Wilen. James is a regular contributor to the Q&A portion of STS
earnings calls. Recently, Mr. Wilen's fund has increased their selling of STS stock. Mr.
Wilen's fund is invested fairly heavily in cyclical industrial corporations and he is on the
board of Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. (NASDAQ:MNRO). We feel his selling in conjunction
with the other sales outlined above is a strong warning sign that should be heeded.

This Chart Says It All:


If you are an analyst or PM who is advocating ownership of STS stock at these levels
we dare you to bring the following chart to your boss and/or investors and explain why
you would own STS here. The chart below going back to April 1981 clearly shows a
defined pattern of peaks long before an economic cycle enters a recessionary period. It
also very clearly shows that STS should be bought during a recession, not mid-to-late
cycle.

STS always peaks long before a recession can be sniffed out.


We are not in a recession. The economy quite clearly is currently in a mid-cycle period
with GDP growth expected to slow going forward according to the Fed. Employment is
reaching what is generally considered peak levels and interest rates are expected to be
raised going forward despite sluggish growth. Truck sales have slowed and medium-
duty truck sales are expected to continue slowing in 2017. STS has already appreciated
to its highest level on record by a large margin based on improved earnings post
restructuring and disposing of low return assets. Margins are currently at all-time highs.
Backlog has peaked and is now in significant decline, down 22% in Q3. The stock is
fully reflecting recent sales and margin improvements in our opinion and future gains on
both will likely be far more difficult for management to achieve.

http://fleetowner.com/equipment/ftr-mixed-forecast-truck-and-trailer-production
We believe earnings have peaked for this cycle based on the recent drop in backlog and
management comments. In the just reported Q3, management stated that "industry-wide
growth in commercial truck sales decelerated during the summer months, suggesting
moderate order activity through year end." We would add that we expect moderate
activity to continue into 2017 and perhaps beyond based on our research.


We recently reported that Covenant Transport (NASDAQ:CVTI) management stated on
their Q3 call that "nobody is buying new trucks now." There is a glut of used Class 8
trucks in the marketplace and although STS isn't in the Class 8 market, we believe the
slowdown in the Class 8 market is finally spilling over into the fairly robust light-duty and
medium-duty market that STS services. As used truck values decline, there is less
incentive to buy new trucks and this directly impacts STS. CVTI noted that things have
really deteriorated in the used truck market in the past 5 months.


Here we provide an excellent article by National Lease, one of the largest truck leasing
organizations in North America, describing the current oversupply in the used truck
market. In the article they clearly state that the slowdown that started in Class 8 has now
moved to the light and medium-duty market where STS competes. Ominously, the
article concludes by stating that their assumptions are based on "stability in the
economy and freight volumes. If the freight volume or the general economy falters, then
used truck prices would be in a position to free-fall." This would not bode well for new
truck sales in any category. It also aligns with STS's comments that sales began slowing
this summer.


The used truck glut is bringing down used truck valuations and trucking companies will
likely be taking down salvage values like CVTI just did this month. The result is higher
depreciation expense that is killing trucking operator earnings. CVTI said they believe
that as the market wakes up to the level of depreciation they will have to take on their
existing fleet, they will stop buying trucks. CVTI also said they expect smaller operators
to go into bankruptcy and this will exacerbate the used truck market oversupply issue.
So a used truck market that was supposed to be reaching equilibrium by year-end could
now be oversupplied for the next 3-4 years as small operators liquidate, according to
CVTI. We believe many of the smaller operators may also be owners of medium-duty
trucks and this is one way that we may see the spillover effect from Class 8 weakness
into the medium and light-duty market.

This sets up for the very worst time to invest in an industrial cyclical like STS. The old
saying that investors should buy when "there's blood in the streets" applies doubly for
small-cap cyclical stocks. The chart above clearly shows the absolute best time to buy is
when economic conditions and earnings are at their worst. The worst time to buy is mid
economic cycle where we are now. Unfortunately for many investors there is huge
temptation to invest in small-cap industrial cyclical companies at exactly the wrong time
and it appears that is what is happening right now.


During an economic downturn, cyclical earnings tend to fall and often small-cap
companies like STS will lose money. As the stock gets slaughtered heading into
recession, it looks extremely expensive as earnings continually move lower and
eventually negative. In periods of recovery when earnings are at their peak, the stock
looks cheap with a low PE relative to (historic) growth.


That's exactly how STS looks right now. 75% of the year is in the bag with $.99c in EPS
vs. $.76c total for 2015. STS is up 170% year-to-date and appears to fully reflect the
improvement. Analysts expect $1.18 for full-year 2016 EPS, which matches our
estimate and equates to 55% yoy earnings growth. Based on this estimate STS is
currently sporting about a 15x PE multiple and about a .28 PE/G ratio. It appears highly
unlikely that the PE/G will improve next year.


The 2017 EPS estimate is $1.32, which equates to 12% earnings growth over the 2016
estimate. We now believe the street estimate will have to come in, perhaps even below
2016. As we stated earlier, our 2017 estimate assumes about flat earnings growth vs.
2016. STS is trading about 13-14x the current 2017 street estimate for a 1.1 PE/G ratio.
Even if STS beats this year and comes in closer to say $1.28, that will only set-up a
harder comp for STS to overcome in 2017. 2017 was already expected to be a softer
year for medium-duty trucks; the outlook has only deteriorated since.


For STS margin improvements will be harder to come by post the 2011-2013
restructuring and disposal of the shuttle bus business. Simply put, peak earnings results
are fully reflected in the stock price. History is telling us all we need to know on STS.
Insiders and institutional holders with long relationships and extensive knowledge of the
company are selling heavily. The alarm bells are sounding. Are you listening?


Backlog Falls Off A Cliff:



http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STS/analysts?p=STS

http://fleetowner.com/equipment/ftr-mixed-forecast-truck-and-trailer-production
Trucking in general has been weak in 2016 stemming from a decline in long-haul freight
that we described earlier. This has mainly impacted Class 8 demand while class 2-7 had
been holding up far better overall. Class 8 truck orders dropped 28% in September with
orders down an average of 40% through the first nine months of 2016 according to ACT
Research.


Currently backlog is indicating the slowdown in light and medium-duty is well underway
for STS. Q2 backlog was only up 2% yoy and Q3 backlog is now down 22% yoy and
23% sequentially. This doesn't seem to fit with a stock up nearly 170% year-to-date.

To get another perspective on how bad the $58.1mil in backlog for the third quarter
really was, we compared revenue to backlog from the prior quarter going back to 2010.
Since 2010 revenue has only been higher than the previous quarter's backlog in two
quarters: Q2 and Q3 2014. In those quarters revenue was only 2% and 5% higher than
backlog from the prior quarter. We are now currently estimating revenue of $65mil for
Q4 as can be seen to the far right of the chart below. If STS reaches $65mil in revenue
for the 4th quarter they will be 12% above the Q3 backlog. This has never been done
as far as we are aware.


Based on our $65mil revenue estimate for Q4, we are currently modeling an earnings
DECLINE for Q4 on a yoy basis. For Q4 our current estimate is $.19c per share in
continuing operating income vs. $.22c per share last year. We also note that to reach
$.19c we are modeling for a gross margin improvement in Q4 to 22% vs. 21.7% yoy
despite a revenue estimate that is $2.7mil lower than last year's Q4. It would appear
there is downside risk to our revenue and earnings estimates.

Margins Near Peak:


Last quarter's gross margin of 24.1% was an all-time high for STS. At least we believe it
was an all-time high as the SEC filings and our model only go back to 1993. At any rate,
it's clear their Q2 margin was outstanding. In the company's Q2 quarterly call they said
margins were driven by higher retail sales and less fleet sales. In fact, the CFO
appeared to slip when he said that fleet was actually down yoy.


This particular quarter had to do with, what you might call favorable mix, we had
lower year-over-year fleet business, not that we wanted to be lower, but it has
lower gross margins and higher retail business year-over-year.


~Matthew Long, CFO


He then went on to state that, "the low hanging fruit I think has been done and you see
that as we've improved the margins again, straight for the last six quarters." With
margins at all-time highs post the restructuring and sale of low return assets we believe
margin improvements are near, if not at, peak levels. Certainly margin improvements
moving forward will be more difficult to achieve according to their own comments.
Guidance on gross margins long-term has been to reach 20% sustainably. They appear
to have reached this target but for the past few quarters when asked have been
reluctant to raise this bar. We anticipated a margin contraction in Q3 and they did, to
23% on seasonally lower revenue. Q4 Margins will also likely contract compared to Q2
due to seasonality. STS won't get the same operating leverage on fixed costs as they
did in Q2.


Regarding Q2 margins…


We had some serious leverage on our fixed cost with the increased volume as you
look at the backlog, the backlog is going to settle more towards the way it looked Q3
last year. So I wouldn't expect the same level of leverage on the fixed costs.


~Matthew Long, CFO

STS Stock Disconnects from Housing Data:


STS often references economic indicators to provide an idea for the current state of
business. Management believes certain indicators like housing are important drivers of
the business. This is one of their favorite indicators and they reference it often in
earnings calls. Historically housing has shown some correlation to the company's stock
price as we can see in the chart below. Recently there has been a huge disconnect
between STS and the housing data.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/10/21/47406777-14770442117806535_origin.png
This disconnect has been driven by strong margins post the restructuring and improving
sales which have driven strong earnings for STS. Now with the 22% decline in backlog it
appears STS earnings will see a reversion to the mean. Housing construction growth
has been somewhat flat this year while STS stock has taken off, up 170% ytd. The
anticipation of a fed rate raise is putting upward pressure on mortgage rates and by
extension housing. Mortgage applications were recently down 6% on higher rates.
Increased rates may also pressure truck leasing at the margin and that's also been a big
driver of sales for STS.

Currently STS is hitting on all cylinders with improving sales, margins and earnings. The
stock has greatly appreciated as a result and that's great news if you bought the stock at
$6. We caution investors looking to buy the stock here because historically when buying
cyclicals the worst time to buy them is when things couldn't look any better. When a
cyclical is hitting on all cylinders and the stock is at all time highs it is often the case that
we're nearing a top. This is usually only realized in retrospect at some time, perhaps a
year or two into the future. Such is the nature of cyclical stocks. They are extremely
counterintuitive. When things couldn't look any worse that's when you buy them. When
things look perfect that's when you sell.


Valuation:


(Note: The following valuation was based on Thursday's price in the $17.50-$18 range.
Despite the pullback, STS remains approximately 20% overvalued by our estimates.)


Valuation should never be justified based on a peak earnings cycle, especially for
industrial cyclical companies. It's important to value them based on average earnings
that include trough earnings based on recessionary periods. To simply value STS on
what could be peak earnings is to commit a fatal flaw in valuing the company because
the good times never last for industrial cyclicals. When the economy finally turns down,
they get burned. Considering this we went back through the financials and found that
the average annual per share continuing income from operations for STS is $.42c. The
average historical P/E is 12.9x earnings. Even assuming that going forward with
improved margins the average EPS from continuing operations is two-times the
historical average of $.42c, or $.84c, the stock is currently trading nearly 21x
average historical earnings with a declining backlog signaling a sales and earnings
peak. If we give a 12.9x P/E multiple based on two-times the historical average
operating income per share of $.42c we get a stock price of $10.84 per share for
downside of approximately 38-40%.


We also valued the company based on historical EV/EBITDA ratios. Historically the
average EBITDA has been about $12.7mil and the average EV/EBITDA has been 6.65.
Again we generously assume that going forward average EBITDA is two-times the
historical average. We arrive at a valuation of $11.17 per share representing
approximately 36-38% downside to current valuation.

Again we stress that this downside assumes that going forward the average income is
two-times the historical average. We believe this assumption is extremely generous.
The average income does take into account improved earnings post the 2011-2013
restructuring so if anything, by doubling the historical figures we are likely
overestimating average future income. We doubled the average to give current
management credit for margin improvements in recent years. By doubling the average
historical income, we are valuing the company based on what would be the 2nd highest
income in the company's history, outside of our 2016 estimate.


We believe current investors are forgetting that STS is an industrial cyclical company
and should be valued as such. At the end of the day this is a maker of truck bodies and
this type of business will never be exempt from business cycles and recessionary
impacts. We now believe based on Q3 backlog results that 2017 earnings will likely be
flat to declining from the 2016 level. Current valuation is not taking this fact into
consideration. We believe that post Q3 results the stock will reset to realistic valuation
near our $11.00 target. In our opinion this is an optimistic valuation.
