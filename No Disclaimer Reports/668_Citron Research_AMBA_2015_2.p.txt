Why Ambarella Will Trade Right Back to $90  
– on its Way Much Lower –  


In the Company’s Own Words 
 


Citron Explains “Ridiculousness” — Read and heed Ambarella's 
disclosures 
 


One month ago, when Ambarella’s stock hit $125, Citron Research 
published a thoughtful note about the overdone run-up in Ambarella stock, 
pointing out how investor enthusiasm had become detached from reality.  
As the stock sold off to levels, which were still inflated, but less ridiculous, a 
circus of pundits, and especially Jim Cramer, started to pound the table. 
 
The only reason why Cramer is relevant to this discussion is because his 
opinions influence a legion of retail investors.  Ambarella has LESS 
institutional ownership than any other major semiconductor stock in the 
marketplace.  This alone should cause any investor to pause with concern. 
 


Company Institutional Ownership 


AMBA 50.15% 
BRCM 87.38% 


NVDA 87.28% 


QCOM 81.43% 


INTC 65.25% 


MRVL 73.46% 


CRUS 78.60% 


XLNX 92.70% 


MLNX 67.87% 


AVGO 93.71% 


NXPI 90.92%

The irony of Cramer’s influence is that last month he agreed the stock was 
overheated at $125 but 20 days later he is telling people to “buy” at the 
same price … when there’s been no change to its fundamental story.   
 


Mellanox déjà vu’?  
 
 


Three years ago we saw a hot young company named Mellanox 
(NASDAQ:MLNX) Technologies, which was a “fabless semiconductor 
company that was growing revenues and profitability while maintaining 
margins” (sound familiar yet?)   Below is a chart of Mellanox compared to 
Ambarella for the 2+ years of their respective parabolic run-ups.  
 





Mellanox had a higher quality and more compelling blue-sky story than 
Ambarella.  It provides semiconductor solutions to the big data industry, its 
clients including Intel, HP, Oracle, and IBM.

In August of 2012 Cramer gave us this 6 minute rant on why he was 
“obsessed” with Mellanox.  This was supposed to be a company with the 
best technology, no completion, and outsized margins.

Look at the chart for the 5 months following this clip. 
 





To be fair, Cramer reversed his opinion of Mellanox the very next month, 
when their CFO resigned. This judgment no doubt saved his followers much 
money.  Its 3 years later, and the stock is now in the 40’s.  It has never 
recovered and held a price over 50.

Our point is not about whether this trade 3 years ago made or lost money.  
It is about how chasing “growth” in a hot semiconductor stock with small 
revenues – very similar to Ambarella – can result in a massive valuation 
overshoot, because the growth can’t scale into large numbers.   
 
Not surprisingly, the same analysts at Deutsche Bank and Stifel who had 
$150 price targets on Mellanox are the same ones with the $115 price 
targets on Ambarella.  What is most astounding is that even if the 
incompetence of Wall Street analysts is disregarded, Ambarella’s stock is 
overvalued by the measure of even their inflated targets (AMBA carries an 
average Wall Street target of $110.) 
 
Also note that AMBA’s valuation is way higher than MLNX at its peak.

And yes, big data is a lot more compelling a story than consumer quad-
copters. 
 


Citron understands that Cramer has one of the more difficult jobs on 
television.  He and his team are required to know at least a little bit about a 
huge spectrum of stocks. But when entertainment turns into 
misinformation, we have to speak up. 
 


The Big OOPS: Ambarella is Not an Investment in 
Drones  
 


Citron now points out the misperception about Ambarella and the hot 
“next big thing” story in the market -- drones.

“What really dazzled people on the call, once they started listening to it, is 
drones. People are underestimating drones. Ambarella is the brains 
behind drones.” 


-- Cramer 6/8/2015 , 7/22/2015

This is simply factually incorrect.  It would be as foolish as saying the 
camera is the brains that controls the iPhone.  
 
Ambarella chips handle video processing and compression.  They work  
with cameras, period. The real “brains” behind drones are companies like  
Intel, Qualcomm and NVIDIA, who are competing on drone CPU’s and 
GPU’s which process complex 3D geometry, image processing, power 
management and navigation solutions for the current and future 
generations of the drone market.   The quote below states the actual 
competitors in the technology. 


 
 
Here’s one story about a GPU technology that could legitimately be called 
“the brains behind drones”.  It is manufactured by NVIDIA. 


http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/29/nvidia-wants-to-power-the-drone-market.aspx 


 
In fact, both Intel and Qualcomm have integrated cores (RealSense and 
Snapdragon) that have image processing and video compression features 
onboard.  These technologies are being applied to drones.   


http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7519305/ces-2015-drones-intel-realsense-asctec-firefly 


 
Notice what company isn’t even part of the discussion in the above quote: 
Ambarella.  As a matter of interest -- Ambarella’s own CEO Wang would 
NEVER have the audacity to claim that Ambarella is “the brains behind 
drones”.  He would recognize the irresponsibility of that statement. 
 
To the extent Ambarella covers the price/feature/power curve for video 
processing, we don’t dispute that it will get its video chip into cameras on a 
good share of drones … along with its competitors barking at its heels just a 


"The good news from CES 2015 is that the semiconductor giants are 
throwing billions of dollars of research and [production] capacity at 
problems we, the drone industry, need solved.   So between Qualcomm’s 
work on real-time vision built into their Snapdragon program and Intel’s 
work on RealSense vision, which is a standalone chip, those things are 
now going to be driving next year’s drones, and they are going to be 
available at a cost and speed that we, the drone industry, could never 
have done on our own." 


--  Chris Anderson, the CEO of 3D-Robotics.

few months behind on the latest specs. But that caps its revenue at $15 to 
$25 per unit, period, and going lower. 
 
The future of drones as an investment thesis is utterly uncertain and 
untested.  If drones ever become investible, the main sectors of their use 
will be commercial/industrial and defense.  Ambarella’s chips, which focus 
on the “pro-sumer” marketplace, are by far the smallest sliver of this 
marketplace.  The company suggests drones might possibly become 10% of 
their revenues.  At its most optimistic, its not a game changer.  
 


OK CITRON ….What is AMBA really worth?  
…  And keep it simple. 
 


If you give AMBA the full benefit of its revenue growth, let’s concede the 
most optimistic 2017 revenue estimates of consensus $425 million.  The 
industry standard for semi companies is 2.5x revenue, but Citron will be 
overly generous and afford Ambarella 5x revenue.  That scenario gives 
AMBA a 2017 market cap of $2 billion … which pegs the stock at $66 -- still 
higher than the average insider sale price over the last 18 months.

This projection assumes that GoPro refrains from going to an AMBA 
competitor to second-source video chips (going against all industry norms), 
and the company’s revenues in not only the consumer drone market, but

also the security camera market and the action cam Pro/Sumer market all 
exceed targets.  And Moore’s law is cast to the curb too, as prices for video 
capture and compression components do not decrease in either price or 
margin.  
 


If You Don’t Believe Citron, Then Believe the 
Company….What does Ambarella have to say about 
Ambarella? 
 


Required Reading for Analysts and Shareholders  
 
As wrong as it is to regard Ambarella as a proxy for investing in the 
drone business, Wall Street estimates are not reflective of basic 
pricing and competitive dynamics in the industry.  The current price 
targets of $110 average all assume the company faces little 
competition and no margin compression…for multiple years.  
 
The statements below are all excerpted from Ambarella’s SEC filings: 
 








“Our solutions are typically characterized by a life cycle that 
begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes, 
followed by broader market adoption, higher volumes and 
average selling prices that are lower than initial levels. “ 
 


“Average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets 
we serve have historically decreased over time, and we expect 
such declines to continue to occur for our solutions over time. “
Citron Comments on Ambarella July 29, 2015 Page 8of 10 
 





 
 
And as for little commentary on competition (we heard that on Mellanox 
also) just read this from the same filing (most recent 10-Q): 
 


 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1280263/000119312514437415/d799192d10q.htm 





“We expect competition in our current markets to increase in 
the future as existing competitors improve or expand their 
product offerings and as potential new competitors, such as 
Broadcom Corporation, MediaTek, NVIDIA Corporation, 
Qualcomm Incorporated and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., , 
enter these markets. “ 
 


“As semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold to 
customers increase, their average selling prices typically decline. 
These declines may be paired with improvements in 
manufacturing yields and lower wafer, packaging and test costs, 
which offset some of the margin reduction that could result 
from lower selling prices. We believe that our gross margin will 
decline in the future as we continue to penetrate the highly 
competitive camera market and as we launch our solutions into 
new markets. “ 
 


“In the past, we have reduced the prices of our SoC solutions in 
anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product 
introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. We 
expect that we will have to do so again in the future. “

Insider Selling 
 


Lets us make one point perfectly clear.  We do not fault Ambarella 
management for any of the market movements of its stock.  The company 
has executed on their business plan very competently, and management 
has not misled investors on the prospects of the company.  Also, 
management has a full right to sell stock when they choose.  That being 
said, even management realizes the stock price has become ridiculous as 
reflected by the selling. 


   
 Insiders have sold more $ value of shares since 2014 than the 


company had in R&D the same year. ($63M vs $58M) 


 These sales have been made at a 65% discount to current pricing 
($41.72 average price) 


 The CEO/Co-founder/Chairman Wang Feng-Ming has sold $19M 
worth at $39/share 


The other co-founder, CTO Leslie has sold $23M at $42.00 average. 
2015 sales to date amount to $19.6M, at a $75.05 share price.

  Conclusion -- And All You Have To Know 
 


Ambarella has done a fine job in creating video solutions for the GoPro and 
first generation quad copters along with the not discussed security camera 
department.  Much like EVERY other chip company in the history of the 
semiconductor space, their unit prices will go lower as their competition 
increases.  That is not up for debate 1… the company has told us that.  It 
seems that Wall Street and its pundits do not want reality to mix with a 
good bull story -- and that is why Citron Research has been around for 15 
years.   
  
Assuming GoPro does not dual source their chip in the future and 
Ambarella is able to maintain margins in its less lucrative security division 


and the company is able to hit Wall Street revenues estimates for years 
and they can hold prices and margins despite the track record of every 
other semiconductor company in a hotly competitive space, the stock could 
trade at $40-$60 … anything above that is just more layers of 
ridiculousness.
