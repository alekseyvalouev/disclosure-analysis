New Lawsuit From Investor Highlights Imploding Odyssey Marine-
Related Private Company

Summary


New lawsuit from a large investor in Seagrass Recovery questions shell games:
related-party transactions used to allegedly siphon money into insiders’ pockets.


Seagrass is run out of same office as Neptune Minerals under the same CEO:
OMEX co-founder John Morris.


Josh Adam, SVP Finance at Neptune under CEO John Morris, raised $27.5mm for
OMEX via Oceanica / Mako Resources LLC (via unregistered private securities).


We believe OMEX is desperate to raise capital and will require a massive discount to
the current $2.06/share to close.


A recent article in the Columbus Dispatch, home of the original investors in the SS Central
America project who have yet to see a dime, compared buying shares in Odyssey Marine
(NASDAQ:OMEX) to buying a lottery ticket. We certainly share the sentiment that OMEX
should not be considered an investment where you expect to make money but at least
lotteries are FAIR. We think a more appropriate analogy might be buying a lottery ticket
where every previous winner has been a relative or friend of the lottery organizer.


New public court documents relating to a lawsuit in Pinellas County, Florida shed light on
the web of private non-arms-length companies OMEX has been using for years, in
addition to how the co-founder of OMEX treats his investors.


An investor who has been an employee and investor in Seagrass Recovery since 2007,
after numerous reasonable attempts to accommodate Seagrass, had not been paid what
he was owed and filed a notice of default July 15, 2013 on his $1,500,000 note.


On Jan 15, 2014, a Judge ORDERED that Seagrass make its books and records available
and to reimburse the investor's attorney's fees.


As of February 3, 2014, all of the officers and directors of Seagrass resigned, including
CEO John Morris and Michael Barton (husband of Laura Barton, a current OMEX officer),
leaving just Walter Copeland as sole director and CEO.

March 25, 2014 the Judge found Seagrass in contempt of court for failing to comply with
the order to deliver books and records and reimbursing the investors attorney fees.


Related party Transactions used to Siphon Money into Insiders' Pockets


In addition to the disturbingly confrontational tone and belligerence with which the OMEX
co-founder attacks his investors, the filed complaint also questions related party
transactions that appear to be used to siphon money out of the company and into insiders'
pockets. For example, Gulf Bargeco, LLC is managed by John Morris and his wife Eleanor
Morris and is a shell company with the same office as SRI to own barges that were
allegedly leased to Seagrass at 10X fair market rates.


Given this alleged conduct by OMEX's co-founder, we question whether OMEX is utilizing
other undisclosed related party transactions to siphon money out of the company - for
example, have relatives of CEO Greg Stemm (who was paid $1.3mm in 2013) been hired
as "consultants" while not actually performing legitimate services to the company?


The OMEX Web of Private Companies


In addition to John Morris being the co-Founder of OMEX, there is a current connection as
these structures have been used with OMEX for years that we have been documenting
since October 2013 at www.omextruth.com. We have included a diagram of all of the
entities in the OMEX web that we are aware of at the moment including Neptune Minerals
and Seagrass, both run out of 5858 Central Ave Suite A., St. Petersburg, Florida.

How Does OMEX Bridge the Looming Cash Shortfall?


With OMEX's private company "funnels" unwinding:


· Mako Resources (owner of Oceanica shares) has not exercised its options to inject more
capital in 2014
