TUTOR PERINI: STRUCTURAL ISSUES
UNDERESTIMATED BY THE MARKET


November 17, 2016  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 1 Comment  


Iceberg initiates coverage on Tutor Perini (TPC). The company’s issues are


not restricted to the “unbilled”. Tutor Perini has an impressive number of


structural problems that, we believe, are underestimated by the market.


Summary of findings:


Tutor Perini (“Tutor”) is a $1.5b market cap company, but it has


recorded only $3m in operating cash flow (“OCF”) since 2010. Tutor


has not paid dividends since 2010.


Although Tutor records positive OCF quarters periodically, due to the


fact that its revenue is amassed in lump sums and seasonal, its overall


ability to generate cash has been structurally weak. Based on its


average OCF since 2014, it would take 33 years to repay its existing net


debt of $622m.


Tutor’s stock surged by 47% after Trump’s election. The President-elect


pledged to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on infrastructure without


raising new taxes. The sketchy plan would translate into a 60%


increase in annual infrastructure spending. However, experts have


already expressed doubts over the feasibility of a plan that relies


entirely on private funding.

Tutor’s inability to generate cash has been partially explained by the


growth in its “unbilled”. We have compared the annual expectations


of unbilled realization and actual OCF. Based on this analysis, we have


strong doubts regarding the recoverability of these assets.


Although Tutor presents its unbilled as a straightforward collection


issue, in reality clients often counter-sue Tutor, for example for false


claims. We analyzed Tutor’s legal cases and found the situation


particularly concerning. Tutor faces substantial contingent liabilities.


In the past, Tutor had recognized insufficient provisions for these


liabilities, even though it was clear that Tutor’s legal position was very


weak, and indeed they lost the lawsuit.


Large retainage ($542m), higher than competitors, suggests future


collection issues.


We expect Tutor to continue to struggle to generate material OCF on a


sustainable basis.


We think the market is unaware of the fact that banks have been


actively reducing their exposure on Tutor. Tutor’s interest expenses


jumped by 32% in 9M 2016. Recently, the company had to withdraw a


$500m bond offering as the pricing was too high.


Governance is very weak, especially for a US company: directors on


the compensation committee have been “independent” for an average


of 14 years, shareholders’ votes on remuneration policy have been


systematically ignored, same auditor for the past 15 years, etc.


Almost half of the shares of Chairman and CEO, Ronald Tutor, who


controls 19.6% of shareholding, are pledged as collateral for a line of


credit.


Based on cash flow valuation, we expect the stock to fall by at least


55%. Our target price is $13.
