AMSC


This past week, Wall Street whooped up the higher top-line revenue number from
American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC), and rewarded it with an immediate 25%
gain, plumping its market cap to well over a billion dollars. All this for a company that
has done nothing but over-promise and under-deliver for years.


Citron seeks to answer a key question: Was this increase in revenue gained through
legitimate arms-length transactions, or was there another explanation - some
undisclosed related party transactions? You be the judge. If we look to the insiders for
guidance, they have already rendered their verdict, in the form of insider selling at a
furious pace. Read on and enjoy a true tale of Wall St.

A Little Background


2007: Into the Wind


While alternative energy stocks have become Wall
Street darlings, it is important to differentiate those
who are players in the space to those who play like
they are in the space. General Electric (GE) and
Siemens (SI) are legitimate industry players in wind
power and then you have AMSC, who through a
series of press releases and a funky acquisition
wants Wall Street to forget that their superconductor business has fallen off a cliff (down
30%) last year and to forget about the $400 million already pumped down the drain at
the end of that dream.


For those of you who are not familiar with American Superconductor, they have been
one of those perennial money losing “dream technology” companies who promise
everything and deliver nothing. Here are a few snippets from their 10-K’s of years gone
by.


2000-“We believe that our existing capital resources, including the proceeds of our
March offering, will be sufficient to fund our operations until we reach profitability
and have positive cash flow”


2002 “We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our
operations until the end of fiscal 2005, at which time we expect to reach corporate-
wide profitability”


2005 - “We expect to continue to incur operating losses until at least the end of
fiscal 2007”


2006- “We expect to continue to incur operating losses until at least the end of
fiscal 2009 and there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability.”


In fact, this company has delivered a string of unblemished losses stretching back 14
consecutive years – without ever turning a single profit. Not just marginal losses, either -
$400 million in total … and none of this developing wind power, rather Superconductors.

R&D AWOL


So who is Windtec?


Coming into 2007, American Superconductor needed a new story to boost their
stagnant stock price. In the first month of the year AMSC acquired Windtec in order to
enter the highly competitive wind power market. The cost of the acquisition was $0 cash
and $13 million in stock. It is 15 months later and the company is claiming that Windtec
has become the primary revenue engine for the entire company, with one of Windtec’s
customers accounting for 52% of AMSC’s $74 million total revenue, or about $37 million
for the 9 months ending Dec 31.


“Revenue growth in the nine months ended December 31, 2007 is being driven
largely by our acquisitions, particularly Windtec. AMSC Windtec’s largest customer is
Sinovel Wind, in China. For the nine months ended December 31, 2007, Sinovel
accounted for approximately 52% of our total revenues. If Sinovel cancelled
contracts, or discontinued future purchases from us, we might be unable to replace
the related revenues.”


Then they trumped that with a 4th quarter 8-K, announcing record $38.1m revenues,
and massive backlog growth to nearly $200m, a 167% increase since March 2007. The
concentration of orders from Sinovel is undisclosed, but among other things, we can’t
wait to see what they come up with for that data point in their upcoming 10-K.


It seems the acquisition of Windtec was so good that AMSC gets a free entry into the
wind systems business without even doing any R&D. AMSC’s R&D expense
companywide was a paltry $3.7 million last quarter companywide. This is down year
over year and most of that still goes into the money losing superconductor business.


Well, if Windtec can justify the majority of revenues for a billion dollar company they
must have been a real solid company pre-acquisition … NOT! Windtec had been a small
customer of AMSC since 2005. Admittedly, Windtec was an engineering design firm, not
a manufacturer of wind systems.


On the 8-K filed 3/27/2007, we get a glimpse into the real Windtec. Founded in 1995,
this is what the company looked like after 11 years in operation (all numbers in Euros)…
NOT thousands either.

Let the Games Begin


All figures in Euros 
Cash: 345,000 
Inventory: 196,000 
Machinery and Equipment: 1,100,000 
Accounts Receivables: 2,000,000 
Accounts Payable: 1,700,000 
Short Term Borrowings: 335,000 
12-month R&D: 1,500,000 
Amount due to AMSC: 292,000


So basically, AMSC took a customer who owed them almost 80% of all their cash
and saved them by acquisition…


In no time, Windtec became the darling of the company as multi-million dollar orders
came rolling in from China. Namely one customer – Sinovel. This one customer gave a
series of orders to Windtec in 2007 that totaled over $100 million. Not bad for Windtec, a
company who just months beforehand had only $196,000 in inventory.


As quoted above, Sinovel currently accounts for more than 50% of all AMSC revenues
and the majority of their backlog. What makes this even shadier is how this long-
standing customer could start giving Windtec these multimillion dollar orders only
months after Windtec was acquired for peanuts.


Sinovel has become so crucial to the existence of the company that they even disclose,


“If Sinovel cancelled contracts, or discontinued future purchases from us, we might be unable to
replace the related revenues. This would have a serious negative impact on our operating
results and financial position.”


It is the opinion of Citron that Sinovel is a related party and American
Superconductor has not disclosed the true nature of the relationship. This spells
big problems for AMSC.


Let us start here - at the Sinovel homepage: www.Sinovel.cn

Conclusion


Here we see the name of the company is not Sinovel Wind, but rather Sinovel Windtec.
Furthermore, we see numerous mentions online to a joint company called “Sinovel
Windtec”. The notion of an undisclosed relationship between the two companies is even
more compelling after we see that a company called Sinovel Windtec existed and was
marketing products in 2006 (pre-acquisition). [link]


This as yet defined relationship between Sinovel and Windtec not only exaggerates
gross margins for the company but more importantly it is the only way to explain how a
sleepy design engineering firm with the balance sheet of a pizza store can become
more than 50% of the revenues and the driving force behind a $1.3 billion company.


Companies making related party transactions have the burden of extra disclosure so
investors can make informed valuation decisions. The SEC is very clear about recording
revenue from related party transactions with Regulation SX and FASB statement #57.
Management must explain to shareholders the true nature of these relationships.


Why? Related party transactions can be loaded in all different ways, distorting their true
economic value and rendering them invalid in an apples-to-apples comparison with
arms-length transactions.


AMSC discloses relying on “percentage completion” accounting for “certain contracts”,
there are even more uncertainties regarding this one huge customer, its burgeoning
receivable, and the true nature of its business relationship to AMSC. Or have they
explained it through their insider selling?


From the date of the first Sinovel/Windtec (only a year ago) announcement to the
present, CEO Greg Yurek has sold over $8 million worth of stock. That figure dwarfs his
stake in the company – basically he immediately runs his options to market as soon as
they vest – next to the losses, it’s the most predictable transaction in AMSC’s filings.
The selling has come as recent as $140K worth of stock last week. This is the most
rampant selling we have seen by the CEO in his tenure.

You’d think Wall Street would have learned a lesson from the catastrophic valuation
destruction inflicted on investors in the bubble collapse of 2000 and 2001. Yet some of
the same perpetrators get resurrected and refinanced every time Wall Street has a new
story to sell. We now have a company who out of the clear blue is generating revenue
from another company who seems to have common ownership. Someone has a lot of
explaining to do!


Citron says don’t get burned.


Cautious investing to all.
