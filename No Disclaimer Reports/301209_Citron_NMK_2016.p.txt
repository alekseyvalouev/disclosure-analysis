Mallinckrodt CEO FRAUD exposed by the 
new Medicare Drug Dashboard 


 
Mallinckrodt Stock Target Price - $20 


 
Mallinckrodt CEO Mark Trudeau has been caught red handed committing securities 
fraud -- exposed by none other than the newly released Medicare drug-spending 
dashboard. 
 


This long-promised, just released public information database demonstrates that HP 


Acthar Gel is The Single Most Expensive Drug per Treatment as 
reimbursed by Medicare / Medicaid. 
 


Background 
 


October 2015 was the tipping point for pharmaceutical pricing scrutiny in the United 
States.  As Valeant collapsed following exposure of their orchestrating the "Phildor 
scheme", the media and Congress both went head-hunting for abusers of the healthcare 
reimbursement system. 
 


In response to public outcry and pressure to search for systemic reimbursement 
abusers, by December 2015 Medicare had launched an online drug spending dashboard.  
Results have just been just made public this week and it exposes the dirty secrets of 
Mallinckrodt.

Failure to Disclose 
On an October 5, 2015 conference call, while the shit was hitting the fan in the 
pharmaceutical business, CEO Mark Trudeau was asked about the company’s reliance 
on Medicare for revenues for Acthar:

As we now learn, the concentration for Acthar paid by Medicare has ballooned to 
61% as Trudeau lied to Wall Street.  
 


At the time, Trudeau must have calculated the investing public would never know the 
damning truth, but only two months later in response to public outrage, this 
information was on its way to being revealed to the public.    
 


For the year 2015, Medicare and Medicaid Spending is not merely "a little bit" higher 


than 25%.  In fact, it is over 61% of Acthar sales.

Question – Jason M. Gerberry:  
And then just as a quick follow-up, can you just remind us? What is your Acthar 
exposure to Medicare? Thanks. 
Answer – Mark C. Trudeau:  
So with regards to your question on Medicare exposure to Acthar, a couple of 
things. One, if we look at our overall business, the combined proportion of our 
business that goes through Medicare and Medicaid combined it's about a quarter 
of our business, roughly. Acthar is maybe a little bit higher than that.

Let's not forget that Acthar continues to represent a massively disproportionate chunk  
of Mallinckrodt's bottom line, a number that Trudeau always is happy to dance around, 
rather than disclose the true concentration risk it took on when it levered up massively 
to acquire this never-proven drug. 
 





This is securities fraud plain and simple.  Moreover it points to the elephant in the room:  
What else is Trudeau lying about?  
 


 Kickbacks to doctors? 


 Patient assistant programs? 


 Unreported clinical studies that failed to prove HP Acthar efficacy? 


 Free patient dinners at Olive Garden?  
 


The Insurance Companies Figured It Out  
 


It was just 2 years ago when pharmaceutical industry newsletter Fierce Pharma 
published a piece asking if "Medicare is Wasting $220 million a year on Acthar” 
http://www.fiercepharma.com/financials/medicare-wasting-220m-a-year-on-questcor-s-controversial-acthar 
 


Then, a 2014 Wall Street Journal piece foresaw the move from private pay to 
government coming.  It quoted Ed Pazella, the National Medical Director for Pharmacy 
Policy and Strategy at Aetna when he stated: 
 


 
http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/08/05/a-little-known-drug-from-questcor-generates-a-huge-medicare-bill/ 


“The combination of “aggressive marketing and aggressive price increases finally 
caused it to become a line item that a finance guy looked at and said:  
 


‘What the hell are we paying for this? Why? What is it?’ And that’s when we 
started looking at what’s our policy around this stuff.”

As insurance companies became aware of the scheme, Mallinckrodt has protected its 
revenue stream by pushing more and more of the bill onto Medicare/Medicaid. 
In the past two years the bill to CMS has increased from $346 million to $648 million 
because those private payers opened their eyes. 
 


Jonathan Blum, a former principal deputy director at the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) was quoted in the same article: 
 





The importance of the above LIE told by Trudeau is to cover up to the government and 
to Wall Street that insurance companies have made reimbursements for Acthar more 
difficult, not just because of price but because of an utter lack of evidence about its 
efficacy. 
 


IT GETS WORSE – Someone tell this to Paul Ryan. 
 


We now find out through this new Medicare dashboard. that HP Acthar Gel 
is the most expensive drug per use in all of Medicare despite the lack of 
any clinical data ... AMAZING! 
 








“The case (Acthar) underscores a need for Congress to reconsider the limited role 
that Medicare has in assessing and negotiating for drugs.  – And at the time they 
did not even know it would grow to be the most expensive drug in the system."

So Acthar is the most expensive drug per treatment in the Medicare system.  And just 
two months ago we read in Neurology Today Journal: 
 


 
http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2016/09220/Five_Steps_for_Cost_Cutting_in_MS_ Treatment.1.aspx  





Remarkably similar commentary from Lily Jung Henson, medical director of neurology at 
Swedish Medical Center's Ballard campus in Seattle, who stated, ironically that she 
thinks Medicare should push for more studies to determine if the product actually 
works in those patients.  
 


 
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/upshot/the-obscure-drug-with-a-growing-medicare-tab.html 


"I can't afford to waste their money by giving them a drug that I can't convince myself has 
been effective," she said. 
  
 


There is no evidence that ACTHar gel... is in any way superior to methylprednisolone for 
MS relapses — indirect comparisons suggest that it may be associated with more adverse 
events and its current Average Wholesale Price of $40,840.80 for a 5 ml/40 unit bottle 
makes routine use of this product for MS relapses difficult to justify,” they wrote. 
 


Dr. Bourdette said use of ACThar gel should cease.  
“That's something that can happen right now. Neurologists just shouldn't be using it 
because there's no evidence that it warrants that high price,” he said.

As the new GOP majority debates the future of the Medicare system, and if one wants 
to determine if the system is broken or not just think about this:  
 


Doctors do not even know if the most expensive drug 
reimbursed by Medicare, at $162,000 per patient, even works. 





Where is the outrage from Claire McCaskill?? 
 


Although Claire McCaskill has used her standing to go after Valeant and Mylan CEO's, 
she has put her head in the sand when it comes to Mallinckrodt, whose offices are a 
mere 3 miles from her office in St Louis, and contributed to her campaign.  
 


To put the Acthar - Medicare problem in perspective.  EpiPen cost Medicare $87.9 
million in 2014 compared to over $400 million for Acthar  ... and at least we know 
EpiPen works!  
   





      Conclusion 
 


Medicare/Medicaid is spending $640 million a year on a drug with no real clinical data 
 


President-Elect Trump has made it a promise to cut waste, fraud, and abuse from the 
government's healthcare reimbursement system. With Medicare's own data, Citron has 
now proven that Mallinckrodt is the embodiment of all three. 
 


When the GOP gets a grasp on the cold reality that 65% of all sales of Acthar sales go to 
the Federal Government, you will hear a war cry from President Elect Trump and the 
GOP, who have been looking to dismantle Medicare or regain the right to negotiate 
drug pricing. 
 


*LASTLY, Citron’s million-dollar challenge still stands.  We will contribute $1 million to 
a legitimate MS charity if Mallinckrodt agrees to fully and openly double-blind test HP 
ACTHAR GEL for efficacy compared to inexpensive synthetic ACTH, inexpensive 
corticosteroid therapies and of course placebo ... we are waiting. 
 


Cautious Investing to All
