Short OFIX. Ortho�x to plunge 50% on
undisclosed FDA issue and accounting
manipulation
(https://moxreports.com/ortho�x/)
 D EC EM B ER  1 6 ,  2 0 1 6  | R P


Summary


Bone Growth Stimulators (“BGS”) comprise the largest segment of revenue and
more than half of pro�ts, while also driving growth at Ortho�x.
Other segments are lower margin, commodity businesses and/or showing declines
and pricing pressure. BGS is absolutely the only reason to own Ortho�x.
October 2016: FDA is actively moving to “down classify” BGS from Class III to Class
II, allowing cheap competition to �ood in, stealing revenues and crushing margins.
Clear accounting manipulation by 26% demonstrated in recent quarters, Ortho�x is
currently grossly overvalued as a high growth player with a strong “moat”. (WRONG
!).
Following the FDA move, expect Ortho�x quickly to fall by at least 50% (share price
of around $15-17).

Overview


I have been heavily focused on FDA issues with healthcare stocks for almost 20 years. My past articles
highlighting problems with numerous healthcare stocks have quickly presaged share price declines well in
excess of 50%, sometimes within just days. A few of these articles are shown below. The key theme in all of

them is that most investors simply don’t do their research. (This includes institutions as well as individuals.)


Every once in a blue moon, I come across what I describe as a “unicorn short”. This is a short trade where
there is massive near term potential downside, but with very little upside potential. It is a truly “asymmetric
trade”. That is what we see with Ortho�x (NASDAQ:OFIX (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OFIX)).


As I will categorically demonstrate, an impending FDA action will send Ortho�x stock at least 50% lower in the
near future. The documentation below, along with new developments just in recent weeks, shows why I am
100% con�dent that this is going to happen. Just watch.


Ortho�x knows that this is coming and Ortho�x is scared. The company engaged a well known lobbying �rm,
and total payments for this e�ort now exceed $1 million. The recent lobbying e�ort appears to have failed. The
process is now getting to the late stages and has continued through several important milestones, even in
recent weeks. Yet Ortho�x has made no adequate disclosure to investors.


Against this downside, Ortho�x has virtually no visible upside potential from current levels. According to
management, Ortho�x already has a #1 market share in BGS (its main product) and the entire size of that
market is only $500 million. The market for BGS is rock stable and is only growing by 1-3% per year. For each
of these reasons, there is simply no chance of Ortho�x pulling in unexpected windfall gains in BGS. Ortho�x’s
other businesses are either low margin and / or are facing accelerating declines amid soaring competition. As
a result, I see no visible chance of an upside stock price surprise in being short Ortho�x. Likewise, for longs,
once the FDA thesis is understood, there is absolutely zero reason to continue owning the stock (not even in
the $20s).


For shorts, clear evidence of signi�cant and recent accounting manipulation, arti�cially boosting reported
numbers, is just icing on the cake. This means that the downside in the share price will come sooner rather
than later. Without that manipulation in Q3, Ortho�x would already be trading at well below $30 (even prior to
the FDA action).


What really makes this trade a “unicorn short” is that it has been totally undiscovered (until now). Neither
longs nor shorts appear to have caught on to just how soon or how far this stock is going to fall.


There are very few institutions with a meaningful presence in Ortho�x. The ones that were there in early 2016
have already been slowing liquidating during the year due to steadily worsening �nancial results across
Ortho�x’s other businesses.


At the beginning of 2016, Consonance Capital
(http://www.secinfo.com/d113mw.w4K5.d.htm#1stPage) and North Tide Capital
(http://www.secinfo.com/d12Pk6.w2k4j.d.htm#1stPage)were both 10% and 5% holders respectively. As of
September, Consonance had already cut its position size by 60% while North Tide had exited completely.
Blackrock and Vanguard (i.e. the “dumb money”) each own 7%.


(Incidentally, last year Consonance was also one of the largest shareholders
(http://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+SC+13G+OSIRIS+THERAPEUTICS,+Filed+by%3A+Conson
Osiris Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OSIR (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSIR)). Shortly after I publicly exposed
my fraud concerns (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stu�ing-accounting-
irregularities-outright-fraud) at Osiris, the company was forced to restate its �nancials, the CEO was forced to
resign and an SEC investigation ensued. Osiris subsequently fell by as much as 70%.)


In any event, despite the slow and steady liquidation, no one has yet run for the exits at Ortho�x. As a result,
the stock remains grossly overvalued. There is also virtually no short interest in the stock whatsoever. There
are millions of borrowable shares for shorting and the negative rebate on those shares is only 40 bps (almost
free). I expect at least 50% downside in the near term. Perhaps more over the longer term.

On the research side, the only real coverage comes from JMP Securities and Je�eries. But JMP rates
Ortho�x a “HOLD” and does not even include a price target. Je�eries rates Ortho�x a “BUY” but has not even
updated its coverage in almost 5 months, not even after the most recent earnings declines and visible
declines in the other business lines.


The point is that neither JMP nor Je�eries are really doing much work on Ortho�x or even really paying
attention. Given this, no one should be surprised that they have totally missed this upcoming FDA issue or the
accounting manipulation. When the stock price collapses to $15-17, they will simply pull their coverage.

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 4/30


Legal background – preview


Anyone who has followed Ortho�x is well aware of the company’s troubled background with regulators and
investors. Over the past few years, Ortho�x has paid approaching $100 million to settle a wide variety
of criminal violations and lawsuits for accounting misstatements and outright fraud.


Ortho�x is fond of stating that “10 out of 11 of our management team are new to Ortho�x”. So presumably the
past problems are all behind them. But in Appendix I, I will show how there are actually numerous individuals
from the bad old days who are still in the same senior roles at Ortho�x.


Keep in mind that Ortho�x’s past fraud and criminal behavior are NOT the crux of the current short thesis.
These problems were bad. Really bad. But by now they are all well known and fully disclosed.


The crux of the short thesis is that the impending FDA ruling and the current accounting manipulation are far
more relevant to the share price than the past fraudulent behavior.


The reason that I am highlighting this troubled past at all is that Ortho�x continues to mislead investors in a
very signi�cant way, but now it is just about di�erent issues. I am trying to highlight the pattern.


I will demonstrate below that Ortho�x is 100% aware of the impending FDA down classi�cation of its most
important product. Ortho�x even hired a lobbying �rm (King & Spalding) to try to sway the FDA (I have
included a copy of the letter from King & Spalding, along with links detailing over $1 million in payments). That
lobbying e�ort appears to have failed badly and the down classi�cation is still on track. There have even been
new developments in the past few weeks. But despite its knowledge and the huge signi�cance, Ortho�x has
failed to appropriately disclose any of this to investors.


In addition, I will show clearly below how Ortho�x has been manipulating its �nancial results by pulling various
accounting tricks. There is very limited sell side coverage on Ortho�x and none of these analysts have
adequately caught or highlighted the accounting manipulation. Had Ortho�x not performed such manipulation
in Q3, the stock would already be well below $30.


So again, just to be clear, Ortho�x’s past history of Medicare and accounting fraud are not the dominant
reason behind my short thesis. But for those who are new to the Ortho�x story, you should at least be aware
of the key highlights.


First, 4 years ago Ortho�x was found guilty of massive Medicare fraud.


Following that discovery, Ortho�x and various individuals pled guilty to obstructing a Federal audit which was
investigating the fraud. More criminal charges followed from that.


Ortho�x ended up settling with the DOJ and paying over $40 million in penalties. As part of the settlement, the
company entered into a “corporate integrity agreement” (“CIA”) with the DOJ in which it vowed to refrain from
further illegal activity for 5 years.


Yet within just 1 year, it was already uncovered that Ortho�x was involved in a massive bribery scandal in
Mexico, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices ACT (“FCPA”). The DOJ extended the terms of the CIA
(requiring additional years of probation) and Ortho�x paid large �nes, vowing to change its act. Yet within 1
more year, Ortho�x was involved in another bribery scandal in Brazil.


And then �nally, we hit the worst of the worst. Then, making matters even worse, as of 2015, Ortho�x was
required to restate inaccurate �nancials which had been released in some or all of 8 di�erent years including
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. This then resulted in a separate SEC investigation. Not
surprisingly, class action lawsuits then followed.

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 5/30


According to the lawsuits, the misstatements were not an accident or oversight. They were a deliberate set of
misrepresentations designed to boost apparent �nancial performance and thus the share price. Ortho�x
settled but would not admit wrong doing.


The pain from past frauds is still ongoing today. Ortho�x has already paid over $14 million in 2016 alone
(including in Q3) as a result of these past settlements and investigations. The total �nancial consequence are
now approaching in $100 million. For those who are interested, I have included full details of these past
frauds, along with links to the criminal indictments and news articles as Appendix I.


If investors had been actually holding out any hope for Ortho�x, it would be because they are hoping that CEO
Brad Mason can keep the company out of further legal trouble. Mason has been with Ortho�x in various roles
since 2003. During the peak of the fraud problems, he was working for Ortho�x as a consultant and advisor.
He had also served as Group President, North America, but was not implicated in the fraud.


Again, as I will demonstrate clearly, Ortho�x is well aware of the impending down classi�cation but has
withheld this critical information from investors. Ortho�x is also clearly manipulating its accounting numbers.
As a result, in my opinion, the “bad old days” of Ortho�x are not just a thing of the past.


Investment summary


Ortho�x is a medical device maker specializing in orthopedics. The largest source of revenue for Ortho�x
comes from its BioStim Bone Growth Stimulators (“BGS”). Bone Growth Stimulators are an external device
that use a pulsed electromagnetic �eld (“PEMF”)to help increase bone fusion in bone fractures, including
spinal treatment.


Ortho�x already holds the leading market share for BGS of around 35%. The other primary competitors are
Bioventus, Biomet, and DJO.


Beyond just revenue, BioStim is by far the most disproportionately pro�table product for Ortho�x. BioStim
accounts for the majority of pro�ts (more than 53% of net margin) at Ortho�x. In addition, BGS is also the
driving force behind any growth at Ortho�x.


As I will explain below, the sole reason that Ortho�x can command such high revenues and pro�ts for BGS is
the fact that it is classi�ed by the FDA as a Class III device. This restriction severely limits competition. New
entrants would be required to get Pre Market Approval (“PMA”) and/or run clinical trials. This takes years and
costs many millions of dollars. This high barrier to entry is why Ortho�x had previously been able to charge
Medicare as much as $4,000 for a device that only costs $100 to manufacture. But that is about to change
radically.


Ortho�x has several other product lines. But it is clear that none of them create a real reason to own the stock.
The impending down classi�cation of BGS is really all that matters. But for those who wish to better
understand the deepening declines in Ortho�x’s secondary businesses, I have included relevant details at the
bottom of this article.


Ortho�x’s distant second business had been Biologics (such as bone allografts) but this business is now being
eaten away on two fronts as shown below. Margins remain semi-strong, but quarterly sales have now
consistently shown declines rather than growth. And pricing has been under repeated pressure due to a
sharply increasing impact from a newly introduced competing product from DePuy (a unit of med device giant
J&J). Management has repeatedly stated that this segment is about to turn around and get better, and is then
surprised each time it gets worse. In fact, further declines are about to accelerate.


Ortho�x’s other business segments (Spine Fixation and Extremity Fixation) have shown much lower margins
and / or size. There has also been substantial trending weakness. Compared to BioStim, these are largely
undi�erentiated and low margin commodity products such as spinal screws, plates, rods and bars. Their
relative sales are shrinking rather than growing. In the most recent quarter, Spine Fixation revenues plunged

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 6/30


by almost 17%. The Extremity Fixation business is not really run out of the US, it is run out of Italy and
primarily sells outside the US. But the accounting systems is place are so bad that Ortho�x has been forced to
only recognize these sales on a “cash basis”. In other words, they only count the sales when the cash is
actually received.


The only point is that there is no way that these much smaller and struggling businesses, which are now
showing declines, are going to in any way o�set the tremendous loss about to a�ect Ortho�x’s main product,
BioStim BGS.


IMPORTANT POINT:


The only real reason to own Ortho�x stock is because of the high revenues, the high pro�ts and the
strong growth behind one single segment: BioStim BGS.


And now that is about to dramatically change.


So here is the kicker !


What no one seems to have �gured out is that the FDA is about to “down classify” Bone Growth Stimulators
(“BGS”) from Class III to Class II. This means that there is far less of a regulatory hurdle for new competitors
to start marketing BGS. With a much lower regulatory hurdle, cheap competition will be able to �ood the
market driving down prices and stealing most of the revenues outright. What revenues remain will end up on
razor thin margins.


The impact of unfettered cheap competition can be seen to be massive. Competitors will soon be able to
manufacture competing devices at prices which are as much as 80% below Ortho�x’s historical sales price.


Certainly no one on the sell side has properly highlighted this problem to investors. But this is because they
simply haven’t done the work.


The prospect of down classi�cation should become obvious to anyone who performs thorough research on
Ortho�x. Just read the documents and call the FDA and you will know right away.


In 2006, an FDA panel did actually formally vote to down classify BGS. That initial evaluation by the FDA was
in response to a petition from a low-priced competitor (RS Medical) who wanted to enter the BGS market.


According to the FDA panel, BGS clearly met the criteria for down classi�cation. As a result, the FDA
panel voted to down classify
(http://www.healthpointcapital.com/research/2006/06/09/class_iii_continues_for_bone_growth_stimulation/).
But then that vote was reversed following an aggressive lobbying e�or
(http://www.law360.com/articles/320791/rising-star-king-spalding-s-marian-lee)t by Ortho�x and the other BGS
manufacturers, using DC lobbying �rm King & Spalding. For obvious reasons, they wanted to keep out the
prospect of cheap competition.


But that was then. This is now. Literally everything has changed!


The process was gradual at �rst, but there have been signi�cant recent developments over the past few
weeks.


In 2012, there was a big change. Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation
Act
(http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/Signi�cantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm20027
The purpose of this act was to speed up and streamline the approval process while reducing regulatory
burden to enhance competition and product availability. As a result of this Act, the FDA began “re-reviewing’
hundreds of medical devices for potential down classi�cation.

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 7/30


In 2014, the FDA decided to revisit the down classi�cation of BGS speci�cally. That is where the new process
began.


As part of its 2014-2015 Strategic Priorities, the FDA speci�cally proposed that BGS be down classi�ed.
More recent developments over the past few weeks show that the date of reckoning is now getting much
closer.


Keep in mind that by the time of the FDA’s Strategic Review, the FDA already had in its possession all of that
lobbying information from Ortho�x. Yes, they already knew all of the arguments raised by Ortho�x’s lobbying
�rm. And yes, they still proposed to down classify BGS.


In 2015, the lobbyists once again responded for Ortho�x. (Here is a copy of the letter
(https://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/King-Spalding-Letter-to-FDA.pdf) that King & Spalding
submitted to the FDA). Their arguments were largely similar to the past arguments raised. E�ectively they are
simply trying to raise technicalities and trying to create bene�cial interpretations of language in the law. But as
we will see below, the Class III classi�cation for BGS just doesn’t make common sense. Following passage of
the FDASIA Act above, it is clear that these technical objections are not gaining much traction.


And now just a few weeks ago, even after the newest lobbying submission and the inclusion of the historical
submission, the FDA has chosen to proceed further with the process anyway.


And keep in mind that this time, it was the FDA that initiated the down classi�cation. This was NOT in
response to an outside petition. In other words, this is something that the FDA itself wants to happen.


IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT:


Just as of October 1st , 2016 (about 10 weeks ago) the FDA just transferred the BGS down
classi�cation process to the speci�c department responsible for handling the down classi�cation (the
department of Orthopedics). I have spoken to this department at the FDA. The point is that the
process is now “active”. The most important point is that the individuals within the FDA responsible
for this evaluation are the same people who previously voted to down classify BGS in the �rst place.


These developments are all very recent and have NOT been disclosed by Ortho�x, even though
Ortho�x clearly saw �t to hire and dispatch a lobbyist to attempt to �ght the threat.


As soon as Ortho�x loses its competitive “moat”, we will see revenue immediately fall by around 30% or more.
But the much bigger problem is that these revenues are actually responsible for a far greater share of pro�ts
at Ortho�x. So of much greater importance is the fact that pro�ts (net margin) will fall by nearly half. Any
prospects for growth at Ortho�x will evaporate immediately.


Again, this lack of disclosure to investors should be viewed in the context of a company which has been
busted for issuing false �nancials, defrauding Medicare, obstructing a federal audit and paying bribes in
foreign countries.


By looking to the site OpenSecrets.Org (https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/client_reports.php?
id=D000064557&year=2015) we can actually �nd out that total payments to King & Spalding just for
attempting to defend BGS. These payments now total over $1 million. So this is not a minor e�ort. This tells
me that the perceived “risk” is very real and the consequences are very substantial. It also tells me that this
event is important enough that it should be adequately disclosed to investors.


Perspective on conducting healthcare research


Above I mentioned Osiris Therapeutics. After I exposed Osiris, the CEO was forced to resign, the company
had to restate its �nancials and an SEC investigation ensued. The stock cratered by as much as 70%. All of
the information in my article was obtained from publicly available sources that should have been available to
anyone.

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 8/30


Earlier in 2016, I wrote an article (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3985452-expect-orasure-drop-35-percent-
next-week) where I stated that I was highly certain that medical device maker OraSure was going to lose a
major, multi-year contract with AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBV)) within just the
next few days. This contract was very important, because it accounted for over $40 million and more than
100% of Orasure’s net income.


It was well known that the contract was up for review, with a noti�cation date of July 1st, but sell side analysts
kept assuring investors that the contract was safe. Recent support from the sell side had pushed the stock up
by 10-15%.


A number of skeptical readers stated that there was simply no way I could know for sure that OraSure was
losing this contract in advance, and that I was simply “talking my book” to bene�t my short position.


Instead, within just 24 hours (July 1) management arranged a hasty pre-open conference call to announce
the fact that they had indeed just lost that Abbvie contract. Their announcement was clearly made as a
direct response to what I had exposed in my article.


Here is the headline from July 1 (just 24 hours after my article):


July 1: AbbVie backs out of OraQuick HCV test co-promotion deal, OraSure down 16%
(http://seekingalpha.com/news/3191422-abbvie-backs-oraquick-hcv-test-co-promotion-deal-orasure-16-
percent)


Once again, my skeptics were equally unhappy. Now they were insisting that they only way I could know this
was though some sort of inside information. Obviously that is not the case. The research underlying my article
should have been self evident.


I have undergone a similar process with Ortho�x and I am now 100% con�dent that we will see an FDA down
classi�cation in the near future.

Note: There is a 6 month “tail” on the revenues at OraSure, such that the company has not yet hit the revenue
cli�. Some investors still haven’t �gured this out. That, combined with some misplaced Zikka hype, have
continued to support the share price. But I expect at least 40-50% downside from current levels.


No one should have been blindsided by any of these stocks. Links to my articles are included in the

How important is BioStim BGS to Ortho�x ?


(Overwhelmingly, extremely important !)


Ortho�x’s business is divided into 4 segments (“SBUs”).


BioStim
Biologics
Extremity Fixation
Spine Fixation


The charts below show how Ortho�x is overwhelmingly dependentupon BioStim.


The points to be made are as follows:


BioStim is the largest revenue generator
BioStim is also (by far) the largest pro�t generator in terms of net margin. This is
due to its disproportionately high gross margin.
BioStim is the only unit showing any growth
BioStim has been increasing as a percentage of revenue

Again, it is worth repeating: BioStim BGS is the largest revenue segment, it is responsible for more
than 50% of pro�ts, it represents the ONLY growing business segment, and it has been increasing as a
percentage of revenue.


BioStim BGS is absolutely, positively the ONLY reason that anyone owns Ortho�x.


Looking at Class III vs. Class II – recent developments


Documentation included below clearly indicates that BGS will be down classi�ed. But before we get into that,
it is worth understanding the logic here. It should quickly become clear that BGS should simply not be a Class
III device. Common sense (and the FDA) will make this clear.


Bone Growth Stimulators are an externally worn device which emits an electronic pulse which enhances bone
fusion. The devices are currentlyclassi�ed by the FDA as Class III devices.


Class III is the highest classi�cation for medical devices and is reserved for the most risky devices. Such
devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed. For example, when explaining
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194438.htm) its classi�cations, the FDA
cites replacement heart valvesas a typical Class III device.

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 14/30


Getting approval for a Class III device is very time consuming as well as very expensive. As such, this
has kept lower priced competition from entering the market. This lack of competition has allowed
Ortho�x to charge premium prices and capture the largest market share among a very small number
of competitors. In the past, we have seen Ortho�x charge as much as $4,000 for a device which only
costs $100 to make.


So what does a real Class III device look like ?


The FDA cites heart valves as a Class III example for a reason. First, (clearly) heart valves are internal
devices which must be surgically implanted. Second, any problem with a heart valve has a high likelihood
of causing death. In other words, Class III devices such as heart valves are very risky and this is why they
are treated as Class III.


Other devices (such as external devices, not surgically implanted and not life threatening) are clearly
far less risky than this. This is why they are treated as Class II.


As part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
(http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/Signi�cantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm20027
(“FDASIA”) of 2012, and in order to help increase competition and improve availability, the FDA has begun a
large e�ort to down classify various devices. This allows such devices to be marketed with far less onerous
requirements. (Please note that this Act was passed AFTER the previous attempt at down classi�cation on
BGS. In other words, since that time, there is a new and enhanced e�ort by the FDA to down classify less
risky devices).


As noted at the FDALawBlog (http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2015/05/fda-
announces-progress-regarding-balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-for-pmas.html), as part of
its 2014-2015 Strategic Priorities
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHVisionandMis
the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) committed to assuring the “appropriate balance
between premarket and postmarket data collection to facilitate and expedite the development and review of
medical devices.”


The FDA assembled a large list of devices for potential down classi�cation.


Very quickly (by 2015) the FDA immediately rejected the obvious candidates. These devices were ones
which should certainly remain as Class III devices. As noted
(http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2015/05/fda-announces-progress-regarding-
balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-for-pmas.html), the FDA quickly declined to make any
change to the status of 96 devices which were already Class III and were up for consideration.


(The point is this: if the FDA were going to reject down classi�cation of BGS outright, they would have
already done so…).


After the initial round of rejections, the FDA did propose to down classify 21 speci�c product codes, listed
here (http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2015/05/fda-announces-progress-regarding-
balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-for-pmas.html). As is clearly shown, Bone Growth
Stimulators (product code: LOF) are included on that list of 21 candidates which the FDA proposed to down
classify. The complete list has been included as Appendix II below.


Following this, we can see from the FDA’s website
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTransparency
so far, that the FDA has already down classi�ed 17 di�erent products
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTransparency
The “hit ratio” therefore appears to be very high for products on this list. If they made the list, then they are

going to be down classi�ed. The down classi�cation initiative at the FDA is still ongoing. Already in 2016, the
FDA has down classi�ed 7 more devices
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTransparency


But wait, it gets better.


The products just successfully down classi�ed in 2016
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTransparency
obviously very similar in nature to the Bone Growth Stimulator. For example, here is the �nal order
(https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/18/2016-08898/cardiovascular-devices-reclassi�cation-
of-external-pacemaker-pulse-generator-devices) in 2016 down classifying External Pacemaker Pulse
Generators. Here is the �nal order (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/25/2016-
12333/cardiovascular-devices-reclassi�cation-of-external-cardiac-compressor-reclassi�cation-of) in 2016
down classifying External Cardiac Compressors.


Just as with BGS, each of these devices are:


– External electrical devices


– Not surgically implanted


– Not life threatening


In any event, so far, it looks as if nearly every device that made the proposal list ends up being down
classi�ed. This is especially true of the devices that are similar to BGS.


So what does the FDA say ?


Again, I did contact the FDA’s department of Orthopedics, which I con�rmed is responsible for reviewing the
classi�cation. Obviously, they aren’t going to tell me the result of any �nal order until it comes out, but some
useful information can always be had by calling. I am highly con�dent that the sell side has made no such
e�ort prior to putting out their perfunctory reports (all of which are now outdated). Go ahead, ask them.


The biggest thing I learned was what seems to explain the delay so far in down classifying BGS. The process
had previously been assigned to the department of Neurology and Physical Medicine. This was the wrong
department. Just as of October 1st, 2016 (just 10 weeks ago) I was told that the process had been transferred
to the department of Orthopedics.


First o�, this makes much more sense, given that BGS are an Orthopedic device.


Second, it explains why the down classi�cation hasn’t already happened.


Third, it tells me that the process is still proceeding on course towards down classi�cation.


Perhaps of greatest importance is the fact that I was told that the team reviewing the down classi�cation
includes many of the same people from the team that had previously voted to down classify BGS in prior
years. These people already know all of the arguments raised by Ortho�x’s lobbyist and they have chosen to
proceed anyway.


BGS down classi�cation – chronology summarized


2006 – FDA proposes to down classify various medical devices including BGS from Class III down to Class II
in order to streamline approvals, stimulate competition, improve availability and lower prices. The proposal to
down classify BGS was prompted by an external petition to the FDA from medical device maker RS Medical
which wanted to make competing lower cost devices. FDA panel initially votes to down classify BGS
based on evidence.

2006 – Massive lobbying e�ort (http://www.law360.com/articles/320791/rising-star-king-spalding-s-
marian-lee) to the FDA by King & Spalding to reverse the vote succeeds. Vote is reversed and BGS not
down classi�ed. (King & Spalding is a D.C. based lobbying �rm which represents Ortho�x and others in front
of the FDA).


2012 – Congress passes the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
(http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/Signi�cantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm20027
in order to streamline approvals, increase competition and improve availability of med devices.


2014 -Following passage of the FDASIA Act, the FDA begins a Strategic Review
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHV
which it seeks to down classify various devices. The FDA quickly proposes to down classify BGS (product
code: LOF). But this time, the FDA took its own initiative to down classify and was not prompted by any
external petition.


2015 – King & Spalding again submits its arguments against down classi�cation in 2015, focusing on
technicalities.


2015 – By the end of 2015, the FDA declines
(http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2015/05/fda-announces-progress-regarding-
balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-for-pmas.html) to down classify 96 medical devices
which it believes should remain Class III. However, an additional 21 devices (including BGS)
(http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2015/05/fda-announces-progress-regarding-
balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-for-pmas.html) are placed on the list of devices
proposed to be down classi�ed. By December 2015, FDA announces that it had already
completed itsevaluation of 100 (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdatrack/view/track.cfm?
program=cdrh&status=public&id=CDRH-Cumulative-Percentage-of-Device-Types-Evaluated&fy=All)% of the
devices on the list.


2016 – After evaluation period was completed in 2015, FDA formally down classi�es 7 devices
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTrans
so far in 2016 (so far, as of July 2016 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/26/2016-
17609/physical-medicine-devices-reclassi�cation-of-iontophoresis-device-intended-for-any-other-purposes)).
This takes the total to 17 devices
(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO�ices/O�iceofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHTransparency
far. The FDA repeatedly down classi�es external devices which are not life threatening (similar to BGS). The
down classi�cation process continues to be ongoing.


2016 – In October, FDA transfers the down classi�cation process for BGS to the department of
Orthopedics, including the same people who previously voted to down classify BGS. Again, the FDA
has continued taking these steps even after it has received all of the lobbying arguments from King &
Spalding.


Where are the disclosures from Ortho�x


Again, back in the “old days” (actually just a few years ago), Ortho�x was found guilty of Medicare fraud, of
obstructing a Federal audit, of bribery in two di�erent foreign countries. It then came out that multiple years’
worth of �nancials had been falsi�ed and needed to be restated.


But supposedly the past is behind us.


If the threat of BGS down classi�cation merits $1 million in total payments to a lobbying �rm in DC, then it
certainly must be both highly likely as well as very severe in its consequences.


Ortho�x is clearly very concerned, yet there has been no su�icient warning to investors.

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 17/30


Looking at accounting manipulation


I spend a lot of my time analyzing �nancial and accounting information. But I am not a CPA. As with
everything else in this article, the analysis below is just my opinion. And in my opinion, the manipulations
below were very stealthy. But once you know where to look, they become downright obvious.


Let’s start with the old accounting anecdote:


A businessman was interviewing job applications for the position of manager of a large division. He quickly
devised a test for choosing the most suitable candidate. He simply asked each applicant this question, “What
is two plus two?”


The �rst interviewee was a journalist. His answer was, “Twenty-two”.


The second was a social worker. She said, “I don’t know the answer but I’m very glad that we had the
opportunity to discuss it.”


The third applicant was an engineer. He pulled out a slide rule and came up with an answer “somewhere
between 3.999 and 4.001.”


Next came an attorney. He stated that “in the case of Jenkins vs. the Department of the Treasury, two plus two
was proven to be four.”


Finally, the businessman interviewed an accountant. When he asked him what two plus two was, the
accountant got up from his chair, went over to the door, closed it, came back and sat down. Leaning across
the desk, he said in a low voice, “How much do you want it to be?” He got the job.


Accounting manipulation – the smart way vs. the dumb way !


Again, the crux of the sell thesis on Ortho�x is that the FDA will down classify BGS and then revenues and
pro�ts for Ortho�x will quickly evaporate. As soon as the FDA makes that announcement, we will see Ortho�x
trade to $15-17.


But as a separate issue, the visible accounting manipulation is just icing on the cake for this short trade. It
means that even if we brie�y ignore any impact from the FDA, Ortho�x should still be trading well below $30 –
TODAY !


Looking back at the history of Ortho�x, we can see that the company has often employed a wide range of
devices in order to get its �nancial numbers up.


Note that Q2 results were a notable disappointment causing the stock to sell o� by nearly 20%. Then in Q3
numbers were again a disappointment due to each of the non-BGS businesses performing poorly. Note that
these results were STILL a disappointment even though they were actually boosted by the manipulations
shown below. As a result, the stock fell again. Without the manipulations below, the numbers would have been
much worse. We can see that in reality, Ortho�x should be trading well below $30.


Obviously Q3 was another disappointing quarter for Ortho�x. The only “saving grace” for Ortho�x in its bad
Q3 numbers was a sharp spike in its reported adjusted EBITDA. But so far no one seems to have caught on
to the accounting tricks used to achieve this.


For Q3, Ortho�x reported $23.5 million in EBITDA (http://seekingalpha.com/article/4017364-ortho�x-
international-n-v-s-o�x-ceo-bradley-mason-q3-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript). It was a notable surge in
an otherwise bad quarter, and seemed to indicate that the declines were perhaps not as severe as we might
think.

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 18/30


But as shown here, the real number should have been $18.65 million, not much of a surge at all. As a result,
Ortho�x was able to boost its EBITDA by almost $5 million, or 26% by using arti�cial devices. As for the
analysts, they either didn’t catch these moves or else they simply didn’t care.


Keep in mind that there are two ways to go about manipulating one’s accounting numbers: the smart way and
the dumb way.


The dumb way is to �gure out how big of a �nancial hole you need to �ll and then conduct one gigantic
revision right at the top or bottom line. This is the dumb way because it is so conspicuous that even the laziest
of analysts and investors will be unable to ignore it.


Instead, Ortho�x has manipulated its numbers “the smart way”. Ortho�x �nds multiple di�erent levers which
can be pulled. Each one is too small to really get much attention. In addition, each manipulation is derived
from an area of the income statement which is not typically an area of heavy focus. As a result, no one
catches on.


Infrastructure spending irregularities – $1.73 million = 9.3% boost


As readers of my past articles will remember, any time I come across blatant “mistakes” or “inconsistencies” in
a company’s SEC �lings, it should be cause for great concern. This is especially true when looking at the
fraud in the backgrounds of the individuals as highlighted above. Not surprisingly, whenever I “catch them in
the act”, I �nd that these “mistakes” or “inconsistencies” ALWAYS seem to bene�t management and the
�nancials. This was exactly what led to my exposure of Osiris Therapeutics and we are now seeing it again
with the “mistakes” I have found in Ortho�x’s SEC �lings.


(Not surprisingly, these “mistakes” for some reason always seem to be of bene�t to the company and not to
their detriment. Go �gure.)


In 2014, Ortho�x initiated “project Bluecore” to improve systems processes, including ERP.


In the Q2 form 10Q (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wWCu.htm#1stPage), Ortho�x discloses that: “Over the
life of the project the Company has spent$27.5mm, of which $18.6mm has been capitalized. We expect to
spend an additional $1.9mm”.


But then in the Q3 form 10Q (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wPut.htm#1stPage) (3 months later), Ortho�x
disclosed that: “Over the life of the project, the Company (http://www.secinfo.com/$/SEC/Registrant.asp?
CIK=884624) has spent$26.6 million, of which $18.1 million has been capitalized. We expect to spend an
additional $0.8 million over the remainder of the project.”


Did you catch that ?!?


In Q2, Ortho�x stated that they had already spent $27.5 million. But 3 months later, somehow this historical
numberactually went down after the fact to $26.6 million. Obviously the real world doesn’t work this way.
But thanks to the magi of accounting, companies can always �nd a way to pull a rabbit out of a hat to help
boost a bad quarter.


The di�erence here presumably runs straight to the bottom line, with a bene�t of $900,000.


Here is where it gets really weird.


Even though the incurred cost supposedly declined after the fact, Ortho�x still chose to add back an
additional $827,000 to EBITDA and EPS as one time adjustments. This alone added 4 cents to EPS.


To see these add back changes, it is easiest to compare the Q2 press release
(http://ir.ortho�x.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=982164) to the Q3 press releas
(http://ir.ortho�x.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=996447)e.

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 19/30


In total, the infrastructure manipulations bene�ted Ortho�x’s EBITDA calculations by $1.73 million. (A boost of
9.3% from the base line number).


As you can see, the size of this one item is not massive and it was buried in a line item that likely no one
(other than me) even focuses on. This is how the trick eludes attention from investors and analysts.


One time tax provisioning reversals – $2.4 million = 12.9% boost


This next lever was used to provide an apparent cut to Sales & Marketing Expense to abnormally low levels.
S&M has typically run consistently around 45%. But in Q3, this was slashed to 42.4%. A large part of this was
due to an accounting reversal of certain tax liabilities which �ow through S&M. These are things like sales and
use tax, property taxes, and other business taxes (ie. Not income taxes). Ortho�x had provisioned this at the
beginning of the year and then reversed it just in time to boost quarterly numbers as soon as results fell far too
short. This is something that is entirely left to the discretion of management.


In total, the S&M tax manipulations bene�ted Ortho�x’s EBITDA calculations by $2.4 million. (A boost of
12.9% from the base line number).


So again, a not-too-large accounting reversal in an area that doesn’t get much attention. So investors don’t
really notice. But it is starting to add up.


Reversing allowance for doubtful accounts – $720,000 = 4% boost


In Q (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wWCu.htm#1stPage)2, allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.56
million. But for Q3, that number was reduced to $8.84 million, resulting in a savings of $720,000. The
allowance decreased not only in absolute terms, but also as a percentage of sales. So far I have found no
explanation to justify this $720,000 bene�t.


In total, change to allowance for doubtful accounts bene�ted Ortho�x’s EBITDA calculations by $720,000. (A
boost of 4% from the base line number).


Again, small enough to not raise �ags and in a place where no one is looking.


Reversal of Obsolete Inventory – ???? = undisclosed size !


This one is great !


Ortho�x had previously taken a reserve for writing o� Excess & Obsolete Inventory (“E&O”). This amount or
reason is not described in the �nancial statements so it is impossible to calculate just how much this boosted
EBITDA. In any event, somehow Ortho�x suddenly decided that formerly unsellable inventory (Excess &
Obsolete) could now be sold. And, as always, this fortuitous development just happened to come along right
when Ortho�x was having a terrible quarter and needed to make its numbers.


In discussing E&O, Ortho�x did disclose on the conference call (http://seekingalpha.com/article/4017364-
ortho�x-international-n-v-s-o�x-ceo-bradley-mason-q3-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript) that gross margin
had been boosted by around 1%. As a result, we can estimate this arti�cial bene�t at around $1 million. (1%
of approximately $100 million in sales).


But since I can’t document the calculations, I am just ignoring this last item.


So even without the extra million from E&O, we can see that EBITDA was boosted by 26%. None of these
items was big enough to stick out on its own and none of them really occurred in any key area of focus for
analysts or investors.


Everything was cleverly kept below the radar, and the headline of soaring EBITDA reads great in an otherwise
very disappointing quarter.


Beyond BioStim BGS – looking at the Biologics segment

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 20/30


Looking at the information above, it becomes clear that the only real reason that anyone owns Ortho�x at
current prices is because of a misplaced con�dence in BioStim. And when the FDA moves to down classify
Ortho�x, that reason is going to be decimated.


In the past, there was sometimes a second reason to own Ortho�x and that was its Biologics business.


Biologics mainly consists of bone allografts and tissues, including Trinity Elite and Trinity Evolution, which are
“derived from human cadaveric donors”. (i.e. harvested from dead people).


(Incidentally, this happens to be the same business that Osiris Therapeutics is in, so it is one that I understand
quite well.)


Ortho�x’s bone allografts are mainly comprised of its Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution products. These
contain viable cells and are used in surgery in the treatment of musculoskeletal defects for bone
reconstruction and repair.


But keep in mind that Ortho�x doesn’t actually PRODUCE these products and does not even own the IP.


What Ortho�x really has is just a marketing agreement with the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation
(https://www.mtf.org/) (“MTF”) which is a non-pro�t tissue bank.


In reality, MTF does all the work and then Ortho�x just charges a “marketing fee”. The revenues are not
enormous but the margins appear to be high because there is no cost of goods sold. There are of course
heavy selling costs.


MTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals and surgery centers and other points
of care for service fees


In the past, this segment was attractive for two reasons. First, because Biologics a�orded high net margins of
around 50%. Second, in the past, this segment also used to show appreciable growth. For example, from
FY2014 to FY2015, Biologics grew by 7.1%.


This has now begun to dramatically change along with the adoption of a competing product called Vivigen
from Depuy (part of J&J). And it is about to get worse.


When Depuy’s Vivigen product was launched last year, it was quickly named among “THE NINE BEST NEW
SPINE TECHNOLOGIES FOR 2015 (https://ryortho.com/2015/10/the-nine-best-new-spine-technologies-for-
2015/)“. And as soon as its sales started to gain traction, it began to have an appreciable e�ect on Ortho�x’s
Biologics division.


Here is a quote from that award:


ViviGen is the �rst cellular allograft to focus on recovering, processing and protecting viable lineage
committed bone cells. New evidence supports the use of bone cells instead of MSC’s for bone healing.
It is made of viable cryopreserved corticocancellous bone matrix and demineralized bone. Because of
its properties, ViviGen can be considered to be an alternative to autograft.


And here is what began happening to Ortho�x’s Biologics sales just after Vivigen was launched.

Last year, Biologics was growing by over 7%. Then Q1 continued to show slight growth, but just barely. But
then Q2 got hit hard with a 6.7% decline in Biologics sales. Here is what management had to say on the Q2
conference call (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3994337-ortho�x-internationals-o�x-ceo-brad-mason-q2-
2016-results-earnings-call-transcript):


Net sales in our Biologics SBU declined 6.7% for the period due to our reduction in Trinity volume,
which was primarily a result of an exclusion from a large national hospital account, as well as an
increase in competing product o�erings.


We remain optimistic about this SBU returning to growth in Q3 and Q4 and achieving growth in
the low-single-digits for the full year.


Note that despite managements “optimism” about a recovery in Biologics into Q3, we can see that Biologics
sales declined again in Q3. SCROLL

7/5/2019 Short OFIX. Orthofix to plunge 50% on undisclosed FDA issue and accounting manipulation - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 22/30


Management then changed its views on the entire business. On the Q3 conference call
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/4017364-ortho�x-international-n-v-s-o�x-ceo-bradley-mason-q3-2016-results-
earnings-call-transcript?part=single), management noted that:


Considering our result over the last few quarters in our Biologicsbusiness, we’re now anticipating
a low to mid single-digit DECREASE in year-over-year net sales for the fourth quarter and full-year
2016.


The reality is that Biologics is getting hit on two fronts. Anyone who is familiar with this business (including
Osiris, Ortho�x and Depuy) knows that it is a business that is gradually getting more competitive and less
pro�table each year. It is getting worse rather than better.


Extremity Fixation Segment


Even in a good quarter, Extremity Fixation only represents around 20% of pro�ts for Ortho�x. This is
somewhat of a niche business where Ortho�x already commands a large market share. As a result, easy
opportunities for growth are very limited, even though quarterly results are often volatile.


Ortho�x was originally founded in Italy a few decades ago and was focused on the Extremity Fixation
business. These devices consist of pins, rods, bars and screws to hold bones in place after complex fractures.
They are used for things like deformity correction and limb lengthening. In contrast to the Spine segment
below, these devices are primarily used externally.


Ortho�x continues to sell these devices, but the business is largely run out of Italy. Around 80% of the sales
are non US sales. Obviously the rising US dollar has not been kind to the results for this segment. As a result,
management repeated discloses the “constant currency” results which naturally appear much better on paper.
But in reality, this means little for dollar denominated investors in a US company which reports in dollars.


This segment has a history of accounting problems. The segment cites limited visibility for the fact that it has
been forced to use “cash basis” accounting to account for all sales. In fact, this is almost exactly what we saw
at Osiris not long before the SEC investigation. It was part of my original short thesis on Osiris prior to the
70% plunge in the stock.


The cash collection policy means that revenue reporting is very lumpy and volatile. The past 2 quarters
showed decent apparent growth. But this was largely because they were being compared against an easy
previous comp when cash collections had been low.


Anyone who has historically been long Ortho�x is certainly not banking on Extremity Fixation to move the
needle.


Spine Fixation Market


Ortho�x acquired the Spine Fixation business back in 2006. The company now provides a fairly full range of
spine �xation products, including screws, rods, and plating systems, etc. In other words, this is a “hardware”
business.


This is e�ectively a higher volume, low margin, commodity hardware business. Total pro�ts from this segment
amounted to just 6% of total pro�ts for Ortho�x.


One thing to note is that management discloses that 65-70% of the Spine Fixation sales actually go through
the Biologics sales force.


So in other words, when the sales force is selling higher margin bone allografts, they then attempt to bundle in
some sales of low margin spine products.

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 23/30


But following Depuy’s launch of Vivigen, Ortho�x’s Biologics sales have been getting hit hard. This therefore
has an even greater impact on Spine Fixation because it is such an undi�erentiated product.


As a result, Spine Fixation revenues fell 17% YOY in Q3. Without a strong Biologics o�ering, Spine is going to
be a product that is harder and harder to sell.


Again, certainly no investors are banking on this small segment to move the needle for Ortho�x.


Conclusion


Because BGS are classi�ed by the FDA as Class III medical devices, there is very little competition in the
space. As a result, Ortho�x can charge ultra high prices and still command a huge market share.


The FDA has proposed to down classify BGS to Class II status, which would make it easier and cheaper for
competitors to o�er similar devices. Cheap competition will �ood the market at a fraction of the cost.


Timing is uncertain, but given the latest developments in October the down classi�cation could come quite
soon.


King & Spalding is a DC lobbying �rm that represents Ortho�x and others in front of the FDA. The �rm has
already been paid over $1 million for its attempts to in�uence the FDA to not down classify Bone Growth
Stimulators. The risk and the consequences for Ortho�x are big, they are real and they are near. This is why
over $1 million has been spent. Yet investors have not been adequately warned.


Ortho�x’s signi�cant history of Medicare fraud and accounting misstatements are not the crux of the short
thesis. But they should serve as food for thought regarding why the FDA issues have not been adequately
disclosed to investors.


I believe that the down classi�cation of BGS is a virtual certainty. First of all, it just makes common sense.
Second, we can see from the FDA’s actions that they have continued to proceed with down classi�cation
through multiple milestones, including in recent weeks. Third, the FDA has recently been down classifying
multiple very similar devices.


Back in 2006, the lobbying e�ort by King & Spalding succeeded. The FDA had already decided that the
evidence indicated that BGS should be down classi�ed. But King & Spalding was able to get the FDA to
actually reverse its decision.


But then came the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
(http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/Signi�cantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm20027
which was passed by Congress in 2012.


Following that Act, the FDA began to revisit hundreds of devices that should be down classi�ed. Last year
(2015), the FDA did immediately rule out down classi�cation for 96 devices which it determined should remain
as Class III. So if the FDA were going to not down classify BGS, they would have already made that decision.


The FDA then selected 21 devices which it proposed to down classify.


BGS are included on that “short list” of 21 items that the FDA wants to down classify.


So far, through 2016, the FDA has already down classi�ed 17 devices. This includes 7 in 2016 and includes
multiple devices that were very similar to BGS (external, electronic devices which are not life threatening).


King & Spalding sent in another lengthy letter to the FDA in an attempt to oppose the down classi�cation, but
the FDA down classi�cation process has continued through multiple milestones since then.


In October 2016 (just 10 weeks ago), the FDA transferred the down classi�cation process to the department
of Orthopedics which is responsible for handling this.

https://moxreports.com/orthofix/ 24/30


I believe that BGS will de�nitely be down classi�ed. As soon as the FDA announces this, Ortho�x’s share
price will trade to $15-17.


Recent accounting manipulations consisted of multiple items, each one of which was too small and too
obscure for investors to notice on an individual basis. But in aggregate, they had a material impact on Q3
results. Without the bene�t of this, Ortho�x would already be trading below $30 (even before the FDA action).


The only sell side research on Ortho�x comes from two �rms who have issued brief reports which are already
months outdated. They clearly are not following any of these developments.


BGS is responsible for more than half of the pro�ts at Ortho�x. Ortho�x is overwhelmingly dependent upon
BGS.


Each of Ortho�x’s other business lines are facing unique challenges, pressures and declines. The only reason
that anyone actually owns Ortho�x is for the stable revenues and high pro�tability of BGS.


Again, as soon as the FDA down classi�es BGS, I expect the share price to quickly trade to $15-17.


Appendix I – Ortho�x regulatory violations, accounting misstatements and outright fraud


Please understand that the contents of this section are NOT a key part of the short thesis. I am simply
including details on historical problems to demonstrate that various individuals have been present or involved
in activities which blatantly deceived investors, consumers and or the government. The point I am trying to
make is that there is a reason why investors have not been warned about the ongoing down classi�cation
proceedings. Investors should also consider this background when evaluating the section on accounting
manipulation.


In the past, we can see a host of regulatory violations and outright fraud at Ortho�x. This is a company that
has been busted by the DOJ, the SEC, the department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the
OIG among others. The violations were as egregious as they were numerous and Ortho�x was clearly
found entirely guilty.


As would be expected, a number of individuals were �red dung the course of these investigations and
indictments. A number of other individuals within management were criminally indicted themselves.


But surprisingly, given the severity of the fraud and regulatory violations, there has been a large degree
of management continuity. Many of the same individuals are in place, still running Ortho�x.


Current President and CEO (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage) Brad Mason has been with
Ortho�x o� and on since 2003 (13 years). Between 2010 and 2013, he had served in a variety of consulting
and advisory roles. Davide Bianchi, President of Ortho�x International
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage) has been with Ortho�x since 2013. Michael M. Finegan
is Ortho�x’s Chief Strategy O�icier (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage) and has been with
the company since 2006 (10 years). Je�rey M. Schumm is Ortho�x’s Chief Administrative O�icer
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage), General Counsel
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage), and Corporate Secretary
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage) and has been with the company since 2007 (9 years).
Robert A. Goodwin is the President of Biologics (http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wGxd.htm#1stPage) and has
been with the company since 2006 (10 years).


This management continuity needs to be kept in mind when evaluating recent developments, including failure
to disclose very material FDA problems (which, as demonstrated, are fully known by management) as well as
recent accounting manipulation in 2016.


Unfortunately, the reality is that fraud and manipulation are absolutely rife within the Med Device
space in the US.

Just this week, Ortho�x added a new board member
(http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161213006261/en/Ortho�x-Announces-Appointment-Alex-
Lukianov-Board-Directors), Alex Lukianov, who had formerly been CEO of spinal med device competitor
NuVasive (NASDAQ:NUVA (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUVA)). Last year Lukianov was forced to
“resign” as CEO following his “violations of personnel and expense reimbursement policies“. NuVasive
has so far refused to disclose further details. However, just after his resignation NuVasive ended up paying
millions to settle fraud charges with the DOJ involving violations during his time as CEO. According to the
DOJ press release, “Defrauding Medicare and Medicaid by paying kickbacks to physicians and
promoting uses not covered by Federal health care programs will not be tolerated“. In any event, after
leaving NuVasive, Lukianov was in need of a job, so now he is a board member at Ortho�x. Earlier in the year,
Ortho�x appointed (http://ir.ortho�x.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=961245) Michael Paolucci to the board.
Paolucci is another former NuVasive executive who had worked under Lukianov.

Already in 2016, Ortho�x has incurred over $14 million of expense in relation to an SEC enforcement action
which it was forced to settle over sweeping accounting misstatements and Medicare fraud. This includes
millions in expense in the most recent Q3 alone.


Looking back, we can evaluate the relevant events between 2012 and 2015.


Violation #1 – Medicare Fraud (GUILTY)


In 2012, Ortho�x pled guilty to civil and criminal Medicare fraud charges
(http://www.law360.com/articles/401639/ortho�x-to-pay-42m-to-end-doj-medicare-fraud-case)with the DOJ,
including $42 million in �nes. The fraud involved gouging Medicare for inappropriate an overpriced sales of its
Bone Growth Stimulators (the main product at Ortho�x).


Article: Ortho�x To Pay $42M To End DOJ Medicare Fraud Case
(http://www.law360.com/articles/401639/ortho�x-to-pay-42m-to-end-doj-medicare-fraud-case)


In that suit it was noted that, “Ortho�x made false claims for payment for certain items of durable medical
equipment used by patients in their homes, in particular osteogenesis stimulators, covered by Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal and state purchasers. Medicare would pay approximately $4,000 to purchase a
device that costs only $100 to manufacture.” Currently Ortho�x is still “onprobation
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1fnT1.wDcw.htm?Find=probation&Line=2505#1stPage)” as a result of that guilty
plea. Ortho�x discloses that, “In the event that we fail to satisfy these terms of probation, we could be
subject to additional criminal penalties or prosecution, which could have a material adverse e�ect on our
business, �nancial condition, results of operations and cash �ows.”


Violation #2 – Obstruction of a Federal Audit (GUILTY)


From looking at the website for the FBI (https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/ortho�x-
vice-president-sentenced-for-paying-medicare-kickbacks), we can see that in connection with their Medicare
fraud, Ortho�x was also found guilty of obstructing a federal audit in an attempt to cover up the fraud. In
the end, at least 9 doctors were also charged in the fraud ring.


Despite the tremendous legal exposure from ongoing “criminal probation”, they continued to commit
other �agrant violations.

Violation #3 – Paying Illegal Bribes in Mexico (GUILTY)


Ortho�x later settled with the DOJ over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act where it paid bribes to
win business in Mexico. Not only was Ortho�x prosecuted by the US government, but it also paid $4 million to
the Mexican government.


Article: Ortho�x Pays $7.4 Million To Settle Mexico Bribes
(http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2012/7/10/ortho�x-pays-74-million-to-settle-mexico-bribes.html)


Violation #4 – Paying Illegal Bribes in Brazil (GUILTY)


Ortho�x entered into a “deferred prosecution agreement” which stated that the company must refrain from
future violations for 3 years or face additional penalties. But within just 1 year (in 2013), the company was
already investigating improper foreign payments in another country, this time in Brazil.


Article:Ortho�x reaches agreement “in principle” with SEC over Brazil FCPA allegations
(http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/article/1070123/ortho�x-reaches-agreement-)


As a result, Ortho�x was then currently embroiled into a DOJ investigation which encompassed illegal
payments in both countries.


But wait, it gets better.


Violation #5 – Accounting Misstatements (8 years !)


Then in 2015, the company completed a multi year �nancial restatement due to accounting
misstatements which then became part of an SEC investigation. Amazingly the, accounting misstatements
were gigantic and covered misreported numbers over a tremendous timespan, including 2007, 2008, 2009,
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 ! That is 8 years containing misstatements!


Article:Ortho�x to restate results due accounting errors (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ortho�x-to-
restate-results-due-accounting-errors-2014-08-19)


The point is this:


I have demonstrated Ortho�x’s clear knowledge of this impending crisis. Yet investors have not been
adequately warned. This event clearly merits its own very prominent risk factor in Ortho�x’s �nancials, yet this
has not been done. Ortho�x should also be spelling this event out to investors in its presentations and
conference calls. Again, this has not been done.


Those with a good view on Ortho�x’s regulatory history are likely NOT SURPRISED but this omission.


They should also not be surprised by recent accounting manipulation which has been used (including in the
most recent quarter) by Ortho�x to meet Wall Street estimates and boost the share price. Ortho�x
management throws in every accounting gimmick but the “kitchen sink” in order to manipulate their apparent
�nancial results. Overall, Ortho�x recently in�ated its adjusted EBITDA by as much as 26% using pure
accounting tricks.
