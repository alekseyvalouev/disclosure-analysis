Under serious scrutiny, Universal Display resorts
to flexible promotion.


Posted on October 7, 2013 by asensio.com


Today’s price movement in shares of Universal Display Corp.


(“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) is being attributed to an announcement by


LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LPL) about production of flexible


displays. The announcement is old news, has no tie to UDC


revenues, products, inventions or technology. Despite UDC


management’s repeated allusion to a potential long-term licensing


agreement with LG, such an agreement has never materialized.


Increasing investors’ confusion, UDC’s promoters-in-chief at oled-


info.com immediately added a number of meaningless statements


repeatedly regurgitating Samsung’s supposed announcement of a


flexible screen product “within days.”


LG Display’s announcement was a reiteration of news from June


about mass production of flexible OLEDs. See here and here.


Despite the fact that LG’s plans for flexible OLED production have


been in the works and publicly known for some time, UDC has not


been able to secure a long-term licensing agreement with LG.


According to UDC’s own 10-K, LG’s only purported relationship with


UDC involves material purchases without a long-term licensing


agreement, and definitely not an agreement involving LG’s


development of flexible OLEDs.


Oled-info.com, which promotes UDC religiously, circulated an


article today about Samsung’s purported involvement with flexible


displays without providing or even referencing a source. According


to the oled-info promotional piece, “Samsung will release the first


flexible OLED phone… ‘within days.’” Oled-info.com has been
publishing articles about Samsung’s supposed future launch of


flexible displays for months, without ever referring to a Samsung


source. This appears to be nothing more than uninformed

promotion designed to feed off of the old-news LG announcement


and claim the same product is being produced by UDC’s only


material customer, Samsung. Regardless, Samsung already pays a


flat licensing fee for rights to ALL of UDC’s patents, according to


UDC disclosures.


There are confirmed accounting and disclosure irregularities at


UDC that have been the subject of repeated inquiries by the


Securities & Exchange Commission. These irregularities create


investor confusion about UDC’s alleged invention, the termination


of the Samsung agreement, and the expiration of UDC’s key patents.


The most material issues for investors are patent office and court


decisions that could invalidate UDC’s key patents and when


Samsung will decide to pull the plug altogether on its relationship


with UDC – not what a blogger says about Samsung based on


mysterious, unnamed sources.
