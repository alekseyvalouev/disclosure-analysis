Park City Group’s Revenues
From Most Important
Customer Past Due
February 3, 2014 By GeoTeam


Park City Group (PCYG) describes itself as a “cloud-
based, big data, SaaS software company” that sells
inventory management and supply chain software.
Management has stated that PCYG’s future growth is
centered on its relationship, executed on May 18, 2013,
with ReposiTrak, its key “customer” that “pays”PCYG
subscription fees for the EXCLUSIVE right to use some of
its software. We believe there is significant evidence that
PCYG has been less than transparent about its growth
engine and most important customer. Despite the fact that
PCYG’s trailing non-GAAP net income is nil, its stock has
nearly tripled since the consummation of the ReposiTrak
deal and trades at 13x EV/Sales, 13x P/S, and 112x
EV/EBITDA . We will show why we believe that at most
PCYG, currently trading near $9.00, should at a maximum
be trading closer to $3.50 which is where it was before
ReposiTrak was baked into the share price as the “key
growth driver”.


Our research shows that:


1. ReposiTrak, the source of meaningful annual license and
management fees for PCYG during its Fiscal year ended
June 30, 2013, is a development stage company that
generates little or no revenue and is past due on the
majority of these fees that have been booked as
revenue. Without ReposiTrak’s financial impact,
PCYG’s stated revenue growth would decrease from

positive 12% to Zero. In fact, PCYG has acknowledge
ReposiTrak’s inability to cover its operating costs and other
financial obligations with a disclosure in an exhibit of one of
its SEC filings which includes the
following passage (ReposiTrak was previously known as
F&D):


“F&D is currently seeking financing
necessary to adequately capitalize F&D and
fund its operating expenses and financial
commitments, including its subscription
payments.”


2. Management uses accounting practices, that are likely
GAAP exceptions, to record uncollectable subscription
revenues and management fees and give the appearance
that PCYG’s financial statements are sound despite the fact
that disclosures in the most recent 10K clearly state
that ReposiTrak is well past due on and unable to pay
the majority of these fees.


3. It is very likely that ReposiTrak should be considered a
related or controlled entity and is not accounted for or
disclosed as such. This tactic allows PCYG to keep booking
revenues from ReposiTrak without recognizing its
expenses or even disclosing ReposiTrak’s true revenues and
expenses. If ReposiTrak’s operating performance was made
public we suspect the bloom would quickly come off this
overhyped venture.


4. PCYG has agreed to use its own shares to compensate
ReposiTrak founders for their original investment in the
company.


PCYG has an option to acquire 75% of ReposiTrak’s
issues and outstanding shares for just $100,000. As
part of this agreement, the majority owner of

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 3/36


ReposiTrak, Leavitt Partners, has agreed to dispose of
at least 66% of its ownership interests for its share of
the $100,000 consideration to be paid by PCYG. The
PCYG option implies the total grossed up value of
ReposiTrak is $133,000.
It looks like PCYG is essentially bailing out
ReposiTrak’s seed investors for the value of their
original investment ($1.0 million) only 15
months after the consummation of the software
licensing deal.


5. PCYG has conducted securities offerings with individuals
(For example, Rodman and Renshaw) that have known
connections to publicly traded companies that have
previously been accused of fraud.


The Elevator Pitch- Details Buried In Exhibits of SEC
Filings Shed Light


PCYG’s increased revenues in 2013 and stated growth
strategy are, as exhibits in SEC filings prove, based almost
entirely on ReposiTrak, a quasi-related party that is staffed,
financed and, in fact, if not technically, controlled by PCYG.
PCYG SEC Filing exhibits also reveal that the majority of
the revenues attributed to ReposiTrak have been classified
as past due by PCYG. As a result, (85%) of the license
revenues and management fees that PCYG charged
ReposiTrak during the fiscal year ended June 2013
have proven to be uncollectable. Given this reality, the
company reclassified the accounts receivable due from
ReposiTrak to notes receivable, thereby avoiding the
recognition of appropriate allowances for doubtful
accounts, which is a form of kicking the can down the road.
Eventually,ReposiTrak has to pay or the balance due will be
written off.


More importantly, PCYG treats its relationship with
ReposiTrak as an independent contractor even though, as

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 4/36


we will show, ReposiTrak is essentially part of PCYG.
We believe ReposiTrak should more appropriately be
accounted for as a subsidiary or division of PCYG. If
ReposiTrak was treated as such,PCYG could not book
revenues from them since ReposiTrak is generating little to
no revenue on its own behalf and the costs associated with
the business would have to be recorded as current period
expenses.


The current arrangement appears to be a clever scheme
whereby PCYG spends shareholder capital to fund a startup
company, and makes it appear, by booking uncollectable
management fees, that ReposiTrak is reimbursing this
capital outflow, while at the same time allowing PCYG to
book uncollectable subscription revenues from ReposiTrak.
Thus, the relationship with ReposiTrak had an immediate
and, in our opinion, unjustified positive impact on PCYG’s
financial statements. In fact,PCYG’s reported revenue
growth in 2013 (FY June 30) of 12% appears to be
almost entirely due to past due license and
management fees billed to ReposiTrak.


In Management’s Words, PCYG’s Future Depends on
ReposiTrak’s Success


The company’s CEO stated in a speech given at a recent
conference in Dallas that ReposiTrak is focused on the
worldwide issue of food safety in the supply chain and that
it will be:


“…named by the most prominent opinion makers
in the industry as the industry standard platform
for tracking and tracing”…


There is little doubt that PCYG’s long term viability and
growth story is reliant on ReposiTrak. PCYG Management
has stated as much:

“… ReposiTrak is also well positioned to
become the leading component of Park City
Group’s business, and a significant contributor to
improving food and drug safety.”


How important is ReposiTrak to PCYG?


If ReposiTrak’s revenues were eliminated from the
consolidated operating results in 2013, the first year of
contribution, PCYG’s 2013 consolidated sales growth
turns to no growth at all from positive
12%. (See Exhibit A)


PCYG has failed to deliver consistent organic top line
growth and has logged lumpy profitability and losses since
it became a public company through a reverse merger in
2001. PCYG’s revenues in 2008 were only $3.3 million,
less than the $3.7 million the company reported in 2001
when it became a public company. Then, in 2008 PCYG
started billing clients on a monthly basis instead of one
time license fees. To accelerate this SaaS initiative,
PCYG acquired Precient Applied Intelligence, a developer of
patented retail supply chain solutions and services, in
January 2009, giving the company a temporary boost in
revenues (Precient was generating revenues of $9 million).
“SaaS” revenue now consists of about 71% of total
revenues, up from around 50% in 2010. But it seems that
the organic growth anticipated when Precient was acquired
did not materialize. Revenue growth since then has been
flat, increasing from $10.9 million in 2010 (first full year of
Precient) to only $11.3 million in 2013. 2013 Adjusted
EBITDA of $2.3 million nearly matches adjusted EBITDA
achieved in 2010. See Exhibit B for more detail on PCYG’s
unimpressive past.

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 6/36


Given its uninspiring past, PCYG needed something new to
drive growth and investor interest. Management seems to
have found the “future” with ReposiTrak, a company that:


“…provides food and drug retailers and their
suppliers with a cost-effective service to help
protect their brands, and reduce regulatory and
financial risk associated with the rapidly evolving
Food Safety Modernization Act.”


PCYG got the “desired benefit” from its fee arrangement
with ReposiTrak in FY2013, reversing two straight years of
declining revenues since 2010, the first full year of
Precient’s revenue contribution. Investors, however, should
not take the positive impact of the revenues PCYG is
booking for ReposiTrak at face value.


PCYG’s Recognition Of ReposiTrak’s Revenues Is
Highly Suspect


We have several issues with PCYG’s recognition of revenues
from ReposiTrak. The amounts due to PCYG from
ReposiTrak are apparently not collectible. So even if the
revenues are recorded there should be a substantial
allowance for doubtful accounts applied against the balance
due from ReposiTrak. And, the license and management
fees do not appear to be based on an arm’s length
transaction. PCYG has stated that it does not own
ReposiTrak, despite evidence that proves it owns the
ReposiTrak trademark and web domain. We will show that
PCYG owns, finances, staffs, houses and effectively
controls ReposiTrak.

A subscription fee relationship executed in April 2012 (Q4
of FY ended June 30, 2012), and later amended twice,
between PCYG and ReposiTrak, includes the following fee
schedule:


It also states that PCYG will pay ALL expenses necessary
to provide management services and maintain Business
Expense which it will bill ReposiTrak plus a 5% gross-up.


During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, PCYG
recognized $1.26 million in subscription fee revenues
and $622,833 in management fees from ReposiTrak.


The first indication that ReposiTrak is having problems
meeting its financial obligations is apparent in the following
passage taken from PCYG’s 10K FY 2013:


“For the year ended June 30, 2013, total revenue
attributable to ReposiTrak under the Original
Agreements was approximately $1.88 million,
of which $1.6 million was paid in the form of a
promissory note issued by ReposiTrak to the
Company.”


Interestingly, the majority of ReposiTrak’s 2013 revenue
contribution to PCYG was paid with a form of an “IOU”.
Digging deeper, Exhibit 10.19 of the 10K discusses
delinquent fees owed to PCYG from ReposiTrak. ($1 million
past due subscription fees to use its PCYG software plus
$622,863 management fee and expenses):


“The parties agree and acknowledge that a
portion of the Annual Fees for the period April 1,
2012 to April 1, 2013 and the first installment of

the Annual Fees for the period April 1, 2013 to
April 1, 2014 are past due (“Past Due Fees“),
which Past Due Fees total $1 million.”


“The parties agree and acknowledge that the
Management Fee and Management Expenses
incurred for the period April 1, 2012 to April
1, 2013 in connection with the provision of
Management Services is $622,863, which
amount will be added to the balance of and shall
be paid to PCG pursuant to the terms of,
the Original Note.”


The verbiage in the above passage…


“pursuant to the terms of, the Original Note. “


…is referring to a promissory note, 8% annual interest,
issued to PCYG by ReposiTrak in the amount of
$1,622,863, consisting of these past due
subscription fees and unpaid management
fees/expenses. Investors can view the details of the
promissory note in exhibit 10.20 of the 2013 10K:


“ReposiTrak, Inc., a Utah corporation, (the
“Company”), promises to pay to the order of Park
City Group, Inc., or its registered assigns
(“Holder”), the principal sum of One million Six
hundred Twenty-two thousand Eight hundred
Sixty-three Dollars ($1,622,863), on the earlier
to occur of April 30, 2015 or the date of
termination of that certain Omnibus Subscription”


It is apparent that the promissory note arose from
uncollectable accounts receivable that were booked as
revenue in 2013. This assumption is confirmed with the

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 9/36


following accounting entry reflected on page F-5 of the
2013 10K showing the entire notes receivable was
reclassified from accounts receivable:


Thus, there is no question that the $1.62 million notes
receivable is comprised of accounts receivable generated
from its relationship with ReposiTrak that could no longer
be classified as such without recording a substantial
allowance for doubtful accounts. The fact that the due date
of the notes could extend to 2015 has also led us to
conclude that ReposiTrak is apparently unable to pay its
bills and/or that PCYG believes ReposiTrak is not close to
generating meaningful sales and cash flows from
operations. Due to interest, the note has grown to
$1,655,807 as of Q1 2014 ended September 30, 2013.


We view the designation of the amounts due to PCYG as
Notes Receivable as a façade. Companies often reclassify
accounts receivable to notes receivable when it becomes
evident that the timely collection of the balance due is
uncertain or materially past due. Conveniently, it can serve
as a way for a company to avoid/delay increasing the
allowance for doubtful accounts entry and taking a charge
on its income statement. If the balances are uncollectable,
the financial statements should reflect the net realizable
value of the amounts due from ReposiTrak. We believe
management is skirting GAAP by reclassifying what are
clearly uncollectable accounts receivable as notes
receivable. Exhibit C includes an analysis of revenues
PCYG booked from ReposiTrak over the last five quarters.


The net result of our findings is that at least 85% of
ReposiTrak’s 2013 revenue contribution of $1.88 million to
PCYG is unlikely to be converted to cash. Investors should
note that the issue of whether PCYG realizes value from
the ReposiTrak notes receivable or not is no small matter.

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 10/36


Despite ReposiTrak’s inability to meet its financial
obligations, management continues to exercise wide
discretion in how it recognizes revenues from ReposiTrak, a
venture for which its success is still up in the air, by issuing
an “I Owe You” when it is deemed that ReposiTrak can’t
honor its commitments:


“1.5.2 of the Exhibit 10.19, Omnibus agreement:
Annual Fees shall be paid in cash or alternatively,
in the event ReposiTrak has insufficient cash on
its balance sheet to pay the Annual Fees, as
determined by ReposiTrak in its sole
discretion, such Annual Fees may be paid by
issuing to PCG a senior promissory note in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (each, a “Note“).”


“The Parties further agree and acknowledge that
in the event ReposiTrak has inadequate cash on
its balance sheet to pay PCG the Management
Fees and Management Expenses at such time as
the same are due and payable under the terms of
this Section 2, such amounts shall accrue and
shall be paid by issuing to PCG a Note, which
Note shall reflect all amounts due PCG by
ReposiTrak during the applicable quarter for
Management Fees and Management Expenses
incurred during such quarter.”


Really, At the Sole Discretion of ReposiTrak?


Eliminating the ReposiTrak notes receivable (and therefore
revenues) would for all intents and purposes debunk
investors’ enthusiasm over the ReposiTrak’s growth
prospects, and even its viability. PCYG’s management
clearly agrees with us as is evidenced by the following

passage on page 15 of PCYG’s 10K for the year ended June
30, 2013:


“In the event of a default under such notes, the
Company’s financial results, including its financial
condition, may be materially and adversely
affected.”


ReposiTrak Is Clearly Controlled By PCYG


ReposiTrak is controlled by a consulting firm called Leavitt
Partners, a firm run by former Utah governor Michael
Leavitt. Based on the documents included in this report, we
believe that Leavitt is allowing PCYG to use ReposiTrak as
an independent, third party entity so it can book revenues
(without recognizing the associated expenses) through
what appears, in fact, to be a related or controlled party.


Just like we have seen in China, third party ownership
on paper does not always mean the entity is really an
independent third party. According to Utah government
documents, the only two directors of ReposiTrak are
Michael Leavitt and his lieutenant Rich McKeown (see
Exhibit D), who we believe have limited roles in actually
operating the company.


We think PCYG uses a very loose interpretation of
“independent contractor” in order to record revenues from
ReposiTrak but not its operating expenses. Referencing a
statement from an exhibit to the first subscription
agreement:


“PCG is acting as an independent contractor
hereunder and shall not be deemed to be
engaged in a joint venture, partnership, agency
relationship, or similar arrangement for purposes

of this Agreement. Each party is responsible for
the conduct of its own personnel.”


We disagree with Management’s claim that ReposiTrak is a
third party entity and PCYG is serving as an independent
contractor in an arm’s length relationship. Nothing could be
further from the truth:


PCYG Management’s Dubious Assertion They
“Don’t Own ReposiTrak”


PCYG’s management states that ReposiTrak is a robust
solution created through collaboration between Leavitt
Partners and Park City Group. In the Three Part Advisors
2013 Southwest IDEAS Conference held in Dallas, Texas,
November 21, 2013, the CEO of PCYG, Randy Fields, said
that “We don’t own ReposiTrak“. Admitting ownership,
of course, would mean that PCYG could not record
subscription revenues and management fees and would
probably have to consolidate ReposiTrak operating results
with its own. And, more importantly, ReposiTrak’s revenues
and operating results would be visible to investors. If that
were to happen, the market would likely discover the
ReposiTrak emperor has no clothes.


Contrary to Mr. Fields’ assertion, ReposiTrak’s own website
states that the company is partially owned by PCYG,
“ReposiTrak is a partnership jointly owned by Leavitt
Partners and Park City Group….”

The current operating arrangement between PCYG and
ReposiTrak illustrates just how dependent ReposiTrak is on
PCYG. Among the business activities that PCYG
performs for ReposiTrak are sales support and activities,
accounting processes, software maintenance and
development, customer implementations, customer
support, and other administrative services. Given the broad
array of activities performed by PCYG on ReposiTrak’s
behalf, one has to wonder what if anything ReposiTrak does
on its own behalf. You be the judge on who is running
ReposiTrak. See Exhibit E at the end of this report for the
details of PCYG’s involvement in ReposiTrak’s day to day
activities.


The bottom line is PCYG appears to be spending
shareholder capital to run ReposiTrak and then
billing ReposiTrak for reimbursement of such fees
(counted as revenue), that ReposiTrak can’t pay.


PCYG and ReposiTrak have Adjoining Office
Space


PCYG entered into a lease for office space in Salt Lake City
of September 12, 2012, just months after consummating
the ReposiTrak deal. According to the mailing addresses
disclosed in the contract between the two companies, the
companies occupy adjoining office space in the same
building:

PCYG Owns
ReposiTrak’s Web Domain And Trademark


PCYG Boasts A $160 Million Market Cap. Insiders
Place Much Less Value On The Enterprise.


Arguably, the majority of the market value ascribed to
PCYG is based on the promise investors see for ReposiTrak.
It therefore stands to reason that ReposiTrak’s investors
would benefit most from this market bonanza. ReposiTrak’s
leading investor is Leavitt Partners. The Omnibus
agreement reveals that Leavitt partners own a controlling
interest (at least 51%) in ReposiTrak:


“Leavitt beneficially owns a substantial and
controlling interest in all currently issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock issued by
ReposiTrak”


PCYG places great value on its relationship with Leavitt
partners. The following is a quote from a press
release touting PCYG’s relationship with Leavitt:


“Leavitt Partners and Park City Group Unite to
Build a Global Food and Drug Safety Registry:


By working with Leavitt Partners, our clients gain
access to the most experienced team of food and
drug safety experts on the planet, and the
combination of the two organizations ensures

that all regulatory requirements are efficiently
and cost effectively met.”


Given how valuable the market perceives ReposiTrak to be,
it is striking how easily and cheaply Leavitt and
ReposiTrak’s other investors are willing to part with their
shares. Leavitt, for example, has executed an agreement
giving PCYG the Option to acquire 75% of ReposiTrak’s
issued and outstanding shares for $100,000 (which would
value ReposiTrak at $133,000). If PCYG exercises this
option, Leavitt has agreed to surrenderenough shares so
that it will only own 17% of ReposiTrak after the
transaction. Please see Sections 3 and 4 of the September
23, 2013 Omnibus Agreement for all the details of the
Option and Share Surrender agreement. When reading the
Option agreement, notice that it makes reference to,
“Exhibit B hereto (“Shareholders Agreement”)“…


“As a condition to the exercise of the PCG Option,
PCG shall agree to be bound by, and shall
execute an agreement of joinder in respect of,
ReposiTrak’s Shareholders Agreement dated as
of January 1, 2013, a copy of which is attached
as Exhibit B hereto (“Shareholders
Agreement”).”


…but omits this exhibit from the filing. This exhibit would
likely disclose who owns ReposiTrak, a detail, in our
opinion, that PCYG management may not want investors to
know.


We find it curious that Leavitt would part with its shares so
cheaply. Why not, for example, try to exchange their
illiquid ReposiTrak shares for liquid PCYG shares?


It’s not just Leavitt that is willing to sell. The Omnibus
agreement discloses that ReposiTrak issued shares to 16

investors for a consideration of $975,045. And now, per
a stock exchange agreement,PCYG has granted them the
option to exchange their shares for $1 million worth of
PCYG stock. Please see section 5 of the Omnibus
agreement, “Stock Exchange”.


Per verbiage in an earlier amendment of the Subscription
agreement (sections 3 and 4) filed on June 20, 2012, it is
revealing that the structures of the option and stock
exchange agreements seemed to have been in
place well before ReposiTrak received the $975,045
investment:


“Client (ReposiTrak) hereby grants to PCG an
option to acquire Six Hundred and Sixty
Thousand shares of Client’s common stock. The
option is exercisable in increments and at any
time during the option period in PCG’s discretion
upon payment of $100,000 for all shares or a pro
rata portion for any other increment.”


“PCG hereby grants to Client the right, but not
the obligation, to exchange (“PCG Exchange”)any
of the Client’s common stock that Client sells to
outside investors (the “Client Shares”), up to a
maximum amount of $1.0 million.”


The only thing we can surmise from these agreements is
that they seem to speak to a lack of confidence of
ReposiTrak’s shareholders in the business. If that’s the
case, why not exchange their illiquid shares for whatever
value they can realize? Whatever the motivation, the fact
that ReposiTrak’s shareholders are willing to give up their
shares so easily raises the issue of just how much the
business is really worth. This begs the question; are the
ReposiTrak investors right about ReposiTrak’s value, or is
the market?

Links to Colorful Characters


PCYG conducted a PIPE offering executed in March 2013,
where shares were registered on May 13, 2013 through
Dawson James, a small Florida brokerage firm.


“In the Private Placements on March 14, 15 and
22, 2013, we issued 756,858 shares of Common
Stock and Warrants to purchase an additional
249,763 shares of Common Stock to a group of
accredited investors (the “Investors”), resulting
in gross proceeds to us of approximately $2.64
million. Dawson James Securities, Inc.
(“Dawson James”) acted as the sole placement
agent for Private Placements to certain Investors
on March 14, 2013.”


The bankers on the deal for Dawson, Craig M. Schwabe,
Noam Rubinstein, Mark Viklund, and MichaelVasinkevich,
joined the firm in September, 2012. We are particularly
concerned because these individuals were all previously
employed by Rodman and Renshaw. Rodman was the lead
on many public offerings by fraudulent Chinese companies,
and we are skeptical of the due diligence capabilities of this
group given the numerous past blow ups at Rodman.
Almost immediately after the placement in PCYG, the team
promptly resigned from Dawson.


Is ReposiTrak Living Up To Internal Expectations?


Investors should not assume that the revenues PCYG
records for license fees billed to ReposiTrak have anything
whatsoever to do with what ReposiTrak is billing its
customers. PCYG’s subscription revenues represent a
minimum guarantee whether ReposiTrak has revenues or
not. ReposiTrak’s revenues represent actual sales to end
users. Unfortunately, investors do not have visibility into

https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 19/36


ReposiTrak’s revenues and operating results. That’s
because ReposiTrak is conveniently treated as an
independent entity that PCYG licenses its software to. The
fact that ReposiTrak is unable to meet its financial
obligations speaks volumes about how the company is
performing, and the evidence is not encouraging.


For example, the fact that the due date of the notes
receivable could extend to 2015 indicates that
management does not expect ReposiTrak to generate
meaningful revenues and cash flows from operations
anytime soon. This is evidenced by the wide latitude
management exercises on how it recognizes revenues from
ReposiTrak. As the balances due from ReposiTrak build up,
management, per the Omnibus agreement, can simply kick
the can down the road by continuing to convert accounts
receivable to notes receivable without addressing the
underlying issue that the receivables are not collectable.


We found it particularly interesting that PCYG has altered
the percentage of revenue fees it would receive under the
subscription agreement with ReposiTrak. Under the first
two arrangements (May 22, 2012 & June 20, 2012) PCYG
would not take any percent of revenue fees until revenue
exceeded $12 million and $17 million, respectively. The
second amendment filed on June 20, 2012 actually
disclosed ambition fees based on a percentage of sales
assumption as high as $150 million! The third agreement
(Omnibus) filed on September 23, 2013 now has no
restriction on revenue levels. Apparently at one time, the
sky was not the limit for ReposiTrak. We believe
management may have realized that its expectations for
ReposiTrak generating significant revenues during the
current contract span (3 years) were unrealistic since it
appears that ReposiTrak has generated no significant
product revenues in the 21 months since the 36-month fee
arrangement was executed. See Exhibit E at the end of

this report for a summary of the changing fee
arrangements.


At the end of the day, this charade can only go on for so
long. Eventually, somebody has got to pay and the
evidence to date is that unless ReposiTrak is able to ramp
up its business quickly and start generating meaningful
revenues and cash flows from real world customers, it is
not going to be them. These circumstances could make the
PCYG story a house of cards that is based on company
press releases referencing potentialpartnerships, pilot
studies and endorsements. What is conspicuously absent
from the ReposiTrak picture is actual revenues from real
customers.


ReposiTrak’s Revenue Model Appears Dubious


One likely explanation for the slow ramp up of ReposiTrak’s
business is its revenue model. The company’s website
states the following:


“ReposiTrak is a no cost, easy-to-use
solution that reduces the liability created by
food safety issues in your supply chain. Through
pro-active management of all your suppliers’
documents (from indemnification agreements to
insurance certificates, etc.); by performing
robust and timely traceability of products
(including ingredients)all the way through the
supply chain from farm to fork; and by
identifying where product likely is and how much
is there. You’ll save time and money in the event
of a recall.


We help you manage your risk and liability in
three ways: (1) document management, (2)
tracking and tracing from farm to fork and (3) by

There are challenges associated with ReposiTrak’s hub
(retailers and wholesalers) and spoke (their suppliers)
business model. The service is “free” to retailers and
wholesalers meaning they don’t have a great deal of equity
in the program. And, the cost burden both associated with
subscription fees of $100 per facility AND the cost of
assembling documents, gathering data and entering it in
the system is entirely on the suppliers.


Exactly what is in this for the suppliers other than
keeping the retailers or wholesalers happy?
Can the retailers and wholesalers compel their
suppliers to use the system and comply with the costs
of initially populating the system with data and then
maintaining that data over time?
And, who sells the suppliers on the system, signs
them up, trains them, provides customer and

technical support, and ensures they are using the
system properly?


Frankly, the entire model seems like a utopian systems
solution for well-meaning and worthy causes that will not
be easily sold and implemented on a large scale.


PCYG Is Not a High Growth SaaS player/Valuation:


We do not consider ReposiTrak to be a meaningful factor
when valuing PCYG shares. At an EV/S of 13 PCYG is
clearly overvalued, especially given what we consider to be
its dismal growth track record. And we think the market
valuation of PCYG shares pre-ReposiTrak of around $3.50
reflects this sentiment.


If one were to eliminate ReposiTrak revenues from
consolidated 2013 and first quarter 2014 sales, the already
unimpressive growth story would worsen. The compounded
annual growth rate (CAGR) in total revenues from 2010
(first full year of Precient) to 2013 decreases from 1.3%
to negative 3.8%. However, management touts its
subscription specific growth rate as the proper metric to
gauge its performance. But that measure is no better. The
CAGR in Subscription revenue from 2010 to
2013 decreased from 10.5% to 5.8% without
ReposiTrak. Also, subscription revenue since FY2012
(first impact of ReposiTrak) is substantially reduced
for every annual period and Q1 2014. These
observations are extremely important since management
has clearly indicated that ReposiTrak is expected to be
PCYG’s future. The tables in Exhibit A illustrate our point.


We think most investors would agree with our sentiment
that this type of growth from a “SaaS” model, especially
after eliminating ReposiTrak, does not justify anywhere
near the tier one valuations PCYG shares are commanding.

In fact, top tier SaaS companies generally are required to
exhibit at least 20% + top line growth.


Here is a table of the take out EV/S multiples of some high
profile publicly traded SaaS companies with revenue
growth of at least 20% that helped us conclude that with
or without ReposiTrak, PCYG is clearly mispriced based on
its EV/S of 13.

Conclusion


At this time we think positive investor sentiment over
ReposiTrak is misplaced. The stock is being helped along by
company press releases talking
of potential partnerships, pilot studies
and endorsements. We conclude that ReposiTrak is a high
cost and high risk call option that is losing value quickly
due to its apparent inability to generate revenues and pay
its bills. The $133,000 value ReposiTrak’s investors have
placed on the company based on the option and share
exchange agreements executed with PCYG speaks for itself.
Furthermore and, perhaps most importantly, formidable,
more established and better capitalized competitors, with
partners such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Microsoft

Corporation (MSFT), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and
Motorola, have already created software products that
address the Food and Safety Modernization Act. The leader
in this space, PLEX Systems received a $30 million capital
infusion in December 2012 (see Exhibit G).


We have no problem that PCYG is pursuing new areas of
growth, but we do have a problem with its revenue
recognition practices. At best it appears to us that PCYG is
using shareholder money to “fund” a startup venture,
recognize uncollectible revenue, while already making
ReposiTrak investors whole before receiving meaningful
cash flow from the venture, not knowing if the endeavor
will ever pay off or to what magnitude. At worst it appears
that management is playing some type of shell game.

Exhibit B: PCYG Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA –
2001 to 2013


There has been little if any core growth of PCYG’s revenues
historically and management has not shown the ability to
consistently execute its business plan. Despite this
lackluster performance, PCYG’s current market valuation
would have investors thinking the company is growing
rapidly with boundless potential. But this is simply not the
case. The company has failed to deliver any consistent
organic top line growth and has logged lumpy profit and
losses since it became a public company through a reverse
merger in 2001.


PCYG’s proprietary technology, which is intended to help
clients reduce inventory and labor costs, was developed at
Mrs. Fields Cookies. We don’t think investors should place
undue faith in the systems of a company that ended in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy or, for that matter, in management
that has failed to implement a successful growth strategy
at Mrs. Fields or, so far, at ReposiTrak and PCYG. Consider,
for example, that PCYG’s revenues in 2008 were only $3.3
million, less than the $3.7 million the company reported in
2001 when it became a public company.


Perhaps in response to anemic/unpredictable growth, PCYG
changed its name from Fields Technology to Park City
Group in 2008, the same year management started billing
clients on a monthly basis instead of one time license fees.
Concurrent with the changed billing strategy, the company
began to refer to itself as a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”)
company, and upon filing its 10-K for the period ended
June 30, 2008, the company introduced its “SaaS
Initiative” (Page 9 of 10K). The company then acquired
Precient Applied Intelligence, a developer of patented retail
supply chain solutions and services, in January 2009.

5/23/2018 Park City Group's Revenues From Most Important Customer Past Due | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/park-city-groups-revenues-from-most-important-customer-past-due/ 26/36


The Precient acquisition facilitated the company’s transition
to a SaaS/cloud model giving it a boost in revenues as
Precient had an annual revenue run rate of around $9
million. But it seems that the organic growth anticipated
when Precient was acquired did not materialize. Revenue
growth since then has been flat, increasing from $10.9
million in 2010 (first full year of Precient) to only $11.3
million in 2013. 2013 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million
nearly matches adjusted EBITDA achieved in 2010. The
following chart reflects PCYG’s revenue and EBITDA
performance before and since the Precient acquisition:


1 Adjusted EBITDA was calculated by adjusting net income
for non-cash items and non-operating income/expenses.


Exhibit C: Analysis of revenues PCYG booked from
ReposiTrak over the last five quarters.


We postulate that a $1 million capital infusion into
ReposiTrak (see share exchange in Omnibus agreement)
that may have helped fund some of the initial subscription
payments has been depleted and that business has not
been self-sustainable


Exhibit D: The only two directors of ReposiTrak are Taylor
Leavitt (Michael Leavitt’s son and Partner and Managing
Director at Leavitt Partners where he heads the company’s
Equity Practice) Rich McKeown (President and CEO of
Leavitt Partners):
