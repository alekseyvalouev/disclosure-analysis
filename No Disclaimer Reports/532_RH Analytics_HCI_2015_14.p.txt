HCI Group: Jack Of All Trades

Summary


HCI implements the 'jack of all trades' investment program, and ramps up risk in the
process, by investing in several alternative strategies.


HCI's 10-Q shows investments in several new investments that appear to be hedge
funds, including distressed debt and long-short funds.


Risky assets as we define them have grown from approximately 20% of the portfolio
at the end of 2013 to 40% in Q1'15.


With the core business set to decline, management appears committed to either
generating returns by other means or spending shareholder cash trying.


A review of the HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) Q1'15 10-Q points to a persistent trend with the
company: increasing risk. Management's willingness to take on increasingly risky ventures
in the hope of generating returns is evident in its turn to wind-only policies and the
company's investment program. Out of mainstream, one could say fringe, investments
began with real estate development and have since grown to include direct lending and
hedge fund investing. It appears as if management is going to find a way to stem the
pending decline of returns on capital or spend all the cash trying.


On the Q1'15 conference call, HCI's management addressed the company's investment
program in something of a cursory way. They stated that investments in fixed income and
equity securities increased $75.5 in the quarter to $218M. While true, we don't consider it
material, particularly because HCI should have an active investment portfolio in fixed
income. What we more interesting to us is what the company did not discuss on the call:
the risk ramp in the investment portfolio.


The table below shows details of HCI's investment accounts, with the exception of fixed
income.

Our table includes equities and what we consider alternative investments, which combined
can be thought of as risk assets. As indicated, HCI's exposure levels to more risky assets
than typically associated with insurance company investment programs increased from
$33.9M to $105.9M, or 3x over the period in question.


Importantly, risky assets have increased relative to the overall investment portfolio. At the
end of 2013, what we define as risky assets were 23.2% of the portfolio. As of Q1'15, that
figure has almost doubled to 40.1% of the investment portfolio. It appears as if after a
massive, liquidity driven 5-year bull market in risky assets, management has determined it
is time to get in on the game.


The interesting aspect is that the company's real estate investments are now one of a few
alternative investments. In our review of the 10-k, we discussed the company's investment
in what appears to be a private business development company, BDC. This quarter, there
are two other alternative investments, which are shown below.
