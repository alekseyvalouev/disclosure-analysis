Medifast (NASDAQ: MED): Like Lumber Liquidators,  


But With Undisclosed Toxic Metals,  


and A Supply Chain Twist 


PART I 











▪ Optavia products are priced and perceived to be safe, high quality, and a premium brand. 


▪ Optavia powders are so expensive, Herbalife* powders can be purchased for 38%-49% less! 


*Herbalife has been accused of ripping off customers and selling overpriced goods. 


 
Question #1: Are Optavia products safe and high quality as their premium pricing signals? 











“Facing an increasing number of personal injury lawsuits, coupled with the fraud claims brought 


by the FTC, Jason [now known as Medifast/Optavia] filed for bankruptcy in 1994.” –

Gotham and Independent Laboratory Methodology: 


Background – Gotham City Research submitted Optavia and Medifast product samples to a leading 


laboratory in August of 2018. Two rounds of testing were conducted. Given that Medifast’s products have 


contained concerning levels of contaminants in the past, we believed that testing for heavy metals was 


merited. The analytical test reports from the lab indicate that Optavia products contain concerning levels 


of lead and cadmium. We have submitted the original analytical test reports to the FDA and/or other 


regulatory bodies. Gotham City Research intends to publicly release these original reports in the future. 


In the interim and for the purposes of this report, we provide summaries of the data originating from the 


lab reports, and we use pseudonyms when referring to products, flavors, sachets, and/or lot numbers. 


Why All Optavia Fuelings Should Be Tested for Contaminants – Gotham City Research believes all 


“Optavia Fuelings” marketed by the company should be independently tested for contaminants, as (I) The 


average Optavia fueling tested contain concerning levels of contaminants (II) “Optavia Fuelings” are 


represented as being “nutritionally equivalent and substitutable” by the company, and (II) these Fuelings 


are marketed by the company as part of its flagship Optavia 5 in 1 plan diet, (where its customers are 


required to consume 5 of Optavia fuelings every day).  


Product Selection – We selected 5 products for testing. These 5 products include flavors that are 


prominently marketed. We believe them to be representative of consumer taste and spending patterns.  


About The Laboratory – The lab we selected to conduct product testing is described as the “world leader 


in food, environment and pharmaceutical products testing.” The specific unit conducting the testing 


specializes in “Food, Specialty/Investigative, and Environmental Analyses.” 


Testing Methodology – The testing method used by the lab: AOAC 2013.06.  The method is applicable to 


the determination of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb in a variety of foods by pressure digestion and Inductively Coupled 


Plasma/ Mass Spectrometry.  The AOAC method is developed by AOAC International, a globally recognized 


501(c)(3), independent, third party, not-for-profit association and voluntary consensus standards 


developing organization founded in 1884. 


Representations and Certifications – All quality control samples and checks were within acceptance limits 


unless otherwise indicated. Test results pertain only to those items tested. All samples were in good 


condition when received by the laboratory unless otherwise noted. All LOD/LOQs are adjusted to reflect 


dilutions. 


The lab is ISO/IEC-17025:2005 accredited by the American Associate For Laboratory Accreditation. ISO 


stands for:  International Organization for Standardization. The specific standard being referenced: 


ISO/IEC 17025 enables laboratories to demonstrate that they operate competently and generate valid 


results, thereby promoting confidence in their work both nationally and around the world.

a 
















































































GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS: 


• 21% to 74% of Optavia products contain contaminants.  


• Optavia prices will decline, as prices are 2x-4x more 


expensive than peers’ products & programs. 


• Nearly all Optavia products are not manufactured by the 


company, contradicting claims otherwise.  


• MED will be required to add warning labels to its products. 


• MED’s Optavia products (its “Fuelings”) will require recalls 


and/or third-party testing.  


• Shares will decline 62%-86% the current prices.  


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OBSERVATIONS  


• 85% of Optavia samples tested by a leading lab exceeded 


the maximum allowable dose level for lead, per Prop. 65.  


• 23% of the Optavia samples tested exceeded FDA 


maximum daily intake levels for lead. 


• The Optavia products we had tested contained higher 


levels of toxic metals than 93% of 133 best-selling protein 


powder products tested by the Clean Label Project. 


• The average Optavia products tested contain higher lead 


levels than all 283 everyday foods tested by the FDA. 


• A 2008 Lab test detected similar levels of lead in MED 


products, implying the problem has remained for 10 years. 


• Medifast R&D + capex spend as % of revenue is less than 


half of its peers, suggesting underinvestment. 


• A former FDA official informed us that toxic metals in 


foods is an issue of interest to the FDA, especially when 


the agency has specific cause for concern. 


• MED claims all its powders are made by the company, yet 


Optavia labels state “manufactured for Optavia” 


• Optavia products claim “Made in the USA”, yet we have 


evidence that the unqualified claim is false. 


• The # of FDA citations for Nellson LLC & Hearthside Food 


solution is very concerning. Both are believed to be among 


MED’s largest contract manufacturers. 


• Optavia diet ranked poorly in the 2018 US NEWS Best Diets 


Rankings (ranked only 29th of 40).

Introduction  


Gotham City Research began investigating mult-level marketing & weight loss companies in May 2018. In 
the past, there have been low-quality companies engaged in dubious practices in these industries. Shares 
of companies in these spaces –  including Medifast (“MED”) – have fared very well in recent years: 


  
 
We wondered about MED: is Medifast a quality business, even better than the likes of 
Facebook/Google/Amazon/Microsoft etc – which the MED stock price performance would suggest – or is 
it something else? Our interest in MED increased recently, after we found a few smoking guns suggesting 
that Medifast was something else – perhaps a Tile Shop or Lumber Liquidators, in their heydays.   
 
Medifast’s Optavia line of products, as a segment accounts for +89% of MED revenue. Significantly, we 
found that items in the Optavia product line contain undisclosed contaminants, some in excess of FDA & 
California Prop 65 levels if consumed as directed by the company, based on a leading laboratory’s testing.  
 
We also found that MED’s products had been tested for toxic metals ten years ago, and that the company 
succeeded in having these analytical reports removed from the website where they had been originally 
posted. The recent lab results lead us to believe MED has not fixed the problem in the last ten years. 
 
The recent lab test results suggests that Medifast’s Optavia-driven sales growth since 2016 has come at 
the cost of product safety and/or product quality. We see some significant similarities between Medifast, 
Lumber Liquidators (“LL”) and Tile Shop (“TTS”). For example: 


• Lead levels in the Optavia samples that were tested not only exceed FDA and Prop 65 levels if 
consumed as directed, they contain more lead than 93% of similar protein products, & 100% of 
everyday foods that the FDA has tested. 


• MED’s Core R&D + infrastructure spend is low relative to its peers and has been slashed in recent 
years. For example, net PP&E has declined by over 50%, and capex + R&D spend (as % of sales) is 
only half that of its peers. 


• MED claims that all its powder based products (42% of sales) are manufactured by the company, 
yet our investigation reveals Optavia powders are manufactured FOR Optavia, not BY Optavia. 


 
Lumber Liquidators and Tile Shop faced similar product safety and/or quality and sourcing concerns as 
described above for MED, some of which Gotham City Research exposed. We believe that these 
companies’ actions violated the trust of its customers, causing damage to their brands and reputations. 
Based on our research and analysis, we see similar concerns for MED. We believe its shares will decline 
62%-86% once the company accounts for the problems revealed in this report and elsewhere.

We Believe MED Cuts Corners to Inflate Revenue by 21%-66% 


Medifast/Optavia: a bona fide turnaround story or a repeat offender? 


On September 10, 2012, Medifast paid a $3.7 million civil penalty (23% of 2012 net income) to settle 


Federal Trade Commission charges that it made unsupported claims about its weight-loss program. The 


FTC barred MED from making any additional unsupported claims about users’ success in achieving or 


maintaining weight loss/control. Perhaps due to the negative publicity resulting from the company’s FTC 


violations, as well as being under closer scrutiny, revenue declined in subsequent years:  





An activist investor entered the scene in May 14, 2014. Soon after, the Company modified the composition 


of its Board of Directors, replacing its long-time CEO Michael Macdonald with Daniel Chard (formerly a 


senior sale executive of Nu Skin). MED rebranded to Optavia, focusing fully on the Multilevel marketing 


unit. Full year revenues bottomed in 2015, and MED’s revenues fully recovered to its 2013 highs by early 


this year. Perhaps seeing that the heavy lifting had been already completed, the activist investor began 


unloading its stake as revenues recovered, and fully exited their MED position by March of this year.  


New Brand, Same old tricks? Our Preliminary Suspicions 


While a bona fide turnaround appeared plausible, we began to question the prevailing narrative that 


Medifast was no longer the repeat offender it was widely believed to be, for the following reasons: 


• Price increases seemed to better explain the post 2015 revenue recovery vs volume growth: 





• We did not see corresponding increases in product quality or R&D/capex spend. Instead, we saw 


signs MED was shifting away from science/R&D and towards marketing/self-promotion. 


• Despite price increases and a marketing push emphasizing Optavia as a premium brand, the 


Optavia diet ranked poorly in the 2018 US NEWS Best Diets Rankings (ranked only 29th of 40). 


• We have not observed honest & consumer friendly practices, despite its rebranding to Optavia 


• Consumers have filed more complaints against Optavia just within the last 4 months, than they 


did against Medifast in over 24 months, according to the Better Business Bureau (“BBB”). 


Suspecting that the turnaround narrative might be off, we dug deeper. We discovered a few interesting 


nuggets buried in a 2010 defamation filing, where MED sued several of its critics. In it, MED vigorously 


denied the most central allegation – that MED was a pyramid scheme – made by the controversial Barry 


Minkow. Notably, however, the Company (I) did NOT dispute the accuracy of lab results indicating 


Medifast powders contained undisclosed toxic metals, and (II) did not claim that its products do not 


claim toxic metals.  Given they did not dismiss the results, we interpret that to mean they were accurate.

Page 8 of 69 
 


Did MED fix the toxic metals issue? Why we believe the company is cutting corners to inflate revenue 


Although Minkow was subsequently convicted for crimes unrelated to Medifast (we think deservedly), 


the MED critics from 2010 were not entirely wrong about everything: allegations regarding improper 


accounting and false/deceptive marketing have been validated by the SEC and FTC, respectively:  


Allegation Outcome 


Improper accounting SEC validated these claims. 


False/deceptive marketing FTC validated these claims. 


Illegal Pyramid Scheme Unknown. 


Products contain toxic metals Please read the remainder of this report. 





But what of the toxic metals issue? We engaged an independent, well known lab described as the “world 


leader in food, environment and pharmaceutical products testing” to test Medifast and Optavia products 


for toxic metals. Should MED’s turnaround be genuine, the lab test results would be favorable. A 


completely safe product would justify aggressive price increases and price premiums relative to peer 


products. The lab results, as well our subsequent due diligence as to possible causes, lead us to believe: 


• Optavia products contain undisclosed toxic metals: The Optavia product samples the lab tested 


contain lead exceeding regulatory standards. The samples also contain more lead than 93% of 


protein products tested by the Clean Label Project, and more lead than all 283 everyday foods 


that the FDA had tested for lead. 


• Aggressive price increases and significant premiums to peer products are not justified: Optavia 


products contain more toxic metals than peers’ products or everyday foods, MED underinvests 


relative to peers, yet their products are far more expensive. We expect Optavia prices to drop. 


• Supply chain is suspect and could explain the toxic metals: The company claims it 


manufactures all its powders and that its products are “Made in USA”, yet we uncovered 


evidence to the contrary, which might explain the presence of toxic metals. 


Optavia’s $200 million of sales growth since 2016 is suspect, as MED has violated the trust of customers  


By cutting corners, as described above, Gotham City Research believes that: 


• MED has violated its customers and coaches’ trust.  


• The turnaround narrative promoted since 2016, as well as the corresponding Optavia-fueled 


revenue growth ($200 million of Optavia-fueled revenue growth), are suspect. 


Consequently we believe 21%-66% of revenues are at risk. We derive the impact using two different 


methods. Our first method: 


• Optavia has been the primary driver of revenue growth since its launch in 2016, even as MED’s 


other reported segments have crumbled to oblivion. 


• Revenue growth since 2016 works out to $200 million (as revenue for 2016 was 274.5 million and 


revenue for 2018 is expected to be $475 million, the difference is $200 million).  


• The $200 million of revenue may not have occurred had Optavia customers and coaches known 


about the undisclosed toxic metals issue as shown in this report. 


• $200 million works out to 42% of 2018E revenue, right in the middle of the 21%-66% range.
Page 9 of 69 
 


 21%-66% of revenues are at risk, derived using our second method: 


• The company claims that 42% of product sales as of 2017, originate from selling powders: 





A company source said 40% of sales come from selling bars, so 82% of sales = powders + bar.  


• Optavia products are supposed to be all nutritionally equivalent & substitutable. We interpret this 


to mean that if one kind of fueling – say in the form of a bar – were to contain concernings levels 


of contaminants, then other types of fuelings – e.g. powder-based, soups, shakes, and puddings 


– could contain equal amounts of said contaminants.  


 
• 66% exposure - Out of the Optavia products tested for toxic metals, 85% tested as suspect. Given 


that Optavia fuelings are supposed to be “nutritionally equivalent and substituble”, let’s assume 


that most, but not all, fuelings (7 out 8) contain the same ingredients as the tested ones. Seeing 


that Optavia represents 89% of revenue (on TTM basis), 66% of revenue is at risk, in this scenario. 


• 21% exposure - MED claims that 42% of unit sales are from powders (we assume unit sales and $ 


sales are proportional). For this lower end estimate, we conservatively assume that only powders 


contain toxic metal levels of significance AND that only some flavors are risky (so we generously 


allow only 50% of powders to be of concern). This would imply that the other products are NOT 


nutritionally equivalent nor substitutable. So 50% of 42% powder sales, equals 21%. 


• Our estimated Optavia revenues at risk factor in no price reductions – Our above estimates 


assume constant pricing, i.e. no price reductions. Given that Optavia products have been priced 


at meaningful premiums to peers’ products - Herbalife, Slimfast, and just about all protein shake 


powders are less expensive – the risk of price reductions is very high.  


• Mechanisms that would facilitate a dramatic decline in sales – There are two important features 


of Optavia’s business model that would catalyze a precipitous and sudden decline in sales:  


o Multilevel marketing –An MLM, like leverage, amplifies financial results. In good times, 


this is great; but in bad times, an MLM collapses far faster and deeper than an equivalent 


non-MLM company’s sales would. The MLM feature would ampiify declines. 


o Pressure from other channels, such as Ebay – Optavia goods are sold in direct non-MLM 


online channels. Pricing in these channels, such as Ebay, could downwardly adjust prices 


faster than the other channels.  


• Operating leverage, margin pressures, and increased uses of cash – The Company spends less on 


R&D and capex as % of sales relative to its peers. We would expect their spending on these 


expenditures to converge to their peers’ levels, leading to a reduction in cash flow. In order to 


ensure lower levels of toxic metals in their products, we expect their contract manufacturers to 


raise prices.  We cover these considerations in the Valuation section in this report.

Cutting Corners to Inflate Financial Results: We Have Seen This Movie Before 


Tile Shop & Lumber Liquidators had once been the flavor du jour with the stock market, as MED is today. 


But once quality/safety + supply chain related concerns were raised, and the quality of growth of these 


companies had come into question – Both companies’ share prices declined. Neither have recovered 


since. Perhaps what worsened the underlying problems is that both companies denied the claims and/or 


attacked the messengers. In our opinion, MED is like Tile Shop and Lumber Liquidators, and its share price 


will suffer a similar fate for the reasons found in this report. We summarize the similarities we see: 


 Tile Shop Lumber Liquidators Medifast 


Product Quality/Safety Concerns YES YES YES 


Supply Chain Concerns YES YES YES 


Inflated Financial Results* YES YES YES 


Critics concerns validated YES YES We think over time 
*resulting from growth at the possible expense of product quality and safety  


While we believe that the facts and analyses presented in this report sufficiently support our opinions, we 


have additional evidence (covered in our Part II) that further reinforce our opinions.  The content 


contained in Part II will present topics not covered in this report. 


Gotham City Research believes that Medifast might be worse than TTS and LL for the following reasons: 


• While TTS and LL were alleged to sell goods containing toxic materials, their customers did not 


consume the products. On the other hand, Optavia’s main offering is a “5 in 1 plan” diet, where 


customers are expected to consume 5 of these toxic metal-laden servings per day! 


• MED’s customers – overweight and obese people – are particularly vulnerable to adverse health 


health consequences from overexposure to contaminants. 


• Optavia products are priced to perfection, selling at a 30%-400% premium to competitors’ 


goods.  


• Optavia products are sold through a multi-level marketing program (“MLM”). An MLM, like 


financial leverage, amplifies financial results. In good times, this is great; but in bad times, an 


MLM collapses far faster and deeper than an equivalent non-MLM company would. 





Gotham City Research believes third parties should and will independently test Optavia products 


Just as it happened with Tile Shop and Lumber Liquidators – we expect third parties – i.e., parties with no 


ties to Gotham City Research or Medifast – to conduct and/or commission their own tests. As they should. 


We believe their findings will corroborate – and possibly further – the findings in our report.

Undisclosed Toxic Metals and Why Optavia Is Worse Than Peers 


Medifast/Optavia: safe, effective, and helping customers incorporate healthy habits in their lives? 


Medifast/Optavia claim that their products are “safe and effective”, “contain all of the good stuff and 


none of the bad stuff”, and that the company “incorporates healthy habits in everything we do”: 








Gotham City Research believes that products containing undisclosed toxic metals – such as lead and 


cadmium – are not “safe and effective” and are what scientists would call “bad stuff” for the human body. 


Toxic metals – such as Lead and Cadmium – are dangerous for human consumption 


Lead and cadmium are dangerous, believed by scientists to cause serious health problems. Regarding lead: 


• "There is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe. Lead is a cumulative toxicant 


that affects multiple body systems " – World Health Organization (“WHO”) 


• “Lead is associated with premature death.  It is estimated that in 2016 lead exposure accounted 


for 540 000 deaths and 13.9 million years of healthy life lost worldwide" 


• "In 2016 lead exposure accounted for 540,000 deaths and 13.9 million years of healthy life lost 


worldwide due to long-term effects on health." Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation (IHME) 


• "During pregnancy, current or past exposure to lead by the mother could present a risk to the 


fetus." – Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)  


• In children, “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ” and “these effects of 


lead exposure cannot be corrected.” - Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) 


Lead presents dangers particularly relevant to the overweight and obese, Optavia’s target customer 


Overweight and obese people – Optavia’s target customer – are a high-risk population that tend to suffer 


from other physical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and other heart-related 


conditions. These problems may be caused or worsened by consuming products high in lead: 


• “People with prolonged exposure to lead may also be at risk for high blood pressure, heart 


disease, kidney disease, and reduced fertility.” – Center for Disease Control 


• “The study found that crash diets in the early phase caused fat to accumulate within the heart 


muscle.” – Radcliffe Department of Medicine
Page 12 of 69 
 


85% Optavia-branded product samples tested last month contain undisclosed toxic metals 


Last month, we purchased Medifast and Optavia branded products and had them sent to a laboratory for 


testing. Gotham City Research believes (I) Medifast/Optavia-branded products are unsafe and low quality 


relative to peer products and everyday foods, and (II) Optavia Fuelings require a recall and/or independent 


testing for the reasons mentioned below and in the remainder of this report: 


• Nearly all the Optavia samples tested contain lead exceeding the Proposition 65 maximum 


allowable dosage level by 10x on average. 22% of the samples exceeded the FDA maximum daily 


intake level for lead (a level the FDA is considering lowering). 


• Just one serving of an Optavia Fueling exceeds the Prop 65 lead limit by over 100%, based on the 


samples tested. These Optavia Fuelings are meant to be consumed 5 times per day.  


• The Optavia samples tested contain more lead on average than 93% of other high protein 


powders suggesting that Optavia products are of worse quality than peer products. 


• The Optavia samples tested contained more lead on average than all everyday foods tested by 


the FDA for lead (a basket of 283 everyday foods were tested for lead). 


• The Optavia samples contain similar levels of lead on average as Medifast samples that were 


tested in 2008, suggesting that the company has known about lead as a risk factor, and that it 


has failed to reduce lead to the lowest levels currently feasible.  


A single serving of an Optavia fueling would exceeds the maximum allowable daily limit levels by 2x 


California’s Prop 65 requires companies to provide a warning label regarding the reproductive risks of 


consuming lead, when daily intake exceeds 0.5 µg/day. In 6 out of 7 cases, as shown below, just one 


serving (for example, just one pouch of powder) of the tested Optavia products exceeds the Prop 65 levels 


yet there are no warning labels on the boxes or the pouches: 





These Optavia products are meant to be consumed 5x per day, according to their flagship diet plan  


The flagship Optavia 5 in 1 diet plan (Optavia’s only diet plan we’re aware of that makes specific claims 


about possible average weight loss), requires its customers to consume 5 Optavia “fuelings” per day (a 


fueling is a serving of “nutritionally equivalent and substitutable” products, including powders and bar). If 


its customers were to adhere to the plan, they would consume enough lead to exceed the Prop 65 


Maximum Allowable Dose Level by over 10x! Seeing that the company represents all its Optavia Fuelings 


as “nutritionally equivalent and substitutable”, we believe that the lead levels per the tests we had 


conducted are a fair proxy for the risk that the untested Optavia products may present. We do not know 


how often Medifast tests its own products, but our results suggest that it does not do so sufficiently, or, 


if it does, that it has chosen not to disclose those results.

23% of samples exceed FDA maximum daily intake level 6 µg per day 


Samples 2 & 6 contain enough lead such that consuming them as required by the 5 in 1 plan would exceed 


the FDA’s maximum daily intake level for lead, of 6 µg/day. Notably the FDA’s maximum level may be 


revised lower, just as other organizations, such as WHO, have already done. The table below shows how 


the FDA remains the only entity among those listed who has yet to lower maximum lead levels: 





According to a former FDA official, toxic metals in foods is an issue of interest to the FDA. He said that the 


FDA acts when the agency has specific cause for concern, and the levels of lead in the tested Optavia 


samples would raise questions for the FDA. 


Background: The FDA may lower the maximum daily intake level of 6 µg/day 


In 1993, the FDA established a maximum daily intake level (6 µg/day), known as the Provisional Tolerable 


Total Dietary Intake level (PTTDI) based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Level 


of Concern of 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (µg/dL). The PTTDI helps the FDA in assessing 


the risk of lead in food in various aspects of its regulatory mission such as in supporting enforcement 


actions, rulemaking and guidance development. At the time the FDA set the 6 µg/day level, the agency 


stated that its Provisional Level “may be reduced if additional research shows that even lower levels of 


lead cause adverse health effects.” In the last decade, new scientific information has become available 


with respect to neurotoxic effects of low levels of exposure to lead. This prompted the EPA to lower its air 


quality standard, the CDC to replace its Level of Concern with a reduced reference value level, and the 


Joint WHO and FAO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) to withdraw its Provisional Tolerable Level for 


lead. In the meantime, the FDA has been reviewing its provisional level.

Medifast/Optavia samples tested contain more lead than over 93% of peers tested, on average 


Among the Optavia products tested that contain lead (nearly all did), the Optavia samples contain more 


lead than 93% of 133 of America’s best-selling protein powders tested by the Clean Label Project in March 


2018. The Clean Label Project pulled over 130 of America’s best-selling protein powders in accordance 


with Nielson data, the Amazon.com best seller list, and supplemented that list with top sellers in the 


natural/organic retail channel and consumer favorites mentioned on fitness blogs and websites.

The worst Optavia sample contained more lead than nearly all 133 peer products:   





Why the comparison between Optavia fuelings and 133 protein shakes is appropriate and concerning 


So why are we comparing Optavia fuelings to protein shakes? Earlier this year, The Clean Project 


completed a study of 134 protein powder products. Clean Label Project had the top-selling protein powder 


products – animal-based, whey, and plant-based – tested and reviewed by a third party analytical 


chemistry laboratory for industrial and environmental contaminants and nutritional superiority elements 


like antioxidant activity. The study showed that many of the top-selling powders and drinks may contain 


concerning levels of heavy metals. 


The following reasons lead us to believe the comparison is appropriate: 


• Many Optavia fuelings are high enough in protein (as far as % of calories for protein is concerned) 


to be deemed what the FDA calls “protein products”.  


• Protein powders have been known to contain high levels of toxic metals (even before the results 


of the Clean Label Study were released in March 2018), particularly those containing plant-based 


proteins. Some Optavia products also contain plant-based proteins. 


The following reasons lead us to believe the comparison is concerning: 


• Optavia samples tested contain more lead than most of these already at-risk products.  


• Many Optavia customers are required to consume 5 servings per day; we suspect that the average 


consumers of the protein products tested under the Clean Label Project do not consumer 


anywhere near 5 servings of those products per day. 


• The Optavia samples contain less % of calories from protein than the protein powders tested by 


the Clean Label Study, on average, raising concerns as to where the lead is originating from. 


• Optavia is represented as a high-quality product and is priced far higher on a per serving and per 


calorie basis, than protein powders (and even all diet shakes we could find).

Clean Label Project Protein Powders Optavia


Optavia Sample #6
Page 15 of 69 
 


Optavia samples contain more lead on average than all 283 everyday foods tested by the FDA  


The Optavia products that were tested contain more lead on average than all 283 everyday foods that 


were tested by the FDA in its 2013 study (updated 2017), titled FDA Total Diet Study – Element Results 


Summary Statistics. The below table shows the top 10 foods that tested highest for average lead (see 


column Mean (mg/kg)): 


 
  
Shrimp was the only everyday food sample that tested higher than the Optavia samples for lead, but only 


when comparing the worst shrimp sample (the “max” sample) against the worst Optavia sample; when 


comparing the Optavia sample average lead content against average and median results for all 283 foods, 


Optavia is by far the worst. 


MED failure to reduce lead levels from a 2008 tests suggests disregard for food quality + safety 


Every company makes mistakes. The question is: why are these lab results eerily similar to lab results from 
over 10 years ago? The below table shows the results from that lab test from 10 years ago: 
 





• the average lead levels per serving, ~1 ug per day, are approximately equal to the average lead 


levels per serving found in the Optavia products we had tested for lead. 


• Medifast sued those critics for defamation. 


• In the complaint filing, the Company did not dispute the accuracy of the lab’s lead results, though 


it vigorously disputed the accuracy of most allegations found in the critics’ reports. It is a fair 


inference that MED believed the 2009 lead tests were correct. 


• Michael MacDonald, MED’s current non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, was 


previously CEO of MED. He + family members have been involved with MED for many years. 


• Given Macdonald’s involvement with MED, we believe the company has known about lead issues 


for a long time and have failed to disclose or correct the problem.  


There is no shame in making mistakes…only in not correcting them.

Optavia is a very bad deal compared to other products, given these quality and safety concerns 


Given the issues we’ve discussed thus far in this report, one might expect Optavia to be a low-cost product 


line, meant to appeal to budget-conscious consumers. Based on our examination of prices of similar goods 


and diet programs, Optavia actually looks like a very bad deal: competing meal replacement powders cost 


between 40%-80% less than Optavia’s: 


 
Optavia powders are notably more expensive than even Herbalife’s, a company that has been accused of 


ripping off customers and selling overpriced goods. Based on our pricing studies, Herbalife is between 


38%-49% less expensive than Optavia! The pricing differences are even more dramatic when compared 


against SlimFast products, as shown in the table above. 


Even when comparing Optavia to a slightly different program, Nutrisystem, Optavia is more expensive: 





While the protein powders tested by the Clean Label Project may not be used by its customers primarily 


for weight loss purposes, these powders contain as many (if not more) calories from protein as Optavia 


products do. Therefore, these protein powders could be just as effective at helping its users lose weight 


via ketosis, as Optavia claims its diets do. And these products are notably less expensive – between 50%-


84% less expensive – than Optavia’s: 





Competing meal replacement powders cost as much as 85% less per calorie compared to Optavia Select powders

MED does not provide a warning label about lead or its dangers as we believe is required per Prop 65 


We have not seen, nor are aware of, any of Medifast or Optavia-branded products containing a warning 


label regarding the dangers of lead, as is required for companies selling products in California containing 


lead exceeding the maximum allowable dosage levels. These products’ labels should say something like: 





Not only does MED not provide a warning label about lead on its packaging, we also see no mention of 


lead in the Optavia/Medifast websites. MED makes no representations or assurances about its lead 


products’ content.  


Unlike Herbalife, one of Medifast’s Competitors, MED provides no assurances about lead levels 


On the other hand, Herbalife makes the following representations about lead in its products: 





Why we believe MED is in violation of Prop 65, Faces Liability, & its Products will Require Warning Labels 


Proposition 65, a.k.a. Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 





Gotham City Research believes Medifast/Optavia is in violation of Proposition 65, and will face 


consumer and legal scrutiny for the following reasons:  


• Lab test results for lead in 2018 exceed the maximum allowable dosage levels (on a per serving, 


as well as on per day consumed basis), per Prop 65, as discussed earlier in this section. 


• Optavia/Medifast products do not carry the required warning label. 


• This is not a first time offense for MED, as Lab test results from 2008 detected lead. 


• Gotham City Research believes Optavia/Medifast do not qualify for any of the exemptions that 


would relieve the company from carrying the warning labels. 


In the appendix, we explain why Gotham City Research believes Optavia does not qualify for the 


exemptions.

Possible Causes Part I: Supply Chain Is Suspect 


Suspect supply chains can compromise product safety and quality 


Why do the tested Optavia fuelings contain undisclosed toxic metals? Particularly, why do they contain 


higher levels of toxic metals than nearly all similar high product products, everyday foods, and against 


regulatory standards? And how is this all possible when Optavia powder prices are 2x-5x more expensive? 


These are significant anomalies, in our view.  


The answer may lie in a suspect supply chain. Companies do not always disclose their products’ origins (or 


are deceptive about their origins), especially if there are known quality concerns. This was exactly the case 


with Tile Shop, where one of its main suppliers was an undisclosed related party based in China.  


In other cases, underinvestment or insufficient spending on quality control leads to problems. We saw 


this problem with a web hosting company called Endurance International Group. Endurance had spent far 


less on core intrastructure spending versus its primary competitor, Godaddy. Consequently, its customers 


experienced an unusually frequent number of service outages versus Godaddy customers.  


In the case of MED, we have reason to believe that both underinvestment AND insufficient spending on 


quality control may have contributed to the problems with MED products. In this section, we focus on 


why we believe the supply chain is suspect. 


The Company claims that 100% of powders are made in the Owings Mills, MD Facility 


According to the most recent 10K filing, MED manufactures all powder-based products at its 


manufacturing facility located in Owings Mills, MD and subcontract the production of all other products: 





This claim (as well as the claim powders = 42%-44% of sales) has been remarkably consistent over time: 








Employees & “coaches” we spoke with echo this claim. Summarized below are some of their comments:

Employees and Coaches either echo or overstate this claim:


Optavia Coach Support Rep The Optavia packets say "Manufactured for Optavia".  Are you saying they are both made at the same facility? "yes, yes"


Are all Optavia products made in-house or are any of them made by 3rd parties?  "No, none of them are made by 3rd parties"


So all of them are made at the Maryland, is it Owings Mills?  "At the Owings Mills location, yes"


Optavia Coach #1 I'd like to know where the products are made, especially the Optavia chocolate and vanilla shake mixes.  "all our products are made in the US!  Baltimore, Maryland"


Optavia Coach #2 Who makes the shakes and other foods for this diet?  "the products are made in our facility in Maryland"


Nutrition Support Supervisor "all of our powdered products come from Medifast"


"correct, we make none of the bars"


"the crunchy stuff is made elsewhere"


Nutrition Support Rep #1 "all of the products are manufactured in our manufacturing facility in Owings Mills"


"the ingredients might not be...but they are all brought to the manufacturing facility in Owings Mills to make the product, there"


Nutrition Support Rep #2 "we have a location in Owings Mills, they do that"


"we make the majority of our dried products.  Most of our bars are made through our 3rd party manufacturing company"
Page 19 of 69 
 


Medifast-branded powder box labels are consistent with the “100% of powders are made in the Owings 


Mills, MD Facility” claim as well: 





In case there’s any confusion: Jason Pharmaceuticals is a fully owned subsidiary of Medifast. That entity 


name is often found in regulatory matters (see the FTC settlement from 2012, as an example). MED = 


Jason Pharmaceuticals, Jason Pharmaceuticals = MED. 


More than 40% of Medifast/Optavia’s supply may not be as the company represents 


Gotham City Research believes 40%-82% of the company’s supply chain is suspect, and that this explains 


– in part – the undisclosed toxic metals. We specifically believe that:  


• Optavia-branded powders are made in an undisclosed location and/or made by a third party, 


contrary to MED’s claim it manufacturers all its powders (42% of revenue) in Maryland. 


• “Made in China” may be more substantively correct for some (possibly all) Medifast and Optavia 


branded powders and bars, contrary to the unqualified “Made in USA” found on their labels. 


Our investigation reveals the following: 


• MED’s raw materials warehouse contained and/or contains Optavia branded powders that 


appeared to be shipped from elsewhere.  


• The box labels on Optavia branded powders state “manufactured for Optavia”, which is the 


language that the FDA states should be used when the firm listed on the label is not the 


manufacturer.  


• Yet, Medifast branded powder labels state that MED is the manufacturer. 


• Jason Pharmaceuticals Inc (Texas) is listed as a foreign importer of foods according to the FDA, 


yet MED makes no mention of any manufacturing and warehousing activity outside of Maryland. 


• Nellson Nutraceuticals, believed to be one of MED’s largest contract manufacturers, may be 


manufacturing Optavia-branded powders for MED out of Utah. 


• Nellson is suspect because the FDA has cited it multiple times and because Nellson appears to 


source ingredients from China based on shipping records we reviewed. 


• The unqualified “Made in the USA” claim may require modification, even removal in at least 


some – possibly all – Optavia/Medifast products.

Optavia Powder Products in the Arbutus Warehouse Indicate They were Not Made in Owings Mills  


In August, we commenced an investigation into all MED’s facilities, including the raw materials warehouse 


as described in the company’s 10K filing: 





Our investigation into the raw materials warehouse reveals: 


• The raw materials warehouse contains Optavia powder tubs that look like finished goods, in 


contrast with all the other goods that look like raw ingredients in the warehouse.  


• The Optavia tubs look like they were manufactured FOR the company…not BY the company. 


• The Optavia tubs look like they were shipped from elsewhere. 


• There are no manufacturing activities nor any manufacturing or packaging equipment in the 


warehouse that might explain why finished goods would otherwise be found in this facility. 


• The only other major equipment found in the facility are forklifts used to move boxes. 


If the Company claims to manufacturer all its powdered products, why would it store finished good 


Optavia powdered products in its raw materials warehouse in Arbutus? 





Optavia powder box labels indicate “Manufactured for Optavia” NOT Manufactured by Optavia 


The simplest explanation might be the obvious one: the Optavia powder pouches & boxes claim 


‘manufactured for Optavia’, NOT manufactured BY Optavia:
Page 21 of 69 
 


In contrast, the Medifast powder label does not contain similar “Manufactured for Medifast” language; 


instead, its label conforms to FDA standards for indicating that the company itself is the manufacturer: 








‘Manufactured for’ Indicates the firm listed on label is not the manufacturer: the FDA 


We checked that language –  “manufactured for Optavia” – with the FDA and found that the FDA offers 


regulation and guidance on labeling, specifically regarding that ‘manufactured for’ phrase:
Page 22 of 69 
 


All other Optavia-branded products (non powders) contain that ‘manufactured for Optavia’ language 


found on the Optavia powder labels. This representation found on non powder Optavia product labels 


seem compliant with the FDA guidance and regulations, AND consistent with Medifast/Optavia’s 


representation that all products that are not powder-based are manufactured by third parties:
Page 23 of 69 
 


Our due diligence reveals that Nellson LLC manufactures bars for MED, and possibly powders as well 
 
Nellson LLC (also known as Nellson Nutraceuticals) describes itself as “the only full-service bar and powder 
nutrition provider.” Nellson has powder operations in Utah, and significantly expanded these operations 
on December 4, 2017, by acquiring Genysis (also based in Utah), a manufacturer of functional powders.  
 
Here is what our investigation reveals about Nellson and its relationship with Medifast/Optavia: 
 


• Nellson Nutraceuticals made or makes bars for Medifast/Optavia. Bars account for 40% of MED 
revenue, making Nellson one of MED’s most important contract manufacturers. 


• Medifast/Optavia formulated plans to shift powder product manufacturing to Nellson, under 
certain situations. 


• Medifast under the Jason Pharmaceuticals entity, may be conducting undisclosed warehousing 
and/or manufacturing activities in Utah and Texas as discussed below.  


 
If MED is secretly using Nellson to make bars, the following adverse facts would explain why the 
Medifast would hide this information from the public: 
 


• Nellson’s safety and quality control record is concerning, as evidenced by the total # of FDA 
citations shown in the below table (Genysis and NBTY are fully owned subsidiaries of Nellson). 


• Nellson products use a significant portion of its ingredients from China, per shipping records. 
 





• Nellson filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008. 


• Nellson is currently owned by a private equity firm and appears to be acquisitive (i.e. it’s 
engaging in a roll-up strategy). In our experience, private equity owned, acquisitive companies 
often face financial pressures that can compromise product quality and safety. 


• Nellson represents the ability to pack powdered products in bulk tubs, bags, and sachets. Given 
the parameters shown below, they would fit the specifications of Optavia sachets. 


 
• Senior executives of Genysis don’t seem to have supply chain or manufacturing backgrounds 


prior to their tenure at Genysis:

Unreported Manufacturing + Warehouse Activities – MED’s Utah Operations May be the Missing Link  


if all powders are NOT manufactured by Medifast at its Owings Mills, MD manufacturing facility, where 


are they manufactured? Who manufactures them? Nellson? Utah may hold the answers. Here is what we 


know so far about the ties between MED + Utah:  


▪ Nellson makes bars for MED. Nellson may make powders for MED. 


▪ Nellson’s powder activities are based in Utah and were expanded with the Gensys Acquisition. 


▪ MED’s CEO Daniel Chard is from and (we believe) currently based in Utah. 


Jason Pharmaceuticals Pursues Manufacturing Activities in Utah, according to Utah Corporate Filings  


Jason Pharmaceuticals is a fully owned subsidiary of Medifast. That entity name is often found in 


regulatory matters (see the FTC settlement from 2012, as an example). So just to avoid any conclusion: 


MED = Jason Pharmaceuticals, Jason Pharmaceuticals = MED. According to a search for ‘Jason 


Pharmaceuticals’ in Utah corporate filings, Jason Pharmaceuticals’ stated business purposes was 


“manufacturing and selling of weight loss and management products”, as of September 2013: 





In a Utah filing dated 12/07/2016, Jason Pharmaceuticals appears to have changed its NAICS – Business 


Purpose to “Other Food Manufacturing”:
Page 25 of 69 
 


How MED’s activities in Utah and Texas might explain the supply chain irregularities 


The following facts might explain how MED has either (I) secret and undisclosed manufacturing activities 


outside of Maryland, or (II) Nellson or another third party manufacturers powder based products for MED: 


▪ Utah records suggest MED is conducting manufacturing activities in Utah. 


▪ FDA records suggest MED is conducting dry goods warehousing activities in Texas. 


▪ FDA records also suggest that MED is specifically importing foreign-sourced ingredients. 


▪ MED has not disclosed either of these activities as occurring outside of Maryland, in its SEC filings. 


▪ MED has disclosed distribution center and call center activities in Texas. 


▪ Given Texas and Utah are in (relatively) proximity (especially relative to Maryland!), our 


hypotheses would be plausible. 


Jason Pharmaceuticals, Texas is listed as an importer of foreign food 


The FDA has released a list of importers that import food from foreign suppliers: 








Jason Pharmaceuticals, MD, and Jason Pharmaceuticals, TX are both listed as importers:

Optavia and Medifast branded products claim “Made in the USA”  


Optavia and Medifast branded products sport unqualified “Made in the USA” on their labels:
Page 28 of 69 
 


Why Gotham City Research Believes MED Should Qualify its Made in the USA Claim (At Best)  


The Federal Trade Commission, in its Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims said: 


  
IV. SUBSTANTIATING U.S. ORIGIN CLAIMS: THE "ALL OR VIRTUALLY ALL" STANDARD 
Based on its review of the traditional use of the term "Made in USA," and the record as a whole, the 
Commission concludes that consumers are likely to understand an unqualified U.S. origin claim to 
mean that the advertised product is "all or virtually all" made in the United States. Therefore, when 
a marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is "Made in USA," it should, at the time the 
representation is made, possess and rely upon a reasonable basis that the product is in fact all or 
virtually all made in the United States.(12), (13) 
A product that is all or virtually all made in the United States will ordinarily be one in which all 
significant parts(14) and processing that go into the product are of U.S. origin. In other words, where 
a product is labeled or otherwise advertised with an unqualified "Made in USA" claim, it should 
contain only a de minimis, or negligible, amount of foreign content. 
  
https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1997/12/enforcement-policy-statement-us-origin-claims 





Based on our review of some of the MED products, we believe the company will at the very least modify 


its labels. MED may have to labels the way Herbalife does ("Made in the USA with imported ingredients"):  








https://edge.myherbalife.com/download/web/prodsku-label/locale_en_us/sku_3092/3092_label.pdf 
 


In addition to scrutiny from the FTC, MED may face scrutiny and liability from the following: 


• State-level requirements and restrictions against deceptive trade practices. It would not take 


much for an attorney general to probe the toxic metals issue.  


• Private party litigation and an active plaintiffs’ class-action bar. 





Gotham City Research believes in the above stated opinions for the following reasons: 


• At least 7 Optavia fuelings we’ve documented contain calcium caseinate as a main ingredient. 


• Medifast imports calcium caseinate from Denmark-based Arla Foods, according to shipping 


records. 


• Yet all 7 of those fuelings containing calcium caseinate as a main ingredient unreservedly claim 


“Made In the USA” on their product labels.

Based on shipping records, Medifast imports calcium caseinate from Denmark’s Arla Foods…and in 


significant amounts, as gauged by the weight in Kilograms: 








 
The following products contain calcium caseinate; their labels unreservedly claim “Made in the USA”:

We believe some of Medifast/Optavia’s products – specifically its bars – may be more Made in China 


than Made in the USA, as gauged by origin of ingredients, for the following reasons: 


• Nellson LLC is believed to manufacture bars for MED and may make powders for MED (as 


discussed previously). 


• Bars account for 40% of MED revenue, making Nellson one of MED’s most important contract 
manufacturers (we think top 2 largest among MED’s contract manufacturers). 


• Nellson products are mostly made in China, at least if the proportion of supplies from China is a 
fair proxy for the proportion of Chinese vs other origins. 
 


 
 
We see two scenarios, both of which are concerning from a product safety + quality perspective, and 
both would explain a lot: 


• Nellson is a significant manufacturer of Medifast/Optavia’s powders and bars. Given the large 
number of FDA citations that Nellons and its subsidiaries have received, this is concerning. 


• Nellson-made goods are composed mostly of China sourced ingredients and then mixed in the 
USA. 


 
Why Does Medifast Unreservedly Claim Made in the USA? 


Here are the reasons Medifast might unreservedly claimed “Made in the USA” on its products: 


• US government officials may view the company more favorably, if they believe that MED’s 


“Made in the USA” representations are true. 


• Prospective customers, with a preference for American made goods, might be enticed to 


purchase their products; existing customers might remain more loyal than they otherwise would 


if they knew the products’ ingredients were largely sourced from the United States. 


• Consumers might perceive “Made in the USA” as a premium trait, and therefore be less 


skeptical about Optavia’s aggressive pricing premiums versus its peers.

Possible causes Part II: Underinvestment 


Underinvestment may also explain product safety and quality concerns 


Other than a suspect supply chain, which would largely explain product safety and quality issues at 


Medifast, why else would Optavia fuelings contain undisclosed toxic metals? Particularly, why would they 


contain undisclosed toxic metals in excess of most similar goods, everyday foods, and regulatory 


standards? These are significant anomalies, in our view.  


We have observed that underinvestment or insufficient spending on quality control can lead to problems. 


We saw this problem with a web hosting company called Endurance International Group. Endurance had 


spent far less on core intrastructure spending versus its primary competitor, Godaddy. Consequently, its 


customers experienced an unusually frequent number of service outages versus Godaddy customers. 


Gotham City Research believes that other than the supply chain issues discussed, underinvestment and a 


cultural shift away from R&D and towards marketing contribute to quality and safety concerns. The 


following support our opinions: 


• Property, plant and equipment have declined more than 50% over the last 5 years. 


• MED’s Capex + R&D spend as a percentage of revenue is less than half that of its peers. 


• Disclosed intellectual property assets on the balance sheet have declined to zero. 


• Concurrently, stock buy backs and dividends have increased 3x. 


• Mention of the word ‘patent’ has disappeared from MED 10K filings. 





Property, plant and equipment declined over 50% from $40 million to $18-$19 million: 


The company’s property, plant, and equipment (net) balance has declined by over 50%, from over $40 


million as of 2012, to $18 million of June 2018: 








Herbalife and other peers spend over 2x more on capital expenditures and research & development: 


Herbalife has been criticized for underspending on R&D and capex, but it spent twice as much on R&D 


and capex as % revenue than MED did, per our estimates. The same goes for the rest of the peers:

Page 32 of 69 
 


Underinvestment and stock buybacks compromise product quality and safety 


Instead of significantly boosting capex or R&D spending, which might improve product safety and 


quality, MED has chosen instead to dramatically boost stock buybacks and dividends:   





Intellectual property assets have disappeared from the MED Balance Sheet 


As of 2012, MED had intellectual property assets on its balance sheet: 





The value declined to zero by 2013. By 2016/2017 that asset category disappeared altogether: 





Trademarks and Intangibles in 2002 used to provide higher balances and disclosures: 
  


 
Mention of the word ‘patent’ has declined from 10 mentions in the 2002 10K to zero recently:

Allergens, Cadmium, and Other Safety Concerns 


Safety Concerns are Not Limited to Lead 


Gotham City Research believes that the product quality and safety concerns are not limited to the lead 


related findings, covered earlier in this report. Here are other causes for concern: 


• Optavia products that were tested contain cadmium, in levels that exceed most other peer 


products and nearly all everyday foods tested by the FDA. 


• Optavia products may contain more exposure to allergens then disclosed in its labeling. 


• The FDA citation record for two companies believed to MED’s largest contract manufacturers is 


very concerning. 


• Optavia does not recommend eating fruit, as part of its 5 for 1 plan. 


• Cigarette smokers are exposed to toxic metals in cigarettes and may be more vulnerable to 


consuming Optavia products. 


Optavia and Medifast Products and Allergens: the Coverup is Worse Than the Crime 


Medifast/Optavia warned its top performing sales force (those who generate revenue) that the Company 


has all major allergens in its manufacturing facility in Owens Mills, Maryland:  





Archived here: https://web.archive.org/web/20180815034449/http://www.optaviaevents.com/new-


fibc-summit-august.html 


In fact, the GMP Agreement the company asks guests to sign before allowing them to tour the 


manufacturing facility, states: 


• we handle all major allergens (except shellfish)  


• IF YOU HAVE ANY TYPE OF FOOD ALLERGY DO NOT ENTER THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY 





MED does not provide the same warnings to its customers as it does to its revenue generators 


Medifast/Optavia’s allergen disclosures do not afford customers the same degree of caution as the 


company has to its top producers; the company makes no such representations that its products are 


manufactured in a facility that contains allergens, in either the product labels or its websites, based on 


our examination. The inconsistent disclosure is not consistent with industry norms.

For example, we found that the following companies provide advisory disclosures when there is a risk that 


allergens may be present during the manufacturing process: 


• Herbalife voluntarily discloses when a product it sells was produced in a facility that processes 


nuts or gluten or milk http://herbalife.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/684/~/eight-


major-allergens 


• Nutrisystem states that those with peanut allergies, mild or severe, cannot be on its program 


https://leaf.nutrisystem.com/faqs/diet-food-nutrition-and-science/nutrisystem-diet-food-


peanuts/ 


• Nutrisystem also lists peanut, soy, and latex allergies as reasons not to use its program 


https://www.nutrisystem.com/pdf/Information_for_your_doctor.pdf 


If Optavia and Medifast branded products are manufactured in the same Owings Mills manufacturing 


facility where visiting salespeople are explicitly instructed not to enter (if they have any allergies) then: 


Why doesn’t the company provide its customers with the same degree of courtesy as it does to its visiting 


salespeople?   


Optavia’s allergen disclosure practices may be legally permissible, but these practices don’t seem 


consistent with the practices of a premium, safety-first brand. 





Cadmium levels tested exceed the maximum allowable dosage level by 178% 


If a customer were to adhere to the 5 in one 1 Plan, and consume Optavia products that contain the same 


amount of cadmium as those that were tested, their daily consumption would exceed the maximum 


allowable dosage level of 4.1 µg/day by 178%, on average: 








We believe Medifast should be providing a warning level regarding cadmium, particularly in this case 


because it sells the products as part of diet plan, and whose adherence would lead to consumption of 


cadmium exceeding the Prop 65 levels.

The Optavia product samples contained more Cadmium than most tested protein products  


The Optavia samples that were tested contain more cadmium than 76% of comparable protein products 


as tested by the Clean Label Project. The below graph shows the worst Optavia sample, which contains 


more cadmium than 91% of its peers: 





The Optavia samples contain more Cadmium than nearly all foods tested by the FDA for Cadmium 


The Optavia products tested contain more cadmium than 97% of everyday foods that were tested by the 


FDA for cadmium. While the relative ranking is not as bad as it was for lead – as the Optavia products 


contained more lead than ALL the everyday foods – Optavia’s ranking is still very poor:

Optavia and its Unhealthy Habits for Life  


Questions: Is it true that fruit is not allowed under the Optavia diet? 


Answer: One could infer this based upon the guidelines of MED’s 5 and 1 weight loss plan.  On the 5 
and 1 plan, no fruits are listed on the approved snack list (note sugar free appears to be emphasized).  No 


fruits would be consumed in the lean and green meal either since this consists of a protein and veggie dish.

Questions: Given that cigarettes contain high levels of toxic metals, does Optavia provide any warning 


for smokers?   


Answer: The Company does not address the danger of simultaneously smoking and adhering to the 


Optavia 5 in 1 plan, from a toxic metals perspective. It provides a generic answer about smoking instead:

Valuation: shares are worth no more than $79 per share 


The art of valuation is only as good as the assumptions behind one’s calculations. As a result, we are not 


dogmatic about artificial precision. We do strongly believe, however, that investors’ interests are served 


best when they seek to understand the quality of the company, its true business model, and value drivers. 


Because we believe MED sales are inflated for the concerns discussed in this report, we believe product 


quality and safety concerns will be the primary drivers of MED’s long-term value. Other considerations – 


such as pyramid scheme allegations or their ambitions in China – will pale in comparison. 


As a result, Gotham City Research believes MED shares face significant downside. We believe shares are 


worth no more than $79 per share and arrive at a price target between $30 and $79 per share. 


Our price target may seem low at first glance, yet this would place shares just where they were trading 6 


months ago – the same price levels that the activist investor completely sold their stake. 


Valuation Method and Assumptions: scenarios-based approach 


We don’t believe that Medifast/Optavia is a true “growth at any price” company, as it has been perceived 


to be in recent quarters, for the following reasons: 


• The Weight loss industry is an old and cyclical industry, driven by fads and the flavor du jour 


(anyone remember the Atkins Diet? Or South Beach?). Easy come, easy go. 


• The Weight loss industry is highly competitive. We see some very capable operators in the space, 


as well as some very compelling alternative diet solutions. 


• MLMs exhibit low quality of earnings, like highly levered companies, and investors tend to 


(astutely) pay below-market multiples for businesses exhibiting such unstable earnings. 


Our weighted average price target of $79 is arrived at by a 3-scenario approach: 





• Bull scenario – Consumers and coaches disregard product quality and safety concerns and 


earnings rise year-over-year in 2019. A 30x multiple, nearly double that of S&P 500’s multiple, 


seems appropriate. We assign a 15% probability to this scenario. 


• Base scenario – Some Optavia customers and coaches show concern for product safety and 


quality issues. Sales plateau, but do not crash. Due to MED’s MLM feature and margin pressures 


resulting from the concerns (e.g. increased spending on capex and R&D, simply to conform to 


industry levels) earnings decline despite flat (or slightly up/down) sales. Consequently, MED’s P/E 


multiple normalizes to the market multiple of 17x. We assign a 70% probability here. 





EPS Multiple Probability Price


Bull Scenario $6.00 30.0x 15% $180


Base Scenario $4.00 17.0x 70% $68


Boom Bust Scenario $2.00 15.0x 15% $30


Weighted average price target: $79


Price, as of 9/19/2018: $208


Downside risk : -62%


Downside risk : -86%
Page 41 of 69 
 


3-scenario approach (continued): 


• Boom bust scenario – In this scenario, consumers and coaches show concern for product safety 


and quality issues. Other problems related to product safety and concern not addressed in this 


report arise. Sales earnings decline modestly to 2017 levels. We conservatively apply a 15x P/E 


multiple in this case. 





Additional Valuation Considerations – Legal/Regulatory, and China 


Gotham City Research believes there are two important considerations – wild card – that may prove to 


be important value drivers for the stock in coming quarters: 


• Legal/Regulatory – Our 3-scenarios approach does not incorporate any product liability, personal 


injury lawsuits, regulatory action, or increased costs resulting from additional quality assurance 


requirements (beyond normalization of MED’s R&D + capex spending to peers’ levels).  





Based on the company’s and its peers’ history with various regulators, significant financial 


penalties, private litigation settlements, legal costs, and restrictions on marketing activities, are 


very credible and realistic outcomes. In our opinion, these will happen as the result of the 


company’s actions, especially given that MED has been given many 2nd chances to clean up its act. 





Out of an abundance of caution, however, we are short MED shares assuming none of these 


transpire. Those adverse scenarios would lower the range of our estimates for intrinsic value. 





• China Plans – The company has announced that it intends to expand into China next year. The 


financial markets have expressed enthusiasm into these plans, as evidenced by MED’s stock price 


this year. MED may or may not gain traction in China: no one knows. Here is why we are skeptical: 


▪ The financial markets may have a short attention span, but MED’s historical attempts to 


penetrate this market have all failed to persist. 


▪ Chinese officials and consumers are hyper sensitive to product quality and safety 


concerns. Chinese companies and executives have faced harsh criminal penalties for food 


quality and safety related issues.  


▪ If Chinese officials and consumers were to learn that Optavia prices are 2x-5x that of 


similar American nutrition products/programs, they may not be receptive to Optavia 


products, in light of safety and product quality concerns. 


▪ MED CEO Daniel Chard was formerly with Nu Skin as a sales executive. During his last few 


years at Nu Skin, Nu Skin’s Chinese revenues grew rapidly, and then subsequently 


collapsed. Additonally, Nu Skin in China faced regulatory scrutiny.  Though financial 


markets currently view Chard’s Nu Skin experience as a positive with respect to China, 


Chinese officials and consumers may see it differently.  


▪ Other than Chard, we are not aware of any MED veterans with significant (or any) 


experience expanding overseas. The regional consumer taste/cultural aspects, supply 


chain expertise, and regulatory/legal knowhow outside of the US are not evident to us.

Appendix A: We Believe the Prop 65 Exemptions Do Not Apply  


This section explains why we believe MED does not qualify for any of the Proposition 65 exemptions. 


"Naturally occurring" AND reduced to the "lowest level currently feasible" 


California’s Attorney General website lists exemptions to Proposition 65. It says the following regarding 


“Exposures to listed chemicals that occur naturally in foods”: 





In other words, if lead exceeding the Prop 65 levels were detected in a company’s product, the business 


would have to prove that the lead is naturally occurring. The burden of proof is on the business. 


Furthermore, “naturally occurring” is not a sufficient condition. The business must also prove that it has 


reduced lead to the “lowest level currently feasible.” 


We find similar language and criterion within the full text of § 25501. Exposure to a Naturally Occurring 


Chemical in a Food, Article 5, Chapter 1. Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986: 


§ 25501. Exposure to a Naturally Occurring Chemical in a Food. 





The following section (taken from the above text) mirrors the language found in the AG’s website: 


(4) Where a chemical contaminant can occur naturally in a food, the chemical is naturally occurring only to 


the extent that it was not avoidable by good agricultural or good manufacturing practices. The producer, 


manufacturer, distributor, or holder of the food shall at all times utilize quality control measures that 


reduce natural chemical contaminants to the “lowest level currently feasible,” as this term is used in Title 


21, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 110.110, subdivision (c) (2001).
Page 43 of 69 
 


“lowest level currently feasible” is used in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 110.110, 


subdivision (c) (2001) in the following manner: 


The manufacturer, distributor, and holder of food shall at all times 


utilize quality control operations that reduce natural or unavoidable 


defects to the lowest level currently feasible. 


The following reasons lead us to believe that Medifast has not, at all times, utilized quality control 


operations that reduce natural or unavoidable defects to the lowest level currently feasible: 


• Comparable protein products as tested by the Clean Label Project should contain more lead, yet 


contain less lead than the tested Optavia products; if 93% of protein products of these at-risk 


products contain less lead than Optavia, why is not feasible for Med to reduce lead content? 


• Lead was detected in Medifast products in 2008 (similar levels as were detected by our samples), 


and the company has spent relatively on R&D and capex versus peers which would raise the 


question: has MED failed to correct a problem, because it seeked to lower costs? 


As a matter of practicality, proving that a chemical is naturally occurring is very difficult and expensive: 


Unfortunately, the bar to prove that a chemical is naturally occurring is very high and extremely difficult 


to achieve in some circumstances. Moreover, the burden is on the supplement company to prove the Prop 


65 chemical is naturally occurring, so it is an expensive proposition.  Even if a supplement company is able 


to establish that the Prop 65 chemical is naturally occurring in their product, the company still must show 


that they are using good manufacturing practices and have the best quality control measures in place to 


limit exposure to the Prop 65 chemical to the lowest feasible level.

Note that Out of state manufacturers are not exempt from Proposition 65:

Page 44 of 69 
 


The other PROP 65 EXEMPTIONS: Why we believe they do not apply 


In the below table we’ve summarized the other, technical exemptions to complying with Prop 65: 


EXEMPTION APPLICABLE 
TO MED? 


COMMENT 


Federal law governs warning in a 
manner that preempts state authority 


NO There is no federal law regarding lead 
warning that preempts Prop 65 


Exposure takes place less than twelve 
months subsequent to the listing of the 


chemical in question 


NO Lead was first added to Prop as a listed 
chemical in 1987 for reproductive and 


developmental toxicity. 


Exposures do not exceed “significant risk 
level” or “maximum allowable dose 


level” or “MADL”  
 


NO One serving of MED exceeds the MADL of 
0.5mcg/day for lead 


Governmental agencies and public 
water utilities are exempt 


NO MED is neither a governmental agency nor 
public water utility 


Businesses with nine or fewer 
employees 


NO MED employed 399 employees per its 2017 
10K 


Discharges that do not result in 
“significant amount” of the listed 


chemical entering into any source of 
drinking water 


NO MED is not discharging or releasing lead 
into water or land that will pass into a 


source of drinking water.  The issue with 
MED is lead from ingestion of its weight 


loss food products.
