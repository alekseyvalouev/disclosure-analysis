Citron has no interest in repeating a story that has already been told. The principal
points made in this report are new and have not been published on this stock previously.
We present in the company's own words, why its stock is worthless.


Three weeks ago, a detailed report was published on Seeking Alpha that asked the right
questions. But it was published without knowing that the answers would be posted only
a week later when Accelerate Diagnostics (NASDAQ:AXDX) filed its SEC 10-K.


What the writer of that article failed to note is that while they were busy trying to prove
that Accelerate had no "accelerated" diagnostics... the SEC was already forcing the
company to admit as much.


It is well known that Accelerate Diagnostics is a controversial stock. Here are the main
reasons:


11 years of unfulfilled promises about the same product.

8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha

No viable commercial product on the immediate horizon.


Scant R&D.


Rejected by two major pharma companies - who each had exclusive rights to
AXDX's platform and core technology for months, and then walked away.


Not a single independent scientific publication on its technology - despite over 30
papers authored by employees and individuals compensated by the company.


A competitive landscape increasingly crowded with high-credibility and well-funded
competitors, each aggressively bringing new technologies to market - many already
FDA-approved and/or with Europe CE approval.


But now, we'll step you through the sequence by which the SEC at its finest, forces the
company to 'fess up and abandon its 10+ year misleading overreach of a story about
rapid diagnostics using direct from patient blood samples.


Kudos to the Securities and Exchange Commission


In its 12+ years of publishing stock research and commentary on highly promoted and
misunderstood stocks, Citron has never observed such acute and decisive subject
matter expertise from regulators as the SEC has demonstrated on AXDX. It is obvious
that after 10 years of empty promises, the SEC stepped in to ask the $1 billion question.


"Is your Diagnostic Test actually Accelerated?"


We see this SEC inquiry into the company's disclosures take shape in correspondence
from the Fall of 2014.


SEC Correspondence: September 9, 2014 and the key follow-up: October 24, 2014


Observe in the excerpts below exactly how this exchange between the company and the
regulators forces the company to come clean. Moreover, the SEC's challenges expose
the company’s utter disregard for truthful disclosure to its own shareholders.

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420414062690/0001144204-14-062690-index.htm
8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 3/17


The SEC publicly takes note that since 2004, AXDX has claimed to its investors that the
company's ID/AST technology diagnoses blood pathogens and identifies antibiotic
sensitivities without requiring a positive blood culture. Such capability, if true, would be a
tremendous clinical improvement on existing methodologies, delivering "accelerated"
diagnostic and antibiotic sensitivity results in hours, rather than days in the case
of serious and life-threatening blood-borne infections.


If, after all these years, the ID/AST platform still needs a prerequisite positive blood
culture before running diagnostic testing on its platform, it is Citron's opinion that the
company's technology is worthless in the 2015 diagnostic landscape. As in bagel, zero,
nada, zilch.


Citron recommends investors read the above-referenced correspondence links in
entirety, but highlights the most relevant sections below. One insightful challenge is
raised in Comment #3 of the 9/9/2014 filing. Referring directly to a scientific publication
on the AXDX website written by a 14-year employee, the SEC writes:


We also note that your system uses a "culture-free process." Please tell us and in
future filings disclose how you achieve cell growth without a culture. We note in this
regard that your study indicates that certain of the bacteria being studied were
subcultured on sheep's blood agar.


In response, AXDX management provides an obtuse and confusing response. Their
lack of clarity is just one example of their fast and loose play with industry jargon; but
clearly, they are forced to acknowledge their system does require a "positive blood
culture."


When we state that the ID/AST System uses a "culture-free process," we are
referring to our system’s ability to directly process a positive blood culture, respiratory,
or other specimen without first undergoing a manual culture and isolation process.


(Note: Well-established tests are already available for respiratory swabs and other
direct specimen types; the compelling market opportunity for the diagnostic laboratory
technology industry is direct diagnosis from blood samples. This is where rapid
diagnostic tools can makes a pivotal difference in the prognosis for critically ill patients
suffering from sepsis, toxic shock, staph or hospital-induced superbug infections.)

Then, the company launches a rambling characterization of conventional laboratory
processing of blood, with no reference to the current competitive landscape (as though
there isn't one... Citron will comment...), and when it finally gets to answering the
question, the company says:


Instead, we plan for the operator to introduce a patient positive blood culture,
respiratory, or other sample directly into our system.


At the end of its answer, the company makes this extraordinary and chilling statement.
Citron advises the following would an immediate red flag for all investors in any filing of
any company, at any time, under any and all circumstances:


We do not believe that the level of detail requested by the Staff is material to our
investors, so the Company respectfully requests to not include such disclosure in its
future filings.


This is as scary as anything we've ever seen a publicly traded company state in
response to an SEC question! Yet, in addition to the quote above, AXDX invokes it no
less than three other distinct times in its responses!


From the ferocity of their follow-up, it appears the SEC was "not amused". In their
October 24 follow-on reply, the SEC pressed their issue:


it "appears necessary for an investor to understand your use of the term 'culture-free
process'"


Finally, the company concedes the point to the SEC, while forcing investors to wait for
future filings:


We confirm that in future filings, as appropriate, we will provide explanatory
disclosure with respect to our use of the term "culture-free process."


This company's name is "Accelerate Diagnostics". But investors would have to read with
a microscope the company's recently filed BS-loaded 10-K - to notice that the claims of
"Accelerated Diagnostics" using the company's technology, have all been
removed.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 5/17


On February 26, AXDX filed its 10-K, and look what has been cut out.


In years of previous 10-K and 10-Q filings, the company has widely used the following
paragraph to describe its core business. But now it has cut it!


The Company's BACcel TM platform utilizes a proprietary culture-free process with
both genomic and phenotypic detection technologies that decrease time to result
while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity.


This paragraph is now gone, along with ANY mention of "culture-free" or "direct from
sample" in the entire 10-K!


How significant has that paragraph "Culture-Free Process" been to AXDX?


The phrase "culture-free process" appears in:

- The New York Times stock listings 
- Nasdaq.com 
- Marketwatch.com

(Note: Synonymous language for "culture-free process" is "direct from sample", a

8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 6/17


Today's high ground in medical diagnostics is built upon high-tech approaches to
diagnosis and treatment of blood infections that specifically bypass the old-tech lab
procedure of culturing blood. Blood culturing is extremely time-consuming, with no
definite endpoint. 50% or more the results come back "failure to culture", and thus, 8
hours can become 24 hours... or days... useless when a patient's life hangs in the
balance.


In contrast, "direct from sample" technologies that offer diagnostic and treatment
directives without these long delays are extremely valuable to healthcare providers.
(See Appendix 1 for further explanation of this topic.)


The carefully crafted company perception that Accelerate's BACcel technology (now
called Accelerate ID/AST) can process direct patient blood samples, and thereby avoid
the time delays of positive blood cultures for its own most likely use case, is the
foremost investment thesis for AXDX investors today.


Lack of Analyst Coverage


It's no secret that we are in the middle of the biggest biotech / medtech boom that the
markets have ever seen. Every Wall Street analyst is looking to get their foot in the door
with any company that might truly deliver the latest "new new". Theranos has become
the most sought-after private company in the world.


Yet, AXDX, despite its often-repeated promises of a "better mousetrap", has 0 analyst
coverage. Look at T2 Biosystems (TTOO). With 1/3rd the market cap, T2 has coverage
from at least four firms, Goldman and Morgan included. In Citron's 12-year history of
publishing on suspect public companies, we have NEVER seen a billion-dollar
market cap company with zero analyst coverage, especially one in such a highly
discussed field.


We all know Wall Street loves a good story, but when it comes to AXDX, the line has to
be drawn between story and fantasy.


What About Those Pilot Clinical Studies?


This SEC exchange didn't stop with the "culture" or "no-culture" probe - they
pressed further, demanding clarity on the company's claims about its "pilot
clinical studies". From the 9/9/2014 SEC Correspondence:

8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 7/17


Your disclosure in this section refers to pilot clinical studies. Please tell us and
disclose in future filings how these pilot clinical studies advance your FDA approval
process.


These pilot clinical studies are limited in size and scope and are intended to provide
useful insights into device efficacy. They are not intended to specifically advance our
FDA approval process...


Because pilot study data is not typically a part of an FDA submission and we do not
intend to include such information in our FDA submission, we respectfully request to
not disclose in our future filings how any pilot studies advance the FDA approval
process.


The SEC then inquires into the independence of the published data points on the
technology:


Your disclosure on page 7 indicates that three studies were conducted using the
BACcel system. Please tell us who conducted these studies and whether these "joint"
studies were independent. Please also tell us whether the referenced studies
involved the pre-clinical instruments or the "proof of concept testing" that you
reference...


These studies were collaborative, not independent, and were performed as part of
the proof of concept testing referred to on page 6 of the Form 10-K, and not on the
pre-clinical instruments.


In their October 24 reply, the SEC didn't seem amused:


To the extent that you discuss pilot clinical trials in your future filings, the nature and
purpose of those studies should be clear to investors. Accordingly, please confirm
that you will disclose your response to prior comment 10 to the extent that you
include disclosure concerning pilot clinical studies.


We confirm that, to the extent we discuss pilot clinical studies in future filings, we will
clarify the nature and purpose of those studies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 8/17


In addition to these questions and the ones about the phrase "culture-free process", the
company "respectfully" requested to not explain further in filings responses to questions
about:


the system's ability to distinguish amongst different types of bacteria colonies;


the steps necessary prior to introducing bacterial samples into the system's
microarrays, and the time and automation of those steps; and


what the system might add in the way of useful information where the identity of the
pathogen is not known.


In each case, the company states that it does not believe the level of detail requested in
the question is material to investors.


So What About FDA Approval? AXDX's Responses to the SEC Are Starting to
Read Like the Work of a Pathological Liar... in the 5th Grade.


So the company has clearly ditched its claim for a "culture-free" technology, but now
states it will seek accelerated "de novo" FDA approval for its technology platform, plus a
test that depends on the prerequisite of positive blood culture. (See Appendix 2 for the
exact quote.) But can even this vastly inferior outcome be regarded as credible? The
SEC asks:


We note... you anticipate initiating clinical trials for BACcel in the first half of 2015, CE
mark registration in early 2015 and United States FDA approval in early 2016. Please
tell us and revise your future filings to disclose the basis for your belief that you will
achieve those milestones as of the currently disclosed dates. Please include in your
response and disclose in future filings what steps you have taken to date to achieve
those milestones and what steps remain to be taken in order to achieve those
milestones including whether you will seek FDA registration and approval of your
proposed clinical trials.


"The exact regulatory path for the AST portion of our system and positive blood
culture test kit is still being evaluated by the Company and is the subject of ongoing
discussion with the FDA.
8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 9/17


... The FDA approval process for our ID/AST System and positive blood culture test
kit will require a clinical study that supports statistical equivalency with established
clinical standards for both identification and susceptibility.


... We anticipate initiating clinical trials for the ID/AST System and positive blood
culture test kit in the first half of 2015, CE mark registration in early 2015 and FDA
approval in early 2016."


But when AXDX filed its 10-K, the company had advanced its claimed approval
date to 2015. Responding to the demand for milestones, the company issued a
plan so severely messed up, we had to reprint it (see below).


Oh, and just one more thing: Not one single penny spent on clinical trials in 2014!
We are not making this up, either. From the just-filed 2014 10-K:


Clinical Trial Agreements


The Company has entered into master agreements with clinical trial sites in which we
typically pay a set amount for start-up costs and then pay for work performed. No
amounts have been incurred for these arrangements through December 31,
2014.


Let's get this straight: The company acknowledges that:


A formal clinical trial of ID/AST will be required.


The clinical trial plan has not yet been filed.


Not one penny was spent on clinical trials in 2014.


Its own pilot clinical studies provide no independent basis for required clinical trials.


Regardless, the company asserts that it will gain FDA approval in 2015. Really???


Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we anticipate that the
ID/AST System will receive FDA approval in calendar year 2015.


Proposed AXDX Milestones for 2015 FDA Approval

(Editor's Note: Citron has copied and pasted this set of milestones verbatim from
AXDX's just-filed 10-K - the italicized text is our commentary.)


As of December 31, 2014 we have completed the following steps toward our goal of
obtaining regulatory approvals for E.U. and U.S. launches of the ID/AST System and
positive blood culture test kit:


design of the final ID/AST System and positive blood culture test kit;


meeting with the FDA to discuss the regulatory approval path for the ID/AST
System and positive blood culture test kit;


design of the U.S. clinical study;


selection of clinical trial sites;


obtain ISO13485 certification based on the establishment and audit of a product
quality system; and


building good manufacturing practice (GMP) manufacturing and test facilities.


Key remaining steps toward obtaining a CE-mark for commercialization in the E.U.,
anticipated for the first half of 2015, and upon obtaining FDA approval
commercializing the product in the U.S., include:


completing product technical files and providing a self-declaration of conformity
to our E.U. authorized representative after which CE mark will be obtained;


the execution of the U.S. clinical trials; <--- Approval of FDA first, then clinical
trials?


preparation of the FDA submission following the clinical trials; and<--- Ditto: So
first it obtains "FDA approval commercializing the product", and THEN executes
the clinical trials?


obtaining a positive review of this submission from the FDA. <--- Ditto, but Citron
observes the FDA will probably want do the review this before issuing
clearance...

Reality Check: Sounds like a plan! Except .. how can this plan possibly be
accomplished in less than 2.5 or 3 years?


Two major competitors, T2 and Abbott's (ABT) IRIDICA, provide useful timeline
comparisons. T2 began clinical trials in 2012 and received FDA approval in September
and December 2014. Abbott's IRIDICA, which is currently approved for use in Europe,
has begun U.S. clinical trials, with approval anticipated in 2017.


It is impossible to ignore that this entire FDA approval plan puts the company on course
to receive approval for a product, which, to the extent it depends upon cultured blood
as a starting point for its analysis, the diagnostics market neither needs nor wants. It is
Citron's opinion that this plan is intended to defend the stock price by misleading
investors, rather than bring a legitimate product to the medical diagnostics market.


All of the company's bullshit, which is obvious to the SEC and investors are left to puzzle
out, was figured out by past potential industry partners. We could have read between
the lines:


Becton, Dickinson and Novartis Both Previously Studied BACcel ... and Both
Walked Away


September 2009: Despite the impressive-sounding results of studies published in 2008,
more than a year after the its publication, and after spending nine months evaluating the

Meanwhile, here's the total R&D expense as filed in AXDX's 10-Ks in the last seven
years. Is this really the commitment of a supremely qualified innovator to dominate this
space?


2008 $1,001,000


2009 $746,000


2010 $502,000


2011 $455,000


2012 $432,000


2013 $10,673,000


2014 $8,125,000


(Editor's Note: It is important for all who trade in the stock of Accelerate Diagnostics that
Citron warns and understands about its trading dynamics. AXDX is a heavily shorted
and a relatively tightly held name that purports to be developing breakthrough
technology in a hot industry, so short-term movement in the stock may be somewhat
distorted. But unless this company can find a way to change 10 years of misleading
messages to the investing public into a better mousetrap built from scratch against
formidable competition, while fighting off the inevitable class-action lawsuits, this stock is
going to $1.00 in eighteen months. If the stock were more widely held, with analyst
coverage and increased liquidity, our target would be $1.00 in three months.


Because of the extreme disclosure deficiencies documented below, it is Citron's opinion
that this company remains extremely vulnerable to regulatory intervention from the SEC

Conclusion


Looks to us like the above-referenced pointed inquiries from the SEC demonstrate
they've figured out exactly what the game is here. Their job, however, isn't to prevent
smoke-and-mirrors from being sold to the public. They can only make sure that
companies peddling this shit disclose exactly what they are doing, in black and white.

This company's current track to FDA approval isn't intended to create a saleable
product; any diagnostic like its current proposal, that depends upon prerequisite blood
culture, is DOA in the marketplace. So it's going to make a major investment in a set of
clinical trials suitable for an FDA approval process, purely to continue the
smokescreen that the stock is hot buy?


This approval process has taken credible and comparable competitors 3 years, but
AXDX claims it will complete it in 2015, despite not having started the clinical trial yet.
Good luck with that!


If approved, this product, which requires pre-cultured blood, will have zero market
traction. Will AXDX will be obliged to hire a sales force to try to sell it, all of which
will be sunk cost, just to keep up the charade? By the time this company might
legitimately earn approval for a culture-free diagnostic for important infections, it will be
swarmed under by competition.


Kudos to the SEC, and cautious investing to all.


Stay tuned for Part 2, in which we dissect the new set of lies from AXDX in its
dishonest portrayal of the competitive landscape, and how the company
mischaracterizes product it allegedly will bring to market some day in the future.


(supplementary appendix material below)


Appendix 1:


"Positive Blood Culture" vs. "Direct Patient Blood Sample"


What Investors Need to Know:


The technical issue investors need to focus on is really quite straightforward... except
when you read the company's bafflegab.


When a seriously ill patient seeks medical care for an systemic infection - via the ER, a
doctor's office or clinic - the ideal scenario would be a rapid diagnostic test which
identifies the pathogen, as well as the most effective antibiotic to treat the infection. For
example, in recent years, a rapid antigen test direct from a throat swab resolves most
uncertainty about whether common severe throat infections are "strep".
8/9/22, 2:31 PM Accelerate Diagnostics' Big Lie Exposed By SEC - $1.00 Target Within 18 Months (NASDAQ _ AXDX) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 14/17


But for several types of serious blood infections (including, for example, toxic shock,
sepsis, staph and other hospital-induced infections), no decisive rapid clinical alternative
has been available. The standard of care has been to culture blood from a blood draw in
a clinical lab - attempting to grow the pathogen causing the patient's illness, first to
identify it, then further testing the cultured growth for antibiotic susceptibility or
resistance.


The problem is that this process runs a long and indeterminate course. A disturbingly
high percentage of cultures - approaching 50% for some infections - fail to culture
decisively; the blood pathogen fails to grow in an incubator. This point is critical because
failure-to-culture results (e.g. false negatives) extend the time needed to positively
identify the pathogen for an uncertain span of hours or days. Waiting out this interval -
hour by hour, day by day - doesn't ever give assurance that a decisive pathogen ID or
treatment plan will emerge.


Meanwhile, the physician treating a critically ill infected patient often doesn't have time
to wait to initiate treatment. For medical practitioners dealing with critically ill patients,
the risks of waiting to begin treatment often outweigh the concerns about prescribing the
optimal drug. Without a clear treatment indicator, the clinician will be forced by the
urgency of the illness to prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic, which might not be the
best option to treat the specific pathogen, and might not improve the patient's condition
at all. So in addition to sub-optimal clinical outcomes, the overuse of broad-spectrum
antibiotics is creating increasing dangers of spawning superbugs.


So AXDX describes current clinical practice as taking "hours or days", but when it suits
its purposes, the company minimize the obstacles of needing positive blood cultures:


Blood culture is a routine laboratory process which determines negative from positive
samples through incubation and takes, on average, 8 hours to complete.


AXDX presents no data to support this claim; no statements proving that its technology
makes culturing of blood any faster or more accurate than current clinical practice as
explained above. (And, of course, it ignores all the competitive "direct from sample"
platforms.)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990716-accelerate-diagnostics-big-lie-exposed-by-sec-1_00-target-within-18-months?source=all_articles_title 15/17


But the above-described clinical drawbacks - culturing blood on an uncertain timeline -
remains the primary driver for the market for advanced diagnostics technology.


To claim it has a 13-hour solution (the company states that is what it is applying to the
FDA for de novo clearance for), the company has to try to bend language to sweep
under the rug the massive problem abundantly obvious in clinical practice already: the
failure to culture - false negatives, which set the process of diagnosis and treatment
back hours or even days...


Thus, after 10 years' sound and fury, the product and test kit it is now proposing to
submit to the FDA requires cultured blood, with all its clinical uncertainties. After all this
time, this is simply not a viable competitor any more.


Appendix 2: A More Complete Excerpt from AXDX Answers to SEC on the Topic of
"Blood Culture"


For the purposes of clarity and continuity of our story, we excerpted direct statements for
relevance to the sequence of topics discussed. But AXDX's full explanation of the critical
question - is it applying for clearance for a "proprietary culture-free process" - speaks
volumes, although it is written in a convoluted style that conflates numerous points.


So if you've read this far, here is the key passage, straight from Page 8 of the
company's just-filed 10-K:


Accelerate ID/AST System & Positive Blood Culture Test Kit

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


The ID/AST System features walk-away automation and consists of a fixed
instrument and proprietary single-use test kit. The instrument consists of module(s)
connected to a single analysis computer, which allows hospitals to acquire various
numbers of modules to address their particular test volume. In order to run a patient
sample on the Accelerate ID/AST System the technician would pipette the patient
sample into our system, insert the test kit, and initiate the run. In the case of our initial
test a positive blood culture sample is introduced to the system through pipetting
directly from the blood culture bottle into our test kit. Blood culture is a routine
laboratory process which determines negative from positive samples through
incubation and takes on average 8 hours to complete. After approximately one hour
from sample introduction, an ID result would be available, and after an additional four
hours the AST would also be complete.


So that's 13 hours, not 5, and if - (and that's a big if - to be proved through clinical trials
which are yet to begin) and only if - after 8 hours - a positive blood culture has been
successfully achieved - and in fact, it's the correct positive blood culture populated
with the patient's pathogen(s). Otherwise, the process stretches longer, just like the
"routine laboratory process" the company states it is. The obligation is on AXDX to
prove this in its yet-to-begin clinical trials.


The company has left the entire topic of failure-to-culture out of the discussion. Investors
might overlook this, but no clinician can or will, nor will the FDA. Approval for a process
dependent on blood culture will not give AXDX any ability to sell this platform for "direct
from sample" - that protocol and any accessories would require their own separate
clinical trials.
