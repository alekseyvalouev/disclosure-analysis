Universal Display’s ludicrous claim of owning
phosphorescence


Posted on September 27, 2013 by asensio.com


Friday, September 27, 2013.    Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”;


NASDAQ: OLED) has repeatedly claimed that it “invented” and


“developed” and “owns” phosphorescent OLED technology. These


claims and UDC’s confessions that undermine the same claims are


addressed in a separate asensio.com report. The weakness of UDC’s


invention claims, however, is far worse than even UDC’s


confessions.


UDC has acknowledged that its “dramatic breakthrough” involved


merely the ‘routine transfer’ of one single example of commonplace


OLED device architecture from existing fluorescent OLEDs


developed in the 1980s with the addition of one simple existing


iridium compound as an emitter. What UDC did not admit is that


iridium compounds were widely known to be phosphorescent


emitter years before UDC ever conducted the government-funded


DARPA experiments that are the basis for UDC’s key patents. The


iridium compound that it used was one that was particularly well-


known to be phosphorescent.


By the time UDC made its “dramatic breakthrough” of using one


iridium compound, Ir(ppy)3, in an existing OLED, not only were


organometallic iridium compounds well known to be


phosphorescent, but why and how they emitted light from triplet


reactions was well understood. In fact, their triplet emission


capacity was so well established that scientific research had turned


to the synthetic production of commercial quantities of the


phosphorescent materials. In order to accomplish this virtually all


humanly possible explorations of organometallic phosphorescent


compounds were being measured and published including the


atomic position of each of the atoms that were bonded to the

he does, it’s wise

iridium, the distances between these atoms, the angles at which


they bonded and the distances between these bonds. Below are two


examples of this work that existed long before 1998 when UDC


claimed it made its “dramatic breakthough.”


A July 17, 1990 article by K. Dedeian refers to the phosphorescent


properties of the same compound used in UDC’s experiments,


Ir(ppy)3, and directly shows data indicating that Ir(ppy)3 is


phosphorescent (see Table 1). The luminescence of each of the


iridium compounds is shown on this table at room temperature. But


it doesn’t end here.


Dedeian’s second author on the above 1990 article is Djurovich. In


the article the authors thank Dr. Nancy Keder for her assistance in


determining the structure of an iridium compound. Keder


conducted experiments to understand and describe the atomic


structure of iridium compounds. This work laid the foundation for


understanding exactly how organometallic iridium compounds’


structures facilitate the emission of light through triplet emissions.


Keder’s work with Peter Djurovich, published in 1992, shows that


iridium compounds with ligands like ppy work by the same metal-


to-ligand charge transfer described in Dedeian. Djurovich also


shows that iridium is easily oxidized.


From all of these publication, it is readily apparent not only that


certain organometallic iridium compounds are phosphorescent, but


also that Ir(ppy)3 was established as a good phosphorescent emitter


material, even relative to other iridium compounds. This was


common knowledge readily available before UDC’s purported


“dramatic breakthrough” when they put Ir(ppy)3 into an existing


fluorescent OLED structure. Not only was UDC’s emitter material


well known to be phosphorescent, but it was also well known


exactly how and why it was phosphorescent. With all that was


known about OLEDs and organometallic iridium compounds, all


that UDC needed was to read and follow the instructions of others.


Despite UDC’s admission that it “routinely transferred” fluorescent


OLED technology and only added an emitter, it has not admitted


that its emitter compound was already well known to be


phosphorescent. But given the level of research into the


phosphorescent emission of organometallic iridium compounds,


especially Ir(ppy)3, years before UDC’s experiments, it is clear that


UDC did not truly invent any aspect or component of its device.


UDC’s claim of owning phosphorescence is ludicrous.
