Summary:  Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.
(AMEH)


FTSE/Russell recently added ApolloMed to its indices but erred in its calculation of �oat,


forcing index funds to buy a disproportionate number of shares; roughly one-third of the


actual �oat.


The error and subsequent forced index buying caused shares to spike 50% on 114x


normal volume on the day prior to index inclusion.


Russell realized its mistake and has slated a reduction of ApolloMed’s index shares by


~86.5% for 9/21, which should force the sale of roughly 1.7 million shares.


With an average daily volume of only 130,000 shares per day, we expect the forced sales


to crush the stock by the e�ective date.


ApolloMed has complex �nancials due to several consolidated VIEs. After untangling the


web, we believe fair value is $5.80/share, suggesting a ~60% downside scenario on a


fundamental basis alone.


Apollo Medical Holdings (NASDAQ:AMEH (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMEH)) is the latest


example a company whose shares will be subjected to a forced sell-o� due to a miscalculation


by the FTSE/Russell Indices. We expect the sell-o� to severely impact the stock price by Privacy  - Terms


Apollo Medical: Look Out Below – �ussell’s
Latest Float Calculation Screw-Up


Published on September 4, 2018

September 21st, the date the mistake is slated for correction.


By way of background, in December 2017 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-


releases/apollomed-and-network-medical-management-announce-completion-of-merger-and-


listing-on-the-nasdaq-capital-market-300569428.html) ApolloMed completed a reverse take-


over (RTO) of a company called Network Medical Management (NMM). NMM shareholders hold


approximately 82% of the company, with its shares locked up until at least June 2019.


FTSE/Russell added ApolloMed (https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/3167861) to its indices


in June of this year, but failed to account for the limited �oat created by NMM’s locked-up


shares. The result was that index funds tracking the FTSE/Russell indices were forced by


mandate to purchase a disproportionate number of ApolloMed’s shares; roughly one-third of


the actual �oat.


The mistake caused a massive volume and price spike. On June 22nd, the day prior to index


inclusion, ApolloMed’s stock ripped almost 50% higher on volume of 2.9 million shares, about


119x its average volume.


Insiders have taken the opportunity to sell in the interim, with the company’s co-CEO unloading


nearly 30% of his shares from May to present. The company’s co-chief medical o�cer and a


director have also recently sold shares.


Russell tacitly acknowledged its mistake in a notice


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/4U3u8wIhX2TQFA) to index subscribers on August 27th


which showed that Apollo’s representation in the indices will be lowered by 86.5% going


forward. The e�ective date of this change is September 21st. Thus, by that date the index funds


will have to reverse much of their ownership and sell approximately 1.7 million shares that they


were previously required to purchase.


The scenario unfolding with ApolloMed echoes the recent Long�n debacle. Long�n


(OTCPK:LFIN (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LFIN)) is a blockchain startup that also IPO’d


late last-year via RTO. FTSE/Russell miscalculated


(https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/03/23/1521820767000/FTSE-Russell-gets-in-a-tangle/) the


number of Long�n’s freely tradable shares and mistakenly added Long�n to its indices. The low


�oat of Long�n combined with large amounts of forced index fund buying sent shares surging,


hitting highs of $74 per share on March 23rd. Long�n was ultimately removed completely from


the Russell on March 28th (https://www.ftse.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice/?


id=2588161), with shares subsequently plummeting as low as $8.11 in the ensuing days.

Similar to Long�n, we expect the FTSE/Russell error with ApolloMed will cause a near-term,


predictable collapse in the share price on massive volume.


Aside from the forced index sales we believe the company is currently overvalued on a


fundamental basis. The stock is up 53% since the December RTO, with a market cap of $535


million as of this writing. The consolidated �nancials appear attractive at �rst glance, but look


far less rosy after parsing through the company’s complex VIE structures. We believe shares


are fairly valued at $5.80 per share, suggesting over 60% downside on just that basis alone.


Background


Apollo Medical is a healthcare management services company. In December 2017 the company


completed a reverse takeover (RTO) of Network Medical Management, a company that


coordinates care for over 600,000 patients throughout the country (Pg. 86


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000114420417059199/tv479301_424b3.ht


m)). NMM shareholders owned 82% of ApolloMed’s combined company as part of the merger


(Pg. 1


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000114420417059199/tv479301_424b3.ht


m)).


Prior to the RTO, Apollo Medical was OTC-listed with a market cap of ~$50 million. The


stock up-listed to NASDAQ


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000114420417063540/tv481301_8k.htm) a


s part of the RTO consummation, and was priced at a fair value of $10 per share upon closing.

The FTSE/�ussell Error


With a combined market value of about $350 million upon deal consummation and a listing on


a major national exchange, ApolloMed was slated for FTSE/Russell index inclusion.


This was the point where FTSE/Russell erred. The index company miscalculated the number of


available trading shares by failing to realize that 82% of the stock is closely held and locked up


with NMM shareholders. Per the merger agreement NMM’s holdings unlock on a staggered


schedule starting 18 months after the merger date, with unlocks beginning in June 2019. (Pg.

m#main_113)) So while there are 33 million shares outstanding, there were only about 6


million shares available after excluding NMM’s holdings.


The mistake forced the purchase of an
estimated 2 million shares by index funds, or
roughly one third of the actual �oat.


At some point Russell became aware of the issue, and on August 27th announced


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/4U3u8wIhX2TQFA) that Russell index shares in ApolloMed


would be reduced by a factor of about 86.5%. The change is to be made e�ective as of


September 21st, suggesting that index funds tracking the Russell will be forced to sell ~86.5%


of their holdings, or an estimated 1.7 million shares by that point.


Given that the stock only trades an average of 130,000 shares a day, the adjustment will likely


be catastrophic to the share price both in the run-up and upon the e�ective date of the


change.


Heavy Insider Sales


In the interim, insiders have sold with regularity. Co-CEO Warren Hosseinion in particular has


sold (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getowner&CIK=0001438327) ~30% of his


holdings at an average price of $15.64 per share (for total proceeds of $4.8 million) between


May 18th and August 27th :

Additionally, an ApolloMed director


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000156761918001764/xslF345X03/doc1.x


ml) and the co-Chief Medical O�cer


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000156761918001893/xslF345X03/doc1.x


ml) have sold a collective 37,948 shares between 8/17 and 8/27.


The arti�cially high price and insider sales have led to a recent sell-o� from the stock’s post-


index inclusion peaks. With the upcoming downward index adjustment we expect the decline


to intensify substantially.


Complex Financials Suggest Fundamental
Downside


On the fundamental side the company looks attractive when just taking a high-level glance at


the �nancials, but a deeper look shows that the metrics are rendered much more complex due


to a series of partially-owned Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) that are consolidated into the


�nancials.


The reason the VIEs are in place makes sense. States have laws that prohibit business entities


with non-physician owners (such as ApolloMed) from practicing medicine (Pg. 15


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000114420418018690/tv489499_10k.htm)).

In order to work alongside physicians ApolloMed must operate with a degree of separation


from the physician’s practices. They then monetize their physician relationships by maintaining


long-term management services agreements with a�liated independent practice associations.


What this all means for ApolloMed is that the economics between the company and its


consolidated VIEs are not completely pari passu. The reported consolidated metrics therefore


paint an incomplete picture of the �nancials.


After stripping out the e�ects of the VIE consolidation the �nancials look far less attractive. For


example, the combined company generated $23.6 million in net income for the �rst 6 months,


or an implied run rate of over $47 million in net income for the year. On a standalone basis


however, net income attributable to ApolloMed (excluding non-controlling interests) was only


$4.8 million for the �rst 6 months of the year. When applying the standalone net income run-


rate to the full year we arrive at ApolloMed’s P/E of roughly 56x, an incredibly rich multiple


compared to similar businesses that often range between 15x-25x.


The balance sheet also appears robust and cash-rich on a consolidated basis, but the assets


and liabilities of the company’s primary VIE are non-recourse (Pg. 39


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1083446/000114420418044680/tv498687_10q.htm))


. The picture is less attractive when excluding its primary VIE and isolating ApolloMed’s


standalone metrics. On a standalone basis the company’s cash balance is $55 million versus a


consolidated $110 million. When stripping out goodwill and intangibles, ApolloMed as a


standalone is left with a mere $16 million in tangible equity.


The company does not report deconsolidated revenue, but Q/Q consolidated revenue declined


modestly from the latest March to June quarters. On the earnings side, Q/Q earnings


attributable to ApolloMed increased by a robust 23%, but given the limited data points post-


merger it is di�cult to establish a long-term trend for either revenue or earnings.


Taken all together, when applying a reasonable 20x P/E multiple to ApolloMed’s standalone


metrics we arrive at a price per share of about $5.80, a nearly 62% discount to current share


prices as of this writing.


We have provided our consolidated and standalone balance sheet calculations below for


reference:

Conclusion: Lower


This looks to us like a rare scenario where an index mistake is poised to force a short-term


�ood of selling pressure on a stock. We believe share prices have been signi�cantly elevated by


the FTSE/Russell index error and will likely converge closer to intrinsic value very quickly. Best


of luck to all.
