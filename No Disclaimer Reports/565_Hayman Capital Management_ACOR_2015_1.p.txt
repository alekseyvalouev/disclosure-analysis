V. IDENTIFICATION OF CHALLENGE 


A. Overview of the ’685 Patent 


i. The ’685 Patent and Related Applications 


The ’685 patent issued on March 4, 2014, from U.S. Patent Application No. 


13/187,158, filed July 20, 2011, (Ex. 1001), which is a continuation of U.S. Patent 


Application No. 11/010,828, filed December 13, 2004, now U.S. Patent 8,007,826 


(Ex. 1002). The ’685 patent claims priority to four U.S. Provisional Patent 


Applications:  Application No. 60/528,760, filed December 11, 2003 (Ex. 1028), 


Application No. 60/560,894 (Ex. 1029), filed April 9, 2004, Application No. 


60/528,592 (Ex. 1030), filed December 11, 2003, and Application No. 60/528,593 


(Ex. 1031), filed December 11, 2003. 


The ’685 patent is entitled “Sustained Release Aminopyridine Composition” 


and describes a method of improving walking in a human afflicted with multiple 


sclerosis (“MS”). (See Ex. 1001.) The ’685 patent further describes various 


pharmacokinetic parameters and dosing regimens associated with the administration 


of this SR oral formulation, such as Tmax, “release profile[s],” average plasma 


concentrations, dispersal of the drug based on a rate-of-release-controlling polymer, 


and administration intervals. (Id. at col. 13, ll. 7–28.) The ’685 patent claims the 


administration of an oral, sustained release (“SR”) composition comprising 10 mg of 


4-aminopyridine and one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients twice daily 


for a time period of at least two weeks. (Id. at Claims.) The specification teaches an
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


5 


escalating dosing regimen: “For example, at the commencement of treatment the 


active agent is preferably administered at a dose less than 15 mg/day until a tolerable 


state is reached. The dose administered may then be increased by amounts of at least 


5-15 mg/day until a therapeutic dose is reached.” (Ex. 1001, at 6:37–48.) The 


specification also discloses treatment for multiple weeks in Example 8, which is an 8-


week study. (Id. at col. 25, 26.) 


ii. The ’685 Patent Claims 


The ’685 patent includes 8 claims with claim 1 being the only independent 


claim. Each of claims 1–8 are challenged in the present petition. 


Independent Claim 1 is directed to a method of improving walking in a 


human multiple sclerosis patient comprising orally administering a sustained release 


composition of 10 mg 4-aminopyridine twice daily for at least two weeks. 


Independent claim 1 recites: 


A method of improving walking in a human multiple sclerosis patient in 


need thereof comprising orally administering to said patient a sustained 


release composition of 10 milligrams of 4-aminopyridine twice daily for a 


time period of at least two weeks, wherein the sustained release 


composition further comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable 


excipients. 


(See Ex. 1001, at 27:22–28.) Claims 2–8 depend directly or indirectly from claim 1.
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


6 


Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and recites that the sustained release 


composition provides a mean Tmax in a range of about 2 to about 6 hours after 


administration of the sustained release composition to the patient. (Id. at 28:1–4.) 


Claim 3 depends from claim 2 and recites that the sustained release 


composition is capable of providing, upon administration to the patient, a release 


profile of the 4-aminopyridine extending over at least 6 hours. (Id. at 28:5–8.) 


Claim 4 depends from claim 3 and recites that the sustained release 


composition is capable of providing, upon administration to the patient, a release 


profile of the 4-aminopyridine extending over at least about 12 hours. (Id. at 28:9–12.) 


Claim 5 depends from claim 1 and recites that the sustained release 


composition provides an average plasma concentration at steady state in humans in 


the range of about 15 ng/ml to about 35 ng/ml. (Id. at 28:13–17.) 


Claim 6 depends from claim 1 and recites that the 4-aminopyridine is 


dispersed in a rate of release controlling polymer. (Id. at 28:18–19.) 


Claim 7 depends from claim 1 and recites that the sustained release 


composition comprises a matrix in which the 4-aminopyridine is homogeneously 


dispersed that is suitable for controlling the release rate of the 4-aminopyridine. (Id. at 


28:20–23.) 


Claim 8 depends from claim 1 and recites that the step of administering 


comprises b.i.d. administering or administering at 12 hour intervals. (Id. at 28:24–26.)
Patent No. 8,663,685

iii. The ’685 Patent Prosecution History 


The application that ultimately issued as the ’685 patent contained a preliminary 


amendment dated July 20, 2011, cancelling all 23 of its original claims, and added 10 


new claims all directed to methods of improving walking in MS patients.  (See Ex. 


1022.) 


On October 31, 2011, June 7, 2012, and October 1, 2012, Applicants filed three 


separate Information Disclosure Statements (IDS) listing, in total, thirty-three United 


States patent documents, fourteen foreign patent documents, and at least four 


hundred and twenty three (423) non-patent literature documents totaling 470 


references. (See Exs. 1014–1016.) In the IDS submitted October 31, 2011, one of the 


423 non-patent documents Applicants submitted was Reference C148: Hayes et al., 


2001, "Open-label, multiple-dose study to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety 


of fampridine-sr (sustained-release 4-aminopyridine) in patients with chronic spinal 


cord injury," presented to the American Neurological Association, Chicago, Illinois, 


Sept. 30–Oct. 3, 2001. (See Ex. 1014, at Sheets 9–10 of 23.) Another of the 423 non-


patent documents Applicants submitted was reference C416: a poster entitled 


“Placebo-controlled double-blinded dose ranging study of fampridine-SR in multiple 


sclerosis,” by Goodman et al., presented at a conference from September 18–21, 


2002. (See Ex. 1016, at Sheet 1 of 2.) 


On December 17, 2012, the Examiner issued a first office action, and rejected 


the pending claims over the doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting in view of
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


8 


recently issued claims in Applicant’s U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, copending application 


No. 11/102,559 (now U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437), copending application No. 


13/410,388, and copending application No. 13/299,969 (now U.S. Patent No. 


8,440,703). (See Ex. 1017, at 2–6.) 


The Applicants responded on March 18, 2013, and filed four terminal 


disclaimers against the identified patent and applications and requested that the 


double patenting rejections be withdrawn. (Id. at 2–5.) A Notice of Allowance was 


mailed on April 25, 2013. The Examiner’s Reasons for Allowance states that “claims 


24–33 are methods of use claims, corresponding to the methods of use claims which 


ha[ve] been found to be novel and unobvious and ha[ve] been allowed and issued” in 


the ʼ826 patent. (See Ex. 1023, at 2.)  


On October 2, 2013, Applicants filed a petition to withdraw the application 


from issuance and a Request for Continued Examination in order to submit a fourth 


IDS with twelve additional references for consideration by the Examiner. (Ex. 1024.) 


In response, on October 18, 2013, the Examiner again issued a Notice of Allowance, 


stating in the Reasons for Allowance that the newly submitted references “do not 


teach nor provide adequate motivation to arrive at the instantly claimed methods.” 


(See Ex. 1025, at 2–3.) An updated Notice of Allowance was issued on November 14, 


2013, to reflect Applicants’ amendment canceling pending claims 32 and 33.  


On January 13, 2014, Applicants yet again filed a petition to withdraw the 


application from issuance and a Request for Continued Examination in order to
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


9 


submit a fifth IDS with thirteen additional references for consideration. (See 


Ex. 1026.) In response, on January 22, 2014, the Examiner again issued a Notice of 


Allowance, stating in the Reasons for Allowance that the newly submitted references 


“do not teach nor provide adequate motivation to arrive at the instantly claimed 


methods.” (See Ex. 1027, at 2.) The ’685 patent issued on March 2, 2014. The 


Examiner never entered a substantive rejection against any of the pending claims—no 


prior art was cited by the Examiner during the prosecution of the ’685 patent in any 


Office Action. (See Ex. 1001.) 


iv. Summary of Selected Prosecution History of the Parent ’826 Patent 


The ’685 patent issued from a child continuation application of the parent ’826 


patent. The Applicant filed the application that issued as the ’826 parent on 


December 13, 2004, over six years prior to filing the application for the ’685 patent. 


None of the prior art cited in any office action rejection in the ’826 file history is used 


in any of the Petition’s grounds challenging the ’685 patent claims. But given that the 


’685 Reasons for Allowance refers to the ’826 claims, Petitioner here provides a brief 


summary of the prosecution history of the parent ’826 patent.  


The ’826 file history is over 2,000 pages. However, the vast majority of the file 


history is irrelevant to the issued claims of either the parent ’826 or the challenged 


’685 patent because most of the file history is directed to pending claims that were 


cancelled and never issued. Applicant filed its ’826 application on December 13, 2004, 


with 23 claims. On June 21, 2008, Applicant withdrew claims 1–8 and 18–23 in
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


10 


response to a restriction requirement. The withdrawn claims were directed to a 


sustained release tablet, a therapeutic composition, and a sustained release 


composition. (See Ex. 1038, at pg. 2.)  


The Examiner issued two office action rejections during the ’826 prosecution. 


In response to the first rejection dated December 8, 2008, the Applicant withdrew 


several claims, amended pending claims, added new claims, and removed one of the 


two inventors from the application. (Ex. 1039) On May 25, 2010, the Examiner again 


rejected all pending claims. (Ex. 1040, at 1.) In response to this rejection, on 


November 24, 2010, the Applicant withdrew certain claims, amended others, added 


new claims, added a new second inventor to the application, and submitted two 


declarations purporting to support commercial success and long-felt need. (Ex. 1041.) 


After an interview and certain Examiner amendments, the claims that were first 


submitted on November 24, 2010—nearly six years after filing the application— 


issued as the ’826 patent. The ’826 Reasons for Allowance reveal that the claims 


issued over three references (Schwid, Hayes 2003, and Bevers 194)—none of which 


are at issue in the instant Petition. (Ex. 1042, at 2.) The Reasons for Allowance do not 


cite, rely upon, or even acknowledge Applicant’s declarations directed to alleged 


commercial success and long-felt need. (Id.) 


B. Level of Skill in the Art 


The level of skill in the art at the time of the invention may be derived from a 


review of the relevant prior art. Petitioner submits an expert declaration from Dr.
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


11 


Pleasure, Professor of Neurology and the Glenn W. Johnson, Jr. Memorial Endowed 


Chair of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. 


(Ex. 1013.) Dr. Pleasure attests that “a person of ordinary skill in the art would have 


been an M.D. or Ph.D. in neuroscience or related field with an understanding of 


pharmacokinetics and at least some experience in providing drug therapy to MS 


patients, with access to a person having an advanced degree (Master of Science or 


Ph.D.) in pharmaceutics or pharmaceutical formulation, specifically oral sustained 


release formulations, or at least 5 years of experience in formulating oral sustained 


release pharmaceutical drug products.” (Ex. 1013, Pleasure Decl. ¶ 23.)  


Petitioner also submits an expert declaration from Dr. Polli, Professor of 


Pharmaceutical Sciences and Ralph F. Shangraw/Noxell Endowed Chair in Industrial 


Pharmacy and Pharmaceutics at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy. (Ex. 


1035.) Dr. Polli adopted the same definition of a person of ordinary skill. (Id., ¶ 11.) 


C. Claim Construction of Challenged Claims 


In an inter partes review, “[a] claim in an unexpired patent shall be given its 


broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it 


appears.” 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b). This means that the words of the claim are given
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


12 


their plain meaning unless that meaning is inconsistent with the specification. In re 


Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321 (Fed. Cir. 1989).1 


 For the purpose of inter partes review, the analysis herein presumes that the 


claim terms take on their broadest reasonable interpretation in view of the 


specification of the ’685 patent. The specific terms for which a broadest reasonable 


construction should be applied are as follows: 


1. Release Profile  


The term “a release profile” (claims 3–4) should be construed to mean “a 


concentration of a drug in a patient’s plasma over time.” (Ex. 1001, col. 6, ll. 24–27.)  


2. Matrix 


The term “matrix” should be construed to mean “a composition which 


provides for a sustained release of a drug into the plasma of a patient.” (See Ex. 1001, 


at col. 9, ll. 15–17; Ex. 1035, ¶ 34.) 


                                      
1 Terms should be construed to have a special meaning only when the Patent Owner 


amends the claims pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, to make them expressly correspond to 


that meaning. See 77 Fed. Reg. 48764 at II.B.6 (Aug. 14, 2012).

D. Statements of Precise Relief Requested for Each Claim Challenged 


i. Claims for which Review is Requested 


Petitioner requests IPR and cancellation of claims 1–8 of the ’685 patent under 


35 U.S.C. § 311. The precise relief requested by Petitioner is that each of claims 1–8 


of the ’685 patent be found unpatentable as obvious in view of the prior art. 


ii. Statutory Grounds of Challenge 


Inter partes review of the ’685 patent is requested in view of the following 


references, each of which is prior art to the ’685 patent under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(a) and 


(b) or 103. The prior art cited in the following chart were not referenced in any Office 


Action by the Examiner. Claims 1–8 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103:

E. Overview of State of the Art Providing Motivation to Combine for All 
Grounds in the Petition 


i. 4-AP History and the State of the Relevant Art as of December 2002 


4-aminopyridine (also referred to as fampridine or “4-AP”) is an organic 


compound that has been the subject of intensive medical research for nearly 100 


years. 4-AP is a derivative of pyridine with an amino substitution in the 4-position. 


(See Ex. 1009.) In 1924, researchers first described the pharmacological properties of 


aminopyridine compounds and, specifically, the excitatory effect of 4-AP on the 


central nervous system. For more than 30 years, researchers have been able to show 


the effectiveness of 4-AP treatment in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. (See 


Ex. 1005.) Placebo-controlled, double-blind studies evaluating the effectiveness of 


oral 4-AP administration in multiple sclerosis patients also were conducted in the early 


1990s. (See Exs. 1007, 1008, 1032.) Published research from such studies clearly 


demonstrated that administering 4-AP to patients suffering from multiple sclerosis 


was an effective treatment. (Id.) Clinical endpoints measured in these studies included 


lower extremity functions and timed walk and 4-AP treatment clearly demonstrated an 


improvement in multiple sclerosis patients. (See Ex. 1008.)  


Dr. Pleasure attests that MS is “an inflammatory demyelinating disease 


featuring selective destruction of the central nervous system (“CNS”) myelin. (Ex. 


1035, ¶ 16.) Dr. Pleasure further cites and quotes from the New England Journal of 


Medicine describing MS in support of his testimony that “[i]t is my opinion that a
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


16 


POSA at the time of the invention would have known that MS is a long-lasting, 


chronic disease, with patients experiencing problems walking on an ongoing basis and 


especially as the disease progresses with time.” (Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 21-22, quoting Ex. 1019 


at 1430.) For many patients afflicted with MS, ambulatory difficulties, such as walking, 


are chronic, long-term conditions, and thus require ongoing, sustained therapies. (Id.)    


The use of 4-AP in MS patients was well studied over 10 years prior to the 


earliest priority date of the ‘685 patent. (See Ex. 1020.) As early as 1987, the 


neurological changes associated with administration of 4-AP were measured with 7 to 


35 mg of 4-AP in 1 to 5 mg doses, every 10 to 60 minutes, and “motor function 


(power, coordination, gait)” in 5 out 12 patients improved “minutes within injection 


at doses as low as 2 mg.” (Id.) In 1990, Davis et al. administered 10 to 25 mg of 4-AP 


to twenty MS patients and motor functions (power, coordination, and gait) were 


improved in 9 of the 13 that were studied in particular for motor functions. (Ex. 


1021.)  


The Applicants of the ’685 patent do not contend that they invented the 4-AP 


compound. (Ex. 1001, passim.) Nor do they claim to have pioneered the use of 4-AP 


to treat patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. (Id.) The mode of action of 4-AP on 


demyelinating diseases was well understood long before the relevant priority date of 


the ’685 patent, and studies on the use of 4-AP on MS patients were well known in 


the art, as described in detail below. The ’685 patent does not even claim original 


dosing. (Id.) Instead, the ’685 patent simply attempts to claim a method of
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


17 


administering 4-AP twice a day for at least two weeks. (Id.) Not only was that specific 


dosing regimen known in the prior art at the time of the alleged invention, but the 


prior art also taught that administering 10 mg twice per day was effective at improving 


walking in MS patients, while avoiding side effects attendant to higher daily doses. (See 


Ex. 1008, passim.) 


Moreover, as discussed extensively below, Dr. Pleasure testifies that “it would 


have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation 


to treat such patients for a period of at least two weeks (or longer) with agents shown 


to alleviate symptoms associated with MS. (Ex. 1013, ¶ 22.) See also In re Applied 


Materials, Inc., 692 F.3d 1289, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“‘[W]here the general conditions 


of a claim are disclosed in the prior art, it is not inventive to discover the optimum or 


workable ranges by routine experimentation.’”) (quoting In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456 


(CCPA 1955)). It would have been obvious to a POSA to extend the dosing regimen, 


for chronic diseases like MS, from a time period of 1 week to two weeks or more. (Ex. 


1013 ¶ 41.) In fact, administering at least 2 weeks of 10 mg 4-AP BID to a person 


with MS in need of improved walking is not just one of a long list of things a POSA 


would have been motivated to do in view of the prior art—it is the first thing a POSA 


was motivated to do: i.e., select the lowest known efficacious dose (10 mg BID) for 


use over an extended treatment period (measured in weeks not days).  


ii. Summary of the Petition’s Prior Art References  


1.  The Goodman Refence (Ex. 1008)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


18 


The Goodman reference constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because 


it was published at least as early as September 18–21, 2002 (a fact admitted by the ’685 


patent applicants in an October 1, 2012 IDS, see Ex. 1043, at Reference No. C416). 


This date is more than one year prior to December 11, 2003, the earliest possible 


effective filing date for the claims of the ’685 patent. The Goodman Poster was not 


the basis of any Examiner rejection during the ’685 prosecution history.  


The Goodman Poster discloses data, results, and conclusions from a placebo-


controlled double-blinded dose ranging study of SR 4-aminopyridine (also referred to 


as fampridine-SR) in MS patients. The Goodman Poster notes that the primary aim of 


this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of an oral SR 


formulation of 4-aminopyridine. (Ex. 1008, at “Abstract.”) A secondary aim “is to 


explore efficacy over a broad dose range using measures of fatigue and motor 


function.” (Id. at “Abstract.”) Evidence of efficacy and dose response include 


“Standard MS measurements, including timed walk, lower extremity muscle 


strength   . . .” (Id. at “Objectives.”) 


Multiple doses of fampridine-SR were administered (one week each of 20 


mg/day (10 mg BID), 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 70 mg/day, 


and 80 mg/day. (Id. at “Objectives.”) Each dose, in the form of a single tablet, was 


administered twice daily (i.e., BID)—every 12 hours. (Id. at “Overview of Study 


Design.”) The results indicated improvement in 25–foot walk over control at a total 


daily dose of 20 mg and 30 mg (each about 13.5 secs), 40 mg and 50 mg (about 12.5
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


19 


secs), 60 mg (about 13.5 secs), 70 mg (about 13 secs, and 80 mg (about 14 secs). (Id. at 


“Dose Response 25 ft. Walk.”) The improvement in walking speed associated with 


doses of at least 20 mg/day was statistically significant (p=.04). (Id. at “Results 


Summary.”) A “significant benefit in lower extremity strength” also was observed. (Id. 


at “Conclusions.”) 


The study concludes that there was demonstrated “[e]vidence of dose-response 


in 20–40 mg/day range.” However, the study cautioned that “[a]t doses above 40 


mg/day, more severe adverse events were reported, including cases of seizure . . . .” 


(Id. at “Results Summary.”) In this same regard, the study concluded that there was 


“[l]ittle added benefit, and increased risk, at doses above 50 mg/day.” (Id. at 


“Conclusions.”) 


 2.  The Hayes Reference (Ex. 1009) 


Hayes constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because it was published 


on Sept. 30—October 3, 2001, more than one year prior to December 11, 2003 (a fact 


admitted by the ’685 patent applicants in an October 31, 2011 IDS, see Ex. 1033, at 


Reference No. C148). This date is more than one year prior to December 11, 2003, 


the earliest possible effective filing date for the claims of the ‘685 patent. Hayes was 


not the basis of any Examiner rejection during the ‘685 prosecution history.  


The Hayes reference – a poster entitled “Open-label, multiple-dose study to 


determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of fampridine-SR (sustained release 4-


aminopyridine) in patients with chronic spinal cord injury,” by Hayes et al.—was
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


20 


presented to the American Neurological Association, in Chicago, IL, September 30-


October 3, 2001. (Id. at 7.) Like the Goodman Poster, Hayes 2001 notes the 


importance of 4-AP for treatment of patients with MS, and cites Polman (Ex. 1039) 


for its disclosure that 4-AP “improves sensory and motor function in patients 


with…multiple sclerosis.” (Id. at 2.) Polman, in turn, cites van Diemen (Ex. 1007) for 


the similar proposition that 4-AP has “been shown to improve symptoms in patients 


with MS.” (Id. at 1138.)  


Hayes presents data, results and conclusions from an “open label, 4-week study 


conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of multiple oral doses of 


fampridine-SR (sustained release 4-aminopyridine).” (Ex. 1009, pp. 2, 3.) The doses of 


fampridine administered during the study were 10, 15, 20 or 25 mg BID for one week, 


in an ascending manner. (Id.) Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved by 


Day 5. (Ex. 1009, p. 3.) 


Table 2 provides Fampridine-SR pharmacokinetic data. The data for 10 mg 


BID (i.e., 20 mg/day total) as set forth in that table is as follows: Cave: 20.8 (±8.9) 


ng/mL; Tmax: 2.7(±1.0) hours. (Ex. 1009, p. 4.) Figure 1 shows the mean plasma 


concentration for each dose of fampridine over time. The 10 mg BID dosing shows 


that fampridine remains in the plasma at about 22 ng/mL at 6 hours after 


administration, at about 10 ng/mL at 12 hours after administration, and does not 


approach 0 ng/mL until about 20 hours after administration. (Ex. 1009, p. 4.) This 


study noted that the SR formulation did demonstrate slower absorption and lower
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


21 


Cmax relative to the immediate release formulation, and a longer period of elevated 


plasma levels. (Ex. 1009, pp. 5, 6.) 


Moreover, it was within the knowledge of a POSA that a number of prior art 


studies and applications teach and disclose long-term administration of 4-AP for 


treatment of MS. For example, Hayes cites to a prior art publication by Polman et al., 


“4-Aminipyridine is Superior to 3,4,diaminopyridine in the Treatment of Patients with 


Multiple Sclerosis,” Arch. Neurol., 51: 1139–96 (Nov. 1994). (Ex. 1032.) Polman 


constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because it was published in 1994, more 


than one year prior to December 11, 2003, the earliest priority date of the ’685 patent. 


Polman was not the basis of any rejection during the ’685 patent prosecution.  


Polman teaches a method of improving walking in a human multiple sclerosis 


patient in need thereof: “To compare the efficacy and toxicity of 4-aminopyridine and 


3,4 diaminopyridine in patients with multiple sclerosis. … 4-Aminopyridine was more 


effective than 3,4-diarninopyri.dine, especially for ambulation” wherein ambulation is 


walking. (Ex. 1032, Abstract.) Polman’s method comprised orally administering to 


said patient a composition of 10-35 milligrams daily of 4-aminopyridine for a time 


period of at least two weeks. “Responders to treatment with 4-aminopyridine (10 


patients) participated in a comparative study of 6 weeks duration with 4-


aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyri dine according to a randomized, double-blind, 


double crossover design.” (Id. at Abstract.)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


22 


Polman disclosed, “[w]e recently completed a randomized, double-blind, 


placebo-controlled, crossover study of 12 weeks of oral treatment that demonstrated 


that 4-aminopyridine is superior to placebo and improved disability in certain patients 


with MS.” (Id. at 1136.) Polman further disclosed that, “[p]atients were treated for 6 


weeks and received one bottle of medication for each week. The first and the last 


bottles of medication always contained 4-aminopyridine.” (Id. at 1137.) Further, there 


was a cross-over randomization wherein two consecutive bottles of the remaining 


four contained 3,4-diaminopyridine. (Id.) In this way, patients had a double crossover; 


they were randomized to receive 3,4-diaminopyridine either during weeks 2 and 3, or 


during weeks 3 and 4, or during weeks 4 and 5.  


Therefore, the patients receiving the 3,4-diaminopyridine in weeks 4 and 5 had, 


by definition, received 4-aminopyridine for at least four weeks—weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6. 


Polman concludes by teaching the efficacy of prolonged usage of 4-AP: “The finding 


that in the patients who used 4-aminopyridine for intervals varying from 6 to 30 


months (mean, 19 months) before participating in this study the blinded crossovers 


induced clear changes in favor of 4-aminopyridine points to a continued efficacy of 4-


aminopyridine during prolonged usage.” (Id., at 1139.) 


As another example of a POSA’s knowledge concerning the length of 4-AP 


therapy to treat MS, Polman cites to a prior art publication by van Diemen et al., “The 


effect of 4-aminopyridinc on the clinical signs in multiple sclerosis: a randomized, 


placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study,” Ann. Neurol., 32: 123-130 (1992).
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


23 


(Ex. 1007.) van Diemen constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because it was 


published in 1992, more than one year prior to December 11, 2003, the earliest 


priority date of the ’685 patent. van Diemen was not the basis of any Examiner 


rejection during the ’685 patent prosecution. 


van Diemen teaches administering 4-AP to treat MS disability for at least two 


weeks; and specifically, for twelve weeks. (Id. at 124.) The starting dose of the 


treatment was 10 to 15 mg/day in two to three divided doses, and the dose was then 


elevated by an additional 5 to 15 mg/day at weeks 2 and 6, respectively. (Id.) Thus, a 


patient starting with a dose of 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day, would receive 20 mg/day 


when the dose was elevated by 10 mg/day or 5 mg/day, respectively. Efficacy analysis 


was performed only in patients who completed “at least two weeks” of a treatment 


period. (Id. at 125.) van Diemen teaches a statistically significant estimated effect of 4-

administration, which releases the 4-AP over at least a 12-hour period at a rate 


sufficient to achieve therapeutically effective blood levels at 12-24 hours after 


administration. (Id. at 2:32-42.) Masterson teaches a polymer matrix formed by 


blending 4-AP, an excipient, and a polymer to form a homogenous powder for 


controlling the release rate of the 4-AP into the blood stream. (Id. at 2:33-42, 6:24-26.)  


Masterson teaches formulations for twice-daily administration which can 


maintain therapeutically effective blood plasma levels for over 12 hours with peak 


plasma levels (Tmax) occurring between 1 and 10 hours, and especially between 2 and 


8 hours, may be provided by preparing cores formed from a powder mixture 


containing 4-aminopyridine, an excipient and polymeric materials, a major portion of 


which is a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble polymer. (Id. at 4:16-35.) 


Illustrative water soluble polymers include, among others, hydroxypropyl 


methylcellulose (“HPMC”). (Id. at 4:36-40.) 


Alternatively, formations are described in which the active agent, 


pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) and polymeric materials (e.g., HPMC) 


provide an active core. This active core is formed by blending these ingredients, 


shaping the blend into a core, and applying the remainder of the blend with a polymer 


binding solution to form a layered structure on the core. (Id. at 6:13-38.)

The Juarez reference from the 2001 International Journal of Pharmaceutics—


entitled “Influence of admixed carboxymethylcellulose on release of 4-aminopyridine 


from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose matrix tablets,” by Juarez et al.—discloses a 


sustained release 4-AP composition formulated as a matrix with the polymer HPMC. 


(Id. at 116-17.)  


Juarez teaches the preparation of a tablet designed for oral administration 


comprising 4-aminopyridine and a rate of release controlling polymer. Specifically, 


Juarez indicates that “[t]ablets of the model drug 4-aminopyridine with hydroxypropyl 


methylcellulose were prepared with different proportions of polymer content as well 


as with different proportions of admixed carboxymethylcellulose. …” (Id. at 


Abstract.) Juarez further discloses that the purpose of this HPMC matrix is to 


“prolong delivery with zero-order kinetics to maintain a constant in vivo plasma drug 


concentration, and with this to maintain a constant pharmacological effect.” (Id. at 


116.) 


VI. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF CHALLENGE 


A. Ground 1:  Claims 1–8 are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious 
over Goodman (Ex. 1008), in view of Hayes (Ex. 1009) and a POSA’s 
knowledge. 


As supported by the declarations from Dr. Pleasure and Dr. Polli, claims 1–8 


each would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art over the Goodman
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


26 


Poster, in view of the Hayes Poster and a POSA’s knowledge of the art as of 


December 2002. 


i. Claims 1 and 8 are Obvious under Ground 1 


Challenged claims 1 and 8 are directed to methods of treating MS patients by 


administering an extended release formulation of 10 mg 4-AP BID for a time period 


of at least two weeks. (See Ex. 1001.) Although Goodman only explicitly discloses 


administration of an extended release formulation of 10 mg 4-AP BID for 11 days 


(one week and four days), it taught the administration of treatment for several weeks 


with increasing doses. Thus, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the 


art at the time to extend the treatment at the 10 mg BID dose to two or more weeks. 


(Ex. 1013 ¶ 53.) See Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Barr Labs., Inc., 575 F.3d 1341, 1347 


(Fed. Cir. 2009) (affirming invalidity on the basis of “obvious to try,” and explaining 


that “an invention may be found obvious if it would have been obvious to a person 


having ordinary skill to try a course of conduct: ‘When there is a design need or 


market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, 


predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known 


options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is 


likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.’”) 


(quoting KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 421 (U.S. 2007)).
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


27 


Goodman discloses detailed data, results, and conclusions from a placebo-


controlled double-blinded dose ranging study of SR 4-aminopyridine (also referred to 


as sustained release 4-AP or fampridine-SR) in MS patients.  


Goodman notes that the primary aim of this study was to determine the safety 


and tolerability of escalating doses of an oral sustained release formulation of 4-


aminopyridine. (See Ex. 1008, at “Abstract.”) A secondary aim was “to explore 


efficacy over a broad dose range using measures of fatigue and motor function.” (Id. 


at “Abstract.”) Evidence of efficacy and dose response included “Standard MS 


measurements, including timed walk, [and] lower extremity muscle strength . . . .” (Id. 


at “Objectives.”) 


To accomplish these objectives, Goodman discloses that multiple doses of SR 


4-aminopyridine were administered “one week each of 20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 


mg/day, 50 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 70 mg/day and 80 mg/day.” (Id. at “Objectives.”) 


Each dose, in the form of a single tablet, was administered twice daily (i.e., BID)—


every 12 hours. (Id. at “Overview of Study Design.”)  


Goodman’s results indicated patient improvement in a timed 25-foot walk 


compared with baseline at a 10 mg BID and 15 mg BID for a total daily dose of 20 


mg and 30 mg (each improved about 13.5 seconds against the baseline), 20 mg BID 


and 25 mg BID for a total daily dose of 40 mg and 50 mg (about 12.5 seconds against 


the baseline), 30 mg BID for a total daily dose of 60 mg (about 13.5 seconds against 


the baseline), 35 mg BID for a total daily dose of 70 mg (about 13 seconds against the
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


28 


baseline), and 40 mg BID for a total daily dose of 80 mg (about 14 seconds against the 


baseline). (See id. at “Dose Response 25 ft. Walk.”) The improvement in walking speed 


associated with doses of at least 20 mg/day was statistically significant (p=.04) 


compared with the control. (Id. at “Results Summary.”)  A “significant benefit in 


lower extremity strength” also was observed. (Id. at “Conclusions.”) Although there is 


general improvement in mobility speed from 20 mg BID to 40 mg BID, there is no 


improvement, and in fact, a decrease in improvement speeds from 10 mg BID 


compared to 15 mg BID. (Id. at Dose Response 25 Ft. Walk graph.) Accordingly, a 


person skilled in the art would have found that lower dosages at 10 mg BID were as 


successful as 15 mg BID—and a POSA would have also learned that the benefits to 


walking from higher doses was marginal. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 33.) 


The study concluded that there was demonstrated “[e]vidence of dose-response 


in 20–40 mg/day range.” (Id. at “Conclusions.”) However, the study cautioned that 


“[a]t doses above 40 mg/day (i.e. twice daily at 20 mg), more severe adverse events 


were reported, including cases of seizure . . . .” (Id. at “Results Summary.”) In this 


same regard, the study concluded that there was “[l]ittle added benefit, and increased 


risk, at doses above 50 mg/day.” (Id. at “Conclusions.”)  


Just as important as Goodman’s disclosure of a 10 mg BID of 4-AP is the 


disclosure of the range between 10 mg to 40 mg BID. (Id. at Abstract.) A person of 


ordinary skill in the art would have begun studies on dosing starting at 10 mg BID in 


light of Goodman because customary practice in the industry was to start at the
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


29 


lowest accepted range in order to attempt to minimize potential adverse side effects of 


the drug. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 34.) As noted, Goodman also discloses that undesirable side 


effects were indeed noted at higher dosing regimens. Therefore one of ordinary skill 


in the art at the time of Goodman would have been motivated to administer doses of 


sustained release 4-AP no higher than 20 mg BID in order to minimize the adverse 


side effects Goodman describes. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 32.)  


Further, although Goodman doesn’t explicitly disclose a regimen for a time 


period of “at least two weeks,” a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been 


motivated to test durations for periods far past two weeks in chronic illnesses, such as 


MS. (Ex. 1013 ¶ 36.) See Hoffmann La Roche, Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 748 F.3d 1326, 1332 


(Fed. Cir. 2014) (affirming finding that 150 mg monthly dose was obvious to try, in 


view of disclosed weekly doses of 35 mg, 40 mg, 45 mg, or 50 mg, because “[t]here 


was a need to solve the problem of patient compliance by looking to less-frequent 


dosing regimens. And…there were only a ‘finite number of identified, predictable 


solutions.’”) (quoting KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex, 550 U.S. 398, 421 (2007)).  


At 10 mg BID, Dr. Pleasure testifies that a POSA knew from Goodman that 


the side effects from administering 4-AP would be minimized when compared to 


higher doses, because of the adverse side effects at 40 mg BID. (Ex. 1013 ¶ 40.) He 


further testifies that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have seen from the 


Goodman results that doses of 10 mg BID fampridine-SR showed statistically 


significant improvement in walking speed as compared to baseline and also resulted in
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


30 


fewer side effects. (Id., ¶ 28.) See also Abbott Labs v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., 452 F.3d 1331, 


1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding substantial question of invalidity because the 


combination of references for “the reduction of systemic side effects would not be 


surprising and would not be unexpected.”). 


A POSA would have fully expected this trend to continue upon extending the 


treatment for multiple weeks in MS, a chronic illness. (Ex. 1013, ¶ 36.) See Sciele 


Pharma, Inc. v. Lupin Ltd., 684 F.3d 1253, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding substantial 


question of validity because “‘[i]f a person of ordinary skill can implement a 


predictable variation, § 103 likely bars its patentability’”) (KSR, 550 U.S. at 418). 


A secondary aim of Goodman was “to explore efficacy over a broad dose range 


using measures of fatigue and motor function.” (See Ex. 1008, at “Abstract.”) A dose 


response curve disclosed by Goodman in support of the conclusion shows that there 


are no significant increases in efficacy between 10 mg BID and 25 mg BID. (Id.) Thus, 


upon considering the actual dose response curve, Dr. Pleasure attests that a POSA 


would have reasonably concluded that the difference in efficacy from doses of 10 mg 


BID to 20 mg BID was insignificant. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 28.)  


Goodman taught a finite number of doses that were most desirable from the 


perspective of efficacy and avoidance of side effects, i.e., 20 mg/day (10 mg BID), 30 


mg/day and 40 mg/day. (See Ex. 1008.) Based on the information available to one of 


ordinary skill in the art as of December 2002, Dr. Pleasure attests that a POSA would 


have known that a 10 mg/day BID would provide the best chance to avoid side
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


31 


effects considering the insignificant differences in mobility from 10 mg/day BID to 


20 mg/day BID or higher. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 28.) See Tyco Healthcare Grp. LP v. Mut. 


Pharm. Co., 642 F.3d 1370, 1371–72 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (affirming summary judgment of 


invalidity on the basis that it would have been obvious to administer a medication at 


the lowest disclosed efficacious range since “‘physicians always seek to prescribe the 


lowest effective dose of any medication,’” particularly in the case of “patients sensitive 


to the side effects of” the medication).  


Although the challenged claims include a limitation that the treatment duration 


be for “at least two weeks,” considering the chronic nature of MS, a person of 


ordinary skill in the art at that time would have needed to do little, if any, 


experimentation to arrive at the conclusion that the lowest dosage of 10 mg BID 


would be beneficial to the patient, and such benefit would extend in duration from 


one week to multiple weeks. (See Ex. 1013 ¶ 53.) See Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 


1348, 1367–68 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that where, as here, “one skilled in the art 


would have had a reasonable expectation of success at the time the invention was 


made, and merely had to verify that expectation,…[t]he experimentation needed, then, 


to arrive at the subject matter claimed in the [] patent was nothing more than routine 


application of a well-known problem-solving strategy, and…the work of a skilled 


[artisan], not of an inventor.”) (citation omitted).  


Dr. Pleasure’s declaration establishes that in chronic illnesses, drug treatments 


lasting multiple weeks are common. (Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 44-46, citing Exs. 1032, 1007.)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


32 


Because MS is a chronic illness affecting mobility, ongoing therapies that would 


extend to at least two weeks are well within the range that a POSA would have 


investigated prior to December 2002. (Id. ¶¶ 35, 36.) Further, Dr. Pleasure testifies 


that a POSA prior to December 2002 would have recognized that those afflicted with 


MS would be appropriate candidates for the administration of 4-aminopyridine—not 


only for a short period of time such as one week, but for an ongoing basis, including 


two weeks and more. (Id. at ¶36.) See Sciele Pharma, Inc., 684 F.3d at 1259 (Fed. Cir. 


2012) (The obviousness analysis entails ‘an expansive and flexible approach.’…“There 


need not be ‘precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged 


claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person 


of ordinary skill in the art would employ.’”) (quoting KSR, 550 U.S. at 418). 


Thus, a POSA prior to December 2002 “would have had both a reason to 


continue the administration of SR 4-aminopyridine at the relatively low dose level 


noted previously (10 mg BID) over a course of multiple weeks, and more than a 


reasonable expectation that this dosage regimen would provide enhanced mobility in 


MS patients,” (e.g., improved walking) over that same time period based on the prior 


art clinical studies which demonstrated the efficacy of this regimen in those patients. 


(Ex. 1013 ¶ 45.) See also KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416–17 (2007) 


(holding that where a straightforward combination of references “[s]imply arranges 


old elements with each performing the same function it had been known to perform
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


33 


and yields no more than one would expect from such an arrangement, the 


combination is obvious.”) (internal quotations and citations omitted). 


Further, Dr. Pleasure attests that a POSA would have knowledge of a number 


of studies and references teaching long-term administration of 4-AP to treat MS. The 


Hayes reference cites Polman, which teaches a POSA about studies “that 


administered 4-aminopyridine for between 6-30 months, and for a six week time 


period, and specifically touted its benefit as a ‘superior’ drug (compared to other 


aminopyridines) for prolonged administration, which would have specifically 


motivated a POSA to administer the 4-aminopyridine for at least two weeks.” (Ex. 


1013, ¶ 43.) Likewise, Polman cites the van Diemen 1992 reference (Ex. 1007), which 


“teaches administering 4-AP to treat MS disability for at least two weeks; and 


specifically, for twelve weeks.” (Ex. 1013, ¶ 44, citing Ex. 1007 at 124.) van Diemen’s 


disclosure of dose administration is striking in its similarity to the ’685 specification. 


(Compare Ex. 1007 at 124, with Ex. 1001 at 6:37–48.) 


ii. Claims 2–7 are Obvious under Ground 1 


Goodman does not explicitly disclose the pharmacokinetic parameters 


disclosed in claims 2–7. However, the Hayes reference when combined with 


Goodman discloses each and every element of claims 2–7.  


The Hayes reference presents data, results, and conclusions from an “open 


label, 4-week study conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of 


multiple oral doses of fampridine-SR (sustained release 4-aminopyridine).” (Ex. 1009
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


34 


at 2, 3.) The doses of fampridine-SR administered during the study were 10, 15, 20 or 


25 mg BID for one week, in an ascending manner. (Id.) Steady state plasma 


concentrations were achieved by Day 5. (Id. at 3.) 


Table 2 of Hayes provides pharmacokinetic data. The data for 10 mg BID (i.e., 


20 mg/day total) as set forth in that table is as follows: Cave: 20.8 (±5.7) ng/mL; Tmax: 


2.7(±1.0) hours. (Id. at Table 2.) Figure 1 teaches mean plasma concentrations for 


each dose of AP over time. (Id. at Figure 1.) The 10 mg BID dosing shows that 4-AP 


attains a steady state in the plasma at about 22 ng/mL at 6 hours after administration, 


at about 10 ng/mL at 12 hours after administration, and does not approach 0 ng/mL 


until after about 20 hours following administration. (Id. at 4.)  


These data correspond to the pharmacokinetic parameters recited in claims 3 


and 4. (See Ex. 1001.) Claim 3 requires a release profile of 4-aminopyridine extended 


over at least 6 hours—Figure 1 reports that fampridine remains in the plasma at about 


22 ng/mL at 6 hours after administration, and thus meets the requirement of claim 3. 


(See Ex. 1009, at 4.) Claim 4 requires a release profile of 4-aminopyridine extended 


over at least 12 hours—Figure 1 reports that measurable amounts of 4-aminopyridine 


remains in the plasma at 12 hours after administration which meets the claim 


requirement. (See Ex. 1001.) 


Under Hayes, these pharmacokinetic results are demonstrated from 


administering the composition at a dose of 10 mg BID, irrespective of the duration of 


the dosing duration (one week, two weeks, or longer). (See Ex. 1009, at pg. 3)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


35 


Although the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the administration of sustained 


release 4-AP as set forth in claims 2–5 were not specifically mentioned in Goodman, 


Dr. Polli testifies that the Hayes reference establishes that one of ordinary skill in the 


art would have known that 10 mg BID achieves the claimed pharmacokinetic 


parameters. (Ex. 1035 ¶¶ 24-26.) It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill 


in the art that the similar dosing compositions, formulations, and regimens disclosed 


by both Goodman and Hayes would have exhibited similar pharmacokinetics over 


similar periods of time (Tmax) without undue experimentation. (Id.) See Santarus, Inc. v. 


Par Pharm., Inc., 694 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming obviousness where 


“an obvious formulation cannot become nonobvious simply by administering it to a 


patient and claiming the resulting serum concentrations. To hold otherwise would 


allow any formulation—no matter how obvious—to become patentable merely by 


testing and claiming an inherent property.”) (citation omitted). 


Thus, as the above evidence including Dr. Polli’s declaration establish, the 


claim limitations in claims 2 through 7 would have been obvious to a person skilled in 


the art based on Goodman, in view of Hayes. (See Ex. 1035 ¶¶ 24-32.) This evidence 


is specified in further detail in the following claim chart.

B. Ground 2:  Claims 1–4 and 6–8 are invalid under 103(a) as obvious 
over Goodman (Ex. 1008) in view of Masterson (Ex. 1010) and POSA 
knowledge. 


Claims 1 and 8 are obvious in light of Goodman and a POSA’s knowledge of 


the state of the art as evidenced by Polman and van Diemen. And even though
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


44 


Goodman does not explicitly disclose the pharmacokinetic parameters of claims 2–4, 


a rate controlling polymer of claim 6 or homogeneously dispersed polymer that is 


suitable for controlling the release rate of the 4-aminopyridine of claim 7, the use of 


these rate controlling polymers was well known in the art, and Dr. Polli testifies that it 


would have been obvious to a POSA to combine them with Goodman in view of 


Masterson. (See Ex. 1035 ¶¶ 43, 46.) See Par Pharm., Inc. v. TWi Pharms., Inc., 773 F.3d 


1186, 1197 (2014) (stating that “the motivation to combine does not have to be 


explicitly stated in the prior art, and can be supported by testimony of an expert 


witness regarding knowledge of a person of skill in the art at the time of invention”). 


Masterson is a prior art reference that discloses a matrix core that uses the same type 


of release control polymer as matrices with the administration of 4-AP, and one of 


ordinary skill in the art would have applied the same type of release control polymer 


to Goodman to achieve the predictable result of a slower release. (See Ex. 1035, ¶19.) 


Masterson discloses a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a mono- or di-


aminopyridine (e.g., 4-aminopyridine) for administration on a once- or twice-daily 


basis which releases the aminopyridine over not less than a 12 hour period and at a 


rate sufficient to achieve therapeutically effective blood levels over a period of 12-24 


hours after administration. (See Ex. 1010, at col. 2, ll. 32–42.)  


Formulations for “twice-daily administration which can maintain 


therapeutically effective blood plasma levels for over 12 hours with peak plasma levels 


(Tmax) occurring between 1 and 10 hours, and especially between 2 and 8 hours,” were
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


45 


provided by preparing a powder mixture containing 4-aminopyridine, an excipient, 


and polymeric materials, a major portion of which was a pharmaceutically acceptable 


water soluble polymer. (Id. at col. 4, ll. 16–35.) Illustrative water soluble polymers 


include, among others, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (“HPMC”). (Id. col. 4, ll. 36–


40.) Goodman teaches a sustained release composition, but does not explicitly show 


how the 4-aminopyridine is dispersed with a rate release controlling polymer.  


However, Masterson (Ex. 1010) teaches that 4-aminopyridine (col 1: 52–61; col 


2: 33–42) is dispersed using a rate of release controlling polymer (col 3:2–6; col 6:15–


18). Thus, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine 


the teachings of Goodman with Masterson because they both sought to control the 


release of drug throughout a longer period. See Tyco Healthcare Grp. LP v. Ethicon Endo-


Surgery, Inc., 774 F.3d 968, 112 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1979, 1987(Fed. Cir. 2014) (“When 


a claimed invention involves a combination of elements, however, any need or 


problem known in the relevant field of endeavor at the time of invention can provide 


a reason to combine.”). 


Furthermore, Goodman specifically references fampridine-SR as the particular 


form of 4-AP used for oral administration to MS patients. Dr. Polli attests that 


fampridine SR comprises a ‘matrix’ formulation and is a standard matrix-type SR 


formulation at the time of the invention. (See Ex. 1035, ¶ 20.) Thus, one of ordinary 


skill in the art would have understood that Goodman incorporated its own release 


control matrix to control the release rate of the 4-AP active ingredient. (Id. at 23.)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


46 


Goodman discloses a fampridine SR at a dosage regimen in MS patients at 10 


mg BID. Although Goodman does not explicitly disclose descriptions of a rate-


controlling polymer, Dr. Polli explains that the matrix type SR formulation of 


Goodman includes polymeric materials that provide release control for the drug. (See 


Ex. 1035, ¶ 45.) The Masterson formulations include “active agent, pharmaceutically 


acceptable excipient(s), and polymeric materials” (e.g., HPMC) that provide an active 


core. (Ex. 1010, at col. 6, ll. 12–21.) This active core is formed by blending these 


ingredients, shaping the blend into a core, and coating the remainder of the blend 


with a polymer binding solution to form a layered structure on the core. (Id. at col. 6, 


ll. 13–38.) 


Masterson teaches that formulations for twice-daily administration which can 


maintain therapeutically effective blood plasma levels for over 12 hours with peak 


plasma levels (Tmax) occurring between 1 and 10 hours, and especially between 2 and 8 


hours, may be provided by preparing cores formed from a powder mixture containing 


4-aminopyridine, an excipient and polymeric materials, a major portion of which is a 


pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble polymer. (Id. at col. 4, ll. 16- 35.) Illustrative 


water soluble polymers include, among others, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 


(“HPMC”). (Id. at col. 4, ll. 36–40.) Thus, in addition to claims 2 through 4, Goodman 


in view of Masterson discloses rate-controlling polymers as claimed in claims 6 and 7, 


and those challenged claims are obvious. (Ex. 1035, ¶ 45.) The following detailed 


claim chart identifying the specific prior art evidence and relevant expert testimony
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


47 


establishes the obviousness of Claims 1-4 and 6-8 from Goodman in view of 


Masterson.

6. The method 
of claim 1, 
wherein the 4-

Goodman does not specifically recite the 4-aminopyridine is 
dispersed in a rate of release controlling polymer. 


Masterson teaches the 4-aminopyridine is dispersed in a rate of 
release controlling polymer. 


Ex. 1010 at 2:65-3:9 (“water insoluble polymer and optionally a 
minor proportion of a pharmaceutically acceptable film-forming, 
water soluble polymer, the number of layers in said membrane and

Goodman teaches a sustained release composition as above, but 
not specifically wherein the composition comprises a matrix in 
which the 4-aminopyridine is homogenously dispersed that is 
suitable for controlling the release rate of the 4-aminopyridine. 


Ex. 1008 at Background and Study Rationale (“a sustained release 
oral formulation of Fampridine (Fampridine-SR) was 
developed.”). 


Masterson teaches a sustained release composition, but not 
specifically wherein the composition comprises a matrix in which 
the 4-aminopyridine is homogenously dispersed that is suitable for 
controlling the release rate of the 4-aminopyridine. 


Ex. 1010 at 5:47-49 (“The mono- or di-aminopyridine and 
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) are blended to form a

8. The method 
of claim 1, 
wherein the step 
of administering 
comprises b.i.d. 
administering or 
administering at 
12 hour

Goodman teaches the step of administering comprises b.i.d. 
administering or administering at 12 hour intervals, as above. 


Ex. 1008 at Overview of Study Design (“Study Visit 1, 10 mg q 
12h. Doses shown are individual doses, to be taken q12h.”); see also 


Ex. 1008 at Abstract (“dose escalation protocol started…20 
mg/day (10 mg po BID) the second week…”). 


Masterson also teaches the step of administering comprises b.i.d. 
administering or administering at 12 hour intervals. 


Ex. 1010 at col 4:17-19 (“Pharmaceutical formulations according 
to the invention for twice-daily administration can maintain 
therapeutically effective blood levels substantially over 12 hours.”).





C. Ground 3:  Claims 6–7 are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious 
over Goodman (Ex. 1008) in view of Juarez (Ex. 1018). 


Goodman and a POSA’s knowledge render claim 1 obvious for the detailed 


reasons previously set forth. Claims 6 and 7 each depend from claim 1. Although 


Goodman does not explicitly disclose the rate-controlling polymer of claim 6 or a 


“matrix in which the 4-aminopyridine is homogeneously dispersed that is suitable for
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


54 


controlling the release rate of the 4-aminopyridine” of claim 7, the use of controlled 


release polymers as described in claims 6 and 7 was well known in the art—and 


specifically for 4-AP. (See Ex. 1018, passim.) 


Juarez uses matrices to control the release of the active ingredient in a tablet. 


(Id.) Juarez tested Tablets of 4-aminopyridine with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 


prepared with different proportions of polymer content as well as with different 


proportions of admixed carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in the range up to 35% (based 


on the total polymer content). (Id. at Abstract.) Dr. Polli’s declaration explains that a 


POSA would understand that “the Juarez document teaches very clearly that 4-


aminopyridine could be readily and easily formulated into a useful rate of release 


controlling polymer, more commonly known as a sustained release composition, using 


universally known compounds such as HPMC. One of ordinary skill in the art, upon 


reading the Juarez document, would have understood that the Juarez document 


discloses 4-aminopyridine formulated into a rate of release controlling polymer and 


even further that composition comprises a matrix in which the 4-aminopyridine is 


homogeneously dispersed that is suitable for controlling the release rate of the 4-


aminopyridine.” (Ex. 1035, ¶ 38.) 


Dr. Polli further attests that “a POSA would have been motivated to combine 


Goodman with Juarez in an effort to provide a sustained-release composition of 4-AP 


for oral administration in an effort to maintain desirable in vivo plasma concentrations 


to maintain a constant pharmacological effect.” (Id., ¶ 39.)
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


55 


Juarez showed that decreasing release constant values show a logarithmic 


relationship with increasing values of the exponent n. (Ex. 1018 at 121.) This indicates 


that zero-order release occurs with sufficiently reduced release rate. (Id.) Or in other 


words, there were no significant increases in dissolution when then controlled release 


polymer was used with reduced release rates. (Id.) As such, one of ordinary skill in the 


art would have understood that the polymer release means used in the dosages of 10 


mg of 4-AP BID were predictable and obvious. (See Ex. 1035, ¶¶ 40-41.) See Tyco 


Healthcare Group LP, 774 F.3d 968, 112 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) at 1986 (“Claims would 


have been obvious if they are nothing more than a combination of familiar elements 


that yield predictable results.”). 


Thus, Dr. Polli’s testimony and the Juarez reference establish that a person of 


ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the references of 


Goodman and Juarez to yield the predictable result of a release-controlled drug 


claimed in claims 6 and 7. (Ex. 1035, ¶¶ 33-41.)

Goodman teaches a sustained release composition, but not 
specifically wherein the 4-aminopyridine is dispersed in a rate

VII. ANY SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO 
OVERCOME A FINDING THAT CLAIMS 1–8 ARE OBVIOUS 


The Applicants submitted no evidence showing secondary considerations of 


non-obviousness during prosecution of the ‘685 patent. The Applicant has the burden 


of establishing the existence and sufficiency of such secondary considerations, as well 


the burden of establishing nexus commensurate with the claims. See Ex parte Gelles, 22 


USPQ2d 1318, 1319 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992). They did not do so during 


prosecution of the challenged claims—and did not even do so during prosecution of 


the parent ‘826 patent when the Applicants attempted to put forth evidence of 


secondary considerations in support of claims not challenged here.  


The purported secondary considerations raised in the ‘826 parent patent 


prosecution history fail to even mention any treatment duration of “at least two
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


58 


weeks,” nor was there any connection to alleged secondary considerations related to 


extended treatments of 4-AP to MS patients. An Interview Summary dated November 


10, 2010 describes a Today show episode video recording that was shown to the 


Examiner. Applicant claimed that “Ampyra can be considered a break-through, not 


only because it targets walking ability, but also because it is an oral drug.”  (Ex. 1041 


(citing the video at 4:18, 4:58, 5:48).) Notably absent from this explanation is the dose 


amount, or a dosing regimen for “at least [a] two week” period—the allegedly novel 


aspect of the sole independent claim of the ’685 patent. Oral drugs targeting the 


walking ability of MS patients were well-known in the prior art more than a decade 


before the ’685 patent, as explained in detail in the instant Petition’s grounds for 


obviousness. Thus, there was no connection between the puffery on the Today show 


and the claims of the ‘685 patent.  


The Applicants also submitted a declaration by Andrew R. Blight in the parent 


prosecution that allegedly showed the “surprising results” to show that their scientific 


findings were unexpected in overcoming the obviousness rejection. (See Ex. 1044.)  


Blight’s declaration states that “it was surprising that a 10 mg dose was as effective as 


a 20 mg dose is further evidence by the recognition in the art of 4-AP’s narrow 


therapeutic window and the bias in the art toward using larger dosage amount than 


those recited in the instant claims.” But as previously established, Goodman 


disclosed that dosages at 10 mg/day BID were just as effective as 20 mg/day 


BID. One of ordinary skill in the art would not have considered doses of 10 mg/day
Patent No. 8,663,685 
 


59 


BID to be surprising in light of Goodman. (See generally Ground 1.) To support 


conclusions of unexpected results, the evidence asserted as unexpected must actually 


have been obtained. (See, e.g., In re Klosak, 455 F.2d 1077, 1080 (CCPA 1973). 


Moreover, the evidence must include a comparison with the closest prior art. (See, e.g., 


In re Merchant, 575 F.2d 865, 869 (CCPA 1978). The Applicant had no evidence for 


either of these requirements. 


There exists no independent data that describes the unexpected result from an 


“at least two week” period of treatment when compared to shorter treatments. (See 


Ex. 1001.) Superiority of, or difference in, results, if not shown to be unexpected, is 


insufficient. (See, e.g., In re Dill, 604 F.2d 1356, 1361 (CCPA 1979). 


In any event, the Examiner of the parent patent did not cite, rely on, or even 


mention secondary considerations as a factor for issuing the parent claims. Thus, the 


burden is on the Patent Owner to come forward with such evidence in the event trial 


is instituted and it is not Petitioner’s burden to address potential secondary 


considerations where no evidence or nexus was put forth during prosecution of the 


challenged claims, and when the Examiner of the parent application did not make any 


findings related to secondary considerations. 


VIII. CONCLUSION 


Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests inter partes 


review of claims 1–8 of U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685.
