How China Borun Has Exaggerated Its Financial Performance

This article is a follow up to my previous article, “China New Borun: Born to Run or
Destined to Fall”, and adds considerable new evidence to my argument that BORN has
significantly exaggerated its financial performance.


I. Massive Undisclosed Debts, Tax Losses and Black Market Sales


To get a better picture of BORN’s true financials, I recently obtained copies of Borun
Shandong’s (BORN’s main operating subsidiary) official tax records from the very
resourceful people at GeoInvesting.com (see endnote). As I have explained before and as
other experts generally agree, SAT records are very reliable since the Chinese
government imposes severe penalties on companies that fail to pay taxes. Following a
thorough review, I have identified several major discrepancies between these tax records
and BORN’s F-1 filed with the SEC.


The first major discrepancy that stands out in BORN’s 2009 SAT record is the large
amount of debt compared to its F-1 filed with the SEC. The following table shows at
12/31/09 Shandong Borun had short-term borrowing of RMB 320,800,000 while its F-1
filing only shows RMB 140,000,000, a difference of RMB 180,800,000. Even after
deducting the approximately RMB 80,000,000 additional cash shown in the SAT record
compared to the F-1 filing, the short-term borrowing is still more than RMB 100,000,000
higher than the amount disclosed in its F-1 filing. Furthermore, the SAT record shows
there is RMB 170,000,000 additional long term debt Shandong Borun borrowed in 2009
which is not disclosed in BORN’s F-1 filing. Is it just a coincidence that BORN hid RMB
170,000,000 in new long-term debt the same year they reported RMB 166,410,631 in net
income to their investors?

BORN and Shandong Borun Liabilities and Shareholders Equity at 12/31/08 and
12/31/09:


Based on its SAT record, Shandong Borun was highly leveraged and on the brink of
bankruptcy at the end of 2009. Its shareholder equity was only a miserable RMB
70,335,058 compared to RMB 516,209,389 BORN reported in its F-1 filing. Shandong
Borun’s staggering debt to equity ratio of 7.5 is an incredible 15X the 0.5 ratio BORN’s
public shareholders can calculate from its filings. The SAT record also shows a cumulative
loss of RMB 60,864,942 rather than the RMB 288,950,593 retained earnings BORN
reported in its F-1 filing. Clearly the company’s historical growth was supported only by its
debt and equity financing activity and not by cash flow from operations, which was
consistently negative according to the SAT record.


As the following table clearly shows, Shandong Borun’s revenues, income tax and
net income for 2008 and 2009 are significantly understated in its filings with the
SAT. Shockingly, Shandong Borun paid no income tax and reported losses of RMB
8,178,212 and RMB 24,624,218 in 2008 and 2009 respectively while BORN in its SEC F-1
filing claims it paid income tax of RMB 26,640,990 and RMB 56,262,029 on net income of
RMB 77,130,128 and RMB 166,410,631 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Furthermore,
SAT records show Shandong Borun’s sales were only RMB 141,990,308 and RMB

138,509,566 in 2008 and 2009 respectively versus the SEC F-1 filing which shows RMB
615,881,195 and RMB 1,060,493,812. For 2009, Shandong Borun reported gross margin
of 5.5% compared to 23.4% BORN disclosed in its F-1 filing.


BORN and Shandong Borun Income Statements for 2008 and 2009:


Given the huge discrepancies, investors should demand management answer:


1. What did management do with the cash from at least RMB 270,000,000 in previously
undisclosed debts?


2. Why are BORN’s sales reported in its SEC F-1 filing incredibly over 4X (for 2008) and
7X (for 2009) the sales it reported to the SAT?


3. Why is BORN’s 2009 gross profit margin in its SAT record less than ¼ of the level
reported in its F-1 filing?


4. Why do BORN’s tax records show substantial losses?
5. Where did the RMB 26,640,990 and RMB 56,262,029 of income taxes BORN never


actually paid really go?


Together, these large discrepancies further support the conclusions of my previous article
(link here) which showed BORN significantly overstated its gross margin by 3X and
earnings per share by 4-5X in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the company’s antiquated

technology, understated input costs and fabricated corn germ sales. Add to these troubles
the fact the tax records show the financial condition of the company is even worse.


According to GeoTeam’s website, they “made numerous attempts to discuss this issue
with BORN management and its IR firm, but have not received a meaningful response.”
Likewise, I have been unable to get a response from management. Nor do any of the
analysts who follow the company have answers. Considering BORN’s extremely low gross
margins, I believe a partial explanation of the low sales and losses BORN reported to the
SAT is tax avoidance. My industry contacts explain that tax avoidance via black market
sales is the only way inefficient operators like BORN can survive. The motives for this are
clear.


First of all, consider the fact that edible alcohol manufacturers face unusually heavy tax
burdens that encourage large-scale tax evasion and black market sales. In fact, for all the
alcohol produced BORN must pay 17% VAT tax and 5% consumption tax but can only
deduct 13% VAT paid on its key input corn (In China VAT tax on corn is only 13%). In fact,
since BORN is such an inefficient producer without advanced processing technology for
making enough corn germ and CO2 byproducts the challenge to survive further compels
BORN to evade VAT and consumption tax by engaging in black market sales it did not
report to SAT in 2008 and 2009. These black market sales explain why BORN’s current
customer base is limited to small and medium sized “baijiu” brands willing to collude with
BORN to evade tax. Top tier state owned brands like Moutai (SHE: 600519), Luzhou
Laojiao (SHE: 000568) and Wuliangye (SHE: 000858) will not help BORN evade tax
through undocumented sales.


II. Further Analysis of the antiquated “Borun Wet Process”


In a research article titled “A Comparison between the Modified Wet Method and Semi-Dry
Method Corn Processing Technologies in Ethanol Plants” (酒精工厂改良湿法与半干法玉米
处理工艺的对比)published in the authoritative trade journal “Cereal and Food Industry”
(2010 Volume 17 Number 3 粮食与食品工业期刊2010年第17卷第3期), four types of corn
processing technologies (Dry, Semi-Dry, Modified Wet and Wet) are compared based on
technological and economical indicators (see table below):

From this table, the researchers conclude, “The dry method cannot recover any
byproducts such as corn oil. The wet method has a very high production cost. Therefore
as a result both methods have been abandoned”. The researchers go on to point out the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/232553-how-china-borun-has-exaggerated-its-financial-performance 6/32


inherent flaws in the wet method, which create long production cycles (long duration of the
soaking cycle), high electricity consumption, large investment requirements (equipment)
and high operating costs. The researchers ultimately favor a “modified” wet-method but
note that this method has not been successfully applied on a large scale in China due to
technical barriers.


Borun’s existing patent covers a non-modified wet method of production. According to the
Invention Patent Application for “Corn Fermentation based Ethanol Production Method”
filed by Shandong Borun Industrial on April 15 2008: “This invention involves a wet
method of corn germ extraction, specifically a wet method of corn germ extraction and
fermentation for ethanol production.”


The details of Borun’s wet method disclosed in the patent application include a long
soaking process for the corn of 48-50 hours, typical of other wet methods. By comparison,
the next generation modified wet method analyzed in the research article only requires 6-
12 hours of soaking. The “Borun Wet Method” that BORN management has so
emphatically hyped to shareholders is in fact merely a minor modification and
improvement of the typical wet method, which according to all reports is antiquated as an
alcohol production method in China.


Another research article titled “Take Another Look at Semi-Dry Grinding Method for
Ethanol Plants” (对酒精厂玉米半干法粉碎的重新认识)published in the trade journal Liquor
Making (November 2001, Volume 28, Number 6 酿酒2001年11月28卷第6期) analyzes
COFCO’s 200,000 ton semi-dry process plant in Zhaodong and concludes that the semi-
dry method is more profitable than the wet method. The researchers mention in the article
that the Shandong Jiujiu wet method plant was under construction at the time of
publication. Recall BORN’s CTO Wei Qi was previously the CTO of Jiujiu which later filed
for bankruptcy.


Most importantly, as I pointed out in my prior article, BORN management is clearly aware
of its antiquated wet process method and recently hired Henan Wantongtong Machine
Manufacture Corp., Ltd to upgrade its wet method production lines to the superior semi-
dry method used by most large edible alcohol manufacturers in China.


Conclusion:


As of the date of this article, BORN management and IR team have failed to respond to
the questions raised in my prior article. Nor have they responded to analyst or investor
inquiries regarding these issues. Piper Jaffray’s senior analyst Anson Chan recently raised
his price target for BORN by 127% from $9.70 to an outrageous $22.00 based on his
