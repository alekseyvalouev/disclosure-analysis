Windstream Tech (WSTI) –
More Evidence that
Significant Capital May Be
Needed To Sustain
Operations
July 7, 2014 By stoup


Windstream Tech (WSTI) CEO made the following
statement it its rebuttal statement to our short thesis
article published on Seeking Alpha on 7/1/2014.


The CEO stated:


“An article contends that contracts, distribution
agreements and past pilot successes with ACC
Limited, Meytek Group, Key City Trading, Suka
Wind & Solar, Senan Liberia, Inc., Africa Energy
Limited and Viza Networks, Limited are not real
and states “as is often the case with P&D’s, most
of these customers are located in emerging
markets.”


We never said that these agreements were not real. But we
are questioning the company’s ability to execute its
contracts, unless it raises a substantial amount of capital.


WSTI’s Q1 2014 filing


The following two passages, not included in our original
article, from WSTI’s Q1 2014 filing bring this point home,

one even showing that the company has been in default on
one of its loans since 2012:


“We estimate that within the next 12 months we
will need substantial cash and liquidity for
operations, and we do not have sufficient
cash on hand to meet this requirement.” 2013

“WindStream has a history of recurring losses
from operations and has an accumulated deficit
of $10,480,672 as of December 31, 2013.
Management is unable to predict if and when we
will be to generate positive cash flow. As a result,
there is substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our plan regarding
these matters is to raise additional debt and/or
equity financing to allow us the ability to cover
our current cash flow requirements and meet our
obligations as they become due.” 2013 10K


“Our ability to pay key suppliers on time will
allow us to effectively manage our business.
Currently we have a large outstanding
liability with our product manufacturer that
is inhibiting us from receiving additional
units at this time. In addition, we have
other large outstanding accounts payable
with key suppliers that may inhibit the
Company from receiving system product in
the future.” 2013 10K


“In July 2011, the Company entered into a
$1,400,000 note agreement with the City of
North Vernon, Indiana. Interest accrues at 5.5%

March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the
note had an outstanding balance of $1,400,000.
The Company was unable to pay the interest and
principal payments due on August 1, 2012 and
was in default of such payment. The Company
was able to negotiate payment terms with the
City of North Vernon, Indiana, which allowed the
Company to delay scheduled repayments of the
loan. During the three months ended March 31,
2014 and March 31, 2013, the Company made
$0 and $0, respectively, in payments to the City
of North Vernon for accrued interest.” Q1 2014


 WindStream needs funding


Also, here is a quote from an article where it clearly
mentions it needs funding to fulfill its Jamaican contract:


“If we are successful in executing this contract
and are able to secure the needed capital to fulfill
this large order, at current rates, this could
potentially result in greater than US$120 million
of revenue to WindStream,” stated the company
in a notice to shareholders obtained by the
BusinessObserver.”


“This contract calls for US$14.5 million of
products to begin delivery in first quarter of
2014,” stated Windstream about its Jamaica
contract.”


To our knowledge, the company had not filled meaningful
parts of  this order during its Q1 2014.
