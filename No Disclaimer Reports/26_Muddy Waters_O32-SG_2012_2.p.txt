Underwater – US$49.2 million Olam rice farm on the Benue River (Nigeria) flood plain.  
 





• Olam runs a high risk of failure. Its “asset heavy” 
strategy appears to be an off-the-rails CapEx and 
acquisition binge. Management talks about the 
“gestation” of these projects, but our research makes 
clear that they are marred by incompetence and perhaps 
significant misconduct. The vast majority of the 
acquisitions we have researched are of low quality assets 
that appear to bring little more than cosmetic benefits to 
Olam. In short, these projects are “pie in the sky” that 
we strongly believe are destroying substantial amounts 
of capital. 


• Bondholders in particular should be asking where their 
money goes (and how will they get it back). Olam has 
spent S$571.0 million less on acquisitions than 
announced. However, it has spent S$996.2 million on 
unattributed non-acquisition CapEx – most of it since 
FY2011. One possible interpretation is that Olam is 
doing far more greenfield projects than realized, which 
greatly increases its risk profile. Another possible 
interpretation is that Olam has problems with internal 
controls and significant cash leakage.  


• Over the years, Olam has committed a shocking number 
of accounting gaffes. We can conceive of two possible 
interpretations of its accounting track record – either its 
accounting functions are blithely incompetent; or, there 
could be malfeasance. (Both could be true as well.) The 
former interpretation has ominous implications for 
Olam’s oft self-promoted ability to manage risk. The 
latter interpretation obviously has even more dire 
implications.  


• We believe it is instructive to view Olam through the 
lens of failed US trader Enron Corp. There are a number 
of material similarities in the way their businesses 
developed, and their action. 


• We value Olam on a liquidation basis because our 
opinion is that it is likely to fail. In the event of a 
liquidation, we estimate the present value of unsecured 
bonds to be 14 to 33 cents on the dollar.  The equity 
would likely be wiped out, or given “nuisance value” at 
best.

Introduction	
  
Olam is an extreme example of an increasingly important conflict in modern finance: the 
clash between accounting and business reality.  When accounting gets the upper hand, the 
results can be toxic for investors – particularly when combined with heavy debt levels.  
Our main problem with Olam, though, is not that it has significant non-cash earnings and 
high debt levels.  We believe that Olam’s fatal flaw, and one of its best kept secrets, is 
that its CapEx projects seem to be a fiscal black hole.  Olam’s insistence that investors 
accept a “gestation period” for its investments seems akin to what a degenerate gambler 
might say to his friends and family in order to get more money to gamble.1   
 
Muddy Waters does not believe in the “gestation period” – particularly after studying the 
almost three-year old acquisition of Crown Flour Mill.  As we discuss in this report, 
CFM’s assets at the time of acquisition were worth only a fraction of what Olam booked, 
and CFM has only been generating a 0.9% PAT margin while burning cash.   
 
The non-cash accounting profits are significant to understanding how Olam is able to 
finance what, in our view, is an off-the-rails CapEx binge.  One thing that investors must 
understand about Olam’s non-cash accounting gains is that at least 62.5% of its reported 
negative goodwill profit has not come from buying assets below their carrying values.  
Rather, Olam revalued those assets upward, and then booked the negative goodwill.   
 
The acquisition of bankrupt SK Foods is an example of a transaction in which Olam 
significantly upped the book values of acquired assets.  The re-valuation allowed Olam to 
book negative goodwill that equated to 26.2% of Olam’s FY2010 PAT.  Olam increased 
the book value of SK’s assets by S$73.1 million.  Moreover, Olam was the sole bidder 
for SK, which has been called a “racketeering organization” by the United States 
Department of Justice.  According to a source familiar with the bankruptcy process, a 
number of potential strategic buyers were uncomfortable with the short time period in 
which to do due diligence.  (Apparently they do not have the ability to quickly spot value 
that Olam does.)  Olam is now arguing to two different tax assessors in California that the 
value of the SK assets is only US$16.9 million (versus an assessed value of US$168.8 
million).2 
 
Olam seems to be falling into the same Accounting Gain – CapEx vicious cycle that 
ensnared Enron.  Olam has been very upfront about its goal to generate US$1 billion 
(S$1.2 billion) in PAT by FY2016.  However, non-cash accounting gains equate to 
37.9% of PAT from FY2010 through FY2012.3  It seems that Olam’s only choice to 
move the needle toward S$1.2 billion is to continue to buy more questionable assets, 
while going full throttle in its trading business, which seems to merely consume ever 
more cash as its volumes increase (which is another parallel to Enron).  Using

2 We recognize that this could be a negotiating position, but assuming that Olam wants to pass the laugh 
test in its discussions with the assessors, these valuations should have some basis in reality. Our research 
shows they likely do. 
3 Calculated assuming no taxes on biological gains, remeasurement of investment, and negative goodwill.

conservative assumptions, our model forecasts that Olam will have to raise and / or 
refinance as much as S$4.6 billion over the next four quarters.  We believe our model 
assumptions are conservative, particularly in light of Olam's CEO announcing plans to 
spend an average of S$226 million to S$308 million on investments per quarter over the 
next three years, as mentioned above. Our model assumes only S$214 million of 
investments per quarter. 
 
Olam is now riding the tiger.  We think the only way off at this point is to fall.

Olam frequently books non-cash accounting gains (“NCAGs”) in its income statement.  
The two primary non-cash accounting gains Olam records are negative goodwill and 
biological gains.  Both types of gains encourage companies to spend money on asset 
purchases, with the possible result being – as in Enron Corp’s case – the asset quality 
becomes less important than the potential to recognize accounting gains.  The rub is that 
these non-cash gains cost real cash.   
 
From FY2010 through FY2012, NCAGs equated to 37.9%4 of Olam’s PAT.  It is well-
known that biological gains are driven by valuation models.  However, we think that 
analysts misunderstand how Olam generates much of its negative goodwill.  Much of the 
negative goodwill is also driven by valuation models.  At least 62.5% of Olam’s reported 
negative goodwill arises not from buying assets below book values; but rather, making 
(model-based) determinations at the time of acquisition that the assets are worth more 
than Olam is paying.  Not to worry though, Olam CEO Sunny Verghese says that 
management runs a “clean honest business”.5   
 
As we detail in this report, we cannot account for a total of S$996.2 million of Olam’s 
non-acquisition CapEx.  We believe that bondholders in particular should be asking 
where their money has gone, and how they will get it back. 
 


Olam’s	
  Looming	
  Solvency	
  Crisis	
  


One quarter ago (as of the end of FY2012), Olam seems to have had only three weeks of 
operating cash.  The Company reported S$1.1 billion in cash, but that number is 
misleading.  S$602.1 million of the cash balance appears to come from Olam 
withdrawing significant margin from its brokerage accounts.6

6 Per Olam’s audited FY2012 Cash Flow statement
Page 7 of 133 


Olam also had S$445.7 million of overdrafts as of FY2012.7  In other words, the 
overdrafts mean that Olam took more money out of its bank accounts than it had in them 
– this brings some of us back to freshman year of college.  Overdraft money is not cheap.  
Its subsidiaries pay up to 22% annual interest on these overdrafts.8   
 
Olam thus only had roughly S$60 million of truly free cash as of FY2012.9  Olam’s cash 
burn in FY2012 was S$1.1 billion, or over S$20 million per week. 10 
 
Olam’s capital structure includes a significant amount of loans and bonds that are due 
within the next 12 months.  As of September 30, 2012, Olam had S$1.38 billion in cash 
and short-term fixed deposits, and S$3.75 billion in borrowings due within the next 12 
months.  Our model shows that Olam could have to raise or refinance as much as S$4.6 
billion over the next 12 months in order to stay solvent.  We believe our model 
assumptions are conservative.  However, this was before (only within the 24 hours prior 
to publication of this report) Olam CEO Sunny Verghese defiantly announced plans to 
spend an average of S$226 million to S$308 million on investments per quarter over the 
next three years.11  Our model assumes only S$214 million of investments per quarter. 
 
After adjusting Olam’s EBITDA to remove non-cash accounting gains, it is showing that 
Olam is currently leveraged at 9.3x gross debt to LTM EBITDA, and 1.6x interest 
coverage.  Our model shows that if Olam’s borrowing costs do not change, its interest 
coverage (excluding non-cash accounting gains) could get close to 1.0x over the next 12 
months, which would be well below its minimum interest coverage covenant of 1.5x.12  
(We are unclear whether the covenant includes or excludes non-cash accounting gains.)

Trading volumes have grown 86.6% since FY2009.  From FY 2009 through Q1 2013, 
Olam’s net cash used in operations has been S$2.5 billion.13 We assume that much of the 
OCF burn is attributable to the trading business.  Much of Olam’s trading profit appears 
dependent on export incentives that Olam receives from governments.  These programs 
are politically sensitive, and this type of income seems unsustainable.

After Enron collapsed, Bethany McLean asked “Why were so many people willing to

financial models makes clear that they have no idea how Olam’s financial statements 
work, based on widely varying estimates for virtually every model input.  The Company 
publicly admits that its business is difficult to understand.15  Good things seldom come of 
investing in something one does not understand – particularly when there is a high degree 
of leverage.   
 


Is	
  Olam’s	
  Accounting	
  Credible?	
  


Olam has produced some of the worst accounting gaffes we’ve ever seen—often 
surpassing the US-listed China RTO frauds.  At the very least, these numerous 
accounting problems over the years strongly suggest that Olam’s accounting functions 
are incompetent.  It is hard to understand how Olam can be an effective risk manager 
when looking at the confusion it has had over its accounts.  Moreover, some of the 
accounting revisions are so unusual as to suggest irregularities.  
 


Olam’s	
  CapEx	
  is	
  Off	
  the	
  Rails	
  


Olam’s snowballing CapEx appears to be destroying significant investor value, and 
pushing the company toward collapse.  Olam tells investors that its CapEx projects are 
creating long-term value, and are generally meeting their targets while they are gestating. 
On the back of these statements, Olam borrows more money for more projects.  Given 
Olam’s true CapEx track record, Olam reminds us of a degenerate gambler, losing money 
only to borrow more from friends and family; and, then doubling down, losing again, 
borrowing more, and so on.   
 
The truly interesting aspect of Olam’s CapEx is that it seems to spend less cash on 
acquisitions than perceived; but, it spends much more on non-acquisition CapEx than 
investors understand.  This implicates various possibilities, including the possibility that 
Olam is pursuing more greenfield projects than investors realize.  If true, that fact would 
alter Olam’s risk profile.  Another potential issue is the specter of poor internal controls 
and substantial cash leakage. 
 
The total acquisition consideration Olam has announced exceeds disclosed cash 
consideration payments by S$571 million.16  Yet investors and analysts are often unaware 
when a project has died or been put on indefinite hold.   
 
On the other hand, Olam’s non-acquisition CapEx has become massive.  We cannot 
account for cumulative S$996.2 million in booked (but unattributed) CapEx over the last 
four years.17  Olam has so far failed to release information allowing us to bridge this gap.

Viewing	
  Olam	
  through	
  the	
  Enron	
  Lens	
  


Comparisons to Enron are overused, but in the case of Olam, the similarities really are 
uncanny.  We believe that the single biggest factor in Enron’s collapse was its use of 
accounting techniques similar to Olam’s value gains.  Both companies married 
problematic trading businesses with asset heavy businesses.  Both companies were “black 
boxes” to analysts and investors.  Enron’s notable inability to produce a balance sheet on 
time for its earnings announcements has a parallel in Olam’s often revised accounts.  
Enron’s antipathy toward short-sellers was clearly borne out of insecurity.  We believe 
that Olam is the same in this regard. 
 


Valuation	
  


We value Olam on a liquidation basis because we believe its value is less than its debt, 
and that it is at significant risk of defaulting on its obligations.  In the event of 
bankruptcy, our recovery model shows that recoverable assets for unsecured creditors of 
Olam would likely be 45.8 cents on the dollar.  This is the value of assets ignoring the 
time it takes to complete a bankruptcy process, uncertainty, risk of fraud, and time value 
of money.  Because of the lengthy bankruptcy process in Singapore, and an assumed 
required IRR of 15% on a distressed bond purchase, we believe the fair price for Olam’s 
unsecured obligations is 14 to 33 cents on the dollar, depending on recovery times.  In 
such a scenario, the equity would be wiped out, or worth nuisance value at best. 


Report	
  Background	
  
On November 19, 2012, Muddy Waters’s Director of Research, Carson Block, spoke 
about Olam at the Ira Sohn conference in London.  His talk was 15 minutes long, and he 
delivered a general overview of a portion of our negative investment thesis on Olam.   
 
In the one week since, Olam has reacted in a stunningly defensive way.  We understand 
from press reports that Olam has filed a defamation suit against Muddy Waters and Mr. 
Block.  It is clear that Olam greatly fears the public knowing the truth about this company 
– that it is yet another emperor with no clothes.   
 
CEO Sunny Verghese has suggested that instead of shorting Olam, Muddy Waters should 
go long and work with the board to improve the Company.18  Thank you, Mr. Verghese, 
but we must politely decline.  While we would be happy to have one or more 
conversations with you and your board about our views on Olam,19 we have a policy 
against wasting cash (strange as this may seem to Olam).  This policy unfortunately 
precludes us from purchasing any Olam securities at this time. 
 
We always feel sympathy for investors who have misplaced their trust in unworthy 
managements.  This is certainly the case of our feeling toward Olam’s investors.  But in 
no way are we intimidated by Olam.

Olam	
  Background	
  
Olam is an agri commodity trader that has moved into production, processing, and 
distribution in recent years.  It started in 1989 in Nigeria as part of an Indian 
conglomerate, the Kewalram Chanrai Group (“KC”).  KC had been producing cotton 
products for the domestic Nigerian market, and it created Olam to develop export markets 
for cotton and its cotton products.  KC tapped Olam’s current CEO Sunny Verghese to 
run the new business.   
 
Olam then expanded into exporting Nigerian agri commodities – first cashews, then 
sheanuts, and then into cocoa, coffee, and other commodities.  Olam expanded its sources 
to other countries in Africa, and then into Asia.  In 1995, Olam moved its headquarters 
from London to Singapore.20  It IPOed in Singapore in 2005.  At the end of the quarter 
prior to its IPO, its tangible fixed assets were only S$26.6 million.   
 
From its early days, Olam generated additional margin by frequently sourcing from the 
farm gate, versus buying at the ports.  While it breaks out sales by group, Olam is not 
transparent about how much of each specific commodity it sells.  These are niche 
commodities in the global agriculture world, and by focusing on them, Olam has largely 
avoided competing with the ABCDs (i.e., ADM, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus).  
However, it has become a flatter world, and sending recent graduates from Indian 
business schools into the African bush to buy crops is not the competitive advantage it 
once was.  The financial crisis has also negatively impacted agri commodity traders, 
causing them to often tie up more capital in return for lower profits than before.  
 
In 2008 Olam began aggressively implementing an M&A based growth strategy – 
focusing on production, processing, and distribution.  It is this strategy, coupled with 
expanded trading, that has driven what we believe is essentially a modestly profitable (at 
a smaller scale) trading business to take on crushing debt levels and, in our opinion, 
destroy substantial amounts of investor funds. 
 


Research	
  Methodology	
  
Muddy Waters spent approximately three months researching Olam full-time.  Our team 
includes experts in forensic accounting, law, investigations, production, international 
trade, and finance.  We employed investigators to research Olam operations in numerous 
countries across four continents.  We consulted with various experts, including in 
agriculture, Nigerian law, export incentives, agri commodities trading, bankruptcy, 
valuation, and shipping.  Our hallmark is to understand the way a business really is – not 
necessarily only what management wants investors to see.  As is typical when we 
research a company, we believe that through our field research, due diligence and 
analysis of publicly available information, we have developed a clearer picture about its 
operations and business, and we set out here our opinions and thesis based upon that 
clearer picture.

A portion of our analysis relies on publicly available financial statements and other 
information filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria.21  These analyses 
are almost identical to the analyses we have performed on China-based companies using 
their State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) files.

Olam frequently books non-cash accounting gains (“NCAGs”) in its income statement.  
The two primary non-cash accounting gains Olam records are negative goodwill and 
biological gains.  Both types of gains incentivize companies to spend money on asset 
purchases, and the possible result is that – as in Enron Corp’s case – the asset quality 
becomes less important than the potential to recognize accounting gains.  The rub is that 
these non-cash gains cost real cash.  Furthermore, a majority of Olam’s negative goodwill 
comes from its own upward revaluation of asset values, rather than comparisons to the 
book values of the assets at the time Olam acquired them.  In other words, much of 
Olam’s negative goodwill has come not from acquiring assets below their book values; 
but, rather by revaluing them at the time of the acquisition. 
 
Negative goodwill and biological gains have become an integral part of Olam’s reported 
net earnings.  The table below shows the relationship between NCAG and reported net 
income to shareholders, and adjusted return on average assets. 
 


  
As is shown in the table above, Olam has relied heavily on NCAG income as a 
contributor to net income over the past three years.  Similarly heavy use of NCAG

accounting is, in our view, one of the primary reasons Enron collapsed.  These gains 
encouraged Enron to spend substantial amounts of cash on low to negative return 
projects, which is what we think Olam is doing now.  Once a company begins heavily 
relying on NCAG, it becomes hard to stop because the YoY net income comparisons 
would be unfavorable without continuing to take such gains.  In other words, once 
companies start recording these gains, it becomes hard to stop riding the tiger. 
 


Negative	
  Goodwill	
  


We think analysts and investors are missing a major point regarding Olam’s negative 
goodwill.  Much of its negative goodwill comes from it revaluing assets at the time of 
acquisition, rather than it acquiring them below their book values.  Olam has recorded 
negative goodwill on acquisitions since Q4 2007, when it booked S$189,000 in negative 
goodwill on its acquisition of Rudra International Ltd.  Goodwill is booked following an 
acquisition based on subtracting the net assets acquired from the price paid.  If the price 
is higher than the net assets acquired, the acquirer records goodwill.  If the price paid is 
lower than the net assets acquired, the acquirer records negative goodwill—an immediate 
gain on the purchase.  This gain flows through the income statement—in Olam’s case, it 
is booked as “Other income”.   
 
There are two critical points to make about Olam’s negative goodwill.  First, negative 
goodwill is not “real” income in that there is no positive cash flow associated with it 
when booked.   
 
More important though is that at least 62.5% of Olam’s negative goodwill resulted from 
acquisitions in which Olam increased the values of the acquired assets, which then 
resulted in the negative goodwill.  For instance, with the SK Foods acquisition, the 
negative goodwill from which represented 26.3% of FY2010 net income, Olam revalued 
the PP&E upward by S$73.1 million (62.6%) from the book value at the time of the 
acquisition.  We believe that investors should be particularly skeptical of such negative 
goodwill, because it is not clear that the revaluations are free from management 
influence. 
 
Olam booked small amounts of negative goodwill in FY2008 and FY2009.  The stakes 
escalated greatly in FY2010 when Olam booked S$118.2 million in negative goodwill. 
The S$118.2 million booked under negative goodwill in Olam’s FY2010 Annual Report 
for FY2010 was S$29.2 million higher than the negative goodwill recorded for FY2010 
in Olam’s Q4 2010 financial statements for the fiscal year.  In other words, Olam 
somehow realized after reporting results that the assets were worth even more than it had 
previously thought.  Olam recorded another S$79.8 million in negative goodwill in FY 
2011, but slowed down in FY2012 with only S$3.2 million in negative goodwill.22  Since 
going public, Olam has recorded S$210.4 million in negative goodwill, S$201.2 million 
of which was recorded during the past three fiscal years.

Companies reporting significant NCAG are strongly incentivized to continue expanding 
their balance sheet in search of more assets on which they can book NCAG.  Because 
companies want to grow earnings, the transactions that generate NCAG generally get 
bigger and require more and more cash.  Enron employees joked that they were 
encouraged to spend $10 in order to generate $5 in current earnings.23  Olam has been 
explicit and aggressive about trying to grow reported earnings. 
 
As we show next, the possibility that Olam will focus on buying NCAGs is a real danger 
for Olam’s investors.  While the cash Olam spends and debt Olam assumes are real, we 
believe that its NCAGs are misleading accounting line items that can fool investors into 
believing the company is more profitable than it really is.  Further, the acquisitions and 
expansion that drive the NCAGs have put Olam in a precarious position regarding 
leverage.  If the pattern of acquiring assets for questionable NCAG continues, Olam 
investors may have a significant risk of default. 
 
We believe that the significant NCAGs Olam booked following the acquisitions of SK 
Foods (negative goodwill), tt Timber (negative goodwill), and NZFSU (gain on 
remeasurement of investment upon business combination) are largely – if not completely 
– unjustified.  Because Olam’s NCAGs on these assets (with the exception of NZFSU) 
were based on Olam’s revaluations, it means that the sellers were carrying, and / or sold, 
the assets below fair value.  Negative goodwill from revaluation is generally rare in 
acquisitions because it means that the seller has decided to part with it for less than fair 
value (not to say anything about the expected value of future earnings).   
 
Yet, Olam claims to capture negative goodwill on a fairly regular basis.  Olam’s gain on 
remeasurement of investment upon business combination of NZFSU is defensible from 
the perspective that the valuations were not subjective – Olam paid higher prices to 
acquire more NZFSU equity.  Our argument with the gain though is that it seems 
perverse to book a profit on an investment when you appear to have thrown more good 
money after bad, just at a higher price.  Further, the increasing price for NZFSU’s shares 
might have reflected Olam’s support for the company and the possibility of a buyout. 
 
We do not believe that Olam is really that savvy of a shopper, and we also believe that 
most of Olam’s NCAG acquisitions are poor investments.  Olam appears to be 
hemorrhaging money on NZFSU and facing serious problems at Olam Tomato 
Processors (SK Foods), while tt Timber appears to have gone nowhere.  Negative 
goodwill and re-measurement gains from these and other transactions (including 
biological gains) that occurred during FY2010 and FY2011 represented 26.1% of Olam’s 
reported PAT during those periods.24

In most instances, the prior financials of companies acquired by Olam are not readily 
available.  However, in some instances, they are.  In the case of the tt Timber acquisition, 
Olam acquired an entity with publicly available financial data.  We found that Olam 
marked up the assets acquired by a significant amount, which resulted in Olam booking a 
gain and boosting PAT.  Because DLH is a public company, its filings, which contain 
information on tt Timber, are available online.25

The fair value increase in the intangibles from DKK1.7 million to DKK10.2 million, 
amounting to S$2.3 million, is in relation to the FSC certification of parts of the forestry 
concession in the Congo Brazzavile and in Gabon.27 
 
DLH had impaired tt Timber by S$27 million (DKK117 million), which was reversed in 
2010 upon the sale to Olam.28  In 2010, DLH had a number of subsidiaries held for sale, 
however, tt Timber was the most significant.

We have converted these accounts into Singapore Dollars and compared them to Olam’s 
purchase accounting allocation.29  As can be seen from the table above, DLH has never 
given any significant value to its intangible assets; however, Olam has revalued the 
concessions from DLH’s S$270,000 to S$100.8 million.  In the process of upping the 
concession value, Olam booked S$58.4 million in profit in FY2011.  The foregoing facts 
strongly suggest that Olam aggressively valued tt Timber’s concessions in order to 
improve Olam’s reported profit.  
 


Olam’s	
  Looming	
  Solvency	
  Crisis	
  
At the end of FY2012, Olam seems to have had only three weeks of operating cash.  The 
Company reported S$1.1 billion in cash, but that number is misleading.  S$602.2 million 
of the cash balance came from Olam withdrawing substantial amounts of cash from its 
margin accounts.  S$445.7 million came from overdrafts.30  Net-net, Olam had only 
approximately S$60 million of truly free cash as of the end of FY2012.  





 
 
Olam as a physical trader engages in extensive hedging (and possibly speculating) with 
financial instruments.  Many – to most – of these transactions are likely executed with 
brokers.  Brokers require margin in order to execute most transactions – the margin is to 
manage the risk that their clients will default.  In the case of exchange-traded contracts, 
the exchanges will require a margin from the broker, which in turn will demand a higher 
margin from the client.  In other words, margin with brokers is part of working capital.  It 
                                                
29 Olam 2011 Annual Report, p.131. 
30 Id.
Page 17 of 133 


is questionable how Olam can hedge with negative net margin at its brokers.  We 
therefore suspect that Olam drew down its margin accounts just before the end of the 
quarter in order to appear to be more liquid than it really is.  
 
Olam has suggested that it does not need margin with its brokers because it has begun to 
net off its transactions on a daily basis; however, for the reasons suggested above this 
does not seem to be correct. Additionally, if it indeed started to net off its accounts, then 
why did it substantially increase its margin at brokers in Q1 2013 from a net liability of 
S$141 million as of Q4 2012 to a net asset of S$234 million (which happens to coincide 
with Olam’s recent debt raising)?  
 
Olam first ended a quarter without margin in its brokerage accounts in Q3 2011.  Below 
is the ending broker margin balance by quarter since Olam went public.  It is odd that as 
Olam’s sales and inventory have grown substantially, its quarter end margin balances 
have gone negative three times. 
 





 
 
It is also very interesting that the margin accounts and amounts due to brokers changed in 
two quiet footnote restatements of margin (with changes of over S$1 billion in the 
FY2008 figures):
Page 18 of 133 


 
 
Olam’s inability to accurately identify margin deposits and liabilities to brokers 
approximately 100 days after closing the fiscal year greatly calls Olam’s claims of having 
superior risk management into question. 
 
Olam also had S$445.7 million of overdrafts as of the FY2012.  In other words, it took 
more money out of its bank accounts than it had in them – this brings some of us back to 
freshman year of college.31  This money is not cheap.  Its subsidiaries pay up to 22% 
annual interest on these overdrafts.32   
 
Olam thus only had approximately S$60 million of truly free cash as of FY2012.  Olam’s 
cash burn from operations and investments in FY2012 was negative S$1.1 billion, or over 
S$20 million per week. 
 
We estimate that Olam could have to raise or 
refinance a total of S$4.6 billion in the next 
12 months in order to stay solvent.  This is 
based on conservative assumptions, including 
that Olam’s borrowing costs do not increase.  
Olam’s capital structure includes a significant 
amount of loans and bonds that are due within 
the next 12 months.  As of September 30, 
2012, Olam had S$1.38 billion in cash and 
short-term fixed deposits net of overdrafts, 
and S$3.75 billion in borrowings due within 
the next 12 months. 
 
Below is a bridge showing how our model 
arrived at S$4.6 billion in required issuances or refinancing over the next 12 months:

Forward 12M Cashflow Bridge Forecast 


 
 
The assumptions we use in our model are conservative.  We arrived at a twelve-month 
operating cash burn of S$1.6 billion by calculating revenue based off of sales volume for 
each product group, with a blended YoY growth of 35.0% over the next twelve months 
(beginning with Q2 2013).  
 
We also estimated sales revenue per MT assuming QoQ growth of 0.75%, which was 
more generous than nearly all of the bullish analysts.  The blended growth rate for total 
revenue was 11.0%, and we assumed that COGS would decline to 81.0% of revenue 
going forward, an improvement of 71 basis points over FY2012.  We kept other figures, 
such as sales and logistics constant relative to volume and / or revenue; calculated 
depreciation based off of a standard schedule; assumed no gains or losses on derivatives; 
and assumed a 5.0% year-over-year increase in Other Income for each quarter, with 
S$9.4 million / quarter in income from jointly controlled entities (the average of the past 
eight quarters).  Our FY2013 revenue estimate comes in at S$22.9 billion, S$2.3 billion 
higher than the Bloomberg consensus figure.   
 
However, the conservative projections were not enough to keep the model from 
projecting a financial disaster awaiting Olam in the next twelve months if it cannot raise 
or refinance S$4.6 billion.  Below is our forecast of the current debt maturity schedule: 
 


Minimum cash net of overdrafts of S$100 million
Page 20 of 133 


 
 
To be conservative, we assumed that all Other Current Loans were due in Q4 2013 and 
Q1 2014, with a 40/60 split, respectively. 
 
Assuming that Olam requires a minimum of S$100 million in cash on hand to continue 
operating, we believe that Olam may have to raise or refinance S$4.6 billion in debt in 
the next twelve months to stay solvent.  A large part of this is due to increasingly 
negative changes in working capital—as Olam attempts to capture additional revenue, its 
balance sheet has become bloated.  We assume capital expenditures of S$1.5 billion 
equally weighted over each of the next seven quarters, or S$214 million per quarter.33  
However, this was before (only within the 24 hours prior to publication of this report) 
Olam CEO Sunny Verghese defiantly announced plans to spend an average of S$226 
million to S$308 million on investments per quarter over the next three years.34  Our 
model assumes only S$214 million of investments per quarter. 
 
Combined with a highly levered balance sheet, record low operating margins, and 
continued capital expenditures and acquisitions, Olam runs a high risk of financial ruin.  
Even assuming that Olam can raise the money required to keep its operations running, 
our model forecasts that it will barely be able to cover the interest - assuming its 
borrowing costs do not increase.

guided towards S$1.7 billion in capital expenditures over the next 18 – 24 months.  We subtracted out the 
S$0.2 billion in capital expenditures recorded in Q1 2013 to arrive at S$1.5 billion, and allocated it over the 
next seven quarters to be conservative

Our forecasts are below: 
 





 
Our model assumes that it will be able 
to continue to raise debt at 6.5% yields, 
despite the effective rate for last quarter 
being 28 basis points higher.35  If credit 
markets tightened or investors began to 
question Olam’s viability as a business 
(which we think is long overdue), a 
significant change in interest rates could 
wipe out Olam.  Once Olam can no 
longer pay interest on debt outstanding, 
it will become virtually impossible to 
raise more debt.  Further, our debt 


maturities forecast after Q1 2014 are extremely conservative and might understate the 
amount due—we did not peg any of the non-current term loans as maturing in the periods 
following Q1 2014 in our model, likely making Olam even more vulnerable to changes in 
fixed income markets than our model projects.  It is well known that yields on bonds 
have reached record lows due to influxes of investment capital into bond funds.  
Eventually, this tide will turn, and we believe Olam might be swept out to sea.

  Business	
  Appears	
  to

  Failing	
  Business	
  Model	
  
Cash	
  Burn	
  


Olam’s core trading business appears to be scaled well beyond what it should be.  Since 
FY2009, trading volumes are up 86.6%, yet Olam’s operating cash flow has been 
negative S$2.5 billion.36  Most of this burn should be attributable to the trading business. 
 
Our interpretation is that Olam’s core trading business model is not a good model when 
scaled up to its present levels.  Olam’s pre-IPO success was based on its focus on niche 
trading commodities.  The large trading companies focus on wheat, corn, soy, and palm.  
Olam was focusing on cashews, cotton, cocoa, and coffee.  Olam has established strong 
positions in its core commodities, but if it wanted to grow trading, it would likely have to 
move into other commodities.   
 
Incidentally, Olam could now be facing increasing competition in its niches.  On 
November 13, 2012, Carlyle announced that it is leading a private equity consortium that 
is investing in Export Trading Group, which is based in Tanzania and is one of the 
world’s largest traders of cashews.37 
 
The issue is that Olam does not have the same position, and therefore inherent 
advantages, in other commodities as it does in its core business.  In part, that is because 
the world is a flatter place, and many of these commodities already had well-developed 
supply chains by the time Olam began trading them.  If Olam’s purported advantage in 
new commodities is that it buys from farm gate, it is unlikely that other (and larger) 
traders have not already thought of doing the same thing.  Buying from farm gate has a 
number of risks that other traders seem happy to transfer to third parties.  If Olam could 
manage those risks, then there would seem to be an opportunity for some additional 
profit.  However, we question how a company with as many accounting and execution 
issues as Olam has can manage these risks at the same time growing its trading volumes 
at its present rate. 
 
Physical commodity trading is a difficult business.  One can generate accounting profits, 
but cash is often plowed right back into working capital – especially inventories and 
receivables.  This became even more so in agri commodities in the wake of the financial 
crisis.  The prices of many commodities have stayed high, but due to decreased demand, 
margins have compressed and customers take longer to pay.  Thus, agri commodity 
traders need more capital to produce the same, or lower, profits.  It seems as though the 
scale of Olam’s trading business is well into negative incremental cash returns. 
 


Nigerian	
  Export	
  Incentives	
  


Olam’s trading business is also heavily dependent on export subsidies – particularly from 
the governments of Nigeria and Gabon.  We do not view these subsidies as being

sustainable.  The Nigerian export subsidies (called “EEGs”) have been particularly 
controversial, with allegations of corruption within the program.  Nigeria stops issuing 
the grants every few years when the program (again) becomes politically problematic.38  
Recent events in the secondary market for Nigerian EEGs signal the uncertainty inherent 
in the program.  The EEG certificates (called “NDCCs”) are to be used as credits toward 
import duties.   
 
In February 2011, CLSA published a research report that highlighted the importance of 
EEGs to Olam, and questioned the sustainability of Olam’s profits if the EEG program 
were scaled down or terminated.39  
 
Olam’s denied that EEGs are material to its profits because it claims to pass along most 
of the benefit to the farmers.  We question Olam’s assertions, and think that Olam’s 
profits could be heavily reliant on the EEGs. 
 


EEG	
  Effect	
  on	
  Profitability	
  


Olam was quick to point out that the EEGs constituted 0.7%, 1.0% and 0.8% of total 
revenue in the financial years 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively.  Olam wanted to 
obfuscate the issue by making the market believe that because the EEGs are an 
insignificant proportion of revenue, then their absence would have little effect on Olam’s 
profitability.  However, the effect of EEGs on the bottom line is very important because, 
like any trading company, Olam generates substantial amounts of revenue with very low 
margins. The most important figure for trading companies is the bottom line. 
   


 
 
As we can see from the table above, the incentives are equivalent to a disproportionately 
large amount of Olam’s PAT.40  The effect on earnings is much higher when considering 
total government grants.  This raises questions over Olam’s dependence on these 
handouts. 


                                                
38 It is also not clear to us that export grants are not in part quid pro quo for direct investment into these 
countries.   
39 “Clarifications on CSLA Analyst Report dated 21st February 2011” as posted on Olam’s website. 
40 Assuming they are not taxed.  It is difficult to know what tax rates should apply to export incentives – 
particularly given the likely existence of sophisticated transfer pricing strategies.
Page 24 of 133 


 
Olam, in its response to CLSA, claimed the following (emphasis added): 
 


“When we receive export incentives in Nigeria which are recorded separately as a 
line item in our P&L, we have to pass on almost all of this to our suppliers 
thereby increasing our costs of procurement. Therefore, what is recorded as 
export incentives does not directly flow down to our profits.”41 


 
In the above paragraph, Olam obfuscates the issue further, by emphasizing that it “[has] 
to pass on” the incentives to their suppliers.  If companies are forced to pass on the 
incentives to their suppliers, then it does not look like there is any incentive at all. The 
aim of the EEGs is stated succinctly in a recent article (emphasis added): 


“The Export Expansion Grant is an initiative of the Federal Government, aimed at 
encouraging exporters of non-oil products, including agro-commodities as part of 
efforts to cushion the effects of infrastructural deficiencies, reduce overall unit 
cost of production and increase the competitiveness of Nigerian products in 
the international market.”42 


The same article quotes the Nigerian Minister of Trade and Investment, Mr. Aganga as 
saying (emphasis added):  


“The EEG is not under any threat. The Federal Government has no intention of 
terminating the EEG. Instead, what we are trying to do is to strengthen the 
processes and procedures involved in the implementation of the EEG to ensure 
that it becomes most beneficial to both the exporters and the 
government…We are putting structures in place to make sure that the EEG is not 
abused in the future.”43 


The aim of the EEG is to clearly benefit the exporter, if there was no financial benefit to 
the exporter in receiving a grant then there would be no motivation for the exporter to 
increase its export sales. It does not seem logical or realistic that Olam is forced to pass 
on its incentives to its suppliers. 
 
We have spoken to Nigerian businesspeople regarding Olam, and they have opined that 
farmers sell to Olam because there is generally little competition for Olam on the supply 
side.  They believe that Olam is a strong negotiator and receives the lowest price possible 
from the farmers.  The apparent lack of competition suggests that Olam’s suppliers have 
little to no power in determining the pricing, and so could not force Olam to give up their 
subsidies. 
 
Finally and perhaps most revealing, Olam argues publicly about the importance and 
necessity of the EEGs to the growth of exports while simultaneously telling investors that

EEGs do not significantly impact its P&L.  In 2008, the Managing Director of Olam 
Nigeria appealed to the Nigerian Senate to review the EEG, which was suspended at the 
time.44  In 2010, Olam presented a position paper to improve the EEGs, which contained 
the phrase “EEG policy – essential for survival and growth of value added exports”.45  
Another example is the swift response to suggestions that customs are rejecting EEGs by 
stating that all their EEGs remain valid.46  If Olam were really passing along EEG 
benefits on to suppliers, their disappearance would have little to no effect on Olam’s 
bottom line. 


Are	
  EEGs	
  Sustainable?	
  


The EEGs have had a colorful history of being suspended, changed, and not being 
honored by Nigerian Customs.  While the present Nigerian government appears to stand 
strongly behind the EEGs, this is not concrete. Since 2007, the EEG has been suspended 
twice – in 2008 and 2011 – for various reasons, including possible abuse of the EEG by 
exporters.47  This has also created a backlog of approximately NGN100 billion that is yet 
to be paid by the Nigerian government.48 
 
Additionally, the EEG faces pressure from both the Nigerian Customs Service and local 
businesses. As recently as 2011, the Nigerian Customs Service has rejected NGN60 
billion of EEGs issued to companies like Olam, rendering them worthless.49  Having 
spoken to an EEG expert, we understand the Nigerian Customs Service has been given a 
quota for the amount of duties it must collect, and the EEGs hinder their ability to meet 
the quota.  This has affected the NDCC’s market value. Third parties had been charging a 
5% discount when purchasing the EEGs from exporters, however, this has now increased 
to 20% in light of the increased risk of rejection and this reduces Olam’s recoverability 
on the EEGs.50,51

The grant income from the Republic of Gabon, which relates to “the conceptualization, 
marketing and promotion of the special economic zone in Gabon”, 52 decreased from 
S$32.7 million in 2011 to S$25.9 million in 2012.53  As the special economic zone is 
filled up, we would not be surprised if this grant income continues to decrease.

Worryingly, the decrease in the grant received from Gabon coincided with a 20% 
increase in export incentives and subsidies received.  The general increase in grants and 
subsidies could also be a reflection of Olam’s increased capital investment in countries 
that provide these incentives.  The attainment of more subsidies could also be the reason 
why Olam continues to invest significant amounts of capital in highly questionable and 
barely profitable companies, particularly in Nigeria. 
 


Conclusion	
  


Investors should be wary of Olam’s increasing dependence on government handouts. 
These handouts are unlikely to last over the long-term, nor possibly in the short- to 
medium-terms.  With subsidies/funding from governments adding up to the equivalent of 
34.4% of FY2012 PAT (up from the equivalent of 28.6% in FY2011), investing in Olam 
is partly placing trust in the continued generosity of third-world governments.  The grants 
likely mask poor performance in Olam’s trading business, and could also be influencing 
Olam’s investment decisions.  Based on the analyses of some of Olam’s acquisitions in 
West Africa, it appears that Olam might be investing significant amounts of capital in 
order to increase its government subsidies as opposed to investing in companies with 
high quality earnings.

“Why were so many people willing to believe in 
something that so few actually understood?” – 


Bethany McLean, Why Enron Went Bust54 
 
When Fortune Magazine journalist Bethany 
McLean famously wrote her first article on Enron 
Corp., she quoted bullish analysts saying that 
Enron was impossible for them to understand.  
Goldman Sachs’s analyst was even quoted calling 
Enron a “black box”. 
 
In our view, poorly understood and highly 
leveraged companies are a potentially lethal 
combination for investors. 
 
Olam is just as much of a black box to its (largely bullish) sell-side analysts as Enron 
was.  The 19-analyst revenue estimates on Bloomberg show wide estimate ranges in the 
FY2013 and FY2014 forecasts.  Bloomberg showed only two estimates for the recently 
announced Q1 2013 number.  Both of these data points indicate that the analysts do not

understand how Olam’s financial statements really work.  A recent Financial Times 
article on Olam reinforces this point.55 
 
Analysts have no idea how to forecast Olam’s CapEx, and all seem to have greatly 
underestimated FY2013 levels based on Q1.  The analysts generally drive their models 
off of two ratios that Olam frequently proffers as metrics by which to measure its 
business: Gross and Net Contributions.  GC and NC are largely irrelevant in our view 
because they exclude Olam’s significant – and quixotic – staff costs.  Further, Olam has 
subtly changed the definitions of GC and NC from one fiscal year to the next.   
 
Olam’s seemingly outsized Level 3 derivatives holdings are potentially risky, and are 
impossible for outsiders to analyze (in terms of risk and accuracy of valuations).  The 
tremendous fluctuations in Olam’s income tax rate indicate that the composition of its 
profits changes substantially from year-to-year, which certainly makes it hard to 
understand the business.    
 
Analysts’ annual revenue and earnings estimate ranges are substantial, and indicate that 
analysts do not know how to model the Company.  Despite already being in Q2 2013, the 
19 estimates for FY2013 revenue range from S$18.2 billion to S$23.3 billion (28.0% 
greater).  The 19 FY2014 ranges are even greater – from S$19.4 billion to S$27.8 billion 
(43.3% greater).  Only two analysts had ventured guesses at Q1 2013 numbers, which is 
yet another sign that they do not know how to model the Company.  Interestingly, Olam’s 
reported Q1 2013 revenue of S$4.7 billion beat the average of the estimates by 34.5%; 
yet, the reported EPS exactly met the two-analyst consensus of S$0.016, with the help of 
fair value and biological asset gains, which it took for the first time ever in a Q1 period.

When analysts can’t even copy Management’s CapEx guidance, should investors rely on 
their other assumptions?  Below are FY2013 and FY2014 CapEx estimates by analysts at 
five banks.  In addition to ranging greatly from one to another, they project FY2013 
CapEx far below explicit Management guidance:   
 


 
 
Olam Management’s commentary: 
 


“So, we have, as of FY2012, spent S$4.4 billion. And based on the investments 
committed, an additional S$1.7 billion will be spend over the next 18 to 24 
months to complete these initiatives.” 
- Shekhar Anantharaman, Q4 2012 Call 


 
“So, as far as the total CapEx is concerned, we had given you at the end of the 
full-year results briefing that we'll need about S$1.7 billion in the next 12 months. 
I think FY2013 plus probably another six months of FY2014.” 
- Shekhar Anantharaman, Q1 2013 Call 


 
The real risk in not understanding Olam’s CapEx is that the Company has S$3.75 billion 
in borrowings maturing in the next 12 months, is generally operating cash flow negative 
(and Management has guided towards negative cash flows from operations for the next 
two years as well), and had only S$1.38 billion in cash and short-term fixed deposits at 
the end of Q1 2013.  There is not a lot of room for error. 
 
The dynamic analyst models we have reviewed generally are driven by Gross and Net 
Contribution estimates.  Most of the models use hard-coded growth rates for product 
segment volumes, usually assuming that the underlying prices are constant.   
 
The issue with this approach is that GC and NC are fairly irrelevant measures because 
they exclude Olam’s staff costs.  Olam defines GC as total revenue minus COGS,
Page 29 of 133 


shipping and logistics expenses, claims and commissions, net gain / loss from changes in 
fair values of biological assets (definitely not our favorite accounting metric), net 
measurement of derivative instruments (ditto with respect to Level 3), non-controlling 
interests and non-recurring exceptional items.56  NC is GC minus finance costs, excluding 
interest expense and income.  However, these two metrics exclude two key items – staff 
costs and other operating expenses.   
 
Olam’s staff costs are material to its operations, but they are also quixotic with little 
rhyme or reason.  The table below shows the lack of correlation between staff costs and 
revenue, volume, or reporting period:   
 





The following table shows Olam’s tax rates between FY2005 and FY2012.  Note the 
volatility that began in FY2008. 
 





Olam’s tax rate fluctuations make no sense to us – even controlling for non-cash 
accounting gains.57  In general, Olam is buying commodities in Africa, Asia, and South 
America; and then, selling them to North America and Europe.  It likely uses 
sophisticated “transfer pricing” strategies whereby it looks to minimize the reported 
income in high tax jurisdictions, which are generally the source and destination countries.  
Typically the way to minimize taxes involves using intermediate entities in low and zero 
tax jurisdictions, or jurisdictions with preferential tax treaties with source and destination 
countries.  Companies using transfer-pricing strategies generally try to book as much of 
the profit on a transaction as possible in the intermediate entities.   
 
Transfer pricing is obviously complex, and can cause some fluctuations in tax rates, 
depending on the particular jurisdictions’ relative compositions in a given period. 
However, we do not believe transfer pricing explains the fluctuations in the income tax 
rate.  But even if the fluctuations are attributable to changing transfer-pricing 
mechanisms, the fact remains: analysts and investors cannot project the tax rate with any 
confidence.

  –	
  Who	
  Decides

  Much	
  These	
  are	
  Worth?	
  


In order to allow more comparability between companies, the accounting standards 
require companies to classify their derivatives based on the fair value hierarchy as set out 
below: 


 
• Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 


identical assets or liabilities.  
 


• Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in 
active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 


• Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and deemed 
significant to the overall fair value measurement. This includes situations where 
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 


Per the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, Level 3 derivatives have some 
unobservable inputs and these inputs are deemed significant to the overall fair value 
measure. As such, the fair value determination of the Level 3 derivatives allows for 
significant management discretion in its valuation and makes this category of derivative 
extremely susceptible to manipulation. 
 
Investors should be wary of companies with significant Level 3 balances as these denote 
that the company is carrying an asset/liability whose value is not fully quantifiable or 
necessarily understood.  Listed companies that really value transparency should prefer to 
have their derivatives in Level 1 and Level 2; however, this is not always possible.

(Note that all figures in this section exclude convertible bonds from calculations.) 
 
From FY2006 to FY2010, Olam’s derivative financial liabilities outweighed its 
derivative financial assets. In 2011, there was a reversal with a derivative net asset 
balance of S$22.8 million of in the year and in 2012 the net derivative assets stood at 
S$186.5 million, as per the table below:
Page 31 of 133 


 
 
Perhaps unsurprisingly the turnaround in the derivative balance coincided with the first 
time that Olam recognized the management-sensitive Level 3 derivatives by re-
categorizing Level 2 derivatives as per the note below:58  
 


Financial instruments transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2011, the Group transferred certain 
financial instruments from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, due to 
changes in inputs to the valuation models to better represent the fair value of the 
physical forward contracts. The carrying amount of the total financial assets 
transferred from FY2010 was $72,621,000.59 


 
We understand from the note above, that S$72.6 million of the 2011 Level 3 derivative 
balance was physical contracts that was moved over from Level 2. From talks with 
analysts, we understand that due to the volatility in cotton prices during FY2011, Olam 
was left with Level 3 derivatives, and this could pertain to the physical cotton contracts 
moved from Level 2. The composition of the remaining Level 3 balance of S$418.5 
million is less clear, though this may also relate to cotton. 
 
The higher Level 3 balance in 2011 may be justifiable; however, it is interesting and 
worth noting that the derivative net liability balance of S$468.4 million60 for Level 1 and 
2 is netted out by a new Level 3 net asset balance of S$491.2 million, which left Olam 
with its first net asset derivative balance of S$22.8 million on open derivative positions. 
 
Olam stated that because the 2011 Level 3 derivatives included derivatives affected by 
the cotton price volatility, the 2012 Level 3 derivatives balances were expected to be 
minimal, as volatility was no longer an issue; and, the previous Level 3 balance was 
expected to be unwound. However, while the Level 3 derivatives did decrease, there 
remained a net asset of S$322 million, and this outweighed the Level 1 and 2 derivative 
liability of S$135.6 million, which allowed Olam to end the year with a derivative net 
asset balance of S$186.5 million.61

Those of a cynical nature may also question how a total net derivative asset of S$186.5 
million on June 30, 2012 suffered a dramatic reverse of S$422.4 million in just three 
months to a net derivative liability of S$235.9 million as reported in Olam’s Q1 2013 
results; however, this might merely have been connected to the unwinding of contracts in 
line with sales of the underlying commodities. 
 


Level	
  3	
  Derivatives	
  and	
  the	
  Income	
  Statement	
  


The potential effect of possible management manipulation of Level 3 derivatives can also 
have a significant effect on the income statement. Consider the following note in 2012 
annual report (emphasis added):62  
 


For certain commodity contracts, the fair value had been determined using a fair 
value model. The valuation requires management to make certain assumptions 
about the model inputs, including forward prices, credit risk and volatility that 
may not be supported by observable market data. Management has determined 
that the potential effect of adjusting the assumptions to the model inputs of 
the valuation model by +/- 1% would have changed the profit or loss for the 
Group by $12,182,000 (2011: $3,764,000).  The carrying amount of the physical 
contracts at 30 June 2012 is $322,136,000 (2011: $491,188,000).  


 
This note implies two issues: 


 
1. Management’s discretionary input in valuing the Level 3 derivatives has a serious 


impact on the income statement 
 


2. The extraordinary increase in sensitivity from S$3.8 million per +/- 1% in 2011 to 
S$12.2 million despite a decline in overall value of the Level 3 derivatives 


 
With Olam’s apparent focus on its PAT and share price, this note raises serious questions 
over the extent to which its valuation of the Level 3 derivatives has affected the income 
statement. In 2012, a 1% change in the inputs in the valuation of a Level 3 derivative 
could lead to an additional S$12.2 million in earnings.  It should also be noted that it is 
not unusual for commodity prices, which we assume are one factor in the models, to have 
the potential to fluctuate greatly. 
 
The majority of the derivatives are “Held for Hedging” (“HFH”) and as per the 2012AR, 
Olam designates all hedges as cash flow hedges.63 Most, if not all, of the Level 3 
derivatives should be HFH, and as Olam claims that all the hedges are effective hedges, 
then any unrealized gains will hit the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Only the 
realized gains/losses will affect the profit and loss accounts. It should be noted that HFH 
derivatives are not used for speculation.

63 Annual Report, p. 123, Note 2.32.
Page 33 of 133 


We have studied Olam’s accounts in depth.  However, it has been next to impossible to 
decipher its hedging practices, and there is a serious concern as to how much these 
assumptions may have influenced profits. 
 
To put it another way, there is a fair question as to whether there are any earnings in the 
business at all, once we strip out fair value biological gains, government subsidies, and 
the possible effect of Management changes on these Level 3 derivatives. 
 
Additionally, there should also be concern over why the sensitivity has increased so much 
in one year.  We can envisage three possibilities, none of which are particularly 
comforting:64 


 
1. The notional amount of Level 3 derivatives has grown 300%, which means Olam 


is pushing more and more of its derivative contracts into Level 3.  This could 
allow it to potentially manipulate their value and inflate the balance sheet or 
profits. 
 


2. The existing Level 3 derivatives may have become more illiquid and may require 
more parameters and inputs to be decided by Management, which would increase 
the sensitivity to Management’s assumptions. The issue is that if these derivatives 
and the underlying commodity are becoming more illiquid, then at some point 
Olam may need to take a large write-off in its income statement. 
 


3. Management is intentionally manipulating the Level 3 valuation model in order to 
inflate the balance sheet, reported profits, or both.  


Is	
  Olam’s	
  Accounting	
  Credible?	
  
Olam has produced some of the worst accounting gaffes we’ve ever seen – in both the 
quantity and substance of these revisions.  Olam’s accounting track record, at the very 
least, strongly suggests incompetence (to say nothing of calling its risk management 
claims into question).  At worst, these issues could be indicative of fraud.  We have noted 
suspected China RTO frauds listed in the US have had similarly unusual revisions (albeit 
with far fewer incidences per company).  On February 21, 2011, CLSA strongly 
criticized Olam for some of these issues.  Olam responded in part by saying that these are 
intra-year reclassification issues, and that investors should take comfort that the changes 
have no effect on P&L because they are all essentially re-classification changes: 
 


All the differences between the unaudited accounts and AR that have been 
referred to in the CLSA’s Report, are essentially re-classification changes 
between subsidiary accounts in different jurisdictions as compared to Group 
consolidation; and/or re-classification between line items within the Group 
accounts. However, this does not lead to any inaccuracy in reported profits, net 
assets or point to any lack of internal controls, as has been stated in the CLSA 
report. None of these adjustments have any P&L impact.65   


                                                
64 There could be other possibilities that we were unable to identify. 
65 Clarifications on CLSA Analyst Report on Olam dated 21st February 2011
Page 34 of 133 


 
There are three points to make about the Company’s response:  
 


• It did not address the times when accounts have changed from audited statement 
to audited statement (e.g., FY2009 to FY2010). 


• While some of the many changes made by Olam could be reclassifications, a 
disturbingly high proportion of the changes do not have offsetting changes in 
similar accounts; therefore, it strains credibility to claim that all of these revisions 
were reclassifications.   


• Further, one could interpret Olam’s statement about the consistency of net income 
as meaning that Olam’s accounting is bottom up.  In other words, it could be 
viewed as even more disturbing that with all of these accounting revisions, 
Olam’s net income does not change.   


 
Likely in response to the scrutiny caused by the CLSA report, Olam cut down 
significantly on the changes in FY2011 and FY2012.  However, CapEx has increased 
tremendously, and we wonder whether at least part of reported CapEx is somehow used 
to plug these accounting problems (in lieu of the former methods).  Further, we were 
unable to come close to reconciling income statement FY2011 COGS with inventory 
accounts in the notes to the financial statements – the un-reconciled difference is S$1.0 
billion (details provided later in this section). 
 
Below is a summary of the accounting revisions we have noted, accompanied by further 
details and explanation of certain key points:66 
 


1) We believe Olam management could be using its desired net income as an input 
rather than an output when constructing its financials, and that the reported 
figures might therefore be misleading for investors.  This possibility is supported 
by: 


a. The extensive and prevalent restatements of numbers between quarterly 
reports and audited annual reports consistently maintain constant net 
income figures, despite defying apparent accounting logic in certain cases.  
Significant changes to inventory write-downs, allowance for doubtful 
accounts, fair value measurements of derivatives, gain/loss on disposal of 
PP&E, negative goodwill, interest income, interest expense, and numerous 
other operating cash flow items totaling hundreds of millions of SGD exist 
between Olam’s quarterly and annual filings, yet the net income in every 
year from FY2006 to FY2011 remained identical between the Q4 filing 
and the annual report 


b. We are also suspicious of Olam’s reported balance sheet figures.  Just as 
changes to operating cash flow items have no effect on Olam’s income

researchers.

statement, Olam’s balance sheet is largely impervious to frequent changes 
in financing, investing, and working capital items on the statement of cash 
flows. 


2) Olam restated certain 2008 figures in 2009.  Note 41 of the 2009 AR appears at 
first glance to show that some assets and liabilities were cancelled out, some 
assets were moved from “other” to interests in jointly controlled entities, and 
profits/losses resulting from foreign exchange rates were moved into/out of 
COGS.  However, some of the figures that appear to be offsetting each other are 
coming from completely unrelated line items, and the changes leave S$64.5 
million in unexplained adjustments to the COGS.   


3) Office equipment in the FY2009AR appears to have been restated as Biological 
Assets in the FY2010AR with no disclosure being made.  The FY2009 earnings 
were restated in FY2010 to account for new gains on the new “biological assets”; 
however, biological gains were added to “other income” and a mysterious new 
charge appeared in COGS for the exact same amount, leaving the net income 
exactly the same.  On the statement of cash flows, there was a concurrent decline 
in purchases of PP&E to preserve the cash balance. 


4) Olam is including seeds given to farmers (called “annual crops”) on its balance 
sheet despite the fact that it doesn’t own them; the farmers do.  Further, in 
FY2012, Olam recorded S$46.8 million in net additions to biological assets.  
Olam specifically noted that the increase was primarily from annual crops and 
livestock, despite the fact that the total hectares of annual crops were cut in half 
over the year.  The Company’s explanation for this is that when it discussed land 
area, it now only discusses hectares it controls.   


5) Numerous accounting entries that appear wrong:  
a. In Q3 2012, Olam reported receiving proceeds of S$4.7 million from 


disposal of PP&E in Q3 on its statement of cash flows.  In the very same 
line item, Olam reported receiving S$3.1 million in proceeds from 
disposal of PP&E in the first nine months of 2012—implying that Olam 
received negative S$1.6 million in proceeds in the first six months of the 
year.  This is contradicted by the Q2 2012 statement of cash flows, which 
shows that Olam recorded S$2.0 million in proceeds from the disposal of 
PP&E in those first six months. 


b. In Q1 2012, biological gains/losses were marked as being zero.  However, 
given that biological gains/(losses) are partly calculated based on a DCF 
model on a quarterly basis, it is unlikely for this to have been the case.  
The balance of biological assets declined by S$56.5 million during the 
quarter, suggesting that Olam may have omitted a significant biological 
loss from its earnings (although it is possible that some portion of this was 
attributable to harvests).  Net income for the period was S$33.3 million—
Page 36 of 133 


so any omitted biological loss would have forced Olam to end the quarter 
at a loss.  In its most recent quarterly filing, Olam attempted to rewrite 
history by claiming that it did not begin quarterly calculations of fair value 
of biological assets until Q3 2012 (this is patently false—Olam recorded 
biological gains in Q2 2011, Q3 2011, and Q4 2011—the company merely 
skipped Q1 2012): 


 
The quarterly results include an operational gain of S$10.1 million 
in Q1 FY2013 on account of fair valuation of biological assets. 
The quarterly exercise of fair valuation of biological assets was 
started from only Q3 FY2012 and hence there was no operational 
gain/ loss booked in the corresponding period of FY2012.67 


 
c. During Q4 2011, Olam reported zero interest income on the income 


statement and zero interest income received on the statement of cash 
flows, despite reporting an average cash balance of S$818.1 million for 
the quarter.   


d. In Q3 2010, Olam reported receiving interest income of negative S$11.7 
million on its statement of cash flows. There was no footnote to explain 
why this was the case, or revision of it later.     


e. In Q3 2008, Olam reported receiving proceeds of S$27.5 million from 
capital expenditures and paying out S$1.7 million relating to disposal of 
PP&E. 


6) Appearance of window dressing Q4 results to improve FY results: 
a. Commodity Financial Services earns all of its Gross and Net Contributions 


in Q4 of FY2009 and FY2010.  We find this suspicious and have seen this 
type of lumpy accounting treatment before in Chinese RTO companies.   


b. Shipping and Logistics varies widely from quarter to quarter.  In Q4 2012, 
it nearly tripled from the prior quarter, despite overall sales volume only 
increasing by 28.2%.  Volume is a very strong indicator of what Shipping 
and Logistics expenses should be: for there to be a 7.0x magnitude 
difference in the change is odd. 


 
We believe that to an extent Olam Management might be using desired income and cash 
balances as inputs into its financial statements rather than outputs.  Olam’s financials 
contain frequent revisions of material line items for material amounts, with no 
corresponding impact on the bottom line.  These issues are reminiscent of the US-listed 
China RTO frauds.  We are unaware of similar restatement patterns for any companies 
that are comparable in size to Olam.  We have reproduced the most egregious changes in 
this report. 
 
                                                
67 FY2013 Q1 Filing, p. 13
Page 37 of 133 


There is also the issue of certain numbers that make no sense.  For instance, from its IPO 
through Q2 2010, interest income recorded on the income statement always matched 
interest income received as recorded on the statement of cash flows.  This is standard for 
many companies that are generating interest without the use of non-current assets: even 
accrued interest falls under interest income because the asset under which the accrual is 
being generated is itself cash or a cash equivalent, making the accrual also a cash 
equivalent.  However, in Q3 2010, Olam recorded S$1.6 million in interest income on the 
income statement, and then recorded negative S$11.7 million in interest income received 
on the statement of cash flows.  In Q4 2011, Olam reported no interest income on the 
income statement or statement of cash flows, despite reporting an average cash balance of 
S$818.1 million for the quarter.  In Q3 2008, Olam reported receiving proceeds of S$27.5 
million from capital expenditures and paying out S$1.7 million relating to disposal of 
PP&E. 
 
Many of the quarterly numbers reported do not match annual reports, or even other 
quarters.  In these instances, it is clear that the numbers have been changed.  However, 
many of these changes should flow through multiple statements.  For instance, if there is 
a change to earnings before taxes on the income statement, that should flow through to 
the top line of the cash flow statement, and if there were a change in the ending cash 
balance on the cash flows statement, that should flow through to the ending cash balance 
on the balance sheet.  We found that in a majority of the cases, the corresponding changes 
to the income statements and balance sheets that should have been coinciding with the 
changes Olam made to its statement of cash flows were non-existent.  These occurrences 
strongly reinforce our opinion that Olam’s accounting is highly problematic.  Below are 
examples: 


 
a. In FY2009, Olam recorded no biological gains.  In FY2010, Olam revised 


the FY2009 numbers to account for fair value changes in biological assets, 
which increased FY2009 Other Income by S$19.0 million.  Somehow, 
this did not have any impact on FY2009’s net income. 


b. In FY2006, Olam’s statement of cash flows in its AR made adjustments to 
its changes in payables and changes in receivables for the year: changes in 
payables were adjusted down by S$12.8 million and changes in 
receivables were adjusted upwards by S$12.8 million.  It is worth noting 
that the final number for changes in receivables was (S$16.9 million), 
meaning that Olam had previously overstated its changes in receivables by 
75.7%.  A decrease in payables only has the same effect as an increase in 
receivables on the balance sheet; these are most likely different accounts 
with different parties and it is hard to think of a good explanation for why 
they would be mixed up.   


c. During FY2007, 16 out of 27 accounts (beside totals) were inconsistent 
from Q4 to the AR statements of cash flows, including two nine-figure 
changes.  These include:
Page 38 of 133 


i. Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes declined by S$213.7 
million.  No change to medium term notes on the balance sheet. 


ii. Proceeds from loans from banks increased by S$195.3 million.  No 
change to amount due to bankers on the balance sheet. 


iii. Change in payables declined by S$30.7 million.  No change to 
payables on the balance sheet. 


iv. The overall decline in cash and cash equivalents increased by 
S$18.4 million.  Even though the change in cash and cash 
equivalents changed by S$18.4 million on the statement of cash 
flows, the “cash and bank balances” line item on the balance 
sheet remained the same between the two filings. 


v. Interest expense paid declined by S$16.8 million.   
vi. Taxes paid declined by S$10.5 million.  No change to provision 


for taxation on the balance sheet. 
vii. Interest income increased by S$3.1 million (34.9%).  This likely 


should have affected net income, but did not. 
viii. Depreciation of PP&E increased by S$0.2 million in the AR.  But 


PP&E on the balance sheet remained exactly the same. 
ix. The prior gain on disposal of PP&E declined by S$0.2 million and 


became a loss on disposal.  This should have affected net 
income, but did not 


x. Change in receivables declined by S$2.0 million.  Trade 
receivables declined by S$6.6 million on the balance sheet—
inconsistent with the change to the statement of cash flows.  


xi. Proceeds from disposal of PP&E increased by S$0.8 million. 
xii. Purchases of PP&E increased by S$2.7 million.  No change to 


PP&E on the balance sheet. 
xiii. Cash used for acquisitions of subsidiaries declined by S$1.1 


million. 
xiv. Investments in jointly controlled entities went from zero to S$0.8 


million. 
xv. Net effect of exchange rate changes increased by S$2.7 million. 


d. On the FY2007 balance sheet, trade receivables decreased by S$6.6 
million and margin accounts with brokers increased by the same amount.  
Similar to other balancing changes made in Olam’s audited reports, we do 
not see how this could be a simple reclassification because there is no 
apparent relationship. 


e. During FY2008, there were a total of 18 discrepancies between the Q4 
numbers and the annual report figures on the statement of cash flows.  
There were only 28 line items total (excluding figures within the statement
Page 39 of 133 


of cash flows that rely on prior figures—though most of these were also 
restated).  The discrepancies included: 


i. Receivables increased by an extra S$55.7 million based on the 
statement of cash flows.  Receivables did not change at all on the 
balance sheet. 


ii. Acquisitions of subsidiaries declined by S$55.5 million. 
iii. Proceeds in loans from banks declined by S$48.7 million, and the 


final net cash balance presented on the statement of cash flows 
declined by S$48.7 million: exactly the same amount.  However, 
on the balance sheet, “cash and bank balances” and “amounts 
due to bankers” remained exactly the same. 


iv. Interest expense paid increased from S$206.2 million to S$218.8 
million. 


v. Net effect of foreign exchange rate changes declined by S$10.3 
million. 


vi. Taxes paid declined by S$5.0 million. 
vii. Interest income declined by S$3.9 million.  This likely should 


have impacted the income statement, but did not. 
viii. Amortization of intangible assets increased by S$0.8 million.  This 


likely should have impacted the income statement, but did not.  
Intangible assets remained the same on the balance sheet as 
well. 


f. 25 out of 36 total line items in the FY2009 AR statement of cash flows 
differed from the figures provided in Q4 2009 statement of cash flows.  
These included numerous items that should have had a material effect on 
net income, yet net income remained the same: 


i. Loans to jointly controlled entities increased by S$251.7 million 
while investments in jointly controlled entities declined by 
S$233.9 million. 


ii. Change in net measurement of derivative instruments moved from 
S$33.8 million to S$61.1 million. 


iii. Decreases in receivables increased by S$25.3 million.  
Receivables increased by S$0.7 million. 


iv. Increases in inventories increased by S$25.2 million.  Inventories 
on the balance sheet only increased by S$13,919. 


v. Allowance for doubtful debts increased from zero to S$19.4 
million.  Adding this in also likely should have reduced net 
income—it did not.
Page 40 of 133 


vi. Increase in payables declined by S$12.8 million. Instead of 
decreasing, the payables on the balance sheet increased by 
S$52.33 million. 


vii. Inventory write-downs went from zero to S$11.2. million.  Adding 
this in likely should have reduced net income and reduced 
inventory—it did neither. 


viii. Interest expense paid decreased by S$10.2 million.  Changing this 
also likely should have changed net income—it did not. 


ix. Proceeds from disposal of PP&E decreased by S$8.2 million.  
PP&E on the balance sheet did not change. 


x. Purchases of PP&E increased by S$4.5 million.  PP&E on the 
balance sheet did not change. 


xi. Share of results from jointly controlled entities increased by S$0.7 
million. 


xii. Share of results from associates decreased by S$0.7 million. 
xiii. Olam recorded S$0.9 million in gain on disposals in its Q4 


earnings release.  In the AR, this was reversed to a S$0.9 million 
loss.  Changing this also should have reduced net income—it 
did not. 


xiv. Negative goodwill recorded declined from S$5.8 million to S$3.7 
million.  Changing this also should have reduced net income—
it did not. 


xv. Impairments of assets increased by S$3.3 million.  Changing this 
also likely should have reduced net income and decreased 
PP&E—it did neither. 


xvi. Amortization of intangible assets declined from S$6.1 million to 
S$2.7 million.  Changing this also likely should have changed 
net income—it did not. 


xvii. Decrease in prepayments declined by S$7.8 million.  There was 
no change to prepayments. 


xviii. Interest income received increased by S$3.1 million.  Changing 
this also likely should have changed net income—it did not. 


xix. Investments in associates decreased by S$24.5 million. 
xx. Proceeds from loans from banks increased by S$0.5 million. 


xxi. Net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents 
decreased by S$5.7 million. 


xxii. Net cash and equivalents increased by S$2.5 million based on the 
statement of cash flows.  Olam got this one right. 


g. 23 out of 35 total line items in the FY2010 AR statement of cash flows 
differed from the figures provided in the Q4 2010 statement of cash flows.
Page 41 of 133 


It is also worth noting that certain figures in the Q4 2010 statements were 
inconsistent with the Q3 2010 statements: for instance, the statement of 
cash flows in Q4 2010 showed zero proceeds from disposal of PP&E, but 
the balance of S$16.1 million for the year was more than double the 
balance shown in the Q3 statement of cash flows (S$7.9 million).  
Similarly, “Investment in jointly controlled entities / associates” declined 
from S$107.7 million in the first 9 months to S$85.5 million in the fiscal 
year, despite the Q4 investment being zero.  Discrepancies with the annual 
report included the following: 


i. Increase in receivables declined by S$362.0 million.  Receivables 
on the balance sheet increased by S$0.1 million. 


ii. Increase in payables and other current liabilities decreased by 
S$150.3 million.  Total change in those items on the balance 
sheet between the Q4 and annual report for FY2012 was 
negative S$38.4 million. 


iii. Purchase of PP&E increased by S$105.8 million.  No change to 
PP&E on the balance sheet. 


iv. Cash spent on acquisitions declined by S$81.6 million. 
v. Proceeds from borrowings declined by S$82.4 million.  


Borrowings only declined by S$13.3 million on the balance 
sheet. 


vi. Fair value gains on biological assets of S$54.0 million were added, 
which likely should have boosted net income before tax by 
S$54.0 million. 


vii. Net effect of exchange rates on cash declined by S$50.3 million. 
viii. Interest expense paid decreased by S$37.7 million. 


ix. Negative goodwill increased by S$29.2 million. Changing this 
also likely should have changed net income. 


x. Increase in inventories declined by S$16.1 million.  Moving in the 
opposite direction, inventories increased by S$46.2 million on 
the balance sheet. 


xi. Allowance for doubtful debts moved from zero in the Q4 filing to 
S$10.1 million.  Changing this also likely should have changed 
net income. 


xii. Proceeds from disposal of PP&E declined by S$8.0 million. 
h. In the 2011 AR, there were only two numbers that changed from the Q4 


filing: proceeds from borrowings increased by S$133.0 million and the net 
effect of the exchange rate decreased by S$133.0 million.  The two 
changes cancelled each other out, and there was no end effect on cash and 
cash equivalents.   All figures reported on the balance sheet were
Page 42 of 133 


consistent between the two filings.  However, it is hard to understand how 
borrowings and foreign exchange effects could affect one another.  
Further, nothing on the balance sheet was changed—if S$133.0 
million in borrowings disappeared, this likely should have been 
reflected on the balance sheet. 


 
FY2011 COGS Reconciliation 
 
In its Annual Reports, Olam provides a footnote detailing costs/contra-costs incorporated 
into its calculation of COGS.  We attempted to reconcile FY2011 income statement 
COGS with inventory accounts in the notes to the financial statements and found that the 
two numbers are off by S$1.0 billion.  The FY2012 difference of S$83.8 million could be 
reasonable because of operating expenses for biological assets and fair value gains.  
However, the FY2011 number is too large for us to explain.  We calculated this number 
by summing the costs/contra-costs included in the COGS calculation from the COGS 
footnote and adding in the inventory sold (which was provided in a separate footnote to 
the financials), and comparing the figure (“COGS per footnotes”) with the COGS line 
item on Olam’s income statement: 





 
 
2009 Restatement 
 
There was a serious restatement between the 2008 and 2009 buried in Note 41 of the 
2009 AR.  At first glance, it simply seems like some assets and liabilities were cancelled
Page 43 of 133 


out, assets were moved from “other” to interests in jointly controlled entities, and 
profits/losses resulting from foreign exchange rates were moved into/out of COGS.  See 
below:
Page 44 of 133 


2009 AR, p. 173: 
 


 
 
However, this restatement doesn’t jibe with the changes made to Note 5 in the 2009 AR, 
which provides a breakdown of costs included in the cost of goods sold.  See Note 5 from 
the 2008 AR and the 2009 AR: 
 
2008 AR (p. 128):
Page 45 of 133 


2009 AR (p. 124): 
 
 


 
 
Clearly the difference in the COGS line items between the original 2008 AR and the 
2008 figures Annual Report is significantly greater than the S$14.3 million reported in 
Note 41.  Furthermore, there was no change to the foreign exchange line item within the 
cost of goods sold footnote, meaning that the $14.3 million adjustment made to the 
foreign exchange line item is completely unrelated to simply moving it into or outside of 
COGS.  There were significant changes to gains/losses on derivatives and export 
incentives.  The restatement makes no sense—for it to be correct, there must have been 
S$64.5 million in other unexplained increases within the cost of goods sold that were 
unrelated to the massive declines in derivatives and export incentives.  We find this 
baffling.  See below table for a side-by-side comparison of the original COGS breakdown 
and the restatement within the FY2009 AR: 
 


 
 
Olam’s treatment of the adjustment is much more concerning than the adjustments 
themselves. As a listed company, Olam should be open with restatements and their 
reasons for them, but instead, Olam appear to obfuscate these issues by releasing 
seemingly misleading disclosures. These issues raise questions over of how many 
restatements are made that are not discernible and just how reliable are Olam’s accounts.
Page 46 of 133 


Biological Assets 
 
Generally, people do not refer to how much money they might make in future years as 
though it has already been earned.  But that is exactly what Olam does in its accounting 
statements: Olam uses potential future income from biological assets as a significant 
portion of its present net income.  This accounting mitigates the P&L impact of its poor 
business performance.  
 
Biological gains actually have a higher future cost than does negative goodwill.  
Companies may take biological gains on biological assets (e.g., livestock, almond 
orchards) when the estimated present value of those assets has increased above their 
carrying values.  However, today’s biological gain is tomorrow’s loss.  Unlike negative 
goodwill, the gains booked today must be balanced out by losses as the asset’s 
productivity decreases.   
 
Olam has booked a total of S$264.2 million in profit from biological gains.  Biological 
gains for each period are determined via an internal model that has numerous inputs that 
are not made public – as a result, it could be susceptible to manipulation by Management.  
Biological assets are a mark-to-model asset, and Olam treats them similar to how Enron 
treated its power contracts: recognizing big gains upfront. 
 
Aggressive accounting isn’t exclusive to Olam’s income statement.  Part of Olam’s 
biological assets is its annual crops:   
 


Annual crops consist of seeds for various commodities (cotton, onions, tomatoes and 
other vegetables) that are given to farmers to sow and grow. Farmers take all the harvest 
risks and bear all the farming costs. On harvesting of the commodities, the Group has the 
first right to buy the produce from these farms.68 


 
You read that right: Olam is booking farmers’ future crops as its own assets.  Further, in 
FY2012, Olam managed to record S$46.8 million in net additions to biological assets, 
which it reported was primarily from annual crops and livestock, despite the fact that the 
total hectares of annual crops were cut in half over the year (emphasis added): 


 
At the end of the year, the Group’s total planted area of plantations and annual 
crops that is yielding is approximately 15,374 (2011: 14,710) hectares and 2,522 
(2011: 4,504) hectares respectively excluding hectares for those commodities 
whose plantations are not managed by the Group.

Below is the footnote detailing net additions to biological assets:69 
 


 
 
Biological Gains on Office Equipment 
 
In the 2010 AR, some 2009 figures were restated when biological assets were added in.  
These restatements included a suspicious yet comical redistribution of PP&E from the 
office equipment category to biological assets.  Below is Note 9 from the 2009 AR (pg. 
128):  
 





                                                
69 Olam 2012 Annual Report
Page 48 of 133 


 
The FY2009 ending balance for “Office Equipment” on a cost basis is S$36.4 million.  
Below is the PP&E note to the financials published with the 2010 AR (Note 10, p. 119): 
 


 
 
The cost basis for “Office Equipment” as of June 30, 2009 decreased from S$36.4 million 
in the FY2009 AR to S$16.8 million in the FY2010 AR.  So what happened to the S$19.6 
million (S$19,629,000 to be precise)?  It turned into biological assets (p. 88, 2010 AR): 
 


 
 
With the addition of biological assets to the FY2009 financials, there was also a change 
in the income statement: “Other Income” in FY2009 increased by S$19.0 million to 
account for the new biological gains.  This should have affected net income, and 
subsequently affected the statement of cash flows.  However, instead, COGS also
Page 49 of 133 


increased by an identical amount, as did capital expenditures.  Given that Olam was 
simply moving assets from one category to another, this is hard to understand. 
 
We understand that biological computers are a number of years off.  However, if Olam 
has succeeded in developing biological computers, we would consider changing our 
investment thesis. 
 


Olam’s	
  CapEx	
  is	
  Off	
  the	
  Rails	
  
Olam’s snowballing CapEx is, in our view, destroying investor value, and pushing the 
company toward collapse.  Olam tells investors that its CapEx projects are creating 
significant long-term value, and are generally meeting their targets.  Then Olam borrows 
more money for more projects. In this way, Olam reminds us of a degenerate gambler, 
losing money only to delude others (possibly as well as itself), borrowing more and 
doubling down; losing again, borrowing more and doubling down; and so on.  Olam 
regularly touts its ability to manage risk.  However, just saying something does not make 
it true.  On a macro level, it is obvious that something is severely amiss with Olam’s 
CapEx spending.   
 
The truly interesting aspect of Olam’s CapEx is that it seems to spend less cash on 
acquisitions than perceived; but, spends much more on non-acquisition CapEx than 
investors understand.  This implicates various possibilities, including the possibility that 
Olam is pursuing more greenfield projects than investors realize.  If true, that fact would 
alter Olam’s risk profile.  Another issue is the specter of poor internal controls and 
substantial cash leakage. 
 
The total acquisition consideration Olam has announced exceeds actual payments by 
S$571 million.  Yet investors and analysts are often unaware when a project has died.  
Olam does not publicize the failure.  When Olam does buy companies, it often buys 
businesses that are on life support – heavily indebted and marginally profitable.  It often 
announces consideration numbers well in excess of cash payments.  Rusmolco is one 
example (actual cash outlay of S$8.5 million, versus announced “up to” S$75 million).70  
Despite spending far less on acquisitions than announced, Olam’s cash burn and debt 
levels ceaselessly increase. 
 
On the other hand, Olam’s non-acquisition CapEx has become massive.  We cannot 
account for cumulative S$996.2 million in booked (but unattributed) non-acquisition 
CapEx over the last four years.  Olam has never satisfactorily explained its FY2012 non-
acquisition CapEx of S$875 million.

Olam has won awards for transparency; however, we believe these accolades were not 
due.  Olam excels at disclosing volumes of information.  The usefulness and accuracy of 
it are different matters.  Olam’s acquisitions highlight this issue. 
 
It is eye-opening to read through analyst reports and find mentions of joint ventures and 
greenfield projects that analysts cite as contributing to Olam meeting its 2016 S$1.2 
billion net income target, yet have never materialized since their public announcement. 
Olam has a knack for generating publicity for new agreements, while it avoids informing 
investors and analysts when the agreements fail to materialize.  Here are just three 
examples of such agreements that have fallen to the wayside with little to no disclosure: 
 


1. The joint venture with the Lababidi Group to build a port-based sugar refinery in 
Lagos failed to launch.  We understand that this project stalled due to permit 
problems, and Olam reported that minimal CapEx has been spent on it.  Some 
analysts have included the joint venture in their financial models as contributing 
to Olam’s 2016 S$1.2 billion PAT goal, which may present a serious problem for 
Olam.  Olam’s 4Q2011 financial statements cite the Nigerian Sugar Refinery 
among those items accounting for its spend on property, plant, and equipment.71 


 
2. Two joint ventures with the Modandola Group were announced in 2009 to build a 


sugar refinery and purchase a share in Standard Flour Mill; however, they have 
since never been mentioned by name.72  We understand these never commenced. 


 
3. The groundbreaking joint venture with Chinatex was announced in 2007. Two 


whole pages were devoted to the joint venture in the 2007 annual report,73 but 
after that it was not mentioned again (see The China Syndrome).  We understand 
this never commenced.  


 
Olam also confuses investors and analysts by discussing acquisitions in the annual reports 
that have not yet been completed, such as the Brazil sugar mill.74  Further confusion 
arises from the press releases that provide the enterprise value but, and this may be for 
procedural reasons, Olam does not give any indication of how much cash would actually 
be spent (it seems very little, because the facility is heavily indebted - US$100 million 
out of US$128.8 million value, according to the Financial Times.)75   
 
                                                
71 Olam, 4Q11, Financial statements, p. 21. 
72 In the investor presentation for Crown Flower Mills pg. 19, there is a comparison table to an unnamed 
“Earlier Deal” and a foot note indicating that “The earlier deal announced on September 15, 2008 prior to 
due diligence.  The deal was not consummated nor completed.” 
73 FY2007 Annual Report, pp. 20-21. 
74 p.45 2012 Annual Report implies that the investment closed:  “…we did not invest until we had secured a 
facility offering significant structural advantages, and was available at the right price.” 
75 May 29, 2012 Financial Times article, “Olam pays $129 million for Brazilian Sugar Mill.”
Page 51 of 133 


Looking through analyst reports there is a gross overestimate of cash paid for 
acquisitions.  We believe this may be part of the reason why investors seem not to have 
noticed the disparity between CapEx announced and the amount actually spent. The table 
below sets out the actual cash spent on acquisitions and the amounts analysts had thought 
were spent: 
 





Non-­‐Acquisition	
  Capital	
  Expenditure	
  –	
  So	
  Black	
  Holes	
  do	
  Exist!	
  


When looking through the Olam cash flow statement in the 2012 Annual Report, one 
figure stood out more than any other, and that was the S$875 million cash out flow for 
the purchase of property, plant and equipment.  This number does not include acquisition 
spending.  There is a distinct lack of disclosure for this expenditure, particularly when as 
much as 60.3% of this spend was deployed in one quarter, Q4 2012.  
 
As Olam has avoided delineating its CapEx spend, we have gathered all evidence 
possible from announcements on Olam’s website, local press, and analyst reports in order 
to build a model of Olam’s capital expenditures.  We were shocked by the disparity 
between the amount of capital expenditure that was spent compared to the amount Olam 
has disclosed on a project-by-project basis. As can be seen in the table below, Olam has 
spent S$1.587 billion over the last four years on property, plant and equipment.
Page 52 of 133 


 
However, we have only been able to find announced projects totaling S$590.8 million, a 
difference of S$996.2 million.  To reiterate, we have reviewed and analyzed all press 
releases and presentations on Olam’s websites and read through all the analyst reports we 
could obtain but have not been able to identify any further announced capital spend to 
bridge this gap. 
 
We understand that Olam only announces projects that will require a capital investment 
over US$15 million. Olam may argue that this undisclosed spending is all maintenance.  
However, it is unreasonable to suggest that it spent S$500 million on routine maintenance 
in 2012 alone. Additionally, if these are all smaller projects, for example US$10 million, 
then Olam would have to be spending US$10 million on 57 projects alone in 2012, and 
100 over the last four years.  That would be surprising. 
 
As a stakeholder in the company, especially a bondholder, the most worrying questions 
must be, “Where has my money gone?” and, “How am I going to get it back?”

The truth about the January 2010 Crown Flour Mill (“CFM”) acquisition should greatly 
alarm investors, particularly given the money Olam is now spending on acquisitions and 
CapEx.  There is more than a hint of impropriety about this transaction, including 
massive asset value overstatement, and misleading disclosures about the asset at the time 
of purchase.  However, CFM appears to be far away from hitting any of the profitability 
targets Olam laid out for it almost three years ago.  It did not even generate positive 
operating cash flow in FY2011.

When Olam acquired CFM on January 12, 2010, it valued the net PP&E at S$168.6 
million.  The PP&E was revalued upward in two steps – first by 257.2% by the former 
owners, the Lababidi Group, and then by 25% by Olam itself upon purchasing CFM.  The 
real book value of the acquired assets should have been less than S$38 million – probably 
much less.  To corroborate that CFM’s assets were overvalued when Olam acquired the 
company, our investigators learned that Olam demolished one of the two factory 
buildings at the main factory, and replaced substantially all of the acquired equipment.  
Olam has never taken an impairment on CFM.  In fact, it revalued CFM’s PP&E upward 
by 25.0% 13 days after its prior balance sheet.  Olam bought CFM from a questionable 
seller - the Lababidi Group, which is controlled by Chief Maan Lababidi, who was 
arrested in 2012 for his alleged role in a Nigerian stock fraud.  He was subsequently 
released but remains clouded in suspicion.

Under the former owner, the Lababidi Group, CFM revalued its assets in CY2007 
upward by 257.2%, from S$54.5 million to S$194.5 million.  Without the revaluation, 
that PP&E would have been worth only S$38.6 million at the end of CY2008.
Page 54 of 133 


 
Prior to 2009, CFM consisted of three separate companies – Crown Flour Mills, Inter-
state Flour Mills, and Mix & Bake Flour Mills.  Chief Lababidi controlled all of them.  
Near the end of CY2007, the three CFM companies had the assets revalued by a local 
valuation firm.76  The result was a stunning 257.2% increase in the group’s net PP&E 
from S$55.5 million (NGN 4.5 billion) to S$194.5 million (NGN 15.9 billion).  The 
tables below show the effects of the revaluation on the 2007 and 2008 combined balance 
sheets in NGN and SGD: 
 





 
 
 
A note to the FY 2011 CFM financials confirmed that the numbers were correct: 
 





                                                
76 The firm was Oludemi Jagun Dosumm & Co.

The CY2008 Directors’ Reports from the three CFM companies make clear that the 
PP&E was in poor shape. 
 


Excerpts from the 2008 Directors Reports, Future Developments77 
Crown Flour Mills The Company will continue to place more emphasis on the 


quality of its finished Products, and seek improvement on 
existing production lines, as well as replacement of 
existing manufacturing facilities. 


Inter-State Flour Mills The Company is expanding its production capacity.  It 
intends to place more emphasis on the development of its 
full range of finished products and also intends to install 
new production lines while replacing all existing facilities. 


Mix & Bake Flour Mills The Company is expanding its production capacity.  It 
intends to place more emphasis on the development of its 
full range of finished products and also intends to install 
new production lines while replacing all existing facilities. 


 
CFM Lagos workers spoke to our investigators and told them that the acquired PP&E 
was old and poorly maintained, and that Olam disposed of it after the acquisition and 
demolished some of the factory buildings in Lagos.  Below are some quotes our 
investigators received from current CFM Lagos workers. 
 


“Initially two buildings were used for production, but one of the factories has 
been demolished early in the year of 2011 and a new construction is ongoing.” 


 
“Most of the equipments bought from the Lababidi Group were outdated and the 
new owner replaced them.” 


 
When asked about what equipment was added immediately after the acquisitions:  
 


“Only equipments were replaced.  One of the factories was demolished and is 
being reconstructed.” 


 
Analysis of satellite and investigators’ photographs confirm some portions of the plant 
were demolished.  Below is a satellite image of Tin Can Island, including the plot where 
CFM is located.  Photographs of the current physical plant at CFM were taken from 
several angles along the river.   The locations of the angles from which the photographs 
were taken are marked on the image.  The locations of the original mill, the new 
construction, and construction in progress are indicated in the photos below:

When Olam bought CFM on January 12, 2010, it valued the PP&E at S$168.6 million, 
which was a 25% increase over CFM’s carrying value in only 13 days.  Below is Olam’s 
allocation of the CFM purchase price, which shows the S$168.6 million PP&E value. 
 
2010 AR, p. 124 
 


 
 
Below is the PP&E detail from CFM’s audited financial statements showing that its 
carrying value was only NGN 14.4 billion, or S$134.9 million.  Olam upped the valuation 
by 25.0% just 13 days later:
Page 58 of 133 


 
CFM FY 2010 Audited Financials: 
 


 
 
The June 30, 2010 financials show that instead of the increase Olam recorded on its 
Group-level accounts, CFM’s net book value of PP&E decreased in the first six months 
of Olam’s ownership.  This confirms that the 25% increase in value recorded at the 
Group level is pure fiction; it did not even make it down to the entity. 
 
It is hard to think that Olam’s acquisition of CFM was a clean deal.  With CFM, Olam 
bought equipment that was of low quality and apparently later scrapped.  Yet Olam took 
no impairment.  The sellers had revalued it upward by 257.2% two years before selling it 
to Olam. 13 days after buying CFM, Olam then did its own upward revaluation of exactly 
25.0% on top of the earlier revaluation. CFM is the acquisition we have studied most 
closely, but we suspect that its problems are not atypical of Olam’s acquisitions.

The controlling shareholder of CFM, “Chief” Maan Lababidi, was arrested in June 2012 
for his alleged role in an alleged stock fraud allegedly carried out by one of his other 
companies, allegedly Starcomms.78  He has been released, but remains clouded in 
suspicion.  The good Chief is also being sued by former CFM investors for an alleged 
discrepancy of about 50% of the proceeds Olam paid for CFM. 79

When Olam acquired CFM in January 2010, it had book value of shareholders’ equity of 
S$42.2 million.  However, as we showed supra, that included a significant and highly 
questionable PP&E revaluation.  Without that revaluation, CFM’s shareholders’ equity 
would have been negative S$64.7 million.  
 
Below is a table showing summary income statement data in SGD for the four years prior 
to Olam’s acquisition of CFM.  CY2006 – CY2008 are not pro forma for the 2009 
combination.  CY2009 is consolidated.  CFM was consistently losing money.

When Olam acquired CFM, it projected that CFM would achieve the following

• EBITDA of US$35 million.  FY2011 reported EBITDA was only US$11.8 
million (NGN 1.8 billion).   


• EBITDA margins in excess of 15%.  FY2011 reported EBITDA margin was only 
6.7%. 


• Profits Before Tax of US$23.3 million.  FY2011 reported PBT was only US$1.7 
million (NGN 260 million).   


• PBT margin in excess of 10%.  FY2011 reported PBT margin was only 1.0%.

The acquisitions we have analyzed are generally consistent in providing Olam with 
revenue, but with minimal (to no) profits.  CFM fits this pattern. 
 
CFM’s reported operating cash flow since Olam acquired it has been negative:

  for

  raises	
  serious	
  concerns.	
  


Olam’s cash flow accounting for CFM raises concerns about whether Olam knows how 
much cash it really spent on the acquisition.  The issue with Olam’s accounting is that it 
states it paid S$15.9 million more in cash than it seems it should have.   
 
The FY2010 AR (p. 124) details the cash outflows for the acquisition.  Olam is claiming 
that it paid cash consideration of 1x book value, or S$70.1 million.  (As we explain supra, 
the book value was inflated.)  However, there is another disclosure that Olam had an 
additional cash outflow of S$15.9 million for Cash and Cash Equivalents of Subsidiary 
Acquired.  This S$15.9 million outflow seems to match the net overdraft balance CFM 
maintained. 
 
The problem is that Olam already subtracted this overdraft balance to arrive at the S$70.1 
million book value.  If Olam paid the S$15.9 to the bank, then there should be no issue.  
However, the fact that there was still a significant overdraft balance as of June 30, 2010 is 
concerning.  What is this S$15.9 million cash outflow?

“We pack garbage for them anyway and they always take it, but we’ve hit new lows.” – 


Randal Rahal, former Director of SK Foods (the predecessor to Olam Tomato 
Processing) on SK Foods prior to its sale to Olam. 


 
We recommend that investors disregard S$94.5 million (26%) of profit after taxes for the 
2010 financial year (and associated shareholders’ equity) because it resulted from highly 
questionable negative goodwill associated with an upward re-valuation of the acquired 
assets of SK Foods – now called Olam Tomato Processing.  There are three reasons why 
the re-valuation is highly questionable: 1) the book value of the assets at the time Olam 
acquired them was S$73.1 million lower, 2) Olam is now appealing the tax assessors’ 
valuations of the assets to levels far below even the book value at the time Olam acquired 
them, and 3) Olam seems not to have been able to realize value from the assets.

  Likely	
  Unjustified	
  


This section will explain our opinion that Olam’s acquisition of SK, although purchased 
out of bankruptcy, was not the bargain the company claimed it to be.  The primary 
reasons for our contention are listed below. 
 
- The Company’s S$94.5 million negative goodwill gain83 resulted largely from 


valuing the PP&E at S$189.9 million (US$130.6 million).  However, the SK 
Foods bankruptcy documents include a detailed schedule of assets, which report 


                                                
83 Olam 2010 Annual Report, Note 11.
Page 65 of 133 


the book value of SK Foods PP&E as being only S$116.8 (US$80.3) million at 
the time of the acquisition, a difference of S$73.1 million (US$50.3 million).84 
 


- In the course of investigating the valuation discrepancy, we uncovered an 
incidence of a major upwards tax assessment asset value revaluation of the 
Williams plant one year post-acquisition, which covers much of the S$73.1 
(US$50.3) million difference.  One might wonder whether Olam sought this 
reappraisal to support the negative goodwill. 


 
- This upwards revision of the PP&E asset value at the Williams plant was 


followed by a more recent effort to undo the upward assessment through an 
appeal filed by Olam.  The appeal claimed that its Williams plant should only be 
assessed by the local tax authority at one-tenth of its current value or US$7.1 
million (from its current US$70.4 million valuation), a US$63.3 (S$77.3 
million85) downward revaluation.  


 
- There appear to be legacy issues that Olam hasn't fully resolved, including 


probable product safety and sanitation issues. We also question whether Olam has 
been able to salvage key customer relationships. These are exactly the kinds of 
issues one would want to understand through due diligence, for which many other 
potential bidders apparently felt there was not enough time.   


 
- Since the acquisition, it appears that Olam has been earning a negative return on 


the investment. Now, some three years into the new business plan, the Company 
has finally disclosed that the operation is under-performing, required a large 
inventory liquidation and write down as well as operational “resizing.”  As of 
4Q12, Olam Tomato Processors was ignominiously listed along with the 
Company’s chronic disclosed underachievers Open Country Dairy Limited 
(OCDL) and Pure Circle as operating “below par”.86  (As is clear from our report, 
those three companies are only the tip of the iceberg of Olam’s poorly performing 
investments.) 


Background	
  –

  “Racketeering	
  Organization”87	
  	
  


SK Foods was a tomato processor with two processing facilities in Lemoore and 
Williams, California.  It was a large supplier of processed tomatoes to US packaged 
goods companies, such as Kraft, Frito-Lay, and other major brands.  According to the 
Company, SK was the second largest tomato processor in the US and in the top five in 
the world.  However, in 2008 SK foods shocked the nation as a major scandal unfolded.  
As a result of a joint investigation by the FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, FDA Office of

US Department of Justice, March 23, 2012, 
http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2012/281505.htm
Page 66 of 133 


Criminal Investigations, and the US DOJ Anti-Trust Division, ten of its officers and 
senior managers, including the owner and CEO Scott Salyer, were indicted for, and plead 
guilty to, charges relating to racketeering, money laundering, anti-trust, food misbranding 
and food adulteration.88  Salyer admitted to the US Department of Justice that: 
 


“SK Foods routinely falsified the lab test results for its tomato paste… ordered 
employees… to falsify tomato paste grading factor, and… lied about its product’s 
percentage of natural tomato soluble solids, mold count, production date, and 
whether the tomato paste qualified as “organic.”89 


 
As revelations of the sale of unsafe products being sold for years and cover–ups through 
document fraud came to light, considerable concern about product quality and safety was 
justified.  Trade magazines such as Food Safety News brought to light the comments of 
company executives such as Randall Lee Rahal, a Director of SK Foods, and the 
salesman, who in December of 2008, was one of the first to plead guilty and cooperate in 
the investigation.90 Rahal’s statements on  SK’s operations revealed little to no concern 
for quality, and no intention to improve: 


 
“We pack garbage for them anyway and they always take it, but we’ve hit 
new lows.”91    


 
For a period of more than ten years, CEO Salyer and key managers and employees 
coordinated a racketeering enterprise, paid kickbacks to customers to buy products and 
pay inflated prices, and falsified product quality documents to allow moldy tomato paste 
and other sub-standard products to be passed off as compliant with FDA requirements, 
USDA requirements, “organic”, or compliant with other customer specifications.  The 
scandal was national news, and these headlines caught the attention of Olam, which was 
eager to expand its US and packaged food businesses.   To Olam, an opportunity to pick 
up a large processing company at a discount, gain quick entry to a new segment of the US 
processed foods market, and potentially pick up over $200 million in revenue, must have 
looked ripe.

that most of the potential bidders did not feel comfortable with the short window to 
conduct due diligence – particularly given the myriad issues associated with SK.95  Olam, 
however, appears to have had a much stronger desire, and much higher tolerance for the 
risk associated with the acquisition of the pariah processor.  Olam ultimately was the sole 
bidder.  
 
Following the acquisition, Olam booked a S$94.5 million negative goodwill gain.  
Although SK was purchased out of bankruptcy, we seriously question the underlying 
revaluation of the assets and company.  In our opinion, little – to none – of this gain is 
justified. 


PP&E	
  Valuation	
  Increased	
  


According to the Company’s 2010 AR note 11, Olam booked a S$94.5 million negative 
goodwill gain.  This appears to have primarily resulted from an asset assessment that 
valued PP&E at S$189.9 million (US$130.6 million).  This higher value coincides 
perfectly with the company’s estimated replacement cost of US$120-$130 million 
announced in the June 26, 2009 investor presentation.96

Evidently Olam determined the value of the PP&E and its potential to provide a negative 
goodwill gain, prior to the close of the sale.  Again, many other potential buyers felt that 
the time period was too short to do due diligence, let alone estimate the equipment’s 
replacement costs.  The SK Foods Bankruptcy documents, which include a detailed 284-
page schedule of assets and liabilities, indicate that the book value of SK Foods’ assets, 
was only US$80.3 million, which was a difference of US$50 million.

Our additional investigation into the valuation of these assets found that the Williams 
land, physical plant, and fixed assets were valued by the Colusa County Assessors Office 
in 2008 and 2009 at only US$13.4 million (approx. S$19.4 million).  Interestingly, in 
2010, the year following the sale and subsequent to the issuance of Olam’s FY2010 
Annual Report, the assessed value of the fixed assets jumped from US$6.7 million in 
2009 to US$38 million in 2010, and the total assessed value of all assets increased by 
US$40.7 million to US$54.2 million.

revenue?  When questioned about the matter, the Colusa County Assessors Office was 
not forthcoming on the details behind the large revaluation.

Whatever the real reason for the increase in valuation one year after the close of the 
transaction, Olam’s Tomato Processors, Inc. does not believe that this is an accurate 
valuation for its assets.  It has filed an appeal of this valuation.   Olam is now arguing that 
its Williams plant should only be assessed by the local tax authority at US$7.0 million, 
one-tenth its US$70.4 million assessment.  Olam’s appeal is available in the Appendix 
Colusa County Application for Changed Assessment. The details are below:

Olam is also contesting tax assessment increases at its Lemoore plant.  In August of this 
year, Olam filed a series of property assessment appeals.  According to the appeal 
documents available in the Appendix Lemoore Property Assessment Appeals, Olam’s 
official opinion of the combined value of the land, structures and fixtures is only 
US$9,820,050, versus its current assessed value of $98.4 million.  Management contests 
the county assessor’s valuation on the basis of: 
 


1. A decline in value.  The assessor’s roll value exceeds the market value as of 
January 1 of the current year. 


2. Assessor’s value of personal property and/or fixtures exceeds market value.   
 
We recognize that Olam could be staking out a negotiating position; but, if we assume 
that Olam wants to pass the laugh test in its appeals, these 90% proposed reductions 
should not be too far from the mark.

Our investigators visited the Williams plant in October 2012.  Three workers were very 
willing to speak with our investigators.  They expressed their opinion that the 
management was “very unprofessional.”  Their comments provide an inside look into a 
company with possible issues with management, operations, and quality.97  (Note that we 
have been unable to confirm these comments outside of these interviews.)

• The equipment is dirty, frequently with “moho” (mold) on the underside. 
• The workers also complained of low wages.  They were paid only US$12.64 per 


hour, US$3.56 lower than the US$16.20 per hour at the Morning Star plant down 
the road. 


• They received no training, were issued gloves that would fall apart, and 
promotions are not based on performance.   


• The workers also stated that they would not eat canned tomato products. 
 
Perhaps, most troubling however were their statements that starting in late September, a 
large quantity of product had been put “on hold.”  The workers explained that there was a 
large warehouse on the premises, and this is full of boxes that contained an orange sticker 
labeled “HOLD.”  This inventory might be better having been destroyed.

At the time of the acquisition, the company announced that capacity utilization would 
initially be lower, given the limited time to complete contracts with growers, but was 
expected to scale up in FY2011, reach steady state in FY2012, and then be able to deliver 
revenue in line with that generated by SK Foods prior to 2008.  Additionally, the 
company estimated that within three years it would potentially generate US$200 million 
in revenue with EBITDA margins of 12-13%.98  These numbers too seem highly 
questionable, as cursory due diligence at the time of the acquisition should have raised 
red flags. 
 
The bankruptcy documents provide information on sales prior to FY2008.  In the final 
eight months of FY2007 (ended June 30, 2007) SK generated revenue of US$103.8 
million.99  On an annualized basis, that would amount to US$155.7 million.100101  This 
revenue was earned in part through SK’s corrupt activities involving bribing buyers for 
contracts and inflating sales prices.  A revenue projection in-line with inflated historical 
levels that does not discount for lost customers and reputational issues seems to be overly 
optimistic. 
 
Subsequent to the acquisition, Olam initially reported positive news, listing Olam Tomato 
Processors as among fourteen of the midstream businesses adding higher margin to the 
value chain in the 2010 Annual Report,102 and later noting a “very strong performance in 
the spiced and dehydrates business on the back of consolidation of the performance of the

tomato processing facility and operations of Gilroy Foods into the segment.”103  
However, beginning in the financial statements for 3Q2012, the Company reversed itself 
and began disclosing problems in the tomato processing business.  In the 4Q2012 
financial statements, the Company elaborated (emphasis added): 
 


The tomato processing business in California however continued to face 
unfavorable trading conditions, and had a poor Q4, to end FY2012 well below 
plan.  Due to a global industry wide supply glut, there had been an excess 
inventory build up in the industrial paste business, leading to softer market prices. 
Most of our industrial paste inventory has been liquidated or marked down to 
market in Q4 FY2012. More importantly, multiple initiatives have been taken to 
increase own farming volumes, the enhancement of product mix, expand value 
added retail lines, enter into long term outsourcing contracts with customers and 
re-size industrial paste capacity, which should enable this business to deliver in-
line with our strategic plans from FY2013 onwards.104 


Olam’s excuse of a glut in the tomato paste market is questionable.  Olam’s mark down 
of paste prices seems to be due to its own failure to sell through.  Olam bought into the 
industry just after paste prices peaked in the 2008-2009 season. While market prices for 
tomato paste have declined since their acquisition, they remain above the historical trend, 
and are still 22% above those from 1999-2006.

Additionally, channel checks with a major multinational tomato sauce manufacturer’s 
global buyer contradict the claim of a “global glut.”  Industry statistics do show a build 
up in inventory starting in the 2008-2009 canning season, but the 2011-2012 season saw

record depletions and record exports.106  Since Olam purchased the cannery in the 2009-
2010, its production-planning decisions fed into any industry inventory build-ups in 
2010-2011.  Its corrective actions to re-size capacity, seek long-term contracts, and 
produce more product for retail, indicate there may be serious problems with its inherited 
customer base, resulting in insufficient demand.  It seems that SK did not just produce 
tainted tomatoes, but also a tainted company reputation.

US tomato exports have been experiencing rapid growth every year since the 2006-2007 
season (with the exception of 2009-2010 due to global impact of the financial crisis), 
tripling in volumes by tonnage over this period.  Certainly with its global reach and sales 
network, the market dynamics that enable record growth of exports for the industry as a 
whole should enable Olam to exploit this opportunity and outperform.

Excess inventory and write downs imply a failure to plan and execute properly.   
 
We find it interesting that given the synergies Olam claims when making the case for its 
global acquisition binge, which included buying an existing tomato paste distribution 
business in Africa, the Company does not plan to utilize its own sources of paste to 
supply its African operations upon start up.  As per the HSBC analyst report from July of 
this summer, the plans for supplying the tomato paste sachet business in Nigeria now 
under construction will rely on supply from China when it commences operations, and 
only later might source tomato paste from the US.109  Why wait when there is a company 
owned processing plant in the US in need of customers? 
 
The Company’s recent disclosures of inventory liquidation, and the comments made by 
current workers suggests that the tomato processing operations may be experiencing 
product quality issues, again.  
 


Conclusion	
  


Olam jumped into a very troubled business, but one which offered the prospect of 
booking negative goodwill gains.  Management’s efforts to turn around the company to 
date seem to have been ineffective.  Quality issues might remain and the company may 
be facing yet another large inventory write down in the near future.  In summary, we 
believe that not only are these negative goodwill gains largely unjustified, but also the 
projections of hitting originally announced targets of US$200 million in revenue and 
EBITDA margins of 12-13% were wishful thinking.

Olam’s incremental acquisition of NZFSU was an easily avoidable blunder.  One might 
conclude that Olam’s rationale for buying this flawed company was to generate non cash 
accounting profits.  Olam has hemorrhaged significant cash on this flawed investment.  
 
In 2009, Olam bought 14% of New Zealand Farming Systems Uruguay (“NZFSU”)110, a 
company founded on the idea of applying New Zealand pastoral farming expertise in 
Uruguay, which has high quality, low cost and under-utilized farmland. 


Over the last three years, Olam has increased its shareholding in a quest to take the 
company private. Unfortunately for Olam investors, Olam succeeded.111 NZFSU is a 
project that should never have gone beyond the planning phase. The company was 
plagued with red flags, such as known accounting irregularity, poor planning,

unrestrained spending, negative free cash flow, high debt, and a web of related parties.  
These facts were established prior to, and during, Olam’s acquisition process. It could be 
said that Olam either did not perform adequate due diligence, or was not concerned by 
the myriad of problems.  Olam has consequently squandered substantial capital on this 
acquisition, including by providing a credit line of up to US$110 million in loans to keep 
the company solvent. 


Immediately prior to Olam’s investment, NZFSU’s 2009 financials submitted to the New 
Zealand Exchange included the following publicized gaffe that was referred to the 
Securities Commission for investigation. 112 113  This is the first time we have seen an 
admission of possible accounting shenanigans in a company’s accounts.  The New 
Zealand Exchange investigated, and was apparently satisfied with NZFSU’s explanation. 





Prior to Olam acquiring a controlling stake in NZFSU, there was a cozy family of 
relationships between NZFSU, management company PGG Wrightson (PGG), and PGG 
contract companies.  NZFSU Chairman Keith Smith was also the chairman of PGG.  
NZFSU bought three farms from PGG and gave PGG a contract to manage the farms that 
paid based on gross asset value, not profitability.114 The management contract allowed 
PGG to supply inputs and services to the farm, which it did through a series of 
subsidiaries, many of which have NZFSU as their only customer.  This can be seen in the 
table on page 10 of the Grant Samuel report below:115

Our research shows it doesn’t rain as much, or as consistently, in Uruguay as it does in 
New Zealand, making it difficult for grass fed diary farms to have a consistent, adequate 
supply of cattle feed, and diminishing the raison d'etre of this farm. The lack of quality 
feed results in lower milk production, herd quality, and healthy progeny. The acquired 
land requires irrigation systems, and the herd must be fed concentrated feeds, which 
increase the production cost by 41%.116

Grant Samuel, an investment and advisory group based in Australia, raised a fundamental 
problem with the NZFSU business model in its independent appraisal reporting, “NZS 
has determined that a New Zealand based system involving predominantly grass 
feeding is not viable for a Uruguayan environment”.117  
 
Olam’s involvement with NZFSU has not improved the quality of its management (other 
than no more embarrassing fudging disclosures). NZFSU breached a covenant to 
bondholders by not providing a copy of its business plan to all bondholders by February 
18, 2011.118  Fortunately for NZFSU, this breach was waived by the bondholders on 
March 29, 2011.119 NZFSU is cash flow negative. It lost US$41.9 million over the last 
two years, and owes Olam at least US$95 million on a US$110 million short-term loan 
due soon.  It must raise capital to “meet the remainder of the capital works program and 
to replenish the current funding lines used to meet operating cash requirements.”120

prices were expected to continue to trend downward.121 On the financial side, NZFSU 
expects that it will require an additional US$160 million to complete development of its 
existing farms, fund working capital and repay loans until operating cash flows reach 
break even.122 Olam’s Q1 2013 results reiterated that milk production levels are still 10% 
behind the forecast.  
 
Now that Olam has bought NZFSU, investors will have to hope that past performance 
will be not be a guarantor for future results. 
 
Olam’s M&A team would have, or at least should have, known that NZFSU has been 
losing money since before they targeted the company, is illiquid in the market, and was 
founded on incorrect assumptions that will require enormous capital to fix.  This 
acquisition is puzzling, and might only make sense from a financial engineering 
perspective where Olam buys positions at various prices from low to high, then books a) 
revaluation gains for throwing good money after bad – particularly given that market 
perceptions that Olam will support or acquire the company might have helped push the 
stock price up, and b) biological gains on cattle.

  Idea	
  (Which	
  
is	
  Not	
  Easy)	
  
Olam announced a partnership with Rusmolco on January 30, 2012. The partnership 
created Milky Projects Limited, with Olam owning 75% of the shares. 
 
In Olam’s call with analysts regarding the partnership on January 30, 2012, Olam 
stressed that it is going to leverage the expertise Olam gained from NZFSU (we all know 
how well that worked out). In classic Olam style, its press release announced a purchase 
price of “up to” US$75 million.  However, there is a lot of room to reach the US$75 
million mark.  The actual cash out flow is only S$8.5 million, and appears to be loss-
making. Typical of Olam, Rusmolco is heavily indebted S$90 million.123 
 
Unfortunately for investors, Rusmolco bears more than a passing resemblance to NZFSU.  
Rusmolco appears to be loss-making. 124  Never fear, Management has assured the market 
that the cash will be funded, not by Olam, but through Rusmolco’s internal accruals and 
Russian government subsidies125.  It appears that some of the incentives are really just 
US$109.9 million of debt from state-owned lender Russian Agricultural Bank.126  
Apparently US$53.4 million of the loan will be to replenish working capital.  Working 
capital replenishment is the largest single use of the loan.

Essentially, the business plan is to partner a loss-making dairy company in Russia with a 
Singaporean company that runs a loss-making dairy operation in Uruguay, with the hope 
that their combined dairy and farming expertise plus a cash injection of US$320 million, 
financed by cash-flows from the loss-making dairy in Russia and loans from Russian 
banks, will put the partnership on the path to profitability. 
 
Olam deserves a lot of credit for its presentation skills.  Its slick Power Points on 
Rusmolco seem to have given a number of analysts a favorable impression of the 
transaction.

On February 11, 2010, Olam announced its intention to construct a 500 MT/Day, 115,000 
MT per year greenfield flourmill in Ghana.  The project cost was projected to be US$31.5 
million.127 On February 27, 2012 the Company announced the completion of the mill 
with a production capacity of 115,000 MT per year at a total cost of US$55 million.128  
This is a cost overrun of 74.6%.  Such inability to control costs might partly explain 
how Olam’s CapEx has exploded in recent periods. 
 
Olam stated in Q3 2012 that capacity utilization was in excess of 70%, and that it 
expected the mill to be profitable within the year.129   However, in Q4 2012, Olam stated 
that it had only attained 50% capacity utilization in the first three months of production, 
and that the mill was profitable.  Claims that the mill ramped up to 70% full capacity 
utilization are already impressive, but questionable.  If the total production capacity 
utilization dropped from 70% at the end of Q3 2012 to only 50% over the first three 
months of operations, this must mean that the first five weeks of Q4 2012 were running at 
less than about 36.5% capacity utilization.  In production operations such as milling, 
economies of a scale are the key to profitability.  Cutting production capacity by half 
should not boost profitability in a brand new flourmill.  These reports defy basic logic.  
We believe that the Company made a reporting error at best.  
 
Olam has also announced that it will increase its planned investment in Ghana by a 
prudent 5x – from US$90 million to US$450 million.130

On December 1, 2011, Olam announced a new 6,000 Ha greenfield state-of-the-art rice 
farm in a remote, difficult to access section of Nasarawa State, Nigeria, with a total 
investment projected to be US$49.2 million).133  The Company intends to invest heavily 
in mechanization and support the farm operation with a new rice mill.  The Company 
expects that at its peak the farm will produce two annual crops per year yielding five 
MT/Ha/Harvest each, with a total crop of 60,000 MT.  After milling, this will be 
converted into 36,000 MT per year of rice.  


This farm is located in a flood plain, known locally as a ‘fadama’134  Flood plains by 
definition are broad, flat areas of land frequently inundated by floods.  In Nigeria, floods 
are the most common and widespread of all natural hazards.135  Prior to this flood, 
Nigeria had experienced severe floods in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2010.  Out of  
Nigeria’s Top 10 worst natural disasters, there are nine floods.136  Nasarawa State, 
where the farm is located, experienced major floods in 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002 and 
2004.137  We question the wisdom of such large investments in a region that experiences 
an intense rainy season, chronic flooding, and suffers from an underdeveloped system of 
infrastructure.138  


This September, Nigeria experienced heavy rainfall, which caused widespread flooding 
and massive damage, submerging most or all of Olam’s Nasarawa rice farm.  
Compounding the flooding downstream, the Nyos dam was opened to prevent it from 
collapsing. The Nyos Dam, in Western Cameroun, controls water flow into the Benue, 
one of Nigeria’s two major rivers.  Olam’s farm is located along the Benue. A 2005 
UNDP report predicted that the dam was at “a point of potential collapse,’’ a failure that 
could release up to 55 million cubic feet of water downstream into Nigeria.139 


Olam has said that only the first phase of the project had been initiated, that it involved 
only 1,000 Ha, and that the crop had been planted just one month before the flooding.  
Since that time, exact estimates of the farm area destroyed have varied from 500 to 1,000 
Ha.  The total impact is yet to be announced, and management did not disclose any detail 
                                                                                                                                            
from Project Manager Regi George. We question how it could be that the locals have one story and 
investors another?

Is	
  Olam	
  Massively	
  Overpromising?	
  


Olam claims that this farm will be able to produce 10 MT/ha of rice per year via two 
crops of five tons each.140  We consulted two Africa-based agriculture experts, including 
one who specializes in rice, to learn whether this target is realistic.  We learned that in the 
developing world, annual rice yields are generally two to four MT/ha.  In the developed 
world, the best annual yields are generally seven to eight MT/ha.  These figures are both 
based on one crop cycle per year.  It is theoretically possible to have two crops per year 
in Nigeria, each of five MT/ha.  However, this apparently requires near flawless 
planning, execution, and very cooperative weather conditions.  Olam and other 
companies have engaged in testing new agricultural techniques in Nigeria, but with 
mixed results.141   


We believe it is extremely unlikely Olam can achieve the targeted production levels, 
especially across the full 6,000 Ha.  If the announced IRR of 28%142 is indeed based on 
the 10 MT/Ha yield, then we believe this project will fail to achieve its objectives.

Kayass	
  Sowing	
  Chaos	
  
Olam’s purchase of Kayass Enterprises just before the close of FY2012 is worrying, and 
its projections for the business approach the absurd.  Kayass appears to be insolvent and 
is losing substantial amounts of money.  In fact, its CY2011 operating loss was almost 
one-third of its revenue, and its after tax loss was almost 70% of revenue! 
 
Olam reported to investors that it acquired Kayass for S$84.2 million (US$66.5 million) 
on June 7, 2012.  Based on the CY2011 financials (shown below), it appears Olam 
assumed all of Kayass’s liabilities as the consideration.  However, this seems to be a 
reckless thing to do, considering Kayass’s total assets were only S$61.8 million as of 
CY2011.  Further, Kayass’s interest expenses are roughly 20% of its average 2011 debt.  
 
Olam says it expects to earn an equity IRR of 35% on Kayass.143  Can Olam even make 
such a projection (along with a 20% EBITDA margin by FY2016)144 in good faith? 
 
Once again, we are left to conclude that Olam wants assets at almost any price:

Shouldn’t	
  China	
  be	
  Easier	
  than	
  Africa?	
  
Four of the China initiatives Olam has announced in the past six years either never got off 
the ground, or have been significantly scaled down or wound up. These presumably 
small, manageable operations should have been easy for Olam to at least maintain, if not 
expand. Olam’s repeated failure to manage small projects provides investors vital clues 
about its ability to manage more complicated and expensive projects. 
 
Between FY2006 and FY2007, Olam started three 100% owned subsidiaries in China, 
Olam Shanghai Limited for S$S1.59 million, Olam Shandong Limited for S$2.22 
million, and Olam Dalian Limited for S$795,000. All three companies had exactly the 
same stated principal activities: sourcing, processing, packaging and merchandising of 
agricultural products.   
 
The quality of Olam’s business decisions is evident: Olam Dalian was deregistered 
during FY2009.  The Olam Shandong operation is selling its factory and other assets in 
Jiaozhou, as its management is no longer interested in processing peanuts.145  Olam 
Shanghai is still operating.  
 
On February 7, 2007, Olam announced two joint ventures with Chinatex, a state-owned 
commodity trader.  The joint ventures were a S$21.1 million deal for a 35% stake in 
Chinatex subsidiary CTGO related to soybean sourcing and processing, and a 50:50 
domestic China cotton joint venture, which according to the Olam press release, would 
conduct “sourcing, ginning, inland logistics, distribution and risk management for the 
domestic cotton market. As part of the transaction, the parties also propose to enter into a

Page 86 of 133 


preferential purchase arrangement, whereby Olam could supply 30% of Chinatex’s 
annual cotton imports, on a competitive basis.”146 This deal was supposed to close in six 
months and per Olam, “The Oilseed and Cotton joint ventures are expected to be earnings 
and value accretive from the first year onwards.”147  


However, the CTGO announced deal fell through after Olam experienced delays in 
obtaining government approval to conduct business with a State Owned Enterprise in 
China.148  We are skeptical that this would be the case, given that the joint venture does 
not appear to be in a politically sensitive industry.  We believe that the other Chinatex 
joint venture fell through as well.

Between June and October of 2007, Olam acquired the publically traded Australian 
company Queensland Cotton Holding (QCH) for a total consideration of A$166.5 million 
(US$136.3 million),149 which was approximately 24.2x TTM PAT.  (PAT for the year 
ended February 28, 2007 was down 47% YoY.150  PAT had been quite volatile for this 
business.)  QCH markets and gins several commodities, including grains, wool, cotton, 
almonds and pulses.  To acquire this company, Olam raised its offer twice, eventually 
bidding A$5.90 per share to beat Louis Dreyfus’s final offer of A$5.85 per share.151  
Olam paid a 76.1% premium to QCH’s A$3.35 share price the day before the 
announcement.152   


The year before this acquisition, QCH had purchased a collection of assets from Twynam 
Holdings, including a cotton farm, several cotton gins, and the rights to gin and market 
Twynam cotton over five to six years for US$25 million.153   


However, Twynam appears to have changed its mind about wanting to sell cotton to 
QCH.  After Olam bought QCH, Twynam seemed to surprise Olam by selling its water 
rights back to the federal government.  


Twynam’s water rights sale appears to have significantly diminished the value of QCH.  
That Twynam would do this so soon after Olam bought QCH, and that Olam appeared to 
have no legal recourse against Twynam, is another example of poor quality due diligence 
efforts by Olam’s management.

Gabon	
  Urea	
  Fertilizer	
  Project	
  –	
  Just	
  a	
  Load	
  of	
  Fertilizer?	
  
If Olam were our child, we would of course encourage it to think it could do anything.  
When it got discouraged, we’d read to it “The Little Engine that Could” and tell it that if 
it works hard, it can be an astronaut someday.  But Olam is not a child – it is a public 
company.  And we cannot tell it that it just has dare to dream in order to pull off the 
Gabon fertilizer project when – to our minds – it lacks the capability to do so. 
 
Olam’s planned urea joint venture fertilizer plant in Gabon created a good deal of 
excitement among investors. However, we are skeptical that it will live up to expectations 
– let alone that will ever be commissioned.  The issues we see with the project are:  
 


• As we show in this report, Olam is a poor planner and executor of far simpler 
projects than this one.  


• The lack of demonstrable progress and unnerving silence by Tata Chemicals are 
early warning signs that the project might not advance.   


• The apparent government supply contract at preferential prices has potential 
issues, including:  


o the gas provider appears to actually be a private business, rather than the 
government; and 


o the amount of supply in question would equal 75% of Gabon’s proven gas 
reserves, and the prorated annual supply to the plant would consume 30% 
of Gabon’s current annual gas output. 


 
In November 2010, Olam announced a joint venture with the government of the Republic 
of Gabon (“RoG”) to build a US$1.3 billion urea based fertilizer plant.154  Olam was to 
own 80% of the project, and RoG 20%.  In April 2011, Olam announced that Tata 
Chemicals will take a 25.1% stake in the project for approximately US$290 million at a 
premium to the valuation at which Olam is contributing its share.155   The remainder of 
the project is supposed to be financed mainly by US$146 million equity from Olam and 
approximately US$845 million of debt.156  At the time of the Tata announcement, Olam 
immodestly projected that its equity IRR on the project will go from over 30% to over 
50%.157 
 
In the two years since the announcement there has been little progress, although Olam 
claims to have spent approximately US$52 million in FY2012 on site preparation.158  As 
of March 21, 2012, Technip, the company hired to design and build the factory stated it

was helping Olam raise the money.159  This could indicate that one of the issues is 
financing.  Along those lines, Tata has not yet invested in the venture.  During Olam’s Q1 
2013 analyst briefing, Olam stated that Tata would be investing in March 2013.  An 
analyst who covers Tata said that Tata would not comment on Olam’s statement.  
However, Tata apparently confirmed that there has been no financial closure on the 
project, and that no company had been awarded the turnkey contract.  (Technip's current 
position is therefore unclear to us.) 
 
Because Olam has demonstrated issues in planning and executing far simpler projects, we 
do not preclude that the delay is due to a non-financing related issue. 
 
One of the core rationales of the project is questionable.  Olam announced that it had 
entered into a “definitive” gas supply contract with the RoG (emphasis added): 
 


“Pursuant to this Agreement, the Company is pleased to announce that it has now 
signed the Implementation and Assignment Agreement and Definitive Gas 
Supply contract with RoG for a cumulative quantity of 0.75 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas for this phase of the Project for a period of 25 years at a competitive 
fixed price.”160  


 
We suspect that the RoG does not actually own the gas supply, as we had seen references 
on the World Bank IFC projects website to the fact that the natural gas is to be supplied 
to the plant by a local gas provider.161  We have spoken to investors and analysts who 
have spoken with the company. We have yet to hear anything but very convoluted 
explanations, including that private parties own the gas and the RoG has a back to back 
contract with them and that the RoG is looking to buy back the gas from the private 
operators and become the sole marketer for the gas. There is also the suggestion that there 
is a law pending in Gabon’s parliament to authorize the government to take these actions. 
Still confused? So are we. We call upon the Company to disclose more information about 
the contract with the RoG, and the stability of the gas price and to clarify the question on 
ownership. 
 
The gas quantity guarantee also raises issues.  Olam’s announcement states the RoG will 
be providing a gas contract for a quantity of “0.75 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas.” We 
question whether such an amount is available over 25 years. The US Department of

of up to 3,000,000 m3/day of gaseous natural gas which is expected to be supplied to the plant by a local 
gas provider. Currently details related to the route, distance, and construction responsibility of the pipeline 
have not been finalized. GFC is committed to assessing impacts and appropriate mitigation of those 
impacts, and to provide this information to IFC once completed and prior to the beginning of any activity 
related to the construction of the pipeline.
Page 89 of 133 


Energy estimates that Gabon has only one trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas 
reserves, making the guarantee equivalent to up to 75% of this estimate of its proven 
reserves.162  Gabon’s annual natural gas output is only 73 billion cubic feet per year.163  
On an annualized basis over 25 years, this commitment is about 30% of annual 
production. 
 
We wonder whether the project has lost one of its key rationales – particularly from the 
Tata point of view – because of the massive and cheap natural gas supply that has come 
online in North America due to hydraulic fracturing (fracking).  The North American 
market seemed to be one of the key markets for the proposed Gabon plant. Olam’s initial 
2010 announcement presentation slides 21 and 22 focused on the US as an export market 
for the fertilizer. 164  Since the initial announcement of the project, the natural gas 
extraction technique known as fracking has made it clear that the US will become the 
world leader in natural gas production, driving down gas prices and making US or North 
American urea production economical.   
 
One of Tata’s competitors, the Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (“IFFCO”), recently 
announced it was entering into a joint venture in Canada to supply urea fertilizer to North 
America and India.165  North America is a net importer of urea fertilizer presently; but, it 
is conceivable that it could quickly become an exporter.  The following excerpt from a 
Reuters article on the IFFCO project is ominous for the Gabon project: 
 


“The U.S. imports more than two-thirds of its urea production, but still, if all the 
rumored projects became reality North America would quickly have a surplus, 
said David Asbridge, president of NPK Fertilizer Advisory Services.”166 
 


A document that the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) recently, and briefly, 
published on its website raises even more questions about the Gabon project.  Although 
the document, which is dated November 7, 2012, is no longer available on the IFC 
website, it is accessible by Google’s Web Cache.167  The document is a summary of a 
proposal for the IFC to provide a US$150 to US$200 million senior loan.  The summary 
states that Olam owns 78% of the project, RoG 12%, and Tata only 10%, which 
contradicts our understanding of the deal terms.  If this document is correct, then Olam’s 
overall exposure is barely reduced by Tata’s participation – only the RoG’s is.  The 
document also states that the estimated cost is US$1.5 to US$2.0 billion, which is higher 
than Olam has previously disclosed.  This document indicates that Olam could be on the 
hook for substantially more cash (and risk) than it previously disclosed.

Viewing	
  Olam	
  through	
  the	
  Enron	
  Lens	
  
Enron offers a useful perspective by which to evaluate Olam.  While both companies 
married trading businesses to “asset heavy” production and distribution businesses, the 
similarities are more than skin-deep.  Both companies appear to have tried to scale their 
trading businesses too far and too fast, which resulted in substantial cash burns.  Enron’s 
CapEx binge produced some awful results.  Our view is that Olam’s CapEx is “off-the-
rails” and destroys significant value.  Enron’s CEO, Jeff Skilling, departed just as the 
market was becoming aware of critical problems in its business.  The June 2012 
departure of Olam’s long-serving CFO for a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia job might have 
portended a similar fate for Olam.  Both Enron and Olam have made significant use of 
non-cash accounting gains that turn theoretical future profits into gains today, but 
incentivized the companies to make questionable investments that generate accounting 
profits.  Both companies have demonstrated considerable antipathy toward their critics, 
which is often a sign of insecurity – it certainly was in Enron’s case.  Enron prided itself 
in being an ethical company; but, it became clear in its aftermath that it was anything but.  
Olam trumpets its ethics as well, but there are possible cracks in that veneer.   
 
Both Olam and Enron appear to have scaled their trading businesses too far, and too fast.  
In Enron’s final full year of operations before collapsing, it grew its trading revenue by 
150%.168  Trading businesses are generally low margin, and are capital intensive due to 
inventories and accounts receivable.  When growing a trading business rapidly, a 
company will generally burn a lot of cash.  At the end of the day, it is cash – and not 
purely accounting profits – that businesses exist to generate. 
 
There is also a limit to how quickly you can grow any business – let alone for a 
commodity trader.  If you have a leading position in supplying cashews, you can grow in-
line with the market, or even take some market share from competitors.  But if the latter 
is the case, how are you doing it?  Are you discounting or offering better terms (both 
damaging to cash flow)?  Are you executing that much better than your competitors, even 
though the industry is mature?  The bottom line is that one should not expect to grow 
trading in a given commodity much more rapidly than demand for that commodity is 
growing.   
 
You can move into other commodities, but that generally only makes sense if there is not 
a lot of established competition in that commodity, or you have an inherent advantage 
that you can transplant to that commodity.  Olam states that it has inherent advantages 
that it can “repeat” across “adjacent” commodities.  Its “repeatable” model is buying 
from the farm gate, rather than the port.  This sounds good, but it is really just a transfer 
of risk from the intermediary traders to Olam.  This can work well if Olam manages the 
risk, but we suspect risk management is little more than a hollow phrase at Olam.  A 
company with internal accounting systems apparently this poor, and that is growing its 
trading volumes this rapidly, is highly unlikely to be able to manage these risks.  If other 
trading firms, such as ADM, Cargill, and Noble are not buying from the farm gate, it is 
not because they failed to think of it.

In our view, it takes a lot of discipline to be a public trading company.  The antithesis of 
this discipline is to set a PAT growth target of approximately 200% over four years.  But 
Olam top management owns a significant number of Olam shares, just as Enron 
management had significant stock options.  The interim result in both cases is high debt 
levels and substantial cash burns.   
 
Enron’s CapEx binge seems to have been spread over fewer projects than Olam’s.  
Despite the presumably greater concentration of management attention Enron’s 
international CapEx projects could command, some of them did famously poorly.  Olam 
is a different company obviously, but the myriad CapEx problems we identify in this 
report indicate that Olam is replicating Enron’s lack of success.  Enron had the advantage 
that it was initially an asset heavy company (it owned and operated pipelines).  Olam is 
new to this.  Rather than Olam making fewer and higher quality acquisitions, it seems to 
generally be purchasing troubled businesses.  It has demonstrated no acumen for turning 
operations around – in fact, SK Foods gives the opposite impression.  As the Crown 
Flour Mill acquisition shows, the reality of Olam’s asset acquisitions can vary greatly 
from the hype.  We have every reason to expect that Olam’s CapEx binge will end 
disastrously.   
 
It quickly became clear after Enron collapsed that CEO Jeffrey Skilling’s unexpected 
departure months earlier was a sign of the Company’s intractable problems.  It is possible 
that the same will be said about the apparently unexpected June 2012 resignation of 
Olam’s then-CFO, Krishnan Ravi Kumar.  Mr. Kumar left Olam to join Saudi Telecom in 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Kumar had headed Olam’s corporate finance and treasury 
function for almost 20 years.169  We understand that some analysts were surprised by Mr. 
Kumar’s departure, and some thought Mr. Kumar could have been next in line to run 
Olam.   
 
Olam announced Mr. Kumar’s resignation on June 20, 2012.  Between June 6, 2012 and 
June 26, 2012, Olam purchased 52.2 million of its shares at a total cost of S$95.5 
million.170  Olam bought 31.2 million of these shares (59.8%) subsequent to the 
announcement.   
 
This report extensively covers Olam’s use of non-cash accounting gains to book 
theoretical future profits in present periods, and the unhealthy incentives that creates.  We 
will not repeat that discussion.  What is worth noting is that Enron’s use of “mark to 
model” accounting, which accomplished much the same thing (i.e., estimating future 
economic benefits, and then booking present gains based on the estimates), was likely 
integral in its failure.  Enron employees joked that they were encouraged to spend $10 in 
cash to buy $5 of accounting profits.  Given our opinion that Olam management lacks the 
discipline necessary to prudently manage its trading business, and the numerous CapEx 
issues we have detailed in this report, it seems reasonable to conclude that Olam is caught 
in the same vicious cycle.

Both Enron and, in our view, Olam betrayed their substantial insecurity in their reactions 
to critics.  Jeff Skilling famously called a presumed short seller an “asshole” on a 
conference call after the investor questioned why Enron was always unable to produce a 
balance sheet with its earnings announcement.  When a former CLSA analyst published a 
report in February 2011 criticizing Olam’s accounting practices, the Company publicly 
responded forcefully, despite having a policy of not commenting on analyst coverage.171  
The analyst left CLSA soon thereafter.  (As we discuss in this report, we believe that the 
response did not sufficiently address the analyst’s concerns.)   
 
We now have a first hand perspective on how deep Olam’s antipathy toward critics goes.  
Olam has purportedly filed suit against Muddy Waters and Carson Block for the 15-
minute talk on Olam he gave on November 19, 2012 at the Ira Sohn conference in 
London.  According to articles, the suit includes a request for an injunction against 
further public discussion of Olam.  There are several examples of better known investors 
discussing in greater length and detail (and who released slides) discussing negative 
theses on companies they are short at Ira Sohn and similar conferences.  They have 
seldom – if ever – drawn lawsuits from these companies.  Yet it apparently took Olam all 
of three days to file a suit.  During the past week, Olam has had two conference calls, and 
has been very active in the media attempting to impugn our credibility – despite it 
evidently having little idea what Mr. Block said or thinks.  Olam is hardly the picture of 
confidence.  It is clear to us that it desperately wants to prevent us from releasing our 
research.  Oh well. 
 
Both companies prided themselves on being ethical companies.  One of the truisms we 
have found in business and life is that the louder one states he is ethical, the less likely 
that is to be true.  Truly upstanding people and companies generally let their actions 
speak for themselves.   
 
Enron’s hypocrisy is clear.  It had a 62-page code of ethics it gave to employees172 – at 
the same time it was manipulating energy markets to cause blackouts in California, 
burning billions of dollars of investor funds, and committing accounting fraud.   
 
Olam frequently states that it is improving the lives of farmers, employees, and others in 
the developing world – its website prominently features a ten-page “Livelihood Charter” 
that describes Olam’s efforts to improve the lives of rural communities in the developing 
world.173  Olam publishes an annual “Sustainability Report” – the 2012 version is 42 
pages long.174  Yet, there are newspaper and non-governmental organization reports 
alleging various abuses by Olam, including being a “Congo-trashing company” by 
engaging in illegal logging and land grabs; 175 176 failing to pay taxes;177 corrupting

Laotian officials in order to seize ancestral land from villagers in order to plant coffee 
plantations;178 and depriving cashew processing factory employees in Mozambique of 
toilets and minimum wages.179  These are only allegations, but if they are true, then Olam 
would appear to be a hypocrite as well. 
 
Particularly in response to the Ira Sohn talk, Olam is emphatically emphasizing its ethics 
and integrity.  Sunny Verghese recently stated “All that we know is that we run a clean 
and honest business and we are completely and utterly confident of that.  Our auditors are 
confident of that.  Our board's audit committee is confident of that. Our whole board and 
management team is confident of that.”.180  Confidence is not certainty.   


Valuation	
  
Our recovery model shows that recoverable assets for unsecured creditors of Olam would 
be 45.8 cents on the dollar.  Because of the lengthy bankruptcy process in Singapore, and 
an expected required IRR of 15% on a distressed bond purchase, we believe the fair price 
for Olam’s unsecured obligations is 14 to 33 cents on the dollar, depending on recovery 
times.  Based on our conversation with expert liquidators in Singapore, and recovery 
statistics from the World Bank, the time that creditors have to wait to actually get control 
of assets could be as long as seven years, which leads to our 14 cents on the dollar 
downside scenario.  A breakdown of all our assumptions is provided in the Appendix. 
  
We believe that we have been generous in our estimates.  Despite the plethora of 
accounting red flags we came across, we chose to give full credit for cash balances and 
other current assets for the purposes of this recovery analysis.   
 
Due to lack of disclosure, the composition of balance sheet items in our recovery model 
is based on the annual report. 
 
28.5% of Olam’s PP&E is actually capital work-in-progress.  As is evidenced in this 
paper, Olam has a track record of adopting risky, costly projects that appear to go 
nowhere.  We believe that recovering capital work-in-progress, like part-built pieces of 
an export zone, and wasted spending on many projects yet to materialize years later will 
have a recovery of approximately 10%.  
 
While some of the machinery may be valuable, the majority of it is in third-world 
countries, where it can be easily stripped and sold by unscrupulous employees, or lack of 
proper maintenance could ruin it. The four to five year wait for litigation likely means 
that most of this equipment will allow creditors to realize a small percentage of the 
present value—our estimate is 12.5%.  We do however give credit for freehold land 
holdings and even leasehold land and buildings, and are assuming 95% recovery.

Although we suspect Olam could be overpaying for land in frontier markets, we assumed 
a 95% recovery with the 5% deduction to account for selling costs.  All in, we believe 
that bondholders can expect to recover 42% of the PP&E recorded on Olam’s balance 
sheet.  
 
Based on our research, there are only two items of any real value in the intangibles: the 
OK Foods brand (which makes up S$110 million of the S$115 million in brands on the 
balance sheet) and water rights in Australia.  OK Foods has moderate market share in 
Nigeria, and it is possible that a large food company could find value in it.  We valued 
Olam’s water rights at the most recent transaction price we could find, and found that 
they have declined significantly from the time of acquisition, due to Olam buying during 
a drought at the peak of the market.  We believe that items such as goodwill and forestry 
concession rights have no value.   
 
We have detailed biological gains within this report, and it is clearly not appropriate for 
bondholders to expect to recover the full value of biological assets.  Annual crops are 
defined by Olam as seeds given to farmers: 
 


“Annual crops consist of seeds for various commodities (cotton, onions, tomatoes 
and other vegetables) that are given to farmers to sow and grow. Farmers take all 
the harvest risks and bear all the farming costs. On harvesting of the commodities, 
the Group has the first right to buy the produce from these farms.”181 


 
We do not believe these should be accounted for as assets: they are merely agreements 
with poor farmers.  As a result, we believe the recovery on these is zero.  Some items will 
allow bondholders to recover money: livestock in New Zealand and almond orchards.  
The New Zealand cattle market is fairly transparent, so we incorporated NZFSU’s 
estimate of the value in the recovery model.  We think there is a very high probability of 
Olam being stripped of its assets in Russia in the event of bankruptcy, and we assigned 
the Rusmolco assets a recovery value of zero.  We assigned almonds a recovery rate of 
50%: Olam has taken S$194 million of gains in the almond orchards.  50% gives the 
company some credit that the almonds might be of value.  However, if you don’t own the 
land and cannot get to them, then they might not exactly be accessible—as is the situation 
with Olam’s sale-leaseback of its almond orchards.  
 
Olam’s jointly controlled entities are primarily operating in the Ivory Coast.  Olam has 
loaned money to these JVs and we expect that creditors will seek to recover funds loaned.  
The total investment was S$255 million, and the loan was S$152.9 million.  We believe it 
will be difficult to collect on loans made to entities in the Ivory Coast.  At best, we think 
Olam can get 80 cents on the dollar due to its partial equity holding.   
 
Olam has three investments in associates: Open Country Dairy, Pure Circle and New 
Castle Agri Terminal.  Open Country Dairy is impaired as per items in the 2012 annual 
report.182  Pure Circle is a listed company, and we valued Olam’s share of Pure Circle at a 
                                                
181 2012 Annual Repport, p. 142 (Note 12). 
182 2012 Annual Report, p. 149.

20% liquidity discount due to potential weakness in a bankruptcy and underwriting 
spread from banks placing out the shares.  New Castle Agri Terminal is a partially built 
project and is not operational.  A buyer would likely have to spend substantial amounts of 
money, so we valued it at only 10% of carrying value.   
 
Receivables are pretty straightforward.  Muddy Waters has always warned of the 
difficulty of doing business in emerging markets, and collecting receivables could be 
very tough.  We do not know the Emerging Market vs. Developed Market mix in the 
Americas or Europe, as the company does not disclose this level of detail.  You can see 
our calculations in the table, but our value is effectively 60 cents on the dollar.  
 
We think inventories are another problem area for bondholders.  Years of court battles 
would make it very difficult to get to inventory which almost entirely sits at the 
subsidiary level.  Because all of Olam’s inventory is agricultural products, it is highly 
likely that there would be significant spoilage during the bankruptcy process.  Cotton can 
be preserved if properly stored, but these inventories are still spread out across emerging 
markets, just like Olam’s receivables.  Breaking out recovery rates for different products, 
we calculated that the total recoverable value would be approximately 38% of the 
carrying value.  We valued supplier advances at zero—we do not believe bondholders 
will be able to collect from individual suppliers.  
 
Understanding the recovery of inventories is crucial to the Olam recovery analysis, as it 
is such a huge proportion of the current assets.  At the outset, it might seem like recovery 
should be quite high as Olam classifies roughly 75% of its inventory as “Readily 
Marketable Inventory” (“RMI”).  RMI is defined in the annual report as inventories 
which are “liquid, hedged, and sold forward”.  Olam regularly refers to its RMI when 
discussing “net gearing” so as to appear less geared it actually is.   
 
We believe the inventory could be less liquid than the company portrays to investors 
because Olam buys most of its inventory at the farm gate, and it is held by local Olam 
subsidiaries.  Roughly 87% of inventory is held at the subsidiary level.   We find it hard 
to believe that a physical product sitting in an emerging market warehouse would be 
readily liquid at the carrying value which is cost or “fair value” depending on 
management decides to carry it.  Anecdotal evidence from traders that previously worked 
for Olam in Africa suggests wide bid-offer spreads, and there is no reason to think that 
Olam would be able to liquidate without taking a significant haircut on the value of its 
inventories. Additionally, in a liquidation scenario, it would be difficult for a creditor to 
get to the asset quickly enough to sell it and move the cash up to the parent in a timely 
manner.  Experienced professionals in emerging market recovery scenarios warn that 
local management faced with an unwinding company will typically liquidate inventory 
quickly and keep the cash for themselves.  It is a mistake to think that holding bonds in 
Singapore means that one would be able to quickly sell cotton sitting in a Mozambique 
storage facility at a price equal to last mark, and soon enough to avoid experiencing 
commodity price risk.
Page 96 of 133 


We discussed hedging in greater detail earlier in the report, but it is important to 
remember that hedges are performed by the parent company, not the subsidiary holding 
the inventory. Therefore, our Mozambique cotton subsidiary might have a very hard time 
netting versus a hedge made at the Singapore entity level.   
 
In a liquidation scenario, it would be hard for the creditor to take control a subsidiary 
located in an undeveloped country with few safeguards for foreign investors, shift the 
inventory to the parent, and then deliver it into a hedged futures contract.  The second 
choice is that the hedges are also not perfect commodity hedges.  Experienced 
professionals know that different commodities trade at different prices all over the world, 
and that the correlations are not always strong enough to truly offset risk or even to really 
net out the balances.   
 
Being long coffee through a Vietnamese subsidiary and short Chicago coffee futures at 
the parent still has a lot of basis risk, but we believe that this is the type of position that 
Olam Management includes in the RMI and presents to investors as easily recoverable. 
We understand that Olam only hedges using front month contracts, and rolls them as 
delivery date approaches, at which point it covers the short and sells to the customer.  In a 
liquidation scenario, there is no longer any cash for rolling contracts.   
 
Our analysis of US customs and shipping data show that sales contracts for certain 
commodities might be inked at a subsidiary that is totally different from the subsidiary 
holding the inventory.  Indian cashews make their way to Olam USA, Olam Vietnam will 
move goods to Olam India. The sales process is labyrinthine at best.  In a liquidation 
scenario, it would be excruciating to match up these contracts and manage to deliver 
inventory effectively enough to ensure a high recovery rate for bondholders.  In the credit 
crisis, matching up CDS contracts between counterparties was almost impossible and the 
collapse of Lehman created total chaos despite having far fewer subsidiaries and far 
fewer customers.  Simply, if the Singaporean entity is in liquidation, who is going to co-
ordinate the shipments between entities and movement of goods?  
 
For all of the reasons stated above, we do not believe that RMI is the cash equivalent that 
management presents to investors.  Our recovery assumption for inventory incorporates 
the risks stated above.  
 
Net derivative assets were S$186 million, however, these include S$322 million in net 
Level 3 derivatives.  Level 3 derivative values are derived from management’s models.    
Combined with the fact that the majority of the derivatives are meant for hedging, there is 
a large risk to bondholders should Olam declare bankruptcy and cease normal operations.  
We also built in assumptions for Olam’s other current assets. 
 
The total asset amount recoverable comes to S$5.3 billion. This is what the recoverable 
assets would be worth if recovered right away.   
 
As evidenced by CFM, there are secured loans also guaranteed by the parent. We are 
unsure as to how much, but there will be secured creditors standing ahead of unsecured
Page 97 of 133 


bondholders.  Based on figures provided in the 2012 AR, priority and secured creditors 
stand at S$577 million, but this number could be larger when incorporating priority and 
secured creditors at the subsidiary level.   
 
The balance of the bond valuation comes from simple time value of money calculations.  
Even though bondholders might get through the courts in Singapore in several years’ 
time, they would then be forced to continue legal battles in the various third world 
countries where Olam has operations.  In two of the biggest areas of investment, Nigeria 
and Gabon, the World Bank offers the following statistics: the time to recover funds in 
Nigeria is an average of two years, with recoveries of 28 cents on the dollar; and, the time 
to recover funds in Gabon averages five years for 15 cents on the dollar.
