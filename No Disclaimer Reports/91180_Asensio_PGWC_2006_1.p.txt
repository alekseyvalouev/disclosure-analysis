PGWC and Jasper Knabb: A


Match Made In Penny-Stock


Heaven.


According to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)


�lings, Jasper C. Knabb, the President of Pegasus Wireless


Corporation (NASDAQ: PGWC, $5.17), has claimed he spent


more than $26,000,000 buying shares in PGWC over the past


two years. That may not sound like a lot of money, but wait


until you learn a little more about Mr. Knabb’s previous


business dealings and Pegasus’ questionable �nancial


picture. They raise questions as to how Mr. Knabb’s PGWC


investment was �nanced and the use of those funds.


First, let’s look at some recent events in the young �nancier’s


career that boomerangs back to Pegasus.


On January 14, 2002 a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for


Mr. Knabb was �led against Mr. Knabb after he allegedly


failed to pay attorneys fees in a lawsuit �led by Babak


Dowlatshahi, who had sold his company to BeachAccess.Net,


where Mr. Knabb served as Chief Executive O�cer.


In the lawsuit, Mr. Dowlatshahi claimed that the terms of the


acquisition agreement were violated and that he had been


harmed after Mr. Knabb stopped paying vendors, despite


making assurances that he would. The lawsuit was


subsequently dismissed. However, this controversy occurred

2 years after Mr. Knabb was apparently accused of selling


BeachAccess without owning it, in some sort of penny-stock


scheme.


On April 1, 2000 Mr. Knabb was sued by BIFS Technologies


Corp. (“BIFS”), a penny-stock company that had acquired


BeachAcess.Net.


BIFS alleged that Mr. Knabb “had misrepresented his


ownership of BeachAccess thus causing BIFS to attempt to


purchase BeachAccess from Knabb and to enter into an


employment agreement with him. Knabb did not own


BeachAccess nor did he have rights during the sale of


BeachAccess to the ownership rights.”


The Court found that BIFS had the right to terminate the


employment agreement, but not rescind the deal


completely. Mr. Knabb was allowed to keep the rights to


stock options he had already received. At the time of the


ruling Mr. Knabb’s rights to 12,000,000 shares of BIFS were


worth less than $36,000.


BIFS was de-listed from the NASDAQ Pink Sheets on July 28,


2005 as the result of an SEC Administrative Action that arose


out of the company’s inability to �le timely �nancial


statements.


As if this story needed a cherry on top, on June 16, 2000 BIFS


announced a “strategic alliance” with a company called OTC


Telecom. Mr. Knabb was then OTC’s Managing Director; the


company later changed its named to OTC Wireless and was


acquired by Pegasus on November 5, 2004.


It was reported by Investorideas.com that Mr. Knabb sold his


�rst company, Software Exchange Inc., d/b/a SEI, for


$80,000,000. However, we found no record of any $80


million sale of SEI stock by Mr. Knabb or any record that Mr.


Knabb owned $80 million of SEI stock. We did �nd that SEI

�led for bankruptcy in the Middle District of North Carolina,


on May 24, 1990.


If indeed Mr. Knabb earned $80 million for SEI, we have to


wonder why he lost his boat and went to work for a penny-


stock company for a salary in 2003, shortly before his PGWC


buying spree.


On March 17, 2003 a complaint was �led in the United States


District Court, seeking a judgment against Mr. Knabb in the


amount of $934,081, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs


associated with the collection of the outstanding debt he


and his wife owed on a boat. The matter was settled and the


case was dismissed, after Mr. Knabb lost possession of the


boat. The litigation contained promises of payments in some


penny stock.


SEC �lings of Wireless Frontier, Inc. (WFRI.PK, $0.007),


disclose the Mr. Knabb earned $196,808 as Director and


President of WFRI from September 16, 2003 to September


16, of 2004.


Mr. Knabb will be ringing the ceremonial NASDAQ opening


bell in Times Square on Friday, July 21, 2006, at 9:30 AM


Eastern Standard Time.


We look forward to the NASDAQ’s explanation of the


message it is sending investors by having Pegasus’ Mr.


Knabb ring its bell tomorrow.
