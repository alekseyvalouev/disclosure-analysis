Summary


Imetelstat has a history of poor clinical performance and safety issues.


It appears that the FDA may be investigating continued safety issues with imetelstat
in its current clinical trials that may result in another clinical hold.


We are short GERN and see 80% downside.


Investors seem to have gotten excited again about the prospects for Geron's (GERN)
imetelstat, pushing the shares +50% year to date at its peak to nearly nine-month highs.
We think new investors to Geron may be shocked to learn about what we see as
imetelstat's history of failed clinical trials, patient deaths, and safety issues. We highlight
them in this article and caution investors not to get excited about the Janssen partnership.


History of failure, adverse events, patient deaths, and clinical hold
for imetelstat


From its beginnings, imetelstat has had a history of trial failures and safety issues. In
2010-2012, investors had high hopes for imetelstat, which was being investigated in
Phase 2 trials in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and advanced non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately in September 2012, Geron announced that imetelstat
failed its Phase 2 trial in breast cancer during an interim analysis, and that the company
had decided to not pursue further development of imetelstat in NSCLC because it was not
going to hit its pre-specified success criteria. This was a big disappointment and drove
Geron shares down 56% from $2.74 to $1.21.

In the press release, Geron stated clearly that the imetelstat group was performing worse
than the control arm (paclitaxel alone) and had a lower PFS, and that the imetelstat group
actually had a "greater number of deaths" and discontinuations than the paclitaxel-only
arm in the Phase 2 breast cancer study.


As for the Phase 2 NSCLC trial, after announcing that imetelstat was unlikely to hit its pre-
specified success criteria, Geron later published the final results of the trial in December
2014. In the publication, investigators revealed that imetelstat failed to show statistical
significance in either PFS or OS in NSCLC. The investigators also noted that the
imetelstat arms had significantly greater grade 3/4 adverse events, particularly
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. It became very clear that imetelstat was a dangerous
drug and came with significant safety issues.


Later, imetelstat did show positive results in a small, 18-patient, open-label Phase 2 trial in
essential thrombocythemia (ET), but that promise was quickly stamped out by Geron
which decided not to pursue further development in ET because medical experts advised
the company that imetelstat didn't show greater efficacy than existing treatments and that
ET patients were "adequately served by existing therapies."


The main "successful" results for imetelstat came from early results from an investigator
sponsored (led by Dr. Ayalew Tefferi), open-label Phase 2 trial (Pilot Study) at the Mayo
Clinic in myelofibrosis (MF). The Pilot Study was designed to enroll 81 patients, but in
December 2013, Geron released preliminary results from just 22 patients in the first 2
cohorts and touted the 4 complete responses (CRS) and 1 partial response (PR). While
promising on its face, the results attracted skepticism, such as this Adam Feuerstein
article that questioned the results.

These concerns on imetelstat turned out to be well-founded as there were 2 deaths in the
trial (in just 22 patients), which further increased the safety concerns related to imetelstat.
Soon thereafter, the Mayo Clinic announced it was discontinuing enrollment in the
imetelstat trial (see "Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trial in Myelofibrosis" in the January
2014 prospectus). While Geron stated the decision to cease new enrollment had nothing
to do with any efficacy or safety concerns, it certainly raised eyebrows within the
community. In March 2014, Geron announced that imetelstat was being placed on a full
clinical hold by the FDA for all company-sponsored clinical trials. Eighteen days later,
Geron announced that the Pilot Study at the Mayo Clinic was also placed under partial
clinical hold due to concerns over hepatotoxicity.

Oddly, while the early results from the Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial led by Dr.
Tefferi served as the main positive "results" for imetelstat, Geron has refused to provide
updates from the trial. During the second quarter 2016 earnings call, Geron was asked
about updates from the trial, particularly the complete responses. Geron responded: "That
study is sort of towards the end of its life, and we have decided not to make any further
publications." We find this odd, particularly since it's an open-label trial and data should be
readily available. We suspect that it means that trial results may have turned for the
worse, but we cannot determine if this is true without an update from the company.


Imetelstat's safety issues persist today


Notwithstanding imetelstat's history, in November 2014 after the clinical hold was lifted,
Geron partnered with Janssen on imetelstat. Janssen began conducting two Phase 2
studies, the IMbark trial in intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), and the IMerge
trial in low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). As a result of the
partnership, Geron received an upfront fee and is eligible for future milestone payments
related to the IMbark and IMerge trials and royalties on future Imetelstat sales. While
investors may have hoped that this new partnership with Janssen changed Imetelstat's
prospects, Imetelstat continues to be plagued by safety issues, particularly patient deaths.


In the 1Q 2017 10-Q, Geron released that both IMbark and IMerge trials have seen
patients deaths and that Imetelstat was potentially at risk of another clinical hold. The 10-
Q states in the Risk Factors section (emphasis added):


"In addition, adverse events previously observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study,
such as LFT abnormalities, profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia, bleeding events, and other safety issues, including deaths, have also
been observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge. If patients in current or
potential future clinical trials of Imetelstat experience similar or more severe adverse
events, including LFT abnormalities, or severe hepatic, hemorrhagic, or new or
unusual adverse events, the INDs for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical
hold, as it was in March 2014, and Janssen may be delayed or precluded from
further developing imetelstat."

These adverse events appear to have continued and/or intensified. In the 2Q 2017 10-Q,
Geron added that imetelstat has been seeing grade 3/4 adverse events in the IMbark and
IMerge trials, and stated (emphasis added):


"In addition, adverse events previously observed in imetelstat trials, such as LFT
abnormalities; profound and/or prolonged, including grade 3/4, thrombocytopenia
and neutropenia; bleeding events, with or without any associated
thrombocytopenia; and other safety issues, including deaths, have also been
observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge. If patients in current or potential
future clinical trials of imetelstat experience similar or more severe adverse events,
including LFT abnormalities, or severe hepatic, hemorrhagic, or new or unusual
adverse events, the INDs for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical hold, as
it was in March 2014, and Janssen may be delayed or precluded from further
developing imetelstat."


The Janssen trials have been hit by multiple delays and difficulties


Although current investors seem to be excited about the two Janssen-led trials, we're less
enthusiastic. In fact, the Janssen trials have been plagued by multiple delays and
difficulties in addition to the safety issues that we highlighted above. In a September 2016
update on the progress of the two clinical trials, Geron announced that Janssen had
informed Geron that Janssen was closing one of the treatment arms in the IMbark trial and
discontinuing enrollment in another, and that Janssen had stopped enrolling additional
patients in the IMerge trial. This news sent Geron shares down 20%.


Later in July of 2017, as the adverse events and deaths were reported in Geron's 10-Q
filings, Geron reported another negative development in both of the Phase 2 trials being
conducted by Janssen. This time Geron announced that Janssen wanted to enroll
additional patients in the IMerge trial in order to see signs of efficacy and that investors
would have to wait until 3Q 2018 at the earliest to get data from the IMbark trial, which had
not progressed and remained closed to new enrollment. The need to enroll additional
patients suggested to us that imetelstat wasn't showing strong efficacy results in initial
IMerge patients. We believe the announcement, which would reasonably be interpreted as
resulting in delays, was received negatively by investors as evidenced by Geron's shares
trading down 15% that day.

Finally, Geron released additional concerns about imetelstat's safety profile in its latest 3Q
2017 10-Q. In the Risk Factors section, Geron announced that it had received an
"information request" by the FDA for (emphasis added) "additional efficacy and safety
data, including deaths, justifying continued treatment of patients enrolled in
IMbark." It appears to us that the FDA may be troubled about imetelstat's toxicity and
concerned about Janssen's decision to enroll additional patients in the IMerge trial. We
believe this may be a material risk to imetelstat that investors may be overlooking.


Moreover, in the same 3Q 2017 10-Q, Geron added (emphasis added):


"If the FDA deems such data and information to be inadequate or determines that
such data does not justify continued treatment of patients enrolled in current clinical
trials of imetelstat, then any current clinical trials, including IMbark, IMerge and
the Pilot Study, could be further delayed, halted or prohibited, for example by
being placed on clinical hold."


This serves to corroborate our concerns on imetelstat's safety profile and adds to
imetelstat's difficult clinical and safety history.

We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47


We are short Geron because we don't believe imetelstat is effective and we believe that its
safety issues suggest that it is a dangerous drug. In previous trials, imetelstat has shown
no efficacy in lung cancer and actually had worse results than the control arm in breast
cancer. We also discount the preliminary results from the Phase 2 Pilot Study led by Dr.
Tefferi because it was small, open-label, and investigator-sponsored. In addition, we want
to point out that the Pilot Study's enrollment was discontinued early, which suggests to us
that the trial wasn't promising in later results and/or that the Mayo Clinic may have found
the safety profile of imetelstat unacceptable. Furthermore, Geron refuses to provide
updates from the Pilot Study despite investor inquiries.


We also believe the safety issues with imetelstat are real concerns, which led to FDA to
ask for an informational request to justify continued treatment of patients in the Janssen
trials, and we believe investors are not paying enough attention to this risk for Geron.


We value imetelstat at zero, and our target price for GERN is the cash on its balance
sheet adjusted for cash burn.


Disclosure: I am/we are short GERN.
