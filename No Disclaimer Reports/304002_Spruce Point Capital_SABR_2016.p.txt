Executive Summary

Spruce Point Is Short Sabre Corp. (“SABR”)
For the Following Reasons:


1 Sabre is Trying Hard to Mask Underlying Business Model Pressure and an LBO / re-IPO that Created Questionable Value: 


Sabre Corp. (Nasdaq: SABR) is a travel tech company with a core business of operating a Global Distribution System (“GDS”), 
a platform that facilitates travel by bringing together content such as inventory, prices, and availability from a broad array of 
travel suppliers for a range of travel buyers such as online/physical travel agents and corporate travel departments. As a 
middleman between buyers and suppliers, Sabre’s biggest risk is disintermediation, whereby its consumers bypass its 
network, through emerging threats from Google, or even worse, suppliers imposing fees to customers for using it (e.g. 
Lufthansa). To keep customers happy and loyal, Sabre must offer upfront cash incentives because its contracts are typically 
short-term, and upwards of 20% of contracts renew annually. Our research suggests that Sabre has been offering increasing 
incentive discounts (obscured by its Adjusted EBITDA), which has forced deflationary pricing as evident in declining revenue 
per transaction. Sabre came public in 2014 after a highly promoted going private LBO in 2007 during the pre-financial crisis 
buyout mania. Our research suggests that despite significant M&A and restructuring at Sabre while under private 
ownership, there has been no value creation in its underlying business, which has sorely disappointed expectations. By 
ignoring the headline “Adjusted” EBITDA and EPS results and focusing on underlying cash flow economics, it’s evident that 
Sabre is at best a stagnant business. With Sabre’s share price +80% since its IPO, it is no surprise its private equity sponsors 
have rapidly exited the stock through 4 secondary issuances, and reduced ownership from 80% at the IPO to 25% today!


2 Management Quietly Starts Liquidating Ahead of the Questionable Related-Party Acquisition of Abacus Int’l:


As a result of underlying business pressures, we believe insiders were likely aware that revenue and earnings estimates 
would not be met in 2015. Management quietly announced on the Q1 2015 conference call in May that it would start 
liquidating shares under a 10b5-1 program. Realizing that Wall Street punishes earnings misses for “growth” stories 
fiercely, and needing a cover-up to “beat” estimates, in our opinion, Sabre announced the acquisition of Abacus, its Asian 
GDS affiliate. Sabre already owned 35%, and spun the transaction as a way to access faster growing markets, but there’s 
evidence to suggest the transaction may have allowed the company to spring-load revenue and provide a band aid to an 
injured business. Not surprisingly, by adjusting Sabre’s results for the consolidation of Abacus, Sabre’s Travel Network 
segment barely grew in 2015, yet management is still touting mid to high single digit organic growth!
6


Spruce Point Sees $12 - $17 Per Share; 
40% - 60% Downside 


Evidence That Suggests Accounting Shenanigans To Inflate Operating Cash Flow and EBITDA: 


To support our concerns about the Abacus deal, we sourced its Singapore financial filings and were disappointed to find 
discrepancies between the Abacus figures reported by Sabre to investors in its SEC filings. Even worse, we found 
irregularities related to Sabre’s JV accounting that suggest it artificially inflated its operating cash flow by representing 
excess dividends (returns of capital) as operating cash flows, when accounting rules dictate that dividends in excess of 
earnings should be treated as investment cash flows. By pro forma adjusting the results, we find that Sabre’s operating 
cash flows declined in 2015, while management represented that it increased! Aggressive accounting strategies appear to 
be the norm with Sabre. Our forensic analysis suggests Sabre has become more aggressive in capitalizing upfront customer 
incentives, which artificially increases both Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA. Investors are better served adjusting 
Sabre’s financials to remove the effects of capitalization. As a result, we find Sabre’s EBITDA margin actually declined in 
2015, but of course, management would like you to believe they expanded...oh the miracles of financial alchemy! Not 
surprisingly, management’s cash bonuses, along with its sponsors’ management fees, are solely linked to reported 
Adjusted EBITDA. This linkage provides clear incentives to game the Adjusted EBITDA figures.


3


Valuation Disconnect Suggesting 40% – 60% Downside:


Smelling a fee bonanza from repeated equity + debt issuances, a grand total of 13 analysts all have “Buy” recommendations
and see upside to an average price target of $33.45 (+15%). In our opinion, it’s easy to refute the bull case from analysts’ 
flawed investment assumptions. At approx. 3.4x and 10.5x 2016E Street sales and Adj. EBITDA estimates, respectively, Sabre 
seems fairly valued to peers (on inflated street numbers) Amadeus and Travelport. During the heavily touted LBO, venerated 
investment bankers at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley issued a fairness opinion suggesting a terminal EBITDA multiple 
range of 6.5x – 8.0x. Given our belief that post-LBO, no underlying financial improvement has been created, and at worst 
accounting gimmicks are masking deterioration, we find it baffling how analysts justify the current valuation. Furthermore, 
analysts’ fail to adjust their models for Sabre’s $387m tax receivable liability that starts coming due in 2017 and has real 
cash implications. We also adjust Sabre’s financials for the aggressive capitalization of recurring and normal upfront cash 
incentives. As a result, we derive a long-term price target of $12.00 - $17.00 per share, or 40-60% downside

Primary Evidence to Suggest 
Abacus Int’l Accounting Issues


From Sabre Filings: Sabre Revenue From Abacus > Abacus PurchasesPrimary revenue 
generated from Abacus is 
data processing fees 
associated with bookings 
on the Sabre GDS


Revenue from Abacus is 
notably higher than 
related company purchase 
of services reported by 
Abacus! 


A receivable from Abacus 
on Sabre’s books, should 
correspond to a payable 
on Abacus’ books. 


Notably, the $29.3m that 
Sabre reported in 2013, is 
higher than the entire 
trade payable of $20.1m 
reported by Abacus!


(*)  Abacus explicitly says that, “Accrued expenses relate mainly to accrued incentives payable 
to travel agents.” Thus, we can rule out that amounts payable to Sabre are included here.


(*)


(*)  Abacus explicitly says that, “parties are considered related to the Group if the Group has the ability, 
directly or indirectly, to control the party, or exercise significant influence over the party in making financial 
and operating decisions, or vice versa. Related parties may be individuals or other entities.”

Operating Cash Flow Appears Overstated, 
Actually Declined in 2015


$ in millions


Because Sabre received more dividends from its JVs than income in 2015, accounting rules dictate that 
excess cash must be accounted for as a “Return of Capital” and not a “Return on Capital.” (1)


As a result, we are justified in reclassifying $13.9m of cash from operations, to cash flow from investing. 
On a pro-forma basis, Sabre’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow appears to have declined in 2015 by 2.6%!

Sabre acquired Abacus to 
mask underlying growth, 


that JV dividends 
exceeded actual income?

While capitalization of upfront cash incentives is not outright disallowed under GAAP, Spruce Point believes it is 
an aggressive accounting choice to capitalize normal and recurring operating expenses. This accounting choice 


increases current period earnings by stretching out expenses over future periods. By our calculation, upfront 
capitalize incentives surged from $53.7m to $63.5m in 2015, an 18% increase. We believe investors would be 


better served by evaluating its business by deducting upfront cash incentives.

Fundamental Short Thesis and 
Evidence Suggesting Limited/No 
Value Creation Post-LBO
15


Summary of Fundamental Concerns


Sabre’s core Travel Network (GDS) business is under pressure while its transition to higher margin 
services is slow to materialize, and coming with substantial capex costs. Furthermore, we believe little/no 


financial value has been created at Sabre Pre/Post its LBO in 2007


Deflation:  Loss of pricing power is evident in Sabre’s declining Revenue per Booking. Our forensic 
accounting analysis also suggests that Sabre is having to substantially increase upfront customer 
incentives, yet minimizes the current impact to its financials through aggressive capitalization
Disintermediation:  Airlines look to cut costs from middlemen like Sabre. Lufthansa recently 
imposed a fee to customers for going through a GDS. Google’s purchase of ITA Software in 2011 is 
a major competitive threat that could intensify this trend. Google’s settlement with the Dept. of 
Justice expires in Oct 2016, which could allow it to accelerate its direct to consumer model 


Growth Masked By Questionable JV Consolidation: Underlying growth in the Travel Network 
segment could be closer to zero, yet management is still touting its 6% organic revenue goals, 
excluding the Abacus consolidation. Our forensic analysis suggests substantial issues, and earnings 
estimates that would not have been met in 2015 absent the Abacus deal


Short-Term Contracts with Significant Renewal Risk: Contracts are typically structured for 1 – 3 
years and a meaningful portion of travel buyer agreements typically representing 15% -20% of 
bookings are up for renewal in a given year!


Debt: Sabre is saddled with $3.2bn of debt and another $387m of tax payments (“TRA”) which start 
coming due in 2017. Sabre’s credit profile is “aggressive” and is rated Ba3 / B+ by Moodys’ / S&P, 
respectively. Pro forma for the TRA, we estimate its leverage at 3.8x, leaving little margin for error
16


Critical Analysis of Sabre’s LBO


On Dec 12, 2006 Silver Lake and Texas Pacific Group announced the acquisition of Sabre Corp for approximately $4.5 billion 
and the assumption of $550m of debt for a total transaction value of approximately $5 billion. The cash offer of $32.75 per 


share represented a 30% premium over the 60 day average closing share price.


Valuation and Leverage Predicated on High Expectations:


Greg Mondre, a Managing Director of Silver Lake Partners, said: “Sabre has a remarkable track record of pioneering and delivering best-in-
class technology solutions for the global travel industry. We look forward to working with Sabre's talented management team as they 
continue to deploy technology as a source of competitive advantage and value-add for customer”


Key Sabre Management All Left:
• Sabre CEO Sam Gilliland mysteriously ousted ahead of the IPO in 2014
• Sabre Treasurer/Chief Accounting Officer/CFO Jeff Jackson leaves for Thayer Ventures
• Sabre Controller, later promoted to CFO, Mark Miller, replaced by Rick Simonson in 2013


According to TPG Partner Karl Peterson "We are excited by the opportunity to invest in Sabre given its leadership position in travel 
technology and distribution and the strength of Travelocity and its other leading online brands. Sabre is well positioned to continue 
innovating and we look forward to helping management profitably build upon this strong franchise.“


Based on our analysis and opinion:
• Jan 2015: Sabre dumps Travelocity / Lastminute.com as its popularity dwindles, financial performance deteriorates
• Sabre has not been built profitability post acquisition. By analyzing a couple of key financial metrics, and not the headline


Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA/EPS, it appears that limited/no value has been created at Sabre


The Sabre acquisition, which closed in early 2007, was a relic of the pre-financial crisis leverage mania that started to unravel in 2008


• The deal followed the sale of Travelport from Cendant to Blackstone for $4.3 billion in cash which closed in August 2006
 The deal valued Travelport at approximately 7.6x LTM EBITDA and was levered 6.3x Total Debt / LTM EBITDA


• TPG and Silver Lake’s acquisition of Sabre pushed the bar even higher! According to the fairness opinion, the deal was the richest and 
most highly levered of all precedent transactions


 Sabre was acquired at approximately 10.2x trailing EBITDA with 7.8x Debt / EBITDA

Analyst Hype and Failed Expectations From 
the LBO


Sell-side analyst comments on Sabre have proven to be overly optimistic...shocker!


Morgan Stanley Analyst: In a research note published before the agreement was announced, the 
analyst suggested that Sabre’s would-be buyers might be able to afford an even higher price. “Under 
private equity ownership aggressive cost-cutting could yield higher margins and lower [capital 
expenditures], and in that case a $34 [per share] value could be possible.”  Source


Bear Stearns Analyst: "While this transaction was widely anticipated, we think Sabre remains 
attractive to financial and/or strategic buyers given the highly visible cash flows from the global 
travel distribution business and the potential growth that the online travel agency (Travelocity) can 
offer.“ Source


Rochdale Securities Analyst:  “They (Sabre) have strong cash flow and good business fundamentals”  
Source


Reality check: A higher offer never emerged. Under private equity ownership, cost cuts 
have not stemmed the surge in capex, making cash flow unchanged 


Reality check: Only 1 strategic buyer expressed interest in Sabre. Travelocity was a bust and 
was sold, and Sabre appears to be using accounting tricks to mask declining free cash flow


Reality check: What may have been true in the past, may not be true in the present!

Limited Strategic Interest In Sabre

“In early October of 2006, Company Z contacted us and proposed discussions about a possible business combination 
between Company Z and the Company. Company Z indicated that it would be capable of conducting diligence in a very 
prompt manner because of its prior discussions with the Company and its understanding of our businesses. Our board 
instructed management and our advisors to explore a potential combination with Company Z. On October 10, 2006, 
Company Z sent us a draft merger agreement that contemplated an all cash acquisition of the Company. On October 11, 
2006, our management and our financial co-advisors discussed with Company Z a possible combination of Company Z 
and Sabre Holdings, including the key benefits and potential issues regarding such a combination.


The board considered Company Z’s proposal and draft merger agreement and discussed with our management and 
advisors a potential combination with Company Z at our board meeting on October 13, 2006. The discussion included a 
consideration of the relative risks and merits of a combination with Company Z as compared to a possible take-private 
transaction that would not present any potentially significant regulatory or other non-consummation risk or delay. After 
a period during which our senior management and advisors discussed with Company Z the potential issues that 
would be presented in a combination transaction, our board instructed our management to cease discussions with 
Company Z and inform Company Z that the board was focused on avoiding substantial non-consummation risk for 
the Company. Our management informed Company Z of this decision.


“During the exploratory sale process, we were also contacted on several occasions by certain other companies, with 
which we had very preliminary discussions regarding potential strategic transactions. None of these discussions 
progressed to a significant extent, and no other company made a specific proposal to acquire Sabre Holdings”


The short case is supported in knowing there was limited strategic interest in acquiring Sabre during the prior 
strategic alternative process. Given our belief that Sabre’s growth remains at risk of further deterioration, and that 
accounting gimmickry appears to be used to embellish its result, we think strategic buyer interest will continue to 


remain unlikely.

Evidence of Disintermediation: 
Lufthansa Imposes Fees on GDS Use


In June 2015, Lufthansa, took the decisive step to penalize customers with higher fees for booking tickets indirectly 
through GDS providers such as Sabre. Lufthansa was noted as a major customer of Sabre. 


What is stopping other airlines from following Lufthansa’s lead – such as Air France-KLM – also reportedly
evaluating a similar surcharge pricing strategy?


According to Sabre’s S-1 IPO Filing (1): “Our largest Travel Network suppliers include American Airlines, Delta, US 
Airways, United, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways and Emirates”


(1) Sabre: S-1, p. 144
(2) Lufthansa press release


Lufthansa Redirects Commercial Strategy (2):


“The new commercial strategy also includes a clear cost differentiation in the various booking channels. Presently, the costs 
for using global distribution systems (GDS) are several times higher than for other booking methods, such as our own 
online portal www.LH.com. In total, the yearly GDS costs come to a three-digit million euro amount for the Lufthansa Group. 
These services, however, are primarily used by other partners in the value chain. A large number of services are paid by the 
Lufthansa Group carriers, but are only partly used by them. Among others, the GDS services comprise functionalities, which 
offer many extra services in addition to the basic features of booking, processing and ticketing. Such examples include the 
option of combining and booking world-wide, multi-airline flight offers, as well as, an integrated booking and invoice 
processing.


As of 1 September 2015, the Lufthansa Group airlines will, therefore, include a surcharge, the “Distribution Cost Charge” 
(DCC) of EUR 16 for every ticket issued by a booking channel using GDS. The new charge will not be added to flight tickets 
purchased using own booking channels. This predominately includes the airlines’ websites 
(www.LH.com, www.swiss.com,www.austrian.com, www.brusselsairlines.com), as well as, the service center and ticket 
counter at the airports. Travel agencies will also be able to book tickets without the DCC, using the online portal 
at www.LHGroup-agent.com. Furthermore, corporate customers will be able to book their individually negotiated contract 
rates excluding the DCC at www.LH.com. Customers of Lufthansa Group Airlines can of course count on continued fare 
transparency. The display of the ticket will always show the final fare.”

Major Downside Catalyst Forthcoming: 
Google Threat Rises in October 2016


In July 2010, Google announced its acquisition of ITA Software for $700m. Google said the acquisition of ITA, which 
organizes data such as flight times, ticket availability and prices, will enable it to create online search tools to help people find 
such information more easily on the Web. The deal spooked industry participants, who formed a group and released a video 


in an attempt to warn about the dangers of Google entering the business (1). In April 2011, the Dept. of Justice cleared the 
transaction, but imposed conditions limiting how Google could use the technology.


(1) Video:  Google Buys ITA – A Travel Story
(2) Washington Post
(3) Sabre 2015 10K, page 42


After the Justice Department’s consent decree expires in October 2016, Google will be able to do what it pleases with ITA, and 
that makes people like internet travel experts Ed Hasbrouck nervous (2) 


“The real danger is of Google dominance of personalized pricing,” he says. “Imagine Google being able to incorporate everything it 
knows about you from your use of all Google services into decisions about what price to put on each airline ticket. Airlines or 
services with less info on which to base such price personalization would have a hard time competing with Google.”


Direct to Consumer Threat by Google


“Travel suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their costs and to 
increase their control over distribution. Airline consolidations, pricing 
pressure during contract renegotiations and the use of direct distribution 
may continue to subject our business to challenges. The shift from 
indirect distribution channels, such as our GDS, to direct distribution 
channels, may result from increased content availability on supplier 
operated websites or from increased participation of meta search 
engines, such as Kayak and Google, which direct consumers to supplier 
operated websites. This trend may adversely affect our Travel Network 
contract renegotiations with suppliers that use alternative distribution 
channels. For example, airlines may withhold part of their content for 
distribution exclusively through their own direct distribution channels or 
offer more attractive terms for content available through those direct 
channels.”

Both Sabre and its analysts would love investors to focus on its growing Adjusted EPS and EBITDA. However, the sad 
reality is that despite years of financial engineering, restructuring, and transitioning to more SAAS solutions, Sabre’s 


free cash flow and margins remain largely unchanged from Pre-LBO levels.
This has very important implications for Sabre’s valuation, which we discuss later in the valuation section.

Strong Evidence of Deflation: 
Signs of a Cracking Business Model


Management does not steer investors towards evaluating revenue per transaction, but we’ve unraveled 
the mystery for investors; the picture is not pretty!


$ in millions


Source: Sabre Financial Filings


Management does not highlight these metrics, 
and for good reason! However, we have 
calculated them and believe they are highly 
relevant and key performance indicators for the 
business. The results are clear: Sabre’s revenue 
per transaction has been in a deflationary spiral


Two sources of revenue for the Travel Network 
Segment: 1) Transaction-based revenue and 2) 
Media Revenue. Management only provides the 
Transaction-based revenue and total segment 
revenue, so we can deduce the media revenue 
contribution


Segment Gross Profit has contracted each year. 
Transaction-based margin contraction could even be 
worse, but we are unable to determine this since 
management does not break out the impact of the 
media revenue 


On the surface, it appears billable bookings are 
rising sharply, suggesting a healthy business.

Governance Concern: EBITDA is the Sole 
Driving Force Behind Management + Owner Fees


It’s important to evaluate the incentive structure that motivates management and insiders. Accordingly, we observe that 
Sabre’s management variable incentive comp is entirely linked to Adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, its shareholders also 


extract management fees tied to Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, we believe investors should carefully scrutinize the quality of 
Sabre’s EBITDA to make sure management and insiders are not inflating this metric to extract unjust compensation.


Source: Sabre Proxy Statement


Management Services Agreement


On March 30, 2007, we entered into the MSA with affiliates of TPG and Silver Lake (the “Managers”) to provide us with management, advisory and 
consulting services. Pursuant to the MSA, we have been required to pay to the Managers management fees, payable quarterly in arrears, totaling 
to between $5 million to $7 million per year, the actual amount of which is calculated based upon 1% of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the MSA, 
earned by the company in such fiscal year up to a maximum of $7 million. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the annual 
management fee paid to the Managers was $7 million in each year. Additionally, we reimbursed the Managers for all out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by them or their affiliates in connection with services provided to us pursuant to the MSA. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 
2012 the amount reimbursed in expenses was $2 million and $1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the amount 
reimbursed in expenses was not material. In connection with the completion our initial public offering in April 2014 and in contemplation of 
providing continued services to the company after the initial public offering, the Managers received a fee payable pursuant to the MSA in an amount 
equal to, in the aggregate, $21 million plus other unpaid fees and expenses and, thereafter, the MSA was terminated. The MSA included customary 
exculpation and indemnification provisions in favor of the affiliates of TPG and Silver Lake.


Corporate Performance Measure


For purposes of the 2014 EIP, the Compensation Committee selected EBITDA as the sole performance measure. The Compensation Committee 
believed this measure continued to be the best indicator of both corporate and business segment profitability and that overall profitability would 
best position us for a successful re-entry into the public marketplace. For purposes of the 2014 EIP, EBITDA was adjusted to exclude the following 
items: goodwill impairments, prior period non-cash adjustments, and one-time costs associated with specific business enhancement initiatives. 
Our Board of Directors approved these adjustments to better reflect the efforts and performance of our executive officers in relation to the 
current year’s business performance, as well as to encourage them to make decisions that improve the potential for future growth without being 
penalized for the short-term investment required to achieve that growth. In addition to these adjustments, for purposes of the 2014 EIP, EBITDA 
was calculated before making allowance for the amounts payable pursuant to the Sabre Corporation Variable Compensation Plan, our annual 
incentive compensation plan for employees at the level below senior vice president (“Adjusted Pre-VCP/EIP EBITDA”) (Spruce Point Note: 
Sabre does not provide details on the materiality of this adjustment).

Abacus Deal in 2015 Deserves Major Scrutiny


Sabre announced its acquisition of 65% of Abacus in May 2015. 
This related party transaction deserves significant scrutiny because Sabre previously controlled 35% of Abacus 


before acquiring the remaining ownership and consolidating results!


Source: Company press release and presentation


Quick Background on Abacus International Pte Ltd.


• Singapore-based Asian Pacific GDS operator
• Owned by a consortium of 11 Asian airlines alongside Sabre

Critical Abacus Review: Industry View vs. 
Management and Analyst Promotion


The Real Industry Insider Scoop


Source: Tnooz , “Sabre is Ready to spend $500m, and Abacus is likely target” - Jan 27, 2015
Tnooz,  “Sabre confirms $411 million Abacus takeover”- May 14, 2015


• Asset shuffling? On February 24, 2012, Sabre completed the sale 
of its 51% stake in Sabre Pacific, which had been jointly owned, to 
Abacus for $46m million of proceeds. Now, the company will re-
inherit Sabre Pacific, through its Abacus buyout!


• Sabre is doubling down on its traditional, low-margin, air GDS 
business: Runs counter to the [IPO] narrative of growth led by 
the hospitality services division


• Abacus has lost significant Asia Pacific market share to rivals:
For a decade, Abacus has been losing market share to rivals 
Amadeus and Travelport in a steady loss of a point a year


• In 2002, Abacus/Sabre had 57% market share of GDS 
bookings in Asia Pacific, counted as one-way segment 
volume, on average.


• Today that figure is much lower, in the mid-30s 
percentage-wise, said sources


• Higher Incentives to come? Sabre has lost share because it has 
been slower to hike fees it charges its partner airlines. 
Amadeus/Travelport receive higher fees from suppliers allowing 
them to pay higher incentive fees to travel agency subscribers. 
Sabre might be willing to match competitors’ higher level of 
incentives to travel agents, speculates one former executive.


Sabre’s Management Deal Promotion
• CEO Klein: “Acquiring Abacus immediately combines the global 


capabilities of Sabre with the deep local market expertise of the 
leading Asia-Pacific GDS. This powerful combination will give 
customers even more innovation and service options, while allowing 
Sabre to accelerate growth globally in a very capital efficient way –
and to gain regional synergies in all three of our businesses serving 
travel agents, airlines and hospitality companies.”


• CEO of Abacus Robert Bailey: “With our extended network in Asia-
Pacific, Abacus has built a trusted brand of unique significance and 
scale. We now have the opportunity to take the business forward even 
faster, broadening the scope within the Sabre family and with the 
support of our shareholder carriers. This is great news for the industry 
in Asia-Pacific....”


• Warning: Robert Bailey left Abacus a few months later to be CEO 
at Linkswood Group according to his LinkedIn Profile


Analyst Bullish Comments
• Morgan Stanley: “Abacus now gives Sabre control over an entity with 


substantial presence in the largest, fastest growth travel market in 
the world”


• Goldman Sachs: “Still, we view the announcement positively as it 
removes uncertainty and helps simplify the passenger booking 
numbers as well as the income statement”


• Deutsche Bank: “..We would expect Sabre to accelerate Abacus 
growth from 7% in 2014 to high single/low double digit growth 
through share gains”

Warning: Management Quietly Started 
Dumping Shares Ahead of the Abacus Deal


Sabre’s management started a 10b5-1 insider stock sale program in early May 5, 2015 less than ten days before the Abacus 
transaction was announced on May 14, 2015. It is also noteworthy that management did not put this disclosure in writing 


within its earnings press release, its 10-Q filing or by 8-K filing. Instead, management made the selective disclosure during its 
conference call. While not a technical disclosure violation, best practices may have merited expanded disclosure.


Q1 2015 Conference Call: May 5, 2015 


"Before turning the call over to Rick to walk through the financials and the forward look, there is one housekeeping matter that I 
wanted to address. Several members of the executive team, myself included, have entered into 10b5-1 plans to begin selling a portion 
of our Sabre equity. As you know, we were privately held for over seven years and during that time no equity was sold by 
management. As a result, several of us have options that will be expiring in the near term and normal needs for diversification after 
such a long period. We'll continue to hold significant stakes in Sabre stock, keeping our interests aligned with yours.“


While exact details of the 10b5-1 program have not been 
disclosed to investors, we analyzed recent sales through 
Form 4 filings:


• As of the latest proxy statement filed 2/28/15, all 
executive officers and directors owned 6.2m shares or 
2.3% of total shares outstanding


• Form 4 filings indicate that a range of executives and 
directors have sold including the CEO/CFO and EVP of 
Sabre Travel Network 


• We estimate total insider sales of 2.3m shares at 
$27.15/sh average price, reaping $64.4m in proceeds


• Viewed in context of insider holdings pre-10b5-1, 
insiders have sold 37% of their holdings


Note: The CFO joined in March 2013, and others such as 
Alex Alt in 2012. To suggest they all held stock for 7 years 


is slightly misleading!

Warning: Low Quality Earnings Guidance 
Raise Post Abacus Deal Announcement


Spruce Point has consistently warned its readers about the perils of investing in companies that have characteristics of 
diverging earnings and cash flow. Little more than two months after issuing updated guidance for the Abacus acquisition, 


Sabre increased guidance during its Q2’2015 earnings results. In Sabre’s case, its “Adjusted” EBITDA and EPS started 
diverging from free cash flow after it “raised guidance” post the acquisition of Abacus.  


Source: Abacus Presentation, May 14, 2015 Source: Q2 2015 Earnings Presentation, Aug 4, 2015


Sabre increased sales guidance by 2.1%, Adj. EBITDA by 2.8%, and Adjusted EPS range by 4.7% - 5.0%, yet high-end Adjusted Free Cash Flow fell 
by 3.3% from $300m+ to $290m+. The increase was specifically called out to be related to the Travel Network by the CFO on the conf call:


“Now, specific to Travel Network, strong first half growth and continued momentum has led us to increase our full year expectations. We expect 
continued strong Travel Network growth in the back half of the year even before considering the impact of Abacus. So, excluding Abacus, we now 
expect full year Travel Network revenue growth of over 5% on bookings growth of approximately 6%, well within our medium-term expectations of 
4% to 6% topline growth, and ahead of our expectations we previously communicated for 2015 in Travel Network. Including Abacus, beginning July 
1, we now expect Travel Network revenue growth of 13% or more driven by bookings growth of approximately 17%.”

Warning:  Low Quality Earnings, Or Worse, 
Evidence of Spring-Loading Revenues?


• According to the Abacus deal investor presentation, Sabre estimated that 2015 revenue would increase by $120m 
(assuming 8/1/15 closing) as a result of the Abacus acquisition consolidation


• However, the deal actually closed a month earlier on 7/1/15
• In its Q3’15 10-Q (p. 7) and later in its FY 2015 10-K filing (p. 78), Sabre made the following disclosures:


“Since the acquisition date, Abacus contributed $96 million of revenue and $1 million of income from continuing 
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015” (1)


“Since the acquisition date, Abacus contributed $187 million of revenue and $13 million of income from continuing 
operations for the year ended December 31, 2015” 


• Warning: Something Does Not Add Up!
 How is it possible that Q4 revenues declined to $91m ($187m - $96m), yet income surged $12m ($13m - $1m) or 


1,200%. Sabre guided to $10m of total synergies by 2017. Did it somehow exceed its target in just 1 quarter? 


 By closing one month early, Sabre added $67m of incremental revenue in 2015 above the $120m estimate ($187m -
$120m)


 Recall that the $120m initial revenue estimate assuming an 8/1/15 closing would result in 5 months of revenue 
consolidation or approximately $24m of sales per month. Therefore, we would have expected approximately $144m 
($120m+$24m) of full year 2015 Abacus revenue from the addition of the extra month 


(1) Note: When asked on the  Q3’15 earnings conference call, the CFO said the impact of the Abacus acquisition was approximately $70-75m for the quarter, significantly less than disclosed in the 10-Q 
which was filed with the SEC on the same day.


Given that Abacus and Sabre were related parties in this M&A transaction, there is an above average risk of “Spring-Loading” 
or earnings and cash flow management around deals. 


This accounting maneuver came under scrutiny during the Tyco scandal and has been studied by academics at Yale

Warning:  Questionable Earnings “Beat” in 2015


• So how did Q3 financial results play out for Sabre? The company reported revenue of $785m and $0.29c of Adj. EPS and beat 
Wall St. estimates by just 1 cent and revenue estimates by just $11.7m!


“Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to 29 cents per share. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. 
The average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 28 cents per share. The 
provider of technology services to the travel industry posted revenue of $785 million in the period, which also beat Street 
forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $773.3 million“ 


Source: Associated Press


• Also in Q4, Sabre yet again beat Wall St. earnings estimates by 1 cent, but disappointed on the revenue line by posting 
$758.5.m vs. $762.1m estimates. 


“Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 27 cents per share. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. 
The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 26 cents per share. The 
provider of technology services to the travel industry posted revenue of $758.5 million in the period, falling short of Street 
forecasts. Four analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $762.1 million.”

Given our concerns raised on the previous slide about the Abacus transaction and numbers not making 
sense, it’s worth questioning the quality of the earnings “beats” in subsequent quarters.

The Ugly Reality


By adjusting Sabre’s financials to remove the impact of Abacus, we find that its revenue growth rate 
declined significantly during 2015, well below management’s guidance range of 4% - 6% (1)

“Since the acquisition date, Abacus contributed $96 million of revenue and $1 million of income from continuing operations for the three and nine 
months ended September 30, 2015”

Management Still Touting Travel Network 
Growth Excluding Abacus into 2016....


Sabre’s management is still touting 6% growth in the Travel Network segment well into 2016 despite strong 
evidence to suggest they fell well short of this goal in 2015!


Source: FY 2015 Earnings Presentation, Feb 8, 2016


“At Travel Network we delivered global growth and increased 
share. Globally, our 2015 share increased a full point to 36.6% 
with 80 basis points of growth in North America and 170 basis 
points of growth in EMEA. Acquiring Abacus bolstered our 
position giving us control of our destiny in the fastest-growing 
travel region in the world. With that integration well underway, 
we're now getting much deeper with our Asia-Pacific customers 
to ensure that we have the right solutions for the market and 
create opportunities to grow market share. In EMEA we 
continue to grow the business which is much faster than market 
growth rates.”


CFO on FY 2015 Conference Call, Feb 9, 2016


“Travel Network revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 
21% in the quarter supported by our overall bookings growth. 
Excluding the impact of consolidating Abacus, Travel Network 
revenue increased approximately 6% in the quarter. Bookings 
increased 33% in the quarter. Growth was driven by the 
acquisition of Abacus as well as solid growth across our North 
America and Europe, Middle East, Africa business. Even when 
excluding the positive impact of the Abacus acquisition, global 
bookings increased a strong 8% overall in the quarter.”

Management Still Touting Travel Network 
Growth Excluding Abacus (cont’d)


Management has continued to tout its core travel network business is growing mid to high single digits 
organically despite evidence to the contrary


Source: Goldman Sachs Tech and Internet Conf, Feb 10 2016


<Q - James Schneider>: That's super helpful overview. So, maybe, Rick, you want to take the guidance question. 
Maybe just, I think by any stretch the 2016 guidance you guys issued yesterday was pretty strong. Can you maybe 
just help us – but also include the effect of a couple of acquisitions in there that you've done. So can you maybe 
unpack first the guidance, kind of what the impact of the acquisitions is and then kind of what the underlying 
volume assumptions are on the Travel Network side, as well as the kind of growth assumptions...


<A - Richard A. Simonson>: Sure.


<Q - James Schneider>: ...for solutions?


<A - Richard A. Simonson>: For 2016, so in the Travel Network side, and it's been very representative of what we 
showed in fourth quarter where we had strong double-digit top line revenue and bookings growth. That was 
benefited from our acquisition of Abacus, the go-to-market entity that we had a minority interest. We took full 
control of that. But our underlying bookings in the fourth quarter, revenue and bookings, we're running 6%, 7%, 
8%. And again, so our core business is growing above the rate of general travel growth. That sets up well on how 
we're positioned and a bit of market share gain overall. We see that trend repeating itself essentially in 2016 and 
that's how you get to those strong teens growth rate in revenue and bookings for Travel Network. But you still 
have mid to high-single digit organic growth rate adjusting for the Abacus acquisition and Travel Network.

More Evidence Suggesting Abacus Int’l
Accounting Issues


From Sabre Filings: Sabre Revenue From Abacus > Abacus PurchasesPrimary revenue 
generated from Abacus is 
data processing fees 
associated with bookings 
on the Sabre GDS


Revenue from Abacus is 
notably higher than 
related company purchase 
of services reported by 
Abacus! 


A receivable from Abacus 
on Sabre’s books, should 
correspond to a payable 
on Abacus’ books. 


Notably, the $29.3m that 
Sabre reported in 2013, is 
higher than the entire 
trade payable of $20.1m 
reported by Abacus!


(*)  Abacus explicitly says that, “Accrued expenses relate mainly to accrued incentives payable 
to travel agents.” Thus, we can rule out that amounts payable to Sabre are included here.

More Evidence of Joint Venture Accounting 
Concerns


$ in thousands


Sabre recognizes its proportionate share of earnings from joint ventures under the “Equity Method” which means it 
recognizes non-cash earnings through the income statement, and deducts it from the cash flow statement. 


However, actual cash dividends received are accounted for as an increase in operating cash flow. 
Take careful notice that in 2015, dividends exceeded the actual earnings from joint ventures.

Operating Cash Flow Appears Overstated, 
Actually Declined in 2015


$ in millions


Because Sabre received more dividends than income in 2015, accounting rules dictate that excess cash 
must be accounted for as a “Return of Capital” and not a “Return on Capital.” (1)


As a result, we are justified in reclassifying $13.9m of cash from operations, to cash flow from investing. 
On a pro-forma basis, Sabre’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow appears to have declined in 2015 by 2.6%!

Evidence of Aggressive Upfront 
Incentive Capitalization 


While capitalization of upfront cash incentives is not outright disallowed under GAAP, Spruce Point believes it is 
an aggressive accounting choice to capitalize normal and recurring operating expenses. This accounting choice 


increases current period earnings by stretching out expenses over future periods. In the next few slides, our 
analysis will illustrate that Sabre appears to be making more aggressive use of this capitalization strategy. By our 


calculation, upfront capitalize incentives surged from $53.7m to $63.5m in 2015, an 18% increase. We believe 
investors would be better served by evaluating its business by deducting upfront cash incentives.

Evidence of Aggressive Accounting For 
Customer Incentives (cont’d)


Sabre warns of upfront incentives it must offer, but does not focus attention on quantifying the impact for investors:


“We must compete with other GDSs and other competitors for their business by offering competitive upfront incentive consideration, which, due 
to the strong bargaining power of these large travel buyers, tend to increase in each round of contract renewals.”(1)


Isn’t it ironic that prior to finalizing its take-private LBO in 2007, Sabre led investors to believe that incentive costs would fall!


“Additionally, with the launch of our Efficient Access Solution (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) we expect to lower incentive 
costs over time” (2)


Pre-LBO Sabre capitalized and amortized expenses over a short period of generally 3 years: 


“Certain service contracts with significant travel agency subscribers contain booking productivity clauses and other provisions that allow 
subscribers to receive cash payments or other consideration. We establish liabilities for these commitments and recognize the related expense as 
the subscribers earn incentives based on the applicable contractual terms. Accrued incentives liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were 
approximately $107 million and $82 million, respectively. Periodically, we make cash payments to subscribers at inception or modification of a 
service contract which are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the service contract, which is generally three years.” (2)


Post-LBO Sabre capitalizes incentives and amortizes them 3-5 years to earnings, allowing it to stretch out and reduce expenses


“Our Travel Network business at times provides upfront incentive consideration to travel agency subscribers at the inception or modification 
of a service contract, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over an average expected life of the service contract, generally 
over three to five years. Such consideration is made with the objective of increasing the number of clients or to ensure or improve customer 
loyalty. Such service contract terms are established such that the supplier and other fees generated over the life of the contract will exceed the 
cost of the incentive consideration provided upfront. Such service contracts with travel agency subscribers require that the customer commit to 
achieving certain economic objectives and generally have terms requiring repayment of the upfront incentive consideration if those objectives 
are not met.” (1)

comment on with directionally pricing and what is the term 
length of the new agreements?”


<A: CEO, Thomas Klein>: “Yeah. I'm not going to give you a 
whole lot of detail there, Jim. I appreciate why you asked 
the question, but there's only so much and so far I can go. 
They are confidential contracts. I will say they are very 
long-term and they lock in any of the components that we 
felt drove value in the joint venture.”

Discounts, contained in “Other Assets, Net” 
Assuming a 4yr amortization period 


suggests 2015 annual amortization of

Sabre says that “Deferred Customer Advances and Discounts are amortized are amortized in future periods as the related 
revenue is earned.” If this is true, our forensic analysis fails to identify these amortization amounts, but it appears they are


rapidly growing as a % of revenue

Easy To Refute the Bull Case 
on Sabre Corp.


“Guidance over Street expectations was a bright spot considering the 
company has established a track record of beating its guidance since 
going public in 2014”


Analysts’ Investment Highlights


This analyst doesn’t appear to have looked carefully! In our opinion, 
Sabre closed the Abacus deal a month early and may have spring-loaded 
revenues to account for its Q2’15 earnings beat. Furthermore, by 
removing the effect of the Abacus deal, Sabre would have all but certainly 
missed its 2015 targets


Spruce Point’s Rebuttal


“Free Cash Flow generation is finally inflecting”


Sounds like wishful thinking. What good are barriers when deflation is 
causing decreasing revenue per transaction and customer incentives are 
rising? Furthermore, barriers cannot stop the disintermediation away from 
GDS that is occurring as evidenced by the Lufthansa news and Google’s 
entry in to the business


“As Sabre continues to execute with better visibility around core 
revenue growth, expanding EBITDA margins, declining leverage, long-
term EPS growth, a 2.0% dividend yield and real investor return as 
fundamentals accelerate out of 2015, we expect Sabre's multiple to re-
rate to levels closer to that of Amadeus' with headwinds and 
Travelocity noise behind the company.”


“Defensive growth + catalysts = 2016 outperformer. As one of the 
more defensive names in tech, potential catalysts ahead and front-
end loaded guidance, we expect the shares to outperform”


There is nothing defensive about Sabre’s business. Its Travel Network 
business (>70% of revenues and EBITDA) is not a guaranteed recurring 
revenue source with long sticky contracts, but rather tied to the cyclicality 
of the airline and travel business. Our research suggest its core business 
is not growing at the mid single digit rate management suggests, but in 
fact is at best stagnant


“SABR is well established with over $2.7 billion in revenue, 
substantial barriers to entry in the core GDS business, and is set up 
for strong and improving fundamentals into 2016/2017, in our view”


Yes, inflecting downward! Our forensic analysis suggests that Sabre 
included JV dividends in excess of JV income to bolster 2015 operating 
cash flow. By reclassifying the excess dividend as an investment cash 
flow, we find that Sabre’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow declined in 2015!


“Bull case includes the company sees a pricing lift as it penetrates 
new European and emerging markets which can be 20%+ higher
than its concentrated market in the US.”


In our opinion, Sabre’s multiple should re-rate lower not higher! There’s 
no evidence that under private ownership, and since coming public again 
in 2014, that Sabre’s has improved its overall cash flow or capital 
efficiency. The fairness opinion from the LBO suggested a terminal 
EBITDA multiple of 6.5x -8.0x. We believe this is the appropriate valuation 
range given Sabre’s fundamental challenges and low earnings quality


How many times have investors been pitched “blue sky international 
opportunities”  C’mon sell-side analysts, come up with an original selling 
point please! Sabre operates in a globally competitive business. It would 
be overly optimistic to assume Sabre can easily penetrate any mature 
market and achieve substantially higher pricing

Dec 2006 TPG / Silver Lake Sabre Corp 10.2x 7.8x

“Goldman Sachs selected exit multiples ranging from 5.5x to 7.5x in order to calculate the terminal value based upon factors including 
precedent transaction analyses and the Company’s forward EBITDA Multiple prior to announcement.”


“Morgan Stanley selected exit multiples ranging from 7.0x to 8.0x last twelve months EBITDA in order to calculate the terminal value by 
applying this multiple to Sabre Holdings’ estimated fiscal year 2011 EBITDA. The exit multiples of 7.0x to 8.0x were based upon analyses of 
transaction multiples of selected precedent transactions.”


“Bear Stearns used LTM EBITDA exit multiples of 7.0x to 8.0x for the Multi-Year Outlook cases and 6.5x to 7.5x for the Extended Outlook 
cases. In estimating the terminal value exit multiples, Bear Stearns considered Sabre Holdings’ current and recent trading multiples, adjusted 
downward to reflect declining future growth in EBITDA as projected by Sabre Holdings’ relative to current EBITDA growth rates.”


(1) Based on Sabre’s 2016E EBITDA


Precedent Acquisitions in Travel GDS 


Sabre’s LBO multiple at 10.2x was a function of a leverage bubble that ultimately burst. Precedent transactions 
(including its Abacus deal), and its own fairness opinion, suggest a long-term “terminal multiple” in the 6.5x - 8.0x 


range. Given evidence of core deterioration in its business being masked by accounting shenanigans, Sabre should 
not get a multiple expansion.

Analysts Again Fail to Include Hefty Tax 
Receivable Agreement in the Valuation


As noted in our previous research on Planet Fitness, we believe tax receivable agreements (“TRA”) are widely 
misunderstood and often ignored by analysts and investors for their impact on cash flow and valuation (1). 


Sabre has a “TRA” with imminent cash flow implications and problematic accounting implications


(1) Private Equity Squeezing Out Cash Long After the IPO, NY Times, March 13, 2013


According to Sabre:


• “Based on current tax laws and assuming that we and our subsidiaries earn sufficient taxable income to realize 
the full tax benefits subject to the TRA, we estimate that future payments under the TRA relating to the Pre-
IPO Tax Assets to total $387 million.”


• “Any payments made under the TRA will be classified as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows.”


Warning: We believe this would be an incorrect financial classification of TRA payments. In reality, the 
payments should be classified as operating cash flows!  There are numerous examples of companies 
correctly accounting for payments as deductions of operating cash flows, and ultimately free cash flow  
including PBF Energy, Change Healthcare, Premier, Inc., and Berry Plastics


• “The timing of future payments under the TRA is uncertain and dependent on the timing of the realization of 
taxable income. We expect to make the total required payments over the next five years with no material 
payments to occur before 2017. “


Warning: Expected payments are rapidly approaching. Analysts largely fail to account for these payments 
as a reduction to operating and free cash flow

Valuation Inflated on Abnormally High EPS 
Growth Expectations


EV / 2016E Adj. EBITDA


2016E EPS GrowthNet Debt / 2016E EBITDA


On the surface, Sabre’s valuation appears 
in-line with peers Travelport (Nasdaq: 
TVPT) and Amadeus (BME: AMS). 
However, by adjusting its enterprise value 
for the tax receivable agreement liability 
and its EBITDA for the aggressive 
capitalization of upfront incentives, 
Sabre’s valuation is rich. Sabre’s high YoY 
EPS growth is a function of the partial 
year 2015 Abacus consolidation, is 
supporting the valuation.

Realistic Price Target Implies 
40% - 60% Downside


Sabre’s valuation needs to be re-rated to reflect its terminal multiple indicated by the exact same analysts that 
conducted its fairness opinion in 2007. A lower valuation is justified by the heightened risks facing (disintermediation, 


deflation, greater incentives) and its inability to deliver any measurable cash flow improvement. Furthermore, Sabre 
should trade at a discount due to the evidence we presented which suggests accounting irregularities.
