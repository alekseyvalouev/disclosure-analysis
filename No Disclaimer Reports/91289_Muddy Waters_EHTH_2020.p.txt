Summary:	
 
• EHTH’s highly aggressive accounting masks what we believe is a significantly 


unprofitable business.  Based on variable costs alone, we estimate that EHTH will lose 
approximately -$135 from each MA member it enrolled in 2019.  If also including fixed 
costs, our per MA member loss estimate becomes -$402. 


 
• We adjust 2019 revenue down by $128 million or 25%.  We adjust 2019 operating profit 


down by $263 million due to subjective and misapplied mark-to-model accounting, 
yielding an operating loss of -$181 million.	


	
• EHTH’s persistence assumptions in its LTV model seem highly aggressive when 


compared to reality.  After ASC 606 went into effect, member churn immediately 
skyrocketed.  We conclude that EHTH is pursuing low quality, lossmaking growth while 
its LTVs are based on lower churn, pre-growth cohorts.	


	
• We conclude that the key driver of growth since 2018 has been EHTH’s reliance on Direct 


Response television advertising, which attracts an unprofitable, high churn enrollee.	
 
• To generate this unprofitable growth, EHTH has been incinerating cash, which we expect 


it to continue to do until this value destruction slows down or stops.	
 
• EHTH management is, in our view, running a massive stock promotion.  In addition to 


using aggressive modeling assumptions, they misleadingly downplay the need for ongoing 
service and retention.  This is the crux of how they justify booking multiple years of 
revenue at one time.  Management also manipulates its presentation of churn to be 
misleadingly low.  EHTH appears to be booking multi-year “tail” revenue at the end of 
each cohort’s estimated life, which is extremely aggressive in light of the significantly 
elevated churn.  While publicly comparing EHTH to Expedia and Zillow, insiders have 
sold $34.9 million of shares since the beginning of 2019.

2014 – The Year that Birthed EHTH’s Stock Promotion 


 
There are three years that explain the problems with EHTH – 2014, 2016, and 2018.  The 
foundation for the promotion was laid in 2014 when FASB codified ASC 606, announcing that it 
would be effective by January 1, 2018.1  ASC 606, which was intended to rationalize revenue 
recognition for software companies, would have a perverse impact on how EHTH reports and 
operates.  We think it reasonable to assume EHTH’s new leaders, Messrs. Flanders and Francis, 
knew of the impending standard when they took over in mid-2016.  The promotion took off in 
2018, which is when we perceive the company began pursuing higher churn and unprofitable 
enrollees in order to exploit ASC 606.  The goal seems to have been to give the impression that 
EHTH was growing in a way that made it the “Expedia” or “Zillow” of health insurance.2   
 
The new management’s first full year was 2017.  This was a year in which growth in MA 
Approved Applications was barely-existent, but member churn was quite low.  We understand 
that with its low churn, 2017 combined with 2016 to determine the member life assumptions in 
EHTH’s 2018 LTV revenue model.  In 2017, EHTH began testing DR television advertising in-
house. 
 
Video killed the radio star.  We believe it also killed the three-year life of EHTH’s MA enrollees.  
In 2018, EHTH underwent a selling explosion, growing available call center capacity by 129%,3 
and focusing on its television advertising.4  Despite management’s talk of EHTH’s online 
marketing, we believe the outsize growth of EHTH’s MA business is dependent on “direct 
response” advertising, such as mailers and ambulance chaser quality TV commercials.  Although 
EHTH’s DR advertising has helped lower the acquisition cost per enrollee, DR advertising draws 
in less sticky members, who we believe are on the whole quite unprofitable.   
 
In contrast to 2017’s miniscule growth in MA Accepted Applications of only 1.2%, 2018 and 
2019 saw respective growth rates of 25.8% and 88.3%.  We calculate that the MA churn rate shot 
up from 36.9% in 2017 to 45.6% 2018 and then 47.0% in 2019.5  It is obvious that 2018 and 
2019 MA enrollee profiles are not comparable to that of 2017.   
 
Interestingly, EHTH recently changed its MA LTV model so that it heavily weights the prior 
three years in determining the life assumption, ensuring that 2017 remains relevant for another 
year.6

Aggressive LTV Life Assumptions 
 
The Company estimates member persistence in order to calculate its health insurance plan LTVs.  
Among these estimates are:7 
 


• Three years for MA plans 
• Five years for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans 
• Five years for Medicare Supplement plans 


 
We believe that EHTH uses an overly optimistic MA member persistence assumption, which has 
a material impact on profitability (or lack thereof) of an enrollee.  EHTH also discloses that it 
only breaks even on each MA member after the second year.8  On the back of aggressive DR 
advertising, the churn percentages for MA enrollees skyrocketed from 2017 to 2018 and 2019.  It 
is therefore clear that EHTH has been bringing in significantly less sticky MA members since 
2017, yet its persistence assumption seems to be based – at least in part – on that lower churn 
enrollee profile.  Moreover, as we show below, EHTH’s presentation to investors of its implied 
churn is manipulated lower by using a small numerator and a large denominator.  We question 
whether that manipulated methodology factors into the assumptions used in the LTV model. 
This practice of estimating lifetimes means that EHTH books three years of future sales for an 
MA application even though it should expect to lose 47% of its members over the first year post-
sale.  EHTH then expects that commissions from customers who stay for more than three years 
are at least equal to the sales it booked for the customers who lasted less than the three-year MA 
life.  We believe the company has used its small group of longer-lived customers to justify a 
three-year life to begin with, as first-year retention at the company is so poor.   
 
However, at the end of the three-year life, EHTH appears to book sales again to further capture 
“tail” revenue associated with these customers for whom it already has booked a commission.  
We believe the combination of using a three-year life and then booking additional commission 
revenue for tail customers overstates expected future cash collections from EHTH’s members 
and flies in the face of the marked increase in MA churn rates.   
 
EHTH recognizes the commissions to be received over the entirety of its customers’ lives 
upfront as revenue.  It does so by computing customer lifetime values, which are supposed to 
represent the lifetime commissions to be received for the average customer approved for a 
specific category of health plan.  EHTH then “constrains” the LTVs primarily by reducing them 
by a percentage that matches EHTH’s estimate for the approved applications that will not

Page 4 of 15
convert into paying customers.9  The constraint on the MA LTV is 7%.  EHTH then multiplies 
the constrained LTVs by the approved applications to report revenue.   
 
The LTVs are highly sensitive to even small changes in the persistence assumption.  Based on 
the 47.0% implied churn in 2019 MA members, the implied life is 2.1 years.  To be conservative 
and company-favorable, we use a 2.34-year remaining life, which is the average of the 2017 
through 2019 MA cohorts’ implied lives, rather than EHTH’s 3.0 years.  In our model, this 
adjustment drops the 2019 MA LTV by 28.1% or $285.   
 
To calculate the implied churn rates for each quarter, we use the following formula: 
 


𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠	 − 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠
𝑃𝑎𝑠𝑡	𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑟	𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 	𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟��





 
Over the past two years, MA implied churn has steadily worsened to 47%, which implies a life 
of only 2.1 years.

Page 5 of 15
EHTH’s persistence assumptions for Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D also look highly 
aggressive relative to churn from the 2018 and 2019 cohorts.  For Medicare Supplement, EHTH 
churn implies a life of 4.3 years. 
 


Table 3: eHealth Medicare Supplement Churn 
 





  
For Medicare Part D, EHTH churn indicates a life of 4.1 years. 
 


Table 4: eHealth Medicare Part D Churn 
 


 
 
We believe EHTH has taken advantage of its reliance on two statistical models, one for new 
members and one for aged members.  As a result, we believe that the company significantly 
overstates the remaining customer life on its books in order to arrive at its $589 million 
commissions receivable balance.  
 


𝑅𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔	𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙	𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒 − 𝐸𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔	𝐶𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑟	𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒 
 
In MA, for example, we calculate that EHTH uses 3.35 years of remaining life.  This means that 
EHTH assumes its customers’ total lives are well above 3.35 years, due to the fact that the 
company’s book of business has already aged.  We, on the other hand, model remaining life of 
2.34 years, which is the mean of the implied lives of 2017 through 2019 MA cohort members.  
The net effect of this extra year of customer life on the books is that we estimate EHTH’s 
constrained LTV for MA members is overstated by 28.2%.

We believe the backbone of EHTH’s growth in MA Accepted Applications in 2018 and 2019 
was a high-churn demographic that responds to DR advertising.  Our research made clear that 
two demographics have particularly high churn in the MA space: Low income enrollees and 
younger than 65 members who qualify for Medicare because of disability.  Low income 
enrollees tend to churn because once they use the $0 premium plans, they find them lacking, and 
are quick to respond to someone else’s ad during the next Annual Enrollment Period (“AEP”).  
The under-65 members generally are able to switch plans every 90 days, rather than only during 
the AEP.  As a result, they are high churn, particularly because carriers are generally not trying 
hard to retain them because their high utilization of healthcare often makes them unprofitable.  
Former EHTH executives told us the following: 
 


“It’s sort of the dredges of advertising. [EHTH] buy very cheap inventory on cable TV… 
that tend to just attract an older demographic and demographic that tends to be watching 
like 10 hours of TV a day, makes less than $25,000 a year. That’s where they get their 
enormous, through that channel. That is the most effective scale of channel for all of 
Medicare Advantage because all these people are poor and to get a zero-dollar premium 
plan that covers everything is a really good deal and they should be on it. And, so that’s 
where they fish, so when you do that, they way that they do, every year around annual 
enrollment time, there are same people wanting those TV commercials again and eHealth 
really has no brand loyalty. People don’t remember, know they are eHealth customers, 
they end up becoming [another] customer. eHealth is just some commercial on TV that 
they see a phone number and it says, “Hey, call in for your free dental and vision.” So, 
they call. So, those people tend to be switchers, right? Next year they are going to see the 
same commercial and they’re going to dial again and they’re going to start off the thing, 
“Where is my fee dental?” The way they did this year. They don’t have loyalty… 
 
…Yeah, I would say the way to answer that question [about whether customer lives are 
trending down], you are what you eat and that meaning whatever their marketing 
channels are there will give you an indication of the LTV. If 60, 70% of customers are 
still coming through DR TV than, yeah, you can look at that three years. That’s probably 
accurate. That’s what it was a few years ago… I think if anything, it might be getting 
worse when I left there was four, five hundred agents. I think two years later they had 
like fifteen and sixteen hundred agents and they have to feed a lot more people. And, the 
only way to feed them is through more TV. So, if anything I’d say maybe they’re 
certainly not improving [the persistence] in my book. They might be hurting it even more 
because of the need to keep those call center agents busy.”10 
 
“And then whenever you had DR TV and things like that you could drive that mix up like 
fifty percent of under sixty-five which is not good, desirable mix that the carriers wanted. 
They usually wanted something under thirty percent or something like that… We started 
TV probably the last couple of years I was there.”11

An advertising measurement company estimates that EHTH has spent approximately $15 million 
across two TV ad campaigns that have generated in excess of one billion TV impressions.12,13  
One of the ads invokes multiple late-night TV commercial stereotypes, including a tanned 
pitchman who looks like a 72-year old Brad Pitt.

EHTH Deliberately Obscures the Increasing Churn 
 
We see EHTH as taking pains to pull the wool over investors’ eyes with respect to recent churn 
rates.  EHTH has published its own churn rates, which in our view materially understate the 
churn.  EHTH manipulates these metrics by using an aggressively small numerator and a 
misleadingly large denominator.  We question whether this manipulation of the churn rate flows 
into the assumptions in EHTH’s LTV model. 
 
Below is a slide from the most recent investor presentation showing lower churn metrics seven to 
10 percentage points lower than we calculate.  One glance shows the absurdity of EHTH’s 
methodology (which we describe below): The denominator used to calculate churn is actually 
greater than the Estimated Ending Membership in the two most recent quarters!

Page 8 of 15
EHTH also aggressively states the numerator.  EHTH defines churn as follows: 
 


𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 + 𝑁𝑒𝑤	𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠	(𝐸𝑠𝑡. ) 	− 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒	𝑇𝑇𝑀	𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎��𝑒𝑑	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 + 𝑁𝑒𝑤	𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔	𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠	(𝐸𝑠𝑡. )


 
 
The numerator EHTH uses to calculate churn, in our view, is aggressive.  EHTH is double-
dipping by constraining the model for applicants who it estimates do not turn into paying 
members.  This flows into New Paying Members.  It should be noted that in this calculation, 
New Paying Members has an outsize effect on the numerator at 212.8% of the numerator.  
Therefore, a relatively small adjustment downward in this number has a large effect on the 
resulting calculation. 
 
We see this as aggressive because when EHTH calculates its revenue for reporting purposes, it 
constrains the LTV for applications that do not convert into paying customers.  Therefore, it is 
aggressive to also impose a similar constraint on the Approved Members.   
 
EHTH uses a misleadingly large customer pool as the denominator.  The company adds New 
Paying Members to Estimated Members, which does not make sense, as it ignores the customers 
dropping out over the course of the quarter.  In fact, the EHTH customer base given by New 
Paying Members plus Estimated Members seemingly never exists in any given quarter.  Taking 
the average Estimated Member count over the period, as we did, would be an appropriately 
conservative methodology.  However, we think the company clings to this outsized customer 
total for a simple reason: when it comes to churn, EHTH needs to make the numbers.   
This twisted method of calculating churn begs the question: When EHTH uses a three-year 
persistence assumption, is it based on this means of calculating churn? 
 
 
Costs That Make MA Members Unprofitable 
 
Against a constrained MA LTV of $728, we apply total costs of $863 to arrive at a 2019 per 
member loss of -$135.  There are two sets of costs: Upfront and ongoing.  As we discuss infra, 
management minimizes the extent of ongoing costs because pretending there is no need to

service or act to retain existing customers is central to EHTH’s improper application of ASC 
606. 
 
We estimate that EHTH has ongoing costs of service and retention of $96 per MA member per 
year, which includes commissions paid to partners.  On a 2.34-year remaining life, that totals 
$226.  These service costs are not only important because of their impact on the LTV, but they 
also show how aggressive EHTH is in applying ASC 606.  We include in this figure $45 of costs 
($19 per year) for ongoing commissions that EHTH is obligated to pay channel partners. 
 
We allocate 20% of EHTH’s Customer Care and Enrollment and Technology and Content 
expenses to retention of existing members.  We allocate 10% of Marketing & Advertising 
expense to retention efforts.  These ongoing costs come out to $51.3 million across the entire 
business.  After these costs are allocated to each segment by its revenue contribution, they come 
to $96 per member for MA. 
 


Table 6: Retention and Service Expense Allocation 


 
 
Upfront costs, on the other hand, are the Marketing and Advertising as well as Customer Care 
and Enrollment expenses not assigned to ongoing costs.  They total $242.7 million, or, when 
allocated proportionally by revenue, $637 per MA member each year. 
 
Ongoing Costs = Ongoing Performance 
 
The crux of EHTH’s application of ASC 606 is that EHTH books multiple years of commission 
revenue by claiming that no further performance on its part is necessary in order to collect these 
commissions.  This ignores the reality that EHTH needs to provide ongoing service to members 
and conduct outreach to them in order to retain them.  We therefore wholly disagree with 
EHTH’s recognizing more than one year of commissions in each period.  
 
EHTH pretends that ongoing service needs, which carry real costs, do not exist.  According to 
the company’s accounting, the sole performance obligation is: 
 


“the approval of an application from health insurance carriers, which we define as our 
customers.”14   


																																																													
14 EHTH 2019 10-K, p. 80 


Page 10 of 15
EHTH wants to have its cake and eat it too.  On the commission side, it recognizes commissions 
that it says are probable.  It fails to take service and retention into account because they are not 
legal obligations.  Management actively misleads investors about the need for further service: 
 


“The costs attached to each of the receivable balances have essentially been absorbed as 
we generate the revenue in any particular quarter. So as the cash comes in, there is no 
additional cost attached to that. And the reason that those receivables are there is because 
there is no meaningful service component attached to them either.”  
– Scott Flanders Q1 2018 Earnings Call 
 


Mr. Flanders has doubled down on that misleading statement by discussing a focus on improving 
retention efforts, but misleadingly dismissing it as being a de minimis cost and effort (emphasis 
added):15 
 


“And the opportunities for us to significantly improve retention rates in that 90-day 
period post-sale are both substantial and reflect a lot of near-term opportunity that we are 
very much focused on at the moment.  No incremental costs associated with that kind of 
opportunity and to the extent that we're successful in meaningfully changing that amount 
of churn, that will ultimately reflect in meaningfully higher LTVs for Medicare 
customers in the relatively near future.  The second piece of the retention pie that we're 
going after is that post-90 day, so more of a relational aspect with customers. Here again, 
an area that the company has historically not placed much of any focus on in terms of 
proving out the value proposition that we as a company have and continuing to help that 
customer manage their Medicare insurance purchase and to basically make sure that they 
are in the right plan at whatever point they are in their life or economic cycle, and to keep 
them as eHealth customers throughout the process rather than going elsewhere to buy 
another plan when things change for them. Here again, a very small investment, well 
under $1 million, for us to put some of the technology and other high-value 
engagement tools in place to help these folks recognize that eHealth is a valuable part of 
their insurance purchasing and management process and keeping them in the boat.” 
 


We view these statements as disingenuous because customers are not obligated to renew their 
policies.  EHTH has to fight to retain business because the industry is highly competitive, and 
plans change regularly. 
 
Former EHTH executives also dispute management’s notion, stating or agreeing that ongoing 
retention and service takes resources and costs average $50 to $100 per MA member per year.  
They described in practical terms EHTH’s typical MA service and retention (emphasis added): 
 


“And, especially with Medicare enrollments season and sign up period, during Medicare 
open enrollment, there’s often times where if you enroll somebody in October, there is a 
very high chance that that person could get signed up by another broker or even by the 
carrier. And, switch them off of your broker record. So, essentially you wouldn’t get the 
credit for that, the person. So, that was one frequent activity, like how do we make sure 


																																																													
15 EHTH Q2 2018 Earnings Call. 


Page 11 of 15
with that close rate from essentially the sale, to enrollment, to payment, is high. So, you 
always want to maximize that and then beyond that of course it’s the retention activities 
after the initial enrollment or say after each year, after each quarter, whatever is 
appropriate, let you keep on continuing, offering essentially value add…Again, it’s not a 
huge burden art but it’s essentially just to check in. So, making sure okay, you’re still in 
the right plan or given changes to your plan or changes to the provider network in your 
area might actually be the switch plans or something. So, I think there’s lot of efforts 
focused on that and even more so with the 606… “… I’m sure it does add a little bit to it 
[cost] because if you’re talking about retention call, you might be looking at an 
outbound call, maybe 15 minutes or something like that, 15 to 30 minutes versus an 
enrollment call is anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour so your cost should be a little bit 
lower on that front.”16 
 
“A lot of those touch points and investments were during with a combination of 
reminders via email and then our call center is being able to follow up and maintain the 
book of members over time.”17 
 


An executive with a competing online broker quantified his company’s annual retention 
expenses for members as likely between $25 and $50, and definitely less than $100. 
 
Of our $96 allocation to ongoing costs, by adding back technology and content and revenue 
sharing expenses, we attribute $60 to human-led customer service and retention activities, which 
matches the low end of the $50 to $100 per MA member per year range cited by the former 
employee.  We also learned that customer service agents receive bonuses for retaining 
employees, which presents an additional ongoing retention cost.  We do not account for such 
bonuses in our retention costs figure. 
 
We estimate that EHTH has annual commission obligations that average $45 over the lifetime of 
each MA member ($19 per year).  We understand that approximately 15% to 20% of all EHTH’s 
enrollees are referred through marketing partnerships, and these marketing partnerships are 
overwhelmingly concentrated in the MA and Medicare Supplement categories.18  Of such 
partnerships, we understand that approximately 60% require EHTH to pay revenue share over 
the life of the member. 19  We further understand that the share paid to the partner is 
approximately 15% to 25% of the commissions received.  Based on our conversations with 
former employees and industry executives, we attribute about 2% of annual EHTH operating 
expenses, or $8.7 million, to such costs. The MA share of such expenses works out to 
approximately $19 per estimated MA member in 2019, or $45 per MA member over 2.34 years.

18 Partnerships were 90% concentrated in the MA and Medicare Supplement segments, per an interview with a 
former EHTH employee, April 2020.  
19 Assuming 17.5% of year-end 2019 members, at the midpoint, were referred through partnerships, of which 60% 
entered through multiyear revenue-sharing agreements, yields approximately 120,000 EHTH members for whom 
eHealth has an obligation to share annual commissions.

EHTH’s Medicare Advantage Business is Actually Unprofitable 
 
On a unit basis, we conclude the EHTH’s MA business is significantly loss-generating.  Rather 
than reflecting “investment for growth”, we believe that EHTH’s greatly increasing cash burn 
shows how value destructive EHTH’s pursuit of MA member growth at breakneck speed is. 
 
Our adjusted 2019 MA enrollee loss on variable costs only is -$135.  We first adjust for the 
impact of a 2.34-year remaining life, which results in a $285 decrease in LTV.  We then allocate 
the remaining (i.e., current) operating expenses to MA by the percentage of revenue MA 
represents for EHTH.  Then we divide that number by the number of 2019 MA Estimated 
Members.  This yields an average current year expense of $96 per 2019 MA enrollee, which 
comes to $226 over a 2.34-year life.   Finally, we subtract acquisition costs net of operating 
expenses classed as retention and service costs, which total $637 per member.  The result is that 
EHTH loses -$135 on every MA member who submits an application. 
 


Table 8: eHealth MA Unit Economics 
 


 
 
The unit economics of the business appear even worse after adding an additional dose of reality.  
When including annual fixed costs in the calculation, we estimate the company will lose -$402 
on every MA customer. 
 


Table 9: eHealth MA Unit Economics Inclusive of Fixed Costs 
 


 
 
EHTH management has consistently been unable to meet its forecasts of when the company will 
generate positive operating cash flow.  These repeated misses and the resulting cash incineration 
show the value destruction that is occurring through EHTH’s pursuit of growth at all costs. 


Page 13 of 15
EHTH management has repeatedly had move the goalposts regarding when it expects to generate 
positive operating cash flow: 
 


• In March 2018, Dave Francis said that he expected the Medicare business to become cash 
flow positive “certainly by 2019”.  2019 company operating cash flow was in fact 
negative. 


 
• In February 2019, CFO Derek Yung gave 2019 cash used in operations guidance of -$17 


million to -$20 million.  The operating cash burn turned out to be -$71.5 million. 
 


• In February 2019, Mr. Yung also said that management was “targeting” positive OCF for 
2020.  Only one year later, in February 2020, Mr. Yung said that management expects 
2020 cash used in operations to be -$52 million to -$55 million.   
 


Apologists for the company might justify this inability to reach OCF breakeven as a sign of 
growth.  Our response is that the company is prodigiously incinerating cash to grow, and

This adjustment assumes that EHTH may apply ASC 606 as it does, which is a proposition with 
which we wholly disagree.  Regardless, we start with a lower LTV for 2019 MA enrollees of 
$728.  Multiplying the LTV difference by 404,694 2019 MA Estimated Members yields a 
revenue haircut of $115 million from MA alone.  Overstated receivables computed similarly 
across the remainder of the business bring total revenue inflation to $128 million.

EHTH’s overstatement of future commissions booked as upfront revenue by approximately $128 
million, detailed above, means that sales are exaggerated by 33.8%.  Meanwhile, after stripping 
out the inflated commissions and adjusting for ongoing costs of approximately $135 million, the 
company’s operating profit swings to a deep loss, reflecting a lossmaking underlying business

We View EHTH as Little More than a Stock Promotion 
 
It is telling that when Mr. Flanders, who had no prior operational experience in healthcare, 
accepted the CEO job, he brought in an equity analyst as his number two, soon thereafter making 
him the COO.20  We found no information to suggest that Dave Francis has an expertise in 
operating call centers, marketing to consumers, or U.S. government relations.  As an equity 
analyst, however, he presumably knows how to “tell a story”.  That story became “We’re the 
Expedia / Zillow of health insurance”, and when paired with an accounting standard that 
practically begs for aggressive assumptions and a growth at all costs approach, the stock has 
ripped on the back of fantasy revenue and earnings.  Given that EHTH is already changing its 
model to ensure 2017 stays relevant, we wonder how long management can keep this charade up 
– particularly when consistently burning cash.  Recent selling by insiders, especially Mr. 
Flanders (who sold 15% of his stake in January 2020 alone), makes that question all the more 
pressing.
