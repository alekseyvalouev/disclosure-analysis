GeoInvesting Publishes Evidence On L&L Energy: Canaries In
LuoZhou And LaShu Coalmines
Apr. 8, 2014 9:49 AM ET11 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


Today’s report, the first in our new “In the Public Interest” series, begins to unveil the
evidence supporting our 9/19/2013 LLEN report that we privately shared with
regulators last Fall.


In this part, "Canaries in the Coalmines," we show, through recorded interviews of
mine employees and managers, LLEN fabricated the production of coal from its
LuoZhou and LaShu mines.


The circumstances leading to the indictment and arrest of CEO Dickson Lee barely
scratch the surface of LLEN’s massive fraud.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Our new series of reports will likely be the closest investors will ever come to knowing the
truth about L&L Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN).


In today's report, Part One, GeoInvesting begins publication of the extensive evidence
supporting our September 19, 2013 report focusing first on the LuoZhou and LaShu
coalmines. The public has never seen this evidence. We shared the evidence with the
SEC and NASDAQ over six months ago in order to give the securities regulators time to
conduct their own investigations. The evidence not only supports our finding that LLEN
has misrepresented its ownership in the LuoZhou and LaShu mines, but also proves that
LLEN fabricated the production from these two mines to inflate its financials.


In addition to meeting NASDAQ and SEC investigators, we also met with and shared this
evidence with Mr. Mark Bartlett, the former independent legal counsel of the Special
Independent Committee ("SIC") for LLEN. Mr. Bartlett is a partner at Davis Wright
Tremaine LLP, an international law firm headquartered in Seattle, WA. He assists
businesses and individuals facing criminal and civil government enforcement proceedings
and investigations, focusing on criminal defense, internal investigations, federal antitrust,
heath care, and False Claims Act actions.

On March 17, 2014 just prior to filing its most recent 10Q, LLEN's SIC suddenly and for no
apparent reason replaced Mr. Bartlett just six months into his investigation and appointed
Mr. Nicholas Chen, managing partner at Pamir Law Group, a small Taiwanese firm with
seemingly no obvious experience in conducting such investigations.


This abrupt and inexplicable move follows on the heels of the resignation of the former
head of LLEN's SIC, Independent Director Mr. Mohan Datwani. Mr. Datwani was replaced
with Jingcai Yang, a China-based Independent Director of LLEN.


While Mr. Bartlett did not comment on the circumstances of his dismissal, Mr. Datwani
wrote that the reasons for his resignation were:


1. LLEN had not kept him fully informed "…as to the degree and extent of ongoing
government regulatory investigations…" and


2. LLEN "… did not provide adequate financial support to complete the Committee's
work…"


Considering the severity of Mr. Datwani's concerns, one can imagine that he would hardly
be surprised by the arrest of Dickson Lee and the replacement of Mr. Bartlett.


So for those keeping score here:


Two highly respected gatekeepers in charge of protecting U.S. investors from the actions
of Dickson Lee have been replaced by two China/Taiwan-based gatekeepers who have
little or no ultimate accountability to U.S. shareholders and regulators.


Background


In October of 2013, GeoInvesting met NASDAQ OMX Group to provide very conclusive
evidence of a massive investment fraud being conducted by LLEN. We made it clear to
NASDAQ that we would not publish our evidence until NASDAQ could complete its own
investigation to verify our findings. Six months have passed, giving NASDAQ ample time
to conduct its investigation. While we have no insight into the current status of NASDAQ's
prolonged investigation, we decided that in the public's interest we would begin publishing
our evidence in parts, beginning with LLEN's LuoZhou and LaShu coalmine
misrepresentations.


Aside from interruptions, LLEN claims its LuoZhou and LaShu coalmines have been
producing at or near full capacity since late 2012. In fact, in LLEN's fiscal Q4 2013
conference call held on July 31, 2013, VP Clayton Fong claimed that the LuoZhou and
LaShu mines

…were able to ramp up their production ahead of our internal scheduling, adding
167,000 tons to the company's mining segment in just a little over five months…


Unfortunately for investors, LLEN's production claims for these two mines are just another
fabrication by Dickson Lee as evidenced by our discussions with mine employees and
managers.


Through our interviews of employees and managers of the Luozhou and Lashu mines, we
learned that neither of the mines had commenced commercial coal production as LLEN
claimed in its public filings and conference calls. The LuoZhou mine was not scheduled to
commence production until at least December 2013. The LaShu mine was scheduled to
commence production in August 2013. The findings from our multiple on-site recorded
interviews are further supported by information in a local PRC newspaper article published
after our original report.


LLEN's claim in its most recent 10Q that the LuoZhou mine was shut down from
November 6, 2013 to March 2014 "…due to a geological fault found beneath the mine
shaft" in reality only further extended the date that the mine is scheduled to finally
commence commercial production. This convenient "shutdown" of a mine that was never
open in the first place, occurring during the period of time when Mr. Bartlett was still in
charge of the independent investigation, is simply in our view another obvious attempt by
Dickson Lee to hide the truth.


The bottom line is that the interviews we share today conclusively show that LLEN simply
fabricated the hundreds of thousands of tons of coal reportedly produced by the LuoZhou
and LaShu mines following their purported 2012 acquisition.


LuoZhou Mine Investigation Interviews Expose the Truth


If anyone wants to determine whether a coalmine is producing, undoubtedly the easiest
way is to simply try to buy some coal. Our investigators visited the LuoZhou mine in June
2013, asking basic questions about the mine's production activity and then posing as
buyers from a local paper mill seeking coal for its boilers. Both the employees and the
general manager on site at the LuoZhou mine unequivocally informed us that coal sales
were impossible, because the LuoZhou mine would not commence commercial production
until the end of 2013, citing various reasons for the delay.


Below we present links to our video-recorded interviews (along with detailed transcripts) of
the employees and General Manager. Beneath the links are summaries of the key points
of the interviews (as well as identification of any inconsistencies in the responses):

Development coal samples will not reflect the true quality of the coal LuoZhou can
potentially produce in the future
Development coal is not even being produced at the time of the interview
The production situation at Weishe Mine is similar to LuoZhou Mine, but Weishe Mine
may start production sooner. [Contradicted by the LaShu Mine manager, who claimed
the Weishe Mine had commenced production in the second half of 2012]
LuoZhou and LaShu mines have no cooperation with LLEN
LaShu Mine will start production sooner than LuoZhou Mine
LaShu Mine needs more tunneling work and may end up producing a little
Prior to officially starting production, LuoZhou Mine is estimated to possibly have
several hundred tons of production each month. LaShu should produce some too
Union Energy had planned to commence production at the LuoZhou Mine in August
(2013)
Production was delayed due to geological reasons that Union Energy is working to
resolve and doing coal exploration work and tunneling work. [Note LLEN's most recent
10Q disclosure regarding a geological fault delaying production at the LuoZhou mine
until March 2014]
LuoZhou Mine only just recently obtained its 150,000-ton annual production permit that
it started applying for at the end of 2012


On November 14, 2013, a local newspaper in China, National Business Daily, also
confirmed that LuoZhou Mine did not have any substantial production activities as follows:


Reporters also conducted an investigation on LuoZhou Mine that the Group claimed
to be still in operation. However, reporters failed to see any coal conveyors [trucks]
along the road to the Mine. Besides, after a landslide near the mine, an emergency
road that is not accessible for large coal conveyors is the only passageway to the
Mine. The factory seems very quiet and machines are idled.


Mr. Qing, Head of Logistics Department of LuoZhou Mine told reporters LuoZhou
Mine was called to stop its production by the enterprise in September and most
workers have left the mine. But Mr. Qing didn't have any knowledge about the
specific reason for production halt. (See entire article)


LaShu Mine Investigation Interviews Further Expose the Truth


Just as we had done with the LouZhou mine, on June 20, 2013, investigators visited the
LaShu mine, once again pretending to be interested in buying coal. They interviewed
employees and a manager, who explained that the LaShu mine was currently only

producing development coal and was scheduled to commence commercial production in
August (2013).


Below we present links to our video-recorded interviews (along with detailed transcripts) of
the employees and manager. Beneath the links are summaries of the key points of the
responses:


June 20, 2013


LaShu Mine Employees and Manager (See video; See transcript)


The LaShu Mine is currently producing development coal and has not yet started
official production
The Weishe Mine is producing and LuoZhou Mine has some production
The LaShu Mine should start normal production in August (2013)
The Weishe Mine finished getting approvals last year and has been producing for
several months.
The volume of development coal produced by the LaShu Mine is not big
The LuoZhou Mine should have stopped production and has been idled for more than
a month
About 100 workers were transferred from LuoZhou to rush the work at LaShu.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2131033-geoinvesting-publishes-evidence-on-l-and-l-energy-canaries-in-luozhou-and-lashu-coalmines 9/13


LaShu, LuoZhou, and WeiShe are all owned by Union Energy
LLEN is a shareholder in Union Energy Group
Union Energy controls all the sales process and signs all the sales contracts
LLEN has no equity at the mines level. It is invested in Union Energy but not in the
mines
Union Energy has 90% equity in LaShu Mine. The remaining 10% is still owned by the
original shareholders
LLEN has not right to sell coal. It is useless to sign a sales contract with LLEN.
All the operations are directly managed by Union Energy
Weishe Mine started production in the second half of last year


The few remaining Dickson Lee supporters who believe that these LuoZhou and LaShu
mine managers are "confused" or somehow did not receive LLEN's 95% ownership
change memo should carefully consider Clayton Fong's comments on the fiscal 2014
year-end conference call in which he claimed there was an extremely smooth integration
of the mine management since LLEN had actually assigned staff to each mine a few
months prior to the closing of each acquisition.


Any investigator (NASDAQ, SEC, or Mark Bartlett) who took the time to approach the
mine employees as we did, posing as potential buyers of coal, would certainly obtain
these same results, which conclusively show that neither the LouZhou nor LaShu mines
had yet commenced commercial production of coal in June 2013. The mine managers
have no reason to lie to a potential customer, nor is there any reasonable excuse for them
to be unaware of LLEN's ownership of the mines 8 months after the "acquisition" and
supposed integration that Clayton Fong described on the conference call.


LLEN's reported ownership and production from the LuoZhou and LaShu mines is thus
completely fabricated in our view.


Given recent events, including the resignation of Independent Director Mohan Datwani
(the former head of the SIC), the termination of Mark Bartlett (the legal counsel in charge
of the independent investigation) without publication of his findings, and the criminal
indictment of CEO Dickson Lee, we believe the publication of our evidence is likely the
closest investors will ever come to learning the truth about LLEN.


Indictment and arrest of CEO Dickson Lee barely scratches the surface of LLEN's
massive fraud

In light of the evidence we have already presented concerning LLEN and its CEO,
Dickson Lee, it should come as no surprise to investors that being loose and expedient
with the facts is not new to Lee and the company when making required filings with the
SEC and NASDAQ. On March 27, 2014, two actions were brought against Lee. First, the
Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against LLEN and its
founder for making false disclosures about who was running the company in its 2008
annual report and continued to make false claims in its quarterly filings in 2009. According
to the SEC complaint, the disclosures in question "…created the false appearance that the
company had a professional management team in place when in reality Dickson Lee was
single-handedly controlling the company's operations." Further, Lee and LLEN also "…
allegedly misled NASDAQ to become listed on the exchange by falsely maintaining they
had accurately made all of their required Sarbanes-Oxley certifications." The following is
from the SEC's action:


This action arises out of a fraudulent scheme by L&L Energy and Dickson Lee to
create the appearance that L&L was run by a professional management team
and conceal Lee's single-handed control of the company. L&L Energy is a
Seattle-headquartered coal company with all of its operations in China and Taiwan.
At all relevant times, it was led by Dickson Lee, its current Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer. From approximately August 2008 to June 2009, L&L
and Lee repeatedly and fraudulently misrepresented to the public that it had certain
persons serving in critical executive management roles at the company when, in
reality, those persons served in no such roles."
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/33-9565.pdf


In a parallel action, a criminal indictment against Lee was unsealed in federal court in
Seattle alleging Lee and L&L Energy "…deceived the public by falsely representing that
the company had a CFO, which is a critical gatekeeper in the management of public
companies." Mr. Lee was arrested by Federal prosecutors in Seattle on March 16, 2014
and denied bail after the court agreed with prosecutors that Lee was a "flight risk." Lee's
trial is scheduled for June 2, 2014 in Seattle.

NASDAQ's unnecessarily prolonged trading halt has deprived investors of the right to
decide what is best for them with regard to their current investment in LLEN. NASDAQ's
delay makes little sense given the charges that LLEN mislead NASDAQ in its listing
application, according to paragraph 33 of the criminal indictment of Dickson Lee:
