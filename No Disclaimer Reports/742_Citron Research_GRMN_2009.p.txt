CITRON RESEARCH
REPORTS ON GARMIN
(NASDAQ:GRMN)


Can Garmin navigate their way out of
the dead end they’ve driven into ?


Today marks the day that Nokia is shipping their
�rst navigation based phone in to the US

This announcement prompts us to look deeper into
the future of navigation leader Garmin.  While we’re
reluctant to join a pinata party here, the company’s
own comments at Wednesday’s Barclay’s investors’
conference as delivered by its CFO are particularly
important for any investor, long or short, looking to
establish an opinion on where management is
“driving”.


The Landscape


The rapid pace of change has quickly crushed many
former giants of technology into buggy whip
makers.  Whether it be the Hayes modems or the

Palm Pilots, companies that focused more on their
core products as high margin gadgets, rather than
the functional bene�t of those products to
consumers, have left a trail of lost brands and more
importantly lost pro�ts.  Will Garmin face the same
fate?


2009 was the �rst year of revenue decline in the
history of navigation device maker Garmin. 
Yesterday at the Barclays Technology Conference,
investors were able to get a snapshot of
management’s thoughts….and we have decided it
lies at the crossroads of denial and complicity.

The presentation was made by CFO Kevin
Rauckman.


Mr. Rauckman spent the �rst half of his
presentation discussing their marine and aviation
business and he used the phrase “very di�cult” for
both businesses.  He went on to state that both
boat and airplane production is down globally and
the company hopes for an uptick in the coming
year.  Mr. Rauckman also names the competition by
name in the space.  OK, marine and aviation are
only 14% of the business…..so lets move on.


The presentation turns to the bright part of
Garmin’s business — outdoor �tness.  While this is
only 17% of their revenues, the company has 70%
market share, so the growth is limited….but this too
is a sideshow to the main event.  Note: in the
presentation he also listed the competition in
outdoor �tness by name.


Where the Rubber Hits the Road


Garmin’s core business that comprises close to 70%
of its revenue is automotive/mobile.  This is where
the company is living in denial.  Mr Ruckman
attempts to demonstrate Garmin’s strength in this
category by stating that even though sales are
down quite a bit, they have increased gross and
operating margins, by controlling operating

expenses.    That might work for one or two
quarters but is that how you compete in
technology?  The company admitted to cutting back
advertising and not dropping ASP as the reason the
past year was not a disaster.


When discussing the long term prospects of the
company, we heard the chilling admission:


“Long term gross margins depend on the
success of the Nuvifone” — Kevin
Ruckman.


It is the opinion of Citron that if your long term
margins are dependent on your biggest failure and
your competition is Google and Apple…. it might be
time to re-evaluate.  In yesterdays conference
Garmin admitted to dedicating most of their $160
million in R&D for the year developing what we now
know as the Nuvifone.


Danger! Road Out Ahead


We challenge any reader to �nd a single positive
review of the Nuvifone.  Here is a sampling of what
is out there:


Frank Dickson, vice president of research at
In-Stat: 
“I can’t help but think they’re going to get a
butt-kicking,”

“Straight-up, you’ll be entirely more
productive with an Apple or Google-powered
handset than the G60, and you’ll have a lot
more access to web-based applications and a
web browser that’s actually functional. It may
hurt, but it’s the truth”

“Unfortunately, Garmin spent almost two
years bringing this phone to market, and it
feels like a 2007-era device. At $299 with a
two-year contract after a $100 mail-in rebate,
the nuvifone G60 simply isn’t competitive.”

Oddly enough, even though Mr. Ruckman
listed every competitor in marine, aviation,
and �tness….he couldn’t manage to actually
say the words “Google” and “Apple” which
threaten their core business. It gets worse…
in a recent search Citron has found that
Apple in a job listing has stated  “We want to
take maps to the next level”

The reality, obvious to everyone except
Garmin management and its analysts, is that
smartphones are going to rapidly absorb the
functionality of navigation exactly as they
absorbed the functionality of the PDA from
Palm’s earlier gadgets.


http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec
[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec


Kim of iSuppli says …”By 2011, he says, GPS
navigation will be available in 100% of
smartphones.”


Apple is already selling an iPhone navigation app
from Tom-Tom and others will surely soon follow. 
Meanwhile, Google announced navigation for its
Android platform operating system for
smartphones (such as the new Motorola Droid) at
the compelling pricepoint of “free”.  (Google will of
course monetize this with local advertising
integrated into the map functionality.)

Who’s Driving this Bus ?


Given the obvious, that the personal navigation
device as a standalone gadget is going the way of
the PDA and the standalone modem, couldn’t
management be expected to focus on the
smartphone market as though their company’s life
depended on it?


Perhaps they could have been forgiven for
delivering a terri�c phone to market a few months
late, or a mediocre one with �rst-mover advantage
a year ahead of competition.  But to deliver such an
inept, non-competitive and overpriced product a
year late (even though the phone hardware was
outsourced) is an unforgivable strategic blunder,
and has to call into question whether management
has any credibility to claim they are competent to
compete in the smartphone space at all.


Conclusion


Garmin is now driving like it’s lost — competing
against TomTom, Magellan and other device
makers on the low-end commoditized part of the
business.  Just walk into Best Buy or Costco and see
the price cutting.  With navigation functionality
rapidly moving to smartphones, they have to
compete against Google and Apple on the
innovation side of the business, while Nokia looms
on the commoditization front.


All the while, new navigation phones are being
launched, while they sit with their 2007 Nuvifone
that has been a disappointment to all.  We urge
readers to drop into any AT&T store and ask how
Nuvifone sales are going.


The reality is that two years ago, navigation was the
“killer app”.  But now it’s just “another app”, with a
price point heading rapidly towards “free”.

Realistically, with its strong cash position and
current quarter EPS Garmin is not going to zero any
time soon.  But it is amazing that sell side analysts
are so impressed with the company’s ability to
manage costs and make numbers in the next
quarter with the company’s future so threatened.


Citron asks how long the market will confer a 9x
multiple to Garmin’s future earnings when the
company can’t describe a credible path to
sustainable core earnings even a year or two down
the road from here.
