Logitech and a divergence into days payable outstanding,
Dell, Apple, and macroeconomic conditions in China
Stableboy Selections (a blog I should read more often) provides us with a fairly simple case for
shorting Logitech.  After joking about their domicile (Apples Switzerland) he points out the obvious -
laptops are replacing desktops - pads and phones are replacing both of them.  Logitech sells
peripherals.  The new technology (along with things like Google speak-to-search) will reduce the need
for peripherals.  Peripheral sales should fall year-in-year-out - they have done so at Logitech. 
 
Eventually this suggests Logitech will look like Radio Shack - a company that got rich selling cables
for your computer and TV and eventually shrunk into (near) oblivion.  The first of two bottoms (in the
stock at least) was marked by The Onion doing a mock interview where the CEO could not figure out
why they were still in business. 
 
If the desktop is doomed so are its peripherals - and along with my absurd collection of cables
(firewire anyone) I now have a collection of mice, keyboards, video-cams and the like.  My shop is my
attic.  
 
Given Logitech trades at a trailing PE of 22 it looks like an attractive valuation-business obsolescence
short.  
 
Alas if this business were as easy as ripping off other people’s ideas we would all be rich.  So I went
to work reading Logitech’s accounts.  There are some upsides - first and foremost is Google TV (“the
most important product launch in our history”).  I am not sure Google TV is getting much traction (but
they have a really complex remote control to sell and even that will become another Android app).
 More notably they had a really good quarter - enough of a good quarter that it spelled "turnaround".
 Just as The Onion marked a bottom in Radioshack I was worried that Stableboy would mark a (the?)
bottom in Logitech. 
 
I just could not work out why peripherals would have a good quarter.  And if it was a good quarter I
could not figure any reason why sales should start motoring upward.  The trend towards lower
peripherals sales plain - and the company's contrary prediction is strange.  However the company
does predict turnaround. 
 
My first reaction was that the company was channel-stuffing.  (Increasing the speed at which you
deliver to just-in-time retail can produce sharply rising sales at the expense of annoying your
customers and sharply falling sales next quarter.)  Channel-stuffing would have been a great short
thesis (and Stableboy hints at it) but it does not look supported by the data.  Days receivable rose -
but only in proportion to sales.   (They rose from $260 to $305 million - both 47 days.)  
 
Inventory turns dropped (why I do not understand).  But what really jumped out at me was that
payables rose to 90 days from 71 days.  This company was not paying its suppliers.  Ninety days
outstanding almost destroyed David's Holdings (as per my last blog post).  Its a pretty big tell - or so it
seems to someone who is used to the 35 days of retailers. 
 
But alas 90 days is not so startling.  Apple is at 80 days at the end of year (and has been higher).
 Dell is at 81.  And the disease is widespread - for instance the Japanese optical companies (Canon,
Nikon) are at 80-90 days.  
 
Dell is particularly instructive.  The company collects its cash in advance from customers and runs on
negative working capital.  The business has always been funded by borrowing from suppliers.  Its just
that the scale of the loan has increased with monotonous regularity.  Days payable outstanding was
56.1 days a decade ago - then 66.9, 69.4, 71.3, 73.4, 74.8, 77.1, 80.1, 71.8 and 81.2 days.  Dell just
screws its suppliers a little bit more every year.  It shows more cash generation than is real.  It makes
itself look better than it actually is. 
 
Dell however is a declining business.  Apple which is clearly not declining does it too.

Ultimately this is bad business practice.  It stresses suppliers - it costs them money chasing you up.  It
builds distrust.  Yet Apple does it - and the reason is obvious.  Because it can.  Apple has power and it
is not afraid to (ab)use that power. 
 
By contrast Cisco (a company which tries to keep its supply chain sweet after an infamous supply
chain stuff up)  is under 20 days.  
 
Macroeconomic conditions in China 
 
This leads me to the real point of this post.  The macroeconomic conditions in China are changing
dramatically.  Labor shortages are a serious problem.  We are beginning to see press stories about
difficulties in getting things produced and companies bringing production back to the USA.  What this
presages is a change in power between the Western giants and their Chinese manufacturers.  Apple
behaves badly because it can - but that power probably does not exist in the long run for Dell or
Logitech and the loans that these companies have taken from their suppliers (loans that are a
meaningful part of their cash balance in some cases) are going to have to be repaid. 
 
It is logical when you think about it.  Inflation in the US is 1 percent plus or minus 2 percent.  Its
probably over 10 percent in China.  Slow payment thus benefits the Americans relatively little but
costs the Chinese counterpart a lot.  Chinese inflation and labor shortages should cause supply
chains to speed up. 
 
Cisco, Samsung and other companies that have kept the supply chain sweet should be fine.  Apple
should be fine too - its bills to suppliers are trivial compared to cash balances or profits.  
 
But hey - we did short some Logitech.  It really is not so good for them.  90 days really is a problem -
even if they don't know it yet.  Their business practice stinks and it will come back and bite them.  And
it will bite many other companies too.
