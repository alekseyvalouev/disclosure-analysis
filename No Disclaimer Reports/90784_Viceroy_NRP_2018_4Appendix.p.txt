Strong strategic positioning
oriented towards
fang-term growth


The Group's strategy is based on a sustainable business
model which combines the high-Quality of assets with the
success of the tenants and prudent financial management,
enabling the Group to deliver sustainable Income growth
over the long-term.


INVESTMENT APPROACH
The Group is committed to invest selectively in assets that
meet its rigorous investment criteria. Retail assets must
be or have the potential to be dominant. Size is critical
to achieve comprehensive offering and an optimum
tenant mix, including large proportion of food and fashion
anchors with a substantial leisure and entertainment area.
Good location, access, visibility, deSign and technical
specifications, and potential for extension reduce the
threat of significant future competition.
Professional active management of such properties
creates significant and valuable growth opportunities


The Group pursues low-risk development, redevelopment
and extension opportunities, in a non-speculative phased
manner. Construction costs are committed to on a grndual
basis, following the achievement of pre-leasing targets
and are limited to the availability of internal sources of
financing.


The Group also owns and manages an office portfolio:
office buildings are located in large cities, in central
locations, and have excellent access to public
transportation, up-to-date technical specifications,
large floor areas, high efficiency rIItes and high parking
ratios. The Company has pursued office acquisitions and
developments on rare occasions, and the proportion of
offices, as a percentage of total assets, Is expected to
further decrease.


OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
The Group's strong corporate culture is focused on
planning, Quality of execution, sustainablllty, ethics lind
early risk assessment.


The Group has In-house expertise in all key functions,
combining investment, development. asset and property
management, leasing, accounting and finance skills, in an
integrated approach.


Outstanding knowledge and expertise in the CEE retail
markets Is illustrated by best-in-class Indicators, such as
conSistently high collection and occupancy rates, low
occupancy cost for tenants, increase in tenant sales and
footfall and strong organic growth despite operating
In low inflation environments. Preventive maintenance
decreases long-term capital expenditure, service charge
levels and non-re<;overable expenses.


With a broad platform across six CEE countries and over
270 million visits, the Group Is focused on building strong,
trust-based relationships with leading retailers across
CEE, sharing both a long-term vision and the capacity for
Innovation.


PRUDENT FINANCIAL STRATEGY


The debt strategy focuses on a targeted 35% Ioan-to-
value (LTV), maintaining high Interest coverage ratios and
dIversifying financing sourcos to optimise cost of debt.
Debt funding Is biased towards group-level unsecured
bonds and revolving facilities, adding secured bank debt
only when It decreases the overall cost of funding. As at 31
December 201"/, the LTV ratio was 28%.
The Investment-grilde credit ratings (currently limited by
Romania's sovereign rating) are expected to Improve as
the portfolio Is further diversified.


The Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile
whl::h Includes Cash accounts and deposits held with
investment-grade banks, and significant committed
unsecured revolving facilities (€380 million at
31 December 2017).

APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY


The first two pillars of the Group's sustainabillty
strategy. SUstainable resource management and
Sustaln.blHty through "green buildings". are planned
to be developed further based on two complementary
frameworks of policies. processes and procedures based
on Intemational Management Systems Standards (ISO
14001 - Environment Management System and ISO 50001
- Energy Management System). aimed at reducing the
negative Impact of assets at every stage In their Ilfecycle,
from design and build. and throughout daily operations.
The Group is preparing to obtain these two certifications,
targeting 2022 as certification year.


The Group is already compliant with the major
requirements of the Environmental Management System
during the development stage, in order to ensure the
design and construction of properties promote efficiency
and lowest level of negative environmental impact. Some
of the processes covered are:


assessing sustainabillty and climate change risks,
during the due diligence process;
challenging each construction project based on the
"Design Guidelines" described below, in order to
ensure that the buildings will be sustainable and in
preparation for "SREEAM in use" certification; and
applying formal testing procedures to each new
building, to ensure that operational requirements
are met, systems perform as Intended, maintenance
suppliers and management staff are trained.


The "Design Guidelines" applied for new developments.
redevelopments and extensions are aligned with
"BREEAM" requirements, to ensure that properties will
be sustainable from multiple points of view, Including
low energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions.
The Group's development processes give special
attention to:


structural elements that can affect energy
requirements and carbon footprint;
maximizing daytime light use while minimizing solar
heat gains through shading, glass specifications, thus
minimizing the use of air conditioning and energy
consumption; and
implementing proficient building management
systems, which monitor and optimise technical
equipment operation.


The Group's approach to $ustainablllty covers four stages:
setting targets on an annual basis, for each managed
asset, in line with long and medium term KPls;


tc Nt! ~RO~ERTV COOPERATIEF u/l. - ANNUAL REPO~T 201?


implementing action plans to reach those targets;
measuring performance and implementing additional
measures if and when necessary;
reviewing periodic performance for each managed
asset with the purpose to set new targets for the
following period,


Taking into account that several hundred million visitors
and employees enter the Group's buildings every year,
management is committed to ensure a safe and healthy
environment for everyone, therefore It has Implemented a
number of safeguards for this purpose including but not
limited to the below:


cleaning providers are heavily encouraged to use
certified products, favored not to harm health, and
the Group continues to monitor the implementation
of this project throughout the Group. Products used
in the Group's properties are aimed at meeting the
requirements of Green Seal or Environmental Choice
programs or European Eco-Label programs;
the use of good-quality materials with low emissions
of volatile organic compounds and with low content
of harmful substances; technical specifications are
considered for a large range of products: finishing
materials, paints, adhesives, floor coverings, carpets
and other largely utilised products;


" ventilation ducts and filters are checked regularly and
filter replacement Is carried out at least twice a year,
while the risk of legionella disease is controlled by
undertaking regular tests;
ensuring that sufficient fresh air is constantly
available in the Group's buildings through the
Building Monitoring Systems; and
the use of integrated methods based on monitoring
and non-toxic preventive measures (site inspecnon,
pest inspection and population monitoring), to
proactively manage and minimise pest Issues.


Investing in sustainable solutions has become a priority,
therefore, starting in 2016, more than 30% the CAPEX
property management budget ot Romanian properties
was allocated to replaCing traditional lighting with LED
technology, Installing frequency converters, upgrading
building management systems, Installing water-efficient
faucets, replacing obsolete roof membranes, Investing In
cooling water towers, mounting solar protection foil and
growing natural Indoor plants. Going forward, the Group
plans to Implement similar allocations in other countries,
building on the success of this original project.

WASTE
MANAGEMENT


The Group
designed an
integrated waste
management
system to
be applied
across Its core
portfolio. leading
to increased
selective waste
collection rate and
minimizing landfill.
There Is a rigorous
approach towards waste
management, oy setting
following priorities: dlmlnlsh
waste to the extent possible.
reuse, recycle, recovery
strictly following the a[)OIiI~ab,k!
provisions.


In 2017, the Group continued to implement its waste
reduction strategy across Its properties in Romania
as an early adopter, and efforts will continue in 2018
and onwards. Waste management audits have been
conducted in II number of properties and measures have
been Implemented based on the findings of these audits
in order to improve performance, such as: Informing
the tenants regularly about on-site waste management,
implementation of minimal requirements for sorting and
recycling waste in supplier and lease contracts,


As part of this initiative, the Group also aims to increase
applicable sorting solutions, in order to Increase the
proportion of waste ~orted on-site and thereby reduce
overall waste management proceSSing costs.


Through the measures implemented, the Group managed
to lower total waste, as well as to increase significantly the
recycling percentage in more than 12 properties.


The Group understands the Importance of recycling and
reusing and thus has planned to reach a 50% recycling
rate across the portfolio by 2022 by virtue of sustainable
waste management measures.


WATER EFFICIENCY


The Group's approach towards the use of water focuses
on ensuring that the supply Is of the highest quality, that
water Is reused whenever possible, and that consumption
Is minimised. Potable water purity is of prevailing
importance, therefore. although supplied by the municipal
network. the water Is further cleansed using on-site


mechanical filters.

take steps towards minimisation of the performance gap
between predicted and actual consumptlor., through
efficient cost management and identification of areas of
inefficient operation, system deficiencies and building
management issues.


The Group believes that taking actions such as changing
practices and procedures. reducing waste and managing
energy use it can decrease operating costs, consumption
and carbon emissions. Through detailed metering and
monitoring, owners and facility managers understand how
their building is performing In greater detail and can take
steps to improve such performance.


All new developments give priority to natural lighting,
while low-energy bulbs, combined with light sensors,
are used wherever practical. The buildings' skylights

air conditioning. Our escalators are fitted with motion
sensors and stop automatically when not In use, while
developments with multiple elevators use computerised
systems to monitor commands and optimise movement.


One of the Initiatives of the Group, aimed at reduclne
energy consumption, is the gradual implementation of
LED technology, as well as Investing In renewable sources
of energy.


CARBON FOOTPRINT


The Group recognises the challenges raised by global
warming and climate change. therefore It plans to
contribute to a greener environment by reducing the
carbon footprint of Its buildings during both construction
and operation. As such, the Group plans a long-term
commitment to reduce its carbon footprint by 20" by

Independence
We are independent ofNE Property CooperatiefU.A. in accordance with the European Regulation on
specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities, the 'Wet toezicbt
accountaDtsorganisaties'(Wta, Audit finns supervision act), the 'Verordening lnzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdracbten· (ViO - Code of Bthics for Professional
Accountants. a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence
requirements in the Netherlands. Furtbennore. we have eompUed with the 'Verordening gedrags- en
beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA - Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with
respect to rules of professional conduct).


Our audit aPPJ·oacl.
Overview and context
NE Property Co6peratiefU.A.'s activities are developing. operating and maiJaging investment property
to earn rental income, capital appreciation or both. The investment property is located in Central and
Eastern Europe, maiuly io Romania. NE Property CooperatiefU.A. is mainly financed by
intercompany borrowings provided by Nepiom Limited, a group company of the ultimate parent
NEPI Rockcastle ple, and debt instruments issued 00 the Irish Stock &cl1Jlngp,. 1'htt uonp is
comprised of several components and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as
set out inthe section 'The scope of our group audit'. We paid speclfic attention to the areas of focus
driven by the operations of the Group, a8 set out below.


As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
misstatement in the financial statements. Inparticular, we considered where the board of directors
made importantjudgementsj for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
makins assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. Indisclosnre note 4
of the financial statements the company descn'bes the areas of judgment in applying aoeounting
policies and the by sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty in
the valuation of investment properties. we considered this to be a key audit matter as set out in the
section 'Key audit matters' of this report.


Other areas of focus, that were not considered to be key audit matters were the purchases and sales of
investment properties, accurate and complete accounting of rental income, compliance with bank
covenants, the income tax position and the recoverability of intercompany receivables. A. in an of our
audits, we also addressed the risk of I!1l1llqement override of internal controls, including evaluating
whether there was evidence of bias by the board of directors that may represent a risk of material
nrl8~b9nentduetoftau~


We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels Included the appropriate skills
and competences which are needed for the audit of a real estate company. We therefore included
specialists in the areas of IT and real estate valuation experts and tax experts inOUY team.

fl.latf!Mulity
• Overall materiality: € 29.1million which represents 1" of total assets.


Audit scope
• A full scope audit bas been perfonned on the most financially significant


components Inthe Group, while other large components were subject to an
audit over certain aecount balances, based on our asaessment of the risk and
materiality of the Group's operations at each component.


Key audit matters
• Valuation of investment properties


.:.\1(lteriality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the
sec:tioo 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.


Based on our pr0fe8sionaljudgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall materiality for the financial8tatements ali a whole as set out in the table below.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent
of our audit procedures on the individualfinanclal statement line items and disclosures and to
evaluate the effect of identified misstatements. both individually and in aggregate, on the financial
statements as a whole and on our opinion.

financial statements. On this basis, we believe that this benchmark is an Important
metric for the fiuanclal performance of the company.


Component
materiality


To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate
materiality that Is less than our overall I!DllP materiality.


We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are
material for qualitative reasons.


We agreed with the board of directors that we would report to them misstatements identified during
our audit above (;lA53,OOO (2016: (;1,130,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in
our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Tile scope of our group audit
NE Property Coijperatief U.A. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial Information
of this group is included in the consolidated financlalstatements ofNE Property CoOperatief U.A.


We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the
Group. the aeconnting processes and controls, lind the industry inwhich the Group operates.
The Group 0WlUI and invests ina number of investment properties focussed on Central and Eastern
Burope. These are held within a variety of subsidiaries and joint ventures. Inestablishing the overa1l
group audit strategy and plan. we determined the type of work required to be performed at the
component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.


Based on our undemanding of the Group we focused our audit work primarily on the most financially
significant components, wbich represent mainly large shopping centres and retail parks in Romania,
Croatia, Slovakia and Bulgaria. 1bese WBl'e subject to a full scope audit given their financial
significance to the Group. Other large components were subject to an audit over certain account
balances (Including investment property), based on our assessment of risk and materiality of the
Group's operations at each component. For those remaining components we performed. among other
things. analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of
material misstatements within those components.


In establishing the overall approach to the group audit. we determined the type of work that needed to
be performed by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network
firms or other networb operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at
those compODents to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been
obtained as a basis {or our opinion OD the financial statements as a whole.


By performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group
level. we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial
information, 88 a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion OD the financlalstatements.


Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that. in our professional judgement, were of most aignificance in
the audit of the financlalltatementB. We have communicated the key audit matters to the board of
directOI'B. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of aJl matters that were identified
by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included •
summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.

and in funning our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on
specifie elementa of the financial statements. Any comments or observations we make on the results of

Standards as endorsed oy European Union (IFRS). The accounting policies set out below have been
consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.


3.1. Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (C, EUR) thousands unless otherwise
stated, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency is determined by the relevant, primary economic environment of each
entity. One determining factor is the currency in which the majority of cash flows, goods and
services are denominated and settled in the respective country. When the functional currency
cannot be clearly identified, International Accounting Standard (lAS) 21 allows management to use
judgement to determine the functional currency that most faithfully represents the economic
effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions. Any change in the functional currency
must be made prospectively in accordance with lAS 21.


3.2. Basi8ofpreparation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for
investment property in use, land for investment property under development, financial investments
at fair value through profit or loss, interest rate derivatives and financial assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss, which are measured at fair value.


Management prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. There are no
uncertainties relating to events and conditions that cast a significant doubt upon the Group's ability
to continue as a going concern.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and associated assumptions, are based on
experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and enable
judgements to be made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period when the estimate is revised and future periods if applicable.


3.3. Statementof compliance
The financial statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with IFRS and its
interpretations adopted by European Union (EU).


8
3.4- Basis of consolidation


Subsidiaries
The financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the
Company and its subsidiaries.


Subsidiaries are all entities, including those that are structured, over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over it.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group. They are
deconsolidated from the date control ceases. The acquisition method is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries. Identifiable acquired assets and liabilities, and contingent liabilities,
assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values on the date of acquisition. The
consideration transferred for the acquired entity is measured at the fair value of the assets given up,
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred, or assumed, Including fair value of assets or
liabilities from contingent consideration arrangements, but excluding acquisition related costs,
such 88 advisory, legal, valuation and similar professional services.


The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those of the Company.
In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less
accumulated impairment losses.


Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are
eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements.


Jomtly controlled entities
The Group has contractual arrangements with other parties that represent joint-ventures. These
take the form of agreements to jointly control other entities.


The Group accounts for its investments in joint-ventures using the equity method. Under the equity
method, the initial recognition of an investment in a joint-venture is at cost: the carrying amount is
subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of profit or loss of the joint-
venture. Distributions received from a joint-venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
The Group classifies its investment in joint-ventures as a non-current asset, and recognises its
share of the joint-ventures' net result in the Statement of comprehensive income.


9
3.5. InvCliJtJnentproperty in use
Investment properties are held to eam rental income, capital appreciation or both.
The COBt of investment property acquired by any other means than a business combination consists
of the purchase price and directly attributable expenditure. Subsequent expenditure relating to
investment property is capitalised when future economic benefits from the use of the asset are
probable and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditure is
recognised as an expense during the period it is incurred.


After initial recognition, investment properties in use are measured at fair value. Fair value is
detennined semi-annually by external, independent professional valuers, with appropriate and
recognised qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of property being
valued. Valuations are based on the open market value, using either the discounted cash flow
method, the capitalisation of net income method or a combination of both. Gains or losses arising
from changes in the fair values are included in the Statement of comprehensive income for the
period during which they arise.


Gains or losses on disposal of investment property are calculated as proceeds less carrying amount.
Where the Group disposes of an investment property in use, the carrying value, immediately prior
to the sale, is adjusted to the transaction price. The adjustment is recorded in the Statement of
comprehensive income for the year within fair value adjustments of investment property.


3.6. Investment property under development
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property is classified
as investment property under development and carried at cost until construction or development is
complete, or its fair value can be reliably determined.


The land on which investment property is constructed or developed is carried at fair value, which is
determined semi-annually by external, independent professional valuers, with appropriate and
recognised qualliications and recent experience in the iocation and category of property being
valued. Valuations are done using the market comparable approach or residual approach.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the Statement of
comprehensive income during the period when they arise.


10
3.7. Investment property held for sale
Investment property is classified as an asset held for sale if the majority of its carrying amount will
be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. For this to apply, the property
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual
and customary for sales of such property and its sale must be highly probable. The sale will be
considered bighly probable if the following criteria are met:


- the Board must be committed to a plan to sell the property and an active programme to locate a
buyer and complete the sale must be initiated;


- the property must be actively marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair
value, and


- the sale of property should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one
year of the date of classification.


On classification 8S held for sale, investment property that is measured at fair value continues to be
so measured.


3.8. Goodwill
Goodwill arises on acquisition of subsidiaries that constitute a business. Goodwill represents the
amount paid in excess of the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of the acquired entity. When the excess is negative {bargain purchase} it is recognised
directly in the Statement of comprehensive income.


Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment at least annually.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses. For
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the date of
acquisition, allocated to each ofthe Group's cash generating units (CGU) that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of
the acquired entity are assigned to those units.


The cash generating units are defined at the level of each individual property acquired through
business combinations. The carrying amount of the cash generating unit includes the investment
property, goodwill and the related deferred tax liability. Impairment testing is performed using the
fair value less costs to sell approach where the fair value is the property value as determined in the
external valuation reports. If this method results in impairment, then management compares the
carrying amount of the CGU containing goodwill with its value in use to detennine if this method
generates a more favourable result


The fair value disclosures presented in Note 9 Investment property in use are also relevant (or
goodwill impairment testing.


11
3.9. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are initially recognised at acquisition cost,
carried at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization and accumulated
impairment losses. and tested for impairment when indicators exist.


For property, plant and equipment the costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed when
incurred while gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the
carrying amount. Both are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income for the year.
The cost of computer licences and property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the length of their useful lives:


Usefulllyes in years


Computer licences


Office improvements


Office equipment


Equipment used in owner-managed activities


1-3


over the term of the underlying lease


2-16


3-22


3.10. Borrowings (bonds and bank loans)
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the liability (determined using the prevailing
market rate of interest if significantly different from the transaction price) and net of transaction
costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Any difference between the fair value of the borrowing at initial recognition and
the proceeds received is recognised in accordance with the substance of the transaction: to equity, if
the premium or discount at initial recognition effectively represents a capital transaction with the
Group's owners, or in the Statement of comprehensive income, within finance activity.


Foreign currency translation differences are recognised as foreign exchange differences within
finance income or finance costs.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
qualifying assets, such as properties developed for future sale, capital appreciation or rental
income, are capitalised as part of the cost of these assets. The capitalisation of borrowing costs
ceases when the majority of the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended
use or sale are complete.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.


12
The Group derecognises its financial liability (or part of a financial liability) from its Statement of
financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished. This occurs when the obligation
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. An exchange between the Group and a
lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment
of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a
substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability, or a part of it, is accounted fur
as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial
liability.


If the Group repurchases a part of a financial liability, it allocates the previous carrying amount of
the financial liability between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is
derecognised based on the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the repurchase. The
difference between the canying amount allocated to the part derecognised and the consideration
paid for the part derecognised, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.


3.U Tenant security deposits
Tenant security deposits represent financia1 advances made by lessees as guarantees during the
lease and arc repayable/settled by the Group upon termination of contracts. Tenant security
deposits are recognised at nominal value.


3.12 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are initially recognized when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and include trade and
other receivables, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments, loans granted to joint
ventures and loans granted by the Company to its subsidiaries. The Group enters into a variety of
derivative financial instruments to gain exposure mainly to property securities, via equity swaps
and hedge its interest rate risk arising from financing activities, via interest rate swaps or caps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract Is entered into and
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative, with the resulting gain or loss recognised
in profit or loss immediately. The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount that the group
would receive or pay to tenninate the derivative at the reporting date, taking into account factors
such as current interest rates, exchange rates and fundamentals of the underlying asset.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current on the basis of their maturity date.


13
3.12.1 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value, which include directly attnbutable
transaction costs. In the case of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, however,
transaction costs are recognised directly in profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial
instruments are measured as follows:

14
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:


The use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments (for financial
assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
Discounted cash flow analysis (for the remaining financial instruments).


The hierarchy for the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is as follows:


Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable, and
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable.


3.12.2 Derecognition


Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is derecognised when:


the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
the Group or Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and
either has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but
has transferred control of the asset.


Flnanclalliabilitics
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. Where an existing liability ts replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the
Statement of comprehensive income.
3.12.3 OffiJet
Financial assets and financialliabiIities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of
financial position when the Group and/or Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the
recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise tbe asset and settle the-
liability simultaneously.


3.13 Impairment of financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if
objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can
be estimated reliably.


The Group considers evidence of impairment for receivables at a specific asset level.
All receivables are individually assessed for impairment.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an
improvement in the debtor's credit rating), tbe previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
by adjusting the allowance account through the Statement of comprehensive income for the year.
Uncollectable assets are written-off against the related impairment loss provision after all the
necessary procedures to recover the asset have been completed and the amount of the loss has been
determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written-ofJ are credited to the
impairment loss account within the Statement of comprehensive income for the year.


3.14 Cash and cash equivalentll
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and cash deposits. Cash and cash equivalents are
carried at amortised mat.


3.15 Share capital and IIharepremium
Share capital is fonned of capital accounts (reserves) for each shareholder of the Company (called
"members"), as required for an entity having the legal form of Cooperative. A member's capital
account is the balance of: payments made pursuant to a contribution agreement, additional
payments made pursuant to a resolution of tbe members for a capital increase, acquisition or
transfer of all or part of the balance of the capital account of another member, withdrawals from the
capital account.


16
3.16 Accumulated profit
The balance on the Statement of comprehensive income is transferred to accumulated profit at the
end of each financial period. Distribution paid in cash are deducted from accumulated profit.


3.17 ]»rovisions
Provisions for liabilities are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. Where
the effect of the time value of money is material the amount of the provision is the present value of
the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.


Provisions are reassessed at each reporting date, and are included in the financial statements at
their net present values using discount rates appropriate to the Group in the economic environment
at each reporting date.


3.18 Revenue
Revenue is recognised when it can be reliably measured and it is probable that the economic
benefits will flow to the Group/Company. Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable. Revenue comprises rental and related income and recovery of
expenses, excluding VAT.


Rental income
Rental income receivable from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the
duration of the lease, except for contingent rental income which is recognised when it arises.


Service charges and expenses recoverable from tenants
Income arising from expenses recharged to tenants is recognised on an accrual basis.
As specified in the lease agreements, the Group has the primary responsibility for providing
services to tenants (electricity, water and gas utilities, interior and exterior cleaning, security,
maintenance, repairs, etc). The Group negotiates directly with the suppliers all contracts for
services provided to tenants. These contracts are concluded between the Group subsidiaries which
own the properties and the direct supplier. As the Group sometimes uses the same providers for
services across most of its portfolio, it can negotiate better prices through the economies of scale.
The Group bears the responsibility of meeting the contractual deadlines agreed in the contracts
with its suppliers and is liable for payment of the services, regardless of whether they arc able to
recover these charges from the tenants. The Group also bears the inventory risk for the necessary
spare parts purchased for the maintenance and repairs required by the tenants. The Group bears
the credit risk for the amounts receivable from tenants. The Group negotiates and pays an expenses
incurred by the tenants and then re-invoices these costs to them as defined in the contractual
clauses included in the lease agreements. A flat fee is charged monthly during the year. This fee is
estimated based on the previous year's actual costs.


17
After the year-end. the annual service charge reconciliation is performed based on actual costs. For
contracts terminated during the year, the Group estimates the service charge to be collected based
on the current budget and last year's actual costs. The Group therefore bears the risk of not
collecting the service charge differences for non-performing tenants. The Group is considered
principal in these transactions. in terms of the lAS 18 requirements.


3.19 Property operating and administrative expenses
Property operating expenses and administrative expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.


3.20 Operating Ieases
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards incidental to ownership from the lessor to the Group. the total lease payments are charged
to the Statement of comprehensive income for the year on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The lease term is the non-canceJlable period for which the lessee has contracted to lease the asset
together with any further terms for which the lessee has the option to continue to lease the asset,
with or without further payment. when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the
lessee will exercise the option.


3.21 Dividend distributed
A distribution is recorded as a liability and deducted from equity in the period in which it is
declared and approved.


3.22 Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax
and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from. or paid to. taxation
authorities. Tne tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or
substantively enacted. by the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised
directly in equity is recognised directly in equity and not in the Statement of comprehensive
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations
inwhich applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where
appropriate.


Deferred tax is determined using the liability method and is based on temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting pwposes and their tax
bases. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the date of the Statement of financial position. which are expected to apply to the period
when the temporary differences will reverse or the tax loss carried forward will be utilised.


18
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes;
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries that are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable
future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised based on the assumption that it is probable that future taxable
profits will be available against which it can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The current tax expense incurred by the Group reflects tax accrued in the subsidiaries of the Group
located in Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia and The Netherlands.
Output Value Added Tax (VAT) related to sales is payable to tax authorities on either the collection
of receivables from customers or the delivery of services to customers depending on which occurs
first. Input VAT is generally recoverable against output VAT upon receipt of the invoice. The tax
authorities in individual countries permit the settlement of VAT on a net basis. VAT relating to
sales and purchases is recognised in the Statement of financial position on a net basis and is
disclosed separately as an asset or liability, as the case may be. Where provision has been made for
impairment of receivables, the loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debt, including VAT.


3.23 Segment reporting
Management decisions and consequent allocation of resources are based on individual property
level reports, which are analysed in detail. Management has a hands-on approach and is involved in
day-to-day activities. Regular management meetings are held at least monthly for each property,
where the top management of the Group and each property manager analyse the financial results,
decide whether any repairs or improvements are necessary, review rent collection issues and
allocate resources to resolve any delays with tenants and review maintenance plans, vacancies and
the status of any contract negotiations, as well as other operational matters. The results of these
discussions ensure management decisions are specific to each of the properties. The Segmental
Reporting swnmarises the results recorded by the properties held by the Group. The properties can
be classified as retail, office or industrial properties, depending on industry practice.


The Group's Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM) are the executive directors and they take
decisions based on detailed reports. These are prepared regularly and are presented to the Board of
Directors, which approves the results and gives guidance on the subsequent strategy to be
undertaken.


Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as
those that can be allocated there on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly
investments (other than investment property) and related revenue, corporate assets and head office
expenses. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.


Financial information in respect of investment property is provided to the Board of Directors: net
rentals (including gross rent and property expenses) and valuation gains and losses. Individual


19
properties are aggregated into segments with similar economic characteristics.


Consequently, the Group is considered to have four reportable operating segments:


Retail segment: acquires, develops and leases retail properties in Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria,
Czech Republic, Serbia and Croatia;
Office segment: acquires, develops and leases office properties in Romania, Bulgaria and
Slovakia;
Industrial segment: acquires, develops and leases industrial facilities in Romania, and
Corporate segment: head office, administrative offices, and Group financing expenses.


The properties have been aggregated into four reportable segments (retail, office, industrial and
corporate) as each of these segments have specific revenue streams, different operational reporting
cycles across the Group's portfolio, separate operational teams including technical, leasing,
property and facility management.
The Group also reports by geographic segments, currently Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Bulgaria,
Czech Republic, Croatia and a "Holding" segment which includes The Netherlands.


3.24. Investment property acquisitions and business combinations
For each acquisition, management considers ifa business exists, more specifically if inputs,
significant processes and outputs exist. The inputs are represented by the properties. The outputs
are the leases from which rental income is generated. In terms of processes, management considers
if they exist and if they are substantive. Processes such as lease management, selection of tenants,
marketing decisions, investment decisions, are seen as substantive processes that are indicative of
the fact that a business combination exists. In assessing whether a transaction is a business
combination, management looks at what has been acquired, rather than the Group's subsequent
intentions. A transaction is still accounted for as a business combination, even If the Group is
interested mostly in the assets that exist within the business acquired, whereas the processes and
management within the business are disregarded or integrated within the existing structure.


For acquisitions or business combinations, the fair value of the net assets acquired is compared to
the consideration transferred. If the fair value of net assets acquired is lower, the difference is
recorded as goodwill. If the consideration is lower, the difference is recognised directly in the
income statement.


If an acquisition does not qualify as a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the
individual assets and liabilities. Goodwill or deferred taxes are not recognised.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method The acquisition is
recognised at the aggregate amount of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value on the
date of acquisition and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity.


20
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity either at fair value or as a proportionate share of their identifiable net assets. Transaction
costs incurred are expensed.


When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation, in accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions on the date of acquisition.


Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer win be recognised at fair value on
the date of acquisition. Subsequent changes to the fair value of any contingent consideration
classified as a liability will be recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income. Acquisition
accounting is fmalised when the Group has gathered all the necessary information, which must
occur within 12 months of the acquisition date. There are no exemptions from the iz-month rule for
deferred tax assets or changes in the contingent consideration.


Transactions with non-controlling interests, where control is maintained, are accounted for as
transactions within equity. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-
controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in the accumulated profit
reserve.


3.25. Changes in accounting policy and disclosUl"cs


The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for
the following standards and amendments which have been applied by the Group for the first time
for the reporting period commencing 1 January 2017.


Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses - Amendments to lAS 12, and


Disclosure initiative - amendments to lAS 7.


The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior
period and is not likely to affect future periods.


The amendments to lAS 7 require disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing
activities, see note 17.


21
3.26 Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted


IFRS 9 Financlallnstruments (Issued in July 2014 and effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1January 2018)


Financial assets are required to be classified into three measurement categories: those to be
measured subsequently at amortised cost, those to be measured subsequently at fair value through
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and those to be measured subsequently at fair value through
profit or loss (FVPL). Classification for debt instruments is driven by the entity's business model for
managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of
principal and interest {SPPO. If a debt instrument is held to collect, it may be carried at amortised
cost ifit also meets the SPPI requirement. Debt instruments that meet the SPPI requirement that
are held in a portfolio where an entity both holds to collect assets' cash flows and sells assets may be
classified as FVOCI.Financial assets that do not contain cash flows that are SPPI must be measured
at FVPL(for example, derivatives). Embedded derivatives are no longer separated from financial
assets but will be included in assessing the SPPI condition. Investments in equity instruments are
always measured at fair value. However, management can make an irrevocable election to present
changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, provided the instrument is not held for
trading. If the equity instrument is held for trading, changes in fair value are presented in profit or
loss. Most of the requirements in lAS 39 for classification and measurement of financial liabilities
were carried forward unchanged to IFRS 9. The key change is that an entity will be required to
present the effects of changes in own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value
through profit or loss in other comprehensive income. IFRS 9 introduces a new model for the
recognition of impairment losses - the expected credit losses (EeL) model. There is a 'three stage'
approach which is based on the change incredit quality of financial assets since initial recognition.
In practice, the new rules mean that entities will have to record an immediate loss equal to the 12-
month ECLon initial recognition of financial assets that are not credit impaired (or lifetime EeL for
trade receivables). Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk, impairment is
measured using lifetime ECL rather than tz-month EeL. The model includes operational
simplifications for lease and trade receivables. Hedge accounting requirements were amended to
align accounting more closely with risk management. The standard provides entities with an
accounting policy choice between applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and
continuing to apply IAS 39 to all hedges because the standard currently does not address
accounting for macro hedging.


22
The Group has assessed the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has
concluded that the impact is immaterial In respect of the Group's specific provisioning for
Accounts Receivable, the impact of the Group having applied IFRS 9 for the purpose of recognising
its tenants provisions, would have created an immaterial additional provision. The group has
additionally assessed that IFRS 9 win have an immaterial impact on the accounting for its financial
instruments and derivatives, as well as for loans to subsidiaries of the Company. The Group has not
adopted !FRS 9 before its mandatory date.


IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Issued on 28 May 2014 and
effective for the periods beginrrlng on or after 1January 2018)
The new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be recognised when the goods or
services are transferred to the customer, at the transaction price. Any bundled goods or services
that are distinct must be separately recognised, and any discounts or rebates on the contract price
must generally be allocated to the separate elements. When the consideration varies for any reason,
minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal. Costs incurred
to secure contracts with customers have to be capitalised and amortised over the period when the
benefits of the contract are consumed. The Group has assessed that this change has no significant
impact on the Group's financial position or performance.


IFRS 16 Leases (issued on 13January 2016 and effective for the periods beginning on
or after 1January 2019)
For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised in the Statement of financial position,
as the distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed. Under tile new standard,
an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The
only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The accounting for lessors will not
significantly change. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January
2019 and earlier application is permitted. The Group expects IFRS 16 to have an immaterial impact
on its current accounting practices, as the standard is aimed at a change in recognition for lessees
and the accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
There are no other standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and that would be
expected to have an impact on the Group's financial position or performance.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING PSTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING
ACCOUNTING POLICIES


The Group's management considers thc development, selection and disclosure of the Group's
critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as their application.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other
factors which are considered reasonable under the circumstances. These are used to make
judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the estimate is revised if the revision affects
only that period or in the period of the revision and future pcriods if the revision affects both.
Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are detailed below.


Valuation of inveabnent properties
Investment property is stated at its fair value based on reports prepared by international valuers as
at 30 June and 31 December each year. Valuations are based principally on discounted cash flow
projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows, using discount rates that reflect current
market assessments of the uncertainty in the amount and timing of the cash flows. These are
supported by the terms of any existing lease and other contracts and by external evidence such as
current muket rents for similar properties in the same location and condition.
In preparing the valuation reports on the Group's investment property, the external appraisers
excluded distressed sales when considering comparable sales prices. Management reviewed the
appraisers' assumptions relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the valuations, and
confirmed that factors such as the discount rate applied have been appropriately determined
considering the market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Valuations of the income generating properties are based on cash flow statements, in which the
present value of net operating income during a ten-year period and the residual value of the
property at the end of the period are calcu1ated.
Forecasts of net operating income are based on leases signed at the time of the valuation date, the
estimated rental values for existing leases when they expire and the estimated achievable rental
values of the existing vacancies. The value of long-term vacancies is estimated based on the
properties' location and condition. The valuers' assessments of non-recoverable expenses are based
on their experience of comparable properties and historical costs provided by the Group.
The discount rates used are nominal returns on total capital before tax and vary between 5% and 11.
5% (2016: 8~ and 11.75%). The required rates ofretum are based on assessments of the market's
required returns for similar properties. The discount rate is set individually for each property and is
based on the condition and location, the stability of the tenant and lease length.
Further information relating to sensitivity of significant accounting estimates used in the valuation
of investment properties is presented in Note 9.


24
Business combinations or asset acquisitions
The Group assesses for each property or entity acquired whether the transaction represents a
business combination or an 8S8et acquisition, taking into consideration the existence and level of
inputs, processes aad outputs in the respective property or entity. Additional information relating
to the basis for this assessment is described in Note 3.24-


5. INVESTMENI'IN SUBSIDIAIUES AND JOINT VENTURES


The Company has direct investments and indirect holdings in other Group companies that were
included in the consolidated financial statements, presented in note 33.


6. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTAND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


The Group has exposure to the following risks due to its use of financial instruments: credit,
liquidity, and market, including currency and interest rate. This note presents information about
the Group's exposure to each, as well as its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing risk.
The Group's policies are established to identify and analyse the risks it may encounter by
performing its activities, to set appropriate limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence
to limits. These policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions
and Group activities.
The fair value of all financial instruments is substantially in line with their carrying amounts as
reflected on the Statement of Financial Position, except for the bonds. The fair value of bonds is not
considered relevant, as the Group does not repurchase its own bonds, and, essentially, its Hability
towards bonds holders does not vary in line with the market price of its listed notes. However, for
reference, as at 31 December 2017, the {4oo,ooo thousand bonds issued in 2015 were trading on
the market at 107% (31 December 2016: 106%) and the C500,OOO thousand bonds issued in 2017
were trading on the market at 94%.


Below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group's financial
instruments carried in the financial statements for the financial instruments recognized at cost.

6.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails
to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from
tenants.


The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is set out below.

26
credit risk had no material effect on the fair value of the derivatives and other financial instruments
recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables relate mainly to the Group's tenants. When monitoring customer credit
risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an
individual or legal entity, the industry they work in, business size and previous financial difficulties.
The exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by the tenant's individual characteristics. The
Group's widespread customer base reduces credit risk. The majority of rental income is derived
from type A tenants (large international and national tenants; large listed tenants; government and
major franchisees and companies with assets and/or turnovers exceeding t:200 million), but there
is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade debtors.


Management has established a credit policy where new customers are analysed individually for
creditworthiness before standard payment terms and conditions are offered. When available the
evaluation includes external ratings.


The Group establishes an allowance for impairment based on its estimate of incurred losses in
respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The allowance's main element is a specific
loss component that relates to individual1y significant exposures. The carrying value of financial
assets approximates their fair value.

TOTAL TENANTS RECEIVABLES (NOTE 13)


Tenant receivables past due were not impaired because part of the amounts were collected after the
balance sheet date or because the Group has received guarantees from tenants (in cash or letters of
guarantee from banks) that are higher than the balance receivable.
The Group assessed its receivables for impairment and concluded that a net amount of C26
thousand was considered unlikely to be recovered in respect of 2017 period revenues, therefore an
allowance for doubtful debts was charged to the Statement of comprehensive income. As at 31
December 2016, an allowance for doubtful debts was charged to the Statement of comprehensive


27
income of €1,160 thousand had been reconsidered as likely to be recovered from tenants in respect
of the respective period revenues, therefore a reversal of allowance for doubtful debts was charged
to the Statement of comprehensive income.
Loans granted to joint-ventures are not past due or impaired.
For purposes of cash management the Group has deposit accounts with 8 number of banks. The
arrangements in place result in a favourable mix between flexibility and interest earnings. The
banks' credit ratings, as well as exposure per each bank are constantly monitored. At 31 December
2017,99% of the Group's cash was held with investment grade rated banks (31 December 2016:
9696).


6.2 Uquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due.
'The Group's approach to managing this risk ensures, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. To ensure this occurs. the Group prepares
budgets, cash flow analyses and forecasts, which enables the management to assess the level of
financing required for future periods. Budgets and projections are used to assess any future
potential investments and are compared to existing funds held on deposit to evaluate the nature,
and extent of any future funding requirements.
The Group receives rental income on a monthly basis. Typically, the Group ensures it has sufficient
cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses. This excludes the potential impact of
extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.


As at year-end, the Group had undrawn amounts of £380,000 thousand from the unsecured
revolving credit facilities. Further reference to bank loan maturity analysis is made in Note 17.
The table below presents undiscounted cash flows for bonds and bank loans, computed at the

6.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates
or equity prices will affect the Group's fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments. The
objective of market risk management is to manage market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising returns. The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities
approximates their fair value.


6.3.1 Currency risk
Group's current assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases and
receivables denominated in Romanian leu (RON), Bulgarian Lev (BGN), Serbian dinar (RSD),
Czech crown (CZK)and Croatian kuna (HRK).


Cash inflows received in other currencies than Euro are converted to Euro using the spot ratc
available on the collection date. Most of the contracts with Group tenants are concluded in Euro
and the cash inflows received in local currency are their Euro equivalent at the spot rate on
collection date, therefore limiting the currency risk for the Group.
The amount converted to Euro is the net amount of cash inflow in a foreign currency and the
estimated cash outflow in the same currency. The Group applies this policy to oontrol its exposures
in respect of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the one cash
inflows are received in.


6.3.2 Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on loans, borrowings and cash balances held. Group
policy is to hedge this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. Group's ultimate
parent company, NR.P, held interest rate swaps and interest rate caps which covered the entire
value of the loans held by the Group, as illustrated in the table below.


29
The inter-company borrowings bear no interest rate risk, as they are with fixed interest rate.

7· INTERNAL CONTIlOLS TO MANAGE RISKS


Management is responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. This system is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, Dot absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.


30
The key features of the Group's system of internal control include:


Strategic and business planning: the Group produces, and agrees, a business plan each
year, to which the performance of the business is regularly monitored;
Investment appraisal: capital projects, ml\ior contracts and business and property
acquisitions are reviewed in detail and approved by the management;
Financial monitoring: profitability, cash flow and capital expenditure are closely monitored
and key financial information is reported to management regularly, including explanations
of variances between actual and budgeted performance, and
Systems of control procedures and delegated authority: clearly defined guidelines and
approval limits exist for capital and operating expenditure and other key business
transactions and decisions.


8. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT


The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure it complies with its
quantitative banking covenants and maintains a strong credit rating. No changes were made in the
objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
Capital is primarily monitored using the gearing ratio, computed as interest bearing debt less cash
divided by investment property and net listed securities, which increased to 27.7% (31 December
2016: 26.6%).


The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base of equity so as to maintain investor, creditor
and market confidence and to sustain future business development. Neither the Company, nor its
subsidiaries, are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group will retain comfortable levels of access to liquidity to finance the Group's development
pipeline and to pursue further investment opportunities.

31
Investment property is carried at fair value and is assessed on a semi-annual basis.
All investment property in use is valued by the Income Method. The applied approach is either
discounted cash flow (DCF) or the direct capitalisation methods.


The discounted cash flow method (DCF) uses explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and
liabilities of ownership over the asset's life, including an exit, or terminal, value . .As an accepted
method within the income approach to valuation, the DCF method involves the projection of a
series of cash flows onto a real property interest. To these projected cash flow series, an
appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of cash inflows
associated with the real property.


The duration of cash flow, and the specific timing of inflows and outflows, are determined by events
such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related IC83e-up periods, re-Ietting, redevelopment or
refurbishment. The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour. In the case of
investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, non-
recoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance costs, agent and commission
fees, and other operating and managemcnt expenses. The series of periodic net cash inflows,
combined with the estimated terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then
discounted.


The capitalisation method works on the basis of capitalising the passing income for the duration of
the term and the reversionary market rental value into perpetuity. Explicit adjustments are made
for letting voids, empty service charge, letting fees, fit-out contributions and irrecoverable
operating costs. Income is capitalised at an equivalent yield, which is the constant capitalisation
rate applied to all cash flows.


For the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group commissioned independent year-end appraisal
reports on its investment property from Cusbman&Wakefield, Cushman&WakefJeld Affiliate
Partners and Colliers International, and for the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group
commissioned independent year-end appraisal reports on its investment property from
Cushman&Wakefleld. all members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). The fair
value of investment property is based on these reports. The Group provides all information
necessary for the valuations and all assets are valued on a semi-annual basis, as at 30 June and 31
December. Detailed tenancy schedules are made available, including information on occupied and
vacant units, unit areas and numbers, lease commencement and expiry dates, break options,
indexation clauses. All properties have been inspected for the 31 December 2017 valuations.
Valuations are prepared in accordance with the R1CS Valuation - Global Standards 2017 (the "Red
Book"). The Group's investment property is classified Level Three on the fair value hierarchy as
defined in IFRS 13.
For all investment properties, their current use equates to the highest and best use. The Group's
Finance department includes a team that reviews the valuations performed by the independent
valuers for financial reporting purposes. This team reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO). Discussions of valuation processes and results are held between the CPO, the valuation team
and the independent valuers twice a year.


At each financial year-end the finance department:


verifies all major inputs to the independent valuation report;
assesses property valuation movements when compared to the prior year valuation report;
and
holds discussions with the independent valuer:


As at 31 December 2017, the investment property at fair value portfolio had a vacancy rate of 3% (31
December 2016: ~%).


At the end of the reporting period, the Group's portfolio included retail, office and industrial
properties.


IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received (or selling an asset or paid for
transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. The Group currently discloses fair values according to a 'fair value hierarchy' (as per IFRS 13)
which categorises the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority {Levell) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the
lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is explained below:


Levell: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the entity can access at measurement date:
Level 2: use of B model with inputs (other than quoted prices included within Levell) that
are directly, or indirectly, observable market data, and
Level 3: use of a model with inputs not based on observable data.


The Group's investment property is categorised as Level 3. There were no transfers between
hierarchy levels during the year.


The yield resulted from the market value and passing rent of the portfolio is between 6% and
14.19% (31 December 2016 between 6.16% and 14.88%). The Group's resulting weighted average
net yield was 7'J6 for the entire property portfolio (retail: 6.9%; office: 7.53%: industrial: 11.73%).
For the period ended 31 December 2016, the Group's resulting weighted average net yield was
7.32% for the entire property portfolio Iretail: 7.23%: office: 7.72%; industrial: 11.59%).


33
An increase/decrease of 2Sbps to the yield of ~ from above would result in a (:108,123 thousand
decrease/ increase in the Group's property portfolio (2016: yield of 7.32l16, increase of 25bps wou1d
have resulted in a €78,271 thousand decrease).


The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorized within Level 3

No impairment charge arose as a result of the impairment test. The recoverable amounts of the
CGUs, except for Nepi Investment Management, were based on their fair value less costs of
disposal. The fair values of the properties were assessed based on reports by external valuers. The
external valuations are determined using discounted cash flow (MDCFD) projections based on
significant unobservable inputs. For more information on the unobservable input used in the
external valuation, reference is made to Note 9. The most relevant assumption is the terminal
value capitalisation rate.


Goodwill arising as a result ofinternalisation ofNEPI Investment Management is monitored at
the level of this subsidiary, which employs part of the Group's key management and charges
management fees to property operating companies. The recoverable amount ofthe CGU was
based on its value in use, which requires the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated cash flow of year 5.
The discount rate used is 8%.

The repayment profile for outstanding loans, excluding future interest, is detailed below. In
addition to these loans, the Group has loans and borrowings related to its joint ventures presented
in Note 33.

down from 3.7% in 2016, due to contracting new debt at lower rates and decreasing the interest
margin on the existing debt As at 31 December 2017, fixed-coupon bonds represented 84% of the
Group's outstanding debt towards non NRP Group lenders, and out of the remaining debt exposed
to EunDor, 100% was hedged with interest rate caps.

Group subsidiaries are subject to corporate tax OD an annual basis. The Group carries forward
aggregate fiscal losses of (184,237 thousand (31 December 2016: (237,569 thousand), which are
available for up to seven years to offset against any future taxable profits of the companies in which
the losses arose. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant
management judgement is required to determine recognisable deferred tax assets, based on the
likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and future tax planning strategies. Deferred tax
assets have not been reoognised for fiscal losses of C49,231 thousand (31 December 2016: (:52,366
thousand) as these could have been used only to offset the taxable profits of certain companies in
the Group, and there is uncertainty whether these companies will generate taxable profit in the
future. The expiry dates for these losses are as follows:

The assessment of recoverabiJity of loans granted to subsidiaries carried out by management as at
31 December 2017 resulted in an impairment of Cll,753 thousand (31 December 2016: C16,498
thousand). However, the term loan between the Company and Nepiom Limited stipulates that in
case the Company cannot recover a certain portion of the loans granted to its subsidiaries (that are
financed out of the term loan granted to the Company by Nepiom Limited), the Company may
