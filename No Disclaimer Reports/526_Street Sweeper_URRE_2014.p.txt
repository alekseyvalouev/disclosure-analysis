Uranium Resources: No Production, No Good Options Left

Summary


Optimism over Japan's plans to restart a nuclear power plant popped uranium
prices, which had been depressed since Japan shut down all nuke plants.


URRE can restart mining only if uranium reaches and sustains prices above the cost
of restarting and production, at least in the mid-$40 range.


URRE runs through about $1 million per month, though it produces nothing. So the
company has only enough cash to survive about 6 months.


Will URRE flood the market with millions of shares? It could. In order to restart
production idled since 2009, cash-poor URRE would need mega-bucks.


Running out of cash, URRE faces no positive options.


Shares of Uranium Resources (URRE) exploded this week as Japan hit the switch on its
first nuclear reactor since the earthquake-and-tsunami fueled nuclear disaster of 2011.


The Centennial, Colo. uranium mining company idled its operations years before Japan
shut down all nuke plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.


Yet, investors have begun grabbing URRE stock in the hope that Japan's nuclear plans
might make it worthwhile for URRE to restart mining. Though the price is settling down,
this speculation shot URRE shares up by a whopping 61 percent in five days to close
Wednesday at $2.49.


But URRE faces a very tough situation. Here are the highlights.


Production has ceased. URRE hasn't produced one speck of uranium in five years. Here's
what a URRE filing says:


"As a result of low uranium prices, we ceased production of uranium in 2009."


"None of URI's properties are currently in production."


URRE would restart mining only if uranium reaches and sustains prices above the cost of
restarting and production, at least in the mid-$40 range.

Here's what executives said in the Nov. 6 conference call:


"So the calculation would show that spot price of $43... $44, $45 dollar price
assuming $10 premium to long term, yes we have the 10% margin we need to get
started."


Optimism over Japan has propped up the price, but uranium still sells for an unprofitable
$41 per pound.


Uranium's only real commercial use is as a fuel for nuclear power plants that generate
electricity. The Fukushima meltdown tanked the price of uranium, and Japan's shutdown
of its remaining 47 nuclear plants kept it down.


Now, even if magic happens - Japan restarts one nuclear plant by about the second
quarter of 2015, and uranium prices hit $45 or more and remain there - URRE would still
require millions and at least the better part of a year to restart operations. In fact, URRE
leaders spoke of a 3- to 5-year time frame:


We can be ready to produce in south Texas on nine months' notice provided
we see two things; up price, spot price in little 40s and a trend to support that
price. So we tend to think of that in terms of three to five years more than
anything else is because we are operators on nature and we wish to be
conservative in our outlook for the company just so we are making promises
we can keep.


URRE runs through about $1 million per month, though it produces nothing. So its piggy
bank contains only enough cash to make it about 6 months.


A company Securities and Exchange Commission filing warns:


Our future uranium production, cash flow and income are dependent upon the
results of exploration as well as our ability to bring on new, as yet unidentified well
fields and to acquire and develop additional reserves... we may not be able to
remain in business and our stockholders may lose their entire investment.


Flooding the market with millions of shares? It could happen, because to hit "start" again,
URRE would need mega-bucks that it just doesn't have. So, where would the $6 to $7
million come from that execs say would be required to restart mining?

That's about how much money is available now, and the company is burning millions a
quarter - thanks partially to executives getting $2.2 million in compensation, including
$437,984 in stock-based bonuses last year, as they run a company that hasn't made a
dime in five years.


The company could consider several options to try to restart production: a stock offering,
get a loan or sell properties.


The first option would be to sell stock under the company's ATM agreement. The deal has
already allowed URRE to sell nearly 800,000 shares of stock. Earlier this month, the
company noted it still has $6.3 million worth that it could sell.


So, it could jump out with a multi-million share offering.


Under the second option, URRE has exhausted its senior convertible loan. And
considering the negative sentiment, the energy climate, unstable uranium prices and the
company's underperformance, URRE isn't a good prospect for getting a loan.


Part of the loan problem is the oversupply of uranium. A few years before the Japan
shutdowns, uranium fetched upwards of $80. Though uranium is about $41 due to the
Japan restart noise, the price has trended downward, falling to around $28 this summer.


The third option of selling property offers little promise. Anyone willing to pay millions for
cast-off, non-producing properties in the struggling, costly remediation, highly protested
solution uranium mining niche? Hmm. We didn't think so.


Conclusion:


Japan's restart of one plant, probably early next year, won't change the demand-supply
dynamics. Any additional nuclear plants will require a protested, long journey that could
take years or decades or forever - so the uranium price increase likely won't be sustained.
Besides, with oil around $80 per barrel, there may be less incentive for Japan to switch
from petroleum to nuclear.
