EHTH: Booking Revenues Today that it Will Collect in 2029 
 
 
We estimate that – prior to any tail revenue adjustment – it takes EHTH nine years to fully 
collect each dollar of Medicare Advantage revenue it books.  With tail revenue adjustments, 
EHTH’s collection period seemingly extends to 20 years.  EHTH’s future cash flows are 
therefore highly speculative.   
 
Our first report detailed our view that EHTH’s revenue recognition practices are unduly 
aggressive, particularly because the model is based on stickier cohorts that came through higher 
quality channels than EHTH’s 2018 and 2019 cohorts.  Seemingly lost in the mix by investors is 
the mismatch between EHTH revenues and cash collection.  EHTH’s highly aggressive revenue 
recognition practices mask that its growth-at-all-costs strategy has transformed it from a 
marginally profitable business into one that is destroying significant value while incinerating 
cash. 
 
We calculate the cash collections to match receivables for the 2019 customer cohort will take 
approximately nine years to come in, even using EHTH’s stated historical churn to estimate 
member attrition. 
 





Put another way, EHTH can expect to collect only about 64% of booked Medicare Advantage 
revenue during the three-year period for which it estimates revenue. 
 
This timing mismatch is pushed out even further by EHTH’s separate “tail revenue” adjustment, 
which we view as aggressive and oversized.  EHTH books MA tail revenue at the end of three 
years, which may appear reasonable at first glance: this is the same timespan as the company’s 
stated average MA life. But, given the small remaining member base at the time EHTH is 
booking this additional revenue, they are still facing down an additional six years of uncollected 
receivables before the tail revenue even begins to get collected.

As we detailed (and the promotional management has failed to acknowledge), future collections 
have associated costs relating to member retention and revenue sharing.  Without incurring these 
costs, EHTH would not be able to collect the cash to match its revenues.  However, by booking 
future estimated gross cash inflows now and continuing to state there are no ongoing costs, 
EHTH is amplifying a mismatch between its revenue and costs.   
 
We estimate that after factoring in ongoing costs, EHTH cash collections do not even meet the 
initial receivable booked, to say nothing of the company’s later tail revenue adjustments.  We see 
such forecasts as unmitigated accounting aggression by EHTH’s management, who obfuscate 
with the help of the company’s black-box statistical model. 
 
 
Understanding the Cash Collection Timeline 
 
EHTH assumes an average Medicare Advantage member life of approximately three years when 
it books revenue for a given customer cohort.  However, gross cash inflows take much longer 
than three years to match the revenue EHTH recognizes.  Since many members churn much 
sooner than three years, long-lived members must, in theory, make up the difference.  We 
calculate that as a result, it takes nine years for the revenue EHTH books from MA members to 
be collected.  This long delay makes management churn assumptions ever more critical, even as 
member churn has steadily elevated from Q4 2017 to Q1 2020. 
 
To calculate cash collections for each member that remains paying, we assume that, consistent 
with company statements, EHTH’s Year One receipts per MA member are 40% of the LTV, paid 
upfront.1  We use the unconstrained MA LTV of $1,089, since 7% of applications do not convert 
to paying members, consistent with company commentary.  This yields Year One collections of 
$435 for a member, assuming the member does not churn during the first three months of 
enrollment.  If a member does churn in the first quarter of membership, EHTH is generally

subject to full commission claw backs, which we also account for.2  Commissions relating to 
Years Two, Three, and beyond of a member’s plan life are equal to each other, so we split the 
remainder of the $1,089 unconstrained LTV evenly between Years Two and Three of the 
average customer life.  This yields $327 in cash collections per remaining member for each year 
after Year One.  
 
Per the company’s disclosures, only a fraction of members remains by the end of Year Three, 
which slows the pace of gross cash inflows relative to the three-year average MA life.  To arrive 
at a company-favorable churn estimate, we use EHTH figures.  First, we suppose 7% of 
approved applicants do not ever become paying members.  Then, we use EHTH’s stated yearly 
churns to derive the proportion of MA members leaving the platform each month.  Although we 
believe both the numerator and denominator of the company’s churn calculation are aggressive 
(see our April 8, 2020 report), we use these numbers in the absence of more accurate disclosures 
from the company.  Translating our month-over-month churn assumptions into annual churn 
along the lines of the company’s presentation, our estimates remain comparable.3 
 





Combining our estimates of cash collections per paying member per year with estimated member 
churn yields a nine-year payback period for EHTH’s booked revenues.  Such a repayment 
horizon stretches significantly beyond what the company’s three-year average life estimate 
suggests to investors, which, in our view, highlights the aggressive assumptions of EHTH’s 
revenue recognition. 
 
EHTH generates cash corresponding to its tail revenue only from members who still remain in 
Year Ten onward.  We forecast 24 years of total life for the cohort, which is company-favorable, 
given the average 65-year-old American can expect to live an additional 19.2 years.4  Even under 
these generous assumptions, tail revenue cash collections only amount to $227 per member,  or 
22.4% of the initial receivable booked.  To the extent that actual churn is higher than what 
EHTH forecasts, cash collections will struggle to match booked tail revenues.

How Tail Revenue Adjustments Work 
 
For each MA member cohort, EHTH books revenue twice.  The first time is when an application 
is approved by CMS.  At this time, the company records revenue per member equal to the 
constrained LTV, which was $1,013 at year-end 2019.5  However, the company also maintains 
that it is in a position to capture revenue in excess of the LTV, owing primarily to two factors.  
First, a small, residual “tail” of customers persists long enough that commissions received 
exceed what the receivables balance implies.6  Second, the company’s MA commission rates for 
existing members have grown alongside increases in CMS-mandated maximum commission 
rates.  EHTH books tail revenue adjustments to account for this additional purported customer 
longevity and the higher commission rates.  
 
We understand that historically, EHTH only made revenue adjustments for customer lives once 
all receivables had been collected.7  As we explain supra, this collection period for the initial 
revenues booked lasts approximately a decade.  Given that no EHTH Medicare Advantage 
cohort of size has reached that age, eHealth’s revenue adjustments for MA were historically 
modest: $917,000 in 2017 and -$124,000 in 2018.8  However, in Q4 2019, EHTH executed a 
change of policy.  It booked all estimated tail revenue for cohorts aged three years or more, $50.8 
million, in one period.9   
 
The company’s stated reasoning for beginning to book tail revenue was that member churn 
becomes more predictable after the three-year average life elapses.  But this assertion appears 
unsupported by recent developments at EHTH.  As we laid out in our initial report, member 
churn and the company’s customer profile are markedly worse than those of the older cohorts the 
company is relying on.   
 
We believe that EHTH has now decided to book an additional ~15 years of forecasted 
commissions in order to squeeze further revenue growth out of their customer base.  In our view, 
plucking backward-looking estimated revenues from ever further into the future only amounts to 
a heightening of EHTH’s aggressive practices, even as those future revenues become harder to 
collect. 
 
 
Management Continues to Misrepresent the Business 
 
In a recent conference appearance, EHTH CEO Scott Flanders continued to defend the 
company’s aggressive use of LTVs, stating, “[ASC] 606 accounting was mandated for all 
participants in this marketplace because when we enroll a senior, yes, if no action is taken, the 
commission is payable in perpetuity.”10  However, we view this response as a misdirection: MA 
plan members pay monthly premiums and can freely switch their plans for three months of the

year.  Many businesses with similar opt-out customer arrangements recognize sales as they come 
in, rather than booking the tortured, multi-decade revenue forecast that EHTH does.  Publicly 
traded gym chains, commercial landlords, and home security providers generally recognize 
revenues in the period they are received.  An example of a cash burning business that booked 
estimates of future income in current periods is Enron.  Given EHTH’s voracious appetite for 
cash and highly speculative future cash flows, what could go wrong? 
 
Moreover, EHTH invests a significant sum in making sure that “no action is taken”: two former 
EHTH employees informed us that the company instructs agents to make outreach calls to 
prevent members from switching.11 
 
The sheer number of seniors leaving EHTH is troubling.  This is evidenced by the company’s 
growing churn rate, which surpassed 50% in Q1 2019 for the first time since ASC 606 adoption.  
Management downplays this trend, but EHTH’s churn has increased over ten percentage points 
YoY: 
 


 
 
In our view, it is unjustifiable for EHTH to book nine years of estimated customer cash receipts 
upfront, particularly when it is losing more than half its customers in the first year.  At the same 
time, the company’s blue-sky forecasts leave no room for the possibility that EHTH’s all-
important carrier relationships fray amid the declining customer lead quality furnished to 
insurers. 
 
Then, there is the matter of the years of costs the company continues to ignore as it recognizes its 
forecasted revenue.   
 
 
After Adding Ongoing Costs, Receivables Cannot be Recovered 
 
EHTH claims there are no ongoing costs to the business.  As we pointed out in our initial report, 
this fiction is foundational to the company’s optically profitable growth, allowing it to recognize 
years of revenue while ignoring the continued expenses needed to service members and the 
EHTH platform. 
 
We identified approximately $75 of ongoing costs per member per year over the life of the 
customer relating to customer support, revenue sharing agreements, accounting and back office, 
information technology, and other expenses needed to be able to continue to operate the business 
to service and support existing members.   This $75 per member per year is material when 
viewed alongside not just the three-year stated customer life, but also against the nine years of 
estimated cash collections underlying the LTV.   We booked these liabilities against the LTV to 
calculate variable income per member.  Over the nine-year period in question, total variable

income does not even meet the initial receivables balance booked. 
 


 
 
We believe management’s refusal to acknowledge ongoing costs is intentional, and it masks the 
fact that EHTH is a fundamentally value destructive business.  In our view, management shows 
their brazenness when EHTH goes on to book further tail revenues despite failing to reach its 
stated MA LTV. 
 
 
Flawed and Misleading Accounting Masks Economic Reality 
 
We do not believe the Company has the data or history to justify booking sales as far away as 
2040, especially as EHTH has only been serving MA members in meaningful size for four years.  
Rather, EHTH’s adjustments are not only aggressive, as we demonstrated above, but they benefit 
from the confusion introduced by management’s statistical model.  In our view, EHTH is a stock 
promotion built on the back low quality (high churn) sales growth, reporting profits that do not 
properly match revenue to ongoing costs, and resulting in both the management and company 
issuing equity on the back of this short-termism and misrepresented business.
