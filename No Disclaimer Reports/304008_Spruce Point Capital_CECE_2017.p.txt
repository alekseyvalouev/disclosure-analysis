Spruce Point’s Activist Targets Often Result in 
Corporate Actions Post Report Publication
Executive Summary
6


Spruce Point is Short CECO Environmental
For the Following Reasons:


Spruce Point is short CECO Environmental (Nasdaq: CECE, “CECO” or “the Company”), a poorly constructed roll-up 


serving the environmental, energy, fluid handling and filtration industrial segments. Based on our forensic financial 


analysis, insider behavior, and anticipated changes in the regulatory environment driving its business, we believe CECO 


is at high risk of a covenant breach in 2017. We urge investors to consider the following when evaluating CECO:


 CECO has acquired 7 companies since 2013 at the expense of punitive dilution, and mounting leverage on its balance sheet. 


With 55% of its assets as goodwill and intangibles, we believe CECO is forestalling a crippling goodwill impairment of Met-Pro, its 


largest acquisition, and a deal it touted as a “success.” CECO’s shares appreciated 83% in 2016 on the false perception that its


recent PMFG acquisition has also been a winner. However, we believe CECO pulled forward cash flow through rapid synergy 


realization and working capital maneuvers to pay down debt ahead of schedule. However, recent performance suggests that both 


CECO and PMFG are now declining organically by double digits, and management stopped disclosing key contribution metrics


 We thank Street Watchdog Research’s recent note alerting us to CECO and the fact that its single most important business 


driver is a stringent environmental regulation regime that drives its clients to comply with issues such as air pollution control. With 


the election of President Trump, and his new Executive Order designed to expedite environmental reviews and eliminate 


burdensome environmental compliance issues, CECO’s future is at best uncertain, and at worst materially impaired. Not 


surprisingly, the same day of the Executive Order, the Company’s CEO abruptly resigned, but not before cashing in options, and 


leaving unexpired RSUs tied to 2017 EBITDA. Based on our research, we found other key executive departures at CECO, 


particularly in Asia, where it touts a large and growing opportunity to gain market share


 The Company’s CFO also left his position prior to the CEO’s departure. We are concerned that CECO recently appointed its 5th


CFO since 2011. Pay close attention to new language about material weaknesses of financial controls in the recent 10-K. 


Specifically, the Company cited issues with accounting for revenues. This should be a big red flag to investors, particularly


because CECO uses the “percentage-of-completion” method of accounting, which is notoriously abused and a focus of SEC 


investigations according to a recent speech from the enforcement director


 CECO’s governance is weak and should give investors’ cause for concern. The current Chairman is the son of the former CEO 


Phillip DeZwirek, who settled with the SEC for insider trading, without admitting guilt. The rest of the Board is stacked with allies 


of the DeZwirek family, and many have questionable backgrounds that offer little relevant experience to CECO’s core 


businesses. The Board has shown a willingness to pay management cash bonuses for completing bad deals, and rubber 


stamping annual cash bonuses for failure to hit financial targets
7


We See 30% – 60% Downside As 
Covenant Breach Comes Into Focus:


 CECO has been touting to investors that it has been successful in delevering its balance sheet post-PMG acquisition, and that its 


current Net Debt to EBITDA ratio is down from 3.6x to 1.6x as of 9/30/16. On the surface, this appears impressive, but the 


picture is not so simple. CECO should be pointing investors to is “Leverage Ratio” covenant per its credit agreement which looks


at gross leverage (not net of cash) and includes significantly more debt obligations beyond just its term loan. When factoring in 


CECO’s earnout obligations, leases, and outstanding letters of credit, we find that its current leverage is closer to 3.4x


 CECO has no room for misstep in 2017 given its Leverage Ratio covenants will tighten twice, from 3.5x to 3.25x in September, 


and finally to 3.0x in December. Based on our analysis, at CECO’s current LTM EBITDA of $56.5m, it will most certainly trip a


covenant absent material improvement in EBITDA or a dilutive equity raise. CECO has also said it has no additional assets of 


materiality to sell to accelerate the deleveraging process. In short, the Company is stuck between a rock and hard place


 Optically, CECO’s share price looks cheap, and analyst’s argue that its valuation discount to peers will narrow, while its organic 


growth accelerates and its margins improve. The average analyst price target is $13.40/share, implying 7% upside. This is 


wishful thinking, and represents a terrible risk/reward. Don’t be fooled: there is no visibility in CECO’s business, it has suffered 


significant executive turnover, and its #1 risk factor just materialized. The easiest way to value CECO is on a book value basis. 


We expect a goodwill impairment to eliminate $79m of equity. By adjusting the book value and applying a generous 1.0x – 1.5x 


multiple, we get $4.85 to $7.25 per share or 40% - 60% downside. We also conservatively estimate sales declines of 8% – 12%, 


which at 1.0x to 1.2x multiple (in line with its small cap peers) and using our adjusted debt gets us a valuation range of 


approximately $6.25 to $9.00 per share or 30% - 50% downside


 Follow the money: The CEO just exercised options and dumped shares prior to resigning, and as a reminder, left on the table 


restricted stock units (RSUs) specifically tied to 2017 EBITDA, a critical target necessary to avoid a covenant breach. CECO’s 


Chairman and largest shareholder just altered the terms of his large warrant to allow for “cashless exercise” – a way to avoid 


tying up capital in the stock, and using stock sales to fund the warrant exercise. The remaining executive team owns virtually no 


equity, and has little at stake if CECO fails

Our focus will be on CECO’s two largest deals to acquire Met-Pro (2013) and PMFG (2015) which entailed substantial

(1) Investors should be especially skeptical of this deal. Why was a company with $28m of sales sold for just $7m of cash and a $27m earnout (80% of the deal value)

CECO’s Business Under Pressure


Despite numerous acquisitions from 2013 – 2015, it’s clear CECO’s business is under pressure. We base our view on 


evidence from the Company’s declining margins and widening GAAP vs. Non-GAAP results. (top two charts)


This was the likely motivation to acquire PMFG, which closed Sept 3, 2015. We will demonstrate this recent deal has 


been a failure and came with heavy dilution and dangerous leverage (bottom charts).

CECO Promotes Its Met-Pro Deal 
As A “Success Story”…..


Through 2013, CECO’s largest deal was to acquire Met-Pro for $203m.


Two years later, CECO was promoting “The CECO Met-Pro Acquisition Success Story” in the slide below.


CECO used to report Met-Pro’s results as a business segment “Met-Pro Group” (2013) but effective Jan 1, 2014 CECO 


implemented an internal reorganization resulting in its three current reporting segments. (2014 10-K, p. 33) 


This reorg made it difficult to track Met-Pro’s performance; but, scroll forward to see what really happened…..

But In Reality…CECO Appears To Be Forestalling 
A Large Goodwill Impairment At Met-Pro


Goodwill Impairment Discussion 2nd Quarter 2016 (10-Q, p. 10)


“The Company did not identify any triggering events during the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 that would 


require an interim impairment assessment of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets. There was no impairment of goodwill or 


indefinite life intangible assets during the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016.”


Revised Language:  3rd Quarter 2016 (10-Q, p 10) Note: CECO also says the unit was acquired in 2H 2013 (Met-Pro)


“Although the Company has not identified any triggering events in 2016 that would require a more frequent test for impairment, the 


reporting unit with a lower excess fair value over its carrying value (as described above), as determined in the prior year’s annual 


assessment, is experiencing lower than forecasted results through the first nine months of 2016.  This reporting unit has 


goodwill and tradename intangible assets of $77.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016.  The 


Company is currently in the process of analyzing internal strategic initiatives to improve operating performance, and 


forecasting for 2017 and future years as part of its annual impairment assessment, which is performed as of October 1, 


and will be completed in the fourth quarter.  As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet completed its 


assessment.”


Notice Change in Goodwill Impairment Testing To Incorporate Market Method Testing (10-Q, p. 10)


“Under the first step, the Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a weighting of the income 


method and the market method on a 50/50 basis.  In prior years, the Company used the income method. The income method is 


based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational 


profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital…. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable 


companies and applies a control premium.  Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar 


companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and 


assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on 


the step 1 analysis, the resultant estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of October 1, 2015 and 


no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.


In our opinion, CECO has realigned its business segments (2014) and altered its goodwill testing methodology (2015) in 


order to avoid a substantial goodwill impairment. CECO now uses the market method “with a control premium” and has 


wide discretion to choose larger and healthier companies in its analysis. As of its last 10-Q, it appears an impairment is 


becoming increasingly imminent.

CECO Promotes Its PMFG Deal 
As A “Success Story”…..


With the Met-Pro business under pressure and needing a new growth driver, CECO announced the acquisition of 


PMFG in May 2015. The Company outlined eight reasons why the deal made sense and has recently been touting that 


the deal has exceeded expectations.

Deal Promotion: “Organic Growth” and 
“Recurring Revenue”


Source: PMFG and CECO Deal Presentation, May 2015


The CECO / PMFG was heavily promoted as a combination that would drive “organic revenue” growth 


and “recurring revenue” – both buzz words to get investors excited, and to achieve a higher stock price 


valuation.  However, according to each company’s 10-K, neither CECO or PMFG ever used the terms 


“recurring” revenues prior to merging. Furthermore, CECO only used the word “aftermarket” twice in 


its pre-acquisition 10-K.

(1) Per CECO’s Q3’15 investor presentation (slide 8), PMFG’s full 3Q sales were $33.5m and its contribution to the quarter reflecting the deal close date of 9/3/15 were


$12.6m. We have increased CECO’s Q3 results of $98.2m by $20.9m to pro forma adjust the quarter as if PMFG had been acquired at the beginning of the quarter.


In our view, the Company’s acquisition of PFMG in September 2015 is a disaster. Its revenues declined by 


approximately 29% in Q3, and the Company stopped disclosing bookings. Overall, CECO organic growth 


declined by 11% in Q3.

CECO / PMFG Deal: A Complete Bust 
Relative To Initial Expectations


Deal Proxy: PMFG Revised Management Case Projections


Deal Proxy: CECO Stand Alone Management Case Projections


Deal Press Release: “CECO and PMFG’s products and end markets are highly complementary and when 


combined will represent one of the most comprehensive product portfolios in the industry with 


approximately $500 million in environmental, energy and fluid handling-related revenue.”


Based on our review, PMFG produced just $112.8m 


of bookings and $111.6m of revenues from 


June 2015 – June 2016 coinciding with its FY 2016. 


PMFG’s gross margin was projected at 31.9%. For 


Q4’15 CECO projected 27% gross margins (slide 8), 


and came in at an unbelievable 35.3% (slide 8). 


Thereafter, CECO stopped disclosing further 


gross margins attributable to PMFG


CECO says PMFG added $17.3m of EBITDA from 


Sept 15 -16, but that includes $20m of synergies


1)  PMFG excluded a $28.4 million contract from fiscal year 2016 net bookings that was previously included in the March 2015 projections


2) Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of any potential synergies or costs related to the Mergers.


Proxy Statement


We calculate core CECO Revenues 


and EBITDA for the LTM 9/30/16 


period as $316.3m and $39.7m, 


respectively. These results are 


trending significantly below plan

Beware of Rapid Synergies


Source: Deal Presentation, May 4, 2015 Source: Q1 Investor Presentation, March 2016


Spruce Point is skeptical of CECO’s rapid synergy implementation. The Company originally forecast $15m of 


synergies to be realized over 24 months. Yet, by March of 2016, the Company achieved its target in only 6 months. 


CECO then went on to increase its realized synergies twice, increasing them to $18m by Q2’16 and then to $20m by 


Q3’16 and didn’t provide any further explanation. These rapid synergy realizations support our belief that further 


upside to CECO’s substantial cash flow benefits in 2016 are not likely to be repeated going forward.

CECO “Trumped” By A President With A 
Disdain For Environmental Regulation


We thank Street Watchdog Research for initially bringing CECO to our attention following the resignation of CEO 


Lang on Jan 24, 2017 which came on the same day the Executive Order signed by the Trump administration 


targeting the streamlining of environmental review processes. (1) It’s no secret that our President wants to cut 


government red-tape, and that he views the EPA as prime target for budget cuts. According to reports, it is 


reasonable to expect cuts of $1 billion from the EPA’s $8 billion annual budget. (2)  These actions are likely to have 


a significant impact on CECO.  CECO’s 10-K lists the #1 demand driver for its business and says “increasingly 


stringent environmental regulations are the principal factor that drives our business.” Accordingly, changes in 


environmental regulation are its #1 risk factor. 


1) Executive Order: “Executive Order Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals For High Priority Infrastructure Projects”


2) Trump Wants to Slash the EPA's Workforce and Budget, Transition Official Says, Time, Jan 27, 2017


We believe demand for our products and services in the United States and globally will continue to be driven by the 


following factors:


Stringent Regulatory Environment. The adoption of increasingly stringent environmental regulations in the United States and globally 


requires businesses to pay strict attention to environmental protection. Businesses and industries of all types from refineries, power, 


chemical processes, metals and minerals, energy market and industrial manufacturing must comply with these various international, 


federal, state and local government regulations or potentially face substantial fines or be forced to suspend production or alter their 


production processes. These increasingly stringent environmental regulations are a principal factor that drives our business.


Changes in current environmental legislation could have an adverse impact on the sale of our environmental control 


systems and products and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows


Our business is primarily driven by capital spending, clean air rules, plant upgrades by our customers to comply with laws and 


regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or 


human health. These laws include, but not limited to, U.S. federal statutes such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 


1976, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act,


the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the regulations implementing these statutes, as well as similar laws and regulations at state and 


local levels and in other countries. These U.S. laws and regulations may change and other countries may not adopt similar laws and 


regulations. Our business may be adversely impacted to the extent that environmental regulations are repealed, amended, 


implementation dates delayed, or to the extent that regulatory authorities reduce enforcement.

Tectonic Shift In Policy


The magnitude of the directional change in projected carbon emissions under Trump cannot be overstated. Below 


is an excellent chart from Lux Research showing the reversal of policy. Much of this comes at the expense of 


companies such as CECO that provide solutions to deal with regulations to curb emissions.

Spruce Point believes CECO’s recent free cash flow is not sustainable and likely to decline. On a pro-forma basis for the 


acquisition of PMFG (including run-rate cost synergies of $20m) we estimate free cash flow of $31.8m. However, as we 


previously illustrated, both CECO and PMFG have experienced double digit revenue declines post-acquisition. 


YTD 2016, CECO has generated abnormal free cash flow of $20.3m which it attributes a “few favorable net working 


capital items.” – primarily collections of receivables. (1)  The abnormal cash flow was used to make $23.3m of 


prepayments on its term-loan – a wise move in our view before cash flow dries up.


Note: Simplified analysis since we do not know what the cash flow contribution of PMFG has been post acquisition. $15m of the $20m of synergies reported to have 


been realized by March 2016 post deal close of Sept 2015. Pro forma best case assumes no deterioration in the underlying businesses

Unsustainable Cash Flow (Cont’d)


CECO’s recent slide on “Strong Free Cash Flow Generation” is backward looking. 


Based on our view, there are numerous reasons to believe the recent performance is unsustainable and cash flow will contract.


Not sustainable in our view and being temporarily 


inflated from working capital effects


How long can a manufacturing business spend nothing 


on maintenance capex?


Aggressive to show asset sales as free cash flow, 


especially since they aren’t recurring. Per the 3Q’16 


earnings call, the CFO says they are through most of 


planned sales; expect zero benefit going forward

Potentially Misleading View of Leverage


Spruce Point believes that CECO’s display of its leverage and debt reduction is potentially misleading. The 


Company’s recent investor slide shows “Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA” and illustrates that it has been declining 


post-PMFG acquisition. However, the key leverage metrics that investors should be focused on are its financial 


covenants articulated in its credit agreement. CECO’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio does not net cash and cash 


equivalents against debt. (1) CECO’s Adjusted EBITDA adds back earnout amortization expense, so it is not apples-


to-apples for CECO to ignore significant earnout liabilities.

Our analysis suggests CECO has no EBITDA cushion and could be in breach within a few quarters.

Suspicious CEO Departures


CECO CEO Resignation Date Questionable Behavior


Phillip DeZwirek 2/15/10


CEO from Aug 1979 to Feb 2010. On September 3, 2013 the SEC charges Mr. 
DeZwirek with insider trading on three occasions and “engaging in hundreds of 
violations of the trade reporting and ownership disclosure rules of the federal 
securities laws”


Jeff Lang 1/24/17
Abrupt and unexpected resignation of the CEO. Mr. Lang cashes in options on Dec 
21st to Dec 28th reaping $634k of gains. Upon news of his departure, CECO’s stock 
fell almost 15%


At the CEO level there has also been controversy. CECO’s long-time CEO Mr. DeZwirek was charged with insider 


trading around issuing promotional press releases, while selling stock. He settled charges without admitting guilt. 


CECO’s current CEO abruptly resigned in January 2017, but not before he cashed in options and reaped $634k in 


gains. The resignation was clearly a surprise to the market; CECO’s stock declined by almost 15% on the news. 


Mr. Lang’s options are fully vested, and he still has 280,000 unexercised options struck at $3.78/sh.


In our view, Mr. Lang’s resignation signals an inability to hit financial targets. His recent compensation plan 


was changed to include performance-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) tied to 2017 EBITDA:


“In addition, after consultation with Meridian and consideration of general market trends, in 2015 the Compensation 


Committee introduced time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs into its compensation program. Specifically, in 


September 2015, the Compensation Committee approved grants to Mr. Lang of time-based RSUs that generally vest on 


March 1, 2020 and performance-based RSUs that generally vest based on the degree to which the Company achieves 


a 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) performance goal, subject to 


additional service-based vesting in two substantially equal installments on March 15, 2018 and 2019. We anticipate describing 


in further detail the specific EBITDA goal after the applicable performance period is completed.”  (Proxy, p. 19)

Rubber Stamping Board


Spruce Point has repeatedly warned about avoiding companies with bad board oversight of management. 


In the case of CECO, we see that its Board awarded bonuses to management despite not hitting its 


financial target. Also, we do not believe that management should be paid bonuses for closing 


acquisitions, particularly when acquisitions are apart of the Company’s stated business strategy.


Mr. Lang is entitled, under his employment agreement, to an incentive cash bonus of up to 100% of his base salary 


depending on whether performance objectives, as approved by the Compensation Committee, are met. For 2015, the 


Compensation Committee approved and established multiple objectives. The objectives, which were both qualitative and 


quantitative, consisted of achieving operating income of $60.0 million, integrating the PMFG acquisition along with Emtrol, 


HEE and Zhongli, growing EBITDA and operating income in 2015 over the level in 2014, building a larger platform for the 


future and recruiting and expanding the senior leadership team. Although the operating income target was not met for 


the Company, the Compensation Committee awarded a bonus to Mr. Lang of $431,250, which is 75% of his then-


current base salary, due to his efforts with respect to the qualitative objectives in 2015. Mr. Lang also received a 


$350,000 cash bonus in connection with an acquisition completed in 2015.


Although the quantitative targets were not met for the Company, nor were all of the individual performance targets 


met for both Mr. Prajzner and Mr. Cook, the Compensation Committee awarded a cash bonus of $50,000 and 


$29,530 to Mr. Prajzner and Mr. Cook, respectively, due to their efforts in helping complete and integrate strategic 


acquisitions during 2015. Mr. Prajzner also received an additional $50,000 cash bonus in connection with an 


acquisition completed during 2015.

Follow The Money Carefully…


Given our views on the unattractiveness of owning CECO shares, its largest shareholder and Board 


Chairman has been steadily decreasing his ownership since 2013.  As an additional potential indicator of 


his aversion to owning shares, we observe that on December 9, 2016 Icarus (his investment holding 


company) amended its CECO warrant agreement to allow for “Cashless Exercise.” By making this change, 


DeZwirek eliminates his need to commit cash to purchasing CECO shares, and will settle the warrant by 


selling shares to fund the exercise. (Source: 8-K filing). Excluding CEO Lang’s ownership, the remaining 


executives own virtually no stock and have nothing at risk if CECO fails.

Accounting Worries and Financial 
Control Issues
34


Serious Accounting Concerns


CECO freely admits it has material weaknesses of internal controls. What troubles Spruce Point the most is that even its revenues 


are at risk of misstatement. A substantial portion of CECO revenues use the “Percentage-of-Completion” method of accounting, 


which requires a high degree of management judgement to estimate contract costs.


Source: Q3’16 10-Q, p. 34 and Revenue Recognition Policy (10-K, p. 39) 


1. The Company did not maintain internal control over financial reporting that was appropriately designed, adequately 


documented and operating effectively to support the accurate and timely reporting of revenue recognition. Specifically, the 


Company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure:


• revenue recognition policies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;


• estimates of percent complete are accurate;


• all projects are supported by executed contracts, including approved change orders; 


• billings are approved;


• there is appropriate systems access and controls over schedules; and


• appropriate review of contracts by accounting personnel.


2. The Company did not implement effective internal control over financial reporting, either divisional specific or corporate 


monitoring controls for Zhongli in China acquired in December 2014 and PMFG acquired in September 2015.


3. The Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of accounting, 


experience and training commensurate with its financial reporting requirements and increased size due to recent acquisitions.


4. The Company did not maintain internal control over financial reporting that were  appropriately designed, adequately 


documented and operated within its decentralized structure to:


• determine the completeness and accuracy of reports and spreadsheets used in the execution of internal controls over 


financial reporting;


• determine the appropriateness of manual journal entries;


• maintain an effective information technology general control environment, including restricting access to certain key 


financial systems and records to appropriate users; and


• maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the purchasing process.


Recent Risk Factor Warning: “In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements 


that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”

Revenue Inconsistencies


To illustrate our deep concern, we carefully reviewed CECO’s financial statements.


We found a disclosure that the Company had issues with the overstatement of revenues it reported in its press release.


What’s even more mysterious, is that CECO has contradicted itself about the amount of the restatement, in one place 


saying it was a $2.7m adjustment, but on the last page of its 10-K noting the revenue adjusted was $5.2m


We caution investors to tread carefully. 


Beware of Inconsistencies In Revenue Reporting:


“On March 10, 2016, the Company furnished a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission 


that included an earnings release issued that same day reporting results for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was furnished as 


Exhibit 99.1 thereto (the Earnings Release). Between the issuance of the Earnings Release and the filing of this Annual Report 


on Form 10-K, the Company became aware of additional information affecting its final closing adjustments, which resulted in 


the Company recording, for the three month period ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in net sales of $2.7 million, a 


decrease in cost of goods sold of $0.3 million, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $2.0 


million, resulting in a decrease in pre-tax income of $0.4 million, which was offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $0.4


million.  The net impact of these adjustments had no impact on net income or diluted earnings per share as initially reported for 


the year ended December 31, 2015.” (Source: 2015 10-K, p. 29)


And Then On The Last Page In The Annual Report, A Completely Different Description:


“In making final closing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company became aware of additional 


information affecting the determination of year-to-date revenue recognition for certain business units, which resulted in the 


Company recording, for the three month period ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in net sales of $5.2 million, and 


a decrease in cost of goods sold of $5.0 million.” (Source: 2015 10-K, p. F-44)

Percentage-of-Completion Schemes Are A 
Current Focus of SEC Investigations


“Revenue recognition issues will remain a staple of our financial fraud caseload – this fraud often takes many forms, 


whether by recognizing revenue through sham transactions, prematurely recognizing revenue, distorting percentage of 


completion accounting, using schemes to inflate sales numbers, or billing for uncompleted products through a “pre-


booking” scheme.” SEC Enforcement Director Speech, 2013


Company Year Note


Archrock 2017


Financial statements for FY 2013-2015 should no longer be relied upon. The determination was made after 
considering conclusions reached by Exterran Corporation that there were material errors in such historical 
periods relating to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to certain Belleli 
engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) contract


Orbital ATK 2016
The Restatement is primarily a result of a non-cash error in the application of purchase accounting with 
respect to a limited number of long-term contracts, which are accounted for under the percentage-of-
completion method


Toshiba 2015


Toshiba Corp. must correct at least 152 billion yen ($1.2 billion) of pretax earnings over a six year period 
after an internal accounting probe revealed the company overstated profits. The company initially 
uncovered irregularities related to “percentage of completion” estimates used on infrastructure projects, 
including nuclear, hydroelectric, wind-power equipment, air-traffic control and railway systems


L-3 
Communications


2014


Receives SEC subpoena and DOJ investigation and pays fine of $1.6m and $4.6m, respectively to each 
agency (source). The cases relate to improper revenue accounting at L3’s aerospace systems segment that 
resulted in the contractor’s correcting financial results over a roughly four-year period starting in 2011 and 
firing at least four employees.


Cubic Corp 2012 Changes will result in an increase in revenues and net income cumulatively over the period 


Computer 
Sciences Corp


2011
The anticipated result of the restatement is to reduce net income by ~$50 in FY 2010 and ~$3.69 billion in FY 
2011 and to increase net income in FY 2012 by ~$3.90 billion. Settled with the SEC for $190m

Slow To Recognize Losses in Earnings?


Pay close attention to the footnotes.


CECO is starting to slowly recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts


“Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No 


provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.” (Source: 


2015 10-K, p. 39)


“Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes


to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are


recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was 


required at March 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.” (Source: Q1’16 10-Q)


“Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes


to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are


recognized in the period in which the revisions are made.  A provision of $0.1 million for estimated losses on uncompleted 


contracts was recognized at June 30, 2016.  No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was required at 


December 31, 2015.”  (Source: Q2’16 10-Q)

contracts was recognized at September 30, 2016. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was required

A majority of CECO’s analysts have Buy recommendations and see upside to $13.40 on average (implying 


just 7% upside). Given our views on the risk and uncertainties for CECO, it doesn’t appear to be a 


compelling risk/reward. 


We congratulate the lone analyst at Jefferies for having a price target below the current price.

Bull vs. Bear Debate


Bull’s View Spruce Point’s Bearish View


“We believe the valuation is attractive, given the deep discount 


relative to the peer group and the potential for upside to our 


earnings estimates, the company’s margin expansion initiatives, 


and the potential for accretion from the PMFG acquisition. We 


maintain our Outperform rating”


“The company does not provide official guidance, but management 


said the margin outlook for the next couple quarters should be 


consistent with the 2016 year-to date averages for gross and 


operating margin (about 31% gross margin and 12% operating 


margin). Management also intimated the level of revenue (in 


absolute dollars) seen in the next few quarters should be 


consistent with the level reported in third quarter 2016 ($102m).”


“Cash and cash equivalents were $43 million and total debt 


was $133 million (down from $177 million in fourth quarter 


2015). The ratio of net debt to pro forma EBITDA was 1.6 


times as of the end of the third quarter. 


“Upside Scenario: Operating margin reaches 15% goal before 


2018, on improving organic sales growth.”


“Looking forward, we are lifting our EBITDA and EPS 


estimates driven by uptick in margins in spite of revenue cuts.” 


Free Cash Flow Yield. On a free cash flow basis CECE is yielding 


14%, normalizing for large working capital improvements FCF is 


likely approximately $40 mm or 11% - very compelling. At our


target price FCY yield would be 9%


Largest margin expansion is already behind CECO, particularly 


with the repeated cost synergy increases well beyond 


expectations and timing. Other headwinds to margins include 


rising raw material (steel) costs due to CECO’s manufacturing  


Adjusted debt is closer to $190m. This is what investors should 


be focused on given that CECO’s debt covenants are set to 


tighten significantly in 2017. CECO’s cash should be discounted 


too since $22m is invested abroad and would be subject to 


taxation or conversion restrictions (China) upon repatriation


We agree the cash flow should be normalized, but we think $40m 


is still too aggressive. We view $30m of free cash flow more likely, 


and that doesn’t include remaining cash payments for earnouts of 


$18-$20m. Scheduled debt payments are $9m in 2017


Don’t be fooled by a cheap valuation. We believe CECO is 


forestalling a $79m goodwill impairment and that its earnings are 


about to roll over. The easiest margin expansion initiatives are 


long past. CECO is expensive considering its business has 


declining organic growth and grim prospects


No guidance but giving guidance anyway sound unusual? Post 


this guidance, why did the CEO abruptly resign if he believed in 


a positive outlook? Also, how can investors get comfortable with 


management’s guidance when it has consistently misguided in 


the past. The initial guidance on revenue offered for the PMFG 


acquisition has been horribly missed
41


Comparable Companies


CECO “looks cheap” on Street estimates, but any buyer should beware that organic revenue is quickly 


declining and the uncertainty in CECO’s end markets provide little long-term visibility.


We benchmark CECO against small and microcap industrial companies serving the environmental, filtration, 


and power industries.

Spruce Point Intermediate View vs. 2017/18 Street View Spruce Point Intermediate Term Price Reference Ranges


Spruce Point believes that 2017 could be a major re-set year for CECO’s earnings and valuation. We believe 


the biggest catalyst will be significant earnings misses from continued organic growth declines, and a 


realization that its debt covenant has no cushion. Other headwinds include a high exposure to foreign sales 


(38% of 2015 sales) which are muted by a strong dollar and to rising steel prices, which the company cites 


as a key raw material input cost and have rebounded sharply from last year and are expected to rise (1).
