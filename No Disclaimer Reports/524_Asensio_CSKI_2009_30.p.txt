Discrepancies Bigger than Ever in China Sky’s
Financial Statements Filed with Chinese
Government


Posted on November 24, 2009 by Asensio.com


On August 6th, asensio.com first reported on discrepancies between


the financial statements of China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:


CSKI) filed with U.S. and Chinese regulatory agencies. CSKI files


consolidated financial statements with the U.S. Securities and


Exchange Commission (SEC), and CSKI’s operating subsidiaries, all


located in China, file financial statements with the China State


Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).


Apparently in response to the SAIC controversy, CSKI issued a press


release on August 26, stating that “it is contemplated that in future


filings there will be no material differences in the information


contained in the financial statements filed with the SAIC and the


SEC.”


At the time of the August 6th report, the 2008 SAIC filings for Harbin


Tian Di Ren Medical Science and Techology Co. (TDR), CSKI’s main


operating subsidiary, were not available. Since then, the 2008 SAIC


filings for TDR have been made available, and the discrepancies


with CSKI’s SEC filings appear larger than in the 2007 filings.


According to the SAIC filings, TDR had revenue of only 6.9 million


RMB, or about US$1 million, in 2008, and TDR’s revenue decreased


24.7% from 2007 to 2008. By contrast, CSKI’s SEC filings show 2008


revenue of US$91.8 million, an increase of 86.2% over the prior


year.


TDR shows a 2008 net loss of 779,161 RMB, or about US$114,000,


while CSKI reported 2008 net income of US$28.9 million.
