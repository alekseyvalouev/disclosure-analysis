AOB Issues Comments on Technology Integration
and Cosimo Patti.


Posted on September 30, 2009 by Asensio.com


AOB posted new disclosures on its website titled, “Additional AOBO


Comments on Third Parties [sic] Website Postings.” The response


gives explanations for certain issues relating to AOB’s independent


director Cosimo Patti and a Hong Kong company with which certain


AOB officers are involved.


The company’s statements make clear that AOB was not involved in


providing extra compensation to its independent director Cosimo


Patti, or the business formerly controlled by Patti, Technology


Integration Group, Inc. (“TIG”).


AOB’s new disclosures address Mr. Patti’s role in TIG reporting


revenue in consulting fees from AOB in TIG’s SEC filings. AOB


comments, “What appears to be the case is that certain monies paid


to Mr. Patti (a director of AOB) in respect of director’s fees and


travel and business related expenses were paid over by him to TIG


(presumably pursuant to an arrangement Mr. Patti had with TIG).”


AOB made further comments concerning Silver Linkage Holdings


Ltd. (“Silver”), the Hong Kong company where AOB’s CEO and CFO


are involved. AOB states, “It is also AOB’s understanding that


certain of its officers’ relationships with Silver are in the officer’s


individual capacities and have nothing to do with AOB’s business.”


The AOB statement says that the letter from Patti to Silver referred


to a contract that was never executed.


The only contention concerning Silver in the asensio.com reports


was that the involvement of AOB’s officers in this company should


be disclosed in AOB’s SEC filings.
