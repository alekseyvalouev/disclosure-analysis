Summary

TRUP


Over several reports, I have maintained that TRUP should be valued as an
insurance company, not a SaaS company. Inherently, I don't value the software
component of the company.


My valuation of $10 is based off of the insurance company being valued at 3x book
value.


In this report, I'd like to discuss the definition of solicitation and how the software
"Trupanion Express" interacts with those laws.


It is my belief that the Trupanion Express software could possibly be violating the
solicitation laws at its core, which is a problem that will be very difficult to manage
around.


RCW 48.17.010 (14) "Solicit" means attempting to sell insurance or asking or urging a
person to apply for a particular kind of insurance from a particular insurer.

What is Trupanion Express And Why Do We Care?


What Else Does It Do That Concerns You?


The passage above is section 14 of the Washington State Legislature's definition of
what it means to solicit insurance in the state. In the article below, I question whether the
software "Trupanion Express" inherently violates solicitation clauses. It goes without
saying that I am not a regulator - so my opinion is only as good as my understanding of
the law - but this is a risk that is worthy of conversation. And my insistence that
Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) should be valued as an insurance entity is somewhat
dependent on the belief that the software aspect of the business is garnering too much
support from the sell side and investors alike. I currently value the company at $10 a
share - or ~3x book value.


Trupanion Express is the software backbone of TRUP; the software itself performs
multiple functions for the user, veterinarian clinic, and TRUP.


One of the critical functions of the territory partners is to convince veterinarian clinics to
allow them to download and install "Trupanion Express" so that it can integrate with the
existing Practice Management Systems, such as AVImark, Cornerstone, ImproMed
Infinity, IntraVet Classic, and VIA.


Trupanion Express then serves as a billing interface between TRUP and the veterinarian
hospital, whereby TRUP can quickly adjudicate and pay for claims at the point of sale
should the patient be a TRUP policy holder (Trupanion Express FAQ). There is a totally
valid argument that insurance companies should not be seeking to make claims easier
to pay out (as a business model) but that is for a different day.


Trupanion Express offers the ability of the technician or administrative personnel
handling check out to offer Trupanion Insurance directly to the patient (dog or cat
owner). As you can see in the FAQ below, TRUP advertises the ability to, "email
certificates to your clients with just a few clicks during their visit."

Let's Take A Peek At The Trupanion Express Patent...


Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

Importantly, the software does not allow for the offering of insurance broadly, but
specifically Trupanion insurance.


Specifically, the language supporting Fig. 6.


When the veterinary practice offers the insurance to the pet owner, an employee of
the veterinary practice may enter the insurance offer into the client (201), such as
shown in FIG. 7, and the information about the insurance offer is passed onto the
backend component 106 through the data integration agent (200). (Emphasis added)


It's clear that by clicking the button to offer a certificate, the veterinarian
technician/admin is only able to offer Trupanion insurance to their client. This isn't a link
to some sort of Expedia like pet insurance marketplace. I think the regulation of this
practice is likely an inevitability that will be driven by the growth of the product
instillation. In other words, the growth of Trupanion Express will force regulators (at
some point) to reassess if they want a program that only allows a single insurance
carrier to be offered to the patients.


The definition of "Solicitation" in the State of Washington is fairly straight forward: "RCW
48.17.010 (14) "Solicit" means attempting to sell insurance or asking or urging a person
to apply for a particular kind of insurance from a particular insurer."

It is hard to understand how a program that is patented to only allow the offer of
insurance from a single carrier won't fall under this definition; of course, the remedy is
that the veterinarian clinics will need to have a licensed member of their staff have that
conversation with the pet owner. The question longs should ask is whether that is a
practice the clinic wants to integrate into their business practices. If not - then one will
conclude that there is no moat to the business and we are left with just the insurance
component, which I value at $10/share.
