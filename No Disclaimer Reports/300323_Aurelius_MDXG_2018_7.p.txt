———–


Since last year, we have focused on uncovering the pervasive fraud
that we believe is taking place at MiMedx.  Extensive evidence has
emerged of channel stu�ng, Medicare and coding fraud, anti-
kickback violations, undisclosed related party transactions, and the
systematic harassment of whistleblowers. This report speci�cally
exposes how MiMedx relabels product as a means to provide
kickbacks and induce sales at the expense of patients.


Our last report examined the undisclosed manufacturing problems
uncovered by FDA investigators involving Amnio�x Injectable. 
Although this product is not FDA approved and has no legal basis to
be sold, it is being falsely marketed to unsuspecting patients as a
Stem Cell therapy (the product contains no stem cells).


We subsequently learned that MiMedx is secretly relabeling Amnio�x
injectable as “Amniovo” for distributors and agents to sell (below).

Invoices demonstrate that a Texas distributor named L2 Surgical has
been selling relabeled Amniovo to Hospitals (above). According to a
whistleblower, L2 has sold a substantial amount of MiMedx
product. Two individuals behind L2 Surgical were indicted by the
DOJ as part of a “massive conspiracy” at Forest Park Medical
Center.  Also last year, United Healthcare accused the pair’s
NextHealth group of companies of engaging in a fraudulent billing
scheme and is seeking $100 million in damages.


Note: You should assume that all individuals/entities mentioned in
this report deny the allegations and have not been found guilty of any
crimes.  Above 1: DOJ Indictment Above 2: Qui Tam Suit �led against
L2.   


The fundamental question is why MiMedx is relabeling product for
distributors such as L2 to sell? MiMedx has invested a considerable
amount of time and money to try and build name recognition for its

products, so what possible advantage could distributors gain by
selling MiMedx under obscure brand names?


Whistleblowers we spoke with revealed that MiMedx relabels
product as a means to provide kickbacks to doctors through
Physician Owned Distributors (“PODs”), entities that the HHS OIG has
declared as “inherently suspect” in a special fraud alert.  The PODs
purchase the relabeled MiMedx product at deep discounts and then
sell it to their hospitals/patients at multiples of the current MiMedx
list prices.  These illicit pro�ts are then split between the doctors,
distributors and, the whistleblowers suspect, the MiMedx sales
executives who coordinate these activities.


For example, invoices show that L2 charges $3,366 for one unit of
Amniovo 0.5ml injectable, a price that is more than 6 times the
equivalent MiMedx list price for Amnio�x 0.5ml injectable (below).
The relabeling enables the PODs to overcharge because it obscures
the true identity of the product from hospital administrators who
would otherwise recognize the discrepancy. The whistleblowers
explain that biologic products are especially well-suited for this type
of scheme because there are so many different products and
applications that it is very di�cult for administrators to keep track of.


We have reviewed whistleblower documents which allege a variation
of this scheme involving a different ring of MiMedx agents:


This instance of fraud begins with the delivery of
MiMedx’s AmnioFix 40mg injectable product (the
“AmnioFix Injectable”) to a [Hospital] operating room.

Details of how PODS are created emerged in suits �led against L2 by
Qui Tam relators and a surgeon that L2 allegedly created a POD for.
According to the suits, L2 was able to entice doctors into creating
these entities by demonstrating the pro�tability of owning a POD.
Afterwards, doctors would instruct hospitals to purchase products
and L2 would “shu�e the billing between PODs” and then split the
pro�ts.


Our research leads us to conclude that MiMedx utilizes PODs as
means to catalyze sales and induce usage.  The problem for
patients is that they are being injected with unapproved MiMedx
products principally because their doctor can make a lot of money
from them.  We learned that MiMedx products are also being


An Independent Distributor working for a POD makes
this delivery, and the physician in the operating room
who is about to use the AmnioFix Injectable (the
“Surgeon”) is an investor in the POD… After the
Independent Distributor falsi�es this Tissue Form –
and after the Surgeon implants the tissue in question –
a representative of [Hospital’s[ Materials Management
department signs off on the Form and authorizes
payment to the POD.    As a result of this single
transaction, the POD – which employs the Independent
Distributor, and in which the Surgeon is an investor –
therefore received $2,700 in excess payment. 
Moreover, because [Hospital] subsequently billed
Medicare or Medicaid in this (and almost every other)
instance, Medicare or Medicaid ultimately made this
excess payment.  This is textbook Medicare/Medicaid
fraud.

relabeled under a variety of other names including “AmbioChoice”. In
fact, MiMedx sued after we �rst pro�led AmbioChoice in a
September report that highlighted the product’s ties to Fuse Medical,
a POD owned by prominent podiatrists. Bill Cochrane, a former
MiMedx National Sales Director who now works with MiMedx
distributors including Fuse, told us last summer that AmbioChoice is
“my private label” and is used to “defend our price points”.  MiMedx
denied the existence of this relabeling agreement in court
documents even though the company’s own FDA Tissue Bank �lings
report storing it (and we’ve publicly posted photos of the product).


MiMedx has also denied having any involvement with PODs and is
now attempting to distance itself from the activities of its agents and
distributors. But whistleblowers tell us that company executives are
so defensive because they have orchestrated these activities
themselves, also explaining why former MiMedx sales executives
were placed in control of key distributors and sales agencies.


At minimum, a lengthy series of emails makes clear that senior
MiMedx executives (including Bill Taylor) play an active role in day to
day affairs of distributors and agents. It is therefore inconceivable
that senior management is not aware of these activities or that this
is simply a matter of “rogue employees” or agents.  For example,
Jerry Morrison, a then-current MiMedx Sales Director who now
manages SLR Medical (a large MiMedx distributor) states that “we
have trained 7 reps from Delano Medical”. Corporate records
indicate that Delano has PODs, which is problematic because it
supports allegations that MiMedx trains agents how to create them.
The email goes on to discuss how the agents were allegedly kicked
out of a hospital after being caught smuggling MiMedx product in a
backpack. Bill Taylor states that “I know the sub-distributor did
things he/she shouldn’t have” before encouraging the team to do “the
right thing” and continue to work the distributor.
