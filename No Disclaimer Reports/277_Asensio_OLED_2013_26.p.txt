Universal Display wrongfully denies the
existence of Samsung’s numerous contractual
termination rights.


Posted on November 15, 2013 by asensio.com


Friday, November 15, 2013.   Yesterday at the UBS Global


Technology Conference Universal Display Corporation (“UDC;”


Trading Symbol: OLED) was asked about the possible outcomes for


next week’s crucial trial. UDC repeatedly makes statements to


analysts strongly implying that investors don’t have any reason to


worry about its business being damaged by patent litigation, now or


anytime in the future, and denying that the possibility that their


entire business can be terminated by one international judicial


order scheduled to be rendered next week.


UDC responded by saying that “So, and within our Samsung


contract whether patents get invalidated or opposed or challenged


does not affect our Samsung agreement. And I know there has been


a lot of chatter out there that says Samsung is not going to pay them


and just hidden Samsung agreement. If you actually go to the SEC


website of the redacted version which has pricing and things like


that, you go to Section 4.2 of that and if you read it, it says this


agreement is not invalidated for any reason including losing of


patents or oppositions or challenges. So it’s not going to impact our


Samsung agreement.”  Article 4.2 has nothing to do with Samsung’s


termination rights under the agreement.  It is merely an


acknowledgement they have determined that the fees and methods


they negotiated are reasonable and appropriate.  In fact, the


methods negotiated include many terms that can result in


termination.  While UDC carefully redacted ALL causes of


termination the redacted agreement still contains references to


early termination.

UDC’s Patent License Agreement with Samsung states that a “Valid


Claim” is a claim of a UDC patent that has not been “finally held


unpatentable, invalid or unenforceable by a court or other


government agency of competent jurisdiction” and “excludes any


unpatented inventions, know-how or technical information.” 


Article 4 mentioned by UDC is titled “Consideration” and states that


Samsung shall pay the license fees specified in Exhibit A  and


Exhibit A stated that license fees are subject to the event of any


termination of this Agreement. UDC completely redacted 4.5. 


Article 6.1.5 refers to a termination of the agreement.  Article 8.1


specifically states that the agreement permits termination before


December 31, 2017.  Furthermore, UDC’s materials purchase


agreement with Samsung contains a similar termination term in


Article 2.2 titled “SMD Purchase Commitment” in a references to its


own Exhibit A that refers to a undisclosed cause for termination.


Below is “Section 4.2” referred to by UDC at the UBS Global


Technology Conference:


4.2 Acknowledgement. Both parties acknowledge and agree that the


license fees and the methods by which they are to be paid have


been determined through arm’s length negotiations between the


parties and that such fees and methods are reasonable and


appropriate notwithstanding whether and to what extent any of the


Universal Display Patents have or are in the future issued, expired,


invalidated, modified or limited in any manner in any particular


country in which Licensed Products are made, sold or used, and


notwithstanding the actual number and/or types of License


Products SMD may sell or make during the Term of this Agreement.


Below is a transcript of actually exchange.

Okay. That’s good segue into I guess a topic that everyone cares


about for you guys on IP and patents, a lot of focus right now on the


November 21 or 22 [oral] hearing in Europe. Can you remind us


what’s being challenged, what the status of that case has been to-

date and then to the extent that you can talk to your base case for


what you think the outcome could be?


 


Sidney Rosenblatt


 


That is EPO238 and it is a patent that there was a prior hearing


where the organometallic part was upheld and the osmium part in


the hearing we’ve said, we will take out and that will be part of


another divisional patent that have. The parties who brought the


opposition up, challenged the opinion. And the appeal is on the 21st


and 22nd. As we have always said, we expect the outcome to be


positive. And simply also have said though that the outcome of


anyone patent decision in any single jurisdiction is not going to


affect our ability to license and not affect our existing agreements.


We’ve got 3,000 patents issued in pending worldwide. We’re talking


about one patent in Europe that has a number of patents that are


above it and a number of other patents you would not be able to


make a phosphorescent device just by this patent being completely


invalidated because there is a number of other patents and you


have to make and sell it in Europe. So, and within our Samsung


contract whether patents get invalidated or opposed or challenged


does not affect our Samsung agreement. And I know there has been


a lot of chatter out there that says Samsung is not going to pay them


and just hidden Samsung agreement. If you actually go to the SEC


website of the redacted version which has pricing and things like


that, you go to Section 4.2 of that and if you read it, it says this


agreement is not invalidated for any reason including losing of


patents or oppositions or challenges. So it’s not going to impact our


Samsung agreement. And if somehow the outcome is negative to us,


there are still some channels to appeal it. And we will continue to


do that.
