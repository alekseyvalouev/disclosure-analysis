Medallia Inc. (MDLA) has used M&A to mask rapidly deteriorating 
organic revenue growth.  FY 21 organic growth will be worse than 
we originally estimated and easily the slowest growth rate in 
over a decade.  Shares have over 35.0% downside.                        
 


 
Prescience Point Research Opinions: 
 
• Reiterated FY 21 guidance despite recent M&A implies organic growth is rapidly deteriorating: 


In Feb. 2020, MDLA acquired LivingLens which we estimate will provide ~$10.0 million to FY 21 
revenue.  However, MDLA reiterated FY 21 revenue guidance last week implying organic growth 
will be below 15.0%, lower than we estimated in our Initiation Report and the slowest growth 
rate in over a decade.  As a result, MDLA is now definitively not an “accelerating” growth story.     
 


• M&A used to obfuscate weak underlying growth from core business: Over the last year, MDLA spent $110.8 million on M&A while providing 
little commentary or guidance about the revenue impact from the acquired companies – a stark contrast to the negligible amount 
of M&A done before Mr. Stretch became CEO.  It’s very clear recent M&A has propped up reported revenue growth while obfuscating 
weakening organic growth.     


 
• Path to profitability remains a fairy tale: MDLA remains unprofitable and we continue to believe long-term guidance for non-GAAP 


operating margin of +20.0% is not achievable.  The Company hasn’t been profitable for the last twenty years despite minimal 
competition in its core enterprise business.  It’s unrealistic to believe it can suddenly become profitable, especially as competition is 
just heating up.   


 
• COVID-19 implications could be meaningful, lasting, and very negative: MDLA’s core customers are some of the ones most impacted 


by COVID-19 (and an oil crisis).  A post COVID-19 environment could result in current projects/implementations being pushed out or 
even canceled, less wins as sales teams can’t do client site visits, and lower operating leverage.    


 
• Key executives have unloaded massive stakes since post IPO lock-up expiry: Since the IPO lock-up expired on 01/15/20, MDLA CEO has 


sold over 25.0% of his beneficial ownership and CTO has sold over 20.0%.   
 
• Shares have over 35.0% downside:  We value Medallia’s shares at $12.61, a downside of more than 35.0%.  Recall, less than a year ago 


MDLA’s board, with help from management and an independent valuation firm, valued its common stock at only ~$6.50/share.

MDLA is Not an Accelerating Growth Story: FY 21 Growth Rates Will be the 
Slowest in Over a Decade  


As discussed in our Initiation Report on 01/16/20, Medallia has repeatedly pitched itself as an “accelerating” 
revenue growth story.  While FY 20 certainly saw a brief acceleration, the overwhelming trend since FY 15 has 
been massive deceleration.  Indeed, FY 21 guidance calls for revenue growth of only 18.9% (at midpoint), the 
slowest growth rate in at least a decade.

M&A Continues to Obfuscate Deteriorating Underlying Revenue Growth   


Over the last year, Medallia spent $110.8 million on acquisitions, a stark contrast to the negligible M&A done 
before Mr. Leslie J. Stretch became CEO.  Moreover, Medallia has provided little commentary or guidance 
about the revenue impact from the acquired companies.  It’s very clear recent M&A has propped up reported 
revenue growth while obfuscating rapidly deteriorating underlying growth rates at Medallia’s core business.

We want to be explicitly clear: It’s not that Medallia can’t continue to make acquisitions to augment 
technological capabilities (it has minimal debt), but why would investors pay a rich sales multiple for a 
company with massively decelerating organic growth obfuscated by tuck-in acquisitions guised as 
technology-focused M&A.    
 


Path to Profitability Remains a Fairy Tale  


While Medallia still does not trade on its profitability, the Company regularly trumpeted its margin 
improvement pre-IPO and continues to guide for long-term non-GAAP operating margin of +20.0%.  Recall, 
margin improvement was primarily driven by higher-than-normal capitalized commission costs, not 
operating leverage.  If Medallia hasn’t been profitable for the last twenty years (inclusive of one of the longest 
bull markets and economic expansions in history), what gives it confidence that it can be profitable going 
forward?   
 
In addition, Medallia has faced minimal competition in its core enterprise market as competitors were more 
focused on the mid-market.  However, as we discussed in our Initiation Report, competition from Qualtrics 
and SurveyMonkey is rapidly heating up.

While Medallia has a large and diverse customer base, its core customers are in some of the hardest hit 
industries (e.g. autos & transportation, hospitality & restaurants, retail & consumer goods).  It’s also worth 
mentioning, Medallia has exposure to many energy & industrial companies currently dealing with an oil crisis. 
 


MDLA’s Biggest Customers are in Hospitality, Autos, Transports, Energy & Industrial Services 








Source: Q3 20 Earnings Presentation  


 
We were concerned about rapidly decelerating revenue growth and lack of profitability before COVID-19 and 
an oil crisis.  Consequently, these events have only exacerbated those concerns.  We believe the implications 
could be as follows: 
 


• Current projects/implementations are pushed out and/or extended: As customers focus on more 
pressing issues, current customer experience platform implementations could be extended and/or 
implementations of recent wins could be pushed out or worst case, cancelled.  Extended or pushed 
out implementations could result in delayed revenue recognition, while outright cancellations would 
result in lost revenue.  
 


• Less wins as sales teams can’t do client site visits: As the US and most of the world shifts to working 
remotely for the near-term, wins could drop as sales teams aren’t able to do live client-site pitches 
and presentations.  As we discussed in our Initiation Report, we believe the easiest customer 
additions are already in the customer base and incremental customers will be increasingly more 
difficult to obtain and less likely to spend as much on a customer experience software platform.  
These concerns are only magnified as companies broadly tighten budgets and place increased 
scrutiny on all expenses.  Importantly, given most of Medallia’s customers operate on multi-year 
arrangements (i.e. recurring revenue), lower wins today may not necessarily impact FY 21 revenue 
growth but could have a material impact on future revenue growth.

• Lower operating leverage: If Medallia chooses to maintain its sales team (i.e. no more layoffs), less 
wins would negatively impact operating leverage.  Post-IPO, sales and marketing expense as a 
percentage of revenue ticked up considerably from pre-IPO levels (currently at 48.6% vs. low 40.0%’s 
pre-IPO).   





Key Executives Have Unloaded Massive Stakes Post IPO Lock-Up Expiry  


We warned shareholders that executives and insiders would be looking to monetize their equity by selling 
shares after the IPO lock-up expired on 01/15/20.   
 
CEO Mr. Stretch has sold over 25.0% of his beneficial ownership  
 


• From 01/16/20 through 01/21/20, CEO Mr. Stretch sold over 300,000 shares (>10% of his beneficial 
ownership).  This Form 4 was filed very late after hours on 01/20/20 (i.e. after 5pm PST).

• From 01/22/20 through 01/24/20, CEO Mr. Stretch sold more than 265,000 shares, bringing his total

also filed on a Friday night.

We believe it’s important to highlight these Form 4s were filed either late after hours and/or on a Friday night.  
In our experience, documents filed in the late evenings and especially on Friday are more likely to be 
overlooked or missed by investors.  In some cases, companies use this to their advantage to hide or minimize 
the publicity of certain filings.      
 


Valuation: Medallia’s Shares Have Over 35.0% Downside  


Medallia’s shares currently trade at 6.7x CY 20E EV/Sales vs. the peer group average of 8.2x.  Premium (and 
even average) priced peers can be broken down into two major categories: (1) those with above average 
revenue growth but negligible/no profitability (e.g. AVLR, COUP, PLAN, SMAR) and (2) those with below 
average/average revenue growth but meaningful profitability (e.g. ADBE, CYBR, FVIN, WDAY).   
 
Medallia doesn’t fit in either category, below average revenue growth and gross margin and no profitability.   
In addition, FY 21 organic growth is even worse than we originally estimated.  As discussed, we now estimate 
FY 21 organic revenue growth will be 14.6%, 430 basis points lower than what we estimated in our Initiation

of the peer group and at a discount to our previous multiple (5.5x).
