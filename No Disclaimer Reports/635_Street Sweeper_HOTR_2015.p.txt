Chanticleer Holdings: Turning Down The Fire

Summary


HOTR stock grew hot primarily through two Seeking Alpha pieces. Once the fire dies
down – and it will - retail investors will exit.


Despite promotional and company assertions to the contrary, profitability at any point
is questionable, according to SEC filings.


Dilution appears imminent as the company just filed registration papers for $15
million-worth of stock, warrants, etc. to be sold on the open market at any time.


A total of 900,000 looming stock warrants will allow two big shareholders to sell out
of HOTR stock completely.


Virtually no significant institutional interest, lawsuits, another late financial report
round out the list of negatives hitting this small, overly promoted company.


Chanticleer Holdings (HOTR) has recently been scorching hot. Yet its business plan is so
cold, it could have frozen the raunchy wit right off legendary sex symbol Mae West.


But let's assume she would have fluttered her eyelashes, patted a blond wave and
recovered quickly enough to reveal the secrets of the North Carolina company that owns
46 company-owned and franchise locations, including 13 Hooters, six American Burger
Co. restaurants, plus seven Just Fresh and 20 BGR locations.


We'll let Mae and other voluptuous sirens help unveil some risks slinking up on HOTR.


*HOTR's Nothing Without You, Seeking Alpha.


"Plastic surgeons are always making mountains out of molehills," Dolly Parton once said.
When it comes to HOTR, just substitute "Seeking Alpha authors" for "plastic surgeons"
and you get the idea.


In an interview with the chief executive published April 16, for example, a Seeking Alpha
author prompted CEO Mike Pruitt to hype HOTR's far-from-beautiful financials this way:

When profitability is reached, what is your philosophy on use of cash? Returned via
cash dividends or buybacks, or 100% retained for possible future acquisitions?
When do you expect the company to be in a position to return cash to shareholders?


Really? Profitability? Following year after year of losses, now exceeding $21 million? Mr.
Pruitt replied:


If we cannot find accretive acquisitions, which for the foreseeable future I cannot
imagine, it would be to return cash to shareholders via dividends.


Despite posting a bigger loss of $2.6 million last quarter amid bigger expenses, Mr. Pruitt
previously said they believe efforts such as acquisitions will "lead us to achieve profitability
by year end." Yet SEC filings say HOTR may never make a dime:


We have not been profitable to date and expect our operating losses to continue for
the foreseeable future; we may never be profitable.


Operating losses may continue for the foreseeable future: we may never be
profitable.


While HOTR's serial acquisition habit (~10 general acquisitions since 2011, ) did bump
revenue to $28 million last year, HOTR still found itself digging deeper into net losses for
the year - a long, long way from profitability, as this chart shows:


HOTR 2014 2013


Cash balance $246K $443K


Net Loss $ 6.6 m $5.4m


Salary & benefits $2.0 m $1.0m

HOTR fans seemed to be buying into Mae West's come-hither contention: "Cultivate your
curves - they may be dangerous but they won't be avoided."


Indeed, HOTR was just getting warmed up.

Not to be outdone, FinancialBuzz flew in on its website with its exclusive interview hyped
March 30 with a PR Newswire promo.


Another author added his twist to the Seeking Alpha piece about two weeks later, boosting
the stock about 10 percent.


Establishments of good repute, as Ms. West might have called them, don't have a hype
machine huffing out promotional material. They don't need it.


*Dilution Likely Coming


We've seen that certain hunger for cash in HOTR's financials, exacerbated by its serial
acquisition habit. But roll-up companies often find acquisitions divert management
attention and cost more than they're ultimately worth - particularly risky when the
company's cash has dwindled down to $246,000.


Shortly after the puff pieces had a chance to do some magic, the company filed an April
27 registration statement that will allow it to peel off $15 million worth of stock, warrants,
etc. from time to time. It's already signed a letter of intent presumably to chew into some of
those shares with a deal to acquire eight Better Burger stores.


As startling as this potential dilution may be, it's nothing new. The company's SEC filings
are crowded with descriptions of stock offerings and convertible debt, including
convertibles in January, February and March.


In fact, HOTR just completed a $7.8 million rights offering for 3.9 million shares of
common stock.


So the potential dilution looming ahead is business as usual to a serial stock issuer like
HOTR.


*900,000 Warrants Loom


Additionally, HOTR is getting 900,000 warrants for stock ready so that selling shareholders
can strip away shares of the company very soon.


We'll explain below our misgivings about HOTR's lack of larger investors. But the warrant
deal is extra worrisome because two big shareholders - At Media Corp. and Aton Select
Fund Ltd. - will shed 180,000 shares and 720,000 shares respectively. That means, as
shown on page 19, both plan to dump all their shares that cost $2-$2.50.

Well, maybe the upcoming wave of potentially dilutive actions amounts to what Ms. West
once purred: "The best way to behave is to misbehave."


*Virtually No Institutional Following


Institutional and mutual fund interest in a company is something to check on, particularly
when an unknown company suddenly gets a brief flurry of undeserved attention.


Here's the institutional interest in HOTR:

What's so wrong with HOTR attracting virtually no attention from the big boys who can
grab shares at a discount to everyone else?


They've got more interesting trades to make. And the share rallies that occur primarily on
Seeking Alpha articles indicate that retail investors - the average Joes and Joans who lack
the time and expertise to conduct heavy due diligence - will be stuck with the bar tab when
all the other folks go running off in search of the next big show.


*Lawsuit, Late 10-Q and Material Weakness Issues


Finally, early signs of deeper troubles may show themselves in the form of lawsuits, late
financial filings and especially material weakness disclosures. Investors can see a settled
lawsuit here, and another under appeal here for HOTR.


HOTR just got out its 10-Q … finally. It shows net loss for the quarter jumped to $2.4
million (from $1.5 million loss prior year), revenue up to $8.7 million versus $5.3 million
previously, cash at $3.3 million and notes HOTR is trying to address material weaknesses
