New Paci�c is an exploration-stage silver mining company that is at least 10 years away


from production. Its only active exploration projects are based in Bolivia.


Since acquiring its Bolivian assets, its stock has surged almost 400%. We believe the sharp


move higher has been largely fueled by grandiose claims in newsletters and paid


promotion campaigns targeted toward retail investors.


The company is led by CEO Rui Feng, who is concurrently Chairman/CEO of Silvercorp.


Feng’s history raises signi�cant red �ags. It includes historical allegations of in�ating silver


grades and using state in�uence to have a former short seller jailed in China for almost 2


years.


Our review of New Paci�c’s Bolivian deals shows that the mining concessions on its


�agship property had previously been stripped from their previous holder by the state


and were never fully restored, leaving the property in a state of legal limbo.


All of the company’s deals in Bolivia seem to violate laws on the purchase/sale of


concessions. Unlike in the U.S. and Canada, Bolivia does not permit the sale or transfer of

mining concessions privately. Each deal requires state approval.


New Paci�c had a strong relationship with the Bolivian government at the time it


purchased its mining concessions, which seemingly enabled it to bypass the law.


However, in late 2019 the ‘friendly’ administration was ousted via coup, with the President


and Minister of Mines �eeing to Mexico.


The new administration has publicly accused the previous Minister of Mines of


corruption, speci�cally relating to his dealings with New Paci�c’s Bolivian subsidiary. The


new administration has launched a criminal investigation into the Minister.


We spoke with multiple legal and political sources as part of our analysis. A former Senior


Legal Advisor to the State Mining Authority (AJAM) told us: “My understanding is that (New


Paci�c’s Bolivian entity) has been operating outside the law since these areas were


revoked in 2015.”


We brought the issues up with Victor Borda, former speaker of the lower house and a


prominent member of the majority legislative party. He said “If concession-holders do not


respect the rules then those areas return to the state.” He suggested he may launch a


parliamentary inquiry.


The former head of the Bolivian State Mining Corporation (COMIBOL) told us “Unless


there’s a (comprehensive) framework regulation, I personally don’t think (the New Paci�c


deal) will get approved by Parliament.”


Our base case is that New Paci�c has its concessions and agreements with the state


revoked entirely or negotiated on far less favorable terms.


Even if the company retains its concessions (which we don’t think it will) New Paci�c


shares trade at vastly in�ated levels, representing 85% downside on a purely fundamental


basis.


All told, we see 90%+ downside for shares of New Paci�c and 25%-45% downside for


shares of related Silvercorp, which owns almost a 29% stake in the company.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of New Paci�c


Metals and Silvercorp through their U.S.-listed equities (OTC:NUPMF and NYSE:SVM). This report


represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence. Please see our


full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.


Basics on the Business and the Bull Thesis


New Paci�c Metals Corp. (TSXV:NUAG, OTC:NUPMF) is an exploration-stage silver mining


company focused on what it calls its “�agship property” in Bolivia, known as the Silver Sand


Project (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/silver-sand-project). The company is not actively


exploring or developing any properties other than its Bolivian properties. [Pg. 7-8

The company obtained the concessions to its Bolivian project in mid-2017 by acquiring a local


Bolivian entity from a Chinese company [Pg. 6 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=1&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=02968698&docId=4594

interim drilling results of its Bolivian properties and other periodic updates.


Since announcing (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2017/4/10/new-paci�c-

stock has gained almost 400%.


The excitement has been encouraged by multiple paid promotion campaigns and newsletters


that have relentlessly touted the company’s prospects in Bolivia:

NYSE-listed production-stage silver mining company.

also a NYSE-listed production-stage silver mining company with a major mine in Bolivia


(https://www.panamericansilver.com/operations/south-america/san-vicente/).


Recent unprecedented in�ationary moves by central banks, which have increased interest


in hard assets (we at Hindenburg own both gold and silver).


All told, investors see a strong management team, backing from major producers and an


in�ationary tailwind all supporting New Paci�c’s quest to �nd the pot of silver at the end of the


Bolivian rainbow.


Reality Check: New Paci�c May Not Have Secure Control of
Any of Its Bolivian Projects, A History of Stock Promotion
(And 85% Fundamental Downside Even if It Did Control the
Assets)


We think New Paci�c’s largely retail investor base is entirely unaware of a multitude of red �ags


surrounding the company. In this report, we will show that:


New Paci�c faces a signi�cant existential risk; it may have violated Bolivian law in its


acquisition of mining concessions, including its �agship property, putting them at risk of


being stripped by the Bolivian government.


Furthermore, the entity that New Paci�c acquired in Bolivia previously had its mining


concessions stripped by the state. Those concessions appear to have never been fully


restored, creating another legal hurdle for the company.


The Bolivian administration that had previously worked with New Paci�c on its


questionable concession deals was recently ousted via coup, with the former


administration’s President and Minister of Mining �eeing to Mexico.


Bolivia’s new administration has accused the former administration of corruption


speci�cally relating to New Paci�c’s mining deals.


New Paci�c’s CEO has been previously been accused of in�ating the silver grades of his


mines and engaging in suspect related-party transactions.


There is signi�cant related-party overlap between Silvercorp and New Paci�c, including a


former Silvercorp employee leading an “independent” technical report of New Paci�c’s



https://newpacificmetals.com/managementpage

http://silvercorpmetals.com/company/management/

https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/5/22/new-pacific-raises-19950000-from-exercise-of-warrants-by-pan-american-silver-and-silvercorp

https://www.panamericansilver.com/operations/south-america/san-vicente/
�agship Bolivian property, and multiple questionable related party deals.


New Paci�c appears to be engaged in proli�c paid stock promotion, leading to a massive


fundamental overvaluation even exclusive of the other issues outlined in this report.


The most obviously alarming conclusion we’ve drawn from our research is that New Paci�c


may not have secure control of any of its properties in Bolivia.


Further, our review of the company’s deals shows that its purchases of mining concessions,


including those for its �agship property (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/silver-sand-project),


Silver Sand, may have been illegal under Bolivian law.


We also learned that Silver Sand didn’t seem to have a clear title to its mining concessions in


the �rst place before they were supposedly transferred to New Paci�c; instead, they had


already been revoked due to a prior illegal purchase and appear to have never been fully


restored.


We spoke about these deals with multiple legal and political experts, including Bolivian


legislator Victor Borda, former speaker of the lower House and a prominent member of the


majority MAS Party. He told us he would consider launching a Parliamentary inquiry into the


matter, and explained:


“If this company sold areas that had already been revoked and reverted to the state


then that would be very serious, quite simply it would be an act of corruption. I don’t


understand how the Ministry of Mines has allowed this type of operation and the


exploitation of mineral wealth if the areas had reverted to the state.”


The issue, it seems, may have been that New Paci�c had a close relationship to the prior


Bolivian administration, which allegedly engaged in acts of corruption and turned a blind eye to


deals that violated Bolivian law.


That friendly support changed however, when that administration was ousted via coup


(https://www.npr.org/2019/11/13/778842712/evo-morales-condemns-coup-after-lawmaker-


assumes-bolivia-s-interim-presidency) late last year. The Mines Minster was also ousted and


soon faced a barrage of allegations of corruption and fraud, including relating speci�cally to the


deals with New Paci�c. He then �ed to Mexico


(https://www.infolibre.es/noticias/mundo/2020/02/01/bolivia_rati�ca_salvoconducto_mexico_p

We see little chance of the new administration looking favorably upon the alleged corrupt and


illegal dealings made between the past administration and New Paci�c. Consequently, we see a


high chance that all of the company’s mining claims are revoked or renegotiated on


substantially worse terms.


Meanwhile, we have also identi�ed red �ags relating to New Paci�c’s CEO, Rui Feng. Feng has


been accused (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-


strange-case-of-alfred-little/article24443237/) in the past of  in�ating the silver grades of his


mines and of questionable related-party transactions at Silvercorp, where he concurrently


serves as Chairman/CEO.


The two companies have multiple parallels, including shared board members


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/directorspage), shared o�ce space, [Pg. 12


(https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664


924)] and shared contacts. Per the Canadian SEDAR pro�les of each company, they also share a


mailing address and a primary point of contact [1 (https://www.sedar.com/DisplayPro�le.do?


lang=EN&issuerType=03&issuerNo=00006180),2 (https://www.sedar.com/DisplayPro�le.do?


lang=EN&issuerType=03&issuerNo=00006210)]:


Silvercorp owns about 29% of New Paci�c, according to a recent management circular, [Pg. 6


(https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=10&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=02980434&docId=461


2610)] comprising over 23% of Silvercorp’s market capitalization.


We also found troubling red �ags when comparing the two companies. For example, the


“independent” geologist (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?

worked for Silvercorp for 3.5 years as its VP of Exploration, according to his LinkedIn pro�le


(https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruijin-jiang-145a9334/?originalSubdomain=ca).


Additionally, prior to New Paci�c’s Bolivian endeavors, it had purchased 3 Chinese mining


projects from Silvercorp. New Paci�c issued years of positive press releases about these


‘exciting’ projects, but in the end, they all �zzled out. As we detail later, the projects were


respectively suspended, sold at a loss, or surrendered back to the local government. [Pg. 2


(https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?

924)]


The company’s Bolivian projects are the latest ‘exciting’ projects that have sent the stock


soaring (with the help of multiple paid promotion campaigns and newsletters). New Paci�c


appears to be at least 10 years away from commercialization


(https://elfulgor.com/noticia/649/new-paci�c-holdings-corp-y-comibol-suscribieron-contrato-


para-explotar-la-mina-de-plata-alicia), if any of its projects do make it to that point.


Finally, we have found that New Paci�c’s valuation when compared to peers – assuming the


business is operating legally without any issues at all – is at least ~7x too high.


The company recently released (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-


media/2020/4/14/new-paci�c-metals-reports-inaugural-resource-estimate-for-the-silver-sand-


deposit-bolivia) its maiden resource estimate, which showed that Silver Sand contains a total of


only 191 million ounces of silver, well below average analyst expectations of 223 million. We


used this resource estimate (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2020/4/14/new-


paci�c-metals-reports-inaugural-resource-estimate-for-the-silver-sand-deposit-bolivia) to


assess its valuation, and found it is trading at ~17x its mining peers:

Here are the projects we reviewed for comparison:


We also hired a mining expert to provide a full technical report on Silver Sand, which can be


found in Part III of this report.
Given the company’s outrageous valuation when compared to peers, we see fundamental


downside of 85%. When factoring in the uncertainty around its Bolivian concessions and


management red �ags, we see 90%+ downside.


Part I: New Paci�c Doesn’t Appear to Actually
Control Its Bolivian Concessions and We Think
It’s Unlikely That It Ever Will


The biggest issue we see with the company is that New Paci�c may not have control over its


Bolivian silver projects.


The key problem is that in order to control mining areas (concessions) in Bolivia, companies


must negotiate them legally in conjunction with the state mining corporation (COMIBOL) and


the national mining authority (AJAM). For new mining areas, companies must also receive


approval from the legislature.


New Paci�c does not appear to have acquired its concessions legally, as we will show.


Furthermore, on its �agship Silver Sand property, the concessions had already been revoked


from its prior holder and do not appear to have been fully restored; meaning that New


Paci�c appears to be sitting on concessions that are, at best, in a state of legal limbo.


Additionally, while New Paci�c received approval from COMIBOL for a large, new mining deal in


early 2019 it never received legislative approval. Before it could, a coup ejected the Bolivian


government it had been working with and pulled the rug out from the company (and likely its


legislative approval).


New Paci�c’s Deal for Its Largest Bolivian Assets Was Never
Rati�ed by the Legislature. Rights to Its “Flagship”
Property, Silver Sand, Also Looked Tenuous to Begin With


None of that Seemed to Matter at the Time. New Paci�c Had
a Very Friendly Relationship with the Government,
Including the Minister of Mines, Cesar Navarro


New Paci�c acquired Bolivian mining entity Alcira in 2017 for $45 million


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2017/7/20/new-paci�c-closes-acquisition-of-


alcira-change-of-business-and-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change). That deal was



https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2017/7/20/new-pacific-closes-acquisition-of-alcira-change-of-business-and-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change
focused on a small 3.17 km  core area that New Paci�c refers to as the Silver Sand Project


(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/10/1982401/0/en/Summary-of-


Exploration-Activities-in-New-Paci�c-s-100-Owned-Silver-Sand-Project-and-Acquisitions-and-


Agreements-Outside-the-Silver-Sand-Project.html), which we detail further below.


In January 2019, New Paci�c announced (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-


media/2019/1/11/new-paci�c-metals-expands-land-position-for-silver-sand-project-through-


mining-production-contract-with-comibol) it had reached a large deal with state mining


company COMIBOL, and signed a contract for a much larger swath of surrounding land – an


additional  mining area of ~57 km .


The deal was reportedly (https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/bolivia-new-paci�c-sign-


mining-exploration-jv) the �rst foreign company to sign a new contract with COMIBOL since


President Evo Morales took o�ce in 2006.


The Minister of Mines, Cesar Navarro, appears to have been instrumental in the process. In


2019 he held two separate signing ceremonies


(http://mineria.gob.bo/documentos/noticias.php?


pvnoticia=996&codigo=eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNT


E2MjM5MDIyfQ) for the contract between New Paci�c and COMIBOL. At the signing ceremony


(https://fmbolivia.com.bo/minera-niega-sociedad-con-el-exministro-cesar-navarro/) of a


January 2019 agreement for mining rights to the 57 sq. km area of land, New Paci�c President


Gordon Neal stated (https://fmbolivia.com.bo/minera-niega-sociedad-con-el-exministro-cesar-


navarro/) that he:


“commend[s] the Minister of Mines and Metallurgy and the President of COMIBOL for


committed focus to complete this transaction.  It is a benchmark achievement that


shows that Bolivia is open to foreign investment.”


Here is a picture from one signing ceremony showing Navarro, along with New Paci�c


President Gordon Neal and New Paci�c’s Bolivian country manager Hernan Uribe:

Things were progressing relatively smoothly and it seemed as though the company was on


track to win legislative approval to secure and begin exploiting its new, expanded mining areas.


The Administration it Was Working with on These Deals

But the deal wasn’t sent to Bolivian parliament to be rati�ed until September 2019


(http://www.cabildeodigital.com/2020/01/navaro-y-alcira-un-noviazgo-entorno-al-4.html). And


before it had a chance to be approved, the October 20, 2019 national elections


(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_general_election) catalyzed a political upheaval in


the country.


In November 2019, the Bolivian administration that New Paci�c had closely worked with, led by


President Evo Morales, was ejected (https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/evo-morales-


lost-bolivia-191125150055701.html) in what was described as a coup


(https://www.npr.org/2019/11/13/778842712/evo-morales-condemns-coup-after-lawmaker-

In Potosi, where New Paci�c’s mining operations are based, the electoral court building in the


region was burned to the ground (https://elpotosi.net/local/20191021_incendian-el-edi�cio-del-

The New Administration Has Accused the Old
Administration of Acts of Corruption Relating Speci�cally
to New Paci�c’s Bolivian Subsidiary, Alcira.


Former President Evo Morales and Minister of Mines Cesar
Navarro Have Since Fled to Mexico.


Immediately following the coup, Evo Morales �ed to Mexico. His Minister of Mines, Cesar


Navarro – who over the last decade had become part of the President’s trusted inner circle –


took refuge in the Mexican Embassy residence in Bolivia and �nally managed to escape


(https://www.infolibre.es/noticias/mundo/2020/02/01/bolivia_rati�ca_salvoconducto_mexico_p


ara_dos_miembros_del_gobierno_evo_morales_tras_una_breve_detencion_103513_1022.html)


to Mexico himself in February this year.


Just days before he �ed, the new Minister of Mines Carlos Huallpa publicly accused


Navarro of corruption relating to the Alcira deal (the subsidiary of New Paci�c). Navarro


was also being threatened with criminal charges of tra�cking political in�uence, relating to


allegations he helped rig the results of the October 2019 elections. Per a Google translated


version of media reports (https://www.elciudadano.com/latino-america/viajaran-a-mexico-

(https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20200121/ministro-mineria-revela-que-

Both former Minister Navarro and Minera Alcira SA denied the improper association with


Minera Alcira saying (https://fmbolivia.com.bo/minera-niega-sociedad-con-el-exministro-cesar-


navarro/):



https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20200121/ministro-mineria-revela-que-cesar-navarro-era-socio-estrategico-empresa

“Cesar Navarro, former Minister of Mining, does not have or has never, directly or


indirectly, had a strategic partnership with Alcira or any company in which New


Paci�c Metals Corp participates”.


We Spoke with Multiple Local Sources to Get A Better Sense
of the Political Risk to New Paci�c Investors and Details on
the Corruption Allegations. As a Result, We Believe Silver
Sands’ Mining Production Contract May Never Be Rati�ed.


We hired local consultants, including international investigation �rm Kreller Group


(https://www.kreller.com/index.aspx), to perform checks with local sources and o�cials to


further understand the corruption investigation and potential political risk to New Paci�c.


We wanted to learn whether the company’s much-publicized 57 km  mining production


contract will ever be rati�ed and what the implications are for tenure at the core 3.17 km


Silver Sand Project.


What we found is that the political risk is high. In fact, our base case is that New Paci�c’s deal


for the expanded mining area will never be rati�ed. We also expect the Silver Sand property will


be contested and, if any deal is ever approved, we expect the economics to be materially


worse.


Multiple sources we spoke with also indicated that there was potential for graft in the kind of


deal Navarro’s ministry was putting together with Alcira, thus lending credence to the


allegations.


Former COMIBOL Chairman Hector Cordova: “Unless
There’s A (Comprehensive) Framework Regulation, I
Personally Don’t Think (The New Paci�c Deal) Will Get
Approved by Parliament”


We spoke with former COMIBOL chairman (2011-2012) and former Vice Minister of Mines


(2010-2011) Hector Cordova (https://www.metalbulletin.com/events/details/e001265/22nd-


zinc-and-its-markets-seminar/speaker-details/a0rd0000002jwjnmai/hector-cordova.html).


Cordova predicted the New Paci�c contract may prove di�cult to pass even if or when


parliament debates it. Here are some quotes from our interview with Cordova:

https://www.metalbulletin.com/events/details/e001265/22nd-zinc-and-its-markets-seminar/speaker-details/a0rd0000002jwjnmai/hector-cordova.html
“The (New Paci�c-COMIBOL) contract had been under review by other parts of


government that saw the percentage (of state-take) as very low. Others wanted a


framework regulation in place before they gave their approval because they wanted


to understand the basis for the calculation for approving this percentage (of pro�t


split).”


“The contract is currently suspended. It’s been signed by COMIBOL and the


company but without (parliamentary) approval it does not enter into e�ect.


Until there’s a framework regulation, I personally don’t think this will get


approved by parliament.”


“I think there’s a lack of political will and technical capacity to produce something this


subtle (the framework regulation). Right now all the heads of mining are from the


cooperative sector and they’re the least technically prepared for this.”


“That’s a great limitation and it will be an obstacle to drawing up a coherent proposal.


I think it would be more practical to wait for a new government and new legislation.


But of course we’re subject to coronavirus now. Everything has been left hanging in


the air.”


Bolivian Journalist Who Reports on the Local Mining
Industry: “My Personal Opinion is that Cesar Navarro is
Totally Corrupt”


A local reporter focused on the mining industry in Bolivia �agged speci�c irregularities with the


New Paci�c deal that he believed indicated corruption.


In particular, mining companies under (Article 148) the 2014 mining law


(https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO-L-N535.html?dcmi_identi�er=BO-L-N535&format=html) are


required to pay 55% of the income (pro�t) from a mine to the state if it has a joint venture


agreement. New Paci�c somehow managed to negotiate what was termed a mining production


contract with a payment of only 4% of gross production value going to COMIBOL. [Pg. 2


(https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664

https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO-L-N535.html?dcmi_identifier=BO-L-N535&format=html

https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664924
While that low percentage comes o� the top line sales (rather than bottom line net income),


the reporter indicated that the deal results in a signi�cantly lower proportion of overall


proceeds to the state:


“My personal opinion is that Cesar Navarro is totally corrupt and even more politically


protected by President Evo Morales himself (another great corrupt too).”


“…Particularly in the case of Minera Alcira and Cesar Navarro, the secrecy with which


they handled the issue and the speed of procedures in all administrative instances, to


grant prospecting areas, is very suspicious. This fact clearly shows Navarro’s interest


in Minera Alcira.”


This analysis was also corroborated by local media articles


(http://www.cabildeodigital.com/2020/01/navarro-envio-proyecto-de-ley-la-alp.html) at the


time.


Political Advisor to the New Bolivian Government:
According to the Current Minister of Mines, There Was a
Government-Based Group that Had an Economic Interest
in Obtaining Money from Alcira


Our investigators also spoke to a political advisor to the new administration to get a sense of


what areas might be under investigation, and whether any preliminary �ndings indicated that


corrupt acts took place.


We also asked what type of interests Cesar Navarro would have had in Minera Alcira. Our


source reported that according to the current mining minister, there was a group called “INTI”


in the Ministry of Mining which had an economic interest in obtaining money from Minera


Alcira, helped facilitate the New Paci�c’s concessions and charged for doing so. This statement


was also corroborated by local media articles


(https://www.paginasiete.bo/economia/2020/1/22/exministro-navarro-era-socio-de-la-minera-


alcira-244197.html) at the time.


They pointed out that Navarro’s appointment to the position of Minister of Mining was political,


as he “does not have the technical or moral training for such a sensitive position.”



http://www.cabildeodigital.com/2020/01/navarro-envio-proyecto-de-ley-la-alp.html

https://www.paginasiete.bo/economia/2020/1/22/exministro-navarro-era-socio-de-la-minera-alcira-244197.html
Prior to his appointment as Minister of Mining in 2014, Navarro did not have experience in the


sector. He and his brother were experienced regional political operatives in their hometown of


Potosi and between 2010 and his appointment to the mining portfolio, he was in charge of


mass, grassroots political organizing under direct control of the President’s o�ce.


Former Minister of Mines: “Navarro Was One of the Most
Corrupt Ministers There Has Been.” [He Was] “Always Open
For Business”.


As a socialist government and part of the Latin American leftist alliance with Venezuela, Cuba,


Ecuador and Nicaragua, Evo Morales’ administration gave the impression that it was hostile to


doing business with foreign multinationals. Yet New Paci�c was the �rst foreign company to


sign a new contract with state-run COMIBOL since Morales took o�ce in 2006.


A former Minister of Mines told us Cesar Navarro, despite his leftist credentials, was “always


open for business”. He further said:


“I think this contract was more an initiative of Minister Navarro than of the MAS Party.


Cesar Navarro has been one of the most corrupt ministers that there has been. The


most probable thing is that he has asked for money from New Paci�c. But that he’s


actually a shareholder? I don’t think so…


“…The policy of the MAS Party was seen as anti-business but I have many business


acquaintances who have had a good relationship with Cesar Navarro. There was


always a �uid dialog.”


In Addition to The Corruption Scandal, We Found That New
Paci�c’s Purchase of Mining Concessions May Have Been
in Open Violation of Bolivian Laws


Thus far, we have reviewed allegations of corruption relating to New Paci�c’s Bolivian mining


dealings. Beyond this, however, our work has found that New Paci�c’s concession deals were in


apparent violation of Bolivian law, which strengthens the case that New Paci�c’s mining rights


may never get �nal approval.
Background on Bolivian Mining Law: Unlike in The U.S.
And Canada, Bolivia Does Not Permit the Sale or Transfer
of Mining Concessions Privately. Each Deal Requires State
Approval


Unlike most other mining economies, Bolivia does not permit the sale or transfer of mining


areas (formerly known as concessions). This di�ers from normal practices in Canada and the


U.S., where junior mining companies can own and develop land and sell it to a major producer.


Contrary to that approach, mining wealth, including surface and subsurface rights, are deemed


to be the property of the Bolivian people, a notion prevalent since the 1952 nationalization


(https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/26/world/bolivia-struggles-with-its-tin-mines.html) of


private mines but reinforced after the socialist Evo Morales came to power in 2006.


The Constitutional Court ruling 0032 of May 10, 2006, the 2009 Constitution and the 2014


Mining Law 535 state clearly that mining areas (formerly known as concessions) cannot be


“transferred, mortgaged or inherited”.


From the 2009 Constitution [translated to English


(https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Bolivia_2009.pdf)]:


The 2014 Mining (https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO-L-N535.html?dcmi_identi�er=BO-L-


N535&format=html) Law Art. 5 (c) sets out the “basic principles of the mining law” and


reiterates: “non-transferability of mining areas”.


A key reason behind these rules was to prevent private individuals or companies from


acquiring mining areas/concessions from the state mining company COMIBOL, sitting on them


as a nest-egg and then selling them on at a large pro�t to actual mining companies.


The laws were e�ectively aimed at removing those people who were acting as private


middlemen for state-owned resources.

New Paci�c’s Purchase of Silver Sand Looks As Though It
Violated Bolivian Law on the Sale of Concessions


Given the above, a key legal question emerges in relation to New Paci�c’s $45 million purchase


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2017/7/20/new-paci�c-closes-acquisition-of-


alcira-change-of-business-and-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change) of Alcira, the


Bolivian entity that controlled the company’s �agship Silver Sand property: did New Paci�c pay


in order to acquire its concessions (which would likely be illegal) or was the price tag purely to


acquire the assets of Alcira?


The answer seems quite clear. The information circular detailing New Paci�c’s acquisition of


Alcira showed that the entity had total assets of only $84,131 just prior to the acquisition: [Pg.


62 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=10&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=02638002&docId=413


3188)]


Similarly, since Alcira’s creation in 2008, it had never generated any income and had conducted


only very limited exploration. The prior holders drilled only 8 core holes totaling 2,334 meters.


[Pg. 19

no major ongoing operations being acquired either.

announces-a-private-placement-of-us32-million) that described the rationale for the deal


corroborates that the deal included concessions. It described Alcira as having seven Temporary


Special Authorizations (essentially concessions), which seems to make the intent clear.


Furthermore, this is made all the more obvious to us given that New Paci�c paid ~85x


more for Alcira than its prior holders (China-based Ningde Jungie, which paid $530,000).


We emailed New Paci�c and asked for clari�cation on how its purchase of Alcira di�ered from


other deals that saw concessions stripped and have not received an answer as of this writing.


All told, it looks like the company’s �rst step toward development in the region may have been


in violation of Bolivian law. At the time, this may have been something the administration


ignored, but with the changing political landscape this represents a clear risk to investors.


The Prior Holder of the Alcira Silver Sand Concessions Had
Allegedly Purchased Them in Violation of the
Constitution. As A Result, Those Areas Were Stripped by the
State.


They Do Not Appear to Have Been Fully Restored, Placing
the Company’s Flagship Property in a State of Legal Limbo.


Controversy surrounding New Paci�c’s Bolivian entity (Minera Alcira SA) is nothing new. Our


research revealed that the entity has been contested for years amidst allegations of the illegal


transfer of mining concessions.


Minera Alcira (https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/�nancial-


report/188074/content) was formed in mid-2008, according to Bolivian corporate records


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KpbFGnq53iIZa2).[1] It was originally jointly controlled by a


company called Minera Tirex, run by former Minister of Mines Jaime Eduardo Villalobos, and


the ex-wife and an employee of another former Minister of Minues Oscar Bonifaz. [Pg. 27


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KpbFGnq53iIZa2)]


Villalobos is still facing criminal corruption charges (https://www.edictos.bo/edicto-hace-

Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who �ed into exile (https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-


world/ct-xpm-2012-09-07-sns-rt-us-bolivia-usabre88614o-20120907-story.html) in the face of


criminal charges, including corruption, during a wave of privatizations.


In 2010, a Chinese entity called Ningde Jungie Mineria Co., Ltd bought Alcira from Tirex, paying


$530,000, according to the deed of sale (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2T3xQTqHt93zOr)


and local media reports (https://www.paginasiete.bo/economia/2015/10/6/detectan-areas-


mineras-fueron-transferidas-terceros-72503.html).[2]


Recall from above that it is illegal in Bolivia to outright sell mining concessions (as concessions


require approval from the state). Page two of the deed


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2T3xQTqHt93zOr) of sale seemed to openly violate these


rules, stating:


“Mining concessions. There are 17 mining concessions registered and included in the


assets of Alcira Minera SA.”


Shortly thereafter it states:


“17 concessions are included in the company’s assets and these have been duly


entered into the Mining Register and Rights of Potosi under the name Alcira SA”.


It then lists the 17 concessions by name in a tabulated format.


In a 2011 obligatory baseline environmental impact study


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/urtluAgitPQ3zk), drawn up by Bolivian Environment Ministry


engineers, those concessions still appeared in the name of individual concession-holders,


including Oscar Bonifaz’s son, Roberto Bonifaz. [pgs. 13-14


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/urtluAgitPQ3zk)]


In May 2015, the newly-created Bolivian mining authority (Autoridad Jurisdiccional


Administrativa Minera, or “AJAM”) took notice, and revoked the concessions

Alcira’s original directors and shareholders.


During a press conference in August 2015, the executive director of AJAM declared


(http://editorialrn.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3212:una-�rma-


china-pierde-area-minera-que-le-fue-transferida&catid=14&Itemid=599) that the original sale


of the mining areas had been constitutionally invalid, because the assets are state-owned:


“We revoked mining areas that they had transferred, something that they did not have


the right to do because they are not owners”


From state mining company COMIBOL’s website (http://181.115.189.50/index.php/24-noticias-


inicio/211-una-empresa-china-pierde-un-area-minera):


On June 2, 2015, Alcira appealed the revocation decision to AJAM, arguing it was simply


transferring ownership of shares in the company and not the concessions themselves. But as


shown above, the original deed of sale (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2T3xQTqHt93zOr)


from 2010 blatantly contradicted this, showing that the concessions were listed as “company


assets”.


AJAM upheld its order, saying the deal was unlawful and expressly forbidden by the


constitutional court ruling 0032 of 2006 and enshrined in the 2009 constitution.


Cesar Navarro Conveniently Moved to Reinstate the
Concessions Prior to the Sale to New Paci�c

However, Alcira SA lodged a second appeal with the Mines Ministry on October 2, 2015. This


time, Cesar Navarro directly intervened and ruled in Alcira’s favor.


We received a copy of the decision from a former Senior Legal Representative at AJAM, where


we can see that Navarro signed the decision himself


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/hKWBOpfzXUku0o):


Navarro Initially Supported the Revocation of Alcira’s
Concessions But Then Later Overturned an Appeal That
Had Revoked Them.


Former Senior Legal Representative at State �un AJAM:
“You Never Know How Those in Power Make Their
Decisions”


Our former senior legal AJAM source said the original Alcira revocation decision had been


thoroughly consulted with AJAM directors, the Minister of Mines and even as far up as the


presidency. He said he did not understand why that decision was later reversed although there


was heavy legal, political and diplomatic pressure exerted by Alcira’s lawyers, administration


allies and the Chinese Embassy:



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/hKWBOpfzXUku0o
“It wasn’t like we took our original decision on impulse. We explained the situation to


the (Mines) Ministry and to the Presidency and everybody at the time was in


agreement. This company had no assets. They transferred a couple of old trucks but


had nothing else and they were charging $600,000 USD (approx..). And so, it was clear


in fact that they were transferring the concessions.”


“…We told Cesar Navarro of our decision to revoke Alcira’s claims at the time


and he agreed. Then later he went and changed his mind. You never know how


those in power make their decisions.”


Navarro Overturned the Appeal, But Not the Original
Revocation Order. The Property Still Looks to Operate in a
State of Legal Limbo.


Former Senior Legal Advisor to AJAM: “My Understanding
is that Alcira Has Been Operating Outside the Law Since
These Areas Were Revoked in 2015”


Following Navarro’s ruling on the Alcira concessions (despite the apparent constitutional and


legal issues), the entity was soon sold from its Chinese owners to New Paci�c.


New Paci�c announced (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2017/4/10/new-paci�c-


enters-into-agreement-to-acquire-100-of-a-private-bolivian-mining-company-and-announces-a-

Ningde Jungie Mineria Co., Ltd. and two Chinese individuals. The purchase price was U.S. $45


million in cash to be paid by New Paci�c. [Pg. 6

As described above, the Mines Ministry ruling issued on Jan. 15, 2016 and signed by the


Minister of Mines Cesar Navarro overturned AJAM’s appeal ruling regarding the revocation of


the Silver Sand concessions.


However, that Mines Ministry ruling does not appear to have overturned the substantive


decision in May, 2015, to actually revoke the Alcira’s 17 concessions. In other words, the


appeal upholding the revocation was tossed, but the original revocation of the Alcira


mining concessions was never actually reversed.

That view is shared by our former senior AJAM legal source:


“…when the Mines minister considered the appeal, they ruled against the AJAM’s �rst


appeal verdict but they left the original revocation of (mining) areas in place.”


“Maybe (prior owner) Jungie thought the ministry had ruled in their favor and so they


carried on and look where we are now…Maybe the Mines Ministry did not fully


understand the norms. I understand the situation remained like that and since then


they have been operating outside the law.”


That same legal source helped identify a key red �ag indicating that New Paci�c is aware of this,


and failed to fully disclose this issue to investors. A press release


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/2/15/new-paci�c-reports-�nancial-


results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-december-31-2017) stated that in October 2017


the company was granted exploration permits for Silver Sand:


But an exploration permit would be unnecessary if it already had secure title to the


property. (For further analysis of this issue see Appendix A). The former AJAM legal expert we


interviewed said:


“They could not have given out an exploration permit if Alcira already had (legal) title


to those (Silver Sand) areas. Because according to the mining registry that AJAM


operates, you cannot give an exploration license for an occupied area. But that is an


indication that the concessions were (and remained) revoked….my


understanding is that Alcira has been operating outside the law since these


areas were revoked in 2015.”


We emailed New Paci�c and asked why it would need an exploration permit if its tenure was


already secure on those areas, and have not yet received a reply.



https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/2/15/new-pacific-reports-financial-results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-december-31-2017
In short, when New Paci�c purchased Alcira, thinking it was buying the entity’s mining


concessions (which itself would be illegal), it may have actually paid $45 million to


essentially buy nothing. At best it looks to have purchased an entity with a contested interest


in mining concessions.


New Paci�c’s Other Purchases of Bolivian Concessions
Appear to Be in Open Violation of Bolivian Law


Beyond the original purchase of Alcira, which held the Silver Sand project, New Paci�c also


made subsequent purchases of three nearby concessions. Once again, these acquisitions in


July 2018 and December 2019 appear to be in open violation of Bolivian law.


For example (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/11/20/new-paci�c-reports-


�nancial-results-for-the-three-months-ended-september-30-2018):


And another example (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/12/19/new-paci�c-


expands-its-silver-sand-land-package-bolivia):



https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/11/20/new-pacific-reports-financial-results-for-the-three-months-ended-september-30-2018

https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/12/19/new-pacific-expands-its-silver-sand-land-package-bolivia
The brazenness with which these purchases seem to violate Bolivian law on purchasing


concessions indicates to us that perhaps New Paci�c felt it had powerful allies within


government that permitted them to disregard the law and the constitution and push the deals


through regardless.


Local Cooperative Miner: There Must Be Money Changing
Hands Because Navarro Was Minister of Mines…And
COMIBOL Was Telling Us Everything (All the Mining Areas)
Was for Alcira


We also talked by phone to a senior source at a local mining cooperative who lives and works,


mining and herding llamas, immediately next to Silver Sand. He described to us the key players


in the purchase of three concession sales (1 (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-


media/2018/11/20/new-paci�c-reports-�nancial-results-for-the-three-months-ended-


september-30-2018),2 (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/12/19/new-paci�c-


expands-its-silver-sand-land-package-bolivia)) and the signs of corruption he witnessed:


“When Wascar Veltran (holder of several concessions


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/11/20/new-paci�c-reports-


�nancial-results-for-the-three-months-ended-september-30-2018)) saw that Alcira


(New Paci�c) was in the area and doing checks, then he went to (Hernan) Uribe (New


Paci�c country manager). Then Uribe, Wascar Veltran and Villalobos have done this


deal.”


Villalobos – Jaime Eduardo Villalobos Sanjines – is a former mines minister who is currently


facing criminal charges (https://www.edictos.bo/edicto-hace-conocer-a-cristobal-alfonzo-


revollo-thenier-y-edgar-ramiro-saravia-durnik-3/) for corruption during his past time in o�ce.


He had a 50 percent stake in Tirex S.R.L., which sold the original Silver Sand concessions to


Chinese mining company Jungie in 2010 [Pg. 27


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KpbFGnq53iIZa2)]. Although he remained as Jungie’s


general manager until at least mid-2015 [1


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/5W9fZADKFT21xM),2


(http://kc.job1001.com/vvip/cm1365473686758/)] it is not clear whether he helped negotiate


any part of the deals with New Paci�c.

Our mining cooperative source tells us the �rst two concessions


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/11/20/new-paci�c-reports-�nancial-


results-for-the-three-months-ended-september-30-2018) (locally referred to as Jisas and


Jardan) were “virgin” sites with no mine development. He tells us the third


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/12/19/new-paci�c-expands-its-silver-


sand-land-package-bolivia), known locally as Bronce, had a small artisanal mine. He said:


“Those areas are changing hands for millions. I don’t know too much about it because


I can’t stick my nose in too much. But you know that by law concessions can’t be


sold anymore. But up until last year they were still being sold. And tomorrow


they’ll be being sold as well.”


Our senior cooperative source, who by his own description is an “uneducated man but not


stupid”, believes corruption is the only explanation why concessions are being traded and why


land, where he has dug for tin and silver for decades , and where he has grazed his llamas, is


now selling for huge amounts. He said:


“…What can a poor man like me do against big business. I can’t even make a


complaint. The best I can hope for is to get some work there.”


“…I have no idea how they could have increased the value to those huge numbers of


millions in just 7 years. I don’t know who will be paying that amount because the poor


community members can’t a�ord that. “


“…There must be money changing hands because Navarro was Minister of Mines


and he gave the orders to COMIBOL. And COMIBOL was telling us everything (all


the mining areas) was for Alcira.”


“…All the COMIBOL mining areas around here in 2018 and 2019 were being given to


Alcira (New Paci�c). Alcira has had some kind of a political negotiation.”


We Asked a Prominent Bolivian Legislator About New
Paci�c’s Purchases: “This Sounds Very Serious…If
Concession-Holders Do Not Respect the �ules Then Those
Areas Return to the State”



https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/11/20/new-pacific-reports-financial-results-for-the-three-months-ended-september-30-2018

https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/12/19/new-pacific-expands-its-silver-sand-land-package-bolivia
We spoke with Victor Borda, former speaker of the lower House and a prominent member of


the majority MAS Party, in order to understand a legislator’s take on the sale to New Paci�c and


the deals taking place in the area.  President Evo Morales and Minister Navarro belonged to the


same party as Borda.


Upon learning more details of the Alcira SA sale to Jungie in 2010 and to New Paci�c in 2017,


congressman Borda suggested he may launch a parliamentary investigation into the


validity of the proposed contract. Here are some quotes from our interview with him:


“Even before the 2009 constitution it was clear that mineral wealth is the property of


the Bolivian people and (concessions) cannot be the subject of private transfers,


mortgages and even worse to sell those concessions. “


“Concession-holders have use of those concessions but cannot dispose of them at will


because those areas belong to the state. If concession-holders do not respect the


rules then those areas return to the state.”


“If this company (Alcira/Jungie) sold areas that had already been revoked and


reverted to the state then that would be very serious, quite simply be an act of


corruption. I don’t understand how the Ministry of Mines has allowed this type


of operation and the exploitation of mineral wealth if the areas had reverted to


the state.”


“This sounds very serious. As a member of parliament I will try to investigate


this subject. Sometimes public o�cials get members of parliament into problems


because they pass us contracts in a big package (with other contracts) and sometimes


these (bad) contracts and irregularities get camou�aged.”


“If there’s corrupt people or people who have made the government look bad


then they must be sanctioned.”


What are the Odds That the New Bolivian Administration
Blesses the Alleged Corrupt and Illegal Dealings of the Old
Administration They Ousted Via Coup? We Think Low, But
Greater Than Zero
We think the odds are high that the Bolivian government and parliament could revoke the


company’s Silver Sand concessions, and scrap the production contract for the expanded 57km


mining area with Alcira, leaving New Paci�c with essentially nothing.


We emailed New Paci�c and asked for more clari�cation on several issues, including:


1. Is approval by the legislature required for Silver Sand, or just the expanded mining area?


2. Why would an exploration permit be needed if tenure was already secure on those (Silver


Sand) areas?


3. How has Alcira’s historical purchase of concessions, which were subsequently stripped by


the state, di�ered from New Paci�c’s purchases of concessions?


We have not received replies to these questions as of this writing. Should New Paci�c provide


us answers we will update this piece accordingly.


It’s worth noting that the company has disclosed approval delays as a risk, though most


investors seem to have just ignored it as a boilerplate risk factor. Per the latest MD&A


“The (company’s mining production contract) was approved by Bolivia’s Ministry of


Mining and Metallurgy on January 7, 2019, but remains subject to rati�cation and


approval by the Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia. As of today, the MPC


has not been rati�ed nor approved by (sic) Plurinational Legislative Assembly of


Bolivia.” [Pg. 3 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&do


cId=4664924)]


We think investors need to weigh three possible scenarios:


1. Total revocation of contracts and mining areas. We believe there is a 60% chance of this


happening.


2. A renegotiated deal with COMIBOL/the legislature, which would likely be on far less


favorable terms. We believe there is a 30% chance of this happening.


3. The deal somehow passes through Bolivia’s congress as-is. We believe there is a 10%


chance of this happening.

https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664924
Between the new administration’s allegations of corruption around the deal, the signs we


found of illegality around the terms of the concession purchases and the current political


environment, we think the company has an uphill battle in getting contracts approved and


legally retaining its mining areas.


That all being said, we don’t think anyone can credibly claim to know with certainty which


direction the political winds will blow in a country with as much recent upheaval as Bolivia.


Aside from political volatility, the country was ranked 123rd out of 180 countries in


Transparency International’s (https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019) survey of public sector


corruption, which also always has the potential to swing the balance.


Clearly, at least with historical administrations, laws in Bolivia seem to have been bent or


ignored outright when enough money was involved.


A Bolivian Lawmaker Asked Us (On A Recorded Call)
Whether We Had an Interest in Seeing the New Paci�c Deal
Approved.


Us: “Would It Come at a Price?”


Lawmaker: “Yes Exactly”


It’s not entirely clear yet how the interim, center-right Bolivian administration will handle


potential corruption. Political power remains divided and the MAS Party retains majority


control of Bolivia’s lower house and Senate, despite its leader Evo Morales being ousted from


the presidency.


As part of our research, we spoke with one lawmaker in�uential in mining issues.   (Note: We


have this call recorded)


When we asked about New Paci�c he said initially he could not speci�cally recollect the


proposed deal but o�ered to check. He later came back with what sounded like an unsolicited


o�er to help pass or block the contract between New Paci�c and COMIBOL when it came up for


consideration by parliament:



https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019
“I’m going to look for an alternative to see if I can bring that (Alcira/New Paci�c)


contract up for consideration and get it passed because I have been able to bring up


several contracts like that and get them passed.”


“And now a little question. Would you be interested in this going ahead, so that I can


take an interest in it? Or on the contrary would you prefer it to stop? I just wanted to


talk to you a little about that because if you’re interested then I can do something …to


push forward this mining contract otherwise I can just ask about the situation, yes or


no.”


When asked if his intervention would come at a price, he said:


“Yes exactly that’s true and that’s exactly what I wanted to say. And so we’d have to


work with the technical experts (of the senate) and something could be done.”


We prefer to let the lawmaker’s comments speak for themselves. But we came away with the


impression that public sector graft may still hold sway over parts of the political decision-


making process.


Our Conversation with the New Minister of Mines Carlos
Huallpa: More Conciliatory than When He Leveled
Corruption Allegations In January


We also talked by phone with the new Minister of Mines Carlos Huallpa about New Paci�c’s


purchase of Alcira and his predecessor’s o�er of a major mining contract on generous terms.


The right-wing interim government, running Bolivia until new general elections can be held, has


an interest in showing the country remains open to foreign investment. That may be one


reason why Huallpa appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone compared to his remarks in


January when he accused Navarro and Alcira of being in a corrupt alliance.


He said New Paci�c’s legal team had already been in touch about rescuing the contract


deal but was insistent that if a new deal was reached, the Bolivian state’s percentage


share of production or the pro�ts would be signi�cantly higher.
Even if new terms are hammered out with the Mines Ministry, however, a deal would still need


approval by the legislature.


For now, the legislature is not meeting in person—coronavirus quarantine restrictions in Bolivia


have been extended until at least April 30 . Even when it does meet, its �rst priority will be


rescheduling general elections for the presidency and congress, which had originally been


planned for May 7 .


Part II: Management Red Flags, Multiple
Related-Party Deals with Silvercorp And Other
Warning Signs


When assessing a speculative early-stage mining investment, the credibility of management is


critical. Our review of New Paci�c’s management team uncovered signi�cant red �ags.


Before we dive in, here are some basics showing the tight relationship between New Paci�c


and Silvercorp:


Leadership Overlap: Rui Feng (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/directorspage), CEO and director


of New Paci�c, also serves as Chairman/CEO


(http://silvercorpmetals.com/company/management/) of Silvercorp. David Kong


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/directorspage) also serves as director at both companies.


Cross-Ownership: Silvercorp owns about 29% of New Paci�c, according to a recent


management circular [Pg. 6 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=10&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=02980434&docId=461

�lings. [Pg. 3 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?

New Paci�c’s Management Has Been Accused of In�ating
Silver Grades, And Other Improprieties, At Related
Company Silvercorp


New Paci�c CEO Rui Feng has come under �re previously over allegations of falsifying silver


grades at his other public company, Silvercorp.


In late 2011, fraud researcher Jon Carnes, who has among the best track records in the


industry in identifying irregularities with China-based companies, issued a report


(https://labemp.�les.wordpress.com/2011/09/silvercorp-metals-�nal-report.pdf) on Silvercorp


that alleged, among other things:


The company’s technical reports were based on a 2-man team that used resource


estimates provided by Silvercorp, and who hadn’t visited the site in years.


The quality and resource estimates of its mines were overstated.


That a related-party transaction had enriched a relative of CEO Rui Feng.


Following issuance of the report, Silvercorp responded


(http://silvercorpmetals.com/news_and_media/news/index.php?content_id=318) and retaliated


with a multi-year legal war (that we detail further below.)


The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) investigated Silvercorp after the report.


According to the Globe and Mail (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-


magazine/the-strange-case-of-alfred-little/article24443237/), the commission’s chief mining


advisor, Robert Holland, wrote to the company, outlining major irregularities:



https://labemp.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/silvercorp-metals-final-report.pdf

http://silvercorpmetals.com/news_and_media/news/index.php?content_id=318

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-strange-case-of-alfred-little/article24443237/
“Holland wrote that the reports used resource estimation methods that were


inconsistent with best practices, and contained ‘errors that could individually or


collectively result in material overestimation of mineral resources.’


Holland pointed to one technical report that, he said, relied ‘unduly’ on information


from the company’s chief operating o�cer and president, and had ‘uncorrected errors


in mineral resource tables.’ He added that there were large unexplained di�erences in


the report between two measures of a mine: resources and reserves.


In summary, he wrote: ‘We consider the Company to be in material default of its


technical disclosure and �ling requirements.’ He threatened to put Silvercorp on the


BCSC’s default list—exposed publicly as a company that was in violation of the BCSC’s


rules.”


Despite this, the BCSC eventually dropped its investigation without detailing why. A private


lawsuit (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/65GQJg4CC4JMU) went forward in the U.S., however,


resulting in the company paying a $14 million settlement


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/vy0DCiWFzzEJkz), without admitting wrongdoing.


Troubling Parallels at New Paci�c: One of the Two
“Independent” Geologists Who Wrote the Silver Sand
Technical Report (and the Only One to Actually Visit the
Site) Worked at Silvercorp for 3.5 Years


A technical report is meant to provide a summary of material scienti�c and technical


information of mining projects so investors have a clear, objective view of its prospects. In


order to achieve this objective, the role of independent geologists in preparing technical reports


is critical.


A fulsome technical report for Silver Sand is all the more important given that the project’s


prior owners “conducted no commercial mining or material processing but only surface


exploration and limited surface core drilling” [Pg.  16

drilled only 8 core holes in two separate campaigns totaling 2,334 meters. [Pg. 19

New Paci�c CEO �ui Feng’s Unhealthy Habit of Using
Aggressive Litigation and State In�uence to Silence
Criticism


We at Hindenburg take pride in reporting on companies that try to silence criticism with


intimidation. A functioning market requires diverging views and opinions in order for investors


to be able to make informed decisions.


We also believe that companies engaging in such practices are vastly more likely to have


something to hide. In one recent example, MiMedx Group sued its critics


(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mimedx-�les-lawsuit-related-to-short-seller-

New Paci�c CEO Rui Feng has taken it a step further, with a history of using litigation and state


in�uence (including payments to Chinese authorities and pressure on Canadian regulators) to


silence criticism against his business interests.


As reported in the Globe and Mail (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-


magazine/the-strange-case-of-alfred-little/article24443237/), following a critical piece on


Silvercorp written by fraud researcher Jon Carnes, the company sued Carnes and used its


in�uence in China to advance an investigation into his local analysts. Per the Globe expose:


“Silvercorp helped pay for police expenses in the investigation of Carnes’s operation.


Evidence also shows that Silvercorp passed results of the Chinese police investigation


to the BCSC.”



https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-strange-case-of-alfred-little/article24443237/
One analyst, Kun Huang, was thrown in a crowded Chinese prison cell without charges and


interrogated for a month by local police. The company appears to have aided in the police


interrogation of the analyst, as well as his eventual prosecution:


“For the �rst few days, the police were receiving texts and phone calls before and


during these sessions. ‘I have a strong suspicion it was someone from [Silvercorp].’”


“In the summer of 2013, Huang was charged with ‘criminal defamation’ for criticizing


a Chinese company. His trial in September of that year lasted one day and was closed


to the public, at Silvercorp’s behest. Silvercorp was also granted standing.”


“In the end, Huang received a two-year sentence and was returned to the same


overcrowded cell to serve out the rest of his term.”


In Canada, the BCSC alleged fraud


(http://www.vancouversun.com/business/bcsc+opens+carnes+fraud+case+over+silvercorp+sho


rt+selling/10410630/story.html) against Carnes, who published under a pseudonym with a


�ctitious biography. The case was later dismissed


(https://business.�nancialpost.com/commodities/mining/bcsc-clears-short-seller-jon-carnes-of-


fraud-in-silvercorp-case), and Carnes’ work was eventually largely vindicated


(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-strange-case-of-


alfred-little/article24443237/).


The above episode should say something about management’s approach on matters of


transparency. We believe that the same executive team has once again failed to thoroughly


disclose to investors the major issues relating to New Paci�c.


Part III: If New Paci�c Actually Controlled the
Bolivian Concessions (We Don’t Think It Does)
We’d Still See 85% Downside Purely on
Fundamentals


Given Part I about how New Paci�c might not control any of its Bolivian mining areas, and Part


II which identi�es signi�cant red �ags relating to the credibility of management, we think


there’s a great chance this part of our report is largely super�uous.

That being said, in the interest of being thorough, we looked closely at New Paci�c’s balance


sheet, comparables with other similar mining projects and hired a consultant to perform a


detailed technical analysis on the ‘�agship’ Silver Sand project.


What we found leads us conclude that New Paci�c could have 85% fundamental downside


even if there were none of the political risk factors or management red �ags detailed above.


A Comparables Analysis Shows That Silver Sand is Valued
17x Higher than Competitors


As a basic check, we analyzed New Paci�c relative to other publicly traded mining companies


with key silver projects, and found that it represented a blatant outlier:

Beyond a comparables analysis, we did a balance sheet analysis and engaged an expert to


provide a full technical report in order to see if there was anything that could warrant New


Paci�c’s massive outlier status.

20% (due to market decline) to arrive at C$5 million of value. All told, ex mineral property

Technical Analysis of New Paci�c’s Silver Sand Project
Arrives at an Estimated Value of C�0.29 Per Share


Background: Bolivia’s Potosi Region and the Legacy of the
Cerro Rico Silver Mine


Silver Sand (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/silver-sand-project) is a sandstone-hosted primary


silver deposit located in Potosi, Bolivia.  The Potosi region is well known for its world-class silver


deposits, especially the Cerro Rico mine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Rico).  Upwards of


2 billion (https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29448079) ounces of silver have been mined


from Cerro Rico since 1545, with early mining grades averaging 7,000 ounces of silver per


tonne.


This jaw-dropping quantity and grade of silver resulted in decades of exploitation and abuse by


the Spanish Empire and other foreign entities since the discovery, resulting in the death of an


estimated 8 million people (https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29448079).  That is why

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Rico

https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29448079

https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29448079
Cerro Rico is known locally as “the mountain that eats men


(https://www.npr.org/2012/09/25/161752820/bolivias-cerro-rico-the-mountain-that-eats-men)”


and “the mouth to hell (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/photocontest/detail/people/el-


cerro-rico-is-a-mountain-that-reached-5000-meters-altitude-that-eats-men/)“.  Eduardo


Galeano, journalist and author of the now-classic political work “The Open Veins of Latin


America” wrote about Cerro Rico, he said


(https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/story-of-cities-6-potosi-bolivia-peru-inca-


�rst-city-capitalism):


“You could build a bridge of pure silver from Potosi to Madrid with ore extracted. And


you could build a bridge back with the bones of those who died mining it.”


(Location of Silver Sand relative to Cerro Rico)


Despite the abundance of riches that sat within Cerro Rico, the silver has brought mostly death


and misery to local people (Potosinos), which has instilled hostility towards foreign miners in


the region.


Given this history and social/political backdrop, deposits in Potosi arguably need to be “world-


class” to make it worthwhile for foreign mining companies and their investors to try to develop


such deposits.

Technical Analysis: Silver Sand – A Low Grade, Highly
Complex Deposit


Silver Sand is only about 27 km from Cerro Rico, so it is de�nitely in a world-class silver district. 


But is Silver Sand a world-class silver deposit? The grades within the Silver Sand deposit are


low, at about 132 g/t Ag (about 1.2 g/t Au if using gold-equivalents) based on the resource


estimate, which envisions this to be mined using low-cost open pit methods.


However, investors should not expect this to be a low-cost open pit, heap leach project.  The


metallurgy is much more complex and includes sulphides, which may not be cyanide-leachable


like oxides.  Therefore, processing capital and operating costs could be quite high, as both


cyanidation and �otation plants may be required.  Furthermore, recoveries may not achieve


the levels suggested by preliminary testing.


As a low-grade deposit with complex mineralogy, Silver Sand then needs gargantuan size to


qualify as world-class.  Based on the market capitalization, investors are pricing this as a


foregone conclusion.  Our technical expert, however, suggests that Silver Sand is not a world-


class silver deposit based on drilling to date and evidence suggests that exploration upside may


be limited.


Our Expert Consultant Estimates That Resources Would
Have to be 6x Larger to Warrant Current Valuation


New Paci�c trades at a market capitalization of approximately C$700 million.  The only way to


justify such a lofty valuation for a mineral asset, located in Potosi, Bolivia, is if the project has in


the ballpark of a billion ounces of silver.


Silver exploration and development companies, most of which are at a more advanced stage of


exploration than New Paci�c, currently trade at a valuation of signi�cantly less than US$0.50


per silver ounce in the ground.  Even ascribing an in situ value of US$0.50/oz to New Paci�c


would mean that it would need a resource of ~1 billion ounces.  The recently released maiden


resource estimate (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2020/4/14/new-paci�c-


metals-reports-inaugural-resource-estimate-for-the-silver-sand-deposit-bolivia) contains a total


of only 191 million ounces of silver, or about 80% less than that.


Analysts had estimated that the Silver Sand resource would contain between 170 and 250


million ounces of silver, with an average of 223 million:

The resource estimate (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2020/4/14/new-paci�c-


metals-reports-inaugural-resource-estimate-for-the-silver-sand-deposit-bolivia) came in well


below most of the analysts’ expectations.  More importantly, we believe that the market’s


expectations were much higher, in part due to the aggressive aforementioned stock


promotion.


Technical Analysis: Silver Sand’s Resources Implies a
Valuation of About C�0.29 Per Share


Using 191 million ounces of contained silver, as per the resource estimate, New Paci�c


currently trades at about US$2.56 per ounce of in situ silver.  According to the technical


consultant we worked with, that is in the ballpark of advanced silver developers and producers,


not early stage explorers.


A more appropriate comparable for New Paci�c is likely Bear Creek Mining (TSX: BCM), which


currently has a market capitalization of US$145 million.  Bear Creek’s primary project is Corani


in southern Peru, a more politically stable mining jurisdiction than Potosi, Bolivia.  Corani is an


open pittable, silver-dominant polymetallic deposit that contains approximately 735 million


silver-equivalent ounces (https://www.bearcreekmining.com/news/2015/bear-creek-mining-


announces-results-of-updated-corani-feasibility-study/) (two-thirds of which are classi�ed as


Reserves).  Bear Creek is currently being valued at US$0.16 per silver-equivalent ounce, which


is more in line with the majority of silver explorers and developers than the valuation at which


New Paci�c is currently trading.


Applying a US$0.16 per silver-equivalent ounce valuation to the Silver Sand resource implies a


valuation of US$30.6 million or about C$0.29 per share.  New Paci�c is trading ~7.5x that (when


adding the value of balance sheet assets) which suggests a major overvaluation.

Technical Analysis: New Paci�c’s In�ll Drilling Suggests
Exploration Potential is Limited


Early exploration drilling is usually widely spaced with the goal of delineating the mineral


resource, leading to inferred resources.  Once the resource has been reasonably well de�ned,


or gets so large that further growth is meaningless, companies then turn their attention to new


zones or upgrading the resource through in�ll drilling.


New Paci�c drilled 195 holes in the “discovery exploration” program conducted in 2017 and


2018. [Pg. 1 (https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?


lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664


924)]  Then, rather than continuing to expand the resource footprint, the company conducted


mostly in�ll drilling in 2019 (Figure 2).


The location of the in�ll drill holes (yellow dots on Figure 2) do a good job of showing the best


zones within the Silver Sand deposit and indicate that the footprint is relatively small.  An


additional 19 holes were drilled on the Snake Hole target, but as previously mentioned,


mineralized widths there are narrow and often too deep for economic open pit extraction.



https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass=7&issuerNo=00006180&issuerType=03&projectNo=03017428&docId=4664924
(Figure 2 – Silver Sand plan map showing drill collars)


Our technical consultant believed that New Paci�c switched from exploration drilling to in�ll


drilling because the resource expansion potential was dwindling.  Mineralization to the south


and the west falls o� a cli�, literally (Figure 3) and appears to be cut-o� by geology/structure to


the east.  Mineralization appears to be open to the north, but drilling and the plan map suggest


that mineralization plunges and pinches out to the north (Figure 4).  All that is to say that Silver


Sand may not get much bigger.


(Figure 3 – Drill plan map draped over Google satellite map, our interpretation)

widths, deeper, and low grade)


Technical Analysis: Metallurgy—Oxides + Transition +
Sulphides = Complexity + High Cost
In August 2019, New Paci�c announced (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-


media/2019/8/21/new-paci�c-reports-high-recovery-of-silver-from-various-metallurgical-


processes-for-sulphide-transition-and-oxide-styles-of-mineralization-from-silver-sand-bolivia)


“high recovery of silver from various metallurgical processes for sulphide, transition and oxide


styles of mineralization”.  High silver recoveries (i.e., >80%) were quoted for �otation, bottle roll


cyanidation, and coarse column leach cyanidation testing.  The high-level results provided the


appearance that any of these processing methods could be used for all of Silver Sand


mineralization, which struck our expert as dubious.  First of all, the news release quoted


recoveries quali�ed as “up to”, which should not be confused with anticipated recoveries.


A review of the technical report �led in November 2019 provides better insight into potential


silver recoveries.  What it revealed is that neither �otation nor cyanide leaching seem to


provide an optimal processing approach for all of the mineralization.  As well, the maximum


silver recovery numbers quoted in the metallurgical testing news release seemed misleading.


The low-grade oxide material (LEACHMET 1) demonstrated silver recoveries of only 59.1% to


77.5% in bottle roll tests at room temperature, using air as the sparge gas, and with reasonable


cyanide consumption.  Results for the high-grade oxide sample (LEACHMET 4) were even


worse, achieving recoveries of 69.0% or less of the silver at lower temperatures and cyanide


consumption.


The news release (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/8/21/new-paci�c-


reports-high-recovery-of-silver-from-various-metallurgical-processes-for-sulphide-transition-


and-oxide-styles-of-mineralization-from-silver-sand-bolivia) stated that bottle roll cyanidation


testing had silver extraction up to 96.3% for oxide mineralization, but that was only achieved at


elevated temperatures, using O  as sparge gas, and with hefty cyanide consumption. 


Processing costs would be high under those conditions, so it is much more likely that silver


recoveries would be below 80% once economics are factored in.

https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/8/21/new-pacific-reports-high-recovery-of-silver-from-various-metallurgical-processes-for-sulphide-transition-and-oxide-styles-of-mineralization-from-silver-sand-bolivia
Flotation is an alternate approach, wherein the silver would be directed into a concentrate that


would then need to be transported to a smelter for further processing.  However, no �otation


testing was done on the low-grade silver samples, suggesting that cyanidation is likely the only


viable processing method for low grade silver in oxides.


The silver at Silver Sand is very �ne grained.  As shown in Figure 5


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/8/21/new-paci�c-reports-high-recovery-


of-silver-from-various-metallurgical-processes-for-sulphide-transition-and-oxide-styles-of-


mineralization-from-silver-sand-bolivia), the majority of the silver falls into the smallest size


fraction of -74 microns (1 micron = 0.001 mm).  That means most of the silver grains are about


the thickness of a human hair, which is very small and will require very �ne grinding for


cyanidation or �otation to be e�ective.  The �ner the grind, the higher the cost, so this should


also be noted.  In addition, �ne grinding can lead to sliming issues during �otation.

(Figure 5 – Silver Distribution by Size Fraction, [microns])


In summary, the metallurgy at Silver Sand is complex and varied.  In the opinion of our expert,


the news release (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2019/8/21/new-paci�c-


reports-high-recovery-of-silver-from-various-metallurgical-processes-for-sulphide-transition-


and-oxide-styles-of-mineralization-from-silver-sand-bolivia) issued by New Paci�c on high silver


recoveries was misleading.  High silver recoveries are possible, but likely not practical when


costs are factored in.  It is our expert’s sense that Silver Sand will either require both a


cyanidation plant and a separate �otation plant to achieve good recoveries, or a single


cyanidation plant with lower overall recoveries.


Compared to low grade gold projects that can use open pit mining and heap leaching, our


consultant suggested Silver Sand is likely to require signi�cantly more capital investment for


processing facilities and the operations will have high processing costs.


Technical Analysis Conclusion: A World Class Valuation for
a Mine That Is Not World Class

Given the balance sheet assets and resource estimates of C$0.30 and C$0.29 per share


respectively, we arrive at a total value of C0.59 per share, representing over 85% downside


from current levels purely on a fundamental basis.


Overall Conclusion: 90%+ Downside


Our price target for New Paci�c is C$0.37, representing over 90% downside from current levels.


To arrive at our �nal price target, we weighted 3 scenarios:


1. Total revocation of the Bolivian mining areas (concessions) (60%). In this scenario we


assign a price target of C$0.30, the estimated value of the balance sheet assets.


2. A renegotiated deal on the Bolivian concessions (30%), to which we assign a price target


of C$0.45 (balance sheet assets plus half of the value of the mining project, given the


historic pro�t splits Bolivian deals have typically entailed).


3. The deal (somehow) passing through Bolivian legislation as-is (10%), to which we assign a


price target of C$0.59, representing our estimate of the balance sheet assets and the


Silver Sand project.


Given the issues above, and those relating to management’s lack of clear communication on


subjects that are of critical importance to investors, we are short both New Paci�c and


Silvercorp. Best of luck to all.


Appendix A: Red Flags Relating to the Company’s
Ownership of Silver Sand


We found multiple red �ags, based on company statements and our interviews with Bolivian


lawmakers, raising doubts about whether it actually had secure tenure of mining rights to its


�agship Silver Sand property.


1. The company suggests that it needs Congressional approval for its consolidation


and conversion of its Silver Sand property (https://newpaci�cmetals.com/silver-sand-


project), but if it already held secure title why would this be necessary? The company


suggests, in relation to Silver Sand, it needs Bolivian Congressional approval to convert


what it presents as 17 existing and legally held ATEs (formerly known as concessions) into


administrative mining contracts.


But Congressional approval is only needed if there are no pre-existing mining rights in place.



https://newpacificmetals.com/silver-sand-project
Article 132 of the 2014 Bolivian Mining Law 535 states mining contracts based on ATEs


(concessions) that were legally held prior to the new law do not need congressional approval,


only approval from AJAM.  Congressional approval is only needed for contracts if there were no


pre-existing mining rights in place.


Article 132 – (contracts subject to legislative approval):


Mining contracts which are signed following the publication of this Law will require approval


from the Plurinational Legislative Assembly in accordance with numeral 12 of Paragraph I of


Article 158 of the Political Constitution of the State, except administrative mining contracts


based on the conversion of Special Transitory Authorizations – (ATEs) to contracts by virtue of


the fact that these represent pre-constituted or previously acquired rights, recognized by the


Constitution.


Regarding this red �ag raised by New Paci�c – by their own words – a Senior former member of


AJAM legal department told us:


“This is a contradiction. If they’re in the process of transitioning (from special


temporary authorizations to mining administrative contracts) they do not need


parliamentary approval.”


A former senior COMIBOL executive told us:
“I think there are inaccuracies in the (New Paci�c) statements. The change from


(pertenencias) to “quadrilles” (25 ha mining areas) is nothing new. I’m surprised the


previous owners had not done that. That change (from ATEs to contracts) does not


need parliamentary approval.”


2. The company says it was granted exploration permits for Silver Sand, which it


wouldn’t need if it already held secure title to the property. A 2018 press release


(https://newpaci�cmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/2/15/new-paci�c-reports-�nancial-


results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-december-31-2017) stated that in October


2017 the company was granted exploration permits for Silver Sand:


We, and the industry experts we consulted, were unclear why New Paci�c needed “exploration


permits” if the company already had secure mining rights (concessions) within the 3.17 km


area of the Silver Sand project.


Article 92 of the 2014 Bolivian Mining Law 535 stipulates that the legal holder of a mining right


(concession) already the necessary rights to prospect, explore, produce and process minerals.


The only additional permit necessary may be an environmental permit.


Article 92 – (Mining Rights) Mining rights (formerly known as concessions) grant the holder the


permission to prospect, explore, exploit, concentrate, smelt, re�ne, industrialize and


commercialize the mineral resources either using both their own and complementary mining


activities in all or part of the productive chain.”


In contrast, exploration permits are granted to individuals or companies for areas in which they


do NOT, nor anybody else, hold any mining rights.


Article 164 states exploration permits are given for vacant, or free areas, where no other


mining rights are in e�ect:

https://newpacificmetals.com/news-and-media/2018/2/15/new-pacific-reports-financial-results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-december-31-2017
Regarding the issue of why New Paci�c felt the need to apply for exploration permits for the


Silver Sand mining areas where it says it has had full, legal rights to since acquisition in 2017,


our industry experts said:


A senior former COMIBOL executive said:


“As far as requesting authorization for exploration – they would not need an


exploration permit but they may have been referring to the environmental license


which they would need. I would be very surprised if they’ve paid more than $40


million dollars for something that was not 100 percent assured.”


The former AJAM legal expert we interviewed said:


“They could not have given out an exploration permit if Alcira already had (legal) title


to those (Silver Sand) areas. Because according to the mining registry that AJAM


operates, you cannot give an exploration license for an occupied area. But that is an


indication that the concessions were (and remained) revoked….my


understanding is that Alcira has been operating outside the law since these


areas were revoked in 2015.”


[1] Alcira was constituted as an anonymous society by means of testimony No. 0119/2008


dated April 14, 2008, with tax identi�cation number No. 155512027, and full registration with


FUNDEMPRESA according to commercial registration No. 130345. Full registration does not


seem to have taken place until at least July because of Alcira’s directors’ failure to supply


accurate paperwork.


[2] Alcira SA was sold to Jungie Mining Industry via deed of sale 1058/2010 on Sept. 10, 2010


[3] Note that Silvercorp was named SKN Resources at the time.
