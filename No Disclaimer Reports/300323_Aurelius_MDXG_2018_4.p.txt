Aurelius’ research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information
on this website to re�ect such positions or changes in such
positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and

Dear Mr. Brock,


We are writing to express our concerns about the risks of serious
and pervasive fraud at Mimedx Group, Inc. and your �rm’s audit
thoroughly testing these risks in light of facts and allegations that
have emerged.


As you are likely aware, multiple whistleblowers have made detailed
allegations of accounting fraud and wrongdoing at MiMedx. Short
sellers, including ourselves, have published research reports
questioning the integrity of the company’s �nancial reporting and
disclosures. MiMedx is subject to an SEC investigation and has
admitted that at that at least one former employee has now pled “the
�fth amendment rather than answer questions related to dinners
provided to doctors”.   In recent months, MiMedx has embarked on
an aggressive retaliatory campaign that appears to be singularly
intended to intimidate and silence those who present facts that
contradict management’s narrative.


Last September, we published a research report that highlighted
disturbing similarities between our observations of MiMedx and
certain characteristics displayed by ArthroCare, a medical device
company that engaged in accounting fraud through undisclosed
transactions involving distributors, sales agents, and doctors.  Soon
afterwards, MiMedx �led a lawsuit and has repeatedly claimed to be
the victim of a purported “illegal, unscrupulous and massive short
sell attack”. It is particularly notable that after allegations of fraud
�rst emerged at ArthroCare, the CEO also accused short sellers of
making false claims he said were “the most salacious kind of

7/10/2019 An Open Letter To The MiMedx Auditors - Aurelius Value

garbage you can possibly �nd.”  Yet the fraud was exposed and the
CEO eventually went to prison.


We believe your audit engagement of MiMedx presents an important
opportunity to protect the reputation of Ernst & Young. ArthroCare’s
auditors could have put an end to the fraud but failed. The PCAOB
instituted disciplinary proceedings against the PriceWaterhouse
partner in charge of ArthroCare’s 2005-2009 audits, leading to a
three-year disbarment for that individual.  The PCAOB speci�cally
cited the audit partner’s failure to examine short seller allegations
beyond accepting statements from management:


We are concerned by public statements made by MiMedx soon after
your August 2017 appointment as the company’s new auditor
implying that you had endorsed MiMedx’s accounting practices
before even conducting an audit or issuing an audit opinion.
 Examples include:


“Our Big 4 auditors are with us! We are answering the SEC’s
subpoena – thank you! (October 25, 2017)


“Believe our auditors” (November 2, 2017 MiMedx repeated
this phrase four times in a written public response to a short
seller’s allegations concerning improper revenue
recognition).


“[Audit Partner] learned no later than early December
2007 that allegations of potential wrongdoing were
being made against ArthroCare by short sellers…. After
speaking during the 2007 audit with PwC’s local
Regional Risk Management Partner about the “short-
attack on ArthroCare,”…. [Audit Partner] accepted
management’s representations regarding the short
seller allegations, ultimately concluding that they did
not appear to have merit. Neither [Audit Partner] nor his
team performed any additional procedures to
speci�cally respond to the short seller allegations”

7/10/2019 An Open Letter To The MiMedx Auditors - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-auditors/ 4/16


“These exceptional results have been reviewed by our new
auditors, who are one of the ‘Big Four’ Auditing �rms.”
(October 26, 2017)


“there is no malfeasance, there is no revenue recognition
issues, et cetera, et cetera, I mean here we’ve gone through a
year-end audit, we’ve gone through two quarterly audits” (CEO
Parker Petit during a call with an investor)


We believe these assertions are likely false because it seems
virtually impossible for your engagement team to have completed
the necessary audit procedures into such detailed allegations so
quickly after being retained (and well before audits typically begin).
Also, contrary to Mr. Petit’s claims, we note that the company’s 10-Q
�lings with the SEC speci�cally state the �nancials are not audited.
 Yet MiMedx’s representations concerning your �rm may have
enticed investors into purchasing shares of the company, especially
since they were bundled into management statements intended to
placate fears about the SEC’s investigation and discredit
whistleblowers. It is our opinion that MiMedx is using your brand as
a means to convey legitimacy to itself, especially since EY named
Mr. Petit “Entrepreneur Of The Year” in 2015. We therefore believe it
is imperative that Ernst & Young publicly clarify if MiMedx’s
statements about it are accurate.


MiMedx has repeatedly made false statements to investors. In press
releases and conference calls, the company and CEO Parker Petit
have pointed to the �ndings from an investigation purportedly led by
“independent outside counsel” as proof that there is “no
malfeasance” at MiMedx.  But we learned that this investigation was
actually led by Troutman Sanders, MiMedx’s own securities counsel.
SEC �lings show that Troutman has represented MiMedx in
securities matters since at least 2013 and has previously
represented other companies that were controlled by Mr. Petit,
Healthdyne and Matria. Therefore, Troutman clearly fails to meet
both legal and common-sense de�nitions of independence.  Yet
instead of correcting this clear misrepresentation after we �rst
publicized it, Mr. Petit has continued to falsely characterize Troutman
as being independent.  If MiMedx has made similar representations
to you, we reference AS 2805.04, which states that:

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-auditors/ 5/16


At absolute minimum, it is our opinion that this falsehood may impair
your ability to rely on the investigation as credible audit evidence. A
whitepaper authored by Ernst & Young recognizes that “issues are
present when using the company’s regular outside counsel with
strong ties to management” to conduct special investigations.
Furthermore, although Mr. Petit has told investors that “believe me,
this board is a group of individuals that are very independent of this
management group”, we discovered that the Chairman of MiMex’s
Audit Committee, J. Terry Dewberry has “very close” personal ties to
Mr. Petit.  Mr. Dewberry is Mr. Petit’s Fraternity Little Brother at
Georgia Tech’s Pi Kappa Phi and Petit was quoted in an interview
stating that Mr. Dewberry has “been a member of the executive team
for all our businesses over the years”. The fraternity publication
explains that Mr. Dewberry even assisted in the creation and award
of a bronze bust of Mr. Petit in 2014.


We have conducted exhaustive forensic research into MiMedx and
observe signi�cant irregularities involving MiMedx and its distributor
and sales agent networks.  We believe these issues merit your full
attention under AS 2401 (Consideration of Fraud in a Financial
Statement Audit), AS 2405 (Illegal Acts by Clients) and AS 2410
(Related Parties).


AvKARE


AvKARE was MiMedx’s primary distributor to the VA, having
consignment agreements allowing it to store product at VA
Hospitals.  MiMedx recognizes revenues as soon as product is
shipped to stocking distributors, as opposed to when the product is
implanted.  At least three whistleblowers have alleged that MiMedx


 “if a representation made by management is
contradicted by other audit evidence, the auditor should
investigate the circumstances and consider the
reliability of the representation made. Based on the
circumstances, the auditor should consider whether his
or her reliance on management’s representations
relating to other aspects of the �nancial statements is
appropriate and justi�ed.”

abused this accounting policy by using AvKare’s consignment
agreements to hit sales targets by �lling shelves before the end of
quarters with excess product that neither AvKARE nor the VA had
requested.  While a signi�cant amount of supporting detail exists in
court documents �led by the whistleblowers, items we believe are
particularly salient include:


Evidence indicates that AvKARE was merely an intermediary
and that MiMedx retained responsibility for the inventory. In a
deposition under oath, MiMedx’s current Senior Vice
President of Global Sales Mike Carlton stated that Avkare
“didn’t do anything”, “it was really our direct guys that sold the
product”. This statement corroborates the whistleblower
allegations that MiMedx sales representatives were
responsible for “ensuring the resale of AvKARE tissues to the
end-customer (in this case, the federal government),
monitoring and tracking the AvKARE tissues, and accounting
for any lost AvKARE tissues”.  Former representatives we
have spoke to also have said they were heavily involved in the
stocking and resale of AvKARE inventory.  


MiMedx shared a fax number with AvKARE (a practice
observed in historical frauds such as ArthroCare).


A court-�led transcript of a recording of a current MiMedx
sales manager states that product was “stuffed in our VAs”
to the point where “grafts are spilling out of every cabinet
available to us”.


According to other whistleblower allegations, some of the
excess inventory was intercepted by MiMedx employees and
then hidden in their home or car. One former MiMedx sales
representative we spoke to in a different region than the
whistleblowers corroborated this allegation:

7/10/2019 An Open Letter To The MiMedx Auditors - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-auditors/ 7/16


MiMedx’s contract with AvKARE included product return
rights. According to whistleblower allegations, there was a
separate understanding that:


“Products being kept at employees’ homes? Yes. Yeah.
Absolutely. Yeah. Lots of cases. Yeah. I’ve heard stories,
I’ve heard lots of crazy stuff, things buried or just
thrown away. Really just stuff that turns your stomach” 


After we publicized this, MiMedx stated that “over the
past year, MiMedx has uncovered a few such instances
and have terminated employees for this unacceptable
conduct”.





“If MiMedx sales representatives could not locate
AvKARE tissues that MiMedx shipped directly to VAs
and obtain a purchase order for the re-sale of AvKARE
tissues to the federal government, MiMedx was required
to credit AvKARE for the lost tissue. Hence, AvKARE’s
obligation to pay was implicitly excused until the resale
of the AvKARE tissues to the end customer.” 


This is consistent with a court-�led transcript of a
recording in which a current MiMedx sales manager
states that MiMedx would credit AvKare for missing VA
tissue.  The existence of such credits was reiterated in
an email which expressed concern over “what will
happen to the quarter” if MiMedx provided credit to
AvKARE for missing product.

We fail to understand how MiMedx’s sales to AvKARE meet the
criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB 104”).  Especially because this
arrangement appears to meet characteristics described in the SEC’s
interpretative response of SAB 104 that would speci�cally preclude

revenue recognition. The interpretative response (emphasis ours)
states in pertinent part that:


“Other situations may exist where title to delivered
products passes to a buyer, but the substance of the
transaction is that of a consignment or a
�nancing….the presence of one or more of the
following characteristics in a transaction precludes
revenue recognition even if title to the product has
passed to the buyer:


The buyer has the right to return the product and:


(a) the buyer does not pay the seller at the time of sale,
and the buyer is not obligated to pay the seller at a
speci�ed date or dates.


(b) the buyer does not pay the seller at the time of sale
but rather is obligated to pay at a speci�ed date or
dates, and the buyer’s obligation to pay is contractually
or implicitly excused until the buyer resells the product
or subsequently consumes or uses the product


(c) the buyer’s obligation to the seller would be
changed (e.g., the seller would forgive the obligation or
grant a refund) in the event of theft or physical
destruction or damage of the product


(d) the buyer acquiring the product for resale does not
have economic substance apart from that provided by
the seller


(e) the seller has signi�cant obligations for future
performance to directly bring about resale of the
product by the buyer.

MiMedx’s Commercial Distributor & Agent Network


ArthroCare’s fraud relied on a distributor managed by a former
company sales manager. ArthroCare then used this “captive”
distributor to recognize revenue on shipments of excess product at
the end of quarters to meet Wall Street analysts forecasts, rather
than the distributor’s actual orders.  Furthermore, “evidence at trial
further showed that ArthroCare’s distributors agreed to accept
shipment of millions of dollars of products in exchange for special
conditions, including substantial, upfront cash commissions…
allowing ArthroCare to falsely in�ate revenue by tens of millions of
dollars”. This background is precisely why we believe the
irregularities and undisclosed entanglements that exist between
MiMedx and multiple distributors and agents are so problematic:


Two MiMedx distributors, CPM Medical and SLR Medical, are
identi�ed in Florida court documents �led by one of
MiMedx’s whistleblowers as having special undisclosed
agreements along with an unidenti�ed third having a “house
account”. MiMedx allegedly uses these agreements to
engage in channel stu�ng and manipulate its �nancials.  An
investigative news company, the Capitol Forum, also reported
of an alleged MiMedx scheme to load product onto a truck
and be “driven around the corner like it was going to a
wholesaler”.


The court documents cite speci�c order amounts with totals
implying that CPM was over a 5% customer for MiMedx
during 2015. For example, the whistleblower states that CPM
made roughly $2.5 million of purchases immediately before
the end of Q1 2015, an order that would have been directly
responsible for MiMedx’s ability to meet its guidance of
$40.8 million during that quarter. ThePCAOB stated that
ArthroCare’s audit partner “failed to properly evaluate
numerous indicators that should have alerted him to the
possibility that ArthroCare was improperly recognizing


should be reported separately from other inventory in
the consignor’s �nancial statements as “inventory
consigned to others” or another appropriate caption.”

revenue”.  One of these indicators was a “pattern of quarter-
end spikes” in distributor sales.


The owner of CPM Medical, Mark Brooks, “was personal
friends with the MiMedx Vice President of Sales, Mike
Carlton”, according the whistleblower’s court �ling. An
investigator from another investor visited CPM’s
headquarters and asked for Mr. Brooks but was instead
referred to a man named Bill Cochrane. Cochrane is MiMedx’s
former National Sales Director. Asked about his role, Mr.
Cochrane said he is “a consultant to distributors” before
producing a card for a business named “AZ Biomedical”.  Mr.
Cochrane estimated that the business has over 100
employees and holds inventory that includes MiMedx
product as well as spine & orthopedic hardware.


Although MiMedx has told investors that “the relationship
between CPM and MiMedx ended in 2015, with our last
shipment in July of 2015”, CPM (dba “AmbioMed”) �led a
2018 tissue bank registration to “store” and “distribute”
MiMedx product. A web of at least 53 different LLCs are
registered to CPM’s Richardson, Texas address, including a
now inactive tissue bank, Trident Spine, that was storing
MiMedx product at the address of a self-storage center unit
in Florida. Another tissue bank, Palm Springs Partners dba
Maxim Surgical, reports storing and distributing unspeci�ed
amounts of MiMedx product as of 2018 at CPM’s address.
 We question if CPM either had so much excess product that
it has taken multiple years to sell it all or if CPM (or a�liates)
have continued to stock and distribute for MiMedx.


MiMedx has an undisclosed OEM agreement with CPM to
sell product under the “AmbioChoice” trademark, a label that
Mr. Cochrane says he has substantial involvement with.
MiMedx denied that such an agreement exists in court
documents �led as part of its lawsuit against short sellers,
but the most recent tissue bank registrations for MiMedx,
CPM, and Palm Springs Partners each report storing and
distributing AmbioChoice inventory.  Tissue banks registered
to residential homes in Texas also report stocking and
distributing AmbioChoice. We also obtained a publicly posted
photo of AmbioChoice believed to have been captured in

2017.  If MiMedx’s relationship with CPM has ended, where is
AmbioChoice coming from?


CPM Medical was recently acquired by a publicly traded
entity named Fuse Medical, which both CPM and SLR had
previously supplied. Fuse �led a 2018 registration as a tissue
bank storing products that include AmbioChoice.  Fuse is
also a physician owned distributor and its SEC �lings name
over 40 podiatrists across the country who received
membership interests in Fuse. Mr. Cochrane also stated he
was involved in Fuse’s operations even prior to the
acquisition of CPM.


SLR Medical is currently owned by a now-former MiMedx
Sales Director, Jerry Morrison. SLR was treated as a “house
account” that received highly favorable �nancing terms in
exchange for making end of quarter purchases at MiMedx’s
request, according to whistleblower allegations. Some
excess product was also allegedly stored in the home of a
former MiMedx employee that went to work for SLR.


After we questioned if SLR is an undisclosed related party in
our initial research report, MiMedx claimed that:

7/10/2019 An Open Letter To The MiMedx Auditors - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-auditors/ 13/16


One of the principles of SLR is a former MiMedx
employee.  After the CPM contract ended, he left the
company to join his �ancé (now wife) who previously
managed the distributorship. SLR then became the
MiMedx distributor in the Texas territory and replaced
CPM. There was no contract or sales between SLR and
MiMedx while the principle of SLR was an employee


But this assertion is directly contradicted by records
from an FDA inspection of SLR Medical in January
2015, when Mr. Morrison appears to have still been
employed by MiMedx.  As a result, we continue to view
SLR Medical as an undisclosed related party:


1)  The FDA documents name Mr. Morrison as
“responsible for all operations” and “the sole owner of
the �rm” since its founding in 2010


2) Although MiMedx claims Mr. Morrison’s wife
controlled SLR prior to Mr. Morrison’s arrival, the FDA
records name her as merely an o�ce manager that had
been with the �rm only two years.


3) The records state that SLR was storing and
distributing “amniotic membrane allograft”
(presumably MiMedx).  Furthermore, “Mr. Morrison
stated the �rm directly picks up the HCT/Ps [human
tissue] and then immediately distributes via [redacted]
or a courier service.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/open-letter-mimedx-auditors/ 14/16


MiMedx has attempted to dismiss these irregularities by claiming
that its sales to distributors represent less than 5% of sales, creating
the impression that these sales relationships are minimal in size. But
we �nd this misleading because we learned that SLR Medical, for
example, does most of its business as a sales agent for MiMedx
(receiving commissions) rather than just as a distributor. MiMedx
classi�es sales through agents as “direct” sales and has refused to
speci�cally disclose what portion of its overall sales come through
agents.  We therefore believe the true size of these third party sales
relationships is both highly material and substantially bigger than
MiMedx has represented.


We �nd this problematic because ArthroCare’s primary distributor

from the company that were recorded as operating expenses. These
fee payments, in turn, helped the distributor �nance its inventory
purchases from the company because a substantial portion was
treated as a reduction in the receivable owed (which had the added
bene�t of reducing ArthroCares days sales outstanding calculation).
In addition, according to the SEC, “ArthroCare also in�ated revenue
by mischaracterizing volume-based commission payments to
distributors as fees for services. This enabled ArthroCare to record
the gross amount of the sale as revenue and expense the
commission, rather than recording the net revenue of the sale, as
required by GAAP.”  The PCAOB also stated that the auditors failed to
recognize “ArthroCare’s contradictory treatment of [the distributor] as
a reseller for revenue recognition purposes but as an agent for
purposes of service fee accounting”.


We believe that MiMedx’s relationship with AvKARE, CPM, SLR, and
their a�liates should be reviewed under PCOAB standards which
provide that in the case of “signi�cant transactions that are outside
the normal course of business for the entity [under audit], or that
otherwise appear to be unusual given the auditor’s understanding of
the entity and its environment”.  In addition to distributor sales, we
believe this review should encompass the accounting for any and all
sales agent commission and consulting fees paid to these entities
and their a�liates.  Especially because MiMedx displays
anomalously high SG&A expenses which range above 70% of sales
as compared to approximately 30% for many small cap medical
companies.  We also note that the PCAOB states that the auditor
“should gain an understanding of the business rationale for such
transactions and whether that rationale (or the lack thereof)
suggests that the transactions may have been entered into to
engage in fraudulent �nancial reporting.  Considerations [among
other things] include whether “parties that do not have the substance
or the �nancial strength to support the transaction without
assistance from the entity under audit”.


We possess additional documentation that we believe is material to
your audit, including certain whistleblower documents involving
tissue tagging irregularities.  This information can only be supplied
to you on a con�dential basis to protect individuals from the
company’s aggressive attempts to intimidate and harass those with

knowledge of wrongdoing.  The PCAOB has stated that “When an
auditor is confronted with multiple indicators of problematic revenue
recognition … he or she must get to the bottom of the relevant issues,
including digging into management’s representations.” We stand
ready to assist you in this effort and sincerely appreciate your
attention to this extremely important matter.
