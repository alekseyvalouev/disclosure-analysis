“Let’s not forget the proven safety pro�le of MiMedx allografts and the
fact that we have distributed over 1 million grafts without a single
reported adverse reaction. While a number of competitors have begun
selling new products that utilize different processing and
con�guration techniques, we believe MiMedx birth tissue products
provide the greatest safety for the patients.”


–Chris Cashman, MiMedx Chief Commercialization O�cer


 


MiMedx aggressively markets its placenta-based products to
patients despite not having obtained any FDA approval (read
previous report).  Instead, former CEO Parker Petit has said that
“mother nature did safety and e�cacy testing on the tissue”.  MiMedx
operates in a regulatory gray area for biologics known as
“enforcement discretion” under which, as recently explained by the
Wall Street Journal, “the FDA allows such product to be sold,
provided its use doesn’t raise safety concerns”.  MiMedx boldly
claims on its website that it has “distributed more than 1 million
allografts to date with zero reported adverse reactions attributed to
our products”.  The company has previously been accused by other
short sellers of covering up adverse events, which MiMedx
vehemently denied on its now-deleted short selling commentary
page.

Yet, according to a lawsuit �led earlier this month, an Epi�x patient
suffered an adverse reaction so severe that she was left permanently
maimed.  We view this as highly problematic because undisclosed
adverse reactions, especially of this character, could potentially
cause the FDA to pull MiMedx products from the marketplace.


The lawsuit was �led by a patient against Dr. Shar Hashemi and the
Nerve, Bone & Joint Institute on August 6, 2018 in Virginia Circuit
Court for Fairfax County (Available Here Case No. 2018 11634).   The
patient states that Dr. Hashemi performed a hand surgery on her to
relieve carpal tunnel and used MiMedx’s Epi�x allograft “to minimize
scar tissue formation”.  The suit contends Hashemi’s use of Epi�x
was reckless and experimental (Note: you should assume that
defendants deny all allegations referenced in this suit).


The suit states that “the introduction of the EpiFix into the surgical
wound caused an in�ammatory reaction which is depicted in the
photograph attached” (posted above). We showed the photo to two
individuals with medical backgrounds who immediately identi�ed
this as a severe and highly unusual reaction.  According to the suit,
the Epi�x “caused neurological and muscular injuries which persist
to this day and are re�ected in pain upon use of the hand and
impaired function”.  Not only did this lead to “discoloration and
dis�gurement which is permanent”, but the “introduction of Epi�x
into the surgical wound has exacerbated the management of the

patient’s Lyme Disease, which in turn has restricted the palliative
treatments she can receive”.


The suit alleges that Epi�x caused the in�ammatory reaction after
Hashemi improperly applied the Epi�x by inserting it into the surgical
wound as opposed to applying it externally. But even if the product
was misused, the severe adverse reaction the patient experienced is
troubling because it appears consistent with a systemic response.
This reaction is concerning because it could have resulted from an
unidenti�ed allergen in the product, which is precisely why robust
clinical trials are required to gain FDA approvals.  If the product is
completely sterile and safe, we question why an improper application
would catalyze such a severe response?  Especially since other
MiMedx products derived from the same placental tissues as Epi�x
are speci�cally intended to be injected inside patients. We also can’t
rule out the possibility that the Epi�x had a contaminant and are
concerned by the undisclosed form 483 issued by FDA inspectors in
2016 which stated that MiMedx’s micronized manufacturing
process, among other things, “fails to address bacteriostasis and
fungistatis testing”, “endotoxin validation is inadequate”, and “lacks
validation of particle size, distribution, product identity, safety, and
potency”.

The FDA, according to our understanding, uses a risk-based
architecture for evaluating adverse events and its guidance suggests
that incidents with systemic effects on patients are of elevated
concern.  The FDA states that “an adverse reaction means any
noxious and unintended response to any HCT/P for which there is a
reasonable possibility that the HCT/P caused the response”, a
threshold that this incident certainly appears to meet. The lawsuit
states that MiMedx “became aware” of “the patient outcome in this
case”, which indicates the event was reported to MiMedx and that
the company knew of this adverse reaction.  We therefore believe
the evidence presented in this lawsuit directly contradicts MiMedx’s
claim of having “zero” adverse reactions.


Had this patient not �led suit, these details never would have been
revealed to the public.  This causes us to question how many other
adverse events may also have not been disclosed?  We urge the
company’s newly created Ethics Committee Chaired by Luis Aguilar
to immediately investigate this issue.
