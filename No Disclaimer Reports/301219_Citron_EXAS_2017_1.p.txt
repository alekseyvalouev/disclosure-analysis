Every Man and Woman Over The Age of 50 MUST 
read this report from Citron Research. 


 
Citron Research exposes Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) and PROVES 


beyond ANY doubt why this stock will soon be cut in half.  
Short term target:  $20. 


3 to 5 Years:  Likely Single Digit, Potential 0. 
 
Citron has had great success over the past 10 years exposing companies whose 
business model has been to take advantage of a “broken healthcare system” but 
this case is unique.  Most times we see this pattern: 


 A company strategy of exploiting Medicare  


 Making Money, Money, and More Money 


 Marketing a unique product (FDA license or orphan drug, etc.)  


 Dedicated shareholder base  


 No catalyst for change absent a congressional hearing. 
 


For Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS), the situation is the complete opposite   
 


Exact Sciences pushes a cancer test (Cologuard) to the public, inferior by its own 
admission, and loses money doing it.  That is why this $4 billion company is 
mainly owned by passive investing ETFs or other healthcare baskets. 
 


More importantly, as Citron will expose, the key metrics not disclosed by Exact 
Sciences are getting worse, while Medicare pricing inefficiencies end next January 
and investors will be left with a decaying asset with no terminal value.

How Did We Get Here??       
Meet Cologuard:  A Seriously Inferior Product 
and a Disastrous Business Model 





Cologuard is a branded laboratory-based scan for DNA traces in stool samples 
indicating colorectal cancer.  In a move that surprised many, and despite its lack 
of effectiveness, Cologuard was approved by the FDA and for Medicare 
reimbursement in 2014.  This was ostensibly to encourage some sort of screening 
by the significant portion of the general public who are reluctant to have routine 
colonoscopy, which is the recommended standard of care. Then, due to a little-
known loophole in Obamacare, it became obligatory for insurance 
reimbursement for certain classes of “approved list” diagnostics – even if they 
aren’t standard of care. And with that, Exact Sciences was off to the races. 
 


Cologuard is Not the Standard of Care for Colon Cancer Screening.  
And There’s a Good Reason for that.  
 


Exact Sciences markets (aggressively, to end user consumers) a “poop in a box” 
test for colorectal cancer, the rationale being that is less fear-inducing for many 
people than colonoscopy.  So, as crazy as this might sound, a $4 billion company 
exists because some men think they are “too cool” (or too scared) to get a 
colonoscopy, despite the real dangers of colon cancer. 
 
If anyone remembers Valeant’s Jublia, the overpriced toe fungus treatment that 
was marketed directly to consumers, then Cologuard should truly offend you. 
Colorectal cancer is a lot more dangerous than toenail fungus.  The strategy of 
direct-to-public advertising places Exact Sciences in the role of endangering 
potential colonoscopy patients, by encouraging them to not accept their own 
doctors’ guidance.    
 
Unlike anything we have ever seen before, Exact Science admits its product is 
inferior to both less expensive tests and the standard of care. 
 
As published in Gastro Journal in 2016, these are the results of the test on 
Cologuard from a study conducted at Stanford University Medical Center.  (MT-
sDNA is the clinical term for Cologuard):

What’s particularly shocking about this study is that Exact Sciences funded it! 
They rolled the dice to hopefully get a positive study and they lost, and now they 
try to pretend investors and insurance companies won’t notice the truth. 
 


It Gets Worse For The “Science” that is not Exact. 
 


United Healthcare, the largest managed healthcare company in the United States 
who is a thought leader in diagnostics declared last month:

US/Assets/ProviderStaticFiles/ProviderStaticFilesPdf/Tools%20and%20Resources/Policies%20and%20Protocols/M


edical%20Policies/Medical%20Policies/Fecal_DNA_Testing.pdf 





It should be noted in healthcare that United’s Optum business is the gold 
standard of assessing costs benefit of a procedure in a “big data” population 
health framework.  It should come as no surprise their conclusion aligned with the 
company’s own study. 
 


 When the nation’s largest managed care provider refuses to reimburse for what 
it considers to be an inferior and not cost effective diagnostic method for 
colorectal cancer, how in the world can Exact ever grow into profitability?  


“Fecal DNA testing for colorectal cancer screening and/or monitoring is 
unproven and not medically necessary. There is insufficient published 
evidence in the clinical literature supporting the diagnostic accuracy of fecal 
DNA tests to screen for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk 
patients. The gold standard for colorectal cancer screening is optical 
colonoscopy. There is insufficient published evidence comparing fecal DNA 
testing to optical colonoscopy. In fact, there is insufficient published clinical 
evidence that fecal DNA testing reduces the likelihood of mortality from 
colorectal cancer. 


“In a Markov model, we found FIT and colonoscopy to be more 
effective and less costly than the MT-sDNA test when 
participation rates were equal for all strategies.

The costs of selling inferior technology-- and Proof the Model 


is imploding NOW.   
 
The company put up a lot of noise this quarter because it announced 100,000 
tests for the first time.  But look at the unsustainable acquisition costs for its 
growth:

Where is the leverage?  With Medicare reimbursement now fully pipelined, sales 
and marketing cost per test should be plummeting, demonstrating the 
company’s ability to accrue leverage from its huge marketing push.  
 


But it’s not.  The numbers show sales and marketing per test has bottomed, and 
may in fact be climbing again.

*Note:  We could write another page about how their shift to accrual accounting 
helped juice up the quarter but the story is so much bigger than that. 





Citron Now exposes the most devastating number for Exact’s future:   


Prescriptions per Physician.   
 


1.4 orders per physician per quarter is the number, and it has been in flat line for 
the last two years!   This key metric is not disclosed by Exact; Citron has used the 
company’s financials to back out this critical measurement. Here’s our homework:
Citron Research  May 15, 2017 Page 6 of 13 
Exact Sciences
Citron Research  May 15, 2017 Page 7 of 13 
Exact Sciences 


If doctors were each ordering more, this business might become scalable. But, in 
a reaffirmation in the trust we put in healthcare providers … despite the millions 
of dollars spent on sales force and marketing, doctors are not ordering more 
Cologuard tests.  Despite over $223 million in operating expenses to generate $99 
million in revenues, these results show no sign of generating increasing recurring 
revenues to propel the business toward breakeven. 
 


This number can only get worse, as Exact’s sales force has already gone for the 
low hanging fruit, the most prominent and active 60,000 General Practice 
Physicians.  
 


Not only is Cologuard failing to gain any leverage with doctors, consumer 
awareness is not on the rise either. As you can see below from the Google Trends 
chart, the company started their marketing campaign last spring and searches for 
Cologuard are still dependant on expenscive commericals; there is no market 
momentum evident in this data.

This is the profile of a marketing company simply paying for revenue….What is 
amazing is Exact could boost revenues another $100 million or even $200 million, 
and it still wouldn’t be materially closer to making a profit.  
 


Astoundingly, the super-bullish Cowen analyst who touted this stock last week 
thinks the company will scream higher from their current revenue run rate of 
$200 million – he thinks they might get to $700 million by 2019….but even at 
350% of their current run rate, he can’t show them making a profit before  2020. 
 


In a simple box, the revenue and unit growth required to get from here to 
breakeven is over 240% beyond their best quarter ever, and to obtain a 
reasonable profit, over 400%.

The Next Catalyst: 
Medicare Pricing Will Fall  
Starting in January 2018  
   


From Exact’s most recent conference call: 
 


  
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4066308-exact-sciences-exas-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-


transcript?part=single 
 


Medicare currently reimburses $512 for Cologuard, way higher than Exact’s ASP 
per test of $442.  Running basic math yields an estimate of the non-Medicare ASP 
of $285 to $350.   
 
As PAMA takes effect in January 2018, Exact’s top-of-the-market Medicare 
reimbursement rate cannot stand.  
 
To show how low test pricing can go, just refer to Exact’s lawsuit against 
Humana… Exact has filed suit against Humana reimbursement of 4,664 Cologuard 
tests that Humana deemed “medically unnecessary” [Link]– the same finding that 
highly prestigious United Healthcare just published.   
 


“So the Medicare price in the future will be determined statutorily under 
the (protecting access to Medicare) PAMA Act, and that will be based off 
the median price of the commercial payers. So there is a mechanism for 
that price to move and it's by statute, not by any other method. But the 
bigger point there is that by screening people --- well, right now 
Medicare pays about 75% of the nearly $20 billion in treating colon 
cancer. Colon cancer is one of the most expensive cancers to treat, and 
Medicare is paying the price for that. We think, over time, the total cost 
comes down that Medicare pays when you look at screening and 
treatment combined and obviously, the human impact is significant.”

The lawsuit gives us a key data point – Humana was paying appx $171.00 per test.  
Remember, according to PAMA, Medicare pricing will have to conform to the 
average of non-Medicare pricing starting next year.  
 


So we’ve done the math for them.  They stated on the Q1 cc that their ASP was 
$442.  Assuming 70% of their revenues comes from Medicare at its current 
reimbursement rate of $509 per test, the average insurance reimbursement rate 
would be $285. 
 


Even using a high-side $350 per test reimbursement from Medicare, the Gross 
Margin drops to %55.1, devastates Exact’s breakeven calculation, making its 20x 
EPS hurdle looks unreachable.

It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to guess, that with all these concerns surrounding

“Note to Exact’s CFO:  If Medicare is 70% of your revenues (IS IT ?), and you know 
that pricing gets reduced next year -- we just don't know how much -- then how are 


you moving towards profitability?  Are your commercials going to cost 40% less????”

* To put in perspective how ludicrous the Exact share price is consider this: 
A few years ago, Myriad (MYGN) established the BRCA gold standard for breast

current run rate).

Terminal Value of Exact Science Might be $0 
 


Anyone who follows the landscape of diagnostic cancer testing knows that 
everything is moving towards blood based DNA testing.  Any doctor in the field 
will tell you it is just a matter of time.  Poop in a box will probably be a medical 
dinosaur in 4 years and the value of Exact’s only asset will be 0.  While they have 
an early-stage pipeline of other tests, Exact Sciences in not nearly as funded or 
dedicated as the many private and public companies that are advancing cancer 
testing. 
 


While Exact’s management was sitting with its creative team brainstorming cute 
commercials, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Google were busy funding Grail with $1 
billion to further blood based DNA testing: 


http://medcitynews.com/2017/03/grail-freenome-liquid-biopsies/

These are just two of the many companies who will forge the future of cancer 
testing.  Investors in Exact are left with a $4 billion poop-in-a-box company ... that 
loses money.

  Conclusion 


It has taken every bit of restraint to not fill this piece with shit jokes.  Citron 
refrained because colon cancer is the second largest cancer killer in the world and 
we wanted to make sure we didn’t distract attention from this preeminent point.   
 


We believe Exact Sciences is what happens when Wall Street meets bad medicine; 
we are confident in our prognosis about the outcomes.  In writing this piece 
Citron was encouraged that doctors still want to practice good medicine and that 
Medicare has policies in place to close pricing loopholes -- two ultimate positives 
for our healthcare system.  If you are 50, go to your doctor and follow their 
orders.  This is life – it’s more than a cute commercial. 
 


Cautious Investing to All 





Editor’s Rant on Colon Cancer: 
 
Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer detection and 
prevention.  That gives it a 100% sensitivity score – virtually all colon cancers are 
detected during routine colonoscopy.  A recent broad study by Kaiser measured 
just how effective colonoscopy is.  In a large, demographically adjusted, long term 
study published just recently, Kaiser found that death rates were 300% higher in 
comparable populations who weren’t being screened using colonoscopy.   


http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(16)34617-0/abstract 
 


Part of this success rate is that colonoscopic procedures routinely remove pre-
cancerous polyps.  The stool test of course can’t do this.  So colonoscopy gets 


“If Valeant went away tomorrow, a lot of people would still depend on their 
products.  While their capital structure is questionable, there is an asset base 
of viable products underpinning the company.  If Exact Sciences went away 
tomorrow, the medical community would not care, and patients would be 
better for it … there’s no real asset base.

such great results because it is both diagnostic and preventative.  Patients with a 
clean Cologuard test think they’ve avoided colonoscopy, but in actuality they’ve 
signed up for an 8 in 100 false negative rate (they have undetected cancer), and 
they’ve avoided the removal of pre-cancerous polyps that could be exposing them 
to future cancers.  
 


Missing 8 in 100 cancers is not 8% less than perfect.  It is in fact inviting patients 
to play Russian Roulette.  So the cutesy commercials that encourage patients to 
opt for a test less invasive and fear-inducing than colonoscopy are actually inviting 
patients to waste their money, while opting for a test which may increase their 
chances of developing colon cancer in the future.   
 


Compare that last statement to Kaiser’s dramatic results from its colonoscopy 
study (above), and you have a clear comparison: 
 


 A diagnostic path with a proven 67% reduction in colorectal cancer 
deaths. 


… OR … 
 


 A diagnostic choice with no clinical evidence of reduction in likelihood of 
mortality from colorectal cancer.   But cute commercials.  And it’s more 
convenient… if you don’t get sick.  





Welcome to the U.S. healthcare system, 2017 edition. Highest per capita cost in 
the world, but run-of-the-mill patient outcomes.  Exact Sciences is part of the 
explanation.
