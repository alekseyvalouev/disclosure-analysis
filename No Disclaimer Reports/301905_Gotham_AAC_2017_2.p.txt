GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH LLC 





AAC Technologies LTD (Ticker = 2018):  


Why are AAC’s reported profit margins  


higher AND smoother than Apple’s? Part I  





GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS 


 AAC has used 20+ undisclosed related parties & dubious accounting to overstate & smoothen 
profits since 2014.  In this regard, AAC reminds us of Longtop Financial Technologies. 


 AAC has used these hidden entities to evade Apple’s labor standards specified in the Apple 
Supplier Code of Conduct. 


Example #2: ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials 沈阳中北通磁科技股份有限公司 


Gotham City Research has reason to believe that ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials is a significant 
undisclosed related party:  


 The company estimated it would enter into RMB 150 million transactions with AAC in 2016. 
 ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials declared itself (in its filings) as a related party supplier to AAC 


because Ingrid Wu, one of the unit’s main shareholders and board members, shares the same 
name as the woman who is the wife of AAC CEO Mr. Pan and an AAC board member.  


 In contrast, AAC has never disclosed ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials in its annual report.

GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT: 


 AAC has used 20+ undisclosed related parties & dubious 
accounting to overstate & smoothen profits since 2014.   


 At least 20 undisclosed related party suppliers are owned 
or managed by AAC CEO’s family members or employees. 


 These undisclosed related party suppliers are not listed in 
Apple’s supplier list, despite some claiming otherwise. 


 Some of the undisclosed related entities supply the same 
products as AAC does, are based in the same locations as 
AAC is, & hire employees under AAC’s name. 


 AAC has used these hidden entities to evade Apple’s labor 
standards specified in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct. 


 Apple (and other parties) will conduct independent 
investigations, & validate our findings. As a result, AAC’s 
profit margins will decline, converging to its peers’ levels. 


 AAC is in violation of Hong Kong listing rules, Apple’s 
supplier code of conduct, and its own representations.  


OBSERVATIONS 


 AAC’s operating profit margins have been unusually high & 
smooth relative to its peers & Apple, since 2014. 


 AAC’s costs per employee is less than half its peers’.  
 AAC has no listed CFO since 2010, per its annual reports. 
 Chunyuan Wu, the wife of AAC’s CEO, is a member of 


AAC’s audit & risk committee. 
 AAC had 3 COOs within 1 year (2013-2014), around the 


same time AAC’s margins became unusually smooth. 
 AAC’s auditor, Deloitte, is considered the Audit Firm That 


Has Had the Most Trouble in China.  
 AAC’s relationship with respect to its undisclosed related 


parties reminds us of Longtop Financial Technologies’ 
relationship with its undisclosed related parties. 


 AAC’s 2016 audit fee as a % of revenue is only 0.02%, 
lower than Let’s Gowex’s (a Spanish fraud, where 90% of 
the revenues were fake).

INTRODUCTION 


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH first heard about AAC Technologies LTD in 2015, an Apple supplier, when Apple 
was said to have found a defect in components produced by AAC for the Apple Watch.1 With AAC’s stock 
up nearly 3x since then, we decided to re-visit AAC recently. Upon a cursory review, AAC appears to be an 
exceptionally good company with notably higher and smoother margins relative to its peers2: 





AAC margins are so good, it has reported higher & smoother margins than Apple, Google, & Microsoft3: 





What is AAC Technologies’ “secret sauce”? How does AAC, an Apple supplier, achieve higher and 
smoother profit margins than Apple, Google, & Microsoft? Some have attributed AAC’s superior & smooth 
margins to a myriad of factors, such as workforce automation.4 While some of these explanations may 
sound plausible, we see it differently.  


In our opinion, the evidence supports a more nefarious explanation: AAC uses undisclosed related party 
suppliers to inflate and smoothen its margins. Such an explanation may seem far-fetched, except that 
there are a number of case studies of companies that relied on nearly identical schemes to overstate 
profits (and whose share prices subsequently declined). Take for example, Longtop Financial Technologies 
Ltd (“LFT”), a formerly US-listed Chinese company that used undisclosed related parties to overstate its 
profits.5 In this regard, AAC reminds us of LFT (coincidentally, AAC uses the same auditor as LFT did).  


Unlike certain schemes that can last indefinitely, Gotham City Research believes that AAC’s apparent 
schemes will come to an end shortly. We believe Apple (and other parties) will conduct their own 
investigations, and independently come to similar conclusions as we have. 


We believe shares will initially decline to 40 HKD - 50 HKD per share, as the undisclosed related party 
supplier revelations are digested.  We see far greater downside potential if the company were to 
concurrently experience the same problems that other Apple suppliers have in the past, e.g. increased 
competition, pricing pressure from its customers, wage inflation, etc. In this and coming report(s), we 
will explain our case for these opinions.

Does AAC Use Undisclosed Related Parties to Inflate Profits? 


AAC Gross Margins are Exceptionally High and Smooth – Are Margins Too Good to Be True? 


“When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that 
bird a duck” – James Whitcomb Riley 


AAC Technologies Ltd is an Apple supplier based primarily in China. AAC has managed to report 
exceptionally high and smooth profit margins since 2014, especially when compared against its direct 
competitors (which sport lower and volatile margins – typical of other Apple suppliers)1: 











AAC profit margins were not always this smooth. The company’s margins were less smooth prior to 2014:

Extraordinary claims merit extraordinary explanations 


What is AAC’s secret sauce? Why have AAC’s margins been particularly smooth since 2014? In our 
experience, companies that make extraordinary claims – for example, report exceptionally high and 
smooth profit margins – are extreme outliers2:  





is AAC more like a Google, Microsoft, or Apple – exceptionally good companies: 





Or is AAC more like Longtop Financial Technologies or Quindell – fraudulent companies:

The company’s explanation regarding its “good” margins seems insufficient 


In the case of Google, Microsoft, and Apple, their extraordinary feats are apparent. All three companies 
have changed the world, pushing the human race forward. It is difficult to imagine a world where one of 
those companies were to suddenly disappear. Can we say the same about AAC Technologies? Is there 
extraordinary evidence that explains the exceptionally high and smooth profit margins? The company 
claims that its gross margins can be explained by the following3: 


The Company is a world-class Total Technology Solution Provider. The Company delivers customer 
focused solutions across many technology segments. Not only has the Company invested in 
advanced materials research, product designs and building up intellectual property portfolio, the 
Company has also invested heavily in manufacturing automation to achieve operational 
excellence in manufacturing efficiency. The above form the bases of the Company’s good gross 
margins achieved. 


Gotham City Research believes that the company’s explanations do not sufficiently explain its 
anomalously high and smooth profit margins since 2014 for the following reasons: 


 Evidence of significant undisclosed related party companies. Undisclosed related parties were 
present in both the Quindell & Longtop Group frauds.  


 Additional observations that cast doubt on the company’s explanations regarding its profit 
margins, as we detail later in this report. 


A better explanation: undisclosed related parties & dubious accounting to overstate earnings? 


We did, in fact, find extraordinary evidence, but of a different variety. This evidence – which include local 
filings & field research – suggests that there are at least 20 undisclosed entities are managed and/or 
owned by associates of AAC’s CEO. We summarize below the relationships which the evidence suggests 
are involved4: 





The issue with our findings is that the presence of substantial undisclosed related party transactions tends 
to be symptomatic of companies like Quindell and Longtop Financial Technologies, not good companies 
such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

Are undisclosed associated parties used to offload costs? I of II 


AAC may be using undisclosed entities to offload around 1.5 billion RMB in costs 


In this and the next sections, we take a closer look at the evidence that certain parties are related to AAC. 
We focus on the largest we could identify, per local filings, some of which we list below1:  








Gotham City Research estimates: 


 total exposure to these entities to be at least 1.5 billion RMB. 
 Total employee count of these entities to be at least 6,000 employees. 
 These entities seem to be owned, managed, and/or controlled by associates of AAC’s CEO. 
 None of these entities are mentioned in AAC’s financial reports. 


In this section we will take a closer look at: 


 SuQian QiXiang 宿迁启祥电子科技有限公司 


 ShuYang LiSheng 沭阳丽声电子有限公司

SuQian QiXiang 宿迁启祥电子科技有限公司 


The evidence suggests that AAC formed SuQian QiXiang at the same time that AAC entered the haptic 
engine market. AAC may have created this entity to offload the huge development costs that are often 
associated with a new smartphone launch.  


Reasons we believe SuQian QiXiang might be a significant related party/supplier2:  


 SuQian QiXiang generated RMB 554 million of revenue in 2015, making it one of AAC’s largest 
component suppliers, per our estimates. 


 Is estimated to employee ~1000 people. 
 The unit specializes in the production of haptic motors & other mobile phone components.  
 The company was established in 2015, the same year that AAC began selling haptic motors with 


anomalously high profit margins relative to its peers.   
 SuQian QiXiang describes itself as a division of AAC, yet AAC has never disclosed SuQian QiXiang 


in AAC’s annual reports. 


 SuQian QiXiang is owned by 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong, per local filings. A man by the same 


name is described as AAC Chairman’s assistant. 
 AAC hasn’t disclosed that the unit seems to be owned by the assistant to AAC’s chairman,  
 SuQian QiXiang appears to operate within AAC’s manufacturing complex. 
 SuQian QiXiang reported property, plant, & equipment of RMB 52 million at the end of 2015. 
 Its PP&E as % of Revenue is only 10% which is quite low when compared against 85% for AAC 


and 60% for Goertek. This may imply that AAC books SuQian QiXiang at the parent company 
level rather than at the SuQian QiXiang level. We believe that AAC’s most recent earnings call 
validates our opinion. 


 AAC posted a 50% gross profit margin on haptic motors in 2015 while SuQian QiXiang only 
earned a 15% gross profit margin on RMB 554 million worth of haptic motor sales to AAC in the 
same year. 


The profit margin discrepancy is particularly surprising given that SuQian QiXiang appears to operate in 
the same complex as AAC’s primary production site in SuYang and produces broadly the same products 
as AAC.

In online job postings SuQian QiXiang describes itself as an AAC division 


Further questions of a subsidiary-like relationship surfaced on a Jiangsu province job board posting 
where SuQian QiXiang was listed as a division of AAC4:
Page 15 of 43 
 


Another source shows a similar self-description5:  





SuQian QiXiang owners include 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong, per local filings. A man by the same name is  


pictured below at an AAC event. He is described as the Chairman’s Assistant6:
Page 16 of 43 
 


Evidence that 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong’s ties run deeper than SuQian QiXiang  


CLSA accused Gotham City Research of making “groundless accusations”, a few days ago in a research 
note titled “No alternative facts”.  One of CLSA’s key claims7: 


In AAC’s donation signing ceremony for Peking University, the University website misreported 
Huang Yong Dong as the assistant to the CEO. Huang was never an employee of AAC. 


It is not clear to us what evidence – if any – exists to support CLSA’s above assertion. To the contrary, we 
find the following evidence that shows Huang Yong Dong is in fact tied to AAC8: 


 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong’s connection to SuQian QiXiang (as explained in this section). 


 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong’s connection to 连泰精密科技江苏有限公司/Lian Tai Precision, as 


discussed later in this report. 


 黄勇东/Huang Yong Dong is listed as the legal representative/supervisor of 


瑞迅供应链管理（常州）有限公司 a subsidiary of AAC until recently, per local filings. 





If Huang Yong Dong was/is not an employee of AAC, why is it that he is listed as the legal 


representative/supervisor of 瑞迅供应链管理（常州）有限公司 , described as a subsidiary of AAC9:
Page 17 of 43 
 


瑞迅供应链管理（常州）有限公司 described as a subsidiary of AAC until October 2016  


This entity – which was never disclosed by AAC in its annual reports – was described as a subsidiary of 
AAC until recently10: 





Despite the apparent changes since October 2016, does AAC still exert control and/or influence? We ask 
this question because the contact email address for this entity is still listed as 
AAC151@AACTECHNOLOGIES.COM, which is the web domain of AAC11:
Page 18 of 43 
 


ShuYang LiSheng 沭阳丽声电子有限公司 


The evidence suggests that ShuYang LiSheng, may be a significant undisclosed AAC associate12: 


 ShuYang LiSheng reported ~RMB480 million of revenue, making it one of AAC’s largest suppliers.  
 Its operating margin of 2.4% is a tiny fraction compared to AAC’s operating margin. 
 With only RMB15.6 million of PPE in 2015, its PP&E as a % of revenue is only 3% versus AAC’s 


85%. Like in the case of SuQian QiXiang, this may imply that AAC books Shuyang Lisheng’s PP&E 
at the parent company level rather than at the SuQian QiXiang level. We believe that AAC’s most 
recent earnings call validates our opinion. 


 This separate entity employs about 2,000-3000 people. 


 Shuyang Li Sheng is owned by two shareholders. Mr. Li李翔, a name shared by an AAC 


executive, and Pan Shi Nan潘世南, a name shared by the uncle to AAC’s CEO.  


 AAC has never disclosed the unit as a related party.  
 The unit produces the same products from the same location as AAC and seems to recruit new 


employees under AAC’s banner.  
 ShuYang LiSheng has 4 unconsolidated subsidiaries two of which may have links to AAC.  One 


subsidiary, 连泰精密科技江苏有限公司/Lian Tai Precision, will be discussed in detail later.  


A Mr. Li listed as an AAC high level executive in an AAC presentation13
Page 19 of 43 
 


ShuYang LiSheng, like SuQian QiXian, appears to be operating within AAC’s Shuyang Economic 
Development Zone, as satellite images show: 


LiSheng operates inside of AAC’s manufacturing complex





Shuyang LiSheng recruits employees under the AAC banner and descriptions on the web state that 
ShuYang LiSheng is a subsidiary/division of AAC Tech:14
Page 20 of 43 
 


ShuYang LiSheng’s second unconsolidated subsidiary ChangZhou LiSheng may also have links to AAC.  A 
recent job listing describes ChangZhou LiSheng as part of the AAC Group. ChangZhou LiSheng recruits 
employees under the AAC corporate name15:  











A local credit report provides further evidence that LiSheng is related to AAC16: 


Translation:  


 “[LiSheng] is mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale of electronic devices business, its 
products include micro-speakers, receiver, headphones, vibration motors. 


 The target company is an affiliated enterprise of AAC Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. and has 
passed ISO09001, ISO14001 certification system. Its products are mainly used in mobile phones, 
computer manufacturing and other industries. 


 Target company sells domestically, AAC Technology (Shuyang) Co., Ltd. is responsible for the 
company’s sales activities. Final customers include Samsung, Apple and other brand enterprises. 


 Target company procures raw materials domestically, generally in East China.”

Are undisclosed associated parties used to offload costs? II of II 


AAC may be using undisclosed entities to offload at least 1.5 billion RMB in costs 


In this section, we continue our examination by looking at other undisclosed related parties. We focus on:  


 Xuan Ying Tong 深圳市轩盈通电子有限公司 


 ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials 沈阳中北通磁科技股份有限公司 


 Lian Tai Precision连泰精密科技江苏有限公司 





Xuan Ying Tong 深圳市轩盈通电子有限公司 


We believe Xuan Ying Tong may be a significant undisclosed related party for the following reasons1:  


 Xuan Ying Tong seems like an AAC distributor of cell phone speakers, receivers, microphones.   
 Produces the same products as AAC and even describes itself as part of AAC in public records. 
 In 2015, Xuan Ying Tong generated revenues of RMB349 million. 
 The entity generated an operating loss, even while AAC generated a best-of-class 27.4% 


operating margin in the same year.   
 Xuan Ying Tong has de minimis property plant and equipment (less than RMB 1 million).   
 Pan Shi Nan, (a name coincidentally shared by the uncle to AAC’s CEO and is coincidentally tied 


to several entities mentioned in this report) is described as the unit’s general manager.  
 For some reason, Xuan Ying Tong generated a loss in 2015 even though AAC simultaneously 


reported industry leading profit margins. 


潘世南 Pan Shi Nan: AAC CEO’s uncle or just a coincidence? 


潘世南 (Pan Shi Nan) is the general manager of Xuan Ying Tong2, and as previously mentioned in this 
report, shares the same name as the uncle to AAC’s CEO. Pan Shi Nan seems a very important figure, as 
evidenced by his extensive involvement in many entities with possible ties to AAC, as shown below3: 





AAC’s disclosed related party transactions between the company and family members of the CEO and 
his wife, as shown in its annual reports, would indicate that if Pan Shi Nan were AAC CEO’s uncle, it 
would expand on a well-established pattern of behavior. 


Company Name (in English) Company Name (in Chinese) Product (SAIC Registration Disclosure) Possible Relationship to AAC
ShuYang LiSheng 沭阳丽声电子有限公司 Cell phone components Shareholders are AAC executive and uncle of AAC CEO
LianTai Precision 连泰精密科技江苏有限公司 Cell phone casing Subsidiary of ShuYang LiSheng
ChangZhou LiSheng 常州丽声科技有限公司 Cell phone components Subsidiary of ShuYang LiSheng
JiangSu Boruitong 江苏博瑞通磁业有限公司 Magnetic material (for use in electronic components) Subsidiary of ShuYang LiSheng

XuanYingTong Electronics 深圳市轩盈通电子有限公司 Distribution of cell phone components Manager is uncle of AAC CEO
YangTai Electronics 常州市祥泰电子有限公司 Electronics components Uncle of AAC CEO is shareholder
DongGuan RuiSheng Electronics 东莞市瑞昇电子有限公司 Electronics components Shareholders are AAC executive and uncle of AAC CEO
HeSheng Precision 江苏和声精密科技有限公司 Machine parts Uncle of AAC CEO is shareholder
Page 22 of 43 
 


Public sources show that 深圳市轩盈通电子有限公司/Xuan Ying Tong describes itself as part of AAC, 
despite not being listed on AAC’s official subsidiary list4:  











ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials 沈阳中北通磁科技股份有限公司 


Gotham City Research has reason to believe that ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials is a significant 
undisclosed related party for the following reasons5:  


 ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials makes magnetic components for electrical devices that are 
sold to AAC. 


 ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials declared itself a related party supplier to AAC. 
 Ingrid Wu, one of the unit’s main shareholders and board members, shares the same name as 


the woman who is the wife of AAC CEO Mr. Pan and an AAC board member.  
 In contrast, AAC hasn’t made the same disclosure in its annual reports.  
 The company estimated that it would enter into RMB 150 million worth of transactions with 


AAC in 2016. 


 The unit, is also known as 沈阳中北通磁/Su Yang Zhong Bei.  


ZhongBeiTong Magnetic Materials appears to be partly owned by Ingrid Wu, who shares the same name 
as the woman who is the wife of AAC’s CEO and an AAC director. A woman by the name Ms. Wu is also a 
board member of Su Yang Zhong Bei. The unit has already declared that it’s a related party to AAC, 
according to a local Chinese filing but AAC hasn’t made a similar disclosure:
Page 23 of 43 
 








Coincidentally, the CEO’s wife’s family members are listed as connected persons in AAC’s most recent 
annual report6:
Page 24 of 43 
 


Lian Tai Precision 连泰精密科技江苏有限公司 


Gotham City Research has reason to believe that Lian Tai Precision is an undisclosed related party for 
the following reasons7:  


 In 2016, Lian Tai generated revenue of RMB104 million and CNY-33.7 million of operating losses.  
 Lian Tai is described as employing between 1,800-4,000 people. 
 Is supposedly an independent AAC supplier-- AAC has never disclosed the unit as a related party. 
 Lian Tai cites Apple as a customer.  
 Lian Tai may be owned by the uncle of AAC’s CEO.  
 Lian Tai could be a prime example of AAC’s apparent modus operandi whereby AAC may be 


using a parallel off balance sheet entities to produce identical products during the ramp stage of 
production. 


 In addition to 黄勇东 Huang Yong Dong and 潘世南 Pan Shi Nan – who may have ties to AAC 


and some of the entities mentioned earlier in this report – there is a man by the name of Sun 


Wenjing (孙文静) who may be connected to AAC as well.   


Remember 黄勇东 Huang Yong Dong and 潘世南 Pan Shi Nan? Coincidences? 


Lian Tai is owned by a Hong Kong company called United Land Holdings which is owned by Huang Yong 
Dong and Pan Shi Nan. As discussed earlier, the former appears to be an employee of AAC and the latter 
shares the same name as the uncle of the CEO. Both men appear to play critical roles in the entities 
identified in this report. 


Lian Tai was recently transferred by the earlier discussed LiSheng to a Hong Kong entity 


裕联集团有限公司/United Land (HK), which is owned by Huang Yong Dong and Pan Shi Nan. (Source: 


Hong Kong Corporate Filing). United Land ownership file in Hong Kong reveals it is owned again by a 
person sharing the same as AAC’s Assistant to the CEO and the CEO’s uncle8:
Page 25 of 43 
 


孙文静 Sun Wenjing appears connected to AAC and Lian Tai: another coincidence? 


Like 黄勇东 Huang Yong Dong and 潘世南 Pan Shi Nan, Sun Wenjing appears to be an important figure with respect 


to several possible undisclosed related parties. He is referred to as a representative/key member of Lian Tai per SAIC 
registration filings9:

Based on a site visit to Lian Tai Precision, Address: 


江苏省沭阳县沭城镇经济开发区北园区永嘉路 40号_ , Lian Tai’s factory has the AAC logo on the 
outside rather than its own name13: 








It is our understanding that someone in Chinese social media, as well as a Citigroup Asia employee, 
accused us of photoshopping and/or fabricating the above images. We did not; in fact, AAC in its responses 
last week seems to have validated our findings, that the AAC logo appeared on those buildings show above. 
We would not be surprised if more recent claims discrediting us – for example, that “Lian Tai’s owner 
has no relationship with AAC’s CEO Pan. He is not a relative, a family member nor an (ex) employee” 
turns out to be false, as well.
Page 31 of 43 
 


Lian Tai in employment recruiting adverts claims it is one of Apple’s partners, clearly using this connection 
to attract recruits14:  





We know based on Apple’s supplier disclosures, that Apple does not purchase casing from AAC. 


Based on additional field research related to Lian Tai, we found: 


 All sales inquiries were directed to AAC; Lian Tai does not appear to have a sales department. 
 According to the site visits, Lian Tai primarily produces cell phone casings and other cell phone 


components; Lian Tai began operations in March 2016.  
 Local sources allege that Lian Tai may be reliant on AAC for all of its orders.  


Please see the Lian Tai Precision-related appendix section for more information.
Page 32 of 43 
 


Additional inconsistencies we see with AAC’s explanations 


The company’s explanation for its apparent success  


Gotham City Research is skeptical of AAC’s explanations as to why its margins are so high, for reasons 
beyond those described in prior sections.  


The company’s explanations seem dubious for these additional reasons: 


 Free cash flow has been consistently lower than net income since 2007 (only about 24% of profits). 
 Despite its highly-touted investment in automation, employee count growth actually exceeded 


revenue growth from 2013 to 2016.  
 Capex vs automation explanation - AAC completed the major phase of automation production (in 


2012 AR) 
 It’s unclear how much of an automation edge AAC has over its peers, given that AAC’s automation 


development has been ongoing since 2007, according to Credit Suisse. 
 If AAC’s margins are as high and smooth as reported, why haven’t Apple, Samsung, or other 


handset makers entered the space and/or vertically integrated to enjoy the cost savings for 
themselves? 


 Boasting about patents – IBM has many patents, but is not seen as an innovator. 
 AAC’s explanations regarding its margin advantage don’t explain the quarterly smoothness, even 


when revenues decline quarter over quarter. 





Free cash flow has been cumulatively only ~25% of net income, since 2007 


Since 2007, free cash flow has been cumulatively a tiny fraction of net income.  Over the long term, free 
cash flow is seen by many as a measure of true earnings power. Companies whose free cash flow is 
consistently lower than its accounting earnings tend to exhibit low earnings quality. The variance between 
free cash flow and net income does not seem supportive of the company’s explanations regarding its 
“good” margins, even after accounting for growth capital spending (the variance just seems too wide)1: 





The above may suggest aggressive accounting 101 for a highflying stock where the internal incentives for 
management are tied to the stock price and stock liquidity—rather than maximizing cash flow.

* - we define FCF as cash flow from operations less capex
Page 33 of 43 
 


If AAC has invested heavily in automation, why has cumulative employee count growth exceeded 
cumulative revenue growth since 2013? 


Revenue nearly doubled between 2013 and 2016, while employee count more than doubled during the 
same time period2: 





The company and some Wall Street Analysts have referenced automation as a driver of better margins, 
yet we see no evidence of improved operational efficiency as gauged by revenue growth per employee 
growth. In fact, the above table does not include the employee counts of the undisclosed entities we 
discussed earlier in this report. If we were to combine the employees of those entities, this would cast 
further doubts regarding the claimed margin advantage AAC enjoys. 


Adding further suspicion: in 2013, AAC actually attributed its reduction in employee count (which 
coincided with an increase in revenue) to the success of its ‘ongoing automation programme’3:  


As at 31st December, 2013, the Group employed 23,011 permanent employees, a reduction from 
a total of 26,575 as at 31st December, 2012, brought about by the Company’s ongoing 
automation programme. 


Using AAC’s own implied logic, would this not suggest that AAC’s automation programme has failed in 
its objectives, seeing that employee growth since then has exceeded revenue growth? How did margins 
remain so high and smooth since 2013? 


How is AAC’s automation superior to its peers if SG&A + R&D spending per employee is a fraction of its 
peers?4

If AAC’s automation development began in 2007, what has kept its competitors or customers from 
simply replicating their “secret sauce”? 


According to Credit Suisse, AAC’s “proprietary automation” development began in 20075: 





What has kept AAC’s competitors and/or the Apple, Samsung, etc. of the world, from achieving the 
same margins as AAC? The margin variance, recall, is quite dramatic6:

Valuation 


Why we believe shares are worth no more than 40-50 HKD per share 


We use two different methodologies for the purpose of valuation: 


1. Free cash flow as a more accurate measure of earnings. 
2. Adjusting AAC’s earnings for possible offloading of costs via the undisclosed related parties.  


Free cash flow approach implies up to -70% downside 


Free cash flow has consistently been a small fraction of reported earnings, and over a long time horizon1: 





Assumptions: 


 Let’s be conservative and use 5.32 HKD per share (which is on the high end of consensus estimates) 
as our estimate for 2017 EPS.  


 We believe that AAC’s true earnings is closer to 25% of whatever earnings is reported, given the 
historical variances between free cash flow and earnings as shown above. 


 25% of 5.32 HKD per share implies a true earnings power of around 1.33 per share. 
 If we apply a 20x-30x P/E multiple we arrive at a measure of intrinsic value closer to 27-40 HKD 


per share, implying significant downside (up to -70% downside) from current market prices. 


Adjusted earnings approach implies shares are worth around 40-50 HKD per share 


We believe investors may have failed to take account for what appears to be suspect accounting based 
on our findings discussed earlier in this report; specifically, we estimate that at least RMB1.5 billion of 
costs might be off AAC's books. We make the following adjustments: 


Adjustments/assumptions: 


 40% of the revenues come from haptics and 60% come from acoustics & other. 
 AAC's revenue will grow 24% this year. 
 We applied operating margins of 12%-15% (using Goertek and Nidec’s margins as proxies); this is 


the adjustment factor for the suspect behavior we flagged in this report. 
 We use a 20x-25x P/E multiple for 2017 to arrive at a stock price of HKD 41/share based on a 0.886 


Chinese yuan to Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange rate. 


We do not penalize AAC for possible competitive pressures and threats, as other Apple suppliers have 
faced; shares would be worth meaningfully less than 40-50 HKD per share, if AAC were to face such threats. 


AAC's free cash flow* is consistently lower than net income
RMB '000 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2007-2016

现在连太精密科技有限公司只是租用了鸿利达的厂房几年（可能是出于节约成本的考虑）而之所以连泰会租用鸿利达的厂房是因为鸿


利 经营达 不善几乎倒闭 


因为我无法进入厂内 所以只能绕厂一周 拍摄照片 





在厂房的墙壁上你能看到“瑞声科技”四个大字 也就是 AAC集团的中文名称   


我认为连泰精密 之所以没有把它们的名字印在厂房墙壁上是因为现在这个工厂还不归他们所有 


但是我认为这也足以证明这个工厂现在是瑞声的分厂

一些远景拍摄你可以看到这只有三个车间 且每个车间长度都超过了 200米

关于为什么我可以确认这里就是连泰精密工厂 


这是因为我有在网络上查看他们的招聘信息 上面有写他们的详细地址 


链接如下 


http://qy.58.com/13599122782215/ 


招聘信息写到连泰精密工厂位于 县经济 发沭阳 开 区永嘉路 40号 





而下图中 卫门 室墙壁上的蓝色标牌也写着永嘉路 40号 


图片不是特别清晰 是因为那里 卫门 太多我无法太靠近  


同时我也跟附近的居民以及工人 认过确  这个工厂就是连泰精密
