Carson Block's Value Investing Congress
Presentation: Short 500.com (WBAI)


We're posting up notes from the 2014 Value Investing Congress in New York. Next


up is Carson Block of Muddy Waters Research who talked about short selling/fraud


and presented a new short idea: 500.com (WBAI). His presentation was called


"Avoiding Blue Pill Investing." 








Carson Block's Value Investing Congress Presentation  





• Obvious reference to The Matrix – some investors tend to “take the blue pill”


during bullish times or  in other words, willfully ignore negative signs. Carson says


if you have taken the blue pill, you need   to be prepared to unwind quickly when


the inevitable mean reversion rears its head 





Many things tilt the playing field against investors: 





Management 


o Often short-term focused. To remedy, check the proxy and remember the absolute


dollar  value of comp. If a CEO can earn $30mm in 3 years, that's short term any


way you slice it.   


o CEOs tend to be charismatic, and the more successful a CEO is, the less willing


he/she is to   being held accountable  


o Solution: management is better seen, not heard. Reading transcripts is better


than listening   to calls.   


o Compare transcripts chronologically, looking for disappearing initiatives and


changes in   language. Are questions systematically evaded? If so, which ones? Are


questions often the   same each quarter? If so, ask yourself if sell side seems too


close to management to ask the   hard questions  


o Insider selling is also very significant. 10b-5 plans are smart because they give


management   cover/deniable plausibility. They can also lock in value of their


shares without actually selling

Board of Directors 


o Often have a symbiotic relationship with CEOs  


o Insulated from negligence liability by BJR, insulated from other liability by D&O


insurance  


o Many directors view directorships as perquisites, not responsibilities.   


o Independent investigations often “shambolic” 





Lawyers 


o Never forget that lawyers represent the interest of their clients, or the people who


hire and  pay them  


o Prestigious law firms are a surprisingly effective fig leaf and are great at writing  


indecipherable prose. If you ever find yourself reading a passage in a filing and,


halfway   through, realize that you didn’t understand anything, that is probably on


purpose  


o Attorney-client privilege hides acts of corporate wrongdoing and   


o "Fraud lawyers are eternal" - John Hempton 





Auditors 


o Auditors are completely misunderstood by the investing community. Like lawyers,


they  represent the interest of their clients (the people who pay them)  


o Auditing is a profession that rewards failure. Why? Whenever a company is found


to   potentially have serious fraud, the accounting issues lock the auditor to its


accounting firm   “for life”  


o Reason: Say you're an accounting firm and a partner had a blowup. You can’t


throw   them out because you immediately worry about other clients that they've


audited. The   accounting firm has imperfect information, doesn’t know when they'll


get sued and for   what. Therefore they want to keep these bad actors around to


exculpate the firm from   liability  


o Audit is also a profession that fights accountability. The PCOB is trying to keep


auditors’   names from being disclosed on publicly filed documents  


o Audits aren't designed to detect fraud. Instead they presume that documents not


forged   and that management is telling the truth  


o The most important function of the auditor is cash confirmation at year/quarter. A


lot of this   is gruntwork that is done by juniors. As investors we have no idea how


thorough the cash  confirmation was and it tends to be more cursory. This isn't just


a China problem either 





Banks 


o The bank’s imperative is to sell financial product. Analysts aren’t rewarded for


skepticism.  Like audit work, junior bankers tend to do the key due diligence tasks

o Can actually be a great source for short ideas. The SEC should investigate  


o S1 filings often cite market research that is fabricated. Companies pay for it,


provide the   data, and feed the research house people that they should talk for


their “research”  


o Research houses are provide people to talk to. No disclaimer.   


o Tianhe short idea – Carson says they aren’t in it, but Anonymous Analytics made


a good   point that the research firm that the company used completely fabricated


the data 





Thoughts on Chinese companies: 


• China is to stock fraud as Silicon Valley is to tech  


• Country is run as a kleptocracy... should we be surprised that companies are as


well?   


• Investors have become complacent once again about the risks  


• No fraudster from China has ever been meaningfully punished for defrauding


North American   investors. Carson doesn't blame the Chinese for this because US


and Chinese courts don't recognize   judgments against each other. The US simply


has no jurisdiction   


• VIEs: owner of listcos don't even own the operating company. Look at tax rates for


proof 





Recent Lessons Learned From Shorts: RAX, BLNX.LN, X Group (Eike Batista's


fallen empire) 


• RAX: Investors were lost in the word 'cloud' when RAX was at its core a plain old


internet host with  no magic to the business. Larry Ellison ranted on the stupidity


of the market’s obsession with the   cloud in 2009, saying that the cloud is just a


computer. RAX CEO was also selling an image of being a   technologist (went as far


as to wear Google Glass to speaking panels... looked ridiculous)  


• BLNX.LN: Harvard Professor Ben Edelman is a bit of an “internet sheriff” and


good to follow. He   published a report on Blinkx, alleging that they were


defrauding customers. Muddy Waters dug   deeper and saw evidence of the same  


• X Group: Batista was obsessed with passing Carlos Slim to be wealthiest person


in the world. Carson   saw him speak in 2011 and said he was very nationalistic


and claimed that his group of companies   was what Brazil deserves. Q&A was also


a joke. One questioner went as far as to ask what he would  do if he were president 








New Short: 500.com (WBAI) 





• Sells online sports lotto tickets with a $1.2bn market cap and 37x P/E  


• Market expects that WBAI will be explicitly authorized to sell sport lotto tickets


but that will only   open up to more competition  


• 500.com is selling on behalf of provincial lotteries. 500.com gets 10-11% fees

which are far in excess   of the 5-6% that others are getting in the industry  


• When the new regulatory regime is implemented, fees will come down to 4%  


• Chinese Ministry of Finance also prohibits cross-border sales of these tickets and


it seems like seems   like 500.com is selling cross-border, particularly in Jianxi


province  


• If that’s not enough, 500.com has been playing the lottery themselves and


actually won $2mm from   playing the lottery in 2013 (50% of pretax income) 


• Major red flag – employee bank accounts are used to collect winnings. 500.com


claims that you  have to be a natural person to get paid and this is why they set it


up this way. Carson thinks this   makes it extremely easy to commit fraud  


• Another flag – discrepancy between claimed mobile downloads and downloads as


indicated on 3rd  party sites
