Technical Observations on UDC’s Underlying
Experimentation.


Posted on October 8, 2013 by asensio.com


Tuesday, October 8, 2013.   The following technical observations are


a supplement to the asensio.com report on Universal Display Corp.


(“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) titled “The Real Origins of Universal


Display’s OLED claims.” These observations are intended as support


for asensio.com’s finding that the laboratory work that is the basis


for UDC’s key patents represents trivial, mundane, optimizing


experimentation.


The observations below are based on a review of publicly available


data on UDC’s experiments provided in the DARPA presentation and


the EP-238 patent specification itself. These represent some of the


observations that are available to the lay person with expert


guidance. The documents are available at the Universal Display


Data Room here: Experimentation Disclosure: EP-238 and


Experimentation Disclosure: DARPA


Figure 1 is schematic representation of a typical OLED with a


heterostructure showing the presence of Ir(ppy)3, which is well-


known to generate usable light when used as phosphorescent


emitter material in an electronic device. Figure 1A shows the Ir


compound. Figure 1B shows the host compound that’s represented


in the heterostructure as CBP. Figure 1C shows the compound used


as a barrier layer that’s represented in the schematic for the


heterostructure as BCP.


Figure 2 simply shows the performance of the heterostructure


presented in Figure 1 with six different combinations, varying the


amounts of the Ir and the host materials shown in Figure 1. Figure 2


shows the performance of the configured OLED when the barrier


layer is removed or the host is changed, essentially ruining the


performance of the device as expected. UDC didn’t claim a new

invented barrier layer or host, but merely used existing parts. For


this small, routine, common process, the performance among the


limited OLEDs built without difficulty leads to the conclusion that


the best-performing of the few tested combinations is 6% Ir and


94% host with a barrier layer. Other countless part combinations


were not disclosed.


Figure 3 merely shows the efficiency of the use or consumption of


voltage compared to the amount of light generated by the device


represented in Figure 1. Figure 3 also changes the intensity of the


electrical current to determine the color of the light emitted by the


device represented in Figure 1.


Some of the DARPA slides appear complicated at first. But to anyone


with experience in this type of lab work what appears sophisticated


is actually common and mundane. For instance, in one experiment


the emitting molecule was mixed with four chemicals: namely,


Benzene, Chloroform, Methanol and Dimethyl Sulfoxide. They were


agitated, and the reaction was measured by standard, commonplace


ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. This is a procedure that is


routinely used in analytical chemistry particularly in the selection


of substances during routine optimization work. This work does not


require expensive or even the customized equipment required in


fundamental ultrafast chemical experimental research. Another


disclosure shows experiments using several heterostructures with


different set ups, which represent simple minor changes in the


thickness of the parts. Again this is typical is routine optimization


work. It shows commercially available equipment used to perform


common procedures that were already a routine part of the


fabrication of OLEDs.


Another example of the simplicity of the DARPA experiment is seen


on page 56 of the DARPA document; in the lower left-hand box there


is another schematic representation of a heterostructure. This one


uses platinum in CBP showing that it is identical to EP-238. Both


devices use virtually identical heterostructures, and both of course


were well known at time.
