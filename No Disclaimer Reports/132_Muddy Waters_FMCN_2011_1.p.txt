FMCN has been fraudulently overstating the number of 
screens in its LCD network by approximately 50%. This is 
similar to China MediaExpress Holdings, Inc. (OTC: CCME), 
which we reported is a fraud on February 3, 2011.  We there-
fore question whether FMCN’s core LCD business is viable.


Like Olympus, FMCN is significantly and deliberately over-
paying for acquisitions, writing down $1.1 billion out of $1.6 
billion in acquisitions since 2005. These write-downs are 
equivalent to one-third of FMCN’s present enterprise value.


Our research shows that FMCN has claimed to acquire, write 
down, and dispose of companies that it never actually 
purchased.  Investors should be concerned about to where cash 
actually moved in these transactions, and about the integrity of 
reported results.


FMCN has written at least 21 acquisitions down to zero and 
then given them away for no consideration.  We show that 
many of these write-downs are not justified. There are several 
possible nefarious reasons FMCN gives acquisitions away, 
including doing so may put FMCN’s problems beyond the 
reach of auditors.


Insiders have used FMCN as their counterparty in trading in 
and out of FMCN subsidiary Allyes, with several individuals 
earning a total of at least $70.1 million, while shareholders lost 
$159.6 million. 


Sales of FMCN shares by insiders have netted them at least 
$1.7 billion since FMCN went public in 2005.
I. Introduction – FMCN: The Olympus of China 
 
Muddy Waters rates Focus Media Holding Ltd. (NASDAQ: FMCN) shares a Strong 
Sell because of significant overstatement of the number of screens in its LCD network 
and its Olympus-style acquisition overpayments.  The $1.1 billion1 in write-downs from 
its acquisitions exceed one-third of FMCN’s enterprise value, making FMCN’s 
acquisitive behavior more destructive than Olympus’s to shareholder value.  FMCN 
insiders have sold at least $1.7 billion worth of stock (two-thirds of FMCN’s enterprise 
value) since FMCN’s IPO. 2  At the same time, the insiders and their business associates 
further enrich themselves by trading in FMCN assets, while costing FMCN 
shareholders substantial sums of money. 
 


• FMCN has been fraudulently overstating the number of screens in its LCD 
network by approximately 50% – particularly in Tier I cities.  FMCN claims to 
operate 178,382 screens,3 but the actual number in FMCN’s media kit is less 
than 120,000.  This is similar to China MediaExpress Holdings, Inc. (OTC: 
CCME), which we reported is a fraud on February 3, 2011.  We therefore 
question whether FMCN’s core LCD business is viable.   
 


• Like Olympus, FMCN is significantly and deliberately overpaying for 
acquisitions, writing down $1.1 billion out of $1.6 billion in acquisitions since 
2005.4  These write-downs are equivalent to one-third of FMCN’s present 
enterprise value.  FMCN’s overpayments include fraudulently booking at least 
six mobile handset advertising acquisitions that it never made.   


 
Olympus’s situation may explain why FMCN overpays for acquisitions.  
Olympus management has stated that Olympus deliberately overpaid for 
acquisitions in order to disguise losses on investments.  Questions remain about 
whether individuals associated with these transactions also pocketed the money, 
and / or whether the acquisitions were really used to cover losses in Olympus’s 
seemingly robust core business. 


 
Like Olympus, FMCN could be hiding losses through its overpayments – this is 
particularly plausible, given its overstatement of LCD screens.  Another possible 
reason FMCN overpays for acquisitions could include recycling acquisition 
consideration back into FMCN’s revenue line.  It is also possible that capex is 
being misappropriated, which is probably the most common reason for capital 
expenditure inflation in China. 


 
• Our research shows that FMCN has claimed to acquire, write down, and dispose 


of companies that it never actually purchased.  Investors should be concerned

about to where cash actually moved in these transactions, and about the integrity 
of reported results. 


 
• FMCN has written at least 21 acquisitions down to zero and then given them 


away for no consideration.  We show that many of these write-downs are not 
justified. There are several possible nefarious reasons FMCN gives acquisitions 
away, including doing so may put FMCN’s problems beyond the reach of 
auditors. 
 


• Insiders have used FMCN as their counterparty in trading in and out of FMCN 
subsidiary Allyes, with several individuals earning a total of at least $70.1 
million,5 while shareholders lost $159.6 million.6   


 
• Sales of FMCN shares by insiders have netted them at least $1.7 billion since 


FMCN went public in 2005.  
 


• FMCN took a rare winner and sold it for a loss to its joint venture partner.  
FMCN had invested in an internet advertising JV with Dentsu, and the JV looks 
to have been doing phenomenally well.  Last year, FMCN transferred the 
entirety of its shares to Dentsu for less than FMCN had invested in the company.  
We suspect that the reason for the bargain sale was to clear the way for FMCN 
insiders to enter into another self-dealing transaction. 
 


• FMCN insiders have maneuvered themselves to the front of the line to cash in 
on the expected IPO of one of FMCN’s subsidiaries.  Insiders and an investment 
bank that is financing their purchase of shares have acquired 49% of Hua 
Guang.  Shareholders will likely see tens of millions of dollars in losses from 
this transaction. 
 


• FMCN’s board is incapable of exercising good corporate governance.  It is too 
well-paid and connected to management through business transactions outside of 
FMCN. 


 
Muddy Waters believes that many of the items we discuss in this report are 
symptomatic of a highly troubled enterprise that is run solely for the benefit of insiders.  
The problems we have uncovered are likely the tip of the iceberg, and in some cases 
may reflect periodic medicine that must be given to FMCN in order to keep up 
appearances of health.  While some of the behavior we discuss occurred before 2010, 
investors should ask themselves whether management has successfully completed a 12-

step program to stop abusing shareholders.  Recent self-dealing transactions indicate 
that is unlikely. 
 
II. Organization of this Report 
 
This report primarily highlights three behaviors: Olympus-style acquisition 
overpayments, unjustified write-downs in order to dispose of acquisitions likely for 
non-good faith reasons, and continuous insider self-dealing.  The report illustrates these 
behaviors in Parts VI through VII and XIV through highlights of FMCN transactions 
that are relevant to these behaviors.  We provide full summaries of the transactions in 
Parts VII through XIII. 
 
III.  About this Report 
 
Muddy Waters’s team had a team of 12 people with expertise in accounting, finance, 
law, advertising, and entrepreneurship began working on FMCN this summer.  We 
initially became concerned about the company because of its peculiar acquisition 
activity.   
 
Muddy Waters’s research process was exhaustive, and included reading and analyzing 
the SAIC7 files for 160 companies, all of FMCN’s conference call transcripts, and all of 
FMCN’s SEC filings and press releases.  In addition, we conducted extensive fieldwork 
and spoke with a variety of industry experts.  While in the middle of our work on 
FMCN, Olympus’s now-former CEO made front-page news by exposing the 
questionable series of acquisitions and payments Olympus had made.  It is one of the 
more remarkable coincidences of our team members’ careers. 
 
IV. Summary 
 
LCD Screen Fraudulent Overstatement and Misrepresentations 
 
FMCN materially overstates the number of LCD screens in its core business.  FMCN’s 
SEC filings state that it has 178,3828 screens, while according to its media kit, it has 
fewer than 120,000, a 50% overstatement.  It actually has fewer than 30,000 screens in 
Tier I cities, despite claiming to have in excess of 50,000 Tier I screens.9  (We estimate 
that Tier I effective advertising rates are approximately 141.9% higher than those of 
Tier II cities.)   
 
FMCN claims that the majority of its LCD screen network is in “heavy-traffic areas of 
commercial office buildings”;10 however, network-wide only approximately 30% of 
screens are in office buildings.  The remainder of the screens is almost all in residential

buildings.  Residential buildings result in far fewer impressions for advertisers than do 
office buildings.  The number of people who work on one floor of an office building is 
roughly equivalent to the number of people living in a whole residential tower.  
Residential buildings therefore tend to have about 5% of the impressions that office 
buildings do. 
 
Goodwill Hunting at the Olympus Games 
 
It is indisputable that FMCN routinely overpays for acquisitions.  It has written off $1.1 
billion out of approximately $1.6 billion in acquisitions. 11   (The total of write-downs is 
greater than one-third of FMCN’s present enterprise value, and is responsible for 
FMCN’s accumulated deficit since going public of $437.4 million.12)  A Tyco-esque 
$902.3 million of these write-downs were of goodwill.  
 
After taking these write-downs, FMCN gave away, for no consideration, at least 21 of 
the companies it had acquired – including one that had not been disclosed.  We believe 
that FMCN could be unjustifiably impairing to zero and giving away these companies in 
order to move its problems out of sight from its auditors, or because it is returning 
borrowed businesses (along with borrowed revenue and profit). 
 
The question is whether this abysmal track record is due to management merely being 
incompetent, or whether they are deliberately overpaying.  Based on our research into 
the following transactions, we have no doubt that FMCN’s overpayments are deliberate 
– just as Olympus’s are.  The following transactions support that thesis: 
 


• Six mobile handset advertising companies that FMCN never actually 
acquired.  FMCN claimed to acquire these companies between 3/1/2007 and 
10/1/2007 for total consideration of $46.3 million.1314  FMCN then claimed to 
impair these companies to zero in 2008, and return them to their original 
shareholders.  However, the acquisitions (and obviously disposals) never 
occurred.  The fact that these acquisitions never occurred has important 
implications for the whereabouts of the cash FMCN claimed to pay, as well as 
the integrity of FMCN’s reported results. 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
11 FMCN does not make it easy to determine how much it spends on acquisitions. We estimated this 
number based on segment-level and subsidiary-level disclosures made in their quarterly and annual 
filings, line items from their consolidated financial statements, and items disclosed in their notes to the 
consolidated financial statements

• Zong Heng Pin Yu (“ZHPY”), a company that operated a LED advertising 
boat (the Captain Six) on a river in Shanghai.  FMCN booked $27.4 million 
in expenses for this acquisition, 15 despite ZHPY having established a market 
value for itself four months earlier of only $3.7 million.16  FMCN then paid at 
least an additional $12.4 million for the Captain Six.17  We estimate that the 
Captain Six should have cost no more than $3.9 million.18 


 
• Allyes, an internet advertising company.  FMCN acquired Allyes for $296.9 


million, and wrote it down to $78.5 million nine months later.19  Chairman & 
CEO Jason Jiang, board member & venture capital star Neil Shen,20 and close 
business associate of Mr. Jiang & venture capital star Xiong Xiangdong were 
among the selling shareholders of Allyes at the rich price.  (Jiang, Xiong, and 
others would subsequently trade into Allyes at an even lower valuation of $35 
million, 21  and then personally make tens of millions of dollars while 
shareholders racked up total losses on Allyes of $159.6 million.22)   


 
• CGEN, a now defunct direct competitor of FMCN’s in the in-store 


advertising space that turned into a $198.4 million23 loss for FMCN.  CGEN 
was such a dramatic failure that Muddy Waters does not believe the acquisition 
was made in good faith.  FMCN bought this company for $168.4 million and 
repaid a $30.0 million loan CGEN owed,24 to impair it only 11 months later to 
zero.25  The purported rationale for acquiring CGEN is bizarre – that essentially 
FMCN would use CGEN as leverage over substantially larger hypermarket 
chains, and coerce them into letting CGEN break its existing leases.26  This was 
clearly a far-fetched idea.27

After writing CGEN down, FMCN gave it away to a company that is associated 
with the aforementioned Xiong Xiangdong (see Allyes supra). 28  That FMCN 
needed a friendly party to act as the trash receptacle for CGEN only heightens 
our suspicions about this transaction. 
 


• FMCN made a string of six small acquisitions in the internet advertising 
space.  These acquisitions were near total losses for FMCN, but provided 
benefit to businesses associated with certain FMCN board members.  During the 
period in which FMCN owned these companies (between 2007 to 2009), these 
acquisitions along with Allyes gave FMCN a reason to spend $198.3 million (up 
from zero in 2006) between 2007 and 2010 on leasing online advertising space 
from related parties in which certain board members had interests.  


 
Impairing Judgment 
 
We conclude that FMCN generally desires to impair its acquisitions – including the six 
phantom acquisitions it never made.  Even assuming FMCN had made the phantom 
acquisitions, it has still overstated its losses on disposal in the Mobile segment by at 
least $26.1 million,29 which is a clear warning sign of cooked books.30  In at least 21 
instances, FMCN has written acquisitions down to zero and given the companies 
away—usually back to their original shareholders.  The rationale for many of these 
write-downs is doubtful.  These unnecessary impairments, often followed by giveaways, 
could serve several nefarious purposes, including making it harder for auditors to detect 
problems.  
 
Among the acquisitions we believe were unjustifiably impaired are: 
 


• Ten mobile handset advertising companies, six of which FMCN never 
actually acquired.  If FMCN never acquired them, obviously it should not 
impair them.  However, FMCN took an impairment charge of $41.8 million on 
these six “acquisitions.”31  Even if they had acquired these six firms, the loss on 
disposal of these 10 companies appears overstated by $26.1 million.  This 
overstatement may indicate cooked books. 
 


• Dotad, an unnecessary write-down of $26.8 million (100%) that smacks of 
impropriety.  Dotad’s CEO under FMCN, Xu Maodong, took over a startup 
competitor, BFTL,32 right after leaving his position at FMCN as Dotad CEO. 33  
FMCN not only failed to enforce a non-compete agreement, but an FMCN

employee34 was one of two transferors of ownership of BFTL to Mr. Xu.  
Further, FMCN transferred one of its subsidiaries, Yitong, to BFTL.  BFTL 
(with Mr. Xu still running it) went on to raise $100 million from Telstra and 
Softbank in 2010,35 and appears to be thriving.  Apparently, the non-compete 
agreement that FMCN touts in all of its 20-F filings does not apply to Mr. Xu: 
 


Generally we enter into a three-year standard employment contract with 
our officers and managers and a one-year standard employment contract 
with other employees. According to these contracts, all of our employees 
are prohibited from engaging in any activities that compete with our 
business during the period of their employment with us. Furthermore, the 
employment contracts with officers or managers include a covenant that 
prohibits officers or managers from engaging in any activities that 
compete with our business for two years after the period of their 
employment with us.36 


 
Dotad did not fare so well.  FMCN impaired the entire purchase price of $26.8 
million.  We do not understand the games that FMCN, Mr. Xu, and the Yitong 
sellers were playing – suffice to say that there is likely substantially more than 
meets the eye.   


 
• Allyes Information Technology Company Limited was impaired a second 


time (after being impaired from $296.9 million to $78.5 million)37 to $32.3 
million38 in order to allow insiders to purchase 38% of it at a bargain price (see 
infra All(Directors Say)Yes to Enriching Insiders).  The purchasing insiders 
flipped the stake seven months later at an implied valuation of $200 million,39 
which is an annualized IRR of 2,127.2%.

conservatively estimate that these transactions netted insiders $70.1 million.40  
FMCN shareholders lost $159.6 million as a result of these transactions.41   
 


• Insiders are continuing to trade against FMCN shareholders in valuable assets 
even this year – insiders and an investment bank acquired from FMCN 49% of a 
profitable traditional billboard advertising company that is likely to go public in 
2012.42  The investment bank financed the insiders’ purchase, presenting an 
even greater conflict of interest between insiders and shareholders.43   


 
• In the public market, insiders have sold at least $1.7 billion of shares since 


FMCN went public.44  With quarterly share grants running around $14 million,45 
insiders ensure a constant supply of shares to sell.  We believe that shareholders 
are mistaken if they think that FMCN’s share buyback is for their benefit – this 
perpetual issue (to insiders) and buyback cycle is merely a less noticeable way 
of transferring money from the shareholders to insiders.  


 
• The board is unable to exercise proper governance, as it consists of individuals 


who are too highly compensated by FMCN.  Furthermore, most of the insiders 
are deeply entangled with one another in business transactions outside of FMCN 
– in a number of cases, these transactions involve venture-capital deals, and 
transactions with other Chinese public companies.  


 
V. Fraudulent Overstatement of Screens and Misrepresentations about Network 
Quality 
 
FMCN overstates its LCD screens by nearly 50%.  FMCN claims that, as of September 
30, 2011, it had 178,382 displays in its network.46   In reality, it presently has 
approximately 120,000 screens.  (The 120,000 screens include about 15,000 screens to 
which FMCN has access through distribution agreements.)  This is approximately 
equivalent to the number of screens FMCN claimed in its 2007 20-F: 112,298.47  This 
fact presents two possibilities: FMCN has not grown its network since 2007, and / or it 
has always been lying about its network size.

FMCN overstates its Tier I screens by approximately 67%.48  According to analysts, 
FMCN states that it has in excess of 50,000 displays in Tier I cities.  It actually has 
fewer than 30,000 such screens.  Further, approximately 10% of its screens in Beijing 
are operated by a distributor, which contradicts FMCN’s statements to investors that it 
owns the entire Tier I network.49  We estimate that Tier I effective advertising rates are 
approximately 141.9% higher than those of Tier II cities.  FMCN states that 
approximately 60% of its LCD network revenue is from Tier I cities.50  
 
FMCN’s real network has a large “Tier Free” skew.  Note that approximately 50,000 
screens (over 40% of the network) are in Tier III and Tier IV cities.  Our research 
indicates that relatively few advertisers are charged for ads shown in Tier III and IV 
cities.  With little potential for revenue in Tier Free cities, the economics of having a 
presence there are questionable.  The screen investment alone is about $20 million,51 
and we imagine that the operating cost of a network that has to be updated by manually 
replacing memory cards weekly is not low. 52    
 
FMCN claims that the majority of its LCD displays are in “heavy-traffic areas of 
commercial office buildings.”53  However, only approximately 30% of FMCN’s screens 
network-wide are in commercial buildings.  In Tier I cities, only approximately 45% of 
FMCN’s screens are in office buildings.  In Tier II cities, only approximately 30% of 
screens are in office buildings.  The balance of screens is substantially all in residential 
buildings.  Residential buildings are inherently less valuable to advertisers than are 
office buildings.  One floor of an office building typically has as much traffic as an 
entire residential tower.  
 
VI. Goodwill Hunting at the Olympus Games 
 
FMCN is deliberately overpaying for acquisitions.  Usually when we see capex inflation 
in China, management is misappropriating the money.  In FMCN’s case, other plausible 
explanations for the overpayments could include burying losses (similar to Olympus), 
and recycling cash that comes back as revenue.  Any combination of these items is 
possible with FMCN – particularly given its fraudulent overstatement of the size of its 
LCD screen network.  Further, in the case of FMCN’s purchase of Allyes, we saw 
FMCN overpaying for a company that FMCN bought in part from FMCN insiders. 
 
It is indisputable that FMCN routinely overpays for acquisitions.  It has written off $1.1 
billion out of approximately $1.6 billion in acquisitions. 54   (The total of write-downs is

54 FMCN does not make it easy to determine how much it spends on acquisitions. We estimated this 
number based on segment-level and subsidiary-level disclosures made in their quarterly and annual

greater than one-third of FMCN’s present enterprise value.)  As a result of these write-
downs, the majority of which have been written down to zero, FMCN has an 
accumulated deficit of $437.4 million.55   
 
Approximately 85% of FMCN’s write-downs consist of goodwill.  (It is a clear warning 
sign when a company writes down goodwill equivalent to 39.7% of its enterprise 
value56  – think TYC in early 2002.)  The question is whether this abysmal track record 
is due to management merely being incompetent, or whether they are deliberately 
overpaying.   
 
Phantom Acquisitions (full discussion in “How to Fail in Business Without Really 
Trying”) 
 
FMCN fraudulently claims to have acquired and disposed of six mobile handset 
advertising companies that it never actually acquired.  It is difficult to think of a clearer 
case of deliberately overpaying for an acquisition (from a GAAP standpoint anyway) 
than claiming to have bought something you did not.   
 
FMCN round-tripped these phantom acquisitions, claiming to have returned them to 
their original shareholders after impairing the total purported consideration of $46.3 
million in 2008.  By claiming to have returned these phantom acquisitions to their 
original shareholders, the non-subsidiaries would presumably be beyond the scope of 
the annual audit. 
 
Paying 7.4x Established Market Value for a Boat Advertising Company (full discussion 
in “Shipwrecked”) 
 
This number is also 30.3x the price specified in the Share Purchase Agreement in the 
SAIC file.  FMCN wrote-off the entire $24.2 million57 it spent on a company, Zong 
Heng Pin Yu (“ZHPY”) that had the right and license to sell advertising on a LED-
equipped boat, the Captain Six, which trawled the Huangpu River in Shanghai.  While 
FMCN actually acquired this company, it is questionable whether it actually paid 
anywhere near $24.2 million for the company.  If it did pay that amount, then it would 
have paid 7.4x the market value the company established only four months earlier when 
it agreed to sell 90% of itself for only $3.3 million.58 
 
ZHPY’s SAIC file contains the equity transfer agreement between the selling 
shareholders and FMCN.  The agreement provides for consideration of only RMB six 
million (approximately $800,000 at the time).  The consideration is broken down into

RMB one million, which the agreement allocates as consideration for ZHPY’s 
registered (i.e., paid-in) capital, and RMB five million as a reserve against potential 
litigation damages. 
 
Only four months prior to selling ZHPY to FMCN, ZHPY’s then-shareholders had 
agreed to sell 90% of ZHPY to another buyer for only $3.3 million.  In selling ZHPY to 
FMCN, the sellers faced a possible breach of contract claim, and thus the litigation 
reserve.  Importantly, the would-be buyer did sue, and the ensuing litigation establishes 
the agreed upon sale price of $3.3 million for the 90% stake of as fact. 
 
Also of note, FMCN acquired the Captain Six for at least $12.4 million59 after buying 
ZHPY.  We estimate that the Captain Six should have cost no more than $3.9 million.60 
 
Overpaying for Allyes When Sellers Include FMCN Insiders (See “All(Directors 
Say)Yes to Enriching Insiders”) 
 
FMCN bought Allyes from a group of shareholders that included FMCN board member 
Neil Shen, the omnipresent Xiong Xiaodong, and likely also chairman / CEO Jason 
Jiang for a total of $296.9 million.  We estimate that this purchase put at least $7.4 
million in profit into the aforementioned individuals’ pockets.  FMCN shareholders did 
less well when FMCN subsequently impaired Allyes to $78.5 million.61  FMCN 
eventually sold Allyes at valuations ranging from $35.0 million (to insiders) to $200.0 
million (to a venture capital firm).  It is clear that FMCN did not effectively manage the 
conflict of interest inherent in this purchase. 
 
Massively Overpaying for a Failing Direct Competitor (See “FMCN Acquires a Direct 
Competitor and Loses $198.4 Million in 11 Months When Bizarre Business Plan Fails”) 
 
FMCN bought its direct competitor in the in-store network space, and wrote the entire 
acquisition off within 11 months.  As part of the purchase agreement, FMCN agreed to 
repay $30.0 million of CGEN’s outstanding debt.  The need for the loan in an asset lite 
business was a clear sign that CGEN had serious issues.   
 
FMCN’s purported rationale in paying richly for CGEN is that after the acquisition, 
CGEN’s landlords would be amenable to renegotiating CGEN’s existing leases to allow 
for lower lease payments.  CGEN’s landlords were hypermarkets, such as Carrefour, 
and are significantly larger in China than the combination of FMCN and CGEN.  We 
are skeptical that FMCN management was really unsophisticated enough to risk in good 
faith this much money on a company and turnaround plan this shaky.

FMCN made a string of six small acquisitions in the internet advertising space.  These 
acquisitions were near total losses for FMCN, but benefitted businesses associated with 
certain FMCN board members.  During the period FMCN owned these businesses, 
FMCN’s spending on internet services provided by related parties went from zero in 
2006 to a total of $178 million between 2007 and 2009.

transactions, undisclosed contingent consideration (numbers for some earn-out items below are purely 
based off of change in goodwill attributed to the resolution of contingent consideration due to lack of any 
direct or other disclosure regarding those payments in those periods.  If there were any other balance

not be captured in the below table), and undisclosed consideration for certain transactions (these were not

Introduction 
 
We conclude that FMCN generally desires to impair its acquisitions.  A number of 
FMCN’s impairments are questionable.  In at least 21 instances, FMCN has impaired 
acquisitions to zero, and then given the companies away without consideration. These 
impairments (particularly with giveaways) could serve several nefarious purposes.  
There seems to be a culture of permissiveness between FMCN and its covering sell-side 
analysts that causes these (and other) problems to go unnoticed. 
 
 “A Zero”…Really? 
 
We conclude that FMCN unjustifiably impairs acquisitions based on our analysis of the 
write-downs and subsequent transfers of 10 mobile handset advertising companies (nine 
of which were purportedly returned to their original shareholders), six smaller internet 
ad companies, one traditional billboard company, and Allyes.  FMCN discloses 
relatively little about its acquisitions; however, from the 21 giveaways for which it has 
provided some detail, there is a clear pattern of unjustifiably writing acquisitions down 
to zero in order to return them to the selling shareholders for zero consideration.  We 
think of many of FMCN’s acquisitions as more of leased business arrangements, rather 
than full acquisitions. 
 
The first set of unjustifiably impaired acquisitions is the 10 mobile handset acquisitions, 
which includes the six phantom mobile handset acquisitions.  One cannot lose on 
disposal what one does not actually have to lose, which makes it plain that the loss on 
disposal is overstated.  Less obviously, even if FMCN had really acquired those six 
companies, its accounting for losses on disposals does not seem to add up.  We believe 
that this imbalance is due to a combination of being required by the SEC to make 
disclosures related to the acquisitions and disposals in a short period of time, and having 
no basis in reality for the numbers.   
 
We calculate that FMCN’s claimed loss on disposal of $91.9 million in 2008 for the 
mobile handset acquisitions (again, assuming it had actually acquired all 10 of them) is 
at least $26.4 million too high.  Our calculation is as follows: 
 





14
In the above calculation, we assume that all A/Rs written off in 2008 were attributable 
to mobile handsets, which is a conservative assumption.  FMCN’s only disclosed PP&E 
write-down in 2008 was in its LCD segment,63 so a PP&E write-down should not 
account for the $26.1 million difference above.  Further, the mobile companies typically 
have $70,000 (RMB 500,000) to $140,000 (RMB one million) in registered (i.e., paid-
in) capital, which means that they would be unlikely to have much in the way of PP&E.  
The business model is not highly capital intensive. 
 
FMCN’s near total write-offs64 of its smaller internet advertising acquisitions, followed 
by giveaways, generally appear unwarranted based on the companies’ 2009 and 2010 
financial performances.  The table below shows the smaller internet companies that 
FMCN wrote-down to zero in 2009.   
 


 
 
The below SAIC financial statements show that the companies generally did not 
perform significantly worse in 2009 than in 2008.  Further, iResearch, which is owned 
by Allyes (and thus FMCN during 2009), shows that China’s online advertising market 
grew 21.9% in 2009,65 further calling into question the rationale for these write-downs.  
Regardless, FMCN obviously could have found purchasers for these businesses, given 
that they still had value.

64 FMCN wrote all of the smaller (i.e. non-Allyes) internet companies down by 100%, except for 
Catchstone.  It impaired Catchstone 80%, but disposed of it for zero consideration. We assume zero 
consideration for all companies because of the absence of any account in the cash flow statement showing 
cash received for disposal of subsidiaries until 2010 when FMCN disposed of Allyes.  2008 shows a cash 
outflow of $11.7 million for disposal of subsidiaries, which is cash FMCN gave away with the disposals.

leading-digital-marketing-solutions-provider-99620644.html  


15
FMCN’s 2009 disposal of Tou Jia (aka “Tuojia”), a small traditional outdoor billboard 
company, for zero consideration also seems unjustified.  FMCN wrote that Tuo Jia 
experienced a severe decline in revenue, and gross and operating profits in Q2 2009.  
FMCN also cited a rise in DSO, and stated that it believed that it would be unable to 
turnaround the business.66  The 2009 numbers below for Tuojia do not look that poor.  
 
Tou Jia is one of the entities that was disposed of by FMCN to another party for no 
consideration.

Allyes is a different type of unjustified write-down in that FMCN sold 38% of it to 
management at an implied value of $35 million (see infra All(Directors)Say Yes).  This 
necessitated significant impairments from the original $296.9 million FMCN paid in 
order to justify management’s bargain purchase.  Management flipped its stake seven 
months later at an implied valuation of $200 million (5.7x).   
 
 
The Thrill of Defeat 
 
We speculate as to why FMCN would want to 
unnecessarily write companies down to zero.  
Writing down companies to zero as a pretext 
for giving them away could serve several 
purposes:   
 


1. If FMCN is burying losses via inflated 
capital expenditures a la Olympus, 
getting rid of the businesses ensures 
that the entities (and the losses) will be 
placed safely outside the view of 
auditors.  We believe that the 
overstated impairment charges we 
discuss in this section are likely also 
used to bury losses. 
 


2. It is possible that FMCN has side 
agreements with the “sellers” to give 
the companies back after a short 
period.  This could enable FMCN to 
borrow revenue and profit at a much lower real cost (i.e., consideration the seller 
actually keeps).  





17
3. FMCN management used an artificially aggressive write-down of Allyes to 
justify its bargain basement purchase of 38% of the company from FMCN.  
Management flipped its positions to a venture capital fund seven months later 
for a 5.7x exit, which is an annualized IRR of 2,127.2%.  Transactions in Allyes 
have put tens of millions of dollars into insiders’ pockets while costing 
shareholders $159.6 million.  We discuss the Allyes opprobrium in detail in 
All(Directors Say)Yes. 


 
Why Doesn’t Everybody do This? 
 
We find it likely that Olympus would have had an easier time hiding its overpayments if 
it could have given the acquisitions away.  We believe that it did not gift its problematic 
acquisitions away (despite them being a smaller percentage of enterprise value) because 
analysts would have noticed.  Olympus is a much larger company than FMCN, and is 
traded on an exchange that has not seen froth since 1989.   
 
In contrast, FMCN seems to have an overly cozy dynamic with many of its sell-side 
analysts.  The inside joke at Muddy Waters when reviewing conference call transcripts 
was: The analysts treat every call like a job interview.67  Indeed, FMCN’s current CFO, 
Kit Leong Low, used to cover FMCN from the sell side.  Also of note is that FMCN has 
not taken a single buy-side question on a call since Q1 2007 when Kingsford Capital 
asked some graduate-level questions.

VIII. All(Directors Say)Yes to Enriching Insiders 
 
Greed, for lack of a better word, is good…but not for shareholders of FMCN.  FMCN 
has always been run for the benefit of insiders.  The most egregious set of actions by 
insiders is the series of trades they executed with FMCN in Allyes.  In Human Piranha-
speak, FMCN shareholders got their “faces ripped off” by insiders.68   
 
Most Abhorrent Series of Transactions – Allyes  
 
FMCN shareholders lost a total of $159.6 million on FMCN’s investment in Allyes 
Information Technology Co. Ltd.69  But shareholders will be comforted knowing that 
insiders likely made at least $70.1 million trading in Allyes on the other side of FMCN.

70  The insiders who profited so nicely are Jason Jiang, board member Neil Shen, CFO 
Kit Long, and Xiong Xiangdong.  Mr. Xiong has no ostensible connection to FMCN, 
but he appears to have a good deal of behind the scenes involvement with FMCN.  
 
Trade I – likely putting at least $7.4 million in the pockets of Shen, Xiong, and possibly 
Jiang. 
 
FMCN bought Allyes on March 28, 2007 for total consideration of $296.9 million, 
including an earn-out recorded as $71.9 million in 2008. FMCN insiders likely received 
at least $7.4 million in profit in this transaction, likely at a return of at least of 150.0%.  
The $7.4 million estimate ignores profits we believe Mr. Jiang made on the trade; 
therefore, the actual profit to insiders is probably higher.   
 
While this trade worked out well for FMCN insiders, FMCN shareholders did poorly.  
By Q4 2009, FMCN had written off Allyes by at least $258.4 million (including any 
amortization of acquired intangibles), which was a loss to shareholders of 87.0% of the 
original purchase price.71

Management ($13.3 million) 
71 Focus Media reports write-downs, making it difficult to attribute them to specific acquisitions.  As a 
result, we calculated the write-downs by subtracting the value of the acquired intangibles and goodwill at 
the time of disposal to Silver Lake ($16.3 million, taken from the 2010 20-F, pp. F-18 to F-19) from the 
value of the acquired intangibles and goodwill attributed to the purchase and contingent consideration 
($274.7 million, taken from the 2008 20-F, p. F-19).  Since there were no write-downs in 2010 for the 
internet segment, this must have been the sum of write-downs at the end of 2009 as well.  The total actual 
write-downs attributable to Allyes may be higher since this estimate ignores any write-downs that 
reduced the book value of items other than goodwill and acquired intangibles

According to FMCN’s filings, Mr. Jiang was an Allyes shareholder72 by January 23, 
2006, and still owned FMCN shares as of September 18, 2006.73  We were unable to 
determine whether any of the ultimate sellers of Allyes were entities that Mr. Jiang 
beneficially owned, so we are unclear as to his profit on this transaction.  However, we 
expect that he made a profit along with his friends, Messrs. Shen and Xiong who seem 
to have realized at least $7.4 million in personal profits. 
 
In order to estimate the amounts of Messrs. Shen and Xiong’s profits, we assumed that 
they purchased their stakes in on March 13, 2005 at a valuation of $120 million, which 
Asian Private Equity Review estimates was the implied value of the transaction.74  
Based on the aforementioned assumptions and the share purchase agreement Allyes 
executed with FMCN, each realized profits in the following manner:

In order to provide them with incentive, a group of insiders bought 38% of Allyes for 
$13.3 million on January 10, 2010.  This transaction valued Allyes at $35.0 million, 
which was less than its cash on hand of $40.0 million and its book value of $60.0 
million.  This purchase price is unjustifiable, as it is theft – plain and simple.  Below is a 
summary financial statement for Allyes as of July 30, 2010 (disposal date to Silver 
Lake)75: 
 


 
 
The following explanation is one of the more ludicrous statements Muddy Waters has 
ever seen in a SEC filing (emphasis added): 
 


Certain employees of the Internet segment, management and directors and 
certain members of the Company’s management and directors entered into a 
definitive agreement with the Company and Allyes in January 2010 to buy-out 
an aggregate 38% interest in Allyes from the Company for $13.3 million.  The 
transaction was approved by all independent directors on the board.  This 
transaction was part of initiatives being taken by the Company to incentivize 
management to enhance the future business model of Allyes and thereby to seek 
long term sustainable growth for the company and investors.  The Group 
performed a valuation of Allyes as of the closing date of the transaction and 
determined that the price paid to acquire the interest approximated fair value.76 


 
We are curious as to how FMCN and the board determined that Allyes was worth less 
than the cash and equivalents, and just over half of book value. 
 
The table below shows the entities and “certain” beneficial owners who participated in 
the partial buy-out.77

CEO Jason Jiang owned the equivalent of 28.2 million ADSs at the time, which had a 
market value of approximately $476 million as of January 10, 2010.  Muddy Waters 
does not comprehend why he needed further incentive to do his job.78  Some old-
fashioned investors might believe that Mr. Jiang should atone for blowing nearly $300 
million of shareholder money on Allyes in the first place, and should have “enhanced 
the future business model of Allyes” merely for the compensation he receives under his 
existing employment agreement.  Yes, it would be bitter medicine to swallow, but doing 
so would surely be one of the better character building experiences of his life. 
 
Kit Low had only recently become FMCN’s new CFO when he bought into Allyes.79  
We therefore assume that the salary and bonus package he and FMCN had negotiated 
did not include incentives for him to enhance Allyes’s future business model either.  We 
only wish that FMCN would have compensated him in a more transparent way, rather 
than (by accident, we are sure) requiring investors to read the signature section of the 
share purchase agreement, which is Exhibit 10.185 to the 2009 20-F. 
 
Venture capitalist Xiong Xiangdong resurfaces.  We have no idea how his bargain 
purchase of Allyes shares benefitted FMCN investors.  It should be noted that the 
signatory for each of the above entities is his wife.  His wife is a co-director (along with 
Mr. Jiang) of FMCN’s Singapore subsidiary.  However, we believe that the bargain 
purchase is not compensation or incentive for her services, as the Singapore entity (per 
its audited financial statements) produces zero revenue.  Further, she signed for herself 
and sold shares in China Kanghui Holdings (KH).  She has no known affiliation with 
KH, but her husband’s employer, IDG Capital Partners, was the lead investor in KH.

78 One of our team is reminded of a story about a dinner meeting of senior law firm partners from Asian 
offices and their direct superior, who was visiting from the US, that took place at the end of 2008.  The 
Asia partners repeatedly mentioned they were worried about their abilities to generate business because of 
the financial crisis.  After hearing this long enough, the US partner exploded in an expletive-filled tirade, 
pointing at each one in turn while yelling near top volume “YOU do YOUR job!  And YOU do YOUR 
job!  YOU do YOUR job!!!”  He then threw his napkin on the table and left.  We think FMCN 
management would benefit from similar oversight.

James Jian Zhang is a very curious participant.  He was previously the chairman of 
Duoyuan Printing Inc.’s audit committee.  (OTC: DYNP.PK)  DYNP was de-listed 
amid suspicions of fraud.  Muddy Waters exposed its sister company, Duoyuan Global 
Water, Inc. as a fraud on April 4, 2011.80  Mr. Jian Zhang is currently the CFO of 
LaShou Group, Inc, an upcoming IPO.  The only benefit to FMCN shareholders of 
including Mr. Jian Zhang in this group seems to be to highlight his involvement in 
another soon-to-be public company.  We look forward to LaShou’s debut on the United 
States market. 
 
Trade III – FMCN Insiders Flip to a VC Fund for a $53.2 Million Implied Profit.  
FMCN Shareholders Realize a $162.5 Million Loss.  
 
On August 3rd, 2010, Silver Lake Partners acquired 90.8%81 of Allyes for a total of 
$181.0 million.  The insiders who sold to Silver Lake received 5.7x on their investments 
in only seven months, which is an annualized IRR of 2,127.2%.  The SEC took note of 
this outsize return as well, and sent FMCN letters on September 22, 2010 querying the 
rationale for the bargain sales 82 and on November 15, 2011 questioning how Allyes’s 
value increased so much after the insiders took their stakes.83  
  
The insiders sold two-thirds of their holdings to Silver Lake, and kept the one-third.  
The breakdown and profits by insider (assuming each sold to Silver Lake) are below: 





 
 
One of the questions remaining is: Who held onto their stakes?  Assuming that the 
insiders did not sell partial stakes, then there are a maximum of three possible 
combinations of remaining shareholders.  (Depending on rounding, Combination C may 
not be a possibility.)

83 http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330017/000000000011005758/filename1.pdf, p. 4 


25
From the above analysis, we think it is likely that the insider group had an eye toward 
an exit when they took their stake.  In all scenarios, Xiong Xiangdong must have one of 
his entities continue to hold Allyes shares if Silver Lake does in fact own 90.8%.  The 
likely explanation as to why Mr. Xiong split his stake between two entities is that he 
intended to flip one for a profitable exit, and use the profit to essentially give himself a 
free option on Allyes going public.   
 
This brings up other questions, including:  
 


• When did FMCN first begin discussing selling Allyes to SilverLake and any 
other potential buyers?   


• Which entities still hold their shares in Allyes?   
• Who are the parties associated with Bronco Ventures and Unidex Holdings?   


 
If it turns out that insiders allowed itself the opportunity for further upside, this heist 
would be even more brazen. 
 
IX. How to Fail in Business Without Really Trying: Phantom Acquisitions and 
Write-Downs 
 
FMCN fraudulently claimed to have acquired six mobile handset advertising companies 
that it in fact never acquired.  In FMCN’s 2009 20-F, it claimed to have written down 
nine companies in its mobile handset division on April 30, 2008 and February 28, 2009 
for a loss on disposal of $50.9 million.84  There is a small problem with this disclosure 
though.  FMCN had never owned six of those companies. 
 
These six phantom acquisitions constituted a $41.8 million loss in FMCN’s filings.  
FMCN claimed to take the write-downs and dispose of the businesses because of 
adverse publicity these companies received for illegal spam marketing on March 15, 
2008.  However, we see from the SAIC files that even if FMCN had owned the 
companies, their full year performance in 2008 was substantially better than in 2007.

84 4th Amendment to the 2009 20-F, p. 78. 


26
Therefore (again, even in FMCN had really owned these companies), poor performance 
was a false pretext for disposing of them at a 115% loss. 
 


• Were shareholder funds transferred out for these purported acquisitions, and if 
so, to whom? 


• Aside from the possibility of diverting shareholder funds, what is the purpose of 
claiming acquisitions and disposal losses that never occurred? 


 
SAIC Files and Other Research Show FMCN Never Owned the Six Companies 
 
The timeline below shows the actual shareholder of each company at the time FMCN 
claims to have acquired it, along with the dates on which such shareholders acquired 
and disposed of their holdings. 
 


 
 
FMCN claimed that it, or one or more of its subsidiaries, acquired and disposed of these 
phantom mobile entities.85  Obviously, that was not the case.  Nor were any other 
FMCN entities shareholders of these entities. 
 
We preclude the possibility that FMCN acquired these six companies as VIEs for the 
following reasons: 
 
There were no changes of the shareholders, company directors, or legal representatives 
of these companies at the time FMCN claims to have acquired them.  Nor are there any 
records of pledges of the equity.  If acquiring a VIE, the acquirer would typically 
change all of the aforementioned positions, and would record a pledge of the VIE’s 
equity (if one were not already in existence).  Without changing at least some of the 
positions, an acquirer would have little effective control of the VIE.   
 
When FMCN has acquired VIEs, it has typically followed these standard practices and 
replaced all of the positions mentioned above.  It has also typically perfected equity

pledges.  One example of FMCN acquiring a VIE in this manner is its acquisition of 
Beijing Yitong Wireless Information Technology Co., Ltd (“Yitong”).  Yitong is one of 
the two to four companies86 in the mobile handset division that FMCN did actually 
acquire.  When FMCN acquired Yitong, it made the below changes: 
 


 
 
We spoke with multiple companies in this group, and each confirmed that FMCN never 
owned or controlled them.  There were indications that FMCN may have been a client 
of these companies.   


 
Disclosures in the 2008 and 2009 20-Fs87 about the acquisition and disposal date of the 
largest of the phantom acquisitions, Shenzhen Jingzhun, are materially different from 
one another and are mutually exclusive.  FMCN slyly attempted to rewrite history in 
order to disguise inconsistencies in its story about the purported loss on disposal of 
(never acquired) Jingzhun. 
 
Both disclosures were made in the Legal Proceedings section and referred to an 
arbitration claim that the would-be selling shareholder of Jingzhun brought against 
FMCN for $15.6 million purportedly for unpaid acquisition consideration.  (As shown 
in the table supra, Mr. Ying Ping’s ownership remained constant at the time FMCN 
claimed to acquire Jingzhun) 
 
Ying Ping, the primary registered capital holder of the largest of phantom mobile 
acquisition companies, initiated an arbitration proceeding against FMCN on February 
11, 2009.  According to FMCN’s disclosure in the 2008 20-F, Mr. Ying was seeking 
$15.6 million in unpaid consideration for his registered capital in February 2009.  This 
amount is roughly equal to the loss on disposal FMCN recorded on April 30, 2008.  
However, if FMCN had not actually paid Ying Ping for his firm (which is what he 
claimed and what the judgment appears to prove true), then FMCN would have had 
nothing to impair. 
 
FMCN claims that the acquisition was returned to Ying Ping for zero consideration, so 
the loss on disposal would have been a write-down to zero.  It is clear that Ying Ping is 
claiming that he was never paid the acquisition consideration.  FMCN ultimately settled 
the arbitration by paying $5.5 million in March 2010, which validates Mr. Ying’s claim

obtain complete SAIC files on the other two companies

28
that FMCN owed him money.88  Muddy Waters thinks that the contract in question 
could have been a service contract, rather than a purchase agreement. 
 
There is a very subtle but critical difference between the descriptions of this arbitration 
proceeding in the 2008 and 2009 20-Fs.  The wording of each is shown below with 
differences underlined. 
 
2008 20-F: 
 


On February 11, 2009, Ying Ping, a PRC citizen, filed an arbitration application 
in Beijing with China International Economic and Trade Arbitration 
Commission (“CIETAC”) against the Group, requesting the Group, (i) to 
continue to perform a Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 20, 2007, 
between Ying Ping and us; (ii) to pay a share purchase price in the amount of 
RMB106.56 million and accrued interests thereof; and (iii) to bear their legal 
counsel fee in the amount of RMB 2.3 million and other relevant arbitration 
costs. The CIETAC accepted Ying Ping’s application for arbitration on 
February 24, 2009 and no arbitration session has been held yet. The Group 
believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims alleged and intends to defend 
against such claims vigorously. The Group had accrued approximately $7.5 
million as contingent consideration as of December 31, 2008 which reflects its 
best estimate of the ultimate settlement amount.89 


 
2009 20-F: 


 
On February 11, 2008, Ying Ping, a PRC citizen, filed an arbitration application 
in Beijing with China International Economic and Trade Arbitration 
Commission (“CIETAC”) against us, requesting us, (i) to continue to perform a 
Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 20, 2008, between Ying Ping and 
the Company; (ii) to pay an overdue share purchase price in the amount of 
$15.6 million and accrued interests thereof; and (iii) to bear their legal counsel 
fee in the amount of $0.3 million and other relevant arbitration costs. The 
CIETAC accepted Ying Ping’s application for arbitration on February 24, 2009. 
On March 10, 2010, the arbitration was settled. As a result, we agreed to pay 
$5.5 million to settle all the claims under the arbitration.90 


 
The above shows that either FMCN’s counsel made a curious error in the 2009 20-F, or 
FMCN employed a memory hole trick to try to change history.  The 2008 20-F date is 
obviously the correct one – otherwise the disclosure would have been made in the 2007 
20-F or at some other point in time prior to the 2008 20-F, and would have required a 
functioning time machine (the second excerpt refers to an arbitration application filed 
on February 11, 2008 concerning a Share Purchase Agreement dated March 20, 2008).

89 2008 20-F, p. 98 
90 2009 20-F, p. 97 


29
The advantage to be gained by changing the date in the 2009 20-F would have been to 
hide the fact that FMCN had not paid any consideration for Yitong at the time it wrote 
the acquisition off in 2008.   
 
FMCN’s 2007 filings further show that FMCN never acquired these companies.  FMCN 
does not list any of these six companies in subsidiary list of its 2007 20-F; however, it 
does list two mobile companies91 we confirmed FMCN did acquire as subsidiaries.  
Further, the absence of any commentary about the acquisitions as being a reason for the 
increase in mobile advertising revenue in 2007 in any of the quarterly 6-K filings or the 
2007 20-F is conspicuous.  According to these seven companies’ SAIC files, they 
generated combined 2007 revenue of $18.0 million, which was 38.4% of FMCN’s 2007 
mobile advertising revenue.   
 
A CCTV program focused on consumer rights pertaining to text message spam 
contained an interview with the Special Assistant to the General Manager of Shenzhen 
Julan, Ms. Wang.  She stated that FMCN had no relationship, much less own, the 
company.  A follow-up article covering the report contained the following excerpt: 
 


“The reporter came to Shenzhen Julan Information Technology Co., Ltd.  The 
special assistant to the General Manager received us.  The reporter asked, “Do 
you have any relationship with Focus Wireless?”  The special assistant to the 
General Manager replied “No relationship.”92 


 
Even if FMCN had acquired these six companies in 2007, it would have had no basis to 
dispose of them for zero consideration.  Per the SAIC financial statements (summarized 
below), the phantom acquisitions generally did well in 2008 compared to 2007.  It 
seems that only a company looking for write-downs would have written these 
businesses down to zero. 
 


 
 
On the other hand, facts surrounding the one mobile company that FMCN did acquire 
and keep, Dotad Media Holdings Limited (“Dotad”), suggest self dealing or other 
impropriety on the part of FMCN management.  Dotad is a SMS advertising company 
that FMCN acquired in March 2006. Dotad’s CEO under FMCN, Xu Maodong, took

over a startup competitor, BFTL,93 right after leaving his position at FMCN as Dotad 
CEO. 94  FMCN not only failed to enforce a non-compete agreement, but an FMCN 
employee95 was one of two transferors of ownership of BFTL to Mr. Xu.  Further, 
FMCN transferred one of its subsidiaries, Yitong, to BFTL.  BFTL (with Mr. Xu still 
running it) went on to raise $100 million from Telstra and Softbank in 2010,96 and 
appears to be thriving. 
 
X. Shipwrecked: $36.9 million Loss on Boat Advertising in 14 Months 
 
In January 2009, just 14 months after it acquired the business, FMCN took a $36.9 
million aggregate impairment related to a boat advertising business.  FMCN’s cost of 
$24.2 million for the company was 7.4x its established market value.  We estimate that 
FMCN significantly overpaid for the PP&E – namely a boat christened the Captain 
Six97 and related renovations – in the business as well.  The size and fact of FMCN’s 
overpayment for the company at the time was so obvious – particularly because the 
sellers had recently agreed to sell the company at a fraction of FMCN’s cost – that we 
are incredulous of management’s explanations of the transaction. 
 


 
 
FMCN overpaid by at least 7.4x for a company that it wrote down to zero 14 months 
later.  In October 2007, FMCN acquired a company, Zong Heng Pin Yu (“ZHPY”), 
which had a license to operate a LED advertising boat on the Huangpu River in 
Shanghai.  FMCN appears to have paid at least $27.4 million98 for this company.

documents show that only three months earlier, the prior shareholders of ZHPY had 
executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell 90% of ZHPY for $3.3 million.  (The 
would-be purchaser failed to pay the deposit on time, but subsequently sued for specific 
performance of the purchase and sale agreement.)  The implied valuation of ZHPY was 
therefore $3.7 million.  FMCN paid at least 7.4x as much as the implied value of the 
previously negotiated transaction.  
 
FMCN bought the boat, the Captain Six, separately for at least $12.4 million99, which 
we estimate is 3.2x ($8.5 million) more than it should have cost.  Below is a picture of 
the Captain Six: 
 


 
 
We estimate that the total cost of the boat and its renovations should have been no more 
than $3.9 million, versus the minimum of $12.4 million that FMCN paid for the boat 
and equipment.  FMCN’s boat appears to be a standard 40-meter steel-hulled, diesel 
propelled freighter commonly utilized for intra-harbor transfers and coastal shipping.  
Boats of this type are easy to acquire, have limited competitive advantage, and trade 
frequently in the secondary market.  Based on quotes provided by Meridian Marine 
Brokerage, we estimate the acquisition of the boat itself to cost at most $1.0 million.  


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
were purchased separate from ZHPY), and $3.2 million in intangible assets (ZHPY’s license and patent).  
We therefore assume that the balance of $24.2 million is for ZHPY, including goodwill.  The combination 
of the intangible assets and goodwill yields a $27.4 million purchase price for ZHPY.  Note that FMCN 
has not specifically stated that it wrote down the values to zero. If FMCN maintains a residual value, then 
the payment and overpayment amounts would be correspondingly higher.

Multiple manufacturers produce large-scale, outdoor grade LED advertising screens that 
could be easily adapted for use in a maritime environment.  Specifically, Mitsubishi 
Electric Diamond Vision quoted the cost of a dual-sided 21x7 meter100 LED screen 
suitable for maritime use, portable power supply, and ancillary equipment at $1.9 
million.  Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision is a world leader in producing large-size 
LED digital outdoor billboards and has provided record-setting jumbo screens at the 
Jockey Club in Hong Kong, Cowboys Stadium in Dallas, Texas, and the Kiryu Boat 
Race Course in Kiryu, Japan.  Allowing for conversion capital expenditures of $1.0 
million yields a total boat cost of approximately $3.9 million. 
 





From a shareholder value perspective, there would have been more residual value 
available if FMCN had purchased a luxury yacht instead of starting a boat advertising 
business.  FMCN could have acquired the 60-meter “Meduse” (built by Feadship of the 
Netherlands, previously owned by Paul Allen, and recently renovated) for $36.4 
million.  Meduse features accommodations for 12 guests in seven cabins, a helicopter 
deck, cinema, recording studio, gymnasium, and elevator.  Additional information on 
the Meduse luxury yacht is available at:

XI. FMCN Acquires a Direct Competitor and Loses $198.4 Million101 in 11 Months 
When Bizarre Business Plan Fails 
 
Summary 
 
On the surface, FMCN’s acquisition of CGEN is a shocking display of corporate 
ineptitude that destroyed $198.4 million in shareholder value in 11 months.  Based on 
our observations that FMCN deliberately overpays for acquisitions and then seeks to 
impair them, we have a difficult time believing that FMCN made a good faith effort to 
ensure the acquisition’s success.  This transaction is yet another example of why Muddy 
Waters believes that FMCN management is toxic to shareholders. 
 





 
On December 10, 2007, FMCN entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CGEN 
Digital Media Company Limited (“CGEN”), a direct competitor and ostensibly a 
leading operator of an in-store digital advertising network in China.  The transaction 
was purportedly designed to increase FMCN’s market penetration in the digital 
advertising space for LCD displays in large chain stores in China.  There were 
supposedly synergies with FMCN’s existing in-store platform. 
 
Under the terms of the December 10, 2007 acquisition agreement, FMCN acquired 
100% of the equity of CGEN for $168.4 million in cash, and an additional payment of 
up to $181.6 million, part in cash and part in FMCN ordinary shares (valued at 
US$53.42 per ADS, each of which represents five FMCN ordinary shares), contingent 
upon CGEN meeting certain earnings targets during the twenty four month period 
following the closing of the transaction, for a total potential payment consideration of 
$350.0 million.  


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
101 $198.4 million calculated as the sum of the cash consideration paid to selling shareholders ($168.4 
million) along with the additional cash used to repay a $30.0 million loan owed by CGEN prior to the 
acquisition.  Figures taken from the Share Purchase Agreement between Focus Media and CGEN (exhibit 
10.162 to the 2007 20-F, pp. 12-13 & 46) 


34
All FMCN shares to be issued in under the earn-out payments would be new issuances.  
According to FMCN Management at the time of the transaction announcement, the 
acquisition agreement valued CGEN at 17.5x FY08E net income and was expected to 
be accretive to FMCN’s EPS in FY08.  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, 
FMCN was on the hook for a shockingly large $80.0m liquidated damages cash 
payment to the CGEN sellers for compensation of the firm’s “initial public offering 
option value” if FMCN failed to close the transaction.102  These egregious contract 
terms would come back to haunt FMCN shareholders shortly. 
 


 
 
Ironically, back on March 16, 2006, CGEN had commenced a $1.7 million litigation 
case against FMCN and the Hymart chain of supermarkets in Shanghai because of 
FMCN’s interference with CGEN’s exclusive business contract with Hymart.  In order 
to gain business with Hymart, FMCN agreed to compensate Hymart for the legal costs 
with defending itself against the CGEN litigation.  The lawsuit was eventually 
dismissed for technical reasons, just a few months before the acquisition announcement.  
It is difficult to understand how a litigious competitor could become a worthy 
acquisition target at a premium valuation in such a short period. 
 
FMCN’s Short CGEN Operating History 
 
On January 2, 2008, FMCN completed the acquisition of CGEN; FMCN made its 
required cash payment of $168.4 million to the former CGEN shareholders and the 
former CGEN shareholders delivered 100% of the equity interest in CGEN.  As per the 
terms of the final acquisition agreement, FMCN was required to inject an additional 
$30.0 million working capital loan at an 0.0% interest rate to finance CGEN's ongoing 
business operations within seven days of the transaction closing.  However, according 
to CGEN’s SAIC filings, FMCN had pre-funded this below-market working capital 
loan before the end of fiscal year 2007.  This early funding of the working capital 
facility is yet another red-flag as it implies CGEN had serious liquidity issues that 
FMCN knew about prior to closing the acquisition.

35
The professed strategic rationale for the acquisition of CGEN was to consolidate the in-
store advertising market with the aspiration of reducing rental fees paid to chain-store 
owners. However, this acquisition did not result in chain-stores lowering their rental 
fees as expected. Instead, the chain-stores demanded FMCN maintain the multi-year 
rental fee agreements entered into by CGEN prior to the acquisition and mandated 
FMCN pay for CGEN's overdue rental fees, which amounted to $15.9 million or an 
additional cash outflow of approximately 10% of the total consideration paid for CGEN.  
 
11-Month Implosion and $0.00 Divestiture 
 
On November 10, 2008, just 10 short months after the close of the acquisition, FMCN 
announced it was considering restructuring options in the fourth quarter for the CGEN 
business due to its failure to reduce the location cost of its in-store advertising.  
 
On December 8, 2008, FMCN disposed of CGEN, which resulted in a $190.5 million 
disposal loss, which includes the write-off of the carrying value of intangible assets and 
goodwill of $39.5 million and $145.6 million, respectively.  FMCN sold for zero 
consideration CGEN's PRC operating affiliate, CGEN Media Advertising Co., Ltd. 
(“CGEN Media”), including all accounts receivables and account payables, to a third 
party, who FMCN claimed was neither related to the company nor an original CGEN 
owners.  Despite the disposition of CGEN Media, FMCN accounted for the CGEN 
results as part of results from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 
2008 via an aggressive accounting treatment. 
 
As further evidence that the CGEN acquisition price was egregious for FMCN 
shareholders, the original selling shareholders of CGEN agreed to terminate their 
additional payment earn-outs for zero consideration on December 8, 2008, which was 
the same day FMCN announced the write-down.  Interestingly, CGEN selling 
shareholders agreed to this termination prior to the end of the fiscal year, which implies 
the business results must have been so abysmal that there was no hope for meeting the 
earnings hurdles for full year 2008 or any year going forward.  This again calls into 
question the motivation of FMCN management for pursuing the CGEN acquisition.   
 
Summary 
 
The CGEN transaction provides insight to FMCN’s standard operating procedures.  
First, massively overpay for the business.  Next, crash the business.  Finally, divest the 
business for no consideration. 
 
XII. Turning a Rare Winner Into a Loser – Possibly to Facilitate More Self-
Dealing 
 
FMCN owned 33% of a joint venture internet advertising agency in China with Dentsu 
Incorporated (“Dentsu”), &c, Incorporated (pronounced “et cetera”).  &c, Inc. (“&c”) 
turned into a great performer for FMCN…that is until FMCN sold its stake back to 


36
Dentsu in February 2010 for a loss, and $56.9 million below our estimate of its value.  
We do not know why FMCN sold it at such a below market price, but there are signs 
that the bargain sale may have to do with enabling FMCN management to engage in a 
self-dealing transaction. 
 
In May 2008, FMCN and Dentsu formed &c.  FMCN contributed $3.0 million in equity 
through FMCN’s Hong Kong subsidiary, Hua Kuang Advertising Company Limited in 
exchange for a 33% stake.  Dentsu contributed $6.0 million for the remaining 
ownership.  The young company’s top and bottom lines grew rapidly (as shown below). 
 


 
 
On February 22, 2010, FMCN signed the share purchase agreement to sell its stake back 
to Dentsu for $2.2 million.103,104  The equity assignment agreement alludes to the reason 
for the transfer being that Hua Guang has a subsidiary that it may list on the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange, and that exchange rules would prohibit Hua Guang from 
simultaneously having a stake in &c.105  We believe that the agreement is referring to 
Hua Guang subsidiary Shanghai Hua Guang Chuanzi OOH Ltd. (“OOH”), which 
appears to be on track for a Shanghai IPO. 106   (See OOH, Insider… for more 
information on OOH.) 
 
By the end of 2009, cash and accounts receivable were worth $36.0 million.  At the time 
they sold out, the book value of the joint venture was $25.0 million and revenue and net

income for the year were $114.8 million and $8.87 million, respectively, making the 
transaction multiples 0.27x book value, 0.06x revenue, and 0.75x earnings—
inappropriate no matter how you look at it.  Given the tremendous growth, the business 
was conservatively worth $177.4 million, or 20.0x earnings, making FMCN’s stake 
worth $59.1 million, or 26.6x what they received for it. 
 
If Hua Guang’s possible IPO is the reason for the bargain sale, it is yet more collateral 
damage from management’s self-dealing.  As we discussed infra, Hua Guang is 
management’s latest trade on the other side of FMCN shareholders.  In 2010, FMCN 
management purchased a 19% stake in Hua Guang for $13.3 million.  A large 
investment bank loaned management at least part of the funds for the purchase.  At the 
same time, the bank purchased 30% of Hua Guang.  If enabling Hua Guang to IPO is 
the reason FMCN management agreed to such a low price, management figured out a 
way to throw shareholders under the bus twice on the same transaction. 
 
Article 7.1(4) of the equity assignment contract is a bit unnerving, as it reads (Party B is 
the FMCN subsidiary that transferred the equity to Dentsu): 
 


Notwithstanding the three prior clauses [in Article 7.1], statements (including 
without limitation those Mr. Jiang Nanchun from Focus Media Holdings Ltd. 
made to the principal of Party A on November 27, 2009) as to why Party B is 
assigning the equity to Party A, whether oral or written, shall be guaranteed by 
Party B and Party B’s representative. 


 
It is unusual that the contract cites, without describing, statements by Mr. Jiang 
regarding the rationale for the transfer.  Further, the contract seems to provide a 
guarantee that such statements are, or will be, true.  It seems that there are some 
material terms that the parties did not want to include in the contract, which is 
concerning. 
 
Regardless of the reason for FMCN’s transfer of the equity to Dentsu for $2.2 million, 
FMCN shareholders once again got the short end of the stick. 
 
XIII. OOH, Insider Self-Dealing Continues in 2011 With Even More Conflicts of 
Interest than Usual 
 
This spring, insiders once again needed an incentive to do their job.  Management 
decided to take a 19% stake in a traditional outdoor billboard subsidiary, Shanghai Hua 
Guang Chuanzhi OOH Co. Ltd.  (“OOH”).  OOH is expected to launch a public 
offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2012.107  It may seem that insiders are less 
greedy than before, but unfortunately that is not the case.  At the same time that insiders 
invested, a large investment bank (the “Investment Bank”) subscribed to an additional 
30% of the OOH.  Further, the Investment Bank loaned insiders a significant portion

(possibly all) of the consideration for the insider portion.  Our problems with this 
transaction are: 
 


• Insiders have significant stock holdings in FMCN (see Appendix).  Their job is 
to create value for FMCN – not to invest in crown jewel assets shortly prior to 
an exit.  It is completely unjustifiable and abusive for insiders to (yet again) 
trade in FMCN assets.  Just ask Mr. Andrew Fastow. 


• Insiders have a significant conflict of interest evaluating the investment bank’s 
bid when the bank is also lending them money for the purchase.  This too is 
unnecessary and abusive. 


• The disclosures about the transaction are quite vague – it is clear that insiders do 
not want to divulge much information on this transaction.   


 
OOH, the Investment Bank, and Other Shenanigans 
 
On March 7, 2011, FMCN entered into an equity transfer agreement to spin-out 49% of 
OOH to an entity controlled by the Investment Bank, and entities controlled by certain 
employees, directors and management members of FMCN (the “Management 
Entities”).  The Investment Bank agreed to acquire a 30% equity interest in OOH for 
$21.0 million, and the Management Entities received a 19% equity interest for $13.3 
million (OOH’s implied valuation in this transaction is $70.0 million).  
 
Shockingly, the Management Entities could not be bothered to utilize their own cash for 
the transaction and financed the “purchase” with a line of credit from the Investment 
Bank.  If the Investment Bank had enough conviction in the credit-worthiness of OOH 
to provide acquisition financing, Muddy Waters is curious why is it necessary for 
FMCN to set-up a second entity to unlock the shareholder value purportedly hidden in 
this “non-core business”.   
 
Despite announcing this agreement in March 2011108 and then amending it on May 30, 
2011,109 FMCN has yet to publicly disclose the complete transaction terms or provide 
additional detail on who exactly benefits from the additional incentive compensation 
required for the Management Entities.

109 FMCN 20-F dated 12/31/10, page 101 


39
The Investment Bank has several highly conflicted roles in its dealings with FMCN.  
First, The Investment Bank is buying an equity stake in OOH and gaining direct 
representation on the OOH Board of Directors, despite only having a minority economic 
interest.  Second, The Investment Bank is providing significant financing to FMCN 
management to subsidize the cost of their supposed investment.  Finally, the Investment 
Bank has provided significant private banking services to Mr. Jason Jiang, including 
serving as an underwriter on his secondary sales of shares and serving as a counter-party 
on his hedging transactions.  Moreover, because of what Muddy Waters believes to be 
the intentional scarcity and opacity of FMCN's disclosures, it is impossible to 
independently verify the scope of this significant conflict of interest. 
 
Dissembling 
 
According to FMCN, this transaction will allow the company to recoup a majority of its 
investment in this business, while maintaining potential upside to the space. 110  
According to media reports, FMCN management also claims that this transaction is 
necessary to prepare OOH for a complete spin-off and initial public offering.111   
 
However, Muddy Waters can see no logical explanation for the three roles (including 
subsidizing management’s acquisition) one bank is playing.  Because FMCN 
Management is already adequately incentivized with their generous pay / options / 
equity schemes, there is no need to further incentivize them with direct exposure to 
OOH prior to the shareholders realizing any upside on the business.  In summary, the 
OOH transaction is another example of FMCN management putting their own interests 
well ahead of those of FMCN shareholders. 
 
XIV. FMCN’s Corporate Governance Failings 
 
As should be clear from this report, FMCN’s board is incapable of providing real 
corporate governance.  One reason for the board’s inability to do its job is its 
compensation.  The other reason for this dysfunction is the web of business

relationships between insiders.  Muddy Waters can already hear the refrain “But that’s 
how business is done in China…”  We remind investors that China is the second largest 
economy in the world and the most populous nation.  FMCN really cannot find 
qualified directors with at least two degrees of separation? 
 
The follow illustrates some of the relationships between insiders: 
 





41
Jason Jiang and Friends – All Aboard the FMCN Money Train  
 
Under the terms of basic corporate governance, the Board of Directors at a minimum 
owes public shareholders a duty of care and duty of loyalty.  Board of Directors 
compensation is supposed to align their economic interests with those of shareholders 
and as a result their independence from Management is essential.  Unfortunately, the 
compensation scheme for FMCN’s Board of Directors is outsized and does not 
correspond to the interests of public shareholders. FMCN takes full advantage of the 
exemption provided to Foreign Private Issuers by the SEC and does not provide a 
detailed break out of individual director compensation.  However, based on 144 filings, 
it is possible to gain some insight to the amount of shareholder dilution due to Board of 
Directors compensation. 
 
The Curious Case of Professor Qi 
 
Mr. Daqing Qi is a professor at Cheong Kong Graduate School of Business and also 
serves on the board of multiple publicly listed companies, including Bona Films 
(NASDAQ:  BONA) and Daqo New Energy (NYSE: DQ).  On March 25, 2011, Mr. Qi 
filed an SEC Form 144 for the sales of shares resulting from options granted barely 
three months earlier, on December 20, 2010.  These options had a strike price of ZERO 
and Mr. Qi’s total proceeds from the sale were approximately $1.4 million.  This level 
of compensation far exceeds of standard annual independent director compensation.  
The independent directors at Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), the world’s largest and most 
profitable company in absolute dollar terms, were each compensated $272k in 2010.  
Considering the size and complexity of XOM relative to FMCN, it is almost laughable 
that an “independent” director is diluting public shareholders to this extent. 
 
Unfortunately, the egregious level of Board of Directors compensation pales in 
comparison to equity grants to management.  In 2008, 2009, and 2010, employee stock 
compensation was $42 million, $66 million, and $45 million, respectively.  This level of 
equity compensation, for an apparently small number of employees, is shocking relative 
to the size of the company and the share price performance over the period.  Until some 
real adults are in the room, it is difficult to believe these round-robin compensation 
practices will cease.

General 
 
Dentsu Inc., Japan (hereinafter referred to as “Party A”), and Hua Kuang Advertising 
Company,. Ltd, Hong Kong, China (hereinafter referred to as “Party B”) established a 
joint venture, “&c. Digital (Beijing) Advertising Co., Ltd”, on May 22, 2008.

PEOPLE’S COURT OF SHANGHAI NO.1 INTERMEDIATE PEOPLE’S COURT 
CIVIL JUDGMENT 


 
(2008) Hu Yi Zhong Min San (Shang) Zhong Zi No. 517 


 
Appellant:     Shanghai Zongheng Pinyu Advertisement Co., Ltd 
(Defendant in the first instance) 
Appellee:     Shanghai Xiangxieli Advertisement Co., Ltd,  
(Plaintiff in the first instance) 
 
As for a case regarding operation right transfer contract dispute, the Appellant, Shanghai 
Zongheng Pinyu Advertisement Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “Zongheng”), was 
dissatisfied with the civil judgment (2008) Xu Min Er (Shang) Chu Zi No.1587 rendered by 
Shanghai Xuhui District People’s Court and filed an appeal with this court. After this  court 
accepted this case on November 4, 2008, a collegiate court has been lawfully established. An 
open hearing was conducted on November 19, 2008. Mao Jie, the attorney entrusted by the 
Appellant Zongheng, and Shi Quanhong, the attorney entrusted by the Appellee Shanghai 
Xiangxieli Advertisement Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “Xiangxieli”) attended the 
litigation. The case now has been decided.  
 
The court of first instance found that there is an Authorization Agreement on Exclusive 
Operation of Advertisement on Led Advertisement Vessels and Share Buyout Agreement 
concluded between Zongheng and Xiangxieli on July 22, 2007, with main content as follows: 
Zongheng grants Xiangxieli with the exclusive right to operate the advertisement business in the 
Shanghai Huangpu River Project (on-water Led advertisement vessels) and an agreement on the 
share buyout matters in the next year; within three working days after conclusion and 
effectiveness of the agreement, Xiangxieli should pay a deposit in the amount of RMB 1 million 
to Zongheng; August 11, 2007 should be the formal starting date for rental, and within three 
working days prior to the official starting date for rental, Xiangxieli should pay to Zongheng the 
advertisement operation transfer fee for the first quarter in the amount of RMB 1.5 million, the 
advertisement operation transfer fee for each quarter afterwards should be paid within first three 
working days of each quarter respectively; Zongheng should issue the formal advertisement 
operation invoice before payment by Xiangxieli; the authorization period for advertisement 
operation right should be July 23, 2007 until August 11, 2008; if there is any overdue payment 
by Xiangxieli, 3‰ of arrears should be charged for each overdue date as the late fee apart from 
the due payment; if Xiangxieli delays payment for 25 days, Zongheng shall be entitled to 
terminate the contract and the deposit in the amount of RMB 1 million shall not be refunded. 
After completion of the authorization period, Xiangxieli undertakes to buy out 90% of the shares 
of Zongheng at the price of RMB 25 million, a separate agreement will be concluded by both 
parties for detailed buyout matters; the deposit in the amount of RMB 1 million will be used as 
the deposit for the contract regarding share buyout after completion of the authorization period. 
After conclusion of the above agreement, Xiangxieli paid RMB 1 million for the deposit on 
August 1, 2007, RMB 500,000 for the advertisement operation transfer fee on September 7 of the 
same year, RMB 500,000 for the advertisement operation transfer fee on September 19 of the 


74
same year; RMB 300,000 for the advertisement operation transfer fee on October 23 of the same 
year. On November 2, 2007, the shareholder of Zongheng concluded a Share Transfer 
Agreement with an outsider of this case. On November 26, 2007, Zongheng filed a lawsuit, 
requesting to terminate the contract at issue, demanding payment for advertisement operation 
transfer fee and late fee. Xiangxieli filed a counterclaim, requesting continuous performance of 
the contract and demanding payment of liquidated damage for breach. After the trial, Shanghai 
Xuhui District People’s Court was of the opinion that the Authorization Agreement on Exclusive 
Operation of Advertisement on Led Advertisement Vessels and Share Buyout Agreement 
concluded between both parties was legal and valid. During the contract performance procedure, 
Xiangxieli had delayed the payment for deposit and advertisement operation transfer fee, which 
constituted a fundamental breach of the contract. Zongheng’s non-delivery of invoices merely 
constituted an ordinary breach. Based on that, the civil judgment (2007) Xu Min Er (Shang) Chu 
Zi No.2254 was issued on February 22, 2008, which supported Zongheng’s litigation requests 
but dismissed Xiangxieli’s counterclaim requests. Dissatisfied with the judgment, Xiangxieli 
filed an appeal. After a trial, Shanghai Municipal No.1 Intermediate People’s Court was of the 
opinion that although it had been agreed in the contract at issue that Xiangxieli should make the 
payment upon receipt of the invoice from Zongheng, Xiangxieli had not filed any objection 
against Zongheng for not receiving the invoice or execute the defense of first performance during 
the agreed payment period, while instead, Xiangxieli had successively made most of the payment 
and even paid the second installment of advertisement fee to Zongheng during the litigation 
period. Therefore, the above behavior of Xiangxieli could be deemed already as a waiver of the 
defense of first performance. Due to the contract term agreed under the contract at issue was 
ended in July 2008, and Zongheng had already transferred relevant shares to an outsider, the 
contract at issue was actually impossible to be continuously performed, Xiangxieli’s claim 
requesting continuous performance of the contract at issue could not be supported. Taking into 
consideration that evidences provided by Zongheng were insufficient to prove that it had issued 
invoices to Xiangxieli, which could possibly exert certain impact upon timely payment by 
Xiangxieli, it is approved that Zongheng, at its own discretion, renounces to claim the late fee. 
After termination of the contract at issue, the debt and credit relation occurred due to termination 
of the contract could be settled separately. Based on this, the civil judgment (2008) Hu Yi Zhong 
Min Si (Shang) Zhong Zi No.669 was rendered by Shanghai Municipal No.1 Intermediate 
People’s Court on June 13, 2008, ordering termination of the contract at issue. 
 
The court of first instance was of the opinion that the dispute of this case focused on whether 
Zongheng could confiscate the deposit under the contract at issue. First of all, it had been agreed 
in the contract that Zongheng should issue a formal advertisement operation invoice to 
Xiangxieli prior to the payment by Xiangxieli. The transaction habit of invoice before payment 
had been further explicitly recognized by both parties in the contract, which indicated the great 
significance attached to the sequence of obligation performance by both parties. After the trial by 
the court of the second instance, it is found that Zongheng did not have sufficient evidences to 
prove that it had implemented its pre-contract obligation of issuing invoices on time. Therefore, 
the behavior of Zongheng could, to some extent, exert impact upon the timely payment by 
Xiangxieli. Secondly, Xiangxieli’s conduct of not making payment within agreed period had 
been acknowledged and confirmed by the judgment that had already come into force; however, 
Xiangxieli’s successive payment behavior constituted a waiver of its right of defense of first 
performance. As provided in Article 67 of PRC Contract Law, if each party has an obligation 


75
towards the other and a sequence for the performance of those obligations was agreed upon but 
the party which was to perform his obligation first fails to do so, the other party has the right to 
refuse his demand for performance. Payment period as agreed by the contract at issue was set 
based on the sequence of performance. According to the contract, Xiangxieli absolutely had the 
right to refuse the demand for payment before Zongheng’s issuance of the invoice; however, 
Xiangxieli did not choose to refuse but successively made the payment. Therefore, it could be 
concluded that the above conduct of Xiangxieli could be deemed as of waiver of the defense of 
first performance. However, waiver does not equal to a breach, because the agreed payment 
period is under an uncertain status due to the breach of Zongheng. Thirdly, it had been agreed in 
the contract that if Xiangxieli delays the payment for 25 days, Zongheng is entitled to terminate 
the contract and the deposit of RMB 1 million should not be refunded. Such provision is 
provided for the time point of Zongheng’s executing the right to terminate the contract and 
confiscation of the deposit. In other words, if the time when Xiangxieli makes the payment 
exceeds 25 days after the agreed payment period, Zongheng shall have the right to execute such 
right within a reasonable period. On the other hand, it shall be deemed as a waiver. The contract 
does not grant Zongheng the right to execute the right of confiscation at any time, but it has a 
time restriction. In fact, Zongheng did not execute the right of confiscation within a reasonable 
period, but instead during the litigation of the previous case, chose to demand payment for the 
late fee, Zongheng’s conduct could also be deemed as a waiver of the right of confiscation. 
Based on the above, as there are discrepancies between the agreement and the actual 
performance, there are constant disputes between both parties. No matter it is the waiver of the 
defense of first performance or the waiver of the right of confiscation, it starts from and is 
determined from a perspective of fairness and reasonableness and for the benefit of dispute 
settlement. Taking into consideration that it is impossible to reach an agreement between both 
parties regarding the share buyout matters, and the contract at issue has been terminated, 
Zongheng’s continuous occupancy of the deposit had been lacking of factual and legal basis; 
therefore, Zongheng should refund the deposit to Xiangxieli. 
 
Based on the above, in accordance with Article 98 of the PRC Contract Law, the court of the first 
instance has rendered the judgment as follows: Zongheng should refund the deposit in the 
amount of RMB 1 million to Xiangxieli within ten days after effectiveness of the judgment. The 
case acceptance fee in the amount of RMB 13,800 will be collected in half at the amount of 
RMB 6,900, which should be borne by Zongheng. 
 
After the judgment being rendered by the court of first instance, Zongheng was dissatisfied and 
filed an appeal with this court, requesting to cancel the judgment of first instance and amend it as 
reject the litigation requests filed by Xiangxieli during the trial of first instance. The appellate 
reasons were as follows: 1. Xiangxieli’s fundamental breach of contract resulted in termination 
of the contract, the late fee demanded by Zongheng was against Xiangxieli’s liability for breach 
regarding the deferred payment, while confiscation of the deposit was against the liability for 
breach regarding termination of the contract; both of which were not contradictory to each other. 
The facts asserted by the court of the first instance were wrong; 2. Zongheng had never implied 
to give up its right to confiscate the deposit. And it had been agreed in the contract that if 
Xiangxieli delays the payment, the Appellant is entitled to convert the deposit of RMB 1 million 
into the liquidated damage to confiscate.  
 


76
The Appellee Xiangxieli defended that since Zongheng failed to provide the advertisement 
operation invoices, which caused the untimely payment, and the judgment of the second instance 
for another case did not recognize the fundamental breach at Xiangxieli’s side either, it merely 
asserted that Xiangxieli had waived its right of defense of first performance, thus it requested to 
reject Zongheng’s appellate requests and maintains the original judgment. During the trial of this 
case by this court, neither party has provided any new evidence. 
 
After the trial, this court has found that the facts asserted by the court of first instance are correct 
which is affirmed by this court. 
 
This court is of the opinion that the dispute summarized by the court of the first instance focuses 
on whether Zongheng could confiscate the deposit under the contract at issue, for which neither 
party has any objection. Now the Appellant Zongheng is of the opinion that it has never implied 
that it waives the right to confiscate the deposit of RMB 1 million, the late fee is claimed against 
Xiangxieli’s liability for breach regarding the deferred payment, confiscation of the deposit is 
against the liability for breach concerning termination of the contract, both of which are not 
contradictory to each other. Since the reason caused termination of relevant contract is the 
fundamental breach on Xiangxieli’s side regarding the deferred payment, thus Zongheng is 
entitled to confiscate such deposit of RMB 1 million, the facts asserted by the court of the first 
instance regarding this are wrong. 
 
This court through the trial and examination of evidences provided by both parties, is of the 
opinion that during performance of the contract at issue, for Zongheng, its failure to provide 
advertisement operation invoices on time as agreed in the contract constitutes a breach, and 
Zongheng’s such breach, to certain extent, caused that Xiangxieli did not make the payment of 
deposit and advertisement operation transfer fee on time as agreed in the contract. However, 
during the following performance procedure, Xiangxieli paid the deposit of RMB 1 million and 
advertisement operation transfer fee for the first quarter to Zongheng in several installments, 
which had been received by Zongheng also in several installments accordingly. Xiangxieli has 
started to make the relevant payments even before receipt of advertisement operation invoices, 
which conforms to the fact asserted by the court of the first instance that Xiangxieli had waived 
its right to refuse payment as its right of defense of first performance. On the other side, 
Zongheng did not timely execute its right to terminate the contract and confiscate the deposit due 
to Xiangxieli’s deferred payment, but instead accepted the deferred payment of deposit and 
advertisement operation transfer fee from Xiangxieli, which indicates that Zongheng chose to 
recognize Xiangxieli’s continuous performance of the contract, without executing its right to 
confiscate the deposit. In addition, under the circumstances that not informing Xiangxieli, 
Zongheng has concluded a share transfer agreement with an outsider of this case, which is 
actually the fundamental reason causing the impossibility of continuous performance of the 
contract and further termination of such contract. This court also has noticed that such appellate 
claims filed by Zongheng had already been put forward during the original trial. Since during the 
trial conducted by this court, Zongheng fails to provide further evidences accordingly to support 
its claim, thus the appellate opinions from Zongheng are not supported by this court. 
 
Based on all of the above, the appellate claims of the Appellant Zongheng lack of factual basis, 
thus are not supported by this court. The original judgment which asserted facts clear and 


77
correctly applied laws, should be maintained. In accordance with item (1), Para 1 of Article 153, 
and Article 158 of PRC Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is as follows:
