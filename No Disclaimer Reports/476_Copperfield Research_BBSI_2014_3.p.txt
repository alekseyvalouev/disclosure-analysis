Barrett Business
Services (BBSI):
Throwing Good
Money At Bad
Nov. 11, 2014 1:02 PM ET17 comments | Includes: Barrett â€¦


Today we share a follow-up to our original BBSi report. We believe the analysis
herein is even more impactful than our original report. Below are the
highlights of our second report, which concludes BBSI may have as much as a
$135 million funding gap (as well as revealing another crippling reserve charge
is likely). Our analysis, based on a plethora of new disclosures and data points
suggests an updated fair value for BBSI is between $0.00 and $8.76 per
share, representing 65% to 100% downside.

Barrett Business Services (NASDAQ:BBSI) has suffered a precipitous stock
price decline over the last two months as the confession process has begun.
Despite a stock price down nearly 75% from its highs, we believe the risk
speculating in BBSI's common stock has never been higher. Simply put, a
$100 stock that goes to $25 generates a smaller percentage loss than a $25
stock that goes to $0. Uninformed investors/traders appear to have fallen
victim to the dangerous temptation of assuming the worst is behind BBSI,
declaring the bottom is in, the bounce is at hand, or as the irresponsible sell-
side has proclaimed - the decks have been cleared. This follow-up report,
based on new information and disclosures since our first report, unequivocally
concludes the worst has yet to come for BBSI.


On 9/16/14, we shared a lengthy BBSI report titled, "Barrett Business Services
(BBSI): A Tick-Tick-Ticking Time Bomb" (it can now be printed to
accommodate many requests).[i] Following BBSI's third quarter financial
release and disclosure of an $80 million reserve charge (10/28/14), we briefly

shared updated thoughts in "BBSI: Tick-Tick Boom."[ii] In short, substantial
downside still exists and making money owning BBSI's stock appears to be
effectively capped.


It is our opinion that the $80 million reserve charge is just the beginning.
Based on management's recent disclosures, our analysis suggests BBSI will be
required to take another reserve charge of at least $55 million. We believe the
company is not only aware of this probability, but management's bizarre
actions are an attempt to prop up the stock price long enough to minimize the
dilution of an eventual distressed equity raise. (To this point, we are
admittedly surprised BBSI's management has not yet "hit the road" to meet
with institutional investors).


Our first report accurately analyzed BBSI's systematic reserve deficiencies. In
this report, we provide an equally concise, and perhaps irrefutable argument
supporting our belief that another reserve charge is on the horizon. We can
not stress enough that the recent $80 million charge does not "clear
the decks" as some interested parties have argued. In fact, per BBSI's
own admission, the $80 million charge only targets reserve
deficiencies for accident years 2012 and prior, leaving the severe
workers' comp under-accrual from 2013 and 2014 unaddressed. This
begs the question - Did BBSI ignore Willis' recommendation of a larger reserve
charge that would have covered the 2013/2014 under-accruals, but also would
have effectively wiped out the common equity in the process?


The same sell-side analysts that were politely excused from prior culpability
(due to their lack of insurance expertise) have failed to think independently,
suggesting the bad medicine has been taken. Our analysis herein
unequivocally concludes BBSI is still massively under-reserved. By extension,
a common equity raise appears to be a question of "when" not "if" which
explains management's token buyback, dividend increase, and immaterial
insider buying. In this report, we cover a number of topics, including:


1) BBSI Appears Unprofitable; Another Large Reserve Charge Is
Inevitable (& Management Knows It); ACE Risk Grows


BBSI's reserve charge only addresses reserve deficiencies through calendar
year 2012. As such, 2013/2014 reserves require significant strengthening.
Based on an accident year model allocating the $80 million reserve charge and

prior period development, we estimate BBSI's core business lost money every
year between 2009 and 2012.Our analysis found the strengthened 2010 -
2012 reserves are approximately 45% and 26% higher than 2013 and
2014 reserve levels respectively. To bring 2013/2014 reserve levels to
parity with 2010 - 2012 reserves, we estimate another $70 million
charge is required. If BBSI management took the 2013/2014 reserves to a
level consistent with updated accrual guidance, a $55 million charge would be
required. We believe management's carefully worded press release and
prepared remarks on its Q3'14 call means the actuarial rigor used to establish
accident year reserves for "2012 and prior" was abandoned for determining
2013/2014 reserves. While management may try to buy time, hoping the
actuarial data magically improves, we believe ACE may reconsider the fronting
agreement in the interim. BBSI has changed materially since the fronting
agreement was announced. Further, ACE's trusted partner Willis was used for
the reserve study (as we predicted), suggesting ACE may not be comfortable
with BBSI's reserves/underwriting. In our opinion, BBSI would likely go into
run-off should ACE non-renew its fronting agreement.


2) Debt Alone Can Not Bridge BBSI's Funding Gap, Which Appears
Much Larger Than Disclosed


BBSI is required to collateralize its $80 million reserve charge on a dollar-for-
dollar basis to stay in compliance with State requirements. Under new law,
California regulators have the discretion to require a security deposit greater
than 100% of reserves in cases resembling BBSI. Management has proclaimed
$32 million of the required funding can be met through a tax refund. But
based on our analysis, the anticipated refund (40% of the $80 million charge)
represents 55% more than the $20.7 million of cash taxes BBSI has paid since
2009. Insurance companies are typically limited to debt-to-capitalization ratios
of 20% to 25%. Should Wells Fargo view BBSI in the same vein as other
insurers, BBSI's debt capacity may only be $8.5 to $11.5 million. If BBSI
somehow raised $65 million of debt (on just $34.4 million of equity), its
leverage ratio would be 65%, higher than any solvent insurance company we
could find. BBSI's 2014 cash flow has failed to cover the required funding of
the ACE trust account. Year-to-date, BBSI has contributed $31.1 million to the
ACE trust account representing more than 100% of its already overstated cash
flow. We believe an additional $20 million to $50 million is needed to fully
collateralize the original ACE funding agreement. The ACE funding burden will

be concurrent with the State level funding requirements on legacy reserve
levels, at the same time BBSI will also be struggling to fund current and future
reserves dollar-for-dollar. According to BBSI management, the company has
$15 million of unencumbered cash, $14 million on an undrawn credit facility,
and our estimate of a $21 million tax refund from cash taxes paid. We
estimate BBSI has $185 million of near-term capital needs with only $50
million of identified sources. The result is a $135 million capital hole.
Considering the expected hole, we find management's actions in the wake of
the reserve charge irrational and irresponsible. As recently as September
2014, BBSI wasted precious capital to buy back stock at prices nearly 100%
higher than the current price. Instead of prudently rightsizing exposure
through re-underwriting and re-pricing its business, BBSI management
announced it would grow same store sales in 2015. Finally, BBSI increased its
quarterly dividend by 22% (which it will not be able to cover based on our
2015 estimates), despite requiring $80 million of near-term capital.


3) Irrationally Aggressive Pricing and Outlandish Marketing Claims


We believe BBSI has materially underpriced its workers' compensation
insurance to grow in a highly commoditized industry. BBSI's own marketing
materials claim to offer "lower workers' compensation premiums [due to]
aggressive claims management." Amazingly, we have obtained BBSI marketing
slides stating their California loss ratio is just 10% - 14%. This compares to
standard market carrier loss ratios between 50% and 75%. BBSI's own
marketing materials suggest it would be 600% - 700% more profitable than
the industry average cited by the California Department of Insurance. Further,
we question what BBSI means when referring to "aggressive claims
management." Public lawsuits shed insight into the challenges individuals have
had obtaining settlements, while also leading us to question why BBSI
accepted a workers' compensation client one year after being charged with
defrauding the California State Compensation Insurance Fund.


4) Stock Still Significantly Overvalued on Estimated 2015 EPS


At a 12x earnings multiple on our generous set of 2015 earnings estimates,
BBSI's fair value would be $8.76 per share. Our estimates generously exclude
increased costs associated with changes to the ACE fronting agreement (which
mathematically appears impossible). With the combination of another reserve
charge looming for 2013/2014 business, uncertainty about its funding/capital
