Ricky Sandler Long GMCR & ZNGA, Short WAB
(Invest For Kids Chicago Presentation)


We're posting up notes from the Invest For Kids Chicago conference 2015.  Next up


is Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler who pitched a long of Keurig Green


Mountain Coffee (GMCR). 








Ricky Sandler's Invest For Kids Chicago Presentation 





•    At 25 launched his own business Fusion Partners. In '98 started Eminence 


•    Long idea: GMCR/Keurig Green Mountain. 


•    Controversial there is a credible short story. Thinks it’s already priced in and


an incredible long opportunity. 


•    Two businesses, hot biz (kcups) and Kold with sodas, brand new. 


•    Hot platform sell 9MM to 10mm brewers/year and sell 10B to 11B kcups per


year. 


•    Razor/razorblade model. 


•    Significant room for increased household penetration. Current penetration at


21M to 22M households compared to 70MM homes. With a coffeemaker. 


•    Think market goes single serve. 


•    Industry kcup should grow in the LDD range. 


•    $4 of EPS from the hot business in FY15 estimated. 


•    Think hot EPS can reach $5 over the next couple years driven by volume


growth, $300MM restructuring, normalizing brewer losses form the last holiday


season, normalized coffee costs, share buybacks and offsetting some headwinds. 


•    Kold launched in September with Coca-Cola. Addressable market thinks its 5x


– 10x hot. 


•    Reviews are high on quality but negative on price/value. 


•    $375 asp per machine and pods more expensive than a can of coke. 


•    Not so much price of pod, but thinks the range of pods/products. 


•    Think its convenience/choice. Negatives looking at just price. 


•    Kold loss 50 cents per share.

•    Trades at 15.5x FY15E sept EPS and 13.5x EPS ex kold. 


•    EPS estimates under pressure – poor 2.0 brewer launch execution and K-cup


profitability impacted by mix shift. Finally negative reaction to kold. 


•    Hot value = 17x -20x hot EPS ($5) or 85-100 plus option value for kold. 


•    KO owns 17% at $92. Insiders bought at $90. 








•    Loves Baidu (BIDU), and a top five position. 








•    Zynga (ZNGA) – mobile gaming. Franchises include Farmville, words with


friends. 


•    Some think games are obsolete, ZNGA has 75MM active users. 


•    Zynga was late to the consumer shift from desktop to mobile making the last


two years rough. •    Mobile games for the last year =70% of bookings vs 30% a year


ago. 


•    Expect new titles over the next 12 months. 


•    Trading at 1x sales when backing out SF real estate ($500MM value). $687MM


EV. 


•    Launch 6 new games, $300MM incremental bookings bringing total bookings to


$900MM. 


•    KING sold for 2.6x sales, using that valuation = $5. 


•    At a 35% margin, ZNGA generate $315MM EBITDA or trading for 2x. 


•    Has big infrastructure to support bigger biz. Downside protection by cash and


real estate. 


•    Top hit potential = $1B rev potential. 


•    Mobile gaming is $20B biz. New categories such as esports and real money


gaming growing. 








•    Wabtec (WAB) – Short. 


•    Leading supplier of brakes, electronics and other railroad components to the


global rail industry. 


•    55% - 60% of EBIT comes from NA freight segment. 


•    LT rail is GDPish industry and cyclical. 


•    Track record is fantastic – only US listed co whose stock price increased every


year for 14 straight years, 19% EPS CAGR form 06 to 15E and hadn’t missed


earnings since 09 and 3Q15. 


•    Bull thesis – not cyclical, high ROIC/ high market share high after market


mix/quality biz. 


•    Product mix is opaque due to acquisition strategy. 


•    Bulls think EPS will grow double digits for ever. 


•    WAB is cyclical and currently at the peak of rail equipment super cycle driven

by NA O&G activity. 


•    Demand driven by trail traffic, production of new locomotives and freight cars. 


•    Rail traffic is weak – CNI talking about laying off employees. 


•    Locomotives – NSC storing locomotives, expect it to be up to 200. GE orders


dropped significantly, only sold compared 3 the last quarter. 


•    Freightcar peak – industry backlog driven by tank cars oil and covered hoppers


i.e. frack sand. 40% downside to deliveries. 


•    Trading at 20x EPS, 13x EBITDA. Could be peak earnings in FY15. Mid cycle


earnings $3.5 - $4. At 16x = $60 or 30% downside. 


•    Low short interest, favorable sell side ratings. 


•    Consensus calls for positive organic growth.
