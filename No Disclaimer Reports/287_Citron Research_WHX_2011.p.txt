ANOTHER STOCK ONLY A
COMPUTER COULD LOVE:
THE SEQUEL


Citron Now introduces Whiting Trust
USA (NYSE:WHX).


Just three weeks ago, Citron introduced readers to
GNI, a stock with a �xed liquidation date, at which
point it simply dissolves, worthless.  On any
computer dividend screener GNI seemed like a nice
conservative play, but in reality it is ticking bomb. 


Within just three weeks, GNI has lost 1/3rd of its
stock price. (and is still handsomely overvalued.  It
is Citron’s opinion that it likely has further to fall. )


No fraud, no big earnings miss, just simply a
reminder that computers cannot do all of the work
of man.


At the time, Citron �gured GNI was a one-time
anomaly in the market.  But here is another one
that shares the same attributes.


Meet Whiting Trust USA.


In the most basic terms, WHX is very similar to GNI. 
With 100% certainty, it also goes to a zero value. 
No fraud, no deception, and fully disclosed in its
�lings.


WHX has been bid up to a level completely
detached from its real value, having been

erroneously included with comparable “real”
dividend and cash �ow stocks that have an
enduring asset base.  While the details di�er
slightly, the insane mispricing of this stock is even
more extreme than GNI.


The Details, But No Devil
WHX’s 10-K’s and 10-Q’s all plainly state that it is an
income trust, with rights to revenues from 90% of
oil and gas property sales, up to a maximum of 9.11
MMBOE (barrel of oil equivalence), a gross measure
of hydrocarbon energy.  At the point where 9.11
MBOE is sold from the trust, it liquidates.  It has no
other assets, and minimal cash.


10-K here:

“As of December 31, 2007, the Trust had no
assets other than a de minimus cash balance
from the initial capitalization and had
conducted no operations other than
organizational activities. In April 2008, the Trust
issued 13,863,889 units of bene�cial interest in
the Trust (“Trust units”) to Whiting in exchange
for the conveyance of a term net pro�ts
interest (“NPI”) by Whiting Oil and Gas. The NPI
represents the right for the Trust to receive
90% of the net proceeds from Whiting’s
interests in certain existing oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquid producing properties which
we refer to as “the underlying properties”. The
underlying properties are located in the Rocky
Mountains, Mid-Continent, Permian Basin and
Gulf Coast regions. The underlying properties
include interests in 3,086 gross (381.7 net)
producing oil and gas wells. Immediately after
the conveyance, Whiting completed an initial
public o�ering of Trust units selling 11,677,500
such units. Whiting retained ownership of
2,186,389 Trust units, or 15.8% of the total
Trust units issued and outstanding.


The NPI will terminate when 9.11 MMBOE have
been produced and sold from the underlying

properties (which amount is the equivalent of
8.20 MMBOE in respect of the Trust’s right to
receive 90% of the net proceeds from such
reserves pursuant to the NPI), and the Trust will
soon thereafter wind up its a�airs and
terminate. As of December 31, 2009, on an
accrual basis 2.77 MMBOE of the Trust’s total
8.20 MMBOE have been produced and sold and
0.02 MMBOE have been divested.”


Note that GNI’s liquidation date is determined by
calendar, where WHX liquidates when its resource
allotment of oil and gas is produced and sold.  But
the e�ect is just the same.  Zero is zero.


As of November 2010, this trust, established in
2007, has now produced and sold about 43% of its
allocated resource in just 11 quarters.  (3.54
MMBOE of its net interest of 8.20 MMBOE)  At
current run rates it will pass the “half-gone” point
next quarter.


If its current production run rate is maintained, the
trust would liquidate in just 15.3 quarters. 
However, production in mature wells tends to
decline, so the payout rate may decline and stretch
out over a longer timespan – but this wouldn’t add
to its value….it just delays when the shareholders
get their returns.  While energy prices might be
higher in outlying years if the payout slowed,
production costs would burden those lower yields. 
A longer payout path also reduces the net present
value of the income stream.  The bottom line:  the
timeline is not friendly to investors either way.


WHX gives investors gas
The energy market since 2008 has changed
dramatically for oil and gas pricing.  These
commodities used to trade close to energy
equivalence.  The WHX Whiting trust was designed
around this assumption — the revenue structure
treats oil and gas production for sale more or less
interchangeably.


But since the huge discoveries of shale oil in the US,
and the relative inelasticity of gas demand, gas
prices have plunged relative to oil   Last quarter, gas
5/18/2018 Another Stock Only a Computer Could Love: The Sequel – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/another-stock-only-a-computer-could-love-the-sequel/ 4/7


was 40% of WHX’s energy production, but only 20%
of the revenues.


The only hope for a investors to recover today’s
price in WHX would be soaring energy prices before
the production quotas are reached.  But while the
spot price of oil is now high (near the company’s
average sales price in 2008), gas has fallen by nearly
half, depressed by the supply glut due to the huge
shale discoveries brought on line in the US, and is
not expected to recover in coming years.   So the
blended energy price (appx 60% oil, 40% gas for
WHX’s production portfolio), hedged as they are,
and weighed down by low gas prices for the
foreseeable future, is unlikely to produce a windfall,
and a poor play on oil price spikes.


Check Please!
For a normal company, dividends are a quarterly
reminder of the health of the company’s
sustainable cash �ow.  But how do you value a
company that depletes and goes away?   Standard
runo� calculations are based on the present value
of future payment streams.  For our model, we’ve
assumed the current run rate continues, having
explained why a longer run rate only defers
estimated income, and won’t create additional
revenue.


In our model, WHX pay 15.3 quarterly distributions
plus about .20 in cash per share when the trust is
liquidated appx., April 2015.


So what does WHX earn?  Since stabilizing its
payouts in 2009, WHX has paid .60 to .80 per
quarter.  So we analyzed the net present value of
15.3 quarters of distributions for WHX, with
quarterly estimates up to 50% higher than its last
7 quarter average, and we get a most likely value
below $10.00.  Even in the “best case scenario” (not
likely because a huge spike in energy costs would
pressure in�ation and push up the discount rate),
there’s just no way we come up with anything north
of $15.00.

How Can This Be Possible?


In a world where single-stock research is rapidly
becoming extinct, drowned by the massive waves of
quant funds and computer generated trading, the
above detail – that this company is soon to become
extinct – has been entirely forgotten.


Don’t take our word for it:  look at these references
to WHX in articles titled “Best Yielding Stocks”, “Top
Net Cash Flow Stocks”….etc., where it is compared
to other stocks that …… well ….. won’t cease to exist
on April 2015.   So the computers go about their
merry way,   (We’re convinced that, as well as
executing most trading, most of these articles are
written by computers, too.)

This must be a �rst!  … An analyst
Citron agrees with.
You can’t fault Ray Jay for putting an
“underperform” on this issue, with a 10 target,
when the stock was 22 in May.  Even though Ray Jay
was the underwriter for this issue, the facts are just
the facts.  However, in the case of a normal stock, a
10 target wouldn’t be subject to depletion.  In the
bizarre world of WHX, the two quarterly
distributions since the date of that target actually
bring it 1.44 closer to zero.  So in current terms, this
Ray Jay’s 10 target is really now a market-adjusted
$8.56.


Conclusion:
Any valuation above $12,00 for WHX would require
a huge leap of faith. (Generally, persistent high oil
prices would spur in�ation, and would tend to
correlate with higher discount rates.)    Based on
today’s market, a market-neutral estimate would
get you about $8.50, which is right in line with Ray
Jay’s 10 target, less the last two quarterly
distributions.


Just like GNI, the above articles simply ignore the
fatal �aw in their investment premise – that this
company has ongoing enterprise value, which it
simply does not.


The science of stock picking , which begins by
reading the �lings is apparently Not Dead Yet.
