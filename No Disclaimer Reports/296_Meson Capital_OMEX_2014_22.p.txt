made by OMEX.

opposition to the Oceanica project and supporting the Fisheries - will protest to the
President.


Fisheries Cooperative Society Production Puerto Chale, an important Fishing coop
and major contributor to the Baja economy is formally opposed to the project.


"We are completely against mining projects being established in this area, above all
within our municipality, as it aggressively threatens the different marine species and
ecosystems" - Mayor of Comondu.


At a minimum, it appears further scientific studies will be required to resolve
important questions for both the fishing economy and the gray whale population
impacts.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s Oceanica "Don Diego" project has its
EIA filed for roughly one month now which means the environmental groups can formally

Oct 3, Constitucion, Baja California Sur (NYSE:BCS). During a meeting held in Comondú
town hall, attended by the Mayor, Perez Sanchez, representatives of the local fishing
cooperatives and various authorities, among them the Fishing secretary, José Fernando
García Romero, the rejection against a phosphate mining project, which aims to develop
in the Gulf of Ulloa, was made clear.


"We are completely against mining projects being established in this area, above all within
our municipality, as it aggressively threatens the different marine species and ecosystems.
So as the municipal government, we will lead all possible actions to prevent the "Don
Diego" project, promoted by the company Ocean Explorations, from being authorized in
the Gulf of Ulloa" said Mayor Pérez Sánchez before the fishing leaders.


Before the demonstrations against the project both by the state and municipal authorities,
and the industry, some agreements were made to initiate action against Oceanic
Explorations:


First, they will send a pronouncement to the head of SEMARNAT, in which the members of
the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Aquaculture will pronounce themselves to be fully
against the authorization of the Environmental Impact Statement for the project.

The Baja California Sur fishing federations and cooperatives unite against marine
mining


Sept 30 - La Paz, Baja California Sur . Unify the fisheries sector in Baja California Sur and
nationally in order to create a front against marine mining in the seas of the Gulf of Ulloa,
off the coast of Comondú.


Florencio Aguilar Liera, president of the fisheries agency, is urgently seeking the
unification of the cooperatives and federations. So at the meeting of the Subcommittee on

company Oceanic Explorations.


"We all depend, especially us, on fish stocks. The other groups are with us, they
strengthen us, support us, in order to say no to mining. Everyone is pulling the same
direction: towards a rejection of this project", said the leader.


The Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative asked Jesus Camacho, leader of the National
Confederation of Fishing Cooperatives (CONACOOP), to take a position. This body, for
one, will seek out the head of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT), José Guerra Abud, to let him know of the concerns the industry has in
California.


"We also ask Jesus Salvador Ojeda, president of the Ecology Commission, and part of
this sector, to intervene to see if he can get on the podium and make sure the information
is made   public," he added.


He said he will monitor the actions of the General Directorate of Risk and Environmental
Impact of SEMARNAT, and based on the result, "would decide upon how to proceed."


"I am confident they will back down, but am more confident in our own people, and that we
can confront this ugly monster. I cannot say that I trust (the federal government) fully
because I don´t know what is going on behind the scenes; you know there are many
things going on in the background ", he said.


Oceanic Explorations S de RL de CV submitted their Environmental Impact Statement, to
the General Directorate of Risk and Environmental Impact of SEMARNAT, on September
3, 2014, but the environmental authority decided to publicize the start of the process in the
Ecological Gazette on September 17, 2014.


The Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative said that their fishing concessions are in danger,
because the phosphate mining project is located right within the same coordinates.


Marine mining will affect the Grey whale and fishing in Comondú; a public
consultation is sought

Sept 24 - La Paz, Baja California Sur . The position of the Puerto Chale Fishing
Cooperative on the Don Diego marine mining project proposed by Oceanic Explorations
de S de RL de CV remains negative despite the change in leadership.


Upon assuming the leadership, Florencio Aguilar decided to issue a warning of the
damage that the dredging of the seabed could cause to the dynamics of the marine
populations.


The fisheries engineer, Bareño Tomás Camacho, manager of the technical department of
the fisheries body, presented a series of slides that showed a direct influence of the
mining concession on the fishing concession, and the fishing area.

"The place that this project will impact the most is our concession area and the fishing
spots, just consider the plume of sediment dispersion and the noise," he said.


Oceanic Explorations S de RL de CV submitted the Environmental Impact Statement to
the General Directorate of Environmental Impact and Risk of Semarnat (Secretariat of
Environment and Natural Resources) on September 3, 2014, but the environmental
authority decided to publicize the start of the process in the Ecological Gazette on
September 17, 2014.


The company insists that the coordinates of the five marine sites are not located in
established fishing areas, contradicting the Comondú fisheries sector.

To demonstrate its position, the fishing association made   a comparison between the strip
of dispersed sediment cloud (part of the Gragado system) in the north and south of Bahia
de Ulloa. He concluded that the level of suspended solids rises to 10 micrograms per litre
in some parts.


The increase in sound waves can cause a prolific effect to the conduct of the Grey Whale,
the cooperative found that there are perimeters in which up to 120 Hertz are generated. In
other portions, these can reach up to 140 Hertz of noise, generated by the dredging
machine of the huge ship.

For all of their concerns, the Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative decided to start the
process of public consultation, so the public could learn about the objectives of the
company.


"The project is located in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mexico in the Bay of Ulloa on
the west coast of Baja California Sur, between Abreojos and Cabo San Lazaro, to give it
points of reference on land, with its nearest point a distance of 12 nautical miles (22.224
meters) from the coast" according to the Environmental Impact Statement for the Don
Diego project.
