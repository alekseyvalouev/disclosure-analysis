GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On
AmTrust
Jan. 14, 2014 10:15 AM ET28 comments
by: The GeoTeam


In this report we will present new evidence to support our belief that Amtrust's
(NASDAQ:AFSI) reported financial statements are unreliable. AFSI appears to have
understated gross adverse development by over $100 million, and therefore gross
adverse development appears to be 300% larger than reported in the company's 10-K.
We believe that this is yet another telltale sign that the losses ceded to the company's
Luxembourg captives are not reflected in the 10-K, as covered exhaustively in our first
report. Additionally, the 10-K appears to be missing $276.9 million of gross loss reserves
confirming our initial report.


Often times, when a company has reported incorrect financial statements, multiple
accounts are misstated. For example, in many China fraud cases that we have covered,
overstated revenues resulted in false cash balances and uncollectible receivables. In the
case of AFSI, we believe that the underreported losses have resulted in understated gross
loss reserves in financials reported to the SEC.


Additionally, AFSI conducted a conference call to address some of the issues we raised,
and our conviction has not wavered. In this report, we present additional analysis using
the information provided in the conference call which we believe bolsters our claim. A full
transcript of the call is available here.


We are still short shares of AFSI, and based on the additional evidence and information
provided by the company in their conference call, we have revised our fair value estimate
to $2.17 - $6.51 per share. Investors who view our target as extreme and rely on
continued support by sell side analysts should keep in mind that just prior to Tower
Group's (NASDAQ:TWGP) 87% collapse, many of the analysts urging investors to buy
AFSI today were recommending TWGP then. In our view, that supports our view that
many sector analysts are simply unaware of these issues or are willing to accept simple
anecdotal answers from AFSI management as they did with TWGP. Remember, analysts
get paid for helping the AFSIs and TWGPs of the world, not investors.


A prime example is Guggenheim, who deemed our report "not worthy of comment" without
actually providing an argument to support its view. Just three weeks after issuing this
dismissive commentary, AFSI disclosed that Guggenheim advised the company on the

acquisition of TWGP.


In this report, we will discuss:


1. How AFSI's 2012 Gross Adverse Development in US statutory filings is over $100
million more than the amount reported in its 2012 10-K. We believe that this is further
evidence of the company underreporting losses and violating US GAAP. We note that
PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC") cited Maiden Holdings (NASDAQ:MHLD) for
deficiencies that included the "failure to give appropriate consideration to US
GAAP" while Ron Pipoly (current CFO of AFSI) was the acting CFO of MHLD.


2. AFSI's "response" regarding Luxembourg's contribution to profits and why it appears to
support our thesis and contradict company disclosures.


3. The company's latest disclosures regarding Phoenix policies now gives investors the
ability to separate Phoenix contracts from the rest and facilitates further analysis,
which we believe further supports our conclusion that the values are overstated. AFSI
appears to value non-Phoenix policies at double the value used by competitors.


Section 1: New Evidence Shows Severe Discrepancies and Supports our Original
Thesis


In the section below, we compare gross adverse development and gross loss reserves
from AFSI's statutory filings to the same information in its 10-K and explain why the data
further increases our suspicion that AFSI is not properly accounting for the losses
ceded to their wholly-owned Luxembourg captives.


A) Gross Adverse Development Discrepancies Between 10-K & Statutory Filings


In the insurance industry, "development" refers to the change in the estimate of claim
payments that will ultimately be paid on policies for which the premiums were earned in
prior years. Positive development results in reserve releases and adverse development
results in reserve charges. Reserve releases (charges) go through the income statement
as an offset to (increase in) loss and loss adjustment expenses.


As discussed in our initial report, AFSI's reported results appeared "too good to be true"
as the company grew rapidly without a misstep along the way. We found this hard to
believe in the context of a long soft market and noticed other fast-growing peers were
struggling with severe adverse development. For example, TWGP announced they would
take an additional $75-105 million charge to increase reserves for workers' compensation
and other lines of business in which AFSI is active -- just two months after announcing it
would take a $365 million charge!

AFSI's statutory filings make it clear that AFSI is not immune to adverse development. In
fact, AFSI's statutory filings show the company is experiencing substantial gross
adverse loss development. This is hardly surprising given the regulated, price-taking
nature of commercial insurance. However, the resulting liability present in the statutory
filings does not appear to show up in the financials filed with the SEC. We would
expect such an anomaly to be very concerning for investors and regulators.


In the next subsection of this report, we show how gross loss and loss adjustment
reserves or "loss reserves" (balance sheet liability) in statutory filings exceed those of the
10-K by the amount of cumulative losses ceded to Luxembourg captives. As such, we
suspect inter-company reinsurance agreements with Luxembourg captives and the failure
to eliminate all inter-company transactions and "give appropriate consideration to US
GAAP" (as Pipoly did at MHLD, see Section 1).


The table below summarizes AFSI's gross adverse development for 2012 by underwriting
group:


Ultimate Claim Payment Estimates by Accident Year as of December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2012, respectively.


The tables below are from Technology Insurance Company & Affiliates' (AFSI's
consolidated US statutory subsidiaries) 2011 and 2012 Schedule P, Part 1. The first
column shows the estimated "ultimate loss pick" by "accident year". The "ultimate loss
pick" is the company's estimate of cumulative payments they will make over time for
claims on policies that it covered in a given "accident year". The "accident year" can be
thought of as a vintage. It refers to the year in which the premium was earned and an
event that resulted in a claim occurred, regardless of when the claim was filed:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 4/24


Below we compare the change in ultimate loss picks for the two years which shows
AFSI's US subsidiaries had gross adverse development of $129.8 million in 2012.


In addition to the total gross adverse development being substantial, it pervaded almost all
accident years (with 2011 still being relatively unseasoned) which indicates systemic
under-reserving. This degree of gross adverse development is consistent with the results
of other aggressive peers like QBE and MIG, but the uniformly negative development
indicates AFSI could have TWGP-like reserve deficiencies.

AFSI's 10-K Shows Meaningfully Less Gross Adverse Development


Despite the $129.8 million of gross adverse development disclosed in statutory filings,
AFSI's 10-K shows only $26.645 million of gross adverse development:


We would have expected to see approximately $130 million of gross adverse
development in the 10-K, subject to the development reported by AFSI's other
underwriting subsidiaries because there are only very minor differences between GAAP
and SAP when it comes to accounting for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.


To demonstrate, we also checked Meadowbrook's (NYSE:MIG) statutory filings, which
showed gross adverse development of $97.5 million - only $1.4 million larger than
disclosed in its 10-K ($96.1 million).


B) Comparison of 10-K & Statutory Filing Gross Loss & LAE Reserves Corroborates
Our View


Our original report identified what we believe to be the under-recognition of $276.9 million
in net loss & loss adjustment expenses. Now we turn our attention to gross loss and loss
adjustment expense ("LAE") reserves (balance sheet items).



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MIG

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 6/24


If AFSI is correctly accounting for its Luxembourg captives by applying US GAAP, then
one would expect the gross loss & LAE reserves of AFSI's direct underwriting subsidiaries
(US Subs, AEL, and AIUL) to very closely approximate the gross loss & LAE reserves
shown in the 10-K. This is not the case. Instead, we see a discrepancy of $276.7
million - which was our estimated ceded losses to Luxembourg captives.


*AII assumes losses from the US Subs, AEL, and AIUL, so including these reserves would
be double-counting.


**ACHL assumes losses from AII, so including its gross reserves would be double-
counting. If AII and/or ACHL assumed losses from any third parties, the difference would
only make the problem worse.


For readers who may not have read our original report, we have reproduced the table
where we summed the net losses ceded to Luxembourg seemingly not reflected in the 10-
K:


The discrepancy between statutory and GAAP loss reserves strongly suggests
AFSI is not appropriately recognizing the gross loss expense incurred (the
provision which goes to build the reserve) by Luxembourg captives under US
GAAP. We suspect that AFSI is offsetting this expense in Luxembourg by reversing
equalization reserve liabilities to smooth losses in Luxembourg captives which, while
acceptable under Luxembourg GAAP, is not compliant with US GAAP.


Interestingly, this appears to be how AFSI presented the "gross" loss expense and "gross"
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses (aka: loss reserves) when preparing its AII-
Bermuda financial statements in 2010, as we explain below.


First, note that unpaid losses ceded (a balance sheet liability) to ACHL-Lux are netted out
BEFORE arriving at the $568.091 million gross loss & loss adjustment reserve number:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 7/24


Gross Losses and LAE are comprised of direct (issued to ultimate policyholder) and
assumed (acting as a reinsurer) losses and LAE. Net Losses and LAE subtract out the
ceded (reinsured) portion. Notice that the sum of assumed (before netting for any ceded)
unpaid losses and LAE (the second column above) is $662.067 million, not $568.091
million. We believe $662.067 million is the true gross unpaid losses and LAE. However,
AII-Bermuda incorporates the benefit of $93.975 million of reinsurance from ACHL
(Luxembourg) before presenting the "gross" reserve. Below we reconfigure the table
above to show the true gross loss reserves:


However, we note that $568.1 million (instead of $662.067 million) is presented on the
balance sheet as the gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserve:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 8/24


As discussed in our original report, only after excluding the losses ceded to Luxembourg
can we tie out the net loss and loss adjustment expense (income statement expense)
between AFSI's subsidiaries' AM Best reports and 10-K.


The analysis presented above demonstrates two critical points. First, just like other
insurance companies that grew rapidly in the soft market and reported hard-to-believe loss
ratios, statutory filings show AFSI is experiencing severe gross adverse development
meaning the business is less profitable than the company originally projected. Second,
the full extent of AFSI's gross adverse development does not appear to be reported
in AFSI's SEC filings.


Unfortunately, AFSI's other entities do not provide the same level of detail as US statutory
filings. However, we believe there is sufficient data to rule out the possibility of offsetting
positive development. For Amtrust Europe Limited ("AEL"), AFSI's UK insurance
subsidiary, we know net development was negative based on the AEL annual report filed
with the registrar Companies House.


Insurance companies that experience negative net development almost always have
negative gross development as well. Under proportionate reinsurance, net and gross
development is inextricably linked. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer does

not step in unless losses exceed a certain level. Negative net development indicates that
more claims are approaching and/or breaching the level where reinsurers start bearing the
risk.


For Amtrust International Underwriters Limited ("AIUL") we can also rule out the possibility
of sufficient positive development to offset the US statutory subsidiaries because AIUL
only had $97.4 million of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of the end
of 2011. In other words, the maximum positive gross development AIUL could have
had was $97.4 million which still would not be enough to offset the discrepancies. It
would require all previously estimated claims to have been zero (and that still wouldn't be
enough!) Further, AIUL's net loss ratio is 90.4% after benefiting from inter-company
reinsurance agreements. Therefore, it's unlikely that AIUL had anything but meaningfully
adverse gross development.

We continue to suspect the difference between loss and loss adjustment expenses and
reserves is the result of AFSI's Luxembourg captives "utilizing" equalization reserves to
the tune of $276.9 million. The additional data from primary sources presented above
serves to further increase our confidence that the company is sending losses to
Luxembourg captives and failing to correctly consolidate the losses when reporting results
to investors.


Section 2: Why AFSI's Conference Call Enhances Our Confidence Regarding
Luxembourg


In our view, the press release announcing the call and the call itself were completely
devoid of facts to support the "positive outlook" headline of the company-issued press
release. In addition, management failed to provide any details to answer the questions we
raised about Luxembourg captives, equalization reserves, and AFSI's apparent failure to
consolidate losses ceded to Luxembourg captives. This is in stark contrast to our report
which relied on public documents, showed specific data from primary sources, and
detailed the methodology so others could verify the approach.


We believe we presented compelling evidence using reports and filings prepared by the
company to raise serious questions about AFSI's accounting for intra-company
reinsurance transactions. In our opinion, AFSI is not offering serious answers. We also
find it notable that management did not take questions on the call. Further, despite
arranging the call specifically to respond, management did not criticize our approach other
than by making general statements about unspecified "inaccuracies".


If our analysis was flawed, why didn't management take that opportunity to correct
the record with specifics? Perhaps it was not as easy to do as they would like to
suggest...


We believe AFSI should present actual data from public sources to explain how it
accounts for these entities, as we did. The fact that we arrive at such alarming conclusions
without having heard a plausible explanation from management is highly disconcerting.
After all, the purpose of the company's financial statements is to present a fair picture of
the operations.


AFSI's disclosure that Luxembourg generated "less than $25 million" of profits
actually supports our view
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 11/24


Turning to the conference call, management was adamant that there were no accounting
problems related to their Luxembourg reinsurance captives, but chose not to provide any
specific details other than saying (emphasis added):


"From January 1, 2009 through the first nine months of 2013, the Company has
earned pre-tax profits of approximately $1.1 billion. Less than $25 million of that pre-
tax profit, or just under 2.5%, resulted from the Company's direct operations in
Luxembourg."


Despite AFSI disclosing very little, this meager data point supports our view in light of
other AFSI disclosures and management comments.


Consider the only reference we could find in AFSI's SEC filings regarding the Luxembourg
reinsurance captives' impact on operations, which was in its 2011 10-K (page F-27):


"As a result of these acquisitions (ACHL purchase of reinsurance captives in
Luxembourg) in 2011 and 2010, the Company reduced its acquisition costs and
other underwriting expenses by approximately $23 million in 2011."


AFSI's 2012 10-K (page 68) provides us with an answer which relates to how the
company accounts for deferred tax liabilities. AFSI appears to treat the reversal of
accrued deferred tax liabilities associated with equalization reserves as a negative
operating expense even though it relates to a tax liability!


"Additionally, the use of deferred tax liabilities related to equalization reserves are
netted against related amortization expense and recorded as a decrease to other
underwriting expense. Otherwise, we include changes in deferred income tax
assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense."


We were told by readers that SunTrust made comments in a December 18 note defending
the company ("Reiterate Buy Rating Following Travel with Management") that confirm (1)
AFSI is ceding more losses (expenses) than premiums to Luxembourg captives "by
design" and (2) AFSI records a decline in the DTL as a reduction in operating expenses:
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 12/24


"It is important to know that, by design, the Luxembourg captives should be ceded
more losses than premiums in any given period…


AmTrust does benefit from the drop in its deferred tax liability - established as
part of the original Luxembourg captive acquisition - that flows through the
company's P&L in the form of an offset to operating expenses (emphasis
added)..."


In order for a company's deferred tax liability to "drop" (ie: reverse the accrued liability),
the company has to incur a net loss (incur expenses in excess of revenues). Consider the
owner of a stock with unrealized gains. He has a DTL because if he sells the stock, he will
have to pay taxes. If he continues to hold it, he is deferring the tax liability. However, if the
stock declines, his DTL declines (or goes away) because the taxes he would owe upon
selling the stock declined. In other words, for his accrued DTL to reverse without paying
taxes, he had to incur a loss.


As noted in prior reports, AFSI subsidiaries' Schedule Y indicated AFSI's Luxembourg
operations were incurring net losses as a result of inter-company transactions, which is
corroborated by AFSI's disclosed DTL reversals. However, basic accounting tells us
that DTL reversals are the result of pre-tax losses, so how does management
reconcile DTL reversals and profitable Luxembourg operations?


The combination of disclosures above is, in our view, damning evidence of improper
accounting at AFSI.


In summary, management claimed to have reported profits of "less than $25 million" in
Luxembourg. Then management seems to have told SunTrust analysts that they
intentionally lose money in its wholly-owned Luxembourg captives. So which is it AFSI?


Given the problems AFSI appears to have applying US GAAP, perhaps it shouldn't be
surprising that PricewaterhouseCoopers (subsequently replaced by BDO) noted
deficiencies in MHLD's internal controls for the period that Ron Pipoly (AFSI's CFO)
acted as CFO (MHLD 424B3 filed May 2008, page 10, emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 13/24


"…


In particular, these deficiencies include:


failure to give appropriate consideration to U.S. GAAP accounting rules or
to have documentation of the basis for our opinion and conclusion
regarding the application of U.S. GAAP;
lack of an independent preparer and reviewer for various accounting tasks,
including the preparation of the financial statements and disclosures; and
lack of formality regarding certain controls surrounding the control environment.


…"


Section 3: New Disclosure Supports our View that LSCs are mis-marked


We believe the information management provided on the conference call confirms our
view that life settlement contracts ("LSCs") are mismarked. In an apparent attempt to
discredit our analysis and allay concerns over exposure to Phoenix, management
disclosed a new data point on LSCs on the conference call. However, the data actually
strengthens our conviction regarding the mismarking of LSCs.


In our first report, we discussed how we believed AFSI was using "egregiously aggressive
assumptions relative to peers" despite significant exposure to Phoenix, an issuer shunned
by most LSC investors. In other words, we believed AFSI was either A) not reflecting the
severe discount that Phoenix policies receive in the LSC market and/or B) carrying the
non-Phoenix policies at unjustifiable premiums relative to publicly-listed IFT, whose LSCs
have similar LEs to AFSI.


During the call, CFO Ron Pipoly said:


"Additionally, there have been comments made regarding the portion of our policies
in our life settlement portfolio where Phoenix is the carrier. To be clear, Phoenix
policies represent only 15% of the fair value of our portfolio at September 30, 2013.
Therefore, our net carrying value exposure to Phoenix policy is approximately $20
million. Thank you."


The table below shows that AFSI carries the non-Phoenix policies at approximately 2x the
carrying value IFT applies which has similar LEs and does not own any Phoenix policies.
Until now, it was not possible to provide a true apples-to-apples comparison with other

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 14/24


companies because it was unclear how much value AFSI attributed to the Phoenix
policies. Let's take a look at the implications of this comment:
