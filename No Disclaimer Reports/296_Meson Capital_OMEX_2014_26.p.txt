Oceanica Hits A Wall: Suspended At SEMARNAT Pending More

Summary


According to SEMARNAT website, Oceanica's approval process is now
"SUSPENDED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION".


According to local article, CIBNOR, a Mexican government agency seems to be
asking for many more data points that could take years to collect.


Given OMEX's perilously weak liquidity, delays at Oceanica or HMS Victory could
mean the end, shortly.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s two big projects right now are HMS
Victory and Oceanica. SS Central America is still tied up in the court of appeals so does
not appear to have any prospect for generating cash in the near future. The Odyssey
Explorer is on its way to the UK arriving in 2 weeks according to AIS. Will this be just in
time for an unpleasant surprise change of heart or attack by the actual Admiral Balchen
family? We shall see.


Any shareholder can visit Mexico's SEMARNAT site to see the official progress of OMEX's
application. As a reminder this is the EIA that took many months longer than expected to
collect more data and "vet approval" with local interests, expanding to over 4,000 pages
including appendix.

The final entry entered today is "SUSPENDED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION". Given
that the EIA was so delayed and supposedly pre-vetted this certainly seems odd?


Perhaps it is less surprising when readers consider that the company responsible for
performing the (Oceanica) EIS for the project is QV Gestíon Ambiental, QV Environmental
Management, under the direction of Martín de la Cruz Quijano. Quijano is an ex-
SEMARNAT functionary from SEMARNAT's Environmental Impact and Risk Division.
During his tenure with SEMARNAT, Quijano worked for the controversial director Ricardo
Juarez who was investigated by the Ministry of Public Service and removed from office by
the government of Felipe Calderón.


According to a local article in Mexico, "Don Diego mining project has errors and
omissions: CIBNOR", the cause may be due to a government agency CIBNOR asking for
more information about the project which would include baseline testing and actual
environmental samples being taken as opposed to the theoretical analysis supplied by
OMEX based on dredging in the UK.


CIBNOR (previously CIB - Center for Biological Research) was established in 1975 by the
Government of the State of Baja California Sur and CONACYT [National Council for
Science and Technology] to promote science and technology development in the area.
