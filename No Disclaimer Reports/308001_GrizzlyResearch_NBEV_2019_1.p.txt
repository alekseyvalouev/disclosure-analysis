NBEV Shareholders got Duped in the Morinda 
Transaction 





• In December 2018, New Age Beverage 
(NASDAQ:NBEV) competed its merger with multi-
level firm (MLM), Morinda, to help reverse losses 
NBEV has sustained since completing its reverse 
merger in 2016.  NBEV Paid Morinda $75 million in 
cash and $10 million in stock to complete the 
transaction. 


• While Morinda reported 2016 revenue from China 


of $68m in 2016, SAIC filings show that real 


revenue of Morinda was only $33m in that year! 


• Financial filings from China also show that Morinda 


had a big net loss of $32m in 2017 from its China 


operations. 


• National filings show that Morinda’s European 
operations gave up their headquarters in 2017 and 
was in the process of winding down the company. 
The winding down process was expected to be 
completed less than three months of the 
completion of the merger. 


• NBEV’s CEO boosts that $46 million in cash came 
along with Morinda. However, we don’t believe 
investors clearly understand that over $50 million 
will have to be paid out to Morinda shareholders.  


• In short, we believe NBEV got duped by buying a 
dying business with inflated financials. 


• We believe that Morinda’s China business is in 
jeopardy of being totally shut down, supporting our 
conclusion that any growth Morinda is claiming it has experienced in China, or

that NBEV is expecting to realize from China is in the rear-view mirror and 
irrelevant.  


• Our research combined with our on-the-ground research proves that Morinda 
is conducting illegal MLM operations in the majority of China provinces/cities 
that it operates in.  Specifically, it is doing business in regions where it does 
not have a direct selling license to operate in. 


• The number of MLM companies that China regulators have forced to suspend 
their China operations, now stands at 5 in 2019, including $NHTC. Morinda’s 
Primary product (90% of sales), appears to have the similar Chinese name of 
the product that was the subject of a China Central Television (CCTV) scathing 
2019 expose on NHTC. 


• We believe NBEV’s CEO is highly promotional, but has proven to be unable to 
successfully build companies for extended periods of time, as evidenced by 
the two previous public companies he was the CEO of that ended badly for 
shareholders.   


• A shady auditor and a lack of checks and balances set NBEV up for failure 


• We believe the stock will collapse and see immediate downside of 60% 
 


Introduction 
 


New Age Beverage Co. (NASDAQ:NBEV) is a manufacturer and distributor of beverages. We believe 


NBEV's recently closed merger with a multi-level marketing (MLM) company, Morinda, for $85 million 


will be a disaster for NBEV shareholders. We see immediate downside of at least 60%. But we believe 


the picture will get much worse, leading to a scenario where NBEV will become insolvent. NBEV lost $12 


million in 2018, but it appears that management is expecting that the addition of Morinda will change 


that.  Management has clearly stated that the Morinda transaction will be a transformational event for 


the company: 





CFO:  


" Clearly, the financial combination is transformative for New Age, and we believe the level of 


acceleration from the transaction for shareholders will be outstanding. " 





CEO 


" Now we should start to see why Morinda makes so much sense for us, especially from our 


CBD-infused beverage portfolio and the Health Sciences Division." 





" So clearly Morinda brings the attractive financial implication, organizational underpinning and 


strengthening,"
3 





While it appears on paper that NBEV executed a "too good to be true" deal by thinking it paid less than 


0.5 times 2017 sales (as well as the 2018 implied revenue run-rate at the time of the transaction) for a 


seemingly profitable company, we will show why we believe Morinda is not as advertised. For example, 


we found that Morinda's European operations are in the process of being wound down and that 


Morinda sold itself to NBEV just months after it was expected to formally close all European corporate 


matters.  





Furthermore, while during a conference call, NBEV’s CEO boasts about $46 million in cash & cash 


equivalents that came with the Morinda merger, he failed to comment that over $50 million in 


contractional obligations are owed to Morinda shareholders.  





Most importantly, Morinda derives a substantial amount of its revenues from its China MLM business. 


Knowing this, we deployed our on the ground team in China to find out two things: 





1. Does the company have the licenses as an MLM business to operate in the China provinces in 


which it sells its products?  


2. Are Morinda’s financials that were disclosed to NBEV and shareholders in SEC filings accurate? 





The answers to these two questions are why we are short the stock. 





Inadequate Licenses 





Regarding its China business, we found that Morinda is operating illegally in 60% of the provinces it is 


running its business in. This is a very important point. The regulatory framework in China on this matter 


is so strict that just the mere fact that a company would have an office in a particular province that it 


does not have a license to operate in is a violation. There was a time when this kind of evidence would 


not be a big deal and thought of as boilerplate. However, it's no secret that China is finally cracking 


down on illegal MLM activity.  





In early 2019, China regulators forced Natural Health Trends Corp. (NASDAQ: NHTC) to suspend its 


operations in China, shortly after China Central Television (CCTV) aired a critical report on the company. 


Shares fell as much as 32% on the day the story aired and are now down around 60%. Interestingly, 


Morinda’s primary product (90% of sales), appears to have the similar Chinese name of the product that 


was the subject of a China Central Television (CCTV) scathing 2019 expose on NHTC. 





We are still waiting for China regulators to release its “blacklist” of untrustworthy  MLM companies and 


participants operating in China. We believe there is a high probability that Morinda or its main operating 


entity in China, Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd., will be on this list. Regardless, we believe that
4 


the crackdown on NHTC along with the bad press on Noni Juice cannot be good for Morinda’s near-term 


sales prospects.  


What we do know is that China regulators were reported to have suspended  handing out any new 


licenses amid a nationwide crackdown on wrongdoing in the health products market. Thus, even if 


Morinda were still permitted to operate its China business, it appears that it would need to at least 


cease operations in 6 out the 10 provinces/cities it currently operates in. 





So far, according to numerous reports in China, Chinese regulators have tried to crack down at least 4 


big scale  MLM companies with direct-selling licenses in China -  Hualin Group (report link), Quanjian 


Group (report link), Infinitus (China) (report link), and Tianshi Group (report link). Arrests have already 


been made in some cases. 





Overstated Financials 





Like has been done numerous times in the past with regards to uncovering discrepancies between 


financial information recorded in China and SEC filings, our evidence reveals that Morinda’s financials 


that were disclosed in SEC filings are meaningfully higher than what were reported in China. In 


Morinda’s, case, we estimate that Morinda’s revenues from China are inflated by 36% in 2017 and 51% 


in 2016. 





Game Set Match 





From whatever perspective we look at NBEV, any of the two China related issues will wipe away the 


profit contribution NBEV had hoped to realize from Morinda. The research we're about to present to 


you is brand new and has not been touched upon in other short thesis reports written about the 


company.  We believe the Morinda issues we have highlighted will soon become evident, serving as THE 


catalyst to send shares sharply lower, with the company ultimately experiencing the same fate previous 


companies run by NBEV's CEO have met. 





Under the helm of CEO Brent Willis, NBEV has engaged in an aggressive roll-up strategy fueled by a 


series of equity raises where shares outstanding have risen more than 100% to 75 million shares. 


Morinda is the sixth transaction (including its initial reverse merger) that NBEV has made since 


completing a reverse merger to go public in 2016. While we are doubtful about a roll-up strategy that 


has resulted in cumulative negative operating cash flows of $17.8 million since it became a public 


company in 2016, racking up losses every year.  Morinda is NBEV’s biggest transaction to date, and the 


one that we think will break the camel’s back.   





The evidence we collected leans on our expertise of performing on-the-ground due diligence in China to 


bring transparency to U.S. investors that invest in China based companies or companies doing business 


in China.

NBEV’s CEO recently sold 300,000 shares, netting him proceeds of $1.6 million, and we think we know 


why. 


Some Background on Morinda 
 


Morinda is a multilevel marketing company. Founded in 1996, Morinda sells various health products, but 


90% of its revenue is generated from its Tahitian Noni Juice product. While 


the juice is portrayed to have several health benefits, none were ever 


substantiated in scientific studies. This didn’t stop Morinda from making 


bold claims about its products in order to recruit more people into their 


multi-level marketing structure. From the very beginnings, Morinda had 


run ins with the law.  





As early as 1998, Morinda was charged by multiple states and settled for 


making bold claims regarding its Tahitian Noni juice including treating, 


curing, or preventing numerous diseases such as diabetes, depression, 


hemorrhoids and arthritis. As part of the settlement, Morinda had to 


refrain from making unfounded health claims about its products.  





Similar to other multi-level marketing companies with a mediocre product, 


Morinda soon sought international expansion until it merged with NBEV in 


2018.  





More To The Morinda Transaction Than Meets The Eye 
 


China Financials don’t add up 





Referencing SEC disclosures, Morinda’s financials through the first nine months of 2018, ended 


September 31: 


• sales were $177.4 million, which works out to be $236.5 million on an annualized basis 


• adjusted net income was $7.7 million ($10.3 million annualized) and  


• operating cash flow was $6.1 million ($8.1 million annualized)  


Combined with NBEV’s 2018 revenue of $52 million, NBEV revenue would be tracking at annual run-rate 


of $280 million. We can understand why investors got interested in the stock – In 2018, NBEV only 


produced revenues of $52 million,  a net loss of $12 million and negative operating cash flow of $21.8 


million.  At an $85 million total consideration, the Morinda transaction seemed like a steal. $75 million 


was paid in cash which was previously raised in a November 2018 secondary offering,.  





The Morinda merger seemed almost too good to be true. 





Morinda’s second biggest market by revenue is China. According to NBEV’s CEO, Brent Willis, Morinda is

experiencing great success:  





“That business has grown about 20% per year and eclipsed -- this year it eclipsed more than $80 


million in revenue, and that's one of the overall growth engines for the overall company” 


(Morinda CC Call 12/4/2018) 





NBEV’s 8K/A filed on 03/01/2019 provides more color on Morinda’s financials. According to these filings, 


China made up approximately 35% and 30% of overall sales for the nine-month periods ended 


September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Notably, China is also where Morinda’s biggest cash balance 


is allegedly sitting, totaling over $20 million as of September 2018.  





We have our on the ground team in China to pull financial filings on Morinda from the State 


Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). SAIC filings have proven to be a one of the primary 


tools to discovering fraud in China.  





In China, Morinda has been operating through two entities named Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., 


Ltd. Rongchang Factory, and Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd. (大溪地诺丽饮料(中国)有限公司


荣昌工厂 and 大溪地诺丽饮料(中国)有限公司 respectively). Rongchang Factory is where the Noni 


juice is processed, and Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) is the main operating entity of Morinda in China. 





The financials we sourced from SAIC filings in China showed staggering differences: 





 SEC Filings*  SAIC Filings  


 2016 2017 2016 2017 


Revenue $68,156,000 $68,746,000 $33,009,000 $43,837,000 


Net Income $2,877,000 $3,600,000 -$18,096,000 -$32,135,000 


*assumes China was 30% of revenue in both years. Assumes China profitability is 30% of  Morinda’s total profitability.. 








The deviations are staggering. When compared to SEC filings, Morinda’s revenue disclosed in SEC filings 


are inflated by 51% and 36% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  





Another thing that strikes us as remarkable is how unprofitable China operations are according to SAIC 


filings, with a combined net loss of $32m in 2017. We wonder how the overall company can show $12m 


in net profit when China alone lost $32m.  


Even if you want to ignore our SAIC analysis and put faith in NBEV’s SEC filings, things are not looking 


good for its legacy business and/or Morinda.  According to SEC filings, NBEV lost $12.1 million on a GAAP 


basis in 2018 and $15.8 million after adjusting for a tax gain, one time gains/losses and non-cash items.  


On May 9, 2019 NBEV reported 2019 Q1 financial results which showed that the company is still 


bleeding money, even after including the contribution of one full quarter of Morinda. NBEV lost $1.6 



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000165495419002177/0001654954-19-002177-index.htm
7 


million on a GAAP basis and $5.3 million after adjustments.  The Q1 press release fails to mention that 


NBEV’s legacy business is falling sharply, contracting 13% in Q1.  Furthermore, the highly touted Marley 


brand assets, acquired in June 2017, is already facing challenges: 





“Net revenue for the New Age segment decreased by 13% from $11.6 million for the three 


months ended March 31, 2018 to $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The 


decrease in net revenue for the New Age segment was primarily attributable to an increase in 


discounts and allowances of $0.9 million which was driven by the increase in billbacks and 


discounts from two of our major distributors where we were impacted by significant charges on 


shipments we shorted because of our inventory challenges, and we faced a high level of 


changeover charges related to one of the products in the Coco-Libre brand and one of the 


products in the Marley brand which we are discontinuing to focus on products with higher 


future sales potential.” - 2019 Q1 SEC filing 





Also, even the SEC filings, which we believe are inflated, show that Morinda’s revenue growth has 


stagnated, while its net income and operating cashflow are contracting.  





Finally, based on NBEV 2019 Q1 financial results, which broke out Morinda’s revenue contribution, 


Morinda generated revenue of $48.2 million, implying an annualized run-rate of $192.9 million.  


Any way you slice it, it looks like NBEV bought Morinda at the peak of its growth cycle and that Morinda 


is not on track to eliminate the losses NBEV is experiencing.  But, we think it’s about to get much worse.  








Filings show Morinda is operating illegally 6 out of 10 Provinces/Cities 





According to the website of Ministry of Commerce in China, Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd. (大


溪地诺丽饮料(中国)有限公司) obtained its direct-selling license approval in December 2014. 


According to the website, the registered service locations of Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd. (大


溪地诺丽饮料(中国)有限公司) are in the following regions (please refer to Appendix 2 for detailed 


service locations in each region): 


• City of Chongqing  


• City of Shenyang, Liaoning Province  


• Cities of Jinan, Weihai, Rongcheng and Rushan, Shandong Province  



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000165495419005484/nbev_10q.htm

http://zxgl.mofcom.gov.cn/front/getEnterprises
8 


• City of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province  


However, the SAIC records (Appendix 3) show that the company has branches in other regions that are 


not among the above list. For example, those regions are: 


• City of Beijing 


• City of Shanghai 


• City of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 


• City of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province 


• City of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province 


• City of Fuzhou, Fujian Province 


One note to clarify for the regions regarding provinces and cities in this case is that, in China, there are 4 


cities that are on the same governmental administration level as provinces, and they are the cities of 


Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Thus, when we put “provinces/cities” together, the “cities” 


within this context are referring to these 4 cities.  





On the conference call, Brent Willis confirms that Morinda conducts business in 10 provinces: 





“The company has already got offices in at least 10 different provinces and a major organization 


really focused in those 10 provinces” 





In other words, the company has opened branches and has probably done business in cities that are not 


registered & approved by the government, which should be considered a violation of the rules for 


direct-selling in China. Regardless, the mere fact of setting up an office in an unapproved province is a 


violation. 





Our On-The-Ground Due Diligence (OTGDD) Confirms Illegal Activities 





Our on the ground due diligence confirms our suspicions. Our on the ground team visited 


branches/offices in the city of Shanghai, city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and the city of Nanjing, 


Jiangsu Province. Remember, these are offices in jurisdictions where Morinda does not have registered 


service locations and is not allowed to conduct direct selling businesses and sell products in any manner.  





During the investigation, except for one office in city of Shanghai that appeared to be occupied by 


another company other than Morinda or Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd., the rest of the 


offices/branches our on the ground team visited seem to be in operation during normal business hours 


in China.  





Furthermore, our on the ground team was told by sales people in one of the branches in city of Shanghai 


that people interested in the products could place orders at that branch and they needed to fill out their 


personal information and mailing addresses so that products could be delivered to the buyers. In
9 


another branch during the visit, our on the ground team was told that an order could be placed online. 


All these branches/offices that our on the ground team visited are not within the list of the service 


locations that are registered on the Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s direct-selling industry management 


website. Thus, we believe that this is in clear violation to the direct-selling rules in China. Below are 


some of pictures at each of the branches/offices we visited. 








1. Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd Shanghai Jing'an Branch (void of license) 


Address: Nanjing West Rd. No.819, Room 1009-1011, Jing'an District, City of Shanghai, China
10 





2. Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd Shanghai Branch (void of license) 


Address: Tibet Middle Rd. No.18, 12th Floor, Room 1403-1405, Huangpu District, City of Shanghai, China 














3. Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd Shanghai Office  


Address: Zhaojia Bang Rd. No.789, 12th Floor, Room A, City of Shanghai, China
11 





It is found that this address was actually occupied by a biotech company called Fuent Biotechnology 


(Shanghai) Co., Ltd.

4. Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd Jiangsu Branch (void of license) 


Address: Changjiang Rd. No.188, 15th Floor, Room D, Xuanwu District, City of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 


China 











5. Tahitian Noni Beverage (China) Co., Ltd Zhejiang Branch (void of license) 


Address: Zhaohui Rd. No.203, Room 1001&1002, Xiacheng District, City of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province
13 








One possible outcome of Morinda doing business in locations that are not registered by the government 


is that the company runs into big risk of being added into the blacklist of untrustworthy direct selling 


companies, which could be detrimental to the company’s operating business in China. According to an 


article published by Caixin global in February 2019: 


 



https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-02-15/china-suspends-registration-of-direct-selling-firms-101379899.html
14 


Chinese authorities suspended the registration and approval of direct selling amid a nationwide 


crackdown on wrongdoing in the health products market. 





The Ministry of Commerce will establish a “blacklist” of untrustworthy direct selling companies 


and participants, ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said Thursday at a routine press conference. 


…… 


Gao said the Ministry of Commerce would conduct a thorough, nationwide sweep of the direct 


selling industry and will take actions against any illegal businesses. 





The article stated that “the Chinese authorities suspended the registration and approval of direct selling 


amid a nationwide crackdown on wrongdoing in the health products market”, and this means Morinda 


and other direct-selling companies in China are not expected to increase their presence in 


cities/provinces any time soon.  





Another recent case that comes to mind is Natural Health Trends Corp (NHTC) 





How NBEV is linked to Natural Health Trends Corp (NHTC) 





Natural Health Trends Corp (NHTC) is a NASDAQ listed company, with their main business involved in 


direct selling to consumers in China. Similar to Morinda, NHTC also operates through multi-level 


marketing arrangements.  


NHTC saw its stock price plummet from over $20 per share to less than $8 per after negative news 


coverage in China. 





On January 5, 2019, CCTV Channel 13 (China Central Television is the predominant state television 


broadcaster in China) aired an 18 minute program that alleged NHTC was a pyramid scheme in China. 


The program interviewed former NHTC members who subsequently lost money or saw their lives reach 


points of turmoil, including divorce, as a result. 


The program also aired conversations where senior members of the company exaggerated the effects of 


the company’s products, including one called Noni Juice (with full name of Premium Noni Juice in 


English). According to the program, NHTC’s Noni Juice does not have domestic approval and 


registrations related to wellness foods. 


An investor with the Twitter handle @unemon1, who runs a website at http://www.unemon.com/, 


covered the NHTC case excellently.  


One thing investors may not have noticed is that Morinda’s primary product is also named Noni Juice 


(the full Chinese name is 大溪地诺丽牌大溪地诺丽加蓝莓果汁, which can be translated to Tahitian 


Noni Brand Tahitian Noni Plus Blueberry Juice). And both of the “Noni Juices” have the same Chinese 


characters of “诺丽果汁” as their product name. Why is this important? Because the CCTV program 


made the "诺丽果汁” very well known (in a bad way) during their NHTC coverage. And the fact that 



https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1621819555282197155

http://www.unemon.com/
15 


Morinda’s main product is sold in China under the same Chinese name (in short) as NHTC’s product 


could make the customers/members hesitant or even unable to purchase or promote Noni juice, thus 


hurting Morinda’s business prospects in China substantially.  This is the exact scenario that played out in 


the case of NHTC. 


Like most multi-level marketing businesses, Morinda heavily relies on the public perception of its 


product and its ability to recruit more people into the system.  


We interviewed an industry expert who maintained close relationships with senior members of NHTC 


and our suspicions were confirmed: People are currently very skeptical of the product Noni juice and it 


has become increasingly harder to convince people to purchase or resell the product in China.  





Additional Evidence that Morinda is operating illegally in China 





People might argue that Morinda, as opposed to NHTC, obtained a direct selling license in China. 


However, having a direct-selling license does not prevent scrutiny and even a crack down from the 


regulators in China. For example, Chinese regulators have tried to crack down on at least 4 big-scale 


MLM companies with direct-selling licenses. Those companies are Hualin Group, Quanjian Group, 


Infinitus (China), and Tianshi Group.  





We found the following report in China, published in 2018, that had strong allegations regarding 


Morinda’s business conduct. Below are excerpts from this report, followed by their English translations 


(paraphrased) accordingly: 


“……大溪地却涉嫌跨区域直销、超范围销售产品的违法违规行为，同时其采用的奖金制度也


涉嫌多层次计酬。” 


……Tahitian [Noni] is suspected to conduct direct-selling business and sell products in areas that 


are not allowed by the rules, and in the meantime the reward compensation system is suspected 


as calculating compensation in multiple levels.  


“根据中国消费者报 2017年 3月 15日的报道，“大溪地诺丽饮料(中国)有限公司在国内热土


上辛勤耕耘直销业务，版图迅猛扩张，已在北京、山西、山东、辽宁、上海、浙江、江苏、


福建、广东、重庆设立了分公司。” 


According to the China Consumer News report on March 15, 2017, “Tahitian Noni Beverages 


(China) Co., Ltd has been developing its direct-selling business and expanding its geographic areas, 


and [it has] set up branches in Beijing, Shanxi Province, Shandong Province, Liaoning Province, 


Shanghai, Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu Province, Fujian Province, Guangdong Province, and 


Chongqing.” 



http://finance.ce.cn/rolling/201803/02/t20180302_28323449.shtml

“然而第一直销网查询商务部直销行业管理信息系统发现，大溪地诺丽的分支机构只有四


个，分别是辽宁、山东、广东、重庆。而上述报道中，大溪地诺丽已经在十个省市设立了分


公司。” 


However, according to zhixiao001.com’s findings from China’s Ministry of Commerce direct-selling 


industry management information system, there are only 4 branches for Tahitian Noni, and they 


are Liaoning Province, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province, and Chongqing. But according to 


the China Consumer News report, Tahitian Noni has already set up branches in 10 provinces/cities. 


“这明显违背了《直销管理条例》的规定：直销企业从事直销活动，必须在拟从事直销活动


的省、自治区、直辖市设立负责该行政区域内直销业务的分支机构。商务部直销行业管理信


息系统也明示，直销企业的直销地区以信息系统查询为准，未经审核公布的地区不得开展直


销业务。” 


This is an obvious violation to the <Direct-selling Management Rules>: Direct-selling companies 


that conduct direct-selling activities must set up the branches in the designated provinces, 


autonomous regions, or municipalities directly under the central government. The Ministry of 


Commerce direct-selling industry management information system also clearly shows that direct-


selling companies’ designated regions should be based on the information system search, and they 


shall not conduct direct-selling business in the regions that are not reviewed and approved [by the 


Ministry of Commerce].  


  …… 


“公开资料显示，根据大溪地诺丽公司的奖金制度，二级特约经销商赚取佣金可至八层，一


级特约经销商赚取佣金七层，特约经销商赚取佣金六层，优惠顾客赚取四层佣金，达到 40


箱的优惠顾客赚取五层佣金。每月超过一箱部分有 20%的佣金。此外，经销商还能获得其它

Public information shows that, according to Tahitian Noni’s compensation system, second tier 


special distributor’s earned commission could be 8 levels, and first tier special distributor’s earned 


commission could be 7 levels, and special distributor’s earned commission could be 6 levels, 


discounted customer could make 4-level commission, and discounted customer who reached 40 


boxes could make 5-level commission. Every month over 1 box people could have 20% 


commission. In addition, distributors could also obtain other dividends, advancing bonuses, 


wholesale bonuses, etc. 


“《直销管理条例》第二十四条规定，直销企业支付给直销员的报酬只能按照直销员本人直


接向消费者销售产品的收入计算。如此看来，大溪地诺丽的佣金抽成最多的已经达到八层，


显然不符合规定，涉嫌多层次计酬。”

No.24 of the <Direct-selling Management Rules> says that, the compensation that direct-selling 


companies pay to their sales people should be based on the revenues generated from the products 


sales people sell to the consumers. Whereas Tahitian Noni’s commission reaches up to 8 levels, 


which is obviously not abiding by the rule and suspected as a multiple-level compensation 


calculation.  
 





Morinda’s European Operations just Closed Down 
 


Another aspect of Morinda struck us as particular. When we looked into its European operations, we 


found a business that was in the process of winding down. We obtained the financial records for 


Morinda UK Ltd. This entity consolidates all European operations of Morinda: 





“Morinda Uk Limited (“the Company”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Morinda Inc., a US 


company. The Company served as a regional headquarters and principal company for Europe 


and also directly operates a foreign branch in Russia and all the results of this branch are 


included within these financial statements.” 





However, the company was in the process of entirely winding down operations.  





“In July 2016, the Company’s office in London was closed in connection with worldwide group 


restructuring efforts to reduce loss-making activities. Effective December 1, 2016, the Company 


ceased it’s primary trading activities. The Company is now in the process of winding down its 


affairs will continue to wind down during the course of 2017. It is expected that all final 


corporate matters will be formally resolved by September 30, 2018”  





Remember that Morinda sold itself to NBEV in December 2018, just months after it was supposed to 


formally resolve all European corporate matters.  





The European filings also paint the picture of a hugely unprofitable company, citing this as the reason 


why the company has to wind down. The financials confirm this, as Morinda UK lost over £1 million on 


slightly over £14 million of revenue in 2016. We actually did not find a single Morinda entity that 


showed positive net income. However, SEC filings disclose that Morinda reported over $11m in net 


income in 2017. Something is clearly off.  





European filings strengthen our opinion that Morinda is not a thriving business, but is indeed falling 


apart on many fronts. This is contrary to news NBEV has issued about expanding in Europe: 





On May 16th 2019 and on January 30th 2019 NBEV, issued a press releases announcing the roll out of a 


new Noni Collagen product. Amongst other things, NBEV mentions:  


 



https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03779125/filing-history
18 


“Plans in place to rollout in Europe, Latin American, and other Asia Pacific markets throughout 


2019”.  





In light of the European filings we uncovered, we are highly suspicious of Morinda’s product roll-outs in 


Europe.  





We also encourage readers to look into web traffic statistics, which overall paint the picture of a 


declining company. Morinda.com saw its daily traffic declining from a high of almost 900,000 to 


currently around 100,000.  











Hidden Liabilities in the Morinda Transaction 
 


Although CEO Brent Willis stated on the conference that Morinda had $46m in cash and cash 


equivalents at the closing of the transaction by NBEV, he failed to mention the >$50 million in 


contractional obligations owed to Morinda shareholders. These were disclosed much later in the 8K/A 


filed on 03/01/2019.  


 



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000165495419002177/0001654954-19-002177-index.htm
19 








The $25m payment due upon a financing event is noteworthy. NBEV notes that: 





“The Company believes it is probable that this event will occur in the second quarter of 2019.”  





We view this as a lack of transparency towards NBEV shareholders when a big cash balance is discussed 


on the conference call, but big liability items are simply disregarded. 





Another shady aspect that increases profits to Morinda insiders is an old Executive Compensation plan. 


This unfunded plan was established by Morinda in 2009 and all “financial performance targets” under 


the plan were achieved as of December 31, 2018, and a long-term liability of $4.1 million was acquired 


with Morinda. After the executives retire, the deferred compensation obligation is payable over a period 


up to 20 years.  





Remember that the biggest portion (about half) of Morinda’s cash is supposedly sitting in China, and we 


have previously laid out why we believe Morinda’s China financials are not to be trusted.  





Investors beware! In our experience, liabilities tend to almost always be real, but not the assets.  





Are Auditors just bad or Complicit? 





It has been repeatedly noted that issues relating to information access remain a key hurdle for outside 


investors in China. Top 10 auditors, all the way down to lower quality auditors, continue to be duped by 


Chinese companies.   Still, it’s hard for us to believe that auditors are unable to detect some of the type 


of fraud that firms like ours can expertly identify.  We can only assume that they just don’t care.  





You might be wondering who signed off on all these fake financials. Utah based Deloitte & Touche LLP 


verified the financial statements of Morinda, Inc. and NBEV’s auditor has been Accell Audit & 


Compliance, P.A. since 2016.  





Accell Audit & Compliance is a small Florida based firm with only 8 clients. Their PCOAB report outlines 


significant deficiencies as the firm-issued reports without yet having obtained sufficient evidence to 



https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other

https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Documents/104-2017-028-Accell.pdf
20 


support their opinions.  Deloitte seems to find itself on the wrong end of many international scandals 


this year: for example, the Malaysia fine the South China Morning Post reported, and the $8.0 million 


fine Deloitte had to pay in Brazil.  





It is interesting to find big divergences between Chinese and US filings, but this challenge is not new to 


auditors. It has been repeatedly noted that issues relating to information access remains a key hurdle 


for outside investors in China. We have not found indications of outright wrongdoing from the auditors. 


Frankly, we simply believe they are not in a position to detect this kind of fraud. For a fraudulent 


company, it just seems easiest to hide fake financials in China; For example, a $20m cash balance that 


does not exist…  





A few Words regarding the CBD Hype 
 


Marley deal is terrible 





NBEV’s CBD related licensing deal with the Marley brand has terribly economics for NBEV. NBEV ends up 


paying 50% of revenue for the licensing deal, yet our research indicates that standard rates for this 


industry are around 25%. It will be hard to turn a profit on such unfavorable economics. However, on 


June 20th 2019 NBEV announced that the Marley licensing deal would be extended globally.  





CBD Products in the News 





• NBEV announced that they will be selling CBD beverages in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and 


Michigan starting in March 2019.  On Fox Business News CEO Brent Willis said that people can 


already buy these CBD drinks in certain stores and soon in the 4 states. 





• Their press release from January 2019 claims “pharmaceutical grade CBD”. 





• Is CBD in food legal? In short, probably not.  After the Farm bill was passed, the FDA posted a 


memo that said putting CBD in food is not legal, if moved intrastate.  It is unclear if the FDA is 


allowing CBD in food within the cannabis legal states. 





• We note that under the FD&C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like CBD into food. 


Our research indicates that Michigan (one of NBEV’s target states), will default to FDA rules. 


California also defaults to FDA rules (no CBD in food) 





• Bruce Linton, the CEO of Canopy Growth acknowledged in a recent interview on CNBC’s Mad 


Money that the FDA has been clear that food including CBD it is not ready for human 


consumption.

We also believe that investors might be vastly overestimating near term potential from CBD infused 


drinks. Through channel checks, we have found that currently the largest, most established US 


distributor of sparkling CBD beverages (in 16 states), Sprig, is making <$15 million in revenue. In light of 


New Age’s 50/50 profit share on Marley infused products, we believe there will be minimal impact to GP 


even if NBEV matches sales of the current market leader, Sprig. 





Highly Promotional CEO with a History of Business Failures  
 


CEO Brent Willis had allegations of being highly promotional, and has been involved in multiple public 


companies that failed. Some have even considered them to be pump-and-dump schemes.   





Willis’ track record for running public companies has not been impressive prior to NBEV. He served as 


Executive Chairman the IPO of XFit Brands (XFITB) during its decline from $1.10 per share to currently 


less than 1 cent per share.  





Even more spectacular was the failure of Electronics Cigarettes International Group, Ltd. (currently 


ECIGQ). Brent Willis was CEO from 2013 until 2015, and in 2017 the company finally filed for bankruptcy.  





Brent Willis is also currently Chief Operating Officer of Voyageur Minerals, a TSX traded exploration 


stage mining company that currently sports a stock price of CAD 0.06. 





We see a pattern of Brent Willis getting involved in the latest hot business ventures that seem to sell on 


Wall Street (E-Cigarettes, CBD Drinks) that temporarily reach a high market capitalization. But the 


ultimate outcome seems always the same for shareholders: A near complete loss of their capital. 





Executive Compensation and Insider Selling is Accelerating 
 


NBEV had some juicy salary increases beginning 2019. Brent Willis’ base salary more than doubled from 


$312,500 to $650,000. CFO Gregory Gould also saw his base salary double to $500,000 per year.   





Insiders have also been selling their shares. Form 4 filings from April 2019 show Brent Willis locked in 


over $1.6 million by disposing of a 300,000 NBEV shares. This has been the biggest insider sale for years. 


Did Brent Willis start to realize that something is substantially wrong with the Morinda transaction?  





Dilution & Cash Burning Machine 
 


NBEV’s transaction spree has been largely fueled by continuous equity raises. The company more than 


doubled its share count in 2018 from 35m shares to over currently over 75m shares.  


This is not the end of it, as NBEV has filed a new registration statement to sell an additional 18m shares.  



https://twitter.com/elkwood66/status/1088150646853902336

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000165495419005064/nbev_424b5.htm
22 





A key problem we see with this strategy is that NBEV’s roll-up has resulted in a company that is 


notoriously unprofitable and does not generate cash flow. In other words, NBEV is reliant on equity 


raises to keep the business afloat.  








We uncovered what we believe may have been fraud in NBEV’s biggest transaction to date. This does 


not only warrant scrutiny on Morinda itself, but also on NBEV’s overall strategy. We believe that once 


investors and stakeholders start to understand the truth about Morinda, NBEV will have a harder time 


approaching the public market for equity investments.  





The company conducted numerous equity financings in 2018. According to its 2018 10K, it had 4 equity 


raises throughout 2018: 





 
Number of Shares Gross Proceeds Average Price 


April 2018 Offering 2,560 $4,480 $1.75 


August 2018 Offering 9,200 $11,776 $1.28 


ATM Offering - September 2018 8,089 $37,533 $4.64 


November 2018 Offering 14,835 $51,922 $3.50 


Total 34,684 $105,711 $3.05 





It seems like the majority of the money raised, was used  to fund the Morinda transaction.  



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000165495419003847/nbev_10k.htm
23 








However, it appears that there is no sign of stopping on the equity financing front, even after Morinda. 


On April 30, 2019, NBEV entered into a sales agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, to sell up to 


$100m worth of shares of the company’s common stock for an “at the market offering” (ATM offering). 


Wikipedia explains: 





An at-the-market (ATM) offering is a type of follow-on offering of stock utilized by publicly 


traded companies in order to raise capital over time. In an ATM offering, exchange-listed 


companies incrementally sell newly issued shares into the secondary trading market through a 


designated broker-dealer at prevailing market prices. 





NBEV completed an ATM offering in 2018, when the stock was offered at an average price of about 


$4.64 per share, for an aggregate of about $37.5 million. However, since the offering price is not fixed 


on ATM offering, and if NBEV is really fleeced in the Morinda transaction and will not do well in the 


coming future as we predict, the ATM offering could cause much more dilution than investors 


anticipated. For example, at current price of $4.50 a share, a $100m offering at this price would result in 


22.2 million new shares, but if the stock price is $3.50, then the newly issued shares would amount to 


28.5 million. It woud be 50 million shares at an average price of $2.00, and 66.7 million shares at an 


average price of $1.50.  





 
$100 million ATM common stock offering 


Average issuing price   @$4.50   @$3.50   @$2.50   @$2.00   @$1.50

Potential dilution to shareholders1 29.5% 37.9% 53.1% 66.3% 88.4% 


note 1: dilution was calculated based on 75.393 million common stocks outstanding as of May 6, 2019 


according to the company’s most recent 10Q 





Conclusion 
 


We have laid out our case for why we believe Morinda’s financials that were presented to the SEC and 


NBEV shareholders can simply not be relied upon. This report once again proves that the times of the 


“China Hustle” are long from over. The opaqueness and issues relating to information access still leave 


plenty of room to defraud US investors. Therefore, it has been our mantra that enhanced scrutiny is 


warranted when dealing with companies that conduct a substantial part of their operations in China. We 


can only conclude that NBEV management seemingly failed to conduct the necessary due diligence.  





We believe investors and other stakeholders will start to share our negative opinion about Morinda and 


rightfully lose faith in NBEV’s roll-up strategy. Accounting issues, financial restatements, or worse could 


lay ahead.  A key problem for NBEV is that the company needs equity raises to keep its current business

afloat, and might have to conduct these at inopportune times under toxic terms. We set our 


intermediate price target at $2.00 but believe that in the long run, NBEV shareholders will ultimately 


meet the same fate as the investors in Brent Willis’ previous public companies: A near total loss of their 


capital.
