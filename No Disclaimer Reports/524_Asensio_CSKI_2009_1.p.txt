asensio.com initiates coverage on China Sky One
Medical, Inc.


Posted on April 17, 2009 by Asensio.com


asensio.com, located at www.asensio.com, America’s oldest and


most accomplished short selling advocacy website, today initiated


coverage on shares of China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI).


Two reports have been issued today on asensio.com regarding


China Sky. China Sky is a US-listed Chinese company claiming to sell


over-the-counter pharmaceutical products based on traditional


Chinese medicine, such as a weight-loss patch and hemorrhoid


ointment, and also claiming to be conducting research on cancer


treatments and stem cells.


“Are China Sky’s Financials Believable?” is the first report. It details


the many problems China Sky has had with its auditors, and some


of the problems apparent with the company’s corporate


governance.


The second report, “A Small Taste of China Sky’s Erroneous


Numbers” shows what seems to be an unbelievable mistake in


China Sky’s reported EPS.


asensio.com was originally launched in 1996 as the official website


of Asensio & Company, Inc., which to this date remains the only


FINRA and Securities and Exchange Commission registered


investment bank ever to have operated as a dedicated short selling


organization.
