          “I reckon if you peeled back the layers on Aussie corporates with arrogant, young teams and a win at all costs 


culture you’d see a lot of the same characteristics.”                -  Elaine Stead, Head of Blue Sky Venture Capital 






































On March 28, 2018, we published our investment opinion (the “Report”) on Blue Sky Alternative Investments Limited 


(ASX: BLA) (“Blue Sky” or the “Company”), an Australian fund manager with a purported $3.9 billion of fee earning 


assets under management (“AUM”).  On April 3, Blue Sky issued a response (the “Response”). 





Rather than address our Report on its merits, Blue Sky has doubled down on obfuscating simple details about its 


business.  Instead of transparency, Blue Sky has fallen back on threats and recriminations.  We simply do not see how 


investors can have any confidence in a Blue Sky management team that cannot answer basic questions about its fee 


structure, AUM and historic performance.   





Time and again, Blue Sky insists that we are incorrect, without providing any substantive rebuttal, analysis or 


calculations showing why we are wrong.  Rather, Blue Sky claims what we consider to be a fabricated obligation to 


maintain secrecy on all of its investments, its portfolio and its performance.  We call on Blue Sky to point to the 


statute or requirement which prevents them from even high-level disclosures regarding their portfolio.  The 


market should not hold its breath, because we suspect that no such requirement exists.  Blue Sky’s claimed 


confidentiality requirement is entirely self-serving and only selectively applied: when it suits the Company, it discloses 


details; when it wants to hide, it insists that its hands are tied.  But in our opinion, this is smokescreen, designed to 


conceal details which we believe will show the truth.   





This should be obvious (to everyone but Blue Sky) but Blue Sky is a public company.  As a public company, it is 


accountable to investors and to the market to provide baseline disclosures regarding its financial condition, including 


its portfolio.   





Other publicly listed asset managers understand this and do not hide behind some fabricated duty of secrecy.  Apollo 


and KKR, which as publicly listed asset managers have similar fiduciary obligations as Blue Sky, provide a transparent 


breakdown of both gross AUM and fee earning AUM (including performance metrics and fees) not only across 


asset classes but at the individual fund level.  They also disclose unrealized and realized valuations and IRRs at the 


fund level.  KKR and Apollo claim no such duty of secrecy.  Neither can Blue Sky, which has pitched itself as a 


Brisbane-based wanna-be KRR to the financial markets.   





We call on Blue Sky to provide the same level of transparency as the alternative asset managers to which it compares 


itself and provide a breakdown of fee earning AUM by fund, complete with disclosures on realized and 


unrealized valuation and IRRs.  Indeed, other asset managers provide at least this level of disclosure in their annual 


reports.   





Investors should insist on transparency.  Blue Sky’s rebuttal was so opaque and defensive that it only enhances 


conviction in our investment thesis.  We continue to believe that Blue Sky materially overstates its reported fee earning 


AUM, that it gouges primarily Australian investors with egregious fees, and that it has overstated its performance by 


inappropriately marking up unrealized investments.

1. Blue Sky Wildly Exaggerates its Fee Earning AUM 
 


In our investment thesis, we posited that Blue Sky overstated its fee earning AUM by reporting the gross value of 


certain assets as AUM instead of the fair value of the capital invested.  Incredibly, in its Response, Blue Sky admits 


that we are right, but makes the excuse that it is “common reporting practice” for Australian property fund managers 


to report gross realizable value (or ‘fair value’ or ‘market value’) of an asset in a property when reporting AUM.  Blue 


Sky then presents a list of five Australian property development comps (and one investment bank) that supposedly 


calculate fee earning AUM in the same way, including Charter Hall (ASX: CHC), Dexus (ASX: DXS) Goodman 


Group (ASX: GMG), GPT Group (ASX: GPT) and Mirvac (ASX: MGR).   





First, this comparison is a disingenuous about face that directly contradicts Blue Sky’s previous representations 


to the market.  Before our report, Blue Sky did not compare itself or its fee earning AUM to pure play Australian 


property developers, but rather to global asset managers such as KKR, Apollo and Blackstone.  The following slide is 


taken directly from a Blue Sky management presentation.   








Source: H1 17 Presentation  


Incredibly, later in its Response, Blue Sky argues that its growing balance of receivables is reasonable by comparing 


itself to these same global asset managers.   





 
Source: Blue Sky Response, p. 5 





But such comparisons are absurdly misleading because KKR, Apollo and Blackstone define fee earning AUM as the 


fair value of their invested capital and not the gross value of assets, companies or real properties.  Indeed, such 


asset managers distinguish between fee earning and non-fee earning AUM in their annual reports.  Blue Sky does not.  


It is disingenuous for Blue Sky to compare itself to global, blue chip asset managers when it is convenient, but to then 


claim it is akin to an Australian property developer when it is not.

It is only after Glaucus exposed Blue Sky for overstating its fee earning AUM (as calculated in the same way as other 


alternative asset managers), that Blue Sky desperately says such comparisons are unfair.  But this is exactly how Blue 


Sky pitched itself to the market: as a Brisbane based wanna-be KKR.   





Blue Sky’s self-selected list of five Australian property developers provide exhaustive disclosures about the value of 


their properties.  Based on these disclosures, investors typically value listed property development companies on a 


multiple of book value of their underlying portfolio.   





Pure play property developers invest almost exclusively in property and derive the majority of income from rents or 


property development.  As pure play property players are transparent about the gross value of the properties they own 


(or manage on behalf of third parties), a standard valuation method is to compare net asset value (NAV) to market 


capitalization.  We provide such a calculation new peers selected by Blue Sky and its formerly favorite peer, 


Blackstone.  The difference is obvious: the market values Blue Sky based on its claim to be an alternative asset 


manager, not as a pure play Australian property developer.

Alternative asset managers are more complex and rather than simply generating direct rental income from the property 


market, generate fee income from underlying funds invested across asset classes.  Not only is it disingenuous for Blue 


Sky to compare itself to such property developers whose portfolios are substantially different; it also directly 


contradicts Blue Sky’s core representations about its business.   





At Blue Sky’s insistence, the market values its shares as an alternative asset manager, not a property developer.  This 


is no accident: Blue Sky has compared itself and its fee earning AUM to the KKRs, Blackstone’s and Apollo’s of the 


world, even though this comparison was as self-serving as it was misleading.

As far as we concerned, Blue Sky can pick its poison.  It can either trade like a pure play Australian property developer 


and trade at 1.0-1.2x NAV; or it can trade as an alternative asset manager like KKR and Blackstone at a 0.13x multiple 


of its actual fee earning AUM (as we estimated in our Report).  Either way, the downside to Blue Sky’s shares is over 


70% from its pre-halt trading price.  


In our Report, we presented a detailed, 26-page analysis of the assets we could identify in Blue Sky’s portfolio.  Our 


analysis broke down Blue Sky’s portfolio into three major categories of investment: real estate, agricultural and 


resources and private equity/venture capital.  Our review was by necessity the work of financial detectives based on 


limited publicly available evidence because Blue Sky has historically failed to disclose (intentionally, we believe) 


much detail on its portfolio or its investments.  Based on our review, we estimated that Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM 


was at most $1.5 billion, not $3.9 billion as claimed by the Company.   





Blue Sky’s response was notable not for its flimsy rebuttals but for its startling lack of transparency as to the basic 


composition of its portfolio.  Blue Sky insists that our estimates are incorrect; yet failed to provide any corrective 


details or any explanation as to how we should adjust our estimates.   





Blue Sky failed to provide even a high-level breakdown of its AUM by category.  Instead, Blue Sky hides behind what 


we consider to be a nonsense excuse that it has a “fiduciary obligation” not to disclose the asset which make up its 


portfolio or even a basic breakdown of its fee earning AUM by asset class.  What possible fiduciary obligation would 


prevent Blue Sky from disclosing a summary of its fee earning AUM by asset class (private equity vs. real estate), or 


the breakdown of fee earning AUM within asset classes (e.g., in real estate, the breakdown between residential, 


commercial and student accommodation)?  If there is a statute preventing such disclosures, where is it?   





As discussed above, other publicly listed asset managers such as KKR and Apollo are bound by similar fiduciary 


obligations as Blue Sky.  And they have no problem being transparent with investors.  For example, Apollo’s annual 


report clearly breaks down the difference between fee earning and non-fee earning AUM, as well as providing a 


breakdown across categories such as private equity, credit and real assets.

Apollo also provides a breakdown of AUM by fund, with disclosed IRRs and a valuation.  Blackstone is even more 


transparent.  Blackstone produces a detailed excel file in which it discloses to investors, by fund, its committed capital, 


available capital, unrealized investments, realized investments, and net IRRs.

Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 





Blackstone has no problem giving detailed and transparent disclosures to investors regarding the performance of its 


investments, the capital invested in its funds and the valuation of its investment vehicles.  We call on Blue Sky to 


provide the same level of transparency as the asset managers to which it compares itself and provide a breakdown 


of fee earning AUM by fund, complete with disclosures on realized and unrealized valuation, real estate debt 


in its portfolio and IRRs at the fund level.   





Such transparency is not limited to American or global asset managers.  Blue Sky compares itself to Australian listed 


property manager GPT Group, (ASX: GPT). Yet GPT discloses to investors a list of its investment properties, 


including the fair value of the properties, GPT’s ownership interest and the last date on which such investments 


were valued.   





 
Source: GPT Group 2017 Annual Report 





If GPT freely discloses the fair valuation of its individual investments (and clearly does not believe there is any 


fiduciary obligation preventing such disclosure), why can’t Blue Sky provide a similar breakdown? Blue Sky fails 


to even provide a summary of its portfolio by asset class.  Blue Sky does not want to reveal any details about its 


portfolio because, in our opinion, it is hiding something.   





2. Evidence that Blue Sky misrepresents the performance of its investments  
 


Blue Sky has reported an impressive 15% IRR net of fees since inception in 2006.  To put this in context, if such 


returns are true, Blue Sky is one of the best asset managers in the entire world over the last decade.  We think such 


reported performance is simply too good to be true.   





In our Report, we opined that Blue Sky has been overstating its financial performance by aggressively, and 


unjustifiably, marking up the value of its unrealized assets.  Our thesis is based on two categories of evidence: the first 


is the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the second is documented examples where Blue Sky has, in our 


opinion, clearly overstated the performance and value of certain investments.

Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 





In its Response, Blue Sky first attempts to dismiss its growing receivables balance by arguing that measured as a 


percentage of revenues, its receivables are reasonable when compared to other blue-chip alternative asset managers 


Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR, Ares and Apollo.  Investors should note with deep irony that Blue Sky wants to invite such 


comparisons when it suits but claims to be an Australian pure play property developer when it doesn’t.   


Blue Sky misses the point entirely and ignores the reason we highlighted the receivables to begin with.  The critical 


data point is that Blue Sky’s receivables have increased substantially over time, both on an absolute and a relative 


basis, suggesting that paper profits from unrealized investments are becoming an increasingly material component of 


the Company’s reported financial performance.  


For example, receivables have grown so rapidly that they comprised 129% of revenues as of LTM H1 18, up from 


just 45% in FY 2015.   





 
Source: Blue Sky Public Filings 





Blue Sky’s Response completely fails to address this change over time.  Why have Blue Sky’s receivables, 


measured on an absolute and relative basis, increased so dramatically in the last three years? The growth of receivables 


has led to a deterioration in earnings quality, as the Company has failed to generate free cash flows despite reporting 


seemingly impressive paper profits.   





 
Source: Blue Sky Public Filings 





In our opinion, the deterioration in the Company’s cash flow generation and its ballooning receivables balance are 


both evidence that management is playing games by inappropriately marking up the value of unrealized investments.   


Our Report also highlighted seven private equity and venture capital investments in which we believe evidence 


suggested that Blue Sky had inflated the performance of the underlying investment.  It is important to note why we 


chose such examples: Blue Sky is so opaque about the performance of its investments, these were some of the only 


examples where we could find publicly available data to analyze the Company’s claims.   


Blue Sky rejects our conclusions but fails to provide any details to rebut our analysis.  If Blue Sky is telling the truth, 


why don’t they provide any calculations or information as to why we are wrong? Blue Sky hides behind its supposed 


fiduciary duties but this, in our view, is nonsense.   


Predictably, Blue Sky pleads with investors to rely on third party valuation by “top-tier” valuers.  In our opinion, 


investors should be highly wary of any public company that points to the credibility of third party valuers to justify 


suspicious marks on its portfolio.  Every public company that collapses under suspicion of fabricating valuations has 


had an auditor.  Quintis had an auditor.  Enron had an auditor.  Investors should not dismiss credible evidence 


that Blue Sky is overvaluing returns or valuations because of some third party valuer who is paid by the Company.   


a. Foundation Early Learning. Excessively Levered and Poorly Performing 
 


In our report, we noted that Blue Sky had marked up its investment in Foundation Early Learning (FEL), a roll-up of 


day care centers, by 42% since 2014.  Yet FEL’s operating cash flows fell 62% year-over-year in FY 2017.  Using 


FEL’s publicly available accounts, we calculated that FEL’s EBITDA was just $1.8 million in FY 2017 and that it has 


a startling net debt to EBITDA ratio of 10.8x.

Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd│ ASX: BLA                          www.glaucusresearch.com 





In its Response, Blue Sky stated that FEL “does not have” a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 10.8x. If that is the case, 


then what is correct net debt to EBITDA ratio? Blue Sky hides behind dubious alleged fiduciary obligations so 


that it does not have to provide any detail or analysis as to why our calculation is wrong.  But we relied on the publicly 


filed statutory accounts for FEL – surely nothing prevents Blue Sky from providing the correct calculation, if as it 


claims, our calculation is mistaken.  After all, FEL already files statutory accounts which can be viewed by the public 


– what is stopping Blue Sky from providing its own analysis based on such publicly available figures?  


Blue Sky oddly counters that FEL is banked by one of Australia’s major banks, as if that is relevant at all to our 


analysis.  Steinhoff also had major banking relationships, which made no difference when the underlying value of its 


business collapsed.  Blue Sky also states that FEL is in compliance with its covenants.  But we never said otherwise.  


FEL’s credit agreements are not publicly available (to our knowledge) so we did not opine on whether it was in 


compliance with its covenants.   


Our point was that given FEL’s negative cash flow and excessive leverage, FEL looks closer to financial calamity 


than a successful investment warranting a markup in value.  Blue Sky never provides any substantive rebuttal to justify 


its markup of its investment given FEL’s documented struggles.   


b. Vinomofo: Strapped for Cash and Missing Growth Forecasts 
 


Blue Sky invested $25 million for a 22.7% stake in Vinomofo in February 2016.  By December 2016, Blue Sky had 


already claimed a 9.3% IRR on its investment.  Yet Vinomofo soon missed its forecasted revenue targets (despite 


doubling its marketing expenses) and continued to burn through cash at an alarming rate.  Publicly available financials 


show that Vinomofo’s cash flow from operations was negative $6.3 million for FY ending June 2017.  By June 2017, 


Vinomofo only had $2.2 million in cash left.  At that run rate, Vinomofo will likely run out of cash without further 


investment or financing.  


Blue Sky argues that Vinomofo “should not have been revalued in December 2016 because the business missed its 


investment case.  Vinomofo grew materially in that financial year…”1  But publicly available financials state that 


Vinomofo’s revenues were $43.7 million in FY 2017, up only $4.4 million from the previous fiscal year.  Such growth 


for a cash-burning, early stage VC investment appears sluggish, not robust.   


Rather than a successful investment justifying a markup, Vinomofo’s growth appears to have slowed, and its cash 


crisis has deepened.  





c. Beach Burrito 
 


In our Report, we calculated that Blue Sky carried its 33% investment in Beach Burrito at $20.4 million (based on 


Blue Sky’s disclosed returns on its investment), meaning the value of 100% of the equity of the burrito chain was a 


staggering $62 million.   


Blue Sky responded that we miscalculated the carrying value of Beach Burrito.  It claims that it carries Beach Burrito 


at less than $20 million for 100% of the equity.  Again, Blue Sky fails to provide even basic details countering our 


calculation.  We fail to see how or why our calculation is incorrect. In 2017, Blue Sky claimed to own 33% of the 


equity in Beach Burrito, not 100% as it now claims.

We relied on Blue Sky’s disclosures and as is typical, we were transparent in our Report about how we calculated 


Blue Sky’s markup.  In its rebuttal, Blue Sky simply hides rather than directly addressing why we are wrong.   





d. Failure to Thrive 
 


In our Report, we highlighted that Blue Sky had marked up its investment in Thrive for the purposes of a follow-on 


investment even though Thrive’s EBITDA declined from negative $1.8 million in 2015, to an even more dire negative 


$2.1 million in 2016.  Over that same period, revenues grew by just $2 million to $9.4 million.  In its Response, Blue 


Sky disputes that it had sole discretion on the valuation of the follow-on investment and claims that we erred in 


calculating the revenue multiple.  But again, Blue Sky provides no substantive rebuttal.  If we erred in our calculation, 


what is the correct multiple?    


e. Viking Dunnie: A Bad Smell.  
 


In our Report, we highlighted that Viking underperformed Blue Sky’s forecasts.  Investor updates show that Viking’s 


EBITDA was just $1.1 million in 2009 (28% less than forecasted), and $1.7 million in 2010 (41% less than forecasted).  


Despite poor underlying performance, Blue Sky marked up its investment by 3.7x and raised a new fund (EC 2010) 


to buy out previous investors at the higher valuation.  In 2015, Blue Sky sold its investment in Viking to a mysterious 


buyer, Bayfront Capital Management (“Bayfront”).  We wondered who was behind Bayfront.  Blue Sky responded 


that Bayfront had no association or relation to Blue Sky whatsoever, and certain media outlets have apparently 


corroborated this claim.  The mysterious buyer claims to be independent, but details regarding the transaction and the 


buyer are hard to come by.  Yet for us, the larger point is that Blue Sky completely ignored our financial analysis 


showing that it marked up its investment despite evidence that Viking was materially underperforming.  


f. Lenard’s: Crying Fowl 
 


In its Response, Blue Sky completely ignored our analysis on Lenard’s.  Blue Sky initially invested $3.3 million in 


2008 for a 30% stake in Lenard’s Chicken, an owner/operator of chicken shops.  Lenard’s immediately 


underperformed.  Blue Sky reported that Lenard’s FY 2009 EBITDA was $718,000, 65% less than forecast at the time 


of the Company’s initial investment.  In 2010, Blue Sky announced a follow-on investment from a new fund (EC 


2010) of $7 million to buy out its previous investors at a price implying that Lenard’s had doubled in value in 28 


months.  Blue Sky complains that no original investors were bought out in the follow-on investment, but that they 


were rolled into the new fund in 2010.  As is typical, Blue Sky provides no documentation to support its assertion, but 


based on the publicly available documents we continue to believe that such investments were “transferred” from one 


investor to the other (which are the exact words from the investment memorandum).   


But again, Blue Sky ignores the larger point.  We highlighted Lenard’s because it is a clear example where Blue Sky 


marked up the value of its investment despite the fact that Lenard’s had performed disastrously.  Blue Sky never rebuts 


or addresses this evidence.   


g. HeyLet’s Overstate Performance 
 


In our Report, we noted that in an April 2017 investment presentation, Blue Sky claimed an 8.5% IRR on its investment 


in HeyLet’s, a social networking site.  This was remarkable as Blue Sky admitted that HeyLets was in the process of 


being liquidated in an investment memorandum dated March 2017.  How could Blue Sky claim such a return on an 


investment that appears to have been a total loss? 


In its Response, Blue Sky made the excuse that the reported return was a result of “movements in foreign currency” 


and that the investment was eventually written off to $0 in June 2017.  But this makes no sense; why would foreign 


currency fluctuations have any impact on the valuation of an underlying investment that was already in liquidation?  


Anything multiplied by 0 is 0.

3. Blue Sky Gouges Australian Investors with Extortionate Fees 
 


A critical element of our investment thesis is our finding that Blue Sky is a massive outlier among global asset 


managers because it gouges Australian investors with extortionate upfront “management” fees as high as 17%, 


which we believe is an off-market, abusive and unsustainable practice.   


These are not performance fees tied to the success of the investments.  Rather, Blue Sky charges such fees up front 


and labels them as management fees, establishment fees, due diligence fees or other advisory fees.  Other asset 


managers charge such due diligence and advisory fees associated with closing a transaction or investment.  But the 


key difference is that even for the world’s best asset managers, transactional fees (advisory, M&A and due diligence 


fees) are offset against management fees.  Yet Blue Sky layers transactional fees on top of management fees, leading 


to an extortionate fee structure designed to rip off investors regardless of whether the underlying investment succeeds.

Not only are Blue Sky’s ludicrous upfront fees an abusive practice that gouges the very investors Blue Sky claims to 


serve, but we believe that Blue Sky’s revenues will continue to shrink as it runs out of suckers.   


Blue Sky complains that the comparison to other asset managers is misleading because there are “structural differences 


between Blue Sky’s fee structures and those other alternative asset managers which are advantageous to fund 


investors… including the fact that Blue Sky typically charges fees on invested capital not committed capital.”2   


First, it is critical to note that Blue Sky never denies layering establishment fees, M&A advisory fees and transactional 


fees upon management fees.  This is off-market, and results in charging investors much higher fees than other 


alternative asset managers.   


Second, the notion that Blue Sky should be applauded for charging fees on invested capital not committed capital is 


ridiculous.  The reason, we suspect, that Blue Sky does this is because has trouble raising money for individual 


investments and thus has no choice but to charge fees on the capital it manages to raise rather than the theoretical 


number it hopes to achieve.    


It is notable that Blue Sky fails to address our follow-on point.  We calculated in our Report that the bulk of Blue 


Sky’s reported management fees are comprised of one-off establishment fees, which are charged up front at the 


beginning of the investment and by nature are not recurring. Based on the investment memoranda we reviewed, we 


estimate that one off “establishment” fees (like due diligence fees or transactional advisory fees) constitute 81% of 


the total “management” fees received by Blue Sky in the first year of a new investment.  Our point is that investors 


valuing Blue Sky’s shares cannot count on the Company’s management fees to be a steady, recurring source of 


revenues because at least half of such management fees are extortionate, front-loaded establishment fees charged to 


unsuspecting investors on new investments.   





Ultimately, nothing in Blue Sky’s Response changes the basic point that its fees are egregious and as a result, are 


likely unsustainable as it runs out of suckers.

Valuation 





It is important to note that we are playing the role of financial detective, reconstructing Blue Sky’s fee earning AUM 


from the limited publicly available evidence and disclosures by the Company about the exact composition of its 


portfolio and the performance of its investments.   





We call on Blue Sky to match the level of disclosure of other alternative asset managers like KKR, Blackstone and 


Apollo (to which Blue Sky compares itself) and disclose its fee earning and gross AUM by asset class and at the fund 


level.  Blue Sky should also disclose, broken down by fund, its IRR, and the balance of realized and unrealized invested 


capital.  Blue Sky should tell investors how much of its supposed fee earning AUM is actually property debt.  Neither 


shareholders nor investors should allow Blue Sky to hide behind fabricated duties of secrecy.  If other alternative asset 


managers can be so transparent, the only reason for Blue Sky’s secrecy is, in our opinion, a desire to conceal an ugly 


truth.   





Ultimately, Blue Sky’s Response shows just how absurdly its stock is priced.  In our Report, we valued Blue Sky’s 


shares on a multiple of enterprise value to our estimate of its maximum fee earning AUM of $1.5 billion.  We think 


that Blue Sky should trade at a discount to the multiple for blue chip asset managers because of the multitude of 


corporate governance concerns identified in our analysis. 





 
Source: Table from Glaucus Report based on Previous Trading Prices 





Our valuation, based on our estimate of fee-earning AUM (calculated in the way that other alternative asset managers 


define fee earning AUM) implies a market capitalization of $256 million and a Glaucus adjusted share price of $2.66.   





But if Blue Sky wants to claim to be an Australian property developer, then its share should trade like one.  Blue Sky 


now admits that it has included debt into its reported fee earning AUM, which it says it should be allowed to do, 


because other Australian pure play property developers do so as well.  Again, this is disingenuous as Blue Sky has 


historically compared itself and its fee earning AUM to the KKRs and Blackstone’s of the world.  But if Blue Sky 


wants to be valued like an Australian pure play property developer, then analysts should use NAV to value it.  On this 


basis, we calculate that Blue Sky’s shares are worth only $2.99.

Blue Sky must pick its poison. Investors will not allow Blue Sky to jump back and forth in a blatant attempt to cherry 


pick the best bits of both worlds.  Either way, it is our investment opinion that Blue Sky’s shares are worth considerably 


less than their last traded price.
