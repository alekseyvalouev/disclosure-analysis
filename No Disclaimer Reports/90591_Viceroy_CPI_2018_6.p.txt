Dear Audit Committee, 


OPEN LETTER 


It is our belief that Capitec management have continued to mislead investors since our previous correspondence 


with the company. End-of-financial-year announcements in 2018 are reflective deteriorating business conditions 


and corroborate the continuity of several intentionally misleading accounting practices we have reported in the 


past.  


We will again entertain Capitec’s invitation to field questions regarding its business. We believe these questions 


are quite straightforward, as per our last correspondence on February 20, 2018, and we would appreciate 


straightforward answers. 


In this instance, we are addressing the audit committee with our concerns, as they relate to broader financial 


reporting transparency and flawed management analysis, corroborating our previous analysis of unsustainable 


business practices. Our continued review of Capitec’s practices and financial results leads us to believe 


management’s delivery of analysis to stakeholders is extremely misleading, and not at all reflective of declining 


business fundamentals. 


This report will follow issues we have raised in previous reports and correspondence with management. You can 


find all of these reports on our website: 


https://viceroyresearch.org/category/capitec-jsecpi/  


We advise that this letter and accompanying documents will be uploaded in full to Viceroy’s website on 


Monday 21 May 2018.  


We look forward a response from the audit committee. 


Yours faithfully 








Viceroy Research Group

1. Can the audit committee justify management’s analysis that Capitec loans are 


trending towards the long-term? 
Capitec management have emphasized their goal in targeting longer-term (over 6-month) loans as more 


sustainable and higher-quality assets.  


 
Figure 1 2018 Capitec Earnings Presentation 


An analysis of Capitec’s loan book over the past 3 years does not corroborate this narrative. 


 
Figure 2 Viceroy Analysis 


The above analysis utilizes figures from Capitec’s releases over the past 2 years and shows that – contrary to 


management’s assertions – the number of long-term loans issued over the past 12 months has substantially 


declined while the number of short-term loans issued has substantially increased.  


Figure 2 above clearly shows that value and number of loans greater than 6 months has decreased in 2018. At 


the same time the value advanced into <6-month loans is up 41% year-on-year in the last 12 months.

Note that these loan sales figures explicitly do not include consolidations and rescheduled loans as per the 


company’s statements.  





 
Figures 3 & 4 2018 Capitec CFO Report 


What is the company’s honest interpretation of this trend? 


When comparing loan sales during a certain period to the company’s total credit book at the end of that period, 


it is apparent that the average value of a long-term loan existing in the company’s credit book is significantly 


larger than the average value of long-term loans issued over that reporting period. 


 
Figure 5 Viceroy Analysis 


Viceroy believes this is inconsistent with Figure 1 wherein the company implies it is moving to longer term loans.  


Capitec claims that this difference is due to lower value loans being paid down, and uses the example below to 


illustrate: 


 
Figure 6 2018 Capitec CFO Statement 


Essentially the company is claiming that the discrepancy is due to lower-value loans being paid down. However 


the justification above only holds true if:

1. The loan book composition substantially changes to include higher-value through proportionately 


higher sales of said loans 


2. The number of loans in the book holds steady once lower-value loan have been paid off (i.e. Capitec 


stops issuing new loans), and/or; 


3. No principal repayments are made on the remaining four loans in the time one loan has been paid in 


entirety. 


Neither of the above are the case, as proven above. Viceroy considers this a flimsy attempt to hide declining 


business fundamentals.  


However, it is consistent with Viceroy’s previously iterated belief that Capitec’s longer term loan book increases 


are due to refinanced loans. Corroborating these views are Capitec claims that rescheduled loans are not 


included in loan sales. The consistency of this difference despite growth in the long-term book leads Viceroy to 


believe that these loans are accruing rather than being paid down. 


 
Figure 7 2018 Capitec CFO Report 


2. Can the audit committee elaborate on the nature of internal consolidation and 


provide analysis into the net loan sales executed to customers who have 


consolidated existing loans? 
The below graph by Capitec shows what are referred to by the company as “internal consolidations”. The 


company has never released this figure prior to this earnings presentation.  


 
Figure 8 2018 Capitec Earnings Presentation 


Capitec claims that as of February 2018, internal consolidations averaged 20% of settlements as a percentage of 


the gross loan sum advanced.  


Firstly, we point out that a 20%-30% range of internal consolidations is huge, and comparable to African Bank’s 


levels during their 2014 collapse.
Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 9 2017 African Bank Integrated Annual Report 


This implies that a large number and value of new loans issued are being granted to repeat customers: repeat 


customers needing progressively larger drawdowns. 


As previously alluded to by Viceroy: so long as a customer is current with their loan, they are theoretically able 


to gain an extension. As shown through numerous channel checks and evidenced through court documentation, 


these customers are not always in financial position to repay these loans.  


We have shown this activity exists within Capitec, we believe it is systematic of the microlending environment 


in South Africa through poor controls established by the NCR. Refer to our previous reports for more information 


in this regard1. 


We remind stakeholders that these loans are marketed as affordable financing for incidental expenses. This is 


clearly not the case. Internal consolidations of 20%-30% show this is not the case. Given the nature of these 


transactions is to essentially draw a further loan amount, the average number of loans per client figure is 


significantly skewed to the point of irrelevance: it does not show how many customers have drawn down 


incremental instalments or how large those instalments have been. 


This strengthens our belief that loan advancements have been over-represented. Concurrently, this may also 


explain the declining value of long-term loans issued: customers accruing debt are no longer able to draw down 


significant amounts. Note that while the consolidated loan amounts are not recorded as new debt, the net 


increases in loans issued are recorded as such, as are the number of loans.  


Further, this amount does not include transactions where cash has been outlaid to customers by Capitec in the 


form of new loans which we have shown through court documents customers then use to repay existing loans. 


These types of transactions are not “internal” by nature and would not be represented in this analysis. 


3. What is the rationale in decreasing bad debt provisions while bad debt is increasing 


exponentially? 
Capitec has responded to an increase in bad debt by decreasing bad debt provisions in the 2018 financial year. 


This seems completely illogical to us, especially given that bad debt has been increasing exponentially since at 


least 2014 while the company’s gross loan book has more-or-less plateaued.

Viceroy Research Group 7 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 11 Viceroy analysis of 2018 Capitec summarized audited results 


Bad debt written off has increased 67% since 2016, vastly exceeding the 16.7% growth of Capitec’s loan book 


over the same period. The table below summarizes this data. 


 
Figure 12 Viceroy Analysis 


4. Why have Capitec changed their provisioning method? 
It appears Capitec have introduced a vastly different arrears provisions categorization system based on time in 


arrears as opposed to number of instalments missed. We have not been able to locate a disclosure to 


stakeholders on this change of provisioning method.  


Due to rescheduling, flexible repayment schedules and unrevised prior-year figures, a real year-on-year analysis 


of arrears provisioning between these systems is inaccurate. For example, a client who is two installments 


behind, but billed on a fortnightly basis, may still only be in the first tier of arrears provisioning from 2018, but 


on the second tier of arrears provisioning from previous years. 


While the two are not comparable it should be noted that the highest-risk tiers incur a lower provision rate while 


low-risk clients incurred a much smaller provision rate reduction.

Figure 15 Capitec 2018 CFO Report 


If anything, the new provisioning method would materially decrease the provisioning amounts as clients less 


than one month in arrears can be over two installments late.  


The implementation of this system appears to have moved loans of certain durations into a more favorable 


provision rate.  


 
Figure 16 Viceroy Analysis 


As seen in the table above, even the most historically at-risk groups have seen drastic reductions in their 


provisioning. This makes sense: clients with shorter-term loans are more likely to have more than one payment 


a month, however those same loans are at the greatest risk. This would make sense, if bad debt were not 


outpacing the growth of the loan book. 


Capitec’s new provisioning system appears to reduce provisioning needs despite increases in clients under debt 


review. The obvious benefit of reducing provisions is a significant bump on earnings in the current period at the 


cost of future earnings.  


We would like the audit committee to confirm whether or not the provisioning method has changed. 


1. If so, what would be the real comparable impact year-on-year? Additionally, why were stakeholders 


not notified of this change? 


2. If not, why have the depictions of the provisioning method changed so substantially in 2018? Were the 


prior year methods and descriptions accurate?

5. Deterioration in loan book quality 
Viceroy’s analysis of Capitec’s financial results show deteriorating asset quality and supports our preliminary 


view that business practices are unsustainable. This is largely contradictory to management’s analysis of the 


same figures. A summary of our analysis is below. 


Can the audit committee elaborate on management’s analysis of loan book quality? 


Bad debt review 


Management attributes the large increase in bad debt to an increase in customers going into debt review and 


implies that this increase is diluted through improved debt collection.  


 
Figure 17 2018 Capitec Summarized audited results 


Our analysis supports that both of these statements are misleading, bordering on false. 


The value of Capitec loans in debt review has only increased on nominal terms. These figures has remained flat 


against bad debt per Figure 18 below. This suggests that a continued decline in loan book quality has led to 


increased bad debt and debt review clients, not vice-versa. 


Bad debt recovery 


Bad debt recovery efficiency has decreased, contrary to management assertions in Figure 17. The nominal value 


of bad debt recovered has increased only due to exponentially larger increases in bad debt. The collection 


efficiency of bad debt has declined year-on-year in FY 2018.

Increase in loans falling into arrears 


The below calculations are courtesy of management in response to a letter by Benguela Global Fund Managers 


(“Benguela”) and related to Capitec’s cure rate, a figure representative of the percentage of loans that go into 


and out of arrears.

Figure 21 Extract from Capitec’s response to Benguela Global Fund Mangers 


Updated figures show no improvement whatsoever in Capitec’s loan book quality. We continue to see anywhere 


between 30% - 45% of the value of the gross loan book falling into arrears EACH YEAR.

We again note that Capitec’s calculations utilize a 2-month average time to cure, however management’s 


analysis claims that a 1-month time-to-cure is more realistic. 


 
Figure 23 Extract from Capitec’s response to Benguela Global Fund Mangers 


As such we can assume that value equal to at least 31% of Capitec’s gross loan book falls into arrears each year 


before being “cured” and made current, but that would be optimistic given highest cure rates are observed on 


clients that are on month in arrears. 


6. Can the company elaborate on the effects of IFRS 9 implementation? 
We note the following extract from Capitec’s 2018 annual report regarding the incoming change to IFRS 


provisioning:

Can the audit committee state the direction of the financial impact?
