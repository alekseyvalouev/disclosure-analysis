First Solar has seen its shares collapse 20% today, after it reported that 2012 operating income would be


as much as 25% lower than originally forecast.


The stock price set new 52-week lows this afternoon, an embarrassing comparison to just two and a half


years ago, when shares topped $317. But even as investment houses like Goldman Sachs, Piper


Jaffray and Miller Tabak + Co. maintain buy ratings on First Solar, one hedge fund manager continues to


see vindication.

For Jim Chanos, president and founder of hedge fund Kynikos Associates, First Solar has been an equity


to short for some time. In his May presentation at the Ira Sohn Conference, he detailed how solar and


wind energy producers had been over-hyped and were on the precipice of decline.


His convictions proved true.


Green energy's economic viability has been overstated
