WATT


Energous stock has more than doubled since early June, in hopes that its wireless
charging technology would be added to the iPhone.


A highly respected Apple analyst does not expect wireless charging to be
integrated into this iPhone.


Energous's two truly wireless products will not be available until 2017 and are not
even approved by the FCC.


Speculation drives the small-cap market, and selecting companies ahead of catalyst
events can be a profitable trading strategy.


This has been the case with a company called Energous Corporation (NASDAQ:WATT).
At almost every Apple (AAPL) event, Energous stock trends higher in hopes that its
wireless charging technology is put into the iPhone.

Apple is holding an event on September 7 to presumably release a new iPhone 7 and
make upgrades to its MacBook line. Energous investors are speculating that the new
iPhone will include wireless charging technology and that Apple will be using Energous's
devices exclusively.


In conjunction with the event, Energous stock has risen from about $12 a share to a
high of $20, almost a 70% gain in less than a month. However, there is a high probability
that the new iPhone will not include wireless charging.


Ming-Chi Kuo is one of the most well-respected Apple analysts and has a track record of
predicting which features and products will be released at the events. He is predicting
the following to be in the new iPhone 7:


New True Tone displays like the iPad Pro range, with laser-based proximity sensors
for faster response times.


1.


32GB, 128GB, and 256GB storage tiers will replace 16GB, 64GB and 128GB.2.


2x 12MP dual rear camera limited to iPhone 7 Plus, uses 1x wide angle and 1x
telephoto lenses.


3.


Upgraded ambient light sensors on both new iPhone cameras for better low light
shots.


4.


Camera flash LEDs doubled from two to four with warm and cool colors.5.


3.5mm headphone jack removed.6.


Lightning EarPods and a 3.5mm to Lightning headphone adaptor included in the box7.


Second external speaker and an integrated amplifier for louder, richer output.8.


Basic IPX7 water resistance - both phones can withstand splashes and full
submersion for up to 30 minutes. Not quite Galaxy S7 level (one hour+), but close.


9.


2GB RAM for iPhone 7, 3GB RAM for iPhone 7 Plus.10.


Next generation A10 chipset sees CPUs hit 2.45 GHz clock speeds and 20-30%
performance gains.


11.


3D Touch 2.0 sensor with more distinct haptic feedback.12.


Home button replaced with non-clicking touch sensor with haptic feedback.13.

Antenna bands removed from the back of both models for a cleaner look.14.


Two new colors: dark black and piano black (latter in limited quantities for 256GB
model); space grey color option ended.


15.


It is not looking like wireless charging will even be an option in the new iPhone 7. Even if
Apple does surprise and includes wireless charging in the iPhone, it is highly likely that
the company it uses will not be Energous.


The midsize WattUp Transmitter has only a 2-to-3 foot charging area and is not even
available until late 2017. The more practical solution would be the full-size WattUp
Transmitter and that will not be available until late 2017 or early 2018.


Additionally, the mid and long-range transmitters are not even approved by the FCC yet.
The mini transmitter is approved, but it requires contact to charge - very little benefit
over a standard cable.


The Apple events have proved to be profitable both ways for Energous stock - going
long before the event, and then selling or going short after.


Pairing stock promotion with a company that has an important upcoming event can fuel
a large run-up followed by a selloff when the expectations are not met. Here is a
screenshot from a recent email promotion:

This promotion is promising gains of 79,900% and suggesting an investment in
Energous can make you "filthy" rich.


This is the same playbook that was used by stock newsletter promoters before the June
Apple event this year. In anticipation of the event, the stock went from about $10 to
about $15. After there was no mention of wireless charging technology, the stock sold
off from the upper $14s to a low of $9.85 in just 4 trading sessions. Below is a chart
detailing the trading around the event.

Lucky for Energous, the September Apple event was right around the corner. Typically,
the September event is when Apple releases its new iPhones, so this made the stock an
easy "buy the dip."


However, this time that time frame will be pushed way further back.
