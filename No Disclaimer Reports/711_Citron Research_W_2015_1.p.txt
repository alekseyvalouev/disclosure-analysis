Wayfair is the Most Mispriced Stock Citron Research has Seen in Years  
 


Fair Value Under $10 
 


Citron Exposes Wayfair's Admission of the Fatal Flaw in their Business! 
 


Wayfair makes Citron feel like apologizing to every company we have written 
about in the past 5 years. Compared to Wayfair, (NYSE:W) ... you all have viable 
business models. Any analyst who defends this stock is clueless about furniture 
retailing and even more clueless about e-commerce. 
 
First, it must be appreciated that Wayfair is not a battleground stock. 
 
Shake Shack, FitBit, Tesla, Ambarella and GoPro: Each of these stocks has passionate bulls and 
bears of equal conviction.  While each of these stocks still sells at nosebleed multiples, each has 
a disruptive, cult like, or blue-sky prospect, which longs and shorts will continue to debate. 
 
Wayfair is not a Battleground! There is no bull case whatsoever and Citron will prove it.  As we 
have previously tweeted, Citron admired the work of the Friendly Bear published last week on 
Seeking Alpha explaining why Wayfair’s current business is in the doghouse: 


http://seekingalpha.com/article/3443236-dont-get-zulilyd-by-wayfairs-overstocked-valuation 


 
While acknowledging Friendly Bear’s piece, Citron elaborates on the real context of Wayfair's 
actual business prospects, predicting that its stock will soon end up in single digits.  We will 
defer to the Friendly Bear for all relevant information about Wayfair’s dangerously high 
customer acquisition costs. 
 
Meanwhile, for longs, a challenge:  Finish this sentence: 


Wayfair is the next __________________________???        Exactly.

It's Overstock!! 
 


First we would like to stress the obvious, which everyone except the company and the analysts 
will admit.  Wayfair is Overstock, plain and simple.   The only difference is that Overstock has 
better brand recognition and higher traffic. 74% of all Overstock sales are furniture and home 
goods.  Here is a quick comparison of the two companies: 
 


 Wayfair Overstock 


Home and Garden 95% 75% 


Drop Ship Product Transaction 95% 90% 


Revenues, last 6 months 916,123,000 786,357,000 


Net gain (loss)  (46,470,000) 4,407,000 


Price / Sales (ttm) 2.18 .32 


Website Rank 160th in the US 138th in the US 


Enterprise Value 3,390,000,000 402,690,000 
 
What is more amazing is that in Wayfair’s analyst report from Evercore we see a consumer 
survey showing that in the past 12 months more people shopped for home goods on 
Overstock than Wayfair.   
 


 
With only slightly more top line revenue, Wayfair is running 5x the amount of commercials as 
Overstock.  Notice even the advertising agencies make the apples to apples comparison.

Both companies even have the same corporate strategies. 
 
This month Overstock partners with HGTV: 
 http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/522546-overstock-partners-hgtv-urban-oasis-home 


 
 And a few months ago Wayfair partners with HGTV: 
http://www.homeaccentstoday.com/article/519317-wayfair-partners-hgtv-fixer-upper-stars 


 
For those who are not convinced this is the same business as Overstock:  take this. 
 
While never PR’d by Wayfair, local news stories have confirmed that as of this month Wayfair 
has committed to open a 1 million Sq Ft. warehouse facility in Cincinnati. (so much for the 
“asset light” model) 
http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2015/08/26/wayfair-distribution-center/32398239/ 
 


This happens to be two miles away from the Overstock warehouse in Cincinnati. 
https://www.internetretailer.com/2013/03/07/overstock-looks-east-new-warehouse-near-cincinnati 


 
And BOTH companies also operate Warehouse shipping Distribution Centers in Utah. 
 


So how does studying Overstock help us understand where 
Wayfair will trade in 12 months? 
 


(OSTK) was spending a similar portion of its gross revenues on marketing until 2006-2007, when 
it reduced this unsustainable spend rate to around 10% of sales. What happened? Revenue 
growth fell from 63% per year in 2005 to -3% in 2007 and never really recovered….Nothing 
more to be said.  https://www.newconstructs.com/danger-zone-wayfair/ 
 
Wayfair actually intentionally shuns the comparison (incredibly, they refuse to mention 
Overstock as a competitor in their SEC filings.) The ONLY conceivable rationale for this omission 
is if they acknowledge Overstock as a comp, it becomes apparent to all that Wayfair's stock is 
not worth more than $10 a share.

Before we prove why Wayfair will face the same uphill battle as 
Overstock in selling furniture/home goods online, let's look at the 


fallacy of their last quarter. 
 


Wayfair's stock surged earlier this month after reporting seemingly strong numbers.   The bulls 
cheered the fact that marketing spend declined marginally, relative to its revenue growth.  The 
analysts were quick to tout this as a breakthrough – and validation of their business model.  
 
We have seen this movie before.  … Saving money by realizing marketing efficiencies while 
riding the wake of a short-term marketing blitz is a one-time event.  It cannot be extended in a 
linear fashion, especially when you are competing with Amazon, Target, and Walmart.  
 


Watching History Repeat Itself 
 


The one-time event of Wayfair's most recent quarter is the IDENTICAL play Zulily ran in Q1 
2014, which drove the stock to its peak, from where it plunged by over 70%.  From the Zulily 
Conference call when the stock was over $50: 
 





Shawn Milne - Janney Capital Markets 


Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the marketing 
efficiency, I mean, pretty remarkable, I mean, your business was up about $130 million in 
revenue on, just under $6 million and I mean, incremental marketing spend? Can you help us 
around what some of the -- what channels were most productive and I don’t know if you can 
maybe give out some mobile app downloads update and what you saw from that channel 
and I have one follow-up? 


Darrell Cavens - Chief Executive Officer 


Sure. I think if you look at our channels, we don’t disclose the kind of difference between 
each one and what we are seeing across channels, but what I can say is, we saw great 
efficiency across all our channels. We continued to see kind of strong diversity across the 
channels there.

For those who need a visual reminder, here's the chart: 
 





Zulily's one-time "marketing efficiency" euphoria bounce, against a background of reality. 


Wayfair is not even as efficient as Overstock or Zulily….look at this startling 
chart to understand what a bad business they have created. 


No True Competitor 





Sources:   New Constructs, LLC and company filings.  





Analysts take notice:   
Anyone who believes that a vertical market retailer selling furniture exclusively 
online is a good business model does not understand the furniture/home 
furnishings category and does not understand e-commerce.  Will analysts please 
understand the shortcomings of this “asset light business model.”

The Fallacy of the “Asset Light” Model in Furnishings Sales 
 


 
 
So let’s get this straight: 
 
Walmart has 4,500 stores around this United States that each serve as return centers and you 
are bragging that you don’t... 
 


Target has 2,000 possible return centers and you are bragging that you don’t... 
 


Restoration Hardware has created the most beautiful stores in the country that connect 
emotionally with the consumer and you bragged that you don’t... 
 


William Sonoma has 600 of its brand stores throughout the most strategic parts of the county 
…  but you brag that you have 0. 
 


Lastly, Amazon has built out a distribution system with technology and warehouses on a scale 
that the world has never seen…but again, you brag that you are “asset light”. 
 
In the universe of high end furniture the ONLY model that works on large scale is omni-channel 
selling.  This is not the isolated opinion of Citron Research, this is 20 years’ worth of experience 
of industry experts and billions of dollars in profits ALL AGREEING on the point. 
 


For those who think Williams Sonoma and Restoration Hardware are “bricks and mortar” 
stores, it should be noted that both companies generate 50% of all their revenues online -- 
and they do so profitably.  These are not merely stores with websites, they are omni-channel 
retail companies. 
 
Wayfair CANNOT survive being an online seller of mid to high end furniture and home goods 
without physical locations….plain and simple.  If you do not believe Citron, than believe the 
words of home decorating “Bible” Architectural Digest: 
 





http://www.architecturaldigest.com/blogs/daily/2015/07/one-kings-lane-showroom 
 
 


“But as anyone who’s ordered a light fixture or piece of upholstery 
online can attest, when you haven’t seen the item in person, there’s 
always a looming element of uncertainty. Is the color true to the way 
it looks on-screen? Are the proportions right in your space? “ 


-- Architectural Digest,  July 1, 2015 


-- Analyst Report from  


"Wayfair brags that they have an “asset light” business model.  That is 
like a homeless man bragging that he doesn’t have a mortgage."

If there is any way you believe that Wayfair is investable because it is unique and revolutionary, 
it must be pointed out that they are selling their own branded furniture in the most non-
revolutionary way possible:  Catalogs!  Just like the Sears and JC Penny of old….and exactly 
what their most experienced and low multiple profitable competitors do: 


http://www.birchlane.com/v/request_catalog/display 





 
 
Citron has to conclude that to the analysts, "Asset Light" means "un-modeled expenses".... e.g. 
you guys don't have the slightest idea what it takes build a profitable furniture / home 
furnishing company.   
 
Note the following chart…there is only one company that is a pure play Internet in the home 
furnishings space: Wayfair.  That is not an accident – it is because it is a losing proposition. 
 





Has Wayfair really cornered a unique strategy?  Or has it just committed itself in a margin race 
to the bottom, pitted against Target and Walmart in the low-to-mid omni-channel, and highly 
sophisticated prestige brand-building omni-channel retailers on the high end, all while dodging 
the full-court-press of Amazon's dynamic pricing?  
 


"Asset Light?”  Deploying million-square-foot warehouse projects, 
catalogs and high-rent district furniture showrooms?

Why Furniture Retailers Need an Omnichannel Strategy

Enabling Omnichannel Commerce: The Next Big Thing in Furniture Retail 
http://www.blueport.com/blog/enabling-omnichannel-commerce-the-next-big-thing-in-furniture-retail 





Wayfair and E-commerce  
If you think Wayfair faces challenges against branded high-end omni-channel 
retailers -- this is nothing compared to the challenges they face online at the low 
end.  
 


First of all, nearly all consumers motivated to shop online in this category want to "save 
money".   How difficult is it for them to Google search for the lowest-cost source for nearly any 
item they are interested in? 
 


The Elephant in the Room: Amazon's Dynamic Pricing Model 
It is impossible for Wayfair to compete against Amazon on pricing.  Here is a recent interview 
given to Bloomberg with Wayfair's CEO in which the interviewer actually names specific 
products and prices, calling painful attention to cheaper pricing on Amazon on many items.   
 


http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-13/wayfair-furnishing-a-revenue-path-to-profitability [ 3:00 ] 
 
Here is how Amazon makes it completely impossible to compete with them on price:  Dynamic 
Pricing.  By using algorithms to change prices on millions of items hundreds of times a day, 
every day, Amazon makes sure that any product showing a meaningful sales volume trend will 
always have a lower price at Amazon; therefore they will either win the customer or at best, 
obliterate the margins of competitors.

Amazon implements 2.5 million changes per day to pricings … take that, Wayfair.  
 
Wayfair will contend that they will “out-merchandise” Amazon.  So as long as your users DO 
NOT KNOW HOW TO USE GOOGLE…..you might have a business.  Just plain stupid. 
 


Citron has read every analyst report as of the last quarter, and, unfathomably, 


not a single one of them even mentions the word “Amazon”.   
 
Note to analysts:  If you think you can “analyze” an E-Commerce company and 
not even refer to Amazon, it is time you quit your job and take up another line 
of work.  


 
A Browsing Tour of E-Commerce 
 


There are millions of ways to demonstrate just how difficult and competitive this space is.  After 
earnings last week, the Bloomberg interviewer referenced above immediately questioned the 
future of the company that can’t offer better pricing than Amazon: 


http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-13/wayfair-furnishing-a-revenue-path-to-profitability 


 
Citron wanted to illustrate that the vast majority of goods that are less expensive on other sites 
(namely Amazon) so if any potential customers refer to a Google search -- Wayfair loses.

Price Match Policies 
 


Walmart and Target also have aggressive price match policies.  While they clearly don't have 
the price change flexibility that Amazon does (changing prices on shelf tags and POS scanner 
systems is a bigger task than just changing the price displayed to an online customer) clearly 
nobody is going to be able to expand gross margins competing against Target and Walmart 
either, much less having to go head-to-head against Amazon.   
 


Many Happy Returns? 
 


The power of omni-channel marketing is just as impactful in the low-to-mid end of the home 
furnishings sector.  As anyone who has ever bought furniture online knows, the biggest risk is 
that today's online furniture purchase winds up in your garage tomorrow.   
 


Walmart and Target offer return policies that Wayfair can't possibly ever compete with.  
  


While Wayfair online buyers are stuck with paying return shipping fees, buyers at 
Walmart.com and Target.com can return products bought online to any Walmart

or Target store location.   (Except, notably, in the case of Walmart.com items "fulfilled by 
Wayfair!)   
 


" Wayfair items cannot be returned to Walmart stores or to Walmart.com." 
 


 
Because furniture items are often bulky, this could be a $50 hit on a $200 purchase, to keep the 
item from winding up in your garage.   
 
It is Citron's opinion that many consumers will continue to consider it a superior value to pay a 
slightly higher price merely for the level of "return assurance" and convenience afforded by box 
stores like Target or Walmart.   


 
Incredibly, Wayfair admits yet another major flaw in 
their business model... in their own words. 
 


Through a rarely publicized artifact of their business called “Get it Near Me” in which Wayfair 
sells ads to retail furniture stores, Wayfair offers up a one line admission that proves in their 
own words the inherent flaw in their business that cannot be changed. What you are about to 
read is all you have to know to pinpoint why this Unicorn is doomed to certain death. 
 





http://advertising.wayfair.com/advertise/advertise-industry-retail.php 


 
 
The company states in its own "Get it Near Me" FAQ: 
 





http://www.getitnearme.com/faq.asp 
 


Q: If Wayfair sells furniture, why would I want to advertise on your sites? Aren’t we 
competitors? 
 


Yes and no. As an online-only retailer of furniture, most people use our sites as a way to 


conduct product research before going to one of their local “brick and mortar” 


furniture stores to make a purchase. 





Although the vast majority of consumers go online to begin their research 
for a major home purchase, the vast majority of consumers will ultimately 
make their purchase at a brick & mortar store. This presents an incredible 
opportunity for retailers to get the attention of consumers as they 
conduct their research.

Citron Reports on Wayfair Citron's Best Short Idea Ever Page 12 of 14 
 August 31, 2015 


Wayfair's "Get it Near Me" program is all but an admission that Wayfair's core 
business will never change consumer home goods buying behavior to the point 
that the company will be profitable. 
 


A Note About Customer Satisfaction 
 


The most obvious indication of the problems with the Wayfair business model is the extraordinary 
amount of customer complaints online.  When selling non branded merchandise, for which you do not 
control the ship dates,  and the product is often too large to return easily (have fun returning a sofa), 


you have an uphill business model.  Maybe that is why Wayfair's "asset light" model continues to lose 
money while their omni-channel  competitors rack up profits quarter after quarter.  Everyone knows just 
google “Wayfair complaints” and your head will spin. 
 


Management is Deceiving Investors 
 


A recent Bloomberg interview with Wayfair CEO Nirah Shah just proves how clueless he is about his own 
business.  This is the same guy who couldn’t figure out to start a furniture “brand” until Google changed 
its search mechanisms.  Citron adds comments on his statements.

 which drove the profit line” [0:30] 


No!  It did not drive a profit line.   


It made you have a smaller loss -- big difference! 


“Home is a 250 billion retail market and as it is shifting online -- 


we think  there will be a big winner and ...  


we are having success at being that winner” [0:50] 


How are you a winner-- with 200 million in accumulated losses  
after being at the business for 13 years -- 


 while your competition, both high and low end,  
have generated billions of dollars in profits in the same category? 





“For the first 9 years of this business we were profitable” [1:10] 


You were? As the filing of the S-1 your company had  


$190 million in cumulative losses before you went public  


and the number has done nothing but escalate.   


There is a difference between generating a small profit  


as a private company and trying to scale a business.

How many times have investors read this dishonest description of Wayfair? 





What is transformative here?  Using the internet to buy goods??  What is the differentiated 


retail experience?  The only thing differentiated is the ability to lose hundreds of millions of 


dollars while Wall Street allows insiders to dump stock at a staggering pace -- that truly is 


differentiated in the furniture and home furnishings space, where their competitors are held to 


the burden of making a profit. 





    Conclusion- Why Wayfair Will NEVER achieve mass-scale 


profitability -- simplified.     
 


There are only 3 numbers of significance that stand in the way of a path to profitability for 
Wayfair: 


 Gross Revenues 


 Gross Margin 


 Marketing Costs 


The company's much touted recent quarter netted them a 4% loss on revenues which were up 
66.45% over the prior year's quarter.   
 


The law of large numbers has claimed billions of investor dollars invested in internet companies 
over the years. Unless you have a viral strategy, paying for traffic flow is an extremely high risk 
strategy.  If it doesn't bind long-term customers, you have flushed your investor’s money on 
nothing.  Etoys and pets.com are but two examples among hundreds of forgotten URL's which 
used ad spend trying to carve out online turf for a vertical market.  
 


Meanwhile, the margins on online furniture, and the brutal realities of dynamic pricing 
strategies, promise that this company is unlikely to ever see margin expansion, and in fact, 
margin contraction is in fact a very real risk.  Wayfair's gross margin, which the company has 
been unable to expand by even one point over several years, is so narrow that driving revenues 
higher alone won't get this company into the green.

So Wayfair won't become profitable, regardless of the size of the top line, without slashing its 
all-in marketing costs to the low teens.  At the moment those costs are 21.08% of gross, having 
peaked in 2014 at 24.81%  
 


With an intense marketing spend (for instance, running 5x more TV ads than Overstock), the 
transactions generated from this ad spend aren't profitable.  The company "hopes" that a large 
percentage of these first-time buyers will become long-term customers of Wayfair.  Evercore's 
model, for example, has this company losing an additional 80 million through the end of 2017, 


and even then just breaking even.  And to merely break even 2 1/2 years from now, 
they are required to hit the trifecta of:   


 steep revenue growth … 


 ... while slashing marketing spend by nearly 3 points less than current 
quarter's "lowered" rates....  


 And, despite withering competition, carve out marginally positive gross 
margins too.  


For those reasons, Wayfair is the most mispriced publicly traded stock Citron 
has seen in years -- with 80% downside.
