5/20/2018 New Hedge Fund Strategy: Dispute the Patent, Short the Stock - WSJ


https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-manager-kyle-bass-challenges-jazz-pharmaceuticals-patent-1428417408 1/3


A well-known hedge-fund manager is taking a novel approach to making money: filing and
publicizing patent challenges against pharmaceutical companies while also betting against
their shares.


Kyle Bass, head of Hayman Capital Management LP—which made a fortune wagering on the
housing bust—is targeting patents that he says have little value other than to drive up
prescription drug prices. His new fund bets against companies whose patents it believes are
spurious, and invests in those that would profit if the patents are invalidated, said people
familiar with the matter.


His latest challenge seeks to employ a relatively new and inexpensive petition process to
invalidate a Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC patent for Xyrem, a narcolepsy drug with
sales of $779 million last year, two-thirds of Jazz’s 2014 revenues.


Mr. Bass created the Coalition for Affordable Drugs, an organization that is the lead petitioner
in several patent challenges filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He says he plans to
pursue the cases regardless of share price moves. “We will not settle,” he said in an interview.


Jazz Pharmaceuticals, of Dublin, Ireland, didn’t respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Mr. Bass previously challenged patents held by Acorda Therapeutics Inc., of
Ardsley, N.Y., and Shire PLC, of Dublin. Acorda and Shire said they would defend the patents,
and said the patents targeted represent a portion of the intellectual property protecting their
drugs.


Mr. Bass, 45 years old, insists his challenges will help reduce drug prices, which he says are kept
artificially high because of patents. In the U.S., drugs generally enjoy a 20-year period of market
exclusivity from the date of patent filing before generics can be sold at steep discounts.


The pharmaceutical industry contends Mr. Bass is exploiting a process designed to aid patent
holders in defending themselves, twisting it to provoke fear among his target’s investors, and
then gain from the fallout that may result.


“There’s nothing in this man’s history to suggest he has any interest in lowering health-care
costs,” said James C. Greenwood, chief executive of the trade group Biotechnology Industry
Organization.


Mr. Bass’s strategy taps an administrative process known as Inter Partes Review, or IPR, that
allows petitions to strike down patents to be heard by a patent office panel. The process was
created by Congress in 2011 to help companies fight so-called patent trolls, nonoperating
companies that extract cash settlements from companies they accuse of patent infringement.
The panel is a cheaper and faster option than trials in federal courts.


IPR challenges are evaluated by a panel of three administrative patent judges who use a
broader set of criteria than the courts when deciding whether patents should be invalidated,
making it much easier to strike down patents, experts said. Some 77% of patents evaluated
through the IPR process have been invalidated or disclaimed by their owners, according to an
analysis published last year in the University of Chicago Law Review.


Acorda Chief Executive Ron Cohen said the petition process was never intended to be used as
Mr. Bass is employing it. Congress has inadvertently created a “mirror image problem of
‘reverse patent trolls’” that use the system to invalidate operating companies’ patents, he said.


Mr. Bass has teamed up with intellectual-property consultant Erich Spangenberg, who
opponents call a patent troll because of his frequent patent suits. Mr. Spangenberg, 54 years
old, made his name and fortune by acquiring technology patents and using them to sue such
firms as Apple Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. for infringement.


He also has worked as an adviser to other patent holders, assembling dossiers on alleged
infringement in exchange for collecting a percentage of the holders’ future winnings, a person
familiar with the matter said.

5/20/2018 New Hedge Fund Strategy: Dispute the Patent, Short the Stock - WSJ

One of Mr. Spangenberg’s firms, nXn Partners LLC, is a paid consultant to Mr. Bass’s more than
$2 billion Hayman Capital, according to filings with the patent office. Both men are named as
“real parties of interest” in the petitions.


Messrs. Bass and Spangenberg, both based in Dallas, met last year through mutual friends,
according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Spangenberg was looking for a way to
capitalize on what he perceived as the vulnerability of certain pharmaceutical patents through
the IPR petition process, one of these people said. Two weeks later, the men agreed to work
together.


Under their arrangement, Mr. Spangenberg sizes up potential patent targets, using a predictive
analytics software program he acquired several years ago, that helps determine the strength of
certain patents.


“A small minority of drug companies are abusing the patent system to sustain invalid patents,”
Mr. Spangenberg said in a prepared statement.


Months after their meeting, Mr. Bass was pitching wealthy individuals and institutions to
invest in a dedicated fund that would bet against, or short, the shares of companies whose
patents Mr. Bass believed to be specious, and wager on rivals that could benefit. In particular,
Mr. Bass was interested in older patents which he believed to be more vulnerable.


The fund requires a minimum $1 million investment, and Mr. Bass’s firm will keep 20% of all
profits earned, according to a person familiar with the matter. The trades also will be part of
Hayman Capital’s main fund.


Mr. Bass is no stranger to controversial gambles. He was one of the handful of hedge-fund
managers to spot trouble in the subprime mortgage markets before the finance crisis, earning
hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profit, investor documents show. Mr. Bass is willing to
press this latest effort in patents for three years—longer even than his bet against subprime, a
person familiar with his plans said.


More recently, his firm has struggled. He predicted long-term insolvency for Japan amid
demographic pressures—an outcome that hasn’t come to pass. And he forecast a dramatic
recovery for the largest U.S. auto maker General Motors Co. , but its share price has lagged his
targets. Last year, Hayman Capital’s main fund posted a small loss, a person familiar with the
matter said.


The patent office hasn’t yet decided whether it will review the Coalition for Affordable Drugs’
petitions, and it is unclear whether the challenges will succeed. But says Jacob S. Sherkow, an
associate professor at New York Law School who studies pharmaceutical patents, “It’s hard to
be more upbeat than a lot of CEOs are about the strength of their intellectual property.”


If Mr. Bass is right about their reliance on weak patents, CEOs ought to “be very worried,” Mr.
Sherkow adds.
