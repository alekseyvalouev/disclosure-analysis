GSX Techedu: Rise of the Machines 
 





• We are short GSX because we conclude that it is a near-total fraud.   
 


• We conclude that at least ~70% of its users are fake, and we think it’s quite likely that at 
least ~80% of its users are fake.   


 
• Our conclusions are based on GSX’s own user and attendance data files (i.e., this is not 


from “scraping” data).  We downloaded GSX’s data from more than 200 paid K-12 
classes covering 54,065 unique users.   


 
• In addition, a former GSX manager corroborated our analysis, and explained various 


details of GSX’s extensive bot operation.

• Based on the near total faking of users, we assume that the fraudulent portion of GSX’s 
revenue is at least equal to the percentage of fraudulent users, although it would not 
surprise us if the ASP on the real portion of GSX’s business is fraudulently inflated too.   


 
• We conclude that GSX is a massive loss-making business.  Without users, there is no 


revenue.  We also conclude that GSX greatly understates expenses.  Regardless of how 
one cuts it though, GSX is an almost completely empty box.   


 
• Amazingly, Chairman Chen has found a way to make GSX shares even more dangerous 


for long holders – he has pledged at least $318 million of stock.  Long holders of GSX 
face the risk that the margin lenders will be forced to aggressively sell the stock, crashing 
the price. 


 
We are highly confident that at least 73.2% of the 54,065 users in the analyzed classes are bots.  
We identified these bots through patterns we call “Precise Joiners”, “GSX IP Joiners”, and 
“Burst Joiners”.  However, we think it is quite likely that at least 80.8% of the users are bots.  
We reach this ratio when we include users displaying an anomalous behavior we call “Early 
Joiners”.  Moreover, we reached these conclusions using assumptions we believe are company 
favorable.  A somewhat less company-favorable approach would yield a fake user ratio 
approaching 90%.   
 
Chairman Chen strangely tried to dissuade us from looking at GSX last month.  In an interview 
with Chinese media on April 8th, he said  
 


“I think if Muddy Waters analyzes our data seriously, there is a high probability that I 
think Muddy Waters will not be so stupid.  The level and IQ of the people in Muddy 
Waters is quite high.”1   
 


That was obviously a bluff, and we call it. 
 
 
Bot Hunting and Identification 
 
We analyzed 463,217 sign-on records for 54,065 Genshuixue and Gaotu users across more than 
200 paid K-12 classes in the first half of 2020.  We identified three bot patterns that we are 
highly confident accounted for 73.2% of the unique users in our study.  Adding a fourth pattern, 
which we think highly likely indicates bots, brings the bot proportion to 80.8%.  Changing 
certain assumptions to be less company-favorable would bring the bot total to approximately 
90%.  The fake users are apparently controlled by GSX teachers and tutors, as well as by third 
parties.

The records are available to any paying student and can be legally accessed through Google 
Chrome, an iPhone, and a proxy server.2  We provide detailed instructions on how to access 
these records in Appendix 1. 
 
There are four patterns of user joining that we believe show the user is actually a bot.  A former 
GSX manager corroborated our observations and provided further detail on how GSX carries out 
its user fraud.  We term these four patterns of bot users: Precise Joiners, Burst Joiners, GSX IP 
Joiners, and Early Joiners.

Precise Joiners 
 
Over half (52.8%) of the unique users in our sample were identified as bots because they are 
“Precise Joiners” or are linked to them.  Precise Joiners are users who join a class at same time – 
to the second – on the same day of at least two different weeks, and the users linked to them.  We 
contend that the probability of such a precise login happening two or more times for single user 
in a single course is extremely low.  In addition to variability on a (human) user’s side in terms 
of when he logs in, there are moment-to-moment differences in the way internet traffic and data 
within GSX’s own network is flowing that make logging in at the precise second one or more 
weeks apart almost impossible.  To us, that is similar to a weekly flight from City A to City B 
touching down two or more times at exactly the same second. 
 
Within the data of the 54,065 unique users analyzed we found 5,742 users (10.6%) whose logins 
record this precise joining phenomenon.  Note also that 100% of these Precise Joiners exhibited 
at least one of the other bot behaviors we discuss, which resoundingly validates this method of 
bot hunting. 
 


 
 
While most Precise Joiners recorded only one precise join (two different occasions with log-ins 
at the same second), our data found 1,261 (21.6%) of the unique Precise Joiners performed this 
feat on two or more occasions, and one Precise Joiner recorded nine Precise Joins.

We then linked these Precise Joiners to 33,145 additional users who share the same distinct IP 
and users who joined classes at the exact same moment (often as part of large bursts).3  After 
subtracting 10,342 duplicates, this resulted in 28,545 total users (52.8%) that we are highly 
confident are fake.

GSX IP Joiners 
 
Adding GSX IP Joiners brings the total percentage of High Confidence bot users to 34,534 users, 
or 63.9%.  GSX IP Joiners are unique purported student users that use the same IP address as a 
teacher or student, or are linked to such users.  Because GSX no longer operates physical schools 
or learning centers, it should not be possible for students to share the IP of a teacher or tutor.  Yet 
15,239 purported student users (28.2%) shared a teacher or tutor IP on at least one occasion.  The 
former GSX manager confirmed that some teachers and tutors operate bot networks for GSX.  
Almost two-thirds of GSX IP Joiners are also Precise Joiners, which reinforces our conclusions.   
 
Another 1,364 unique users are linked to these GSX IP Joiners, bringing the total percentage of 
unique users identified this way to 16,603, which is 30.7%.4  The 1,364 additional users link to 
the 15,239 purported student users through shared IPs.   
 





 
 
There were 10,614 GSX IP Joiners (63.9%) that were also Precise Joiners.  Eliminating the 
duplicate unique users, our High Confidence bot total reaches 63.9%. 
 


																																																								
4 Some of the GSX IP Joiner bots also logged in from non-teacher / tutor IPs (the average IP to GSX IP Joiner ratio 
is 2.9:1). We noted 47,583 different IP addresses across these 16,603 unique users. The 394 teacher and tutor 
accounts to which these bots link logged into the classes we studied using 743 IP addresses, which is a ratio of 1.9:1, 
showing yet another suspicious metric with respect to the GSX IP Joiners.

Burst Joiners 
 
We count 5,016 additional bots from Burst Joiners, bringing the High Confidence total to 39,550, 
which is 73.2%.  Burst Joiners are large groups of users who join at the same second (4,528 / 
8.4%), e.g. 20 or 30 users in the same second, and other users that link to them through shared 
IPs (488 / 0.9%).  What makes this phenomenon even more conspicuous is that these bursts often 
take place in the midst of little – to no – joining activity.  This anomaly strikes us as similar to 
seeing 10 subway trains pass by in an hour, with nine of them completely empty and one 
completely full.  Real life just does not work this way. 
 
Reinforcing our conclusions, 62.8% of Burst Joiners display at least one other High Confidence 
bot behavior.  We are highly confident that when these bursts occur more than five minutes 
before or after the start of a class, it means a group of bots has been suddenly logged into the 
class.  We believe the five-minute cut-off is company favorable, and that the real number of bots 
that are burst joining within the excluded window could be significant. 
 
The Burst Joiner pattern for a given class can be visualized by a graph on which the Y axis is 
time, broken into increments of one second, and the X axis is each unique user.  When burst 
joins occur, this graph displays long horizontal lines.  The graph below shows the joining pattern 
for a class for a paid upper grade elementary school math course on the GSX platform that runs 
over several months.  The below pattern is generally consistent with the classes in our data set – 
i.e., it is fairly typical.  (Note the horizontal white line is the second at which the class started.) 
 


 
 
In Burst 1, 104 unique users join during a four second period that begins nine minutes 40 
seconds before the start of class.  There are six Precise Joiners in Burst 1. 
 
To be company favorable, we do not count bursts that occur five minutes before class start 
through five minutes after class starts.  Therefore, although they are greatly suspect, we do not 
count logins in Burst 2 as bots, unless they exhibit some other bot behavior (including joining at

the same second as a Precise Joiner).  In the nine second period starting from five seconds before 
the start of class to three seconds after class starts, 648 users – including 37 Precise Joiners – 
joined.  We therefore did not count about two-thirds of these logins as bots because they did not 
join in the same second as Precise Joiners. 
 
Although Burst 3 occurs at four minutes seven seconds after class starts (within the five minute 
window), we count these joiners as bots because during this three second window, among the 96 
stragglers were three Precise Joiners that joined at the same times. 
 
 
Overall High Confidence Bot Mix 
 
There is significant overlap among the various bot use patterns we observed.  On a standalone 
basis, we are highly confident that each behavior indicates bots.  However, when we see the 
overlaps between the various behaviors, the patterns are even more solidly established as indicia.  
One-third of the High Confidence bots exhibited at least two indicia of bot behavior.  
Approximately one-half of that number exhibited all three indicia.

Including Early Joiners Brings the Bot Total to 80.8% 
 
Totaling up the previous three categories, 73.2% are High Confidence bots.  We think it is very 
likely that another 7.7% (4,143) are also bots, based on their “Early Joiner” behavior pattern.   
 


 
 
Early Joiners are users who login to online classes implausibly early, and which we therefore 
believe are likely fake.  We set the cut-off time at more than 30 minutes before class start, which 
we believe is company favorable.  While in the real world, it would not be unusual to see some 
students in a lecture hall more than 30 minutes early, that is again not what we would expect real 
students to do in an online environment.  It would be similar to logging into a video conference 
more than 30 minutes early. Yet, the Early Joiner is not an infrequent anomaly for GSX. 
 
The total number of unique Early Joiners in our sample was 7,579 (14.0%), of which 3,676 
(48.5%) exhibited at least one of the other assumed bot behaviors, which reinforces its value as 
an indicator of bots.  Eliminating the duplicates from other categories results in Early Joiners of 
3,903 (7.2%).  Adding users that share Early Joiner IP addresses makes the total 4,143 Early 
Joiners (7.7%). 
 
Had we decreased the cut-off time to more than 15 minutes before class, it would increase the 
number of Early Joiners by 1,962 (3.6%).   
 
“Group Control” – Corroboration from a Former Manager 
 
A former GSX manager corroborated our observations about the fake user patters.  He displayed 
detailed knowledge of GSX’s bot operations, which he said began in 2015.   
 
He said that GSX uses software nicknamed “Group Control” (群控软件) to control the bot 
networks.  He stated that Group Control apparently can supposedly ramp up attendance through

trickles or bursts.  This ability to control the bots’ sign-on pattern shows that GSX is likely 
thinking about how to disguise its bot activity. 
 
Group Control’s back end apparently has tools to direct the flow of student attendance, such as 
by scheduling bot sign-ins, and determining the sign-in patterns (e.g., bursts, trickles).  As is 
typical with bot farms, one or more servers are used to control over 500 to a 1,000 or more cell 
phones (IMEIs).  Each device will have a separate cell phone number, WeChat number, and be 
programmed to buy a product, or attend a class, etc.   
 
GSX also utilizes outside companies that operate bot networks.  According to the former 
manager, these companies are typically compensated through a commission of about 2% to 5% 
of would-be revenue based on the tasks required.  Some companies specialize in attending class. 
Some specialize in signing up for classes and paying.  GSX apparently provides the cash needed 
to legitimize the transactions, and books much of the cost of generating these bot runs through 
sales and marketing expense or cost of sales lines.  The former manager named three separate 
companies that reportedly provide bot users to GSX, including Weishi (an app owned by GSX) 
and Baijia Youlian (a 30% investee of GSX).   
 
Below is a roughly two and one-half minute uninterrupted segment that offers some particularly 
interesting detail: 
 
Former  跟学谁自己都有怎么一个机房，一个机房里面概有上万多的这样的机器， 


就是我们叫做群机器人，来自己去控制， 一个人大概能控制一千多手机也
没有问题，然后去远程也好，还是在机房也好，我可以控制所有的机器，然


后去模拟真实的学生或者是真实的购物的数据, 这个已经很成熟的技术。 
 
 GSX itself has a room, in this computer room there are over 10,000 machines, we 


call them the group robots, which is used to control [the operation].  One person 
can control about 1,000 cell phones without a problem, and these can be operated 
remotely or from the room, I can control all of the machines.  Then I can imitate 
the data generated by a real student or real buying, this is already a very mature 
technology. 


 
Q  GSX他们自己有一个小的团队来操作吗？是这个意思吗？ 
  GSX itself has a team that does this?  Is that what you mean? 
 
Former  对。一直都，一直都有存在个团队。 
  Yes.  Always, this team has always been there. 
 
Q  一直是从哪一个阶段来开始？是什么 17 年，这样，从新的一个模式？ 


“Always been there” means starting from when?  Is it from 2017, beginning with 
the “new model”? 


 
Former 不是，我们在二零，二零 15 年开始就有了。因为那时候我们做 O2O， 我们


给很多的机构引流， 那时候学生特别少，我们要老师感觉来上课人不少，


Page 11 of 25
特别刚开始的时候，我们已经有这样的技术， 比如说只报了五个学生然剩
下的 500 个我们就有机器人去，让流量很大，上网去听课，让他们感觉这个
平台流量很大，从一五年开始就有. 


  No, this started in 20… in 2015 it already started.  Because then we were doing 
O2O [online to offline], we helped many institutes attract more traffic.5  At that 
time there were few students, but we want the teachers to feel that there were 
many, especially when we just started, for example just five students might have 
signed up and the remaining 500 were robots, letting the traffic volume become 
very big, going online listening to the class, it let them feel that the platform’s 
volume was huge.  Starting from 2015 this was there. 


 
Q 那这样学费是怎么做的呢？这个我有点不太了解，是给他们一个代码免费买


课程吗？或者是这个小公司会怎么样付这个学费？ 
 Then how was the tuition done?  This I don’t really understand, did they have a 


code to sign up for free?  Or how would these small companies [bot operators] 
pay the tuition fees? 


 
Former 比如说我是跟谁学，我会跟另外一家公司，比如[redacted]，我会跟它签，


我要投一百万的广告，然后我会承诺给你，比如说，其中百分之 2 ，你可以
自己留下来，比如说你可以留下两万块钱… 


 For example, I am GSX, I will use another company, like [redacted], and I will 
sign [a contract] with them, I will put Rmb 1,000,000 into ads, and they will 
promise me, for example, that 2%, that they can keep Rmb 20,000… 


 
Q  两万快钱的佣金？ 
 RMB 20,000 commission?  
 
Former 对，两万块钱的佣金，这个两外 98万你必须通过这些虚拟的手机号或微信


的账号然后购买我的课程就变成我的收入，是这样子。这是一部分。这是跟


谁学至少要亏本 2%对吧。 这是一小部分。另外一个是跟一些老师合
作。。。就比如我同样给你一百万，然后我也会签成市场费用，把你的， 
那你必须把一百万卖回来， 为什么这些小机构要怎么做呢？ 是因为你帮我
你让我操作这个动作，你自己在平台上或微师开课的时候， 我可以在在平
台帮你免费做免费的推广， 或给你一些广告位，然后或者一些平台上的推
广， 我可以给你，但你必须把一百万买回来，一般不会给他钱，是它，你
自己投一百万买回来，然后在后面我在市场上广告补给你，或怎么样把钱还


给你。是这样的模式。 这个时候跟谁学不会亏钱。就把一百万转一下，我
用广告位换你刷单的这个. 


 Right.  RMB 20,000 commission.  And the other RMB 980,000 they must use 
these virtual cell numbers or WeChat account numbers to purchase my classes, so 
that it becomes my revenues.  It’s like this.  This is one part.  In this way GSX 
will at least lose 2%, right?  This is one small part.  Another way is to work with 


																																																								
5 Prior to 2017, GSX’s focus was on working with schools and teachers. See GSX F-1, pp. 12, 68, 82, F-18. 


Page 12 of 25
the teachers… for example, as before I provide RMB 1,000,000, and then contract 
with them [to exchange] for ads, and you must take that RMB 1,000,000 and 
return it to me as purchases.  Why would they want to do that?  It’s because you 
help me do this thing, and when you yourself have a class on the platform or on 
Weishi (the App) we will help promote it for free, give free ads, or give you an ad 
placement, or on the platform run ads.  This we can give you, but you must return 
the RMB 1,000,000 in the form of purchases.  Normally they won’t pay any 
money (like a commission).  Its…you put in the RMB 1,000,000 and get it back 
as purchases, and then afterwards I provide ads in the marketplace for you, or 
otherwise provide you these funds.  Its this kind of model.  This way GSX does 
not lose money.  It just takes the RMB 1,000,000 and round trips it; we use ad 
placements in exchange for this brushing [bots or fake student users]. 


 
 
Summary Methodology for Accessing the Data and Analyzing Student and Bot Activity 
 
Analyzing Gaotu100.com and Genshuixue.com required two different approaches.  We provide a 
more detailed description of the steps in Appendix 1.   
 
The Genshuixue.com platform has both a website and a desktop application that students can 
use. Once a user signs up and logs in, the user opens Google Chrome Developer tools, turns on 
the Network tab, switches to XHR and sees data being passed between the browser and the 
Genshuixe.com website. Inside of this data there is a wealth of information including archives of 
every class session purchased, which is what we used to perform our analysis of bot activity on 
both platforms.6  There were no special tools or techniques required to perform this analysis.   
 
Gaotu100.com is very similar in design and functionality with Genshuixue and shares domain 
names and resources with Genshuixue. After setting up an account and purchasing classes, it is 
possible to see some data flowing in the browser much like is the case with Genshuixue. 
However, Gaotu’s data does not immediately show references to the class, so an additional step 
is required.  If using an iPhone, it is necessary to install the Gaotu100.com app on the phone and 
configure the device to send data through an intercepting HTTP proxy. This method enabled our 
data analyst to watch the messages between the phone and the GSX servers, see what data was 
passed back and forth, and determine the path to the class archives.  After locating the class 
archives, the files for each of our purchased classes were downloaded and examined.  
 
We were surprised to see that not only were there class materials, but there were files that 
contained copious information about the users including:7 
 
1. User Number 
2. Name 
3. Alternate Name 
4. Avatar 
																																																								
6  The archives are in a zip file. The file format is GZIP-compressed TAR archive (.tar.gz) otherwise known as a 
tarball. 
7 The data contained more than just this.  This is a partial list of the most useful fields presented for the users. 


Page 13 of 25
5. User Type (0,1,2) 
6. Course ID and/or Class ID (Gaotu only has Class ID’s) 
7. Class join and exit times 
8. IP address 
 
To conduct the analysis, our samples included over 200 paid K-12 classes purchased between 
January and March 2020, almost equally divided between Gaotu100.com and Genshuixue.com.  
The classes we obtained access to spanned K-12 grade levels and subject matter.  In total, we 
analyzed 463,217 logins made by 54,065 unique users (students, tutors, and teachers).  Gaotu 
was busier, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the logins. 
 
Within the class data, we found User Numbers (that are also displayed in the class attendance 
records) but also User Types.  By cross referencing the class data with data displayed in teacher 
and tutor pages on genshuixue.com, we found that 100% of the teachers listed on the 
genshuixue.com were marked as Type 1 users, and 100% of the tutors listed on genshuixue.com 
were marked Type 2 in our database.8  Identifying the Type was important to identifying GSX 
Linked Joiners.  For a more in-depth explanation of this methodology, please see Appendix 2. 
 
Our database of users, contains 29 Type 1’s (teacher), 371 Type 2’s (tutor), and 53,694 unique 
Type 0’s.9  Since we determined that all Type 1 and 2 users were with GSX, we conclude that all 
remaining Type 0 records are the student users (non-teacher, non-tutors). 
 


  
 
 
Chairman Chen’s $319 million Pledge: 
 
On March 3, 2020, Chairman Chen pledged 6,000,000 Class B ordinary shares through his entity 
Ebetter International Group Ltd.10  These are equivalent to 9,000,0000 ADSs with a market 
value of $319 million.11  Considering that GSX is a near total fraud, this pledge presents an even 
greater risk of sudden loss to GSX long holders.  We do not preclude the possibility that he has 
pledged other shares. 
 
The below is from the British Virgin Islands companies registry evidencing the pledge. 
 


																																																								
8 Gaotu100.com does not publish an up to date listing of teachers, only a poster-like yearbook style photo of some of 
their teachers. However, as all fields in our dataset between genshuixue.com and gaotu100.com are identical, we 
make the logical assumption that the Type field is identical between both platforms.   
9 Among the teachers and tutors, the data showed 6 individuals as both a Type 1 and Type 2.

Appendix 1: Methodology for Analyzing Student and Bot Activity 
 
Analyzing Gaotu100.com and Genshuixe.com required two different approaches, which we 
explain below.  
 
Genshuixe.com  
 
This platform has both a website and a desktop application that students can use. We did not 
analyze any mobile applications for this platform as it was not required. Once you have signed 
up with an account and have logged in you can simply open Google Chrome Developer tools, 
turn on the Network tab, switch to XHR and you can see data being passed between your 
browser and the Genshuixe.com website. Inside of this data there is a wealth of information 
including archives of every class session you have purchased which is what we used to perform 
our analysis of bot activity on both platforms.12 There were no special tools or techniques 
required to perform this analysis. 
 
To discover the archive, the following steps need to be completed from a Google Chrome 
Browser: 
 
1. Login to your account. 
2. Click on any of your courses that have classes that have already concluded. 
3. Click on a class view button (See screenshot below), and then select the playV2 item in 


the Chrome Developer Network view. Now look for pcURL value for each class in the 
course. Copy each of them. 
 


																																																								
12  The archives are in a zip file. The file format is GZIP-compressed TAR archive (.tar.gz) otherwise known as a 
tarball. 


Page 17 of 25
4. Keeping Google Chrome Developer tools open, paste the first pcURL value that you 
copied, and browse to it. You will see activity in your Network tab of Google Developer 
Tools. 
 


5. Click on the getPlaybackInfoV2 item in the network view and view the data on the right 
hand panel.  
 


Page 18 of 25
6. Continue to look through the data until you see a package_signal entry. This will now 
contain the URL for the archive file: 
 





7. You can now download that zip file and use 7-zip on Windows or the native unzipping 
tools in Mac OSX to view the contents. 


 
Gaotu100.com 
 
Gaotu100.com is very similar in design and functionality of Genshuixue and shares a number of 
domain names and resources with Genshuixue.  Once you have signed up for an account, and 
purchased classes, you are able to start seeing some of the data flowing in your browser much 
like on Genshuixue.  However, there were no references to the class archives that we had seen on 
Genshuixue.com so further analysis was required. 
 
We installed the Gaotu100.com app on an Apple iPhone and configured the iPhone to send data 
through an intercepting HTTP proxy.  This allows us to watch the messages between our phone 


Page 19 of 25
and the GSX servers so we can see what data is being passed back and forth.  This analysis 
yielded the path to the class archives that were the same as Genshuixue. 
 
After discovering the class archives, we then downloaded the archive for each of our purchased 
classes, opened the file and examined the contents.  We were surprised to see that not only were 
there class materials, but there were files that contained information about the students, when 
they joined, and other details. 
 
Opening and inspecting the all.json file, gives us information about every student that joins, their 
user number, their IP address and a timestamp.  There is also other information about when that 
student exits a class, as well as other information related to actions the instructor is taking. 
 
The all.json file is also retrieved by your browser when you view a recorded session.   
 
By having IP addresses, timestamps, and user identifiers, we were able to perform data analysis 
and bot detection across a number of classes on both Genshuixue and Gaotu100.

Appendix 2: Methodology for Differentiating Teachers & Tutors from Student in the Data 
 
When examining the genshuixue.com website there is a listing of teachers and tutors on the following 
page: 
 
https://www.genshuixue.com/npc/teacherQualification 
 
Identifying Teachers by User Number 
 
On Genshuixue.com each teacher has their own profile page that you can visit. This differs from 
gaotu100.com which only has a large image of all of their teachers on their platform. When clicking on a 
teacher’s profile picture you are taken directly to their profile page. 
 





Note that the number that is shown in the URL is the teacher’s User Number. Each user on 
genshuixue.com and gaotu100.com have their own unique User Number. 


Page 21 of 25
Identifying Tutors by User Number 
 
Identifying tutors by their user number is slightly more difficult since tutors do not have their own profile 
pages. To find a tutor’s user number we have to do the following: 
 
1. Open Google Chrome Developer tools and browse to: 
https://www.genshuixue.com/npc/teacherQualification 
2. Click the Network tab. 
3. Click the XHR tab (this shows data that your browser is requesting). 
4. Filter on the word “assistant” (in English) and then refresh the page. 
5. You will see a request going out to: 
https://www.genshuixue.com/sapi/viewLogic/teacher/assistantTeacherList?appType=6&cursor=0&size=3
0&hasMore=true&subject=5 
6. By examining the data in the Preview pane of the Network response, you can see there is data that 
provides us with the User Number (it is called Teacher Number in the screenshot below) for a tutor. 
 


Page 22 of 25
Here we can see the tutor’s User Number (Teacher Number) is 330361798.  We can then look up that 
number in our database class records. 
 
Identifying All Teachers, Tutors and Students in Our Dataset 
 
Once we have the User Number, we are able to do direct queries in our database of classes, to examine 
what classes they were involved in, and their join/leave patterns for those classes.  When reviewing the 
teacher and tutor records from the website we noticed that there was a user “type” field that was present 
in both genshuixe.com and gaotu100.com records. 
 
After examining a number of records manually and matching them up with the User Numbers identified 
for teachers and tutors, we found that the user type field tells us teachers are identified as “Type=1, tutors 
as “Type=2” and students as “Type=0.”  In our dataset of 29 teachers and 371 tutors, 100% of the 
teachers listed on the genshuixue.com were marked as Type 1 users and100% of the tutors listed on 
genshuixue.com were marked Type 2 in our database.  All remaining records were Type 0 which we 
conclude are the student users (non-teacher, non-tutors).  Gaotu100.com does not publish an up to date 
listing of teachers, only a poster-like yearbook style photo of some of their teachers.  However, as all 
fields in our dataset between genshuixue.com and gaotu100.com are identical, we assume that the Type 
field is identical between both platforms. 
 


Page 23 of 25
We then performed queries for each particular type of user (Type 0, 1 and 2), and then cross checked all 
users to see which matched up to the same IP addresses used by the Type 1 and Type 2, the known 
teachers and tutors.  Below are examples of query results for a Type 1, Type 2, and Type 0. 
 
Query results for a Type 1 teacher: 
 


 
 
For the teacher above, we see their User Number is 813942178 and their name Teacher Zhang (张镇老师
) matches that in their teacher account.  In our data we also have an Avatar field (cut from above for 
formatting). This is the profile picture for an account. For the above user the Avatar URL is: 
https://imgs.genshuixue.com/176512378_yc9r2tpn.png 
 
This matches the face and profile picture of the teacher shown on the Genshuixue.com teacher page. 
 
Query Results for a Type 2 tutor:  
 


 
 
For the tutor 330361798 above, the Type field set to 2. The name is Little Yu Teacher (B岳雨豪~小雨老
师).  The “B” appears to be indicative of their assignment to the Beijing office.  The Avatar for this user 
is set to: https://imgs.genshuixue.com/114226777_z0vg9fku.jpeg 
 
This matches the profile picture of the tutor on the Genshuixue.com website.

Verifying Type 0 users are Students: 
 
We could not discover profiles for Students in the same way that Teachers have profiles.  Instead, we 
turned to reviews that we collected from Genshuixue.com to assist in validating that a Type 0 user is a 
Student.  We collected 948,158 reviews, and from those reviews we discovered 5,789 unique users 
making reviews in our user activity database that had written 29,245 reviews.  Of these a total of 5,787 
(99.9%) were student (Type 0) unique reviewers, with just 2 (0.03%) coming from teacher (Type 1) 
accounts.  There were no reviews discovered that were written by a tutor (Type 2) account.  We therefore 
are highly confident that a Type 0 user is a student.
