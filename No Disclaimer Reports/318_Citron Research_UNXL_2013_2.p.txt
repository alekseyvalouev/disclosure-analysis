UNIPIXEL: THE TRUTH AND
ONLY THE TRUTH … FOR
ONCE.


    Breaking News:  The 800 lb Gorilla just
entered the room 
LG, the enormous Korean semiconductor giant, is out
with a report they have developed a patterned metal-
mesh �lm for capacitive touchscreens that can be
printed at 3 nanometer width, which is about half the
claimed width of UniBoss technology.

(See “Ultra�ne Metal Mesh Film” section)


So maybe getting that $12 million deal with Kodak
wasn’t such a bad idea after all!  (Run, cash the check! )


 


  Time to Tell the Truth
Warren Bu�et once wrote his investors:


“In poker, if you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and don’t
know who the patsy is, it’s you.”


Unpixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) shareholders — you are
that patsy.

It is the opinion of Citron that Unipixel has transacted
away half of the future of Uniboss for the equivalent of
.80 cents a share — while selling stock at $32 a share
to the public.


After Citron reported on this last week as “Unipixel
sold half of Uniboss” Alvarez & Marsal immediately
issued a press release denying that Uniboss was
sold.  The company has now reduced demand for
material disclosure of this much-hyped transaction to a
ridiculous semantic game of evasive language.


So if Unipixel was not “sold”, they committed half the
revenues and/or half the profits in this deal to Kodak,
with exclusivity terms.  Whether it is a manufacturing
agreement with covenants, or a joint venture, either
way, Kodak has been extended rights via covenants to
participate materially in the profits of UniBoss.  These
obligations of Unipixel come at a price, and that price
provides a critical valuation data point for
UniPixel.  The company is doing everything it can to
prevent disclosure of these terms to the public…for a
reason.


Whatever the actual terms are, there's a contract here
and both parties have it.  How long can its terms be
kept secret from the investing public?  From the Kodak
side, which is in bankruptcy, all material agreements
are subject to approval of the creditors committee and
strict disclosure requirements.  The true nature of this
agreement is material to both companies, and both
companies have absolute obligations to shareholders
to disclose fully. 


It is Citron’s opinion that if the transaction with Kodak
doesn’t represent an asset sale of Uniboss, then it is
even worse:  Unipixel is not receiving any money but
is giving up half the profits.  In return, Kodak is helping
to fund CAPEX expenses in tranches, the conditions
of which are material, and is not committed to the full
$12 million commitment at this time.


Citron’s understanding of the material terms of this
deal has been confirmed in principle by comments of :

·         A director of a Alvarez & Marsal, a primary
player on Kodak’s creditor committee


·         An analyst, who has already modified his model
to reflect Unipixel’s sharing 50% of the profits from
Uniboss with another entity


·         UniPixel CEO Reed Killion himself, who has
commented on “equitably sharing profits of the
venture” (eg 50% is “equitable”)


We stand by the above statements.  


Citron calls upon Unipixel to do the right thing:  to
fully disclose all the terms of its agreement with
Kodak regarding revenues, investment,
obligations and covenants.  


Furthermore, we invite SEC scrutiny on this matter:  we
stand on the side of full disclosure of the
truth.  Uniboss has violated numerous SEC laws
regarding material disclosure. 


It is Citron’s opinion that Unipixel shareholders are
being intentionally duped.   The company has
compounded its violation by selling shares while
perpetuating an extended shadow game of
intentionally misleading semantics – at the exact time
that all shareholders need disclosure of this material
information.


If in fact Unipixel believes that Citron is lying to the
investing public, please sue us — we look forward to
deposing company executives and those at Alavarez &
Marsal to prove the truth. 


Unfortunately, we expect Unipixel to do the wrong
thing:  to script yet another analyst call, to redirect the
public’s focus is to the mythical “manufacturing capacity”
of a yet unbuilt facility, based on an unproven product,
which obviously needs a lot more technical development
before it ever sees the light of day.  Otherwise, why would
Kodak’s expertise be such a material a component of this
deal? 


Citron has contacted Alvarez and Marsal general
counsel three times for clarity on the agreement – all to
no response

Most disturbing, the lack of integrity in practicing full
disclosure of this deal only mirrors the same “over-
promise, under-deliver” management strategy that the
company has been dishing out to shareholders for
years.
