Bristow	Group:	Strong	Sell	Due	To	Misleading	Behavior,	Looming
Covenant	Violation,	And	Likely	Bankruptcy

Summary


It	appears	that	BRS	is	understating	its	remaining	UK	SAR	capital	commitments	by
almost	$200mm,	as	well	as	significantly	inflating	its	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin.


BRS	faces	a	near-term	cash	shortfall	of	over	$750mm	and	will	likely	violate	both
their	leverage	ratio	and	interest	coverage	ratio	covenants.


Due	to	deteriorating	market	conditions,	it	is	unlikely	that	BRS	will	be	able	to	raise	a
significant	amount	of	liquidity	via	helicopter	sales,	sale	leasebacks	and	capex
deferrals.


During	this	recent	downturn,	BRS	management	has	on	various	occasions	acted	in	a
highly	questionable	and	seemingly	misleading	manner.


Given	their	looming	covenant	issues	and	large	liquidity	shortfall,	I	believe	BRS	will
eventually	go	bankrupt.	Thus,	BRS	is	a	tremendous	short	at	the	current	share	price.


Bristow	Group	("BRS"	or	the	"Company")	(NYSE:BRS)	primarily	provides	helicopter
transportation	services	to	the	offshore	oil	&	gas	industry.	About	a	year	ago,	towards	the
beginning	of	the	oil	industry	downturn,	the	Company	predicted	that	the	large	decline	in
offshore	E&P	spending	would	have	only	a	moderate	impact	on	their	business.	According
to	BRS	management,	the	decline	in	E&P	spending	would	mostly	affect	the	exploration	and
development	activities	of	its	clients,	while	production	activities	would	be	minimally
impacted.	Due	to	BRS's	much	larger	exposure	to	offshore	production	as	opposed	to
exploration	and	development,	management	stated	that	it	would	be	largely	shielded	from
this	downturn.


Unfortunately,	for	BRS	and	its	shareholders,	these	claims	by	management	have	proven	to
be	way	off	the	mark.	Contrary	to	management's	predictions,	the	large	reduction	in	E&P
spending	over	the	past	year	has	greatly	affected	the	Company's	financial	performance.	In
Q3	2016,	BRS	reported	a	21%	y-o-y	decline	in	revenue	from	their	oil	&	gas	clients.	Given
that	oil	&	gas	revenue	accounts	for	around	80%	of	their	consolidated	revenue,	this	large
decline	in	oil	&	gas	revenue	has	significantly	pressured	their	profitability	and	liquidity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 2/31


As	of	Q3	2016,	the	Company	had	just	$299mm	of	available	liquidity.	At	the	same	time,
according	to	the	Company's	Q3	2016	10-Q,	BRS	has	around	$1.3Bn	in	contractual
obligations	(aircraft	capex,	debt	principal	payments,	lease	payments,	other	obligations)
coming	due	over	the	next	2	¼	years.	Due	to	BRS's	deteriorating	financial	performance
and	overleveraged	balance	sheet,	the	Company's	ability	to	stay	solvent	is	in	question.


For	a	variety	of	reasons,	I	believe	that	BRS	has	little	chance	of	digging	itself	out	of	its
current	financial	hole.	For	starters,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	near-term	contractual
obligations	are	greater	than	what	management	is	portraying.	To	be	more	specific,	it	seems
that	management	has	misled	investors	regarding	the	amount	of	its	remaining	UK	SAR
commitments.	Based	on	information	in	public	filings,	it	appears	that	BRS's	remaining	UK
SAR	capital	commitments	are	almost	$200mm	greater	than	what	management	has
disclosed	to	shareholders.	Thus,	the	Company's	liquidity	situation	appears	to	be	even
more	challenging	than	what	investors	have	been	led	to	believe.


To	make	matters	worse,	it	appears	that	the	deterioration	in	BRS's	financial	performance
will	accelerate	over	the	next	couple	of	years.	This	accelerated	decline	in	financial
performance	will	be	driven	by	the	Company's	UK	SAR	and	oil	&	gas	businesses.	In
regards	to	the	Company's	UK	SAR	business,	I	believe	that	the	current	UK	SAR	EBITDAR
margin	of	67%	has	been	artificially	inflated	and	is	unsustainable.


Going	forward,	for	reasons,	which	I	will	later	explain,	I	expect	the	UK	SAR	EBITDAR
margin	to	eventually	decline	to	a	more	normalized	level	(mid-40s	margins).	Further
pressuring	BRS's	profitability	and	cash	flow	will	be	continued	declines	in	the	Company's
oil	&	gas	business.	In	calendar	year	2016	and	2017,	offshore	E&P	spending	is	expected	to
decrease	at	a	faster	rate	than	in	2015.	Thus,	it	is	likely	that	BRS's	revenue	from	oil	&	gas
clients	will	decline	at	an	accelerated	rate	over	the	next	couple	of	years.


This	accelerated	decline	in	BRS's	financial	performance	will	make	it	very	difficult	for	them
to	meet	their	significant	near-term	contractual	obligations.	In	fact,	over	the	next	2	¼	years,
I	project	that	the	Company's	cash	needs	will	exceed	their	cash	sources	by	over	$750mm.
In	addition	to	this	large	projected	liquidity	shortfall,	it	appears	that	BRS	is	on	the	verge	of
violating	both	its	leverage	ratio	and	interest	coverage	ratio	covenants.	Based	on	current
trends	in	their	business,	I	project	that	the	Company	will	likely	violate	its	covenants	within
the	next	12	months.	Such	a	violation	would	place	the	Company	in	technical	default	of	its
credit	agreement.	Thus,	based	on	BRS's	large	projected	cash	shortfall	and	looming
covenant	violations,	I	believe	it	is	likely	that	BRS	will	eventually	go	bankrupt.

In	order	to	escape	bankruptcy,	BRS	will	have	to	raise	a	large	amount	of	cash	in	a	short
period	of	time.	For	a	variety	of	reasons,	I	do	not	think	BRS	will	be	successful	in	this
endeavor.	Some	investors	are	hoping	that	BRS	will	be	able	to	boost	their	liquidity	via	used
helicopter	sales,	sale	leaseback	transactions	and	capex	cancellations/deferrals.	However,
based	on	my	diligence,	it	appears	that	the	Company	will	only	be	able	to	raise	a	modest
amount	of	liquidity	from	these	avenues.


Also,	given	the	Company's	already	overleveraged	balance	sheet	and	the	deteriorating
industry	environment,	it	is	doubtful	that	BRS	will	be	able	to	raise	additional	capital	from
lenders.	Finally,	during	this	recent	downturn,	BRS	management	has	acted	in	a	highly
questionable	and	seemingly	misleading	manner.	Given	their	questionable	behavior,	I	have
very	little	confidence	in	management's	abilities	to	successfully	navigate	the	Company
through	this	downturn.


Given	the	high	probability	of	bankruptcy,	I	believe	that	BRS	is	significantly	overvalued	at
the	current	share	price	of	$17.96	(as	of	5/9/16).	As	the	Company's	liquidity	problems
become	more	apparent,	I	would	expect	BRS's	stock	to	eventually	trade	more	in	line	with
that	of	a	distressed	company.	Significantly	distressed	companies	typically	trade	at	a	share
price	below	$5	per	share.	Thus,	I	have	assigned	a	short-term	price	target	of	$5	to	BRS
stock.	This	represents	a	72%	discount	to	the	current	share	price.	Over	time,	if	BRS	does
indeed	file	for	bankruptcy,	then	the	equity	will	likely	become	close	to	worthless.	Therefore,
I	believe	that	BRS	is	a	tremendous	short	at	the	current	share	price	level.


The	UK	SAR	Contract	Requires	Significant	Upfront	Capital	Investments


In	March	2013,	the	UK	Department	for	Transport	awarded	BRS	a	10-year,	$2.5Bn	contract
to	provide	search	and	rescue	("SAR")	services	in	the	UK.	Under	the	terms	of	the	contract,
BRS	will	operate	10	bases	and	22	helicopters	to	provide	SAR	services	across	the	country.
The	contract	includes	a	four-year	transition	phase	with	the	fully	implemented	contract
scheduled	to	begin	before	the	end	of	2017.	The	Company	initially	projected	that	it	would
spend	~$965mm	of	capital	to	get	all	10	SAR	bases	fully	operational.	On	slide	39	of	their
April	2013	Analyst	Day	presentation,	BRS	provided	a	detailed	breakdown	of	the	estimated
capital	commitments	for	the	UK	SAR	contract.	This	breakdown	is	provided	below:

As	shown	above,	the	Company	initially	estimated	that	it	would	spend	$645mm,	$125mm
and	$195mm	on	aircraft	(helicopters),	ground	infrastructure	&	equipment	and	capitalized
pre-operational	costs,	respectively,	during	the	contract's	transition	period.	BRS	expected
to	complete	most	of	its	capital	investments	by	2015	with	just	$160mm	in	combined	capital
expenses	(mostly	aircraft	capex)	projected	in	2016	and	2017.


On	August	7th,	2015,	the	Company	provided	an	update	in	their	Q1	2016	earnings
presentation	on	how	much	of	the	$965mm	in	commitments	had	been	spent	to	that	point.
The	following	is	from	slide	10	of	the	Company's	Q1	2016	earnings	presentation:


As	shown	above,	by	the	end	of	Q1	2016,	BRS	disclosed	that	it	had	spent	59%	or	$570mm
of	the	initial	estimate	of	$965mm	in	required	capital	investments.	Thus,	as	of	June	30th,
2015,	the	Company	had	$395mm	of	UK	SAR	capital	commitments	remaining
($965mm-$570mm).	The	$395mm	of	remaining	commitments	consisted	of	the	following:
$177mm	for	helicopter	purchases,	$73mm	for	infrastructure	investments	and	$145	for
capitalized	pre-operational	costs.


During	the	Barclays	Energy	Conference	on	September	8th,	2015,	BRS	disclosed	that	its
capital	commitments	for	the	UK	SAR	project	had	increased	by	$113mm.	The	reason	for
the	increase	was	due	to	certification	issues,	which	had	delayed	the	deployment	of	their
AW189	SAR	helicopters.	As	a	result	of	the	certification	issues,	the	Company	decided	to
purchase	three	additional	S-92	helicopters	for	$113mm	to	make	up	for	the	shortfall	in
AW189s.	Due	to	the	additional	S-92	purchases,	the	Company's	remaining	capital

commitments	increased	from	$395mm	to	$508mm.	I	have	provided	below	a	breakout	of
the	remaining	UK	SAR	capital	commitments	as	of	the	end	Q1	2016,	pro	forma	for	the
three	additional	S-92	purchases:


Over	six	months	later,	during	an	investor	presentation	on	March	22nd,	2016,	BRS
provided	its	latest	update	on	the	progress	of	its	UK	SAR	activities.	The	Company
disclosed	that,	as	of	Q3	2016,	just	$175mm	of	capital	commitments	were	remaining
to	complete	the	UK	SAR	rollout.	However,	as	I	will	detail	in	the	next	section,	it	appears
that	the	actual	amount	of	remaining	UK	SAR	capital	commitments	is	far	greater	than	what
management	is	currently	portraying.


Management	May	Be	Misleading	Investors	Regarding	Remaining	UK	SAR	Capex


I	believe	that	BRS	is	significantly	misrepresenting	the	amount	of	its	remaining	UK	SAR
capital	commitments.	Based	on	information	available	in	the	Company's	SEC	filings,	I
estimate	that	the	actual	amount	of	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	is	$367.4mm.
This	is	almost	$200mm	higher	than	the	Company's	estimate	of	$175mm.	As
discussed	in	the	previous	section,	the	Company	divides	its	UK	SAR	capital	commitments
into	three	buckets:	aircraft,	ground	infrastructure	&	equipment	and	capitalized	pre-
operational	costs.	To	arrive	at	my	estimate	of	$367.4mm	in	remaining	UK	SAR
commitments,	I	analyzed	how	much	BRS	has	spent	since	the	end	of	Q1	2016	on	each	of
these	three	buckets.	My	findings	from	this	research	are	provided	below.


First,	in	regards	to	aircraft	capex,	I	estimate	that	the	Company	spent	a	combined	total	of
$113.0mm	on	UK	SAR	aircraft	capex	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016.	The	amount	of	BRS's
remaining	UK	SAR	aircraft	commitments	is	reported	in	their	10-Q	filings.	To	compute	the
Company's	quarterly	UK	SAR	aircraft	capex,	I	simply	subtracted	the	amount	of	remaining
UK	SAR	aircraft	commitments	at	the	end	of	the	current	quarter	from	the	previous	quarter.
My	calculations	of	the	Company's	UK	SAR	aircraft	capex	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016	are
provided	in	the	figure	below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 6/31


Moving	on	to	the	next	capex	item,	I	estimate	that	BRS	spent	a	combined	total	of	$14.7mm
on	UK	SAR	ground	infrastructure	&	equipment	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016.	In	their	quarterly
filings,	the	Company	discloses	the	amount	of	its	YTD	infrastructure	capex.	To	calculate	UK
SAR	infrastructure	capex	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	I	subtracted	YTD	Q1	infrastructure
capex	from	YTD	Q3	infrastructure	capex.	From	this	amount,	I	then	subtracted	the
estimated	maintenance-related	infrastructure	capex	during	that	time	period.	My
calculations	of	the	Company's	combined	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016	infrastructure	capex	are
provided	below:


Finally,	in	regards	to	capitalized	pre-operational	costs,	it	appears	that	BRS	spent	a
combined	total	of	$13.1mm	on	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016.
Pre-operational	costs	are	capitalized	on	BRS's	balance	sheet	and	then	amortized	as	an
expense	in	the	P&L	over	the	life	of	the	UK	SAR	contract.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison
of	the	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	on	BRS's	balance	sheet	as	of	Q1	2016	and	Q3
2016:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 7/31


As	shown	above,	as	of	Q1	2016,	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	included	in	prepaid
expenses	was	$13.1mm.	Prepaid	expenses	are	classified	as	a	current	asset	on	BRS's
balance	sheet.	This	means	that	the	entire	$13.1mm	of	capitalized	pre-operational	costs
should	be	amortized	over	a	period	of	one	year	or	less.	Thus,	over	a	half	year	period	from
the	end	of	Q1	2016	to	Q3	2016,	I	estimate	that	$6.6mm	($13.1mm	*	50%)	of	capitalized
pre-operational	costs	were	amortized	in	the	P&L.	Assuming	$6.6mm	of	total	amortized
pre-operational	expenses,	I	estimate	that	BRS	spent	$13.1mm	in	capitalized	pre-
operational	costs	since	Q1	2016:


Putting	it	all	together,	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	I	estimate	that	BRS	spent	a	total	of
$140.8mm	in	UK	SAR	related	capital	investments	($113.0mm	in	aircraft	capex,	$14.7mm
in	ground	infrastructure	&	equipment	and	$13.1mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs).
At	the	end	of	Q1	2016,	the	Company	had	$508.1mm	in	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments.
By	subtracting	$140.8mm	from	$508.1mm,	I	estimate	the	Company	should	still	have
$367.4mm	in	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments.	By	comparison,	BRS	disclosed	that	it	had
just	$175mm	in	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	at	the	end	of	Q3	2016.	Thus,	I	estimate
that	the	Company's	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	are	$192.4mm	higher	than	what
management	has	communicated	to	investors.


Inflated	Financial	Performance	Of	UK	SAR	Business	Is	Another	Concern


In	addition	to	misrepresenting	its	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments,	it	appears	that	the
Company	may	be	artificially	inflating	the	financial	performance	of	the	UK	SAR	business.	In
BRS's	Q3	2015	10-Q,	the	Company	provided	the	following	information	regarding	the



http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=10455282-954-366828&type=sect&TabIndex=2&companyid=8336&ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcik%253d73887

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 8/31


expected	financial	contributions	of	the	UK	SAR	contract:


"We	expect	the	U.K.	SAR	contract	to	generate	operating	revenue,	adjusted
EBITDAR	and	BVA	of	approximately	$2.5	billion,	$1.1	billion	and	$300	million,
respectively,	over	the	contract	term…"


Based	on	the	above	quote,	the	Company	expects	the	UK	SAR	business	to	generate	total
revenue	of	$2.5Bn,	total	EBITDAR	of	$1.1Bn	and	an	average	EBITDAR	margin	of	44%
over	the	duration	of	the	contract.	In	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2016,	the	actual	financial
performance	of	the	UK	SAR	business	from	a	profitability	perspective	has	far	exceeded
management's	expectations.	More	specifically,	the	EBITDAR	margin	of	the	UK	SAR
business	has	been	significantly	higher	than	the	expected	margin	of	44%.	Provided	below
is	the	financial	performance	of	the	Company's	UK	SAR	business	from	Q1	2016	to	Q3
2016:


As	shown	above,	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	has	been	meaningfully	higher	than	44%
throughout	FY	2016.	In	addition	to	this,	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	has	increased
considerably	as	the	year	has	progressed	from	50%	in	Q1	2016	to	almost	67%	in	Q3	2016.
The	significantly	higher	than	expected	UK	SAR	margin	leads	to	the	question	of	whether
this	margin	performance	is	sustainable.	In	my	opinion,	I	do	not	believe	that	it	is.	As	I	will
explain	below,	there	is	a	good	amount	of	information	to	suggest	that	BRS's	UK	SAR
margin	is	significantly	inflated	and	unsustainable	at	the	current	level.


Going	back	to	the	table	above,	from	Q1	2016	to	Q3	2016,	quarterly	UK	SAR	revenue
increased	$19.7mm	from	$17.2mm	in	Q1	2016	to	$36.9mm	in	Q3	2016.	During	that	same
time	period,	UK	SAR	operating	expenses	increased	$3.6mm	from	$8.6mm	in	Q1	2016	to
$12.2mm	in	Q3	2016.	Thus,	despite	UK	SAR	revenue	more	than	doubling	and
increasing	by	nearly	$20mm,	operating	expenses	increased	just	$3.6mm	over	the
same	time	period.

The	fact	that	operating	expenses	increased	such	a	small	amount	despite	a	more	than
doubling	of	revenue	makes	little	sense.	It	is	especially	puzzling	considering	the	Company
has	launched	three	new	UK	SAR	bases	over	the	past	two	quarters.	This	increase	in	total
SAR	bases	from	6	to	9	should	have	meaningfully	increased	the	Company's	operating
expenses.	Overall,	the	minimal	growth	in	UK	SAR	operating	expenses	over	the	past	two
quarters	is	a	strong	indication	that	the	Company's	current	UK	SAR	margin	may	be
significantly	inflated.


So	how	has	BRS	been	able	to	prop-up	its	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin?	A	large	contributor
to	BRS's	inflated	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	has	been	their	significant	underinvestment	in
capitalized	pre-operational	costs.	Provided	in	the	figure	below	is	a	breakdown	of	the
Company's	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	as	of	Q1	2016.	This	same	figure	was
provided	earlier	in	the	first	section	of	this	article.


As	of	the	end	of	Q1	2016,	BRS	had	spent	$50mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs.	As
discussed	in	the	previous	section,	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	I	estimate	that	the	Company
spent	an	additional	$13mm	on	capitalized	pre-operational	costs.	In	total,	as	of	the	end	of
Q3	2016,	I	estimate	that	the	Company	has	invested	a	total	of	$63mm	($50mm	+	$13mm)
in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs.	BRS	originally	expected	to	invest	a	total	of	$195mm	in
capitalized	pre-operational	costs	by	the	end	of	Q3	2016.	Thus,	the	Company	has
underinvested	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	by	$132mm	($195mm-$63mm)	relative
to	its	original	forecast.


Capitalized	pre-operational	costs	are	amortized	as	an	expense	in	the	P&L	over	the	life	of
the	UK	SAR	contract	(10	years).	By	underinvesting	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	by
$132mm,	the	Company	has	reduced	its	UK	SAR	operating	expenses	by	over	$13mm
($132mm/10	years)	on	an	annual	basis	and	over	$3mm	on	a	quarterly	basis.	The
comparison	provided	below	illustrates	the	degree	to	which	underinvestment	in	pre-
operational	costs	has	inflated	the	Company's	Q3	2016	UK	SAR	results:

As	shown	above,	assuming	an	additional	$132mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs,	Q3
2016	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	would	have	been	almost	9%	lower	at	58.0%	instead	of
66.9%.	At	the	same	time,	Q3	2016	EBITDAR	would	have	declined	by	over	$3mm	from
$24.7mm	to	$21.4mm.	Said	another	way,	on	an	annualized	basis,	the	Company's
underinvestment	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	has	inflated	UK	SAR	EBITDAR
and	EBITDAR	margin	by	around	$13mm	and	9%,	respectively.


Although	underinvesting	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	has	significantly	inflated	the
UK	SAR	margin,	it	does	not	fully	explain	why	the	UK	SAR	margin	has	been	so	much
higher	than	expected.	Even	after	assuming	$132mm	in	additional	capitalized	costs,	the
pro	forma	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	of	58%	is	still	well	above	the	expected	margin	of
44%.	I	suspect	that,	in	addition	to	underinvesting	in	pre-operational	costs,	the	Company
may	be	aggressively	deferring	other	costs	in	order	to	further	boost	margins.	Unfortunately,
at	this	time,	there	is	not	enough	publicly	available	information	to	know	for	certain.


That	being	said,	recent	management	comments	seem	to	confirm	that	the	UK	SAR
EBITDAR	margins	are	indeed	unsustainable.	For	example,	during	the	Company's	Q2
2016	earnings	call,	an	analyst	asked	management	whether	the	Company	could	sustain
the	current	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	of	60%+.	To	this	question,	management	replied	by
stating	the	following:


"Nothing	has	changed.	We	still	believe	we	will	command	the	margins	we	disclosed
over	the	long	run.	And	the	program	itself	is	up	and	running	mostly."


Based	on	the	above	comments,	it	appears	that	management	expects	the	UK	SAR
EBITDAR	margin	to	eventually	trend	closer	to	the	expected	44%	margin	that	they
disclosed	in	their	public	filings.	This	provides	further	evidence	that	the	Company's	UK
SAR	margin	is	significantly	inflated	and	will	eventually	fall	to	a	more	normalized	level	over
the	long	term.

Issues	With	UK	SAR	Contract	Raises	Several	Red	Flags


The	fact	that	BRS	may	be	misrepresenting	the	remaining	capital	commitments	and
inflating	the	financial	performance	of	its	UK	SAR	business	carries	many	negative
implications	for	shareholders.	For	starters,	if	the	Company	is	misrepresenting	its
remaining	UK	SAR	commitments,	it	would	mean	that	BRS's	liquidity	issues	are	worse	than
expected.	As	of	the	end	Q3	2016,	the	Company	had	just	$299mm	of	remaining	liquidity,
which	consisted	of	$167mm	in	revolver	borrowing	capacity	and	$132mm	of	cash.	As
highlighted	in	the	red	box	below,	over	the	next	2	¼	years,	the	Company	has	contractual
obligations	totaling	over	$1.3Bn:


Given	the	Company's	large	debt	load	and	limited	remaining	liquidity,	BRS	will	likely
struggle	to	meet	the	near-term	contractual	obligations	listed	above.	Unfortunately	for
shareholders,	the	obligations	listed	above	do	not	take	into	account	the	almost	$200mm	in
incremental	UK	SAR	commitments	that	I	have	identified.	When	the	incremental	UK	SAR
commitments	are	taken	into	account,	BRS's	ability	to	stay	solvent	becomes	even	more
questionable.


In	addition	to	increased	worries	over	liquidity,	if	the	current	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	of
67%	reverts	to	the	expected	average	of	44%,	this	will	significantly	pressure	the
Company's	already	deteriorating	financial	performance.	The	analysis	provided	below
illustrates	the	impact	that	a	decline	in	the	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	margin	would	have	on	BRS's
financial	performance:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 12/31


As	shown	above,	at	the	current	revenue	run	rate,	a	decline	in	the	UK	SAR	margin	from
67%	to	the	expected	margin	of	44%	would	result	in	a	$33.9mm	decline	in	annual	UK	SAR
EBITDAR.	In	Q3	2016,	the	Company	reported	a	total	consolidated	EBITDAR	of	$109.2mm
(excluding	income	from	unconsolidated	affiliates)	which	represents	$436.9mm	of
EBITDAR	on	a	run-rate	basis.	Therefore,	a	$33.9mm	decline	in	UK	SAR	EBITDAR	would
decrease	BRS's	consolidated	run	rate	EBITDAR	by	almost	8%	($33.9mm	/	$436.9mm).
Considering	the	Company's	liquidity	issues	and	the	increasingly	challenging	environment
for	helicopter	operators,	an	8%	reduction	in	annual	EBITDAR	could	be	devastating	for
BRS.


Finally,	the	concerns	that	I	have	highlighted	regarding	the	UK	SAR	business	call	into
question	the	integrity	of	management.	The	fact	that	management	may	be	willingly
misrepresenting	its	UK	SAR	business	to	shareholders	is	a	very	concerning	development.
If	true,	then	this	could	be	a	concern	for	regulators.	Perhaps	this	is	simply	a	case	of	poor
communication	by	management.	However,	based	on	some	of	the	evidence,	I	do	not
believe	this	to	be	the	case.	For	example,	consider	the	following	exchange	between	a
research	analyst	and	John	Baliff	(BRS's	CEO)	during	the	Company's	Q2	2016	earnings
call:
7/18/2019 Bristow Group: Strong Sell Due To Misleading Behavior, Looming Covenant Violation, And Likely Bankruptcy - Bristow Group Inc. (NYSE:BRS) | Se…

Analyst:	"You	all	also	do	have	some	non-aircraft	related	capital	expenditures	as	well
as	some	infrastructure	spend	I	think	still	outstanding	on	SAR.	Any	way	to	get	a
sense	for	what	those	numbers	look	like	next	six	months	and	subsequent	fiscal
year?"


Mr.	Baliff:	"…	in	our	first	quarter	slide	we	gave	you	an	update	in	terms	of	where
we	stand	and	we've	made	substantial	progress	towards	that	in	terms	of	dollar
amounts.	Jeremy,	I'm	trying	to	think,	we	really	only	have	what	two	more	bases	to	be
opened	this	year,	one	more	base	in	the	following	year.	And	that's	yes,	and	that's
really	about	it	Daniel,	in	terms	of	substantial	CAPEX	and	additional	obligations	as	it
relates	to	spend	here.	What	you're	seeing	though	just	to	kind	of	remind	you,	is
that	the	form	of	some	this	spend	actually	shows	up	in	our	financial	statements
in	the	operating	cash	flow	line,	in	terms	of	prepaid	costs	and	other	expenses.
So	that	is	running	through	our	cash	flow	statement	in	that	form."


As	highlighted	above,	when	asked	how	much	non-aircraft	UK	SAR	commitments
remained,	Mr.	Baliff	stated	that	they	"had	made	substantial	progress"	since	Q1	2016	and
implied	that	only	a	modest	amount	of	commitments	remained.	He	also	implied	that	a	good
portion	of	the	capital	that	they	had	spent	on	non-aircraft	UK	SAR	commitments	since	Q1
2016	was	in	the	form	of	capitalized	prepaid	costs.	As	I	have	shown	previously	in	this
article,	these	statements	by	Mr.	Baliff	do	not	appear	to	be	true.


For	starters,	contrary	to	Mr.	Baliff's	claims,	the	Company	has	not	made	substantial
progress	in	regards	to	completing	its	non-aircraft	commitments.	Since	Q1	2016,	I	estimate
that	BRS	has	spent	just	$27.8mm	on	ground	infrastructure	&	equipment	and	capitalized
pre-operational	costs.	Thus,	as	of	Q3	2016,	the	Company	still	has	significant	remaining
non-aircraft	commitments.	In	addition	to	this,	Mr.	Baliff's	claim	that	much	of	their	UK	SAR
expenses	since	Q1	2016	have	been	in	the	form	of	prepaid	costs	is	also	questionable.
Since	Q1	2016,	I	estimate	the	Company	only	spent	around	$13.1mm	in	capitalized	pre-
operational	costs.	These	seemingly	misleading	statements	strongly	support	my	concerns
regarding	the	conduct	of	management.


Further	Declines	Projected	In	Offshore	Oil	&	Gas	Industry


Unfortunately,	for	BRS	shareholders,	the	Company's	issues	extend	far	beyond	the	UK
SAR	contract.	Over	the	past	two	years,	the	steep	decline	in	the	price	of	oil	has	forced	the
oil	majors	to	reduce	their	offshore	capex	spending.	BRS	generates	~79%	of	its	revenue

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 14/31


from	providing	helicopter	transport	services	to	the	offshore	oil	&	gas	industry.	Due	to
BRS's	significant	exposure	to	the	offshore	industry,	the	reduction	in	offshore	E&P
spending	has	greatly	pressured	the	Company's	liquidity	and	profitability.


Although	2015	was	a	challenging	year	for	offshore	service	providers,	the	cuts	to	offshore
E&P	budgets	were	not	as	pronounced	as	in	other	oil	&	gas	sectors.	The	relative	strength
of	the	offshore	sector	was	largely	attributed	to	the	ironclad	nature	of	offshore	rig	contracts.
However,	according	to	a	September	2015	Oil	&	Gas	Journal	article,	2016	and	beyond	are
projected	to	be	a	different	story	as	many	of	these	rigs	begin	to	come	off	contract:


"While	cuts	to	E&P	budgets	were	pronounced	in	2015,	the	offshore	sector	was
somewhat	shielded	from	the	ironclad	nature	of	offshore	rig	contracts…	But	the	next
several	years	will	be	a	different	story	as	rigs	start	to	roll	off	contract,	with	very	few
being	recontracted	in	the	current	environment."


So	how	much	further	will	the	offshore	helicopter	transport	industry	deteriorate	over	the
next	couple	years?	According	to	recent	reports,	the	answer	to	this	question	appears	to	be
"quite	a	bit."	In	a	January	2016	E&P	Magazine	article,	the	following	forecast	for	offshore
E&P	spending	is	provided:


"Some	international	oil	companies	have	cut	exploration	spending	and	moved	frontier
programs	further	down	on	agendas,	while	others	have	left	areas	altogether	or
renegotiated	contracts,	including	newbuild	delivery	dates,	to	steady	financial	footing.
Lower	day	rates	along	with	reduced	services	and	subsea	costs,	could	push	offshore
spending	down	by	20%	to	25%	in	2016,	Barclays	said	in	its	global	E&P	spending
outlook.	This	follows	an	estimated	16%	spending	decline	in	2015."


Based	on	this	report,	it	appears	that	offshore	E&P	spending	will	decline	at	a	faster	rate	in
2016	than	in	2015.	As	highlighted	in	the	quote	above,	offshore	E&P	spending	is	projected
to	decline	20%-25%	in	2016	versus	an	estimated	16%	spending	decline	in	2015.	These
cuts	to	E&P	spending	are	expected	to	lead	to	a	significant	reduction	in	offshore
exploration	and	development	activities.	As	a	result,	BRS's	oil	&	gas	revenue	from
servicing	exploration	and	development	activities	will	likely	decline	by	a	substantial	amount.


To	make	matters	worse,	in	addition	to	a	large	projected	decline	in	exploration	and
development	activities,	offshore	production	activities	are	also	expected	to	come	under
pressure.	In	2015,	offshore	production	remained	relatively	unaffected	by	the	steep	decline

in	oil	prices.	However,	beginning	in	2016,	it	appears	that	offshore	production	activities	will
begin	to	feel	the	effects	of	reduced	E&P	investments.	According	to	an	October	2015
Reuters	article,	offshore	production	in	aging	fields	will	meaningfully	decline	in	2016:


"Global	offshore	oil	production	in	aging	fields	will	fall	by	10	percent	next	year
as	producers	abandon	field	upgrades	at	the	fastest	rate	in	30	years,	in	the	first	clear
sign	of	output	cuts	outside	the	U.S.	shale	industry…	Data	provided	exclusively	to
Reuters	by	Rystad	show	a	sharp	decline	in	investment	to	upgrade	mature	offshore
oil	fields	in	order	to	arrest	their	natural	decline,	in	what	is	known	as	infill	drilling."


Due	to	a	steep	decline	in	infill	drilling,	offshore	production	from	aging	oilfields	is	expect	to
decline	by	10%	in	2016.	In	2015,	aging	oilfields	produced	an	average	of	15	million	bpd,
which	represented	60%	of	the	total	average	offshore	production	of	25	million	bpd.	Given
that	aging	oilfields	account	for	such	a	large	percentage	of	offshore	output,	a	10%	decline
in	aging	oilfield	production	will	have	a	meaningful	negative	impact	on	offshore	service
providers.


Based	on	the	information	provided	above,	it	seems	likely	that	2016	will	be	a	much	more
challenging	year	than	2015.	A	20%-25%	reduction	in	E&P	spending	(versus	a	16%
reduction	in	2015)	will	likely	lead	to	an	accelerated	decline	in	the	demand	for	offshore
helicopter	services.	In	addition	to	this,	both	offshore	exploration	and	development	and
offshore	production	activities	are	expected	to	decline	substantially	in	2016.	This	is	in
contrast	to	2015,	where	the	decline	in	E&P	spending	mostly	affected	their	exploration	and
development	activities.


Finally,	to	top	it	all	off,	oil	&	gas	companies	will	continue	to	try	and	find	other	ways	to
reduce	their	costs.	This	could	lead	to	pricing	pressure	and	further	volume	declines	in	the
future.	For	example,	many	oil	&	gas	companies	have	recently	begun	to	share	helicopters
as	a	cost	saving	measure.	It	also	worth	keeping	in	mind	that	the	projected	20%-25%
decline	in	E&P	spending	is	based	on	crude	oil	trading	at	around	$45	per	barrel.	If	crude	oil
stays	below	$45,	then	the	cuts	to	E&P	capex	could	be	even	greater	than	25%.


Perhaps	the	biggest	problem	that	offshore	helicopter	operators	face	is	the	fact	that	this
downturn	is	likely	to	last	for	several	years.	According	to	industry	insiders,	the	offshore
industry	is	unlikely	to	improve	anytime	soon.	For	example,	in	BRS's	Q3	2016,	the
Company	states	the	following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 16/31


"We	continue	to	expect	this	"lower	for	longer"	oil	price	environment	to	persist	through
calendar	year	2017	with	significant	uncertainty	thereafter	on	when	a	recovery	will
occur."


If	oil	prices	recover,	the	shale	sector	will	likely	be	the	first	sector	to	recover.	The	reason	is
because	the	upfront	drilling	costs	required	for	shale	production	is	significantly	less	than
the	offshore	sector.	Many	oil	&	gas	companies	currently	have	significantly	overleveraged
balance	sheets.	As	a	result,	these	companies	cannot	afford	to	spend	large	amounts	of
capex	on	risky	offshore	drilling	projects.


Instead,	it	will	make	more	sense	for	them	to	focus	on	rebuilding	their	balance	sheets
through	lower	cost	and	lower	risk	shale	drilling.	For	example,	Chevron	recently	announced
that	it	would	cut	offshore	spending	by	an	additional	36%	in	2017	and	2018	compared	to
2016.	Additionally,	ConocoPhillips	announced	that	it	planned	to	end	all	of	its	deepwater
exploration	activities	by	2017.	Given	these	recent	announcements	by	some	of	the	oil
majors,	it	appears	that	the	slump	in	the	offshore	space	could	last	well	beyond	2017.


Bristow's	Financial	Performance	Will	Likely	Deteriorate	Significantly


Over	the	past	year,	BRS's	financial	performance	has	been	pressured	by	a	large	decrease
in	their	oil	&	gas	business.	However,	the	significant	growth	in	their	UK	SAR	business	has
helped	to	offset	a	good	portion	of	this	decline.	Provided	below	is	a	y-o-y	comparison	of
Bristow's	Q3	2015	and	Q3	2016	consolidated	financials:

business.	Provided	below	is	a	y-o-y	comparison	of	BRS's	Q3	2016	and	Q3	2015	financials
excluding	the	UK	SAR	business.	This	figure	has	been	labeled	as	"Figure	A"	for	discussion
purposes.


As	shown	in	Figure	A	above,	consolidated	revenue	excluding	UK	SAR	declined	$72.1mm
or	16.7%	y-o-y	from	$430.3mm	in	Q3	2015	to	$358.3mm	in	Q3	2016.	As	a	result	of	this
large	revenue	decline,	EBITDAR	and	EBITDA	also	declined	by	$25.5mm	and	$27.7mm,
respectively.	This	large	decline	in	financial	performance	was	due	to	a	21%	y-o-y	decline	in
revenue	from	oil	&	gas	clients.	In	Q3	2016,	revenue	from	oil	&	gas	clients	declined	over
$80mm	from	$383mm	in	Q3	2015	to	$302mm	in	Q3	2016.

As	shown	in	Figure	B	above,	the	financial	performance	of	the	UK	SAR	segment	has	been
much	stronger	than	the	rest	of	business.	In	Q3	2015,	the	Company	did	not	generate	any
revenue	from	its	UK	SAR	business.	Since	then,	the	Company's	UK	SAR	business	has
reported	increasing	revenue,	EBITDAR	and	EBITDA	in	each	successive	quarter.	Q3	2016
represented	the	strongest	quarter	yet	for	the	UK	SAR	business.	In	Q3	2016,	the
Company's	UK	SAR	business	generated	revenue,	EBITDAR	and	EBITDA	of	$36.9mm,
$24.7mm	and	$7.8mm	respectively.	Further	boosting	the	UK	SAR	results	has	been	the
large	increase	in	EBITDAR	margin	from	50%	in	Q1	2016	to	67%	in	Q3	2016.


Thus	far,	in	FY	2016,	the	large	increase	in	UK	SAR	revenue	and	profitability	has	offset	a
good	amount	of	the	decline	in	oil	&	gas	revenue.	However,	going	forward,	this	large
growth	in	UK	SAR	revenue	and	EBITDAR	in	FY	2016	is	not	expected	to	be	repeated.	As	a
result,	I	believe	that	FY	2017	results	for	the	consolidated	business	will	decline	significantly
versus	FY	2016.


Since	Q4	2016	results	are	not	yet	available,	I	have	used	run-rate	Q3	2016	results	as	a
basis	for	my	FY	2017	financial	projections.	As	shown	below,	on	a	run-rate	basis,	the
Company's	Q3	2016	consolidated	revenue,	EBITDAR	and	EBITDA	was	$1.6Bn,
$436.9mm	and	$228.1mm,	respectively.


My	FY	2017	projection	is	primarily	based	on	my	estimate	for	the	oil	&	gas	business.	In	Q3
2016,	oil	&	gas	revenue	accounted	for	$302mm	or	76%	of	consolidated	revenue.	For	FY
2017,	I	have	estimated	that	oil	&	gas	revenue	will	decline	by	another	25%	relative	to	run-
rate	Q3	2016.	This	decline	is	4%	higher	than	the	21%	y-o-y	decline	in	Q3	2016.	I	believe
that	this	is	a	fair	assumption	given	that	offshore	E&P	spending	and	production	declines	in
calendar	year	2016	are	expected	to	exceed	those	in	2015.	In	Q3	2016,	run-rate	oil	&	gas
revenue	was	$1.2Bn.	Assuming	a	25%	decline	from	Q3	2016's	run-rate,	I	project	oil	&	gas
revenue	to	decline	by	$300mm	to	$900mm	in	FY	2017.

As	shown	in	Figure	A,	a	$72.1mm	decline	in	Q3	2016	revenue	resulted	in	a	$25.5mm
decline	in	EBITDAR.	In	other	words,	the	amount	of	EBITDAR	decline	relative	to	the
revenue	decline	was	around	35%	($25.5mm	/	$72.1mm).	About	a	year	ago,	the	Company
instituted	a	major	cost	restructuring	program,	which,	to	this	point,	has	reduced	annualized
costs	by	over	$110mm.	In	FY	2017,	it	will	be	very	difficult	for	BRS	to	reduce	costs	by	a
similar	amount	given	that	much	of	the	low-hanging	fruit	has	already	been	cut.	Therefore,	I
project	that	the	amount	of	EBITDAR	decline	as	a	%	of	the	oil	&	gas	revenue	decline	will
increase	to	40%.	Multiplying	a	projected	$300mm	decline	in	oil	&	gas	revenue	by	40%
results	in	a	projected	oil	&	gas	EBITDAR	decline	of	$120mm.


In	regards	to	UK	SAR	and	BRS's	other	miscellaneous	business	segments,	I	project	that
EBITDAR	for	these	combined	businesses	will	be	flat	relative	to	run-rate	Q3	2016.	I	believe
that	this	is	a	fair	and	perhaps	generous	assumption	given	that	a	decline	in	UK	SAR
EBITDAR	margin	from	67%	to	its	expected	average	of	44%	would	result	in	a	~$34mm
decline	in	annual	EBITDAR.	Putting	it	all	together,	I	have	provided	below	my	projection	for
FY	2017	consolidated	EBITDAR:


Bristow	Faces	A	Large	Cash	Shortfall


I	believe	that	BRS	will	soon	face	a	severe	liquidity	crisis.	Based	on	BRS's	expected	cash
flow	generation	and	current	available	liquidity,	it	appears	that	the	Company	will	be	unable
to	meet	its	significant	near-term	cash	obligations.	More	specifically,	from	Q4	2016	to	the
end	of	FY	2018,	I	project	that	the	Company's	cash	uses	will	exceed	their	cash	sources	by
$767.7mm.	The	details	of	how	I	arrived	at	my	cash	shortfall	projection	are	given	below.


As	calculated	in	the	previous	section,	I	expect	BRS	to	generate	$316.9mm	of	consolidated
EBITDAR	in	FY	2017.	Assuming	$316.9mm	in	annual	consolidated	EBITDAR,	I	have
provided	below	my	estimate	for	the	Company's	annual	operating	cash	flow:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 20/31


As	shown	above,	I	estimate	that	BRS	will	generate	$69.9mm	of	annual	operating	cash
flow.	In	regards	to	BRS's	cash	obligations,	I	have	listed	below	the	Company's	total	capital
commitments	over	the	next	2	¼	years	(Q4	FY	2016	to	the	end	of	FY	2018).	Note	that	I
have	excluded	lease	and	interest	payments	from	this	table	as	these	items	are	already
taken	into	account	in	my	annual	operating	cash	flow	calculation.	Also,	this	analysis
includes	the	$192mm	in	additional	UK	SAR	commitments,	which	I	highlighted	at	the
beginning	of	this	article.


Finally,	putting	it	all	together,	I	have	provided	below	my	projection	for	the	Company's	total
cash	shortfall	over	the	next	2	¼	years.	Note	that	I	have	assumed	that	annual	operating
cash	flow	remains	flat	at	$69.9mm	during	this	time	period.	This	may	be	generous	given
the	further	E&P	capex	reductions	projected	in	calendar	year	2017	and	2018.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 21/31


Thus,	according	to	the	above	analysis,	BRS	faces	a	total	cash	shortfall	of	$767.7mm
over	the	next	2	¼	years.	Given	this	huge	shortfall,	the	Company's	ability	to	stay	solvent
over	the	next	couple	of	years	is	highly	questionable.


Bristow	Will	Likely	Trip	Their	Covenants	In	FY	2017


During	BRS's	Q3	2016	earnings	call,	Don	Miller	(BRS's	CFO)	stated	the	following	when
asked	about	the	Company's	current	covenant	situation:


"…you	know,	we	amended	our	covenants	back	in	late	September.	And	as	of
December	31	we	were	still	in	compliance	with	the	original	covenant	levels	on	both
max	leverage	ratio	and	the	minimum	interest	ratio.	So,	we're	pleased	with	that.	And
that's	really	reflective	of	our	underlying	business	model	and	the	cash	we	can
generate."


Based	on	this	quote,	Mr.	Miller	seems	confident	that	the	Company	does	not	have	any
looming	covenant	issues.	However,	the	optimistic	picture	that	Mr.	Miller	is	painting	for
analysts	is	far	different	from	what	is	portrayed	in	the	Company's	most	recent	10-Q.	In
BRS's	Q3	2016	10-Q,	the	Company	provided	the	following	disclosure	in	regards	to	their
covenants:


"…management	expects	that	the	Company	will	continue	to	be	in	compliance	with	its
financial	covenants	in	its	senior	secured	credit	agreements;	however,	such
expectations	are	based	on	various	assumptions	about	our	business	including	the
impact	of	crude	oil	prices	and	other	factors	beyond	our	control	and	our	ongoing	and
planned	cost	reduction	efforts	and	cash	savings	or	capital	deferral	efforts	in	fiscal
years	2016	and	2017.	In	the	event	the	Company	were	not	in	compliance	with	the
financial	covenants	in	its	senior	secured	credit	agreements,	there	can	be	no
assurance	that	the	lenders	will	consent	to	an	amendment	or	provide	a	waiver	or	that
they	will	do	so	on	terms	that	are	favorable	or	acceptable	to	us,	which	may	have	an
adverse	impact	on	our	financial	position	and	results	of	operations."

Based	on	the	cautious	tone	of	the	above	disclosure,	the	Company's	covenant	situation
does	not	appear	nearly	as	comfortable	as	Mr.	Miller	has	communicated.	Instead,	it	seems
that	the	Company's	ability	to	stay	in	compliance	with	its	covenants	is	questionable.	Also,
the	fact	that	this	disclosure	was	just	added	in	the	Q3	2016	10-Q	is	quite	alarming.	Prior	to
Q3	2016,	this	disclosure	regarding	BRS's	covenant	situation	was	not	included	in
their	quarterly	or	annual	filings.	This	differential	disclosure	is	a	strong	indication	that	the
Company	has	lost	a	great	deal	of	confidence	in	their	ability	to	remain	covenant	compliant.


Rather	than	focus	on	disclosures,	it	is	probably	more	helpful	to	look	at	the	actual	numbers.
Provided	below	is	a	detailed	calculation	of	BRS's	leverage	and	interest	charge	coverage
ratios	on	an	LTM	and	run-rate	basis:
7/18/2019 Bristow Group: Strong Sell Due To Misleading Behavior, Looming Covenant Violation, And Likely Bankruptcy - Bristow Group Inc. (NYSE:BRS) | Se…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 23/31


The	Company's	covenants	in	its	credit	agreement	are	calculated	on	an	LTM	basis.
However,	in	the	analysis	above,	I	have	also	provided	the	run-rate	figures.	I	believe	this
makes	sense	because	the	run-rate	figure,	in	my	opinion,	provides	a	more	accurate	view	of
the	Company's	current	financial	performance	relative	to	its	covenants.	As	shown	above,
BRS	does	not	have	much	cushion	remaining	under	its	renegotiated	leverage	ratio
and	interest	coverage	ratio	covenants.	Based	on	the	current	indebtedness	of	$1.9Bn,
EBITDAR	has	to	remain	above	$403.7mm	for	the	Company	to	remain	in	compliance	with
its	leverage	covenant.


As	of	Q3	2016,	LTM	EBITDAR	was	$460.9mm	and	run-rate	EBITDAR	was	$436.9mm.
Thus,	the	Company	will	be	in	violation	of	its	leverage	ratio	covenant	if	LTM	EBITDAR	and
run-rate	EBITDAR	decline	by	just	12.3%	and	7.6%,	respectively.	The	Company	has	even
less	cushion	under	its	interest	coverage	ratio	covenant.	As	shown	above,	on	an	LTM
basis,	the	Company	has	just	$22.6mm	or	4.9%	of	EBITDAR	cushion.	On	a	run-rate	basis,
BRS	is	already	in	violation	of	its	interest	coverage	ratio	covenant.


As	calculated	earlier,	I	project	EBITDAR	will	decline	in	FY	2017	to	$316.9mm.	This	large
projected	decline	in	EBITDAR,	combined	with	the	Company's	small	amount	of	covenant
cushion,	makes	it	likely	that	BRS	will	violate	its	covenants	within	the	next	year.	Thus,	I
expect	BRS	will	soon	find	itself	in	technical	default	of	its	credit	agreement.	Given	that	the
Company	already	renegotiated	covenants	in	September	2015,	it	is	questionable	whether
lenders	will	be	willing	to	renegotiate	once	again.	The	potential	curative	actions	required	to
fix	this	default	could	greatly	pressure	the	Company's	already	challenged	liquidity.


Bristow	Appears	To	Have	Little	Chance	Of	Overcoming	Its	Cash	Shortfall


As	calculated	previously,	I	estimate	that	BRS's	total	cash	shortfall	over	the	next	2	¼	years
amounts	to	$767.7mm.	A	key	question	for	investors	going	forward	is	whether	or	not	the
Company	can	somehow	make	up	this	shortfall	and	avoid	bankruptcy.	Many	BRS	bulls
believe	that	the	Company	will	be	able	to	meet	its	liquidity	needs	by	raising	cash	via	asset
sales,	sale	leasebacks	and	capex	cancellations/deferrals.	However,	according	to	my
diligence,	it	appears	more	likely	that	the	Company	will	only	be	able	to	raise	a	limited
amount	of	capital	via	these	methods.


In	regards	to	asset	sales,	the	downturn	in	the	offshore	industry	has	had	a	negative	impact
on	the	helicopter	resale	market.	The	large	drop	in	demand	for	helicopter	services	in	the
offshore	space	has	resulted	in	a	huge	surplus	of	excess	helicopter	capacity.	According	to
a	recent	Wall	Street	Journal	article,	around	20%	of	the	1,900	helicopters	serving	the	oil	&
gas	industry	are	either	idle	or	underemployed.	The	glut	of	excess	oil	&	gas	helicopter

capacity	has	significantly	impacted	the	resale	market	for	all	helicopter	types.	That	being
said,	the	resale	market	for	large	helicopters	has	been	affected	in	a	different	way	than	the
market	for	small	and	medium	helicopters.


For	large	helicopters,	the	main	issue	in	regards	to	the	resale	market	is	liquidity.	During	Era
Group's	(NYSE:ERA)	Q4	2015	earnings	call,	ERA	management	discussed	the	challenges
present	in	the	resale	market	for	large	helicopters:


"When	you	do	get	up	to	the	heavier	helicopters,	those	heavy	aircraft	have	a	more
finite	number	of	end	markets	that	they	can	serve.	For	those	particular	models,
the	end	markets	are	more	dominated	by	the	oil	and	gas	market.	They	can	also	serve
a	search	and	rescue	missions,	can	also	serve	high-end	VIP	clientele	like	heads	of
state	or	large	corporations.	But	that	market	is	more	dependent	upon	the	oil	and	gas
industry	and	that's	why	you've	more	difficult	to	do	more	those	aircraft	today."


As	stated	above,	the	problem	with	large	helicopters	is	that	these	helicopters	generally
have	a	very	limited	number	of	end	markets	where	they	can	be	resold.	The	primary	buyer
in	the	resale	market	for	large	helicopters	is	other	oil	&	gas	helicopter	operators.	However,
at	the	moment,	almost	all	of	the	major	oil	&	gas	helicopter	operators	are	sitting	on
significant	excess	capacity.	As	a	result,	there	are	simply	very	few	buyers	in	the	market	for
these	types	of	aircraft.	This,	in	turn,	has	created	an	extremely	illiquid	market	for	large
helicopters.


Compared	to	large	helicopters,	the	resale	market	for	small	and	medium	helicopters	is
much	more	liquid.	The	reason	is	because,	unlike	large	helicopters,	these	helicopters	can
be	repurposed	for	use	in	a	variety	of	different	sectors.	During	ERA's	Q4	2015	earnings
call,	management	discussed	some	of	the	different	end	markets	that	small	and	medium
helicopters	can	serve:


"So	starting	on	one	end	of	the	spectrum	with	light	aircraft,	these	helicopters	can
serve	a	number	of	different	end	missions.	It	could	be	oil	and	gas,	it	could	be	VIP,	it
could	be	firefighting,	it	could	be	flight-seeing	like	we	do	in	Alaska.	There	are	really	a
myriad	of	missions…When	you	step	into	the	medium	helicopters,	you	still	have	a
number	of	different	markets	that	those	helicopters	can	serve	outside	of	oil	and	gas."


That	being	said,	the	resale	market	for	small	and	medium	helicopters	has	its	own	issues.
More	specifically,	the	resale	values	for	small	and	medium	helicopters	have	declined
dramatically	over	the	past	year.	There	are	a	couple	of	primary	reasons	why	resale	values

have	plummeted.	To	begin	with	the	obvious,	the	glut	of	unutilized	small	and	medium
helicopter	capacity	has	significantly	pressured	resale	values.	In	addition	to	this,	perhaps
not	as	obviously,	repurposing	helicopters	costs	significant	money,	which	further	reduces
the	resale	value.


BRS's	recent	fleet	sales	illustrate	just	how	dramatically	resale	values	have	fallen	in	the
small	and	medium	space.	At	the	end	of	FY	2015,	the	Company	was	holding	a	total	of	12
helicopters	for	sale.	These	12	helicopters	were	classified	as	"assets	held	for	sale"	on
BRS's	balance	sheet.	Provided	below	are	the	Company's	current	assets	as	provided	in
their	FY	2015	10-K:


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	the	Company	estimated	that	its	12	helicopters	held
for	sale	were	worth	a	total	of	$57.8mm.	Thus,	at	the	end	of	FY	2015,	BRS	estimated	that
its	helicopters	held	for	sale	would	fetch	an	average	of	$4.8mm	per	helicopter	in	the	resale
market.	Unfortunately,	for	BRS,	through	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2016,	actual	per
helicopter	resale	values	have	been	much	less	than	expected.	The	following	figure	is	from
slide	30	of	the	Company's	Q3	2016	earnings	presentation:


As	shown	above,	since	the	end	of	FY	2015,	BRS	has	sold	14	helicopters	for	total
proceeds	of	$13.5mm.	10	of	the	12	aircrafts	held	for	sale	at	the	end	of	FY	2015	were
medium-sized	helicopters.	Based	on	this	fact,	it	is	likely	that	the	majority	of	the	14

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3973431-bristow-group-strong-sell-due-misleading-behavior-looming-covenant-violation-likely 26/31


helicopters	sold	from	Q1	2016	to	Q3	2016	were	of	medium	size.	Thus,	on	average,	it
appears	that	the	Company's	medium	helicopters	are	fetching	close	to	$1mm	in	the	resale
market.


Based	on	these	current	market	conditions,	it	is	unlikely	that	BRS	will	be	able	to	raise	a
significant	amount	of	cash	by	selling	its	used	helicopters.	Given	the	lack	of	liquidity,	it	will
be	very	difficult	for	BRS	to	sell	any	of	its	larger	aircrafts.	For	example,	BRS	currently	owns
15	model	H225	helicopters.	According	to	a	recent	FlyCorporate	article,	H225s	have	been
extremely	difficult	to	move	due	to	their	larger	size:


"Types	in	the	greatest	demand	are	the	Bell	429	and	H145,	which	are	generally
younger	and	better	equipped.	The	heavier	helicopters,	such	as	the	H225,	are
taking	a	long	time	to	find	new	owners."


Thus,	it	appears	that	BRS	will	have	to	rely	on	selling	small	and	medium	helicopters	to
raise	cash.	However,	as	I	just	discussed,	the	Company's	used	medium	helicopters	are
only	fetching	around	$1mm	in	the	resale	market.	If	used	medium	helicopters	are	fetching
around	$1mm,	then	BRS's	small	helicopters	are	likely	worth	considerably	less	than	$1mm.
Given	these	extremely	low	resale	values,	the	Company	will	be	hard	pressed	to	raise	even
$100mm	from	asset	sales.	It	is	also	worth	noting	that	resale	values	are	likely	to	come
under	further	pressure	as	the	decline	in	the	offshore	industry	accelerates	over	the	next
couple	of	ears.


In	addition	to	asset	sales,	BRS	management	has	mentioned	that	sale	leaseback
transactions	are	another	way	it	could	boost	its	liquidity.	However,	based	on	market
conditions	and	the	Company's	challenged	financial	situation,	BRS	will	likely	struggle	to
raise	cash	via	this	route.	To	begin	with,	helicopter	leasing	companies	are	also	feeling	the
effects	of	the	downturn	in	the	oil	&	gas	market.	Due	to	weakening	demand	from	helicopter
operators,	lessors	have	a	glut	of	unused	oil	&	gas	helicopters	on	their	books.	Due	to	this
glut	of	unused	capacity,	lessors	have	become	more	reluctant	to	purchase	oil	&	gas
helicopters	via	sale	leaseback	transactions.	As	a	result,	the	sale	leaseback	market	for	oil
&	gas	helicopters	has	softened	considerably.


Besides	softening	market	conditions,	the	Company's	deteriorating	financial	condition	will
also	make	it	very	difficult	for	them	to	engage	in	sale	leaseback	transactions.	As	discussed
earlier,	BRS	is	very	close	to	violating	its	interest	charge	coverage	ratio.	When	calculating
the	interest	charge	coverage	ratio	(EBITDAR/interest	charge),	aircraft	lease	payments	are
included	in	the	denominator	as	an	interest	charge.	Therefore,	BRS	is	limited	in	its	ability	to
do	sale	leaseback	transactions	given	that	the	incremental	aircraft	lease	payments	could

push	them	into	covenant	violation.	In	addition	to	this,	in	response	to	the	oil	&	gas
downturn,	leasing	companies	have	increased	the	rates	and	contract	lengths	of	their
leases.	In	a	recent	AINonline	article,	Ed	Washecka,	CEO	of	Waypoint	Leasing,	stated	the
following	regarding	changes	to	their	lease	terms:


"Rents	and	rates	are	also	going	up,	meaning	higher	lease	costs,	but	better	terms	are
still	available	for	the	best	customers…"


The	increasingly	onerous	terms	of	aircraft	leases	will	make	it	that	much	harder	for	BRS	to
stay	in	covenant	compliance	when	engaging	in	sale	leaseback	transactions.	Given	all	of
these	challenging	factors,	it	is	likely	that	the	Company's	ability	to	raise	cash	via	the	sale
leaseback	market	will	be	limited.


Another	route	that	BRS	could	explore	to	boost	its	liquidity	is	the	deferral	or	cancellation	of
some	of	its	aircraft	purchase	commitments.	In	Q1	and	Q2	FY	2016,	the	Company	was
able	to	defer	~$100mm	of	their	aircraft	capex	into	future	years.	Even	after	deferring	a
significant	amount	of	capex,	BRS	still	has	aircraft	capex	commitments	totaling	$256.9mm
over	the	next	2	¼	years.	Given	the	Company's	success	in	deferring	capex	earlier	this	year,
BRS	investors	are	hopeful	that	additional	commitments	can	be	deferred	or	even
cancelled.


Unfortunately,	for	BRS,	it	appears	that	only	a	limited	amount	of	the	remaining	aircraft
commitments	can	potentially	be	deferred	or	cancelled.	For	example,	on	pg.	30	of	BRS's
FY	2015	10-K,	the	Company	states	the	following:


"…we	have	substantial	non-cancelable	commitments	for	capital	expenditures,
including	the	acquisition	of	new	aircraft."


Based	on	the	above	quote,	it	appears	that	a	good	portion	of	BRS's	remaining	aircraft
commitments	are	fairly	ironclad.	In	addition	to	this,	$115.2mm	of	the	remaining	$256.9mm
in	aircraft	commitments	is	for	the	purchase	of	additional	U.K.	SAR	helicopters.	These
commitments	cannot	be	deferred	or	cancelled	because	the	U.K.	SAR	contract	requires
BRS	to	secure	a	set	number	of	new	SAR	helicopters.	Thus,	it	appears	that	the	maximum
amount	of	aircraft	capex	that	BRS	could	potentially	defer	or	cancel	is	$141.7mm
($256.9mm-$115.2mm).


In	summary,	the	key	point	that	investors	should	take	away	from	this	section	is	that	BRS's
liquidity	problems	will	be	very	difficult	to	overcome.	The	Company's	ability	to	boost	its
liquidity	via	asset	sales,	sale	leasebacks	and	capex	deferrals	appears	to	be	very

limited.	Thus,	it	appears	that	the	Company	has	dug	itself	a	financial	hole,	which	it	may	not
be	able	to	escape	from.


Management's	Questionable	Behavior	Inspires	Little	Confidence


In	my	opinion,	BRS	management	has	conducted	itself	in	a	highly	questionable	manner
during	this	recent	downturn.	Some	of	this	questionable	behavior	has	already	been
highlighted.	For	example,	towards	the	beginning	of	article,	I	expressed	concerns	over
management's	conduct	in	relation	to	the	UK	SAR	business.	Based	on	a	good	deal	of
evidence,	it	appears	that	management	may	be	misrepresenting	BRS's	remaining	UK	SAR
commitments,	as	well	as	aggressively	deferring	costs	to	boost	their	UK	SAR	margins.	As
another	example,	later	in	the	article,	I	discussed	how	management	did	not	appear	to	be
accurately	representing	its	covenant	situation	to	analysts	and	investors.


Unfortunately,	my	concerns	over	management's	conduct	does	not	end	there.	During	my
diligence	of	the	Company,	I	found	numerous	other	examples	of	management	making
highly	questionable	statements	about	their	business.	For	example,	in	an	April	2015
interview	with	Bloomberg,	Mr.	Baliff	discussed	his	outlook	for	BRS	over	the	next	couple	of
years.	Bloomberg	noted	the	following	key	takeaways	from	its	discussion	with	Mr.	Baliff:


"The	largest	helicopter	company	that	transports	oil	workers	to	offshore	sites	says	it
is	willing	to	spend	as	much	as	$1	billion	to	acquire	smaller	rivals	or	other
aircraft	in	2015,	hence	taking	advantage	of	the	low	oil	price	environment	to	expand
its	fleet."


"Bristow	Group's	CEO	Jonathan	Baliff	said	the	next	year	will	be	"very	good"	for
the	company,	due	in	part	to	the	opportunity	to	pursue	more	mergers	and
acquisitions	amid	the	current	commodity	environment."


As	shown	in	the	quotes	above,	Mr.	Baliff	predicted	that	calendar	year	2015	would	be	a
very	prosperous	year	for	BRS	and	predicted	that	the	Company	could	spend	up	to	$1Bn	on
acquisitions.	In	early	2015,	BRS	was	already	facing	significant	industry	headwinds	and
emerging	liquidity	issues.	Thus,	Mr.	Baliff's	bullish	comments	at	the	time	simply	did	not
make	any	sense.


As	another	example,	during	BRS's	Q2	2016	earnings	call,	Don	Miller	stated	the	following
regarding	the	Company's	liquidity	situation:

"One	of	the	things	that's	important	to	us	is	we	have	this	excess	liquidity	facility
that	covers	all	of	our	commitments,	whether	it	be	the	dividend	or	other	things,
in	case	this	downturn	gets	worse.	We	have	a	level	of	resilience	in	the	company	but
now	we've	reinforced	that	resilience	with	this	facility."


As	highlighted	above,	during	the	Q2	2016	earnings	call,	Mr.	Miller	emphasized	that	the
Company's	current	liquidity	would	be	more	than	enough	to	cover	their	dividend.	However,
just	one	quarter	later,	BRS	reduced	its	dividend	by	almost	80%	from	$0.34	per	share	to
$0.07	per	share.	These	misguided	statements	by	both	Mr.	Miller	and	Mr.	Baliff	regarding
the	state	of	BRS's	business	further	call	into	question	the	credibility	of	management.	It
appears	that	BRS	management	is	either	(1)	extremely	poor	at	assessing	the	state	of	their
own	business	or	(2)	intentionally	misleading	investors.	I	believe	the	latter	is	the	correct
answer,	but	either	scenario	is	not	very	appealing	for	shareholders.


Another	point	of	concern	regarding	BRS's	management	team	is	the	background	of	Mr.
Miller,	the	Company's	CFO.	The	following	is	an	excerpt	from	Mr.	Miller's	bio	posted	on
BRS's	website:


"He	was	previously	the	post-petition	president	and	chief	executive	officer	for	Enron
North	America	Corp.	and	Enron	Power	Marketing,	Inc.	from	2001	to	2007	and	also
served	in	senior	financial	positions	with	Enron,	including	director	-	finance	and	vice
president,	asset	marketing	group	from	1998	to	2001."


From	1998	to	2001,	Mr.	Miller	worked	at	Enron	in	various	senior	financial	positions.	As	is
well-known,	Enron	went	bankrupt	in	2001	after	its	fraudulent	accounting	and	business
practices	were	revealed.	The	fact	that	Mr.	Miller	was	a	senior	member	of	Enron's	finance
department	at	that	time	should	give	investors	some	apprehension.	In	isolation,	his
association	with	Enron	may	not	be	a	huge	issue.	However,	given	the	issues,	which	I	have
highlighted	regarding	the	conduct	of	management,	Mr.	Miller's	association	with	Enron
becomes	more	concerning.


Valuation


I	believe	that	BRS	is	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	of	$17.96.	Over	the
next	couple	of	years,	the	Company	will	somehow	need	to	find	a	way	to	make-up	for	its
large	cash	shortfall.	This	will	be	very	challenging	for	them	for	a	few	reasons.	First,	it
appears	that	the	Company's	ability	to	enhance	its	liquidity	via	asset	sales,	sale	leasebacks
and	capex	deferrals	is	very	limited.	Also,	given	the	rapidly	deteriorating	industry
environment	and	BRS's	distressed	financial	situation,	securing	additional	debt	funding

does	not	appear	to	be	a	viable	option.	Finally,	it	is	likely	that	BRS	will	soon	violate	both	its
leverage	ratio	and	interest	charge	coverage	ratio	covenants,	which	will	place	the
Company	in	technical	default.	The	curative	actions	required	to	fix	a	technical	default,	such
as	accelerated	principal	payments,	could	further	pressure	BRS's	liquidity.


At	this	point,	it	appears	that	BRS's	overleveraged	balance	sheet	has	become
unmanageable	for	the	Company.	A	cash	shortfall	of	over	$750mm	is	simply	far	too	great
for	the	Company	to	makeup	in	a	deteriorating	industry	environment.	Even	if	BRS	was	able
to	somehow	make	it	through	the	next	couple	of	years	(FY	2017-FY	2018),	the	Company
has	another	$516mm	of	debt	coming	due	in	the	FY	2019-FY	2020	time	frame.	Thus,	I
believe	it	is	highly	likely	that	BRS	will	eventually	file	for	bankruptcy	over	the	next	year	or
so.


Due	to	my	belief	that	BRS	is	likely	to	go	bankrupt,	it	does	not	make	sense	to	value	the
Company	on	traditional	metrics.	Typically	distressed	companies	with	a	high	chance	of
bankruptcy	trade	in	the	low-to-mid	single	digits.	Eventually,	as	a	bankruptcy	filings	looms,
their	stock	will	trade	below	$1	per	share.	Thus,	my	short	term	six-month	price	target	for
BRS	is	$5	per	share.	This	is	72%	below	the	current	share	price.	Eventually,	I	expect	that
BRS	will	file	for	bankruptcy.	Therefore,	my	long-term	price	target	for	BRS	is	below	$1	per
share.


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	quickly	note	that	a	member	of	my	team	sent	an	email	to	BRS's	investor
relations	team.	We	asked	them	to	address	the	key	issues	brought	up	in	this	article.	I	will
provide	an	update	in	the	comments	section	if	we	receive	any	relevant	new	information
from	the	Company.


Conclusion


Given	BRS's	severe	near-term	liquidity	shortfall	and	looming	covenant	violations,	I	believe
that	the	Company	is	unlikely	to	remain	solvent	through	this	extended	downturn	in	the
offshore	oil	industry.	Also,	management's	highly	questionable	behavior	over	the	past	year
inspires	little	confidence	that	they	will	be	able	to	successfully	navigate	BRS	through	this
difficult	time	period.	Finally,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	seemingly	misleading	UK	SAR
disclosures	may	place	them	in	violation	of	securities	laws.	Given	all	of	these	concerns,	I
believe	that	BRS	is	highly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	level.	Thus,	I	recommend
shorting	BRS	or	selling	BRS	shares	if	you	are	an	existing	shareholder.
