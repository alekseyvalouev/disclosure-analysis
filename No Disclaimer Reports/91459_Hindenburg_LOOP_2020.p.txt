(NASDAQ:LOOP)


Loop Industries has never generated revenue, yet calls itself a technology innovator with a “proven” solution that is “leading the sustainable
plastic revolution”. Our research indicates that Loop is smoke and mirrors with no viable technology.
As part of our investigation, we interviewed former employees, competitors, industry experts, and company partners. We also reviewed
extensive company documentation and litigation records.
Former employees revealed that Loop operated two labs: one reserved for the company’s two twenty-something lead scientist brothers
and their father, where incredible results were achieved, and a separate lab where rank-and-�le employees were unable to replicate the
supposedly breakthrough results.
The two brothers who act as lead scientists for Loop and who co-invented Loop’s recycling process appear to have no post-graduate
education in chemistry and list no work experience other than Loop.
A former Loop employee told us that Loop’s scientists, under pressure from CEO Daniel Solomita, were tacitly encouraged to lie about the
results of the company’s process internally. We have obtained internal documents and photographs to support their claims.
Loop focuses on recycling a common form of plastic called “PET”. According to a former employee, Loop’s previous claims of breaking PET
down to its base chemicals at a recovery rate of 100% were “technically and industrially impossible”. The same employee told us the
company’s claims of producing “industrial grade purity” base chemicals from PET were false.
According to litigation records, Loop’s CEO, Daniel Solomita hired a convict, who had previously pled guilty to stock manipulation, to help
raise Loop’s startup capital. That convict introduced Solomita to another convict who facilitated Loop’s �rst investment.
Solomita has no apparent formal science education but has a history of stock promotion at another publicly traded company that
subsequently imploded.
Executives from a division of key partner Thyssenkrupp, who Loop entered into a “global alliance agreement” with in December 2018, told
us their partnership is on “inde�nite” hold and that Loop “underestimated” both costs and complexities of its process.
We contacted Loop’s other partners, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, most of whom refused to divulge whether any plastic had been
recycled as part of their partnerships with Loop. Comments from Danone, owner of the Evian brand, suggested it had not bought any PET
from Loop thus far. We suspect these partnerships have gone nowhere.
Loop’s JV with PET and chemical company Indorama, promoted frequently over the last two years as an imminent revenue stream, is “still
being �nalized”, according to an employee, despite being announced in 2018. An Indorama employee told us no production has taken place
thus far.
We expect Loop will never generate any meaningful revenue. With a market cap of ~$515 million, we see 100% downside to Loop once it
burns through its ~$48 million in balance sheet cash.
We have submitted our �ndings to regulators.

Loop Industries: Former Employees and Plastics Experts Blow The
Whistle On This “Recycled” Smoke And Mirrors Show


Published on October 13, 2020

Low-cost recycling is the answer to these problems and the biggest challenge in the recycling industry has been PET plastic – the cheap, clear,


lightweight plastic often used in drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging.

Traditional PET recycling methods require heat and pressure to break down and re-shape plastic, which is costly. New “advanced recycling”


techniques aim to minimize the use of heat and pressure by breaking down plastic with chemicals, but thus far these methods have proven


expensive and ine�cient.


There are an estimated 70 million metric tons of PET plastic generated annually, representing a massive global problem and, conversely, a major


opportunity for whoever can solve the problem. [Pg. 8

Enter Loop Industries, Which Has Essentially Claimed to Have Found the Holy Grail of
Plastics Recycling—An Inexpensive, E�cient, Pro�table Process For Recycling The
World’s Most Ubiquitous Plastic


Loop Industries (NASDAQ:LOOP), headquartered in Quebec, claims to have found the answer.


Loop refers to itself as a technology company whose “mission is to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable PET plastic and polyester �ber


and away from our dependence on fossil fuels.”


The company was incorporated in Nevada on October 23, 2014 and went public through a reverse merger in June 2015. [Pg. 8


(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/165495420004887?cik=1504678)]


Loop has claimed to have developed a patented and proprietary technology that breaks down PET plastic:            


“of any color, transparency or condition, including waste PET plastic recovered from the ocean that has been degraded by the sun and


salt, to its base building blocks (monomers)” [Pg. 6


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420010918/lp_10q.htm)]


Even more incredibly, the company claims (https://www.lesa�aires.com/bourse/nouvelles-economiques/la-quebecoise-loop-industries-veut-


aider-pepsi-et-coke-a-prendre-le-virage-vert/609536) to have achieved these breakthroughs after setting up a laboratory using “products


purchased from the local hardware store” [translated from French][1].


In its most recent October 2020 investor presentation


(https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-%20Q2%202021.pdf?1072414598), Loop calls


its process “proven” and says that its facilities are expected to have a “margin pro�le which notably exceeds competing recycling technologies,


with EBITDA margins >40%.” [Pg. 3 (https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-


%20Q2%202021.pdf?1072414598)] Its website, as of October 11, 2020, says that Loop is “radically transforming how plastic is produced”.


In other words, the company claims to have discovered how to turn worthless trash into pure gold, a feat that multi-billion chemical companies


such as DuPont, Dow Chemical, and 3M have been unable to achieve on a large scale despite years of e�orts.

Loop’s investor base has been encouraged by both its breakthrough claims and a slew of partnerships that have lent credence to its technology.


These partnerships include some of the biggest �rms that generate plastic waste worldwide: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Danone to name a few.


Reality Check: Former Employees, Plastics Experts and Competitors Blow The Whistle On
“Liar” Scientists, Faked Results, �udimentary Technology And Hollow Partnerships


As we will show, Loop’s claimed breakthroughs in PET plastic recycling are �ction. Our investigation into Loop, spanning 6 months, has included


speaking with multiple former employees, company partners, polymer/plastic experts, and competitors.


Our investigation points to one conclusion: in the words of a former Loop employee, we simply “don’t really think they have the


technology”.


Former employees painted a picture of a chaotic company, whose lead scientists are twenty-something “liars”, with no relevant work experience


other than Loop, that were able to achieve “impossible” results in a secret second lab that rank-and-�le employees weren’t allowed to access.


Loop’s supposed proprietary process is a black box that has not shown itself to be more e�cient or cost e�ective than comparable solutions,


contrary to the company’s claims, according to former employees and outside experts.


Loop’s CEO, who has no speci�c educational background in chemistry, sought out the help of several convicts to put together Loop’s startup


capital, according to litigation records. Loop’s management has a track record of taking investors on a ride with sweet sounding public company


stories that have ended in catastrophic losses.


Loop’s partnerships have gone almost nowhere. The company announced a key joint venture in 2018 to build a facility with well-respected PET


and chemical company Indorama, but two years later the terms of the deal have yet to even be �nalized. Other major consumer plastic brands


were unable to con�rm to us that their partnerships with Loop had progressed.


Experts we spoke with raised serious questions about the company’s ability to make its “unparalleled purity” end product, as claimed, at large


scales with any cost e�ciency. They said Loop is focused on a decades-old problem and there is nothing new or revolutionary about the idea of


breaking down PET in the fashion Loop is claiming.


All told, we think Loop is just a smoke-and-mirror show masquerading as a technological leader.


Part I: Background on Loop’s Key People


Loop’s CEO Daniel Solomita: No Educational Background In Chemistry and A History of
Stock Promotion


Some of the largest chemical companies in the world are working with their teams of top scientists to solve the plastic sustainability problem.


Major multi-billion dollar corporations like Dow, DuPont and Eastman Chemical have committed to deploying their combined teams of tens of


thousands of employees to help create a circular economy for plastic and waste. [1 (https://resource-

(https://www.eastman.com/Company/Circular-Economy/Pages/Overview.aspx)]


Given Loop’s claimed breakthroughs, one might similarly expect top scientists at the helm. Instead, we found that Daniel Solomita, Loop’s CEO,


has no apparent formal education in chemistry or polymers.


Solomita’s education, according to his LinkedIn (https://ca.linkedin.com/in/daniel-solomita-35773543) and SEC biography


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420004881/lp_def14a.htm) includes 2 years studying Finance at Dawson College


and 1 year studying computer science at Concordia University. He also cites attendance at an MIT management program during his tenure at


Loop.

In Solomita’s o�cial SEC biography (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420004881/lp_def14a.htm) he lists being a

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793216010876/llpp_10k.htm)].


The former stock of Dragon is now listed (https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/LEIC/disclosure) as a “shell” on OTC Markets and trades 99.9% o�

According to Dragon Polymers’ 2014 annual report [Pg. 12 (http://www.otcmarkets.com/ajax/showFinancialReportById.pdf?id=145837)], the


company changed its name on October 12, 2014 and impaired its recycling assets because it had “no hopes of future revenue from the recycling


operations.” [2]


Two weeks later, on October 23, 2014, Solomita incorporated Loop Holdings. [Pg. 13


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793216010876/llpp_10k.htm)]


It seems Loop was born out of the business concept that Solomita’s former company impaired to $0.


Considering this, it doesn’t come as a surprise to us that Loop has never turned a pro�t, never generated a single dollar in revenue, and


has never generated any cash from operations.


Loop’s Origins: CEO Solomita Engaged a Convict Who Pled Guilty to Securities Fraud to
Help Raise Loop’s Early Capital


That Convict Introduced Solomita to Another Convict (Who Had Pled Guilty to Wire Fraud
and Securities Fraud) Who Helped Facilitate the Company’s First �80,000 Investment


One might think that a company with breakthrough technology in plastic recycling would have attracted major chemical companies or well-


known VC �rms as early investors. Firms like Eastman Chemical, Kleiner Perkins, and Blackrock are all actively involved


(https://www.registercitizen.com/business/article/These-companies-are-trying-to-reinvent-recycling-13753361.php) in plastics recycling.


Instead, according to a lawsuit �led in 2017 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/q1NGLoVpGPCG) in the Superior Court of California (Case No.


BC648640), Loop turned to an individual previously convicted of securities fraud, Henry Lorin, to help raise its early outside capital.


(Source: Lorin v. Loop exhibits page 50
(https://hindenburgresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/2018.05.30-Donald-Danks-evidence.pdf))


The lawsuit against Loop and Solomita was �led by Lorin, who had “initiated several business relationships” for Solomita, according to the


exhibits. Lorin previously (https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/731/1166/1877866/) “pled guilty in the Southern District of


New York to conspiring to manipulate the prices” of certain securities and was found to have given false testimony to the Securities and


Exchange Commission.

Loop Co-Founder Donald Danks Has A History Of Allegations Of “Misleading Statements”,
“Unlawful Business Practices”, and Leaking Material Non-Public Information


Loop’s co-founder (https://relationshipscience.com/person/donald-danks-160950856) Donald Danks, who reportedly (https://resource-


recycling.com/plastics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/03/Second-amended-complaint.pdf) helped Solomita start Loop in 2014, has a


checkered past of his own.


Danks previously served as Chairman and CEO (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070830005946/en/iMergent-Discloses-Results-


Internal-Investigation-Chairman-CEO) of iMergent.


According to a 2007 article in the Brisbane Times (https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/imergents-history-of-legal-woes-


20070313-ge8g6j.html), iMergent was subject to a slew of allegations of misleading statements, unlawful business practices, violations of the


Business Opportunity Fraud act and wrongfully enticing customers.


On top of those allegations, Danks was accused by Barron’s (https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB117832619251592966) of leaking material non-


public information about his company’s revenue numbers.

Danks served as a Director of Loop from (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793216010876/0001477932-16-010876-


index.htm) June 29, 2015, until (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793219003221/loop_424b5.htm) June 28, 2018. He


continues to actively promote Loop on social media, re-tweeting Loop tweets (https://twitter.com/ddanks) as recently as September 2020 and a


reposting a LinkedIn post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6696104723503820800/) in August 2020.


Loop’s Current Process Was Invented By Two Brothers in Their Twenties With No Work
Experience Other Than Loop And No Post-Graduate Education In Chemistry or Polymers


One might consider a CEO with a history of stock promotion and an early association with multiple individuals convicted of securities-related


fraud to be a red �ag.


But putting that aside for the moment, it isn’t completely impossible for an unlikely/unsavory cast of characters to somehow attract a scientist


that manages to identify new breakthroughs.


So, who is the talent behind the process that Loop claims could help reshape the multi-billion dollar plastics industry?


The company’s current (Generation II) process was invented


(https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-%20Q2%202021.pdf?1421422648) and


patented by two brothers in their 20s, Adel and Fares Essaddam, who have no apparent post-graduate studies in chemistry or polymers or any


work experience other than Loop. Adel started at Loop just months after completing his diploma and Fares started working for Loop while still


attending university.

Adel is Loop’s “Lead Scientist”, according to the company’s October 2020 investor presentation


(https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-%20Q2%202021.pdf?1421422648). According


to Adel’s LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/adel-essaddam-24375184/?originalSubdomain=ca), he has a technical diploma in composite


materials transformation from CEGEP de Saint Jérôme and has no other work experience aside from Loop. He �nished his education in 2015 and


started at Loop in January 2016, according to his LinkedIn.


Adel’s brother Fares is the company’s “Technology Lead”. Fares also lists no other work experience on his LinkedIn page


(https://www.linkedin.com/in/fares-essaddam-5aa17a101/) other than Loop. His education at Universite d’Ottawa took place between 2014 and


2018 and he started as an analyst at Loop in May 2015, working at the company for 3 years while in school, according to the LinkedIn bio.


Their dad’s patent formed the basis of the company’s GEN I process, which has now become defunct in favor of the company’s new GEN II


process.[3] [Pg. 8 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/165495420004887?cik=1504678)]

When we asked a former employee about the Essaddam brothers and how their process was perceived by others at Loop, we were told:


“They learned most of the stu� from the dad and they were lying the same way as the dad. They wanted to make sure to get


results.”


Part II: Former Employees Speak Out


Former Loop Employee: “The Chemists Behind the Technology Are Liars”


Former Loop Employee: “I’ve Seen False Numbers. I’ve Seen ‘I Want This Sample, Give Me
This Result. I Don’t Want To See Anything Else. I Want To See This Result’.”


After speaking to former Loop employees, we believe we understand the dysfunctional dynamics at play within the company.


When asked how it was possible that the chemists and experts we interviewed (whose opinions are detailed later in this report) didn’t see a way


for Loop’s process to be cost e�cient, but that Loop did, they told us:


“The main problem was that the chemists behind [Solomita’s] technology are liars. They made him hear what he wanted to


hear…I was working on the puri�cation of the MEG and I was not successful at all. I worked on that for [redacted] and it was a painful


recovery because some of the dyes were staying in the MEG (PET base chemical monoethylene glycol) and there was no way to remove


them. I tried many, many things and I was not successful at all.” Privacy  - Terms

A former employee provided us with these photographs of the dirty MEG:


When we asked how Loop dealt with the di�culties of proving their process internally, they told us they had seen false numbers being used


internally:


“I’ve seen false numbers… I’ve seen ‘I want this sample… Give me this result. I don’t want to see anything else; I want to see this result.’”


The employee described an intimidating tone at the top, referring to CEO Daniel Solomita:


“If you don’t do what he expects you to do, not fast enough, or if the results are not good enough, he gets angry and he can yell at you


for hours and hours and hours. Yeah. I’ve seen one of his worst frustrations, he yelled at two people for three hours, non-stop.”


When asked about Solomita and whether he would demand certain results, a second employee told us:


“There’s just facts and there’s chemistry and there’s certain things you can’t like – even if you want something to happen, you’re not


going to get a resolution. It has to come from a scienti�c point of view in order to �nd resolution. You can’t just throw money at it,


or just have a �t or something. You can’t direct the molecules to behave the way you want them to like you would, for an


example, an employee showing bad behavior.”


Two Former Loop Employees: The Company Has Two Labs. One For The Essaddam Family
And One For “All The Other People”.


Former Employee: “When It Was Time to Talk About Results, They Were Hiding Things
And Bypassing Us To Go Present Results To The Boss”


Based on what we were told by former employees, it seems like the ‘miracle’ results and successes that were being produced at Loop came out


of a separate lab for the Essaddam family that had been sequestered from other Loop employees.


Two former employees con�rmed the existence of separate labs to us. The �rst said:


“When I was there, there was two labs. One of them was for the Essaddam family. And one of them other was for all the


other people. We would not see what they were doing. It was in the same building; it was one on the second �oor and one on the


�rst �oor. We could go into the lab but at some point, it was dangerous because they had an explosion in their lab from toxic fumes


since they were doing so many crazy things in there. We would never go in there. I was trying to avoid it as much as possible.”


The �rst also told us about suspicious results that were coming out of the Essaddams’ lab and how the family separated themselves from the


rest of the company’s scientists:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
“They were friendly but at some point, when it was time to talk about results, they were hiding things and bypassing us to go


present results to the boss. So, they would present their results and not ours. They had two faces. They had their father in the


background for everything so they would discuss everything as a family. I’m sure like every day they would probably discuss that at the


family dinner. I have a couple of other friends that left because they couldn’t stand it anymore.”


“There was always a group saying ‘they did this again…’ ‘They brought samples and wouldn’t tell them what it was’ and ‘when we gave


results, they weren’t happy about it…’”


Solomita Claimed the Process Needed to Remain Secret—Even Within the Company—to
Avoid Leaking it to Competitors


The second former employee con�rmed that the father and two sons worked in an R&D lab while the other employees worked in a second lab,


which analyzed samples received from the R&D lab.


“One of them was more like the analytical lab, which then needed to test the results. And then the actual R&D and process was


more from the other lab. The one with the gentleman and the two boys [Essaddam and his sons].”


The analytical group would receive samples from the R&D lab, then work on the puri�cation process and analyze the results. We received


pictures and details of this analysis. For example, these photographs show tests to remove metals in the solution prior to a process called PTA


precipitation:


(Pictured: photos from internal Loop
testing to remove impurities)


We were also told that the problem was that the process being used in the R&D lab was not shared with the other lab – it was kept secret even


within the company – supposedly because Solomita was worried that it would be leaked to competitors.


The second employee explained that processes in the R&D lab weren’t documented well enough for the analytical lab to know how the results


were being achieved:


“In chemistry you get taught you have to follow a protocol. You have to write everything. You write what you do and you do what you


write. You make a clear and explicit action plan beforehand. That’s something that you learn formally. That’s something you need to


implement in your mentality.”

“Ultimately if you have your QC (quality control) that comes and tells you ‘Hey this is a really good batch, keep tweaking on these


parameters’, you need to be able to know ‘OK what did I do exactly to get this particular sample. And I feel like there’s where there


was a little bit of gap. If it wasn’t perfectly documented, then you don’t know how you got this really good sample…”


Former Employee: The Results Coming Out of the Secret Lab Were, At Times, Blatantly
Impossible


The �rst former employee recounted to us how results coming out of the Essaddam lab were sometimes simply “impossible”. For example, in


one case they claimed the process produced more solution than was initially put in. (Analogous to somehow turning 1 gallon of input into 2


gallons of output.) The employee concluded:


“I was not getting along with the Essaddam family. I am a very honest person, a chemist who respects the code of ethics. In my


point of view, a lie and falsifying results is not acceptable. I was not shy to say it.


When a chem came from the lab into a meeting and said ‘I got it! I was successful’ I would say it’s impossible, you got more


than what you sampled in the initial solution that you treated. They would say ‘no that’s not true.’”


Loop Claimed That the Base Chemicals It Created Were Of “Industrial Grade Purity”


A Former Employee Refuted This, Saying One Of The Base Chemicals Was “Not Even
Isolated At The Time” And Was “Still Mixed With Dyes, Water and Solid Wastes”


Over three years ago, Loop was already claiming to have been able to create PET plastic building blocks that were of speci�cations needed for


industrial use. This conveyed to investors that the process was consistently creating a viable end product.


In the company’s May 30, 2017, annual report, it describes its PET base chemicals (PTA and MEG monomers) as of “industrial grade purity”:


“Our depolymerized PET has been tested in third-party laboratory settings…and we have concluded that the PTA and MEG are of


industrial grade purity, meaning they are suitable for use in commercial beverage bottles.” [Pg. 5


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793217002605/llpp_10k.htm)]


But when we asked a former employee about these claims, they told us that not only wasn’t the output of industrial grade purity but the process


was failing.


The MEG “was not even isolated at that time,” the former employee told us. It was “still mixed with dyes, water and solid wastes.”


The former employee also told us they “never saw any test report from an outside lab or manufacturer”. They believed Loop’s partner, Indorama,


had used some base chemicals produced at a lab to create some bottles and that they may have been the “third party source” relating to these


claims.


Loop Claimed It Was Able to Break PET Into Base Chemicals At A Recovery Rate “Of 100%”


Former Loop Employee: This Is Technically and Industrially “Impossible”


In the company’s June 15, 2016, annual report (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793216010876/llpp_10k.htm), it


claimed to be breaking PET down into base chemicals at a recovery rate of “100%”. [Pg. 8


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793216010876/llpp_10k.htm)]


“Our proprietary technology breaks down polyethylene yerephthalate (“PET”) into its base chemicals, puri�ed terephthalic


acid (“PTA”) and ethylene glycol (“EG”), at a recovery rate of 100%.”

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We spoke to a former employee that worked at Loop around the time of this claim, who told us the claim of a 100% recovery was “technically


impossible” and “industrially impossible”.


They also told us that “yields were not even repeatably over 90% at the lab scale” in October 2016, nearly 4 months after the company had


already claimed a 100% recovery rate in public �lings.


A polymer expert we interviewed, who has had no contact with the former employee, told us that a reclaim of 100% of PTA (puri�ed terephthalic


acid) and EG (ethylene glycol) base chemicals from PET is “impossible”. The expert also said that even “over 90%” would be “a stretch.”


Former Loop Employee: “I Don’t Think That [Loop’s Gen II] Process Will Be Successful.
Actually, I Don’t Really Think They Have the Technology.”


Speaking about Loop’s new Generation II process we were told that it “wasn’t easier” than the earlier problem-ridden Generation I process:


“When I was there, they were producing PET and the contaminants had to be very low. We were successful every ten batches maybe,


because there was always a contaminant that was way too high. We were trying to purify and repurify. Sometimes we’d purify a batch


4, 5, 6 times. On a material level it’s impossible to be successful and make money o� of that. You’d have to send a batch back to


reprocess because it’s full of contaminants—you can’t make money o� of that.”


Despite Loop’s claims of a “revolutionary” process and “disrupting” the plastics industry, [4] the former employee told us they didn’t think the Gen


II process would be successful, nor did they think that the company even has the technology it claims:


“There were so many issues with the process that we left it alone and we started a new process, but it wasn’t easier…I don’t


think that it will be successful. Actually, I don’t really think they have the technology. That would be my conclusion”


Loop’s Own Patents Seem To Contradict The Company’s Claims About Yields, Purity and
Lack Of Heat and Pressure In Its Process


In Loop’s October 2020 investor presentation (https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop Industries Investor Presentation - Q2 2021.pdf?


1514447650), it emphasizes its “patent protected” technology. Instead of proving the value of the company’s intellectual property, the company’s


patents and related applications instead seem to stand at odds with company disclosures and, in some cases, appear to disprove some of the


company’s own statements.


The company has two patent families; one relating to its now defunct GEN I process and another related to its GEN II process. [Pg.5


(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/165495420004887?cik=1504678)] The patents relating to the GEN II process [1


(https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/86/45/55/1b14586fcf5d24/US20190256450A1.pdf), 2


(https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020002999A3/en?inventor=fares+essaddam&oq=fares+essaddam), 3


(https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020002999A2/en?inventor=fares+essaddam&oq=fares+essaddam)] look to be Adel and Fares Essaddam


brothers’ only patents. The main di�erences between the GEN II patents relate to the catalysts that the company is using to break down PET.


An expert chemist we consulted for this report called the GEN II patents “very similar” to the GEN I patent


(https://patents.justia.com/patent/10087130), which Loop CEO Daniel Solomita purchased in 2014 for $445,050 and has since written o� Loop’s


balance sheet. [Pg. F-15 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495419005416/loop_10k.htm), F-16


(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/165495420004887?cik=1504678)]


The company’s GEN II patents are replete with examples of adding both heat and pressure to Loop’s process. [5]


These revelations appear at odds with the company’s previous claims


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793218000206/llpp_10qa.htm) of breaking down PET “under normal atmospheric


pressure and at room temperature” (likely referring to GEN I, from Q2 2017 10-Q) and claims made as recently as May 2019 (while describing the


GEN II process), where on Loop’s website, in which the company says its process uses “zero energy input” and that this is “why the technology is


revolutionary”.

Heat and pressure both require energy input, and thereby can substantially increase costs.


The GEN II patents also o�er a glance into the company’s cherry-picked base chemical yields after breaking down PET. The results that the


company admits to in its patents appear to be far worse than the “unparalleled” and “100% recovery” claims Loop has made in the past.


The data is cherrypicked for each base chemical, as well. For example, in this GEN II patent application [Pg. 22


(https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/30/3d/18/b9c8501aeec621/WO2020002999A2.pdf)], data is presented in two di�erent ways for


each of the two base chemicals produced from the process, DMT and MEG.


The company chooses to show MEG yield after distillation, but not DMT yield after distillation. For MEG, it shows yield after only one distillation.


Ergo, this makes it impossible to determine the purity of the �nal product based on the data provided; and certainly di�cult to prove


“unparalleled purity” after the multiple distillations that are likely necessary, our expert con�rmed to us.


Additionally, a former employee informed us that the company’s MEG yield was being reported in the


(https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/30/3d/18/b9c8501aeec621/WO2020002999A2.pdf) GEN II patent in a way that exaggerated the


e�ectiveness of Loop’s process.[7] Even the in�ated numbers do not qualify the process as high yielding, giving a false impression of the


importance of the patent, the former employee said.


Part III: Loop’s Hollow Partnerships


Key to the investment thesis in Loop is its lineup of partnerships with major plastics-related corporations around the globe.


We connected with Loop’s partners and found the deals showed few signs of progress and mostly amounted to hollow press releases.  Such


empty partnerships are common in Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) companies, providing major corporations an opportunity to


“greenwash” or give the appearance that they are taking steps to help the environment, while doing very little to actually engage.


Loop’s Former Chief Growth O�cer Used His Rolodex to Secure Partnerships With L’Oreal,
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo And Other Major Corporations.


But These Partnerships Appear to Have Stalled. Loop’s Partners Would Not Disclose If
They Had Recycled Any Plastic with Loop – Except One That Indicated It Had Received
Nothing.


Just like other questionable companies of days past that have used various partnerships to project legitimacy, we think Loop is running a similar


playbook.


In an October 2020 investor presentation (https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-


%20Q2%202021.pdf?1421422648), Loop touts its partnerships with companies like L’Oreal, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We inquired with the above partners on the amount of plastic they processed in conjunction with Loop and were given vague answers,


boilerplate responses or directed back to Loop.


For example, after emailing Coca-Cola European Partners for comment, we were diverted to an outside PR �rm, Blurred London. After 13 days


and several follow up emails, we received the following non-committal response:


“Loop is one of many technology providers working on developing e�cient processes and alongside our bottling partners across


the globe, the Company continues to evaluate several solutions to accelerate commercialization, in support of a circular


economy for our packaging and our World Without Waste goals.”


Danone, owner of the world-famous Evian water brand, unveiled its recycled PET bottle (https://www.danone.com/content/dam/danone-


corp/danone-com/medias/medias-en/2020/brandnews/evian-launches-its-�rst-Label-Free-Bottle-global-PR.pdf) in July 2020, saying it had been


two years “in the making”.  But none of the plastic or recycled resin came from Loop, even though the companies have a partnership agreement.


Responding via an outside PR company, Freuds, Evian said: “When Loop’s production site is operational, Evian will be one of the �rst brands


purchasing LOOP PET to be produced.”


Loop currently has no operational production site in Europe or elsewhere – hence we view the statement as a roundabout admission that no


Loop plastic has been used in the Evian bottle.


Loop’s Former Chief Growth O�cer Told Us Multinational Partners Make Bets “On All
Kinds Of Things” And Take “One or Two Years” To Do Rigorous Process Due Diligence A�er
A Partnership Is Announced


We spoke with Loop’s former Chief Growth O�cer, Nelson Switzer, (who has since resigned). Switzer indicated to us he had used his contacts


from his former job as Chief Sustainability O�cer of Nestle Waters to help entice some large names into partnerships [8]:


“As a former chief sustainability o�cer for one of the world’s largest CPGs (“consumer packaged goods”) I had and still have a very


extensive network with other CPGs around the world and that was a big part of it.”


During our conversation with Switzer, he also seemed to con�rm to us that larger corporations are fairly loose on signing vague sustainability or


environmental partnerships:


“They’ll make these bets on all kinds of things whether its new technology or new enterprises or otherwise.”


Switzer also explained that turning such partnerships into production deals can take “one or two years” of due-diligence:


“…some of those things took one, or two years or more to qualify an additive or new type of plastic and there’s lot of reasons


for it…in order to even consider that material into a production line we would have to make sure what the potential impact is on our


production line. Is it going to contaminate anything? Do we have to worry about it?”


Switzer would not tell us whether Loop’s products were tested by multinationals (Pepsico, Coca-Cola, L’Oreal etc.) after announcing agreements,


nor would he answer questions as to whether or not he stood alongside the production line and watched the process work.


Former Loop Employee: Partners “Couldn’t See The Entire Process. They Had To Believe
The Results We Were Giving Them.”


A former employee of Loop told us that they didn’t think the potential partners could see Loop’s process from start to �nish before entering into


their partnerships:

“Danone spent an entire week with us. They wanted to see the process from the beginning to end…It was taking almost 2 weeks to


�nish a batch. So, they couldn’t see the entire process. They had to believe in the results we were giving them.”


Loop hasn’t disclosed a partnership with a major consumer brand name since Switzer resigned


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793219003217/llpp_8k.htm) last May.


On September 28, 2020, Loop announced (https://www.irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4473685) it had hired Sheila Morin as the company’s


Chief Marketing O�cer. Morin previously worked for both L’Oreal and Danone, two Loop partners, in the past.


Indorama Joint Venture: Announced By Loop In 2018 With An Expected Start Date Of Q1
2020 – Yet Indorama Tells Us The Project Is “Still Being Finalized”


One of the biggest partnerships the company touts is its joint venture with established global polyethylene manufacturer Indorama.


The 50-50 JV was announced (https://www.loopindustries.com/en/article/indorama-ventures) on September 24, 2018. Both Loop and Indorama


put $500,000 cash into the venture in April 2019 (https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2019/10/16/facility-to-depolymerize-up-to-88m-pounds-


of-pet-annually/).  The company announced that the JV would have “an exclusive world-wide license to use Loop’s technology to produce 100%


sustainably produced PET resin and polyester �ber with plans to begin commercial production in Q1 2020.”


Indorama was apparently so excited at the time that they suggested that Loop’s CEO should win a Nobel Prize, according to a 2019 article


(https://www.lesa�aires.com/bourse/nouvelles-economiques/la-quebecoise-loop-industries-veut-aider-pepsi-et-coke-a-prendre-le-virage-


vert/609536) (translated from French) [9]:


“Mr Solomita recalls the reaction of Indorama’s main �nancier when the duo introduced him to their new technology: “He said to me:


‘if what you are saying is true, you deserve a Nobel Prize!'”


That excitement seems to have worn o�. Now, both Loop and Indorama have indicated that the JV terms have not even been �nalized, almost 2


years after the announcement. Loop’s most recent 10-Q (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420010918/lp_10q.htm),


�led in October 2020 says:


“Discussions on the joint venture structure and �nancing are on-going.”


Indorama Exec #1: “The Project Is Still Being Finalized”


We reached out to Indorama to try to learn whether any work had been done to advance the project over the last two years.


Indorama’s SVP of Corporate Communications and Sustainability emailed us in mid-July saying they “cannot comment except to say [they] are


actively pursuing partnership with Loop”, then said immediately afterward “the project is still being �nalized”.


Indorama Exec #2: “Right Now, We Don’t Have Any Production”


We were also able to reach Sanjay Mehta, Chief Technology O�cer in the Business Recycling Group for Indorama Ventures at the Spartanburg


Plant in mid-August 2020:


“JV is in continuation mode and we continue to move forward and decide for the next quarter, how things are shaping relating to


Covid and how the market is…So we are very cautiously watching it and then we are going to make a call next quarter…”


He declined to say whether the Spartanburg plant had been retro�tted with any of the equipment needed for the Loop process. When we asked


him if there was any production using Loop’s technology now, Mehta commented:


“Right now we don’t have any production, that I can say. But I don’t want to give any more detail at this stage.”

Recently Announced Partnerships Seem to be Shi�ing Focus From Indorama


On September 3, 2020, Loop put out a press release (https://www.accesswire.com/604576/Loop-Industries-Completes-Its-In�nite-LoopTM-


Enhanced-Recycling-Technology-Package-Ready-for-Global-


Expansion#:~:text=in%20this%20Article-,Loop%20Industries%20Completes%20Its%20In�nite%20Loop(TM)%20Enhanced%20Recycling%20Techn


ology,Package%2C%20Ready%20for%20Global%20Expansion&text=In�nite%20Loop%E2%84%A2%20manufacturing%20facilities%20will%20prov


ide%20an%20end) announcing it had entered into an agreement to engage two outside �rms called Chemtex and Invista Performance


Technologies (https://ipt.invista.com/), the technology licensing arm of Invista, a major global producer of polymers and �ber.


The agreement is to help Loop develop its manufacturing processes, instead of collaborating with its longtime partners in Indorama, which has


decades of experience in polymer manufacturing.


The company further appeared to be shifting focus from Indorama by recently entering (https://www.suez.com/en/news/press-releases/loop-


industries-and-suez-announce-strategic-partnership-to-build-�rst-in�nite-loop-facility-producing) into a “strategic partnership” with SUEZ, a


traditional mechanical plastic recycler, to build Loop’s �rst “In�nite Loop” facility.


Given Indorama’s supposed close relationship to Loop, we can’t help but wonder why Indorama isn’t developing these facilities and – if it was


o�ered the chance – why it passed on the opportunity. The commissioning of Loop’s new facility is projected for 2023, though like the Indorama


joint venture, we doubt it comes to fruition.


Unlike Indorama, which is a chemical company with longstanding experience in end-to-end production of PET polymers, Suez is better known for


(https://www.suez.com/en/our-o�ering/businesses/what-are-you-looking-for/resources-management-consulting/include-more-recycled-plastic-


in-your-production-processes) sorting and managing waste streams and mechanically converting those into recyclable PET pellets.


A plastics industry source, with knowledge of Loop’s partnerships, told us:


“The competence of Suez makes sense because you have a partner dealing with the front end, the entire collecting, sorting, washing as


a pre-treatment of what then what goes into depolymerization. But what is lacking, and the announcement is silent, is who will be the


producer? Who will bring in the expertise for the entire production of depolymerization and polymerization again? Whether it is not


Indorama or is Indorama – it’s silent on that question.”


Loop Partner Thyssenkrupp: Contract With Loop Is “Basically” On “Inde�nite” Hold Due
To Indorama Partnership Going “Silent”


On December 19, 2018, Loop entered into (https://www.loopindustries.com/en/article/thyssenkrupp) a “Global Alliance Agreement” with the


industrial solutions division of ~$3 billion German multi-national engineering and steel company Thyssenkrupp. The press release boasted that


the agreement with that division, called Uhde Inventa-Fischer GmbH, would be a “strategic alliance expected to shape the future of PET and


Polyester manufacturing”.


The companies had planned to “license the respective technologies developed by Loop and thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions to manufacturing


partners in geographical regions around the world” by rolling out a “Waste To Resin” solution that would help companies achieve their goals of


using 100% sustainable PET and polyester. 


On October 12, 2020, we spoke to two senior executives at Uhde Inventa-Fischer GmbH.


We asked how they would characterize the state of Thyssenkrupp’s contract with Loop and were told by one senior executive that it was “on


hold” and contingent on whether or not Loop moves forward with its Indorama partnership:


“It’s depending on whether there will be a �rst project or not (with Indorama). If there’s no �rst project there’s no path forward…It’s


basically on hold. The contract is on hold and is silent on whether Indorama will further collaborate with Loop.”


A second executive at Uhde Inventa-Fischer GmbH con�rmed this to us, stating:

“At the moment this (contract) is more or less for an inde�nite time on hold. There was a project on-going with Loop but cooperation


stopped maybe three months ago for the project with Indorama and since then according to my knowledge there is no further


cooperation on-going and no further cooperation is planned.”


The second executive also told us that Thyssenkrupp was supposed to be involved, to some degree, in the Indorama partnership, but that it’s


“not happening at the moment”:


“For the contract between Loop and Indorama I don’t know. That’s between them. But for our part we delivered the basic but there’s


no further contract between us and Loop. At one time we talked about being involved in the detail but it’s not happening for the


moment.”


Drink�nity: A Short-Lived And Questionable Partnership With PepsiCo That Already
Appears To Be On Its Last Legs


Another partnership that showed early promise appears to be on its way out.


In February 2017, the company signed a service agreement with Drink�nity, a subsidiary of Pepsi, to provide customers with mailing envelopes


so they can recycle their Drink�nity pods. [S-A, Pg. 1 (https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001477932-17-002605.html?


hash=eece568f7e6a9dcd46fcad34b22534199969efa5c2853350a4eefd500ae20e12&dest=LLPP_EX108_HTM#LLPP_EX108_HTM)]


A former employee told us of the program that one of the elements of the pods “is an aluminum foil, which could never be recovered


by Loop’s process, being a metal”:


“In fact, in our tests, �nal PTA was highly contaminated by aluminum and was hard to remove being soluble in water like the PTA and


insoluble in the solvents used to depolymerize the PET.”


As one article pointed out (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226821-loop-industries-problems-are-plastic) in 2018:


“The bags in which LOOP asks customers to send their empty Drink�nity pods in are made from LDPE (low-density polyethylene)


plastic, which LOOP’s technology cannot recycle – thereby appearing to place Loop in violation of their own agreement to recycle the


packaging.”


A Seeking Alpha author (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226821-loop-industries-problems-are-plastic) ordered and scanned a shipping label


for the Drink�nity partnership. The label included in the article showed the pods were being mailed to St. Albans, Vermont.

Drink�nity Partner: “I Don’t Know How Long Our Part In This Will Last…It’s Not
Particularly Lucrative…We Don’t Make Sh*t Doing It.”


We contacted the businesses listed at the St. Albans address this year and learned that the Drink�nity packages were being mailed to D&M


Spools Prep (https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk008lI-

recycling company. When reached for comment, D&M con�rmed they were the middleman for receiving these pods in the U.S. and that the pods


were then shipped to Montreal.


A D&M employee told us they were “currently under contract to send [the pods] back to Loop Industries in Canada”, adding “I know very little


about what happens to the pods when they leave here.”


The employee told us that they had gone up to visit Loop in the hopes of entering into an agreement with them (outside of the Drink�nity


middle-man deal) but, after several months of waiting, learned that Loop wasn’t able to process D&M’s PET scraps:


“What their part is, I really have no idea. The way we got to know them (Loop) is we deal with PET – a lot of PET scraps. We had


gone up to visit this company and they could supposedly turn it back into a liquid form – some sort of way. We sent them samples of


our stu� and there was too many contaminants in it for them to be able to do it so we never really did anything with them.”


We asked if they were able to verify Loop’s process. They told us they were not and that it was “more of a meet-and-greet”:


“We weren’t allowed in – I don’t know if they had a laboratory set up. I don’t even know if we were on the actual site where they did it.


It was a very small complex we went to. It was basically more just o�ces. It was more of just a meet-and-greet.”


O�ering us their �nal thoughts on the partnership with Loop, they said:


“I don’t know how long our part in this is going to last. I don’t know if we’ll re-up. It’s not particularly lucrative for us. We don’t make


sh*t doing it.”


It looks as though neither Pepsi, nor Loop, have kept up with the program. Drink�nity’s (former) website at www.drink�nity.com

In a Highly Unusual Move, The Company Hasn’t Published Any Of Its Recovery Rates Or
Purity Standards Since 2017, Before It Began its Flagship Generation II Process.


In Loop’s October 2020 investor presentation


(https://www.loopindustries.com/assets/docs/Loop%20Industries%20Investor%20Presentation%20-%20Q2%202021.pdf?1072414598), it refers


to its technology as “proven” and claims that its end product is of “unparalleled purity”.


Many leading plastics companies (and startup companies in various scienti�c disciplines) publish peer reviewed studies or white papers that


detail their advancements in the �eld. Contrary to that practice, we were unable to �nd a single peer reviewed study or white paper in any


scholarly journal describing Loop’s process.


For comparison, French competitor Carbios published a study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2149-4) in Nature in April 2020


showing their small-batch study, after a 10-hour reaction time, recovered 90% of base plastic building blocks (monomers). Carbios is part of an


o�cial consortium (https://carbios.fr/en/nestle-waters-pepsico-and-suntory-beverage-food-europe-join-consortium-founded-by-carbios-and-


loreal-to-support-the-worlds-�rst-enzymatic-technology-for-the-recycling-of-plastic/) between L’Oreal, Pepsico, Nestle Waters, and other major


brands.


Our 30-Year Polymers Expert Consultant Called The Lack of Publications “Suspect”


We reached out to one expert in polymers/plastics with 30 years’ experience who has worked as a chemist for over three decades, holds several


patents and has speci�c experience working with advanced methods of plastic recycling.


One of the things he asked us for was analytics on Loop’s process. But Loop doesn’t appear to have reported purity standards or recovery rates


for its process since February 2017 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793218000204/llpp_10ka.htm) – something that


our chemist found ba�ing:


“It should be very straight forward. The analytical is the ‘proof’ of a process.  Anything short of complete analytical support of a


process should be suspect.  The ‘secret sauce’ has no e�ect on the resultant analytical results of the products. Why won’t they share


the process vs. analytical?  I think I know why.”


30-Year Expert In Polymers: Loop’s Gen II Process Isn’t New, Isn’t Simple Or Easy, Isn’t
Pro�table And Involves Technology That Already Exists


The same 30-year expert told us that the company’s GEN II process involves technology that has existed for decades and is well known in the


industry. He told us that when PET was �rst developed in 1941, then marketed by DuPont in 1951, scientists would have already “had a �rm


understanding of the properties” of the plastic. He said that rigorous testing leading up to the �rst bottle patent in 1973 meant the industry likely


had a “thorough” understanding of hydrolysis and solvent resistance by then.


He noted that he did not see any type of special catalyst or trade secret in the patent that would preclude somebody else from doing the exact


same thing that Loop is doing.  


He said of Loop’s process:

“…the chemistry is there and has been there.  Implying that it is ‘new’ and implying that it is ‘simple/ easy,’ and pro�table as a


standalone process, just isn’t true.”


Second Expert Consultant With 45 Years’ Experience: Loop’s Type Of Process Is “Very Well
Known”


We also reached out to a second expert who has decades of experience with plastics and has worked in a number of positions in the industry,


including as a project scientist for a company that merged with a $40 billion chemical company. 


The second expert told us:


“I would concur with that opinion. He is right in saying it’s very well-known processing. Big companies like Coca Cola and so forth


have been doing this for a number of years – depolymerizing.


But the purity of the materials they are working with originally is kind of high. They’re just recycling their own materials. But to get all


the gunk out of there – with caps and paper – it’s kind of like a laborious process and has to come about pretty quickly before you


even get to this point (depolymerization).”


During a discussion about how base chemicals could be reformed into usable PET plastic, we asked the second expert whether or not it would be


a tough �eld to just break into for a new player, given the massive scale and already existing best practices in the industry by the major chemical


companies:


“That’s correct. Boy you said it right there. I concur with that 100%. Yes, best practices – and many of those best practices are trade


secrets as well.”


Loop Competitor: “We Could Not See Any Big Di�erence” From Loop and What Was Already
Known in The Field Of Chemical Decomposition Of PET


We also reached out to a C-suite employee of a competitor for help on understanding how the advanced recycling �eld views Loop. We were


o�ered a similar take to what our chemist told us, that Loop’s process is relatively well known:


“We started to pay attention (and) the �rst point to us was that the patent itself was not very detailed in the way things were done. We


could not see any big di�erence away from what was already well known in the �eld of chemical decomposition of PET.”


30-Year Expert In Polymers: Loop’s Process For Breaking Down PET Plastic Is “Basic Stu�”,
But Its Puri�cation Process Is A Black Box


A polymer expert we spoke to told us that Loop’s processes for breaking down PET plastic are already well known, but that purifying the broken


down plastic is the di�cult step. He called this step in Loop’s process a “black box”.


What ba�ed him most was how the company could get from broken down PET plastic to usable, puri�ed PET chemical building blocks again. He


told us:


“I haven’t seen any references as to how Loop is re�ning the products to a usable form.  Typically, processes such as distillation are


used to re�ne, but that depends on the analytical results.”


He also told us that he believed this information has been omitted speci�cally because the process likely isn’t viable. He referred to Loop’s


process as “basic stu�” and told us:


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
“The detailed information for either process is readily available to anyone.  No ‘secret catalyst’ or ‘patented formulation’ additive


is required.  I do not know if any of the speci�c chemical pathways fall under someone’s current patent though.  Wouldn’t think so. 


It’s basic stu�.”


We asked our chemist about the company’s statement that their “proprietary technology breaks down PET into its base chemicals, Puri�ed


Terephthalic Acid (PTA) and Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG), at a recovery rate of over 90% and under normal atmospheric pressure and at room


temperature”. [Pg. 6 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793218000206/llpp_10qa.htm)]


He told us that products created after breaking down the PET aren’t pure at that stage and need to be puri�ed further to make the puri�ed and


usable end-product the company touts:


“…the ‘products’ are not pure. They really can’t be used unless pure. The statement is kind of misleading, in my opinion.  While


90% conversion sounds good, it really isn’t.  Polymerization is tricky.  Contamination is really bad.”


Loop’s recent agreement (https://www.accesswire.com/604576/Loop-Industries-Completes-Its-In�nite-LoopTM-Enhanced-Recycling-Technology-


Package-Ready-for-Global-


Expansion#:~:text=in%20this%20Article-,Loop%20Industries%20Completes%20Its%20In�nite%20Loop(TM)%20Enhanced%20Recycling%20Techn

ide%20an%20end) with Chemtex and Invista, announced on September 3, 2020, indicates further to us that Loop has not shored up all parts of


its process. Rather, it signals that the company is seeking help with puri�cation and repolymerization. A former Loop employee, when asked


about the agreement, con�rmed it was likely because Loop needed help with this portion of its process.


45-Year Expert In Polymers/Plastics: “The Chemical Industry Has Been Working On [Re-
Polymerization] For 50 Years”


Our second expert agreed that the puri�cation portion of the process is where any secret sauce would be, and Loop hadn’t demonstrated any


advancements. He concurred that this was the most challenging part of the process, telling us:


“The chemical industry has been working on this for 50 years. Or more. And they’ve put together very e�cient processes in order to


make the pure PET polymer.”


Loop Competitor: Puri�cation Of Polymers Was The Key Question With Loop & The
Sudden Switch To Gen II Was “Very Weird”


The competitor that we spoke to echoed the concerns of our chemist, telling us that puri�cation of polymers was paramount and that the


company’s sudden switch from Gen I to Gen II was “very weird”.


The competitor told us:


“Our question was how are they going to deal with this the moment that they purify the polymers and they must guarantee


some food grade PET at the end, because that was the original purpose.”


Speaking about the switch from Generation I to Generation II, the same competitor said:


“If today our CEO came to us and told us you know what we’re going to change our reactions in terms of the impact, the


reactor itself, but mostly the puri�cation, what I would say is ‘Are you crazy? Are we restarting everything from scratch?’”


He continued:


“You are changing your impact on your business model. To us on the outside to us it sounded very weird.”

Loop Competitor Con�rms: Separation Of Dyes Is “Hardest Part” Of The Process


The same competitor con�rmed what our chemist and former employees had already told us; that puri�cation and the separation of dyes was


the crux of the process:


“Because the separation from the dyes and the organic element that are inside the PET waste and potentially dissolve in


liquid is the most challenging part. It is where you have to start inserting some catalyst which is actually what most of our


competitors tried to do, or in the case of Ionica they used some magnetic nanoparticles. But if you use a catalyst then you start to


see chemical elements appearing in the �nal PET after you have depolymerized and this is where you get troubles with the


puri�cation.”


A former employee provided us with the details regarding Loop’s attempts to try and wash the PET with either water, P4 (dichloromethane) or


both and the potential to reuse P4 without purifying it. The goal was to see if washing PET with used P4 could remove some dyes and make the


�nal puri�cation of MEG easier.


“No success,” we were told by the employee. “It was impossible to separate the di�erent layers and recover the non-depolymerized PET.”


(Pictured Preliminary tests taken place
at Loop attempting to remove dyes and
colors from raw material prior to the
complete depolymerization process.)


30-Year Expert In Polymers: “I Don’t See How You Could Make Any Money Or Save Any
Money” Using Loop’s Process. “It’s A Scam In That Sense”.


We also inquired with our �rst expert as to why everybody in the plastics industry was not utilizing Loop’s process if it was as revolutionary as the


company claimed. He responded:


“Everyone isn’t doing it because I don’t see how you could make any money or save any money in doing it.”


He concluded, upon his overview of the company’s Gen II process information that was available on the company’s website, by telling us:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
“It appears to me that they took a very complex process, signi�cantly simpli�ed it, omitted a lot of serious stu�, and only mentioned


the favorable highlights. I would say it’s a ‘scam’ in that sense.”


Loop Competitor: We Heard �umors “Something May Not Be Working” At Loop. Their
Credibility as A Competitor Is “Much Lower Than It Was 2-3 Years Ago”.


One of Loop’s competitors also told us that they were no longer worried about Loop as a competitor and that industry rumors were indicating to


them that something may be amiss. They told us:


“With Loop, it’s sort of another world. We never met them in person, just secondhand speech. But to us, it’s not at the same level of


competition that we thought it was….


If you sum all the things with the �uctuations of the stock value, of the contradictory information that we are provided in the quarterly


reviews. Also copy and pasting of sentences in some press releases from other companies… All of these to us was a symptom of


something going on behind the scenes that was not completely understandable to us.”


Plastic Recycling Partner Of �35 Billion Dow: “…I Never Heard Of These Guys Ever. Nobody
Has Ever Talked To Me About Their Technology.”


To better understand whether Loop has had a meaningful impact on the recycling industry, and whether or not they are truly “on the radar” of


large multi-national corporations, we reached out to large conglomerates to ask their opinion of Loop.


We were able to reach Rick Perez, CEO of Avangard Innovative, Houston, whose company announced (https://resource-


recycling.com/plastics/2020/01/15/avangard-to-supply-dow-with-pcr-pellets/) a partnership with $35 billion market cap Dow in 2020, supplying


post-consumer plastic �lm pellets to Dow.


He told us he had “never heard” of Loop and that “nobody has ever talked to [him] about [Loop’s] technology”:


“You need a team of people who know what they’re doing. I don’t know them (Loop). I never heard of them. Never been aware of any


brand owner or converter (that has talked about them) and we move in the largest and biggest scale in the world and I never heard of


these guys ever. Nobody has ever talked to me about their technology.”


When we described Loop’s process to him, he seemed uninspired:


“If you built the polymer then you can break it back down. I don’t consider that recycling. You bring it back to raw materials and put it


back together again from the molecules. What is its carbon footprint…Are you really creating something environmentally friendly or


just bringing a di�erent process to the waste stream?”


Executive At Loop Partner Thyssenkrupp: Loop “Underestimated” Costs And
“Underestimated” Process A�er Breaking Down PET To Its Base Chemicals


One senior executive we spoke to at Thyssenkrupp’s industrial division, when asked if he was familiar with Loop’s process, admitted to us they


had “seen the weaknesses” in Loop’s process and alluded to cost being the “crucial point” on whether or not Loop’s process is viable:


“We got certain understanding (of Loop’s technology) by working on the development of a potential �rst integrated plant and have


some insight there and a certain understanding of the potential of the technology and of certain ways to go and certain time and


developments needed. We’ve also seen the weaknesses. I believe it’s more a matter of how economical such a technology at the end of


day is. I would say you will always �nd a technical solution potentially. But what is the OPEX and CAPEX price for it? That’s the crucial


point…”


A second executive told us that “the cooperation with Loop was very di�cult” and that is why they stopped their Global Alliance agreement. He


also said: Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
“The technology is available but they underestimated the cost I would say. So when they say it’s a pro�table process, then going


into the detailed �gures it turns out it might be pro�table but there’s a long way to go. And then there was a personal character


thing which made things di�cult.”


The second executive also con�rmed to us that the puri�cation portion of Loop’s process and the isolation of the base chemicals were stages in


the process Loop had “underestimated”:


“The depolymerization de�nitely worked. The enzymes they’re using worked �ne. But once you have a depolymerized solution then you


need some kind of cleaning of that solution. You need to separate what the depolymerization process is giving you. It’s the separation


they underestimated. It’s not their core business. They say they’re just focusing on depolymerization but the necessary cleaning


steps of the solution were underestimated.”


Loop Has Never Generated Revenue And Warns Investors It May Never Achieve Or
Maintain Pro�tability


Loop has never generated revenue and has an accumulated de�cit of $62.3 million. [Pg. F-1


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420010918/lp_10q.htm)] It has a history of widening net losses that leave us little


faith that the company will ever generate income on its bottom line (or produce meaningful top line revenue, for that matter).


(Source: FactSet)


Loop has about $48 million in cash, given its balance last quarter


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000165495420010918/lp_10q.htm) and including a recent secondary o�ering


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504678/000147793220005518/lp_8k.htm). With a quarterly burn rate of about $5 million and


planned capital expenditures for its production facility, we expect the company will need to raise more equity in order to advance its plans,


should it ever choose to do so.


Conclusion And 15 Questions We Believe Management Should Answer


We think Loop’s claimed breakthroughs, which represent the entirety of its business prospects, simply don’t exist.


We also think investors in Loop deserve answers to the following questions:


1. Was Daniel Solomita aware that Henry Lorin was a convict who had pled guilty to securities fraud charges when he was engaged to help
raise early capital for Loop?


2. If so, why did you hire a convict to help with your early capital raising e�orts?
3. Were you aware that Lance Bauerlein was under an active indictment for criminal securities fraud charges when you met with him to help


facilitate Loop’s initial $80,000 investment?
4. Did you expect that appointing two inexperienced individuals in their twenties with no post-graduate education in the sciences would yield


a revolutionary breakthrough in the �eld of plastics recycling?
5. According to several former employees, the R&D lab run by the Essaddams was producing results that couldn’t be replicated outside of


their lab. How do you respond?

6. Why does the company have two distinct labs? Is it best practice to limit access of the company’s scientists to a lab where major
breakthroughs are said to be occurring?


7. Loop’s competitors have published advancements and �ndings in scienti�c journals. Can Loop point us toward any relevant publications? If
not, why has Loop not done this, despite all of the company’s claimed breakthroughs?


8. When Loop claimed in 2017 that it was able to break down PET to its monomers at industrial grade purity, had MEG been consistently and
successfully isolated at the time? Former employees state that it was mixed with dyes, water, and solid wastes. How do you respond?


9. In 2016, Loop claimed to break down PET at a recovery rate of 100%. A polymer expert with over three decades of experience and former
employees have described this recovery rate as “impossible”. How do you respond?


10. Can you quantify exactly how much plastic Loop has recycled in conjunction with L’Oreal, Coca-Cola, and Danone since the announcement
of these partnerships? Has there been any o�take from these companies, and if so, how much?


11. Have L’Oreal, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Danone actually seen the entire Gen II process work from start to �nish, using actual post-consumer
waste PET?


12. Why has it taken over 2 years to �nalize terms of the joint venture with Indorama? Further, why did the company recently engage new
partners instead of furthering its cooperation with Indorama?


13. What is the status of the Drink�nity partnership, given that the website doesn’t even appear to function?
14. Why were Drink�nity bags made with LDPE when Loop can’t recycle that plastic?
15. We understand the company’s patents deal with depolymerization, but we also know these methods to be relatively well known already.


Does the company have a patent on any speci�c puri�cation methods that can be proven to purify PET monomers in way that exceeds the
industry’s current best practices at an industrial scale?


We look forward to Loop’s answers to all of the above questions.

Have you tried getting an informant to apply for a job to the company? Much could be learned in the “interview” process–including site visits, and


review of the NDA forms.

I’ve been suspicious of these guys since the �rst time they sent me a press release. They were silent for a long time — I wondered why no PR


about their progress — only PR about their JVs with the big brand owners. Looks like Pepsi, Coke, etc. didn’t vet this group very good — the desire


for the Holy Grail of recycling is so strong that these brand owners, it seems, will grasp onto anything without any vetting whatsoever. Keep me


posted on further information. I am Senior Contributing Editor with PlasticsToday.com and have been in the plastics industry for 35 years.

Unlike GRWG, the one thing that seems missing here is large insider selling of shares.


Maybe they really believe in their process, or are just drinking the Kool-Aid that they will eventually get there a la Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos.

I fear there are more like this out there. As a journalist for the plastics industry, I’ve become very suspicious over the past 2 years. I’ve seen a lot


of big promises (in the millions of tons) for recycling plastic waste, a lot of fanfare over proposed plants, a lot of money gotten from investors and


then —- crickets! I’ve had some o�-the-record conversations with some industry insiders who also have been questioning. It appears to be an


industry ripe for taking the money and running! I’m watching closely!

Great work!


Essaddam's ex-employer at Ventix says:


December 3, 2020 at 8:34 am (https://hindenburgresearch.com/loop/#comment-42491)


I have myself hired the Essaddams when they arrived in Canada in late 2011, his sons were still in highschool, and the father sold me thick black


smoke and got me and other shareholders into investing personal money for over 225 000$ plus commitments to banks and others before


leaving 2,5 years later, to work for Daniel Solomita who promised to pay him hundreds of dollars ”to catch �ies” (in his own words)!!! Then,


Essaddam sued us for false reasons just to weaken us, which largely lead us to go bankrupt.


Hatem Essaddam is the most dishonest and mal intention person I know, only eager for his own personal wealth, and he is now working with


someone I have heard was no angel either in his previous business Dragon Polymers (at least one of his associate seems to have been arrested


for major �nancial fraud in the province of Quebec, Canada). So in clear, what’s written in the Hindenburg report, I have lived most of it, making


me, my ex-associates and my other ex-employee (Ph D) de�nitely supportive of all allegations provided in the Hindenburg report.


Here’s a press release that followed the Hindenburg report publication (use Google translate for better understanding):

LOOP: Depolymerizing Fiction to Distill Facts


We review key assertions by Hindenburg which are presented to discredit LOOP’s independent technology review. Similar to the �rst short


report, we question the accuracy and / or understanding of a good portion of the report’s assertions. At best, they are from sources unfamiliar


with the technology. At worst, they intentionally leave out material information to bolster their argument.


The Hindenburg report takes shots at LOOP’s independent technology review by questioning Kemitek’s process and role. We question many of


the short report’s assertions as it either leaves critical information out of their statements or just represents a poor understanding of the


process. The report relies on unnamed former employee(s) and a “chemist,” neither of whom do we know their backgrounds or credentials.


Further, these sources provide comments, which we frankly �nd lacking in merit or understanding of the LOOP process. In the end, the Kemitek


report should provide a level of con�dence that LOOP’s technology is valid and investors should refocus on LOOP’s execution on the buildout of


its In�nite LOOP facility. For an overview of the Kemitek report please see our note HERE.


Former employee represented as key insider. Several comments by the employee source(s) lead us to question their depth of knowledge and


expertise. Further, at a minimum it is likely the source has not been at the company for several years. We glean this from most of the


commentary in the original short report, which appeared to be centered on Gen I technology. Key assertions attributed to the employee source


which lead us to question their credentials are as follows:


■ Questions around PET source material. The employee source suggests that PET input material should include “rock and sand for more accurate
tests.” Anyone with rudimentary understanding of �ltration processes would know rock & sand can be easily be separated by settling tanks or


other cheap and inexpensive processes. This comment does not “�oat.” Further, the short report’s “chemist” questions the composition of the


PET source material. Our work with multiple recycling companies and channel checks with plastic recycling aggregators indicate PET material is


contracted at speci�c concentration levels. For example, some suppliers will provide material which is 85% PET while others provide material


which is 95% PET. For reference, mechanical recyclers who rely on post-consumer waste (curb side pickup) contract for material in the 50-60%


range, however, this is overwhelmingly PET bottles.


■ Purity concerns don’t work either. As per a direct quote: “The employees told us that 98.2 – 98.9% MEG purity in the review was far from the
99.9% MEG purity that was expected.” In our work with LOOP, it has never expressed the need for these levels of purity. Secondly, MEG purity


levels reported in the Kemitek report are in line with the LOOP’s MEG speci�cation, which was approved by the European Chemical Agency on


November 17, 2020. The approval states LOOP’s MEG is within EU standards and the monomer can be imported or manufactured in the region.Privacy  - Terms

LOOP’s DMT monomer received the same approval on December 7, 2020. Finally, the other trace monomers found in the MEG are actually used


in PET production and as noted by Kemitek in its report “these additional monomers (DMI, DMT, BHET, MHET) found at presented levels are


appropriate for PET production.” This key comment was not presented in the short report.


• Data is averaged or selected for better results. The report and source state data is presented inconsistently and questions why two “batches” of


MEG were combined for analysis purposes- inferring that this was done to average for better results. This inference highlights a lack of


understanding with the process and pilot plant set up. The depolymerization process does not create DMT and MEG in 1:1 ratio. The process


train creates MEG material which is approximately 1/3 of the output, with DMT accounting for the other output. In the MEG process


approximately 800kg of used PET material is inputted with an output of 264kg (33%). The next step in the process is distillation towers which


require 500kg of material – hence two runs are required. Kemitek would likely have �agged the issue if runs were combined for better results.


• Not ready for prime time? The former employee states LOOP’s process is not ready for industrialization and scale up to production level. This


assertion is based on Kemitek’s comment that certain processes during their test & review needed intervention including clogged lines. However,


Kemitek noted that these type issues are common in pilot sized equipment. Further, Kemitek’ business is to help companies to scale. Kemitek


likely has a greater insight into this issue than a former employee who we believe has not seen the Gen II process.


Chemist with 30 years’ experience. As for the chemist with 30 years’ experience. Who are they? What’s their expertise with plastic monomers /


polymers? Are they practicing? What’s their formal education? Do they have experience with technology transfer and scaling up processes? Have


they spoken with management to get better understanding of their questions or are they casual observers opining on process technology?


Conclusion – rubber hits the road. At the end of the day, the key question is whether LOOP’s technology can scale economically. Since we began


our work, we have maintained this has been a risk and will be a risk until a commercial plant answers the question. We also believe the LOOP


business model incrementally de- risks itself as it moves closer to commercialization. This includes validation of the process, material supply


contracts with CPG groups and the development and signing of agreements with producers. These steps have been completed via agreements


from multiple CPG companies, Suez, and Indorama. In our view, the next substantial step for LOOP, and the focus for investors, should be the


ordering of long lead time equipment and shovels hitting the ground for its In�nite LOOP facility.


The short report questions the background of the scientists, labs, other processes and raises questions from years ago which are not germane to


the current positioning. This is done to create a perception of more questions than answers. In the end, the Kemitek report addresses the validity


of the technology and should refocus investors on LOOP executing on the build out of its In�nite LOOP facility.

Dear Harry Benisatto. As a Loop Industries investor I would be very glad to discuss with you your opinion on Loop’s commercialization process.


To be honest with you, your comment has dissolved some of my fears about Loop. It seems like you may know something more than I do, and I


believe we could have a productive exchange of information. It is really important to me as my stake in this company is not in the 5 or 6 �gure


range. My business email is alexander.weisschield@mail.ru (mailto:alexander.weisschield@mail.ru)

Please consider a similar analysis/evaluation of BioCellection. IMO this is another over-sold piece of hype, smoke, and mirrors also in the plastics


recycling arena.

Hello, you did an excellent job.


I will surely dig this and recommend this to my colleagues, in my opinion.


I’m sure that this platform would help them.
