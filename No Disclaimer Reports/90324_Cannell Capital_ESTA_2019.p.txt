ESTA Overview


+ Breast implants are facing heightened scrutiny: The US FDA issued warning letters to
implant manufacturers and held an advisory meeting on the subject. France and Brazil
have both recalled certain breast implants. Competitors have indicated falling demand
across the board.


+ ESTA claims that its implants are substantially safer than its FDA-approved
competitors. A closer look at ESTA's "studies" reveals them to be farcical in design
and/or carrying heavy conflicts of interest. In fact, ESTA may have supplied the SEC and
investors with misleading information in calling one of its critical studies "independent."


+ ESTA's entanglements with Dolan Park Hospital in the U.K. appear to have gifted the
Company a pliable customer and yielded a vaunted "independent" study of dubious
integrity.


+ ESTA is rife with related party transactions and asset purchases from former
distributors. Our back of the envelope estimates suggest at least ~$8 million of revenue
(~30% of 2018's revenue growth) was derived from recently purchased distributors and
"inside" parties.


+ Big red flags are apparent in ESTA's accounting in the form of near-zero product
return allowance, extremely high levels of inventory, several going concern clauses, a
peripatetic CEO and a physically detached CFO.


+ ESTA defaulted on its debt in 2018 before going public. 2018 interest expense is
equivalent to 39% of balance sheet debt. The Company came public with a going
concern clause.


+ ESTA will most likely have to raise equity capital in 2019.


+ ESTA's valuation is unreasonably high compared to peers and industry deal multiples.


+ Insiders own 54% of ESTA. Shares came off lockup on January 15, 2019. We suspect
insiders were barred from selling until ESTA filed its 10-K which it did on March 20,
2019.


+ All use of emphasis [boldface] below is added by this author unless otherwise noted.
Global Regulatory Scrutiny


Establishment Labs Holdings, Inc. ("ESTA" or the "Company") sells its Motiva breast
implants in 60 countries, excluding the US. Motiva accounts for 90% of revenues.


ESTA is the first Costa Rican company to go public on a US exchange. The Company
has two manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica.


ESTA claims its smooth textured implants achieve the highest safety outcomes in the
world due to the "bioengineered cell-friendly surface" of its "SilkSurface" and
"SmoothSilk" products. Other products include the Divina 3D simulation device for pre-
op visualization & Puregraft gel for tissue contouring.


The Company has grown through expanded global distribution. In 2016 and 2017, ESTA
began selling through distributors in Australia, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and South
Korea.


ESTA initiated a study in April 2018 with the intention of gaining US FDA Premarket
Approval ("PMA") for Motiva. As part of this study, ESTA is enrolling 800 patients across
40 sites in the US, Canada, Germany and Sweden. Enrollment for this study is expected
to close in Q2 2019. In an August 15, 2018, report, BTIG analyst Sean Lavin wrote of
his expectation that ESTA could gain FDA approval in 2021 or 2022.


The MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas published the largest
(~100,000 women) and longest (13 years) study on silicone breast implant safety in
September 2018. The study revealed heightened safety risks for silicone implants:


"According to the study, which reflected data from two implant manufacturers, one
group of patients with one brand of silicone implants reported a two to eight-times
higher frequency of Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and
melanoma compared to the general population. The other group of patients with
another brand of silicone implants used for reconstruction reported scleroderma,
Sjogren syndrome and dermatomyositis more than twice as often as the general
public." "Silicone implants are associated with an increased risk of certain rare harms;
associations need to be further analyzed with patient-level data to provide conclusive
evidence." Source.

https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/largest-ever-study-shows-silicone-breast-implants-associated-with-rare-diseases.h00-159227301.html
From April 1992 to October 2003, the FDA essentially banned silicone breast implants in
the United States. The FDA has started to act:


On February 6, 2019, the FDA issued a letter to healthcare providers seeking to
"increase awareness about an association between all breast implants, regardless
of filling or texture and Breast-Implant Associated-Anaplastic Large Cell
Lymphoma."


On March 18, 2019, the FDA sent warning letters to Mentor, a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and to Sientra, Inc. (SIEN), two of three approved US
implant manufacturers, citing a failure to provide "continuing evaluation by the
applicant on the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of the device" which was a
condition of reinstating implant sales.


On March 25 and 26, 2019 the FDA held an advisory panel to discuss the safety of
silicone breast implants, including presentations by MD Anderson and Breast
Implant Victim Advocacy. Representatives from the relevant European and
Canadian regulatory bodies also attended.


Since the MD Anderson study was published, Brazilian health authorities (#2 market for
breast implants market in the world) and French health authorities have suspended the
sales of certain breast implants. On February 19, 2019 Health Canada announced an
investigation into implants to be completed this spring.


In the face of this escalating scrutiny, ESTA argues their differentiated smooth surface
product could benefit by capturing market share from older textured implants:


"Motiva Implants are clearly differentiated from any other implant sold today. And we
believe this [indiscernible] result in fewer complications than textured or traditional
smooth implants."


"Especially in these times, our story is resonating more than ever as surgeons and
women seek both an improved safety profile and a natural aesthetic that is more in
line with their expectations."

ESTA Safety Claims & Studies


ESTA's claims of a favorable market shift seem unlikely given that every US FDA-
approved implant manufacturer including Allergan PLC (AGN), the world's largest, offers
smooth implant products. Furthermore, there is evidence of breast implant demand
falling across the board regardless of texture type given recent results from SIEN which
derives only ~5% of its breast implant revenues from textured products.


On its March 12, 2019, earnings call SIEN's CEO Jeffrey Nugent said:


"A recent dialogue with plastic surgeons indicates that consultations and procedure
volumes in the first quarter have declined modestly due to the media coverage of
breast implants, that has increased over the last few months. We expect this to
potentially continue into the second quarter and impact the first half of the year."


Following the call, William Blair analyst Margaret Kaczor cut her SIEN breast implant
revenue estimate by 17% for 2019 and 20% for 2020.


It is too early to rule out meaningful risk from smooth implants such as those sold by
ESTA. Referring to Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-
ALCL), a cancer observed at relatively high rates in women with breast implants, the
FDA noted in a recent filing:


"While the majority of patients who develop BIA-ALCL have had textured implants,
and most cases reported in the literature describe individuals who have had textured
implants, there have been reports of BIA-ALCL in patients with smooth-surfaced
implants and many reports do not include the surface texture of the implant at
the time of diagnosis. The denominator for the number of textured and smooth
implants in the US is also not known to determine whether relatively more cases
are observed with one implant type versus another implant type." Source.


Given heightened scrutiny of breast implants in both the US and abroad, we expect
regulators to carefully inspect all manufacturer safety claims. Careful examination of the
studies ESTA relies upon to make its safety claims reveal significant red flags and
incidents of heavily conflicted researchers.

ESTA claims Motiva is significantly safer than its FDA-approved US competitors. Here
are safety figures for the "Big Three" as reported by ESTA in its S-1 filing:


Source: ESTA S-1 dated June 21, 2018


ESTA's S-1 details three studies on which the Company bases its safety claims the (1)
Post Market Surveillance Study (2) Dolan Park Clinic "Independent" Study and (3) a
Prospective Trial in Costa Rica.


(1) Post Market Surveillance Study


ESTA claims to have less than a 0.1% rate of capsular contracture and ruptures
compared to respective averages of 14.0% and 14.6% for its FDA-approved
competitors.


Source: ESTA S-1 dated June 21, 2018


These odd claims are based on the Company's "post market surveillance data" which
use self-reported information. Data were only included if patients or doctors chose to
reach out directly to ESTA, the product manufacturer. The data was not collected at
mandatory follow-ups as is typical of post-market surveillance studies. ESTA is clear on
this point, stating in its June 21, 2018 S-1 that "In contrast to the above competitor data,
our data is self-reported rather than collected at mandatory follow-ups and was
generated solely for our post-market surveillance…" Furthermore, the data was
"internally tracked" allowing room for manipulation. The data also exclude certain
reoperations "not related to safety" in the subjective opinion of ESTA.

Sientra (SIEN), Allergan (AGN) and Mentor's results reflect peer-reviewed multi-year
studies conducted by scientists. ESTA's "surveillance" lacks academic rigor and is not
comparable to the results of peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted by its
competitors. In our opinion, this presentation by ESTA is suspiciously disingenuous and
arguably reckless, given apparent conflicts of interest around these safety claims.


(2) The Dolan Park Clinic "Independent" Study


The Dolan Park Clinic ("Dolan Park") in Bromsgrove, England conducted an
"independent" study of the safety of ESTA's Motiva implants from April 2013 to April
2016 (Sforza et al.) culminating in a peer-reviewed article in the Aesthetic Surgery
Journal on September 14, 2017. The study is the only peer-reviewed comprehensive
study on the safety of ESTA's implants with a meaningful sample size. It is therefore
deeply important to the company.


The result of this "independent" single site three-year study showed "overall rates of
complication and reoperation of 0.76% over an interval of three years" versus three-year
reoperation rates of approximately 8.4% for ESTA's FDA-approved competitors.


Dr. Marcos Sforza serves as the Medical Director of the Dolan Park Clinic and was the
lead author for the study. The Aesthetic Surgery Journal article in question states:


"During the study period, Prof. Sforza declared no potential conflicts of interest
with respect to the research, authorship, and publication of this article. In 2017 (after
the study was completed and was submitted to this journal), Prof. Sforza
accepted a position at Establishment Lab's Medical Advisory Board."


Source


However, according to an August 16, 2018 correspondence letter with the SEC, ESTA
discloses "Dr. Sforza also received an option grant in September 2016 for 36,953
Class A Ordinary Shares." This would seem to directly contradict Dr. Sforza's peer-
reviewed article stating that he accepted a position in 2017 and declared "no potential
conflict of interest." This quantity of shares is worth nearly $900,000 today.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000162828018008193/filename1.htm
According to the editors of the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Dr. Sforza submitted the
article for publishing on December 17, 2016. Therefore, Dr. Sforza had already received
compensation from ESTA when he chose to submit the article for publishing.


A July 2016 supply agreement filed in ESTA's original S-1 makes mention of a
"proprietary Sforza Bulb Side-Port Injector designed by" the Company. Could it be a
coincidence that ESTA "designed" a "proprietary" medical tool and happened to apply
the Sforza name to it? If he was involved, was Dr. Sforza paid for this work?


ESTA CEO Juan José Chacón-Quirós' Instagram account and the Facebook page of
ESTA is a treasure trove of proof that Dr. Sforza was deeply involved with ESTA
dating back into the Dolan Park Study's study period (April 2013 to April 2016) for
which he declared "no potential conflicts of interest."


Chacón-Quirós posted a photo on October 30, 2015 (during the study period) captioned
"Tehran loves Motiva!" showing himself (center) and Dr. Sforza (right) together at an
event in Iran. (Image removed.)


On December 2, 2015 (during the study period), Dr. Sforza gave a speech in Germany
promoting Motiva. A video of the speech posted to YouTube by former ESTA distributor
Menke Med GmbH ("Menke Med") includes Dr. Sforza saying that the Dolan Park
Clinic's former breast implant supplier was AGN who threatened him with "legal actions"
and "recently asked my hospital to fire me." These remarks occur around the 31-minute
mark.


Furthermore, according to ESTA's Facebook page, Dr. Sforza gave a "training course"
at a February 24, 2016 Motiva product launch in Almaty, Kazakhstan during the study
period.


Dr. Sforza spoke at a Motiva EDGE Symposium on March 10, 2016 (again during the
study period) in Uruguay according to the Company's Facebook page.


Pictured: Dr. Sforza (left) and CEO Chacón-Quirós (center) at the Uruguay symposium
on March 10, 2016:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000162828018009277/exhibit1010s-1a3.htm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2yFA-pVNys
It would be highly unusual if Dr. Sforza was not paid to travel as far and wide as
Uruguay, Iran and Kazakhstan to give "training courses" on the Motiva product all during
the study period. Why would this accomplished surgeon fly around the world promoting
a product without compensation or the promise of compensation? One surgeon we
spoke with said this level of engagement without compensation is "unthinkable" in the
industry.


In the aforementioned August 16, 2018, correspondence with the SEC, ESTA claims
they "did not commission the study and that it was an independent academic study
conducted and published by Dr. Sforza and his institution." This statement would appear
to be at odds with Dr. Sforza's extensive involvement with ESTA during the study period.
Furthermore, the study itself states "This article was supported by Establishment Labs
(Alajuela, Costa Rica), who co-funded the development of this supplement."


Today, Dr. Sforza serves as "coordinator of the Company's medical advisory board"
receiving $10,000 to $15,000 per month in cash compensation on top of the 36,953-
share option grant package received in September 2016 and a 68,233-share grant
provided in April 2018. The market value of these shares is ~$2.5 million.


The Dolan Park study clearly does not meet the smell test for "independence" and is
filled with conflicts. It appears ESTA may have provided misleading information to
the SEC and investors in its July 17, 2018 IPO and/or the Aesthetic Surgery
Journal about the nature of the "independent" study conducted by Dr. Sforza. If
this is the case, then ESTA could face legal and regulatory consequences.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000162828018008193/filename1.htm
Cannell Capital reached out to ESTA's designated investor relations professional on
April 3, 2019, to ask for a comment about the apparent conflicts in the Dolan Park study.
We have not received a substantive reply as April 9, 2019, the date of this article's
publication.


ESTA's ties with the Dolan Park Clinic go even deeper; we explore this further below.


(3) Prospective Trial in Costa Rica


ESTA's S-1 touts an ongoing study of patient safety being conducted in ESTA's own
Costa Rica.


"…a 10-year prospective trial for 233 patients in Costa Rica…interim results from the
current study include six-year data for 35 patients and three-year data for 79 patients,
and to date there have been no reported implant ruptures, capsular contractures or
adverse event-related reoperations in these patient cohorts." Source.

Deep Dolan Park Clinic Entanglements


This study is decidedly not independent as it is being conducted solely by the Company.
Moreover, the study is very small with fewer than 80 patients. ESTA's public filings
disclose that "Both of the surgeons who conducted this study are related to our
chief executive officer." This likely includes the CEO's brother who is also a member
of ESTA's medical board. Dr. Manuel Chacón-Quirós has received options from ESTA
and is paid "cash reimbursement of up to $4,500 per day as such services are
rendered." During the years ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, ESTA
paid Dr. Manuel Chacón-Quirós $90,000 and $120,000, respectively.


In our opinion ESTA's self-reported safety data, the Dolan Park study and the ongoing
Costa Rican study do not achieve even a basic level of academic rigor. We believe that
all three studies seem to lack true independence. Given regulatory scrutiny around
breast implants, the Company's safety certifications could be at risk once the
questionable nature of its studies becomes clear.


In addition to Dr. Sforza serving on ESTA's medical board and publishing a critical
"independent study", it appears that Dolan Park and the Company have a deeper
connection.


In ESTA's amended S-1 filed with the SEC on July 13, 2018, the Company includes an
exhibit showing its supply agreement with The Hospital Group, owner of the Dolan Park
Clinic. The supply agreement is dated February 7, 2014, coincidentally in the middle of
the study period for Dr. Sforza's Motiva article.


The terms of the supply agreement are surprisingly generous for ESTA [underlining
added below]:


Source: Exhibit 10.20 to ESTA Amended S-1 filed July 13, 2018



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000162828018009213/establishmentlabss-1a2.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000162828018008184/exhibit1020s-1.htm
According to these terms, ESTA can invoice Dolan Park upon shipment of implants as
opposed to upon implantation/use. The agreement later confirms that Dolan Park is to
"pay in full and in Pounds (GBP) each invoice issued by" the Company. We believe this
is irregular and suggestive of improper revenue recognition.


Furthermore, how is it that ESTA can modify any product at any time without Dolan
Park's consent and yet Dolan Park must purchase it? This seems dubious from a
medical and ethical perspective.


The agreement further requires Dolan to heavily promote Motiva products:


Source: Exhibit 10.20 to ESTA Amended S-1 filed July 13, 2018


The contractual obligation of Dolan Park to "promote the use of the products" further
calls into question the independence of Dr. Sforza's study.


Dolan also promises not to promote, sell or buy any products which may compete with
ESTA:


Source: The prices at which ESTA will sell implants to Dolan Park under the agreement
appear to be meaningfully below market value at an average of ~$150 per unit. The
supply agreement refers to these as "special prices."

By comparison, here is the price list attached to ESTA's agreement with German
distributor Menke Med showing an average cost of ~$625 per unit:


Source: Exhibit 2.3 to ESTA Amended S-1 filed July 13, 2018


The supply agreement also contained minimum purchase quantities. For the period of
March 2016 to March 2017, Dolan Park was required to buy 5,000 units from ESTA. If
we assume the average per unit price of ~$150, this equates to ~$0.8 million in
revenues or ~4% of the revenues the Company booked in 2016.


Source: Attachment to Exhibit 10.20 to ESTA Amended S-1 filed July 13, 2018


The original Dolan Park supply agreement lasted three years from March 1, 2014 to
March 1, 2017. The supply agreement states that "unless otherwise terminated by any
party giving the other six months' prior notice before any expiry, this Agreement will be
renewed for successive periods of three commercial years." ESTA's 10-K filed on March
20, 2019 confirms the Company continues to have a "long-term supply agreement" with
Dolan Park.

Aesthetic Healthcare LTD.


Dolan Park is clearly critical for ESTA. The clinic has given ESTA an "independent"
study, the head of its medical advisory board and demand for breast implants on flexible
terms. In exchange, it appears ESTA has given Dolan Park not only cut-rate implants
but (as we detail below) a system that likely benefits the clinic's owner.


ESTA requires in the Dolan Park agreement that obligations "shall be fulfilled by its local
distributor Aesthetic Healthcare Ltd."


Aesthetic Healthcare LTD appears to be registered in the Cayman Islands. A company
with a very similar name, Aesthetic Healthcare Consulting LTD, is also registered in the
Cayman Islands.


According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Offshore Leaks
Database, Stephen McNerlin is one of two shareholders in Aesthetic Healthcare
Consulting Ltd.


According to Linkedin, one Stephen McNerlin is purportedly located in the Cayman
Islands and describes himself as "retired at The Hospital Medical Group Ltd."
Coincidentally the same The Hospital Medical Group Ltd. owns the Dolan Park Clinic.


Source: LinkedIn


An April 26, 2009, article by The Times of London claimed that Stephen McNerlin was
the largest shareholder in The Hospital Medical Group with a 75% stake.

Questionable Asset Purchase Agreements


ESTA appears to have a "you wash my back I wash yours" relationship with Dolan Park.
ESTA gives generous compensation to Dolan Park employee Dr. Sforza and sells the
hospital implants at below-market rates. In return it appears Dolan Park agrees to highly
flexible contractual terms with ESTA, serves as a consistent customer of its products
and facilitated the generation of an "independent study."


ESTA has been an active acquirer of distributors which were formerly customers.
According to their most recent 10-K, ESTA:


In 2015, re-acquired distribution rights from Cyprus-based Novaform for cash and
stock.


In 2016, acquired distributors in Brazil, Belgium and France.


In 2017, ESTA acquired assets (likely inventory) from a distributor in Sweden
before establishing its own Swedish subsidiary.


In 2018, acquiring distributors in each of Spain, Germany and the UK.


The serial acquisition of distributors is a red flag. The acquisitions ESTA has detailed
publicly include the re-purchase of inventory previously sold by ESTA to the distributor
being acquired.


The pattern appears to be:


ESTA extends credit to a distributor


The distributor uses the credit to purchase ESTA implants allowing ESTA to book
revenue


ESTA acquires the distributor or just the inventory back from the distributor


This system would allow ESTA to "buy" revenue using its balance sheet. Obviously, this
is not sustainable.

An asset purchase agreement filed as an exhibit to ESTA's October 4, 2018 8-K stated
that the Spanish distributor being acquired owed ESTA ~€2 million (~$2.3 million) and
that "the assets purchased included all existing inventory previously sold by the
Company."


Per the 10-K ESTA ultimately paid $3.6 million including $1.8 million in cash to acquire
the Spanish distributor. In the purchase price accounting for the transaction, ESTA
ascribed $3.56 million of market value to the inventory.


We can treat the ascribed fair value as an estimate of the revenue ESTA would have
earned from selling the same inventory to the Spanish distributor historically. This
method likely understates revenue assuming the distributor did sell at least some
product to clinics. Revenue of $3.56 million represents ~6% of revenues realized by
ESTA in 2018 and 14% of revenue growth.


On October 3, 2018, ESTA entered into an asset purchase agreement with German
distributor Menke Med GmbH ("Menke Med"):


"The assets purchased included all existing inventory previously sold by the
Company to the Germany Seller and all customer relationships and contracts. The
aggregate purchase price for the assets purchased was the aggregate sum of book
value of the inventory at the time of the transaction plus a cash payment of up to a
maximum of one million nine hundred twenty thousand euros (€1,920,000)."


ESTA's 2018 10-K filed March 20, 2019, shows that the Company ascribed fair market
value of $2.1 million to the value of inventory acquired by the dealer. Using the ascribed
value, we can estimate ESTA derived at least $2.1 million in revenue from the German
distributor equal to ~3% of 2018 revenue or ~8% of revenue growth.


In the same 10K, the Company touted the German acquisition with CEO Chacón-Quirós
saying:


"Our distributor partners have given us strong starts in Germany and Spain, and by
acquiring these assets we will be able to capitalize on our early success to transition
to a direct sales force that should allow us to continue to expand our market
position."

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688757/000168875719000013/establishmentlabs10k_2018q4.htm
However, the German deal is unique in that it contains a "commercial agency
agreement" wherein ESTA will be making ongoing milestone-based payments to Menke
Med of €360,000 to €480,000 per year for hitting minimum sales targets.


The agreement says that Menke Med will be ESTA's "exclusive commercial agent in
Germany to promote, market and sell the Company's products" of its products and will
"assist in the execution of orders from customers in the territory." Does this sound like a
direct sale to you?


In the October 4, 2018, 8-K, ESTA includes the milestone payment minimum sales
Menke Med must achieve:


Source: Exhibit 2.3 to ESTA 8K filed October 4, 2018


Menke Med's 2019 minimum target is ~$3.1 million or ~4% of 2019 consensus
revenues. ESTA has structured this deal in such a way that bonus payments made to
Menke Med for hitting targets will not be considered commissions but acquisition-related
milestone payments.


ESTA's 2018 10-K discloses a small September 2018 acquisition of assets from Belle
Health LTD in the UK ascribing $235,000 in fair value to its inventory.


Taken in total, we estimate these three distributor asset acquisitions could have
accounted for ~$6 million in revenue equal to ~10% of 2018 total revenue and ~22% of
2018 revenue growth.

Other Related Parties & Balance Sheet Red Flags


Note that these are only the distributor acquisitions for which we have detailed
financial information. The Company has, by our count, conducted at least eight
asset transactions with distributors since 2015.


This financial chicanery makes it impossible to tell what ESTA's real organic growth is
and what demand, if any, exists for the Company's products. As the Menke Med deal
demonstrates, claims that this buying spree is driven by a desire to sell directly to
doctors is farcical. How many distributors is ESTA selling to today with a tacit agreement
for a future buy-out?


ESTA has two related party distribution agreements detailed in its 10-K which comprise
a total of ~$0.9 million revenue generated in 2018:


"During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded
revenue of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for product sales to
Herramientas Medicas, S.A., a distribution company owned by a family member
of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company." Source.


1.


"During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded
revenue of approximately $40,000 and $0.3 million for product sales to Motiva
Netherlands BV, a distribution company owned by Erick Vogelanzeng, our Vice
President of Sales, Europe." Source.


2.


These insider arrangements, while small, strike us as odd and a continuation of a
troubling pattern. Why would ESTA do this? How do these arrangements benefit ESTA
shareholders?


Beyond the related party transactions and distributor repurchase agreements, ESTA's
accounting has red flags in the form of elevated inventory levels, a suspiciously low
allowance for returns and material weakness in internal controls.


At December 31, 2018, ESTA carried $24.8 million of inventory, up 62% QoQ, imputing
an astronomical 343 days of inventory outstanding up from a still high 224 at September
30, 2018. Running at high levels of inventory can be reflective of a "stuffed channel" or a
company running higher levels of production than demand warrants to boost gross profit
margins.

Debt and Default:


Elevated inventories may relate to the Q4 2018 asset purchase agreements. They may
also be explained by the Company's use of consigned inventory wherein product sits on
the shelves of hospitals waiting to be implanted.


According to their most recent 10-K, ESTA holds only $52,000 in allowance for product
returns on $61 million in sales for the year (just 0.1% of revenue):


"As of December 31, 2018, an allowance of $52,000 was recorded for product
returns. Prior to 2018, returns of products have been de minimis and accordingly no
allowance for returns was recorded as of December 31, 2017."


This is an unusually low return rate especially if the Company is increasingly selling
directly. US competitor SIEN held an allowance for returns equal to $6 million or 9% of
2018 revenues. AGN held a $567 million returns and other allowances account at the
end of the year equivalent to ~4% of revenues. ESTA's return allowance is equal to
0.08% of 2018 revenues. Overly-aggressive return rate allowances may help a company
boost gross profits as the allowance is subtracted from gross sales.


The Company's Q3 10-Q disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting citing "lack of adequate review of the accounting for debt and standard-to
actual inventory costing" and a lack of "accounting and finance professionals with the
requisite expertise" at its Brazilian subsidiary. The Company's 2018 10-K says that
ESTA resolved the issues identified in Q3 2018 but had a new material weakness in
internal control relating to "lack of adequate review over the manual consolidation
process." The consolidation process likely refers to the compilation of financials across
ESTA's various subsidiaries.


On December 31, 2018, ESTA carried $22 million of debt. Total interest expense
incurred in 2018 was $8.8 million, implying an effective interest rate for the full year
of 40%. Per ESTA's most recent 10-K, total debt has not changed significantly since
December 30, 2017. In 2017, ESTA paid interest expense of $10.4 million.


A look at ESTA's credit history may explain why the Company pays so much interest.
ESTA defaulted on its credit agreement in June 2018, just one month before going
public, according to the Company's prospectus filed on July 20, 2018:

Management & Insiders


"..April 30, 2018, the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with the
Lenders, where the Lenders agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and
remedies through May 18, 2018 arising from certain disclosure and other
technical defaults under the Madryn Credit Agreement…"


"..on March 23, 2018 and subsequently on April 30, 2018, May 18, 2018 and again on
June 8, 2018, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the Lenders, where the
Lenders agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies through July
3, 2018 arising from certain disclosure and other technical defaults under the
Madryn Credit Agreement"


ESTA had $52.6 million in cash as of December 31, 2018. The Company's average free
cash flow burn through 2018 was ~$6 million per quarter, however ESTA has cited
elevated costs moving forward related to the FDA trial. We believe that given the
increased expenses ESTA will likely need to do an equity offering by the end of 2019.


Technical defaults and heavy cash burn may be why ESTA's auditor issued a going
concern clause in their S-1 IPO prospectus:


"Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern." [Emphasis in original.]
Source.


Apparently, ESTA CEO Juan José Chacón-Quirós does not like to go to the office.
According to his Instagram, since September 30, 2018, Juan José has been to South
Africa, Miami, London, France, California, New Mexico, Costa Rica, Japan, the
Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), New York, Hong Kong, Russia, Norway, Austria, Utah,
Italy, Cuba, Peru and Brazil. He posted a photo from Antarctica on November 23 and
another 17 days later on December 10, 2018. This works out to twenty exotic locales
over a 23-week period.

While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


According to her Linkedin and Facebook, ESTA's CFO Renee Gaeta is based in Santa
Barbara, CA, approximately 2,800 miles away from the Company's headquarters in
Alajuela, Costa Rica. This strikes us as unusual for a company that does not generate
any material revenue in the US and is another financial red flag.


Insiders own a significant amount of ESTA: Director Nicholas Lewin owns 37% of shares
through Crown Predator Holdings (CPH TU LP), and CEO Juan José Chacón-Quirós
owns 12% of shares outright and through Sariel LTD. Insiders came off lockup on
January 15, 2019 and were likely restricted from trading until the Company reported Q4
results on March 20, 2019. Given their outsized ownership stake, a decision by insiders
to sell could pressure the stock.


Sientra (SIEN) sells FDA-approved products while trading at a discount to ESTA. 2019
estimated growth rates are comparable:


Ticker EV/2018 Revenue EV/2019E Revenue 2019 Est Growth Rate


SIEN 2.7 2.2 22%


ESTA 7.7 6.1 26%

ESTA trades at a large premium to precedent industry buyout multiples as well. JNJ paid
$1.1 billion for Mentor in December 2008 at a multiple of just three times trailing sales.


Given ESTA's accounting red flags, lack of scale, cash burn and questionable safety
studies, we argue it should trade at a discount to industry peers.


If we back out $6 million from purchased distributors and $2 million from Dolan Park
from 2018 revenue of $61 million and apply a 2x EV/ Revenue multiple, we obtain a
$136 million implied market capitalization or ~$6.68 per share price target, a (72%)
decline from current levels.
