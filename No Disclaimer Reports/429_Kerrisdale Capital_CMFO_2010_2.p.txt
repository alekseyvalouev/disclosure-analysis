CMFO and
Xianghe: A
Dubious
Acquisition
Jun. 4, 2010 8:49 AM ET17 comments | Includes: China Ma…


This article discusses a questionable acquisition that China Marine Food made
in January 2010 that was used to justify a $30mm equity capital raise.


As I wrote in my last post, the financial statements that CMFO files with the
SEC are substantially different from the audited financial statements that it
files with the Chinese government. Whereas companies like YUII, FUQI and
SOLF have matching financials when comparing US and Chinese audited
financial statements, CMFO’s revenue in its Chinese filings for 2008 were 85%
lower than in its SEC filings. Other financial line items were smaller by similar
orders of magnitude.


The company is falsifying one set of financial statements – that’s an obvious
fact. The question facing investors is whether CMFO is falsifying the SAIC
financials that they file to seven branches of their own government, or whether
they’re falsifying the SEC financials that they used to raise $30mm of cash
from U.S. investors in January 2010.


In this article, I explain why an acquisition that the company made in January
2010 provides strong evidence that CMFO is engaged in fraudulent activities.
Specifically, I believe that the company which CMFO acquired is fraudulent
itself. 
 


A Questionable Acquisition


In January, CMFO raised equity capital partly to fund an acquisition of Shishi
Xianghe Food Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (“Xianghe”). Xianghe is a
manufacturer of algae-based soft drinks. The purchase price was $27.8mm.

Here is the description of Xianghe’s product:


“Xianghe is a Fujian based manufacturer of the branded Hi-Power algae-based
soft drinks. Hi-Power was developed by the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research
Institute Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences in coordination with the
founder, Qiu Shang Jing. Hi-Power is marketed as a high-protein content
drink, low in calories and fat, which provides the consumers a combination of
immune system benefits, improved digestion and reductions in hyperglycemia
and hypertension. Hi-Power’s target market focuses on health conscious
consumers in China’s fast-growing beverage market.”


Here is a link to an informative 8k dated March 16, 2010 about the Xianghe
acquisition. Most of the following discussion is disclosed in this 8K. In this link,
we discuss specifically where in the 8K we get supporting material for the
statements we make below.


From the 8k, we learn that Xianghe’s product actually originated in January
2009, when Qiu Shang Jing paid Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute
(YSFRI) $8,776 for “know-how” regarding the development of an algae-based
drink. To repeat, Xianghe basically began 1.5 years ago, when Mr. Qiu
purchased “know-how” on how to make a certain algae-based drink for eight
thousand seven hundred and seventy six dollars.


In April 2009, Mr. Qiu leased office space from CMFO (CMFO waived the rent
beginning in July) to set up his new algae-drink company. On July 28, 2009,
Mr. Qiu incorporated Xianghe as a legal entity with $43,979 (that’s forty three
thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine dollars). On October 2009, Mr. Qiu
contributed an additional $689,504 for a total registered capital of $733,483.


Xianghe was then purchased by CMFO for $27.8mm in November 2009,
through a 2-step acquisition that was completed in January 2010.


I’ll repeat the key points. Xianghe began when Mr. Qiu bought “know-how”
regarding how to make an algae-based beverage for ~$9k in January 2009.
Over the following 9 months, Mr. Qiu contributed an additional ~$733k (with
90% of that in October, one month before the acquisition).


In November, CMFO purchased 80% of Xianghe for $27.8mm.


Based on my calculations, Mr. Qiu achieved a 139,160% annualized return on
his investment in the algae drink.

5/23/2018 CMFO and Xianghe: A Dubious Acquisition - Chinese Company Analyst | Seeking Alpha

For the avoidance of doubt, here is a graphic representation of what
happened:


 
 
I find it extremely implausible that a company essentially begun in January
2009 and that received less than $750k of capital in its first 11 months of
operation (with 90% of that in the 10th month) would be worth $28mm at the
end of the 11th month, unless it had a truly unique patent or technology.
Xianghe is a maker of an algae-based beverage. I doubt that this qualifies as a
sufficiently unique product that’s worth $28mm purely because of the inherent
attractiveness of the product.


Equally absurd is the fact that the “know-how” which Mr. Qiu purchased for
$9k is now valued on CMFO’s balance sheet at $23.5mm.


Incidentally, Li Xiaochuan is “the researcher” of YSFRI and also an independent
director of CMFO.


More Dubious Financial Statements

Xianghe was begun when “know-how” was purchased in January 2009 for $9k.
The company wasn’t actually incorporated until July 28, 2009.


So one would think that Xianghe would have negligible revenue and profit in
its first 5 months of operations, correct?


Not according to Xianghe’s financial statements. Keep in mind that Xianghe
was audited by CMFO’s same poorly qualified auditor: ZYCPA Company Ltd.
ZYCPA, according to its website, has 2 partners and 25 personnel. It received
its PCAOB designation in December 2008.


Between July 28, 2009 and December 31, 2009, Xianghe claims to have
generated $7.6mm in revenue, $3.0mm in gross profit, $1.7mm of net profit
and $1.2mm of cash flow of operations.


With approximately $742k of equity capital (comprised of $9k for know-how in
January 2009, $44k of cash contribution on July 28, 2009 and $689k of cash
contribution on October 8, 2009), Xianghe was somehow able to generate
$7.6mm of revenue and $1.2mm of cash flow from operations in its first 5
months of operations, from selling an algae-based beverage.


Again, I'll demonstrate my points with a graphical representation:
