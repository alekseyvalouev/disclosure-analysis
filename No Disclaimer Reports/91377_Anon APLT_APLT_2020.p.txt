When one is one’s own worst enemy
In what turned out to be a colossal unforced error, 
certain Austrian soldiers in the field of battle attacked 
their fellow men believing them to be the enemy (well 
before the enemy had even arrived). 
Bad decision making snowballed the issue, and mistake 
after communication mistake in reacting to the available 
data led to a resounding defeat when the enemy (the 
Ottomans) eventually showed up 2 days later.


Whenever I mentioned this story to my 
grandfather, he’d simply say “foitrottl!”


Speaking of unforced errors and mistakes and general chaos around data…


3PS: IF YOU KNOW THE MULTIPLE EXISTING ISSUES WITH APLT ALREADY, JUMP TO SLIDE 8…
NOT our words, these are excerpts from notes from the analysts that cover 
APLT!! Pretty much every time this company presents data or updates deck…

“Confusing”. “Sloppiness in data presentations”. “concerns 
about QA/QC of a regulatory submission”. 


“unforced errors”. “QC issues”


“was supposed to be fixed?”. “far from pristine”


“restated figures”. “updated baseline levels”


THIS IS WHAT “CONFUSION” AND “SLOPPINESS” LOOK LIKE

Experienced biotech investors- what do you typically 
think when you see a small cap biotech having to 
RESTATE and CORRECT CLINICAL data multiple
times, especially a dataset this small (n<20)?


More importantly, what will the FDA think?


5
From 4/22 
to 7/9


How did we go from an innocent “update” to “another 
slide deck?”??


Citations: UBS, “Applied Therapeutics Inc., Update to ACTION-Galactosemia presentation,” dated 
4/22/20;  UBS, “Applied Therapeutics Inc., Another slide deck? Clarity but also some Qs,” dated 7/9/20.
From “stands behind its data” to “corrected changes”, 
“updated”, “initially calculated incorrectly”…


From 7/3 to 
7/19

Fraudulent “Short Report”” dated 7/3/20; Barclays, “Applied Therapeutics, Inc., Galactosemia

Wait… were you under the 
impression that these 


“mistakes” have really been 
“fixed”?


8
As of July 21, 2020… NO, they have not. 
• IN FACT, UPON CRITICAL ANALYSIS, THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN 


ANSWERS


• THE LOGICAL QUESTION IS, IS THERE SOMETHING SYSTEMICALLY WRONG WITH 
THIS DATASET?


• We urge investors to ask these questions and to use them as a launchpad to 
debate why this company has, to date, not been able to assemble a single, 
coherent, unblemished investor deck without “mistakes” 


• To question, at a minimum, how shareholders can have faith in their ability to 
comprehend the FDA’s demands which are generally orders more complex, and at 
the very least, involve presenting a much more comprehensive dataset to the 
agency. An agency which by the way, is cramped for time and handing out 
standard review and CRLs to even Breakthrough Therapy Designated drugs (see 
ACAD 7/20, HRTX ICPT 6/29)

The company claimed (according to their sellside notes) that 
the baseline was corrected to measure the mean of levels on 
day -1 and day 1. Problem is, they said that on 4/22 
AND THEN AGAIN on 7/19 to justify the “correction”. 
Even accounting for the pbo patient who “wasn’t QCed”(UBS 
note, not an 8k) (!!), it doesn’t explain why the changes in 
baseline for the treatment group had to be RE-CORRECTED!!


7/19/20


4/22/20


QUESTION 1- OK, YOU CORRECTED + RE-CORRECTED BASELINE. 
BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDN’T CORRECT THE REST??!
QUESTION 1- OK, YOU CORRECTED + RE-CORRECTED BASELINE. 
BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDN’T CORRECT THE REST??


SO THE STARTING POINT HAS CHANGED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT


By the way, same values for 2 cohorts?!! (Yes, we know they 
“fixed” these. But wait till you see what’s on the next slide)


4/28/20


7/18/20


So 20mg/kg COHORT baseline (we’re focusing on this dose since it has shown the “best” data in totality of plasma and urine galactitol reduction) shifted by ~100 
ng/mL, and individual baselines shifted as well


BUT……

QUESTION 1- OK, YOU CORRECTED + RE-CORRECTED 
BASELINE. BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDN’T CORRECT THE REST??


BUT…… THE ABSOLUTE GALACTITOL REDUCTIONS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
FOR 5mg/kg and 20 mg/kg TREATMENT GROUPS… SO… 
(pbo changes because of addition of 2 more patients along with 40mg/kg cohort)

QUESTION 1- OK, YOU CORRECTED + RE-CORRECTED BASELINE. 
BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDN’T CORRECT THE REST??


SO HOW CAN THE PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS BE THE SAME????
One more time, baseline changed, cohort reduction for 5 and 20mg/kg stay the same, YET THE PERCENTAGE 
REDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS REMAINS EXACTLY THE SAME! MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!! 
PLEASE EXPLAIN??! Surely it isn’t the day 32 to day 32-34 change (why was this done?). Read on…

QUESTION 2- HOW CAN YOU CLAIM GALACTITOL LEVELS ARE 
CONSISTENT??


“So really comprehensive understanding of what these patients 
look like in terms of clinical presentation of disease, what their 
issues are, how those worsen over time, as well as biochemical 
analysis of galactitol levels, potential variability between patients 
and galactitol and galactose levels. It turns out and this is 
something that we had discussed in our top line data. Levels of 
galactose and galactitol in these patients are actually very 
consistent over time and across the population”
– Shendelman, CEO 3/11/20


So, we learned quite a bit and it's actually very encouraging that on patient
levels of galactitol are very stable and consistent at baseline. And so when 
we looked at screening versus baseline levels of these patients in numbers 
are very close.” 
– Shendelman, CEO 1/8/20


PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAN BE TERMED CONSISTENT?? 
HOW CAN CHANGES APPROACHING YOUR BEST DOSE’S 
TREATMENT EFFECT BE DEEMED CONSISTENT?? 
THIS ALSO REMOVES ANY DOUBT FROM THE PREVIOUS SLIDE THAT 
CHANGING THE TIMEPOINT TO DAY 32-34 VS. DAY 32 MAGICALLY 
RESULTED IN EXACTLY THE SAME VALUES
QUESTION 3- IF THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT, WHY 
HAVEN’T YOU SHOWN INDIVIDUAL PBO CURVES?


If you believe in your drug’s treatment effect, wouldn’t showing individual patient curves 
only go further to fortify the strength of your data? We have seen that galactitol can vary 
significantly from day to day based on your own baseline data, so why not show investors 
the true placebo adjusted effect? 


WHY NOT SHOW INDIVIDUAL PLACEBO CURVES WHEN WE KNOW YOU HAVE THAT DATA?
Citations: Applied Therapeutics, Galactosemia Foundation presentation dated 7/18/20.
QUESTION 4- ON THAT NOTE PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR 
COMMENTARY FROM JANUARY AROUND PBO ADJUSTED EFFECT?


• From your topline PR (below), please explain how the plasma galactitol reduction is 45-
54% FROM BASELINE VERSUS PLACEBO? By generally accepted biotech verbiage, That 
implies a placebo ADJUSTED number. Why did the PR not simply say “from baseline”?


• From the previous few slides, it appears the placebo effect is indeed non-insignificant. 
After all the 5mg/kg is approximately the same as placebo. Again, why not show the 
individual placebo curves?


APLT announced an offering with gross proceeds ~$143.4MM a few days after this PR
Citations: Applied Therapeutics Press Release, “Applied Therapeutics Announces Positive Topline Results of Pivotal Phase 2 ACTION-Galactosemia Study of 
AT-007 in Galactosemia Patients” dated 1/8/20. Annotations added.
• For reference, here is a press release and presentation excerpt from 
Myokardia, which announced positive Phase 3 results. Note the use of the 
word “VERSUS”.


QUESTION 4- ON THAT NOTE PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR 
COMMENTARY FROM JANUARY AROUND PBO ADJUSTED EFFECT?


WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TRUE PLACEBO-ADJUSTED REDUCTION FOR AT-007? WHY MUST 
INVESTORS HAVE TO CALCULATE THEMSELVES USING ASSUMPTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE THE DATA IN HAND?


Citations: Myokardia, “EXPLORER-HCM Topline Supplemental Materials vF” presentation, dated 5/11/20.
From the time curves, it is apparent that the 20mg/kg patients on average (MAKING A BIG ASSUMPTION THAT 
THE BASELINE IS CORRECTLY GRAPHED!!) start at 2500 ng/mL and at day 32 start the day at between 1800-
1900 ng/mL. Even the most generous assumption only implies a ~30% effect. And then you have to adjust for 
placebo…


QUESTION 5- WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF MAX REDUCTION ?


IS THIS CALCULATION FOR THE PLACEBO ADJUSTED REDUCTION IN THE RIGHT BALLPARK? WHY DO YOU NOT 
TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IT’S MEANINGFUL? IS THE FDA OK WITH THE PBO-ADJUSTED NUMBER?


Citations: Applied Therapeutics, Galactosemia Foundation presentation dated 7/18/20.
QUESTION 5b- WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF MAX REDUCTION ?
According to sellside we were supposed to have seen the mean reduction in plasma galactitol. Isn’t 
this a figure APLT should have handy? Why have we still not seen it after multiple iterations of 
presentations?


DOES THE FDA NOT CARE ABOUT MEAN PLACEBO ADJUSTED REDUCTION? 


Citations: UBS, “Applied Therapeutics, Inc. “Short Report” – walking through the issues,” dated 7/6/20.


Again, given the INTRADAY 
VARIABILITY (CLEARLY EVIDENT 
IN APLT’S OWN GRAPHS) ISN’T 
THE MEAN REDUCTION THAT 
MUCH MORE RELEVANT?
5 mg/kg dose on average has similar max galactitol reduction as pbo as a cohort, but the 
respective error bars are SO different- tiny for 5mg/kg, WIDE for placebo


QUESTION 6- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR ASSAY?


PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR ASSAY? HOW CAN THESE DATA BE 
ACCURATE GIVEN THESE ERROR BARS? WE ARE HAVING SEASONED 
BIOSTATISTICANS GO THROUGH THE “DATA” TO TRY AND ANSWER THIS OURSELVES


AND SPEAKING OF WRONG ASSAYS…
Citations: Applied Therapeutics, Galactosemia Foundation presentation dated 7/18/20.
QUESTION 7- YOUR MOST IMPORTANT BIOMARKER IS URINE 
GALACTITOL SO WHY IS IT ALL OVER THE PLACE??


IS THIS PERCENT CHANGE OR ABSOLUTE CHANGE?? THE CHART TITLE IMPLIES ONE THING, THE Y AXIS IS SOMETHING ELSE 
ENTIRELY. WHY IS THIS DATA STILL PRELIMINARY?? WHAT IS GOING ON WITH PLACEBO ERROR BARS? DOES 
IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR ASSAY? WHY DOES 40MG/KG LOOK SO BAD?

Is Plasma Enough? Galactosemia KOL Weighs In


Citations: UBS call with Eva Morava-Kozicz (MD, PhD) on May, 15 2020. Dr. Morava-Kozicz presented for Applied Therapeutics at Galactosemia Educational 
Symposium April 28, 2020; Applied Therapeutics, “Galactosemia Educational Symposium” deck, dated 4/28/20.


Dr. Eva Morava-Kozicz
Q: “… Would you consider a 40% reduction in 
galactitol (plasma), still clinically 
meaningful?..” 
A: “… Now you are asking me hard question 
again because I am used to monitoring 
urine excretion of galactitol so I do not 
know, I cannot translate that right away …. 
Probably 50% reduction or 40% reduction has 
therapeutic effect … But it is hard to say 
without measuring it in different tissues, 
right?...”


APLT’s own KOL relies on urine 
measurements and doubts the reliability 
of using a single method such as plasma.


QUESTION 7- YOUR MOST IMPORTANT BIOMARKER IS URINE GALACTITOL 
SO WHY IS IT ALL OVER THE PLACE??
Dr. Eva Morava-Kozicz (MD, PhD)
“…We are not measuring galactitol in clinical practice in other tissues. So, my experience in patients is urine. I cannot 
translate it to brain levels ... because this is not what we are doing in clinical practice…”
“… If I can reduce urine galactitol to the half of it I am already proud of myself that I am doing a good treatment 
strategy…”


In a recent presentation at the UBS conference (May 18, 2020), the CEO clearly stated that levels in 
blood and urine do correlate. So why does the previous slide not back this up at all?
“… Urine levels is what previously was done in the field… this is what happened more often in the 
literature and so we felt that it would be important to measure that in our clinical study. It’s much 
more accurate to look at galactitol levels in the blood but we did not know that before we did the 
experiments and saw that this was the case. We did look at galactitol levels in blood and in urine. 
Levels of galactitol both in blood and in urine do correlate, it’s just little bit technically more difficult 
to look in urine… it’s more annoying than taking the blood sample, so we did it, we thought it would 
be important to have it … they do correlate.. but I think from this moment on we should focus on 
galactitol in the blood because we saw that the accuracy was just so much greater...”


- Shendelman, CEO 5/18/20

“So, you are correct that we measured galactitol not only in the blood, which is what 
we released in January. But we also are able to look at galactitol levels in the brain by 
MR spectroscopy and so we took -- we did MR spectroscopy at baseline and end of 
treatment on all of our patients and that's underway, that will be released in our 
April presentation. We also from the safety perspective had done EKGs at baseline 
in this treatment. We didn't know there would be an EKG abnormality, but we did 
collect that data. So that's also under evaluation at baseline and end of treatment.”


- Shendelman, CEO 3/3/20


QUESTION 8- WE FINALLY GOT URINE DATA THAT YOU CAVEATED AS 
“EXPLORATORY”. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE BRAIN DATA?


According to sellside AND management commentary we were supposed to have seen 
the brain, EKG, and potentially even the seizure frequency data by SIMD in April
QUESTION 8- WE FINALLY GOT URINE DATA THAT YOU CAVEATED AS 
“EXPLORATORY”. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE BRAIN DATA?


THIS SHOULD BE A LAYUP- IS THIS LABELED CORRECTLY? OR 
IS IT ANOTHER “MISTAKE”? IS THIS A SIGN OF THINGS TO 
COME WHEN (IF) WE DO GET THE BRAIN DATA?


BY THE WAY, THE FDA GUIDANCE SPECIFIES EFFECT “IN 
THE TISSUE OF INTEREST”. WHY DOES APLT ITSELF 
HIGHLIGHT THE CNS MANIFESTATIONS AND THEN NOT 
SHOW THE BRAIN DATA? ARE WE TO SERIOUSLY BELIEVE 
THE FDA DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ITS OWN GUIDANCE?

Yet another instance of impossibly identical placebo curves. However, if this was an “innocent mistake,” why was 
this data deleted rather than corrected? This question has been left unanswered for nearly 3 months. 


. . . Not to mention the missing Gal-1p 
data, which had no obvious errors (at 
least that we know of). Why not 
present data that is clearly relevant to 
investors?


QUESTION 8b- WE FINALLY GOT URINE DATA THAT YOU CAVEATED AS 
“EXPLORATORY”. WHY DID YOU DELETE THE GALACTOSE AND GAL-1-P DATA 
FROM YOUR DECK?
The Company USED TO consistently guide to submit an NDA for AT-007 in 2H20:

QUESTION 9- WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED DURING YOUR MEETING WITH 
THE FDA THAT LED TO THE CHANGES IN YOUR FILING TIMELINE AND PED 
TRIAL DESIGN?
May Presentation – timing of NDA submission slips to “~YE 2020.”


This change seems innocent enough, until you find out that The Company met with the FDA just days 
earlier.

Topline Results Call (1/8/20)


“Given the magnitude of the effect and the definitive 
NIS we're in a really great place. And I also just want 
to highlight that in our animal model as disease, a 
50% reduction in galactitol produced a meaningful 
impact on clinical outcomes. So that's really what we 
were targeting and it's 50% reduction. So with this 
data, we can immediately file for approval 
and importantly begin our pediatric study”


– Shoshana Shendelman, CEO


Cowen conf. (3/3/20)


“And so, we've had a really ongoing dialogue with the 
FDA about this biomarker based guidance that we're 
using. We've had a very constructive dialogue with 
them all along. And so we do believe we're in a very 
strong position. We're adding some additional 
data in. So, we have a long-term extension study 
that's ongoing. I think that will be very helpful 
supportive data, that we'd like to include and we'd 
also like to do our pediatric study prior to the 
submission if at all possible and we think that will be 
possible.”

that looks like, we're in a really great place in terms of design”

If the FDA walked The Company through the design of the Pediatric study in January, then why did it 
require last minute changes to the protocol in MAY??

SUMMARY AND CLOSING THOUGHTS


• As others before us have noted, data from this company have been riddled with errors and 
detached, unexplainable conclusions that fall apart once one opens up the hood. 


• We review the latest data (Galactosemia Foundation, July 17-19, 2020) that sellsiders are 
clamoring to call “fixed” and “finally corrected” and “overhang removed” and find that far from being 
pristine, the data call into question almost every single aspect of consequence, and question what is 
going on behind the scenes as far as QA/QC is concerned, particularly with a promised NDA 
submission deadline approaching. [Note the company has already publicly admitted to a sellsider, 
though not in 8Ks as would be appropriate, of at least one major instance of QC failure]


• We provide herein a framework for investors to better critically evaluate the prospects of this 
company by highlighting the clear issues and shortfalls that have simply not been stamped out 
despite multiple attempts to “correct” the data. We urge the company to provide fulsome responses 
for what we believe are standard biotech investor questions if they believe in their drug and its 
therapeutic effect.


• Net-net, all stakeholders will be better off separating the signal from this self-inflicted noise rather 
than go the route of the Austrian army that failed to remove itself from several snowballing unforced 
errors much like the current setup in this name. Above all, avoid looking like a Foitrottl! 


• We look forward to this company’s next data release.
