Concentrated, hedged value investing


Public comment on Cologuard pricing 
This entry was posted in All Ideas  and tagged advocacy EXAS public comment short positions  on October 28, 2014.


Disclosure: Short EXAS.


The preliminary reimbursement for Cologuard is not cost effective. Read my
comment letter.


Cable Car submitted a public comment letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) regarding the preliminary payment amount for code G0464 on the 2015 Clinical Lab Fee
Schedule (CLFS). The preliminary determination proposed to reimburse stool-based DNA screening
for colorectal cancer (CRC) at an amount much higher than the level at which CMS‚Äô own research has
indicated the test would be cost effective. Cable Car recommended that CMS use a gapfill approach or
an alternative crosswalk to better reflect the economics of CRC screening.


CMS does not publish comments from the CLFS public meeting process, so Cable Car is making
the comment letter available here. Interested parties can submit comments to Glenn McGuirk until
November 8.


Please note that the letter reflects my research on the pharmacoeconomics of CRC screening and
good faith belief that a lower payment rate would be in the public interest. My short position in Exact
Sciences is not intended as criticism of the company, its management, or its investors. I support efforts
to develop new screening strategies for CRC, but believe taxpayers and the healthcare system would
benefit from a lower payment rate. If EXAS were to offer lower pricing, it could even lead to wider
adoption and better population health outcomes. Please be sure to read the disclaimer on this and
every page regarding securities discussed on the blog.
