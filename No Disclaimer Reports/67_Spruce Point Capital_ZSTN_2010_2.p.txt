ZST Digital Networks' Q3 Raises More Questions Than Answers
Dec. 2, 2010 6:23 PM ET10 comments
by: Ben Axler


Last month ZST Digital Networks (NASDAQ:ZSTN) reported its Q3 results. Yet again, the
company reported glowing results, indicating that total revenue for the period was $38.5
million, an increase of 34.6% compared to Q3 ’09, and net income grew to $6.4 million, an
increase of 94.7% compared to Q3 ’09.


As discussed in our previous analysis of ZSTN, we prefer to look at the balance sheet and
cash flow statement to assess the real quality of this business. After a closer examination
of this quarter’s results, we continue to have concerns and a cautionary stance on this
company’s operations.


The Curious Case of Quarterly Cash Flow


According to CFO John Chen:


“We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash
equivalents increasing significantly over the previous quarter as a result of an
influx of collections from products and services delivered earlier in the year, in
line with our normal cash collection cycle.”


Upon closer examination of this statement, we find some inconsistencies that beg further
investigation. To illustrate, as of Sept. 30, 2010, total accounts receivables were $27.5
million, a very modest decrease of only 4.9% from $28.9 million as of June 30, 2010.
However, accounts receivable are still higher by $2.6 million or 10% from the beginning of
the year.


So how did cash increase significantly as the company has indicated? To answer this
question precisely, we have to take a closer look into the cash generated from operations,
which entails looking into changes in the working capital accounts (current assets, and
liabilities).

The Curious Case of Advances to Suppliers


We will focus our attention on the items shaded in gray as areas of interest. As can be
seen from the table, the company’s largest source of cash this year has been from a
sudden reversal last quarter in the account called “Advances to Suppliers.” So what
exactly is this line item? According to the company’s recently filed 10Q in Note 4:


“In accordance with the purchase contracts, ZST PRC is required to make
advance payments to its suppliers to purchase the IPTV and GPS devices,
materials and add-on process work. The advances are applied to the total
invoice balance upon satisfaction of the goods received by ZST PRC. For the
year ended December 31, 2009, advances of $7,399,141 represents advances
mainly made to two suppliers accounting for 55% and 45%, respectively. As of
September 30, 2010, there were no prepayments made to suppliers due to the
Chinese National Holiday. Prepayments were made after the holiday ended on
October 7, 2010.”


Other disclosures in the company’s 10-K include the following language:


“We typically need to place certain deposits and advances with our suppliers
on a portion of the purchase price in advance and for some suppliers we must
maintain a deposit for future orders.”


Given the magnitude of this advance and sudden reversal this quarter, we would have
expected a more detailed discussion from the company about this change. After all, this
one account change represents almost 35% of the cash from operations for the entire
year. Unfortunately, due to lack of disclosure by the company on this issue, we are left

with more questions than answers. If, as described, the advances are to be applied to
invoices when goods are received, then why is the company receiving the money back?
Does this reversal indicate problems and/or troubles with its two main suppliers? Has the
company lost major customers, and no longer needing to receive supplies for future
orders, and thus receiving its advances/deposits back? Also, why does the reported YTD
cash inflow of $7,249,152 differ from our calculated amount of $7,399,141? It’s easy
enough to verify by looking at the 12/31/09 Advances to Supplier account. It appears to be
sloppiness on the part of the company, which can’t even get its own numbers correct,
across almost all reported amounts. This casts further doubt on the reliability of this
company’s financials.

The Curious Case of ZSTN’s Magically Shrinking Inventory


Perhaps the answer to the foregoing discussion of the Advances to Suppliers account is
better understood by looking at inventories. ZSTN’s inventories continue to fall at an
alarming rate. Yet again, they’ve decreased from $502k last quarter, to a mere $202k this
quarter. If we are correct that the company is having problems with its suppliers, then it
would make sense that it cannot build new inventories. After all, a company growing as
fast as ZSTN surely must build some inventories to sustain all of its superior growth in
sales and earnings that it is reporting to investors. However, ZSTN grew revenues by $5m
from $33m in 2Q’10 to $38m in 3Q’10, while inventories fell by $300k. At this rate, ZSTN
will deplete all inventories and be the only distributor in the world that we are aware of to
grow sales without holding a single dollar of inventory.


According to the company’s 10-K Risk Factors

“Cancellations or reductions of customer orders could result in the loss of
anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and
operating expenses. Furthermore, because we depend on a small number of
customers for the vast majority of our sales, the magnitude of the ramifications
of these risks is greater than if our sales were less concentrated with a small
number of customers. As a result of our lack of long-term purchase orders and
purchase commitments we may experience a rapid decline in our sales and
profitability.”


ZSTN’s decision to wind down and not restock its inventories may signal its expectation of
losses of customers. We are very wary of the trend of declining inventories, and think it’s a
potential indication of problems the company is either currently facing or expects to face in
the near future.


The Curious Case of ZSTN’s Accounts Payable


Our interest also was piqued when ZSTN reported this quarter that its accounts payable
balance was a mere $2,650. Curiously, this is the exact same amount the company
reported the prior quarter at 6/30/10. In other words, ZSTN did not incur a single dollar of
incremental amounts payable in three months of operations, all while reporting growing
sales and earnings. How is this possible? We don’t have an answer to this question, but
we certainly welcome an explanation from the company.


The Curious Case of ZSTN’s $1 Million Share Repurchase Program


Another curious matter is the company’s announcement on Aug. 24, 2010, of an initiation
of a $1 million share repurchase program.


In a press release, the chairman was quoted as saying:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/239814-zst-digital-networks-q3-raises-more-questions-than-answers 5/9


"The Board's authorization of the share repurchase program reflects our
confidence in the favorable growth outlook for ZST. As we enter the second
half of 2010, the demand for our products and services remains robust,
supported by the continued expansion of our end markets. In addition, our
strong second quarter 2010 results and the rapid development of our
commercial GPS products give us confidence in the long-term growth
prospects of our business. As such, we believe that current share price levels
do not fully reflect the fundamental strength of our business and outlook. We
remain committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value, and believe that
our stable financial position and healthy balance sheet will allow us to execute
a share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business.”


On the day of this announcement, ZSTN’s share price closed at $6.26 per share, not far
from its 52-week low of $4.43 per share. Given the foregoing announcement that ZSTN
believed its share price was cheap, investors would naturally believe the company would
be actively buying it at the current price. However, as we recently learned this quarter, the
company’s actions speak louder than its words. According to the company's quarterly
statement of cash flows, we find no indication of any share repurchases in the past nine
months, which are typically contained in the cash flows from financing section of the
statement. While we acknowledge that the announcement of share repurchase program
does not legally bind the company to take action, we are clearly disappointed ZSTN could
not commit to buying 1 single share at prices it acknowledged didn’t accurately reflect their
value.

Conclusion: Still More Questions Than Answers


We have illustrated more than a few unusual developments with ZSTN’s quarterly report
that exacerbates our concerns with the company’s financials and business prospects. We
continue to have grave concerns with the company’s balance sheet and cash flow
changes that could signal big problems in the quarters to come. Unfortunately, the
company does not disclose enough information to investors to accurately assess these
impacts on its future prospects. As a result, we stand by our previous conclusions that
ZSTN’s business remains deceptive and not an investment worth making.


Disclosure: Short ZSTN.
