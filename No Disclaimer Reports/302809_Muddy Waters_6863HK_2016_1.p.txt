started in the middle of 2014 and limited operations began in March 2015.  Onsite staff explained 
that the farm is just engaged in raising calves and had about 2,000 head. The farm is not doing 
any milking because the facilities were incomplete and the equipment had not been installed. 
They expected the farm to begin supplying milk in 2017.

Huishan Chairman Appears to Have Stolen Assets Worth at Least RMB 150 Million 
Through an Undisclosed Related Party Transaction 


 
Through an undisclosed related party transaction, we estimate Huishan Chairman Yang Kai stole 
at least RMB 150 million of assets.  In December 2014 (over one year post-IPO), Huishan 
transferred a subsidiary with at least four cattle farms to a party who is almost certainly a proxy 
for Chairman Yang.  We estimate these farms were worth RMB 150 million, which we based on 
interviews of Muhejia employees and analysis of publicly available documents.  The value of the 
farms was probably higher than our estimate because they likely contained cattle.  
 
We believe Chairman Yang intended to use shareholder funds to pay for construction of beef 
ranches that he would transfer to himself.  Starting in 2011, China’s beef prices rose faster than 
that of milk.  In early 2014, beef prices remained on the ascent even as milk prices collapsed.39 
Demand for Chinese beef peaked as production fell short of demand.40  For an owner of large-
scale dairy farm with calves and heifers to spare, this was certainly great news and a good 
opportunity.  We learned from interviews this fall with employees of Muhejia, a cattle ranching 
company owned by the Chairman Yang Kai, that since at least 2013 a plan had been in place for 
the company to move into the slaughtering and beef sales and distribution business.41

Chairman Yang and his wife own Liaoning Muhejia Livestock and Technology Co. Ltd. 
(“Muhejia”).42  As explained next, Muhejia used a proxy to take at least four farms from 
Huishan.  Muhejia has had five names in two years, which we believe is an attempt to conceal 
this (and possibly other) improper transaction.  This table shows the strangely frequent re-
naming of Muhejia:

Huishan’s disclosures about Liaoning Muhejia refer to it by an informal English name, Liaoning 
Ainyveal, which we also believe is an attempt to obscure.43    
 
F.U. with FuYu 
 
Huishan transferred the Fuyu farms to Muhejia, an entity controlled by Yang Kai. The following 
timeline lays out the key events: 
 


• April 11, 2014: Huishan establishes Huishan Investment Fuyu Shenyang Farming 
Company (“Fuyu”) for “dairy farming business”.44  (As we explain below, it seems likely 


                                                
43 Huishan Group, however, disclosed a business agreement with Liaoning Ainyveal as a connected party transaction 
with Chairman Yang Kai in September 2015.  (See http://www.Huishandairy.com/Investor/EN_20150926.pdf )  To 
confound matters further, Huishan’s 2016 annual report continues to refer to Liaoning Ainyveal, with Kai and his 
spouse indirectly owning 66.7%, even though its name has changed three times since then.  (See 
http://www.Huishandairy.com/Investor/EN_20150926.pdf and Huishan FY16 AR, p.68) 
44 Huishan FY14 Annual Report, p. 146.

this subsidiary was always intended to be used for beef ranching, rather than dairy 
farming.) 


• May 2014 through December 2014: Government records show that between May 2014 
and the transfer, Fuyu had completed construction of at least four cattle farms.   


• 23 December 2014: Transfer of Fuyu shares from Huishan Dairy (China) Co., Ltd. 
(formerly named Huishan Investment Co., Ltd) to newly-formed entity Liaoning Fuhan 
Farming Company Ltd., controlled and 100%-owned by an individual named Wang 
Bing.4546  Huishan’s FY15 financial reports disclose no consideration received for the 
disposal of subsidiaries.47  Wang and Fuhan Farming are almost certainly proxies for 
Muhejia and Chairman Yang.  We estimate the value of the assets transferred was at least 
RMB 150 million.  It is likely that the transferred farms included cattle, which would 
increase the value of transfer. 
 


Huishan formed Fuyu on April 11, 2014.48 
 


 
 
Government records show that Fuyu had completed construction of at least four beef ranches by 
the time of the transfer on December 23, 2014.   
 
A 2015 report by the Liaoning City Village Committee for Agricultural and Animal Husbandry 
Economy affairs lists fourteen Huishan Group standard farms that applied for subsidies.49  
Among them are four Fuyu farms with dates of construction listed as May through December 
2014.  The announcement reads: 
 


“Notice of Public Announcement of the List of Qualified Standardized Livestock Farm 
Projects by the Huishan Dairy Group in Shenyang City in 2015 


 
Based on material examination, field investigation, project inspection and acceptance of 
the Huishan Dairy Group's standardized livestock farms, the list of qualified projects of 
14 standardized livestock farms of Huishan Dairy Group in 2015 were determined by 
districts and counties (cities) List, is to be made public for review by the community. It 
shall be publicly available for 7 days (December 24 to December 30, 2015). During the 
public period, if there is discovery of problems, you can phone or submit a form to the 


                                                
45 On January 29, 2015, Huishan Investment Fuyu Shenyang Farming Company changed its name to Shenyang Fuyu 
Farming Company Ltd.; added breeding to scope of operations; appointed Wang Bing as legal representative, 
Executive Director and General Manager. 
46 SAIC records show: sole ownership of Fuyu by Liaoning Fuhan; Wang Bing owning 5% of Fuhan Farming 
directly, and 95% indirectly through Liaoning Younong Investment Company Ltd.

Below is the original in Chinese, showing that four Fuyu farms were completed by the time of 
the transfer: 
 


 
 
Note that the announcement states that these farms were designed for beef ranching, which 
strongly suggests that the farms were never intended to be operated by Huishan, and that the plan 
all along had been to use Huishan investors’ money to build beef cattle ranches for Chairman 
Yang.  Additionally, a public bidding announcement, updated in August 2014, provides some 
details on the construction project for one of Fuyu’s cattle farms and states that the farm is 
designed for cattle meat (beef), not dairy or breeding.50   


Huishan transferred Fuyu on December 23, 2014.

Wang and Fuhan Farming are almost certainly proxies for Muhejia and Chairman Yang.   
 
SAIC files show that Fuyu is controlled by Muhejia.  Our fieldwork confirmed that Muhejia 
controls the Fuyu farms.  A blog promoting Muhejia beef shows that Fuyu is a Muhejia farm.  
The Shenyang government announcement showing Fuyu’s farm construction timelines uses the 
same phone number for both Fuyu and Huishan – despite the announcement having been 
published one year after the transfer and reflecting Wang Bing as Fuyu’s Legal Representative.  
This indicates Fuyu is still under Chairman Yang’s control, despite Huishan having no 
ownership.   


SAIC files show that Fuyu is controlled by Muhejia.  SAIC files list the contact for Fuyu as 
yingcun.sha@muhejiagroup.com.  The telephone numbers 88084909 and 88084919 are Muhejia 
phone numbers; one is also shared with Huabao Investments, a Yang Kai-owned company 
invested in Muhejia,51 and the other used for some Huishan Farms.52 
 





Our fieldwork confirmed that Muhejia owns Fuyu farms.  Our investigators met with a Muhejia 
salesman who knew Wang Bing.  The salesman confirmed he is involved with Muhejia’s 
upstream cattle ranch operations and that Yang Kai was still the big boss.  When visiting the

Fuyu farms, we found the farm gates to be uncharacteristically without signage.  Upon inquiry, 
we learned that the workers believed that the farms belonged to Huishan with them being just 
another division, albeit one raising cattle for beef as opposed to dairy cows for milk.  On one 
Fuyu farm, the gate guard repeatedly confirmed that the farm was Huishan’s and built by 
Huishan, but also acknowledged that Muhejia owned the farm.  This guard subsequently assisted 
our researchers to call the farm manager who then confirmed the farm was indeed Fuyu. 
 
A blog promoting Muhejia beef shows that it owns Fuyu farms.  The following blog identifies 
Fuyu Cattle Farm as part of the Muhejia group.53 








 
We estimate the value of the assets transferred was at least RMB 150 million.   
 
We calculate the value of the infrastructure of the four farms transferred from Huishan to 
Muhejia to be RMB 150 million. According to an online construction cost estimate, the 
estimated project cost for a single farm was RMB 35 million (excluding the cost of obtaining the 
cows).54   


                                                
53 http://www.9500w.cn/page/wtt_wzaobao_com/p/22dcBb2.html , subsequent post identifies the address for one of 
Fuyu’s four farms: Fuyu Fuyu as well.  
54 http://p.tgnet.com/SYHSTZ1/  


Page 28 of 47
As four Fuyu farms were transferred, the construction cost alone imputes a time and materials 
value of RMB 140 million.  Including additional soft costs and considering the value of the 
whole exceeding that of the parts, the implied value would exceed RMB 150 million. 


At the end of 2014, Fuyu’s total assets were reported as RMB 150.4 million, with RMB 121.2 
million in liabilities, leaving owner’s equity of capital as RMB 29.2 million.  The Huishan FY15 
AR does not record any disposal of subsidiaries.  We highly doubt that an improper undisclosed 
transaction of this nature would be accompanied by a proper reassignment of loans and other 
liabilities.  Based on the SAIC annual report from 2014, the likely loss to Huishan resulting from 
this undisclosed asset transfer is at least the total asset value, or RMB 150.4 million.   
 
Huishan likely also transferred cattle, which would have made the theft even larger.  While 
Fuyu’s scope of operations was not updated to include breeding until late January 2015, a search 
of the National Breeder’s license registry revealed that on December 9, 2014 Fuyu received its 
breeding permit.55   
 
 


 
 
In 2015, Fuyu applied for a “large scale cattle ranching enterprise subsidy”, declaring that two 
farms had more than 1,200 head per farm and a third had 510 head.56  Breeding records show 
that cows belonging to Fuyu were impregnated beginning on January 7, 2015, just 14 days after 
the transfer.  By the time of the official company name change and reappointment of senior 
management was completed on January 29, 2015, breeding records list 151 cows aged 14 to 31

months as being impregnated, suggesting these cows were already on the farm in late December, 
thus predating the transfer.57   
 


Huishan’s Liquidity Appears to be on the Knife’s Edge, it has Dubious Assets, and its 
Reported 1H17 Cash Flow is Almost Certainly Fraudulent 


 
Even if Huishan’s financials were not fraudulent, the company appears to be on knife’s edge due 
to its excessive leverage.  The leverage is so substantial that in FY16, Huishan’s auditor appears 
to have stopped just short of issuing a “going concern” qualification.  Given that we conclude 
that its reported profits are fraudulent, we have no confidence that Huishan can make it through 
the next year without defaulting.  There are numerous signs of enormous financial stress, 
including the types of financing Huishan is trying to employ, unfinished projects, and even 
taking Huishan’s financials at face value, horrendous credit metrics.   
 
The asset side of Huishan’s balance sheet, in our opinion, is massively overstated due to 
fraudulent profits and cash, overvalued biological assets (which are fair valued as Level 3 
assets), and certain highly suspicious asset accounts.   
 
We believe Huishan is in very real danger of defaulting in the next year. 
 
Huishan’s auditor obviously has not concluded that Huishan’s that financials are fraudulent; yet, 
it appeared to stop just short of issuing a going concern qualification in its FY16 audit.  Even 
taking Huishan’s financials at face value, its credit metrics are well into the “red zone”.  In our 
opinion, Huishan has a high chance of defaulting in the next year due to its massive short-term 
debt.  Huishan is resorting to creative financing that we believe shows its desperation.  Huishan’s 
incomplete projects show it is financially stressed – construction on its RMB 6.8 billion Xifeng 
liquid milk plant had been stopped when our investigators visited in July 2016; and, instead of 
finding a RMB 8.8 billion liquid milk facility in the Kangping Development Zone in Liaoning, 
all we found were some cow statues. 
 
Huishan’s auditor appears to telling investors the company is on knife’s edge. 
 
KPMG, Huishan’s auditor, appears to have been very close to issuing a “going concern” 
qualification in its FY16 audit.  (The auditor obviously is not considering fraudulent financials in 
its assessment.)  Our interpretation of the below disclosure in the notes to the financials is that 
KPMG only avoided issuing a formal going concern qualification based on assurances from 
Huishan’s directors.  The assurance centers around supposedly having “unconditional banking 
facilities” of RMB 11.2 billion.  The disclosure reads as follows: 


 
“These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
notwithstanding the net current liabilities as at March 31, 2016 because the directors of 
the Company are of the opinion that based on the unconditional banking facilities of 
RMB 11,231,622,000 not yet utilised by the Group as of the date of issue of these 
consolidated financial statements, the Group would have adequate funds to meet its 
liabilities as and when they fall due at least twelve months from the end of the reporting

Page 30 of 47
period. Accordingly, the directors of the Company consider it is appropriate to prepare 
the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.”58 
 


Even more alarming is its 1H17 interim report, wherein Management reported this credit facility 
declined to just RMB 5.0 billion, implying that if this liquidity pool is real, it had been drained 
by more than half.59 
 
Even taking Huishan’s financials at face value, its credit metrics are well into the “red zone”. 
 
Other eye-popping Huishan credit metrics (taking its financials at face value) include: 
 


• Net interest finance cost increased by almost 3x from RMB 205.7 million in 2014 to 
RMB 322.8 million in 2015 and RMB 681million in 2016.606162 As of September 2016, 
finance costs were up to RMB 451.3 million for the first half of the 2017 fiscal year.63 


 
• In 2016, bank charges and other finance costs increased 3x from RMB 10.4 million in 


2015 to RMB 37.5 million in 2016.64 For the six months ending September 30, 2016, 
these costs were a staggering RMB 53.8 million.65 There is no footnote to explains what 
these “other finance costs” are.  


 
• Bank deposits to secure bills payable increased +300% year-on-year (RMB 946 million 


in 2016, up from RMB 314 million in 2015).66 As of September 30, 2016, these deposits 
stood at RMB 962.6 million.67 Huishan has shed no light on what these payables are. 


 
• Another potential finance lease agreement for the sale of unspecified property, plants and 


equipment for a consideration up to RMB 300 million and a lease back rate of 5%.68 
 
Huishan has a high chance of defaulting in the next year due to its massive short-term debt. 
 
With 70% of the company’s debt coming due in less than a year and a limited free cash flow 
profile, Huishan’s debt profile presents a very high risk of a near term default.  (This assessment 
is without considering our conclusion the company is a fraud.)  Huishan will need to somehow 
address RMB 11.1 billion coming due within a year.69   
 
Serious questions arise with the company’s recent cow sale lease back attempts significant recent 
increase in short-term borrowings.  The cow sale and leaseback attempts and drawdowns on its

loan facilities imply that Huishan is concerned about its near-term liquidity and looming near-
term debt maturity.  88% of Huishan’s debt is already secured or guaranteed by PP&E, leases 
and equity.  The ability for the company to offer up additional collateral at this stage is highly 
questionable – particularly given our conclusion that PP&E has been greatly inflated.  The 
company has also announced that it is exploring listing some assets in mainland China.7071  We 
see this as more evidence that it is running out of traditional ways to access capital, and is 
looking to less sophisticated investors to keep the company from collapsing.   
 
The company has found ways to get short-term loans from banks to shore up short-term cash 
needs.  Huishan’s CFO has been talking about extending the maturities on Huishan’s loans; 
however, debt due within one year has spiked 55.4% in 1H17 to RMB 11.1 billion.72  
 
The graph below shows a huge increase in short-term debt borrowings for Huishan over the past 
three years.   
 





 
We find the below statement from the 1H17 interim results puzzling because the auditor 
indicated the only reason it did not issue a going concern qualification was the supposed 
availability of RMB 11.2 billion in borrowing capacity.73  However, six months later, Huishan 
has significantly less borrowing capacity and RMB 11.1 billion debt coming due within a year.74  
This statement seems unduly blasé about whether investors should be worried about Huishan as a 
going concern:75 
   


“These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis notwithstanding the net current liabilities as at September 30, 2016

issue of this interim financial report, the Group would have adequate funds to meet its 
liabilities as and when they fall due at least twelve months from the end of the reporting 
period. ”   
 


This undrawn facility amount has decreased RMB 6.25 billion over the last six months to RMB 
4.98 billion, which is somewhat alarming since the company supposedly generated free cash 
flow in that same time.   
 
As can be seen from the company’s latest interim results, the debt guaranteed by intra-group 
entities spiked by 27.8% in 1H17 to RMB 11.0 billion.  The company should explain why this 
line item has increased so much, and provide details of the covenants and which entities are 
guaranteeing these loans.  








Page 33 of 47
Using low end consensus forward EBITDA of ~ RMB 1.6 billion, Huishan is levered 10.0x with 
RMB 16.0 billion of debt.76   These leverage ratio numbers are equivalent to distressed leverage 
ratios.  Because we believe Huishan’s EBITDA is largely (if not entirely fraudulent), we see the 
real leverage ratio as greatly higher.

Huishan is resorting to creative financing that we believe shows its desperation. 
 
In May, we jokingly suggested on Twitter that Huishan’s announced cow sale and leaseback 
transaction with Guangdong Yuexin Finance Lease Co. Ltd, should be considered for the year’s 
most humorous transaction award.77  In the end, it appears Guangdong Yuexin didn’t like being 
the punch line.  On November 27, 2016, just two days before the release of its 1H17 interim 
results, Management announced that it was “reformulating its plans with respect to finance lease 
arrangements” because the 50,000-cow sale lease-back for RMB 1 billion with Yuexin “lapsed” 
and never took effect.78  If Guangdong Yuexin’s due diligence turned up anything similar to ours, 
that outcome is easy to understand.   
 
The November 27 bulletin announced a new counter party to the sale and leaseback, but on a 
smaller scale, with slightly higher ratio of collateral required: 40,000 cows for RMB 750,000 
million, and at the same 6.2% interest rate.  At the time of the original announcement, analysts 
speculated that this sale and leaseback was intended to raise funds intended for additional share 
buybacks.79  However, the original high-profile nature of the original cow leaseback and the 
timing of the new announcement, imply that the Company knows it cannot afford the fallout if

the new deal fails.  Its short-term debt financing requirements are pressing and lack of 
confidence could constrain or undermine its ability to roll over debt.  Were the cow sale 
leaseback transaction to fail, it would could put Huishan’s entire capital structure at risk. 
 
Milking assets: More sales and leasebacks. 
 
These “cows for cash” plans are not the Company’s only sales and leasebacks. Two plant and 
equipment sales and leasebacks were on the books at the end of FY16 for over RMB 541 million.  
Huishan added RMB 146 million of sales and leaseback of PP&E and dairy cows80 in 1H17, for 
a total of RMB 687 million payable in full within three years.8182   Additionally, a new sale and 
leaseback for RMB 300 million for PP&E was announced on December 8, 2016 with JIC 
(Tianjin) Leasing Co., Ltd. bringing the total (ex-cows) to six sales and leasebacks involving 
four financing companies for nearly RMB 1 billion plant and equipment.83  Adding in the RMB 
750 million replacement transaction for the cows, the total value of assets liquidated comes to 
RMB 1.7 billion.  These transactions provide immediate cash infusions, but come with additional 
medium-term obligations.  
 
Incremental “innovation”: Huishan plans to issue a high interest WMP.  
 
In late June 2016, Huishan’s Executive Director, Ge Kun, stated that the Company would further 
consider “innovative financing tools” like the cow sales and lease back.84  Just two weeks later, 
the story of a new financing innovation for Huishan emerged in the Chinese news.  The 
Company would be working with Zhejiang Internet Finance Trade Center Holding Co. Ltd. to 
raise short-term funds through the sale of WMPs to high net worth individuals.  The Zhejiang 
Internet Finance Trade Center Holding Co. Ltd was to be responsible for marketing the product, 
and Huishan for issuing the credit guarantee.  The tenor was slated to be only 183-days while 
paying an annual interest rate of 7.2%.85   
 
A Huishan Dairy official involved in the deal tried to put a positive spin on this extremely costly 
financing, “This will be our first serious effort to interact with East China’s high-end 
investors,”86 adding that these investors were more financially savvy.  Outside of the news story, 
no formal announcement has been made by the Company regarding this offering.  However, if 
these East China investors are really savvy this WMP will be a tough sell.

Collateral and equity squeeze portend calamity. 
 
Huishan faces a collateral and equity squeeze that is extremely dangerous.  The company’s RMB 
15.3 billion in bank loans, nearly RMB 11 billion of which come due in September 2017, exceed 
equity by 18.6% as of September 30, 2016.87   
 
Construction stopped on the RMB 6.8 billion Xifeng liquid milk plant. 
 
Huishan Dairy (Xifeng) Co., Ltd’s liquid milk investment project is in Xifeng.  Our researchers 
found the site essentially abandoned with construction half complete. A security guard onsite 
explained that the construction had been going on for approximately two years but had ground to 
a halt in 2015. The guard did not have details as to why, but stated that Xifeng Dairy was not 
hiring.   
 
Information panels onsite describe the scope of the project.  The total investment for the Xifeng 
project was to reach RMB 6.8 billion, RMB 900 million of which had already been made.  The 
project was to consist of 21 cow farms, a dairy processing factory with liquid milk production 
capacity of 300 tons per day, and biogas power and fertilizer facilities.  The plans for the Xifeng 
factory call for it to eventually cover a total area of land of 265,690.5 m2 (about 400 mu).   
 
A Tieling city government announcement regarding the project provided details that varied 
slightly from those posted on location.  The processing plant and farms were two separate 
projects.  The Huishan Xifeng project commenced in May 2014 and was to be completed by 
October 2015.  The dairy-processing project is to cover 27 hectares of land with an investment of 
RMB 1.37 billion.88  A construction project database contains information as of April 5, 2016, 
stating that main construction is ongoing.89  Our researchers spoke with an employee of the 
Huishan project office at the Xifeng Industrial Zone Management Committee who confirmed 
that construction was not complete but also did not know a new timeline for completion. 
 
The 2015 SAIC file reported that Huishan Dairy (Xifeng) Co. had registered capital of RMB 100 
million, total assets of RMB 203.7 million, total liabilities of RMB 106.4 million, owner’s equity 
of RMB 97.3 million, and losses of RMB 2.3 million. 
 
Huishan RMB 8.8 billion liquid milk plant investment in Kangping: Nothing but cow statues 
 
Huishan claims to have a liquid milk products production facility called Huishan Investment 
(Shenyang) Dairy Co. Ltd. in the Kangping Development Zone in Kangping County, Liaoning. 
Our investigators visited the development zone in July 2016 and found no operational factory or 
construction site under the name of Huishan – only a group of cow statues, that we can only 
guess was intended as a kind of public relations feature.

A media report from June 2014 claims that Huishan launched its dairy industry cluster in 
December 2013 and that, like Xifeng and Fuxin, it would consist of dairy processing factories, 
farms and related facilities that cover the whole value chain of dairy production.  Total 
investment would be RMB 8.8 billion with an estimated completion in 2016.  The report does 
not mention the timeline for constructions of the dairy processing factory in the Kangping 
Development Zone.90  The magistrate of Kangping County visited the Kangping dairy processing 
factory project and inspected the construction progress, indicating that the project was not 
finished then.91 
 
According to a public bidding notice, Huishan invited proposals for the power engineering and 
construction of “Huishan Dairy’s project in Kangping.”  The proposed construction period is 
listed as December 1 to December 31, 2014.92  A March 2016 Kangping County Investment 
Bureau report on 26 major investment projects includes Huishan’s Kangping dairy industry 
cluster as one of the key construction projects for 2016, but does not provide any details on a 
timeline.93  Additional media searches and field observations found no evidence of a construction 
site in Kangping Development Zone of this project’s scale, leading us to conclude that 
processing facilities to make up the core of this dairy cluster have undergone only preliminary 
stage development at best.

We Believe Huishan’s Asset Accounts are Massively Overstated 
 
In addition to what could be a cow farm PP&E overstatement as large as RMB 1.6 billion, we 
have substantial concerns about other asset accounts.  Even forgetting the evidence of fraudulent 
profits, Huishan’s cash balance is highly suspicious due to the company’s nonsensical capital 
structure.  Huishan’s inventory presents a significant red flag.  We strongly doubt Huishan’s 
reported raw material prepayment balances.  Huishan appears to be hiding a RMB 1.5 fair value 
loss on biological assets (cattle).   
 
Huishan’s cash balance is highly suspect – even forgetting that its profits are fraudulent. 
 
Huishan’s recent capital market activity supports our view that the company is a fraud – 
particularly considering its strong reported 1H17 cash flow.  In our experience, one of the most 
common signs a company is forging its cash balances is borrowing more money than it 
seemingly needs to, and at rates higher than what it earns on its cash.  Huishan fits this profile.  It 
reported cash and short-term investments of RMB 9.8 billion in 1H17, up from RMB 4.1 billion 
as of FY16.94  From March 31, 2016 through September 30, 2016, Huishan reports operating 
cash flow of RMB 3.1 billion and levered free cash flow of RMB 2.7 billion.95   
 
Despite these strong results, Huishan is borrowing at rates far higher than it purports to receive 
on its cash and short-term investments.  In early 2016, Huishan invested RMB 845 million in 
WMPs at 3.2% to 3.8%, but then in April 2016 attempted to secure RMB 1 billion through a 
dairy cattle sale and leaseback scheme at 6.2%.9697  After the initial cow sale and lease back fell 
through, the company announced a new replacement RMB 750 million sale and leaseback 
agreement at the same interest rate.98  According to a newspaper report, Huishan is planning the 
sale of its own WMP at an annual rate of 7.2% for 183-day paper.99100   
 
Huishan’s inventory presents a significant red flag. 
 
Huishan reported a big blow out in inventory of “semi-finished and finished goods” in FY2016, 
more than doubling from RMB 463 million in 2015 to RMB 987 million in 2016.101  In 2014, it 
was only RMB 189.7 million.102  While the company does not provide insight into such 
inventories in its FY17 interim report, it does cite the “exceptional” case of sales of 13,484 tons 
of dairy ingredients (whole milk powder) for over RMB 171.4 million.103  It appears then that the 
inventory blowout of prior years was in part because Huishan converted raw milk it couldn’t sell 
into whole milk powder.  As the shelf life for whole milk powder is limited and the company

notes that further sales are not sustainable, it seems to us that the inventory should be written 
down. 
 
Another inventory-related oddity is the fact that Huishan claimed no raw milk balances at year-
end of FY13 and FY14.104  Huishan has not mentioned raw milk balances in its filings since then.  
We believe this is a lie, albeit a strange and unnecessary one, possibly propagated to portray the 
company as highly efficient.  In its prospectus, Huishan asserts that it “ha[s] always sold or 
consumed [its] raw milk at the day of milking.”105 
 
Given that dairy farm and milking operations are continuous, and our research indicates that raw 
milk pickups typically occur at most twice a day, there could be as much as one-half day of 
output in cold storage at a farm on any given day.  In FY14, for example, this would have 
amounted to as many as 500 tons of raw milk worth RMB 2.5 million.  While this is not a 
material amount, it does point to the company’s propensity to mislead investors on its operations 
and its financial reality. 
 
Huishan’s prepayments for raw materials are highly suspicious, and add to our extreme 
skepticism about the value of the company’s assets. 
 
Huishan is making huge prepayments for unspecified raw materials, which given the company’s 
stretched financial position, does not make sense.  Therefore, we find this account highly 
suspicious.  Prepayments for purchase of raw materials increased 545% year-on-year (RMB 1.56 
billion as of FY16, up from RMB 242 million as of FY15). 106  As of September 30, 2016, the 
number came down to RMB 493 million.107  We are at a loss to explain what raw materials 
Huishan would be buying. To put things in perspective, RMB 1 billion would buy: 
 


• Enough imported alfalfa to feed all Huishan’s milkable cows a standard ration (not the 
current reduced ration) for over three years,108 


• Building materials to construct over 50 new farms,109 


                                                
104 As at March 31, 2014, the Group did not have any unsold or unused raw milk but had RMB156.13 million 
harvested but unused alfalfa grass and other feed crops with a respective gain of RMB86.51 million recognised upon 
harvest (March 31, 2013: RMB22.61 million harvested but unused alfalfa grass, which have been used up in the year 
ended March 31, 2014 with the respective gain of RMB18.26 million charged to the cost of sales for the year ended 
March 31, 2014). 


--2014 AR, p.88 
As at March 31, 2011 and 2012, the Group did not have any milked or harvested but unsold or unused raw milk or 
alfalfa grass. As at March 31, 2013, the Group did not have any unsold or unused raw milk but had RMB22.6 
million harvested but unused alfalfa grass.

During our fieldwork, we did not see or hear of purchases at this scale taking place. We think the 
likeliest explanation is that this line item absorbs much of the fake cash that Huishan generates. 
 
In our opinion, Huishan is hiding an approximately RMB 1.5 billion fair value loss on its 
biological assets. 
 
We believe that by reporting its internal raw milk sales price was 14% higher than the external 
sales price in 1H17, Huishan is hiding an approximately RMB 1.5 billion loss on the fair value of 
its milkable cows. In the past, the price difference has not been greater than 1% through FY15.111  
Huishan’s claimed significant spike in realized raw milk prices seems to us completely 
unwarranted. 
 


 
Source: Huishan 2016/2017 Interim Results Presentation, p. 19 
 
The dramatic increase in average selling price is due to the higher relative price of milk sold 
internally.  In other words, the internal sales price is much higher than that of the external 
(market) price. By inflating future cash flow expectations built into its Level 3 valuation model, 
Huishan can maintain the fair value of its milkable cows and hide a massive loss.

111 In FY16, Huishan apparently began to use an inflated yield number in its fair value calculation: Huishan used a 
yield rate range of 8.9 to 9.6 in its fair value calculation while the actual claimed yield rate was only 8.6. 


Page 40 of 47
Huishan shows the various components it uses for fair value calculation—lactation period, raw 
milk ASP, yield rate, culling rate—in its prospectus and annual reports.112113  Although the yield 
rate and the raw milk price dropped significantly since FY2015, Huishan reported increasing fair 
value.  
 
Management has consistently reported initiatives to reduce their feed costs to sustain margin on 
raw milk, which we question in section in this report.  As the impact of the feed cost adjustments 
are reducing yields, the marginal impact on profit is negative, so the impact on the fair value is 
negative.114  
 
The Company previously reported an organic growth rate of 10%.  As the total herd size reported 
a first ever decline in 1H17, we conclude that a dramatically increased rate of culling (perhaps 2x 
the historical rate) should be a major factor reducing the herd’s valuation.

Huishan’s expectation of rising prices appears to be at odds with that of their competitor Yili, 
which is also its largest external customer for raw milk.115116  According to Yili’s 1H 2016 results 
call at the end of August 2016, the Yili’s management did not yet see the turning point in milk 
prices, and even considered some minor declines still possible:117

dairy product enterprises” at a higher price as evidence of that.

Q: The speed with which low milk producing cows was taken off, did the speed of cutting excess capacity lead to a turning point in the domestic price (of raw milk)? Has that point already 
arrived, or when it will be reached? Is there any reliable data? 
  
A: The up-stream farms are under a lot of pressure. It won’t continue to incrementally worsen the future, but may still slightly decline. Next year will be better, but it won’t be an obvious turn 
around. Capacity cuts are part of the push to improve the upstream development process and increase the production per head, eliminating low production cows, and improving production 
efficiency. Many entities invested in dairy farms from 2012 to 2014, these investments were quite large, resulting in an excess of dairy cows. 
  
The overall production capacity did not decline, but the number of cows decreased. 
 


We believe Huishan should take a fair value loss on its milkable cow herd because their income 
dropped due to the lower yield rate and raw milk price.  Holding other factors constant, the drop 
of income from each milkable cow would reduce the future cash flow directly.  The average 
revenue per milkable cow declined from FY15, the last period in which the selected production 
yield rate is within the range used for fair value calculated.  There is a 34% drop in the annual 
income associated with milkable cows.  Thus, there should also be a corresponding decline in the 
fair value of a milkable cow.118  Based on a fair value reduction of 38% (Table 4), we calculate 
the fair value loss is RMB 1.5 billion (Table 5).

Large Probable Share Pledges Present Substantial Risk to Equity Holders 
 
We believe that a substantial amount of Huishan’s shares are pledged to lenders.  If we are 
correct, this presents a risk to long holders because the borrower(s) could have their positions 
liquidated in a disorderly fashion if they are unable to meet a margin call.   
 
We analyzed date from Hong Kong’s Central Clearing and Automated Settlement System 
(“CCASS”), which houses data for all settled trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that 
indicate large numbers of Huishan shares have been pledged, most likely as collateral for 
personal loans.  CCAS data includes the date the holding last changed, the holdings of each 
participant across the market, the net daily movements of holdings in each stock and of holdings 
by each participant, as well as the time series of holdings by one participant in one stock.  In the 
case of brokers, this gives one a clearer idea of what stocks they deal in most, and if one has a 
margin account, what the pool of collateral might include.  This collateral pool is often pledged 
to lenders, and if its value falls suddenly then it can trigger a brokerage collapse. 
 
Types of CCASS Participants are brokers, custodians, pledgees, clearing houses and Investor 
Participants (IPs). The CCASS IDs of brokers are prefixed "B".  Broker participants may also be 
pledgees, and custodians may hold pledged stock.  Except for investor participants, CCASS 
Participants may or may not have beneficial interests in the shares they hold in CCASS, so it 
can’t be used as a guide to beneficial ownership. 
 
We see that an increasing number of Huishan shares were moved into CCASS from September 
2013 through August 2016: 
 





Page 44 of 47
While the CCASS data is inconclusive as to the exact number of shares pledged the significant 
movement of shares into the CCASS clearing system gives a strong indication that a significant
