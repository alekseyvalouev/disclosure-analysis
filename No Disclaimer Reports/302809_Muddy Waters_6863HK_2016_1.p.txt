Part 1 


 
We are short China Huishan Dairy Holdings (6863 HK / “Huishan”) because we believe it is 
worth close to Zero.  We conclude Huishan is a fraud.  In this first report on Huishan, we detail 
the following conclusions and supporting facts.   
 
Since at least 2014, the company has reported fraudulent profits largely based on the lie that it is 
substantially self-sufficient in producing alfalfa.  We found overwhelming evidence that Huishan 
has long purchased substantial quantities of alfalfa from third parties, which gives us no doubt 
that Huishan’s financials are fraudulent.   
 
We believe Huishan has engaged in CapEx fraud related to its cow farms.  We estimate that 
Huishan has overstated the spending on these farms by RMB 893 million to RMB 1.6 billion.  
The primary purpose of the CapEx fraud is likely to support the company’s income statement 
fraud.   
 
Chairman Yang appears to have stolen at least RMB 150 million of assets from Huishan – the 
actual number is quite possibly higher.  The theft relates to the unannounced transfer of a 
subsidiary that owned at least four cow farms to an undisclosed related party.  It is clear to us 
that Chairman Yang controls the subsidiary and farms.   
 
Even if Huishan’s financials were not fraudulent, the company appears to be on the verge of 
default due to its excessive leverage.  Taking Huishan’s financials at face value, its credit metrics 
are horrible.  The leverage is so substantial that in FY16, Huishan’s auditor appears to have 
stopped just short of issuing a “going concern” qualification.  Given that we conclude Huishan’s 
reported profits are fraudulent, we have no confidence that Huishan can make it through the next 
year without defaulting.  There are clear signs of enormous financial stress, including the types 
of financing Huishan is trying to employ and halted projects.  The asset side of Huishan’s 
balance sheet, in our opinion, is massively overstated due to fraudulent profits and cash, 
overvalued biological assets, and certain highly suspicious asset accounts. 
 


Page 2 of 47
Although Huishan has a “real business” in contrast to a typical Zero, its massive leverage cause 
us to conclude that its equity is close to worthless.  It is our view that Huishan’s asset values and 
reported profits are inflated by significant amounts, and that its cash is greatly overstated.  The 
extent of these overstatements are unclear, and it is likely there are other asset accounts that are 
similarly afflicted.  Valuing Huishan’s true equity value requires knowing the truth about its 
accounts – and truth is in short supply at Huishan. 
 
CCASS data strongly suggests that a significant portion of Huishan’s outstanding shares has 
been pledged as collateral for loans.  If we are correct, this presents a significant risk to long 
holders if the borrower(s) is / are unable to meet margin calls. 
 
We researched Huishan for several months.  During this time, our investigators visited 35 farms, 
five production facilities (including one that was halted mid-construction), and two announced 
production sites that had no evidence of construction.  Additionally, our investigators conducted 
drone flyovers of selected Huishan sites.  We engaged three dairy experts, including two with 
deep backgrounds in China dairy farming.  We and our investigators spoke with suppliers and 
importers of alfalfa in three different provinces, some of whom were selling alfalfa to Huishan.  
In addition, we conducted extensive due diligence into Huishan’s topline, which we will discuss 
in Part 2.   
 


Fraudulently Inflating Margins by Falsely Claiming Alfalfa Self-Sufficiency 
 
We conclude that Huishan has fraudulently inflated its gross margins and reported profits since 
at least FY14 by lying about being self-sufficient in alfalfa. Huishan cites self-sufficiency in 
alfalfa production as the main driver of its industry-leading gross margin.  Our research indicates 
that Huishan was never self-sufficient in alfalfa.  Instead Huishan has bought substantial 
quantities of alfalfa from third parties at higher prices than its claimed production costs. The 
company also claims to preserve margins by implementing a feed cost reduction effort that we 
find dubious.  Starting in FY16, Huishan began claiming that it is decreasing alfalfa rations to 
engineer lower milk yields in an environment of depressed prices.  We do not believe this holds 
water, and instead view it as a ham-fisted attempt to unwind the alfalfa fraud. 
 


 
Huishan has claimed to be self-sufficient in producing alfalfa 
 
Huishan implied self-sufficiency in alfalfa as early as FY13 by reporting an alfalfa crop surplus.1  
The slide below from Huishan’s FY15 annual presentation repeats this claim.2

What is alfalfa? 
Alfalfa is a protein and vitamin rich grass that boosts milk yield and protein content, a key 
determinant in the selling price of raw milk.  It is the “grass” in Huishan’s much-heralded 
fully integrated “Grass to Glass” model.1    


Page 3 of 47
Huishan’s purported alfalfa self-sufficiency is the cornerstone of its margins 
 
Because Huishan has in fact been purchasing substantial quantities of alfalfa from third parties, 
its profits have been fraudulently overstated by a massive amount.  By claiming to be self-
sufficient in alfalfa production, Huishan has reported outsize margins by purportedly not having 
to purchase alfalfa from third party vendors or arranging long-haul transportation. 3   In its IPO 
prospectus, Huishan claimed its own production costs were $70/mt (approximately RMB 
437/mt), versus approximately $400/mt (approximately RMB 2,500/mt) for imported alfalfa.  
Huishan emphasized logistics cost and quality advantages of having their alfalfa farms close to 
its feed processing companies and dairy farms.4  The short supply chain also supposedly meant 
improved retention of the grass’ protein content that otherwise is degraded during transportation 
and handling.5  We estimated Huishan reported a cost savings of a short supply chain for alfalfa 
to be RMB 83 to 110 million (RMB 600 to 800/mt) based on FY14 reported production 
volumes.6   
 
Huishan has booked biological gains on purported harvested alfalfa crops.  As shown below, 
from FY13 through FY16, bio-gains from alfalfa comprised 19% to 24% of Huishan’s pre-tax 
profits.  These low production costs were the catalyst for improving margins in its dairy farming 
business segment from 42.7% to 59.8% during FY11 to FY13.7   In 2013, a major investment 
bank estimated that Huishan’s alfalfa plantations contributed 22% of cash EBITDA (excluding 
biological losses) to its dairy farming business.

Most of Huishan’s comps do not claim to grow substantial amounts of alfalfa.  As a result, 
Huishan reports gross margin and EBITDA substantially higher than those of its peers.  Because 
Huishan has not been self-sufficient in producing alfalfa, the reported outsize margins are 
fictitious.     
 


 
 
Huishan appears to be trying to take some of the air out of the fraudulent margins by reporting 
escalating alfalfa production costs.  Alfalfa production costs rose 31% from $70/mt (approx. 
RMB 422/mt) in 2013 to $92/mt (approx. RMB 579/mt) in 2014 and another 16% to $107/mt 
(approximately RMB 656/mt) in 2015.8910  From the company’s bio asset valuation tables, we 
estimate that Huishan booked a 14% per ton increase in FY16 to US$122/mt (approximately 
RMB 773/mt). 
 
Huishan lied about being self-sufficient in alfalfa 
 
Huishan has been lying about being self-sufficient in alfalfa likely since at least FY14. 1112   
 


• Our investigators found Huishan using Anderson Hay & Grain Company alfalfa imported 
from the U.S.13  Anderson’s China agent confirmed that Huishan has been a significant 
client since 2013.   
 


• Employees at nine farms confirmed that Huishan purchases alfalfa from third parties 
overseas and in Heilongjiang.

• A Heilongjiang alfalfa distributor also confirmed that his company has a longstanding 
relationship to supply Huishan with sheep grass and alfalfa.   
 


• A sign at one of Huishan’s “show farms” states that it feeds the cows with alfalfa 
imported from the U.S.   
 


• An investor who diligenced Huishan in 2014 provided us with photographs his 
investigators took on Huishan farms that show it was feeding U.S. alfalfa produced by El 
Toro.   
 


• On the surface, Huishan’s purported alfalfa production is hard to believe, given the 
flooding issues in Liaoning where it has its farms.   
 


• We spotted a red flag in Huishan’s reported alfalfa production – its alfalfa production per 
head has decreased precipitously since its IPO, once again supporting our conclusion that 
Huishan’s alfalfa claims are false. 


 
Our investigators discovered Huishan has been a significant customer of Anderson.  It appears 
Anderson supplied quantities approximately equal to half of Huishan’s purported FY14 alfalfa 
production.  Our investigators took the below photograph at a Huishan farm. 
 


 
 
We contacted Anderson’s importer/agent in China, who confirmed that Huishan has been a 
customer for three years.  According to the agent, Huishan’s shipments from Anderson started in 
2013 with approximately 70,000 mt that year, dropped to 30,000-40,000 mt/yr in 2014 and 2015 
when the China milk market softened, and that volume improved modestly in 2016.   The 
reported volumes supplied by Anderson in 2013 alone equate to about half of Huishan’s FY14 
(April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014) reported total internal consumption.  The importer/agent also 
provided current market prices, quoting RMB 2,330/mt (approximately US$345) based on 
delivery at the port of Dalian.14 
 
Huishan purchases domestic alfalfa from third parties as well.  A Heilongjiang distributor 
confirmed that they have been supplying the Company with alfalfa and sheep grass for several 
years and have very good “guanxi” with the Company’s purchasing manager.15

15 Guanxi literally means a “personal relationship.”  In business, it is often used to allude to relationship capital 
accrued through the give and take of special favors and is a common euphemism for bribes or kickbacks.

Signage on Huishan’s farms further contradicts its filings. Visitors to one of the company’s 
“show farms” are told calves raised there are fed premium alfalfa imported from the US.    
 
An investor who conducted extensive due diligence on Huishan in 2014 gave us information that 
corroborates our investigators’ work.  We were told that in 2014, the investor’s investigators 
visited seven farms with about 16,000 cows in total.  The investigators reported these farms used 
imported alfalfa extensively, if not exclusively.16  Their photos show imported alfalfa in its 
export wrapping from El Toro, one of the US’s largest alfalfa exporters.17  (Because we did not 
engage these investigators ourselves, we only cite their work product as evidence that 
corroborates our own research.  We believe the investor and their diligence work are credible, 
but we cannot attest to the accuracy of their research.)

investor. 


 
We believe one reason that Huishan cannot grow enough alfalfa for its needs is that northeastern 
China isn’t a good area for this crop. Despite touting Liaoning as “one of the most suitable 
planting areas for alfalfa growing,” the region’s climate poses stark challenges.18  Many of 
Huishan’s alfalfa farms are in Chang Tu Township in Liaoning.19  A January 2014 court 
judgment regarding a dispute in Chang Tu over fields leased to Huishan highlights these issues: a 
defendant pointed out that farming in that area was risky and that over a ten-year period the Liao 
river flooded the leased parcel numerous times.20 
 
The third party investor’s investigators visited Chang Tu in the winter of 2014.  They reported 
having conversations with local farmers who reported serious damage to Huishan’s fields from

flooding in summer 2013, which caused an estimated crop loss of RMB 40 million.21  In summer 
2014, the alfalfa farms reportedly suffered debilitating drought, again impacting production.22   
 
The ratio of reported alfalfa production to herd size belies Huishan’s claims of self-sufficiency.  
Since the IPO, the growth rates of supply and demand have diverged markedly.   While the 
reported number of milkable cows doubled and the number of calves nearly tripled over the past 
four years, annual production and acreage under cultivation failed to keep pace.  
 
A calculation of alfalfa available for consumption on a per head basis (based on the Company’s 
production, surplus, and calf and milkable cow herd size numbers) indicates that from FY13, the 
available quantity of self-produced alfalfa for milkable cows (kg/day) declined each year.  The 
available ration of self-grown alfalfa declined year-on-year by about 9% in FY14, 24% in FY15, 
and 53% in FY16.  As the following chart shows, Huishan’s reported 2015 (FY16) alfalfa 
production is down 25% on an absolute basis from FY13, and declined every year on a per head 
of milkable cow basis since its IPO.

Claim of Boosting Margins by Reducing Feed Costs Lacks Credence 
 
We believe Huishan is trying to unwind its yield fraud by claiming changes to its feed mix.  If 
the company were actually reducing yields, Huishan would be losing money in doing so and 
shrinking its reported margins.  Therefore, we see this claim as a way to try to avoid exposure of 
its fraud.  Facing declining raw milk ASPs, Huishan claimed to boost profit margins by reducing 
feed costs, with just a minor drop in raw milk yields (9.1 in FY15 vs. 8.6 in FY16).23  In its 
interim report published in late November 2016, Huishan announced that it deliberately lowered 
milk yields to 7.8 tons “to further reduce the cost of raw milk and control our production 
volume.”24 
 
Chinese and American dairy experts with whom we spoke dispute the logic, wisdom, and 
commercial feasibility of such action.  They noted that it runs counter to best practices utilized

for the past decade, and would most likely result in a decline in profitability. The authors of a 
study in 2006 on the impacts of marginal cost and profitability by altering the quality of the feed 
ration found that “significant profit opportunities can be lost in the false pursuit of reducing input 
costs” and that “it is unlikely…that it is ever financially wise to deliberately limit the energy 
intake of a milking dairy cow.” 25  
 
Our analysis of financial data reported by Huishan shows that revenue decreases from lost sales 
exceed the cost savings from altering feed rations, corroborating these expert opinions.  Huishan 
reported 74,389 milkable cows and feed cost of RMB 946,100,000 in FY15, and 96,339 milkable 
cows and feed cost of RMB 1,050,029,000 in FY16.26  While the company purportedly saved 
RMB 1,646 in annual feed costs per cow, it lost RMB 2,208 in sales per cow, which equals a net 
marginal loss of RMB 562 per cow.

We Estimate Huishan Inflated Dairy Farm CapEx by as Much as RMB 1.6 Billion 


 
We estimate that since its IPO, Huishan inflated CapEx for dairy farm construction by RMB 893 
million to RMB 1.6 billion.  Our conclusions are based on our investigators visiting 17 Huishan 
cow farms started or completed since the IPO, extensive research of government records, and 
consulting industry experts.  Overstating CapEx is typical for frauds.  When a company reports 
fake profits, it has a “fake cash problem.”  The only anti-fraud device most audits employ is cash 
confirmation.  Although many frauds in China have forged cash balances, it can be challenging 
to do so.  As a result, frauds tend to buy assets and over-report the amounts they paid.  This gives 
them an excuse for not actually having the cash their reported profits imply.  In our opinion, 
Huishan is inflating its CapEx in a manner consistent with this pattern. 
 
Because Huishan does not expressly disclose the amounts it spends on constructing dairy farms, 
we have to estimate it.  Huishan’s prospectus seems to attempt to mislead investors into 
believing that the company planned to spend approximately RMB 45.2 million per farm.  
However, we estimate that from FY14 to FY16, Huishan booked approximately RMB 89 million 
for each of the 32 farms it built – totaling RMB 3.0 billion.27  We believe the actual amount 
Huishan could have expended is substantially less than that amount.  Furthermore, on several

occasions we encountered milking farms lacking milking equipment, and thus incomplete, again 
leading us to question the total amount of CapEx deployed to-date.   
 
Huishan is cagey about its dairy farm CapEx spending. 
 
Huishan has always been opaque about its dairy farm CapEx.  While the IPO prospectus 
excludes an average construction cost, the disclosed use of proceeds appeared to indicate that the 
average CapEx for the 45 new farms would be RMB 45.2 million per farm including land, 
construction, machinery, and equipment. (This figure is in line with what industry experts that 
we consulted consider to be the likely cost range of its farms.)

The prospectus seems to give Huishan the wiggle room to spend substantially more on dairy 
farms.  Elsewhere in the prospectus, Huishan indicates that it supposedly has supplemental funds 
it plans to add to the spend on dairy farms.  In a paragraph related to Connected Party 
Transactions, the company states that the total planned expenditure to complete five farms would 
be around HKD$ 89 million each (~RMB 70 million), which exceeds by a large margin the 
amount implied using Proceeds disclosure.28  However, throughout the Prospectus the wording 
on disclosures for the sources of funds for future expenditure varies.  In many places, the 
Prospectus specifies when the IPO proceeds will be the sole source of funding.  Language like

the below is repeated in disclosures relating to intended expenditures for new 360,000 tpa liquid 
milk plant, the 33,000 tpa milk powder plant, and two feeds processing plants to be built in 
Liaoning: 29 








The “entirely” through offering proceeds verbiage is notably absent in discussion of the use for 
proceeds for dairy farm construction, opening the door to per farm CapEx exceeding the 
disclosed use of IPO proceeds.   
 


 
We estimate that from FY14 through FY16, Huishan booked CapEx of RMB 89 million per 
dairy farm; FY16 CapEx appears to have ballooned to RMB 107 million.  
 
From Huishan’s cashflow disclosures, we estimate Huishan booked average dairy farm CapEx 
spend of RMB 89 million during FY14 through FY16.  We estimate that in FY16, Huishan 
booked average spend of RMB 107 million.  If our estimates are generally correct, the increase 
in FY16 likely is related to Huishan’s increasing financial stress.  Government environmental 
impact reports support our three-year average estimate, showing total investments of RMB 90 
million to 99.9 million per each farm that principally produces raw milk, and RMB 64 million to 
RMB 81 million for farms principally engaged in breeding and raising calves (which require no 
milking equipment and fewer amenities).   
 
We use Huishan’s cash flow disclosures to estimate average dairy farm CapEx spend.  Huishan’s 
annual reports provide detail on cash flow utilized for PP&E expenditures and breaks out capital 
expenditures in its segment reporting.  Using Company-supplied data we estimated the CapEx 
dedicated to PP&E for the 32 farms reportedly built from FY14 through FY16.  These 
calculations show that over the three-year period the average claimed CapEx spend for PP&E per 
dairy farm was very likely RMB 89 million, which we believe is a low / company favorable 
estimate.

We first deduct the segment CapEx for liquid milk and milk powder processing (the processing 
plants) as well as the PPE expense for motor vehicles from the cash flows utilized for PP&E.  
This isolates the PP&E for the dairy farming segment.  The dairy farming segment still includes 
plantation operations, feed processing, as well as dairy farming; therefore, we estimate the PP&E 
for feed processing plants based on the changes announced in the annual use of proceeds 
statement (which was to be funded entirely from the IPO proceeds30) and estimate the additional 
PP&E for the plantations as being half of that used for the procurement of the equipment listed in 
the IPO.  The changes in construction in process were then factored back into the total, providing 
an estimate for the total CapEx for PP&E on completed farms.

Page 13 of 47
We consider this estimate to be conservative because: 
 


• Note 1: The PPE for plantation buildings is not specifically disclosed.  We estimate it 
based on a 2:1 ratio of feed processing plants to plantation building expense as we 
believe that the processing plant will require much greater CapEx than the plantation 
farm sheds, storage, and office spaces.   In FY16 no expansion of the plantations took 
place, so it is likely that no new construction took place; therefore, the allocation of the 
expense was 45% to each of FY14 and FY15, and just 10% to FY16. In 1H17, the 
Company reported a decrease in plantation lands of 90,000 mu.  If the Company had 
considered this a possibility, new investments in FY16 would very likely have been 
further curtailed. 
 


• The CapEx for plants includes both PP&E and land lease payments.  Because PP&E 
excludes land, the additions for constructing the plants alone would be lower than the 
total CapEx for plants.  This is company favorable because it likely overestimates the 
amount of PP&E spending for plants, and thus results in a lower per dairy farm estimate. 


 
• The changes in Construction in Process (CIP) includes that for plants, however we 


adopted assumption that all CIP was for the dairy farms.  Likewise, motor vehicles 
include farm and non-farm operations. We assume all PP&E in this category apply to 
dairy farms.  This is company favorable because it likely underestimates the amount of 
CIP allocated to plants, and thus results in a lower per dairy farm estimate. 





Page 14 of 47
In FY16, there was less non-dairy farm investment and construction activity, no feed plantations 
lands were added, the Shenbei plant was finished, and the Jiangsu plant was also nearly 
complete, so investments in processing plants were considerably smaller.   In FY16, Huishan 
completed 13 operational dairy farms.  Based on FY16 numbers, we calculated an average per 
farm CapEx spend of approximately RMB 107 million (see Table 3 below), suggesting that the 
dairy farm CapEx inflation increased in FY16 – possibly due to Huishan’s financial stress (see 
Huishan’s Liquidity Appears to be on the Knife’s Edge, it has Dubious Assets, and its Reported 
1H17 Cash Flow is Almost Certainly Fraudulent).

Liaoning government documents accord with our estimates.  Our review of publicly accessible 
Liaoning Province environmental impact reports from 2014 and 2015 found numerous instances 
where Huishan appears to have made claims of building new farms with total investments in the 
same range as that identified from our cash flow analysis.  The reports list projected total 
investments for individual farms principally producing raw milk of RMB 90 million to 99.9 
million (which should include the land leases of approximately RMB 5 million to RMB 6 
million).  Reports for farms that are principally breeding and raising calves projected spending of 
RMB 64 million to RMB 81 million.  We believe Huishan reported inflated numbers for these 
reports to win greater support from local officials, and to support the CapEx numbers it provides 
its auditor. 
 


Page 15 of 47
We conclude that Huishan’s real spend per dairy farm is substantially lower than our estimates of 
its reported spend. 
 
We consulted two China dairy farm experts with first-hand knowledge of farm construction costs 
to assist in estimating Huishan’s actual dairy farm construction costs.  We provided them with 
photos and videos from seven post-IPO dairy farms our investigators visited.31  Expert A opined 
that the maximum Huishan spent per milking farm was only likely RMB 60 million (assuming a 
3,000-head farm).  Expert B opined that the maximum per such farm was likely only RMB 35 
million.  Based on our estimated reported dairy farm construction costs, these estimates suggest 
that since going public, Huishan has overstated average dairy farm CapEx by one third (~RMB 
29 million) to over one half (~RMB 54 million).  Our estimates that actual construction costs are 
much lower than those calculated from PP&E expenditure analysis were corroborated by: a 
manager at one post-IPO farm, construction contractors at one farm presently being built, and 
bidding documents for two other post-IPO farms. 
 
A common method to estimate farm construction costs is to estimate the budget per head. Our 
experts provided estimates of a reasonable construction budget for a 2,500-head milking farm in 
China built according to three quality standards: low, medium, and high.  (The estimated budget 
is shown in Appendix 1). The estimated construction costs per head by standard are as follows: 
 


Low Quality RMB 14,000 / head 
Medium Quality RMB 21,000 / head 


High Quality RMB 30,000 / head 
 


These estimates are company-favorable, as based on a comparison to “show farm” Dengshipu, 
these costs are high.  (By “show farm”, we are referring to the Dengshipu and Bajiazi farms, 
which are built to a markedly higher standard than the other farms our investigators have visited.  
Huishan features these farms in promotional material and on investor tours.32  Dengshipu 
features the best and “most technologically advanced” dairy equipment the Group has inside nice 
physical facilities to create a good impression for visitors. It is very hard to justify that other less 
sophisticated, smaller farms could have the same cost structure.  Dengshipu’s total investment 
according to the environmental impact report and per a placard in the visitor center as of 
September 2016 is RMB 99.9 million.  Its design capacity is 6,590 head, which is twice that of 
the other post-IPO farms. 
 
With our estimate, supported by the Liaoning environmental impact reports, that Huishan is 
reporting spending RMB 90 million to RMB 99 million per 3,000-cow milking farm, the implied 
spending per head is RMB 30,000 to RMB 33,000, while a RMB 64-81 million expenditure for a 
4,000 cow-breeding farm equates to a range of RMB 16,000-20,300/head. 
 
Our experts opined that the construction quality and build out of the post-IPO farms our 
investigators visited was not high end.  The selection and omission of certain features and 
equipment suggested that the farms were still mid-range at best.  Expert A opined that the upper 


                                                
31 To maintain the objectivity of the experts, we did not identify ourselves as Muddy Waters; nor, did we explain our 
suspicions, or provide other documents pertaining to the farms’ total investment figures or valuations.

Page 16 of 47
end estimates for the construction cost for new milking farms was RMB 20,000 per head, (RMB 
60 million for a 3,000-cow farm).  Expert B stated that “from the picture, all I can tell you is that 
these farms are built very cheaply,” and put his maximum expenditure at RMB 30-35 million per 
farm, or about RMB 10,000 to RMB 12,000 per head.  
 
The upper end estimate for non-milking cow farms was RMB 15,000 per head for the best 
among them, while the lower end is at or below 10,000 per head.  In the case of Huishan Jinxing 
Farming in Boyu Shoushan, Expert A opined that with its lack of freestalls, small sheds, and use 
as a youngstock or dry heifer farm (without milking equipment) when at high stocking rates it 
could be as little as just in the single thousands of RMB per head.   
 
Our investigators corroborated that construction 
cost estimates were much lower than our estimate 
of the reported amounts.  In a discussion with a 
deputy farm manager on a newly built Liaoning 
Huishan Dairy Group Woniushi Farming Co. farm 
with a capacity for 3,000 cows, in Lijiapu Village 
we learned that although operational as a “dry 
cow” and “young heifer” farm, it was not yet fully 
operational.  The delivery and installation of its 
milking equipment had been postponed.  As 
satellite imagery from September 2015 showed 
that the farm construction was nearly complete, 
we found this long delay to be surprising.  
 
During our investigation, we found that this was 
not the sole instance of milking farms being built 
out far enough to become “operational,” but halted 
before completing the milking parlor and/or 
installing all of the necessary equipment for 
milking. This finding is significant because it 
implies an even greater delta between the real 
CapEx expenditure on PP&E, and that derived 
from the cash flow analysis.  However, to be 
conservative in our estimates, we did not attempt 
to model this into our calculations.   
 
The finding that the farm was still in a mid-point 
stage of construction prompted further discussion 
about the build out costs.  The farm manager 
broke down the construction costs, excluding land, 
both with and without milking equipment.  According to this farm’s manager, the build out for 
the physical as constructed to date was just RMB 20 million and when all of the equipment 
related to milking, (such as the parlor, cold storage, testing, etc.) was installed and the farm was 
operational as a milking farm the total still came to only about RMB 40 million.  
 


China Dairy Expert Advisor Bio’s: 
Expert A has been engaged in dairy 
operations in China for over 35 years.  
He graduated from an American 
Veterinary College.  He currently 
oversees over 20,000 milking cows 
across a dozen farms.  In a prior 
position, he worked for a major 
foreign dairy operator in China, 
overseeing approximately 15,000 
cows and oversaw dairy farm 
construction.  Over the years, he has 
visited dairy farms of numerous large 
companies and has deep insight into 
Chinese dairy farm management, 
operations, and costs.  
 
Expert B is a Chinese advisor with a 
specialty dairy consultancy. His 
company supports dairy farm 
operators across China that have 
nearly 350,000 cows under 
management, including large herds 
supplying the top bands such as 
Mengniu and Yili. His expertise 
includes farm operations and 
management, and new farm planning 
and development.

If we add about RMB 5.76 million for a pre-paid land lease, the total increases to RMB 45.76 
million, almost identical to the average cost implied in the IPO prospectus’s Use of Proceeds.33  
However, this figure is still less than half of the RMB 96.2 million reported total investment for 
the project reported to the Liaoning Environmental Protection Bureau, and about half our 
estimate for Huishan’s reported average spend.34 
 
Construction workers at a farm in the early stages of construction on the outskirts of Shenyang 
corroborate our estimates of actual construction costs.  The workers confirmed that the site was 
to be a Huishan farm on about 200 mu designed to hold 3,000 cows.  It would contain the office, 
dormitory, cow sheds, production facilities, etc. and from their description would be composed 
of concrete and steel buildings following the post-IPO “standard” design.  Based on their project 
knowledge, the construction cost excluding land and the milking equipment would run about 
RMB 30 million.  Even if adding another RMB 20 million or more for additional dairy 
production related equipment, the total is still close to just half of the typical build costs publicly 
announced in their environmental impact statements.   The expected construction costs are about 
half of our estimate of Huishan’s reported average spend of RMB 89 million. 
 
Bidding Documents 
 
Bidding documents for two post-IPO Huishan farms support our estimates of actual farm 
construction costs.  From time to time Huishan posts invitations for contractors to bid on their 
new construction projects.  The posting from 2014 below is for a 3,000-head dairy farm for 
Liaoning Shiling Farming Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Huishan.35  It is to have a construction area of 
61,000 m2 on a farm of approximately 273,000 m2 (410 mu) which would make it among 
Huishan’s largest farms. The reported construction cost estimate is just RMB 30 million.36 
 
The bidding documents include mention of the exterior walls, the brick, steel, and alloy steel, 
building materials, fire walls, plumbing and waste water drainage systems, ventilation, A/C, 
lighting, fences, cow bed construction, a sedimentation pond, anaerobic reactor, as well as cold 
storage, feeding equipment, disease prevention testing equipment.  The bidding announcement 
also includes a note that, “Due to a wide range of equipment and materials required for the 
project, the requirements are not all listed one by one, and the specifics for the project may 
vary.” 
 


                                                
33 The Prospectus estimated that the land for the 45 dairy farms would require 12.8% of the 34% of the total 
proceeds, equating to RMB 259.4 million for 45 farms, or RMB 5.76 million per farm.  Based a 15-year lease, 250 
mu of land (larger than most of the new farms), RMB 5.76mm equates to RMB 1,533/mu/yr.  This figure appears to 
be quite high, we used it as-is in the estimate.

Another bidding document from this period is for a 4,000-head breeding farm for the then 
Huishan subsidiary Huishan Investments Fuyu Shenyang Farming Co. Ltd.3738 The construction 
area is designed to be 65,000 m2 with an estimated construction cost of RMB 35 million.  As a 
beef cattle farm, it should be designed without milking equipment, making it less expensive to 
construct.  That it is not makes for an interesting anomaly.  Besides adding to the evidence that 
the real farm construction costs were a fraction of that implied by cash flow analysis, this farm 
project is significant as it is among those four transferred to an undisclosed related party who is 
engaged in cattle ranching and the slaughtering, marketing, and sales of beef and veal.

That four such farms were built, but subsequently transferred out of the Group’s control they 
likely do not appear in the total number stating in each reporting period for the number of 
standardized farms that the Company is operating.  However, they partially account for the 
CapEx inflation.  Nevertheless, as seen below, even the four farms totaling RMB 140 million 
will make up only a small portion of the difference in the total CapEx inflation associated with 
new farm construction. 
 
We estimate that in aggregate, Huishan inflated farm CapEx by as much as RMB 1.6 billion. 
 
Of the 32 reported farms started or completed since the IPO, our fieldwork suggests that most 
were built to an updated design. Among them is the larger scale Dengshipu Farm, which is built 
to a more sophisticated design.  We believe its reported construction cost of RMB 99.9 million is 
more likely to be accurate, so we exclude it from the inflation calculation.  A sign at Dengshipu 
also states that its investment was RMB 100 million.  We thus calculate the cost differential for 
just 31 farms, which are built to the new “standard”. The table below summarizes the range of 
estimates and their sources.

Utilizing the upper end of these ranges of cost estimates (RMB 60 million), the construction 
CapEx for the 31 new “standard” farms was inflated by RMB 893 million.  As this is the upper 
limit for the farm cost estimate, RMB 893 million is our low-end estimate for dairy farm CapEx 
inflation.   
 


Page 20 of 47
Dairy Expert B’s estimates were closer to those provided in the construction bidding documents 
of RMB 30-35 million.  Using his high-end estimate and applying it to all 31 farms, the CapEx 
inflation is estimated to be RMB 1.668 billion.  The estimates provided by the Huishan deputy 
farm manager with first-hand knowledge of the farms costs are probably closer to the truth.  
Applying the cost reported by the Huishan deputy farm manager of RMB 40 million per milking 
cow farm and RMB 20 million for a non-milking cow farm at the same land lease cost, the 
estimated total CapEx inflation rises to above RMB 1.668 billion.   
 
As noted in explaining the assumptions regarding our cash flow analysis, we adopted 
conservative assumptions in our estimates when figures were not clearly disclosed, as such the 
real total inflation of dairy farm CapEx may be even greater.

The most likely use for the “diverted” CapEx was that of an accounting gimmick wherein 
Management needed to balance inflated sales (and therefore not existent cash) with inflated 
expenses.   
 
New but Incomplete Farms Raise Further Questions about CapEx Spend 
 
Several instances of incomplete farms again lead us to question the total amount of CapEx 
deployed to-date.  It also suggests that the Company overbuilt in a depressed market and/or is 
facing cash flow problems hindering completion of these projects.

Per discussions our investigators had with workers at Huishan Wufeng Dairy Erdao Hezi, a post-
IPO standard milking farm, construction there began in mid-2014 and halted in 2015.  Like 
Lijiapu, Erdao Hezi is currently housing non-milking cows.  Here too the soft side walls were 
lowered to reduce cross ventilation during the very cold weather that day.  According to one of 
the experts that we consulted, in attempting to maintain heat in this fashion they run the risk of 
raising humidity, ammonia, and pathogen levels with damaging effects.

Huishan Wufeng Dairy (Fuxin) Xintun Farm #2 was also designed to be a 3,000-cow dairy farm.  
Our investigators visited the farm in November 2016 and spoke with employees.  Construction 
started in the middle of 2014 and limited operations began in March 2015.  Onsite staff explained 
that the farm is just engaged in raising calves and had about 2,000 head. The farm is not doing 
any milking because the facilities were incomplete and the equipment had not been installed. 
They expected the farm to begin supplying milk in 2017.

Huishan Chairman Appears to Have Stolen Assets Worth at Least RMB 150 Million 
Through an Undisclosed Related Party Transaction 


 
Through an undisclosed related party transaction, we estimate Huishan Chairman Yang Kai stole 
at least RMB 150 million of assets.  In December 2014 (over one year post-IPO), Huishan 
transferred a subsidiary with at least four cattle farms to a party who is almost certainly a proxy 
for Chairman Yang.  We estimate these farms were worth RMB 150 million, which we based on 
interviews of Muhejia employees and analysis of publicly available documents.  The value of the 
farms was probably higher than our estimate because they likely contained cattle.  
 
We believe Chairman Yang intended to use shareholder funds to pay for construction of beef 
ranches that he would transfer to himself.  Starting in 2011, China’s beef prices rose faster than 
that of milk.  In early 2014, beef prices remained on the ascent even as milk prices collapsed.39 
Demand for Chinese beef peaked as production fell short of demand.40  For an owner of large-
scale dairy farm with calves and heifers to spare, this was certainly great news and a good 
opportunity.  We learned from interviews this fall with employees of Muhejia, a cattle ranching 
company owned by the Chairman Yang Kai, that since at least 2013 a plan had been in place for 
the company to move into the slaughtering and beef sales and distribution business.41

Chairman Yang and his wife own Liaoning Muhejia Livestock and Technology Co. Ltd. 
(“Muhejia”).42  As explained next, Muhejia used a proxy to take at least four farms from 
Huishan.  Muhejia has had five names in two years, which we believe is an attempt to conceal 
this (and possibly other) improper transaction.  This table shows the strangely frequent re-
naming of Muhejia:

Huishan’s disclosures about Liaoning Muhejia refer to it by an informal English name, Liaoning 
Ainyveal, which we also believe is an attempt to obscure.43    
 
F.U. with FuYu 
 
Huishan transferred the Fuyu farms to Muhejia, an entity controlled by Yang Kai. The following 
timeline lays out the key events: 
 


• April 11, 2014: Huishan establishes Huishan Investment Fuyu Shenyang Farming 
Company (“Fuyu”) for “dairy farming business”.44  (As we explain below, it seems likely 


                                                
43 Huishan Group, however, disclosed a business agreement with Liaoning Ainyveal as a connected party transaction 
with Chairman Yang Kai in September 2015.  (See http://www.Huishandairy.com/Investor/EN_20150926.pdf )  To 
confound matters further, Huishan’s 2016 annual report continues to refer to Liaoning Ainyveal, with Kai and his 
spouse indirectly owning 66.7%, even though its name has changed three times since then.  (See 
http://www.Huishandairy.com/Investor/EN_20150926.pdf and Huishan FY16 AR, p.68)

this subsidiary was always intended to be used for beef ranching, rather than dairy 
farming.) 


• May 2014 through December 2014: Government records show that between May 2014 
and the transfer, Fuyu had completed construction of at least four cattle farms.   


• 23 December 2014: Transfer of Fuyu shares from Huishan Dairy (China) Co., Ltd. 
(formerly named Huishan Investment Co., Ltd) to newly-formed entity Liaoning Fuhan 
Farming Company Ltd., controlled and 100%-owned by an individual named Wang 
Bing.4546  Huishan’s FY15 financial reports disclose no consideration received for the 
disposal of subsidiaries.47  Wang and Fuhan Farming are almost certainly proxies for 
Muhejia and Chairman Yang.  We estimate the value of the assets transferred was at least 
RMB 150 million.  It is likely that the transferred farms included cattle, which would 
increase the value of transfer. 
 


Huishan formed Fuyu on April 11, 2014.48 
 


 
 
Government records show that Fuyu had completed construction of at least four beef ranches by 
the time of the transfer on December 23, 2014.   
 
A 2015 report by the Liaoning City Village Committee for Agricultural and Animal Husbandry 
Economy affairs lists fourteen Huishan Group standard farms that applied for subsidies.49  
Among them are four Fuyu farms with dates of construction listed as May through December 
2014.  The announcement reads: 
 


“Notice of Public Announcement of the List of Qualified Standardized Livestock Farm 
Projects by the Huishan Dairy Group in Shenyang City in 2015 


 
Based on material examination, field investigation, project inspection and acceptance of 
the Huishan Dairy Group's standardized livestock farms, the list of qualified projects of 
14 standardized livestock farms of Huishan Dairy Group in 2015 were determined by 
districts and counties (cities) List, is to be made public for review by the community. It 
shall be publicly available for 7 days (December 24 to December 30, 2015). During the 
public period, if there is discovery of problems, you can phone or submit a form to the 


                                                
45 On January 29, 2015, Huishan Investment Fuyu Shenyang Farming Company changed its name to Shenyang Fuyu 
Farming Company Ltd.; added breeding to scope of operations; appointed Wang Bing as legal representative, 
Executive Director and General Manager. 
46 SAIC records show: sole ownership of Fuyu by Liaoning Fuhan; Wang Bing owning 5% of Fuhan Farming 
directly, and 95% indirectly through Liaoning Younong Investment Company Ltd.

Below is the original in Chinese, showing that four Fuyu farms were completed by the time of 
the transfer: 
 


 
 
Note that the announcement states that these farms were designed for beef ranching, which 
strongly suggests that the farms were never intended to be operated by Huishan, and that the plan 
all along had been to use Huishan investors’ money to build beef cattle ranches for Chairman 
Yang.  Additionally, a public bidding announcement, updated in August 2014, provides some 
details on the construction project for one of Fuyu’s cattle farms and states that the farm is 
designed for cattle meat (beef), not dairy or breeding.50   


Huishan transferred Fuyu on December 23, 2014.

Wang and Fuhan Farming are almost certainly proxies for Muhejia and Chairman Yang.   
 
SAIC files show that Fuyu is controlled by Muhejia.  Our fieldwork confirmed that Muhejia 
controls the Fuyu farms.  A blog promoting Muhejia beef shows that Fuyu is a Muhejia farm.  
The Shenyang government announcement showing Fuyu’s farm construction timelines uses the 
same phone number for both Fuyu and Huishan – despite the announcement having been 
published one year after the transfer and reflecting Wang Bing as Fuyu’s Legal Representative.  
This indicates Fuyu is still under Chairman Yang’s control, despite Huishan having no 
ownership.   


SAIC files show that Fuyu is controlled by Muhejia.  SAIC files list the contact for Fuyu as 
yingcun.sha@muhejiagroup.com.  The telephone numbers 88084909 and 88084919 are Muhejia 
phone numbers; one is also shared with Huabao Investments, a Yang Kai-owned company 
invested in Muhejia,51 and the other used for some Huishan Farms.52 
 





Our fieldwork confirmed that Muhejia owns Fuyu farms.  Our investigators met with a Muhejia 
salesman who knew Wang Bing.  The salesman confirmed he is involved with Muhejia’s 
upstream cattle ranch operations and that Yang Kai was still the big boss.  When visiting the

Fuyu farms, we found the farm gates to be uncharacteristically without signage.  Upon inquiry, 
we learned that the workers believed that the farms belonged to Huishan with them being just 
another division, albeit one raising cattle for beef as opposed to dairy cows for milk.  On one 
Fuyu farm, the gate guard repeatedly confirmed that the farm was Huishan’s and built by 
Huishan, but also acknowledged that Muhejia owned the farm.  This guard subsequently assisted 
our researchers to call the farm manager who then confirmed the farm was indeed Fuyu. 
 
A blog promoting Muhejia beef shows that it owns Fuyu farms.  The following blog identifies 
Fuyu Cattle Farm as part of the Muhejia group.53 








 
We estimate the value of the assets transferred was at least RMB 150 million.   
 
We calculate the value of the infrastructure of the four farms transferred from Huishan to 
Muhejia to be RMB 150 million. According to an online construction cost estimate, the 
estimated project cost for a single farm was RMB 35 million (excluding the cost of obtaining the 
cows).54   


                                                
53 http://www.9500w.cn/page/wtt_wzaobao_com/p/22dcBb2.html , subsequent post identifies the address for one of 
Fuyu’s four farms: Fuyu Fuyu as well.  
54 http://p.tgnet.com/SYHSTZ1/  


Page 28 of 47
As four Fuyu farms were transferred, the construction cost alone imputes a time and materials 
value of RMB 140 million.  Including additional soft costs and considering the value of the 
whole exceeding that of the parts, the implied value would exceed RMB 150 million. 


At the end of 2014, Fuyu’s total assets were reported as RMB 150.4 million, with RMB 121.2 
million in liabilities, leaving owner’s equity of capital as RMB 29.2 million.  The Huishan FY15 
AR does not record any disposal of subsidiaries.  We highly doubt that an improper undisclosed 
transaction of this nature would be accompanied by a proper reassignment of loans and other 
liabilities.  Based on the SAIC annual report from 2014, the likely loss to Huishan resulting from 
this undisclosed asset transfer is at least the total asset value, or RMB 150.4 million.   
 
Huishan likely also transferred cattle, which would have made the theft even larger.  While 
Fuyu’s scope of operations was not updated to include breeding until late January 2015, a search 
of the National Breeder’s license registry revealed that on December 9, 2014 Fuyu received its 
breeding permit.55   
 
 


 
 
In 2015, Fuyu applied for a “large scale cattle ranching enterprise subsidy”, declaring that two 
farms had more than 1,200 head per farm and a third had 510 head.56  Breeding records show 
that cows belonging to Fuyu were impregnated beginning on January 7, 2015, just 14 days after 
the transfer.  By the time of the official company name change and reappointment of senior 
management was completed on January 29, 2015, breeding records list 151 cows aged 14 to 31

months as being impregnated, suggesting these cows were already on the farm in late December, 
thus predating the transfer.57   
 


Huishan’s Liquidity Appears to be on the Knife’s Edge, it has Dubious Assets, and its 
Reported 1H17 Cash Flow is Almost Certainly Fraudulent 


 
Even if Huishan’s financials were not fraudulent, the company appears to be on knife’s edge due 
to its excessive leverage.  The leverage is so substantial that in FY16, Huishan’s auditor appears 
to have stopped just short of issuing a “going concern” qualification.  Given that we conclude 
that its reported profits are fraudulent, we have no confidence that Huishan can make it through 
the next year without defaulting.  There are numerous signs of enormous financial stress, 
including the types of financing Huishan is trying to employ, unfinished projects, and even 
taking Huishan’s financials at face value, horrendous credit metrics.   
 
The asset side of Huishan’s balance sheet, in our opinion, is massively overstated due to 
fraudulent profits and cash, overvalued biological assets (which are fair valued as Level 3 
assets), and certain highly suspicious asset accounts.   
 
We believe Huishan is in very real danger of defaulting in the next year. 
 
Huishan’s auditor obviously has not concluded that Huishan’s that financials are fraudulent; yet, 
it appeared to stop just short of issuing a going concern qualification in its FY16 audit.  Even 
taking Huishan’s financials at face value, its credit metrics are well into the “red zone”.  In our 
opinion, Huishan has a high chance of defaulting in the next year due to its massive short-term 
debt.  Huishan is resorting to creative financing that we believe shows its desperation.  Huishan’s 
incomplete projects show it is financially stressed – construction on its RMB 6.8 billion Xifeng 
liquid milk plant had been stopped when our investigators visited in July 2016; and, instead of 
finding a RMB 8.8 billion liquid milk facility in the Kangping Development Zone in Liaoning, 
all we found were some cow statues. 
 
Huishan’s auditor appears to telling investors the company is on knife’s edge. 
 
KPMG, Huishan’s auditor, appears to have been very close to issuing a “going concern” 
qualification in its FY16 audit.  (The auditor obviously is not considering fraudulent financials in 
its assessment.)  Our interpretation of the below disclosure in the notes to the financials is that 
KPMG only avoided issuing a formal going concern qualification based on assurances from 
Huishan’s directors.  The assurance centers around supposedly having “unconditional banking 
facilities” of RMB 11.2 billion.  The disclosure reads as follows: 


 
“These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
notwithstanding the net current liabilities as at March 31, 2016 because the directors of 
the Company are of the opinion that based on the unconditional banking facilities of 
RMB 11,231,622,000 not yet utilised by the Group as of the date of issue of these 
consolidated financial statements, the Group would have adequate funds to meet its 
liabilities as and when they fall due at least twelve months from the end of the reporting

Page 30 of 47
period. Accordingly, the directors of the Company consider it is appropriate to prepare 
the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.”58 
 


Even more alarming is its 1H17 interim report, wherein Management reported this credit facility 
declined to just RMB 5.0 billion, implying that if this liquidity pool is real, it had been drained 
by more than half.59 
 
Even taking Huishan’s financials at face value, its credit metrics are well into the “red zone”. 
 
Other eye-popping Huishan credit metrics (taking its financials at face value) include: 
 


• Net interest finance cost increased by almost 3x from RMB 205.7 million in 2014 to 
RMB 322.8 million in 2015 and RMB 681million in 2016.606162 As of September 2016, 
finance costs were up to RMB 451.3 million for the first half of the 2017 fiscal year.63 


 
• In 2016, bank charges and other finance costs increased 3x from RMB 10.4 million in 


2015 to RMB 37.5 million in 2016.64 For the six months ending September 30, 2016, 
these costs were a staggering RMB 53.8 million.65 There is no footnote to explains what 
these “other finance costs” are.  


 
• Bank deposits to secure bills payable increased +300% year-on-year (RMB 946 million 


in 2016, up from RMB 314 million in 2015).66 As of September 30, 2016, these deposits 
stood at RMB 962.6 million.67 Huishan has shed no light on what these payables are. 


 
• Another potential finance lease agreement for the sale of unspecified property, plants and 


equipment for a consideration up to RMB 300 million and a lease back rate of 5%.68 
 
Huishan has a high chance of defaulting in the next year due to its massive short-term debt. 
 
With 70% of the company’s debt coming due in less than a year and a limited free cash flow 
profile, Huishan’s debt profile presents a very high risk of a near term default.  (This assessment 
is without considering our conclusion the company is a fraud.)  Huishan will need to somehow 
address RMB 11.1 billion coming due within a year.69   
 
Serious questions arise with the company’s recent cow sale lease back attempts significant recent 
increase in short-term borrowings.  The cow sale and leaseback attempts and drawdowns on its

loan facilities imply that Huishan is concerned about its near-term liquidity and looming near-
term debt maturity.  88% of Huishan’s debt is already secured or guaranteed by PP&E, leases 
and equity.  The ability for the company to offer up additional collateral at this stage is highly 
questionable – particularly given our conclusion that PP&E has been greatly inflated.  The 
company has also announced that it is exploring listing some assets in mainland China.7071  We 
see this as more evidence that it is running out of traditional ways to access capital, and is 
looking to less sophisticated investors to keep the company from collapsing.   
 
The company has found ways to get short-term loans from banks to shore up short-term cash 
needs.  Huishan’s CFO has been talking about extending the maturities on Huishan’s loans; 
however, debt due within one year has spiked 55.4% in 1H17 to RMB 11.1 billion.72  
 
The graph below shows a huge increase in short-term debt borrowings for Huishan over the past 
three years.   
 





 
We find the below statement from the 1H17 interim results puzzling because the auditor 
indicated the only reason it did not issue a going concern qualification was the supposed 
availability of RMB 11.2 billion in borrowing capacity.73  However, six months later, Huishan 
has significantly less borrowing capacity and RMB 11.1 billion debt coming due within a year.74  
This statement seems unduly blasé about whether investors should be worried about Huishan as a 
going concern:75 
   


“These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis notwithstanding the net current liabilities as at September 30, 2016

issue of this interim financial report, the Group would have adequate funds to meet its 
liabilities as and when they fall due at least twelve months from the end of the reporting 
period. ”   
 


This undrawn facility amount has decreased RMB 6.25 billion over the last six months to RMB 
4.98 billion, which is somewhat alarming since the company supposedly generated free cash 
flow in that same time.   
 
As can be seen from the company’s latest interim results, the debt guaranteed by intra-group 
entities spiked by 27.8% in 1H17 to RMB 11.0 billion.  The company should explain why this 
line item has increased so much, and provide details of the covenants and which entities are 
guaranteeing these loans.  








Page 33 of 47
Using low end consensus forward EBITDA of ~ RMB 1.6 billion, Huishan is levered 10.0x with 
RMB 16.0 billion of debt.76   These leverage ratio numbers are equivalent to distressed leverage 
ratios.  Because we believe Huishan’s EBITDA is largely (if not entirely fraudulent), we see the 
real leverage ratio as greatly higher.

Huishan is resorting to creative financing that we believe shows its desperation. 
 
In May, we jokingly suggested on Twitter that Huishan’s announced cow sale and leaseback 
transaction with Guangdong Yuexin Finance Lease Co. Ltd, should be considered for the year’s 
most humorous transaction award.77  In the end, it appears Guangdong Yuexin didn’t like being 
the punch line.  On November 27, 2016, just two days before the release of its 1H17 interim 
results, Management announced that it was “reformulating its plans with respect to finance lease 
arrangements” because the 50,000-cow sale lease-back for RMB 1 billion with Yuexin “lapsed” 
and never took effect.78  If Guangdong Yuexin’s due diligence turned up anything similar to ours, 
that outcome is easy to understand.   
 
The November 27 bulletin announced a new counter party to the sale and leaseback, but on a 
smaller scale, with slightly higher ratio of collateral required: 40,000 cows for RMB 750,000 
million, and at the same 6.2% interest rate.  At the time of the original announcement, analysts 
speculated that this sale and leaseback was intended to raise funds intended for additional share 
buybacks.79  However, the original high-profile nature of the original cow leaseback and the 
timing of the new announcement, imply that the Company knows it cannot afford the fallout if

the new deal fails.  Its short-term debt financing requirements are pressing and lack of 
confidence could constrain or undermine its ability to roll over debt.  Were the cow sale 
leaseback transaction to fail, it would could put Huishan’s entire capital structure at risk. 
 
Milking assets: More sales and leasebacks. 
 
These “cows for cash” plans are not the Company’s only sales and leasebacks. Two plant and 
equipment sales and leasebacks were on the books at the end of FY16 for over RMB 541 million.  
Huishan added RMB 146 million of sales and leaseback of PP&E and dairy cows80 in 1H17, for 
a total of RMB 687 million payable in full within three years.8182   Additionally, a new sale and 
leaseback for RMB 300 million for PP&E was announced on December 8, 2016 with JIC 
(Tianjin) Leasing Co., Ltd. bringing the total (ex-cows) to six sales and leasebacks involving 
four financing companies for nearly RMB 1 billion plant and equipment.83  Adding in the RMB 
750 million replacement transaction for the cows, the total value of assets liquidated comes to 
RMB 1.7 billion.  These transactions provide immediate cash infusions, but come with additional 
medium-term obligations.  
 
Incremental “innovation”: Huishan plans to issue a high interest WMP.  
 
In late June 2016, Huishan’s Executive Director, Ge Kun, stated that the Company would further 
consider “innovative financing tools” like the cow sales and lease back.84  Just two weeks later, 
the story of a new financing innovation for Huishan emerged in the Chinese news.  The 
Company would be working with Zhejiang Internet Finance Trade Center Holding Co. Ltd. to 
raise short-term funds through the sale of WMPs to high net worth individuals.  The Zhejiang 
Internet Finance Trade Center Holding Co. Ltd was to be responsible for marketing the product, 
and Huishan for issuing the credit guarantee.  The tenor was slated to be only 183-days while 
paying an annual interest rate of 7.2%.85   
 
A Huishan Dairy official involved in the deal tried to put a positive spin on this extremely costly 
financing, “This will be our first serious effort to interact with East China’s high-end 
investors,”86 adding that these investors were more financially savvy.  Outside of the news story, 
no formal announcement has been made by the Company regarding this offering.  However, if 
these East China investors are really savvy this WMP will be a tough sell.

Collateral and equity squeeze portend calamity. 
 
Huishan faces a collateral and equity squeeze that is extremely dangerous.  The company’s RMB 
15.3 billion in bank loans, nearly RMB 11 billion of which come due in September 2017, exceed 
equity by 18.6% as of September 30, 2016.87   
 
Construction stopped on the RMB 6.8 billion Xifeng liquid milk plant. 
 
Huishan Dairy (Xifeng) Co., Ltd’s liquid milk investment project is in Xifeng.  Our researchers 
found the site essentially abandoned with construction half complete. A security guard onsite 
explained that the construction had been going on for approximately two years but had ground to 
a halt in 2015. The guard did not have details as to why, but stated that Xifeng Dairy was not 
hiring.   
 
Information panels onsite describe the scope of the project.  The total investment for the Xifeng 
project was to reach RMB 6.8 billion, RMB 900 million of which had already been made.  The 
project was to consist of 21 cow farms, a dairy processing factory with liquid milk production 
capacity of 300 tons per day, and biogas power and fertilizer facilities.  The plans for the Xifeng 
factory call for it to eventually cover a total area of land of 265,690.5 m2 (about 400 mu).   
 
A Tieling city government announcement regarding the project provided details that varied 
slightly from those posted on location.  The processing plant and farms were two separate 
projects.  The Huishan Xifeng project commenced in May 2014 and was to be completed by 
October 2015.  The dairy-processing project is to cover 27 hectares of land with an investment of 
RMB 1.37 billion.88  A construction project database contains information as of April 5, 2016, 
stating that main construction is ongoing.89  Our researchers spoke with an employee of the 
Huishan project office at the Xifeng Industrial Zone Management Committee who confirmed 
that construction was not complete but also did not know a new timeline for completion. 
 
The 2015 SAIC file reported that Huishan Dairy (Xifeng) Co. had registered capital of RMB 100 
million, total assets of RMB 203.7 million, total liabilities of RMB 106.4 million, owner’s equity 
of RMB 97.3 million, and losses of RMB 2.3 million. 
 
Huishan RMB 8.8 billion liquid milk plant investment in Kangping: Nothing but cow statues 
 
Huishan claims to have a liquid milk products production facility called Huishan Investment 
(Shenyang) Dairy Co. Ltd. in the Kangping Development Zone in Kangping County, Liaoning. 
Our investigators visited the development zone in July 2016 and found no operational factory or 
construction site under the name of Huishan – only a group of cow statues, that we can only 
guess was intended as a kind of public relations feature.

A media report from June 2014 claims that Huishan launched its dairy industry cluster in 
December 2013 and that, like Xifeng and Fuxin, it would consist of dairy processing factories, 
farms and related facilities that cover the whole value chain of dairy production.  Total 
investment would be RMB 8.8 billion with an estimated completion in 2016.  The report does 
not mention the timeline for constructions of the dairy processing factory in the Kangping 
Development Zone.90  The magistrate of Kangping County visited the Kangping dairy processing 
factory project and inspected the construction progress, indicating that the project was not 
finished then.91 
 
According to a public bidding notice, Huishan invited proposals for the power engineering and 
construction of “Huishan Dairy’s project in Kangping.”  The proposed construction period is 
listed as December 1 to December 31, 2014.92  A March 2016 Kangping County Investment 
Bureau report on 26 major investment projects includes Huishan’s Kangping dairy industry 
cluster as one of the key construction projects for 2016, but does not provide any details on a 
timeline.93  Additional media searches and field observations found no evidence of a construction 
site in Kangping Development Zone of this project’s scale, leading us to conclude that 
processing facilities to make up the core of this dairy cluster have undergone only preliminary 
stage development at best.

We Believe Huishan’s Asset Accounts are Massively Overstated 
 
In addition to what could be a cow farm PP&E overstatement as large as RMB 1.6 billion, we 
have substantial concerns about other asset accounts.  Even forgetting the evidence of fraudulent 
profits, Huishan’s cash balance is highly suspicious due to the company’s nonsensical capital 
structure.  Huishan’s inventory presents a significant red flag.  We strongly doubt Huishan’s 
reported raw material prepayment balances.  Huishan appears to be hiding a RMB 1.5 fair value 
loss on biological assets (cattle).   
 
Huishan’s cash balance is highly suspect – even forgetting that its profits are fraudulent. 
 
Huishan’s recent capital market activity supports our view that the company is a fraud – 
particularly considering its strong reported 1H17 cash flow.  In our experience, one of the most 
common signs a company is forging its cash balances is borrowing more money than it 
seemingly needs to, and at rates higher than what it earns on its cash.  Huishan fits this profile.  It 
reported cash and short-term investments of RMB 9.8 billion in 1H17, up from RMB 4.1 billion 
as of FY16.94  From March 31, 2016 through September 30, 2016, Huishan reports operating 
cash flow of RMB 3.1 billion and levered free cash flow of RMB 2.7 billion.95   
 
Despite these strong results, Huishan is borrowing at rates far higher than it purports to receive 
on its cash and short-term investments.  In early 2016, Huishan invested RMB 845 million in 
WMPs at 3.2% to 3.8%, but then in April 2016 attempted to secure RMB 1 billion through a 
dairy cattle sale and leaseback scheme at 6.2%.9697  After the initial cow sale and lease back fell 
through, the company announced a new replacement RMB 750 million sale and leaseback 
agreement at the same interest rate.98  According to a newspaper report, Huishan is planning the 
sale of its own WMP at an annual rate of 7.2% for 183-day paper.99100   
 
Huishan’s inventory presents a significant red flag. 
 
Huishan reported a big blow out in inventory of “semi-finished and finished goods” in FY2016, 
more than doubling from RMB 463 million in 2015 to RMB 987 million in 2016.101  In 2014, it 
was only RMB 189.7 million.102  While the company does not provide insight into such 
inventories in its FY17 interim report, it does cite the “exceptional” case of sales of 13,484 tons 
of dairy ingredients (whole milk powder) for over RMB 171.4 million.103  It appears then that the 
inventory blowout of prior years was in part because Huishan converted raw milk it couldn’t sell 
into whole milk powder.  As the shelf life for whole milk powder is limited and the company

notes that further sales are not sustainable, it seems to us that the inventory should be written 
down. 
 
Another inventory-related oddity is the fact that Huishan claimed no raw milk balances at year-
end of FY13 and FY14.104  Huishan has not mentioned raw milk balances in its filings since then.  
We believe this is a lie, albeit a strange and unnecessary one, possibly propagated to portray the 
company as highly efficient.  In its prospectus, Huishan asserts that it “ha[s] always sold or 
consumed [its] raw milk at the day of milking.”105 
 
Given that dairy farm and milking operations are continuous, and our research indicates that raw 
milk pickups typically occur at most twice a day, there could be as much as one-half day of 
output in cold storage at a farm on any given day.  In FY14, for example, this would have 
amounted to as many as 500 tons of raw milk worth RMB 2.5 million.  While this is not a 
material amount, it does point to the company’s propensity to mislead investors on its operations 
and its financial reality. 
 
Huishan’s prepayments for raw materials are highly suspicious, and add to our extreme 
skepticism about the value of the company’s assets. 
 
Huishan is making huge prepayments for unspecified raw materials, which given the company’s 
stretched financial position, does not make sense.  Therefore, we find this account highly 
suspicious.  Prepayments for purchase of raw materials increased 545% year-on-year (RMB 1.56 
billion as of FY16, up from RMB 242 million as of FY15). 106  As of September 30, 2016, the 
number came down to RMB 493 million.107  We are at a loss to explain what raw materials 
Huishan would be buying. To put things in perspective, RMB 1 billion would buy: 
 


• Enough imported alfalfa to feed all Huishan’s milkable cows a standard ration (not the 
current reduced ration) for over three years,108 


• Building materials to construct over 50 new farms,109 


                                                
104 As at March 31, 2014, the Group did not have any unsold or unused raw milk but had RMB156.13 million 
harvested but unused alfalfa grass and other feed crops with a respective gain of RMB86.51 million recognised upon 
harvest (March 31, 2013: RMB22.61 million harvested but unused alfalfa grass, which have been used up in the year 
ended March 31, 2014 with the respective gain of RMB18.26 million charged to the cost of sales for the year ended 
March 31, 2014). 


--2014 AR, p.88 
As at March 31, 2011 and 2012, the Group did not have any milked or harvested but unsold or unused raw milk or 
alfalfa grass. As at March 31, 2013, the Group did not have any unsold or unused raw milk but had RMB22.6 
million harvested but unused alfalfa grass.

During our fieldwork, we did not see or hear of purchases at this scale taking place. We think the 
likeliest explanation is that this line item absorbs much of the fake cash that Huishan generates. 
 
In our opinion, Huishan is hiding an approximately RMB 1.5 billion fair value loss on its 
biological assets. 
 
We believe that by reporting its internal raw milk sales price was 14% higher than the external 
sales price in 1H17, Huishan is hiding an approximately RMB 1.5 billion loss on the fair value of 
its milkable cows. In the past, the price difference has not been greater than 1% through FY15.111  
Huishan’s claimed significant spike in realized raw milk prices seems to us completely 
unwarranted. 
 


 
Source: Huishan 2016/2017 Interim Results Presentation, p. 19 
 
The dramatic increase in average selling price is due to the higher relative price of milk sold 
internally.  In other words, the internal sales price is much higher than that of the external 
(market) price. By inflating future cash flow expectations built into its Level 3 valuation model, 
Huishan can maintain the fair value of its milkable cows and hide a massive loss.

111 In FY16, Huishan apparently began to use an inflated yield number in its fair value calculation: Huishan used a 
yield rate range of 8.9 to 9.6 in its fair value calculation while the actual claimed yield rate was only 8.6. 


Page 40 of 47
Huishan shows the various components it uses for fair value calculation—lactation period, raw 
milk ASP, yield rate, culling rate—in its prospectus and annual reports.112113  Although the yield 
rate and the raw milk price dropped significantly since FY2015, Huishan reported increasing fair 
value.  
 
Management has consistently reported initiatives to reduce their feed costs to sustain margin on 
raw milk, which we question in section in this report.  As the impact of the feed cost adjustments 
are reducing yields, the marginal impact on profit is negative, so the impact on the fair value is 
negative.114  
 
The Company previously reported an organic growth rate of 10%.  As the total herd size reported 
a first ever decline in 1H17, we conclude that a dramatically increased rate of culling (perhaps 2x 
the historical rate) should be a major factor reducing the herd’s valuation.

Huishan’s expectation of rising prices appears to be at odds with that of their competitor Yili, 
which is also its largest external customer for raw milk.115116  According to Yili’s 1H 2016 results 
call at the end of August 2016, the Yili’s management did not yet see the turning point in milk 
prices, and even considered some minor declines still possible:117

dairy product enterprises” at a higher price as evidence of that.

Q: The speed with which low milk producing cows was taken off, did the speed of cutting excess capacity lead to a turning point in the domestic price (of raw milk)? Has that point already 
arrived, or when it will be reached? Is there any reliable data? 
  
A: The up-stream farms are under a lot of pressure. It won’t continue to incrementally worsen the future, but may still slightly decline. Next year will be better, but it won’t be an obvious turn 
around. Capacity cuts are part of the push to improve the upstream development process and increase the production per head, eliminating low production cows, and improving production 
efficiency. Many entities invested in dairy farms from 2012 to 2014, these investments were quite large, resulting in an excess of dairy cows. 
  
The overall production capacity did not decline, but the number of cows decreased. 
 


We believe Huishan should take a fair value loss on its milkable cow herd because their income 
dropped due to the lower yield rate and raw milk price.  Holding other factors constant, the drop 
of income from each milkable cow would reduce the future cash flow directly.  The average 
revenue per milkable cow declined from FY15, the last period in which the selected production 
yield rate is within the range used for fair value calculated.  There is a 34% drop in the annual 
income associated with milkable cows.  Thus, there should also be a corresponding decline in the 
fair value of a milkable cow.118  Based on a fair value reduction of 38% (Table 4), we calculate 
the fair value loss is RMB 1.5 billion (Table 5).

Large Probable Share Pledges Present Substantial Risk to Equity Holders 
 
We believe that a substantial amount of Huishan’s shares are pledged to lenders.  If we are 
correct, this presents a risk to long holders because the borrower(s) could have their positions 
liquidated in a disorderly fashion if they are unable to meet a margin call.   
 
We analyzed date from Hong Kong’s Central Clearing and Automated Settlement System 
(“CCASS”), which houses data for all settled trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that 
indicate large numbers of Huishan shares have been pledged, most likely as collateral for 
personal loans.  CCAS data includes the date the holding last changed, the holdings of each 
participant across the market, the net daily movements of holdings in each stock and of holdings 
by each participant, as well as the time series of holdings by one participant in one stock.  In the 
case of brokers, this gives one a clearer idea of what stocks they deal in most, and if one has a 
margin account, what the pool of collateral might include.  This collateral pool is often pledged 
to lenders, and if its value falls suddenly then it can trigger a brokerage collapse. 
 
Types of CCASS Participants are brokers, custodians, pledgees, clearing houses and Investor 
Participants (IPs). The CCASS IDs of brokers are prefixed "B".  Broker participants may also be 
pledgees, and custodians may hold pledged stock.  Except for investor participants, CCASS 
Participants may or may not have beneficial interests in the shares they hold in CCASS, so it 
can’t be used as a guide to beneficial ownership. 
 
We see that an increasing number of Huishan shares were moved into CCASS from September 
2013 through August 2016: 
 





Page 44 of 47
While the CCASS data is inconclusive as to the exact number of shares pledged the significant 
movement of shares into the CCASS clearing system gives a strong indication that a significant 
amount of Huishan shares is pledged.
