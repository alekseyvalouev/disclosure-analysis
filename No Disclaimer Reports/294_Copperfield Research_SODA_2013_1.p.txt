SODA - Doing
Some Work Here
Jul. 31, 2013 10:40 AM ET1 comment | Includes: GMCR, Sâ€¦


here were our Tweets earlier (we are new to Twitter).


more work is needed, but something is very wrong with management's story
on growth.... our early suspicion is that the purchase of the Italian disti
accounts for the entire 2H'13 boost to guidance and management MAY have
misrepresented the level of sales from the disti when declaring "zero"
revenues in Q2 an only $2M in 2H'13 sales. They also blamed the inventory
spike on this purchase ($10M), which would imply @ a 54% GM ~ $21.8M of
embedded sales. So 1) this disti has ~ 5 years of inventory (at the $4m
runrate mgmt stated on the call), 2) organic SODA inventories are much
higher than disclosed, or 3) they are lying about the revenue runrate of the
Italian disti to overstate organic growth.... much more work to do here - our
interest is piqued as no sellsider has pressed these issues yet:

@herbgreenberg will do much more work, but not first time we see.
Nordic disti same issue when bought, looking into Czech disti too $SODA

@herbgreenberg $SODA - Debt up QoQ 8M, Cash down QoQ 28M - begs
question what did they pay for only "4M run rate revs"... #smellsbad

Copperfield Research  @CopperfieldRscr11m
@herbgreenberg $SODA files annual 20F so no way to check numbers on
Italian disti. But 10M of inv, and only 2M sales (900K inv cogs) in 2H?
