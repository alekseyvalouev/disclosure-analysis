Short-seller Chanos: Moody's, S&P wrong on China


Katya Wachtel


NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager James Chanos, who has been a long-time skeptic
on the Chinese growth story, is sticking with his gloomy view of ratings agencies Moody’s Corp
(MCO.N) and Standard and Poor’s, saying their rosy outlook on China’s debt only bolsters his
bearish bet.

5/21/2018 Short-seller Chanos: Moody's, S&P wrong on China

The famed short-seller said he’s puzzled by the readiness of S&P, a division of McGraw-Hill
Companies Inc MHP.N, to downgrade the sovereign debt of countries like the United States
and much of Europe while continuing to give a nod of approval to China and its banks.


“The rating agencies are getting this one really wrong,” Chanos, the founder and president of
hedge fund Kynikos Associates, told the Reuters 2012 Investment Outlook Summit.


S&P earlier on Tuesday affirmed its long-term rating on China’s sovereign debt at AA-minus,
just one day after it threatened to downgrade 15 countries in the troubled euro zone, including
that of Germany, Europe’s biggest economy.


Moody’s rates China at Aa3, with a positive outlook.


For at least a year now, Kynikos, with $6 billion under management, has been shorting shares
of Moody’s Investor Services and S&P parent McGraw-Hill.


Chanos, who specializes in making money when stocks fall in value, said China’s housing
bubble and opaque political and economic systems merit greater scrutiny and cynicism by the
rating agencies.


He is shorting mining companies and construction companies that ship raw materials to China
and is also betting against shares of some Chinese banks.


Short sellers make money by borrowing stocks in the hope that the price will decline, allowing
them to buy the shares at a lower price and pocket the difference.


Chanos, who founded Kynikos in 1985 with $16 million, gained famed on Wall Street after his
prescient call on accounting fraud at Enron a decade ago.

Since then, his most well-known target has been China, whose economy he says will eventually
crash, driven by an unsustainable real estate bubble.


“It is already happening,” Chanos said, citing what he said is a drop in new apartment sales
across the country of about 40 percent year-on-year. “Everybody is admitting transaction
volumes have plummeted. This is what we saw in places like Las Vegas and Florida before the
crash; transactions just stopped.”


“We are short anyone involved in the China real estate boom,” he added.

Recently, Chanos has been focused on China’s banks, which he says have made and continue
to make billions in risky loans without sufficient capital.


Kynikos is short shares of the Agricultural Bank of China (601288.SS), the country’s largest
county lender.


OUTSIDE CHINA


The European banks have not escaped Chanos’ glare, either. He has been short a number of
European banks since the beginning of the year - before several nations enacted bans on short
selling.


“The biggest commercial lenders in Europe are pretty much all in our portfolio,” Chanos said,
noting his skepticism that austerity measures will solve the debt crisis.


He has a more positive view, however, on the U.S. banking sector.


American banks “are not lending and their cost structures are still too high but that is not a
death knell,” Chanos said, although he is still noted caution. He is staying away from any U.S.
banks with exposure to potentially vast mortgage write-downs. And while Kynikos is long
Citigroup (C.N), Chanos emphasized that bet is a hedge against his short position on Chinese
and European lenders.


The U.S. housing market isn’t the only one that gives Chanos jitters. He recently visited
Australia, where he was “stunned” at urban real estate prices. The housing market, in addition
to the country’s reliance on China to keep its economy afloat, is worrying, he said. Kynikos is
short Australian miners.


“Australia has tied itself to the tiger’s tail - I don’t think that’s a great place to be,” Chanos
said.


“But it is a lovely place to visit,” he added. “I might go back for New Year’s.”

German companies worry Trump moving toward 'America
Alone'


Reuters Staff


BERLIN (Reuters) - German companies are concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump is
increasingly thinking only of America rather than just putting his country first, the head of
Germany’s DIHK Chambers of Commerce told media.

The United States has pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Germany has acknowledged
it could be hard to protect companies doing business with Iran, as a senior U.S. official
renewed a threat of sanctions against European firms.


German companies also face the prospect of possible extra levies — Trump imposed a 25
percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March but the European
Union has been granted exemptions until June 1.


“America First now increasingly means America Alone,” DIHK President Eric Schweitzer told
the RND group of newspapers. “That makes German businesses really worried.”

Nonetheless, a DIHK survey published earlier this month showed a record number of German
companies believe economies in foreign markets where they do business will improve despite
rising political and trade risks.


In January Trump said he would always promote “America First”, as he expected other world
leaders to do on behalf of their own countries, but added: “America First does not mean
America alone. When the United States grows so does the world.”


Schweitzer called for the EU to take a tough line in the trade dispute with the United States,
saying while it was important to remain in dialogue over difficult conflicts, “we’re moving in
the wrong direction if we automatically react to new unreasonable demands with
concessions.”


Germany is Europe’s biggest exporter to the United States.

U.S., China putting trade war on hold, Treasury's Mnuchin says


Lindsay Dunsmuir, Howard Schneider


WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s
largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade
agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.


Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the
agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for
addressing trade imbalances in the future.

“We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold
while we try to execute the framework,” Mnuchin said in a television interview on “Fox News
Sunday.”


On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under
which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States
to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.


During an initial round of talks this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China
reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries’ joint
statement on Saturday.


The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment on Mnuchin’s
statement.

Tension between the two sides has been growing since the Trump administration proposed
tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods and said it might extend the levies to an additional $150
billion. China responded with its own measures targeting U.S. agriculture.


The top U.S. trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said that getting China to open its market to
more U.S. exports was significant, but that it was far more important for the United States to
resolve issues with China such as forced technology transfers and cyber theft.


“Real structural change is necessary. Nothing less than the future of tens of millions of
American jobs is at stake,” U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said in a statement on Sunday.


In response to Mnuchin’s comments, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a
frequent Trump critic, said he thought it would be a mistake for Trump to settle for “a promise
to buy goods” with so many larger issues on the table.


“If President Xi is going ... to fail to take strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft,
and American companies having free access to sell goods in China ... we will have lost,”
Schumer said.


Kudlow told CBS “Face the Nation” it was too soon to lock in the $200 billion figure for
China’s promised purchases. “The details will be down the road. These things are not so
precise,” he said.

In addition, he told ABC’s “This Week” that the broader issues were still in play, and that
China had “structural reforms” such as lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers that will allow
the United States to boost exports.


Trump was in a “very positive mood about this,” Kudlow said.


However, he said there was no trade deal yet reached.


“There’s no agreement for a deal,” Kudlow told ABC. “We never anticipated one. There’s a
communique between the two great countries, that’s all. And in that communique, you can see
where we’re going next.”

One next step will be dispatching Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to China to look at areas
where there will be significant increases, including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture
and manufacturing, Mnuchin and Kudlow said.


Mnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40
percent in agricultural exports to China this year alone and a doubling of energy purchases
over the next three to five years.


“We have specific targets. I am not going to publicly disclose what they are. They go industry
by industry,” Mnuchin said.


Saturday’s statement made no mention of whether there would be a relaxation of paralyzing
restrictions on Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp imposed last month
by the U.S. Commerce Department.


The action was related to violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea and banned
American companies from selling semiconductors and other components to ZTE, causing the
Shenzhen-based company to cease most operations.


Trump said last week he had directed Ross to put ZTE back in business, but Kudlow said any
changes would be minimal.


“If any of the remedies are altered they are still going to be very, very, tough, including big
fines, compliance measures, new management, new boards,” he said. “Do not expect ZTE to
get off scot-free. Ain’t going to happen.”
