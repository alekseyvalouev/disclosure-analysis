SinoTech Energy Limited’s questionable dealings
with Premium Sino Finance and Ernest Cheung


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


In October 2007, Ernest Cheung acquired 100% of SinoTech Energy


Limited, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTE $2.80) for approximately US$4.7


million. In May 2009, Mr. Cheung (Click here to see a report on Mr.


Cheung) reportedly sold CTE to Premium Sino Finance Chairman


Qingzeng Liu, who later became CTE’s current Chairman; and Wise


Worldwide Limited for RMB50 million or approximately $7.3


million. 


Seven months later in November 2009, Premium Sino Finance and


Wise Worldwide Limited agreed to pay Mr. Cheung, and one of the


individuals that sold CTE to him, US$58 million in additional


consideration based on “certain oral agreements.” Click here to see


those oral agreements. Click here to see the analysis of the $58


million additional consideration. CTE provides no disclosures


pertaining to Premium Sino Finance Limited’s ability to make the


initial or additional payments related to its CTE acquisition or the


“certain oral agreements.” 


Some of our concerns regarding SinoTech Energy Limited include


but are not limited to whether Premium Sino Finance had sufficient


funds to pay the additional consideration to Ernest Cheung. The


2007 and 2009 acquisitions involved a purported oral agreement to


pay additional consideration to both Xin and Cheung; CTE does not


disclose the source of funds for this additional consideration.


Ernest Cheung may still be of significant importance in SinoTech


Energy Limited’s activities. To read about Mr. Cheung’s transactions


in CTE’s prospectus, click here.


CTE’s year 2010 Form 20-F states that “we may not be fully informed


of the identities of all our beneficial owners,” and cannot compel


them “to comply with the SAFE Circular 75 requirement” and that


Manuel Asensio
doesn’t bet
often. But when
he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

“SAFE Circular 75 states that PRC citizens or residents must register


with the relevant local SAFE branch or central SAFE in connection


with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established


for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving a roundtrip


investment whereby the offshore entity acquires or controls


onshore assets or equity interests held by the PRC citizens or the


residents.” According to SinoTech, if it cannot “compel” its own


shareholders to comply with policies in PRC, then it may be “subject


to fines or legal sanctions, restrict” their “overseas or cross-border


investment activities, limit“ their “subsidiaries’ ability to make


distributions or pay dividends or affect” their “ownership structure,


which could adversely affect” their “business and prospects.” To


read the statement, click here.


CTE’s prospectus states that it’s required to, “Under the M&A


Regulations, the acquisition of a domestic enterprise by a foreign


investor must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce, or


MOFCOM, or its authorized local branch, and an asset appraisal


report issued by an independent asset appraiser must be presented


to the approving authority as a basis for determination of the price


for such acquisition.” CTE did not obtain an asset appraisal report


issued by an independent asset appraiser. To read the full statement


by CTE related to this, click here.


SinoTech’s Income Statement for quarter ended December 31, 2010


includes a “write-off bank loan discount” for the amount of


$36,976,800. Premium Sino Finance funded the cost for the 2007


and 2009 acquisitions, not SinoTech. To see the write off on CTE’s


income statement, click here.


SinoTech’s Deutsche Bank loan agreement was apparently


predicated on Premium Sino Finance issuing warrants on shares of


SinoTech Energy Limited’s stock that it obtained through the 2009


transaction.


(1) Using a HK corporation called International Petroleum Services


Corporation Limited; Mr. Cheung acquired Tianjin New Highland


Technology Development Co., Ltd. that ultimately became CTE. CTE


provides no disclosure that indicates International Petroleum had


any operations prior to its having acquiring CTE.
