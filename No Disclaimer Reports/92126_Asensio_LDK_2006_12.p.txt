LDK Recycles Old News,


Continues Questionable


Accounting


LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK $50.85) today announced


signing a contract with Hyundai Heavy Industries. LDK made


a nearly identical announcement on February 22nd.


Today’s press release states that LDK signed a contract to


supply 440MW of solar wafers to Hyundai Heavy Industries


Co., Ltd. over a seven-year period, from 2009 to 2015. To

LDK’s press release from February 22nd states that LDK


signed a contract to supply 450MW of wafers to Hyundai


Heavy Industries, from late 2008 to 2015. To read the


February 22nd release, click here.


The only di�erences between the two releases are slight


changes in the start date and the amount of wafers,


expressed in mega-watts (MW). Interestingly, today’s release


does not make any reference to the prior announcement.


Most readers would think today’s release is announcing a


new contract.

company of making misrepresentations in its accounting of


inventories. To read asensio.com’s prior reports, click here.


LDK’s most recent �nancial statements also show entries


which some investors may �nd questionable. LDK’s


inventories continue to increase reaching $656 million, up


87% from $350 million at year-end 2007. LDK continues to


use the irregular entry of “Inventories to be processed


beyond one year.” Also, its accounts receivable increased


828% over the six months ended June 30, 2008, going from


$3.8 million to $35.0 million. To view LDK’s most recent


�nancial statements, click here.


LDK investors with questions on the company’s accounting


will not �nd many answers in its quarterly releases. LDK


continues not to release the standard �nancial statements


expected of companies trading in the US. The company


apparently does not feel compelled to create greater


transparency for investors. LDK only issued quarterly


statements in the form of a press release, and even then it


did not bother to include a basic cash-�ow statement.
