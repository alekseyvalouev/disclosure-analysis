Dear Sirs:  
 
We note with interest FDA's 15-day warning letter, issued 9-7-2012 to L'Oreal in the context of 
unsubstantiated medical claims made for anti-aging cosmetics products sold by Lancome in the US. 
http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm318809.htm  
 
This letter raises to your attention comparable but far more extreme unsubstantiated medical claims 
made by the "AgeLOC" flagship brand applied to at least 11 of Nu Skin's cosmetics, dietary supplement, 
and electrical device products.

It is our opinion that the abuses in market practices of Nu Skin are of far more concern than those of 
Lancome, for the following reasons:   
 
1)  The extreme nature of the claims themselves, including extensive marketing communications based 


upon the following themes, especially as describing the "AgeLOC" brand: 
 


"Resets Youth Gene Clusters" 
"Modulates genetic expression"  
"Fountain of Youth – we have found out how to unlock the secret of youth by resetting Youth 
Gene Clusters" 
"Algorithm that identifies groups of genes [arSuperMarkers] that play a central role in the aging 
process" 
"products that … work at the genetic level" 


 
2) Products sold by 170,000 independent representatives in the "Americas" (including US, Canada 


and Latin America – no specific US distributors numbers are disclosed) and 860,000 distributors 
worldwide.  No doubt a vast number of these distributors and their customers are U.S. based .  
This creates a severe enforcement problem in terms of the specific training these representatives 
receive, and the specific claims they may be instructed to make to potential customers.   There are 
numerous examples of these claims being made in marketing and support materials provided to 
these representatives.    


 
( Just 2 of numerous examples: )

3) Association with noted prestigious research institutions 
Nu Skin prominently promotes itself and repeatedly associates its products with the names of 
Stanford University and Purdue University in conjunction with its marketing claims for "AgeLOC".  
There are (literally hundreds of statements on Nu Skin's various websites and PR stating that 
Stanford is in a "partnership" and/or "collaboration" with Nu Skin regarding the genetic sources of 
aging and their products efficacy in treating aging "at its source".)  


 
(Again, just a small sampling of hundreds of instances:)

4)  Product already impounded 


FDA records indicate that at least two shipments of Nu Skin electrical devices have been impounded 
at ports of entry, in conjunction with FDA determination of whether they should be classified as 
"medical devices".   Since these products are identified as "AgeLOC", there is no doubt that the 
marketing claims of the "AgeLOC" brand attach to them.

5&DocId=1&LineId=1&SfxId=A

http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/importrefusals/ir_detail.cfm?EntryId=112-8601643-
5&DocId=1&LineId=1&SfxId=B  
 
Similar products appear to be manufactured and sold by Nu Skin in the US and worldwide today.   
 


Conclusion 
Clarity is urgently needed by all parties, including those participating in legitimate gene therapy research 
and development, the entire cosmetics and dietary supplement products industry, Nu Skin's distributors 
and customers, and the public market for investments in the wide range of companies whose revenues 
and profits are impacted by your regulatory scope. 
 
We understand FDA's budgetary constraints require selection of issues and companies affected, but we 
hope the scope and impacts of the issues presented above is broad enough to warrant immediate clarity 
from your agency.   
 
Yours truly,
