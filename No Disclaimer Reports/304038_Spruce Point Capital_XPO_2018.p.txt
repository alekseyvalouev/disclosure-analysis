extracting significant operating leverage 
and $200-$300m of revenue synergies 


from the Command Transportation deal


An effective roll-up acquirer serving the

changed its financial leverage presentation in 
its investors presentation - implicitly 


acknowledging our criticism. Q2’17 results 
were below expectations, it admitted 


continuing challenges in its end markets, and 
its YTD operating cash flow evaporated. CECO’s 
shares were downgraded, and shares fell >40%  


Gross margins have declined from over 47% 
to 39%. The Company’s successive

Spruce Point Estimates 40% – 60% Intermediate 
Downside Risk, 100% Long-Term Downside


Spruce Point has been following XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) for years, a transportation and logistics roll-up founded by Bradley Jacobs, co-
founder of United Rentals (URI) which collapsed in an accounting scandal during his leadership. Based on our forensic investigation, we believe 


XPO appears to be executing a similar playbook to URI - resulting in financial irregularities that conveniently cover its growing financial strain 
and inability to complete additional acquisitions despite promises. Given its unreliable and dubious financials, $4.7 bn debt burden, inability to 


generate sustaining free cash flow, and dependency on external capital and asset sales, we have a worst-case terminal price target of zero.

30%-60% Downside
Long-Term Target: $0


CEO Jacobs has surrounded himself with a web of associates from his United Waste Systems and United Rentals days. Two of 
his partners, Mike Nolan and John Milne, were convicted of accounting fraud. XPO’s director G.C. Andersen recently employed 
Milne at his financial advisory firm during a time the company worked on private placements (potentially XPO’s deals) and was
sanctioned by FINRA. This wasn’t disclosed to investors. XPO’s audit committee director, Adrian Kingshott, has omitted from 
his bio his role in the distribution of note securities in the $700m Marc Drier Ponzi scheme.


XPO has completed 17 acquisitions since Jacobs took control in 2011 and deployed $6.1 billion of capital. Yet by our 
calculations, the Company has generated $73m of cumulative adjusted free cash flow in an expansionary economic period. In 
our view, this is indicative of a failed business strategy yielding a paltry 1.2% return on invested capital. XPO is dependent on 
external capital, asset sales, and factoring receivables to survive and is covering up a working capital crunch that can been seen 
by bank overdrafts - just like Maxar Technologies (MAXR). As credit conditions tighten, cost of capital increases, and XPO’s 
business practices come under greater scrutiny (eg. U.S. Senate), its share price could swiftly collapse in Enron-style fashion.


In our opinion, XPO has used a nearly identical playbook from United Rentals leading up to its SEC investigation, executive 
felony convictions, and share price collapse. We find concrete evidence to suggest dubious tax accounting, under-reporting of 
bad debts, phantom income through unaccountable M&A earn-out labilities, and aggressive amortization assumptions: all 
designed to portray glowing “Non-GAAP” results. Additionally, we provide evidence that its “organic revenue growth” cannot be 
relied upon, its free cash flow does not reflect its fragile financial condition, and numerous headwinds will pressure earnings.


XPO insiders have aggressively reduced their ownership interest in the Company since coming public, and recently enacted a 
new compensation structure tied to  “Adjusted Cash Flow Per Share” - defined in such a non-standard way that it is practically 
meaningless. Conveniently, it ignores any measure of capital efficiency, which is critical in the capital intensive transportation 
industry, and would expose XPO’s poorly constructed roll-up. In our opinion, the Board is stacked with rubber-stamping Jacobs 
loyalists, none of which have requisite experience in the transportation and logistics industry. As noted above, the Board 
includes an audit committee member who abetted a notorious $700m Ponzi scheme.
XPO has recruited 19 brokers to cover it, with only 1 “Sell” opinion and an avg. fantasy price target of $114 (implying 90% upside). 
No analyst has conducted a forensic look at XPO’s earnings quality, or revealed its Board and management’s connections to 
convicted felons. XPO promotes itself to investors as a “technology” company and how it uses “robots” for warehouse automation, 
but ignores its growing financial strain, precarious $4.7 billion debt load, and inability to hit its cash flow target. Warren Buffett 
famously said, “Only when the tide rolls out do you know who as been swimming naked” – words of wisdom for XPO 
shareholders. A crisis of confidence in management and a loss of access to capital could wipe out shareholders. In the interim, 
we see 40% - 60% downside risk as the market reassess XPO’s earnings quality, outlook, and sum-of-parts multiple.

Capital Structure And Valuation


XPO is more expensive than it appears given its highly “adjusted” Non-GAAP results, and analysts’ inability to 
correctly account for the 10.2m shares that are freely convertible from the Series A Convertible Preferred stock 


(market value = $615m). Our report will detail XPO’s aggressive tactics to bolster reported Adjusted EBITDA and EPS, 
and will argue that XPO trades at a premium to the sum-of-the-parts of its acquisitions despite no evidence it has 


created tangible financial value from its levered (junk) acquisition spree.


1) Includes 10.2m incremental shares converted for the $41m book value perpetual Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
2) Per new accounting rules FASB ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), XPO is likely to record $1.9bn of operating leases on its balance sheet
3) Based on 13.75% of XPO’s Europe’s market value and reduced by $41m for the assumed Series A Convertible Preferred Stock conversion
4) Per XPO’s 10-K, includes $53.3 of cash collateral for the Euro Trade Securitization Facility as of 12/31/17. XPO does not provide quarterly disclosure of collateral


$ in millions, except per share figures

Summary of XPO Financial & Accounting Concerns: 
Mirroring The United Rentals Fraud Scandal of 2008?


Concern Evidence Impact and Implication URI Playbook


Non-Economic Value 
Destructive Roll-Up


• Seventeen acquisitions since Jacobs took control of XPO, $6.1 billion 
of capital deployed, and generated just $73m of cumulative 
adjusted free cash flow = a failed business strategy yielding a 1.2% 
return on capital investment


• To continue its growth, XPO will be dependent on 
larger acquisitions and more external capital


• Rising interest rates and cost of capital will lower 
economic returns to the strategy


YES


Dependent On 
Banks To Survive


• XPO has raised $5 billion of debt and equity capital, and is resorting 
to increased asset sales and factoring of accounts receivables to 
bridge the financing gap


• $190m of financing costs to Wall Street, not including 
M&A advisory fees


• Can create incentives to appease banks before 
shareholders (evidence: forward equity sale)


YES


Growing Working 
Capital Crunch + 
Persistently 
Out of Cash


• Moving to more capital intensive businesses (trucking/warehouses)
• XPO has repeatedly reported bank overdrafts and stopped reporting 


quarterly details in current liabilities
• Working capital to sales ratio climbs every quarter, while difference 


between DSO and DPOs contracting >>> Started factoring European 
accounts receivable in Q4’17


• We believe XPO will be forced to continue to raise 
additional debt or equity capital


• A likely factor why XPO has failed to complete an 
acquisition in 2018 despite headlines in 2017 of its 
“$8 billion” capacity for deals 


Organic Revenue
Growth Not Reliable


• Inability to reconcile XPO’s historical stated organic growth, 
including calculation discrepancy in XPO’s 2017 organic result


• Questionable Non-GAAP adjustment to FX impact
• Despite YTD quarterly avg organic growth of 10.8%, cash flow 


growth increased by just 3.2%


• The CEO has stressed organic sales growth is one of 
the biggest factors that investors use to value XPO. 
This creates possible incentives for XPO to inflate this 
metric


Adj. EBITDA And 
Earnings Quality 
Concerns Make XPO 
More Levered Than 
It Appears


• XPO has repeatedly stretched out amortization assumptions
• Reports significantly increased non-operating pension gains
• Labels recurring M&A and restructuring costs as EBITDA add-backs 


despite these being material costs of executing its roll-up strategy
• Includes 100% of XPO Europe as EBITDA despite owning 87%
• Dependence on operating leases will move on balance sheet in 2019
• In Q3’18, XPO shifted gains and losses on asset sales from “other 


income” into operating results, without providing $ details


• EBITDA is another important financial metric investors 
focus on. We estimate leverage of Net Debt/Adj
EBITDAR is close to 3x


• URI case cited improper accounting for customer 
relationships, while we observe XPO consistently 
stretching out assumptions for customer relationship 


YES
10


Summary of XPO Financial & Accounting Concerns: 
(Cont’d)


Concern Evidence Impact and Implication
URI 


Playbook


A/R Bad Debt 
Manipulation


• Post Q2’15 acquisitions, XPO’s allowance for bad debt as a % of 
gross receivables materially declined despite Norbert carrying a 
higher % of allowances, and has been growing every quarter


• XPO just started disclosing bad debt in Q3’18 MD&A


• XPO could have flushed bad debts and labelled them as 
acquisition costs to be ignored. URI case cited improper 
A/R reserve manipulation to boost net income


YES


Phantom Income 
Potential Through 
Unaccountable M&A 
Earn-Out Liability


• XPO created a $29m earn-out liability on June 30, 2015 despite 
not disclosing any earn-out compensation for the three 
acquisitions during that period: UX Logistics, ND, or BTT


• The liability was reduced to zero, but XPO did not disclose cash 
payments or share issuance to satisfy the liability


• IF XPO followed standard earn-out accounting, it would 
reverse the liability and book $29m of income.


• URI case cited improper acquisition reserves to offset 
expenses


YES


Large Discrepancy 
Between Income
Statement And 
Cash Tax Expense


• XPO has recognized a cumulative income tax benefit of $132m 
since Jacob’s joined, while paying $182m in actual cash taxes


• The discrepancy makes XPO’s GAAP EPS less meaningful. 
We estimate the cumulative earnings benefit has been 
$1.55/share


• The URI case cited improper tax accounting


YES


Obscure Diluted 
Share Count 


• The perpetual preferred stock is convertible at $7/share, making 
it deeply in-the-money. In Q1’16 XPO stopped giving a clear 
picture to investors about the sources of potentially diluted 
securities – including 10.2m shares from the preferred stock


• Sell-side analysts have incorrectly modelled the share count, 
making XPO’s valuation look cheaper than economic reality


Unjust Insider 
Enrichment on 
Questionable 
Metrics


• XPO uses a non-standard definition of “adjusted cash flow per 
share” to earn significant bonus compensation


• The calculation ignores any measure of return on invested 
capital, which is common in the transportation/logistics industry


• XPO management enriching itself for non-economic value-
added investing inc. special bonuses for completing deals 
(part of its job!). Employees and Unions (Teamsters) already 
calling out XPO management’s greed

XPO Adj. EPS vs. Spruce Point Reality: 
Approximately 47% Overstatement


Line Item
XPO Consensus


2018E
Spruce Point


2018E Normalized
Comment


Operating Income (EBIT) $800.0 $800.0 Consensus estimate


Less: Pension Income -- ($76.8)


Not a sustainable component of continuing earnings. XPO has clearly tried to 
accelerate gains from the past few years, and claimed these gains as “operating” to 
inflate EBITDA. Changes in market returns assumptions will drive these gains lower 
over time


Less: Incremental wage pressures -- ($37.5)
There is ample evidence from union, Senate inquiries and lawsuits that XPO is under-
spending on wages and safety while US wage pressures increase. We conservatively 
estimate $625m of wages and salaries at a 6% increase to direct operating expenses


Less: Transaction, Integration, 
Restructuring & Rebranding costs


-- ($26.7)
Recurring costs of XPO’s stated acquisition strategy that it conveniently tries to have 
investors ignore


Less: Bad Debt Expense -- ($25.0)
It strongly appears that XPO has been delaying bad debt expenses, and just started 
mentioning it in Q3’18. In 2017, $24m was charged to expense, but the real amount 
is likely 2x based on Norbert’s historical accrual


Less: Amortization Expense -- ($23.2) XPO has consistently extended amortization periods to lower amortization expense


Less: Incremental Interest Expense -- ($1.2) Incremental interest expense from rising interest rates applied to Term Loan 


Total Spruce Point Adjustments -- ($190.4) Our adjustments deducted  from the Street’s $635.8m pre-tax income


Pro Forma Pre-Tax Cont. Income $635.8 $445.4 We estimate XPO’s normalized pre-tax profit is approximately -30% lower


Less: Taxes ($192.4) ($134.8) 30% implied effective tax rate


Adjusted Net Income $443.4 $258.6 We deduct $52m for minority interest


Diluted Shares 133.0 146.8 Analysts ignore the Series A Convertible Pfd. stock while XPO obscures the impact


Adj. Diluted EPS $3.33 $1.76 We estimate continuing EPS approx. -47% below the street “adjusted” estimates


In our opinion, XPO’s highly “adjusted” EPS is a combination of aggressive accounting, unsustainable pension gains, and poor 
practices that underpay workers and appear to cut corners on worker safety.

$650m ( vs. Consensus est. of $884m and implying virtually no YoY growth). However, it claims Adj EBITDA 
can grow 12-15%, which suggests that Adj. EBITDA is not a meaningful way to value XPO’s business. (1,2)

Evidence of A Non-Economic Model


Seventeen acquisitions since Jacobs took control of XPO, $6.1 billion of capital deployed, and it has generated $73m 
of cumulative adjusted free cash flow = a failed business strategy yielding a 1.2% return on capital investment. 


XPO Post Jacobs Roll-Up Strategy Implementation


1) Represents the provision on the income statement that is a claim due to minority owners of XPO Logistics Europe SA. XPO’s cash flow statement begins with Net Income pre-minority interest.
2) Cost associated with XPO’s discretionary policy to compensate employees with restricted stock, presented as a “financing” cash flow, but operating in nature
3) Fixed and recurring payments to Series A Preferred Stockholders akin to interest expense
4) Recurring costs necessary to implement XPO’s stated acquisition business strategy


XPO’s latest Annual Report added a new risk factor: “Our past acquisitions, as well as any acquisitions that we may complete in the 
future, may be unsuccessful or result in other risks or developments that adversely affect our financial condition and results.”

We’ve been critical of Echo Global Logistics in the past, but its roll-up strategy including 21 companies is significantly 
better than XPO’s. Since inception, Echo has spent $521m for acquisitions, with cumulative free cash flow of $166m = 


32% return on investment. By year eight (on an apples-to-apples basis with XPO), Echo returned 37%.

XPO Collapses Absent Capital Support


Classic corporate financial schemes that collapsed were exposed for their dependency on external financing and 
an inability to generate sustained cash flow. Not surprisingly, we find that XPO is a capital raising machine, 
having raised $5 billion of debt and equity capital, while paying out $190m of financing costs to Wall Street 


(ex: M&A advisory fees). XPO has bridged the gap between $6.1bn of acquisition costs and $5bn of capital raising 
with $817m of asset sales, and $364m of factoring receivables through XPO Logistics Europe created in Oct 2017.

XPO Moving Into Lower Return, 
Higher Capital Intensity Businesses


Investors appear blind to the fact that as XPO has moved away from its traditional third party asset-light logistics business, and 
into trucking and supply chain fulfillment, its capital requirements have increased. We don’t view any of these as positive 


developments, especially as XPO is now fronting capital for customer warehouses.

Signs Suggesting A Recent Liquidity Crunch


Our analysis illustrates that XPO experienced a recent cash crunch. The spread between DSOs and DPOs contracted in Q4’17 
and it implemented a trade receivable facility in the same quarter. The ratio of Working Capital to LTM Revenues also gapped 


higher into 2018, which suggests its business is become more capital intensive. XPO also stopped providing its working capital 
discussion in the 2017 10-K, and omitted the disclosure that it had sufficient ability operate in the next 12 months. In Q3 2017


(November) the CFO said working capital would be a source of $50-$60m of cash in Q4 2017; this proved to be false (1). 


As of December 31, 2016, we had $342.0 million of working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of $373.4 million, compared to working capital of $262.8 million, including 
cash and cash equivalents of $289.8 million, as of December 31, 2015. This increase of $79.2 million in working capital during the period was mainly due to an increase in cash and 
accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses…. We believe that cash generated from operations, our existing cash balance, and availability of capacity 
to draw down under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months Source: 2016 10-K, p. 27

Evidence To Suggest XPO Beholden To The 
Banks’ Interests Ahead of Shareholders


The proxy statement also illuminates the fact that prior equity awards were certified by a condition that 
“[XPO’s] Stock Price at $60 or above for 20 consecutive days prior to April 2, 2018”


The $60 price objective is oddly similar to the forward equity sales price of $58.50 between XPO and JPM / Morgan 
Stanley in July 2017. Given our earlier conclusions that XPO is heavily dependent on external financing, this creates 


the appearance of preferential dealing between XPO and its bankers. 


“In July 2017, the Company completed a registered underwritten offering of 11 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $60.50 per 
share, plus up to an additional 1.65 million shares of its common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares 
of the Company’s common stock directly from the Company (the “Offering”). Of the 11 million shares of common stock, 5 million shares were offered 
directly by the Company and 6 million shares were offered in connection with forward sale agreements (the "Forward Sale Agreements")”


XPO 8-K:  “On July 25, 2018, the Company settled each of the Forward Sale Agreements with the applicable Forward Counterparty, as a result of which 
the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of its common stock in the aggregate and received aggregate net cash proceeds equal to approximately $351 
million. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to grow its business in part through acquisitions, the Company entered into the Forward Sale“

A Closer Look At What’s Important 
To Management


Q - Bascome Majors: “Just one final question on incentives. You’ve been very transparent on your long-term incentive 
plan and the FCF per share targets that you rolled out last year for that. I was wondering if you can talk about in the 
short-term plan or annual bonus, is there any different focus this year than last year? Just what metrics are being 
emphasized and why as we head into 2017 and 2018?”


A - CEO Bradley S. Jacobs:  “It’s real simple. It’s EBITDA minus CapEx, minus interest expense. So, we’re aligning the 
executive suite with shareholder interest. So, when we meet with our top shareholders, we usually – and they give us a 
QBR, quarterly business review, just like our customers give us a QBR, the main three metrics that they look at are, first 
how’s your EBITDA growth going? Second, box checks very well there, very significant above average EBITDA growth. 
Second one they look at is, cash flow, and nice big ramp-up of cash flow this year from the previous year, nice expected 
FCF increase 2017 over 2016 and even continuing that in 2018 over 2017. And the third metric they look at is, organic 
revenue growth. They’re looking for mid-single-digits organic revenue growth. So those are the three things that our 
owners, our shareholders are looking at, so that’s what we want to incentivize our organization focused on as well.”


Source: Q4 2016 Earnings Call


XPO touts its ability to meet and exceed expectations in a consistent manner. Management is most likely to 
manipulate and inflate the metrics important for its compensation and its targets to appease investors and analysts. 
In the quote below, CEO Jacobs lays out exactly the three most important metrics. Note: EBITDA minus capex and 


interest expense is his bonus metric.

#1:  Dubious EBITDA


Spruce Point has consistently warned about Non-GAAP financial presentation abuse. XPO’s Adjusted EBITDA is 
particularly egregious, especially in light of its desire to give 100% credit for XPO Europe despite owning just 86.25%.


Recurring costs necessary to

Phantom Income Through An 
Unexplained Reserve For An Earn-Out?


XPO booked a mysterious “Acquisition Earn-Out Liability” of $29m in Q2’15. XPO completed three deals in this time period, but 
made no disclosure about any earn-out components of the consideration. In subsequent periods, XPO did not recognize any 


payments through its cash flow statement to satisfy the earn-out, or equity issuance to satisfy the debt. Proper accounting for the 
earn-out would have resulted in XPO marking-to-market the changes in the value of the earn-out through the income statement. 


Failure to achieve the earn-out and reducing its value to zero would have resulted in $29m of phantom income. (1) 


Warning: “From 1997 to 
2000, during a period of 


enormous growth through
acquisitions, URI engaged 


in improper accounting 
practices involving its 


valuation of
acquired assets, use of 


acquisition reserves, and 
accounting for customer 


relationships.”

Low Quality Pension Income


Ever since acquiring Con-Way and ND, XPO has been reporting accelerated pension gains that have been increasing 
EBITDA, and now pre-tax income (1). These gains are non-operational and can be used to mask underlying weakness 
in XPO’s core business. Not surprisingly, XPO hasn’t drawn attention to pension gains in its earnings press releases, 


quarterly filings, conference calls or investor presentations until recently in Q2’18 (2).


Source: XPO 10-K filings, Bloomberg 2018 consensus estimates. Note: US/UK estimated gains from previous year Annual Reports. XPO’s total pre-tax gains exceeded estimates in both 2016/17
1. XPO adopted ASU 2017-07 on Jan 1, 2018 and reclassified the income from operating income to other expense (income) on the income statement
2. Q2’18 conference call: “Other income was $30 million in the quarter versus $20 million in the first quarter. The largest piece of this was due to our well-funded pension plans, where strong 


asset returns have outpaced expense.”
3. Estimate based on 2018E income tax rate of 23.6% and 134.1 diluted shares. Previous years the effective tax rate was negative


“We have historically realized income, rather than expense, from these plans. We generated aggregate income from our U.S. and U.K. plans of $44.4 
million in 2017, $27.5 million in 2016 and $8.2 million in 2015. The plans have been generating income due to their funded status and since they do not allow 
for new plan participants or additional benefit accruals. The effects of the defined benefit pension plans on our operating results consist primarily of the net 
effect of the interest cost on plan obligations for the U.S. Plans and the U.K. Plan, and the expected return on plan assets. We estimate that the defined benefit 
pension plans will contribute annual pre-tax income in 2018 of $32.4 million for the U.S. Plans and $41.4 million for the U.K. Plan.”  XPO 10-K pp. 38 and 40

Signs To Suggest M&A Bad Debt 
Allowance Manipulation


We analyzed XPO’s allowance for doubtful accounts and find a worrisome fact that allowance reserves were depressed post the Q2 2015 
acquisitions of ND, UX and BTT. ND was the material acquisition contributor, and its financials show a 2.4% allowance accrual vs. XPO’s 


1.9% pre-acquisition. On a go forward basis, it makes little sense why XPO’s allowance dropped to 0.6% and has risen every single 
quarter in the last two and half years to a more normal level. Ironically, at Jacob’s last company United Rentals, the SEC charged it with 
manipulating the accounts receivable acquisition reserves. Absent intentional manipulation, the rising allowance trend could indicate 


XPO’s declining ability to collect from existing customers, or sales being recorded from lower quality new customers.

New Q3’18 Disclosure Corroborates 
Suspicions of A/R Problems….


Lo and behold, XPO just now included a disclosure in its 3rd quarter 2018 10-Q about how it accounts for accounts 
receivables and allowance for bad debt, and added bad debt expense in its MD&A. This strongly suggests it has been 


covering up strain in its business, consistent with our analysis and observations on the prior slide.


New Disclosure: Accounts Receivable


Accounts receivable are recorded at the contractual amount. The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon 
its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical collection experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, any specific customer collection issues that have been identified, current 
economic conditions, and other factors that may affect the customers’ ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable
balances once the receivables are no longer deemed collectible from the customer. The Company sells certain accounts receivable 
to unrelated financial institutions. The cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to the Company’s results of 
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.          


Q3 2018: Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)


SG&A for the third quarter of 2018 was $447.2 million, or 10.3% of revenue, compared to $399.6 million, or 10.3% of revenue, in 
the third quarter of 2017. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was flat in the third quarter primarily due to higher bad debt expense, 
lower professional fees and essentially flat employee compensation costs. SG&A for the first nine months of 2018 was $1,351.7
million, or 10.5% of revenue, compared to $1,213.4 million, or 10.8% of revenue, in the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in 
SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the nine-month period primarily reflects lower professional services and consulting costs and
revenue growth of 15.2% for the first nine months of 2018..

More Desperate Ways To Inflate EBITDA?


XPO made a subtle change in Q3 2018 to move gains and losses from property and equipment from “other expenses 
(income)” into the direct operating expense line item. XPO does not break-out these gains or losses, but in a worst 


case, it is improperly inflating EBITDA by running gains as a reduction to operating expenses. XPO’s asset sales have 
increased 54% YoY, and it explicitly says any gains/loss below operating income are excluded form EBITDA. (1)


Source: Q2’18 10-Q, p. 25


“Other expense (income) for the second quarter of 2018 was $(30.2) million as compared to $(12.5) million in the second 
quarter of 2017. Other expense (income) for the first six months of 2018 was $(49.8) million as compared to $(19.0) 
million in the first six months of 2017. Other expense (income) includes net periodic benefit income and gains and losses 
on sales of property and equipment.”


“Direct operating expenses are both fixed and variable expenses and consist of operating costs related to our contract 
logistics facilities, last mile warehousing facilities, LTL service centers and European LTL network. Direct operating costs 
consist mainly of personnel costs, facility and equipment expenses such as rent, equipment maintenance and repair 
expenses, costs of materials and supplies, information technology expenses, depreciation expense, utilities and other 
facility related costs and gains and losses on sales of property and equipment.

Financial Presentation

credit risk on those 
forward contracts? 


Non-standard and 
aggressive definition. 
Assets sales are not 


guaranteed or recurring


XPO uses aggressive financial presentation methods to bolster its cash flow and leverage by including proceeds 
from assets sales. This is another aggressive financial presentation tactic used at Jacob’s United Rentals. (1) Even 
worse, XPO assumed that its forward stock sale transaction would settle, while blindly ignoring counterparty risk.

#3: “Organic” Revenue Growth Does

XPO has abandoned its attempt at expanding organic revenue disclosure post Q1’18. Through YTD Q3’18, organic 
quarterly revenue growth has averaged 10.8%, yet equates to just 3.2% YTD organic operating cash flow growth.

Questionable Organic Revenue Growth 
And FX Impacts


“We believe that total organic revenue is an important measure because it excludes the impact of the following items: foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, and fuel surcharges. Specifically, our total organic revenue reflects adjustments to 
(i) exclude revenue from our North American truckload unit, which was sold in October 2016, (ii) exclude the estimated revenue attributable 
to fuel, and (iii) apply a constant foreign exchange rate to both periods (based on average rates during the monthly periods).”


Non-GAAP metrics such as organic growth calculations are not audited and give management significant discretion 
to show results in the most glowing fashion. Total non-US revenues increased 6.1% between 2016 and 2017. 


Yet, it reported an FX hedge loss of $57.6m in 2017 vs. a gain of $40.3m in 2016. 
However, XPO reports to investors virtually no impact to organic revenue from currency fluctuations.

Questionable Organic Revenue Growth 
And FX Impacts (Cont’d)


If management can’t seem to get its GAAP treatment of currency hedging correctly, do you really trust its 
ability to accurately present Non-GAAP foreign currency results on revenues? In Q3’18, XPO reclassified 


foreign currency cash flow from hedge from operations to investing, which now shows historical 
overstatement of results.


Source: XPO Q3 10-Q, p. 15


Foreign Currency Option and Forward Contracts


“In the third quarter of 2018, the Company changed its policy related to the cash flow presentation of foreign currency 
option contracts as the Company believes cash receipts and payments related to economic hedges should be classified 
based on the nature and purpose for which those derivatives were acquired and, given that the company did not elect 


to apply hedge accounting to these derivatives, we believe it is preferable to reflect these cash flows as Investing 
activities. Previously, these cash flows were reflected within Operating activities. Net cash used by investing activities 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 includes a reclassification of $13 million of cash usage that had been 
reflected within Operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Prior years’ impact were not material. 
With this change in presentation, all cash flows related to the foreign currency contracts are included in Investing 


activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.”

#4: How To Inflate EPS?
Obvious Signs of Aggressive Accounting 
Assumptions Tied To Intangibles


XPO is increasing its amortization period assumptions, which lowers expenses and boosts earnings, while at the same 
time reducing disclosures when its Chief Accounting Officer resigned. XPO’s footnotes reveal forward expectations for 


amortization expense, and actual results have come in materially lower. We estimate a $0.12 - $0.14 annual benefit.


1) XPO stopped disclosing useful life estimations on quarterly basis in Q3’16 and now only reports it on an annual basis. They also stopped giving a quarterly breakdown related to computer software 
and capitalized internally-developed software as follows: “Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of computer software was $117.5 million and $56.5 million for the three-month 
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $353.0 million and $98.8 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net book value of 
capitalized internally-developed software totaled $138.2 million and $122.8 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.”

XPO Manipulating Tax Assumptions?


More evidence that XPO’s income statement doesn’t reflect true economic reality can be seen by a close examination 
of its income tax representations. XPO has recognized a cumulative income tax benefit of $132m since Jacob’s joined, 


while paying $182m in actual cash taxes!  We estimate the cumulative earnings benefit has been $1.55 share.

What’s XPO’s Real Share Count?


In our opinion, we do not believe the market is accurately evaluating XPO’s diluted share count. 
We conducted a forensic review, and find that XPO has vastly reduced its disclosures about the potential impact of 
dilutive securities, an indication that XPO may not want investors to know. We believe XPO’s Series A Convertible 


Preferred should be considered outstanding and dilutive considering its conversion price is $7.00 per share, 
significantly below the current trading price.

Aggressive Lease Usage


XPO makes aggressive use of off-balance sheet leases relative to its larger and better credit worthy peers. 
Companies like FedEx and UPS use operating leases for more capital intensive assets such as airplanes and related 


facilities, whereas XPO has none. New accounting guidance could require XPO to recognize these lease on its 
balance sheet next year, though it claims to still be evaluating the issue.

“In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise 
from leases, including operating leases. Under the new requirements, a lessee will recognize in the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and 
the right-of-use asset representing the right to the underlying asset for the lease term…. The standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, 
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects these ASUs will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements and related disclosures. As of December 31, 2017, the Company reported $1,978.5 million in operating lease obligations and will evaluate those contracts, as 
well as other existing arrangements, to determine if they qualify for lease accounting under the new standards. The Company does not plan to adopt the standards early”

"The workers want a legally binding process to hold XPO accountable for the mistreatment," said Bill Hamilton, President of Local 
107 in Philadelphia. "They are also concerned about the loss of work to subcontractors delivering goods directly to customers, 


known as last mile drivers."

“It is now clear that the problems in XPO are not limited to the American workforce. XPO Logistics is a rotten employer all over
Europe, and this is a priority for unions in France, Spain, Belgium, the UK and across the EU. By standing together, we can stop the 


rot at XPO in Europe, and make the company change its ways in the US”

"XPO's arrogance and repeated labor law violations has gone on for far too long. These drivers courageously took action and let
the company know workers are no longer going to sit and watch the company violate their rights. We are proud of these workers
and Local 769 is fully committed to fighting alongside them until justice is won at XPO,“ Josh Zivalich, president of Teamsters Local

“It is time for XPO CEO Bradley Jacobs to explain to company workers why he is entitled to a huge payout while he cuts the health 
care and retirement benefits of workers who are making this company so successful,” said Monica Abraham, a quality control 


inspector for XPO in North Haven, Conn. who spoke at the shareholder meeting. “Workers shouldn’t be punished while Jacobs gets 
rich off our backs!”

"While Jacobs received $20 million mega-equity, got approval for a $110 million stock-bonus plan and has received a 481-percent 
bump in pay in recent years, workers are denied affordable health care, have no retirement security and the company is stomping 


on their federally protected rights to form their union," said Ernie Soehl, Director of the Teamsters National Freight Division.
"Workers have demanded a meeting with Jacobs, which is why Teamsters are here today, but Jacobs continues to refuse to meet 


over serious issues with workers."

United We Stand, Divided We Fall:
Beware of the Company You Keep….


United Waste Systems United Rentals


In July 1989, Jacobs founded United Waste Systems in Greenwich, 
Connecticut, planning to consolidate small garbage collectors that 
had overlapping routes in rural areas. Jacobs served as chairman and 
CEO, and in 1992 he took the company public on the NASDAQ. In 
August 1997, after the company had made more than 200 
acquisitions, Jacobs sold United Waste Systems to USA Waste 
Services Inc. (now known as Waste Management, Inc.) for $2.5 billion


In Sept 1997, Jacobs formed United Rentals, serving as the new 
company's chairman and CEO. As with United Waste, Jacobs planned 
to grow United Rentals through a rollup strategy, consolidating small 
equipment rental dealers across North America. URI went public in 
Dec. 1997, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Jacobs stepped down from United Rentals in August 2007

History does not bode well for the subsequent owners of Jacob’s led M&A hype machines. Two of Jacobs colleagues from United 
Waste Systems and United Rentals were charged by the SEC and Justice Dept. for financial fraud. John Milne was Vice Chairman,
and Chief Acquisition officer of United Rentals since its acquisition in Sept 1997. He held the same role at Jacob’s United Waste 


Systems from 1993 to 1997. He was sentenced to prison. Michael Nolan was also charged for his role at United Rentals, where he had 
been the CFO since its formation. He was also the CFO of United Waste Systems from 1994-1997

XPO is not shy about hiring Chief Accounting Officers with a history of working at companies known for aggressive 
accounting practices. Both of its CAO’s worked at General Electric (GE), which is currently under investigation by the 
SEC for accounting practices at its Power division. In addition, the current CAO worked at defamed Arthur Andersen.

Jacobs Rapidly Diluting His Stake


We are not surprised to see XPO management starting to engage in more aggressive accounting and business 
practices now that it has less and less at risk in the venture. On the next slide, we will show how more of Jacob’s 


economic are tied to a non-industry standard and aggressive metric inherently open to financial engineering.

Black Box, Flawed Metrics Driving 
Insider Enrichment (Cont’d)


In our opinion, XPO’s “Adjusted Cash Flow Per Share” bonus metric is a meaningless target because it doesn’t measure return on 
capital deployed. (1) XPO’s egregious insider enrichment practices also extend to its Board approving special bonuses for 


completion of the ND acquisition. So in other words, management was paid for doing its job. (2)

XPO’s Board lacks experienced operating executives in the transportation and logistics industry. Furthermore, we 
are concerned that the Board lacks experience in the exact industries that XPO says are most relevant to its 


business (notably: retail, ecommerce, food/beverage, technology, and aerospace) (1)

XPO’s Director Hired A Convicted Felon To Work on 
Private Placement Transactions During A Period XPO 
Was Actively Issuing Private Placements…Coincidence?


Spruce Point has additional concerns about XPO’s former Director G.C. Andersen, who served on the Board from 2011-2016 and claimed to 
be “Independent”. Andersen also served on the Board of Jacob’s previous venture United Waste Systems, and his website touts the firm’s 


“roots fed the success of companies such as United Rental, United Waste, XPO Logistics”. (1)  We uncovered a recent FINRA action in 
June 2018 against Andersen’s firm, which revealed he hired a known convicted felon dubbed “JM” to work on private placements at the 
same time XPO raised over $3.6 billion through various private placement offerings. XPO would later disclose in 2016 that it evaluated 


“commercial transactions” with an entity Andersen was a director (presumably his own company).

“JM” = John Milne = Convicted Felon, 
Former United Rentals Executive


John Milne, former President and CFO of United Rentals, was sentenced to 27 months in prison for conspiring to falsify books and
records in March 2010 and was ordered to pay financial restitution. (1) Earlier this year in April 2018, Milne was ordered back to 
prison for failing to paying back the money, despite the court’s belief he had capacity to do so. (2) In the interim, he acted as a 


financial consultant on various “private placement” transactions for XPO’s Director G.C. Andersen.

2) Former Rental Company Executive Sentenced to 2 Years in Prison for Violating Supervised Release, Dept. of Justice


“Since his release from prison in May 2012, MILNE has paid 
approximately $500,000 of the $5.25 million of disgorgement 
that was due. Chief Judge Hall found that, based on 
MILNE’s income and expenditures on luxury services, 
personal items and travel, he had the ability to pay much

multiple occasions to provide MILNE the opportunity to 
make additional disgorgement payments, but he repeatedly 
failed to do so.”


How was Milne earning income and spending on luxury 
services, and why would he rather go back to jail than to 


pay restitution? Is there more to the story?

G.C. Andersen Also A Terex Director: 
Terex Has A Fraudulent History With Jacobs URI


If XPO didn’t work with Andersen’s firm to issue private placements, then it could have business dealings with Terex, 
where Andersen has long served as a Director according to his biography. Terex was also charged with fraud by the 


SEC for its dealings with Jacob’s last firm United Rentals.


“For Mr. Andersen, those relationships included ordinary course commercial transactions between our company and an entity for which Mr. Andersen 
is a director.”  Source: XPO 2016 Proxy Statement, p.18


Source: SEC website


“G. Chris Andersen has served as a director of the company since September 2, 2011. Mr. Andersen is the founder and a managing partner of G.C. 
Andersen Partners, LLC. Previously, Mr. Andersen served as vice chairman of PaineWebber, and as head of the Investment Banking Group at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Incorporated. Mr. Andersen is the lead director for Terex Corporation (Note: He Served On Terex’s Board Since 1992). He is a member 
of the International Advisory Council of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University; sits on the advisory board of the RAND Corporation’s 
Center for Asia Pacific Policy; and is a director and member of the Executive Committee of Junior Achievement of New York. Mr. Andersen holds a master’s 
degree from the Kellogg School of Management and is a chartered financial analyst.” Source: XPO 2014 Proxy Statement

Audit Committee Member Since 2011 Inception 
(Former Chair)


Though not implicated in the United Rentals scandal (the key elements of fraud occurred prior to his joining in 2005), 
it’s worth considering that current XPO Audit Committee expert Jason Papastavrou also served for Jacobs at United 


Rentals on the Audit Committee. XPO’s proxy statement calls Mr. Papastavrou “independent”.

Family Ties? A Close Look At The 
Business Interests of The CEO’s Wife


Sugar and Plumm Holdings, Inc. Liberty Cars, LLC


Investors should be concerned that an XPO employee is signing business filings for the candy business of 
its CEO’s wife. Furthermore, Jacob’s wife founded a company called “Liberty Cars, LLC” on November 3rd, 2017. While 


we don’t know the exact nature of this business, or have any proof of self-dealing, we do know the formation came 
around the time of XPO’s Q3’17 earnings, and during a period where its financials started showing strain. 


In addition, XPO increased its pace of asset sales in the subsequent quarters and a majority of its assets are vehicles.

There are nearly as many analysts offering price targets on XPO as FedEx and UPS which are 5-7x larger companies. 


Only two analysts are cautious, while a resounding majority are bullish and want investors to give XPO a premium multiple.

Pumping XPO To Less Sophisticated 
Retail Investors


CEO Jacobs touts his ability to do a $7 - $8 billion deal that’s accretive to EPS, and claims technology is its 
“secret sauce”. Fast forward a year, and XPO hasn’t acquired anything.


In Spruce Point’s opinion, XPO’s secret sauce is stock promotion and accounting gimmickry to embellish results.

Many Fundamental Headwinds Will Weigh On 
Forward Earnings Potential


Concern Spruce Point’s Assessment


Revenues
• Waning pressures on the US transportation sector and increased capacity resulting in lower pricing and margins
• Synchronized slowing in global growth from trade wars and tariffs


Operating Costs


• Labor:  XPO depends on significant hourly labor and truckers to operate its business. A general shortage of 
experienced truckers and labor shortages in the US is pressuring wages. Additionally, XPO has experienced work 
stoppages and pressure from the Teamsters Union 


• Worker safety: XPO is under investigation from the US Senate related to safety conditions for its workers. 
• Bad Debts: Appear set to increase now that XPO is finally subtlety disclosing in Q3’18 the impact
• Pension: XPO has remarkably increased pension income every year, but with equity and fixed income returns 


falling precipitously around the world, return expectations should start to decline


Currencies


• XPO has significant exposure to foreign currencies, notably the Euro and the Pound
 12% of revenues from the UK
 26% from Rest of Europe (France 13%)


• Brexit overhang is pressuring both of the currencies. GBP was +10% in 2017, now -6% in 2018; Euro was +15% in 
2017 and -5% in 2018


• XPO discloses a notional $1.3bn cross-currency swap and the use of FX options
• We estimate XPO hedges just 26% hedge of total Euro and GBP exposure


Interest Rates


• XPO’s $4.2 billion debt load (Weighted Avg Maturity: 6yrs) will eventually be refinanced at a higher interest rate
• It currently has a $700m ABL (undrawn), $1.5bn Term Loan, $365m Euro A/R securitization facility, and $52m asset 


financing that are floating rate and will increase interest expense as rates rise
• We estimate 45% of XPO’s debt outstanding is floating rate (it does not have any floating-to-fixed interest rate 


swaps as of 9/30/18)


XPO’s inability to deliver a game-changing acquisition in 2018 despite repeated promotions by management and 
brokers leaves more negative headwinds than positive tailwinds to future financial results.

XPO: A Collection of Acquired Junk


As we’ve demonstrated, XPO has extracted no value (as measured by excess cash flow) from 17 acquisitions, while its two 
recent large deals have saddled it with bad debts, higher pension liabilities, and moved it toward greater capital intensity 


businesses. We do not see how XPO can conceivably trade at a valuation higher than the sum of its acquired parts.

Warning: The core of XPO formed around tiny acquisitions it paid virtually nothing for.

much higher as are result of $1.9 billion of operating leases that XPO could soon have to recognize on its balance sheet from


ASU 2016-02 adoption on in 2019. XPO has been quiet on the topic, and has continually said it is “evaluating” the issue and that
it would not early adopt the standard.

Valuation of Public Comparables


XPO Logistics has morphed from a traditional third party (asset light) logistics provider into an integrated provider of 
transportation and logistics services (capital intensive). As a result, we believe it should receive a lower multiple more closer to 
larger integrated peers such as UPS and Fedex, albeit at a valuation discount to reflect its suspect accounting and low quality 


management and Board, with demonstrated associations to convicted felons and a Ponzi scheme. (1) We believe 2019E 
estimates are too high, and XPO will fail to deliver a material acquisition as it struggles with fundamental headwinds.


1) Stock promoters such as JP Morgan claim XPO should trade at a premium, “We use modestly above-peer multiples of 12.5x and 7.6x for each of XPO’s respective parts in recognition of organic 
growth opportunities in a diverse number of large markets bolstered by high-quality management” Nov 1, 2018

Common Sense


Six Simple Reasons XPO Is Uninvestible And A Potential Zero
1. XPO’s CEO has associated with felons that perpetuated a fraud at United Rentals / Terex
2. Its Audit committee member has hidden his involvement in a $700m Ponzi scheme
3. There are striking similarities in the accounting playbook between United Rentals and XPO
4. XPO has generated virtually no free cash flow since inception and is resorting to bank overdrafts, factoring 


receivables, and increased asset sales to bridge its capital needs
5. XPO is now burdened with $4.2bn of debt, and entirely dependent on external capital for growth. 


With interest rates and overall cost of capital increasing, will banks gleefully fund XPO’s grand ambitions?
6. US Senators and Teamsters already distrust XPO. How will they respond after reviewing our report?

XPO trades at approximately 8.7x our Adjusted 
EBITDA – a premium to the average multiple paid 
for its seventeen acquisitions of ~7.5x (a majority 
at peak cycle values). XPO should not trade above 


the sum of its parts given our belief it has not

Despite having zero patents, there are signs of XPO embellishing its technology prowess with buzz words and greater 
use of the word “technology” in its SEC filings. Despite this,  XPO can’t get its IT professional count straight.

Robotics “News” To Feed The XPO Stock 
Promotion Machine?


XPO is trying very hard to position itself more like a technology company, when in reality it is just a trucking company 
and a logistics provider. It recently issued a press release that it would deploy 5,000 collaborative warehouse robots 
in North America. XPO was successful in generating lots of headlines with “news” associating itself with robotics…. 


mission accomplished!
