Rolta India Limited (“Rolta” or the “Company”) is an information technology company with operations primarily in India and 


North America.  In 2013 and 2014, Rolta issued an aggregate of US$ 500 million of junk bonds (the “Junk Bonds”), which are 


due in 2018 and 2019, and have attracted investors by offering tempting yields.   
 


In our opinion, bondholders and ratings agencies have fallen for the myth of Rolta.  Fitch rated Rolta’s Junk Bonds BB- 


because of the Company’s “current profitability levels [and] ability to generate free cash flow,” and expects Rolta’s capital 
expenditures to come down as the Company supposedly transforms itself from a high-margin, higher-capital-expenditure 


business to a lower-margin, lower-capital-expenditure model.  This is rubbish.   





Based on the evidence and analysis presented in this report, we believe that Rolta has fabricated its reported capital 


expenditures in order to mask that it has materially overstated its EBITDA.  The margin for error is narrowing: Rolta’s net debt 


has risen from US$ 319mm at FYE 2011 to US$ 740mm in Q3 2015 and the Company has almost nothing to show for its 
highly suspicious spending.  


 
Rolta’s shares rallied recently on news that it was part of one of two consortiums selected in the final round to bid for the 


Ministry of Defense’s battlefield management contract.  This rally seems premature.  Rolta, together with Bharat Electronics 


Limited (BEL), has yet to win the contract – it must compete in the final stage with a rival consortium led by India’s Tata 
Power and Larsen & Toubro.  Moreover, any revenue or profits generated by this contract, if Rolta’s consortium wins, will 


only be realized in four to five years (at the earliest), by which time we expect Rolta’s serial capital raising scheme to have 


unraveled. 
 


We believe that in reality, Rolta’s business does not generate free cash flow and that Rolta cannot repay foreign bondholders 


without refinancing.  Indeed, we suspect Rolta approached foreign bond markets because it was unable to borrow in India.  
Ultimately, we believe that bondholders and ratings agencies have failed to price in evidence that Rolta has materially 


misstated its financial performance and the risk that Rolta will default on its Junk Bonds.  We value the bonds at the recovery 


value of the offshore assets, which we estimate to be USD 0.16 on the dollar. 





1. Evidence Suggests Capital Expenditure Fraud.  From FYs 2008-2014, Rolta spent INR 70 billion (US$ 1.4 bln) on 
capital expenditures, an amount far in excess of the INR 43 billion (US$ 858 mm) in EBITDA that Rolta supposedly 
earned over this period.  Rolta has little to show for such spending: its fixed asset turnover ratio was a dismal 0.7x (FYs 


2012-2014), which is 93% less than an average of its putative peers.  Rolta’s reported capital expenditures are deeply 


suspicious, with much of the reported spending disappearing into phantom prototypes, mysterious construction projects 
and computer systems of questionable authenticity and utility.  In our view, the preponderance of the evidence suggests 


that the vast majority of Rolta’s reported capital expenditures have been fabricated.   


 
a. Computer Systems.  From FYs 2011-2014, Rolta spent INR 31 billion (US$ 594 mm) on computer systems, 


representing 64% of the Company’s total capital expenditures during this period.  Suspiciously, during this same 


period, Rolta disposed or scrapped INR 21.1 billion (US$ 396 mm) of computer systems (including over INR 
5.9 billion (US$ 108.1 mm) of recently purchased equipment) and in return received only INR 77.2 million (US$ 


1.3 mm).  Put simply, over this period, Rolta incurred a cash loss equal to almost 100% of the money invested to 


purchase such equipment.       
 


i. Buy, Depreciate, Sell, Lose Money, and Repeat.  Rolta appears to have purchased computer equipment, 
only to depreciate its value and scrap or dispose of it (usually for minimal value) within a short time of 
purchase.  In FY 2013 alone, by depreciating the value of recently purchased computer equipment before 


disposing it, we believe that Rolta was able to conceal from analysts and investors that it sold or scrapped INR 


16 billion (US$ 295 mm) of computer equipment for an almost total loss (including INR 5.9 billion (US$ 
108.1 mm) of equipment which was purchased the previous year).  Such losses are so staggering that we 


question the authenticity of the capital expenditures and suspect that the function of such dispositions is 


simply to provide a black hole on paper to mask the overstatement of the Company’s EBITDA.

ii. Why Spend So Much on Computer Systems?  On a gross basis (i.e., ex depreciation), as of FYE 2014, Rolta’s balance 
sheet had US$ 99,873 (INR 6 mm) in computer systems per employee, which is 45 times more than a broad group of 


Indian based IT companies, which strongly indicates that such purchases were not authentic. 





b. Missing Buildings.  Rolta’s reported capital expenditures on buildings are also highly suspicious.  Between FYs 2010 and 
2014, Rolta claims to have spent INR 9.5 billion (US$ 185 mm) on buildings.  This is almost the value of the Mumbai 


Indians, an IPL cricket club.  Yet, during that time, Rolta did not disclose the acquisition or construction of any new buildings 


or real property.  In short, the Company appears to have nothing to show for its reported spending.  Where did this money go?  





c. Phantom Prototypes.  In FY 2014, Rolta reported INR 8.4 billion (US$ 139.4 mm) of capital expenditures on the 
development of prototypes.  This is suspicious because Rolta’s maximum possible expenditure for prototypes for its two 


most significant prospective procurement contracts is US$ 23.4 million (because the Indian Ministry of Defense covers 80% 


of the cost of such prototypes).  If Rolta spent a maximum of US$ 23.4 million on its two most salient prospective contracts, 


we are highly suspicious that it spent another US$ 112.1 million in FY 2014 on prototypes for projects not disclosed to 


investors.   





d. Ikea be Damned.  Perhaps the most absurd line item in Rolta’s capital spending is the reported investment in office furniture.  
As of FYE 2014, Rolta’s balance sheet had US$ 10,493 of furniture and fixtures per employee, which is 7.1x greater than 


Google, which has some of the most lavish corporate facilities of any business.  Again, such capital expenditures simply 


appear fabricated.   





e. Capital Expenditures for the Benefit of Chairman’s Private Company.  On its FY 2009 earnings call, Rolta’s CFO told 
analysts that the Company planned to spend INR 1.5 billion (US$ 31 mm) on a new facility at Gurgaon.  But Rolta failed to 


disclose that the Gurgaon facility was (and is) owned by the Chairman’s private company.  Worse still, following completion, 


Rolta appears to pay the Chairman INR 156 million (US$ 2.5 mm) per year to lease the facility.  Why would a Company pay 


to construct a facility that it does not own and then also pay to lease it?  We believe that either such spending is fabricated or 


is simply a naked transfer of wealth to the Chairman.   





f. Capex Significantly Exceeds Guidance.  Typically, capital investment is reasonably foreseeable, at least in the near term.   
Not for Rolta’s management team.  Since FY 2009, Rolta has spent an average of 178% more on capital expenditures per year 


than management guided to analysts in Q1 or Q2.  A predictable pattern has emerged: early in each calendar year, Company 


managers promise analysts and shareholders that capital expenditures will come down significantly, only for such 


expenditures to skyrocket in Q3 and Q4.  In our opinion, this indicates that management is either incompetent and does not 


remotely understand its business or it is simply fabricating capital expenditures in Q3 and Q4 in order to mask overstated 


earnings.  We believe the latter.   





2. Past is Prologue: 2004 Accounting and Tax Scandals.  In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) 
concluded that Rolta had inappropriately inflated its reported revenues by 12-34% each year from 1996 through 2001, by 


including the cost of capital equipment in its top-line revenue figures. Just one month later, India’s Income Tax Department (ITD) 


deployed 100 agents to execute a simultaneous raid of the Company’s offices (and the residences of some directors and officers) 


in an investigation alleging that Rolta claimed depreciation on fictitious assets in order to avoid taxes.  Unbelievably, despite both 


major tax and accounting scandals, neither Rolta’s independent directors on its audit committee nor its auditor were fired or 


resigned.  Nor, to our knowledge, was any other top level executive fired or forced to resign.  In our view, such accounting and 


tax scandals not only show that Rolta and its top-level managers have a propensity to manipulate the accounting of capital 


expenditures in order to artificially inflate financial performance, but also that the Company’s senior managers appear almost 


indifferent to the accounting, legal and ethical requirements to participate in global bond markets. 





3. Undisclosed Procurement Scandal.  In 2011, the Indian Defense Minister reportedly initiated an investigation into a lucrative 
procurement contract awarded to Rolta.  In January 2014, a television segment by Headlines Today reported that Col. Sujit 


Banerjee, an Indian army officer who was a key witness in the case (it is unclear whether it was the same case from 2011 or new 


allegations of corruption against the Company), was found dead in his hotel room before he was supposed to appear in a special 


deposition before the Army’s court of inquiry regarding the matter.
1
  The salacious investigation appears to be ongoing, but Rolta 


failed to disclose it in either its 2013 or 2014 bond prospectuses, which in our view is a material omission because the scandal 


could jeopardize future contracts with the Indian government (Rolta’s largest source of revenue for its Indian business).  These 


incidents are also further evidence of the lack of transparency or accountability at Rolta.

4. Questionable Transactions with Chairman.  Rolta has engaged in numerous arrangements with Chairman 
K.K. Singh to enrich him at the expense of bondholders.  





a. Dividends Paid with Borrowed Funds.  Since 2008, Rolta has paid out an aggregate of INR 4 billion 
(US$ 82 mm) in dividends to shareholders.  This primarily benefited Chairman K.K. Singh, who 


during this period owned between 40%-50% of the Company’s outstanding shares.  The problem is 


that Rolta fails to generate free cash flow (net of capital expenditures), meaning that the Company is 


borrowing money to pay such dividends, a practice which enriches its Chairman at the expense (and to 


the risk) of bondholders.   





b. Chairman’s Compensation Structure Incentivizes Overstatement of Profits.  Publicly available 
records from the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs show that the Chairman is entitled to a 


commission equal to 5% of the net profits of the Company.  Yet the Chairman was paid INR 61 


million (US$ 1.2 mm) in commissions in FY 2012, even though Rolta reported a significant loss for 


the year.  The Chairman’s compensation structure is murky, appears arbitrary and incentivizes 


accounting gimmicks to promote paper profits and massaged earnings.  





5. Myth of Rolta.  Rolta’s bond rating is based on the perception among ratings agencies and bond holders that 
the Company is profitable (~35% EBITDA margins) and purportedly generates free cash flow.  Looking deeper 


undermines both supposed pillars of Rolta’s bond rating.       





a. Rolta’s +70% Indian EBITDA Margins Are Not Credible.  Rolta’s North American business loses 
money (FYs 2011-2014), meaning that Rolta’s reported profitability is driven by suspiciously high 


EBITDA margins for its Indian operations, which exceeded +70% in FYs 2013 and 2014.  Such 


margins, in our opinion, are simply absurd for any business.  But it is doubly suspicious that Rolta’s 


wildly profitable Indian subsidiary is also the entity responsible for Rolta’s pattern of questionable 


capital expenditures.  





b. Negative Free Cash Flow.  Despite reporting consistent revenue growth and high EBITDA margins, 
Rolta has not reported positive free cash flow before financing since 2006.  This is a significant red 


flag and similar to China Metal Recycling, a Hong Kong listed company which collapsed under 


suspicion of fraud following our whistle-blower report to the market.   





6. Valuation.  Rolta tells bondholders that its debt to EBITDA ratio is ~4 to 1 (as of Q3 2015).  We believe that in 
reality, Rolta fails to generate positive EBITDA (in either its offshore or its Indian business).  In our view, 


Rolta has fabricated dubious capital expenditures in order to conceal the overstatement of profitability to 


bondholders.  We believe that Rolta will only be able to pay coupons with capital raised from debt or equity 


markets, and that the Company will be unable to repay the bonds at maturity because they will not be able to 


refinance them.  Because foreign creditors must attempt to enforce their rights through India’s byzantine, 


corrupt and slow judicial system, we think that much like international bondholders in other situations of Indian 


corporate bond defaults (i.e., Zenith Infotech), any recovery of assets in India will be very difficult if not 


impossible.  Therefore, we think the bonds are worth the recovery value of the offshore assets and the offshore 


business.  All but two of Rolta’s international subsidiaries lose money, so we assumed that in a recovery 


scenario creditors would be able to liquidate such subsidiaries for 7x EBT (a generous assumption).  Assuming 


Rolta kept US$ 50 million in cash offshore (67% of its cash balance as of Q3 2015), combined with US$ 5.8 


million in offshore fixed assets (mostly real property), we estimate that offshore creditors will recover US$ 


0.16 cents on the dollar.  





Ultimately, we believe that Rolta’s dubious capital expenditures are a smoking gun indicating that far from the 


profitable and cash-flow-generating business that bondholders and ratings agencies thought they were 


evaluating, in reality Rolta’s business is not profitable, and it does not and will not generate sufficient cash 


to service its foreign debt or repay bondholders upon maturity (without refinancing).  We believe that 


neither bondholders nor ratings agencies have priced such information into Rolta’s Delaware bonds.  This was 


avoidable.  After all, Rolta has done this before.

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FRAUD 


In rating Rolta’s 2014 corporate bonds BB-, Fitch relied on Rolta’s “profitability levels [and] ability to 


generate free cash flows.”  Indeed, Rolta reports world-class EBITDA margins (typically ~35%), driven 


by less than credible EBITDA margins from its Indian subsidiary which have exceeded 70% in FYs 2013 


and 2014.  But despite such profitability, Rolta is a serial capital raiser.  The reason is that all of its 


supposed profits evaporate into capital expenditures.  Indeed, if bondholders also consider such capital 


expenditures, Rolta has failed to generate free cash flow in any year since 2008, and it is not even 


close.    





From FYs 2008-2014, Rolta spent INR 70 billion (US$ 1.4 bln) on capital expenditures, an amount far 


in excess of the INR 43 billion (US$ 858 mm) in EBITDA that Rolta supposedly earned over this period.  


A comparison of cumulative capital expenditures with cumulative EBITDA since 2008 shows that Rolta’s 


reported capital spending has far outstripped any profits supposedly generated by its operating business.   





 
Source: Company Filings 





By any measure, the return on Rolta’s capital expenditures has been abysmal.  Despite aggregate capital 


expenditures of INR 49 billion (US$ 939 mm) in FYs 2011-2014, net profit only grew from INR 3.5 


billion (US$ 78 mm) in 2011 to INR 4.1 billion (US$ 67 mm) in 2014 (annualized), a paltry increase of 


just INR 600 million.     





Despite capital spending far in excess of earnings, Rolta has little to show for it.  Rolta’s fixed asset 


turnover ratio (a measure of the return on capital investment) is a dismal 0.7x (FYs 2012-2014), which is 


93% less than an average of its putative peers.

A comparison of fixed asset turnover ratios shows that Rolta’s return for its capital expenditures is 


abysmal.  Compared to putative competitors (including other Indian IT solutions firms), Rolta’s return on 


its investments is an order of magnitude lower.  So if Rolta’s capital expenditures did not go into 


increasing returns, where did the money go?  





Rolta’s reported capital expenditures are deeply suspicious, with much of the reported spending 


disappearing into phantom prototypes, mysterious construction projects and computer systems of 


questionable authenticity and utility.  In our view, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that most 


of Rolta’s reported capital expenditures have either been fabricated or have been inappropriately 


capitalized in order to inflate the Company’s reported EBITDA.

Suspiciously, the Company has spent so much money on computer systems that such spending has almost 


exceeded the EBITDA supposedly generated by the business.

What does Rolta have to show for such expenditures? Almost nothing.   


a. Buy, Depreciate, Sell, Lose Money, Repeat 
 


From FYs 2011-2014, Rolta spent INR 31 billion (US$ 594 mm) on computer systems, representing 64% 


of the Company’s total capital expenditures during this period.  Suspiciously, during this same period, 


Rolta disposed of INR 21.1 billion (US$396 mm) of computer systems and in exchange received only 


INR 77.2 million (US$ 1.3 mm). Rolta fell into a predictable pattern of acquiring computer systems and 


then disposing such systems at a loss:

This resulted in wasted cash (or cash losses) exceeding INR 25.5 billion (US$ 493.1 mm) from FY 


2008-2014, simply by purchasing and quickly disposing of computer equipment!   





In the following chart, we analyze the disposal of computer systems to show Rolta’s highly suspicious 


pattern of purchasing computer equipment only to dispose of it soon thereafter at a massive loss.  In order 


to filter out Rolta’s accounting gimmicks, we analyze the disposals of computer equipment on a gross 


basis, assuming no depreciation.  We also assume a FIFO system, meaning that we assume that in the 


event of disposals, Rolta sold the oldest computer equipment first.

Assuming a FIFO disposal process, we can calculate both the age of the disposed computer systems and 


Rolta’s cash loss on disposal (removing the effect of depreciation).  Remarkably, during this period, 


most of Rolta’s losses occurred on the disposition of relatively new computer equipment: 





 
Source:  2014 Bond Prospectus, Rolta Annual Reports, Glaucus calculation 





The most egregious example occurred in FY 2013, when Rolta purportedly disposed of INR 16 billion 


(US$ 294.6 mm) of computer systems including INR 4.3 billion (US$ 77.9 mm) of equipment that was 


only two years old and INR 5.9 billion (US$ 108.1 mm) of equipment that was purchased the 


previous year.   





In FY 2013, in exchange for selling or scrapping computer systems supposedly valued at INR 16 billion 


(US$ 294.6 mm) (ex depreciation), Rolta received only INR 12.2 million (US$ 222,000)!  In other 


words, Rolta took an almost total loss on recently purchased equipment.   





Worse, Rolta hid this loss from analysts and investors with an accounting gimmick.  Rolta reduced the 


useful asset lives of computer equipment from 4-10 years to 2-6 years, which permitted the Company to 


depreciate the value of the disposed equipment to almost zero.  This is why the Company took a massive 


depreciation hit on computer equipment in FY 2013 (INR 12.4 billion (US$ 227 mm) in depreciation) and 


reported a net loss for the year.

Rolta explained that it revised the estimated useful life of its assets out of ‘prudence.’  We believe that in 


reality, Rolta revised the estimate so that it could depreciate the book value of the disposed computer 


equipment to zero, saving Rolta from having to record a loss from the sale.  Rolta was therefore able to 


deduct such losses as an exceptional item and maintain the fiction with ratings agencies and bondholders 


that such losses would not impact the Company’s future profitability.    





Bondholders should also note that Rolta gives very little detail on such dispositions (or purchases), 


making such transactions appear even more suspicious.  From whom is Rolta purchasing such computer 


systems? To whom is it disposing them?   





Ultimately, Rolta’s cumulative cash losses on dispositions of recently acquired computer systems nearly 


surpassed the Company’s reported cumulative EBITDA from FY 2008 through FY 2014.  This leads 


us to believe that rather than being bona fide capital investments, such purchases and related dispositions 


are simply fabricated to mask similarly fabricated EBITDA.

b. Why Spend So Much Money on Computer Systems?  
 


It is still unclear why Rolta needed to spend so much money on computer systems.  On a gross basis (i.e., 


without accounting for depreciation), as of FYE 2014, Rolta balance sheet shows US$ 99,873 (INR 6 


million) worth of computer systems per employee, which is as least 45 times more than its Indian 


competitors.  The apparent absence of utility supports other evidence suggesting such purchases were not 


authentic.

There is no reason that Rolta’s spending on computer systems should so far exceed other companies 


offering IT solutions.  That Rolta has spent 45 times more on computer systems per employee than its 


putative peers is simply further evidence, in our opinion, that such reported investments are merely 


fabricated.

2) Missing Buildings 
 


Rolta’s reported capital expenditure on buildings is also suspicious because the Company’s technology 


park was built in 2005-2006, leaving bondholders to wonder about what kind of buildings Rolta 


purchased with their money.  Between FYs 2006 and 2014, Rolta claims to have spent INR 12 billion 


(US$ 241 mm) on buildings, which exceeds the value of the IPL cricket club the Mumbai Indians.   








Exactly what Rolta received for its INR 12 billion (US$ 241 mm) in spending is unclear.  Almost all of 


the real property and buildings owned by the Company (according to its 2013 and 2014 bond 


prospectuses) were purchased in 2006 or before.  The only addition appears to be office suites in 


Mumbai (SEEP SEZ), which were completed in April 2009.   








This begs the obvious question: if Rolta did not purchase any new buildings between the completion of 


the office suites in Mumbai in 2009 and the issuance of its 2014 bond prospectus, what exactly did the 


Company receive in exchange for INR 9.5 billion (US$ 185mm) in capital expenditures on buildings 


from FY 2010 through FY 2014? In our opinion, such reported capital expenditures appear simply 


fabricated.

3) Phantom Prototypes 
 


In FY 2014, Rolta reported INR 8.4 billion (US$ 139.4 mm) of capital expenditures on the development 


of prototypes for defense and homeland security.   No further information is given on such prototypes, but 


there is reason to doubt the authenticity of these reported expenditures.  





The two largest defense and homeland security contracts for which Rolta is bidding require prototypes, 


but such prototypes are paid for mostly (80%) by India’s Ministry of Defense and are projected to cost 


well below US$ 139.4 million reportedly spent by the Company in FY 2014, even if Rolta is wins the 


prospective contracts.  





First, Rolta is bidding to provide a battlefield management system (“BMS”) to the Indian Army.  The 


procurement process requires a prototype projected to cost $67 million, with the MOD picking up 80% of 


the cost.
3
  This means that Rolta’s total expenditures for a BMS prototype would be $13.4 million.  


However, Rolta is bidding for the project as part of a consortium with Bharat Electronics,
4
 suggesting it 


would share such expenses.  





Second, Rolta is also bidding for a contract to build a tactical communication system (“TCS”) for the 


Indian army.  The prototype for the TCS is projected to cost US$ 50 million, with the MOD bearing 80% 


of the cost.
5
  Rolta’s maximum total expenditure for this prototype (assuming it is bidding by itself) is 


US$10 million.   





Given that Rolta’s maximum expenditure for the prototypes for its two largest bids is a combined US$ 


23.4 million, we are highly suspicious that Rolta spent US$ 139.4 million on prototypes in FY 2014.  





We are doubly suspicious considering that Rolta’s reported expenditures on prototypes exceeded the 


reported EBITDA generated by the Indian business in FYs 2013 and 2014, respectively.  








Where did this money go? What prototypes did Rolta build which supposedly swallowed almost all of the 


firm’s profit?  We believe, based on the preponderance of the evidence, that such expenditures were 


simply fabricated to mask overstated earnings.

4) Ikea be Damned 
 


Perhaps the most absurd line item in Rolta’s capital spending is its reported investment in office furniture 


and fixtures.  As of FYE 2014 (9 months), Rolta’s balance sheet had US$ 10,493 of furniture and fixtures 


per employee, which is 7.1x greater than even Google, the Silicon Valley giant, which boasts some of 


the most lavish and renowned corporate facilities of any business.   











Rolta’s reported spending on fixtures and furniture appear prima facie absurd. We googled “most 


expensive office chairs” and found the following list.  One chair, the Wegner Swivel, costs $10,600, but 


even on a list of the priciest chairs, most of the models appear to only cost around $4,000-$5,000.  So 


how is Rolta spending US$ 10,493 per person on furniture and fixtures? 





By comparison, Google has perhaps the world’s most lavish (and renowned) corporate campus.  Yet 


Rolta’s balance of furniture and fixtures per employee is 7.1x greater than Google’s.   








Much like reported capital expenditures on computer systems, buildings and prototypes, Rolta’s reported 


spending on furniture and fixtures appears fabricated.

5) Capital Expenditures for the Benefit of the Chairman’s Private Company 





On Rolta’s FY 2009 earnings call, management projected that the Company’s largest capital 


expenditure in 2010 would be for a new facility in Gurgaon, a city outside of Delhi.   Hiranya Ashar, 


Rolta’s Director of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, told analysts and investors that the Gurgaon 


facility would cost Rolta roughly INR 1.5 billion (150 crores) (US$ 31 mm):  





Source: FY 2009 Earnings Conference Call 


There is evidence that Rolta actually built the Gurgaon facility.  The Company discloses in its 2014 Bond 


Prospectus that it is currently involved in litigation over an air conditioning system that it paid to have 


installed in the building.   





2014 Bond Prospectus, p. 104. 


Despite evidence that Rolta incurred capital expenditures to build the Gurgaon facility, it appears that this 


project was for the benefit Chairman’s private company! 


Publicly available records from the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs show that Rolta Limited, a 


private company owned and controlled by Chairman K.K. Singh, owns the building and land at 


Gurgaon.  The Indian records show that the Chairman’s private company, Rolta Limited, pledged the 


Gurgaon land as collateral to the Union Bank of India to secure a loan.

Furthermore, Rolta discloses that it pays Rolta Limited INR 156.4 million (US$ 2.5 mm) per annum to 


lease the Gurgaon building.
6
  If the facility was completed in 2010, Rolta has presumably paid an 


aggregate of INR 821 million (US$ 13 mm) simply to lease the property from the Chairman.  


We could find no evidence from Rolta’s annual reports or bond prospectuses that the Company ever 


received consideration for either selling the building to the Chairman or a reimbursement for the 


expenditures, therefore we presume that such expenditures are still on Rolta’s balance sheet.  





We believe that there are two likely explanations for this transaction.  Perhaps this transaction was a 


naked transfer of wealth from the public Company to the Chairman, and in that case, would underscore 


that the Chairman seems to run Rolta for his personal benefit (at the expense of the best interests of the 


Company and its bondholders) and that Rolta has consistently failed to achieve in the minimum level of 


transparency regarding its operations and business.  But it could also be another example in a long line of 


recurring expenditures for which Rolta has little or nothing to show, suggesting, in our opinion, that such 


capital expenditures were fabricated.    





6) Capital Expenditures Significantly Exceeds Guidance 





Typically, capital investment is reasonably foreseeable, especially in the near term.   Not for Rolta’s 


management team.  Despite annual (and typically quarterly) promises from Rolta’s management to limit 


capital spending, in reality Rolta’s capital expenditures significantly and routinely exceed management’s 


guidance.  Since 2009, Rolta has spent an average of 178% more on capital expenditures each year 


than it guided to analysts in Q1 or Q2.   





The following chart compares management earliest capital expenditures guidance (typically in Q1 or Q2) 


with amount that the Company reportedly spent on capital expenditures in that year. 








The following are particularly egregious examples of misleading guidance to analysts and investors.  On 


the 2011 Q2 earnings call, management claimed that capital expenditures were poised to decrease in the 


second half of FY 2011 and reiterated that it expected to spend a total of INR 3 billion (US$ 66 mm) for 


the entire year.  True to form, the Company actually spent INR 8.4 billion (US$ 185 mm) in FY 2011, 


with an additional INR 6.7 billion (US$ 148 mm) coming in the second half.

 2014 Bond Prospectus, p. F-29. Rolta paid Rolta Limited INR 117.3 million rent for the nine months ended March 31 2014, so

On the 2012 Q2 conference call, management stated that capital expenditures would not exceed INR 3 


billion (US$ 60 mm) for the year and reported spending INR 1.6 billion to INR 1.65 billion (US$ 32 to 33 


mm) in the first half.  The Company spent a further INR 12 billion (US$ 244 mm) in 2H 2012, meaning 


Rolta’s aggregate capital expenditures for the year were 364% higher than guided to analysts after the 


first half. 





In 2013, management guidance in Q1 was INR 3 billion (US$ 55 mm) for the year, even though Rolta 


ended up spending INR 17.5 billion (US$319 mm) for the year, 483% above what management told 


analysts to expect.  





Another example is particularly egregious.  In Rolta’s 2013 bond prospectus, the Company stated that its 


budgeted capital expenditures for FY 2013 (ending June) were US$ 200 million, of which Rolta had 


already spent US$ 143 million as of March 2013.
7
  However, in Rolta’s subsequent filings, the Company 


reported that capital expenditures for FY 2013 were US$ 350 million.
8
  In just three months, the 


Company spent an additional US$ 207 million, bringing its total expenditures for FY 2013 to 75% over 


budget.  How could management, in March 2013, not have foreseen such large capital expenditures in the 


last three months of the fiscal year?  





Management’s erroneous and misleading capital expenditures guidance suggests two alternatives.  First, 


management could be totally incompetent.  Capital expenditures are usually longer term investments, 


which those closest to the business should be able to reliably anticipate and model, at least in the near 


term.  Perhaps management is so incapable that they routinely fail to make even remotely correct 


assumptions about the near-term investments necessary to remain competitive and grow their business.  





The second possibility is more sinister.  Management could be deliberately misleading the market as to 


Rolta’s future capital expenditures because such expenditures are not driven by a business need or the 


Company’s strategy, but rather are an accounting gimmick designed to conceal fabricated earnings.  





We believe that the sinister explanation is most likely correct, simply because the Company, and the same 


management team, has manipulated capital expenditures to fabricate revenues once before.

PAST IS PROLOGUE – 2004 ACCOUNTING & TAX SCANDALS 





In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) concluded that Rolta had inappropriately 


inflated its reported revenue figures by including the cost of capital equipment transferred between its 


subsidiaries in its top-line sales figures for seven years.
9
   





For example, by recognizing the cost of capitalized fixed assets in its revenue figures, Rolta reported 


18.1% year-over-year revenue growth in 2001, despite the fact that the Company’s actual revenue growth 


was 7.3%.
10


  The following chart, taken from SEBI’s findings in its investigation, shows that Rolta 


artificially inflated sales by 12-34% each year from 1996 through 2001. 





 
Source: SEBI Order 








Sources: SEBI Order; Glaucus Calculation 








The obvious impact of the accounting manipulation was to boost the Company’s reported sales, 


misleading investors into believing that Rolta’s sales were both greater and growing faster than was true.  


This in turn artificially inflated Rolta’s stock price and presumably allowed the Company to raise more

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


money from the capital markets than it otherwise would have been able had it reported its true sales 


figures.  


 In July 2004, SEBI issued a show cause notice to the Company and declared that the practice was a 


violation of the provisions of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practice for its potential to 


mislead investors.
11








Despite evidence that Rolta systematically and repeatedly misled investors about its financial 


performance, SEBI merely ordered the Company to “discontinue its practice of including the cost of self-


assembled capital equipment or any capitalizable item in the sales/revenue henceforth, and not to adopt, 


in future, any accounting practice inconsistent with relevant Indian or international Accounting 


standards.”
12








This punishment seems extraordinarily light.  In our opinion, the practice of inflating revenue by 


including capitalized costs does not seem like an honest accounting error or a misinterpretation of an 


accounting standard – such a practice seems a deliberate manipulative action to artificially inflate a 


Company’s stock price by overstating reported financial performance.   





Rolta’s troubles continued.  In August 2004, just one month after SEBI’s show-cause notice, India’s 


Income Tax Department (ITD) deployed 100 agents to execute a simultaneous raid of the Company’s 


headquarters and nearly 24 other premises in an investigation alleging that Rolta claimed depreciation on 


fictitious assets in order to avoid taxes.  ITD agents also raided the residences of Rolta’s CEO and several 


directors.    





Ordinarily, evidence of possible accounting fraud from ten years ago may not concern bondholders – 


except in this case.  That is because, amazingly, neither the audit committee members nor the 


auditors who presided over the tax and accounting scandals were fired or replaced – they continued 


to serve the Company in the same functions until 2013!   





Independent director R.R. Kumar served as an independent director and a member of the audit committee 


from 1997 to November 2013.  K.R. Modi served as an independent director and a member of the audit 


committee from 1997 until the present day.  Both were independent directors and members of the audit 


committee during the period in which SEBI reported that Rolta inappropriately inflated revenues and in 


2004, when agents from the Indian Tax Department raided the Company’s offices.  





Likewise, Khandelwal Jain & Co served as the Company’s auditors from FY 1997 to FY 2013, including 


during the period from 1997-2001 during which Rolta reportedly manipulated capital expenditures to 


inflate its revenues.    





Unbelievably, despite the occurrence of major accounting and tax scandals, neither the independent 


directors nor the auditor were replaced.  To our knowledge, neither was any top level executive.

 CFO V.L. Ganesh resigned in 2006, but there is no indication that he resigned in connection with either the findings of 


accounting misconduct by SEBI nor the allegations of the ITD that Rolta claimed depreciation on fictitious assets to avoid taxes.

This is a significant red flag.   The audit committee members and the external auditor were either 


complicit in the inappropriate inflation of revenues or were not sufficiently vigilant or competent to detect 


it.  By even the most lax corporate governance standards, both should have been replaced following 


SEBI’s 2004 findings of material misrepresentations in Rolta’s financial statements.   





In our view, the tax and accounting scandals not only show that Rolta and its top-level managers have a 


propensity to manipulate the accounting of capital expenditures in order to artificially inflate financial 


performance, but also that the Company’s senior managers appear almost indifferent to the accounting, 


legal and ethical standards required to participate in global bond markets.

INVESTIGATIONS INTO ARMY CONTRACTS 


In 2011, Indian Defense Minister A.K. Antony reportedly ordered an investigation into possible 


corruption regarding a lucrative procurement contract that the Ministry of Defense awarded to Rolta.  


Neither the existence nor the results of this investigation were discussed in either of Rolta’s bond 


prospectuses (2013 or 2014) nor to our knowledge, ever disclosed to bondholders. 


In December 2011, respected Indian daily The Hindu published an investigative report alleging that the 


Indian army’s defense capabilities were compromised by flawed and possibly corrupt procurement 


contracts awarded to Rolta.  In 1996, the Ministry of Defense awarded a contract to Rolta to provide 


photogrammetric and geographical information system software to India’s military intelligence division, 


MI17.  The Hindu reported that in 2008, dubious negotiations relieved Rolta’s burden of upgrading the 


software, which reportedly resulted in a material degradation of performance.  


The investigative report alleged that procurement negotiations were possibly corrupt.  It pointed out that 


Brigadier Anjum Shahab, who was a member of the committee that renewed Rolta’s contract in 2008, 


went to work for Rolta shortly thereafter, raising the specter of a corrupt quid pro quo.  Indeed, Rolta’s 


2008-2009 Annual Report lists Shahab as its regional director of defense.   


The Hindu also alleged that under the contract, Rolta was supplying the Ministry of Defense with 


Integraph’s GIS software without a license, implying that rather than develop its own proprietary 


solutions, Rolta had simply misappropriated the intellectual property of an American company and resold 


under the Rolta brand name to the Indian Army.  


In 2011, following the investigative report, Indian Defense Minister A.K. Anthony reportedly ordered a 


full investigation into the allegations of corruption against Rolta.  Coverage of the investigation is not 


available – most likely because of the classified nature of defense proceedings.  


In January 2014, a television spot by Headlines Today reported that the Indian Army had begun 


investigation into secret surveillance equipment worth ~300 crore which the army had purchased from 


Rolta.  It is unclear whether the report referred to a new corruption investigation into defense contracts 


awarded to Rolta or is a continuation of 2011 investigation, but proceedings took a macabre turn.  


Headlines Today reported that Col. Sujit Banerjee, an Indian army officer was a key witness in the case 


against Rolta, was found dead in his hotel room before he was supposed to appear in a special 


deposition before the Army’s court of inquiry regarding the matter.
14





Allegations of corruption are troubling.  Reports of the suspicious death of a key witness against Rolta 


before he could testify are salacious.  But the failure to disclose the investigation or proceedings to 


bondholders is a material omission because this scandal could result in a fine or financial penalty and it 


could undermine Rolta’s eligibility to qualify for or obtain future contracts from the Ministry of Defense 


or the Indian Army.  Because the Indian government is Rolta’s primary source of revenue, the scandal 


could have a material impact on the Company’s future performance.

CHAIRMAN’S QUESTIONABLE DEALINGS 


We believe that Chairman K.K. Singh runs Rolta for his own benefit and to the detriment of other 


stakeholders.  The Company has continued to engage in a number of questionable transactions which 


appear to enrich its Chairman at the expense of the Company and bondholders.  


1) Dividends Funded by Borrowings 





Rolta has paid out an aggregate of INR 4 billion (US$ 82 mm) in dividends from 2008 through 2014.  


During this period, the Chairman owned between 40%-50% of the Company’s outstanding shares.  


Therefore, he was the primary beneficiary of any dividends declared and distributed by the Company.  


Normally, this would not be a problem, but in this case, Rolta pays out large dividends each year despite 


the fact that it fails to generate free cash flow because of its highly suspicious capital expenditures.  


 
Source: Company Filings 


The above graph illustrates that despite the fact that Rolta consistently fails to generate free cash flows, 


the Company aggressively pays out dividends for the primary benefit of its Chairman.  Rolta raises or 


borrows cash to pay such dividends, to the detriment to bondholders.   


2) Chairman’s Murky Compensation Structure 





Nor is Rolta remotely transparent regarding the Chairman’s compensation.  It discloses to bondholders 


that K.K. Singh’s is compensated through a commission calculated on the net profits of the Company, but 


does not disclose either the amount of such commission nor how it is calculated.

A public record search on the website of India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) shows that K.K. 


Singh is entitled to 5% of the net profits of the Company and various other amenities, including 


servants.  





Source: MCA Public Records 


This incentive structure seems to be arbitrarily applied, because in FY 2012, Rolta paid Chairman Singh 


INR 61 million (US$ 1.2 mm) even though Rolta reported a net loss.  Even by Wall St. standards, a 


compensation package entitling the Chairman to 5% of net profits appears shamefully generous.  But at 


the very least, the Chairman should abide by this deal when the Company loses money.   


In addition, the Company amended a royalty agreement in 2012 to license the right to use the ‘Rolta’ 


trademark from a K.K. Singh-owned shell company.  In exchange, Rolta agreed to pay the Chairman 


0.2% of the Company’s annual revenues.
16


   In 2013 and 2014, Rolta has already paid the Chairman 


almost INR 96 million (US$ 1.7 mm) simply to use the trademark.
17





The Chairman’s commission for the use of the trademark ‘Rolta’ is especially egregious because for the 


22 years prior to 2012 amendment, K.K. Singh assigned the brand name to the Company royalty free.
18





In our opinion, it appears that the more cash Rolta is able to borrow from foreign creditors, the greater the 


Chairman’s appetite.  


The problem with the Chairman’s murky compensation structure is that it clearly incentivizes him to use 


accounting gimmicks to artificially inflate both revenues and profits when the Company’s underlying 


performance is middling or poor.  K.K. Singh presided over Rolta when the Company inappropriately 


manipulated its reported financial performance from 1997-2001, which in our view, creates a reasonable 


suspicion that given the proper incentives, he might do so again.

MYTH OF ROLTA 


In rating Rolta’s 2014 corporate bonds BB-, Fitch relied on Rolta’s “profitability levels [and] ability to 


generate free cash flows.”  Indeed, Rolta reports world-class EBITDA margins (typically ~35%) and 


supposedly generates cash from operations.  But a deeper look undermines both supposed pillars of 


Rolta’s bond rating.   





1) Rolta’s +70% Indian EBITDA Margins are Not Credible 
 


Although Rolta reports consolidated EBITDA margins of ~35%, Rolta’s North American business 


operates at a loss, meaning that such reported profitability is driven by EBITDA margins from Indian 


operations which have topped 70% in FYs 2013 and 2014.  Such disparities are not driven by inter-


company transactions or transfer pricing between Rolta’s subsidiaries, as Rolta discloses few related party 


transactions between off-shore subsidiaries and the Indian parent company.

As the above charts make clear, Rolta’s North American business is a loss leader, and the profitability so 


critical to the Company’s bond rating is driven by an Indian subsidiary which reported EBITDA margins 


of 71% in FYs 2013 and 2014.   We struggle to understand how Rolta could post 70%+ EBITDA margins 


when Oracle, a technology solutions leader which owns and builds the software platforms upon which 


many of Rolta’s ‘solutions’ are based, reports 46% EBITDA margins. 





It is also critical to note that even though Rolta’s North American business contributes an increasing 


amount of the Company’s revenues (and is the primary driver of revenue growth), it is Rolta’s Indian 


business which owns of the vast majority of the Company’s non-current assets and which binges on 


questionable capital expenditures.

The 71% EBITDA margin reported in FYs 2013 and 2014 by Rolta’s Indian operation is a priori not 


credible.  But it is even more suspicious that Rolta’s Indian business is also the asset-heavy subsidiary 


which engages in a pattern of capital spending which, in our opinion, appears clearly fabricated.   





The implications are profound for bondholders.  A pillar of Fitch’s rating on Rolta’s bonds was the 


Company’s supposed profitability.  But upon closer examination such figures appear not credible, and 


support evidence discussed in this report suggesting in our opinion, that Rolta’s fabricated capital 


expenditures are simply masking overstated earnings.   





2) No Free Cash Flow 
 


The second pillar of Rolta’s bond rating, a record of generating free cash flow, is simply not true. If 


bondholders also consider Rolta’s questionable capital expenditures, Rolta has failed to generate free 


cash flow in any year since 2006.  It is not even close.  That is why despite such spectacular profitability, 


Rolta is a serial capital raiser.

Rolta does not generate free cash despite reporting staggering profitability because such cash is “spent” 


on capital expenditures of dubious authenticity.  This is a significant red flag and similar to China Metal 


Recycling and China Lumena, two listed companies which collapsed under suspicion of fraud following 


our whistle-blower reports to the markets.   





Ultimately, the two pillars of Rolta’s bond rating, profitability and free cash flow, are undermined by a 


deep dive into the Company’s capital expenditures.  We do not believe that Rolta’s business is profitable, 


and evidence shows it fails to generate cash – yet bondholders and ratings agencies appear to have failed, 


thus far, to price such details into either the value or ratings of Rolta’s bonds.  Yet.

VALUATION 


History may not repeat itself, but it rhymes.  In 2004, an investigation by Indian securities regulators 


found that Rolta’s management team manipulated the accounting of capital expenditures to inflate the 


Company’s revenue figures and thereby materially misled investors.  Despite the scandal, the Rolta’s 


auditor, Chairman, CEO and audit committee members did not resign and were not fired.  We believe that 


something similar is going on today.   





Rolta’s shares rallied recently on news that it was part of one of two consortiums selected in the final 


round to bid for the Ministry of Defense’s BMS contract.  This rally seems premature.  Rolta, together 


with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), has yet to win the contract – it must compete in the final stage 


with a rival consortium led by India’s Tata Power and Larsen & Toubro.  Moreover, any revenue or 


profits generated by this contract, if Rolta’s consortium wins, will only be realized in four-five years (at 


the earliest), by which time we expect Rolta’s serial capital raising scheme to have long unraveled.  One 


propsective contract does not change Rolta’s proclivity for deceit nor will make a losing business 


suddenly a winner.   





Fitch rated Rolta’s Junk Bonds BB- because of the Company’s “current profitability [and] ability to 


generate free cash flow].”  Rolta tells bondholders that its debt to EBITDA ratio is ~4 to 1 (as of Q3 


2015).   





But based on the evidence and analysis presented in this report, we believe that Rolta has fabricated its 


reported capital expenditures in order to mask fabricated EBITDA.  Such capital expenditures have easily 


exceeded reported EBITDA, meaning, in our view, that Rolta’s Indian business is not profitable and does 


not (and will not) generate sufficient cash to service its debt or repay it upon maturity.    





Because foreign creditors must attempt to enforce their rights through India’s byzantine, corrupt and slow 


judicial system, we think that any recovery of assets in India will be very difficult if not impossible.   





Indian bankruptcy law offers few protections for foreign creditors.  In the recent past, several Indian 


companies have defaulted on foreign currency bonds, including Zenith Infotech, which defaulted on 


foreign bonds in the fall of 2011.  As of today, despite the filing of petitions for the winding up of the 


firm, foreign lenders have not obtained any meaningful recovery.   





In October 2012, troubled Indian firm Suzlon Energy defaulted on $200 million in foreign currency 


bonds, which triggered a cross default on $270 million of other high yield bonds maturing in 2014 and 


2016.  Suzlon attempted to raise capital in India to repay bondholders, but in 2013, Indian banks 


participating in the firm’s restructuring forbade any cash payments to foreign debtors from the proceeds 


raised from Indian banks.  Suzlon forced foreign bondholders into a restructuring.   





The lesson of Suzlon and Zenith is that it is almost impossible for foreign bondholders to enforce a claim 


in India or to achieve any meaningful recovery assets located in India.  In our opinion, bondholders will 


likely suffer a similar fate with Rolta.  Therefore, we think the bonds are worth the recovery value of the 


offshore (i.e. non-Indian) assets.   





Unfortunately for bondholders, Rolta’s non-Indian business loses money.  The Company discloses that 


only two of its offshore subsidiaries generated EBT in 2014:

As discussed, we believe that the profitability of Rolta’s Indian business is fabricated.  If we assign a very 


generous multiple of 7x trailing EBT for the two offshore subsidiaries that appear to at least break even 


(Rolta UK and recent acquisition AdvizeX), in a recovery scenario such businesses are unlikely to be 


worth more than US$ 26.6 million.   





Assuming that Rolta kept US$ 50 million of cash from its recent bond offering offshore (67% of its cash 


balance as of Q3 2015), combined with US$ 5.8 million in offshore fixed assets (mostly real property), 


we estimate that offshore creditors will recover US$ 0.16 cents on the dollar.

Even this valuation of US$ 0.16 on the dollar is generous, because it assumes US$ 50 million in offshore 


cash and 7x multiple on Rolta’s subsidiaries that generated positive EBT in 2014.  Rolta could easily have 


moved most of the proceeds of its recent capital-raise to India, out of the reach of bondholders and 


foreign creditors.  In addition, Rolta UK, one the two subsidiaries that generated positive EBT in 2014, 


was unprofitable from FY 2011-2013, so it is unlikely that creditors will sell the subsidiary for a 7x FY 


2014 multiple.   





Ultimately, we believe that Rolta’s dubious capital expenditures are a smoking gun indicating that far 


from the profitable and cash-flow-generating business that bondholders and ratings agencies thought they 


were evaluating, in reality Rolta’s business is not profitable, and does not and will not generate 


sufficient cash to service its foreign debt or repay bondholders upon maturity (without 


refinancing). 





We believe that neither bondholders nor ratings agencies have priced such information into Rolta’s 


Delaware bonds.  This was avoidable.  After all, Rolta has done this before.
