Summary


IPO Analysis Tech


The IPO market is more about controlling float these days then anything else.


Shack Shake and GoPro are great examples of what happens to hyped up IPOs
with low floats that got manipulated to outrageous prices. In the end they crash.


Twilio and Acacia Communications are just the next in the line of these low-float
IPOs destined to crash.


To truly understand why Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Acacia Communications
(NASDAQ:ACIA) are great short candidates, you need to understand the IPO market
and how it has evolved over the last 10 years.


I will not get into the businesses of each company and the future prospects, as that is
not what this article is about. Please see this article from Bert Hochfeld to further
understand Twilio and this article from Jonathan Faison to further understand Acacia
Communications.

In my opinion the IPO market and the Investment Banks that participate in the IPO
market are one of top things that is wrong with capital markets. The way that IPOs are
traditionally executed is a very inefficient way to allocate capital and could be eliminated
incredibly easily. The only major IPO that I believe was executed fairly was the Google
(GOOG) IPO of 2004.


For those that don't remember Google used a Dutch Auction style IPO that is known as
an OpenIPO. A Dutch Auction IPO offers a better view of the market demand for shares
of the company than the traditional IPO where a Investment Bank try to sell shares to
institutions individually. In a proper Dutch Auction IPO any investor can participate. In a
traditional IPO only large institutional players can participate, sometime allocating
shares to their customers if available. Going back to simple supply and demand
economics, if you reduce the amount of demand by reducing the potential amount of
investors you decrease the equilibrium price.

Conclusion is that a Dutch Auction yields a higher IPO price near the equilibrium.
Traditional IPOs have to offer a discount to the presumed equilibrium price for
institutions in order to get them to participate in an IPO as they are taking on a lot of risk
buying a big stake in a company that no one yet knows how the market will value.


Because of the fact a Dutch Auction actually prices an IPO at the equilibrium price it
does not offer the same chance at a one day pop that traditional IPOs do (because they
are intentionally underpriced in a traditional IPO).


Investment Bankers love the traditional IPO model as they are in control of the supply
and demand. They get paid a hefty fee and they get free options to buy shares at the
IPO price at some point in the future. The options usually pay out as the IPO price is
intentionally discounted.


These criticisms have been know for many years and the Investment Bankers in the IPO
market are clever enough to figure out ways to game the system to keep their cash cow
IPO Model keep churning. They keep the IPO game going by selling CFOs that they can
offer a more controlled Environment for the company to go public by keeping supply of
shares below demand.


Low-Float, High-Hype IPOs


Low Float IPOs are IPOs in which the actual amount of shares sold to the public is lower
then 20% of the outstanding shares in the company. By keeping the amount of publicly
tradable float very low you are attempting to use the Supply and Demand Curve in your
favor by reducing the supply. When supply falls prices rise. This can also cause issues
in regards to efficient markets, as markets without proper liquidity are not efficient. Many
low float IPOs are closely held by large institutions that don't allow a borrow for short
sellers on their shares. Without a reasonable borrow for short sellers efficient markets
do not properly function leading to a bubble in the price of shares.

While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market
by 47%. 


There are other manipulative techniques that IPOs use. Many IPOs now a days use
multiple share classes, complicated LLC structures, and other methods in a effort to
confuse investors about the total ownership structure of the company at the time of the
IPO. Shack Shake and Habit Restaurants used a complicated LLC structure, while
Twilio used multiple shares classes. Investors often do not take the time to look for other
dilutive instruments as well that have become common in these IPOs. Things like the
options, earn outs, acquisition related commitments, restricted stock, warrants, and
other convertibles will effect the ownership stakes of publics shareholders.


All of these elements I deem as manipulative in the process used by institutions to make
money from gullible investors. Don't get me wrong many traders also make a ton of
money riding these IPOs up and eventually down, and they usually know that these
IPOs are trading vehicles, not investments. Unfortunately someone is always left to hold
the bag.


How the Manipulation Ends: Lock-Up Expiration


These low float high hype IPOs tend to start trending down about a 2 months or so
before lock up expiration in anticipation. See explanation of Lock Up Agreements and
expiration here.


Lets compare some metrics between the last two well known low float high hype IPOs,
GoPro and Shack Shake with Twilio and Acacia.
