INTRODUCTION 
 


Sino Grandness is a Singapore listed food and beverage manufacturer with operations in China.  The 


Company has two distinct business lines: a) canning of fruits and vegetables primarily for the export 


market and b) manufacturing and distribution of branded beverages for the Chinese domestic market.  


We believe that the shares of Sino Grandness present a compelling short opportunity with a return 


potential of nearly 100% as current reported earnings significantly overstate actual earnings.   





We have conducted months of due diligence and hired local researchers to aid in our investigative 


efforts.  In addition to scouring filings and performing typical public records searches, we procured 


Euromonitor and Nielsen data, visited over 80 retail sites, had dozens of conversations with distributors, 


retailers, former employees, competitors, contract manufacturers, and other sources, and visited the 


Company’s three internal beverage production sites.  Based on our extensive research, we have come 


to a view that published financials have been materially misrepresented.  Importantly, as we lay out 


in detail below, we believe published financials and the true economics of the business will be 


scrutinized imminently and will likely lead to a substantial dilution and/or impairment of the 


Company's equity. 





Sino Grandness needs to IPO its beverage subsidiary, Garden Fresh (HK) Fruit & Vegetable Beverage Co., 


Limited (“Garden Fresh”), on an internationally recognized exchange by October 2014 in order to 


comply with the terms of its convertible bonds and avoid a large redemption payment.

 Please note that the 2011 convertible bonds mature on October 19, 2014 but bondholders have an option to extend the maturity to June 30,

, failure to list 


Garden Fresh will likely lead to a massive dilution of the equity.   





The company has been clear in its preference for a Hong Kong listing.  Tighter listing requirements and 


tepid investor demand are already causing Hong Kong listing plans to be abandoned at other companies.  


Notably, sponsors now face criminal liability if misstatements are found in the prospectus.  It appears 


Sino Grandness is already behind schedule on its listing plans.  As of our latest check, Sino Grandness 


had still not filed a Form A1 to list on the Hong Kong Exchange, which analysts had expected to happen 


already in order to list by October.   





In our opinion, research coverage has been very weak to date.  Sino Grandness is covered by 5 analysts 


who are Singapore based and cover S-Chips, whereas Hong Kong listed China beverage companies are 


covered by Hong Kong based consumer analysts.  Even modest improvements in coverage or basic IPO 


due diligence, such as obtaining Euromonitor or Nielsen data, should result in regulators, 


underwriters, and investors agreeing with our conclusion that earnings are massively overstated.  We 


believe this will most likely lead to a failed IPO, ultimately rendering shares of Sino Grandness 


practically worthless.    





Summary:  





1. Reputable third party data sources such as Euromonitor and Nielsen suggest reported Garden 


Fresh revenues are significantly overstated.  Sino Grandness beverage segment (Garden Fresh) 


reported sales of RMB 1.382 billion in 2013, which we believe would imply at least RMB 2.0 


billion in sales at retail value.  Garden Fresh does not appear in the top 23 of Euromonitor data 


or the top 13 of Nielsen data, which is as far as either company breaks out the data.   The #23 


on the Euromonitor list had retail sales of RMB 77 million and the #13 on the Nielsen list had 


retail sales of RMB 135 million, which we believe suggests reported sales overstate actual 


sales by at least 15-26x.  Major investment banks with analysts covering China juices companies 


subscribe to Euromonitor.  Furthermore, key beverage manufacturers listed on the HKEx, such 


as Tingyi, Uni-President, and China Huiyuan, reference Nielsen data in their filings.  We believe 


that if and when regulators, underwriters, analysts and investors inevitably scrutinize this 


data, they will see a company materially overstating revenues which will most likely derail the 


IPO.   





2. Our channel checks, which consisted of speaking with distributors, retailers, former 


employees, competitors, contract manufacturers, and other sources, uncovered 


overwhelmingly negative feedback regarding Garden Fresh trends and outlook and cast 


significant doubt on the reported size of the business.  Sales of Garden Fresh products were

described as “disappointing,” “not selling well,” and even “shrinking.”  Distributors have 


indicated an interest in terminating their distributorships.  The Company is “not well known” 


and several industry participants we spoke with outright doubted the reported sales level.  


Our site visits found the Company’s beverage production facilities essentially idle.  We believe 


the Company has overstated its external capacity, based on our research into and 


conversations with its contract manufacturers, which further casts doubts on reported sales 


levels.  In our opinion, the feedback we gathered is wildly inconsistent with reported sales levels 


and growth.   





3. Benchmarking key metrics to industry peers supports the idea that sales are overstated.  


Compared to industry peers, Garden Fresh sales personnel purportedly generate 3x the sales 


while costing 1/2 as much to employ, meaning “sales return on sales labor” is purportedly 6x 


peer levels.  Furthermore, when measured as a percentage of sales, Garden Fresh spends 1/4 


as much on advertising & promotion as industry peers despite being an unrecognized new 


entrant lacking scale in a competitive market.  





4. Margins are unbelievably high.  Garden Fresh reported EBIT margins of 25-30% are almost as 


high as the 30-35% gross margins of leading industry peers such as Tingyi, Uni-President, and 


China Huiyuan.  Garden Fresh’s 2013 reported EBIT margin of 27.8% was 7.9x the median EBIT 


margin of peers.  





5. While we believe the beverages business is the most significant driver of value at Sino 


Grandness, and thus the focus of our research efforts, we also see evidence to suggest the 


vegetable canning business has overstated earnings: 


a. We believe the Company overstated the market for canned asparagus in its IPO 


prospectus by a factor of 4x.  


b. Company reported sales have completely bucked market trends.  Despite already 


purportedly being the largest company in the industry, Sino Grandness reported its 


asparagus sales increased by 127% from 2007 to 2013 while the overall market 


declined 40%.   


c. Specifically in 2008, we believe there is a large inconsistency with the Company 


reporting substantially increased sales volumes while the market, production 


volumes, and employees decreased substantially.  Furthermore, a former employee 


recounted that sales volumes were down in 2008.  Sino Grandness reported total sales 


volume increased 31% year-on-year, which we find highly inconsistent with China 


canned asparagus exports (down 22% year-over-year), internal production volumes 


(decreased 35% year-over-year), and full-time employees (decreased 40% year-over-


year).   


d. Reported profitability is completely out of line relative to peers.  Sino Grandness reports 


EBIT margins of over 20% for canning private label vegetables compared to the 5-6% 


reported by peers.  Sino Grandness margins even exceed those of global branded food 


manufacturers.
4 | P a g e  








6. The Company has never generated free cash flow as reported profits have been consumed by 


accounts receivable and capital expenditures.  Despite reporting cumulative net profits of RMB 


1.1 billion from 2006-2013, cumulative free cash flow has been negative RMB 463 million, 


leading to share or convertible bond issuances every year since going public in 2009.  With the 


announcement of its massive Anhui facility and indications that the company is expanding 


upstream into farming, it looks like any prospect of free cash flow generation is in the distant 


future.  We have commonly found that companies misrepresenting financials report spectacular 


profitability while burning cash and requiring constant capital raises.   





7. Given the upcoming bond maturities and capital expenditure requirements, we believe the 


stock is effectively worthless.  We believe Sino Grandness is worth no more than RMB 800-900 


million, which translates to RMB S$0.03-S$0.06 per share ignoring the need to raise capital.  


This is based on 1.5x EV/Sales for the beverages business and the assumption that sales are only 


5x overstated (despite evidence suggesting sales could be overstated by 25x or more) and a 3x 


“suspected fraud” multiple on reported earnings for the canned vegetable business.  If Sino 


Grandness does not list its Garden Fresh subsidiary in short order, it will face convertible bond 


redemption payments totaling up to RMB 723 million.  Furthermore, the Company has a RMB 


600 million investment plan in Anhui, bringing total capital requirements to RMB 1.32 billion, 


against a mere RMB 60.2 million in reported cash.  We believe that the required equity 


issuance is so massive relative to the true equity value of the Company that the current shares 


are practically worthless.
5 | P a g e  





HISTORY AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 


Sino Grandness was founded in 1997 as a trader of canned products.
4
  After what has been recounted as 


“an arduous two year process,” the Company went public in November 2009.  This was the tail end of an 


unfolding wave of S-Chip scandals which saw the FTSE ST China Index down about 70% from October 


2007 to October 2009. 





At IPO, the Company’s primary business was the manufacture and export of canned fruits and 


vegetables.  In 2008, 45% of sales were asparagus, 24% long beans, 17% mushrooms, and 14% others 


such as sweet corn and fruits.  About 98% of sales were outside China, with 83% of sales being to 


Europe.
5
  





These products were sold to a concentrated base of Western Europe discounters primarily for their 


private label or house brands.  In 2008, the top 3 customers were 65% of sales and the top 8 customers 


were 82% of sales.  Lidl was the largest customer at 40.8% of sales, and other notable customers were I 


Schmidt, Calkins, Golden Gate, REWE, Huepeden (supplier to Aldi), Compare, and Siplec.
6
  The Company 


has also claimed to sell to Carrefour, Walmart, and Metro.
7
 The economics of this business were 


phenomenal.  The company earned unbelievable 20% EBIT margins for being in what we would have 


thought was a commoditized and competitive business, selling to a concentrated group of price 


sensitive and sophisticated buyers.   





By mid-2010, the stock had gone from a high of SG$0.24 to SG$0.10 and looked destined to follow the 


lead set by numerous S-Chip predecessors.  Meanwhile, given reported profitability and the fact that in 


its IPO prospectus Sino Grandness had suggested it would payout 20% of net profits as dividends, 


investors might have been expecting dividend checks. 





Then in January 2011, the Company stumbled upon its opportunity to cancel the dividend, become a 


serial capital raiser, and perhaps rejuvenate the stock price.  The opportunity was a new business 


venture to manufacture and distribute loquat juice under the Garden Fresh (鲜绿园) brand.  In just a 


few short years, the Company has purportedly become one of the top players in China juices with EBIT 


margins of 25-30% which are almost as high as the 30-35% Gross Margins of domestic heavyweights.  


Amazingly, Sino Grandness pulled this off despite its heritage of being an export business, with no juice 


manufacturing capability, and de minimis A&P spend.   





Shortly thereafter, Sino Grandness looked set to capitalize on its newfound success by listing Taiwan 


Depository Receipts on the TSE.  However, this plan was later abandoned, and instead the Garden Fresh

subsidiary raised capital by issuing onerous convertible bonds.  These bonds convert to Garden Fresh 


equity at a P/E of 5-6x and, in the event Garden Fresh does not list, carry IRRs of up to 25%. 





Sino Grandness must now list Garden Fresh on an internationally recognized exchange by October 2014 


to avoid redemption.  The Company hopes to list on the Hong Kong Exchange with a value of SG$750 


million based on “a ‘conservative’ 15 times price-earnings ratio”.  There’s just one small problem.  Even 


the most basic due diligence will uncover that reported financials are materially misrepresented and 


derail the IPO process.

SINO GRANDNESS BEVERAGES (“GARDEN FRESH”) 
 


Given the Beverages segment (“Garden Fresh”) is the largest segment, has been a key point of analyst 


and investor enthusiasm, and the convertible bonds are linked to its listing, it has been the focal point of 


our due diligence efforts.   





Exhibit 1: Sino Grandness Segmental Results 


 
Source: Company filings  





Sino Grandness first entered the domestic Chinese beverage market in 2009 with the launch of a canned 


herbal beverage product,
8
 but the Company’s big break occurred in January 2011 with the launch of 


loquat juice purportedly after a member of the R&D staff noticed that there were many loquat farms 


near the Sichuan plant.  Loquat is a niche fruit in China most known as an herbal remedy to sooth the 


throat and lungs.   





Garden Fresh is purportedly focused on the high juice content segment of the market, which is typically 


defined as 100% Juices and Nectars (26-99% Juice).  The Company’s common products would be 100% 


Loquat Juice, 50% Concentrate Loquat Juice, and then a variety of lower concentrate mixed juices such 


as Loquat Pear, Icy Loquat, Loquat Peach, and Loquat Mango.   








Sino Grandness has reported to investors that Garden Fresh is a rapidly growing and highly profitable 


business 





The table below highlights reported sales and operating profits for the Beverages segment (“Garden 


Fresh”).  We have also included China Huiyuan reported juice sales (excludes “other beverage 


products”).

Exhibit 2: Sino Grandness Beverages Segment (“Garden Fresh”) Summary Financials 


 
Source: Company filings, newman9 analysis 





We think there are a few things to notice and keep in mind.  First, Garden Fresh is purportedly rapidly 


growing as illustrated by >100% sales CAGR and 60% sales growth in 2013.  Second, Garden Fresh is 


purportedly highly profitable with reported 27%+ EBIT margins.  Lastly, Garden Fresh is now large 


enough that it should be highly visible and well-known by industry participants, given reported sales are 


over 1/3 those reported by China Huiyuan (the fourth largest company in the overall juice market and 


the largest company in the high content segments).      








Data from reputable third parties such as Euromonitor suggests Garden Fresh revenues are massively 


overstated… 





In 2013, Garden Fresh reported revenues of RMB 1.382 billion.  We believe markups are at least 50%, 


which would lead to retail sales of more than RMB 2.0 billion.
9
  Euromonitor estimates the retail sales 


value for the #10 company, Xiamen Huierkang Group Co Ltd, to have been RMB 1.4 billion in 2013.  As 


such, we would have certainly expected to find Garden Fresh listed in the top 10.  Garden Fresh was not 


even found in the top 23, which is as far as Euromonitor breaks out the data.  The #23 company, 


Bright Food (Group) Co Ltd, had estimated retail sales value of RMB 77 million.  Please note that we 


have vetted the list below to ensure that these companies are distinct from Sino Grandness and/or 


Garden Fresh (which should hopefully be clear based on the “Global Brand Names”).

 Markup would need to capture both a distributor and retailer markup.  As an example, our channel checks found the wholesale price of 50% 


Loquat Juice was RMB 3.30-3.80 per 500mL bottle which was retailing at RMB 5.80-7.00 (53-112% markup).

Exhibit 3: Euromonitor Total China Juice Market – Company Share and Sales 


 
Source: Euromonitor, newman9 analysis 





As part of its research process, Euromonitor carries out extensive conversations with leading 


manufacturers, distributors, and trade associations to develop a consensus view of the total size of the 


market and share for each major player.  It is our understanding that very little information about 


Garden Fresh could be found during trade interviews and hence the Company was excluded from the 


Euromonitor data.  We believe that Garden Fresh not showing up in the top 10 (let alone top 23) of 


Euromonitor estimates and industry participants having little to say about the Company is consistent 


with the company overstating its revenues. 





Upon entering the beverages market, Sino Grandness referenced Euromonitor data in its August 2010 


multiple distributorship agreements press release.  A keyword search of Company filings and releases 


returns no references to Euromonitor subsequent to that.  We wonder why.   





We believe that Hong Kong beverage analysts at the major banks subscribe to Euromonitor data and 


that the glaring inconsistency between Company reported revenue and sell-out as captured by 


Euromonitor will become quite obvious to the market.

…which is corroborated by objective Nielsen scanner data 





A criticism of Euromonitor data is that it is somewhat subjective and relies heavily on conversations with 


industry participants as well as company furnished information.  However, the work done by 


Euromonitor is further corroborated by Nielsen, which uses objective scanner data.  Garden Fresh is not 


found in the top 13, which is as far as Nielsen breaks out the data.  Nielsen shows the #13 company, 


Beiqi, had estimated retail sales value of RMB 135 million.   





Exhibit 4: Nielsen Total China Juice Market – Company Share and Sales

Garden Fresh is particularly focused on the high juice content segment (100% juices and Nectars which 


are 26-99% juice).  So just to make sure we weren’t missing something, we looked at those segments in 


more detail.  Garden Fresh does not show up in the top 5 in either the 100% Juices or Nectars (25-99% 


Juices) markets.

We believe that Garden Fresh not showing up in the top 13 overall juice companies or the top 5 of the 


high concentrate segments of the Nielsen data is consistent with the company overstating its 


revenues.  It is common for HK-listed juice manufacturers, such as Tingyi, Uni-President, and China 


Huiyuan, to reference Nielsen data in their filings.  We believe that during the IPO due diligence 


process, relevant parties will uncover that Garden Fresh reported revenues are materially overstated.   








Brand research conducted by the Chinese government supports Euromonitor and Nielsen data 





The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC publishes the China Brand Power Index 


annually.  This index is designed to capture brand strength and utilizes extensive surveying conducted by 


the MIIT.  In order to make the list, there is a minimum threshold for unaided brand awareness.  We 


think that it is reasonable to expect companies with high unaided brand awareness to also have high 


market shares.  In the table below, we show the 2013 C-BPI rank for the juice industry compared to the 


rank according to Euromonitor and Nielsen.  We have also included two additional companies from the 


2012 list which didn’t make the 2013 list.  We believe the high degree of overlap between these three 


sources helps affirm the validity of the data.

We similarly found a high degree of overlap between these three sources in the 100% juices segment of 


the market.  Unfortunately, the MIIT does not provide a brand index for the nectars segment of the 


market, although we again found good overlap between Euromonitor and Nielsen.

Channel checks consistent with overstated revenues 





Our channel checks are consistent with the Company materially overstating revenues.  With the help 


of our researchers, we had dozens of conversations with distributors, retailers, former employees, 


competitors, contract manufacturers, and other sources.  Additionally, our researchers visited over 80 


retail sites to observe the product and speak with retailers.  Our researchers’ site visits were conducted 


both at mom-and-pop stores and modern channel retailers, which have been estimated to be 60% and 


40% of revenues, respectively.  Company and sell-side reports have suggested Vanguard, Ren Ren Le, 7-


Eleven, Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco, Century Mart, and JUSCO are beverage customers so our modern 


channel site visits and conversations focused on these companies.  The site visits were largely focused in 


Guandong and Zhejiang provinces, which are estimated to be a combined 50% of sales.  





In addition to its internal capacity, Garden Fresh has three external contract manufacturers, located in 


Beijing, Fujian, and Zhejiang.  Our researchers were able to identify and speak with sources at all three 


contract manufacturers and additionally one former contract manufacturer.   





While the product does exist and can be found on shelves, the feedback we received was 


overwhelmingly negative and casts significant doubt on the quantum and direction of reported sales.  


Specifically some of our observations and feedback: 





 A purchasing manager for a large supermarket indicated Garden Fresh is “so small as to be 


negligible” and that sales volume has been “disappointing.” 


 A purchasing manager for a another large supermarket suggested Garden Fresh sales were 80% 


lower than his supermarket had expected and were a tiny fraction of his Huiyuan sales.  He 


felt that the sales levels reported by Garden Fresh were “highly doubtful.”   


 A distributor said most of his clients “have not come back with second orders,” that he will not 


order more Garden Fresh products in the near future because they “are not popular,” and that 


he is thinking about terminating the contract with Garden Fresh. 


 Another distributor said Garden Fresh products “have not been selling well” as many retailers 


only purchased from him once since summer 2013 and their first orders were of “small quantity 


intended to gauge market acceptance.”  He suggested he might sever his distributorship.

 Convenience store owners advised Garden Fresh “does not sell well” while some corner shops 


even suggested Garden Fresh loquat juice sales are “shrinking.”  


 A provincial manager at a large competitor indicated industry participants don’t recognize the 


name and he doubts Garden Fresh actually achieved the sales the Company reported.  


 A regional sales manager at another competitor indicated that he “almost doesn’t see Garden 


Fresh products.”  He thought that Garden Fresh would be at most 1/3 to 1/2 the size of his 


company (his company does juice sales of around RMB 250 million) and that the sales figures 


as reported by Garden Fresh are “way too high.”    


 Typically Garden Fresh products had only a couple facings on shelves and were found in 


unfavorable locations such as the bottom of the gondola.  We also heard and observed that 


production dates printed on bottles suggest slow turns.  Most of the bottles we checked during 


July/August 2014 had 2013 production dates.    


 It was very difficult to locate the products in Chengdu.  This strikes us as odd given the 


Company’s purported success at the Chengdu Trade Exhibition and also its local production 


facility (the Sichuan facility is located in Chengdu City).  What little product we found in 


Chengdu was produced by a contract manufacturer, not by Garden Fresh.  Given high 


transportation costs in the beverage industry, we think it makes little sense to use anything 


other than the Chengdu facility to supply Chengdu retailers (unless of course the Chengdu 


facility is sitting idle…which we believe that to be the case as we will discuss later).   


 A source at a former contract manufacturer suggested production volumes were never 


particularly high given the seasonal nature of loquat and that the relationship has now come 


to an end.  


 A source at a current contract manufacturer indicated the contract with Garden Fresh is 


relatively small and believed that sales of the loquat products have not been good.  


 A source at a second current contract manufacturer said that while the arrangement is still 


ongoing, it is with significantly less volume than before.  The source further mentioned that he 


is not optimistic about Garden Fresh’s business and that many brands have tried to sell loquat 


juice and failed.  


 A source at a third current contract manufacturer indicated that the orders from Garden Fresh 


have been quite small.  





Is this the feedback you would expect to hear about a rapidly growing brand with reported sales 


implying it should be in the top 10 of the overall market or top 2 of its target segments?  We think this 


feedback is not consistent with Company reported financials, but rather is quite consistent with our 


suspicion of materially misrepresented financials.   








Garden Fresh factories are sitting idle…  





Our researchers visited the Company’s three beverage production sites located in Sichuan, Hubei, and 


Anhui.  There was little indication that the Sichuan factory was even operating during the two days our 



http://www.finanznachrichten.de/pdf/20130415_190417_JS5_7231835AF1B8A20A48257B4E003B577A.1.pdf
14 | P a g e  





researchers observed the factory.  During the first day, the gate was closed and no vehicles entered or 


exited the complex.  Our researchers saw 5 workers leave between 12:00-1:30pm, 4 enter around 


2:30pm, and then 5 leave around 6pm.  On the second day, one mid-size truck with a packaging 


company’s name on the door entered the factory.  Sources suggested the factory currently operates at 


less than 10,000 tonnes, compared to purported capacity of 70,000-100,000 tonnes.
10


  Recall that the 


product we found in Chengdu had been produced by a contract manufacturer – we are thus not 


surprised that the Sichuan factory is essentially idle.   





Our researchers similarly found no sign of production within the Hubei factory, which was supposed 


to be operational in 4Q13 and have up to 200,000 tonnes capacity this year.  During the first day, there 


were no wagons or trucks entering or exiting the main gate.  On the second day, an empty truck entered 


the complex at 9am and remained idle while workers loaded small red boxes onto the vehicle.  We do 


not know what was in the boxes, but we doubt it was juice products.  The truck remained at the factory 


that evening.   





For reference, we would have expected to see much more activity.  Output of 70,000 tonnes per year 


translates to approximately 560,000 bottles per day making the assumptions that we are talking about  


500 mL bottles, 1 fl. oz. weighs 1 oz., and production is done 24 hours per day, 5 days a week.  This 


would translate to about 37,000 cartons (15 bottles/carton) which would each have something like 0.5 


cubic feet of volume.  If typical delivery vans have some 125-300 cubic feet of cargo volume, we would 


have expected to see about 60-150 delivery vans per day.  You can play around with the assumptions, 


but we think it would be very difficult to reconcile stated capacity with one van sitting idle for two days 


at each site.   





Construction at Anhui has clearly yet to commence.  The land is vacant, not even completely fenced 


off, and livestock was grazing within the targeted land.  According to local sources, the land needs to 


be leveled before construction can even begin.  Local sources assumed that construction has been 


delayed due to financial problems on the part of Sino Grandness.  





Loquats have a short shelf life and the fruit is fragile, which means fresh loquats need to be processed 


into concentrate within 1 or 2 days after being harvested.  As such, it is important for a loquat 


concentrate producer to be in close proximity to fresh loquat supply.  At Sichuan, our researchers only 


saw a few loquat plants growing in the farmland nearby.  Local farmers indicated the quality of the 


loquat is not as good as found elsewhere and given loquat prices farmers prefer to grow other fruits and 


vegetables.  There were only 200-300 loquat trees in the farmland opposite the Hubei factory, and 


local farmers indicated the fruits from these trees are too sour for consumption.

 While there is some conflicting information on capacity at Sichuan, we will refer to the 70,000 tonne number going forward.

…and we believe the Company overstated its external capacity…   





The company has indicated that its total capacity is 280,000 tonnes per annum, which is comprised of 


70,000 tonnes of internal capacity at Sichuan and 210,000 tonnes of external capacity (based on 


Company reports, presumably 70,000 tonnes at each of three contract manufacturers).  Our research 


suggests the three contract manufacturers are Beijing QSL Beverages, Fujian Tianhai, and Zhongshan 


Tianchen.  Based on records found online for these three contract manufacturers, and corroborated 


through conversations with sources at the manufacturers, we believe the company has significantly 


overstated external production capacity.
11








Exhibit 8: Beverage Contract Manufacturer Capacity 


 
Source: Company websites, newman9 analysis 





Keep in mind the 130,000 tonnes represents the total production capacity of the contract 


manufacturers.  Based on sources at the manufacturers, these companies produce non-juice drink 


products, utilize some of the capacity for their own brands, and perform contract manufacturing for a 


number of other companies.  As such, Garden Fresh can only be a subset of this 130,000 tonnes of 


capacity.  In fact, look back at the commentary we received from contract manufacturers during our 


channel checks – we believe Garden Fresh is likely a rather small subset of this capacity.   








…which can only mean reported sales are overstated 





Reported sales of RMB 1.382 billion would translate to 200,000-276,000 tonnes at an ASP of RMB 5,000-


7,000 per tonne.
12


  For simplicity we will call it 250,000 tonnes.  The Company only has one production 


site up and running, with reported capacity of 70,000 tonnes.  When our investigators visited that site, it 


was essentially idle, and our researchers were told it is operating at less than 10,000 tonnes.  That leaves 


240,000 tonnes which must come from contract manufacturing.  Garden Fresh has claimed to have 


210,000 tonnes of contract manufacturing capacity, but we believe the contract manufacturers likely 


have closer to 130,000 tonnes of total capacity, only part of which is used for juice beverages and third 


party brands.  Furthermore, sources at contract manufacturers indicate that Garden Fresh volumes are 


small.  If the Company’s factories are idle, the Company has overstated contract manufacturing 


                                                           
11


 In this chart, Zhongshan Tianchen stated capacity of 20,000 bottles per hour is converted to 60,000 tonnes per annum based on an assumed 
production schedule of 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.  We have also assumed that these are 500mL bottles (16.9 fl. oz.) and have made the 
simplifying assumption that 1 fl. oz. = 1 oz.  
12


 Our channel checks suggested the wholesale ASP for a 450mL bottle of mixed loquat juice is about RMB 2.20 and the ASP for a 500mL bottle 
of 50% loquat juice is about 3.50.  Assuming 1 fl. oz. = 1 oz., we get an ASP of about RMB 5,100-7,300 before factoring in discounts and 
promotions.  As a check, OSK had assumed an ASP of RMB 4,600 per tonne in early 2013.

capacity, and Garden Fresh is a small portion of the contract manufacturers’ business, then the 


Company must have overstated reported sales.   








Garden Fresh reported sales do not make sense when benchmarking key metrics to industry peers 





Based on our field work, we believe the industry does average sales per salesperson of RMB 1-1.5 


million, which is also consistent with benchmarking to some key peers.
13


  However, Garden Fresh 


purportedly does sales per salesperson of RMB 4.6 million.  Furthermore, despite exhibiting 3x the 


productivity of peers, Garden Fresh sales people appear to get paid about half.  The net effect is that the 


Garden Fresh “sales return on sales labor” is 6x that reported by industry peers.  (This can be 


alternately stated as industry peers report sales personnel expense as almost 6% of revenue compared 


to Garden Fresh at less than 1% of revenue.)   





Exhibit 9: China Beverage Peers Salesforce Metrics 


 
Source: Company filings, UBS reports, newman9 analysis 





Measured as a percentage of sales, industry peers spend 4x as much as Garden Fresh on advertising & 


promotion.  This is completely counterintuitive.  Large companies have established brands and A&P 


scale, and thus should have lower A&P as a percentage of sales compared to Garden Fresh.

Margins are unbelievably high relative to peers 





Garden Fresh reported EBIT margins of 25-30% are nearly on the levels of competitors’ Gross Margins of 


30-35%.  Garden Fresh’s 2013 reported EBIT margin of 27.8% was 7.9x the median EBIT margin of 


peers.  Miraculously, these margins have been achieved while relying on contract manufacturers for 


80% of volume and lacking internal puree capabilities.  Moreover, these margins have been achieved by 


a new entrant in a competitive market where some peers have even seen EBIT margin pressure for 


several years.

VEGETABLE CANNING BUSINESS 
 


Now that we have taken an in-depth look at the beverages business, we can quickly touch on the 


canned vegetable business.   








Sino Grandness appears to have overstated its market for asparagus… 





Asparagus is the largest non-beverage product, having represented about 45% of non-beverage sales 


from FY2006-FY2013.
14


  In its IPO prospectus, Sino Grandness suggests in 2008 “exports of canned 


asparagus by China amounted to approximately 305,000 tonnes, with a value of approximately 


US$279.2 million.”
15


  We were unable to obtain a copy of the research report the Company cited for this 


statistic.
16


  However, we were able to find other and arguably more reputable research and data.  


According to UN Comtrade data, China exports of prepared or preserved asparagus (commodity code 


200560) were 76,237 tonnes in 2008, suggesting Sino Grandness overstated Chinese exports of canned 


asparagus by 4x.   





Exhibit 12: Overstatement of China Vegetable Exports 


 
Source: UN Comtrade Database, Company filings, newman9 analysis 








…and Sino Grandness reported asparagus sales have completely bucked market trends  





According to UN Comtrade data, Chinese canned asparagus export volumes have been in steady decline 


since 2005 until the recent uptick in 2013.  From 2005-2013, China canned asparagus exports tonnes 


have fallen nearly 50%.  Increasing asparagus prices led to export value growth from ’05-‘07, but value 


subsequently declined over 40% from 2007 to 2013.  Despite market value declines of 40% from 2007 


to 2013, Sino Grandness reported a 127% increase in asparagus sales.  We estimate that Sino 


Grandness must have had 33-40% value share of Chinese exports in the last two years.
17


  This is

 The research report is “Industry Report on Canned Fruits and Vegetables in the PRC” by Beijing Hua Jing Zong Heng Information Centre, 


referenced on page 96 of the Sino Grandness IPO Prospectus.   
17


 Sources: UN Comtrade, Company filings, newman9 analysis.  Note that in this analysis, we have assumed all Sino Grandness asparagus sales 
were export sales.  We believe this is a reasonable assumption given there is little domestic consumption of canned asparagus as Chinese 
consumers consider it unhealthy and the Sino Grandness CEO has indicated there isn’t much of a domestic market for the types of vegetables 
they export.   Furthermore, the company’s increase in “Canned Products – Domestic” from 2011-2013 of RMB 162.6 million closely mirrors the 
increase in “Canned Fruits” sales of RMB 180.7 million.  This is also corroborated by the company’s statement in 2011 that it “intends to 
leverage on its growing distributor and retail base in China to roll out more own-branded canned products, especially canned fruits under its 


own-branded ‘Grandness’ (‘振鹏达’) label.”

inconsistent with the feedback of a former employee who indicated Sino Grandness relinquished its #1 


spot over that timeframe (and in fact became the #3 company in the space).    





Exhibit 13: China Canned Asparagus Exports 


 
Source: UN Comtrade Database, Company filings, newman9 analysis 








In 2008, reported sales volumes are inconsistent with market trends, production volumes, employee 


headcount, and a former employee’s recollection of events  





In 2008, Sino Grandness production volumes decreased by 35% year-over-year from 17,557 tonnes to 


11,364 tonnes.  However, sales volumes increased 31% year-over-year from 16,844 tonnes to 22,026 


tonnes.  As discussed in the MD&A section of the IPO prospectus, Sino Grandness was purportedly able 


to acquire a bunch of finished goods from third party suppliers for resale in the international market.  


Revenue from sales of canned products purchased from third party suppliers increased from 10.5% of 


sales in FY2007 to 68.1% in FY2008 and 79.0% in 1Q2009.  We find it odd that a) these internal 


production cuts came at the same time IPO due diligence would have been carried out and b) that the 


third party sourcing had very little impact on mix adjusted Gross Profit / Tonne.  





We also find it odd that China canned asparagus exports were down 22% year-over-year, internal 


production volumes decreased 35% year-over-year, and full-time employees decreased 40% year-


over-year.  And yet, reported sales volumes increased 31% year-over-year.  When we spoke to a 


former employee responsible for all canned vegetable exports, he recounted that Sino Grandness 


experienced large sales declines in 2008 as a result of the market environment which led to idle 


capacity and layoffs, and that third party purchases were cut to virtually zero.

Sino Grandness Canned Vegetable & Fruits margins seem too good to be true 





The operating margins reported by the Canned Vegetable & Fruits segment are unbelievable.  Owning a 


cement box and hiring a bunch of temporary workers to put asparagus into jars for the private label 


needs of a concentrated group of Western world discounters wouldn’t seem like it should earn high 


margins.   





But Sino Grandness is purportedly able to make quite enviable margins in this business.  According to 


data from Bloomberg, Sino Grandness operating margins are decidedly the highest of the 35 publicly 


traded companies deriving at least 40% of revenues from canned food manufacturing and with a market 


capitalization of over $50 million.  Sino Grandess group operating margins were 26.2% last year which 


are nearly 5x the peer median of 5.6%.  Sino Grandness margins are 900-1,200bp higher than the next 


four companies, which have large branded or specialty products businesses. 





A closer look at the Canned Vegetable & Fruits segment in particular shows that not only does Sino 


Grandness achieve segment margins 4x higher than the median of other public fruit & vegetable 


canning companies, its margins are even higher than global branded packaged food manufacturers.

WHERE IS THE CASH?  
 


In its IPO prospectus, Sino Grandness indicated it was going to pay out 20% of net profits in the form of 


dividends.  However, the reality is that the company has paid only two small dividends, one in FY2010 


(11% of net profit) and one in FY2011 (8% of net profit).  Sino Grandness has never generated free cash 


flow.  Since 2006, the company has generated cumulative reported net profits of RMB 1.1 billion.  


Meanwhile, cumulative free cash flow has been negative RMB 463 million, leading to share or 


convertible bond issuances every year since going public in 2009.  





Exhibit 16: Sino Grandness Summary Financials 


 
Source: Company filings, newman9 analysis 





Where have all the reported net profits gone?  Accounts receivable and capital expenditures.  








Accounts Receivable keep growing and are largely past due 





Since FY2006, total accounts receivable have grown by RMB 876 million, from RMB 45 million to RMB 


921 million.  Days sales outstanding has increased from 27 days in FY2006 to 86 days in FY2013.  China 


days sales outstanding was 101 days in FY2013.  This does not seem unreasonable given the Company 


says receivables are usually due in 60-90 days, but during our channel checks we have heard that 


many distributors are required to pay cash on delivery or even a couple weeks in advance which leads 


us to question the legitimacy of receivables.    





Unsurprisingly, trade receivables past due over one month and not impaired has risen from RMB 16 


million (28% of receivables) in 2008 to RMB 444 million (70% of trade receivables) in 2013.

  How 


many of these receivables will never be collected?

 IPO prospectus pg. A-42 and FY13 annual report pg. 78.  In the 2009, 2010, and 2011 annual reports, all trade receivables appear as “past due

receivables past due and not impaired,” with the latter referring only to trade receivables past due over 1 month or more.  Due to an erroneous 
footnote in the 2013 annual report, for 2013 we have estimated past due receivables as total trade receivables (RMB 633.4 million) less “trade

These numbers are at least according to what the company originally reported.  The accounts receivable 


discussion brings us to some questions regarding internal controls that we will come back to shortly.   








Capital Expenditures are questionable   





We believe that reported capital expenditures are questionable and we have a couple observations 


regarding capex.  





Capital expenditures keep inflating without the Company providing updates on capex plans.  This makes 


capex analysis difficult and provides a great opportunity to create a capex “hole.”  The Sichuan 


beverages production facility was originally supposed to cost RMB 25-30m and Hubei was supposed to 


cost RMB 150m for a total of RMB 175-180 million.  Through 2013, reported beverage segment capex 


has been RMB 541 million, which is 3x what the company originally told investors.   





Granted reported capacity has increased from what was originally announced.  However, we do not put 


much weight in increased capex from purportedly increased capacity.  As previously discussed, our site 


visits found the Sichuan facility essentially idle.  Hubei was supposed to be operational by the end of 


2013.  As of August 2014, we have been unable to find any indication that the facility is up and running 


and the Company is now talking about needing to “reapply certain certifications” before production can 


commence.  After RMB 541 million of beverages capex, the Company still reportedly admits to being 


reliant on contract manufacturers for most of its volume.    





It’s not clear the company has even purchased what it has said.  Investor relations representative Parry 


Ng published a video to showcase Sino Grandness’ plant in Sichuan.  We find it odd that the video starts 


with filled bottles coming out of a wall.  If you look around on Youtube, you’ll find a plethora of these 


videos showcasing juice filling lines and they almost all start at the beginning of the line as one might 


expect.  So instead of showcasing a juice production and bottling operation, Sino Grandness has 


simply shown us a labeling and boxing operation.  Where is the raw material processing equipment?  


Where is the filling equipment?  We find it odd that in 2014 analysts are still coming back from site visits 


without pictures of raw materials processing or filling equipment.  





We’d also point out that to us this looks like low throughput cheap Chinese equipment which would not 


cost anywhere near the RMB 100 million per line the company has indicated to analysts.
19


  This line 


appears to be operating at a rate of approximately 16,000 BPH as measured by the rate bottles are 


                                                                                                                                                                                           
receivables neither past due nor impaired” (RMB 189.4 million).  Performing this same calculation for 2012 results in a “trade receivables past 
due and not impaired” estimate of RMB 279.6 million which is consistent with the amount disclosed on pg. 70 of the FY12 annual report.  See 
Appendix I for additional detail.  
19


 This can also be triangulated by the following: RMB 540.6 million in total Beverage segment capex less RMB 46.2 million for Hubei land rights, 


RMB 189.9 million for Hubei factory & warehouse premises, and RMB 38.9 million for Sichuan factory & warehouse premises leaves  RMB 265.6 
million for other items which would mainly be plant and machinery.  This is supposed to be for capacity of 270,000 tonnes which equates to 
roughly RMB 100 million per 100,000 tonne line.

being moved into the boxes.  We received quotes from Chinese suppliers and believe we could build a 


16,000-20,000 BPH line, including fresh fruit processing, water treatment, bottle blowing, juice mixing, 


filling, and packing, for less than RMB 10 million.   








Upstream integration – the next capex black hole?  





It looks like Sino Grandness has found another great way to ensure it never generates cash flow – 


moving upstream into the farming business.  This is a highly capital intensive and low transparency 


industry which has been a contentious area to say the least (see Chaoda Modern, China Minzhong, Asian 


Citrus, and others).  At the 2013 EGM, the company reportedly said it would explore owning loquat 


plantations.  While the company announced a planned RMB 600 million investment to build a plant in 


Anhui, other accounts have suggested it will actually be a RMB 900 million investment and include a 


5,000-acre raw material production base.   








Concerns over internal controls 





As previously mentioned, examining the Company’s audited financial documents has led us to questions 


regarding internal controls and audit procedures.  Through the years, there are multiple instances of 


obvious errors published in these documents.  We find it alarming that some of these errors occurred in 


2013 under the new (and first) CFO and relate to areas of particular interest to potential Garden Fresh 


IPO investors, such as accounts receivable or convertible bonds.   





Some of the more salient errors that we have found in financial documents include:  


 In the 2013 annual report, footnote 12 suggests there are RMB 189.4 million “trade receivables 


neither past due nor impaired” and another RMB 74.3 million “trade receivables past due and 


not impaired.” These do not come close to summing to RMB 633.4 million of total trade 


receivables.  


 The above resulted in the Company filing a corrigendum which suggests there are RMB 559.2 


million of “trade receivables neither past due nor impaired” and RMB 74.4 million of “trade 


receivables past due and not impaired” which approximately foots to the previously disclosed 


RMB 633.4 million.  However, the Company has erroneously included RMB 153,500 receivables 


“past due over 6 months” as not impaired.  These receivables were already impaired in 2011 


so could not reappear in the corrigendum without an income statement entry.  


 The age analysis disclosed in the corrigendum reclassifies 2012 receivables and is not 


consistent with previous receivables disclosure.  Either the Company has had erroneous 


footnotes to the audited financial statements for the last five years, or there is another error 


in the corrigendum.  


 In the 2013 annual report, the Company has a newly disclosed “maximum redemption amount 


payable” for each of the revised redemption amount scenarios.  The Company has only factored

in one year of compounding which is highly misleading as it dramatically understates the 


actual maximum redemption amount in each scenario.  The Company discloses a maximum 


redemption liability of RMB 449 million (RMB 125 million and RMB 324 million) compared to the 


actual maximum redemption amount of RMB 723 million (RMB 195 million and RMB 527 


million).  The math has been clear to analysts for years.

CONVERTIBLE BONDS, LISTING, AND VALUATION 
 


In early 2011, Sino Grandness announced that it wanted to list Taiwan Depository Receipts on the TSE 


“to have ready access to the different equity markets in the Asia Pacific region.”  This plan was later 


abandoned, and the Garden Fresh subsidiary instead issued convertible bonds with onerous terms.  The 


first tranche was issued to Sun Hung Kai in 2011 and the second tranche to Goldman Sachs in 2012.    





Sino Grandness has positioned Goldman’s convertible bond investment as a “an endorsement of the 


management…[and] growth prospects” of Garden Fresh.  We believe that abandoning plans to list in 


Taiwan and instead issuing incredibly onerous convertible bonds is in fact indicative of a lack of faith in 


management and the growth prospects.   





Put it this way.  Even if this is a fraud, convertible bondholders are probably going to make decent 


money.  They have a true “heads I win, tails you lose” situation.  If Garden Fresh were to list at the 


valuation assumed by management, convertible bondholders will roughly triple their money.  If Garden 


Fresh doesn’t list, convertible bondholders will make a 20-25% IRR as long as there are enough assets to 


cover their RMB 723 million.   





It’s likely that there are some real assets here.  If we mark the cash, inventories, receivables, and PP&E 


down by 50%, convertible bond holders will be covered for their RMB 723 million and earn a quite 


respectable 20-25% IRR on their original investment of RMB 330 million.  Equity holders on the other 


hand will be left with virtually nothing.   








Cracks are already emerging 





We believe there are signs of stress with the Company’s listing and financial situation.  As previously 


stated, the Company has not yet filed a Form A1 which needed to happen by now in order to IPO by 


October.  Sell-side accounts have suggested management is “non-committal” on the dates of application 


and listing.  While the Company has purportedly retained a top-tier investment bank and Big 4 auditor, 


management has declined to reveal its sponsors due to a “non-disclosure agreement.”  The Company 


failed to provide any useful update on the IPO process along with the recent results.  Instead, the 


Company put out a press release disclosing discussions with an unidentified “potential” strategic 


investor about “possible” investment that may or may not materialize which we thought reeked of 


desperation.    





Meanwhile, in a bit of ironic déjà vu, it looks like Garden Fresh is trying to get through the IPO due 


diligence process with most of its production capacity idle (as was the case in the 2009 Sino Grandness 


IPO) as it apparently needs to “reapply certain certifications” under Garden Fresh rather than Sino 


Grandness.  The work at the Anhui hasn’t even begun to begin, which locals presume is due to financial 


stress.

Valuation  





Analyst price targets range from S$0.76 to S$1.25.  CEO Huang Yupeng has talked about a S$750 million 


value for Garden Fresh based on a 15x price-earnings ratio.  Analysts don’t seem to have gone that far, 


as illustrated by OSK using 12x to value Garden Fresh, which they view as conservative relative to HK 


peers at >20x.  Even ignoring the fact that we believe actual sales are significantly lower than reported 


sales, earnings multiple comparisons to HK peers aren’t fair since margins are abnormally high here.   





Valuing Sino Grandness is tricky since we don’t believe the audited financial statements.  We think that 


the shares are worthless.  We think that Garden Fresh reported sales are at least 5x overstated and 


more likely overstated by 15-25x or more.  What follows is our attempt to conservatively value the 


Company, illustrating that the equity is most likely worthless.   





If we assume reported Garden Fresh sales of RMB 1.382 billion are 5x overstated, that gives us adjusted 


sales of RMB 275 million.  According to data compiled from Bloomberg, global non-alcoholic beverages 


companies trade at a median EV/Sales of 1.35x.  If we apply an EV / Sales multiple of 1.5x to our (best 


case) estimate for adjusted sales, we get a value of RMB 415 million for Garden Fresh.   





We also believe the earnings of the canned vegetable business are overstated.  If we make no 


adjustments and apply a “suspected fraud” 3x price-earnings multiple to reported NOPAT (reported EBIT 


assuming 27.9% tax rate), that gives us a value of RMB 411 million for the canned vegetable segment  


bringing total enterprise value to RMB 826 million.  (For reference, Sino Grandness EV was about RMB 


460 million in 3Q10).  We get a similar RMB 903 million enterprise value if we value the cash and land 


use rights at book and then mark down inventories, receivables, and PP&E by 50%.  Adjusting the 


convertible bonds to reflect the full liability gives us an equity value of RMB 95-180 million which 


translates to an equity value per share of S$0.03 to S$0.06 before factoring in any capital raise.  





The problem is the company will need to pay RMB 723 million to convertible bondholders.  Additionally, 


the company has a RMB 600 million capex project at Anhui, but only has RMB 60 million in cash, 


bringing total capital requirements to RMB 1.26 billion.  This capital requirement is 7-13x our generous 


estimate of the pre-capital raise equity value of RMB 95-180 million.  We therefore believe such a large 


share issuance is required that the stock is virtually worthless.
