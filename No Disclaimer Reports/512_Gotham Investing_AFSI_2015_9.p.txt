Introduction


In August of last year, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation wrote an article,
"The Mitzvah Factory," about the private foundations controlled by AmTrust Financial
Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) co-founders Michael and George Karfunkel -- the Hod
Foundation and the Chesed Foundation of America, respectively.


In the article, SIRF detailed how Hod and Chesed appear to have committed numerous
violations of the tax code set out for private foundations (Chapter 42, Subchapter A),
including:


1. Making "jeopardizing investments" (ie: selling puts on AIG and Lehman on September
12, 2008),


2. Self-dealing (ie: loans to Karfunkel-controlled trusts), and
3. Having "excess business holdings" (in short, over 20% ownership of a company by a


foundation and it's "disqualified persons"), among others.


As interesting as Hod's voluminous option trading is, the most relevant part of the SIRF
article for investors in AFSI was the section about excess business holdings.


I. Excess Business Holdings of Hod & Chesed (August 2014)

SIRF's analysis of the size and duration Hod and Chesed's holdings of AFSI which
indicated that both foundations had excess business holdings for which the 5-year grace
period to dispose of gifted shares had expired.


As a result, SIRF concluded that the foundations would have to sell approximately 12.1
million shares to get the holdings of each foundation below the 2% de minimus rule (other
paths to compliance would require selling more shares). At the time, that represented
approximately 16% of shares outstanding and roughly 40% of the float.


Note: I actually think they would have been required to sell even more shares in light of
IRC 4946(a)(1)(NYSE:H)(ii), but 12.1 million shares will do enough damage to the stock
that I won't argue the point.


However, SIRF's article left unaddressed WHEN those shares would have to be sold.


II. AFSI CFO Comments Implicitly Confirm Excess Business Holdings (September
2014)


When AFSI's CFO, Ron Pipoly, was asked about Karfunkel foundations' need to sell
shares at the JMP Conference on September 30, 2014, he made this comment as part of
his response to the initial question:


"...So at the end of the day, I am sure that this will be worked through. And again, I
don't think there has been any concession that there are excessive holdings.
And hypothetically, if there are excessive holdings, there's alternative to those
other than selling shares. You can distribute shares out to other foundations;
you can apply for a grace period that are extensions...


There are several problems with this response. First, excess business holdings are not
something one can concede -- one either has excess business holdings or one does not.


Second, as discussed in more detail below, one cannot simply distribute shares to other
private foundations to resolve the problem. Otherwise, the purpose of the rule would be
defeated.


Finally, extensions to the 5-year grace period requires the foundation to establish that
"diligent efforts to dispose of such holdings have been made within the initial 5-year
period...".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2812975-forced-selling-of-amtrust-likely 3/16


In light of the fact that Hod did not sell a single share from the time it started holding AFSI
through the date of these comments, it is nearly certain that any request from Hod for an
extension of the grace period would be denied.


III. Hod-Teferes Transfer Provides Further Confirmation (November 2014)


On November 21, 2014, the Karfunkels filed a Schedule 13D/A for AFSI that included the
following disclosure:


On November 12, 2014, the Hod Foundation, a charitable foundation controlled by
Michael Karfunkel, donated all of its 7,216,773 shares to the Teferes Foundation.


Incredibly, after 7+ years of holding shares of ASFI in Hod without selling a single
share, Hod decided to get rid of its shares in one fell swoop!


What changed to prompt such a dramatic move? It doesn't appear to be a desire to give
the money away -- after all, he ensured the shares wouldn't get sold by transferring them
to Zyskind...


IV. SIRF: Hod's Problem is now Teferes'...and Does NOT Reset 5-year holding period


SIRF wasted no time (and minced no words) with their follow-up story, "Update: Michael
Karfunkel's Bridge to Nowhere":


With that in mind, SIRF took a hard look at the deal and it appears that charity is the
last reason this was done. Moreover, a close reading of the rules governing inter-
private foundation transfers suggests Michael Karfunkel hasn't done his son-in-law
any favors.


SIRF went on to explain that the Hod-to-Teferes transfer did not accomplish much in the
way of solving the Karfunkel/Zyskind foundations' excess business holdings problems:


As before, there is a long-standing rule in place that somehow Michael Karfunkel or
the people advising him missed. It's called Internal Revenue Code Section 507(b)(2)
and it deals with asset transfers between private foundations. The upshot of the rule
is that when 25 percent or more of the fair market value of a foundations net assets
are transferred, the recipient assumes the grantor's tax liabilities (as well as the
obligation to dispose of the excess business holdings.)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2812975-forced-selling-of-amtrust-likely 4/16


Of course, this makes sense because one shouldn't be able to transfer vast amounts of
money from patriarch to son-in-law and magically avoid taxes. If that were the case, the
initial rule would have no effect.


SIRF also explained that Hod had already missed its five year grace period by over a
year!


In the case of Hod Foundation, this liability is potentially mounting into the tens of
millions of dollars. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate
that the Hod Foundation received a block of shares on August 1, 2008 that pushed
its ownership to just below 10 percent of the shares outstanding. Under IRS rule
4943, a private foundation has five years to liquidate the excess business holding;
by August 2013, according to the timetable its own SEC filings document, Hod was
in violation of the IRS rules.


In addition, SIRF highlighted how bizarre this ineffectual transaction ultimately was, how
the Karunkels did NOT manage to "reset the clock" on the holding period allowed for
excess business holdings, and how the foundations still need to sell over 12 million
shares.


Ultimately the Hod-to-Teferes transaction is astoundingly strange: it solves no
problems and only serves to highlight the very issue it was supposed to address,
and raises additional ones, like charitable intent. The Karfunkel/Zyskind private
foundations remain every bit in violation of the excess business holdings rule
as they were before the move and Zyskind's Teferes Foundation has been
afoul of the rules from the minute the deal closed; no holding period "clock" is
reset.


Getting right with the IRS will mean that some painful arithmetic is in store for the
Karfunkel family.


Using the figure of 74,886,335 shares outstanding as disclosed in last week's 13-D
filing, the 2% exemption means that Barry Zyskind's Teferes Foundation and George
Karfunkel's Chesed Foundation for America would have to dispose of over 12 million
AmTrust shares combined, either through direct sales or grants to public charities.
Breaking it down further, the maximum permissible holding for each foundation is
1,497,726 shares, implying that Teferes (which currently holds 7,347,555 shares)
would have to sell 5,849,828 shares and Chesed (which currently holds 7,707,918
shares) would have to sell 6,210,192 shares.

V. Potential Explanation for the Strange Hod-to-Teferess Transfer


I suspect there were three reasons for the bizarre transfer of $373 million worth of AFSI
shares in mid-November.


1. Attempt to confuse the IRS with regard to the duration of the Karfunkel/Zyskind
foundations' holdings of AFSI,


2. Hope to avoid paying the "initial" taxes on such substantial excess business holdings,
and


3. Avoid hurting AFSI's stock price, especially because of AFSI's need to raise capital.


While the Karfunkels are unlikely to tell me why they did the transfer, they might have
hoped that the IRS would not look into the Hod-Teferes transfer, allowing Teferes to hold
shares for another five years. After all, the Karfunkel foundations have managed to avoid
scrutiny thus far despite the egregious acts described in SIRF's first article.


Second, I suspect the timing of the transfer was not a coincidence. SIRF's article was
published on August 17, 2014 -- 87 days before the transfer of shares.


That's rather interesting in light of Treas. Reg. 53.4943-2(a)(1)(ii), which allows a private
foundation to avoid incurring a tax for excess business holdings if it disposes of them
within 90 days of knowing about them:


(ii) Disposition of certain excess business holdings within ninety days. In any case in
which a private foundation acquires excess business holdings, other than as a result
of a purchase by the foundation, the foundation shall not be subject to the taxes
imposed by section 4943, but only if it disposes of an amount of its holdings so that it
no longer has such excess business holdings within 90 days from the date on which
it knows, or has reason to know, of the event which caused it to have such excess
business holdings.


As noted in the SIRF article above, this transfer did not address the excess business
holdings problem -- it merely transferred the need to sell AFSI shares from Hod to Teferes.


Further evidence that this might have been the Karfunkels game plan can be seen in the
1999-2001 transfers from the Karfunkel Family Foundation to Hod and Chesed. Much like
the Hod-Teferes transfer in November 2014, the Karfunkel-Hod and Karfunkel-Chesed
transfers in 1999 and 2000 were merely left pocket-right pocket transactions that appear
to have been intended to "kick up dust" instead of actually having to part with the money in
the foundations:

The third motive that may have contributed to the Hod-Teferes transfer was the dire need
for AFSI to raise capital. Sure enough, AFSI issued 3 million shares in a secondary
offering last week, validating my and others' criticisms of AFSI's capital position.


For the record, I don't think 3 million shares was anywhere close to enough. Perhaps
that's all the shares the underwriter though they would be able to place...


VI. Teferes Likely to Sell 5.7 million shares by April 15, 2015

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2812975-forced-selling-of-amtrust-likely 7/16


If my theory that the Hod-Teferes transfer was prompted by a desire to avoid the initial tax,
as discussed above, then the same logic would apply to Teferes' holdings as soon as the
second article was published.


That would put Teferes' required disposal date at March 1st, but the IRS allows extensions
for the amount of time that a foundation is/was restricted from selling shares for regulatory
or similar purposes.


As such, I assume that Teferes will incorporate the 45 day lock-up (page S-20) from the
recent secondary when calculating its correction period, which will leave just 42 days (31
trading days) for Teferes to sell 5.7 million shares -- just two months after the company
issued 3 million shares (and still needs more).


VII. Chesed: Rolling the Dice


Whereas Michael Karfunkel's Hod appears to be attempting to cover its excess business
holdings tracks, his brother George's foundation, Chesed, seems to either be defiantly
ignoring the IRS rules and regulations, even after having been called out by SIRF.


VIII. "Initial Tax" Applied to Each Year -- Further Transfers Off the Table


Since the 90 day correction period discussed above has expired without Chesed or Hod
(now Teferes' obligation), both Chesed and Teferes will owe 10% (before penalties and
interest) for each tax year in which they had excess business holdings.


Furthermore, each year's tax liability will be measured based on the day that the value of
the foundation's holdings were the greatest.


For Chesed and Teferes, this means that the tax years ending June 30, 2013, 2014, and
2015 will all be subject to a 10% tax. This is based on ownership reported in AFSI proxies,
adjusted for a five year grace period, and only includes the holdings for which the grace
period has ended.


If somehow Chesed escapes detection until July 2015 (Teferes / January 2016 -- different
tax year-end), that will simply add another 10% tax, further ensuring the ultimate outcome.


IX. 200% "Additional Tax" When the IRS Realizes the Problem


Moreover, should the IRS realize the massive problem at Chesed and Teferes, they will
likely issue a "notice of deficiency" to each of them -- at which point Chesed and Teferes
will have 90 days to comply or be subject to a 200% tax.

Since Chesed and Teferes both have over 80% of their assets in AFSI, a 200% tax would
effectively cause them to forfeit all of their shares to the government, unless they sold
shares in AFSI within the correction period.


Do you want to run the risk that Chesed or Teferes receive a notice of deficiency
tomorrow (or already have received one)?


The day either entity begins selling, who will step in for the ~5m+ shares they need
to sell to pay the "initial tax" obligations?


In light of how poorly a 3m share offering (trading below deal price) has traded, I suspect a
larger offering or aggressive open market selling program will be challenging.


Last, even shares that are distributed to public charities (ie: not private foundations, as
discussed above) must not have any restrictions on what the recipient organization can do
with them.


Conclusion


The Karfunkels have simply waited too long to address their excess business holdings in
AFSI.


Even after a journalist exposed the problem, Chesed and Hod/Teferes remain in violation
of the excess business holdings rule and the consequences of waiting only make the
problem more acute.


Finally, if Hod's actions are a guide, Teferes is likely to dispose of 5.7 million shares of
AFSI by April 15, 2015.


Between the risk posed by its accounting, its capital deficiency, and its founders'
private foundations being forced to sell significant amounts of stock, the risk to the
downside is substantial at AFSI.
