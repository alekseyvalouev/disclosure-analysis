CITRON UPDATES LIFE
PARTNERS, INC.
(NASDAQ:LPHI)


The SEC Has Spoken — It’s Time for
Investors to Listen


The stock of Life Partners has been under pressure
lately- and for good reason.


Over the years, Citron Research has presented
several stories alerting readers to anticipated
government regulation or intervention into a “too
good to be true” business model. Last year, we
accurately warned of a government crackdown on
the exaggerated marketing abuses of for-pro�t
education at Apollo Group and Medicare
reimbursement abuse at Amedisys. Both stocks are
down close to 50% since our initial reports.


Yet, in Citron Research’s 9 years of publishing, we
have never seen a company so clearly pinned in the
crosshairs of a government launched laser-guided
smart bomb – at both state and federal levels.


For those of you who missed the �rst couple
episodes here is a brief bullet point refresher:


The brokered spreads between prices
paid and received for their life
settlement policies is enormous, far
beyond industry norms.
Disclosure is inadequate and
transparency is poor to both parties
in its brokered transactions.

It has for years operated under a
Federal safe-harbor legal ruling that
Life Settlements transactions are NOT
securities sales.
It is restricted from operating in
states that hold Life Settlements
legally to be securities, and facing
increasing scrutiny in others.
To settle a fraud suit brought by the
State of Colorado, Life Partners
bought back all the life settlements it
sold in that state.
The company lost a legal challenge in
Florida to its claim that Life
Settlements are not securities.
Management has a tainted past: at
the CEO’s last company he was cited
by the SEC for overstating revenues
and pro�ts.
Currently the CEO maintains his stock
in a trust domiciled in the secretive
tax haven nation of Gibraltar.


At that time, our opinion was that regulation of the
life settlements industry would destroy the
business of Life Partners. In the opinion of Citron,
that day has come.


In the SEC’s own words:


Last week the SEC released a 90-page report
explicating the securitization of the Life Settlement
markets, and headlining its strong recommendation
that Congress bring Life Settlements under the
umbrella of securities regulation. This report has
many references to Life Partners and appears to be
a direct assault on their operations.

report.pdf
[https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/lifesettlements-
report.pdf]


The report starts by stating how Life Partners has
attempted to skirt regulation, quoting from their
10-K:

“Some states and the Securities and
Exchange Commission have attempted to
treat life settlements as securities under
federal or state securities laws. We have
structured our settlement transactions to
reduce the risk that they would be treated as
securities under state or Federal securities
law, and the Federal Circuit Court for the
District of Columbia has ruled that our
settlement transactions are not securities
under the Federal securities laws.”


An Outsourced, Unregistered Investment Sales
Network that Recruits Unquali�ed Investors


The SEC goes on to state the importance of
protecting the investor and uses Life Partners as
their poster child. As it states in the report,


“Another large participant acts as a
purchasing agent of life insurance policies.
This participant’s customers are primarily
retail investors 37 who generally buy
fractional interests in one or more
policies.38“


The SEC points this out explicitly, in contrast to
much of LPHI’s o�cial rhetoric, which states
disingenuously that the company services
“institutional investors”.


LPHI’s �lings with the SEC indicated that their
business model was based upon sourcing capital
from both retail investors and institutional
investors. 2009’s 10-K indicated that approximately
10% of its business came from institutional
investors. This year’s 10-K, however, reveals that
the only institutional investor over the past 3
years has been a fund in which LPHI itself has
made a $6.5 million investment. Thus, the
company’s prior SEC �lings failed to identify the
con�ict of interest and disclosure de�ciency that
existed during �scal 2008 and 2009. Further, it
failed to disclose that the related fund paid LPHI
fees approximating 2.0% of face value, compared to
the 10.5% of face value it charged to its less
sophisticated retail investors… but that is merely a
sideshow of the larger issues.

The SEC’s report was recently covered by Business
Week, which reiterated the need to do away with
the informal sales networks that generate retail
investors for the Life Settlement business.

With a quick 10 minute Google search, Citron was
able to �nd no less than 5 Life Partners sales agents
who are all making fraudulent statements that
misrepresent the risks/returns of investment in
their life settlement policies. If we could do that in
10 minutes, how many will the SEC be able to
uncover with subpoena power?

The Disturbing Case of SEC vs Mutual Bene�ts


The most compelling part of the SEC report is on
page 30, wherein Life Partners is compared to
Mutual Bene�ts. Mutual Bene�ts was to date the
largest Life Settlement scam; 30,000 investors lost
$1 billion, before the SEC brought charges.

[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18698.pdf]


Note that Citron is not claiming that LPHI pulled
money out of escrow to pay for investor
withdrawals — the classic Ponzi Scheme  gambit.

Neverless, some of the comparisons are haunting.  
As stated in the SEC report:


“The SEC brought an emergency action
against Mutual Bene�ts, charging that it
promised investors �xed returns ranging
from 12% to 72%, while falsely representing
life expectancy �gures as having been
veri�ed by an independent physician. In
reality, more than 90% of Mutual Bene�ts’
policies had surpassed their life
expectancies. In order to deal with shortfall
resulting from these maturing policies,
Mutual Bene�ts e�ectuated a premium
payment scheme, similar to a traditional
Ponzi scheme, paying premium obligations of
speci�c investors with monies escrowed for
future obligations of other investors. The SEC
also charged that at least $26 million in funds
collected by Mutual Bene�ts was
misappropriated by company insiders and
their relatives.”


OK, lets break that paragraph down from the SEC
that refers to Mutual Bene�ts and lets see how it
describes Life Partners.


“charging that it promised investors �xed
returns ranging from 12% to 72%”


Life Partners licensees also make outrageous
claims. The Colorado lawsuit noted that LPHI’s
largely unregistered licensees (its representatives
that solicit funds from retail investors) promised,
via radio advertisements, “a 14 year average
annual return of more than 16% with low risk to
principal… while falsely representing life
expectancy �gures as having been veri�ed by an
independent physician.”


Just like Mutual Bene�ts, Life Partners also does not
use an independent party to prepare life
expectancies. The in-house LE is not common
practice in the industry and nowhere have we seen
this disclosed in any of LPHI marketing material.


“In reality, more than 90% of Mutual Bene�ts’
policies had surpassed their life
4/20/2018 Citron Updates Life Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPHI) – Citron Research

expectancies”


Statistics on LPHI’s policies indicate that 76% of
insureds are living longer than the company’s
recorded Life Expectancy.


“In order to deal with shortfall resulting from
these maturing policies, Mutual Bene�ts
e�ectuated a premium payment scheme …
paying premium obligations of speci�c
investors with monies escrowed for future
obligations of other investors”


According to the LPHI 10-K: “We make advances on
policy premiums to maintain certain policies.” They
have also gotten into the business of buying some
of the policies. Imagine if Countrywide had funded
defaulted mortgages out of pro�ts just to make its
disclosed default rates look healthier.


This chart shows that that LPHI has originated over
75% of all its life settlements in the past four years.
Most of the current premium advances appear to
be servicing policies that were sold to investors
prior to 1998.


The Story in the Numbers:


Last year Life Partners reached an agreement with
the State of Colorado to settle fraud charges. As
part of the settlement, they agreed to buy back all
of the policies written to Colorado investors. These
policies can now be analyzed for performance,
revealing a dirty little secret about Life Partners’
track record.

Conclusion


Life Partners’ business model only worked in an
unregulated world, where they could freely match
unsophisticated buyers with policy sellers
purposely left in the dark about price transparency.
This is precisely why markets are regulated –
e�cient markets need a level playing �eld and a fair
referee to prevent brokers from gouging the
transacting parties. Its main tools are to enforce
transparency of price discovery and competitive
fees.


Now, in the sunsetting phase of its business model,
as the number of unregulated transaction
candidates dries up, its �nancial statements reveal
that LPHI is being forced to close fewer
transactions, of larger face value, and carve out for
itself an ever larger share of the transaction fees.
These fees are now nearly equivalent to the value
paid to the seller of the policies – an absurdly high
value.


Meanwhile, it must “pay the piper” — out of current
pro�ts — for its mounting legacy of overly-
optimistic life expectancy estimates on its portfolio
holdings policies.


We credit Life Partners for being an early mover in
the Life Settlement business. For years they have
been able to take advantage of a non-regulated
market and set the rules for their own advantage.

However, that advantage, cashiered at the expense
of their customers, has not created a sustainable
business model or a fungible asset base in a
regulated market. Once regulation forces full
disclosure for investors, unsophisticated retail
investors are excluded and sellers get a fair market,
and margins will collapse as investment banking
�rms enter the market. Citron believes LPHI’s cash
�ow is doomed.


All good things must come to an end. It is now
apparent more than ever that the epitaph will be
written with SEC letterhead.
