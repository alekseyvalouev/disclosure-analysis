The Harbin Land Shuffle: A Classic Bait And Switch

As of September 21, 2011, the risk equation at Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) has
fundamentally changed due to the release of 2 new pieces of information which essentially
prove that HRBN has made material misrepresentations to the SEC, the NASDAQ
and to China Development Bank. The size and nature of these material
misrepresentations is now too big and too public to be ignored by the SEC, the NASDAQ
or China Development Bank. There now exists a very real basis for the NASDAQ to halt
/delist the stock and for CDB to walk away from the financing.


The irrefutable misrepresentations boil down to this:


· One of HRBN’s major customers doesn’t even know who HRBN is!


· The Bait and Switch (ala YUII): Creating a phony land acquisition and then
attempting to replace it with another transaction after having been exposed.


The first development was the surfacing of audio tapes on The Financial Investigator
which indicate that HRBN has completely fabricated its relationship with a reported major
customer, Jiangsu Liyang Automobile Seat Adjuster Factory. GeoInvesting is strongly of
the opinion that anyone who is following the HRBN transaction should absolutely make it a
point to listen to these tapes in their entirety. [here and here]. We have spoken several
times with the interviewer who made the tapes to confirm their authenticity.


The contents of the tapes can be summarized as follows:


- An US investor visited the facilities of Jiangsu Liyang in person and interviewed the head
of sales, and then subsequently followed up with a phone call with the general manager
(head of quality control)


- Both managers in 2 separate conversations independently confirmed that Jiangsu Liyang
has no relationship with Harbin Electric, and in fact doesn’t even know who Harbin
Electric is.


- More importantly, Jiangsu Liyang is effectively not even in the business of making
electric seat adjusters. The company makes MANUAL seat adjusters. As can be
heard clearly on the tapes, Jiangsu Liyang produced less than a total of $500,000 of

electric seat adjusters in the past 2 years. However, in HRBN’s 2010 10K (page 9) HRBN
disclosed that it sold over $40 million in motors to Jiangsu Liyang in the years ended 2008
and 2009.


- The interviewer asked if he could see any electric seat adjusters and was told that none
were available because they are only made by special order and only comprise 1-2% of
Jiangsu Liyang’s revenue.


- In each of the past 2 years Jiangsu Liyang can be heard to state that they sold only
about 1,000 motorized seat adjusters, and more importantly for the few motors that they
did purchase, they named their supplier as Shanghai Shenghuabo Motors, not Harbin
Electric.


For those who wish to independently confirm what Jiangsu Liyang produces, it is easy to
visit their website here. It can be clearly seen that Jiangsu Liyang includes pictures of all
of their products and that none of them are motorized or electric.


These facts are easily verifiable by the NASDAQ and in similar recent incidents with China
stocks the NASDAQ has acted relatively swiftly to halt the stock. It is also now easy for
China Development Bank to visit Jiangsu Liyang, or to even simply call them and ask what
they produce in terms of manual or electric car seat adjusters. Barring that, CDB can
simply visit the website of Jiangsu Liyang and easily see that the company does not even
produce motorized seat adjusters.


The second development was the September 21, 2011 after-market release of an 8K
by HRBN which effectively confirms our findings and those of AlfredLittle.com regarding a
reported land purchase by HRBN that never took place.


On September 6th, HRBN released a press release refuting a report by AlfredLittle.com
and us. HRBN stated:


Regarding the land purchase referenced in the report, the Company stands by the
statements as disclosed in its 10-Q dated August 9, 2011. Harbin Electric confirms
that the land purchase was done in full compliance with various relevant Chinese
government entities and notes this transaction structure is a common practice in
China.


Yet in the September 21st 8K, HRBN notes that the land purchase had already been
canceled as of August 24th. HRBN notes that now a new transaction has taken place for 2
separate parcels of land, yet both the total purchase price and deposit amounts required
