Athenex – Unpopular Operating Officer 
While his resume appears impressive ,  Athenex Chief Operating Officer  


Jeffrey Yordon has always been in the proximity of disaster , including 


two class action lawsuits.   


October 29, 2019 – As we move into the sixth installment of our coverage on Athenex, 


Viceroy reiterate our view that Oraxol is obsolete in the modern medicine, and that 


Athenex will be effectively bankrupt by mid-2020 with no profitable operations 


given management’s overenthusiastic spending habits. 


This report further exposes management’s ties to impropriety and provides a broader 


summary of Athenex’s management & director teams. 


▪ Yordon’s executive career started as President of LyphoMed, who’s CEO was 


sued by acquiring entity, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical. 


- Fujisawa claimed LyphoMed filed false information with the FDA in 


connection with thirty five ANDAs. Information was either misrepresented, 


destroyed or was not recorded where it concerned adverse test results. 


- LyphoMed’s CEO was none other than John Kapoor of Insys Therapeutics 


fame.  


▪ Yordon claims to have founded Gensia Pharmaceuticals, when the business was 


in fact acquired from Kedall Co. while Yordon was employed at Gensia’s topco. 


- Gensia’s share price collapsed upon flagship heart medication showing no statistical benefits. 


▪ While employed at American Pharmaceutical Partners, Yordon and other senior management were sued 


for making misleading statements about the prospects of an anti-cancer drug. 


▪ While director of Sagent, shareholders sued the company alleging that the board and its advisors failed to 


negotiate a fair deal for the company’s shareholders in a sale; agreeing to certain terms which only 


benefitted management. 


- Yordon was CEO at the time of the engagement of the company’s investment bankers and 


establishment of the board’s “strategic committee” to evaluate such decisions. 


We have already highlighted management’s involvement in Sino Forest, GCL Silicon/Poly, Suntech, Chelsea 


Therapeutics, the world’s largest illegal taxol smuggling operation, and now LyphoMed, Gensia and Sagent. It 


is mind blowing that Athenex would continue to associate with any one  of these farces, let alone a collection 


such as this. 


In light of all of the issues and questions Viceroy have highlighted, it is also alarming to shareholders that 


Athenex have not addressed a single point, opting instead to simply state we have published “inaccurate 


information”. 





Where are the inaccuracies, Athenex? 


Viceroy remain short Athenex.

1. Jeffrey Yordon 


Athenex’s COO Jeffrey Yordon has mastered the art of leaving his history behind him.  


While his resume appears impressive, it is clear upon further inspection that Yordon has always been in the 


proximity of disaster, including two class action lawsuits.  


 
Figure 1 Jeffrey Yordon Biography 


Yordon also has several inconsistencies in his resume over the years, declaring himself a “founding member” of 


a company not founded by him. 


LyphoMed 


Yordon was an original founding member of LyphoMed, a company later sued by acquiring entity Fujisawa 


Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.  


After acquisition in April 1990 Fujisawa claimed LyphoMed filed false information with the FDA between 1980  


through 1989 in connection with thirty five ANDAs. Information was either misrepresented, destroyed or was 


not recorded where it concerned adverse test results1.  


 
Figure 2 Fujisawa vs. Kapoor2 


This is not a case of isolated executive malfeasance on the part of Kapoor: the situation at LyphoMed got so bad 


that at one point the FDA said it would stop issuing new approvals until Good Manufacturing Practices were 


re-established. 


 
Figure 3 Fujisawa vs. Kapoor

Viceroy Research Group 4 viceroyresearch.org 


Yordon is happy to trumpet his role at Lyphomed but neglects to mention that Fujisawa went on to sue former 


owner John Kapoor for US$805.6m. Yordon jumped ship shortly after Lyphomed’s acquisition, appearing at 


Gensia, Inc in 1991. 


As President of LyphoMed, we find it difficult to believe Yordon was unaware of the Company’s violations of 


FDA rules. 


For those who keep up with major pharma frauds, LyphoMed CEO John Kapoor went on to take over the reigns 


at Insys Therapeutics, and was found guilty of RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, etc3. 


Gensia 


Yordon joined Gensia, Inc. as Vice President, Sales and Marketing announced on January 1, 19914. Claims that 


he founded Gensia Pharmaceuticals (sometimes Gensia Laboratories) are slightly misleading considering this 


was a subsidiary acquired from Kendall Co. later that year5,6. 


Gensia’s share price crashed in September 1992 after the phase 3 trials of its heart medication Arasine proved 


unclear with primary analysis failing to show any significant benefit.  


 
Figure 4 – Extract, NY Times7 


This time Yordon appears to have stuck it out: the next move is to American Pharmaceutical Partners where 


Yordon signs a contract dated December 12, 19978. 


How could Yordon be a “founding member” of Gensia Laboratories, considering it was acquired from Kendall 


Laboratories ?

American Pharmaceutical Partners 


Yordon served as Co-Chief Operating Officer for American Pharmaceutical Partners (APP) from 1997 to 2005 


including a period during which Yordon and others were alleged to have made false and misleading statements 


about the prospects of an anti-cancer drug, Abraxane. Plaintiffs alleged that Yordon and other officers of APP 


made misleading statements during the clinical trial process for Abraxane, a protein-bound paclitaxel 


formulation.  


 
 Figure 5 William Morris et al v. American Bioscience, Soon-Shiong, Brown, Yordon & Williams  


Originally company statements claimed the Abraxane regimen could be administered “without steroid pre-


treatment”, without growth factors, and be tolerated at a much higher dose than Taxol. As was later revealed, 


none of these were true: 


 
Figure 6 William Morris et al v. American Bioscience, Soon-Shiong, Brown, Yordon & Williams 


Clinical trials were administered without routine steroid pre-treatment, meaning some patients did in fact 


receive it.  


Why did Athenex hire Yordon, who had already made false and misleading statements 


about another cancer drug in clinical trials? 


How can Athenex investors trust Yordon given his past behaviour of deceiving investors?
Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyresearch.org 


Sagent 


Yordon resigned as CEO and Chairman Sagent Pharmaceuticals in March 2015 but remained a director. Also 


announced was the departure of James Hussey, Sagent’s president9. Both Yordon and Hussey migrated to 


Athenex: because it’s much easier to take investors for a ride with a backup driver. 


Before his departure as CEO, Sagent had already engaged two advisors to seek acquiring parties: 


 
Figure 7 Case: 1:16-cv-07973 


Sagent was later embroiled in a shareholder class action over the company’s acquisition by Nichi-Iko 


Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The complaint alleges that the board and its advisors Morgan Stanley and Perella 


Weinberg had failed to negotiate a fair deal for the company’s shareholders; agreeing to certain terms which 


only benefitted management.  


We cannot be sure of what transpired at Sagent but it certainly fits a pattern of cashing out and leaving investors 


high and dry. 


Why did Yordon hire two investment advisors at Sagent, whose omission of certain 


information led to a worse outcome for shareholders? 


Key Takeaways 


Athenex investors should be aware of Yordon’s history of overpromising and under-delivering, often with 


disastrous results for everyone except themselves. 


Yordon is not squirrelled away in some lab, he is front and center of the company’s operations as Chief Operating 


Officer. His pal James Hussey jumped ship in May 2018 leaving his post as Executive Vice President, Athenex 


Pharmaceutical Division. We call Yordon out to detail in full his employment history and involvement with the 


events above.
