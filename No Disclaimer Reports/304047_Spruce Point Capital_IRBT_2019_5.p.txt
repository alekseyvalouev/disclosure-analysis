Executive Summary

Shark Set To Attack Roomba At The High End of The 
RVC Market: Reiterate Strong Sell On IRBT And 
60% - 80% Downside Risk 


Competition Intensifying At The High-End Of The Robot Vacuum Market, Impeding On Roomba’s Core Market
• Release Of High-End RV950 Shark Robot Vacuum Appears Imminent: Spruce Point recently discovered that Shark is prepared to release the RV950 – a high-end robot 


vacuum with features comparable to those of the Roomba i7, but priced at a 25% discount. Product listings for the vacuum have already been prepared on Wayfair and 
Walmart’s online stores. Shark’s entry into the lower and middle tiers of the market in 2017 represented one of the first non-Roomba robot vacuum product launches by 
a recognizable and respected home appliance brand, and Shark has since competed aggressively with iRobot’s mid-tier vacuums and has successfully taken market share. 
We believe that Shark will apply similar competitive pressure to the higher end of the robot vacuum market with the launch of the RV950.


• RV950 Representative Of Trend Of Heightened Competition At Top Tier Of The RVC Market: We see the impending release of the RV950, and other recent product 
launches, as evidence that iRobot competitors – once considered “off-brand” or “no-name” products occupying the lower end of the market – are rapidly closing the 
technological gap between themselves and Roomba, and that robovacs are thus becoming increasingly commoditized. Formerly-unknown brands are quickly gaining 
respect from the tech world and are seen as legitimate Roomba alternatives. Even then, competing products continue to be priced at a material discount to comparable 
Roombas. We estimate that pricing pressure at the high end of the market could cost iRobot ~12 points of gross margin on its Roomba segment.


Non-Roomba Products Unlikely To Move The Needle
• Aggressive Braava Projections Unlikely To Come To Fruition: Management is aiming for Braava to contribute 10% of FY19 total sales. Given iRobot’s FY19 sales guidance, 


this implies that management expects Braava sales to grow by over 50% in FY19. This would be entirely out of line with historical growth rates and with Braava’s recent 
performance in markets in which it has achieved some level of popularity – namely Japan. We believe that Braava sales will grow by no more than 20-25% in FY19 at the 
high end. Management’s Braava guidance also implies that it expects Roomba sales to grow by just 14-17% in FY19, a meaningful step down from recent growth rates.


• Terra A Poor Fit For The U.S. Market: After nearly a decade of development, iRobot finally announced the launch of its robot lawnmower on the Q4 FY18 call. iRobot has 
a tremendously poor record of developing and selling products outside of its core Roomba line – particularly products meant for outdoor use. We believe that the Terra 
is a poor fit for the U.S., where lawns are large and difficult to navigate by global standards. In Europe, where the robot mower market is already developed, iRobot will 
compete with established, respected brands with technologically-advanced mowers, yet with sufficiently deep pockets to weather a price war. This stands in contrast to 
the conditions which led to Roomba’s success in the U.S., where it came to dominate the market by establishing itself as a first mover and a relatively premium product.


• Valuation Makes Little Sense: IRBT shares have run up from $75 to as high as $130 through the recent bull market on little more than sporadic optimism regarding U.S.-
China trade talks. We find it puzzling that IRBT shares reacted so positively to what was at best a mixed Q4 earnings call. We believe that increasing competition and 
downward pricing pressure will continue to weigh on top-line growth and margins, and that multiples are tremendously overextended – how else could every single sell-
side price target be below current share prices? A potential tariff hike to 25% remains a material risk for iRobot, and could drive another ~15% downside to IRBT shares.


Spruce Point has discovered new evidence that SharkNinja (“Shark”) – a major competitor of iRobot (IRBT or “the Company”) – is primed to 
release a new, high-end, smart, and home connected robot vacuum cleaner (RVC) priced at a 25% discount to the comparable Roomba i7. Another 


competitor has already begun selling a comparable product at close to half the price of the i7. Whereas Shark and other competitors have until 
now taken share primarily at the lower and middle tiers of the robot vacuum market, they now will compete at the premium tier. The consensus 
among bulls is that Roomba is a technologically superior product and the market leader at the premium tier, affording it some protection from 


pricing pressure. We believe that this narrative is no longer valid: iRobot will now face legitimate competition at the high end of the market.
Management has attempted to drum up investor confidence by pitching the potential of its non-Roomba products – specifically, its robot mop 


(Braava) and forthcoming robo-lawnmower (Terra) – but we believe that guidance is aggressive on the former (by management’s own admission), 
and we are skeptical that the latter will meet with commercial success in the U.S. Investors should brace for significant disappointment.

Launch Of New SharkNinja Robot Vacuum 
Appears To Be Imminent


Through the close monitoring of retailer websites, Spruce Point has found evidence that SharkNinja (“Shark”) is poised to release 
the RV950 Shark ION Robot Vacuum – a new, high-end robot vacuum which has yet to be announced by Shark or anyone else. 
Wayfair prematurely published a listing for the RV950 which was supposed to remain hidden from public view. The page was 


promptly taken down. Walmart also recently published a listing for the RV950. While the page has not been taken down, it is not 
searchable through Walmart’s internal search engine, and the product is currently listed as “Out of stock.” The page appears not


to be meant for public consumption.

As of March 6, 2019, a Google search for “‘RV950’ Shark Ion” (“RV950” in quotes) yields only eight results: the (now dead) Wayfair page, the 
Walmart page, and six copycat bot sites which scan and publish content from Walmart’s website. Shark has made no public mention of the 


forthcoming RV950, and neither the public nor the press appear to be aware of the product.

RV950 Shark ION Will Play At The High End Of 
The Market


Through our last several updates on iRobot, we have highlighted the unique threat posed by Shark: whereas most iRobot 
competition historically came from unrecognizable Chinese companies which sell largely or exclusively online, SharkNinja is a


recognizable brand in the small appliance space with established relationships with big box distributors. Since Shark introduced
its first robot vacuum in September 2017, it has mostly played in the middle tier of the robot vacuum market. However, the 


forthcoming RV950 appears to be a high-end product almost a year in the making.


Current Shark ION Lineup: Mid-Tier RV950: Higher-End


In May 2018, SharkNinja filed a trademark for “Multi Room IQ,” the name of the RV950’s new advanced navigation system. This suggests that 
Shark has been developing this system for at least a year. Based on descriptions of this system, we believe that it is at least comparable with 


the navigation system employed by the high-end Roomba i7, iRobot’s most advanced vacuum to date.

RV950 Matches The Newest, Most Advanced 
Features Of The Roomba i7


The newest, most advanced features of the Roomba i7 which iRobot has been keenest on marketing are its navigation system and 
smart mapping capabilities. Visual localization allows the Roomba to better avoid obstacles and to keep track of its cleaning path, 


while smart mapping allows users to instruct the Roomba to clean specific rooms or virtual zones, which can be labelled and called 
out using Amazon Echo or Google Assistant.


Per its product description on Walmart’s website, the RV950 Shark ION appears to match both of these features.

iRobot has pitched itself as the “connectivity play” and the “smart 
home play” in the robot vacuum market: until recently, it was the 
only robot vacuum which users could instruct to clean specific 


rooms through Amazon Echo or Google Assistant. It is clear that the 
RV950 will also have this feature.


With competitors matching iRobot’s connectivity capabilities so 
quickly, just how unique of a “smart home play” is iRobot?

Peers Are Competing At The Premium Tier And 
Quickly Closing Technological Gaps


In each of our reports on iRobot, the entry of new competitors and the commoditization of the robot vacuum have been major 
pillars of our short thesis. While the market has indeed been flooded with low-end robot vacuums since we first published on 
iRobot in 2014, bulls argue that iRobot still reigns at the premium end of the spectrum, where low-cost Chinese competitors 


supposedly cannot compete with iRobot’s top-flight technology. However, with the impending introduction of the RV950 Shark 
ION, none of iRobot’s most advanced technological features will be unique to its own products – and each will be available in a 


product sold at a lower price.

iRobot competitors no longer reside 
exclusively at the bottom tier of the 
market – but are still significantly 
cheaper than comparable iRobot 


vacuums.
As it did when it first entered the 
middle tier of the market with its 


first generation of robot vacuums, 
Shark could put unique pressure on 


iRobot as the first recognizable 
brand to compete with the Company 


at the higher end of the market in 
North America.

Formerly Low-End Competitor Leveling The 
Playing Field


As recently as December 2018, iRobot management labeled Shark ION robot vacuums as “low-end” Chinese products, and 
defended iRobot’s positioning in the market by emphasizing its unique caché as the leading premium brand. With Shark set to 


release a robot vacuum technologically equivalent to iRobot’s top-tier vacuums, but priced at a 25% discount, Roomba’s 
perception as a uniquely premium product will continue to be challenged, and the Company will experience pricing pressure not


only among its more basic offerings, but among its top-tier vacuums as well.


Raymond James Tech Conference – December 2018


“Over the last several years, we've had more competition coming in from what we call our entry 


price points or the low end of our range. A lot of those are products that are coming from China 


either directly under Chinese brands or occasionally where you'll find well-established brands OEM-


ing Chinese products. So, for example, there's a product on the market from Shark; it's actually 


an Ecovacs Chinese product that they've put their name on. So, the type of competition has 


changed over the years and – but there's always a lot of it and I expect that there will continue to be 


more and more. I think a lot of these companies see this as – they see the growth opportunity that we 


see, they see our success in this market, and they want to have a piece of that pie.”


- Alison Dean – CFO, iRobot


Formerly low-to-mid tier brands are set to enter the high end and compete with iRobot on its own ground.


This will produce immediate pricing pressure and, over time, will further erode iRobot’s market share.

Management Erroneously Believes That It Is Alone At 
The Top – In China, It Is Just Another Robot Vacuum


The Chinese robot vacuum market provides interesting insight into just how competitive the global market could become through
the coming years. Whereas iRobot has a dominant (though declining) share in most markets – a product of its first-mover 


advantage – the Company has only 6% share in what is a much more fragmented Chinese marketplace. CEO Colin Angle recently 
expressed that iRobot will be making a push to grow share in China through the near-term, believing that it has an opportunity to 


establish itself at the high end of the market. However, whereas Chinese robot vacuums suffer from poor brand recognition 
abroad, Chinese consumers appear more comfortable with these brands, as reflected by their relatively strong market share in 


China. As these brands have grown more recognizable internationally, global consumers have become more willing to see them as
legitimate Roomba competitors at the high end of the market rather than as cheap “off-brand” alternatives.


“We see an opportunity to grow our market 


share in China, especially in the high-end 


segment. Our team in China has been working 


to optimize our market strategies. China is the 


largest [market], but not for iRobot…. We 


believe we're on the right growth path now. 


China will be our largest market.”


- Colin Angle – CEO, iRobot – China Daily


We expect that, over time, as consumers increasingly see non-Roomba robot vacuums as quality products with features similar to high-end 
Roombas, the global market share distribution will gradually grow to resemble the Chinese market.


Source: iRobot Investor Presentation, March 2019


How easy will it be to grow into the high end 
of the Chinese market when Chinese brands 


are well-regarded and already entrenched 
among Chinese consumers?


Chinese brands have been growing into the 
high end of the U.S. by offering vacuums 
similar to high-end Roombas at 25-50% 
discounts. Will iRobot have to discount 


heavily to break into the Chinese market?

Competitors Are Becoming More Mainstream 
Across All Tiers Of The Market


Whereas competitors were historically seen as “off-brand alternatives” to the recognizable Roomba brand, competing products 
have rapidly achieved mainstream acceptance. Notably, the Wall Street Journal reviewed iRobot, Shark, Neato, ECOVACS, and eufy 


in December, and found that alternative brands compared favorably to the Roomba. We believe that continued mainstream 
coverage of what were formerly considered “off-brands” will contribute to continued pricing pressure for Roomba – which is still


priced at a material premium to even high-end peers – and will facilitate share gains among competitors.


Is the high-end 
Roomba really 
worth a >200% 


premium to another 
robot vacuum rated 


comparably by a 
trusted, mainstream 


media source?


“Buying a robot vacuum is a bit like buying a car, in that there’s no one 


choice that’s right for everyone. If you’re only worried about the basics, 


you don’t need to spend much. The Eufy Robovac 30c is a good vacuum that 


takes the job out of your hands. I didn’t test its cheaper sibling, the $150 


Robovac 11s, but the only difference between the two is the Wi-Fi connection, 


so if you don’t care about the app, you can save even more money.”

Global Market Share Falling Off A Cliff By 
Management’s Own Admission


While iRobot continues to bank on expansion into the global robot vacuum TAM for top-line growth, competitors are taking 
significant share from Roomba. After hovering between 62-64% from CY14 through CY17, iRobot’s share of the global retail robot 


vacuum market cratered to 52% in CY18. This highlights the competitive pressures which iRobot is facing and will continue to face 
as competitors which were once seen as cheap “off-market” products are increasingly seen as legitimate high-end alternatives.

Competitors Impeding On iRobot’s Brick-And-
Mortar Presence


Could an increasing retail presence among competitors contribute to the forecasted drag on Roomba sales? Interestingly, 
management claimed that they saw no increase in competition at brick-and-mortar retailers in the U.S. through FY. However, we 
note that ECOVACS robot vacuums hit shelves for the first time in Q4 FY18. This would not only put pressure on retail sales for 
Roomba, but could help to improve the visibility and perception of competing brands which have until now been viewed as no-


name, lower-tier brands.


“In the U.S. we continue to see new competitive products 


selling through Amazon marketplace, but not on shelves of 


retailers where we still generate 60% of our domestic 


revenue.”

Competition Putting Visible Pressure On Sales


Despite the release of new, higher-end vacuums, average vacuum revenue per vacuum unit shipped continues to trend lower. In Q4 
FY18 – the first full period of availability for the i7 and i7+ – this metric fell to $238, its lowest point since Q2 2016. We see this as 
clear evidence that both the proliferation of new competitors and the rising quality of competing products is putting significant 


downward pricing pressure on the Roomba.

Competitive Landscape Becoming More 
Crowded At All Price Points


Management is aiming to grow Braava (mopping) revenue to 10% of total sales in FY19. We can use this not only to derive management’s 
implied Braava sales growth guidance for the coming year, but, using this implied growth, we can also back out implied Roomba (vacuum) 


growth guidance for FY19. Management’s total sales growth guidance of 17-20%, together with its Braava growth target, implies that it expects 
Roomba sales to grow by just ~17% through the year – a meaningful step down from 25% in FY18 and 37% in FY17.


Recent statements by management suggest that it plans to grow Braava sales largely through price increases, but we believe that price hikes 
would seriously hinder unit growth – particularly as the space becomes increasingly crowded, and as competitors begin to roll out more 


advanced dual robot vacuum-mops (something iRobot does not yet offer). Investors should not expect iRobot to be able to grow sales through 
price hikes just as pricing is coming under extreme pressure.

Japan was good for 25% YoY segment growth – could the U.S. really double that over the course of a year?


Is management telegraphing muted sales growth expectations for Roomba in FY19?

More Realistic Braava Sales Growth Could 
Result In A Meaningful Revenue Miss


If we assume more measured Braava revenue growth in line with historical levels (around 9% YoY), iRobot revenue could miss the guidance 
midpoint by ~4%.


With Braava’s “robust” Q4 in Japan producing 25% sales growth YoY for the mopping segment, we do not believe that total Braava sales growth 
will exceed 20-25% even in a bull-case scenario. Management’s target of >50% sales growth for the segment seems grossly unrealistic.

Robot Lawnmower Set To Become Another 
Failed Outdoor Product For iRobot


After years of development, management finally announced its much-anticipated robot lawnmower (Terra) on its Q4 FY18 conference call. This 
isn’t iRobot’s first attempt at selling outdoor robots, of course. The Company sold a gutter-cleaning robot (Looj) starting in 2008, but the 
product met with poor reviews and was discontinued in 2017 after contributing minimal sales. iRobot still sells a swimming pool cleaner 


(Mirra), but it is currently responsible for less than 1% of revenue after five full years on the market. We also note that, per management, the 
current iteration of the Terra is not iRobot’s first attempt at a robot lawnmower, having scrapped earlier versions.


iRobot has had almost no success branching outside of its core Roomba product, and has struggled even more to produce robots for outdoor 
use. We are highly skeptical that management has gotten it right with the Terra.

Robot Lawnmower Not Fit For U.S. Market –
And iRobot Is Late To The Game In Europe


iRobot plans to launch the Terra in Germany before doing a full U.S. rollout, likely because Europe already has an established market for robot 
lawnmowers. However, whereas iRobot found its initial success as a first-mover in the robot vacuum space, it will have to fight an uphill battle 
for market share in Europe against Husqvarna (45-60% share), Bosch (10-15%), and Honda (10-15%) – all well-regarded brands commanding a 


premium price, yet with sufficient scale to weather a price war. Growing lawnmower sales in Europe will not be as easy as was growing vacuum 
sales in the entirely untapped U.S. robot vacuum market of the early-to-mid 2000s.


Spruce Point notes that, while robotic lawnmowers have gained some traction in Germany and Scandinavia, lawns in these countries tend 
to be small, square, and flat, and therefore easily navigated by a small roving robot. U.S. lawns, on the other hand, tend to be much larger 


and irregularly-shaped, complicating the process of setting boundaries for the user (buried guide wires, as are used in Europe, might not be 
feasible for many U.S. homes). Steep slopes and divots could also entrap a robot lawnmower, particularly in inclement weather. Importantly, 


unskilled labor costs are much lower in the U.S. than in Europe, where users might opt for a robot vacuum as a cost-saving option.

Cash Flow From Operations


iRobot’s Free Cash Flow Will Continue To 
Decline In The Future


Both iRobot’s cash flow from operations and free cash flow have been in decline since FY16. This has been driven in part by 
growth in accounts receivable and inventory, which, as discussed in our previous two reports, appears suspicious to us given 


its recent acquisitions of European and Japanese distributors. With pricing pressure set to intensify with increasing 
competition, we anticipate continued operating cash flow compression going forward. At the same time, capital expenditures are 


forecast to rise to $40m in 2019 (from $32m in 2018) resulting in lower free cash flow.

Expanding The Credit Facility


iRobot doubled its credit facility in Q2 FY18, from $75M to $150M. We find this interesting given that, at the time, the Company had 
$89M of cash on its balance sheet and no debt, yet had no stated plans to engage in M&A. Why else would management expand its
revolver so dramatically? We fear that management has cash flow concerns going forward, and that OCF and FCF will continue to


be pressured through the coming quarters. Again, in line with our discussions in our last two reports, continued sales growth
matched by heavy spending on working capital would concern us following on its recent acquisition of international distributors.

Why “Buy” Or “Hold” A Stock With 13% 
Implied Downside?


Sell-side analysts remain bullish on IRBT, but the recent run-up in the stock has surpassed even the Street’s lofty price targets –
prompting two recent downgrades from Sidoti and Canaccord. Although every analyst recommends IRBT as a “Buy” or “Hold,” 
the stock is currently priced at a premium to every price target currently issued by the Street – and at this point, no analyst has 
factored in Shark’s pending entry into the high end of the market with the new RV950 model. The average analyst price target is 


13% below current levels and could fall further upon re-evaluating iRobot’s long term competitive positioning in the RVC market.


We believe that the stock has run up both with the broader market upswing and on sporadic news regarding the possibility of a
trade deal with China. However, while we note that the impending tariff hike remains an outstanding risk, we believe that the


stock is clearly overextended even if the tariff hike is cancelled.

Depending On Trade Negotiation Outcomes,
Spruce Point Sees 60%-80% Downside Risk In IRBT


The sell-side community appears content to build a 10% tariff into its models and take the resulting earnings as a safe projection. 
We remind investors that, while the 25% tariff on Chinese products has been delayed, no agreement has been reached as of yet,
and sentiment regarding the prospects of a deal seem to vary wildly by the day. Even if we take all other consensus estimates as


given, a more sane multiple combined with a 25% tariff starting in Q2 (and hitting the income statement in the middle of the quarter) 
would yield 60%-70% downside risk. We also note that management is committing more capex to the business, and will invest 


$40M in expanding and diversifying its supply chain in FY19. These projects will weigh on cash flow and introduce material 
execution risk to the business.


Using our own estimates, we see 60%-80% downside risk in the stock, depending on the outcome of upcoming trade talks.
