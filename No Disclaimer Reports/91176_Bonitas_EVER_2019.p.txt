INVESTOR QUESTION: “If www.everquote.com is where all the traffic is being driven, is there 


a way to get quote requests if traffic flow declines?” 





FORMER EVERQUOTE EMPLOYEE: “I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I mean you’ve got to 


remember what’s in their DNA is to drive people to their full form. Whether that’s through email 


marketing from their database, or display, or carrier traffic, or SEM, or SEO, ultimately, you’re 


running all that [web traffic] back through www.everquote.com full form.”  
 


Everquote Inc. (NASDAQ: EVER) (“Everquote” or the “Company”) generates revenue primarily from the sale of 


online auto insurance quote requests to large insurance providers such as Progressive, Geico, eSurance, Nationwide, 


Allstate, etc.  Calls with Everquote management and two former Everquote employees confirmed language from 


Everquote’s filings that web traffic to www.everquote.com remained the dominant source of Everquote’s quote 


requests which continue to be its largest driver of revenue and profitability.  On its 3Q’19 earning call, Everquote 


CFO John Wagner attributed Everquote’s 2019 revenue growth to an increase in website traffic volume to 


www.everquote.com: “For the balance of 2019, it’s been driven by the progress we’ve made in the execution within 


our traffic teams in terms of driving more consumers to the website.”   





In its 2019 10-Q’s Everquote disclosed that it had over 11+ million average monthly consumer visits to its website 


www.everquote.com.  However, independent data from leading online analytics provider www.similarweb.com 


(“SimilarWeb”) showed that www.everquote.com only had 4 million visits in September 2019, ~64% less than the 


reported 11+ million monthly consumer visits Everquote told investors in its 3Q’19 10-Q!  SimilarWeb showed 


website traffic to www.everquote.com was down 71% from January to September 2019 and was down 37% yr/yr in 


3Q’19, its lowest web traffic levels since November 2016.   





SimilarWeb website analytics data for the past 6 months suggests that the average consumer stayed on 


www.everquote.com for less than 90 seconds and did not visit 50% of the pages necessary to complete a 40+ field 


full-form quote request, casting further doubt on the credibility of Everquote’s reported quote request growth in 2019. 





We believe SimilarWeb’s website traffic metric data is credible.  Everquote’s own filings cited SimilarWeb as a 


credible source to support its claim as the “largest online marketplace for insurance shopping in the US”.  


SimilarWeb’s data was corroborated by two additional independent leading analytics providers (Alexa, the website 


analysis platform provided by Amazon, and Sitechecker) which also showed that Everquote generated significantly 


less web traffic and experienced weaker user analytics than suggested to investors in its promotional material and SEC 


filings.   





We ask, how did Everquote’s reported 3Q’19 quote requests grow 81% yr/yr and 22% qtr/qtr if web traffic to 


www.everquote.com declined 71% from January to September 2019 and was down 37% yr/yr in 3Q’19?!?

We attempted a comprehensive review of possibilities how Everquote might have grown quote requests with web 


traffic to www.everquote.com in decline.  These alternatives include an increased number of times a quote request 


was sold, increased web traffic conversion rate to completed full-form quote requests on www.everquote.com, 


increased purchase and resale activity of third party quote request leads, increased offline quote requests (calls, TV, 


radio), or that we failed to account for web traffic to Everquote’s other associated websites.  Comments from 


Everquote management and data analytics from SimilarWeb suggest that Everquote’s reported 2019 revenue and quote 


request growth were not driven by any one of these alternatives and that web traffic to www.everquote.com remained 


the dominant driver of quote requests in 2019. 





Insiders capitalized on Everquote’s increased stock price.  Since July 2019, Everquote insiders cashed in and sold US$ 


39 million worth of Everquote stock.  In addition to salaries and stock bonuses, Everquote paid US$ 10+ million in 


the last 18 months to Everquote insider’s privately-held companies for “providing website traffic referrals.”  Oddly, 


most of these privately-held insider marketing company websites displayed negligible website traffic which begs the 


question of whether the US$ 10+ million was a fair price for related party rendered services or whether the US$ 10+ 


million was just another way for insiders to benefit at the expense of Everquote’s minority shareholders.  





To us, the substantially lower actual web traffic to www.everquote.com suggests Everquote inflated its 2019 reported 


quote request growth to investors. We would not be surprised if time reveals that Everquote either (a) used a lower 


profit margin type of revenue and purchased more third party quote request from its verified partner network than 


claimed, (b) resold each quote request more times than claimed, (c) overstated web traffic and quote requests which 


suggests overstated unaudited revenues and profits, or (d) other unknowns.   





Without further information in the public domain, it is unclear to us where the truth ends and where the lies start from 


Everquote management about how it was able to achieve such incredible growth in quote requests and revenues in 


2019 while web traffic declined significantly to its dominant revenue driver, www.everquote.com.   





We are short Everquote and expect its stock to return to its pre-2019 price levels of ~US$ 5/share, a decline of 


~75%+ from current prices.

SIMILARWEB SHOWED 71% DECLINE IN WEBSITE TRAFFIC TO EVERQUOTE.COM IN 2019 





Everquote’s management told investors that its dramatic increase in 2019 quote request volume was a result of 


increased web traffic to www.everquote.com.  Everquote management disclosed that growth of web traffic to 


www.everquote.com in 2019 was not driven by one single source, rather the result of a broad range of sources using 


investments in technology and machine learning to optimize its marketing capabilities and efficiently drive consumers 


online to fill out a 40+ fields full-form for auto insurance quotes on www.everquote.com.  





On its 3Q’19 earning call, Everquote CFO John Wagner attributed Everquote’s 2019 revenue growth to an increase 


in website traffic volume to www.everquote.com: “For the balance of 2019, it’s been driven by the progress we’ve 


made in the execution within our traffic teams in terms of driving more consumers to the website.”  Calls with 


Everquote management and two former Everquote employees confirmed language from Everquote’s filings that web 


traffic to www.everquote.com remained the dominant source of Everquote’s quote requests which continue to be its 


largest driver of revenue and profitability.   





Everquote’s revenues are a function of revenue per quote request multipled by volume of quote requests sold.  In its 


2019 10-Q SEC filings, Everquote reported that its revenue per quote request sold was flat to down throughout 2019 


while quote request volumes spiked to all-time highs from 3.3 to 5.5 million per quarter in 2019.

Everquote’s own filings cited SimilarWeb as a credible source to support its claims about its market presence.  In its

of SimilarWeb’s dataset. 





We filled out a quote request online and confirmed that the process is still a 6+ page and ~40+ field intake form similar

OTHER POSSIBLE QUOTE REQUEST SOURCES DISCLOSED AS IMMATERIAL  





We attempted a comprehensive review of possibilities how Everquote might have grown quote requests with web 


traffic to www.everquote.com in decline.  These alternatives include an increased number of times a quote request 


was sold, increased web traffic conversion rate to completed full-form quote requests on www.everquote.com, 


increased purchase and resale activity of third party quote request leads, increased offline quote requests (calls, TV, 


radio), or that we failed to account for web traffic to Everquote’s other associated websites.   





As part of our due diligence, we spoke with Everquote SVP Joseph Sanborn and two former Everquote employees 


whom each agreed that a decline in web traffic to www.everquote.com would have a negative impact on Everquote’s 


financial performance and result in fewer quote requests and lower revenues.  





Comments from Everquote management and data analytics from SimilarWeb suggest that Everquote’s reported 2019 


revenue and quote request growth were not driven by any one of these alternatives and that web traffic to 


www.everquote.com remained the dominant driver of quote requests in 2019. 





On a recent call, Everquote SVP Sanborn confirmed that non-www.everquote.com website traffic was in its “early 


days” and a “small percentage” of reported revenues.  


 
INVESTOR QUESTION: “And then outside of the direct web traffic and other than the other web properties 


you own and the verified partner network,  you know how much revenue relate to inbound calls or other things 


that are outside of www.everquote.com and web properties and verified partner network?” 





EVERQUOTE SVP ANSWER: “So a lot of these things are early days, inbound calls are small percentage, 


verified partner was a small percentage same thing. 





We see them as, all growth levers so we look at that when you look at these different issues we talk about in 


our Q2 Q3 calls and Q1 we also mentioned this as well.  We view them as all different levers to drive growth. 


As we look to more ways to acquire consumers and also recognize how to engage consumers can vary. So 


what's the best way to do it. So that inbound call program is part of that. Another way to drive traffic. So but 


all of that, none of those are you know significant percentages of the business today but they're all experiencing 


nice growth trajectories and we view them as over time as you build this organization larger and larger, we’re 


going to have a more diversified revenue not only by adding more verticals but also having different ways to 


attract, so certain traffic for whatever reason becomes more desirable or less desirable we’ll sort of have this 


portfolio theory that we think helps us to be able to through all that still drive great results and so a lot 


initiatives as we get to get inbound calls, VPN or all sort of part of that piece.”

On its 2Q’19 and 3Q’19 earnings calls, Everquote’s CFO John Wagner disclosed that its growth in revenues came 


from the growth in quote request volume and that Everquote experienced a slight decline in the number of referrals 


(i.e. the number of times a quote request is sold) because of its increased quote request volume.

On a recent call, Everquote SVP Sanborn discussed its monetization model, specifically how quote requests are driven 


by web traffic at www.everquote.com and how its 2019 quote request growth has led to a slight decline in the number 


of referrals. 


 
EVERQUOTE SVP ANSWER: “So the metric we've discussed we've talked about is quote requests and 


quote requests in Q3 were up 81% in Q3. So that meant that consumers coming to the website who completed 


information trying to get a quote it was up dramatically in Q3 to 81%. If you look at the price we were paying 


per quote request was actually down slightly… 





If you look at that you've probably got three or four options that exit you know either click to call, click to quote 


and you may get brought right into a carrier's website with a quote or you may get click to call if it's say State 


Farm uses their captain agents and they want you to talk to an agent. 





Right. So consumers get three or four choices on average and they click a couple of those options and that's 


when they click that's when you monetize. That's when we get the referral. And so today we've we've got around 


two referrals per quote request it was down slightly in Q3 in part because the volume of quote requests went 


up so much that it takes something a little bit time to get supply and carrier side to balance out. But that's 


roughly the model.” 
Source: Due Diligence Call with Everquote SVP Sanborn 





In its 3Q’19 10-Q, Everquote reported a decrease in the number of referrals per quote request. 





 
Source: Everquote 3Q’19 Form 10-Q – p.25 





Corroborated by multiple web analytics providers, Everquote did not appear to benefit from a sudden significant 


increase in its conversion rate of web traffic to completed quote requests.  www.everquote.com’s 6+ page consumer 


quote request intake form had not changed in at least 18 months, and other traffic analytics such as average visit 


duration, pages per visit and bounce rate in 3Q’19 remained consistent when compared to averages over the last 3 


years, suggesting little has changed in consumer web traffic behavior on www.everquote.com in 2019 as compared to 


prior years.  





 
Source: https://www.similarweb.com/  








Everquote management disclosed on earnings calls that volume from alternative sources, such as inbound calls and 


its Verified Partner Network (“VPN”) (i.e. the purchase and resale of third-party quote requests), did not significantly 


impact Everquote’s results.

Everquote SVP Sanborn confirmed that VPN remained a very small revenue contributor though 3Q’19. 


 
INVESTOR QUESTION: “O.K. Great. Moving back to the Verified Partner Network, how much of revenues 


is that and to be honest how exactly does this part of the business work?” 





EVERQUOTE SVP SANBORN ANSWER: “Sure. So it’s a small portion of revenues today… single digit 


percent. So it’s a small portion but we can see it’s a real opportunity for us and that’s why we sometimes 


highlight it in our causes for new growth area.”  
Source: Due Diligence Call with Everquote SVP Sanborn  





As part of its VPN, when Everquote purchased and resold a third-party quote request, Everquote would not qualify 


the quote request lead in the same manner as if the web traffic went through www.everquote.com and completed its 


40+ consumer submitted full form quote request.  Since Everquote claimed that its VPN third-party quote requests 


contained “substantially all the same information” as quote requests generated through www.everquote.com, 


Everquote appears to add very little value to purchased and resold third-party quote requests. 





While Everquote management confirmed that Everquote’s VPN accounted for a very small portion of revenues, it is 


possible that Everquote management lied to us and understated the amount of revenues generated in 2019 from its 


VPN.  If this was true, and Everquote’s reported quote requests and revenues were true, then we would expect 


Everquote’s profit margins to contract, not expand.  A call with a former Everquote employee still active in the lead 


aggregation business confirmed that profitability is lower for leads bought from third party aggregators versus leads 


generated on a proprietary site, such as  www.everquote.com.   





Some may argue that we failed to account for web traffic from Everquote’s other associated websites. It is common 


to see affiliate marketers use alternative website domain names to try to lower expenditures on high cost per click 


words on search engines.  A reverse domain ownership lookup showed that Everquote had 843 different website 


domains registered to its name. We inputted each one of Everquote’s 843 domains into SimilarWeb and found that 


only 5 out of the 843 domains, including www.everquote.com, had monthly visits over 100,000.   





Three of Everquote’s top referral sites to its desktop website are from Everquote’s affiliated sites, www.provide-


insurance.com, www.provide-auto-insurance.com and www.usautoinsurancenow.com.  Since Everquote’s other 


associated website domains refer traffic to www.everquote.com, this traffic was already included in SimilarWeb’s 


reported figure for www.everquote.com consumer monthly visits.

RECENT INCREASE IN INSIDER SELLING 





So far in 2019, Everquote has been the top performing Russell 2000 company (non-biotech) as its stock price increased 


650%+.   Everquote’s incredible 2019 turnaround growth story drove Everquote’s stock price from US$ 5 to over US$ 


38 in 11 months.   





Insiders capitalized on Everquote’s price appreciation and since July 2019, Everquote insiders cashed in and sold US$ 


39 million worth of Everquote stock.  Whether or not each insiders are aware of the nefarious activity with Everquote’s 


website traffic and quote requests, various insiders have been selling stock.

US$ 10 MM PAID FOR MINIMAL RELATED PARTY WEB TRAFFIC REFERRALS 





In addition to salaries and stock bonuses, Everquote paid US$ 10+ million in the last 18 months to Everquote insider’s 


privately-held companies for “providing website traffic referrals.”  Oddly, most of these privately-held insider 


marketing company websites displayed negligible website traffic which begs the question of whether the US$ 10+ 


million was a fair price for related party rendered services or whether the US$ 10+ million was just another way for 


insiders to benefit at the expense of Everquote minority shareholders.  





Since its IPO in 2Q’2018, Everquote paid US$ 10.3 million to related parties “for providing website traffic referrals”.  


Everquote laid out in its Prospectus that it signed “various data license and marketing services agreements” with its 


related parties which provided marketing services to Everquote by “delivering Everquote-related advertisements 


through websites, social media platforms, emails and other marketing campaigns”.  2 





We would expect in each of the 4 different advertisement categories mentioned by Everquote to provide website traffic 


referrals to www.everquote.com. Websites, social media and email campaigns each use reference hyperlinks to drive 


traffic to a website url. Other marketing campaigns could refer to the use of TV, billboards, telemarketing, or the 


purchase of full-form leads from other third-party marketers, but Everquote management was explicitly clear that 


these marketing channels contributed very little to Everquote’s growth in 2019 quote requests. 





We wanted to know whether the US$ 10.3 million was a fair price for related party services rendered or whether the 


US$ 10.3 million was just another way for insiders to benefit at the expense of Everquote minority shareholders.  





Our due diligence included a reverse lookup of websites registered to each of the related party companies in 


Everquote’s SEC filings.  All but one of these related party websites had negligible web traffic and many websites 


simply did not work.  





Cogo Labs, LLC (“Cogo Labs”) was co-founded by David Blundin, the co-founder and Chairman of Everquote.  Cogo 


Labs describes itself as an internet startup incubator on its website, www.cogolabs.com.  A reverse whois domain 


lookup showed that Cogo Labs owns 5 other domains, but none of them is active or had any traffic in the past 3 


months.   





Cognius, LLC (“Cognius”) describes itself as “a leading deliverer of targeted content to over 25 million Americans” 


on its website, www.coginus.com. In addition to cognius.com, a reverse whois analysis showed that Cognius owns 


234 other domains, but none of them, including www.coginus.com had monthly visits over 1,000 in the past 3 months. 





Affiliate Media Network, Inc. (“AMN”) shares the same physical office address as Link Ventures, LLLP (“Link 


Ventures”) and describes itself as “a leader in online lead generation, offering a secure centralized location for buyers 


and sellers of leads to increase business” on its website, www.affiliatemedianetwork.com. 3   In addition to 


www.affiliatemedianetwork.com, a reverse whois analysis reveals that AMN owns 4 other domains, but 3 of them is 


inactive and did not have any traffic in the past 3 months. 





Reference Advisor, LLC (“Reference Advisor”) shares the same address as Link Ventures and AMN and describes 


itself as “providing our clients with best-in-class email marketing solutions” on its website 


www.referenceadvisor.com.  In addition to www.referenceadvisor.com, a reverse whois analysis showed that 


Reference Advisor owns 3 other domains, but none are active or had any traffic in the past 3 months. 





Meta42, LLC (“Meta42”) describes itself as “a data-driven online marketing company” on its website, meta42.co.  


Other than meta42.co, a reverse whois analysis does not show other domains that are owned by Meta42.  According 


to data from SimilarWeb, meta42.co had less than 1,000 monthly visits in the last 3 months.

Tenizen, Inc.’s LinkedIn profile disclosed www.tenizen.com as the company website and describes itself as “the 


newest company to launch from the Cogo Labs venture accelerator”.4  However, the website www.tenizen.com does 


not seem to be working and data from SimilarWeb showed that it did not receive any traffic in the last 3 months. 





 
Source: https://www.reversewhois.io/; https://www.name.com/whois-lookup; https://www.similarweb.com/ 





We think the lack of web traffic to the websites of Everquote insider’s private companies suggests that Everquote paid 


US$ 10.3 million for something other than website traffic.  Whether fair or above market prices were paid by 


Everquote to insiders waits to be discovered by the power of subpoena.

APPANNIE AND SIMILARWEB SHOWED LITTLE TRACTION FOR EVERDRIVE APP 








 
Source: https://www.everquote.com/ 








Evidence suggests that Everquote’s proprietary safe-driving app had limited success despite management’s excitement 


for its future as a proprietary generator of high value quote requests. 





In 2016, Everquote launched its social safe-driving mobile app EverDrive.  EverDrive was designed to be installed on 


a user’s phone and when activated, EverDrive would record information about the user’s driving habits.5  Everquote’s 


2019 quarterly earnings calls and 10-Qs highlighted the purported successes of EverDrive’s growth and management’s 


expectation for EverDrive to generate meaningful quote requests for Everquote in the future.  





However, independent evidence from AppAnnie showed a significant decline in new user downloads and usage of the 


EverDrive app in 3Q’19.

Android EverDrive App

AppAnnie’s reported limited use of EverDrive was corroborated by SimilarWeb.  





          
Source: AppAnnie 





We consider review counts as a rough proxy for app engagement.  If there are a lot of reviews, positive or negative, it 


suggests that the app is being used.   





EverDrive user review counts for both the andriod and iPhone apps showed limited review engagement from 


customers, with a majority of users posting negative reviews about the apps’ functionality.   





To us the evidence suggests that Everquote had not experienced recent success with user adoption for its EverDrive 


app and EverDrive did not provide any meaningful contribution as either a revenue generator or a cost mitigation tool 


for Everquote in 2019.
