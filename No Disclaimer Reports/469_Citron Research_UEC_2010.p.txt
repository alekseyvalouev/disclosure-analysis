CITRON RESEARCH
UPDATES URANIUM
ENERGY (AMEX:UEC)


Banned Stock Promoters, Secret
Offshore Accounts, and Foreign
Management with a history of frauds
and failures …Yellowcake Anyone??


In 2007, Citron introduced the wild tale of Uranium
Energy, while it traded on the OTCBB under the
symbols URME with a series of articles.

The stock subsequently went from $7 to under .30
cents.  Yet, recently with uranium back in the
spotlight as investors look at the increase China
demand, even the “sketchiest” of uranium stocks
seemed to have caught a bid…with that we re-
introduce Uranium Energy.  (AMEX:UEC)


As mentioned in the previous articles, management
is associated with a history of companies that have

promised the sky and delivered …. nothing!


Who is Behind This Uranium “Deal”?
Alan Lindsay – Chairman of the Board.  Mr Lindsay
is a career “deal guy” who has left behind nothing
but companies that have promised high hopes and
left investors with empty pockets.  Mr. Lindsay’s ties
extend to some of the more notorious stock
promoters in Vancouver.  A most noteworthy
association was Genemax – the supposed cancer
vaccine stock, and its CEO James Dale Davidson.


In recent SEC �lings, Alan Lindsay is involved with
the following companies:

Or, our favorite is MIV Therapeutics in which Mr.
Lindsay just resigned as President, CEO, and
Chairman in March of this year.  For years the
company billed itself as “a leading developer of
next-generation biocompatible coatings and
advanced drug delivery systems”.  Now the
company is on the pink sheets with a skull and
crossbones warning for either unethical
promotional activity or fraud.

[http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MIVI/quote]


So who is really running The Show?
What makes MIV interesting is much like UEC, it is
dual listed on the Frankfurt Exchange. Why would a
Texas Uranium company need to be listed in
Frankfurt?  More disturbing is why was the investor
contact in Frankfurt “International Market Trend”
which belongs to none other than G Brent Pierce a
man who was a consultant to UEC who holds the
unique distinction of being one of the few people
�ned and sanctioned by securities regulators in
both Canada and the United States.

Notice Grant Atkins, Brent Pierce’s sidekick on the
above link.  He was also a founder, CFO and
director of UEC.


Then we have Amir Adnani, age 32, running the
company as CEO and the mouthpiece.  He is board
chairman Alan Lindsay’s son-in-law.  His credentials

Vancouver based investor relations �rm called
Blender Media- that is it.


Obviously a team of Canadian stock promoters
cannot make a real business mining uranium in
Texas.  While they might be the ultimate decision
makers, the man on the ground is Harry Anthony. 
Mr. Anthony is the face of the company to Texans. 
While we do not discredit Mr. Anthony’s expertise in
uranium and do not believe he personally was
responsible for any wrongdoing, we just simply pull
up his resume to see if he is capable of being at the
helm of a $400 million company.


The last projects in which we see his involvement
are from 1988-1990, over 20 years ago:  both
turned out to be “environmentally challenged” and
never turned any revenue or pro�ts for the
company.  This is not to say that Mr. Anthony is a
“bad man”, it is just saying…where is his track
record of success?


Bending the Truth for Fun and Pro�t
The company is still indulging in misleading PR’s to
promote its stock.  Most recently, it issued this
piece, boasting a “Major Advance” in its 3 ½ year
battle to get permits approved to mine uranium in
Goliad County, South Texas.


http://�nance.yahoo.com/news/Uranium-Energy-
Corp-Announces-prnews-3176412865.html?
x=0&.v=100
[https://�nance.yahoo.com/news/Uranium-Energy-
Corp-Announces-prnews-3176412865.html?
x=0&.v=100]


Soon after the company released this promotional
piece, they raised $27.5 mil in a private placement. 
But is this release even accurate?


The stock was about $3 on September 30th, and
rose all through October, when the company issued
a dilutive $27.5 million private placement at $3.40
per unit, including a share of stock and a half a
warrant exercisable at $3.95.

The problem is, this PR is materially misleading. 
Read the judge’s own words from the conclusion (p.
148), of his ruling, in which he clearly states that the
applications for mining be remanded for further
evidence, or


“[i]f the Commission determines that such
remand is not feasible or desirable then the
[Judge] recommends that the [Applications]
be denied.”


The Judge also makes clear that the applicant failed
to satisfy its burden of proof on multiple issues:  F,
G, H, R and T.   For example, the Judge states (p. 49
of PFD) that:


“[t]he Commission’s action on the application
should not be completed until these
questions are resolved within the record.”


Apparently, the analysts knew there were potential
problems.  Even RBC admitted as much in their
November 17 note, where they put an
underperform on the stock with the caveat
“Additionally, we believe Uranium Energy could
encounter permitting issues at its Goliad Project
which, in turn, could delay initial production beyond
2011.”


(Sorry we can’t reprint the note for copyright
reasons)


The other analyst who covers this issue, CIBC, sees
an eventual favorable ruling for the Goliad project
but still has a price target of $4.75, and that is
assuming management executes on all cylinders.


So what does the future look like for UEC????


Without Goliad- it is a quick death.  With Goliad it
can be a slow bleed — you decide.


In recent PR’s UEC proudly touts how it has begun
production at its Palangana site, and concentration
operations at its Hobson Processing plant.  Note
there are no �nancial �gures published with these
announcements.  The reason is the revenue from
this tiny operation is inconsequential – a bus token
relative to UEC’s $400 million market cap.  UEC’s
Goliad property, which has over 3 times more
5/18/2018 Citron Research Updates Uranium Energy (AMEX:UEC) – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/citron-research-updates-uranium-energy-amexuec/ 6/9


estimated uranium than Palangana and represents
over half of UEC’s purported resource, has been
tied up in legal and environmental objections to
permitting for the last 3 ½ years.  (SEC regulations
do not allow these types of resources to be claimed
as “reserves”.)


Both analyst �rms that cover UEC disclose intent to
perform investment banking for the company, so
they have no incentive to be pessimistic.  
Nevertheless, they maintain twelve month $4.75
and $5.00 price targets.  Neither project has any
possibility of meaningful revenues before 2012.  
The most realistic way to estimate valuation is to
use a factor of $6 to $8 per lb of in-ground
resource.  This would yield a market valuation for
UEC of around $96 million, or around $1.50 per
share. You could add back 40c per share of cash to
a round $2 per share valuation estimate.  The
di�erence between that value and the company’s
current $400 million + market cap is stu� that
nuclear dreams are made of.


For investors wanting to speculate on uranium
resources, compare UEC to URRE – which controls a
purported 100 million pounds of uranium resource
— over 8 times UEC’s uranium resources, yet trades
for $100 million less market cap than UEC!


The only analyst positive on this stock, Haywood
Securities, is located in Vancouver and doesn’t
even have an o�ce in the US.  What do you think?


Keep in mind though, that there is no pending or
expected shortage of uranium.  It is mined using a
variety of methods in dozens of countries all over
the world, with Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada
sourcing 60% of the world’s supply.

tons of fuel-grade stockpiles.   This further o�sets
the likelihood of a squeeze in uranium.

Despite speculation in various commodity markets,
there is simply no evidence for a supply shortage in
uranium…that is, unless you talk with a stock
promoter with lots of shares of a uranium story
stock to move.


Something to ponder- A Thought
from Citron
The case of UEC is troubling for shareholders and
should be more troubling for citizens of Texas for
the following reason.  As we learned a lesson this
year from the recent BP drilling disaster, it is never
a problem until it is a problem. The consultants
and engineers have been compensated with
stock, to pave the way for a US municipality to put
its groundwater at risk.  When potentially serious
environmental consequences arise, the
responsibility will lie in the hands of Canadian
citizens with a serious history of stock promotion.
When doing resource drilling of this nature,
management is at risk of being caught in the
crosshairs of doing the right thing for the
environment vs doing the right thing for insiders. 
When this issue ripens for UEC – which is inevitable
 – will this self-promotional team, with its o�shore
accounts and 40c per share cash in the company,
be accountable ?  How far would BP have gotten
with $24 million to face its environmental
responsibilities ?

Like everything else about this deal, the 3 ½ year
battle for permitting in Goliad has been paid for ….
with stock.


“Bennett admitted he was not present when
the wells were drilled, did not personally
inspect the wells, or participate in any
sampling of the wells. Nor did he perform his
own subsurface examination of the site.
Instead, he said he “assumed” the reports he
relied on from fellow UEC consultant Craig
Holmes were a “professional product.”


Holmes testi�ed on Tuesday was invested in
UEC stock

The Hype Machine
If anything signals a top to this stock, it has to be
this week’s newsletter piece promising “Huge
Returns in Uranium Stocks” which hit the Nasdaq
site.

The article was written by one Ian Wyatt.   While we
don’t doubt Ian’s intentions, we simply would like to
call attention to three other battleground stocks
between Citron and Ian.  Citron Research points out
the following stocks were previously covered by
Citron and promoted by Ian:


YPNT at 4.95 – Stock crashed to pennies, CEO
criminally indicted and convicted. (was at one time
Ian’s favorite recommendation)

Conclusion
This recycled stock promotion is what it always was
– a heavily overhyped story stock that fell into a
commodity bubble — with no real prospects of
“growing into” its valuation.  It is the opinion of
Citron that at the end of the day when you look
past all the well written pr’s you will nothing more
than another hype company in the dossier of Alan
Lindsay.
