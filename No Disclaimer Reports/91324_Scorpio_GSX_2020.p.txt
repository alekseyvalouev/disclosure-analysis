GSX （whom to learn from）, THE LAST TO LEARN FROM 


A RESEARCH REPORT ABOUT GSX 


If you ask who will be the “unluckiest” Chinese stock this year, GSX probably can also be 


on the list, in addition to Luckin Coffee, TAL and iQiyi, which is successively aimed as a new 


target by the short-seller grizzly bear and Citron Research. The boss of GSX Larry Chen 


( Xiangdong Chen ) had to explain it in person. 


Unfortunately, Chen's explanation failed to dispel our doubts in no way. We have 


research to provide the following evidence and questions, and welcome GSX to kick our ass 


to prove it bullshit. All the original evidence has been submitted to the CSRC and the USSC. 


CONCLUSIVE FALSE FINANCIAL DATA 


GSX achieve nearly perfect financial statements through community fission marketing. 


But we found that the financial data behind the work is not up to the test. 


1. PROPERTY PURCHASE IN ZHENGZHOU


In December 2019, a purchase agreement was signed by GSX and Zhengzhou Kaitong 


technology industry and Trade Co., Ltd to acquire commercial real estate owned by 


Zhengzhou Kaitong, including two completed office buildings and one office building under 


construction. Grizzly bear in the report has questioned GSX the property purchase in 


Zhengzhou is suspected of money laundering. In this regard, Larry Chen claimed there is a 


building in the center of the most prosperous area in Zhengzhou, whose area is 65,800 


square meters, the initial price of 330 million. If get in hand, the price will be 5000 yuan a 


square, much cheaper. So there is no money laundering.
2 








Figure 1 





However, by consulting the data, Zhengzhou Kaitong got the land in 2006 at the price 


of 3147,000 yuan as the use of "scientific research."  


Figure 2
3 


First, Larry Chen has been trying to confuse several concepts - scientific, commercial 


and residential. Generally speaking, because of state-sponsored scientific research, the price 


of scientific research land is much lower than residential and commercial land. Using local 


house prices as a reference, it is clearly unconvincing to argue that the deal is cheap.  


Perhaps the time of auction price in 2006 was too far away, and the premium is now 


too high to be convincing enough. Let's fast-forward the time to the end of January 2019. 


By querying the official disclosure information, we found that only one scientific research 


site had been granted in Zhengzhou during the 2018/7-2020/April months, the information 


was as follows: 


Figure 3 





The land bid margin was RMB 361.60 million, with a starting price of RMB 3616.0 


million, an increase of RMB 2 million. No bid was made for the subsequent site. The unit 


price of the plot is only 705 yuan /m2, less than one-seventh of the unit price of GSX take 


the land. Even if the location difference may lead to price differences, the same in 


Zhengzhou City, the time is only less than two months, why is the difference between land 


prices so large?  


GSX retorted in the investor conference call: "The 75 million investment mentioned in 


the Grizzly Bear report, equivalent to about 1000 yuan per square meter of property 


purchase, in Zhengzhou, such as the emerging second-tier provincial capital city to buy 


property, is the lack of the most basic business common sense." I do not know when facing 


the price of 705 yuan / m2 unit whether GSX is about to be angry at Zhengzhou City Public
4 


Resources Trading Center "lack of the most basic business common sense" once again?  


Therefore, we believe that there is a large difference between the fair value of the asset 


as a scientific research site and the price $330.3 million GSX contributed.  


Secondly, this piece of land used for "scientific research", however, was disclosed in the 


basic situation of the construction project that "the project after completion mainly as 


office rental or sold to private enterprises and social groups to use." The scientific 


research land has become a rent-receiving office building. According to the Land 


Management Law of the People's Republic of China, after the construction land has been 


approved in accordance with the law, the land use unit shall not change the original 


approved land use without authorization, and the unauthorized change constitutes an illegal 


modification of the land use. 


Figure 4 





To sum up, behind the GSX " Property Purchase In Zhengzhou" incident, is the huge 


difference between the purchase price and market price, the fundamental difference 


between the auction use and the actual use, and there is a solid major suspicion of transfer 


of assets or money laundering and illegal land use.   





2. EMPLOYEES BUY LESSONS
5 


Through interviews with some of the departed employees, we have learned that after 


being exposed to false transactions, the next day GSX posted an emergency notice to 


employees that they can buy free classes. Everyone has a free amount of up to 5,000 yuan 


(i.e. the employees can buy the courses free of charge, only whose price is at 5,000 yuan or 


less,). We suspect that this is to fill in the exposed balance of the transaction .  


We also learned GSX distribute to all employees with large coupons at a face value of 


¥2,698. According to accounting standards, coupons should be recorded as deferred 


income, if the customer does not use coupons to buy classes at full price, then the above 


coupon according to a certain proportion (the proportion size by GSX to estimate) will be 


included into the income. It is assumed that employees, whether or not they use large 


coupons, are likely to be all included in the income. (Due to the image involving privacy and 


security of the employees, we did the mosaic technology processing of the picture ) 


Figure 5

Figure 6-coupon information 





3. TEACHER'S SALARY 


According to financial reports, 36% of the revenue of 2.1 billion yuan in 2019( 720 


million yuan ) came from the top 10 teachers, and the average platform share of the top 


teachers is estimated to be over the ten-millions level, based on the platform share ratio 


(10%-50%). But after communicating with Zhao Lixian, one of the top ten teachers, we don't 


think his annual salary is up to that level.  


Figure 7
7 





If the teacher did not lie about his income, then the company must have 


lied about revenue. 


4. USE INVESTMENTS TO COVER UP FALSE OPERATING INCOME 


According to the GSX 2019 annual report, the company's short-term investment was 


1.473 billion RMB, equity investment and long-term investment were 1.188 billion RMB, but 


the interest income was only 8.861 million RMB and the yield was only about 0.6%, far lower 


than the usual bank wealth management income. When we look at the company's cash and 


cash equivalents, the amount is less than 74 million RMB. With such absurd figures, we have 


reason to suspect that only one possibility is that the investment amounts recorded in the 


annual report are not true, that GSX has never had such a high income, and that they have 


used the investment to cover up the false income, thus exposing such low yields.   


FALSE BUSINESS DATA 


When many listed online education companies are in a state of loss, the revenue
8 


growth in 2019 is more than 400%, and the net profit growth is more than 10 times, the 


performance is bright. But it is hard to prove its excellence by GSX online business data  


1. SEARCH FOR INDICES 


A search index is a quantitative indicator of brand awareness and potential customer 


focus. We intercept the WeChat and baidu multi-time span online education brand search 


index as of April 15, 2020. No matter which platform, no matter how long the time span, the 


search index of GSX is flat performance. 


The following figures are WeChat 7-day index, WeChat 30-day index and WeChat 90-


day index as of April 15, 2020. The data showed that the WeChat search index of GSX was 


only better than Vipkid, and there was a significant gap between TAL and EDU. 











The following figure is baidu 15-day index of mobile terminal, baidu 30-day index of 


mobile terminal and baidu half-year index of mobile terminal as of April 15, 2020. Data 


show, GSX baidu search index data shows there is still a significant gap between GSX and 


TAL & EDU.
9 





Figure1 1 








Figure 12
10 


Figure 13 





The mediocre performance of the search index, to some extent, reflects the priority of 


potential consumers to choose online education brand, which GSX is obviously not the first 


choice of most people. 


2. DOWNLOADS AND ACTIVITY 


By comparing the Appstore's education rankings, we found out GSX was ranked 101st 


on the Iphone. Gaotu, the focus of GSX's counterattack weapon, ranked only 113th. Its 


competitor Xueersi, which is owned by the recently exploded Good Future, ranked 15th on 


the list. 





Figure 14
11 





On the iPad, Gaotu Class only ranked 86th and GSX only to be 123rd, while Xueersi 


ranked 13th on the list.

Figure 21 








In addition to lagging downloads, the GSX user activity is also embarrassing. 


According to data from Questmobile and the Orient securities research institute, in the first 


two months of 2020, both weekly and Sunday activity of Gaotu were in the middle and 


lower end of the industry. Only better than EDU online, obviously behind TAL, ZuoYeBang 


and YuanFuDao.

Figure 22 








3. RECRUITMENT IS DOWNLOAD, ON-BOARDING IS BUYING CLASS 


At the end of April 2020, we interviewed some of the former employees, and learned 


that the company's branches are carrying out mass recruitment, most of which are fresh 


graduates. In the interview process, whether or not the admission, the first step of the 


requirement is to download the app. 


Employees will get large coupons immediately after entering the company, and the 


coupons are distributed in large amounts and frequently. As of April 30, 2020, false brushing 


performance is expected to account for a significant portion of the GSX group's 12,000 


employees. 


4. USERS AND POSITIVE REVIEWS 


After a series of encounters with short sellers, GSX held two consecutive 


communication meeting, where Larry Chen repeatedly stressed the company's integrity 


management philosophy - never brush, not false. However, according to the existing 


evidence, there is an endless stream of information about GSX brushing orders, brushing 


positive reviews, WeChat group "support"，and buying public relations notices. 


In the iPhone App Store, for example, the ratings and reviews are ranked in the most 


helpful order, and a casual browse reveals a large number of identical, meaningless five-star
15 


reviews from different nicknames. In order to make it easier for investors to compare and 


evaluate the exact same content, we only cut out a small number of comments in the front 


and next to each other. On this scale, the number of identical, unsubstantiated five-star 


ratings across the 37,877 scores is probably hundreds or even thousands of times higher 


than the number given in the screenshot. 


Figure 23-24 


















































Figure 25-28
16 




























































































Figure
17 


29-32
18 


Figure3 3-34 















































When browsing the reviews of the App Store, we also found that a large number of 


users with different identities have the same life! It was a wonder. All are 32 years old, 25 


years old to work, experienced love, break up, entrepreneurship...... This is a very obvious 


batch copy brush praise fraud! Just wanna remind something to the big water army, at the 


end of the last screenshot, did you copy and paste it at the wrong place? How can it be 


ended up differently from others? 


When digging deep along the train of thought of "reviews", we found that the 


authenticity of the course reviews is also surprising. We've collected all the courses from 


GSX and Gaotu Class App. 


Figure 35-40
19
20
21
22 


A total of 218,430 course reviews were randomly extracted from one of the folders, of 


which 173,083 were repeated and 45,357 were unique. In other words, there is a 


phenomenon that the same account is repeatedly written in the course review on a large 


scale, and the repetition rate is as high as 79.24%. 


Figure 41-43
23 











According to the above data, we believe that GXS group may fabricate up to 80% of 


the data. Not only exists there a lot of fake positive reviews in the course, but also a plenty
24 


of fake reviews of brushing orders with the test link in the App. This makes us wonder, is this 


a test link to test the stability of brushing?  





Figure 44-46
25 








There is more original evidence and we have handed it all over to the relevant 


regulatory authorities.
26 


In addition, the existence of "plants" in WeChat learning groups has been exposed by 


Moses English and grizzly bear short reports. The chat records of WeChat learning group 


showed that the two different WeChat groups were surprisingly consistent in their praise of 


the teachers. It took about 10 minutes from the time the tipster started reading the 


comments until he was kicked out of the group. But even in this short 10 minutes, two 


different WeChat groups, WeChat ID different "students", actually issued up to five groups 


of almost identical praise. 


For more evidence please search WeChat Public Article: 


"GSX, it must be so nice for you to brazenly earn student money.” 


"GSX: the way you trick consumers into buying lessons is so disgusting!"  


Here I won't repeat it again. 








POOR COURSE QUALITY 


1. TEACHERS LEVEL 


The level of teachers is the core evaluation standard of educational institutions, and 


GSX is the so-called platform that relies heavily on famous teachers. So how nice is the level 


of its teachers? We decided to start the investigation from two parts: new teachers and 


online celebrity teachers. 


In 2018, the ministry of education clearly stipulated in article 5 of the notice of the 


general office of the ministry of education on earnestly doing a good job in the special 


rectification work of off-campus training institutions: "strictly master the qualifications of 


teachers. According to the guidelines, teachers engaged in knowledge training in Chinese, 


mathematics, English and physics, chemistry and biology should have the corresponding 


teacher qualifications." 


Obviously GSX did not abide by this rule. We entered some of the GSX HR and 


recruitment QQ groups where we obtained the following screenshots.

Figure 48

In order to recruit, HR departments are not afraid to attract job seekers with the 


condition that "no teacher certificate is required before employment". In China, the average 


time to get a certificate is about one year if you do not take the exam after graduation. That 


is to say, it is likely that a considerable number of new hires will have been employed 


without a certificate in the first year. Even no the basic qualifications, they shouldn’t have 


been employed at all! GSX is simply misleading! 


Figure 49
29 





On April 24th, 2020, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the PRC has 


issued a new policy, which allows graduates to obtain the qualification certificate after 


becoming a teacher. But this policy is a special strategy during the epidemic. We believe
30 


that GSX started to recruit unqualified employees much earlier than this policy. We also 


doubt whether the faculty is as qualified and highly educated as GSX claimed. 


In addition to the recruitment of new people's qualifications doubt, GSX the platform of 


some well-known online teachers, also exposed the name is not true, errors, as well as the 


suspicion of plagiarism. 


We interviewed some of the students who bought the GSX course, and have learned 


that one of the means of formal registration for the audition transformation of GSX is to 


promote the learning method of "solving the real exam in 5 seconds" in the cheap 


experience class, which is essentially a formula. But this formula is only applicable to a 


certain type of body type, a little variation can lead to failure, so "5 seconds to solve the real 


exam" is overstating the effectiveness of the formula. Some students used the formula to 


solve a problem, then they would mistakenly think that it really can "5 seconds to solve the 


college entrance examination", so as to sign up for a thousands of formal classes. 


Others who have dropped out said the experience of GSX was like falling into a 


marketing group, with tutors calling students six or seven times a day after each new class, 


calling and phoning them to sign up for classes. 


After the college entrance examination, the class group will be immediately dissolved, 


even no opportunity to discuss the results, which is so suspicious to do so in order to 


prevent students from having negative feedback after the CEE. 


As for the course reviews, the students revealed that they just made up some nonsence 


and bullshit false words there. Before the class is over, the tutor will tell them, "write the 


review about the course later." They were worried about the revenge from the tutor when 


discovered the negtive reviews, so he dared not write anything bad at all, then they would 


often put together some 15 words of praise and submit it immediately.  


Official Account Moses English has analyzed the content of the course "Word Lord of 


All 38000 Vocabulary shorthand" promoted by GSX, and found that its content is full of 


water, shortages and mistakes.  


For example, using a large number of word variations to cobble together 38000 words: 


Figure 50
31 








For example, root source error: 


Figure 51 








More evidence can be found in the article "Seven Sins" with GSX vocabulary courses.  





In January 2020, etymology researcher Dr. Qian Lei published an article on his official 


account saying that Song Weigang, teacher from GSX, had copied the etymology stories 


published by Dr. Qian throughout his course. Then Dr. Qian was prompted by netizens to 


find out that GSX another "famous teacher" ” Han Yu also exists plagiarism behavior. For 


example, Han Yu's explanation of the word "blackmail" in the course, and the interpretation 


of the word "blackmail" in Qian Lei's official book"(2018, Beihang Press), is identical, except 


that Han Yu miscribed one of the "地主" into "地租"（their pronunciation are very close, 


so,it might be a typo event）.

2. COMPLAINT DATA 


The level of teaching, the good or bad after-sales service, students are most aware. We 


looked up the number of complaints from mainstream online education brands on the 


public welfare consumer complaints platform and found it much far ahead at this point for 



https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/110108948

GSX. And a large number of complainants are the most serious complaints asking for a 


refund after paying for the class and finding that the publicized teacher left his job and they 


replaced the platform teacher with someone else.  


It can be seen that the teachers are inferior, the stability is poor, and the after-sales 


service cannot keep up, which delays the students' study and harms the students' rights and 


interests. 


Figure 54

Compared with EDU, TAL, YFD and other online tutoring agencies, the number of 


complaints was far less than GSX.

In addition to frequent student complaints, GSX has recently been dogged by external 


lawsuits. 


YuanFuDao
39 


On April 15, 2020, VIPKID, an online children's education agency, announced on April 


13 that it had filed a lawsuit against Beijing baijia Internet technology co., which operates 


GSX. Beijing's Haidian District court has accepted the lawsuit seeking 8 million yuan in 


damages for "instructing employees to use improper means to steal business secrets such 


as user lists"  


According to the indictment, the two defendants were in VIPKID's sales business, where 


they worked as course consultants and had access to VIPKID's client base. After leaving and 


joining GSX, the two men violated the departure requirements and confidentiality 


obligations of the previous employer, obtained VIPKID's customer list in an illegal way, and 


continued to solicit customers and sell products with VIPKID's "long-term and stable 


customer group" in the name of BJIT. 


Both internal teaching and external marketing of GSX attracted more complaints than 


those of its business partners, which reflects the poor quality of its courses and poor 


marketing.. 


DEVELOPMENT HISTORY WITH BAD CREDIT 


1. PRE-IPO FINANCING 


The development of the company cannot be separated from the support of a large 


amount of capital. Before it went public, GSX had only two rounds of financing, the angel 


round in 2014 and the failed series A and B round in 2015. Among them, the angel round 


was invested by QiFu capital, and the A round was jointly invested by QiFu capital and 


GaoRong capital with 50 million dollars. GSX, which received no peer funding and failed in 


its series B round of financing, rushed to ring the bell at the New York stock exchange on 


June 6, 2019. 


How on earth did GSX make a profit with the $50 million and Chen's personal 


contribution? Is the education industry bullish on GSX's business model? We seriously doubt 


that.
40 


2. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS COLLECTIVELY REDUCE THEIR HOLDINGS AND CASH 


OUT 


Of course the development of the company cannot be separated from the investment 


of shareholders. On November 19, 2019, GSX released its latest f-1 filing to issue 15 million 


American depositary shares (ADS). Unlike the usual follow-on financing, GSX itself will not 


receive any financing this time. Instead, it will be cashing out by reducing the holdings held 


by major shareholders, including the internal employee shareholding platform of the second 


largest shareholder, KaiFu capital the fourth largest shareholder, GaoRong capital the fifth 


largest shareholder, and a shareholder with the same name as co-founder LuoBin. Based on 


the closing price at the time, the total cash could amount to $250 million. 


Only five months after GSX went public, big shareholders were already rushing to 


reduce their holdings and raise cash. This makes people can't help but feel a sweat about 


the development prospects of the company. 





3. CURRENT CFO BACKGROUND 


The development of the company is also inseparable from a reliable executive team.  


Grizzly bear's short report pointed out that Shen Nan, the current CFO of GSX, had worked 


in the "liar company" China Sinoedu Co., Ltd. (新诺教育), which was denied by GSX.  


However, we found that although Shen Nan did not work in Sinoedu, he did work in 


another "tainted" JiNan Shuangsheng Education Consulting Co., Ltd.  


Figure 59 





Shen Nan was in charge of the financial work of JiNan Shuangsheng Education 


Consulting Co., Ltd. from September 2017 to September 2018. The company, the organizer 


of Shandong Talent College of Private University, was acquired by China YuHua Education 


Group Co., Ltd. (港股宇华教育 HK.06169) on July 22, 2019.  


Coincidentally, JiNan Shuangsheng Education Consulting Co., Ltd., the organizer of
41 


Shandong Talent College, applied for the trademark "HuaXia Education SINOEDU" in 2018.  


It can be seen that the grizzly bear's report was not groundless. Shen Nan did work for 


Sinoedu, but this Sinoedu (华夏教育) is not that Sinoedu (新诺教育).  


By collecting online public opinion information, we enumerate and sum up the "three 


deadly sins" of Shandong Talent College:  


1) enrollment mainly depends on fraud and false enrollment. Publicity in the 


name of unified enrollment, the actual admission is self-admission to the 


university. And use "High profitable head fee" to encourage admissions staff 


to recruit by fair means or whatever it takes;  


2) forcing students to participate in enrollment / internships, threatening with 


diplomas and depriving students of internship salaries;  


3) in the enrollment process, large-scale fraudulent personal information of 


college entrance examinees is obtained in the name of investigation, 


harassing candidates repeatedly.  


Having been in charge of financial work within such a notorious "private university" for 


as long as a year, we believe that Shen Nan could not have been unaware of the "crime" of 


Shandong Talent College. During his tenure, in the face of these dishonorable acts of the 


college, he chose not to mention it. Such ethical standards are far from what a public 


company CFO should be  





SUMMARIZE 


To sum up, GSX's financial data are full of doubts, business data fraud is obvious, the 


quality of courses is not as expected, and the development history was bearish repeatedly.                


So, we think GSX is seriously overvalued. 


According to the average PE of 70-80 in the education industry, and the fake data of 


GSX, without considering prosecution and delisting, we believe that: 


The actual value of the stock in the future is estimated to be $4 to $6.
