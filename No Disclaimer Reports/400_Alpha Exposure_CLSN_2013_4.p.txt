Celsion's Bad News: Everyone Gives Up

There's more bad news for Celsion (NASDAQ:CLSN) and we're here to report it. Based
on the Company's continued cash burn in the second quarter, we are revising our price
target down to $0.68 per share, the current net cash balance at the Company. This
represents 42% downside from the current price of $1.17 per share. We expect further
cash burn and for the fair value of the Company to continue to decline. Let's review the
bad news:


1. The "Smart Money" has given up


One of the repeated bull cases for Celsion has been the ownership of its shares by
respected biotech investors, such as Sabby Management and Perceptive Advisors. For
instance, commentator brandond wrote "Sabby, who made an almost $10M investment
recently at around $1.75/share has a good track record and they didn't invest without
having access to lots of information and thinking there is a lot of upside. "Follow the
money" has served me well in the past."


Unfortunately for Celsion's remaining shareholders, the professional biotech hedge funds
have sold every single share that they own. See for yourself. Both the Sabby 13F and the
Perceptive Advisors 13F show zero owned shares. Only a few thousand options remain in
the case of Sabby, including put options that would benefit from further declines in the
price of Celsion's stock. In contrast, these two investors owned a combined 2,222,270
shares at the end of the prior quarter as can be seen here and here that were worth a
combined $2,336,000.


The smart money has sold.


2. The Company has given up on approval based on the HEAT trial


One of the great hopes of Celsion's shareholders was that the post-hoc analysis of the
Thermodox trial would enable it to file for approval, if not in the United States then
elsewhere, such as China. This hope now appears to be dead following the statement in
the last earnings release that "We believe that the emerging data from our post hoc
analysis of the HEAT Study may provide a rationale for continued development of
ThermoDox® and a basis for discussion of a path forward for our HCC program with
various regulatory agencies." On the last conference call, the CEO further elaborated that

"our expectation would be in the first quarter of 2014 to begin enrolment of the
confirmatory trial in HCC." Just in case anyone is confused, confirmatory trial means that
the Company would need to run a whole new Phase 3 trial. Shareholders will have six or
seven more years of waiting and many many additional rounds of dilutive financing. This is
in contrast to many of the Company's supporters, such as the Griffin analyst, who believe
that some sort of mythical accelerated pathway exists to reach approval based on the
existing data.


3. The statisticians have given up on the original data mining


In the Company's initial press release detailing its data mining, it stated that "Emerging
data from the HEAT Study post analysis demonstrates that ThermoDox® markedly
improves progression free survival (NYSE:PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who
had optimal RFA. The analysis indicates that if patients' lesions undergo RFA for 45
minutes or more, they clearly benefited from ThermoDox®. These findings apply to HCC
lesions from both size cohorts of the HEAT Study (3-5 cm and 5-7 cm) and represent a
sizable subgroup of patients." Unfortunately for Celsion's investors, the data seems to be
getting worse and not better. Specifically, in the most recent conference call, the Company
stated "Those patients with relatively small lesions did better when given ThermoDox, as
compared to the control group." Later in the call, the Company also stated that "When we
looked at all patients with a single lesion we saw that longer RFA procedures correlate
very well with improved outcomes in all tumor sizes. This was particularly enhanced in the
ThermoDox group." Unfortunately, this is a further narrowing of the subgroup that
supposedly benefits from Thermodox - whereas previously everyone who got a long
enough RFA treatment benefited from Thermodox, now only the people who either had
smaller lesions or single lesions benefited. This subgroup narrowing should be a warning
signal, because it most likely results from the Company realizing that the previously
defined subgroup was not showing enough of a benefit. As you know based on our prior
article about data mining, the more that a trial's data is sliced and diced, the more
opportunities a Company has to find a random positive data point. In other words,
companies narrow subgroups in order to take otherwise unimpressive data and put a
positive spin on it.


Conclusion


It's been another quarter of consistently bad news for Celsion. The Company's major
healthcare investors sold every share they own. The Company confirmed it needed an
entirely new Phase 3. The data mining got more extreme and the Company still can't find
