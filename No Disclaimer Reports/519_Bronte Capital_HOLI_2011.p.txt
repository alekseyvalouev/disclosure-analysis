Hollysys - a blog post inspired by the railway crash
 
 
Disclosure for people who do not get my sense of humor: We are short Hollysys.  
If you get to the end of the post and do not understand why read the note on the blog as to
humor - or just read this. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
Hollysys is a Chinese rail technology company listed in the USA (NASDAQ:HOLI).
 
The stock is having a rough trading day today. As I write the stock is down about 20 percent. My first
reaction was the Chinese rail crash but Hollysys has denied its signalling is involved.
 
That is a relief because Hollysys is an amazing company. And because it did not cause the railway
accident it should be able to sweep the board of its inferior competition.
 
How to approach Hollysys
 
I approach Hollysys like I approach many amazing Chinese companies - businesses with amazing
technology, amazing growth and amazing margins.
 
Some of the amazing claims made have turned out to be false - but some are yet to be falsified and
some of those might actually be true. After all 1.3 billion people should be able to some amazing
things.
 
Hollysys however is possibly the most amazing company I have seen yet.
 
As this blog is a fan of Fox News I wish to be fair-and-balanced. I report. You can decide.
 
What Hollysys does?
 
Hollysys makes control systems. It started in the railways industry and specializes in very fast trains.
Here is a description from their website:
 


HollySys Automation Technologies is a leading provider of automation and control
technologies and applications in China that enables its diversified industry and utility
customers to improve operating safety, reliability, and efficiency. Founded in 1993,
HollySys has approximately 2,400 employees with 9 sales centers and 13 service

including Distributed Control System (DCS) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC),
high-speed railway Train Control Center (TCC) and Automatic Train Protection (ATP),

China's subway automation market, and is the only certified domestic automation
control systems provider to the nuclear industry in China. HollySys is also one of only

Railways in the 200km to 250km high-speed rail segment, and is one of only two
automation control systems and products providers approved in the 300km to 350km
high-speed rail segment.

HollySys offers a wide range of automation and control products from PLCs to DCS to
help you find the solution for any automation and process control application. Through
our sustainable business and continuous development in the area of automation, we

technology for better work, life, and environment. We are now the global supplier of
choice for innovative technology backed by the highest level of service and support.
When you need products and solutions you can rely on, choose HollySys.


 
 
Their website then goes through various businesses that they run and describes their achievements.
The achievements are on par with global players in the control-automation business such as
Siemens. For instance on nuclear power this is what they say:
 


Since 1995, HollySys starts providing solutions for the nuclear power plant automation
in China and since then, we have been continuously providing digital I&C system for the
nuclear power plant. Through hardship of innovation and development, HollySys has
now self-developed products and solution for the nuclear power plant control system.
With more than 10 years of experience and over 40 successful NPP projects, HollySys
has both the ability to become very competitive product suppliers and service providers.


In 1997, HollySys developed China’s first computer control system for the nuclear
power plant. The system was exported to Pakistan Chashma 300MW NPP and
has been successfully operating ever since.


In 1998, Qingshan Phase II NPP adopted HollySys DCS system. It is equip with
centralized supervision and safety control of the nuclear power plant with system
of conventional island design.


In 2004, HollySys was the first to enter the field of nuclear safety testing and
successfully implemented the project of digital safety testing devices.


In 2005, HollySys became the localized sub-contractor of Ling’Ao Nuclear Power
Plant phase II, and undertaking the project implementation for digital I&C system.


In 2007, HollySys has successfully developed its first generation totally digital I&C
system, the HOLLiAS NMS system.


By far, HollySys has 44 signed and completed contracts within our nuclear power
business unit covering almost all of the China’s Nuclear Power Plant either in
construction or in operation. These have put us in the top league in competition among
other competitors in China. This vast achievement wins recognition from our customers,
at the same time, have proven the reliability and safety of our solution, and the
professionalism in our engineering services that we provided.


 
 
They make similarly large claims about their business in other sectors such as control systems for
subway automation or factory automation.
 
One long investor I know visited the plants and was shown a very impressive company. There
headquarters photographed on the website - is very impressive.

But as regular readers of this blog know I am a balance sheet kind of guy. When I see such amazing

businesses.

We learn that the 65.3 million in net PP&E is $76.6 million gross PP&E - the difference being
accumulated depreciation. Of that 76.6 million most is buildings and land use rights. There 13.6
million in buildings, 7.3 in land use rights and another 39.3 million under construction.
 
Only $3.1 million of machinery is in use. That is kind of funny because this company is a manufacturer
of some pretty high end kit. Indeed it is pretty hard to imagine how you manufacture the control
systems (sensors etc and the computers to go with it) with only $3.1 million in kit - but the company
seems to do so. Those machines should also include all the computers on which staff make the
software to run all this fancy kit. The company has $3000 of kit - so there is less than a laptop per
staff member in machines - and surely all of this manufacturing requires some machines.
 
Whatever: this is a miracle of machine efficiency - as amazing as any other Chinese company I have
written on.
 
The rest of the balance sheet is perverse. The company had revenue in 2009 and 2010 of $157.5
million and $174.1 million respectively. Costs estimated in excess of billings are over $60 million. In
other words they have done a third of year's work and not been paid. Net income last year was $27
million. Over the past three years net income is about $20 million. The company has many years
income in work which it has done but has not yet got around to billion.
 
That is perverse. You work and work and work and it is not cash - it is just unbilled receivables. They
better be sure they can bill somebody and that they will collect it in cash.
 
If you look at the last quarterly the costs estimated in excess of billings have ballooned to $86 million.
They continue working. They do not collect in cash.
 
Another 10 million - or half the profits for the last three years - is advanced to suppliers. That number
is rising too.
 
There is 23 million of inventories too. I guess that makes sense - they are a manufacturer - but there
are next to no machines to work on these inventories with...
 
Admittedly their liabilities are also larger than would appear normal - there is for instance 33 million in
deferred revenue. That is also large relative to profit. I guess working capital management is just
different in China...
 
Revenue in the last nine months is skyrocketing. Its up over 60 percent. Property plant and equipment
however is almost unchanged. This company is one of the most advanced manufacturers in the world
- and as far as I can see it does this almost without machines.
 
Reasons to be long this company
 
About six months ago I was talking to a (former) long in this company and he told me that I should be
wary shorting it. It was very close to the Railway department and the Railway Minister. (My friend just
assumed I would be short - but truly I am looking for companies to go long...)
 
Hollysys he said had lots of Guanxi - and that Guanxi might help them make money. He thought it
even possible that they had obtained machinery and know how from the Railway Department without
having to pay for it.
 
He really did think that there was a relationship with the Railways Minister that would play well for the
company. And not being that familiar with the innards of the Chinese Politburo I was not one to
quibble.
 
The stock however got weaker when the Railway Minister was arrested for corruption.
 
R&D
 
This company has done about 25 million cumulative R&D in the past three years. This is a lot by
Chinese standards but it is tiny by the standards of Siemens. Given the enormous advances that this
company has (claimed to have) made in fast train and nuclear power control systems I am getting
worried about nuclear reactors controlled on the cheap. Still I report: you decide.

Audit
 
This company is a June balance date. The auditor is BDO Hong Kong. This is an auditor stung a little
by scandal lately but then so has every auditor in China.
 
This one is amazing. Utterly amazing. It might trip up on audit (which is not far away). But this might
actually be the real deal - the company with world-class technology on a modest cumulative R&D
budget. The company with world class manufacturing where the manufacturing requires next to no
machines. The company that does work greater than its accumulated profit and neither expenses nor
bills that work. The company that breaks all the rules and still succeeds.
 
The company that proves that this time it is different in China.
 
And imagine - because they did not cause the railway accident they are going to be getting a lot more
work.
