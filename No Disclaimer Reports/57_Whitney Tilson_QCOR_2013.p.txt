Whitney Tilson on  Questcor


I hadn’t gotten around to writing about one of my newest short positions, Questcor Pharmaceuticals


Inc (NASDAQ:QCOR), so I owe a debt of gratitude to this article in tomorrow’s NY Times, which does a


nice job of laying out key parts of what I believe is a scam of epic proportions (I’ve also included theepic


recent Barron’s and Seeking Alpha articles that the NYT article links to).


You really can’t make this one up. Just over six years ago in Aug. 2007, this stock was at $0.35 – so how


did it increase 158x to today’s closing price of $55.18, giving this former penny stock a $3.3 billion


market cap? Easy: just increase the price of its one product (H.P. Acthar Gel, a 60+ year old drug


acquired for $100,000) from $40 to more than $28,000 a vial (that’s not a typo – a 700x increase!).


Believe it or not, our insane healthcare system allows this, as insurers are paying it – which, of course,


means that all of us are.


Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:QCOR) has done all sorts of questionable things to juice


Acthar sales so various investigators are circling and medical professionals are asking tough


questions, so the smart money is betting that this is a house of cards about to collapse (38%


of the �oat is short). But in the meantime, many investors, cheered on by Wall St. “analysts”,


are drawn to the company’s rapid growth, sky-high 40% after-tax margins, and modest


valuation (12.7x trailing EPS and 7.2x EV/EBITDA).

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson Announces New Short Position In Questcor


https://www.valuewalk.com/2013/12/whitney-tilson-questcor-short/ 2/7


 


The bulls have been winning this battle so far – see the three articles below in Barron’s and


StreetSweeper and the Citron report from 2011 and 2012, when the stock was much lower – but I think


the gig is just about up.


PS—Sometimes it’s better to be lucky than good. Had I learned of this company a couple of years ago


and read the articles below and attached, I probably would have shorted it. But instead I came late to


the party – so was able to short it last month (my average cost is over $60), which probably makes me


one of the few people who’s ever shorted this stock who’s in the money!
