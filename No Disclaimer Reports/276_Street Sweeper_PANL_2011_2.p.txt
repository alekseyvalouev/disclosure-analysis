Universal Display: A Real Work Of (Prior) Art?

By Melissa Davis


* Author's Note: The StreetSweeper published its original investigative report on Universal
Display (NASDAQ:PANL) in October, when it took a close look at key changes in the
company's long-term relationship with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) -- its largest source of
commercial revenue by far -- and the flurry of insider sales that surrounded that important
top-secret deal. Click here to access that earlier article.


When Universal Display Corporation originally patented the core technology that now
ranks as its primary asset, historical records clearly suggest, the company simply
combined two existing inventions and then celebrated the resulting “breakthrough” as its
own.


For its part, UDC has long proclaimed that its research partners at Princeton University
first discovered modern organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology in the late 1990s
and then went on to develop the actual OLED materials that now illuminate the display
screens of some popular handheld devices found on the market today. In fact, however,
outside researchers actually reported similar achievements years before UDC ever arrived
on the scene. Armed with evidence of that “prior art,” UDC rivals now hope to severely
weaken – if not completely destroy – the broad OLED patents secured by the company.


From the start, UDC has basically relied on two early patents to serve as the foundation
for its entire portfolio. The first established the design of its fundamental technology,
known as the “OLED stack,” while the second covered the special “emitter” compounds –
since limited to iridium by patent authorities overseas – that generate the light in OLED-
powered screens. By the time that UDC received (or even requested) those far-reaching
patents, however, others had already documented similar breakthroughs in the field.


UDC did not respond to questions for this story.


Phillips Electronics (NYSE:PHG) actually patented a multilevel OLED stack back in the
mid-1990s, records show, some two years before UDC followed up by presenting that
same type of design. Moreover, when Phillips described the core elements of its invention

in 1995, the company used the same kind of language – at times almost identical in nature
– that UDC would later include in a related patent issued to the company six years down
the road.


Phillips is now challenging a European version of that UDC patent overseas, records
show, using its own patent (along with the early research of others) to portray its smaller
rival as a glorified copycat. In a nutshell, Phillips argues, UDC secured an unfair patent –
based upon technology that “is not new” and “does not involve an inventive step” – that
the company arguably should have never received at all.


Similarly, records indicate, UDC followed in the footsteps of others when formulating the
“unique” OLED emitter materials – specifically those derived from iridium --covered in its
second major patent as well. Long before UDC showcased this development, records
show, outsiders had already traveled down that same path by establishing the power of
iridium to generate light. Researchers at the University of Southern California-Santa
Barbara first highlighted this breakthrough two full decades ago, in fact, with a separate
group of scientists further advancing that discovery – using iridium to create light at room
temperature this time – that same year.


Notably, experts say, the second study (found in a 1991 edition of Organic Chemistry)
includes two key graphics – a chart and a drawing – that clearly expose that early iridium-
based compound as the same one that UDC would later present to patent authorities as
its very own.


Regardless, UDC has always portrayed itself as a rare trailblazer that – because of its
long-ago achievements – gained exclusive control over both the technology and the
special light-emitting materials used to power OLED-enabled display screens today. More
recently, in an effort to further bolster its argument, UDC has begun pointing to a renewed
contract with Samsung (the true powerhouse of the OLED industry) as clear validation of
its fundamental patents. Yet other companies have paid hefty fees for patents that proved
worthless on down the road, history shows, with Research in Motion (RIMM) – the maker
of popular BlackBerry devices -- forking over $600 million for allegedly infringing on
patents that later failed to hold up in court.


Meanwhile, as we detailed in a big investigative report two months ago, Samsung has
already stopped paying UDC royalties in exchange for use of its technology. Under a new
long-term agreement inked by the two parties this summer, Samsung simply offered UDC

https://seekingalpha.com/article/313753-universal-display-a-real-work-of-prior-art 3/15


a flat licensing fee – sweetened with the promise of future orders for its OLED chemicals –
instead. By changing key aspects of that important deal, some believe, Samsung
expressed only a lukewarm commitment to UDC and the technology that it holds.


“Samsung’s decision to sign on means that, at present, it was easier to use PANL’s
materials than litigate by itself or by proxy,” Oppenheimer speculated last month,
“especially given that it has had a relationship with the company and used the chemicals
since 2005. (So) it has had access to these chemicals” already.


Adopting a more critical tone than some other notable names on Wall Street,
Oppenheimer describes UDC as a “very tight-lipped company” with a “tendency to portray
itself as (the) only game in town” despite the “constant patent fights” that it keeps facing.
Clearly distancing itself from the enthusiastic bull camp, Oppenheimer remains on the
sidelines with the equivalent of a hold recommendation on the stock and (at last check) no
projected price target on the volatile shares at all.


UDC has won over plenty of loyal fans at this point, however, with even Goldman Sachs
joining the pack after managing a lucrative secondary offering for the company earlier this
year. Since resuming its bullish coverage of UDC last month, Goldman Sachs has
repeatedly urged investors to buy the stock – currently below the $40 mark -- ahead of a
projected run toward $70 a share.


But Peter Cohan, a Massachusetts-based investment strategist who doubles as an
advisor to technology firms, suspects that both UDC and Goldman have misled investors
about the future potential of the company. He, for one, assigns little value to the OLED
patents trumpeted by UDC and its followers – predicting that, if challenged in court, those
patents would fail to survive – and portrays the company as a master of “smoke screens”
instead.


“It’s interesting that Goldman is touting this stock,” says Cohan, who holds no financial
position in UDC himself. “It’s just another example of Goldman assuming that investors
are incredibly stupid. They did the same thing with subprime mortgages, when they
convinced investors to go long on a big pile of garbage …


“This is how Goldman makes money,” he insists. “They prey on the ignorance of
investors.”


For now, at least, UDC boasts a generous market capitalization of $1.76 billion – an
astounding 34 times its prior-year sales – based entirely upon the perceived value of the
OLED patents secured by the company. UDC facesmultiple challenges to those patents,

however, which could pose real threats to the company and its future success.


Colorful Spin


A few years ago, with UDC banking on monopoly-like control over the OLED market, rival
Merck (NYSE:MRK) bluntly dismissed that possibility.


Like UDC itself, records indicate, Merck had by then invested sizable resources in the
development of OLED materials that promised to revolutionize the entire display industry.
While Merck had successfully cornered a huge chunk of the market for chemicals used in
traditional liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, however, the company saw little chance
that any player would ever achieve similar power in the developing OLED space.


“It will not be one dominating supplier in OLED,” Merck assured Reuters at the time. “Not
a single supplier will have such a strong position as we have in liquid crystals. There will
be different companies with different materials, and we will be one of them.”


To help ensure that competition, records indicate, Merck took direct aim at UDC by
challenging the broad OLED patent protection long trumpeted by the smaller company.
With the help of giant BASF and Sumation (a joint venture between Sumitomo and
Cambridge Display Technology), records indicate, Merck recently weakened a key OLED
patent secured by UDC overseas. By presenting evidence of similar technology that
surfaced decades ago,records show, that trio managed to invalidate most of the claims
included in a European version of the “universal” OLED patents that UDC counts as its
most valuable assets of all.


Notably, legal experts have indicated in the past, foreign rulings can influence future
reviews of related U.S. patents on down the road.


“When considering the value of a patent, it is also important to consider what has
happened to foreign counterpart patents and applications in the various patent offices
around the world,” a pair of patent attorneys wrote in the New York Law Journal a few
years ago.


Although the findings of these proceedings are not binding under U.S. law, as a
matter of practicality, an adverse determination in a foreign tribunal may diminish the
value of a U.S. patent because of the risk that a U.S. court or the USPTO (United
States Patent & Trade Office) will analyze the subject matter in the same way that
the foreign tribunal did.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/313753-universal-display-a-real-work-of-prior-art 5/15


Nevertheless, UDC has boldly presented the recent decision in Europe as an outright
victory for the company. Although the European Patent Office struck down 18 of the 30
claims originally included in that fundamental patent, records indicate, UDC has chosen to
focus on the dozen claims that remain intact – specifically those covering iridium materials
found in commercial devices today – while curiously proclaiming that the rest somehow
fall “outside the OLED world.”


While UDC retained some control over phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) materials
derived from iridium, however, other companies have apparently developed similar
chemicals of their own. When Oppenheimer performed a “cursory” search of available
databases, in fact, the firm located more than 900 patents and patent applications for
iridium-based OLED materials here in the U.S. alone. M-CAM, a Virginia-based firm that
focuses on technology companies and their respective inventions, also found hundreds of
related patents in a more meticulous review of its own.


For its part, UDC has tried to downplay the recent decision in Europe – along with similar
cases pending in key markets of Asia -- by emphasizing that the company faces no similar
challenges to its treasured OLED patents here at home. Last month, for example, CFO
Sidney Rosenblatt portrayed the setback in Europe as a mere nuisance (at worst) that
posed no risk of spreading to this side of the globe.


Since then, however, M-CAM Chairman David Martin has blasted UDC in general – and
its CFO in particular – for allegedly tricking investors with “fanciful” spin.


“Sidney is lying in this wonderfully calculating way,” Martin told TheStreetSweeper earlier
this month. “He is misleading the public. And the last time I checked, that’s a (securities)
violation.”


UDC cannot face any opposition proceedings in its home country, Martin declared,
because the U.S. system (which differs from those in both Europe and Asia) does not
allow it. However, Martin said, UDC has already seen a new U.S. patent effectively
derailed – and could hit similar roadblocks in the future -- as a direct result of the ruling
that invalidated the bulk of its claims in a key patent that it held overseas.


The week after that setback, Martin explained, UDC suddenly cancelled 90 claims –
resembling the same broad claims struck down in Europe – contained in a patent
application filed right here at home. After that, he said, UDC replaced those claims with a
much narrower set – focused specifically on iridium – which the USPTO then promptly
rejected (for so-called “double-patenting”) on its own.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/313753-universal-display-a-real-work-of-prior-art 6/15


Going forward, Martin cautioned, UDC could also encounter threats to the U.S. patents
that the company already holds. By pursuing a formal “re-examination” under the USPTO
process (a challenge that the current system allows), he predicted, a third party could
expose clear flaws in the U.S. patents secured by UDC and effectively “blow this company
to bits.”


If history serves as any guide, UDC should fear this type of review. In 2009, The Record
newspaper observed, the USPTO completely nullified 41% of the patents that it re-
examined through the so-called “inter-parties” process and – with only 8% of those
patents left unchanged -- clearly weakened most of the rest.


Even if UDC manages to avoid that particular threat, Martin indicated, the company still
faces other big challenges ahead. Specifically, he predicted, UDC could soon find itself
competing against rivals that obtained similar OLED patents – which also cover iridium-
based materials – and then waited on the sidelines for a real market to build. With demand
for OLED materials finally starting to mount, he said, those competitors will now look to
make a big splash on the field.


“You let the market develop, and that’s when you drop the bomb,” Martin explained. “You
don’t go after anyone until there’s an economic argument to do so … We are probably a
quarter (three months) away from that right now.”


Faded Glory


UDC has long relied on Samsung, a Korean powerhouse that ranks as the only major
adopter of OLED technology to date, as its primary customer and its largest source of
commercial revenue by far. While UDC regularly touts the growing popularity of OLED-
enabled cell phones marketed by Samsung, however, the company recently startled the
market with a weak outlook for its upcoming sales.


Despite soaring demand for Samsung cell phones that utilize OLED technology – and that
promise to become hot Christmas presents this year – UDC has warned of a sequential
decline in its own revenue during the busy holiday season. For its part, UDC blamed the
expected downturn on a “seasonal” dip in fourth-quarter orders that the company “always”
encounters as a matter of routine. Just last year, however, UDC reported the exact
opposite trend instead.


“Commercial and development revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010 were up both
sequentially and year-over-year, as our PHOLED technology gains increased market
adoption,” Rosenblatt boasted at the time. “The sequential growth of our commercial

chemical sales in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by our penetration of the
handheld device market …


“We are very pleased to see products in the market,” he concluded, “with displays
powered by our technology and materials proving to be a commercial success.”


Samsung has since gone on to flood the market with millions of Galaxy cell phones
featuring OLED technology, records indicate, toppling mighty Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as
the industry leader along the way. Even so, last quarter, UDC posted a remarkably modest
uptick in commercials sales of its patented OLED materials. With revenue generated from
patented chemicals sold to commercial customers inching up just $600,000 in the third
quarter, records show, UDC relied on so-called “host” chemicals – commodity materials
sold by other suppliers as well – for much of its blockbuster growth instead.


By suddenly expanding into this commodity business, records indicate, UDC managed to
dramatically boost its third-quarter revenue – with host materials accounting for roughly
one-third of its $21.8 million in overall sales – and blow past Wall Street estimates in the
process. But even UDC management, often wildly optimistic by nature, seemed reluctant
to count on that competitive business as a lasting vehicle for future growth.


After all, an otherwise bullish report on UDC indicates, the company sells even those
lower-margin commodity materials at premium prices – charging three times more than
Korean suppliers – that can be easily undercut by foreign rivals.


“It is a business that is new for us, and the question is going to be whether it is
sustainable,” Rosenblatt confessedat a UBS conference last month, when the stock –
previously flying high on record third-quarter results – began to lose some of its steam and
spiral back toward earth. “We believe it will be. But because it is a new business for us, it
is one that we really are going to be a little cautious about how much we think it will grow.”


Either way, records indicate, that detour – especially when coupled with a revised
Samsung agreement – has effectively reshaped the company. Under its original business
model, records suggest, UDC expected to achieve sky-high margins (well above 90%) by
simply pocketing fat royalty payments and generous licensing fees from the companies
that utilize its technology. When UDC inked a new long-term agreement with Samsung
earlier this year, however, the company stopped receiving royalties from its largest
customer and started counting on big orders of its patented materials (sold at an 85%
margin) to drive its profitability instead. Faced with a meager rise in sales of its patented

5/23/2018 Universal Display: A Real Work Of (Prior) Art? - Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/313753-universal-display-a-real-work-of-prior-art 8/15


chemicals last quarter, records indicate, UDC then further adapted its business strategy by
expanding into the crowded market for host materials that carry even lower margins
(estimated at 60%) still.


When Goldman Sachs resumed its upbeat coverage of UDC last month, however, the firm
somehow overlooked those negative trends. Although UDC relied heavily on sales of host
materials to drive its third-quarter growth – and warned about competitive threats to this
business going forward – Goldman boldly predicted that the company would post a steep
rise in chemical revenues (of 60% annually) over the course of the next several years,
anyway. Moreover, while UDC accepted a hit to its margins when it began peddling
commodity materials, Goldman continued to forecast hefty margins (of 80% to 85%) for
the company as well.


Based upon those lofty expectations, Goldman established a Street-high target price for
UDC -- well above the $50 mean -- of $68 a share.


Meanwhile, UDC has dropped additional hints about potential deterioration in its core
business. Last month, for example, the CFO reported that UDC could soon begin
shopping for additional OLED technology to bolster its current portfolio.


Until now, records indicate, UDC has banked primarily on OLED technology developed by
its own research partners at Princeton and the University of Southern California to
guarantee its future success. While UDC estimates that it has spent more than $60 million
on research and development over the past several years, however, the company has
committed just one-fourth of that total to the university-based studies that actually led to
the patents covering its OLED technology. At the same time, industry news coverage
reveals, some deep-pocketed UDC rivals – including Merck, BASF and Sumitomo – have
shelled out mountains of cash in an effort to secure leadership positions in the promising
OLED field.


As a marginally profitable company (with a history of losses that stretches back a decade
or more), records show, UDC has long relied on the proceeds of stock sales to fund its
operations. After raising $250 million in a big secondary offering managed by Goldman
Sachs this spring – with investors buying UDC stock based on faith in its current
technology – the company now looks eager to splurge on some new assets that will
supplement those that it already owns.


“We will use that money to acquire intellectual property either in the OLED space that
we’re specifically working on -- the emissive materials -- or in other areas in the OLED
stack, if we think it makes some sense,” Rosenblatt told investors at the UBS presentation

5/23/2018 Universal Display: A Real Work Of (Prior) Art? - Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/313753-universal-display-a-real-work-of-prior-art 9/15


last month. “So we’re actively looking right now to see if there is IP that we can acquire.”


By expanding beyond its original strategy (first through the sale of commodity materials
and next through the hunt for IP developed by others), some feel, UDC has at least hinted
at serious threats to its core OLED business. Byreporting weak demand for its patented
OLED chemicals in the third quarter (and warning of an inexplicable slowdown in the
fourth), they further suggest, UDC has in fact effectively signaled that the company
already faces some of those headwinds right now.


‘Empty Shell’


Indeed, last month, UDC basically conceded that rivals in China – a country with a
notorious disregard for patent restrictions – could slice into its market share.


According to the Alliance for Economic Stability, Chinese suppliers have rushed to
capitalize on this opportunity already by peddling cheap OLED materials of their own. For
example, the AES claims, Jilin Optical – whichpublished research that served as evidence
of prior art in the European patent trial – currently sells PHOLED chemicals at one-third of
the price charged by UDC itself.


UDC actually faces numerous challenges in Asia, records indicate, a crucial market that
provides the company with more than 90% of its total revenue. UDC weathered a string of
damaging legal setbacks there earlier this year, theKorea Times reported, when the
Japanese Patent Office invalidated “all three critical PHOLED material patents” secured by
the company in that country. Since then, the newspaper added, UDC has seen two similar
patents in Korea – home to Samsung and, as such, the most important OLED market of
all – come under attack as well.


Like other players in the young OLED space, records indicate, UDC relies on Samsung for
most of its business and obviously treasures that vital relationship. But Samsung has
forged similar deals with other companies as well, a new comprehensive “white paper” on
the developing industry shows, and has regularly indicated that – whenever possible – it
prefers to conduct business with OLED suppliers located in its home country instead.


Take Duksan Hi-Metal, for example. That Korean company already serves as the sole
vendor of at least two active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) materials used by Samsung,
records indicate, and soon hopes to add PHOLED materials to the mix by challenging a
pair of broad UDC patents that block the company from selling those chemicals right now.

5/23/2018 Universal Display: A Real Work Of (Prior) Art? - Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) | Seeking Alpha

“Some studies show that phosphorescent materials were being widely used even before
the technology was patented” by UDC, Duksan Hi-Metal told The Wall Street Journal back
in June. “And as the technology isn’t something new, their patent ownership should be
invalidated.”


If UDC ever loses control of those patents, critics warn, the company will likely lose most
of its $1.76 billion market value as well.


“It is our opinion that, unless UDC is able to string together a series of legal victories, there
will be no material royalty revenue opportunity for the company,” cautioned Liam Mulcahy,
a professional trader whose hedge fund held a short position in UDC at the time that he
issued a bearish report on the company earlier this year. “Additionally, many of UDC’s
original core patents are approaching their expiration dates, including UDC’s ‘key
PHOLED technology patent,’ which expires in 2017 …


“While management of UDC is quick to point out that they have numerous other patents
and that the patents in the U.S. have not been impacted (by setbacks overseas), this
defense misses the point entirely,” Mulcahy continued. “The Street’s valuation of UDC is
predicated on one thing: assumed control of the OLED industry through IP protection.”


Without that power, Mulcahy warned, UDC will likely find itself competing against “dozens”
of other chemical suppliers in a crowded market for commodity materials instead. Under
that scenario, he predicted, UDC would see its premium valuation disappear to render a
stock price – currently near $40 even after a big fall -- of no more than $10 a share.


As the founding chairman of a firm that closely monitors patent developments, uncovering
bright red flags at UDC in the process, Martin foresees the potential for an even steeper
decline. In a nutshell, Martin views UDC as a vulnerable company – sitting on flimsy
patents covering technology developed by others – that could one day sink into penny-
stock territory as a result.


“This whole thing is a really unfortunate situation, where shareholders are being duped,”
Martin proclaimed. “The company doesn’t have what it says that it has.


“Then you’ve got analyst coverage that’s just beating the drum to say that there’s real
value there. Any time that happens, you have this helium effect on something that’s
basically an empty shell. So it floats for a while …


“The weirdest thing about this whole thing is that it’s all hidden in plain sight. It’s a racket,”
he concluded. “And it’s as big of a mess as these things come.”
