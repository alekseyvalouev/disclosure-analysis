Suntech Shareholders Face Imminent Doom

Suntech Power Holdings (NYSE:STP) is in a downward spiral that will likely end in the
shares being very nearly worthless. Ever since the initial reports of the EUR 550mm+ GSF
fraud, the hits have just kept coming. Here are some of the reasons why we believe
Suntech equity is on the fast track to zero:


1. Rampant fraud at the company
2. The Chinese have control of Suntech's major asset
3. No cash to be found
4. Vulture investors in Suntech's bonds will leave nothing for Suntech shareholders
5. We've seen this type of situation unfold before … and it gets ugly


Rampant fraud


In July 2012, Suntech announced that "the Company may have been a victim of fraud"
related to its GSF investment in an amount of nearly $700mm due to German government
bonds that had either vanished into thin air or been forged to begin with. Multiple sources
have indicated that Suntech management should have known better than to make the
GSF investment in the first place because "[the projects] were too large to be viable and
carried the added risk of possible encounters with criminals". Some of the other reasons
are discussed in two lawsuits where Suntech and its management team are being sued
for "misconduct".


In Ji v. Suntech Power Holdings et al. (CA 12-cv-6409), the plaintiff alleges that former
CEO Zhengrong Shi:


"Arranged to have much of the wealth Suntech raised to be transferred out to
other companies Shi owned and controlled. Shi caused Suntech to pay above-
market rates, extend no-interest loans, and make commercially unreasonable
prepayments, to suppliers. He also arranged to have employees on Suntech's
payroll work for his other companies."


Separately, in Bruce v. Suntech Power Holdings et al. (CA 12-cv-04061), the plaintiff
alleges a laundry list of fraudulent behavior outlined here:

"… in June 2010 when Euromoney Institutional Investor published an article in which
Romero admitted to misrepresenting his connection to Suntech [as President of Suntech
Spain]". Suntech invested in a joint venture in which their partner admitted to publicly lying
about his relationship with Suntech!


The Chinese are in control


On 3/21/2013, Wuxi Suntech, the company's main operating subsidiary, was forced into
bankruptcy by a consortium of eight Chinese banks. The Financial Times reports that the
operating subsidiary has "almost $2bn of debt" and "assets may be less than a quarter
that amount". According to a source close to the Chinese restructuring, in Shunfeng's
latest bid for Suntech's Wuxi unit, "creditors, including banks and suppliers, will need to
suffer deep losses for Shunfeng to move ahead with its acquisition." Given the staggering
haircuts that local Chinese banks face on their loans, it stands to reason that U.S.
creditors and shareholders will not see any value from this subsidiary that accounts for the
majority of Suntech's manufacturing capacity.


No cash to be found

Three Suntech directors resigned in August of this year, citing "severe cash flow drain",
"lack of clear business plan", "loss of critical talent" and "failure to pay outside legal
counsel" as some of the key concerns leading to their resignation. These statements from
insiders suggest that there is nothing left at Suntech, not even enough money to pay their
lawyers. This is further confirmed by Trondheim's inability to collect on debts owed by
Suntech despite securing a court-sanctioned judgment and sending a dozen subpoenas to
banks in the U.S. looking for Suntech's accounts. The WSJ reports that Trondheim is a
distressed-debt hedge fund that has been excluded from the Suntech restructuring
process and provided no information on how it might recover its investment. If there is no
money to pay lawyers and no money to pay judgment creditors, we think there is very
unlikely to be any money for shareholders.


Distressed debt investors are going to take everything left over (if there is anything
to be had)


Just in case there is anything left over after the Chinese banks get paid (and the lawyers
get paid), the vulture funds that own Suntech's distressed debt have already spoken for it.
In a notice to bondholders dated 7/15/13, Wilmington Trust as bondholder trustee wrote,
"On June 28, 2013, the Company entered into a third forbearance agreement with a
majority of the Noteholders to extend the forbearance period through August 30, 2013.
The Third Forbearance Agreement contemplates an equitization of all major debt
claims held by the Noteholders and allows Noteholders to nominate two additional
members to the Company's board of directors to assist in the Company's ongoing
restructuring efforts."


That sounds like existing shareholders will be massively diluted, which was confirmed in a
company press release a few weeks later, when on 8/30/13, Suntech announced, "The
Company intends to immediately commence preparations for implementing a
recapitalization plan that contemplates a scheme of arrangement as part of a holistic
restructuring of the Suntech Group. The principal components of the restructuring scheme
would include…the exchange of outstanding debt into the Company's equity…there
is expected to be substantial dilution for our existing shareholders."


The playbook from YRCW


We have seen how a distressed situation with significant shareholder dilution plays out via
the most recent YRC Worldwide restructuring (NASDAQ:YRCW). In February 2011, YRC
announced a restructuring in which the "term sheet contemplates a very substantial
dilution of existing equity holders." Then in April, the Company unveiled further details of

the restructuring that "would result in the company's existing shareholders holding
approximately 2.5% of the company's outstanding common stock subject to further dilution
by a management incentive plan and the conversion of certain new securities".

Finally, in September 2011, YRC announced the approval of the previously contemplated
restructuring plan and the door was shut on YRCW stock. An investor who held shares of
YRCW in February would have lost of 97% of his investment, and an investor who held
shares on the April 2011 restructuring announcement date would have lost over 96% of
his investment.


Suntech has already said that there is expected to be substantial dilution for existing
shareholders. Based on what happened in the YRC restructuring, this is a very ominous
sign for Suntech shareholders, especially when all of the above factors are taken into
account.


Conclusion


Given the widespread fraud, "severe cash flow drain", bankruptcy filing in China,
preparations for commencing a scheme of arrangement (bankruptcy equivalent) for
Suntech Power Holdings, and company stated expectation of substantial shareholder
dilution, we believe Suntech equity is effectively worthless. If the YRCW roadmap serves
as any indication of what's to come, Suntech shareholders should brace themselves for
90%+ losses from here.
