LONGTOP FINANCIAL
(NYSE:LFT) FINAL PROOF
OF UNDISCLOSED
RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS


   Management Continues to Mislead
Investors


 


Two weeks ago Citron Research reported on
Longtop Financial (NYSE:LFT).  Citron questioned
whether the third-party agency disbursing payroll,
benefits and other HR functions for over 80% of
Longtop’s technical employees was in fact an
unrelated party, as Longtop has claimed for over
two years.  Just last week, the company
vehemently denied our report, and went so far as
to conduct a conference call, replete with analysts’
defense of the name.


One week after Citron’s report, Longtop CFO Derek
Palaschuk, resigned his post as head of the audit
committee of the heavily anticipated IPO Renren. 
This confirmed our suspicion that something very
shady was going on at Longtop.  It appeared as if
Wall St. was preparing for the next shoe to drop on
Longtop….well here it is.


Here is the proof — what you all have been waiting
for.  As Citron was preparing part II of its

investigation into Longtop, we were beaten to the
punch by respected research shop OLP Global. 
Now, while Citron will not distribute a copy of the
OLP Report (call them up and become a client), we
today post documentation that proves Xiamen
Longtop Human Resources (XLHRS) is indeed a
related party to Longtop Financial.


This linked PDF contains routine governmental
filings of XLHRS and its SAIC filings.  These
documents from 2007, 2008, and 2009 are
signed by employees of Longtop Financial’s
legal department, who have apparently been
handling and signing off a variety of routine
government filings for Longtop Human Resources
(XLHRS).

So now we are supposed to believe that XLHRS,
located on Longtop Financial’s premises, has only
one client, Longtop Financial, used the same email
servers, AND had staff from Longtop’s legal
department personnel sign their administrative
filings with the government … but they’re NOT a
related party.  C’mon….Really?


Once you get beyond the shock that legal
responsibility of XLHRS is administered by Longtop
employees, you get to the financials of XLHRS, as
disclosed in the SAIC documents, which tell an
ominous story that strongly warrants the scrutiny
of objective third party verification.


AIC of XLHRS [http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/05/AIC-of-XLHRS.pdf]


According to LFT 20-F, XLHRS is to receive a
service fee for all 3,200 employees they “handle”
for Longtop’s mostly technical and professional
workforce (appx 76% of its headcount).  This
service fee is defined as “for salary + bonus +
social insurance + other expense for the entire
year”.  On a conservative basis, this would amount
to $400 to 500 million RMB.


Yet, on these SAIC docs we see a total revenue (or
service fee) of merely $5.1 mil RMB.

Every other number of the SAIC filings shows that
XLHRS would be underpaying the government for
benefits for Longtop Financial employees, but that
is a sideshow if the company is lying about its
revenue by such proportion.


Now we understand that much has been made
about the inaccuracies of SAIC filings, but please
note that these filings from XLHRS ARE AUDITED.

This throws out the whole myth of just scribbling
some numbers on the paper and submitting them
to the government.  Clearly these filings do not
accurately reflect a company handling payroll,
benefits and human resources expenses for 3,236
people, operating under an agreement such as
this:

Citron believes that one of the two scenarios
stated below is true…which one we don’t know.


1. Longtop Human Resources (XLHRS) is and
was always a related party to Longtop
Financial, essentially a captive entity created
to hide expenses of Longtop Financial, and/or
underpay employee benefits.  They never in
fact paid LFT employees as stipulated by SEC
filings and press releases, but rather were
always a vehicle to hide off balance sheet
transactions.


2. Longtop Financial is a fraud of massive
proportion that does not operate nearly on the
scale that they claim … either way, Longtop
Human Resources is still a related party.


Ximamin Longtop Human Resources (XLHRS) is
apparently not doing the size and scale of non-
related party business that was reflected to
Longtop Financial shareholders.  As to the other

details, we will let it all play out in the many
lawsuits that the company faces. 


In order to properly deliver any form of
transparency to Wall Street, investors and analysts
need to know who is paying Longtop’s employees,
who is paying their benefits, are the amounts
proper as according to Chinese law, and are the
expenses being fully reflected on Longtop’s
financials.  


 


  The Deloitte Conundrum


On the conference call last week defending the
company, Longtop's CFO made an extraordinary
claim that his relationship with the company's
auditor, Deloitte, was "very close, third only to his
relationship to his family and the CEO”.  Leaving
aside for a moment the impropriety of such a
statement (after all, auditors work on behalf of the
shareholders and the integrity of the markets, not
the company insiders), the evidence posted today
places Deloitte in a very uncomfortable position. 
How could anyone charged with verifying the
accuracy of Longtop's Financials look at these
documents and dismiss the reasonable concern
(not to mention professional skepticism) that
Longtop's largest expense line item is being
transacted through a related party with full
transparency ? 
 
If Longtop insists XLHRS is unrelated, Deloitte has
the responsibility to "audit XLHRS from the
outside", considering at its tax filings, and all
government payroll benefits deposits purportedly
made on behalf of Longtop's employees, to "open
the black box" of Longtop's staffing expense as
wide as possible to the light of transparency.


Meanwhile, Longtop has stated its full confidence
that its 20-F, due next month, would be signed off
by its auditor with no reservations. 


Lastly, it is Citron’s opinion that believing an
unrelated third party ran your human resource
business to make $30,000  a year (according to

filings) is as crazy as believing that a Chairman of
a company would just give away $80 million in
stock to his employees because money doesn’t
really mean that much to him (as per the CFO’s
explanation).


For those of you who have the benefit of being a
client of OLP, we recommend you read their full
report on Longtop.  They do an excellent job at
explaining the history of broken acquisitions by
Longtop and other shortcomings in their story. 


  Conclusion


We hope this can end any debate as to whether
the company has been deceiving its investors.  It
is not the time to host any more conference calls
or cover ups.  The excuses have run their course. 
It is now time to confess, let the auditors figure
out the necessary restatements, and let the real
Longtop Financial Technologies stand up.
