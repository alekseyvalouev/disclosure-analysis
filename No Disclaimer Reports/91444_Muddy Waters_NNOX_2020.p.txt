management” was responsible for the company’s financial decline, according to the suit. 
 
The suit further stated that Poliakine approved the $54 million “unjustifiable” acquisition of 
HoMedics, in which Poliakin and entities affiliated with certain board members had stakes, while 
hiding the other board members’ involvement from the broader board.84  Poliakine did this, the 
suit said, “to enable them to collect personal profits, at the expense of the company and its 
shareholders’ wellbeing, by causing significant financial losses to the company.”85  Indeed, 
Powermat allegedly wrote down 95% of HoMedics’ inventory within three months.

Burch also claims that he invested on the basis of forecasts that Poliakin made of up to $400+ 
million in annual sales based on “the vast business potential of the company”.86  Actual revenue 
for those forecasted periods allegedly ended up being less than 10% what Poliakine had claimed, 
while Powermat allegedly “wrote off at least $200 million in investments” and failed to make a 
profit. 
 
In 2017, a director of Nanox Gibraltar, Moshe Moalem, whom Poliakine had described as his 
“close friend and business partner”, sued Poliakine in Israeli court for $1.5 million dollars.87,88,89  
In the suit, Moalem alleges that Poliakine committed accounting fraud; that Poliakine attempted 
to deceive Moalem and other partners as well as third parties; and that when Poliakine was 
selling Powermat shares, he misreported the sale price to Israeli tax authorities.90  Moalem 
alleges that the purpose of these maneuvers was for Poliakine to meet his own financial 
obligations.
