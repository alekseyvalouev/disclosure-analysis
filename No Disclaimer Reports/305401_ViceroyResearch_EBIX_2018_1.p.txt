Ebix – Goodwill Hunting 
Accounting irregularit ies, undisclosed tax investigations, auditor shuffl ing, poison pill to 


protect short sellers:  welcome to Ebix.  


DECEMBER 11, 2018 – Following on from our presentation of the same title, Viceroy are releasing our preliminary 


report on Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX). Our investigation has uncovered accounting discrepancies dating as far back as 


2008 to present day as well as several other red flags. 


▪ Numerous accounting discrepancies in years 2013 to 2018 regarding the recognition of goodwill and 


acquisitions within the Ebix group. These discrepancies have largely gone unnoticed due to the delay in local 


filings being signed off and the multi-jurisdictional nature of these transactions. 


▪ Over the course of our investigation we uncovered evidence of what we believe is a scheme to incorrectly 


book revenue and earnings. We believe this is done through the shuffling of assets from one subsidiary to 


another while improperly booking internal revenues, and contingent consideration “cookie jar” accounting.  


- We are limited by the recency of the available subsidiary filings. We believe this behavior continues to 


take place. Ebix’s acquisition spree in India further muddies the waters. 


▪ Ebix announced a change in auditor to T.R. Chadha from Cherry Bekaert (of MiMedx fame) after reporting 


material weaknesses regarding purchase and income tax accounting, pursuant to appointing a big four 


accounting firm in Q1 2019.  


- T.R. Chadha has never audited a US-listed entity and was auditor of several Indian Ebix subsidiaries in 


which there appear to be several accounting discrepancies.  


- Cherry Bekaert was subject to a scathing PCAOB inspection just weeks before its replacement. 


▪ Ebix’s subsidiary structure is excessively convoluted and opaque. The subsidiary structure includes holding 


companies in geographies where obtaining financials is near impossible. Many subsidiaries are held under 


a UK entity, Ebix International Holdings, which has only ever filed locally as a dormant company and recently 


received a warning of compulsory dissolution for failing to file accounts. 


▪ Ebix’s joint venture with Vayam Technologies, Ebix Vayam, accounts for 25% of Ebix’s receivables and only 


customers are Vayam Technologies themselves. Vayam appears never to have settled its receivables and 


the entire JV is funded by Ebix at an 8% interest rate, payable in receivables. This appears to be a scheme 


through which cash is injected in to make paper gains of margin plus 8%. 


▪ Ebix CEO Robin Raina is entitled to a massive payout in the event of an acquisition at the expense of 


shareholders. This poison pill protects short-sellers from takeovers by attaching an unreasonable premium 


to the company. This arrangement and its predecessor are currently subject of ongoing shareholder 


litigation. 


▪ The company’s debt-fueled acquisition binge in India was originally intended to create and list an Indian 


payments entity. This appears to have turned into an unfocused rollup, with more and more scattered 


businesses being added to the Ebix stable. Despite these additions, Ebix does not break out its revenues 


from these disparate income streams. 


▪ Ebix’s has been subject to an undisclosed tax audit by the Australian Taxation Office since 2016, we believe 


due to the transfer of Telstra eBusiness Exchange assets to Ebix Singapore, and non-arm’s length 


transactions. 


Due to the delay in availability of subsidiary accounts, and the rapidly expanding nature of the company’s 


operations we are unable to quantify a base downside. We believe it is highly likely given the progress of the 


shareholder litigation that regulatory authorities including the SEC open or reopen their investigations into the 


company. Accordingly, we believe that Ebix carries a high investment risk.

1. Short Thesis 





We decided to dust off the Ebix story earlier this year after the company disclosed in its 2017 audit that it had 


material weaknesses pertaining to internal controls “over the valuation and accuracy of the accounting for 


income taxes and purchase accounting”.  


 
Figure 1 Ebix 2017 10-K 


The core focus of our investigation was on M&A-related activity including goodwill, intangibles, earnouts as well 


as geographical information. From there we turned our attention to the international subsidiaries: for being a 


relatively small company, Ebix’s corporate structure is very complex. There are numerous subsidiaries with 


multiple layers that morph over time, and where intangible assets are continuously transferred. We believe 


subsidiary filings obscure the financial issues within the company. 


Strangely most subsidiary audits are not signed off until long after – sometimes years -  Cherry Bekaert signed 


off on Ebix’s audits, that are meant to consolidate the subsidiary filings.  


For example, the Ebix Singapore subsidiary’s 2016 audit does not appear to get signed off on until April 10, 2018 


with the 2014 audit not finalized on until September 2016 – almost two years after the fact. As a result, for some 


companies the most recent filings available are from 2016.  


Although we have thus far been unable to obtain the audited financials for two of the more recent important 


subsidiaries/regions, Ebix Asia Pacific (Dubai) and Ebix Asia Holdings (Mauritius), we have seen enough at this 


point to raise serious concerns on the accounting transactions between these subsidiaries as well as between 


Ebix and these subsidiaries.
Viceroy Research Group 4 viceroyresearch.org 


The company has many red flags including: 


▪ Excessively convoluted and opaque corporate structure with numerous layered international 


subsidiaries combined with significant discrepancies in intra-group transactions;  


▪ Numerous accounting discrepancies dating from 20013 to 2016 regarding transactions between 


subsidiaries; 


▪ Receivables largely accounted for by a joint-venture, whose sole customer is the other joint venture 


partner. The JV appears to have no appreciable cash inflows, leading us to believe this may be a scheme 


to purchase revenues; 


▪ CEO has in place an anti-takeover “poison pill” which entitles him to a massive payout in the event of 


an acquisition, creating a significant premium for any would-be acquirer. The predecessor to this policy 


may have already prevented one acquisition; 


▪ Ebix’s Australian subsidiary has been subject to a tax audit since 2015, with no disclosure of this to 


investors; 


▪ Ebix’s Indian acquisitions have become more and more scattered and now appear to be a simple debt-


fueled roll-up; 


▪ Recently announced change in auditor to Indian auditor with no experience auditing a US-listed entity 


and was also auditor for the subsidiaries at which we found accounting discrepancies. Cherry Bekaert’s 


departure after discovery of significant weaknesses mirrors the departure of KPMG in similar 


circumstances in 2004; 


▪ International subsidiary audits signed off well after the US parent auditor signed off on the financials; 


▪ The existence of prior SEC and IRS investigations. Due to the length of the SEC investigation into the 


company and progress of shareholder litigation into the company, it is highly likely that this 


investigation is reopened.   


2. Subsidiary Structure 
Ebix’s subsidiary structure is extremely convoluted relative to the size of the entire operation. While the 


company does list the name and location of its subsidiaries in attachments to its 10-K filings, a full description of 


the company’s structure was only made public through a credit amendment appended to the 2017 10-K. This 


was not in the form of a text file, or within the accounts, but several hundred image files essentially making it 


impossible to find through regular web searches.  


For ease of access we have included the organizational structure as of February 2, 2018, in Annexure A.  


The pace of the company’s acquisitions and shuffling of assets makes the utility of this chart limited, however 


we believe this clearly illustrates the convolution and complexity in which Ebix has managed to engineer profits. 


The company also accounts for different geographical segments in an uncommon manner. Quarterly reports 


break down “external revenues” which sum to form the top-line revenue number. 


Annual reports include pre-tax profit by geography, which sum to the income before income tax line item on the 


income statement.

Figures 2 & 3 Ebix Q3 2018 10-Q External Revenues and Pre-tax income 


External revenues are accounted for largely by where the company delivers its services.  


 
Figure 4 Extract – Ebix 2017 10-K 


3. Goodwill hunting 
While unconventional, we believe in this case it makes sense for us to describe the archetypes of the 


discrepancies at Ebix before going into concrete examples.  


Parts of this process were uncovered by previous short seller reports – or shareholder law suits – however we 


believe they only uncovered half the equation, and that these gimmicks may have been employed as far back as 


2009. The method uses the opacity of subsidiary accounts and goodwill accounting to artificially inflate pre-tax 


profits at various international subsidiaries. 


Example A: Goodwill play 
A subsidiary is transferred from Ebix Holding Company A to Holding Company B at a premium to book value. The 


gain on sale recognized by Company A appears to flow through to Ebix’s consolidated pre-tax profit.  


This situation has most notably, to us, arisen due to unusual accounting treatment in foreign jurisdictions, for 


which Ebix’s auditors appear to pay no consideration. 


We began looking into these gimmicks due to large, one-off jumps in pre-tax profits in certain Ebix segments 


after intellectual property assets were sold. 


Example B: Contingent Consideration play 
Ebix announces the acquisition of Company A for part consideration in cash and $Xm in contingent consideration 


based on an earn-out agreement. 


Contingent consideration never expected to be paid out, and in some instances does not appear to exist at all 


within filings of acquiring holding companies. Ebix later reverses this contingency and books this as earnings.

4. Main Findings 
2009: Telstra eBusiness Exchange transfer leaves cash black hole  
Telstra eBusiness Services insurance exchange was purchased on January 2, 2008 through Ebix Australia (VIC) 


Pty Ltd. Ebix’s 2008 10-K reports a purchase price of US$43.8m (AU$50m), which correlates with Australian 


filings of the same value: 


 
Figure 5 Ebix 2008 10-K 


 
Figure 6 Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd 2008 Annual Report 


Ebix then transferred these assets to Singapore the following year. 


 
Figure 7 Ebix Singapore 2009 Annual Report 


There was no cash consideration for this transfer: Ebix Australia appears to only recognize an AUD47.484m 


(US$33.143m) reduction in related-party payables. 


 
Figure 8 Ebix Australia 2009 Trade Payables
Viceroy Research Group 7 viceroyresearch.org 


But Ebix Singapore did recognize a cash expense of SG$76.108m for the purchase adjusting the “purchase of 


intangible assets” line item for other assets acquired during the year, and specifically notes that this was indeed 


a cash transaction: 





 
Figures 9 & 10 Ebix Singapore annual report 2009 extracts 


There is no accounting for this cash in Australia, and the cash appears to have tripped from an Ebix related party 


to the Singapore entity. 


 
Figures 11 & 12 Ebix Singapore annual report 2009 extracts 


Note that Ebix Singapore is not the parent company of Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd, but they do share a Swedish 


parent company, EIH Holdings. As pointed out previously by other researchers, EIH Holdings auditor, BDO 


Sweden resigned due to an inability to confirm which subsidiaries and assets EIH Holdings owned. 


We believe this transaction is one reason that the Australian Tax Office has been 


undertaking an audit of Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd since 2016.  


 
Figure 13 Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd annual report 2017 


This is one of what we believe to be numerous investigations into Ebix by international financial regulators, 


which have not been disclosed to shareholders. 


There is no record of where this SG$78m went, or even if this cash existed at all. In fact, Ebix’s consolidated 


statement of cash flows and balance sheet in 2009 suggest that the businesses did not even have this amount 


of cash to distribute internally. 


These issues should not exist under oversight from a reliable auditor. As far as audit risk goes, cash transactions 


are quite simple to verify, and difficult to fabricate – the transactions should literally exist on a bank statement.
Viceroy Research Group 8 viceroyresearch.org 


Overall, Ebix’s Australian division appears to be in disarray. BDO quit as Ebix’s Australian auditor around the 


same time as they issued a complaint against its immediate parent company in Sweden, a creditor applied to 


wind up the business due to unpaid bills in 2009, assets appear to be transferred out of Australia with no tax 


consequences or cash consideration, and Ebix’s reported Australian revenues and sales do not reconcile since 


at least 2013 by a factor of up to 2x. These discrepancies have continued despite being highlighted by numerous 


research reports in the past. 


We will continue to update investors on these issues in ongoing reports. 


2013: Qatarlyst acquisition creates US$8m profit through fake earn-out reversal 
On April 7, 2013 Ebix established its second UK subsidiary, Ebix UK Limited, with the purchase of Qatarlyst1: a 


money-losing company previously receiving funding from Qatar Insurance Services LLC (QIS) an offshoot of the 


Qatari government.  


Per UK filings at the time of the transaction, there were 27.829m shares issued at GBP1 each (US$42.056m) 


transferred between QIS and the Singapore subsidiary, consisting of the original 12.203m shares issued under 


QIS ownership and an additional 15.626m shares issued April 2, 2013 to converting the assumed debt of 


Qatarlyst to equity.   


 
Figure 14 Qatarlyst Return of allotment of shares form dated April 2, 2013 


 
Figure 15 CompaniesHouse UK Annual Return dated January 14, 2014 


Per the 2014 Ebix Singapore financials, Ebix Singapore only paid US$5.025m in cash along with a contingent 


consideration of US$1.065m to acquire a 100% equity interest in Qatarlyst.

Viceroy Research Group 9 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figures 16 & 17 Ebix Singapore annual report 2013 


Ebix’s consolidated accounts, however, show a contingent earn-out consideration arrangement of US$9.425m, 


not US$1.065m. Note the US$8.36m difference between these figures, it appears later as pre-tax profit. 


 
Figure 18 Ebix 2013 10-K Summary of acquisitions 


Note: Qatarlyst was the only acquisition made by Ebix in the year ended December 2013. 


2014: Merger of Qatarlyst and Trisystems   
Just over a year later in August 2014, Ebix’s Qatarlyst and Trisystems UK subsidiaries merged when Ebix UK 


Limited (formerly Qatarlyst) subsidiary purchased Ebix Europe Limited (formerly Trisystems). Ebix UK Limited 


changed its name to Ebix Europe Limited to hold these assets.  


Ebix’s 2014 10-K showed the Europe region reported an increase of almost US$8.58m in pre-tax income from 


US$1.36m in 2013 US$9.94m, a 730.88% increase.
Viceroy Research Group 10 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figures 19, 20 & 21 2013, 2014 & 2015 Geographical breakdown of pre-tax revenues 


At the time, Ebix Europe was the only Ebix subsidiary in Europe excluding Sweden, which was accounted for 


separately. This pre-tax income increase correlates with the ~US$8m difference in contingent consideration 


reported by Ebix when it acquired Qatarlyst in 2012. 


This surge in income could not feasibly be from operations, as Ebix Europe reported only US$1.004m of pre-tax 


income. Ebix also stated the earn-out was to be based on Qatarlyst’s performance in 2014, 2015 and 2016. 


 
Figure 22 Ebix UK Income Statement 2014 


Not surprisingly, the audited pre-tax income for the Europe/UK region fell back down to US$2.338m in 2015 and 


has remained at that level ever since.  


We believe that Ebix fabricated an excess of $8m in contingent consideration to create a 


‘cookie jar’ through which it could then reverse and book profits. Local accounts suggest 


this goodwill never existed. 


This discrepancy was accompanied by a spate of auditor resignations. 


KPMG resigned as Qatarlyst’s auditor as of June 26, 20142 – just before the conclusion of Ebix’s merger of the 


two UK subsidiaries and before it had completed the 2013 audit. KPMG had essentially never completed an audit 


of Qatarlyst under Ebix’s ownership. Ebix appointed a small audit firm that previously handled TriSystems audits:

Viceroy Research Group 11 viceroyresearch.org 


Akshar & Company. Akshar signed off on the 2013 audit on August 29, 2014 but resigned on August 1, 2015 3 


before signing off on the 2014 audit.  


Finally, Ebix brought in another small audit firm, Carter Backer Winter LLP, who signed off on the 2014 audit on 


October 28, 2015 and has remained at least through the last filing which was the 2016 audit. 


 
Figure 23 Timeline of Ebix’s UK operations 


Previous shareholder litigation against Ebix, which has since settled, found an identical cookie jar accounting 


scheme relating to the acquisition of Peak Performance Solutions4.  


2015: Oakstone and Healthcare Magic (India, Singapore) 
Ebix’s Indian operations reported steady profits until 2015 when they increased to US$58.67m from 


US$28.194m, a 108.09% increase. This was not repeated the following year with profits of US$40.444m for 2016, 


a similar situation to the Ebix Europe merger. 


 
Figure 24 India pre-tax profits 


Lacking a clear explanation for this drastic increase in what was previously a stable segment, we further 


investigated the company’s Indian operations. 


Ebix Software India Private Limited (Ebix Software India) is a subsidiary of Ebix Singapore and up to the 


acquisition of the EbixCash component entities was Ebix’s main presence in India. The company’s mandate is 


somewhat vague, but it appears to mostly deal in IT services, software development and online health services.

Within Ebix’s financials it is categorized as part of the India segment however the majority of its revenue is 


derived from transactions with its holding company, Ebix Singapore. 


 
Figures 25 & 26 Ebix Software India annual report 2015 


More concerning to us is the transactions of intangible assets between Ebix Software India, Ebix and Ebix 


Singapore which we believe resulted in US$30m of incorrectly recognized revenue in 2015. 


Oakstone and Healthcare Magic 
In 2014 Ebix acquired HealthCare Magic Private Limited (HealthCare Magic) in Q2 and Oakstone Publishing, LLC 


(Oakstone) in Q4. These two acquisitions created US$34.388m of goodwill at Ebix.

Ebix Software India’s auditor shuffle 
For reasons unknown, Ebix Software India extended its reporting period to 15 months from 12 months for the 


period ending March 31, 2015 sometime prior to September 2014. Note that at this point the 2015 audit had 


not yet been signed off. 


 
Figure 28 Ebix Software India annual report 2015 


An Ebix press release dated September 4, 2014 announced the appointment of Ernst & Young Indian affiliate 


S.R. Batliboi & Associates LLP as auditors for Ebix Software India5. However, S.R. Batliboi & Associates resigned 


as auditor on June 8, 2015, and were replaced with local auditor T.R. Chadha & Co. before they could complete 


the 2015 audit. T.R. Chadha & Co. still hold the position and have recently been appointed Ebix’s worldwide 


auditor.

Most relevant is that the audit for the 15 month period ended March 31, 2015 was not signed off by T.R. Chadha 


until February 6, 20166. 


As such it was not until February 4, 2016 that High Court of Allahabad approved the transfer of HealthCare 


Magic and Oakstone assets from the US to India effective from the original acquisition dates. The 2015 audit 


was conducted as though these assets had been under Ebix Software India since their acquisitions in Q2 and Q4 


of 2014.

Through the Oakstone & HealthCare Magic amalgamation, Ebix Software India was entitled amortize the 


goodwill associated with amalgamation under Indian GAAP7. This goodwill amounted to US$37.146m, roughly 


what was recorded by Ebix when these deals closed in their respective quarters of Q2 and Q4 2014. 


Ebix Software India started amortizing like it was going out of style, with US$17.774m amortized as of March 31, 


2015 and the remaining US$24.293m amortizing in the 15-month period ending March 31, 20168.

We believe these ~US$0 assets were purchased by Ebix Singapore, and created a large pre-tax gain on sale at 


the Indian subsidiary level. This intra-group transaction appears to have bumped Ebix’s consolidated pre-tax 


profits by ~US$28m in 2015, and accounts for the massive one-off bump in pre-tax profits in that year. 


 
Figures 32 & 33 2014 & 2015 Ebix geographical pre-tax income  


Given these entities had essentially no hard assets, we believe the gain on sale recorded by the Indian 


subsidiary has flowed through to EBIX’s consolidated accounts given no other significant business changes in 


the segment. 


Interestingly, there was no disclosure by Ebix or its subsidiaries that Oakstone had been transferred to 


Singapore. So how do we know? Because as part of a group restructuring exercise in 2016, Ebix Singapore sold 


IP to Ebix’s newly formed Dubai entity. 


 
Figures 34 & 35 Ebix Singapore 2015 & 2016 Annual Report 


Hidden within hundreds of unsearchable JPG files lodged with the SEC10, we find that Oakstone was one of the 


IP assets sold to Dubai, and we now have a paper trail showing these assets must have been sold to Singapore. 


We find peculiar, unexplained non-cash movements in Singapore’s accounts over the same year for this 


~US$30m transaction. 


2016: Dubai  
Ebix’s Dubai subsidiary, Ebix Asia Pacific FZ LLC (Ebix Dubai), was incorporated in 2016 and reported US$42.397m 


of profit in its first year: the sector had not previously reported any profits nor assets.  


Ebix Dubai’s holding structure is unconventional for a company that holds so many of Ebix’s total assets. Its 


immediate parent company is Mauritius-domiciled Ebix Asia Holdings, Inc., who is in turn held by Ebix 


International Holdings Limited, a UK company. Ebix International Holdings Limited is in turn owned by Ebix.

Figure 36 Ebix Credit Amendment 6  


Ebix International Holdings was briefly mentioned in Ebix’s 2015 10-K. 


 
Figure 37 Ebix 2015 10-K  


However according to UK filings, Ebix International Holdings’ 2017 accounts are overdue, and the company is in 


the process of being compulsorily stricken off for lack of filings. Its last filings for 2016 were classified as 


“Accounts for a dormant company”. It appears to have conducted a capital raise on November 27, 2017 but had 


no other significant activities.

Returning to Ebix Dubai: it appears to have been formed due to an asset transfer from Ebix Singapore around 


the middle of 2016 as per Ebix Singapore’s financials.

Figures 40 & 41 Ebix Singapore 2015 & 2016 Annual Report 


Ebix’s 2016 financials reported US$54.142m of assets in Dubai, up from $0 a year before. As reported in the 


2016 Singapore audit, the company took a US$30.264 million impairment charge on the transfer and disposal of 


these assets to Dubai. So, the amount of goodwill and intangible assets transferred was in the vicinity of 


$84.820m.  


Readers will note that the disclosure as to what was actually transferred is quite light on details: there are no 


obvious disclosures in either Ebix Singapore or Ebix as to what was transferred. 


There is, however, a credit agreement amendment dated February 21, 2018 showing the ownership of 


copyrights and trademarks by each of Ebix’s subsidiaries. 


It appears as though Ebix Singapore transferred to Ebix Dubai the assets of: 


▪ Health Connect Systems (HCS) aka Agency Solutions.com LLC, an Ebix subsidiary domiciled in the US 


but apparently fully owned by Singapore.  


▪ EbixAdvantage and EbixASP from the renamed Telstra subsidiary acquired in 2008. 


▪ Fintechnix 


▪ Planetsoft Holdings Inc.  


▪ Oakstone Publishing 


Ebix’s 10Qs, the Singapore geographic asset balance dropped from US$68.718m in Q2 2016 to $34.008m in Q2 


and to US$17.505m in Q3 2016. At the same time, the Dubai geographic assets ballooned from zero in Q1 to 


US$37.943m in Q2 and to US$54.333m in Q3. 





 
Figure 42, 43 & 44 Ebix Q1, Q2 & Q3 10-Q external revenues and long lived assets  


As noted earlier, the Dubai geographic pre-tax income was reported at US$42.397m in 2016 from US$0 in 2015. 


The Singapore geographic pre-tax profits dropped to US$1.218m in 2016 from US$13.177m in 2015.
Viceroy Research Group 17 viceroyresearch.org 


  
Figures 45 & 46 Ebix 10-K 2015 & 2016 pre-tax income  


However, in the 2016 Ebix Singapore subsidiary’s audited financials, it reported a pre-tax loss of US$27.581m 


due to taking the US$30.264m loss on this asset transfer and disposal. 


 
Figure 47 Ebix Singapore annual report 2016 


Despite this goodwill loss occurring at the subsidiary level, Ebix did not disclose any reduction in goodwill for the 


period ending 2016 associated with these assets. We believe this transaction essentially ‘corrects’ Singapore’s 


books.  


We are also skeptical as to whether Ebix Dubai ever paid for these assets considering for this disposal Ebix 


Singapore received US$54.422m and then turned around and loaned it out to a related company, which could 


conceivably be the Dubai subsidiary. 


 
Figure 48 Ebix Singapore annual report 2016 


An obvious implication of these significant non-cash transactions is, as already highlighted by numerous short 


sellers, that Ebix Singapore – which had substantial IP tax benefits – was acquiring significant amounts of IP from 


high tax jurisdictions, without any transfer of cash. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.  


These transactions do not appear to be arm’s length.

5. Other red flags 


 Management & financial control issues 


Robin Raina’s “poison pill” anti-takeover compensation 
Ebix’s CEO Robin Raina is subject to possibly the most generous compensation scheme we at Viceroy have ever 


seen for a company of comparable size. The company has in place an anti-takeover “poison pill” agreement 


which entitles Raina to a massive payout in the event of an acquisition of 50% of the shares outstanding or more. 


The Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement (SARA) replaces the Acquisition Bonus Agreement (ABA), its 


controversial predecessor over which legal action between the company and stockholders is still ongoing.  


Despite claims that Raina himself asked for the re-evaluation leading to the SARA replacing the ABA, the terms 


of SARA actually appear more beneficial for him. 


The SARA, effective April 10, 2018 states: 


▪ Raina received 5,953,975 stock appreciation rights (SARs), which in the case of an acquisition, entitle 


Raina to a cash payment equal to the excess of the net proceeds per share received for the acquisition 


over the base price of US$7.95 per share. 


▪ Annually, the board shall determine if the sum of the Ebix SARs and shares held by Raina is less than 


20% of the number of SARs and shares outstanding. If so, Raina is granted enough new SARs to 


eliminate this shortfall. 


▪ The company will also pay any taxes incurred by Raina due to the exercise of the SARs in the case of an 


acquisition. 


This mechanism essentially acts as an anti-takeover device by imposing a huge cost to the company in the event 


of a takeover. A back of the envelope simulation if company were to be taken over for market value on the day 


of the SARA at a share price of US$75.75 per share results in a total payable to Raina of US$553m including taxes. 


 
Figure 49 Viceroy SARA cost estimate 


Obviously, we have made some assumptions with the calculation above but we do so to illustrate the 


effectiveness of this “poison pill”. An evaluation of the previous ABA was performed by consultants Korn Ferry 


to determine the amount payable to Raina under the ABA in the event of a takeover.

Figure 50 Korn Ferry ABA cost estimates 


The SAR premium increases as the proceeds per share do, such that the more expensive the company, the more 


Raina benefits as a portion of the acquisition price. 


The ABA has played a role in preventing acquisitions in the past: documents from the ongoing stockholder 


litigation show that Raina was unwilling to give up his bonus. An exchange between Raina and the Carlyle Group 


show negotiations based around US$20 per share but requested Raina cap his change of control bonus at 


US$24m. For reference, on January 29, 2013, Ebix shares were trading between US$16.56 to US$16.74 per share. 


 
Figure 51 Extract of Ebix Stockholder Litigation12 


We believe the Goldman acquisition that fell through in mid-2009 only got as far as it did due to Raina’s waiving 


of his acquisition bonus under the ABA.  





                                                                 
12 CONSOLIDATED C.A. No. 8526-VCS
Viceroy Research Group 20 viceroyresearch.org 


The existence of the ABA and SARA are a major red flag as: 


1. It can be, and has been, used to allow the CEO to show preference in acquiring entities by waiving or 


not waiving its terms. 


2. It effectively prevents an acquisition due to attaching a huge premium to any acquisition thereby 


artificially inflating Ebix’s purchase price. 


3. Allegations made in legal filings suggest Ebix’s directors and compensation committee may be less 


independent than required. 


Auditor issues 
On October 5, 2018, Ebix a change of worldwide audit partner to T.R. Chadha and Co taking over from Cherry 


Bekaert13 as an interim measure announcing their intention to appoint a big 4 firm in Q1 2019. Cherry Bekaert 


will continue to be retained as the US component auditor reporting to T.R. Chadha. 


 
Figure 52 Ebix press release “Ebix reiterates strong business outlook”14 


Note that Ebix had reported material weaknesses over financial controls in their 2017 10-K, specifically regarding 


income taxes and purchase accounting. This echoes the situation in 2004 when then-auditor KPMG “identified 


certain significant deficiencies relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting”. 


Cherry Bekaert also audited MiMedx, a company we have previously reported on and who are now restating 


financial statements as far back as 201215. The 2017 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board inspection 


report into Cherry Bekaert is scathing:  





 
Figures 53 & 54 PCAOB Cherry Bekaert inspection report16 


Those familiar with our work will know Cherry Bekaert were also long time auditors of another Marietta based 


company, MiMedx, until August 2017, where they were replaced by EY just one week prior to their PCAOB 


inspection. EY subsequently refused to sign off on accounts, retrospectively advised that accounts could not be 


relied upon from at least 2012 onwards, and has most recently quit on the apparent basis that internal controls 


to verify MiMedx’s financials “do not exist”, making us wonder how Cherry Bekaert was able to audit the 


accounts in the first place.

Figure 55 MiMedx 8-K – Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant – December 4, 2018 


Cherry Bekaert have acted as Ebix’s auditor since 200817, and the facts presented in this report should further 


call into question the integrity of these audits. That the firm is remaining as Ebix’s US audit partner should not 


be welcomed as a sign of integrity. 


T.R. Chadha has a less than stellar track record in our book, considering they were the auditor for Ebix Software 


India for the Oakstone transaction and Ebix Vayam Technologies, the revenue-purchasing JV. This firm will now 


be auditing Ebix operations worldwide. Further, T.R. Chadha has no experience auditing a US-listed entity that 


we can find. 


We believe both audit firms, T.R. Chadha and Co and Cherry Bekaert, have significant 


strikes against their records 


The change of auditor in the face of discovery of reporting and control deficiencies or weaknesses is not a new 


phenomenon. This also occurred when KPMG identified internal control issues at Ebix in 2003 and were replaced 


by BDO Seidman.  


 Receivables 


Vayam joint venture 
Ebix announced the formation and mandate of a joint venture with Vayam Technologies Limited (Vayam) in their 


Q1 2016 10-Q.  


 
Figure 56 Ebix 2016 10-K Investment in joint venture 


This company, Ebix Vayam Technologies Limited (Ebix Vayam) appears to exist solely to allow Ebix to buy 


revenues: the company appears to have only ever done business with Vayam Technologies itself since inception. 


The company is funded largely through loans from Ebix which are repayable out of the receivables account which 


stands at 446 days as of March 31, 2018.

Viceroy Research Group 22 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 57 Ebix Vayam Technologies annual report 2018 


There were no revenues reported in 2016. The company shares its address with Ebix Software India. 


 
Figure 58 Ebix Vayam Technologies annual report 2018 


Further, 79% of the revenue from Vayam is held in accounts receivables. We question whether these sales 


actually took place. 


Ebix Vayam Technologies Limited appears to have a strangely disparate set of operations. Ebix’s webpage for 
Ebix Vayam only contains its policy on e-waste with a number belonging to an e-waste recycling agency.18 . 


A press release mentions Ebix Vayam’s involvement in an Indian government initiative: the Socio-Economic 
Caste Census.  


 
Figure Ebix press release “Ebix Executes New E-Governance Contract For 3 Public Sector Undertakings in India”19 


Another press release names specifically the public sector entities to be surveyed: Bharat Electronics Limited, 


ITI Ltd and the Electronics Corporation of India. Vayam did actually complete the census however it appears to 


have done so sometime in 2015, a year before Ebix Vayam had even formed. While the concluding date for the 


census does not appear to be published anywhere, it appears as though the entire work was mostly complete 


by 201520.

 Indian expansion story: an old-fashioned roll-up 
Those following the story will be aware that Ebix has recently branched out into various other areas to offset 


the falling margins in their native industry. The spread and pace of these acquisitions is ridiculous. The following 


is a slide from Ebix’s investor presentation dated December 3, 2018. 


 
Figure 59 Ebix investor presentation 


To date, the company has branched out into: 


▪ Foreign exchange kiosks (Centrum) 


▪ Inward remittance in India (Wall Street Finance, Youfirst Money Express, Paul Merchants, Transcorp)  


▪ B2B trucking logistics (Routier) 


▪ Consumer travel (Mercury Travels) 


▪ Corporate event and travel management (Leisure Corp) 


▪ Prepaid Cards (ItzCash Card) 


▪ Asset and wealth management software solutions (Miles Software) 


▪ Lending software solutions (Indus Software Technologies) 


This list was officially outdated 3 days later by the announcement of the acquisition of AHA taxis21. 


AHA taxis is a network of on-demand inter-city taxis. The business supposedly takes advantage of finding drivers 


who have just made a one-way intercity trip looking for fares on the way back.  Local filings show the business 


is loss-making and heavily cash flow negative: the business appears to have no assets and simply connects clients 


to drivers. Contrary to the most recent EBix Press release. We’ll publish more on this shortly.

Figure 60 Waah taxis dba AHA Taxis cash flow statement 2018 


The AHA taxis app on the google app store has only 10,000 downloads, with reviews beginning in February 


201722. Prosight Partners also advised Via Media Health in 2014 leading to Ebix’s acquisition of the business in 


2015 based on a testimonial on their website. 


 
Figure 61 Via Med testimonial to Prosight Partners 


We highlight AHA Taxis as it is representative of the increasingly scattered nature of Ebix’s Indian acquisitions. 


Similar to our findings on ProSiebenSat.1, we believe the company is taking on debt to acquire these businesses 


at a reckless pace. One interesting effect is that depending on which pro forma estimates are used, Ebix’s Indian 


organic growth appears low. 


In essence, this is the quintessential roll-up strategy with these purchases being funded through raising debt. 


While the establishment of a remittance entity may have been the original intention, Ebix’s acquisitions have 


been becoming more disparate: it was simple to see how an additional MTSS structure could synergise into 


Ebix’s existing Indian portfolio but we struggle to see how B2B trucking logistics and inter-city taxi services fit in.

The company has long floated the idea of listing these entities as a combined EbixCash entity on the BSE. Below 


is a list of Ebix’s acquisitions in India.

6. Conclusion 
We believe Ebix represents a serious investment risk and see significant downside to its shares. Based on what 


we have found so far, we are unable to quantify this downside. Viceroy’s investigation into Ebix continues: what 


has been presented is simply the most complete of our research thus far. The sheer volume and breadth of 


subsidiary filings, as well as the delay in the signing off and filing of accounts will take more time to process. 


Viceroy are in the process of obtaining further filings and completing a more extensive analysis on Ebix’s 


numerous acquisitions.
