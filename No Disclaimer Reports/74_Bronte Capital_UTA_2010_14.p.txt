Universal Travel Group – another video log
There is more to this story than the dysfunctional website and the fact that an internet travel agent
pays a lot in commissions (as part of cost of goods sold, not salaries I might add).  But for the moment
the website is just so funny.


One reader suggested that it was possible to book a return flight with the return date before the
departure date.  It was not quite possible – but hey – that was because it wasn’t possible to book
anything.  But I tried that trick… and it was fun.  (This video is in high definition so you can see all the
text if you want to push the 720HD option and look on full-screen.)
