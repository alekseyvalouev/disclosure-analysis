Industry OLED display shipment data contradicts
UDC’s exclusivity claims.


Posted on November 6, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, November 6, 2013.    Until recently, Universal Display


Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) had been able to hide the fact that its


sales revenue from red emitter OLED materials had been on a


dramatic and sustained decline. UDC’s unexpected second quarter


red emitter sales losses caused it to issue explanations and


justifications. Actual industry sales data shows the magnitude of the


loss, and suggest the problem is a far more serious one than UDC


has acknowledged. Only when one looks at UDC’s red sales declines


relative to the actual growth in OLED display sales volumes can one


realize just how meaningful and severe the losses have been for


UDC.


According to data compiled from the OLED Association’s quarterly


industry sales surveys the number of OLED displays sold for mobile


phones increased from 31.5 million units in the second quarter of


2012 to 61.2 million units in the second quarter of 2013, equal to a


94% increase. During the same period UDC’s red emitter sales went


from $5.1 million to $3.6 million, equal to a 29% decrease. See our


analysis here.


UDC experienced this astonishing sales loss while continually


claiming that its patents and its contract with Samsung protect it


from competition and that UDC “owns” phosphorescent OLED,


suggesting it has a monopoly that protects its pricing and that


guarantees it a 100% share of the market. UDC’s reported results


contradict these assertions. The OLED Association is an


organization that represents the OLED industry, including Samsung


and LG, in the areas of public policy, environment, market creation,


workforce development and investor relations. The organization


maintains a website located at www.oled-a.org.

Comparing the OLED Association data to UDC’s disclosed red sales


historically shows a stunning inconsistency that UDC has not


explained. Even before UDC’s red emitter sales were down 29% in


the second quarter (while industry sales were up 94%), the same


disturbing pattern was evident in the data for the first quarter of


2013. OLED mobile display shipments were up 30% in Q1 of 2013


while UDC’s red sales were down more than 41% compared to the


prior year quarter.


UDC only commenced disclosing a breakdown of its OLED material


sales by color this year. The disclosures of year-over-year


comparable data show that last year red material sales were


undergoing a tremendous absolute decline that UDC did not


disclose to investors at the time. According to UDC’s own


disclosures, UCD’s quarterly red material sales declined 45% over


the course of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, going from a peak


of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2012 to a trough of $2.8


million in the first quarter of 2013, even as quarterly mobile OLED


display shipments increased 24% over the same period.


Looking at UDC’s red emitter sales per square inch of OLED display


sold makes UDC’s weakness even more striking. The analyst at


Canaccord found a 66% decline in UDC’s red emitter sales per


square inch of OLED display since the beginning of 2012. This


includes a drop of 32% in Q3 2012 and 36% in Q1 2013 in UDC’s red


emitter sales per square inch on a consecutive quarter basis. UDC


didn’t disclose these events at the time, and has yet to explain the


conflict between its poor results and the assurances it has given


investors. See the Canaccord figures here.


UDC claims the declines are due to undisclosed sales terms that


include volume discounts (apparently cumulative) that are


supposedly part of its supply contract with Samsung signed in


August 2011, as well as to supposed improved production efficiency


at Samsung. However, UDC made these claims without disclosing


the terms and only after they had a drastic negative impact, not


when the Samsung deal was first disclosed or as UDC was


experiencing the losses.


The decline in red sales goes to show to weakness of UDC’s


negotiating position back in 2011 with Samsung. Unfortunately for


Samsung, it signed a deal with UDC in 2005 before the OLED


materials market developed and before a string of patent decisions


against UDC, which have highlighted the weakness of its intellectual


property claims.
