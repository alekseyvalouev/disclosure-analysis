Re: KPMG Audit Opinions Regarding U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries of AmTrust Financial 


Services, Inc. (Technology Insurance Company & Affiliates) 





Dear Mr. Casal & Ms. Robinson:1 





The purpose of this letter is to urge KPMG LLC (“KPMG” or the “Firm”) to withdraw its audit 


opinions with respect to the combined statutory financial statements (“financial statements”) of 


the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (“AmTrust”), specifically, 


Technology Insurance Company, Inc. and its U.S. Property Casualty affiliates (“TIC and its U.S. 


P-C Affiliates” or the “Company”), for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. 





As explained in detail below, I believe TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial statements are 


riddled with material misstatements that must be corrected for them to “present fairly, in all 


material respects, the admitted assets, liabilities, and capital and surplus” of TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 and for “the results of their operations and their 


cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed 


or permitted by [their respective] domiciliary insurance departments[,]” as KPMG’s audit 


opinions assert. 





Of course, the presence of numerous uncorrected material misstatements in TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates’ combined annual financial statements should not surprise KPMG considering the 


communication of internal control related matters the Company filed with regulators 


contemporaneously with its audited financial statements in each of the last three years.2   





In my opinion, any failure by KPMG to withdraw its prior audit opinions and demand the 


necessary corrections detailed herein be made before re-issuing its audit opinions would 


constitute further evidence3 of the Firm’s professional malpractice, gross negligence, and/or 


complicity in AmTrust’s on-going fraud (and cover-up efforts) because the detailed discussion 


below provides incontrovertible evidence that TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 and 2018 


financial statements are materially misstated. 4  


                                                             
1 See Appendix A for a list of the courtesy copy recipients of this letter. 
2 See Appendix B 
3 I say “further evidence” because KPMG failed to address the concerns I raised in my January 2017 letter to KPMG, which 
detailed numerous material misstatements in AmTrust’s SEC filings before consenting to AmTrust filing its 2016 Form 10-K. 
Several of the concerns I raised were validated by AmTrust’s subsequent admissions of material misstatements (see AmTrust’s 


2017 Form 10-K, Item 9A). Despite such admissions, KPMG aided AmTrust in its cover-up by not forcing the Company to 
restate its previously issued financial statements to correct for such errors before AmTrust filed its 2017 Form 10-K. 
4 The material misstatements discussed herein are not meant to be an exhaustive list of the errors in TIC and its U.S. P-C 
Affiliates. Instead, they are intended to demonstrate that the Company’s financial statements contain obvious and egregious

In Part I of this letter, I discuss TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ understatement of expenses in its 


2017 financial statements, specifically its understatement of direct losses incurred and its failure 


to reflect the loss on commutation disclosed in its footnotes.  





In Part II, I highlight three ways in which TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates materially overstate the 


Company’s admitted assets in both 2017 and 2018 by improperly treating certain capitalized 


costs as well as amounts due from and/or invested in affiliates as admitted assets. 





Finally, in Part III, I discuss several ways in which TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates substantially 


understated the Company’s liabilities in both 2017 and 2018 by under-reporting its provision for 


reinsurance, improperly applying reinsurance treatment where there was inadequate risk 


transferred and making unsubstantiated adjustments to actuarially-derived reserve estimates.  





As set forth in the summary table below, each of the misstatements in TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates’ financial statements discussed herein exceed $100 million and, therefore, are 


unquestionably material considering the Company’s surplus of approximately $2.076 billion and 


$2.136 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively (as reported).   





 
Description of Misstatement  2017 2018 


Part I – Understated Expenses 


A. Understatement of Direct Losses Incurred $359.5 million  


B. Understatement of Loss on Commutation $502.8 million  


Part II – Overstated Assets 


C. Improper Recognition of Claims Suspense Account Assets $118.6 million $144.4 million 


D. Investments in / Loans to Affiliates $148.9 million $324.0 million 


E. Amounts Due from Affiliates $206.6 million $377.2 million 


Part III – Understated Liabilities 


F. Schedule P / Schedule F Discrepancy $424.8 million $405.9 million 


G. Improper Treatment of Premia Reinsurance Agreement $266.5 million $265.8 million 


H. Unsubstantiated Adjustment to Workers’ Compensation Reserves  $300.5 million 














In Appendix C, I also highlight a number of problems with the claims data presented in Schedule 


P of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ Combined Annual Statement and discuss why such errors 


render the data completely unreliable as a basis for estimating the Company’s reserves for 


unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses.   


                                                             
errors that an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards would not have missed. In addition, 
correcting the errors in the Company’s financial statements would likely necessitate treating a portion (if not all) of its DTAs as 
non-admitted assets.

I. Understated Expenses (Overstated Income) 
 


As discussed below, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 combined statutory financial 


statements contain at least two substantial errors that caused the Company to dramatically 


understate its expenses and thus overstate its net income. In addition, the failure to correct such 


errors means they were implicitly carried over into the 2018 financial statements.  








A. Understatement of Direct Losses Incurred  
 


By definition, losses incurred are paid losses plus the change in reserves for unpaid losses. One 


can observe this relationship in action in the reconciliation of direct losses incurred as reported in 


TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2010 - 2015 and 2018 combined statutory financial statements, 


as set forth in the table below.   








While there were small anomalies in TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2014, 2015 and 2018 


combined statutory financial statements and a larger error in 2016, the 2014, 2015 and 2018 


errors resulted in the Company reporting direct losses incurred no more than 1.3% higher than it 


should have. Moreover, the significant amount of loss reserves acquired in 2016 and a possible 


change in the allocation of a subset of such acquired unpaid losses from direct to assumed might 


explain the difference. 





In contrast, the error in TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 Combined Annual Statement was 


much larger ($360 million; 8.6% of the derived figure) and resulted in a substantial 


understatement of direct losses incurred.5  





Therefore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 audited financial statements appear to 


have significantly understated the Company’s direct losses incurred, which almost 


certainly caused it to materially understate its net losses incurred. 








                                                             
5 I would also note that the variance in direct losses could not have been caused (or affected) by TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 
new (as of October 2017) pooling arrangement.

B. Understatement of Loss on Commutation 
 


In order to institute the pooling arrangement among TIC and its U.S. P-C affiliates that took 


effect on October 1, 2017, their pre-existing reinsurance agreements with each other and with 


AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. (“AII”) were commuted.  





In the footnotes to their audited financial statements (combined), AmTrust’s U.S. subsidiaries 


reported that the commutation reduced underwriting income by approximately $503 million 


(reflecting the time value of money embedded in the ceded unpaid loss and loss adjustment 


expenses that were commuted). 





The same footnote purported that the loss associated with the commutation impacted the “Other 


(commission and bad debt expense)” line of the income statement. However, the income 


statement in the same audited financial statements does not incorporate the loss in the “Other 


underwriting expense incurred” line (nor does the substantial expense appear anywhere else).  





The “Other underwriting expense incurred” line for 2017 was $788.2 million against $2,509.1 


million of net premiums earned, implying an expense ratio of 31.4%. By comparison, the same 


financial statements report that the implied expense ratio for 2016 was 30.3% ($738.6 million / 


$2,434.1 million).  





For the loss on commutation to have been reflected in the expense line it was purported to be in, 


the expense ratio for 2017 exclusive of the loss on commutation for TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates subsidiaries would have had to decline to 11.4% ‒ an implausibly low figure.  





Moreover, a review of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ insurance expense exhibits indicates that 


the commutation losses reported in footnotes was not incorporated into their respective 


underwriting expenses.  





Finally, the “aggregate pooling adjustment[s]” reported by each of the U.S. insurance 


subsidiaries do not correspond to the commutation losses (individually or in aggregate). For 


instance, Wesco Insurance Company (“WIC”) reported a loss on commutation of $218.0 million 


in the footnotes to its annual statement, yet it reported a $15.6 million pooling adjustment gain. 


In aggregate, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported losses of approximately $410.5 million in 


their respective footnotes as compared to pooling adjustment gains of approximately $1.4 million 


(a $411.9 million difference).6 





Therefore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 audited financial statements appear to 


have erroneously excluded the substantial losses incurred by TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates 


associated with the Company’s commutation of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 


previously ceded to AII. 





                                                             
6 It is unclear why the audited financial statements of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported a $503 million loss on 
commutation as compared to the $410.5 million loss the subsidiaries reported in their respective annual statements. I reference 
the $503 million figure in the introductory table because it is the amount reported in the footnotes to TIC and its U.S. P-C 
Affiliates’ Audited Combined Statutory Financial Statements and Schedules.

II. Overstated Assets (Overstated Surplus) 
 





C. Improper Recognition of Claims Suspense Account Assets 
 


Several of the entities that comprise TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported “Claims Suspense 


Account” as write-in assets that they treated as admitted assets in their respective Annual 


Statements. The claims suspense account assets included as admitted assets by such entities 


totaled $118.5 million and $144.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, as set 


forth in the table below.  


 
Claims Suspense Account Assets 


Entity 2017 2018 


Developers Surety & Indemnity Co. $ - million $14.4 million 


Security National Ins. Co. $16.4 million $14.4 million 


Technology Ins. Co. $61.1 million $79.6 million 


Wesco Ins. Co. $41.0 million $36.0 million 


Total $118.5 million $144.4 million 





A suspense account is typically an account in which items temporarily reside before being 


allocated. In other words, it appears TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates recorded claim payments as 


assets (capitalized costs) rather than expenses.7 Clearly, a capitalized claim payment is a non-


admitted asset, as defined in SSAP No. 48 and should be treated as such.9  





Furthermore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ apparent practice of capitalizing claim payments 


into a suspense account distorts the Company’s claims paid and case reserve data in such a way 


that the Company’s estimate of net reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is likely lower 


than it would have been if the capitalized claim payments had been properly allocated. 





Therefore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 audited financial statements appear to 


have improperly admitted the Company’s claims suspense account assets – which represent 


expenditures that should have been expensed (not to mention the knock-on effects the 


improper treatment likely had on its actuarial analysis).10

8 SSAP No. 4 – Assets and Non-admitted Assets. 
9 The Report on Target Examination of Guarantee Insurance Company as of December 31, 2007 confirms the inadmissibility of 
claims suspense account assets. Available at: https://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/Guaranteee12312007.pdf.  
10 In addition, the same four subsidiaries treated “miscellaneous receivables” of $74.8 million as admitted assets as of December 
31, 2018, $51.6 million of which was attributable to TIC. However, there is no disclosure regarding the nature or origin of such 
“miscellaneous” receivables nor does TIC (or any of the entities) disclose the counterparty for such receivables. Therefore, I view 
them as suspect assets warranting close review, but cannot say whether they should be treated as admitted assets or not.

D. Investments in Affiliates & Loans to Affiliates 
 


In its 2017 and 2018 financial statements, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates improperly included 


investments in affiliates as admitted assets,11 as summarized in the table below and as discussed 


in more detail further below. 


 
In $ mm Value as of: 


Asset December 31, 2017 December 31, 2018 


AII Investment Holdings, Ltd.  $43.4 million $48.5 million 


AMT Global $54.2 million  N / A 


Loan to AmTrust Corporate Member, Ltd.  N / A $43.8 million 


Mayfield Holdings N / A $118.2 million 


Note Issued by AmTrust (Parent)  N / A $76.0 million 


PDP Group $51.3 million N / A 


Surplus Note Issued by WIC N / A $37.5 million 


Total $148.9 million $324.0 million 





I would also note that several of the investments identified above were omitted from the footnote 


10M disclosure required by SSAP No. 97 in what I suspect was an attempt to avoid scrutiny.  





For example, footnote 10M of TIC’s 2018 Annual Statement does not list its loan to AmTrust 


Corporate Member, Ltd., its investment in Mayfield Holdings, Inc.,12 or its ownership of the 


surplus note issued by Wesco Insurance Company, and Rochdale Insurance Company does not 


include its loan to AmTrust (parent) in footnote 10M of its 2018 Annual Statement.13 





I suspect that the large and increasing balance of dubious investments in affiliates (along with 


increasing amounts due from affiliates) purchased14 from affiliates has and will continue to serve 


as a way for AmTrust (parent) to extract funds from its U.S. insurance subsidiaries to meet its 


obligations without the decline in surplus associated with dividends. 





1) AII Investment Holdings, Ltd.  
 


TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates included their collective (100%) ownership of AII Investment 


Holdings, Ltd. as an admitted asset valued at $43.4 million and $48.5 million as of December 31, 


2017 and 2018, respectively.  





AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries initially acquired AII Investment Holdings, Ltd. in 


December 2016 from “AFS” (presumably AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., the parent company) 


for $45 million.  





How AmTrust determined the initial $45 million valuation (or any subsequent valuation) is 


unclear, however, because the insurance subsidiaries’ Schedules Y – Part 2 have not reported any 


capital contributions to the entity since its formation on July 11, 2007. Moreover, there are no 


                                                             
11 The table above only lists the Company’s investments in affiliates that were improperly included as admitted assets. 
12 WIC also omitted its investment in Mayfield Holdings, Inc. from footnote 10M of its 2018 Annual Statement.  
13 In fact, RIC did not provide any disclosure in footnote 10M of its 2018 Annual Statement. 
14 The dubious investments referenced above have generally been purchased from non-insurance subsidiaries rather than being 
capital contributions that remain at the affiliated investee.
7 





indications that it has any operations. Therefore, it would appear to be a shell company with no 


assets and, therefore, should be valued at zero.  





2) AMT Global, LLC 
 


TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates included their collective (100%) ownership of AMT Global, LLC 


as an admitted asset valued at $54.2 million as of December 31, 2017.   





AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries initially acquired AMT Global in March 2017 from 


“AMT Investments, LLC” for $69 million and, despite already owning 100% of AMT Global, 


“purchased” an additional investment in AMT Global from AMT Investments for approximately 


$3.5 million during 2018 before selling their shares in AMT Global back to AMT Investments on 


September 30, 2018 for approximately $47.1 million – a loss of approximately $25.5 million 


over 18 months.15 





As with AII Investment Holdings, Ltd., it is unclear how AmTrust determined the $69 million 


initial valuation (or any subsequent valuation) because AMT Global had not received any capital 


contributions since its formation on August 10, 2015.16 Therefore, it would appear to be a shell 


company with no assets and, therefore, should be valued at zero.  





3) Loan to AmTrust Corporate Member, Ltd.  
 


In TIC and its U.S. Affiliates’ 2018 financial statements, the Company reported a $43.75 million 


“intercompany loan” to AmTrust Corporate Member, Ltd. (“ACML”) even though none of 


AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries reported such a transaction in their 2018 investment 


schedules.  





In fact, the first (and only) disclosure of such an investment was in TIC’s 1q19 statutory filing, 


when the $43.75 million loan was reported on Schedule BA – Part 2 (“Other Long-Term Assets 


Acquired and Additions Made During the Current Quarter”). Moreover, AmTrust’s U.S. 


insurance subsidiaries’ Schedules Y – Part 2 only reported $4.3 million of proceeds to “AmTrust 


Corp. Member FAL” from investment transactions (Col. 6), thereby confirming that no such loan 


occurred in 2018.  





Furthermore, the inclusion of the loan to ACML as an asset in TIC and its U.S. Affiliates’ 


(audited) 2018 financial statements without a commensurate increase in reported investments 


relative to the amounts reported in the Company’s 2018 Combined Annual Statement raises 


questions about what other investments were included therein that should not have been. 





                                                             
15 TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ loss on their investment in AMT Global likely would have been even worse had TIC not 
purchased shares in penny stocks at inflated valuations from AMT Global less than three weeks before the insurance subsidiaries 
sold their shares in AMT Global back to AMT Investments.   
16 AMT Investments, LLC, which was formed on March 25, 2015, received $7.6 million in capital contributions during 2016.
8 





Moreover, even if TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates had made the purported loan to ACML, such a 


loan likely should have been valued at zero because ACML’s shareholders’ equity is 


approximately NEGATIVE $200 million (U.K. GAAP).17 





4) Note Issued by AmTrust (Parent)  
 


On February 26, 2018, Rochdale Insurance Company (“RIC”) made a 10-year, $76 million loan 


to AmTrust (its ultimate parent company). On the same day, AmTrust (parent) made a $76 


million capital contributions to TIC for which TIC had recorded a receivable that would not have 


been an admitted asset unless it was paid off before March 1, 2018. 





In accordance with SSAP No. 25 (paragraph 8), a loan or advance from an insurance company to 


its parent or principal owner requires approval from the domiciliary commissioner and a 


determination that the loan or advance is collectible based on the parent or principal owner’s 


independent payment ability.  





According to TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 combined statutory financial statements, the 


Company “received another permitted practice from the state of New York” approving RIC’s 


loan to AmTrust (parent), thereby satisfying the first requirement.  





Despite New York’s inexplicable approval of RIC’s unsecured loan to its ultimate parent 


company and that parent company’s immediate expenditure of the associated proceeds, the loan 


should not have been recognized as an admitted asset because amounts due from AmTrust 


(parent) are not collectible based on its own, independent payment ability.  





Please see Section E (Amounts due from Affiliates) below for a detailed discussion of why 


amounts due from or loaned to AmTrust (parent) were (and remain) uncollectible.  


 
5) Mayfield Holdings, Inc. (n/k/a Amynta Group) 





As of December 31, 2018, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates included their collective 33.4% stake 


in Mayfield Holdings, Inc. (“Mayfield”) as an admitted asset worth $118.2 million after having 


purchased the investment from AMT JV Holdings, LLC (an intermediary holding company of 


AmTrust) for $150.0 million on August 27, 2018.  





Mayfield is the entity AmTrust and Madison Dearborn Partners formed to facilitate AmTrust’s 


partial sale of its fee-related businesses, and TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates appear to be valuing 


the investment using its GAAP equity value.   





Instead, I believe the Company should value its investment in Mayfield in accordance with 


SSAP No. 97 (paragraph 8.b.ii) because Mayfield’s insurance service businesses derive more 


than 20% of their revenue from TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates.  


                                                             
17 ACML’s shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2017 was NEGATIVE £163.8 million and the underwriting syndicates in 
which ACML participates as a corporate member were approximately break-even in 2018. Translated at the USD / GBP 
exchange rate as of December 31, 2018 ($1.2739) implies ACML’s shareholders’ equity was approximately NEGATIVE $208.7 
million.
9 








Of course, the valuation methodology required by paragraph 8.b.ii requires insurance companies 


to make adjustments to the GAAP equity value of its investments in SCAs to more closely align 


the valuation with SAP, primarily by valuing certain GAAP assets – such as deferred acquisition 


costs, goodwill, and intangible assets, which constitute nearly all of Mayfield’s assets – at zero.  





As set forth in the table below, the adjustments required by paragraph 8.b.ii of SSAP No. 97 as

as held for sale as of December 31, 2017,18 render TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ stake in 


Mayfield worthless.  
 





6) PDP Group 
 


As of December 31, 2017, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates included its 80% stake19 in PDP 


Group, Inc. (“PDP Group”), which AmTrust described as “a provider of insurance solutions for 


auto dealers” in its SEC filings, as an admitted asset valued at approximately $51.3 million after 


purchasing the investment in 2017 for $50.1 million.  





Interestingly, TIC and WIC both reported purchasing their respective stakes in PDP Group from 


JP Morgan on March 8, 2017 in their 2017 Schedule D – Part 3 even though they originally 


reported the purchase as being “Direct with Seller” on May 1, 2017 in their respective 2q17 


statutory filings (there was no mention of such purchases in their 1q17 statutory filings). 





Furthermore, TIC and WIC mischaracterized their investments in PDP Group by listing the 


holdings as common stock and marking them with NAIC Market Indicator “U” (implying the 


shares held were traded on a stock exchange other than the New York Stock Exchange, the

10 





American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ National Market System) even though AmTrust 


reported acquiring 100% of PDP Group, Inc. on May 1, 2017 in its SEC filings.20 





Therefore, PDP Group should have been listed on Schedule BA and accounted for as an 


investment in subsidiary, controlled and/or affiliated entity (“SCA”). In addition, the investment 


should have been valued in accordance with paragraph 8.b.ii of SSAP No. 97 because PDP 


Group derives over 20% of its revenues from TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates. 





As with Mayfield, properly valuing the Company’s stake in PDP Group would have rendered it 


worthless (or very nearly so) because $55.6 million of the assets AmTrust recorded in 


conjunction with its acquisition of PDP Group were goodwill and intangible assets as compared 


to a purchase price (and thus initial carrying value) of $62.4 million.  





7) Surplus Note Issued by WIC 
 


On July 31, 2018, Wesco Insurance Company (“WIC”) issued a $37.5 million surplus note to 


TIC, which TIC included as an admitted asset in its 2018 Annual Statement.21  





Pursuant to SSAP No. 41, (paragraph 9b), a surplus note should not be treated as an admitted 


asset if it is issued by “an entity that is subject to any order of liquidation, conservation, 


rehabilitation or any company action level event based on its risk-based capital.” As explained 


throughout this letter, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial statements are replete with errors 


that, if corrected, would result in company action level events at the associated insurance 


companies, including WIC.  





Furthermore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates appear to have (correctly) eliminated the surplus 


associated with WIC’s surplus note in their 2018 financial statements. As the elimination in 


consolidation implies, the surplus note cannot serve as a source of surplus for both TIC (an asset) 


and WIC (quasi paid-in capital) simultaneously. Therefore, TIC’s inclusion of the surplus note as 


an admitted asset inflated its reported surplus on a stand-alone basis, which is used to determine 


its compliance with risk-based capital requirements. 








                                                             
20 I would also note that the purchase price was reported in AmTrust’s SEC filings as $49.8 million of cash consideration plus a 


three-year earn-out with estimated payments of $12.6 million.    
21 TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates appear to have (correctly) eliminated the surplus associated with WIC’s surplus note in their 
2018 financial statements. However, TIC’s inclusion inflated its reported surplus on a stand-alone basis, which is used to 
determine its compliance with risk-based capital requirements.
11 





E. Amounts Due from Affiliates 
 


TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates included as admitted assets approximately $377.2 million and 


$206.6 million as due from affiliates in its 2017 and 2018 financial statements, respectively.  





Entities From Which TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates Report Amounts Due  





Of the $206.6 million and $377.2 million reported in TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial 


statements as due from affiliates as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, nearly all of 


the receivables were due from AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (the ultimate parent) or AmTrust 


North America, Inc. (“ANA”), as set forth in the table below. 


 
Due From (mm) 2017 2018 


AmTrust (parent) $ 86.3 $ 100.0 


ANA $ 112.1 $ 275.6 


WS Aftermarket Services Corp.  $5.9 $ - 


Other Affiliates $2.3 $ 1.5 


Total $ 206.6 $ 377.2 





Other than the amounts due from AmTrust (parent), $76 million22 and $100 million23 of which 


relate to capital contributions that AmTrust (parent) paid subsequent to year-end but before the 


March 1 due date for annual statements, nearly all of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ receivables 


due from affiliates for 2017 and 2018 are purportedly due from ANA.    





However, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates pay ANA for the services they provide, so having 


balances due to ANA would be expected in the ordinary course of business (and subject to 


standard terms of settlement) but the U.S. insurance subsidiaries should not have any balances 


due from ANA as a result of their operations.  





In fact, the statutory filings of individual insurance subsidiaries bear this out. In both 2017 and 


2018, several of AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries report balances due to ANA, but none 


report a balance due from ANA that exceeds $130,000.  





With that said, the two subsidiaries with the largest balances for amounts due from affiliates 


(TIC and WIC) inexplicably failed to disclose any of the affiliates with which they have amounts 


due to or from.  





While one might infer that TIC and WIC were the entities to which ANA owed the amounts 


reported TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial statements, I suspect such balances were the 


result of mischaracterization because ANA would have no reason to have amounts due to TIC 


and/or WIC other than for premiums (which are included in premiums receivable).  





                                                             
22 TIC received a $76 million capital contribution from AmTrust (parent) in February 2018, the funds for which appear to have 


come from the contemporaneous $76 million loan from RIC to AmTrust (parent).  
23 WIC, Security National Ins. Co., and Developers Surety and Indemnity Co. received capital contributions from AmTrust 
(parent) in February 2019 to settle receivables for which those insurance subsidiaries received approval from their domiciliary 
regulators to include amounts due from AmTrust (parent) as admitted assets.
12 





Instead, I suspect such amounts were in fact due from AmTrust (parent) – a suspicion supported 


by TIC’s and WIC’s responses to General Interrogatory #23.2 of their respective 2017 Annual 


Statements, in which TIC and WIC reported that their entire balances due from affiliates as of 


December 31, 2017 were due from their parent company (AmTrust (parent)).  





With respect to 2018, TIC reported $11.8 million due from its parent company in Interrogatory 


#23.2, and WIC marked “Yes” in Interrogatory #23.1 (indicating at least a portion of its 


receivables from affiliates were due from its parent company) but left Interrogatory #23.2 blank. 


However, even the $11.8 million TIC reported as due from AmTrust (parent) demonstrates that 


the balance reported in TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial statements as due from 


AmTrust (parent) is misstated at $100.0 million because, as noted above, WIC, SNIC and DSIC 


reported a combined $100.0 million due from AmTrust (parent). 





Therefore, I believe that at least a portion, if not all, of the amounts TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates reported as due from ANA were in fact due from AmTrust (parent).  





Likely Motivation for Misrepresentation of Counterparties for Affiliate Receivables 





I suspect the likely motivation for AmTrust to mischaracterize the amounts due to TIC and its 


U.S. P-C Affiliates as being due from ANA rather than AmTrust (parent) emanates from the 


differences in requirements for admittance for amounts due from an insurance company’s parent 


or principal owner and the requirements for admittance for amounts due from other related 


parties.  





In accordance with SSAP No. 25 (paragraph 8), a loan or advance from an insurance company to 


its parent or principal owner requires approval from the domiciliary commissioner and a 


determination that the loan or advance is collectible based on the parent or principal owner’s 


independent payment ability.  





In contrast, SSAP No. 25 (paragraph 9) only requires that the management of an insurance 


company evaluate the loan or advance and treat it as non-admitted if it does not constitute an 


arm’s-length transaction and/or is not an economic transaction (as defined in SSAP No. 25). In 


addition, evaluation of the collectability of the loan or advance is only required periodically.  





Because amounts due from a parent company require approval from the insurance company’s 


domiciliary regulator (as compared to management’s assertion that a transaction is arm’s-length 


and has economic substance) and requires an affirmative determination of collectability based on 


the parent’s independent payment ability (as compared to a periodic review for collectability that 


would seem to allow additional considerations), the standards for admitting a receivable due 


from an insurance company’s parent company appear to be more stringent than the standards for 


admitting amounts due from other affiliates
13 





Potential Lack of Domiciliary Commissioner Approval 





As of December 31, 2017, and 2018, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates received domiciliary 


approval to treat receivables due from AmTrust (parent) of $76 million and $100 million, 


respectively, as admitted assets.  





However, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported $86.3 million as due from AmTrust (parent) 


implying that the remaining $10.3 million reported as due from AmTrust (parent) did not receive 


approval from the pertinent domiciliary regulator. Therefore, at least $10.3 million of the 


Company’s reported receivables due from affiliates should have been deemed non-admitted. 





If, as I suspect, the amounts TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported as due from ANA are in fact 


due from AmTrust (parent), then the $112.1 million and $275.6 million that the Company 


reported as due from ANA also lacked approval of the pertinent subsidiaries’ domiciliary 


regulator and should have been deemed non-admitted. 





Balances Due from Affiliates Are Not Collectible 





In addition to the domiciliary regulator approval requirement discussed above, amounts due to an 


insurance company from its parent must be determined to be collectible based on its independent 


payment ability to be treated as an admitted asset and amounts due from an affiliate must be 


reviewed for collectability to be treated as an admitted asset.  





Regardless of whether the amounts TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported as due from affiliates 


were due from AmTrust (parent) or ANA, I believe they should have been non-admitted due to 


AmTrust (parent) and its non-insurance subsidiaries’ inability to pay such amounts.  





AmTrust (Parent)’s Abysmal Financial Position 





As of December 31, 2017, AmTrust (parent) had just $30.6 million cash and investments against 


$1.02 billion of outstanding debt and $1.09 billion due to affiliates (net of amounts due from 


affiliates).24 Therefore, AmTrust (parent) is clearly reliant upon dividends from its subsidiaries to 


meet its obligations. 





Moreover, AmTrust (parent) is unlikely to be able to satisfy its obligations to affiliates (or 


external creditors for that matter) because of its limited ability to extract funds from its insurance 


subsidiaries, as explained below. 





Non-Insurance Subsidiaries Have Limited (If Any) Ability to Pay Dividends 





AmTrust’s insurance subsidiaries comprised nearly all of AmTrust’s investment in subsidiaries 


on a GAAP basis as of December 31, 2017, as set forth in the table below.  





                                                             
24 Unfortunately, the data is not available to perform the same exercise as of December 31, 2018.
14 





Description 2017 


Carrying Value of Subsidiaries $4,951.3 


AII (As Reported) - $2,303.8 


U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ (As Estimated)25 - $2,564.3 


Residual  $83.2 





Moreover, the $83.2 million GAAP carrying value for AmTrust’s non-insurance subsidiaries 


(inclusive of ANA) as of December 31, 2017 includes several hundred million dollars-worth of 


goodwill and intangible assets. Therefore, I believe the ability of AmTrust’s non-insurance 


subsidiaries (including ANA) to pay dividends and/or pay any amounts owed to AmTrust’s 


insurance subsidiaries is quite limited and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 





U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ Ability to Pay Dividends Is Limited 





AmTrust (parent)’s ability to extract dividends from its U.S. insurance subsidiaries (TIC and its 


U.S. P-C Affiliates) to fulfill its internal and/or external obligations is extremely limited. 





Specifically, the maximum dividend payout that TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates could make in 


2018 was $105.3 million, and the availability of dividends from U.S. insurance subsidiaries 


further decreased over the last year such that the maximum payout they can make in 2019 is just 


$30.2 million.  





International Insurance Subsidiaries’ Ability to Pay Dividends Is Limited 





AmTrust (parent)’s ability to extract dividends from its international insurance subsidiaries to 


fulfill its internal and/or external obligations is similarly constrained. 





Because each of AmTrust’s international insurance subsidiaries are direct or indirect subsidiaries 


of AII, one need only consider AII’s ability to pay dividends. Based on AII’s 2017 Financial 


Condition Report (the most recent available), AII’s eligible capital was $1.80 billion as 


compared to its Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) of $1.38 billion.  





Practically speaking, AII cannot reduce its eligible capital to $1.38 billion though because the 


Bermuda Monetary Authority has established a “Target Capital Level” (“TCL”) of 120% of an 


insurer’s BSCR. Any shortfall of its TCL is considered a warning signal. As such, AII’s practical 


minimum capital level as of December 31, 2017 was $1.656 billion, leaving AII with no more 


than $144 million of dividend capacity.  





AmTrust (parent) is unlikely to be able to satisfy its obligations to affiliates (or creditors for that 


matter) because of its limited ability to cause its insurance subsidiaries to pay it dividends and 


the funds from its insurance subsidiaries, as explained below.  





                                                             
25 My estimate of AmTrust’s GAAP carrying value for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 is the sum of (i) 
the surplus reported in their combined annual financial statements ($2,076.1 million) and the DAC on AmTrust’s balance sheet 
not otherwise attributable to AII ($488.2 million).
15 





2018 Balances Reported Do Not Comport with Annual Statements 





In the Company’s 2018 financial statements, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported $377.2 


million due from affiliates. However, in the Company’s 2018 Combined Annual Statement, the 


Company reported $590.0 million due from affiliates.  





The decrease in receivables due from affiliates appear to have been attributed to TIC and were 


largely (though not entirely) offset by a decrease in TIC’s funds held liability and, to a lesser 


extent, an increase in premiums receivable. 





As reported in its Schedule F, effectively all of TIC’s funds held liability related to amounts due 


to AII, implying that the reduction in receivables due from affiliates at TIC was for amounts due 


from AII. However, the only amounts AII should have due to TIC would relate to recoveries for 


loss and loss adjustment expense payments, which insurance companies (including TIC) report 


as reinsurance recoverables for paid loss and loss adjustment expenses.  





Therefore, the reduction from $590.0 million (in the Combined Annual Statement) to $377.2 


million in amounts reported as due from affiliates appears to have resulted from an improper 


netting amounts due to / from different affiliates.

III. Understated Liabilities (Overstated Surplus)  
 


F. Ceded Loss & LAE Reserves Discrepancy (Schedule P vs. Schedule F) 
 


Schedule P vs. Schedule F Discrepancy 





In Schedule P, Part 1 – Summary of its 2017 and 2018 Combined Annual Statements, TIC and 


its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $5,928.6 


million and $5,739.1 million, respectively, as set forth in the table below.  


 
Schedule P, Part 1 – Ceded Unpaid 2017 2018 


Case Loss $2,641.1 $2,767.3 


IBNR Loss $2,437.4 $2,137.8 


Case DCC $286.8 $290.4 


Case IBNR $355.6 $348.6 


A&O $207.8 $195.0 


Total Ceded Unpaid $5,928.6 $5,739.1 





In contrast, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported ceded loss and loss adjustment expense 


reserves of just $5,503.8 million ($424.8 million lower) and $5,333.3 million ($405.9 million 


lower), as set forth in the table below.  


 
Schedule F, Part 3 – Ceded Unpaid 2017 2018 


Case Loss $2,641.1 $2,586.3 


Case LAE $284.8 $288.5 


IBNR Loss $2,194.2 $1,942.0 


IBNR LAE $576.4 $516.5 


Total Ceded Unpaid $5,503.8 $5,333.3 





Since both Schedule P and Schedule F are required to be prepared gross of any non-tabular 


discounting, there should be no discrepancy between the two figures – a fact confirmed by the 


Company’s own reporting history and the reporting history of its peers, as set forth in the tables 


below.

I suspect that the amounts reported in Schedule F are erroneous for two primary reasons.  





First, insurance companies’ statements of actuarial opinion and related actuarial filings reference 


certain amounts reported in Schedule P and are required to be reconciled to such amounts. As 


such, Schedule P is typically subject to a more rigorous review.  





Second, my analysis of the amounts TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported in its Schedules P 


and F for 2017 -- in light of the Company’s quota share with AII -- indicates that it is the 


Company’s Schedule F that is (further) in error, as explained below.  





Because TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates ceded 65% of loss and loss adjustment expenses 


incurred (and thus 65% of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses) through September 30, 


2017 to AII and 50% of such amounts incurred on or after October 1, 2017, the proportion of 


unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses but net of the amount ceded to third parties that the 


Company ceded to AII should be no less than 59.7% and likely closer to 62.9% - 63.4% as of 


December 31, 2017.26 





However, the proportion ceded to AII, as implied using the amounts reported in TIC and its 


Affiliates’ 2017 Schedule F, implies an impossibly low proportion of the Company’s unpaid loss 


and loss adjustment expenses (gross of the quota share but net of third-party reinsurance) at 


54.3%, as set forth in the table below.

Therefore, it is clear that Schedule F, Part 3 of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ Combined 


Annual Statement (which closely approximates the amounts reported in the Company’s audited 


statutory financial statements) is materially misstated and the error relates to the amounts ceded 


to AII,27 the consequences of which are discussed below. 





I would also note that even the figures reported in the Company’s Schedule P, which reflect 


approximately $425 million more ceded reserves, appear to understate the amount recoverable 


from AII (because 56.8% is below the 59.7% minimum derived above). 





                                                             
26 Approximately 65% of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ net reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relate to prior 
years, which are subject to the 65% quota share with AII, with the remaining 35% of its net reserves relating to AY17, the first 
three quarters of which are subject to the 65% quota share with AII. Only loss reserves associated with losses incurred in 4q17 
are subject to the 50% quota share with AII. I derive the 59.7% minimum referenced above by assuming that all of the reserves

Therefore, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ accounting errors related to reinsurance with AII 


appear to run even deeper than the $425 million discrepancy discussed in this section. 





A similar analysis of the amounts TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported in its Schedules P and 


F for 2018 also demonstrates that the amounts reported in Schedule F imply an impossibly low 


proportion of the Company’s unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses (gross of the quota share 


but net of unaffiliated reinsurance) even if one assumes that all reserves for unpaid loss and loss 


adjustment expenses attributable to AY17 relate to 4q17 (and thus subject to the 50% quota share 


with AII), as the table below demonstrates.

A much more reasonable approach to estimating the amount of unpaid loss and loss adjustment 


expenses ceded to AII as of December 31, 2018 would use the blended quota share rate for 2017 


since the first three quarters of the year were subject to a 65% quota share with AII and the 


fourth quarter was subject to a 50% quota share (resulting in a blended quota share of 


~61.25%28).  





As set forth in the table below, I estimate that the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses TIC 


and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ ceded to AII were approximately $5,862.6 million as of December 


31, 2018 using the blended quota share rate for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 


attributable to accident year 2017 (given the amounts the Company reported for net unpaid loss 


                                                             
for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses associated with AY17 relate to losses incurred in 4q17. It is much more likely the 


proportion of reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses associated with AY17 that are attributable to 4q17 is 30 - 
40%, which imply the 62.9% - 63.4% range referenced above.  
27 I also confirmed that the understatement in Schedule F, Part 3 was not attributable to reinsurance with authorized non-affiliates 
by comparing the amounts reported by TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates to the amounts reported by their counterparts in such 
companies’ Schedules F, Part 1. If anything, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates appear to overstate the amounts recoverable from 
authorized reinsurers. For example, TIC reported reinsurance recoverable from Safety National Casualty Corporation on case loss 
reserves of $32.486 million (and $85.272 million for IBNR loss reserves), which was substantially higher than the $1.331 million 
Safety National reported as case loss and loss adjustment reserves assumed from “[TIC], et al.” In contrast to the sizable variance 


in case reserves ceded (assumed), two entities reported figures for premiums ceded (assumed) that were much closer to one 
another (TIC: $3.057 million; SN: $3.615 million) and the variance in premiums ceded (assumed) can largely be explained by 
Safety National’s “et al” (Wesco Ins. Co. reported $0.407 million premiums ceded to Safety National).

Implications of an Error in Schedule F  





Because TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ understatement of ceded reserves for unpaid loss and 


loss adjustment expenses related to an unauthorized insurer (AII), the error would have been 


carried over to Schedule F - Part 5 and caused the Company to under-report the amount of 


security AII would have to provide for TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates to avoid recognizing a 


provision for reinsurance (liability) – likely because AII had no ability to provide any further 


security, let alone $425 million more. 





If, as I suspect is the case,29 AII was unable to provide any additional collateral to TIC and 


its U.S. P-C Affiliates, then reporting the higher (correct) amount in Schedule F – Parts 3 


and 5 would have resulted in the Company recognizing a provision for reinsurance 


commensurate with the resulting security deficit ($425 million30), thereby reducing surplus 


by the same amount as of December 31, 2017. 





                                                             
29 AII’s (in)ability to secure its obligations to, or on behalf of, other AmTrust subsidiaries has been a concern of mine for years. 
See Letter to the Prudential Regulation Authority (U.K.), available at: https://www.alistaircapital.com/s/Letter-to-the-Prudential-
Regulation-Authority-UK.pdf. Since sending this letter in December 2014, I believe the counterparty risk associated with 
AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ inordinately large reinsurance recoverables due from AII has become even more severe 


based on a review of AII’s 2016 and 2017 financial statements, the degree of AmTrust’s reserve deficiency (much of which 
resides at AII), and the Schedule F/P discrepancy discussed above. 
30 TIC reported total security provided by AII that matched the amount recoverable from AII (inclusive of ceded paid loss and 
LAE and ceded unearned premiums) exactly.

G. Improper Treatment of Premia Reinsurance Agreement 
 


On July 6, 2017, AmTrust announced it had entered into an “aggregate reinsurance agreement” 


with Premia Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Premia”) whereby AmTrust agreed to pay $675 million (plus a 


monitoring fee of $1 million per annum) in return for Premia agreeing to pay loss and loss 


adjustment costs (net of inuring reinsurance) of up to $1.025 billion that AmTrust would have 


otherwise paid once AmTrust has paid $5.963 billion for insured events prior to April 1, 2017.  





However, AmTrust’s estimate of its net liability for such unpaid loss and loss adjustment 


expenses was just $6.587 billion as of March 31, 2017, indicating the Company’s executives 


viewed the future value of the Company’s liabilities in excess of $5.963 billion was 


approximately $625 million.  





In my opinion, the reinsurance agreement between AmTrust and Premia raises two significant 


issues. First, I believe AmTrust’s willingness to enter into this transaction demonstrates that its 


executives believed its reserves were severely deficient and, therefore, AmTrust should have 


taken a substantial charge in 2q17, if not earlier, to reflect management’s true “best estimate” of 


the Company’s liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses.  





Second, I believe AmTrust should have applied deposit accounting treatment to the agreement 


because it lacked risk transfer, as detailed below. Of course, applying deposit accounting 


treatment would obligate the Company to recognize the deposit asset associated with the 


agreement at present value, thereby eliminating the $266.5 million surplus benefit to TIC and its 


U.S. P-C Affiliates (which effectively allowed the Company to avoid the decline in surplus 


associated with its adverse development). 





Premia Agreement Indicates AmTrust Knew Its Loss Reserves Were Severely Deficient 





Economics of the AmTrust-Premia Reinsurance Agreement  





AmTrust agreed to pay $675 million now plus an annual monitoring fee for which AmTrust 


estimated the present value to be approximately $9 million in return for up to $1.025 billion over 


a multi-year period starting at least eight years from now.31 In other words, the Company is 


effectively foregoing the investment income on $684 million for at least eight years (and more 


likely 10-12 years32), for the “possibility” to recover up to $350 million more than they paid to 


Premia.  





When AmTrust and Premia struck the agreement, the yield on high quality corporate bonds with 


a similar duration was approximately 3.5% to 4.1%, depending on the index referenced.33 


Therefore, AmTrust’s executives must have believed the recoveries from Premia would 


                                                             
31 On the 3q17 earnings call, AmTrust’s Chief Actuary stated that he does not expect any recoveries for “north of eight years.”  
32 In its 2q17 earnings release, AmTrust estimated the present value of the monitoring fee to be $11 million, indicating it 


expected to at least 12 years of monitoring fees (the discount rate applied is unclear).  
33 The 10-year High Quality Market Corporate Bond Spot Rate was 3.49% for July 2017 and the ICE BAML U.S. Corporate 10-
15 Year Effective Yield was 4.13% on July 3, 2017. Sources: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HQMCB10YR;

approach, if fully exhaust the full $1.025 billion limit for AmTrust to agree to the transaction, as 


the table below indicates. 








Of course, if AmTrust entered the Premia transaction with the expectation of ultimately 


recovering something approaching $1.025 billion from Premia, the Company should have 


reflected it in its net loss reserves as of 2q17 (as its true “best estimate”), if not earlier. 





AmTrust’s Initial Accounting for Reinsurance Agreement with Premia 





As disclosed in its press release announcing the reinsurance agreement with Premia, AmTrust 


expected to book a $61 million pre-tax charge, which was comprised of two components. The 


first component was a charge of $11 million to reflect the present value of monitoring fees to be 


paid to Premia, and the remaining $50 million pre-tax charge reflected the fact that AmTrust 


would pay $675 million to reinsure loss reserves it had carried at $625 million.  





When AmTrust reported its 2q17 results, the Company revised its estimate of the present value 


of the monitoring fee to $9 million and disclosed adverse development of $73.1 million. As a 


result, AmTrust recorded a deferred gain of approximately $14.1 million, which equated to 2.1% 


of the premium it paid to Premia.  





By comparison, AIG’s January 2017 agreement with Berkshire Hathaway (“Berkshire”), 


whereby AIG paid $10.2 billion in return for Berkshire agreeing to pay 80% of AIG’s loss and 


loss adjustment costs in excess of $25 billion for workers’ compensation and other U.S. long-tail 


lines of business for accident years 2015 and prior (subject to a maximum liability to Berkshire 


of $20 billion) resulted in a deferred gain of 25.5% of the premium AIG paid to Berkshire 


because the consideration AIG paid to Berkshire was meaningfully less than AIG’s reserves for 


the business subject to the AIG-Berkshire agreement when the deal was announced. 





As discussed above, the premium paid in retroactive reinsurance agreements such as the ones 


AmTrust and AIG entered into in 2017 are a function of the parties’ expectations for ultimate 


loss and loss adjustment costs, the timing of such payments, and investment yields, with the 


ultimate cost of claims being the most significant variable when interest rates are low. Typically, 


as observed in the AIG transaction, the cedant books a significant deferred gain because the

premium paid is meaningfully less than the anticipated future recoveries to reflect the investment 


income that the reinsurer will earn over time. 





In my opinion, AmTrust’s deferred gain as a percentage of the premium paid (2.1%) as of 2q17 


indicates that the Company could not find a reinsurance counterparty who agreed with its carried 


reserves (for good reason). 





In contrast, AIG’s deferred gain as a percentage of premiums paid was approximately 25.5% 


when it entered into its retroactive reinsurance transaction despite AIG’s poor reputation for 


reserving.  





While the AmTrust and AIG transactions are not perfect comparisons, I believe they share 


significant similarities and that AIG’s accounting demonstrates my point that retroactive 


reinsurance deals such as these should result in significant deferred gains at inception if reserves 


are reasonably stated. As such, the small size of Amtrust’s deferred gain indicates it could not 


find a reinsurance counterparty that agreed with the Company’s loss reserve estimates as of 


2q17. I view this as a confirmation of the inference I drew from the economics of the transaction 


(discussed above) – AmTrust’s executives knew or were reckless in not knowing that the 


Company’s loss reserves were severely deficient and AmTrust should have taken the associated 


charge in 2q17, if not earlier.  





AmTrust’s Crystal Ball Was a Little Too Clear  





Yet another indication that AmTrust knew its loss reserves were severely deficient when it 


entered into the aggregate reinsurance agreement with Premia and that the agreement lacked risk 


transfer is the impossible prescience the Company demonstrated when it chose to incorporate 


$400 million of adverse development coverage (relative to its 1q17 reserves for unpaid loss and 


loss adjustment expenses) into the retroactive reinsurance agreement it entered into with Premia.  





Of course, AmTrust reported adverse development of $73.069 million and $326.931 million in 


2q17 and 3q17, respectively (i.e., exactly $400.000 million combined).  





In my opinion, the precision with which AmTrust anticipated the adverse development it would 


experience in the two quarters to be reported after entering into the reinsurance agreement with 


Premia was not a coincidence.34  





Impetus for Premia Reinsurance Transaction: Surplus Relief 





Instead, I suspect AmTrust was forced to take a reserve charge of at least $400 million by 


KPMG, an insurance regulator, or another interested party. 





However, several of AmTrust’s insurance subsidiaries were not in a position to absorb such a 


charge. For instance, Wesco Insurance Company (“WIC”) had Total Adjusted Capital of $330.3 


                                                             
34 In my opinion, the adverse development recognized in 2q17 and 3q17 matching the potential adverse development coverage 
provided by the Premia agreement precisely also demonstrates that the Company’s reserving processes lack integrity.
23 





million35 as of December 31, 2016, which was just 226.1% of its authorized control level of 


$146.1 million – dangerously close to Company Action Level RBC (200%).36 Furthermore, WIC 


was not an anomaly among AmTrust’s U.S. subsidiaries, and AII was (and remains) in a 


precarious capital position as well.  





I suspect that AmTrust negotiated for time before taking the reserve charges it recognized in 


2q17 and 3q17 so that the Company could arrange a retroactive reinsurance transaction (as it did 


with Premia) to mitigate the damage that its $400 million reserve charges would have done to the 


Company’s largest insurance subsidiaries, knowing full well that its reserves had already been 


determined to be severely deficient and that the Company would take charges to reflect that fact 


in short order.  





Improper Accounting Treatment of Aggregate Reinsurance Agreement 





Of course, the retroactive reinsurance agreement AmTrust signed with Premia would only 


provide the surplus relief desired if the Company recognized it using reinsurance treatment (as 


opposed to deposit treatment). This is likely why they included the assertion that each party “has 


independently determined that the reinsurance provided under this Agreement meets applicable 


risk transfer requirements and is properly accounted for on its financial reports as reinsurance 


[…]” in their agreement.37  Despite this provision in the agreement, I do not believe there was 


sufficient risk transferred to warrant accounting for the AmTrust-Premia agreement using 


reinsurance treatment, as discussed below.  





Premia’s Exposure Does Not Vary Significantly Relative to AmTrust’s Exposure  





For a ceding entity (AmTrust) to apply reinsurance accounting treatment to a given reinsurance 


agreement, SSAP No. 62R requires two conditions be met.  





First, the agreement must transfer “significant insurance risk,” which entails transferring both 


underwriting risk and timing risk. I believe the AmTrust-Premia agreement fails this first 


condition’s underwriting risk requirement, which mandates that the amount to be paid by the 


reinsurer has the potential to vary significantly relative to the claim payments of the cedant.38 





In arriving at this conclusion, I rely on the evidence provided above, which indicates that 


AmTrust knew its reserves were severely deficient when it entered into the agreement (and/or 


Premia would have expected to pay the full limit or something very close to it). As such, I 


believe the probability of significant variation in the amount Premia will ultimately pay to 


AmTrust is remote, and, therefore, the agreement does not transfer significant underwriting risk.

control level or falls below 300% and triggers the trend test (See: http://www.naic.org/store/free/MDL-312.pdf).

38 SSAP No. 62R (paragraph 14): “A reinsurer shall not have assumed significant insurance risk under the reinsured contracts if 
the probability of a significant variation in either the amount or timing of payments by the reinsurer is remote. Implicit in this 
condition is the requirement that both the amount and timing of the reinsurer’s payments depend on and vary with the amount 
and timing of claims settled by the ceding entity […].”

Lack of a Reasonable Possibility of a Significant Loss to Reinsurer 





The second condition that must be met to apply reinsurance treatment is that there must be a 


reasonable possibility that the reinsurer will realize a significant loss.39  





While “reasonably possible” and “significant loss” are not defined in SSAP No. 62R, many 


industry participants have applied the “10/10 rule,” which interprets “reasonably possible” to 


mean at least a 10% chance, and “significant loss” to be a loss of more than 10% of the 


consideration paid to the reinsurer.40 In accordance with paragraph 16 of SSAP No. 62R, the 


ceding entity’s determination of whether a significant loss is reasonably possible is required to 


incorporate all cash flows between the cedant and reinsurer on a present value basis. 





Considering the $675 million premiums and the present value of the monitoring fee of $9 


million, the present value of the consideration due to Premia was $684 million. As such, there 


must be at least a 10% probability that AmTrust will receive recoveries with a present value of 


$752.4 million ($684 million * 110%).  





To arrive at such a result given an estimated weighted average duration of at least 10 years 


(based on AmTrust’s Chief Actuary’s comment that recoveries are not expected for “north of 


eight years”), and assuming the full limit is recovered (the worst case from Premia’s 


perspective), AmTrust and Premia would have had to apply a discount rate of 3.1% (or lower) to 


conclude that there was any possibility of a significant loss to Premia.  





As noted above, however, the yield on high quality corporate bonds of a similar duration was 


3.5% - 4.1% (as noted above) when the agreement was struck, thereby precluding the possibility 


of a “significant” loss, as measured on a present value basis.  





Therefore, AmTrust should not have applied reinsurance treatment to its agreement with Premia.  





Arch Capital’s Decision NOT to Participate in the AmTrust-Premia Transaction 





In addition to providing Premia 25% of its initial equity funding, Arch entered into a 25% whole 


account quota share agreement with Premia, which generated $45 million in premiums to Arch 


in 3q17. However, Arch did not participate on the Amtrust transaction despite the “whole 


account” quota share.  





When I inquired with Arch as to why it had not participated in the transaction, an investor 


relations representative indicated that AmTrust desired reinsurance accounting treatment and 


Arch was uncomfortable with the conclusion that there was adequate risk transfer to justify it.  





In my opinion, Arch’s apparent disagreement with the conclusion that there was adequate risk 


transfer to justify reinsurance accounting further corroborates the evidence discussed above.

Inadequate Security Provided by Unauthorized Reinsurer (Premia) 





Even if one ignores TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ improper accounting treatment for its 


reinsurance agreement with Premia, the Company should have recognized a provision for 


reinsurance because Premia is an unauthorized (re)insurer that has not provided the Company 


with sufficient security to avoid such a provision.  





Premia is an Unauthorized Reinsurer 





Premia Re is a Bermuda-domiciled reinsurance company,41 making it an unauthorized reinsurer. 


As such, the credit for reinsurance that TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates are allowed to recognize 


is limited to the recoverables for which Premia has provided qualifying collateral.42 





Inadequate Security Provided by Premia  





By Premia’s own admission, the collateral it provided to AmTrust (inclusive of TIC and its U.S. 


P-C Affiliates) as of December 31, 2017 was just $775 million – far less than the reinsurance 


recoverables recognized by AmTrust ($1.025 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018) and/or 


the contra-liability reported by TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates ($879.0 million as of December 


31, 2017 and 2018).  





Specifically, Premia disclosed that the fair value of the trust funds it had set up for the benefit of 


its cedants was $966.1 million43 as of December 31, 2017 (its 2018 financial statements are not 


yet available), of which $100 million was “additional collateral related to Client 1 [AmTrust],” 


which aligns with Premia-AmTrust agreement AmTrust filed as an exhibit to its 2q17 Form 10-Q 


filed with the SEC.44   





As set forth in the table below, there are three primary ways (explained below) one might 


estimate the provision for reinsurance that TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates should have 


recognized as a result of the collateral deficiency vis-à-vis Premia. 


 
Approach AmTrust Consolidated Proportionate Collateral45 100% to U.S. Subsidiaries 


Collateral Requirement $1,025.0 million $879.0 million $879.0 million 
    


Total Collateral from Premia ~$775.0 million ~$775.0 million ~$775.0 million 


% of Collateral 100.0% 85.8% 100.0% 


Collateral in Trust ~$775.0 million ~$664.6 million ~$775.0 million 
    


Provision for Reinsurance $250.0 million $214.4 million $104.0 million 





                                                             
41 https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-28-03-43-41-Premia-Reinsurance-Ltd---2017-Financial-Statements.pdf.  
42 SSAP No. 62R (paragraph 56). 
43 Premia’s $966.1 million is comprised of approximately $775 million in trust for the benefit of AmTrust ($675 million initial 
premium + $100 million additional collateral) and approximately $191.1 million for the benefit of “Client 2” ($181.5 million 
initial premium + $20 million additional collateral - $10 million paid losses).  
44 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1365555/000136555517000129/exhibit106reinsuranceagree.htm; (see Article 15 – 
Trust Account). 
45 In this scenario, I assume that Premia’s collateral is allocated proportionately to the recoverables reported by TIC and its U.S. 
P-C Affiliates on the one hand and AII on the other (85.8% = $879.0 million / $1,025.0 million). 



https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-28-03-43-41-Premia-Reinsurance-Ltd---2017-Financial-Statements.pdf

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1365555/000136555517000129/exhibit106reinsuranceagree.htm
26 





Comparing the collateral from Premia to AmTrust’s consolidated reinsurance recoverables vis-à-


vis Premia (AmTrust Consolidated), one could argue that AmTrust (and, by extension, its U.S. 


insurance subsidiaries) should recognize a provision for reinsurance of approximately $250 


million.  





Alternatively, one might expect a provision for reinsurance of approximately $214.4 million 


assuming Premia’s collateral is allocated between AmTrust’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries and AII 


in proportion to the amount of reinsurance recoverables recognized (which were in proportion to 


the premium paid).  





The lowest possible provision for reinsurance one might be able to support is $104.0 million, 


which assumes that all of Premia’s collateral is provided to TIC and its U.S. P-C affiliates (even 


though AII paid a meaningful portion of the premium and recognizes a commensurate share of 


the associated reinsurance recoverables).  











As explained above, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates have (and continue to) recognize more 


credit for reinsurance as a result of the Company’s reinsurance agreement with Premia 


because the agreement lacks risk transfer and/or because the collateral provided by Premia 


is substantially less than the reinsurance recoverables reported by the Company.
27 





H. Unsubstantiated Adjustment to Workers’ Compensation Reserves 
 


In 2018, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported approximately $328.6 million46 of favorable net 


development for workers’ compensation reserves,47 as compared to a 2017 reserve balance of 


approximately $2.169 billion. At the same time, AmTrust’s quota share partner, Maiden 


Holdings, Ltd. reported severe adverse development ($196.0 million) for the workers’ 


compensation business it assumed from the Company.48 





The Company’s dramatic reduction in loss reserves for workers compensation claims provided a 


critical boost to the surplus position of its insurance subsidiaries49 and almost fully offset the 


severe adverse development it experienced in its other lines of business, especially commercial 


auto and other liability (occurrence) such that TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ consolidated 


adverse net development was just $19 million.50  





As set forth in the excerpt below, TIC’s statement of actuarial opinion notes that TIC and its U.S. 


P-C Affiliates made an explicit adjustment in anticipation of an improvement in claims 


outcomes as a result of initiatives started in 2018 (emphasis added).51  





During 2018, The Lead Company’s [TIC’s] claims department has started several 


initiatives that The Lead Company’s management expects to reduce future costs for 


workers’ compensation claims. In anticipation of this, The Lead Company has 


explicitly reflected a reduction in recorded loss and LAE reserves for workers’ 


compensation. There is a risk that the savings may not materialize to the extent they are 


reflected in The Lead Company’s estimates.  





In other words, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates made an (enormous) explicit adjustment to the 


actuarially supported reserve estimate “in anticipation” of an improvement in claims outcomes 


that could not be supported by existing data, as demonstrated by the consulting actuary’s 


comment that “the internal claims initiatives the Company undertook [that] limit the amount of 


available, credible, historical data that can be used to project the Company’s unpaid loss and 


LAE liabilities.”52 





Another term for such a management override of the underlying accounts is an unsupported top-


side adjustment – a tactic used by some of the largest accounting frauds in history, including 


WorldCom53 and Cendant.54  


                                                             
46 TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ favorable gross development for workers’ compensation claims was $801.0 million in 2018, as 


compared to a 2017 gross reserve balance of $5.943 billion.  
47 As reported in TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 and 2018 (as amended) Schedules P, Part 1D. 
48 Maiden Holdings, Ltd.’s 2018 Form 10-K. 
49 In addition to providing a direct boost to surplus, the Company’s favorable development in workers’ compensation 
significantly reduced its authorized control level capital, thereby staving off company action level events among its insurance 
subsidiaries.

Concluding Comments 





As the evidence presented in this letter has made clear, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 and 


2018 financial statements are rife with material misstatements.  





Therefore, I respectfully submit that KPMG is obligated to withdraw the audit opinions it 


provided with respect to TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 2017 and 2018 financial statements and 


notify the Company’s domiciliary regulators that such financial statements were materially 


misstated and, therefore, should no longer be relied upon.55  





Should you have any questions regarding this matter, I can be reached at 


cnelson@alistaircapital.com or (214) 756-6085.  





Sincerely, 
 





Casey H. Nelson

Appendix C: Erroneous Claims Reporting 





As discussed below, the data presented in Schedule P of TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ 


Combined Annual Statement is wholly unreliable because they imply nonsensical and/or 


implausible changes in claim patterns. Therefore, the data is not a reliable basis on which to form 


an opinion as to whether TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates’ financial statements are free from 


material misstatements. 





Sequential Declines in Cumulative Claims Reported  





As set forth in the tables below, TIC and its U.S. P-C Affiliates reported lower figures for 


cumulative claims reported across numerous accident years in 2018 for both the Commercial 


Auto and Other Liability – Occurrence lines of business.

Cumulative reported claims should obviously only rise over time, thus rendering the claims 


reporting noted above impossible. As such, the claims data referenced above is not a reliable 


basis on which to form an opinion about the Company’s financial statements.
35 





Implausible Declines in Claims Outstanding 





In addition, the year-over-year declines in claims outstanding reported by TIC and its U.S. P-C 


Affiliates across its three largest lines of business as set forth in the tables below are implausible 


(to say the least), further indicating that the data underlying the 2017 and 2018 financial 


statements is unreliable.
