Summary


Short Ideas Healthcare


Osiris Therapeutics is restating its 2014 financials and still working on releasing its
2015 financials.


The company's executive suite has featured a revolving cast of questionable and
lightly experienced individuals.


Osiris has been cited by the FDA for improper marketing practices.


Investing in oil exploration, gold prospecting and biotechnology is high-risk/high-return
speculation. Such plays are about getting rich quick, and high hopes and dreams often
attract scallywags - a desirable ingredient in short-selling candidates. We think Osiris
Therapeutics, Inc. ("NASDAQ:OSIR" - $5.18), a Columbia, Maryland-based trafficker in
used human tissue, is flailing and infested with vermin.


December 14, 2015 - OSIR's auditor, BDO USA, resigns in the wake of questions about
OSIR's accounting and business practices.[1] As of November 8, 2016, Osiris had yet to
file its financial results for the year 2015 or for any quarter in 2016.

March 15, 2016 - Unable to file its Form 10-K, OSIR files the esoteric mea culpa Form
10-NT instead.[2] In its last timely filed Form 10-Q [3] (August 10, 2015), the company
reported 47% year-over-year sales growth that yielded a 121 days sales outstanding
and 232 days in inventory! Amongst the reasons for the inflated receivables was a one-
year extension of payment terms which were expected to come due in the end of 2015.
It remains unclear whether these payments were ever collected.


March 15, 2016 - The SEC subpoenas accounting records from OSIR. The day before
this subpoena, the company had announced that for the fiscal year 2014 and the first
nine months of 2015, one should probably not rely upon its previously filed reports.[4]


March 18, 2016 - OSIR's National Sales Director, Todd Clawson, is indicted for bribery,
conspiracy to commit criminal conflicts of interest and healthcare fraud.[5] Prior to
joining OSIR, Mr. Clawson worked for Advanced BioHealing, Inc. (ABHB) ("ABH"),
where prosecutors allege that he furnished illegal kickbacks to Veterans Administration
podiatrists so they would procure ABH's wound-healing products. Later that month,
Clawson pleads guilty to bribery in federal court.[6]


May 17, 2016 - OSIR's closest competitor, MiMedx Group, Inc. (MDXG), sues OSIR
under the Lantham Act, alleging that OSIR knowingly published a false and misleading
study. The suit also claims OSIR collaborated with the physician in charge of the study
to manipulate and falsify results to favor the company.[7]


June 9, 2016 - OSIR President and CEO Dwayne Montgomery resigns suddenly for
"medical reasons".[8] His replacement, David Dresner, has no healthcare experience.
During the period September 2015 to June 2016, the company churned through three
CEOs and two CFOs.


September 26, 2016 - The FDA requested in writing that OSIR make changes to its
marketing of Grafix "cryopreserved placental membrane" wound care products in order
to be compliant with federal medical marketing laws. OSIR had previously judged that
two of its products, Grafix and Ovation, could bypass FDA regulatory review, as they are
recycled human tissue - a category the FDA calls "HCT/P". The FDA disagreed.[9]

October 3, 2016 - OSIR lauds the appointment of Alberto Avendano, MD, as chief
medical officer. Previously, Dr. Avendano worked for Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (OTCPK:RBGPF) ("Reckitt"). On February 25, 2013, the FDA asked the Federal
Trade Commission to investigate Reckitt.[10] On December 3, 2013, both the IRS and
U.S Office of Inspector General raided Reckitt's offices.[11]


November 7, 2016 - OSIR issues an 8-K with its mea culpa as to an estimated large
shortfall in 2014 revenues. The company confesses that it has little clarity on revenues
and profits, but is bold enough to forecast future rosy revenue for 2016 (even though
OSIR acknowledges that it can't even reasonably report historical results.)[12]


Sometimes, an old pigeon with one missing wing hobbling down the interstate highway
is the easiest to run over - as gruesome and pathetic as that may be.
