The Short Case for Zalicus: Not Worth Its Market Cap

The fair value of Zalicus (ZLCS) shares is about $0.50 to $1.00. Our fund is short Zalicus.


Calculating the fair value of Zalicus is relatively straightforward. There are two main
assets, Exalgo and Synavive.


Exalgo is a pain drug sold by Covidien (COV). The royalties due to Zalicus are run-rating
at approximately $1.5 million annually. The drug seems to have peaked in sales. Even
assuming it doubles and then peaks, the Exalgo royalties ($3m X 8x sales for a cost-free
royalty) are worth $24 million, or $0.25 per share. Exalgo isn't quite the flop a Nuedexta or
Bidil is, but for it to be a meaningful drug for Zalicus' meager royalty share, it will have to
do a lot more in revenue to move the needle for this minority owner.


Synavive is a maligned drug. In 2008, the Synavive "COMET-1" study for osteoarthritis
failed. How soon the market forgets. This combination of two generic drugs did not do any
better (amazingly, it did worse!) than its component drugs. Why should we expect a
different outcome from the SYNERGY study? The biological rationale for this drug
(formerly known as CRX-102) is flawed, and that was proven in COMET-1. I think Zalicus
management is taking this study on because they have nothing better to do. With
"SYNERGY", management gets to continue the farce that the company's market cap of
$250 million resembles those of other "promising phase 2 companies".


Synavive is the combination of prednisolone and dipyridamole. The company claims they
have a composition of matter patent on the combination of two extremely old drugs.
Someone should inform management that to win a composition of matter patent, they
should probably invent the compound in question first. Synavive won't work in SYNERGY.
This asset is worthless. It's worse than worthless--it will eat up $10 to $20 million in cash
as the SYNERGY study reads out in the next year.


I value the rest of the pipeline, including the interesting Nav ion channel drugs, with a
modest $0.25 value until they enter the clinic.


With 90% downside, ZLCS is a great short. I think the average investor forgets there is no
difference between a $2 stock and a $20 stock and a $200 stock and your expected
return. A smaller stock price is actually inversely correlated with performance.
